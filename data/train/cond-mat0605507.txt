    "professor herbert walther has taught us that good physics unifies and unites seemingly different fields . nowhere is this more apparent than in the current studies of bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) and coherent atom optics which draw from and contribute to the general subject of coherence effects in many - body physics and quantum optics .",
    "it is in this spirit that the present paper presents the recent application of techniques , ideas , and theorems which have been developed in understanding lasers and squeezed states to the condensation of @xmath1  bosons .",
    "highlights of these studies , and related points of bec history , are described in the following paragraphs .",
    "bose  @xcite got the ball rolling by deriving the planck distribution without using classical electrodynamics , as planck  @xcite and einstein  @xcite had done .",
    "instead , he took the extreme photon - as - a - particle point of view , and by regarding these particles as indistinguishable obtained , among other things , planck s result , @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the mean number of photons with energy @xmath8 and wavevector @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 is the blackbody temperature , and @xmath12 is boltzmann s constant .",
    "however , his paper was rejected by the _ philosophical magazine _ and so he sent it to einstein , who recognized its value .",
    "einstein translated it into german and got it published in the _ zeitschrift fr physik _",
    "he then applied bose s method to atoms and predicted that the atoms would `` condense '' into the lowest energy level when the temperature was low enough  @xcite .",
    "time has not dealt as kindly with bose as did einstein . as is often the case in the opening of a new field , things were presented and understood imperfectly at first .",
    "indeed bose did his `` counting '' of photon states in cells of phase space in an unorthodox fashion .",
    "so much so that the famous max delbrck wrote an interesting article  @xcite in which he concluded that bose made a mistake , and only got the planck distribution by serendipity .",
    "we here discuss this opinion , and retrace the steps that led bose to his result .",
    "sure , he enjoyed a measure of luck , but his mathematics and his derivation were correct .",
    "einstein s treatment of bec of atoms in a large box showed a cusp in the number of atoms in the ground state , @xmath13 , as a function of temperature , @xmath14 for @xmath15 , where @xmath1 is the total number of atoms , and @xmath16 is the ( critical ) transition temperature .",
    "uhlenbeck  @xcite criticized this aspect of einstein s work , claiming that the cusp at @xmath17 is unphysical .",
    "einstein agreed with the uhlenbeck criticism but argued that in the limit of large numbers of atoms ( the thermodynamic limit ) everything would be okay .",
    "later , uhlenbeck and his student kahn showed  @xcite that einstein was right and put the matter to rest ( for a while ) .    fast forward to the present era of mesoscopic bec physics with only thousands ( or even hundreds ) of atoms in a condensate .",
    "what do we now do with this uhlenbeck dilemma ?",
    "as one of us ( w.  k. ) showed some time ago @xcite , all that is needed is a better treatment of the problem .",
    "einstein took the chemical potential to be zero , which is correct for the ideal bose gas in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "however , when the chemical potential is treated more carefully , the cusp goes away , as we discuss in detail , see , e.g. , figs .",
    "[ n0n2me]a and  [ n0 ] .",
    "so far everything we have been talking about concerns the average number of particles in the condensate .",
    "now we turn to the central focus of this review : fluctuations in the condensate particle number .",
    "as the reader will recall , einstein used the fluctuation properties of waves and particles to great advantage .",
    "in particular he noted that in planck s problem , there were particle - like fluctuations in photon number in addition to the wave - like contribution , i.e. @xmath18 and in this way he argued for a particle picture of light .    in his studies on bose - einstein condensation , he reversed the logic arguing that the fluctuations in the ideal quantum gas also show both wave - like and particle - like attributes , just as in the case of photons .",
    "it is interesting that einstein was led to the wave nature of matter by studying fluctuations .",
    "we note that he knew of and credited de broglie at this point well before wave mechanics was developed .",
    "another important contribution to the problem of bec fluctuations came from fritz london s observation  @xcite that the specific heat is proportional to the variance of a bose - einstein condensate and showed a cusp , which he calculated as being around 3.1k .",
    "it is noteworthy that the so - called lambda point in liquid helium , marking the transition from normal to superfluid , takes place at around 2.19k .",
    "however , ziff , uhlenbeck and kac  @xcite note several decades later that there is a problem with the usual treatment of fluctuations .",
    "they say :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ [ when ] the grand canonical properties for the ideal bose gas are derived , it turns out that some of them differ from the corresponding canonical properties  even in the bulk limit !  the grand canonical ensemble ",

    "large fluctuations are a feature of the thermal behavior of systems of bosons .",
    "if @xmath19 is the mean number of non - interacting particles occupying a particular one particle state , then the mean square occupation fluctuation in the grand canonical picture is @xmath20 .",
    "if , however , the system has a fixed total number of particles @xmath1 confined in space by a trapping potential , then at low enough temperature @xmath11 when a significant fraction of @xmath1 are in the ground state , such large fluctuations are impossible . no matter how large @xmath1 , the grand canonical description can not be even approximately true .",
    "this seems to be one of the most important examples that different statistical ensembles give agreement or disagreement in different regimes of temperatures . to avoid the catastrophe ,",
    "the acclaimed statistical physicist d. ter haar @xcite proposed that the fluctuations in the condensate particle number in the low temperature regime ( adapted to a harmonic trap ) might go as @xmath21 this had the correct zero limit as @xmath22 , but is not right for higher temperatures where the leading term actually goes as @xmath23^{1/2}$ ] .",
    "the point is that fluctuations are subtle ; even the ideal bose gas is full of interesting physics in this regard .    in this paper , we resolve the grand canonical fluctuation catastrophe in several ways .",
    "in particular , recent application of techniques developed in the quantum theory of the laser  @xcite and in quantum optics  @xcite allow us to formulate a consistent and physically appealing analytical picture of the condensate fluctuations in the ideal and interacting bose gases .",
    "our present understanding of the statistics of the bec fluctuations goes far beyond the results that were formulated before the 90 s bec boom , as summarized by ziff , uhlenbeck , and kac in their classical review  @xcite .",
    "theoretical predictions for the bec fluctuations , which are anomalously large and non - gaussian even in the thermodynamical limit , are derived and explained on the basis of the simple analytical expressions @xcite .",
    "the results are in excellent agreement with the exact numerical simulations . the existence of the infrared singularities in the moments of fluctuations and the universal fact that these singularities are responsible for the anomalously large fluctuations in bec , are among the recent conceptual discoveries .",
    "the quantum theory of laser threshold behavior constitutes another important advance in the physics of bosonic systems .",
    "the laser made its appearance in the early 60 s and provided us with a new source of light with a new kind of photon statistics . before the laser , the statistics of radiation were either those of black - body photons associated with planck s radiation , which for a single mode of frequency @xmath24 takes the form @xmath25 or when one considers radiation from a coherent oscillating current such as a radio transmitter or a microwave klystron the photon distribution becomes poissonian , @xmath26 where @xmath19 is the average photon number .",
    "however , laser photon statistics , as derived from the quantum theory of the laser , goes from black - body statistics below threshold to poissonian statistics far above threshold . in between , when we are in the threshold region ( and even above threshold as in the case , for example , of the helium neon laser ) , we have a new distribution .",
    "we present a review of the laser photon statistical problem .",
    "it has been said that the bose - einstein condensate is to atoms what the laser is to photons ; even the concept of an atom laser has emerged . in such a case , one naturally asks , `` what is the statistical distribution of atoms in the condensate ? '' for example , let us first address the issue of an ideal gas of @xmath1 atoms in contact with a reservoir at temperature @xmath11 .",
    "the condensate occupation distribution in the harmonic trap under these conditions at low enough temperatures is given by the bec master equation analysis as @xmath27^{n - n_{0}}}{(n - n_{0})!}\\text{. }   \\label{pn0 bec}\\ ] ] the mean number and variance obtained from the condensate master equation are in excellent agreement with computer simulation ( computer experiment ) as shown in fig .",
    "[ n0n2me ] .",
    "we will discuss this aspect of the fluctuation problem in some detail and indicate how the fluctuations change when we go to the case of the interacting bose gas .",
    "the fascinating interface between superfluid he  ii and bec in a dilute gas was mapped out by the experiments of reppy and coworkers  @xcite ; and finite - size effects were studied theoretically by m. fisher and co - workers @xcite .",
    "they carried out experiments in which he  ii was placed in a porous glass medium which serves to keep the atoms well separated .",
    "these experiments are characterized by a dilute gas bec of @xmath1 atoms at temperature @xmath11 .    of course , it was the successful experimental demonstration of bose - einstein condensation in the ultracold atomic alkali - metal  @xcite , hydrogen  @xcite and helium gases  @xcite that stimulated the renaissance in the theory of bec . in",
    "less than a decade , many intriguing problems in the physics of bec , that were not studied , or understood before the 90 s  @xcite , were formulated and resolved .",
    "= 1.05=0.5    \\6 .",
    "finally , we turn on the interaction between atoms in the bec and find explicit expressions for the characteristic function and all cumulants of the probability distribution of the number of atoms in the ( bare ) ground state of a trap for the weakly interacting dilute bose gas in equilibrium .",
    "the surprising result is that the bec statistics is not gaussian , i.e. , the ratio of higher cumulants to an appropriate power of the variance does not vanish , even in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "we calculate explicitly the effect of bogoliubov coupling between excited atoms on the suppression of the bec fluctuations in a box ( `` homogeneous gas '' ) at moderate temperatures and their enhancement at very low temperatures .",
    "we find that there is a strong pair - correlation effect in the occupation of the coupled atomic modes with the opposite wavevectors @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "this explains why the ground - state occupation fluctuations remain anomalously large to the same extent as in the non - interacting gas , except for a factor of 1/2 suppression .",
    "we find that , roughly speaking , this is so because the atoms are strongly coupled in correlated pairs such that the number of independent stochastic occupation variables ( `` degrees of freedom '' ) contributing to the fluctuations of the total number of excited atoms is only 1/2 the atom number @xmath1 .",
    "this is a particular feature of the well studied quantum optics phenomenon of two - mode squeezing ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the squeezing is due to the quantum correlations that build up in the bare excited modes via bogoliubov coupling and is very similar to the noise squeezing in a nondegenerate parametric amplifier .    throughout the review",
    ", we will check main approximate analytical results ( such as in eqs .",
    "( [ ii40 ] ) , ( [ ii54 ] ) , ( [ iii19 ] ) , ( [ iii71 ] ) , ( [ iii72a ] ) ) against the `` exact '' numerics based on the recursion relations  ( [ iii76 ] ) and ( [ iii77 ] ) which take into account exactly all mesoscopic effects near the critical temperature @xmath3 .",
    "unfortunately , the recursion relations are known only for the ideal bose gas . in the present review",
    "we discuss the bec fluctuations mainly in the canonical ensemble , which cures misleading predictions of the grand canonical ensemble and , at the same time , does not have any essential differences with the microcanonical ensemble for most physically interesting quantities and situations . moreover , as we discuss below , the canonical partition function can be used for an accurate calculation of the microcanonical partition function via the saddle - point method .",
    "in late 1923 , a certain satyendranath bose , reader in physics at the university of dacca in east bengal , submitted a paper on planck s law of blackbody radiation to the _",
    "philosophical magazine_. six months later he was informed that the paper had received a negative referee report , and consequently been rejected  @xcite .",
    "while present authors may find consolation in the thought that the rejection of a truly groundbreaking paper after an irresponsibly long refereeing process is not an invention of our times , few of their mistreated works will eventually meet with a recognition comparable to bose s . not without a palpable amount of self - confidence , bose sent the rejected manuscript to albert einstein in berlin ,",

    "bose is resorting to a fundamental principle of statistical mechanics , according to which the probability of observing a state with certain macroscopic properties  in short : a macrostate  is proportional to the number of its microscopic realizations  microstates  compatible with the macroscopically given restrictions .",

    "how many microstates are compatible with this specification ?",
    "we may place two quanta in one out of four cells , and then choose one out of the remaining three cells to be the empty one .",
    "after that there is no further choice left , since each of the two other cells now has to host one quantum .",

    "however , if a cell pattern is obtained from another one merely by a rearrangement of those @xmath49 cells containing no quantum , the configuration remains unchanged .",
    "obviously , there are @xmath62 such `` neutral '' rearrangements which all correspond to the same configuration .",
    "the same argument then applies , for any @xmath63 , to those @xmath64 cells containing @xmath65 quanta : each of the @xmath66 possibilities of arranging the cells with  @xmath65 quanta leads to the same configuration .",
    "thus , each configuration is realized by @xmath67 equivalent arrangements of cells , and the number of different configurations , or microstates , is given by the total number of arrangements divided by the number of equivalent arrangements , that is , by bose s expression  ( [ eq : bose ] ) .",
    "there is one proposition tacitly made in this way of counting microstates which might even appear self - evident , but which actually constitutes the very core of bose s breakthrough , and which deserves to be spelled out explicitly : when considering equivalent arrangements as representatives of merely one microstate , it is implied that the quanta are _ indistinguishable_. it does not matter `` which quantum occupies which cell '' ; all that matters are the occupation numbers @xmath64 .",

    "he abandons his previous `` single - cell '' approach and again considers the collection of quantum cells with energies between @xmath133 and @xmath134 , the number of which is @xmath135 then he juxtaposes in detail bose s way of counting microstates to what is done in classical statistics . assuming that there are @xmath136 quantum particles falling into @xmath137 , bose s approach  ( [ eq : bose ] ) implies that there are @xmath138 possibilities of distributing the particles over the cells .",
    "this expression can easily be visualized : drawing the @xmath136 particles as a sequence of @xmath136 `` dots '' in a row , they can be organized into a microstate with specific occupation numbers for @xmath139 cells  again assuming that it does not matter which particle occupies which cell  by inserting @xmath140 separating `` lines '' between them .",
    "thus , there are @xmath141 positions carrying a symbol , @xmath136 of which are dots .",
    "the total number of microstates then equals the total number of possibilities to select the @xmath136 positions carrying a `` dot '' out of these @xmath141 positions , which is just the binomial coefficient stated in eq .",
    "( [ eq : binom ] ) . to give an example : assuming that there are @xmath142 particles and @xmath143 cells , eq .  ( [ eq : binom ] ) states that there are altogether @xmath144 microstates . on the other hand ,",

    "[ ap : proof ] we provide a proof of this identity . with this background ,",
    "let us return to einstein s reasoning : when taking into account all energy intervals @xmath149 , the total number of microstates is given by the product @xmath150 , providing the entropy functional @xmath151 & = & \\sum_{\\nu } \\big[(n_{\\nu } + z_{\\nu } ) \\ln ( n_{\\nu } + z_{\\nu } ) -n_{\\nu } \\ln n_{\\nu } -z_{\\nu } \\ln z_{\\nu } \\big ]   \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\sum_{\\nu } \\left [ n_{\\nu } \\ln \\!\\left ( 1+\\frac{z_{\\nu } } { n_{\\nu } } \\right ) + z_{\\nu } \\ln \\!\\left ( \\frac{n_{\\nu } } { z_{\\nu } } + 1\\right ) \\right ] \\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the maximizing set @xmath152 now has to obey the two constraints @xmath153 but there is no more need for the multipliers  @xmath76 appearing in the previous eqs .",
    "( [ eq : varb ] ) and ( [ eq : vare ] ) , since the constraints  ( [ eq : cells ] ) or ( [ eq : conp ] ) are automatically respected when starting from the convenient expression  ( [ eq : binom ] ) .",

    "but what , einstein asks , would have resulted had one not adopted bose s prescription  ( [ eq : bose ] ) and thus counted equivalent arrangements with equal population numbers only once , but rather had treated the particles as classical , statistically independent entities ?",
    "then there obviously are @xmath157 possibilities of distributing the @xmath136 particles belonging to @xmath158 over the @xmath139 cells : each particle simply is placed in one of the @xmath139 cells , regardless of the others .",

    ", the quantum ideal gas of nonzero mass particles with its distribution  ( [ eq : diste ] ) deviates from the classical ideal gas in the same manner as does planck s law of radiation from wien s law .",

    "he then stipulates that both volumes be separated from each other by some kind of membrane which can be penetrated only by particles with an energy in a certain infinitesimal range @xmath137 , and quantifies the ensuing fluctuation @xmath173 of the number of particles in  @xmath34 , not admitting energy exchange between particles in different energy intervals .",

    "specific experimental conditions determine which statistics should be applied to describe a particular system . in view of the present experimental status",

    "magnetic or optical confinement suggests that the system is also thermally isolated and , hence , the theory of the trapped condensate based on a microcanonical ensemble is needed . in this microcanonical ensemble the total particle number and the total energy are both exactly conserved , i.e. , the corresponding operators are constrained to be the @xmath37-number constants , @xmath203 and @xmath204 . on the other hand , in experiments with two ( or many ) component becs , bose - fermi mixtures , and additional gas components , e.g. , for sympathetic cooling",
    ", there is an energy exchange between the components . as a result ,",
    "each of the components can be described by the canonical ensemble that applies to systems with conserved particle number while exchanging energy with a heat bath of a given temperature .",
    "such a description is also appropriate for dilute @xmath205he in a porous medium @xcite . in the canonical ensemble",
    "only the total number of particles is constrained to be an exact , non - fluctuating constant , @xmath206 but the energy @xmath207 has non - zero fluctuations , @xmath208 , and only its average value is a constant , @xmath209 , determined by a fixed temperature @xmath11 of the system .    however , the microcanonical and canonical descriptions of a many - body system are difficult because of the operator constraints imposed on the total energy and particle number . as a result ,",
    "the standard textbook formulation of the bec problem assumes either a grand canonical ensemble ( describing a system which is allowed to exchange both energy and particles with a reservoir at a given temperature @xmath11 and chemical potential @xmath210 , which fix only the average total number of particles , @xmath211 , and the average total energy @xmath212 ) or some restricted ensemble that selects states so as to ensure a condensate wave function with an almost fixed phase and amplitude @xcite .",
    "these standard formulations focus on and provide effective tools for the study of the thermodynamic and hydrodynamic properties of the many - body bose system at the expense of an artificial modification of the condensate statistics and dynamics of bec formation . while the textbook grand canonical prediction of the condensate mean occupation agrees , in some sense , with the bose - einstein condensation of trapped atomic gases , this is not even approximately true as concerns the grand canonical counting statistics @xmath213 which gives the probability to find @xmath214 particles in a given single - particle state @xmath42 , where the mean occupation is @xmath215 . below the bose - einstein condensation temperature , where the ground state mean - occupation number is macroscopic , @xmath216 ,",
    "the distribution @xmath217 becomes extremely broad with the squared variance @xmath218 even at @xmath192  @xcite .",
    "this prediction is surely at odds with the isolated bose gas , where for sufficiently low temperature all particles are expected to occupy the ground state with no fluctuations left .",
    "it was argued by ziff et al .",
    "@xcite that this unphysical behavior of the variance is just a mathematical artefact of the standard grand canonical ensemble , which becomes unphysical below the condensation point .",
    "thus , the grand canonical ensemble is irrelevant to experiment if not revised properly .",
    "another extremity , namely , a complete fixation of the amplitude and phase of the condensate wave function , is unable to address the condensate formation and the fluctuation problems at all .",
    "it was first realized by fierz  @xcite that the canonical ensemble with an exactly fixed total number of particles removes the pathologies of the grand canonical ensemble .",
    "he exploited the fact that the description of bec in a homogeneous ideal bose gas is exactly equivalent to the spherical model of statistical physics , and that the condensate serves as a particle reservoir for the non - condensed phase .",
    "recently bec fluctuations were studied by a number of authors in different statistical ensembles , both in the ideal and interacting bose gases .",
    "the microcanonical treatment of the ground - state fluctuations in a one - dimensional harmonic trap is closely related to the combinatorics of partitioning an integer , opening up an interesting link to number theory  @xcite .",
    "it is worthwhile to compare the counting statistics ( [ gc0 ] ) with the predictions of other statistical ensembles @xcite . for high temperatures , @xmath219",

    "the broad distribution of the grand canonical statistics differs most dramatically from @xmath221 in the canonical and microcanonical statistics , which show a narrow single - peaked distribution around the condensate mean occupation number .",

    "in fact , it is this sharply - peaked statistical distribution which one would naively expect for a bose condensate .",
    "each statistical ensemble is described by a different partition function .",
    "the microcanonical partition function @xmath222 is equal to the number of @xmath1-particle microstates corresponding to a given total energy @xmath94 .",

    "more precisely , for the @xmath223-dimensional power - law traps characterized by an exponent  @xmath224 , as considered later in section  v.c , microcanonical and canonical fluctuations agree in the large-@xmath1 limit when @xmath225 , but the microcanonical fluctuations remain smaller than the canonical ones when @xmath226  @xcite .",
    "thus , in @xmath227 dimensions the homogeneous bose gas falls into the first category , but the harmonically trapped one into the second .",
    "the difference between the fluctuations in these two ensembles is expressed by a formula which is similar in spirit to the one expressing the familiar difference between the heat capacities at constant pressure and at constant volume  @xcite .",
    "the direct numerical computation of the microcanonical partition function becomes very time consuming or not possible for @xmath228 . for @xmath229 , and for large numbers of occupied",
    "excited energy levels , one can invoke , e.g. , the approximate technique based on the saddle - point method , which is widely used in statistical physics  @xcite .",
    "when employing this method , one starts from the known grand canonical partition function and utilizes the saddle - point approximation for extracting its required canonical and microcanonical counterparts , which then yield all desired quantities by taking suitable derivatives .",
    "recently , still another statistical ensemble , the so called maxwell s demon ensemble , has been introduced  @xcite . here",
    ", the system is divided into the condensate and the particles occupying excited states , so that only particle transfer ( without energy exchange ) between these two subsystems is allowed , an idea that had also been exploited by fierz  @xcite and by politzer  @xcite .",
    "this ensemble has been used to obtain an approximate analytical expression for the ground - state bec fluctuations both in the canonical and in the microcanonical ensemble .",
    "the maxwell s demon approximation can be understood on the basis of the canonical - ensemble quasiparticle approach @xcite , which is discussed in section  v , and which is readily generalizable to the case of the interacting bose gas ( see section  vi ) .",
    "it also directly proves that the higher statistical moments for a homogeneous bose gas depend on the particular boundary conditions imposed , even in the thermodynamic limit  @xcite .    the canonical partition function @xmath230 is defined as @xmath231 where the sum runs over all allowed energies , and @xmath232 is the boltzmann constant",

    "the girardeau - arnowitt operators can be interpreted as the creation and annihilation operators of the canonical - ensemble quasiparticles which are essentially different from the standard quasiparticles in the grand canonical ensemble .",

    "the important conclusion is that in most cases the ground - state occupation fluctuations are anomalously large and are not gaussian even in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "previous studies focused mainly on the mean value , @xmath666 , and squared variance , @xmath667 , of the number of condensed atoms  @xcite .",

    "we here show that this is not true even in the thermodynamic limit .",

    "the results of the canonical - ensemble quasiparticle approach are valid for temperatures a little lower than a critical temperature , namely , when the probability of having zero atoms in the ground state of the trap is negligibly small and the higher order effects of the interaction between quasiparticles are not important .",

    "this section is organized as follows : we start with the reduction of the hilbert space and the introduction of the canonical - ensemble quasiparticles appropriate to the canonical - ensemble problem in subsection  a. then , in subsection b , we analytically calculate the characteristic function and all cumulants of the ground - state occupation distribution for the ideal bose gas in a trap with an arbitrary single - particle energy spectrum .",

    "we then proceed to find the condensate density matrix via a solution of the von neumann equation with general initial conditions admitting all possible quantum states of the condensate . in particular , this is a natural way to approach the linewidth problem for the atom laser  @xcite . obviously , this is a complicated problem , especially for the interacting finite - temperature bose gas ; because of the need for an efficient technique to account for the additional correlations introduced by the constraint in such realistic ensembles .",
    "the latter is the origin of the difficulties in the theory of the canonical or microcanonical ensembles ( see discussion in the section iii.a ) . according to  @xcite , a calculation of equilibrium statistical properties using the grand canonical ensemble and",
    "a perturbation series will be impossible since the series will have zero radius of convergence .",
    "one way out of this problem is to develop a technique which would allow us to make calculations in the constrained many - body hilbert space , e.g. , on the basis of the master equation approach as discussed in section iv .",
    "another possibility is to solve for the constraint from the very beginning by a proper reduction of the many - body hilbert space so that we can work with the new , already unconstrained quasiparticles .",

    "the translational invariance requires the superfluid density to be equal to the full density @xmath936 , so that the associated stiffness @xmath992 is independent of the interaction strength .",

    "( [ iii75 ] ) and ( [ iii60 ] ) .",
    "it is important to realize that the anomalously large order - parameter fluctuations and susceptibilities have a simple geometrical nature , related to the fact that the direction of the order parameter is only in a neutral , rather than in a stable equilibrium , and does not violate an overall stability of the system with a broken continuous symmetry at any given temperature below phase transition , @xmath220 . on one hand , on the basis of a well - known relation between the longitudinal susceptibility and the variance @xmath1002 of the order parameter fluctuations , @xmath1003 it is obvious that if the fluctuations are anomalous , i.e. , go as @xmath1004 with @xmath1005 instead of the standard macroscopic thermodynamic scaling @xmath1006 , then the longitudinal susceptibility diverges in the thermodynamic limit @xmath607 as @xmath1007 . on the other hand , the susceptibilities in stable systems should be finite , since otherwise any spontaneous perturbation will result in an infinite response and a transition to another phase .",
    "one could argue ( as it was done in a recent series of papers  @xcite ) that the anomalous fluctuations can not exist since they break the stability condition and make the system unstable .",
    "however , such an argument is not correct .",
    "first of all , the anomalously large transverse susceptibility in the infrared limit @xmath1008 in bogoliubov s @xmath930-theorem ( [ transv - susceptibility ] ) originates from the obvious property of a system with a broken continuous symmetry that it is infinitesimally easy to change the direction of the order parameter and , of course , does not violate stability of the system .",
    "however , it implies anomalously large fluctuations in the direction of the order parameter .",
    "therefore , an anomalously large variance of the fluctuations comes from the fluctuations @xmath1009 , which are perpendicular to the mean value of the order parameter .",
    "this is the key issue .",
    "it means that a longitudinal external field @xmath1010 , that easily rotates these transverse fluctuations towards @xmath1011 when @xmath1012 , will change the longitudinal order parameter by a large increment , @xmath1013 .",
    "it is obvious that this pure geometrical rotation of the order parameter has nothing to do with an instability of the system , but immediately reveals the anomalously large longitudinal susceptibility and relates its value to the anomalous transverse susceptibility and variance of the fluctuations , @xmath1014 this basically geometrical mechanism of an anomalous behavior of constrained systems constitutes an essence of _ the constraint mechanism of the infrared anomalies _ in fluctuations and susceptibilities of the order parameter for all systems with a broken continuous symmetry .",
    "the latter qualitative estimate yields the anomalous scaling of the longitudinal susceptibility discussed above , @xmath1015 with increase of the system size @xmath1016 , eq . ( [ ir - singularity ] ) , since @xmath1017 , and @xmath1018 .",
    "a different question is whether the bose gas in a trap is unstable in the grand canonical ensemble when an actual exchange of atoms with a reservoir is allowed , and only the mean number of atoms in the trap is fixed , @xmath1019 . in this case , for example , the isothermal compressibility is determined by the variance of the number - of - atoms fluctuations @xmath1020 , and diverges in the thermodynamic limit if fluctuations are anomalous . in particular , the ideal bose gas in the grand canonical ensemble does not have a well - defined condensate order parameter , since the variance is of the order of the mean value , @xmath1021 , and it is unstable against a collapse @xcite .    in summary , one could naively expect that the order parameter fluctuations below @xmath3 are just like that of a standard thermodynamic variable , because there is a finite restoring force for deviations from the equilibrium value .",
    "however , in all systems with a broken continuous symmetry the universal existence of infrared singularities in the variance and higher moments ensures anomalously large and non - gaussian fluctuations of the order parameter .",
    "this effect is related to the long - wavelength phase fluctuations and the infrared singularity of the longitudinal susceptibility originating from the inevitable geometrical coupling between longitudinal and transverse order parameter fluctuations in constrained systems .",
    "it is interesting to note that the first results for the average and variance of occupation numbers in the ideal bose gas in the canonical ensemble were obtained about fifty years ago by standard statistical methods  @xcite ( see also @xcite and the review @xcite ) . only later ,",
    "in the 60s , laser physics and its byproduct , the master equation approach , was developed ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in this paper",
    "we have shown that the latter approach provides very simple and effective tools to calculate statistical properties of an ideal bose gas in contact with a thermal reservoir .",

    "this technique for studying statistics and dynamics of bec shows surprisingly good results even within the simplest approximations .",

    "einstein statistics , we give its explicit proof in this appendix .    as for most mathematical proofs , one needs tools , an idea , and a conjurer s trick . in the present case ,",
    "the tools are two generalizations of the binomial theorem @xmath1037 where @xmath1038 denotes the familiar binomial coefficents .",
    "the first such generalization is the _ multinomial theorem _ @xmath1039 which is easily understood : when multiplying out the left - hand side , every product obtained contains one factor @xmath1040 from each bracket @xmath1041 .",
    "hence , in every product @xmath1042 the exponents add up to the number of brackets , which is  @xmath377 .",

    "the second generalization of the binomial theorem  ( [ eq : apbt ] ) required for the proof of the identity  ( [ eq : apci ] ) emerges when we replace the exponent  @xmath377 by a non - natural number  @xmath384 : one then has @xmath1045 with the definition @xmath1046 if @xmath384 is not a natural number , this series  ( [ eq : apgb ] ) converges for any complex numbers @xmath1047 , provided @xmath1048 .",
    "this _ generalized binomial theorem _  ( [ eq : apgb ] ) , which is treated in introductory analysis courses , is useful , _ e.g. _ , for writing down the taylor expansion of @xmath1049 .",
    "given these tools , the idea for proving the identity  ( [ eq : apci ] ) now consists in considering the expression @xmath1050 where @xmath363 is some variable which obeys @xmath1051 , but need not be specified further .",
    "according to the multinomial theorem  ( [ eq : apmt ] ) , one has @xmath1052 directing the attention then to a systematic ordering of this series with respect to powers of  @xmath363 , the coefficient of @xmath1053 equals the sum of all coefficients encountered here which accompany terms with @xmath148 , which is precisely the left - hand side of the desired equation  ( [ eq : apci ] ) , keeping in mind the restrictions  ( [ eq : apr1 ] ) and  ( [ eq : apr2 ] ) .",
    "now comes the conjurer s trick : the coefficient of @xmath1053 in this expression  ( [ eq : apnz ] ) , equaling the left - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : apci ] ) , also equals the coefficent of @xmath1053 in the expression @xmath1054 since this differs from @xmath1055 only by powers of  @xmath363 higher than  @xmath1 . but",
    "this involves a geometric series , which is immediately summed : @xmath1056 according to the generalized binomial theorem  ( [ eq : apgb ] ) , one has @xmath1057 so that , in view of the definition  ( [ eq : apdf ] ) , the coefficient of  @xmath1053 equals @xmath1058 this is the right - hand side of the identity  ( [ eq : apci ] ) , which completes the proof .",
