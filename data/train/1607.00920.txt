    "in many situations the motion of electrons in matter is well described by compact effective hamiltonians treating only quasiparticles near the fermi surface of the material .",
    "historical examples of such hamiltonians include the luttinger - kohn and kane models for iii - v semiconductors@xcite , and the effective dirac equation for iv - vi semi - conductors@xcite .",
    "perhaps the most famous example of an effective hamiltonian is the dirac - weyl equation which in particle physics describes massless neutrinos , but in condensed matter governs the low energy quasi - particles of graphene , a two dimensional honeycomb lattice of carbon .",
    "this description of graphene provides both great insight into the physics of this remarkable material , as well as a framework in which electronic effects from the large length scale deformations that this 2d membrane is subject to , for example flexural rippling , can be efficiently calculated .    the experimental fabrication of graphene in 2004@xcite",
    "can now be seen a heralding the emergence of a new science of low dimensional materials@xcite .",
    "such materials include both close cousins of graphene , for example the bernal stacked@xcite or twist bilayer graphenes@xcite , as well as more distant relatives in the form of complex all carbon allotropes@xcite or silicene@xcite .",
    "recently , attention has started to focus on interesting non - carbon low dimensional materials such as the layered transition metal dichalcogenides@xcite , for example mos@xmath2 , mose@xmath2 , and cucl .",
    "it might have been expected that the emergence of this multitude of new low dimensional materials would have been accompanied by the development of a range of effective hamiltonians , offering comparable power and insight to the dirac - weyl hamiltonian in the case of graphene , however this has not proven to be the case .",
    "a principle reason for this is that the @xmath0 method , a tool that has proved profoundly useful in the context of high symmetry three dimensional materials@xcite , is both technically more difficult to apply in the reduced symmetry situations often found in low dimensional materials as well as , more importantly , being quite incapable of treating the _ non - perturbative _ structural deformations that such materials are often subject to . as an example of such a deformation consider a twist fault in bernal stacked graphene bilayer .",
    "a small mutual rotation of the layers generates a moir within which all stacking types are present and , therefore , a system that can not be considered a small structural perturbation of the bernal bilayer .",
    "while the @xmath0 theory is formally applicable to such a case , it will result in a large and non - intuitive hamiltonian , thus negating the principle advantages of the method .",
    "the weak interlayer bonding inherent to the emerging class of van der walls bonded few layer systems@xcite makes such non - perturbation interlayer deformations - of which there are a rich variety e.g. twist faults and partial dislocations to name just two - likely to be the generic case@xcite . as such deformations exist on length scales that render conventional electronic structure approaches prohibitive there is an urgent need for an effective theory by which they may be treated .    in this paper",
    "we present a general method that goes beyond @xmath0 theory in that for both high and no symmetry situations , as well as for perturbative and non - perturbative deformations , it yields compact and physically transparent effective hamiltonians with equal ease .",
    "our approach is based on the surprising fact that , as we will show , there exists an exact map from the two centre tight - binding hamiltonian to a compact continuum effective hamiltonian .",
    "we deploy this method on three standout problems in the field of low dimensional materials : ( i ) effective hamiltonians for the complex carbon allotropes@xcite ( ii ) a systematic treatment of deformations in single layer graphene , and ( iii ) and a general theory of interlayer deformations in bilayer systems .",
    "the first two of these problems are cases of high symmetry 2d systems and their perturbative deformations , and an application of the method we present here to this general problem results in a formalism valid for all 2d materials .",
    "the structure of this theory is based around a rather simple _ connection formula _ that relates the sublattice space of the crystal to the pseudospin space of the effective hamiltonian . in conjunction with a set of _ universal functions _ composed the basic variables of the problem , the position and momentum operators and the deformation tensor , this results in a very efficient scheme for treating the general case of 2d materials under weak ( or no ) structural perturbation . to demonstrate this we consider a number of all - carbon 2d allotropes : graphene , graphdiyne , @xmath1-graphyne , and 6,6,12-graphyne . in each case",
    "we provide both an effective hamiltonian for the high symmetry phase , as well as , in the case of graphene and graphdiyine , the corrections that arise from arbitrary deformations ( with the proviso that the deformation is slow on the scale of the lattice constant ) .    to the case of deformations in graphene , which has attracted enormous attention in the literature@xcite",
    ", we devote particular attention .",
    "we provide a systematic expansion in terms of the momentum operator and the deformation field , recovering all known results from the literature as well as several extensions .",
    "these are ( i ) an imaginary scalar potential that is the @xmath3 partner of the very interesting imaginary geometric gauge first reported in ref .  , ( ii ) trigonal warping corrections due to the deformation ( terms quadratic in momentum and linear in the deformation tensor ) , and ( iii ) scaler , gauge potentials , and fermi velocity renormalization due to second order in the deformation tensor .",
    "we show that such higher order terms are , perhaps surprisingly , essential for the effective hamiltonian approach to agree with corresponding tight - binding calculations , but that if they are included the agreement is almost perfect .",
    "we pay particular attention to the question of hermiticity , showing that the effective hamiltonian remain hermitian up to second order derivatives of the deformation tensor . for deformations stronger than this the emergent pseudospin degree of freedom",
    "is itself destroyed by the deformation , and the dirac - weyl framework no longer can provide an adequate description of the deformed material . for the more complex 2d allotropes the same formalism yields rather different physics , and in the case of graphdiyne ( the only complex carbon allotropes thus far to have apparently been experimentally synthesized@xcite ) we find a low energy dirac equation describes the high symmetry state , with deformations entering as a complex gap function field .",
    "our second primary example of the theory is provided by interlayer deformations in bilayer graphene .",
    "it is striking that despite the intense study of stacking defects in this material , for instance rotational faults@xcite and partial dislocations@xcite , there exists _ no general theory of interlayer deformations comparable to that for deformations in single layer graphene_. in other words , a theory that relates an arbitrary stacking deformation to an effective hamiltonian , in the way that the dirac - weyl hamiltonian is linked to arbitrary deformations in single layer graphene via a deformation induced gauge field .",
    "the underlying reason for the absence of such a general theory is that this problem represents an example of a non - perturbative deformation for which @xmath0 theory fails .",
    "an application of the method presented here , however , immediately yields a general description from which , for the case of bilayer graphene , the well known hamiltonians of the bernal and twist bilayers emerge as special cases .    deploying this general formalism we study , as a final example , partial dislocation networks in bilayer graphene recently reported in tem images@xcite and already shown to have a significant impact on transport in these materials@xcite . as an example of the power of the effective hamiltonian approach we consider an experimentally derived system ( taken from tem images of bilayer graphene grown on the si - face of sic ) consisting of the order of @xmath4 carbon atoms which",
    ", it goes without saying , could not be calculated by any other method .",
    "we find that partial dislocations are associated with localized current carrying states , with the current density propagating with both intralayer and interlayer components along the partials .",
    "interestingly , different types of partial dislocations ( there are just three partial burgers vectors for bilayer graphene ) develop these current carrying localized states at different energies , and this is independent of the network geometry .",
    "finally , near the dirac point we find a strong charge inhomogeneity in the form of charge pooling on the different segments of the mosaic of ab and ac stacked domains , a phenomena recently treated in ref .   using a preliminary version of the theory presented in this manuscript .",
    "the aim of this section is to demonstrate a general mapping between the two - centre tight - binding method and a continuum hamiltonian , i.e. , one involving only position @xmath5 and momentum @xmath6 operators .",
    "( in this section it will prove notationally advantageous to explicitly denote operators , an approach that we do not use in the remainder of the paper . )",
    "we begin with a standard two centre tight binding hamiltonian    @xmath7    which is assumed to describe a system that is close to some high symmetry system @xmath8 in that @xmath8 could be structurally deformed to create @xmath9 , the system of interest .",
    "the sense in which this high symmetry system is `` close to '' @xmath9 will presently be made clear . as a basis for the solution of @xmath9 we take the bloch states of the high symmetry @xmath8 system , which are    @xmath10    where @xmath11 are the localized tight - binding orbitals in which @xmath12 denotes a lattice site and @xmath13 a basis site .",
    "other possible atomic labels , such as angular momentum or spin variables , are suppressed into the @xmath14 label .",
    "we now consider an unknown hamiltonian @xmath15 that acts on a basis of free particle states    @xmath16    where @xmath17 is the crystal momentum measured from some expansion point @xmath18 in the brillouin zone of @xmath8 .",
    "this will play a similar role to the expansion point in @xmath0 theory , i.e. , this is the point in the brillouin zone at which there exists some low energy spectrum of interest , for example in the case of graphene @xmath18 would be one of the high symmetry @xmath19 points .",
    "the vector @xmath20 describes a general pseudospin degree of freedom and is defined as @xmath21_i = \\delta_{i\\alpha}$ ] . taking again graphene as an example these would be the pseudospin up , @xmath22 , and pseudospin down , @xmath23 , vectors .",
    "we now require @xmath15 to be the operator equivalent of @xmath9 :    @xmath24    this equation contains only one unknown , the effective continuum hamiltonian @xmath15",
    ". our strategy will be to derive an exact form for this hamiltonian by manipulating this operator equivalence expression .",
    "the left hand side of eq .",
    "( [ hequiv ] ) is given by    @xmath25    where    @xmath26    with @xmath27 the electron hopping between position @xmath28 on sublattice @xmath14 and position @xmath29 on sublattice @xmath30 .",
    "note that these two spatial variables are very different in nature : @xmath28 is a position in the lattice while @xmath31 describes a hopping vector from point @xmath28 .",
    "we now introduce the fourier transform of this hopping function    @xmath32    ( where @xmath33 the dimension of space ) into eq .",

    "@xmath48 is defined as    @xmath49    note also that the sum is taken over the _ translation group of the expansion point of the high symmetry reference system _ : @xmath50 .",
    "this is very different in character from @xmath0 theory in which it is the point group that plays the central role .    noting that    @xmath51_{\\alpha\\beta}\\ ] ]    we then",

    "when the hamiltonian eq .",
    "acts to the right on the ket @xmath56 the operator equivalence equation @xmath57 is satisfied ( to see this we may simply reverse the steps leading to eq .   to go from @xmath58 back to the tight - binding matrix element ) .",
    "this equation is the central result of this section and proves that under the assumption @xmath59 there exists a direct map between the two - centre tight - binding method and a continuum description .",
    "the operator @xmath15 must , of course , satisfy associativity and hermiticity .",
    "the former implies that @xmath60 must also equal eq .",
    "( [ dur ] ) which is easily proved by repeating the derivation using the second of the two equivalent forms of the real space hopping function , eq .  .    the central object in eq .",
    "is the mixed space hopping function @xmath48 , and how to obtain this holds the key to applicability of method .",
    "for intrinsically perturbative cases , such as a lattice deformation , @xmath48 is obtained by taylor expansion with respect to the small parameter of the deformation ( the strain tensor ) as we will show in the next section .",
    "however , for non - perturbative cases , such as twist faults and partial dislocations in bilayer systems , @xmath48 can , crucially , be obtained non - perturbatively ( section iv ) .",
    "we close this section with an examination of the conditions under which the effective hamiltonian @xmath15 is hermitian .",
    "evidently , the hermiticity requirements of this object must be much stronger than those of the underlying tight - binding theory : while the tight binding hamiltonian @xmath9 is always hermitian if , for example , we attempted to find an effective hamiltonian for amorphous carbon using the diamond structure as the high symmetry reference state , we would not expect the method to work , and this would be revealed by the effective hamiltonian not being hermitian . for hermiticity of @xmath15",
    "we require    @xmath52_{\\alpha\\beta } = \\left[h({\\hat{\\bf r}},{\\hat{\\bf p}})\\right]_{\\beta\\alpha}^\\ast\\ ] ]    which , since @xmath61_{\\alpha\\beta } = \\left[m_i\\right]_{\\beta\\alpha}^\\ast$ ] , implies @xmath62 .",
    "this in turn implies that for the real space hopping function we must have    @xmath63    hopping between sites on sublattices @xmath14 and @xmath30 in the high symmetry reference state defines a bravais lattice that , as all bravais lattices must , possesses inversion symmetry .",
    "equation then states that this property must , within the range of the electron hopping for which @xmath27 is non - zero , hold _ at each point @xmath28 of the lattice after deformation_. in other words , the sublattice structure of the high symmetry crystal must hold good as a local description of the crystal after deformation for the effective hamiltonian @xmath15 to be hermitian .",
    "this is different to @xmath0 theory in which the reference state must , for a useful @xmath0 hamiltonian to be obtained , be _ globally _ close to the system of interest .",
    "this difference between local and global closeness is , as we will see , one of the key reasons behind the usefulness of the approach we espouse here .",
    "in this section we will treat the case of deformations in 2d materials , in which the deformation is slowly varying on the scale of the lattice constant .",
    "we will consider systems that , within a minimal basis tight - binding scheme , can be treated as having a single orbital per site ; this includes all the 2d carbon allotropes .",
    "based on a perturbative approach we will , beginning from eq .",
    ", derive a theory of deformations ( of which obviously no deformation is a special case ) applicable to _ all _ such 2d materials .",
    "we will then deploy this theory to determine the ( i ) effective hamiltonians of a range 2d carbon allotropes and ( ii ) a theory of deformations in single layer graphene .",
    "generalizations of this theory to 3d and more than one orbital per site are straightforward , but will not be given here .",
    ".coefficients @xmath64 that arise in the taylor expansion of the tight - binding hopping function due to a deformation field @xmath65 applied to a two dimensional material , see eq .   of the text . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      the twist bilayer represents a system with a simple structural variable , the rotation angle @xmath66 , that nevertheless encompasses a very broad range of electronic structure phenomena@xcite .",
    "there are essentially two quite distinct regimes : at large @xmath66 the layers are electronically decoupled , while at small @xmath66 the layers strongly couple resulting in a novel low energy electronic structure that features : ( i ) charge localization on aa stacked regions of the emergent moir lattice@xcite and ( ii ) an extraordinarily rich series of changes in the fermi surface topology as a function of energy@xcite . the _ diverging _ size of the moir lattice unit cell as @xmath67 implies that all atomistic based approaches will ultimately fail in this limit , as well as indicating a natural role for a continuum approach in which the lattice is replaced by some @xmath28-dependent moir field .",
    "just such a hamiltonian was derived in ref .",
    "that , however , was subsequently shown to agree with tight - binding calculations only after rescaling@xcite .",
    "this has been attributed to the use of an incorrect momentum scale on which the single layer states couple , and indeed a revised hamiltonian , which has an identical form but with a different momentum scale , has been shown to yield almost perfect agreement with tight - binding calculations@xcite . in this section",
    "we will derive _ both _ of these hamiltonians and their associated momentum scales as special cases of the theory of section [ st ] . as we will see , contrary to the suspicion evoked in recent papers that the hamiltonian of ref .",
    "is in some way in error , it turns out that both of these effective hamiltonians are equivalent provided they are deployed in conjunction with the correct basis .",
    "we will first consider the hamiltonian of bistritzer _ et al . _ which we will show to be simply a special case of the general interlayer field @xmath68 , eq .  .",

    "it is also striking , and was noted by the original authors , that the coupling momentum of the exponential , @xmath82 , generates a real space moir field that _ does not have the periodicity of the real space moir lattice _ - the period of @xmath83 is @xmath84 times greater than that of the moir .",

    "but instead by    @xmath93    this is exactly the form of the moir field derived by weckbecker _",

    "the reason that these two effective hamiltonians will , as they must , yield the same electronic structure is simply that they are evaluated in each case with a different basis : eq .   must be evaluated in a basis of rotated single layer graphene states , whereas eq .",
    "must be evaluated using a basis of unrotated single layer states from the unrotated layer , and rotated single layer states from the rotated layer ( this is clearly seen by inspection of the relevant matrix elements that @xmath83 is exacted from in each case ) .",
    "both approaches are , therefore , correct , and the unusual mismatch between the translational symmetry of the continuum and lattice hamiltonians found in the approach of ref .",
    "may be removed , in this case , simply by changing to a `` more natural '' basis in which the single layer states follow the rotational geometry of the bilayer ( i.e. , basis states from the unrotated layer are unrotated single layer states , and from the rotated layer are rotated single layer states ) .",
    "that arises from the 3-fold nature of the general interlayer stacking potential , see section [ shift ] . ]",
    "the bernal ( ab ) stacked graphene bilayer is generally assumed - with the exception of possible point defects - to be structurally perfect .",
    "recently , this has been shown not to be the case , and tem images of the bilayer ( grown by sublimation of si from the si - face of sic ) have been shown to exhibit a dense network of partial dislocations@xcite .",
    "these arise because of a hidden structural degeneracy in the bilayer : there are two equivalent stacking choices , conventionally referred to as ab and ac stacking . in an infinite crystal",
    "these are , of course , physically equivalent , however they may also coexist as domains in a single crystal , at which point they become physically distinct .",
    "the requirement of an continuous graphene membrane in each layer then leads to the condition that such domains be connected by one of three possible partial burgers vectors @xmath97 , @xmath98 , and @xmath99 , shown in fig .",

    "if all partial dislocations extended through the sample , this would not cause any complication , however the annihilation of partial dislocations at point defects in the lattice leads to a certain complexity in the phase structure of the network .",
    "this can most clearly be seen by imagining an ac stacked island bounded by partials that annihilate at two point dislocations in the lattice , a geometry that can in fact be seen in fig .",

    "it was assumed that the point defects that create and annihilate partial dislocations also create and annihilate a phase contribution to the stacking phase of the hamiltonian , and with this assumption the phase structure can be mapped out over the partial network , as shown in fig .

    "above the dirac point this switches to a charge accumulation associated with type 2 partials , see panel ( d ) .",
    "close to the dirac point , see panels ( b ) and ( c ) , one also notices a substantial charge pooling as some segments of the mosaic network have significantly higher density than others , a point first noticed in ref .  .",
    "for the energy window of + 90mev , shown in panel ( d ) , the pronounced charge pooling seen near the dirac point is absent , although one still notes substantial density inhomogeneity .    how much of this structure , and in particular the existence of `` hot '' partials on which density is accumulated , is related to the specific partial network shown in fig .",
    "[ expd ] ? to investigate this we consider an designed hexagonal network of partial dislocations shown in fig .",
    "we introduce some random disorder into the partials such that they are not perfectly straight , however all partials are now non - terminating ( the area shown is periodically repeated ) and the problems with mapping the phase structure of the experimental network do not exist . in fig .",
    "[ hexi ] we show the phase structure for this network .    ) which features creation and annihilation of partials and has a very complex phase structure , the phase field here is a simple periodic tiling .",
    "the partial burgers vector associated with each partial dislocation type is illustrated in panel ( b ) of fig .",
    "[ expi ] . ]    . ]    as may be observed in fig .",
    "[ hexd ] , qualitatively similar features are seen to those noted in the experimental partial network - in particular the energy order in which the type 3 and 2 partials become `` hot '' and accumulate charge is the same ; the type 1 partial also , as before , does not accumulate charge .",
    "this charge accumulation is therefore largely independent of the global details of partial network and rather is a consequence of the local partial structure .",
    "a number of features that are difficult to detect in the experimental network may be seen much more clearly in this designed network , in particular the localization of charge on the nodes of the network is much more pronounced , see panel ( d ) of fig .",
    "[ hexd ] .    , especially panel ( c ) . both interlayer currents , panel ( c ) , associated with the partial as well as strong intralayer currents ,",
    "see panels ( a ) and ( b ) , can be observed .",
    "note that this calculation is performed in the absence of a magnetic field and therefore integrating all states ( up to the fermi energy ) will result in zero net current . ]",
    "finally we examine the nature of these localized states on the partial dislocations .",
    "one might imagine that these could represent current carrying states , similar to those recently observed in experiment@xcite ( although note that as we have no magnetic field the overall current will be zero , and a finite current found only by a restricted integration over eigenstates . ) .",
    "shown in fig .",
    "[ hexj](a - c ) is both the intralayer as well as interlayer current density integrated over states indicated in energy window in fig .",
    "[ hexj](d ) .",
    "interestingly , one notes that the ( type 2 ) partials are associated with both in - plane currents , which flow from left to right in fig .",
    "[ hexj ] , and _ interlayer _ currents and thus the charge accumulation on partials seen in the previous section indeed represents current carrying states .",
    "the formalism used for the current calculations ( which is a simple extension of that presented in section ii ) we will , due to lack of space , expound in a subsequent publication .",
    "_ discussion _ : we have presented a theory that goes substantially beyond the @xmath0 method in its capability for generating effective hamiltonians .",
    "this enhanced applicability derives from two primary differences with @xmath0 theory .",
    "firstly , the approach relies on local and not global closeness to a reference state , in the sense that if the pseudospin structure of the reference state provides a good local description of the system of interest , then the method will work .",
    "this allows the generation of compact and physically intuitive effective hamiltonians even when , globally , the system of interest is dramatically different from the reference state .",
    "secondly , instead of individual optical matrix elements forming the unknown constants of the theory to be fitted , it is the tight - binding hopping function that constitutes the basic unknown object .",
    "this sharply reduces the number of variables to be fitted , in particular for systems with very low ( or no ) symmetry , as well as for systems that require high orders in momentum or deformation tensor for an accurate description .",
    "the first of these differences with @xmath0 theory is highlighted by two examples presented in this work , the twist bilayer and partial dislocation networks .",
    "these materials , both structurally and electronically , are profoundly different from the reference state from which they are derived , the ab stacked bilayer , yet in both cases the method we employ here provides a compact and intuitive effective hamiltonian description . the ability to treat this type of non - perturbative deformation , exemplified by the interlayer ( i.e. stacking ) degree of freedom , will be important for the emerging class of low dimensional van der waals heterostructures in which the weakly bonded layers are likely highly susceptible to such stacking deformations@xcite .",
    "in contrast to three dimensional materials , charge carriers in two dimensions can not avoid stacking defects that extend throughout the sample , e.g. partial dislocations , and their impact on electronic properties is , therefore , expected to be profound . indeed , this has recently been observed in the case of bilayer graphene@xcite , and one wonders what the impact of stacking deformations will be on the excitonic properties of the few layer dichalcogenides , for example .",
    "this represents a new materials paradigm in which extended defects , that play almost no electronic role in three dimensional materials although a crucial role in mechanical strength , represent an important ingredient in understanding the electronic structure of weakly bonded few layer materials .",
    "this makes all the more desirable a general method effective hamiltonian method by which they may be treated , in particular as the length scales in involved in such defects render prohibitive conventional atomistic approaches .",
    "_ summary _ : we have applied our theory to the case of perturbative deformations in 2d materials that are slow on the scale of the lattice constant . in this case",
    "the structure of the theory consists of a connection formula linking lattice and pseudospin spaces that , together with _ universal _",
    "polynomials formed from the basic variables of the theory ( the momentum operator and deformation tensor ) , generate effective hamiltonians for any 2d system , both for the high symmetry phase as well as providing a systematic treatment of corrections due to deformations .",
    "we deploy this method for the case of deformations in graphene , and are able to encompass all known results from the literature , as well as providing several extensions that we show together results in almost perfect agreement with tight - binding calculations for the test case of strained graphene .",
    "these extensions include both higher order fields in momentum and the deformation tensor , as well as a companion scalar field to the remarkable geometric gauge first reported in ref .",
    "( both the scalar and vector geometric fields are pure imaginary but , as we show , preserve the hermiticity of the effective dirac - weyl theory ) .",
    "application to a selection of more complex all carbon 2d allotropes - we consider graphdiyne , @xmath1-graphyne , and 6,6,12-graphyne - yields effective hamiltonians both for the high symmetry state as well as for arbitrary ( slow ) deformations , a formalism ideal for treating the electron - phonon interaction in these materials . for graphdiyne , which we use as an explicit example ,",
    "the effective hamiltonian turns out simply to be the dirac equation , with deformations entering as a complex gap field such that positive biaxial strain opens the gap , while uniaxial positive or biaxial negative strain closes the gap .",
    "application of the theory to the case of a bilayer geometry leads directly to the construction of a general interlayer ( matrix valued ) effective field that provides a continuum description of an arbitrary bilayer system subject to _ any stacking deformation_. this interlayer field is , therefore , the equivalent in generality of the deformation induced effective gauge field that allow one to treat arbitrary in - plane deformations in the case of single layer graphene . for bilayer graphene this interlayer field is shown to yield both the well known twist bilayer hamiltonian , and a hamiltonian describing partial dislocations in the ab bilayer , simply as special cases .",
    "for the twist bilayer we find ( i ) a generalization from pure twist to a general linear transformation ( i.e. , including both possible shear and strain as well as twist ) and ( ii ) resolve a discrepancy between different effective hamiltonians that have appeared in the literature@xcite . for the case of partial dislocations we present calculations of both realistic and designed partial networks uncovering interesting charge localization effects on the mosaic geometry , in particular charge accumulation on partial dislocations and , near the dirac point , charge pooling on the mosaic segments .",
    "the charge accumulation on partials appears to be burger vector specific in a generic way : for both the experimental and designed partial networks the accumulation occurs at specific energies for specific burgers vectors .",
    "these charge accumulation states are shown to carry current along the partials which has both an in - plane as well as an interlayer component .    to summarize , the method yields , as we have demonstrated in numerous examples , compact and physically intuitive effective hamiltonians even for the very complex low symmetry situations that occur in low dimensional materials .",
    "as this class of materials continuous to grow apace , the theory may provide a very useful tool for investigating their electronic structure , comparable in impact to the usefulness of @xmath0 theory for three dimensional materials .",
    "a cornucopia of further applications can easily be imagined : the electronic structure and excitonic physics of the ( probably unavoidable ) dislocations and stacking faults in mos@xmath2 and other layered dichalcogenides , deformations fast on the scale of the lattice constant important e.g. in silicene structures and highly strained graphene - metal hybrids , and twist faults in complex carbon allotropes .",
    "furthermore , the extension to a three dimensional and multi - orbital case will allow for the easy generation of effective hamiltonians to describe even the most complex topological insulators .",
    "this work was supported by the collaborative research center sfb 953 of the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft ( dfg ) .",
    "we would also like to thank m. oliva - leyva for a useful prompt based on his reading of a draft version of this paper ."
