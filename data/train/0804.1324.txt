    "since the discovery of superconductivity in the quaternary oxy - pnictides laofep @xcite and laonip @xcite , a new family of high-@xmath3 superconductors featured with iron - based layered structure are emerging @xcite .",
    "non - conventional superconducting mechanism has been proposed based on the tunneling spectroscopy@xcite , thermodynamics measurements@xcite , and the first - principle calculation @xcite .",
    "the recent band structure calculation indicates the fermi surface ( fs ) of lao@xmath0f@xmath1feas has five sheets @xcite : two cylinders associated with electron type around the zone edge @xmath7-@xmath8 line of the brillouin zone , two hole - like cylinders along the @xmath9-@xmath10 line , and a hole - like closed pocket centered at @xmath10 point .",
    "the calculations also indicate that laofeas is basically characterized as low density electron carriers doped on top of a band insulator with filled d@xmath11 valence orbitals @xcite .",
    "f doping can reduce the hole - like sheet and enhance the electron - like fs .",
    "hall effect measurements@xcite have confirmed the electron - type conductivity with a charge carrier density as low as @xmath12@xmath13 for f doped systems , even lower than that of high-@xmath3 cuprates .",
    "the low dimensionality and low charge carrier density in this system remind us of the analogy to high-@xmath3 cuprates .",
    "hence the superfluid density @xmath14 in this system should be also very small compared to typical metal or alloy superconductors .",
    "it has been proposed that the small superfluid density results in a small phase stiffness energy and the meissner state is readily destroyed by the strong phase fluctuations @xcite . in the case of high-@xmath3 cuprates",
    ", the correlation between the @xmath3 and superfluid density demonstrated by the so - called `` uemura plot '' @xcite strongly implies such a phase disorder scenario in which the superconducting transition at @xmath3 is driven by the loss of long - range phase coherence rather than `` gap closing '' .",
    "furthermore , persistence of enhanced nernst signals due to the vortex excitations at temperatures rather high above @xmath3 provides strong evidence for the spontaneous appearance of vortex excitations above @xmath3@xcite .",
    "the nernst effect is a magneto - thermoelectric effect , defined as the appearance of a transverse electric field @xmath15 in response to a temperature gradient @xmath16 , in the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field @xmath17 and under open circuit conditions .",
    "the nernst effect is usually small in usual metals because of the so - called `` sondheimer cancellation''@xcite .",
    "it is known that the magnetic ordering and spin fluctuations can cause enhanced nernst signals @xcite . for a type - ii superconductor ( in the vortex - liquid state ) , vortices can be driven down by the temperature gradient with velocity @xmath18 along the @xmath19-axis direction .",
    "moving vortices can produce a transverse electric field according to the josephson equation : @xmath20 , which is also called vortex nernst effect .",
    "thus the vortex nernst effect is a highly sensitive probe to detecting vortex motion .    here",
    "we report the first nernst effect measurement on the newly - discovered iron - based superconductor lao@xmath0f@xmath1feas@xmath21 . a broad regime below @xmath3 featured by large positive vortex nernst signal",
    "is observed , which indicates that the flux flowing regime is quite large compared to conventional type - ii superconductors .",
    "however , a clear anomalous depression of off - diagonal thermoelectric current below @xmath6 k in the normal state is observed and its origin is discussed .",
    "the polycrystalline samples were prepared by the solid state reaction using laas , fe@xmath22o@xmath23 , fe and laf@xmath23 as starting materials .",
    "the sample preparation details can be found in ref.[4 ] .",
    "the powder x - ray diffraction patterns indicate that the resultant is single phase and all the diffraction peaks can be well indexed based on the tetragonal zrcusias - type structure with the space group p4/nmm .",
    "the structure characterization was reported in ref . [ 4 ] .",
    "the nominal composition is lao@xmath24f@xmath25feas according to the starting materials .",
    "the resistivity measurement shows a sharp superconducting transition and @xmath3 ( the onset temperature in the resistive transition ) is @xmath26 k. the residual resistance ratio ( rrr ) which is defined as @xmath27(300 k)/@xmath27(28 k ) is 11.6 , indicating a good sample quality .",
    "the hall effect was measured by scanning magnetic field at fixed temperatures .",
    "the thermoelectric properties were measured by a steady - state technique .",
    "the temperature gradient used for the thermoelectric measurements , determined by a pair of differential type e thermocouples , was around @xmath28 k / mm .",
    "all the measurements were performed in a quantum design ppms-@xmath29 system . the nernst signal @xmath30 is defined as @xmath31 .",
    "nernst signal was measured at positive and negative field polarities , and the difference of the two polarities was taken to remove any thermopower contribution .",
    "traces of nernst signal as a function of magnetic field up to @xmath32@xmath33 of 8 t is displayed in figure 1 at various temperatures . above @xmath3 of about @xmath26 k , the nernst signal ( @xmath30 )",
    "is negative , small , and linear as a function of magnetic field .",
    "below @xmath3 , the magnitude of the nernst signal increases sharply , and becomes nonlinear with magnetic field , which exhibits a typical feature of vortex nernst signal . at @xmath34",
    "k , vortices form a solid lattice and are pinned so that the vortex nernst signal is nearly zero . at @xmath35 and @xmath36",
    "k , the vortex lattice melts at a certain magnetic field @xmath37 and vortex nernst signals appears for @xmath38 . for @xmath39 k ,",
    "such a melting transition of vortex lattice is no longer observed just because solid vortex lattice does not form due to thermal fluctuations .",
    "probably because of the polycrystalline sample , the vortex motion is not uniform and enhanced noises are observed which might be caused by the vortex jumping .",
    "it is interesting that the traces of the vortex nernst signals below @xmath3 are similar to these of high-@xmath3 cuprates , i.e. , the vortex liquid state regime is quite large and the solid vortex lattice is hard to form .",
    "another surprising feature is that the depairing magnetic field @xmath4 can not be defined in the @xmath30 vs @xmath33 curves even for temperatures near @xmath3 .",
    "the magnetoresistance measurement performed on the same batch of lao@xmath0f@xmath40feas ( @xmath19=0.1 ) samples was reported in ref.[4 ] and @xmath41 was determined from the onset transition of resistance for temperatures close to @xmath5 .",
    "@xmath42 was estimated to be about 55 t and @xmath41 drops down to zero quickly when @xmath43 approaches @xmath44 .",
    "however , the nernst effect study indicates that @xmath4 might not drop to zero at @xmath3 and superconducting transition could be driven by the loss of long - range phase coherence of cooper pairs , just as the case in the high-@xmath3 superconducting cuprates @xcite .",
    "such a behavior is contrast to conventional layered superconductors such as nbse@xmath22@xcite .",
    "the temperature dependence of nernst coefficient , @xmath45 , together with its resistivity , @xmath46 , is shown in figure 2 .",
    "the nernst coefficient is defined as the initial slope of @xmath30-@xmath33 curves for @xmath47 .",
    "the normal state nernst coefficient is very small and shows weak temperature dependence .",
    "however @xmath48 starts to increase below 50 k , change sign just above @xmath3 , and then shows a step - like sharp increase at @xmath3 . below @xmath3 , it reaches a peak around 15 k. the peak value is around 0.10@xmath49v / kt , smaller than vortex nernst signal observed in high- @xmath3 superconductors , probably because of the polycrystalline sample in this study . the sharp increase in @xmath50 occurrs at @xmath3 , in contrast to the smooth change of @xmath45 at @xmath3 in high- @xmath3 superconductors .",
    "however , for @xmath43 as high as 50 k above @xmath3 , @xmath45 already starts to deviate from the negative background and increase gently . in high- @xmath3 cuprates ,",
    "a similar enhancement of nernst signal has already been observed and it has been interpreted as the evidence for vortex excitations above @xmath3 . a phase disorder scenario based on the nernst effect measurements is proposed for high-@xmath3 cuprates @xcite . because this iron - based new superconductors share the similarity in the low dimensionality and low superfluid density with high- @xmath3 cuprates , it is plausible to ascribe the deviation of nernst signal from normal state background to the vortex excitations existing in a region up to 20 k above @xmath3 . however , as discussing whereafter , we argue that this anomaly change in nernst signal between @xmath3 and 50 k might correlate with the spin - density wave ( sdw ) fluctuations rather than superconducting phase fluctuations .    in order to explore the nature underlying this anomaly in the nernst effect , it is useful to isolate the off - diagonal thermoelectric ( peltier conductivity ) term from the nernst signal by measuring the hall effect and seebeck effect separately . the temperature dependence of hall coefficient ( @xmath51 ) and thermopower ( @xmath52 ) was measured for the same sample under magnetic field ( @xmath53 ) of 8 t , and they are shown in figure 3(a)and ( b ) .",
    "their values in the normal state are consistent with previous reports @xcite and the negative signs mean that the dominant charge carrier is electron - like . at @xmath3 , both @xmath51 and @xmath52",
    "drop to zero sharply .",
    "it is very interesting that the profile of @xmath52 vs @xmath43 curves is similar to that of low charge density metals like underdoped high-@xmath3 cuprates and na@xmath1coo@xmath22 except the negative sign .",
    "the normal state nernst signal is comprised of two terms , viz .",
    "@xmath54 where @xmath55 is the off - diagonal peltier coefficient , @xmath56 the thermopower ( @xmath57 the diagonal conductivity and @xmath58 the diagonal peltier coefficient ) , @xmath59 the resisitivity , and tan@xmath60 the hall angle . for usual simple metals , the two terms in eq .",
    "( 1 ) cancel each other , which is so - called `` sondheimer cancellation '' @xcite .",
    "the second term @xmath52tan@xmath60 is calculated based on the @xmath52 and hall effect data , which is shown in figure 4(a ) . by comparing @xmath30 with @xmath52tan@xmath60 in figure 4(a ) , it becomes clear that the nernst signal @xmath30 is about one fifth of @xmath52tan@xmath60 , which means the `` sondheimer cancellation '' is not complete@xcite .",
    "however the multiband character does not enhance significantly the nernst signals in normal state .",
    "in other words , only one type ( electron type ) charge carrier is dominant in the nernst effect of the f doped lao@xmath0f@xmath1feas .",
    "the first term @xmath61 in eq.(1 ) is calculated by subtracting @xmath30 from the product @xmath62tan@xmath60 , which is shown in figure 4(b ) .",
    "it can be found that the off - diagonal thermoelectric current @xmath55 increases with decreasing temperature at high temperatures , but it saturates around 50 k and starts to decrease quickly as the temperature is close to @xmath3 . around and below @xmath3 , there are three terms which comprise @xmath30 , viz .",
    ", @xmath63 where @xmath64 denotes the contribution of vortex to the nernst signals , and @xmath65 denotes the contribution from normal state excitations .",
    "below @xmath3 , @xmath65 should drop to zero quickly , and @xmath64 shows a large positive peak .",
    "however , @xmath65 term starts to decreases at temperatures far above @xmath3 , which means a change in the electron state below 50 k. the off - diagonal peltier coefficient ( @xmath55 ) shows a similar profile as @xmath65 .",
    "it has been proposed that the undoped parent compound laofeas undergoes a sdw transition around 134 k and the f doping will suppress the sdw transition , and finally give a way to superconductivity @xcite . in f",
    "doped superconductors , there are evidences to support the existence of magnetic fluctuations .",
    "the variation of the temperature dependence of the resistivity with f content shows that sdw transition is gradually suppressed by f doping , and competition of sdw order and superconductivity order was proposed @xcite .",
    "recently hosono and his collaborators reported that a pseudogap of 0.1 ev in lao@xmath0f@xmath1feas was detected by photoemission and they attributed the origin of the pseudogap to strong spin fluctuations @xcite .",
    "they also found that the spin fluctuation shows a maximum at 5% f doping by dc magnetization measurements @xcite .",
    "the slow increase in @xmath30 above 50 k might be caused by the residual magnetic fluctuations , and therefore we suggest that the sharp decrease in @xmath65 below 50 k could result from the suppression of magnetic fluctuations . in other words , there is a kind of `` precursor state '' between @xmath3 and 50 k in which the magnetic fluctuations are strongly suppressed .",
    "such a suppression of magnetic fluctuations should be detected by other probes like nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) measurement .",
    "recent nmr measurements by nakai @xcite indicated that the 1/@xmath66 of @xmath67as in the lao@xmath68f@xmath69feas sample shows a cuire - weiss behavior down to 30 k , suggesting the development of sdw spin fluctuations with decreasing temperatures .",
    "then it is suppressed below 30 k. they concluded that the superconductivity emerges when a magnetic ordering is suppressed .",
    "we suggest that the sharp suppression of the off - diagonal peltier current @xmath55 and the suppression of 1/@xmath66 just above @xmath5 should have the same origin , i.e. , both should result from the suppression of sdw fluctuations .",
    "it is an interesting open question whether this `` precursor state '' is indeed crucial to the emergence of `` high-@xmath3 '' superconductivity in this system .",
    "we report the first nernst effect measurement on the new iron - based superconductor lao@xmath0f@xmath1feas ( @xmath19=0.1 ) . in the normal state ,",
    "the nernst signal is negative and very small , which means that the `` sondheimer cancellation '' is incomplete and the normal state transport is mainly dominate by the electron - like band .",
    "below @xmath3 a large positive peak related to vortex motion is observed .",
    "the flux flowing regime is very large , and there is no obvious change in nernst signals at @xmath4 which is defined from the magnetoresistance , contrast to conventional type - ii superconductors with layered structure .",
    "furthermore , a clear deviation of the nernst signal from normal state background and an anomalous suppression of off - diagonal thermoelectric current between @xmath3 and 50 k are observed .",
    "we argue that this anomaly in the normal state nernst effect could correlate with the sdw fluctuations .",
