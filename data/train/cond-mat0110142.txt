    "interacting many - particle systems encountered in nature are sometimes difficult to describe in terms of classical or quantum mechanics .",
    "a stochastic description is then more appropriate for systems which behave essentially randomly on a phenomenological level .",
    "often this leads to problems far away from thermal equilibrium for which  in contrast to equilibrium systems  a general concept or framework is still missing .",
    "therefore one has to rely on the investigation of special examples .",
    "models which are exactly solvable@xcite become then even more important than in equilibrium physics@xcite .",
    "they allow to probe the nature of non - equilibrium physics with the problems related to the reliability of approximative methods .",
    "also stochastic systems are often used for the modelling of interdisciplinary problems@xcite where the interactions between the entities are not known exactly .",
    "the dynamics of stochastic systems is governed by the master equation which can be interpreted as a schrdinger equation in imaginary time@xcite ( see sec .  [ sec_def ] ) . in the analytical treatment of non - equilibrium systems",
    "it is therefore possible to exploit this similarity by using successful techniques from equilibrium physics .",
    "especially the so - called matrix product ansatz@xcite ( mpa ) , first developed for spin chains@xcite , is important .",
    "it has been shown@xcite that the stationary state of one - dimensional stochastic processes is generically of mpa - type . however , in most cases it is still very difficult to calculate expectation values explicitly .    in this paper",
    "the exact stationary state of a one - dimensional stochastic process with staggered interaction and reflective boundaries is determined .",
    "this model can be regarded as the merger of the @xmath2$]-symmetric hopping model of sandow and schtz@xcite and a ratchet model proposed by kolomeisky and widom@xcite ( for details , see @xcite ) .",
    "a similar stochastic hopping model with periodic boundary conditions , where also coagulation and decoagulation processes may occur , has been studied by fujii @xcite using free fermion techniques .",
    "our model can not be solved using free fermion techniques but requires a different approach .",
    "this approach relies heavily on the observation that the stationary state of our model is an",
    "_ optimum ground state _ ( ogs ) @xcite .",
    "the occurrence of ogs in the context of matrix product states will be elucidated .",
    "it will be shown that ogs are not ubiquitous for systems with reflective boundaries .",
    "we consider stochastic systems on a one - dimensional lattice with @xmath3 sites . each cell",
    "@xmath4 can either be empty or occupied by a particle .",
    "its state is characterized by the variable @xmath5 which could e.g.  be the occupation number .",
    "the model is then defined by its dynamics , namely by the transition rates @xmath6 for a transition from a lattice configuration @xmath7 to the configuration @xmath8 . the probability @xmath9 to find the system at time @xmath10 in the configuration @xmath7 is then given by the master equation @xmath11    introducing the state vector @xmath12 the master equation can be written in more compact form @xmath13 where the matrix elements of the stochastic hamiltonian @xmath14 can be expressed through the transition rates @xmath15 . for processes with nearest - neighbour interaction and periodic boundary conditions , the stochastic hamiltonian @xmath14 can be written as a sum @xmath16 of local hamiltonians @xmath17 acting only on the sites @xmath4 and @xmath18 .",
    "for other boundary conditions the interactions at the boundaries @xmath19 and @xmath20 are described by additional boundary operators @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "the so - called quantum formalism described above emphasizes the similarity with a schrdinger equation in imaginary time .",
    "the stochastic hamiltonian @xmath14 , which in general is not hermitean , is often related to spin chains@xcite . therefore it is not surprising that many methods for the treatment of equilibrium systems can be adopted@xcite , e.g.  free fermion techniques , bethe ansatz , or the matrix product ansatz .",
    "the stationary state @xmath23 reached for @xmath24 is determined by @xmath25 i.e.  it corresponds to a zero - energy ground state of the hamiltonian @xmath14 .    in this paper",
    "we consider the following stochastic process : particles with a hard core occupy the sites of a chain of length @xmath3 .",
    "the odd sites of the chain belong to sublattice @xmath26 and the even sites to sublattice @xmath27 .",
    "the global stochastic hamiltonian is an alternating sum of local two - site hamiltonians @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 act non - trivially on sites @xmath4 and",
    "@xmath18 according to @xmath31 the local two - site basis is ordered as follows : @xmath32 where @xmath33 corresponds to an empty site and @xmath34 to an occupied one .",
    "here we have already used the spin language to emphasize the similarities with spin systems .",
    "the only allowed processes are jumps of particles to unoccupied neighbouring sites where the hopping rates alternate along the bonds of the chain .",
    "the @xmath35 are arbitrary constants which may differ from site to site .",
    "they control the activities of the bonds and influence dynamical properties only .",
    "since no particles enter or leave the chain , the total particle number @xmath0 is a conserved quantity and the stationary states of a chain of length @xmath3 can be classified according to the particle number @xmath36 .",
    "exact solutions of small systems with @xmath37 indicate that the stationary state for any given particle number is unique and , more interestingly , that this stationary state is an ogs .",
    "an ogs is a special type of ground state of a hamiltonian @xmath38 , which is at the same time ground state of _ all _ local hamiltonians @xmath39 . in the present case",
    "this means that all local hamiltonians @xmath29 and @xmath30 have to annihilate the stationary state @xmath23 since the `` ground state energy '' of @xmath14 is @xmath40 according to ( [ statstate ] ) . explicitly this has the consequence that if @xmath41 has a component @xmath42 it must also have the component @xmath43 with a relative weight given by @xmath44    stochastic processes on a one - dimensional lattice with a finite interaction range and boundary interactions have a stationary state which can be written as a matrix product state @xcite .",
    "this can be shown without using the explicit form of the boundary operators @xmath21 , @xmath22 .",
    "therefore , reflective boundaries  corresponding to vanishing boundary operators @xmath45  are allowed as well .",
    "a suitable ( grand canonical ) matrix product ansatz for the stationary state in the presence of staggering has the form @xmath46 where we have used ( [ eq : brace1 ] ) to write the state for even and odd @xmath3 in a unified way and @xmath47 @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 are matrices acting on some auxiliary vector space @xmath26 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 . by direct computation",
    "one verifies that this vector is a ground state of @xmath14 , if one can find matrices @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 , @xmath57 , which are the components of the vectors @xmath58 and @xmath59 , respectively , such that the following relations are fulfilled @xmath60    the most simple way to satisfy this algebra is given by the choice @xmath61 .",
    "then , the only remaining equations are @xmath62 turning @xmath63 into an optimum ground state !    more explicitly , the problem of finding the ground state of @xmath14 becomes the problem of finding a representation of the quadratic algebra @xmath64 the algebra ( [ eq : alt.algebra ] ) fixes the relative weight of two configurations in @xmath63 that differ only by the interchange of a particle and a hole at the sites @xmath4 and @xmath18 .",
    "this relative weight is exactly the one that has been proposed above by means of the optimum ground state property given by ( [ eq : brace1 ] ) .",
    "thus , in case of reflective boundaries the appearance of optimum ground states can be connected with the fact that the algebra necessary for the construction of the ground state in form of a matrix product state takes its most simple form .",
    "nevertheless , it should be noticed that reflective boundaries do not enforce optimum ground states , as will be shown in the caveat at the end ( sec .",
    "[ sec_caveat ] ) .    up to this point ,",
    "two ways for the construction of the stationary state of @xmath14 have been presented .",
    "the first way gives a recipe for the construction of the relative probabilities of all states that are present in the stationary state .",
    "the second way is connected with the matrix product approach : the ground state problem is transformed into the purely algebraic problem of finding the representation of the quadratic algebra ( [ eq : alt.algebra ] ) .    in the following",
    ", no use of these two possibilities will be made . instead , a third way will be given that closely resembles the construction in @xcite .",
    "the starting point will be the vacuum vector @xmath65 describing a completely empty chain .    out of this vacuum",
    "all @xmath0-particle stationary states will be constructed , using powers of suitable creation operators . with @xmath66 for every @xmath67 a `` local '' particle creation operator @xmath68 is given by @xmath69 \\cdot s_j^-.\\ ] ] the global creation operator @xmath70 is the sum of all local creation operators @xmath71 in order to shorten the notation one furthermore defines @xmath72_{a : c}:=\\frac{1-(ac)^k}{1-ac},\\nonumber\\\\   { [ k]}_{a : c } ! & : = & [ 1]_{a : c}[2]_{a : c}\\cdots [ k]_{a : c}. \\label{eq : brace2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the symbol @xmath73 should not be confused with @xmath74 defined in ( [ eq : brace1 ] ) , which looks similar but has a different meaning .",
    "the floor function @xmath75 denotes the largest integer @xmath76 . with these definitions the unnormalized @xmath0-particle stationary state @xmath77 is built out of the vacuum by @xmath78_{a : c}!}(b^-)^n{|\\text{vac}\\rangle}.\\ ] ] in addition , one has the left complete @xmath0-particle state , defined as @xmath79 for the left complete state it is straightforward to show that @xmath80 from exact solutions of systems with @xmath37 a similar relation has been guessed for the unnormalized @xmath0-particle state @xmath77 : for all @xmath81 the following identity holds @xmath82 which can be proven by direct calculation . as a consequence one finds that the @xmath1-point density correlation functions obey the recursion relation @xmath83 with this recursion relation at hand it is easy to prove that @xmath84 which suffices to show that the @xmath0-particle states defined above are optimum ground states and hence stationary states .",
    "note that @xmath70 does not commute with @xmath14 and so does _ not _ reflect a global symmetry .",
    "both operators commute only , if they are restricted to the kernel of @xmath14 . therefore , the integrability found for @xmath85 is most presumably lost if @xmath86 .",
    ", @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "the dashed line corresponds to analytical data from ( [ eq : prof.rec ] ) .",
    "the boxes represent monte carlo data.,title=\"fig : \" ] +    for the calculation of density profiles , in principle , the normalization of @xmath77 has to be computed .",
    "unfortunately , a direct computation of this quantity is very involved and tedious .",
    "therefore a step - by - step method has been chosen .",
    "assume that @xmath90 is the normalization of @xmath91 .",
    "assume further that @xmath92 is such that the normalization @xmath93 of @xmath77 is given by @xmath94 this gives with ( [ eq : central ] ) @xmath95 in the @xmath0-particle state naturally the identity @xmath96 holds .",
    "thus , @xmath97    , @xmath98 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "the dashed line corresponds to analytical data from ( [ eq : prof.rec ] ) .",
    "the boxes represent monte carlo data.,title=\"fig : \" ] +    finally , one finds a recursion relation for the local density of an @xmath0-particle stationary state @xmath99 starting from the normalized stationary state @xmath100 , which belongs to @xmath101 and has @xmath102 , the density profiles for all @xmath0 can be computed .",
    "the results have been compared with monte carlo data ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : profile1 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : profile2 ] ) showing perfect agreement . generically we find exponentially decaying density profiles .",
    "if one of the parameters is larger than one , whereas the other parameter is smaller than one , the density profiles clearly reflect the sublattice structure of the hamiltonian , since the slope of the profile is alternatingly positive and negative along the bonds ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : profile1 ] ) .",
    "the shape of the density profile can be explained qualitatively in the following way : on the odd bonds hopping to the right is favoured because @xmath103 and @xmath104 . as a consequence , the density at the left end of an odd bond is smaller than the density at the right end . along the even bonds",
    "one has the opposite scenario since @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "finally , the high density in the left part of the system is due to the fact that the maximal hopping amplitude can be found at the even bonds which favour hopping to the left .",
    "if both parameters @xmath107 and @xmath108 are larger or smaller than one , we find a different behaviour .",
    "now the density profiles become monotonous functions of @xmath109 and the sublattice structure is hidden ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : profile2 ] ) .",
    "as presented above , optimum ground states come into play naturally if one encounters stochastic processes with reflective boundaries",
    ". therefore one might conjecture that the stationary state of such processes is always of this special type .",
    "however , this is not true . in the following a @xmath110-symmetric reaction - diffusion model",
    "will be presented , which has zero - energy ground states that are not ( always ) optimum ground states .",
    "the sites of a chain of length @xmath3 are coloured with the elements of @xmath110 , i.e. , one has three types of particles ( @xmath111 ) on a completely filled chain .",
    "two particles on neighbouring sites react according to the following rules ( algebraic manipulations are done according to @xmath110 ) @xmath112 thus , the local hamiltonian is given by @xmath113 the operators @xmath17 act as @xmath114 on sites @xmath115 and as identity on the remaining sites of the chain , and hence the global stochastic hamiltonian reads @xmath116 the exact solution for @xmath117 shows a threefold degenerate ground state @xmath118 these states are optimum ground states .    looking at @xmath119 a new situation arises .",
    "one has again a threefold optimum ground state @xmath120 in addition , one finds two qualitatively different ground states @xmath121,\\\\    \\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha}|k , k , k+1\\rangle+ \\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha+\\beta}|k , k+1,k\\rangle\\right].\\\\ \\end{split}\\ ] ] these states are not optimum ground states . moreover @xmath122 the occurrence of such states might be connected with the existence of an additional symmetry .",
    "the last result can also be understood in the context of mpa .",
    "as the two additional states are not optimum ground states , the cancelling vector @xmath58 has to be nontrivial .",
    "@xmath123 using the fact that @xmath124 and @xmath125 must be in the kernel of @xmath58 one finds @xmath126 and thus ( [ eq : nonopt ] ) holds .    most interestingly systems of length @xmath127 and @xmath128  like the two - site system  possess only threefold degenerate optimum ground states .",
    "but then , for @xmath129 , two additional ground states show up again .",
    "this might be related to an additional symmetry occuring for system sizes which are an integer multiple of three .",
    "this example shows that reflective boundary conditions do not imply the existence of an ogs .",
    "however , it still leaves open the possibility that systems with reflecting boundary conditions and a _ unique _ stationary state have optimum ground states .",
    "we have presented the exact solution for the stationary state of a stochastic process with staggered hopping rates . using the similarity of the quantum formalism to the master equation",
    "the model could be interpreted as a spin chain .",
    "its ground state  corresponding to the stationary state of the stochastic process  was shown to be an optimum ground state , i.e.  it is at the same time ground state of all local hamiltonians @xmath17 which make up @xmath14 .",
    "furthermore the @xmath1-point density correlation functions have been determined recursively .",
    "apart from the fact that the model is one of the very few exactly solvable models with staggered interactions it might have practical applications . a similar model has been proposed by kolomeisky and widom@xcite .",
    "it is a simplified ratchet model ( for a recent review , see @xcite ) for molecular motors effectively describing the motion of a motor protein on a micro - tubule@xcite .",
