    "this conjecture , which became known as _ aldous spectral gap conjecture _ , originates in a probabilistic framework and it asserts that two distinct markov chains , namely the random walk and the _ interchange process _ have generators with the same spectral gap . the reader is referred to @xcite for details on the probabilistic angle .",

    "unfortunately none of these papers contains tools which , with maybe some hammering and bending , can be forged to tackle the general case . a proof which works in the general case has required , in fact , a subtle combinations of two new ingredients : ( a ) a ( nonlinear ) `` reduction mapping '' @xmath45 which enables a proof by induction on @xmath35 ; ( b ) an inequality , named the _ octopus inequality _ by the authors of @xcite , who were `` inspired by its tentacular nature '' .",
    "quite amazingly both elements ( a ) and ( b ) appeared almost simultaneously in the preprint versions of @xcite and @xcite , but the octopus inequality was left as a conjecture in @xcite ( it was actually proved in some particular cases ) , while it was proved in @xcite .    the main objective of this paper is to present ( section [ sec : oct ] ) a simpler and more transparent proof of the octopus inequality which hopefully can unravel its tentacular nature .",
