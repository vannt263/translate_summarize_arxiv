    "the cdf and d   experiments have successfully collected data since start of the run ii at the tevatron collider in 2001 .",
    "the presented results correspond to an integrated luminosity of up to 2.8  fb@xmath5 at each experiment .",
    "the large @xmath0-meson production cross - section allows enough data to be collected to study the tiny effects of cp - violation in @xmath0 systems .",
    "in particular , the results described in this paper cover measurements of the mixing phase @xmath1 , decay width difference @xmath6 , semileptonic asymmetry @xmath7 in the @xmath3 system and direct cp violation in the @xmath3 and @xmath4 systems .    a theoretical overview of @xmath8 mixing is given in  @xcite .",
    "flavour eigenstates of @xmath3 meson propagate according to the schrdinger equation : @xmath9    the physical eigenstates @xmath10 and @xmath11 have different masses and lifetimes : @xmath12 @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the cp phase .",
    "the cp phase for the @xmath3 system is very small in the standard model ( sm ) : @xmath15 .",
    "the review  @xcite predicts that the cp phase @xmath16 is the most sensitive to the new physics effects .",
    "the semileptonic asymmetry defined as @xmath17 where @xmath18 corresponds to direct @xmath3 decays @xmath19 ( e.g. @xmath20 ) , is related to the cp phase : @xmath21 measurements of all four parameters in the equation  [ eq : asl_phis ] allow testing of the sm predictions with high sensitivity .",
    "the mixing phase @xmath22 with the sm prediction @xmath23 measured in decays @xmath24 is also related to the phase @xmath25 ( see note in  @xcite ) . in paper",
    "@xcite the notation @xmath26 is used , but to distinguish this phase from the cp phase @xmath16 defined above in equation  [ eq : phis ] the notation @xmath27 as in  @xcite is preferable .",
    "the new physics contribution could be described by the phase @xmath28 which modifies the original mixing phases in the following way : @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "the system @xmath31 from @xmath3 decay represents an admixture of cp - even and cp - odd states .",
    "angular analysis could be used to separate the cp components ( see figure  [ fig : d0_jpsitrans ] ) and measure the lifetime of each component and phase @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "additional information on the initial state flavor of the @xmath3 meson helps resolve the sign ambiguity on @xmath1 for a given @xmath2 and improves the precision of results . the cdf collaboration used the data sample corresponding to 1.7  fb@xmath5 ( this result was updated recently using 2.8  fb@xmath5 data sample  @xcite ) and the d   data sample corresponds to 2.8  fb@xmath5 .",
    "constraints on the strong phases @xmath32 from the @xmath33 system allow the sign ambiguity on @xmath2 to be resolved ( see recent theoretical work  @xcite ) .",
    "the cdf and d   results obtained with different constraints , and compared with the sm prediction are shown in figure  [ fig : phis_comb ] . the hfag combination  @xcite gives two sets of the numerical results obtained with free phases @xmath32 :    * @xmath34  ps@xmath5 , + @xmath35  rad ; * @xmath36  ps@xmath5 , + @xmath37  rad .",
    "the final state in @xmath38 decays is cp - even , although the theoretical uncertainty is not well understood ( see for example the discussion in  @xcite ) .",
    "the branching ratio @xmath39 could be used to calculate the decay width difference from the following equation derived in  @xcite : @xmath40 the efficient muon triggering system at d   provides access to these decays through the muons from semileptonic decays of @xmath41 mesons : @xmath42 .",
    "narrow invariant mass peaks from the @xmath43 decays help to ensure a clean data sample .",
    "the number of selected @xmath44 candidates was determined to be @xmath45 and the resulting branching ratio : @xmath46 . assuming no new physics effects ( the sm value of @xmath15 )",
    "one can estimate the decay width difference from equation  [ eq : dgamma1 ] : @xmath47 .",
    "the sm prediction for the semileptonic asymmetry in @xmath3 decays is very small  @xcite : @xmath48 . at the tevatron",
    "the semileptonic asymmetry could be measured either from an inclusive di - muon sample , where @xmath49 , or by using the @xmath50 sample .",
    "the first method has very high statistical accuracy , but requires knowledge of asymmetries of other contributing processes in addition to the detector charge asymmetries .",
    "the second method has less statistical power but ensures that the major contribution to the asymmetry comes from the @xmath3 decays .",
    "the time - integrated untagged analysis at d   used the data sample @xmath51 corresponding to 1.3  fb@xmath5 to obtain the result @xmath52  @xcite ( this analysis was recently updated using a larger data sample , time dependence and initial - state tagging  @xcite ) .",
    "the description of the method used to determine the detector asymmetries at d   is given in  @xcite where the di - muon asymmetry result is presented .",
    "the combination of the two d   results is published in  @xcite : @xmath53 .",
    "the preliminary cdf result obtained using the inclusive di - muon sample is shown in  @xcite : @xmath54 .",
    "the recent measurements of direct cp violation in the @xmath4 and @xmath33 systems led to the @xmath56 puzzle ( see for example  @xcite ) .",
    "it is therefore important to measure similar signatures in the @xmath3 system ( see discussion in  @xcite ) .",
    "the impact parameter triggers at cdf are used to collect the hadronic @xmath0-decays which are necessary for studies of cp eigenstates .",
    "figure  [ fig : cdf_bskpi ] shows the invariant mass distribution for 2 body hadronic decays at cdf assuming pion masses for the tracks .",
    "this sample allowed cdf to produce the only measurement of direct cp violation in the @xmath3 system : @xmath57 this result is in agreement with the theoretical predictions  @xcite .",
    "cp analysis of the decays @xmath59 represents another example of using the impact parameter triggers at cdf .",
    "the cp asymmetry is measured in these decays .",
    "this asymmetry is relevant for the determination of the ckm angle @xmath60 ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath61 meson decays either to cp eigenstates @xmath62 , or flavour eigenstate @xmath63 .",
    "the different modes were separated using invariant masses , momentum imbalance , total momentum and @xmath64 information .",
    "the measured asymmetries agree with the b - factory measurements  @xcite and have competitive precision : @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 .",
    "highly efficient di - muon triggers allow for collection of large @xmath69 samples at tevatron which are competitive with the b - factories in some of the cp violation measurements in @xmath4 and @xmath33 systems .",
    "the sm expectation of the direct cp asymmetry in @xmath68 decays is small : @xmath70  @xcite .",
    "however , the new physics effects ( for example a fourth generation ) may enhance the asymmetry up to 0.01 . the d   experiment measured this asymmetry to be @xmath71 .",
    "so far , the tevatron experiments cdf and d   have provided the unique sources of the cp parameters in @xmath3 system .",
    "the complimentary measurements in @xmath72 systems are not only supporting the @xmath3 analyses but also providing results competitive with the b - factories .",
    "interestingly though , the cp parameters in the @xmath3 system start showing some deviations from the sm predictions in addition to the @xmath72 puzzles .",
    "all analyses are statistically limited and the precision will improve in the near future .      9 i.  dunietz , _ et al .",
