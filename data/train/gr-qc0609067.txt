    "recently there has been a proliferation of  brane world models , where the standard model matter is confined in a four dimensional space time said to be a singular  hypersurface or @xmath0-brane embedded in a @xmath1-dimensional space time .",
    "this @xmath1-dimensional space time is said to be the bulk .",
    "though the matter is all confined to a @xmath0-brane , the gravitational field can propagate in the higher dimensional bulk .",
    "the @xmath2 extra dimensions , however , need not be small or even compact in this theory .",
    "in fact , randall and sundrum [ 1 ] have shown that for @xmath3 the fifth dimension may be infinite .",
    "the effective equations for gravity in four dimensions were obtained by shiromizu et al [ 2 ] using israel s boundary conditions and @xmath4-symmetry for the bulk space time , in which the  brane is embedded .",
    "it has been demonstrated by bintruy et al [ 3,4 ] that generically the equations governing the cosmological evolution of the  brane will be different from those corresponding to the analogous friedmann equations of standard cosmology .",
    "essentially the difference lies in the fact that the energy density of the  brane appears in quadratic form in the  brane equations , whereas it is linear in the standard cosmology .",
    "+ in the present paper our motivation is to solve the five dimensional einstein equations for a perfect fluid on the  brane while the matter in the bulk is either in the form of pure dust or a cosmological constant ( or vacuum ) .",
    "it is well known that in the standard cosmology , a special kind of fluid called  chaplygin gas [ 5 and references therein ] has a very interesting property that it can drive the standard @xmath5 universe from its initial dust dominated stage to a final @xmath6 dominated stage at the end , so that at the late stage , one can obtain an accelerating world model consistent with the recent supernova type ia observations [ 6 ] .",
    "measurements of luminosity - redshift relation , obtained from observations suggest that most of the energy in the universe happens to be dark .",
    "different kinds of the dark energy viewed from different angles have so far been proposed [ 7 ] to explain the late time acceleration of the universe .",
    "recently , ponce de leon [ 8 - 10 ] studied the acceleration of the @xmath5 universe as a consequence of the time evolution of the vacuum energy or the  brane tension in the context of the  brane world models .",
    "+ in our paper , section ii presents the derivation of  brane equations starting from the einstein equations in the bulk with a general form of matter there .",
    "then in section iii , assuming pure dust in the bulk , einstein equations in the  brane show that only a kind of  barotropic equation of state @xmath7 holds between the effective isotropic pressure @xmath8 and effective energy density @xmath9 ( i.e , a linear relation among the actual pressure and energy density in the  brane and the  brane tension ) .",
    "cosmological solutions are obtained for both bulk and  brane scenario .",
    "section iv deals with perfect fluid in the form of  chaplygin gas in the  brane model .",
    "when the bulk is vacuum , then the dynamics shows initial  deceleration of the  brane with subsequent acceleration going over to the @xmath6cdm model . on the other hand ,",
    "when the bulk has negative @xmath10 cosmological constant , i.e , an anti de - sitter bulk , there occur two different cases .",
    "depending on the parameters in the field equations , the  brane may either transit from a decelerating stage to an accelerating stage in course of time or it may simply exhibit a  recollapsing behaviour .",
    "the paper ends with the concluding remarks .",
    "we shall assume that the geometry of the five dimensional bulk is characterized by the space time metric of the form    @xmath11    with @xmath12 as the fifth coordinate .",
    "the  hypersurface @xmath13 is identified as the world volume of the  brane that forms our universe . as usual , for simplicity , the explicit form of the metric ( 1 ) is taken to be    @xmath14    where for simplicity we choose the usual spatial section of the  brane to be flat .",
    "+ now for cosmological solutions , we shall have to specify the matter explicitly .",
    "in fact , we shall classify the matter as of two distinct parts namely + i )  matter confined to our  brane universe and + ii )  matter distributed over the @xmath10 bulk .",
    "+ hence , the energy momentum tensor can be decomposed into    @xmath15    where the explicit form of the matter is [ 11 ,  3 ,  4 ]    @xmath16    and    @xmath17    in general , energy - momentum tensor in the bulk depends on @xmath18 and @xmath12 ( i.e ,  @xmath19 ) but to recover a homogeneous cosmology in the  brane , matter field in the  brane is assumed to be the function of time alone .",
    "also the  brane is assumed to be infinitely thin .",
    "now the explicit form of the five dimensional einstein equations    @xmath20    for the above metric ( 2 ) having matter distribution in the form ( 3 ) are [ 11 ,  3 ]    @xmath21 = \\kappa^{2}\\left(\\rho_{b}+\\frac{\\delta(y)}{b}\\rho_{b}\\right)\\ ] ]    @xmath22\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath23 = \\kappa^{2}\\left(p_{b}+\\frac{\\delta(y)}{b}p_{b}\\right)\\ ] ]    @xmath24    and    @xmath25 = \\kappa^{2}p_{5}\\ ] ]    where an  overdot stands for differentiation with respect to time @xmath18 and a prime indicates derivative with respect to the fifth coordinate @xmath12 . + for  brane cosmology , we need solution of the einstein s equations ( 7)-(10 ) as @xmath26 .",
    "now , for a well defined geometry , the metric tensor should be continuous across the  brane ( i.e , @xmath13 ) while its derivative with respect to @xmath12 may be  discontinuous at the  hypersurface @xmath13 . as a result",
    ", dirac delta function will appear in the second derivatives of the metric coefficients with respect to @xmath12 namely [ 3 ]    @xmath27~\\delta(y)\\ ] ]    here @xmath28 is the non - distributional part of the second derivative i.e , the usual second order derivative and @xmath29 $ ] is the measure of discontinuity of first derivative across @xmath13 ( with @xmath30 , the dirac delta function ) as    @xmath31=a'(0+)-a'(0-)\\ ] ]    if we now proceed to the limit as @xmath26 and match the dirac delta function in both sides of the field equations ( 7 ) and ( 8) we obtain    @xmath32}{a_{0}b_{0}}=-\\frac{\\kappa^{2}}{3}\\rho_{b}\\ ] ]    @xmath33}{n_{0}b_{0}}=\\frac{\\kappa^{2}}{3}~(3p_{b}+2\\rho_{b})\\ ] ]    where subscript @xmath34 in the scale factors indicate their values on the  brane . + one may note that the jump of the field equation ( 9 ) using equations ( 13 ) and ( 14 ) results in the energy conservation relation on the  brane namely    @xmath35    further , if we take the average value of the field equation ( 10 ) for @xmath36 and @xmath37 and impose the @xmath4-symmetry we get [ 3 ]    @xmath38    here we have chosen @xmath39 , which is allowed by a suitable time transformation and hence @xmath18 is now the usual cosmic time on the  brane .",
    "this equation can be termed as generalized friedmann type equation on the  brane .",
    "the basic difference with the corresponding equation in standard cosmology is that , here the square of the hubble parameter depends  quadratically on the  brane energy density , in contrast with the usual linear dependence for friedmann universe .",
    "+ moreover , by introducing a function @xmath40 defined by    @xmath41    the five dimensional field equations ( 7 ) and ( 10 ) can be written in compact form as ( for @xmath42 )    @xmath43    @xmath44    now equating the time derivative of equation ( 18 ) with the y - derivative of equation ( 19 ) we have    @xmath45    as we have assumed @xmath46 indicating that there is no flow of energy along the extra dimension , the bianchi identity @xmath47 results    @xmath48    also taking average value of the equation(17 ) for @xmath36 and @xmath37 , imposing the @xmath4-symmetry and using the junction condition ( 13 ) we obtain the generalized friedmann equation    @xmath49    where @xmath50 is the value of @xmath51 on the  brane .",
    "+ therefore , the cosmological evolution on the bulk is completely characterized by the einstein field equations ( 7)-(10 ) ( also ( 18 ) , ( 19 ) ) and by the conservation equations ( 20 ) and ( 21 ) . on the other hand",
    ",  brane cosmology will be determined by equations ( 16 ) and ( 22 ) , junction conditions ( 13 ) and ( 14 ) and by the matter conservation on the  brane ( 15 ) .",
    "if the bulk matter is assumed to be in the form of pure dust i.e , @xmath52 , then integrating the conservation equation ( 21 ) we get    @xmath53    where @xmath54 is function of the coordinate @xmath12 alone . + also comparing the conservation equations ( 20 ) and ( 21 ) and using the field equation ( 9 ) we have    @xmath55    with @xmath56 , an arbitrary function of @xmath12 . + as @xmath57 , the equation ( 19 ) yields @xmath58 , a function of @xmath12 alone which again in view of ( 18 ) satisfies the relation    @xmath59    now using ( 24 ) in ( 17 ) , we obtain the differential equation for @xmath60 in the form +   @xmath61 + which on integration gives the solution for the scale factor on  brane in the form    @xmath62\\ ] ]    with @xmath63 , an arbitrary integration function . + in order to obtain cosmological solutions on the  brane , we now consider the generalized friedmann equation ( 22 ) written earlier    @xmath64    further , combining ( 24 ) with the junction condition ( 14 ) we get for the effective equation of state for the  brane matter    @xmath65    equivalently , as    @xmath66    with @xmath67 representing the  brane tension , the above equation of state yields the following linear relation    @xmath68    thus for dust bulk , the fluid in the  brane must satisfy the above linear relation between isotropic pressure , energy density and  brane tension .",
    "using now the above equation of state ( 28 ) into the  brane conservation equation ( 15 ) we get    @xmath69    now since @xmath70   as is evident from the equation ( 24 ) , the  brane must satisfy the following relation +  @xmath29=2b_{0}\\alpha_{0}$ ] + and hence using equations ( 13 ) and ( 31 ) , the arbitrary constants @xmath71 and @xmath72 above are shown to be related as    @xmath73    further , for the dust model in the bulk and the equation of state ( 28 ) in the  brane , the friedmann type equation ( 16 ) simplifies to    @xmath74    which has the first integral    @xmath75    where @xmath76 is an integration constant .",
    "this is fully consistent with the equation ( 27 ) provided @xmath77 .",
    "+ now further integration of the equation ( 34 ) yields the explicit expression for the  brane scale factor @xmath78 as    @xmath79    here since @xmath80 , we always get either an accelerating model or a decelerating model of the  brane universe depending on the sign of the constant @xmath76 , but there can not be any midway transition from the decelerating phase to the accelerating one ( or the reverse ) .",
    "the choice of sign in front of @xmath18 in equation ( 35 ) leads to an expanding ( + ve sign ) or a contracting ( -ve sign )  brane world .",
    "we consider here a modified  chaplygin gas [ 12 ] , which satisfies an equation of state in the following form    @xmath81    where @xmath82 and @xmath83 are constants and @xmath84 .",
    "+ so in this case from the energy conservation equation ( 15 ) , the expression for matter density is given by [ 12 ]    @xmath85^\\frac{1}{1+\\alpha}\\ ] ]    with @xmath86 , an arbitrary integration constant .",
    "+ * case - i :  vacuum bulk * + as there is no matter in the bulk we have @xmath87 and the field equations ( 18 ) and ( 19 ) show that @xmath51 must be a constant ( say , @xmath88 ) .",
    "hence we have the generalized friedmann equation ( see eq .",
    "( 22 ) )    @xmath89    also the generalized friedmann type equation ( 16 ) now simplifies to    @xmath90    further , our calculation will be much simplified if we choose @xmath91 in the equation of state ( 36 ) and hence from ( 37 ) we get the differential equation for the scale factor @xmath78 in the form    @xmath92    note that as @xmath93 ( early epoch ) @xmath94 while as @xmath95 which in view of ( 36 ) leads to @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "this shows that asymptotically the equation of state reduces to @xmath98 , which points to a @xmath6cdm model in the corresponding frw universe of standard cosmology .",
    "but for some special cases of the  brane world models ( shown in what follows ) the situation is different , since here @xmath99 may remain negative throughout even if the scale factor @xmath78 increases indefinitely .",
    "such behaviour is not consistent in the four dimensional friedmann model containing  chaplygin gas , which always asymptotically goes over to the @xmath6cdm model with the increase of the scale factor .",
    "+ we now proceed to solve equation ( 40 ) for @xmath100 ( for which , solution in closed form is possible ) .",
    "the first integral of equation ( 40 ) can be written in an integral form as    @xmath101    with @xmath102 , solutions of which are given by        and      graphically , it can be seen that for equation ( 42 ) , the scale factor expands exponentially whereas for equation ( 43 ) , it decreases to a minimum before further expansion .",
    "+      + fig.1(a )  fig.1(b ) + fig .",
    "1(a ) shows the variation of the scale factor ( given by eq.(42 ) ) over the time for @xmath106 and @xmath107 while fig .",
    "1(b ) shows the same ( for eq.(43 ) ) for @xmath108 and @xmath107 in both the cases , ( + ) ve sign is taken .",
    "* case - ii :  bulk with cosmological constant * + in this case we choose in the bulk @xmath109 .",
    "it follows then from bianchi identity , i.e , the conservation relation ( 21 ) demands @xmath110 , which in turn in view of ( 20 ) yields @xmath111 .",
    "hence @xmath112 is purely a constant said to be the cosmological constant in five dimension ( @xmath113 ) .",
    "now the generalized friedmann like equations ( 38 ) and ( 40 ) are modified in this case as    @xmath114    and    @xmath115    we choose here @xmath116 , so that at the  begining , the  brane world may be said to be filled up with ( @xmath117 ) radiation .",
    "we now examine the following cases : + * a ) *  when @xmath118 + for this restriction @xmath119 for all time while @xmath120 vanishes at some finite @xmath78 .",
    "it is therefore , a decelerating model of the universe with only a maximum but no minimum .",
    "it is a recollapsing  brane model ( see fig .",
    "2(a ) ) with @xmath93 and @xmath121 at both ends ( radiation to radiation ) . +",
    "* b ) *  when @xmath122 + here @xmath123 is non - zero throughout the evolution . as @xmath124 and as @xmath125 .",
    "so there is a transition from  deceleration to acceleration in course of evolution of the  brane ( graphically it is shown in fig .",
    "2(b ) ) . +",
    "* c ) *  when @xmath126  i.e ,   @xmath127 + in this case there is always @xmath119 with @xmath128 as @xmath129 .",
    "so this has a typical einstein - de sitter like behaviour for the spatially flat standard model ( presented in fig .",
    "the interesting feature of such a  brane world model is that even though at large @xmath60 the fluid has an equation of state @xmath98 , the model does not show the character of a @xmath6cdm model as in standard cosmology .",
    "rather it still remains a decelerating model . as we note that in one of the above three models of the  brane universe , for example in the second model , there occurs a transition from a decelerating to an accelerating phase .",
    "it may be worthwhile to locate the said transition point where @xmath130 .",
    "it is , however , not difficult to find out from the equation ( 46 ) that the  brane world model with @xmath116 remains accelerating ( @xmath131 ) as long as +  @xmath132 + that is , +  @xmath133 , + which finally reduces to the following condition by a straightforward calculation : +  @xmath134 $ ] + in the standard cosmology with the  chaplygin gas in frw universe , the corresponding inequality is +  @xmath135 .",
    "+ note that , this is only a formal comparison , as @xmath136 etc . in the  brane and",
    "the corresponding quantities in frw universe are not really identical .",

    "2(a ) shows the  recollapsing model of the universe for @xmath137 and @xmath138 .",
    "2(b ) shows a transition from  deceleration to acceleration for @xmath139 and @xmath107 .",
    "lastly , fig .",
    "2(c ) shows the einstein - de sitter universe for @xmath140 and @xmath107 .",
    "when the bulk is filled with only dust , there are certain restrictions imposed on the metric as well as on the matter content of the  brane . as results of such restrictions",
    "the metric coefficient @xmath141 becomes independent of the y - coordinate , while the perfect fluid in the  brane satisfies an effective equation of state @xmath142 , which apparently indicates that matter in the  brane is in the form of dark energy .",
    "+ on the other hand , if the matter in the bulk is in the form of cosmological constant or vacuum , there is neither any restriction on the metric nor on the matter contained by the  brane .",
    "bintruy et al and leon [ 3 ,  4 ] have shown perfect fluid solution with  barotropic equation of state for  brane matter . in this paper",
    ", we have shown that for  brane matter , it is possible to have  chaplygin gas form of fluid and obtained some interesting conclusions .",
    "the  recollapsing model of the  brane universe shows that in course of evolution it reaches a maximum size and finally collapses to a singularity .",
    "so for such a model , there is  deceleration through the entire evolution period and it has singularities at both ends .",
    "this difference in behaviour of the model is caused by the modifications introduced in the field equations by the presence of an anti - de sitter bulk ( @xmath143 ) .",
    "another point of significance for a  chaplygin gas in the  brane world model is that , the density does not vanish as the scale factor increases indefinitely , rather it reaches a finite magnitude with an equation of state @xmath98 .",
    "this behaviour still remains valid in one of the  brane world models , which expands indefinitely with  deceleration throughout and resembles the standard einstein - de sitter model .",
    "such behaviour of the  brane is in clear contradiction to the standard @xmath5 friedmann universe . +",
