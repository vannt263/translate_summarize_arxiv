    "a precise knowledge of neutrino - nucleus reactions is crucial in determining the properties of neutrinos and neutrino interactions , such as the mass hierarchy of neutrinos and cp violation in the lepton sector , from the data of recent and forthcoming experiments on nuclear targets@xcite . in the region of a few gev neutrino energy where the @xmath7(1232 ) resonance plays an important role , quasi - elastic knock out of nucleons and incoherent single pion production processes",
    "are the main reaction mechanisms of the neutrino - nucleus reactions .",
    "thus , the starting point of analyzing the neutrino - nucleus reactions in this energy region is a theoretical model which can describe the cross sections of the neutrino - induced single pion production on proton ( @xmath8 ) and neutron ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "these cross sections had been obtained from the experiments on hydrogen and deuterium targets at argonne national laboratory ( anl ) , and brookhaven national laboratory ( bnl ) and by european organization for nuclear research ( bebc - cern ) @xcite .",
    "various theoretical models@xcite have been constructed by fitting these data in recent years .",
    "the uncertainties of these models can bring systematic errors in the neutrino properties determined from applying these models to analyze the neutrino - nucleus reaction data .",
    "parts of these theoretical uncertainties could also originate from the about 30%-40% differences between the anl and bnl data , as discussed@xcite .",
    "however , it seems that this problem has been resolved@xcite .",
    "the cross sections of neutrino - induced single pion production on the proton target can be best obtained from the measurements on the hydrogen target . in practice",
    "these cross sections were also extracted from the analysis @xcite of the combined data from the measurements on both the hydrogen and the deuterium targets .",
    "the essential assumption of these analyses is that in the region near the peak of the quasi - free nucleon knock out process , one of the nucleons in the deuteron does not participate in the reaction mechanism and can be treated as a spectator in evaluating the cross sections on the deuteron target . with the same procedure , the cross sections of the single pion production on the neutron target were also extracted from the data on the deuteron target . in this work",
    "we examine the extent to which this spectator approximation procedure is valid .",
    "we consider the incoherent single pion production reaction on the deuteron owing to the charged currents : @xmath10(cc@xmath11 ) and @xmath12(cc@xmath13 ) . if the nuclear effects , such as those owing to the nucleon fermi motion in the deuteron and the final @xmath14 interactions , are neglected , the mechanisms of this reaction can be written as @xmath15 where @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) denotes that the neutron ( proton ) in the deuteron is assumed to be the spectator of the reaction processes .",
    "one then expects that the cross sections for three channels on the @xmath8 and @xmath9 can be extracted from the data on the deuteron target . thus cc@xmath13",
    "( eq.([eq : ccpi0 ] ) ) will give information on @xmath18 , while cc@xmath11 ( eqs.([eq : ccpip-1])-([eq : ccpip-2 ] ) ) will give information on @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "however , there is no obvious reason to justify the neglect of the @xmath14 final state interactions .",
    "it is natural to ask whether the extracted cross sections , in particular the cross sections on the neutron target , have the accuracy needed to constraint a model for determining the neutrino properties from analyzing the data of neutrino - nucleus reactions .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to investigate this important question of current interest .",
    "this is also needed to understand the origins of the difficulties , such as those reported recently in refs.@xcite , in obtaining a fully consistent theoretical explanation of the cross sections on both the proton and the neutron targets .",
    "to proceed , we need to start with a model which can describe the electroweak single pion production on the nucleon in the @xmath7 ( 1232 ) resonance region . among the recent models of neutrino induced pion production reactions @xcite",
    ", we adopt a dynamical model developed in refs .",
    "@xcite ( called sl model ) .",
    "this reaction model is defined by an energy independent hamiltonian which has vertex interactions describing the @xmath7 ( 1232 ) excitation and non - resonant meson - exchange mechanisms derived from phenomenological lagrangians by using@xcite a unitary transformation method . by solving the scattering equations derived from the constructed hamiltonian ,",
    "the resulting reaction amplitudes satisfy unitary condition .",
    "the sl model has been well tested@xcite against the data of @xmath2 scattering and electromagnetic pion production reactions on the nucleon in the @xmath7 ( 1232 ) resonance region .",
    "it also describes@xcite well the cross sections of neutrino - induced single pion production on @xmath8 and @xmath9 from anl , bnl , and bebc - cern .",
    "the advantage of using the sl model is that we can generate both the electromagnetic and the neutrino - induced pion production amplitudes within the same theoretical framework .",
    "because these two amplitudes contain the same vector current mechanisms , the application of this model to investigate the neutrino - induced reactions on nuclear targets , such as the deuteron considered in this work , can be first tested against the available data of reactions induced by photons and electrons .    by using the sl model and the high precision bonn nucleon - nucleon potential@xcite ,",
    "we have developed a method for calculating the cross sections of incoherent electroweak pion production on the deuteron within the well - studied multiple scattering theories@xcite .",
    "our calculations include an impulse term and one - loop contributions from nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath1 ) and pion - nucleon ( @xmath2 ) final state interactions .",
    "we first establish our calculation procedures by showing that the available data of incoherent pion photo - production reaction on the deuteron can be described reasonably well .",
    "our results are fairly consistent with those from the earlier works@xcite on this reaction , as discussed later .",
    "thus the developed calculation procedures can be used reliably to investigate the @xmath14 final state interaction effects on the cross sections of neutrino - induced single pion production reactions on deuteron .    in sec .",
