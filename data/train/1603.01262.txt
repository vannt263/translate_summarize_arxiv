    "the idea that the fundamental physical constants may vary on the cosmological time scale has been discussing since 1937 , when milne and dirac argued about possible variations of the newton constant @xmath2 during the lifetime of the universe  @xcite .",
    "currently , the subject of the cosmological variation of fundamental constants is closely related to emergence considerations of different cosmological models inspired by the discovery of late time acceleration of the expansion of the universe  @xcite .",
    "the possibility that dimensionless coupling constants such as electron - to - proton mass ratio @xmath3 and the fine structure constant @xmath4 may roll with cosmic time has recently been reviewed in  @xcite .",
    "the variation of fundamental constants would imply a violation of the einstein equivalence principle ( eep ) , that is , local position invariance ( lpi ) and local lorentz invariance ( lli ) . in particular , a changing @xmath0 accompanied by variation in other coupling constants can be associated with a violation of lli  @xcite , and lpi postulates that the fundamental physical laws are space - time invariant .",
    "the standard model of particle physics ( sm ) is based on the eep ; thus , we can probe the applicability limits of the sm and new types of interactions by experimental validation of the eep .    in spite of some claims that changes in @xmath0 or @xmath1 were marginally detected at high redshifts , to date",
    "no confirmed variation of dimensionless coupling constants has been found on astronomical space - time scales .",
    "below we review current observational constraints on @xmath0 and @xmath1 variations which provide limits on the allowed deviations from the sm and @xmath5cdm cosmology .",
    "two dimensionless coupling constants @xmath1 and @xmath0 are of particular interest for astronomical studies since their fractional changes @xmath6  @xmath7 , and @xmath8  @xmath9 can be accurately measured from spectral line profiles of galactic and extragalactic sources .",
    "differential measurements of @xmath6  and @xmath8are based on the comparison of the line centers in the absorption / emission spectra of cosmic objects and the corresponding laboratory values .",
    "it was shown that electro - vibro - rotational lines of h@xmath10  @xcite and co  @xcite have their own sensitivities to @xmath1-variation .",
    "similarly , each atomic transition is characterized by its individual sensitivity to @xmath0-variation  @xcite .",
    "the dependence of an atomic frequency @xmath11 on @xmath0 in the comoving reference frame of a distant object located at redshift @xmath12 is given by : @xmath13 , where @xmath14 . here",
    "@xmath11 and @xmath15 are the frequencies corresponding to the present - day value of @xmath0 and that at a redshift @xmath12 .",
    "the so - called @xmath16 factor is an individual parameter for each atomic transition  @xcite . if @xmath17 , then @xmath18 and the corresponding frequency shift @xmath19 is @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the dimensionless sensitivity coefficient .    for two lines of the same element with the sensitivity",
    "coefficients @xmath22 and @xmath23 , the fractional changes @xmath6  and @xmath8  are equal to @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the difference of the measured radial velocities of these lines , and @xmath26 is the corresponding difference between their sensitivity coefficients  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath27 values of atomic transitions observed in quasar spectra are very small , @xmath28  @xcite .",
    "similar low sensitivity coefficients were calculated for electro - vibro - rotational transitions in h@xmath10 and co ( for references , see  @xcite ) .",
    "small values of @xmath27 and @xmath29 put tough constraints on optical methods to probe @xmath8  and @xmath6 .",
    "for instance , at @xmath30 , the required line position accuracy must be @xmath31 km  s@xmath32  in accord with the inequality  @xcite : @xmath33 .",
    "a typical error of the line center measurements of an unsaturated absorption line in quasar spectra is about 1/10@xmath34 of the pixel size  @xcite . for high redshift objects , the uv - visual echelle spectrograph ( uves ) at the eso very large telescope ( vlt )",
    "provides a pixel size @xmath35    at @xmath36  , that is @xmath37 km  s@xmath32 , which is comparable to the velocity offset due to a fractional change in @xmath0 at the level of @xmath38 .",
    "this shows that special care and additional calibrations are required to probe @xmath8  and @xmath6at a level of @xmath39 by optical methods .",
    "such measurements have been carried out at the vlt / uves as described in the next section .",
    "the eso large programme 185.a-0745 ( 2010 - 2013 ) was especially aimed at testing the hypothetical variability of physical constants  @xcite .",
    "its prime goal was to study systematic errors in wavelength scales of quasar spectra .",
    "for this purpose quasars were observed almost simultaneously with bright asteroids , whose reflected sunlight spectra contain many narrow features with positions as accurate as a few m  s@xmath32  @xcite .",
    "additionally , bright stars were observed through an iodine gas absorption cell , providing a precise transfer function for part of the wavelength range .    as a result ,",
    "there were revealed distortions of the wavelength scale with a jig - saw pattern and peak - to - peak amplitude of several hundreds m  s@xmath32along the echelle orders .",
    "the presence of long range wavelength dependent velocity drifts ranging between @xmath400.5 and 1.0 km  s@xmath32  and showing opposite sign as compared with the keck / hires spectra of quasars were found as well  @xcite .    a stringent bound for @xmath8  was obtained for the absorber at @xmath41  = 1.69 towards the quasar he2217 - 2818  @xcite .",
    "the fractional change of @xmath0 in this system is @xmath8  = @xmath42 if alii @xmath43    and three feii transitions are used , and @xmath8  = @xmath44 in a slightly different analysis with only feii transitions used . together with",
    "another system observed with the uves / vlt at @xmath41  = 1.58 towards he0001 - 2340 where @xmath8  = @xmath45  @xcite , and eight hires / keck quasar absorbers with the mean @xmath8  = @xmath46  @xcite , these values are the tightest bounds to date on @xmath0-variation at high redshifts .",
    "as seen , they do not show any evidence for changes in @xmath0 at the precision level of @xmath47 ( 1@xmath48 confidence level , c.l . ) .    for the electron - to - proton mass ratio the analysis of the h@xmath10 absorption lines of the @xmath41  = 2.40 damped ly-@xmath0 system towards he0027 - 1836 yields @xmath6  = @xmath49  @xcite .",
    "when corrections to the wavelength dependent velocity drift are applied then @xmath6  = @xmath50 . at higher redshift @xmath41",
    "= 4.22 the analysis of h@xmath10 absorption lines in the spectrum of j1443 + 2724 gives @xmath6  = @xmath51  @xcite .",
    "these results are consistent with a null @xmath1-variation at the @xmath52 ( 1@xmath48 c.l . )",
    "precision level over a lookback time of @xmath53  gyr ( 10% of the age of the universe today ) .",
    "radio astronomical observations allow us to probe variation of the fundamental constants on the cosmological time scale at a level deeper than @xmath38 . in the microwave range",
    "there are a good deal of molecular transitions arising in galactic and extragalactic sources .",
    "electronic , vibrational , and rotational energies in molecular spectra are scaled as @xmath54 .",
    "this means that the sensitivity coefficients for pure vibrational and rotational transitions are equal to @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "molecules have also fine and hyperfine structures , @xmath5-doubling , hindered rotation , accidental degeneracy between narrow close - lying levels of different types and all of them have a specific dependence on the physical constants",
    ". some of these molecular transitions are @xmath57 times more sensitive to variations of @xmath1 and @xmath0 than atomic and electro - vibro - rotational transitions of h@xmath10 and co which are detected in six quasar absorbers between @xmath58 and 2.7  @xcite .",
    "in addition , positions of narrow molecular lines arising from cold dark clouds in the milky way disk can be measured with uncertainties of @xmath59 km  s@xmath32  @xcite , that is , the resulting sensitivity in radio bands is about three orders of magnitude higher as compared with optical spectra .",
    "the molecular transitions with enhanced sensitivity coefficients which are the prime targets for testing the constancy of the fundamental constants by radio astronomical methods were recently reviewed in  @xcite .",
    "for instance , inversion transitions of ammonia nh@xmath60   one of the most abundant molecules in the interstellar medium   have sensitivity coefficients @xmath61  @xcite .",
    "this enhancement occurs due to the tunneling effect depending on the action @xmath62 which is proportional to @xmath63 : the ground state tunneling frequency @xmath64 .",
    "observations of the nh@xmath60(1,1 ) inversion line and five hc@xmath60n rotational lines at @xmath41  = 0.89 towards pks1830 - 211  @xcite , as well as the inversion ( nh@xmath60 ) and rotational ( cs , h@xmath10co ) lines at @xmath41  = 0.69 towards b0218 + 357  @xcite led to constraints ( @xmath65 c.l . ) : @xmath66 and @xmath67 , respectively .    the second molecule which is extremely sensitive to @xmath1-variation and which is observed in galactic and extragalactic molecular clouds is methanol ch@xmath60oh .",
    "the sensitivity coefficients @xmath68 for different transitions in ch@xmath60oh range from @xmath69 to 42  @xcite .",
    "a distinctive feature of methanol is strong interaction between the internal ( hindered ) and overall rotations .",
    "transitions , in which both the internal and overall rotation states are changed , have strongly enhanced @xmath68-factors .",
    "however , the magnetic hyperfine structure of methanol transitions which was partly resolved in laboratory measurements  @xcite put natural restriction on the methanol method at the level of @xmath70 in @xmath6  tests .",
    "the hyperfine coupling in methanol is due to the well known magnetic spin - rotation and spin - spin couplings leading to small line splittings of @xmath71  khz .",
    "the large amplitude internal rotation may also lead to a less known magnetic coupling   the so - called spin - torsion coupling   which has not yet been conclusively evidenced .",
    "so far , methanol absorption lines were detected at @xmath41  = 0.89 in the gravitationally lensed system pks1830 - 211  @xcite .",
    "this system provides the most stringent limit on changes in @xmath1 over a lookback time of @xmath72  gyr : @xmath73 ( @xmath65 c.l . )",
    "@xcite .",
    "cold ( @xmath74  k ) and dense ( @xmath75 @xmath76 ) molecular cores in the milky way disk are another perspective targets to probe @xmath1 .",
    "the molecular cores are the ammonia emitters exhibiting some of the narrowest ( @xmath77 km  s@xmath32  ( fwhm ) ) lines ever observed  @xcite .",
    "the nh@xmath60 linewidths @xmath78 of some of them correspond to a pure thermal broadening at a minimum gas temperature of @xmath79  k coming mainly from the heating by cosmic rays  @xcite .",
    "a lifetime of molecular cores is @xmath80  yr  @xcite , and they are located at regions with different gravitational potentials .    a sample of molecular cores were studied with the medicina 32-m , nobeyama 45-m , and effelsberg 100-m telescopes in @xcite .",
    "the main result of these measurements is the most stringent limit on @xmath1-variation for the period of @xmath80  yr obtained by astronomical methods  @xcite : @xmath81 ( @xmath65 c.l . ) .",
    "this upper limit is comparable with the current constraint stemming from laboratory experiments , @xmath82  yr@xmath32  @xcite .",
    "an independent test that @xmath0 and @xmath1 may differ between the high- and low - density environments of the earth and the interstellar medium was performed with ch and oh in  @xcite . in the milky way , the strongest limit to date on @xmath0-variation is @xmath83 ( @xmath65 c.l . ) .",
    "thus , the einstein heuristic principle of lpi is validated all over the universe , that is , neither @xmath0 at the level of @xmath84 , no @xmath1 at the level of @xmath85 deviates from its terrestrial value for the passed @xmath86 yr .",
    "locally , no statistically significant deviations of @xmath6  from zero were found at even more deeper level of @xmath87 .",
    "for the fine structure constant , such limit is @xmath88 .",
    "in previous sections we demonstrated that the radio observations of nh@xmath60 and ch@xmath60oh lines are an order of magnitude more sensitive to fractional changes in @xmath1 than the optical constraints derived from h@xmath10 .",
    "however , at cosmological distances there are only five radio molecular absorbers known and all of them are located at @xmath89 , whereas h@xmath10 lines are detected at redshifts @xmath90 .    as was emphasized in  @xcite , the improvements in measurements of @xmath8  and @xmath6at the level of , respectively , @xmath91 and @xmath92 , can be achieved if two main requirements will be fulfilled : @xmath93 increasing precision of the laboratory measurements of the rest frame frequencies of the most sensitive molecular transitions , and @xmath94 increasing sensitivity and spectral resolution of astronomical observations .",
    "the second requirement is expected to be realized in a couple of years when the next generation very large array ( ngvla ) will start regular operations  @xcite .",
    "the ngvla will provide ten times the effective collecting area of the jvla and alma , operating from 1  ghz to 115  ghz , with ten times longer baselines ( 300  km ) .",
    "the increased sensitivity of the ngvlt by an order of magnitude over the vla would allow discovery of new molecular absorbers at @xmath95 and , thus , would extend the sample of targets suitable to test the eep at early cosmological epochs .    in optical sector",
    ", the forthcoming generation of new optical telescopes such as the thirty meter telescope ( tmt ) and the european extremely large telescope ( e - elt ) equipped by high - resolution ultra - stable spectrographs will significantly improve the constancy limits of fundamental couplings .",
    "the future high precision optical measurements should achieve sensitivities of @xmath96 for individual absorbers .",
    "thanks to a large sample of absorption - line systems , a few times deeper limit is expected for the ensemble average .    in spite of a far higher sensitivity of radio methods as compared to that of next - generation optical facilities , the unresolved ( or partly resolved ) magnetic hyperfine structure of molecular transitions prevents the radio measurements to achieve the accuracy better than @xmath97 .",
    "for example , the hyperfine structure of several transitions in methanol ch@xmath60oh was recently recorded in the microwave domain using the fourier transform microwave ( ft - mw ) spectrometer in hannover and the molecular beam ft - mw spectrometer in lille  @xcite . with the line splitting of @xmath71",
    "khz revealed in these laboratory studies , and the difference between the sensitivity coefficients @xmath98 for the 48.372 , 48.377 , and 60.531  ghz methanol lines observed at @xmath41  = 0.89 towards pks1830 - 211  @xcite , one finds the uncertainty of @xmath6of about @xmath99 , which is entirely caused by the unresolved hyperfine structure of methanol lines .",
    "it should be obvious that further progress in radio sector is in need of accurate laboratory measurements of the rest frame molecular frequencies .",
    "the required uncertainty of laboratory frequencies is @xmath100  m  s@xmath32 .",
    "there is currently a shortage of such data . among molecules with high sensitivity coefficients to changes in @xmath1 and @xmath0",
    "only nh@xmath60  @xcite and ch  @xcite transitions fulfill this requirement .",
    "in this short review we highlighted the most important observational results which mark the frontier of most precise spectroscopic measurements of line positions in optical and radio sectors aimed at different tests of the variation of fundamental physical constants by astrophysical methods .",
    "current null results from the vlt and keck optical telescopes as well as from different radio telescopes validate the einstein equivalence principle at a rather deep level of @xmath101 for extragalactic sources , and at @xmath70 within the milky way disk .",
    "this is a tremendous step forward in experimental justification of basic principles of the general relativity and the standard model of particle physics as compared with the first astrophysical constraint on @xmath102 towards radio galaxy cygnus  a ( @xmath103 ) obtained 60 years ago by savedoff  @xcite .",
    "it should to be emphasized that both optical and radio methods complement each other and in future will provide independent tests of @xmath8  and @xmath6  variability using the next - generation radio and optical telescopes ."
