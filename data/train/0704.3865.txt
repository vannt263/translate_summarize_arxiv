    "recently , a thorough investigation of the lifshitz point was made by diehl and shpot with the @xmath10-expansion method up to o@xmath11 @xcite ; see also refs .",
    "the field theory for the lifshitz point has an anisotropic dispersion like @xmath12 , preventing us from going beyond order o@xmath11 .",
    "reflecting this anisotropy , the critical indices within the subspaces , @xmath13 ( @xmath2 ) and @xmath14 ( @xmath3 ) , are no longer identical . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the critical indices within each subspace are tabulated systematically for the generic values of @xmath15 .",
    "such an anisotropic criticality is realized by the @xmath16-dimensional ising model fully - frustrated within the @xmath17-dimensional subspace .",
    "the problem is that a naive computer simulation for the equilateral cluster does not yield adequate finite - size scaling .",
    "rather , one has to adjust the shape of the cluster ( that is , the system sizes of each subspace @xmath18 ) so as to fix the following scaled ratio to a constant value ; @xmath19 here , the index @xmath20 denotes the dynamical critical exponent , which characterizes the anisotropy .",
    "the significant point is that the exponent @xmath20 itself is an unknown parameter , and it has to be determined through some preliminary analyses .",
    "after that , one is able to perform large - scale simulations .",
    "so far , the case of @xmath21 , namely , the axial - next - nearest - neighbor - ising model , has been studied extensively by means of the monte carlo method @xcite .",
    "the simulation results are in agreement with the above - mentioned field - theoretical considerations as well as the series - expansion results @xcite .    in this paper , we consider the case of @xmath9 . for that purpose",
    ", we investigate the ground - state phase transition of the gonihedric model in @xmath0 dimensions .",
    "the gonihedric model is a fully frustrated ising magnet with the finely tuned plaquette - type ( four - body and plaquette - diagonal ) interactions , for which the domain - wall surface tension vanishes ; so far , the classical version has been studied in detail @xcite . making a contrast to the frustrated magnetism within the real space ( @xmath2 ) , the quantum fluctuation along the imaginary - time direction ( @xmath3 ) is simply ferromagnetic , and the ground - state criticality should be an anisotropic one . in fig .",

    "this approach may have the following advantages .",
    "first , we implemented novotny s method @xcite to represent the hamiltonian - matrix elements ; this method is readily applicable to the quantum - mechanical system as well @xcite .",
    "owing to this method , we are able to treat an arbitrary number of spins @xmath25 constituting the @xmath26 cluster ; note that conventionally , the number of spins is restricted within @xmath27 .",
    "such an arbitrariness allows us to make a systematic finite - size scaling analysis .",
    "second , the diagonalization method is free from the slowing - down problem ; this problem becomes severe for such a frustrated magnetism , deteriorating the efficiency of the monte carlo sampling .",
    "last , the constraint @xmath28 [ eq .",
    "( [ constraint ] ) ] is always satisfied , because the system size along the imaginary - time direction is infinite @xmath29 ; note that the system size along the imaginary time corresponds to the inverse temperature @xmath30 .    in fairness",
    ", it has to be mentioned that our research owes its basic idea to the following pioneering studies .",
    "first , an equivalence between the @xmath1-dimensional fully frustrated magnetism and the @xmath9 lifshitz point was argued field - theoretically in refs .",
    "second , in ref .",
    "@xcite , the biaxial - next - nearest - neighbor ising model in @xmath31 was studied with the monte carlo method .",
    "it was reported that the lifshitz ( multicritical ) point collapses at zero temperature . on the contrary",

    ", the gonihedric model has finely tuned coupling constants @xmath44 , which cancel out the domain - wall surface tension .",
    "actually , the domain - wall energy of the gonihedric model ( apart from the off - diagonal term @xmath45 ) admits a geometric representation @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "here , @xmath47 denotes the number of points where two domain walls meet at a right angle ( domain - wall undulation ) , and @xmath48 is the number of points where four domain walls meet at a right angle ( self - intersection point ) .",
    "that is , the parameter @xmath32 controls the self - avoidance of the domain walls with the bending elasticity unchanged .",
    "( notably enough , the interfacial energy lacks the surface - tension term .",

    "the gonihedric model has a tunable parameter @xmath32 with the zero surface tension maintained .",
    "this redundancy is an advantage over other frustrated magnetisms such as the biaxial - next - nearest - neighbor ising model .",
    "we survey the regime @xmath33 , where we observed a clear indication of the lifshitz - type criticality .    in this paper",

    "owing to the extension , the magnetic domain wall now acquires a finite domain - wall surface tension @xmath50 . in other worlds , in terms of this extended parameter space , we identify the lifshitz point as a multicritical point ; see the phase diagram in fig .",

    "however , recent developments dwell on the @xmath31 case , aiming at a potential applicability to microemulsions",
    ". the criticality should belong to the lifshitz point with the index @xmath51 , because the classical gonihedric model is isotropically frustrated .",
    "the @xmath51 criticality may be realized by the ternary mixture @xcite of water , oil and surfactant @xcite ; actually , a crossover from the @xmath31-ising universality to an exotic one was reported in refs .",

    "we notice that the phase diagram resembles that of the quantum gonihedric model ; the discrepancy as to @xmath54 is merely due to the difference of parameterization , and the subspace @xmath55 corresponds to the fully - frustrated gonihedric model .",
    "a few remarks on the phase diagram follow : first , the lifshitz point at @xmath55 is identified as an end - point of the critical branch ( @xmath56 ) belonging to the @xmath31-ising universality .",
    "in fact , the multicritical ( crossover ) scaling theory applies successfully @xcite to clarifying the nature of the lifshitz point .",

    "we will accept this cross - over viewpoint as for the quantum gonihedric model .",
    "second , in refs .",
    "@xcite , it was reported that for small @xmath57 , the multicritical point becomes a discontinuous one , accompanied with pronounced hysteresis .",
    "in particular , at @xmath58 , the model reduces to the so - called @xmath59-spin model @xcite , which is notorious for its slow relaxation to the thermal equilibrium ( metastability ) .",
    "we found that a similar difficulty arises in the quantum gonihedric model .",
