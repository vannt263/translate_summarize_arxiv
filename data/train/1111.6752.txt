    "evaporation of colloidal dispersion droplets is a widely - used mechanism to deposit particles onto a substrate and generate colloidal crystals @xcite .",

    "a droplet evaporates , one needs to know the velocity field inside the drying drop @xcite .",
    "the capillary flow inside an evaporating drop is driven by the evaporative mass loss from its surface .",
    "there are three mechanisms which can be rate limiting for the evaporation of a drop @xcite : the transfer of molecules across liquid - air interface , the heat transfer to the interface , or the diffusive transport of the vapour in air .",
    "one of the first two mechanisms can be dominant when thin films of evaporating liquid are considered @xcite , when the surrounding phase is not gas but pure vapour @xcite , or for droplets on heated substrates @xcite . for macroscopic evaporating drops in air , diffusion - limited evaporation",
    "is often assumed , based on estimates of the time scales for transport @xcite . for water drops",
    "there has been some debate about the time scale for transport across the interface , and hence about the applicability of diffusion - limited models @xcite .",
    "experimentally however , the diffusion - based evaporation model is found to describe the evolution of the droplet mass and contact angle of sessile water drops with pinned contact lines very well , for the entire range of possible contact angles @xcite .    here , we will study the flow near the pinned contact line of a macroscopic evaporating drop in air on an unheated substrate , and therefore we consider diffusion - limited evaporation . until now",
    ", the nature of the flow in the vicinity of the contact line has remained unclear . in the diffusion - limited case ,",
    "the singular corner geometry of the droplet close to the contact line gives rise to a diverging evaporative flux and hence to a diverging velocity field @xcite .",
    "this singularity makes analytical and numerical solutions to the velocity field inside a drop difficult to obtain @xcite . in several studies",
    "the flow inside the drop was solved analytically , however , at the expense of smoothing the evaporative flux singularity .",
    "@xcite considered an exponential cut - off for the flux , while @xcite focussed on uniform evaporation profiles . for small contact angles , evaporation - driven flow inside a droplet",
    "is often described in the lubrication approximation @xcite , which compares very well with experimental data @xcite .",
    "it was argued by @xcite however , that the standard lubrication approximation does not hold near the contact - line region due to the diverging evaporative flux .    on top of that , marangoni stresses could alter the velocity field in the vicinity of the contact line : the non - uniform evaporative flux leads to temperature gradients over the drop surface , which give rise to differences in surface tension , and drive a marangoni flow inside the drop , as has been confirmed experimentally by @xcite for octane droplets .",
    "dimensional analysis shows that this marangoni effect is so strong that it can overcome the diverging evaporation - driven outward flow , at least at some distance from the contact line @xcite .",
    "however , for water droplets the marangoni effect is found to be weak @xcite . in piv measurements of the velocity field in an evaporating drop by @xcite the experimental velocities",
    "were of the order of 10 @xmath2 m/s , whereas the marangoni velocities would be of the order of 10 mm / s .    here",
    ", we derive analytical solutions of evaporation - driven stokes flow in a wedge geometry to address the nature of flow near the pinned contact line of an evaporating drop .",
    "while solutions to the full flow pattern in the drop can only be obtained numerically @xcite or for a regularized evaporative flux @xcite , the behaviour in the vicinity of the contact line is characterized by similarity solutions .",
    "this is a classical approach for flows near contact lines that goes back to @xcite and was recently applied to marangoni flow in evaporating drops by @xcite .",
    "we examine the velocity field inside the drop while retaining the singular evaporative flux as a boundary condition .",
    "we demonstrate that for small enough contact angle , the lubrication approximation can be applied all the way down to the contact line , which invalidates the argument of @xcite . for larger contact angles ( above 127@xmath3 )",
    "interesting flow structures appear , with a reversal in the flow direction .",
    "we show that there are three contributions to the total flow in the wedge : one that comes from the evaporative flux boundary condition , one from the downward movement of the liquid - air interface , and one eigenmode solution , which satisfies the homogeneous boundary conditions . which of these conditions is dominant , depends on the contact angle @xmath4 of the drop .",
    "for @xmath5 , the critical angle the evaporative flux solution dominates , whereas for @xmath6 the eigenmode solution dominates .",
    "the solution at the critical point is treated separately .",
    "finally , we comment on the typical pressure in the vicinity of the contact line and on the regularization of the evaporative singularity .",
    "the geometry of the droplet close to the contact line can be approximated by a two - dimensional wedge with contact angle @xmath4 ; see figure [ geom ] .",
    "the contact line is located at the origin of the polar coordinate system @xmath7 .     and base radius @xmath8 .",

    "the problem is closed by the kinematic boundary condition at the liquid - air interface , where mass transfer due to evaporation occurs .",
    "this kinematic boundary condition consists of two contributions .",
    "one contribution comes from the evaporative mass flux from the interface , which drives a flow inside the droplet . due to the evaporative mass loss",
    ", the droplet volume decreases with time . while the contact area of the drop remains constant because the contact line is pinned , the contact angle decreases with time .",
    "this gives rise to a second contribution to the kinematic boundary condition : the downward motion of the liquid - air interface acts like a closing hinge .",
    "hence , the kinematic boundary condition reads    @xmath18    with @xmath9 the evaporative flux and @xmath19 the liquid density .",
    "both contributions in ( [ kinbc ] ) are known in detail from earlier studies @xcite .",
    "the key ingredient is that the mass loss from the droplet is limited by diffusive transport of the water vapour in the air outside the drop . by solving the vapour concentration field outside the droplet",

    "prefactor @xmath30 can be found from the asymptotic behaviour of the full spherical - cap solution @xcite and is of order unity .",
    "the rate of contact angle decrease , @xmath31 , can be determined from the total rate of mass loss from the drop . a closed - form analytical solution for the rate of contact angle decrease was derived by @xcite @xmath32 with @xmath33 .",

    "since ( [ stokes ] ) is a linear equation , the two contributions to the _ inhomogeneous _ boundary condition ( [ kinbc ] ) can be considered separately , whereas the full solution is obtained by superposition . on top of this ,",
    "one may in principle add the classical `` eigenmode '' solution of the homogeneous problem by @xcite , for which all boundary conditions are zero .",
    "hence , we need to consider three types of solutions : the velocity field due to the evaporative flux condition    @xmath37    the velocity due to the moving interface condition    @xmath38    and the flow that satisfies the homogeneous condition    @xmath39    from now on , we will refer to ( [ evap ] ) as the _ flux condition _ , to ( [ move ] ) as the _ hinge condition _",
    ", while the solution satisfying ( [ homo ] ) is the corner _",
    "eigenmode_. note that each of these boundary conditions will give rise to a different power of @xmath40 in the final solution .",
    "the flux condition ( [ evap ] ) scales as @xmath41 , with @xmath42 given by ( [ lambda ] ) , while the hinge condition ( [ move ] ) scales as @xmath40 .",
    "the homogeneous eigenmode solutions turn out to scale with yet another exponent , denoted @xmath43 .",
    "this exponent also depends on @xmath4 , and follows from an eigenvalue equation @xmath44 @xcite , where @xmath45 this equation has a countable infinite number of zeros , each of which corresponds to a different eigenmode ( with the exception of the trivial solutions @xmath46 ) .",
    "the solutions of ( [ determinant ] ) are discussed in great detail by @xcite . for angles @xmath47 ( [ determinant ] ) has complex roots , which causes viscous eddies to appear in the flow @xcite .",
    "we are interested in the lowest root that has @xmath48 , to ensure regularity of the eigenmode velocity .",

    "interestingly , the denominator contains the factor @xmath53 that was previously defined in ( [ determinant ] ) .",
    "we thus need to separately consider the cases where @xmath54 , for which the solution ( [ solutionflux ] ) is not defined .",
    "the function @xmath53 has two obvious roots that are encountered in the flux problem , namely @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "these correspond to cases for which the form ( [ stokessol ] ) is degenerate and additional solutions to the biharmonic equation appear . for @xmath55 ( @xmath57 )",
    "the flux solution becomes    @xmath58    while for @xmath56 ( @xmath59 ) we find    @xmath60    note that these degenerate solutions are a regular limit of ( [ solutionflux ] ) for @xmath61 and @xmath62 , respectively .",
    "in addition to these trivial roots , @xmath53 with @xmath63 exhibits one root that leads to a truly nontrivial solution . this root appears at a critical angle @xmath64 , with corresponding exponent @xmath65 .",
    "the critical point arises when the four boundary conditions are not linearly independent , which implies that the inhomogeneous system can not be solved .",
    "indeed , this is exactly the condition required for a nontrivial ( eigenmode ) solution of the homogeneous problem , namely @xmath44 . as a consequence , the eigenmode solution has the same exponent @xmath66 at the critical angle @xmath67 .",
    "the resulting critical solution is not of the form ( [ stokessol ] ) and will be treated separately in  [ subsec : critical ] .",
    "the hinge condition ( [ move ] ) gives rise to a degeneracy of solution ( [ stokessol ] ) , since in this case @xmath68 .",
    "the solution to ( [ stokes ] ) with the hinge condition is given by @xmath69 with @xmath70 , and @xmath71 hence , ( [ solutionhinge ] ) is defined for all angles , except at @xmath72 and @xmath73 , where @xmath74 . for @xmath4 satisfying @xmath74 , @xmath56 becomes a double root of eigenvalue equation ( [ determinant ] ) .",
    "hence , once more a critical point appears when the eigenmode has the same exponent as the solution of the inhomogeneous hinge problem , i.e. @xmath75 .",
    "we anticipate that this critical point will be of less importance than the critical point for the flux condition , as the latter has a slightly smaller exponent @xmath76 .",
    "the eigenmode represents the nontrivial solution of the homogeneous problem , appearing when @xmath44 .",
    "it reads @xcite    @xmath77    with @xmath78-\\frac{\\sin(\\lambda_e-2)\\theta}{\\sin\\lambda_e\\theta}\\sin[\\lambda_e(\\theta -\\phi ) ] .\\ ] ] the prefactor @xmath79 can not be determined from the `` inner '' stokes flow problem , where we consider only the wedge in vicinity of the contact line .",
    "this is fundamentally different from the prefactors @xmath30 , @xmath80 , which are known from the external boundary conditions on the wedge . in general",
    ", the eigenmode solution will be excited by the far - field flow inside the drop , and is therefore determined on the outer scale @xmath8 .",
    "this is beyond the present , local analysis .",
    "as the only velocity scale in the problem is the one induced by the evaporation , the streamfunction will naturally scale as @xmath52 , and @xmath79 will be of order unity ( with the exception of the critical point ) .",
    "note that ( [ solutioneigenmode ] ) is the classical solution by @xcite , which leads to the famous viscous eddies when @xmath43 has a nonzero imaginary part .",
    "the vanishing denominator of ( [ solutionflux ] ) at @xmath81 and ( [ solutionhinge ] ) at @xmath82 signals the breakdown of the local similarity solution .",
    "such a breakdown of similarity solutions in corner flows has been analysed in great detail by @xcite .",
    "this work considered a pressure - driven flow along a duct which cross - section has a sharp corner , as well as a variation to the hinge problem considered above .",
    "all cases displayed the same scenario : the inhomogeneous boundary conditions can not be fulfilled at a critical angle @xmath67 , due to an overlap with the homogeneous eigenmode . the key result by @xcite is that the critical solution develops logarithmic corrections , of the type @xmath83 .",
    "this can be derived by considering the regular solution , including the eigenmode contribution , in the limit @xmath84 .",
    "we therefore introduce an expansion parameter , @xmath85 , and derive the critical flux solution in the limit @xmath86 . below we discuss in detail the critical point for the flux condition , as it will turn out the most relevant for the evaporation problem . the critical point for the hinge condition",
    "can be treated analogously ; the result is given below .",

    "the logarithm appears due the expansion of @xmath104 , and thus originates from the `` closeness '' of @xmath42 and @xmath43 near the critical point .",
    "the length scale @xmath105 that appears inside the logarithm can not be determined from the current local analysis .",
    "namely , @xmath105 follows from the combination @xmath106 appearing in ( [ eq : crit ] ) .",

    "differences arise in the inhomogeneous contribution , @xmath113 , due to the different boundary conditions .",
    "the complete flow field is obtained by a superposition of the flux , hinge and eigenmode solutions identified above . which of these will be relevant near the contact line depends on the scaling with @xmath40 : the lowest exponent provides the leading order asymptotic contribution .",

    "we can re - examine the influence of the marangoni effect by direct comparison of our results to the solution with a marangoni boundary condition , presented by @xcite . in our case , hence in absence of marangoni stresses , the radial velocity scales as @xmath171 whereas the solution for the marangoni case scales as @xcite @xmath172 where ma@xmath173 the marangoni number , with @xmath174 the specific latent heat of evaporation , @xmath175 the dependence of surface tension on the temperature , and @xmath176 the thermal conductivity of the liquid . for water ,",
    "the marangoni number is of order @xmath177 .",
    "the factors @xmath178 and @xmath179 only appear in the small contact - angle limit , otherwise , the @xmath4-dependent prefactors are of order unity . from ( [ uevap ] ) and ( [ umaran ] ) it is clear that the two expressions have a different power in @xmath129 , and therefore a cross - over length scale exists . below this critical length @xmath180 ,",
    "the lowest power , hence the evaporation - driven solution ( [ uevap ] ) , will dominate , above this length the marangoni - driven flow is dominant .",
    "the cross - over length scale is given by @xmath181 hence , this length scale is of order @xmath182 m for a millimetre - sized droplet , as long as the contact angle is of order 1 .",
    "only for extremely small contact angles , the length scale over which evaporation dominates the marangoni effect becomes comparable to the drop size .",
    "hence , the marangoni - effect should alter the velocity pattern in evaporating droplets significantly , as described by the solutions obtained by @xcite .",
    "the question why this is not observed experimentally for water drops remains , with as possible explanation that it has to do with surface - active contamination which could suppress the marangoni effect @xcite .",
    "we described flow structures inside drops on partially wetting substrates , in cases where the contact line is pinned .",
    "when the contact line is not pinned but free to move , this will lead to an additional velocity field inside the drop , as described by @xcite .",
    "since the stokes flow problem is linear , the moving contact - line solution by @xcite could just be superimposed on our evaporation - driven solution . in that case , two velocity fields that are in opposite direction will arise in the problem : one with a mean flow directed towards the contact line ( for contact angles below @xmath183 ) , driven by the evaporative flux from the drop surface , and one with a mean flow away from the contact line driven by the receding contact line .",
    "since the evaporation - driven velocity field diverges close to the contact line for @xmath24 , it will dominate the solution close to the contact line .",
    "a cross - over length can be defined where both velocity fields cancel each other @xcite .",
    "this length depends on the contact angle and can be as large as 100 @xmath2 m : for small contact angles the entire flow field in the wedge close to the contact line will be dominated by evaporation .",
    "interestingly , the diverging evaporative flux not only leads to a diverging velocity field inside the droplet , but also to a diverging pressure field , which scales as @xmath184 . for water drops , with @xmath185 m/s , @xmath186pa s , @xmath187 m ,",
    "this gives on very small length scales @xmath188 ( @xmath189 m ) that @xmath190 pa .",
    "this pressure is large compared to the laplace pressure @xmath191 pa .",
    "therefore , we expect on small scales ( @xmath192 nm ) some additional curvature of the interface",
    ". this subtle problem has been studied in detail by @xcite : for angles @xmath193 a change in contact angle of about 15@xmath194 was reported . for angles of order unity , however , no significant effect of the evaporation - driven flow on the contact angle was found .",
    "note that , since @xmath195 , the pressure will diverge for all contact angles , since the leading order exponent @xmath196 ( see figure [ totsol ] ) . for @xmath24 , or @xmath23 ,",
    "the evaporation problem is even more singular than the moving contact - line problem by @xcite , for which @xmath197 .",
    "moreover , the introduction of a slip length does not change the pressure exponent given by the evaporative - flux boundary condition , contrarily to the case of a moving contact line of a non - volatile liquid .",
    "finally , it is still an open question what regularizes the radially diverging velocity inside an evaporating drop with a contact angle smaller than @xmath0 . in previous studies , two approaches have been used .",
    "either the evaporative flux singularity is smoothed mathematically @xcite , or by the introduction of a precursor film , which regularizes the singular wedge geometry near the contact line @xcite .",
    "however , for droplets on a hydrophobic substrate , a precursor film is not expected , and a proper explanation for the regularization of the evaporative flux is still lacking .",
    "the large pressure close to the contact line could reduce the vapour concentration , according to the kelvin equation @xcite but for contact angles of order unity the pressure appears insufficient for this effect , even at the nanometre scale . furthermore ,",
    "if the rate at which molecules are transported by diffusion exceeds the rate at which they transfer across the interface , the air just above the droplet is no longer saturated with vapour and the evaporative flux no longer diverges .",
    "we speculate that another option could be that the regularization occurs on the length scale of the mean free path of the water vapour molecules in the surrounding air , which is of the order of 100 nm , and sets a lower bound on the validity of the diffusion problem ."
