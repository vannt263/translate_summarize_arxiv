    "neutrino physics has undergone a true revolution over the last decade , with a large number of experiments of different types providing evidence for neutrino oscillations and thus for physics beyond the standard model .",
    "this has led to new insights into the possibilities for new physics , but while some old questions have been answered , many new questions have emerged @xcite .",
    "an important question that still needs to be resolved is the determination of the neutrino mass hierarchy .",
    "a very large effort has been dedicated to planning new experiments for measuring all neutrino oscillation parameters @xcite .",
    "the mass hierarchy can be determined using matter effects on oscillations inside the earth .",
    "this however requires a long baseline , a very large detector and an intense beam .",
    "in addition , parameter degeneracies have to be resolved using a combination of experiments .",
    "cosmic ray interactions in the atmosphere give a natural beam of neutrinos .",
    "these atmospheric neutrinos in the gev range have been used by the super - kamiokande detector to provide evidence for neutrino oscillations .",
    "the large size of neutrino telescopes such as amanda , icecube and km3net makes possible the detection of a large number of atmospheric neutrino events with a higher energy threshold , @xmath1  gev , even though the neutrino flux decreases rapidly with energy ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "built to detect neutrinos from astrophysical sources , dark matter annihilation , etc .",
    "@xcite , these ice / water cherenkov detectors typically have high detection threshold energy to avoid the large background from atmospheric neutrinos .",
    "since neutrino oscillation effects are quite small at high energies , high energy atmospheric neutrinos provide little information about important issues such as neutrino mass hierarchy , mixing angles , etc .",
    "recently , a low energy extension of the icecube detector has been planned @xcite .",
    "its goal is to significantly improve the atmospheric muon rejection and to extend the icecube neutrino detection capabilities in the low energy domain , possibly to muon energies as low as 5 gev , depending on the density of the photo tubes .",
    "the proposed instrumented volume is 5,000 - 10,000 kton by conservative estimates .",
    "such a low threshold array buried deep inside icecube will open up a new energy window on the universe .",
    "it will search for neutrinos from sources in the southern hemisphere , in particular from the galactic center region , as well as for neutrinos from wimp annihilation , as originally motivated . here",
    "we provide an additional and independent motivation for building such an array , namely to explore neutrino oscillation physics .    in this article",
    "we show that the deep core extension of icecube provides a great opportunity for detailed oscillations studies of atmospheric neutrinos and makes possible the determination of the neutrino mass hierarchy .",
    "this is extremely important given that long baseline experiments with comparable sensitivity might take a very long time to build and collect data , while the icecube deep core will be built in the near future and will accumulate high statistics relatively fast .",
    "our study indicates that for a total mass of the instrumented volume times exposure of 100 mt yr ( roughly equivalent to 20 years of running a 5,000 kton detector , or 10 years of running a 10,000 kton detector in an optimistic scenario ) , neutrino mass hierarchy can be determined at least with @xmath3 confidence level assuming the current best - fit values of the oscillation parameters , and for values of @xmath4 close to the present bound .",
    "we start in section [ sec : oscrev ] with a brief review of what we know about neutrino oscillation parameters and what we expect to learn in the near future .",
    "we also discuss matter effects inside the earth , which play an important role in the analysis . in section",
    "[ sec : analy ] we describe our main analysis and in section [ sec : backs ] we discuss the backgrounds and systematic uncertainties that affect this analysis .",
    "we present the main results in section [ sec : results ] and discuss them in section [ sec : disc ] .",
    "neutrino data from solar , atmospheric , reactor and accelerator experiments is well understood in terms of three - flavour neutrino oscillations .",
    "two @xmath5 values and two ( large ) mixing angles are well determined , while the third mixing angle is limited to be very small .",
    "the cp - violating phase ( @xmath6 ) is completely unconstrained .",
    "in addition , the sign of @xmath7 is also unknown and will be the focus of our study .",
    "the two possibilities , @xmath8 or @xmath9 correspond to two types of neutrino mass ordering , normal hierarchy and inverted hierarchy .",
    "the best fit oscillation parameter values obtained from present data are @xcite : |m^2_31|&=&2.510 ^ -3 ev^2 + m^2_21&= & 8 10 ^ -5 ev^2 + ^22_23&= & 1 + ^22_12&= & 0.45 with 99% cl allowed regions given by : |m^2_31|&&(2.1 - 3.1 ) 10 ^ -3 ev^2 + m^2_21&&(7.2 - 8.9 ) 10 ^ -5 ev^2 + _ 23 & & ( 36 ^ -54^ ) + _ 12 & & ( 30 ^ - 38^ ) [ eq : paramunc ] and @xmath10 for @xmath11 .",

    "this has been dubbed in the literature as the @xmath12 octant ambiguity .    in the near future",
    ", long baseline experiments like minos and opera will improve the current precision on @xmath7 and possibly discover a non - zero value of @xmath4 , if this is close to the present upper limit . in a few years , reactor experiments like doublechooz and dayabay will provide improved sensitivity to @xmath4 .",
    "this information can be used as input in our analysis , reducing some of the parameter uncertainties .    in the past ,",
    "atmospheric neutrinos in the super - kamiokande detector have provided evidence for neutrino oscillations and the first measurements of @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "it is also known that , covering a large range of energies and pathlengths and using matter effects inside the earth , they can be in principle sensitive to sub - dominant neutrino oscillation effects like @xmath4 and the mass hierarchy @xcite .",
    "matter effects  @xcite in long baseline and atmospheric neutrino oscillation experiments depend on the size of the mixing angle @xmath4 which governs the transitions @xmath16 driven by the atmospheric mass squared difference @xmath17 . the effective @xmath4 mixing angle in matter in a two - flavour framework",
    "is given by : @xmath18 where the minus ( plus ) sign refers to neutrinos ( antineutrinos ) , @xmath19 is the electron number density in the medium , @xmath20  ( ev)@xmath21  ( g/@xmath22 ) and @xmath23 , @xmath24 the electron fraction and the density of the medium , the earth interior in our case .",
    "the electron fraction @xmath23 is @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) in the core ( mantle ) and we follow the prem  @xcite model for the earth s density profile .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : mixmatter ] ) implies that , in the presence of matter effects , the neutrino ( antineutrino ) oscillation probability gets enhanced if the hierarchy is normal ( inverted ) .",
    "making use of the different matter effects for neutrinos and antineutrinos seems therefore the ideal way to distinguish among the two possibilities : normal versus inverted mass hierarchy .",
    "matter effects are expected to be important when the resonance condition : @xmath27 is satisfied .",
    "the precise location of the resonance will depend on both the neutrino path and the neutrino energy . for @xmath28  ev@xmath29 and distances of several thousand kilometers",
    "the resonance effect is expected to take place for neutrino energies @xmath30  gev .",
    "the pathlength traveled by atmospheric neutrinos is : @xmath31 where @xmath32  km is the radius of the earth and @xmath33 km is the typical height at which neutrinos get produced in the atmosphere .",
    "the cosine and sine of the nadir angle of the incident neutrino are denoted by @xmath34 and @xmath35 , respectively . since _",
    "upward going _ ( @xmath36 ) atmospheric neutrinos traverse the dense core of the earth , they provide an excellent tool to tackle the neutrino mass ordering .",
    "indeed the idea of exploiting matter effects in atmospheric neutrino oscillations to distinguish the type of hierarchy has been extensively explored in the literature  @xcite . in general , the former studies exploit muon calorimeter detectors , such as monolith  @xcite , minos  @xcite or ino  @xcite in which the muon charge can be determined .",
    "the measurement of the number of positive and negative muons in the @xmath37  gev energy region allows then for a direct extraction of the neutrino mass hierarchy , simply by looking in which channel ( neutrino or antineutrino ) the signal , via matter effects , is enhanced .",
    "however , it has been pointed out , and carefully explored , that the detection of atmospheric neutrinos which have crossed the earth by future planned megaton water cherenkov detectors could also determine the neutrino mass hierarchy , provided the mixing parameter @xmath38 is not very small  @xcite , even when these detectors do not allow for a charge discrimination of the leptons .",
    "the detection of _ low energy _",
    "neutrinos in a higher density photo - multiplier array within the icecube instrumented detector volume opens up the possibility of not only exploring the atmospheric oscillation pattern  @xcite , but also exploring how well the neutrino mass hierarchy could be measured in the _ largest _ water / ice cherenkov detector available in the near future . in the next section we present the details of the analysis proposed here . for our numerical analysis ,",
    "unless otherwise stated , we will use the best fit values quoted earlier in this section for the oscillation parameters .",
    "the icecube detector has the ability to measure separately the muon tracks and electron / tau generated cascades , thus providing good flavour identification in some energy ranges .",
    "this would be extremely useful for an oscillation analysis , especially when searching for sub - dominant effects .",
    "in particular , the atmospheric neutrino sensitivity to the mass hierarchy comes from the matter effects on @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) oscillations and previous studies dealing with water cherenkov detectors have used the electron signal to extract this information . in the low energy range relevant for neutrino oscillations",
    "however , it is extremely hard in icecube ( and even in the deep core array ) to obtain information about neutrino direction and energy for electron cascades .",
    "we thus focus here on the @xmath41-like _ contained _ events produced by the interactions of atmospheric upward going neutrinos in deep ice .",

    "for @xmath57 we use the charged current ( anti)neutrino interaction cross - sections in @xcite .",
    "it is useful to note that in the relevant energy range the anti - neutrino cross - section is smaller than the neutrino cross - section by about a factor of two .",
    "this difference is what allows for the ( statistical ) discrimination between neutrinos and anti - neutrinos and thus between normal and inverted hierarchy in this experiment .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : events ] ) contains the atmospheric electron and muon ( anti ) neutrino fluxes , @xmath58 . for the results presented in this study we use the results from refs .",
    "the atmospheric neutrino fluxes from refs .  @xcite have also been used , and , overall , we obtain a similar difference between the number of muon neutrino induced events for the normal and inverted hierarchies both in energy and @xmath34 . the absolute electron and",
    "muon atmospheric ( anti)neutrino fluxes are found to have errors of @xmath59 in the energy region of interest here  @xcite .",
    "those errors are mostly induced by our ignorance in modeling hadron production , although the situation is expected to improve with harp and mipp data .",
    "the uncertainties quoted above are reduced for the neutrino - antineutrino flavor ratio case  , i.e. for @xmath60 and @xmath61 , where the uncertainty is @xmath62 in the energy range we explore in the current study .",
    "even smaller uncertainties are expected when the muon - to - electron flavor ratio @xmath63 is considered .",
    "we will comment on the impact of the atmospheric neutrino flux uncertainties on our results below , when including systematic uncertainties to our numerical analysis .",
    "the energy of secondary muons from cc interaction in the 10 - 100 gev neutrino energy range of interest here is @xmath64 and @xmath65 , respectively for neutrinos and antineutrinos  @xcite .",
    "we illustrate in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] the expected @xmath41-like _ contained _ events in 5 gev _ muon energy _ bins for a combined detector mass times exposure of 50 mt yr . from left to right , the panels depict the contained @xmath41-like events within the @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 @xmath34 bins .",
    "we assume @xmath69 and @xmath70 along with other best - fit parameters in eq .",
    "( [ eq : paramunc ] ) .",
    "although we used a detector geometry of @xmath71  km height and @xmath72  m radius , all events are contained in these @xmath34 bins except for the highest energy bin : ( 25,30 )  gev .",
    "as we will shortly see , the oscillation signals solely affect the low energy events . thus our results are valid for a variety of detector geometries , only affected by the total instrumented volume times the exposure .    for the first @xmath34 bin used in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] the ( anti)neutrinos are almost vertically upward going and in their way towards the detector they have crossed the high density earth core .",
    "for the other bins ( anti)neutrinos still traverse a significant amount of matter through the earth .",
    "note that a finer angular bin than @xmath73 is not possible because the reconstruction of primary neutrino direction is expected to be poor in this energy range due to the intrinsic spread in charged lepton - neutrino scattering angle .",
    "the resonance is expected to be located at low energies , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : res ] ) , and the maximum difference between normal and inverted hierarchies is observed in the @xmath74  gev energy bin . in higher energy bins ,",
    "the effect is totally negligible .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig1 ] helps understanding the energy and angular bins that should be considered for the numerical analysis developed in the current study .",
    "we will exploit exclusively the first three muon energy bins ( i.e. @xmath75 within the @xmath74  gev , @xmath76  gev and @xmath77  gev energy ranges ) , and three angular bins , i.e. , @xmath34 within the @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 ranges ) .",
    "it is precisely in those bins where the sensitivity to the neutrino mass ordering is significant , and all the muon events are fully contained .",
    "since the atmospheric neutrino spectra are very steep ( @xmath78 in the relevant energy range ) and , as we will discuss next , this energy range also corresponds to a neutrino oscillation maximum , most events are concentrated in the lowest energy bin .",
    "it is thus important to keep the muon energy threshold for detection as low as possible ( between @xmath79 and @xmath80  gev ) to collect large statistics as well as for extracting the neutrino mass ordering .",
    "note that , as discussed above , 5 - 7 gev muon energy threshold corresponds to approximately 10 - 15 gev initial neutrino energy . with a proposed 7 m spacing between phototubes on the deep core strings ,",
    "such a low energy threshold is achievable .",
    "we next discuss the oscillation effects in the event rates in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] .",
    "notice that for the three angular bins illustrated here , the number of @xmath41-like events in the first energy bin is larger for the inverted hierarchy case than for the normal hierarchy case .",
    "the reason for that is due to the presence of matter effects at these zenith angles for @xmath81 s , which are the ones dominating the statistics .",

    ", @xmath86 can be very different for normal and inverted hierarchies ( mostly due to changes in the first term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mixmatter2 ] ) ) .    as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : probs ] , the @xmath91 probability is quite small in the relevant energy range ( negligible for inverted hierarchy ) .",
    "its contribution to the final muon - like event rate is made even smaller by the fact that the atmospheric @xmath92 flux at these energies is much smaller than the @xmath81 flux .",
    "the experiment we are considering is thus mostly exploiting matter effects in the _ disappearance _",
    "@xmath93 channel and therefore is in many ways complementary to the appearance experiments .",
    "while the matter effects are a small correction in the @xmath81 survival probability , they are sufficient to provide a difference between the different mass orderings because of the very large number of events .",
    "note that in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] the difference between event rates for the two hierarchies increases ( although the overall rates decreases ) for @xmath34 bins @xmath67 and @xmath68 compared to the @xmath66 bin .",
    "this is because the resonant matter density for neutrino energies in the first energy bin @xmath94   gev is @xmath875 g/@xmath22 which is lower than the densities that the neutrino crosses if @xmath34 is in the @xmath95 region , but gets closer to the ones in the shallower @xmath34 region .",
    "the main backgrounds to the signal we are exploiting in the current study are atmospheric downward going muons from the interactions of cosmic rays in the atmosphere and tau ( anti)neutrinos from @xmath96 transitions . the cosmic muon background can be eliminated by angular cuts and in the ice cube deep core is significantly reduced compared to the icecube detector .",
    "the tau neutrino background can be included in the analysis as an additional source of @xmath41-like events .",
    "tau ( anti)neutrinos resulting from atmospheric neutrino flavor transitions will produce a @xmath97 lepton by cc interactions in the detector effective volume .",
    "the tau leptons produced have an @xmath98 probability of decaying through the @xmath99 channel .",
    "the secondary muons can mimic muons from @xmath81 cc interactions and must be included in the oscillated signal .",
    "the energy of a @xmath100 needs to be about 2.5 times higher than a @xmath81 to produce , via tau decay , a muon of the same energy .",
    "but the atmospheric neutrino flux has a steeply falling spectrum , so one would expect this tau - induced muon background not to be very large .",
    "it is however significant ( @xmath101 ) due to the fact that , as seen in figure  [ fig : probtau ] , the first maximum in the @xmath102 oscillation probability ( minimum in the @xmath93 survival probability ) falls exactly in the energy range of interest and for a large range the @xmath100 flux can be significantly larger than the @xmath81 flux .",
    "these events significantly change the energy spectrum of the measured muon - like events and contain information about the main oscillation parameters , @xmath103 and @xmath12 .",
    "[ ht ]    the uncertainties in the atmospheric neutrino flux have been discussed in the previous section and they affect the analysis .",
    "it is however possible to use the data itself to improve some of the errors introduced by these effects , by considering energy and angular bins where oscillation effects are not important as a reference and thus canceling out some of these uncertainties in the analysis ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the uncertainties in other oscillation parameters also affect the possibility of determining the neutrino mass hierarchy .",
    "we employ a full three - flavour oscillation analysis .",
    "it is however easy to understand that the solar @xmath5 and mixing angle have almost no contribution .",
    "this is due to the high energy values we are considering , for which even the largest distances traveled by atmospheric neutrinos do not allow the @xmath104 term to become significant .",
    "the present uncertainties in @xmath14 and @xmath12 ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : paramunc ] ) ) will be improved by present accelerator experiments .",
    "in addition , the atmospheric neutrino data in the icecube deep core can be used to extract these parameters independently from the sub - dominant effects , by comparing different angular bins .",
    "the values of @xmath4 and @xmath6 are the most uncertain and usually hardest to disentangle from the mass hierarchy .",
    "a measurement of the @xmath4 mixing angle by the near future reactor experiments would guarantee the possibility of extracting the mass hierarchy from the atmospheric neutrino data in icecube .",
    "we consider in our analysis a range of values for @xmath4 and @xmath6 in order to assess the parameter space for which the neutrino mass hierarchy can be determined .",
    "it is important to emphasize however that the sensitivity to the cp - violating phase @xmath6 and the value of @xmath12 in this experiment is quite small due to the fact that the signal is dominated by the @xmath81 _ disappearance _ channel .",

    "[ ht ]     in figure [ fig : dm31 ] we show the results for the case as in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig6 ] , but here we also marginalize over the value of @xmath14 in the allowed range . the ability to distinguish the hierarchy appears significantly decreased , after using the same 2 d.o.f statistics to define cl .",
    "it is however important to note that we expect the value of @xmath14 to be known with much higher precision on the time scale relevamt for the icecube deep core experiments .",
    "the icecube detector and its proposed deep core array provide a great opportunity for studies of atmospheric neutrinos .",
    "being the largest existing neutrino detector , it will accumulate a huge number of atmospheric neutrino events over an enormous energy range , thus allowing for detailed studies of oscillation physics , earth density , atmospheric neutrino fluxes and new physics . in order to extract all this information it is necessary to use energy and angular distribution information , as well as flavour composition , all possible to obtain with the icecube detector .",
    "qualitatively , there are three main energy intervals and three main angular regions which are sensitive to different types of physics .    at very high energies , above 10 tev",
    ", neutrino interaction cross - sections become high enough that neutrinos going through the earth start getting attenuated .",
    "this effect is sensitive to neutrino interaction cross - sections and to the density profile of the earth .",
    "a measurement of the neutrino flux at these energies can provide a determination of the earth density @xcite which can be used as an experimental input to our analysis , instead of the prem predictions .",
    "the `` intermediate '' energy region , between 50 gev and 1 tev can provide good information about the atmospheric neutrino flux , which can be used to improve the uncertainties in the simulated atmospheric neutrino fluxes .",
    "in our paper we concentrated on the `` low '' energy region , below about 40 gev , where neutrino oscillation effects can be significant .",
    "matter effects inside the earth are very important in this energy range and for non - zero values of @xmath4 resonance effects can strongly enhance / reduce oscillation probabilities .",
    "straight - up - going neutrinos ( @xmath143 ) pass through the core of the earth and are most sensitive to resonant matter oscillations and thus to all sub - dominant neutrino oscillation effects ( @xmath4 , mass hierarchy , cp violation ) .",
    "up - going neutrinos at shallower angles are still sensitive to the `` main '' oscillation effects ( @xmath7 , @xmath12 ) , while the other , sub - dominant contributions become smaller , due to the lower matter densities and shorter pathlengths .    in the present study we have exploited muon neutrinos and antineutrinos with energies in the @xmath144  gev range which have crossed the earth ( i.e. @xmath143 ) . using the @xmath41 like contained",
    "events for an exposure of 100 mton yr in the proposed icecube deep core ice cherenkov detector , the neutrino mass hierarchy could be extracted at the @xmath3 cl if @xmath145 ( @xmath146 when a @xmath129 systematic error is included in the analysis ) regardless of the value of the cp violating phase @xmath6 .",
    "in addition , downgoing neutrinos in the deep core will provide a measurement of the atmospheric neutrino flux , helping enormously in diminishing the systematic uncertainties @xcite .",
    "the icecube deep core array , with muon energy detection threshold of @xmath147  gev could provide the first measurement of the neutrino mass hierarchy if @xmath38 is close to the present upper limit .",
    "this would be possible with an exposure of @xmath148  mt  yr and if systematic errors below 10% can be achieved .",
    "the next generation of long baseline experiments would then have to concentrate only on the extraction of the cp violating phase @xmath6 .",
