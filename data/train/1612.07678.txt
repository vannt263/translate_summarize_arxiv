    "dissipative scalar field theories appear in important problems in classical and quantum physics .",
    "for example in casimir physics there are some special geometries where electromagnetic field can be basically considered as two independent scalar fields .",
    "then these scalar fields should be quantized in the presence of a nonhomogeneous magnetodielectric medium where absorption and dispersion properties are taken into account @xcite . for the classical case one can model the fluctuating media by a collection of scalar fields and study the fluctuation - induced forces among immersed objects in such a medium @xcite .",
    "the main obstacle in quantizing a dissipative field is that a lagrangian or a hamiltonian is required that generate the quantum evolution of the system and this leads to difficulties in implementing the canonical commutation relations if we are not allowed to include a heath bath @xcite .",
    "various approaches to quantize a dissipative system have been introduced . among these approaches ,",

    "starting from a lagrangian based on the caldeira - leggett model one can study the quantum dynamics of a dissipative system by different methods like path integral techniques @xcite , canonical quantization @xcite and phenomenological methods @xcite .",
    "the choice of a particular method to quantize an open quantum system depends on the physical properties of the environment of the main system .",
    "these physical properties are are considered as boundary conditions imposed on the dynamical variables describing the system .",
    "the main purpose of the present article is to investigate the thermal equilibrium properties of a dissipative scalar field in the framework of mean force hamiltonian . in this scheme ,",
    "the thermodynamic equilibrium free energy of the main system is defined as the difference between the free energy of the whole system and free energy of just environment @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian of mean force is in fact an effective hamiltonian to describe the equilibrium properties of the main system @xcite .",
    "here we first quantize a scalar field in the presence of a medium or reservoir linearly coupled to it by modeling the environment as a continuum of non - interacting harmonic oscillators .",
    "then the total system is quantized in the framework of canonical quantization and the total hamiltonian is diagonalized using fano technique @xcite . in the following the memory function or susceptibility function",
    "is defined in terms of the reservoir green s function and coupling function obeying kramers - kronig relations @xcite . by making use of the hamiltonian of the mean force , the",
