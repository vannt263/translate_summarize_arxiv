    "the advent of high energy observatories like _ integral _ and _ swift _ has provided greater depth to the study of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , as they provide information on spectral features which can not be explored without observations performed above 10kev .",
    "the high energy data are crucial not only to estimate the slope of the continuum emission over a wide energy band but also to measure the high energy cut - off and the reflection fraction , which are important physical parameters .",
    "firstly , they are important parameters for evaluating the agn contribution to the cosmic x - ray background ( cxb ) ; indeed , while the fraction of the resolved cxb into discrete sources is 100% determined below 2 - 10kev , 50% in the 7 - 10kev band , it becomes negligible at higher energies i.e. above 10kev , just where its spectral intensity peaks at around 30kev . in order to reproduce the shape of the cxb , synthesis models ( e.g. @xcite )",
    "use several parameters such as the fraction of heavily obscured sources , the so - called compton thick agn characterized by n@xmath510@xmath6@xmath7 , the coverage and the geometry of the cold gas distributed around the black hole responsible for the reflection hump , and the high energy cut - off of the primary continuum emission , which is not well determined .",
    "recently , for the estimation of the agn contribution to the cxb , several models have been proposed @xcite which take into account the average power - law photon index ( and its standard deviation in values ) and the spread of the average cut - off energy instead of the single mean values .",
    "therefore , the determination of photon indices and cut - off energies , their mean values and their distributions over a wide sample of sources , covering a wide range of energies ( above 100kev ) , is essential to obtain a much firmer estimation of the agn contribution to the cxb at high energy .",
    "measuring the slope of the continuum emission and the high energy cut - off of agn is also important because both parameters enable us to understand the physical characteristics and the geometry of the region around the central nucleus .",
    "agn spectral models that focus on the reproduction of the observed shape of the primary continuum ascribe the power - law to the inverse compton scattering of soft photons off hot electrons located above the accretion disk in the so - called corona @xcite . in the framework of this disk - corona system ,",
    "the temperature kt@xmath2 and the optical depth @xmath3 of the scattering electrons mainly determine the spectral slope , while the cut - off energy is related essentially to kt@xmath2 , thus simultaneous measurements of @xmath0 and e@xmath8 allow us to understand the physical parameters of the comptonizing region .",
    "the more accurate the measurements on these parameters , the better we can determine the geometry and the physical properties of the inner region of the agn .",
    "up to now , several studies have been carried out to specify the distribution of the photon indices both in the soft 210kev @xcite and hard 20100kev x - ray bands @xcite while , after early results coming in the 1990s from the _ bepposax _ which had a broad spectral coverage ( 2100kev ) , measurements of high energy cut - offs have been limited by the scarcity of observations above 10kev .    with the launch of _ integral _ and",
    "_ swift _ the number of agn detected above 10kev has grown enormously but to properly measure the high energy cut - off , a broad - band spectral study is needed .",
    "this implies that both low and high energy spectra have to be fitted simultaneously employing spectra with high statistical quality such as those acquired , for example , with _",
    "xmm - newton _ and _ integral_. it has been demonstrated @xcite that the match between _ xmm _ and _ integral _ spectra is good with a cross - calibration constant between the two instruments around 1 . therefore , when a constant different from unity is found , this generally indicates flux variations between the soft and the hard x - ray domain .",
    "+ in this letter we report on the high energy cut - off measurements and their distribution , derived from the analysis of _ xmm _ plus _ integral / ibis _ and _ swift / bat _ data of all 41 seyfert 1 galaxies out of the 88 sources listed in the _ integral _ complete sample of agn @xcite .",
    "in this work we have performed 0.3 - 100 kev spectral analysis of all type 1 seyfert galaxies included in the _ integral _ complete sample of agn , excluding only 5 narrow line seyfert 1 galaxies which were extensively studied by @xcite .",
    "for all 41 agn we have collected _ xmm - newton _ observations in the soft band and _ integral / ibis _ plus _ swift / bat _ observations in the hard x - ray domain .",
    "epic - pn @xcite data were processed using the _ xmm - newton _ standard analysis software ( sas ) version 12.0.1 employing the latest available calibration files and following the spectral data reduction as in @xcite .",
    "since our sources are bright in x - rays , several of them were affected by pile - up and for them only patterns corresponding to single events ( pattern = 0 ) were considered .",
    "the _ integral _ data reported here consist of isgri data from several pointings between revolutions 12 and 530 , i.e. those coming from the fourth ibis catalogue @xcite .",
    "isgri data analysis and the average source spectra extraction has been obtained following the procedure described by @xcite . the swift / bat spectra @xcite , taken in order to improve the statistics at high energies , are from the latest 70-month catalogue . ibis and",
    "bat analysis has been performed in the 20 - 100 kev and 14 - 100 kev band , respectively .",
    "it is worth noting that the broad - band spectral analysis of a large fraction of our objects has been previously reported in @xcite , but _ xmm _ and/or _ swift / bat _ data were available at that time only for a limited number of agn and the rest had a significantly poorer spectral quality at low energies . for 3 sources ( ngc 3783 , ic 4329a and igr j21247 - 5058 ) we do not perform a new spectral fitting and use the values in @xcite .",
    "this is due to the fact that : a ) we already had good constraints on the spectral shape and b ) the data have been recently confirmed by _ suzaku _",
    "( ngc 3783 , @xcite ; igr j21247 - 5058 @xcite ) and _ nustar _ ( ic 4329a @xcite ) .",
    "+ we fitted simultaneously the soft and the hard x - ray spectra obtained by _",
    "xmm _ and _ integral / ibis_-_swift / bat _ in the 0.3100kev energy range , using ` xspec ` v.12.8.0 , with errors quoted at 90% confidence level for one parameter of interest ( @xmath9 = 2.71 ) . to fit the 0.3100kev continuum , we considered a baseline model commonly used to fit broad - band x - ray spectra , composed of an exponentially cut - off power - law reflected from neutral matter ( ` pexrav ` model in ` xspec ` ) , where r , defined as @xmath10/2@xmath11 , is the parameter which corresponds to the reflection component .",
    "since we are analyzing type 1 sources , we have assumed a face - on geometry and fixed the inclination angle of the reprocessor to 30@xmath12 .    at soft energies",
    "galactic absorption has always been considered and , when required by the data , intrinsic absorption in terms of simple or / and complex , cold or ionized absorbers have been added ( ` wabs , pcfabs , zxipcf ` ) . since the low energy part of type 1 agn spectra often shows clear signs of a soft excess , this has been generally fitted with a thermal component ( ` bremss ` ) when present .",
    "a gaussian component has also been included , to take into account the presence of the iron k@xmath13 line at around 6.4kev ; in a few cases , residuals around 7kev have also been fitted adding a second gaussian line to take into account the iron k@xmath14 feature .",
    "finally , to take into consideration possible flux variations between instruments , we have introduced cross - calibration constants which we left free to vary , keeping in mind that possible mis - calibration between _",
    "xmm _ and _ ibis _ or _ bat _ could mimic or hide the compton reflection component above 10kev @xcite . in the cases of ngc 4151 , ngc 4593 and 4c 74.26 , the fit has been performed over a more restricted energy range ( 2100kev ) , in order to avoid complications due to low energy features , such as the complex warm absorber , whose treatment is beyond the scope of this work . here",
    "we focus on the primary continuum parameters , i.e. photon index and cut - off energy and to properly interpret these results we also report the low energy components ( soft - excess and absorption ) . for completeness we list calibration constants and goodness of fit ( see table 1 ) .",
    "since the primary aim of the present letter is to study the cut - off measurements and to determine their distribution , we will not report the whole spectral parameters , such as reflection fraction and iron line features , and defer to an upcoming work the discussion on the spectral complexity of each type 1 agn of the _ integral _ complete sample .    as shown in the table , there are 6 sources where , in order to have a good broad - band fit , it has been necessary to fix the photon index to the best fit value found using the _ xmm _ data alone ; in five of them both the values of the _ bat _ and _ ibis _ cross - calibration constants are consistent with unity , indicating that the continuum shape at energies above 20kev is consistent with that in the 210kev band .",
    "instead in leda 168563 the a cross - calibration constant between _ xmm _ and _ bat _ is in the range [ 0.530.65 ] , probably due to variability status of the source at high energy as the difference between the _ bat _ and _ ibis _ 20100kev fluxes suggests ( f@xmath15 = 3.8@xmath16 10@xmath17erg@xmath7s@xmath18 and f@xmath19 = 5.3@xmath16 10@xmath17erg@xmath7s@xmath18 ) . for b3 0309 + 411b and igr j18027 - 1455",
    "we have used only the _ bat _ data for the 20100kev band , since the former source has been detected by _",
    "ibis _ in a burst map ( see @xcite ) and the latter has been found to be extremely variable ( see @xcite ) ; in both cases , the extrapolation of the high energy spectrum from the 210kev band gave a source status more consistent with the _ bat _ measurement and hence we chose not to use the _ ibis _ data .",
    "only for igr",
    "j18249 - 3243 is there no _ bat _ observation available ; moreover , this source has also been detected by _",
    "ibis _ by means of the burst analysis , so the overall _ isgri _ spectrum , extracted from the 4@xmath20 _ ibis _ catalogue is of very poor quality ( @xmath21 3@xmath22 ) .",
    "therefore for this source the spectral parameter values should be taken with some caution .",
    "care should also be used for igr j16119 - 6039 , as this galaxy is inside the norma cluster ( a3627 ) and thus , as already pointed out by ajello et al ( 2010 ) , we should expect contamination from the cluster thermal emission in the high energy spectrum of this source .",
    "in table 1 we report the fit results only for the spectral parameters which are of interest in this work ; the goodness of our fits ( see last column in the table ) is expressed in terms of reduced @xmath23 and , as a further indication , we also report the values of the two cross - calibration constants between _ xmm _ and _ bat _ and between _ xmm _ and _ ibis _ , which are generally both close to unity , with the exception of a few variable sources ( e.g. ngc 4151 , mcg+08 - 11 - 011 ) .    in this letter",
    "we report and discuss the general properties of primary continuum parameters , photon index and high energy cut - off , for a large number of type 1 agn .",
    "we calculated their average values using the arithmetic mean and study their distribution using the standard deviation .",
    "we choose to adopt this simple approach because of the extreme non - gaussianity of the data points and their asymmetric errors , which can be ignored in our analysis . in figure  [ fig1 ]",
    "is shown the distribution of photon indices of the entire sample . the solid line at @xmath0 = 1.73 represents their mean value , while the dashed lines indicate the relative spread of 0.17 .",
    "this mean value is consistent with that previously found in @xcite ( @xmath24 = 1.72 , spread 0.2 ) and with the mean photon index of @xmath24 = 1.73 ( spread 0.45 ) obtained for 156 radio - quiet , x - ray unobscured agn analysed in the 210kev band for the _ xmm_-caixa catalogue by @xcite . it is worth noting that the xmm - caixa is the catalogue most compatible with our sample as it contains bright agn similar to ours , further it must be emphasised that their mean photon index value has been obtained assuming the presence of the reflection component , as done in our work .",
    "it is clear from the figure that the majority of sources fall in the range 1.42.1 and that the mean photon index is slightly flatter than 1.9 which is the standard value generally assumed for type 1 agn .    of the 41 type 1 agn analysed in this work ,",
    "we have been able to constrain the cut - off energy in 26 of them , which corresponds to @xmath2163% of the entire sample . in four sources ( b3 0309 + 411b , ngc4593",
    ", 2e 1739.11210 and igr j182493243 ) the cut - off energy is found at energies much higher than the _ ibis / bat _ bandpass and so could not be estimated ; for the remaining 11 sources only lower limits are available .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] represents the main result of the present work , as it shows the distributions of e@xmath1 .",
    "the mean value of the cut - off energy is 128kev with a spread of 46kev and its distribution ranges from 50kev to 200kev , confirming the previous results of @xcite .",
    "also the majority of the lower limits are below 300kev with only a few exceptions ( igr j131095552 , igr j174883253 and mcg0258022 ) .",
    "the few lower limits found above 300 kev indicate that higher cut - off energies may be present but only in a small number of agn .",
    "however , as we only have data up to 100 kev these lower limits resulting from the fits must be treated with some caution .",
    "it is clear that the cut - off energy in type 1 agn has a mean value lower than previously found ( e.g. @xcite ) and more in line with the first results coming from nustar ( see matt 2013 and @xcite ) .",
    "we can use the results on photon indices and cut - off energies to test a possible correlation between them . in the past",
    "a trend of e@xmath1 increasing with @xmath0 steepening has been found @xcite , but it is still debated since it is well known that a degeneracy exists between the photon index and the high energy cut - off in the spectral model employed .",
    "the high energy cut - offs measured for our sample are plotted against their respective photon indices in figure  [ fig3 ] , but no evident trend is found between these two quantities .",
    "this has also been confirmed by using the pearson statistical test on the two sets of data .",
    "the test returns a low correlation coefficient of",
    "_ _ r__@xmath210.16 ( if upper limits are ignored _ r _ is 0.12 ) ; we point out that the errors on the parameters are not considered in this test .",
    "the lack of any correlation between the primary continuum parameters indirectly tests the results of our data analysis confirming that the parameter degeneracy does not affect our fitting procedure .    finally , in order to show the goodness of our fit , in figure 4 we plot of the cross - calibration constants between xmm and bat ( _ c@xmath15 _ ) versus xmm and ibis ( _ c@xmath19 _ ) .",
    "the good match between the two cross - calibration constants is quite clear , despite the fact we would have expected some variations between _ c@xmath15 _ and _ c@xmath19 _ , being both datasets averaged over different observation time .",
    "this confirms that long term variability is not so common at high energies in type 1 agn @xcite .",
    "we found mean values of 0.97 with spread of 0.31 and 1.07 with spread of 0.33 for _ c@xmath15 _ and _ c@xmath19 _ , respectively .",
    "in the present work we have been able to determine the main parameters of the primary continuum : @xmath0 and e@xmath1 .",
    "following @xcite , within this scenario , we can obtain the actual physical parameters of the comptonizing region from these spectral components .",
    "the plasma temperature kt@xmath2 is estimated as kt@xmath2=e@xmath1/2 , when the optical depth @xmath3@xmath251 , while for @xmath3@xmath261 kt@xmath2=e@xmath1/3 would be more correct . using the following relation from @xcite : @xmath27 and knowing the temperature , we can calculate the optical depth assuming the spectral index derived from the ` pexrav ` fit .",
    "we have previously estimated that the mean value of e@xmath1 for our sources is @xmath21130kev , ranging from 50 to 200kev ; note that higher cut - off energies may be present but only in a small number of agn , as also indicated by some of the lower limits found . taking into account the most likely range of e@xmath1 estimated for our sample",
    ", we have derived the most probable range of plasma temperatures kt@xmath2 which is from 20 to 100 kev ( or 2 - 12 @xmath1610@xmath28k ) . assuming our average value of @xmath0=1.73 and solving the equation for both low and high values of @xmath3 and e@xmath1 , we get acceptable solutions for @xmath3 in the range 1 to 4 .",
    "these results are in good agreement with those previously found by @xcite for a small sample of seyfert 1 galaxies and with those found by @xcite and indicate that the plasma has a typical temperature of ( 50@xmath2930)kev and an optical depth of @xmath3@xmath44 .",
    "our findings on the high energy - cut - off are consistent with the synthesis models of the cxb which often assume an upper limit of @xmath21200kev .",
    "this assumption is essentially determined by the intensity and shape of the cxb spectrum above 20 - 30kev , which can not be exceeded .",
    "in fact if one uses a value of e@xmath1 of 300kev it becomes difficult to accommodate all available observations and cxb measurements @xcite .",
    "in this work we presented the broad - band spectral analysis of 41 type 1 agn of the _ integral _ complete sample by fitting together _ xmm _ , _ swift / bat _ and _ integral / ibis _ data in the 0.3100kev energy band .",
    "we found that the mean photon index is 1.73 ( standard deviation of 0.17 ) confirming previous results from _ xmm _ and _ integral_. the main result of this work is that for the first time we provide the high energy cut - off distribution for a large sample of type 1 agn : 26 objects out of 41 analysed which corresponds to 63% of sample .",
    "we found a mean value of @xmath4 e@xmath1 @xmath30 of 128kev with a spread of 46kev indicating that the primary continuum typically decays at much lower energies that previously thought .",
    "we note that this mean value is in line with the synthesis models of the cosmic diffuse background which often assume an upper limit of @xmath21200kev and emphasize that some of the same of the cut - offs measurements reported here are now being confirmed by _",
    "it is worth noting that nustar will be hugely advantageous for this science with its high s / n , but only for sources with a relatively low cutoff , i.e. , @xmath25 150 kev or so .",
    "the precision of the measurement of a rollover above this energy would be compromised due to nustar s lack of effective area above 79 kev . from the primary continuum parameters we have indirectly estimated the plasma conditions surrounding the black holes , which in our sample has typically a temperature in a range 20 - 100kev and an optical depth @xmath3@xmath44 .",
    "a more direct estimate of the electron plasma temperature and corona optical depth in agn will be provided in the near future by _",
    "observations , which cover a broad band from 379 kev with much higher sensitivity than _ integral / swift_. indeed _ nustar _ will be able to constrain all agn spectral parameters ( @xmath0 , e@xmath1 and r ) contemporaneously with great accuracy as has recently been demonstrated @xcite .                                    , l. , & haardt , f. 1997 , in astronomical society of the pacific conference series , vol . 121 , iau colloq . 163 : accretion phenomena and related outflows , ed .",
