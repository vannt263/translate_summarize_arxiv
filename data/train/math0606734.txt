    "the subject of this paper is codes in spherical caps , i.e. , packings of a metric ball on the surface of the sphere in @xmath0 ( a spherical cap ) with metric balls ( caps ) of a smaller radius .",
    "codes in spherical caps are related to more familiar spherical codes and find a number of interesting applications in both classical and recent works .",
    "spherical cap codes have been used to derive an asymptotic upper bound on the maximum size of spherical codes and a bound on the packing density @xmath1 of the @xmath2-space by equal spheres , see sidelnikov @xcite , kabatiansky and levenshtein @xcite and levenshtein @xcite .",
    "more recently they have been used to derive upper bounds on the size of binary constant weight codes , see agrell , vardy and zeger @xcite .",
    "even more recently , estimates of the maximum size of codes in a spherical cap have been used together with an extension of delsarte s method to derive new estimates of the kissing number @xmath3 in small dimensions . in particular , a long - standing conjecture that @xmath4 was solved in @xcite and a related problem for `` one - sided kissing numbers '' was solved in dimension 4 in @xcite .    in this paper we focus on the study of spherical cap codes rather than on their applications in related geometric problems of coding theory .",
    "more specifically , we study bounds on the size of spherical cap codes with a given angular separation and their relation to spherical codes .",
    "in section [ sect : ls ] we recall a few known bounds on the size of codes in a spherical cap and spherical strip . in section [ sect : extension ] we formulate an extension of delsarte s bound on the size of spherical codes to cover the case of spherical caps . as usual , the polynomial involved in the computation of the bound must be expandable in a linear combination of gegenbauer polynomials with nonnegative coefficients .",
    "a new condition in the theorem relates the values of the polynomial to constructions of codes in a spherical cap .",
    "the method described was used in @xcite to prove that @xmath5 this link serves as an additional motivation for studying spherical cap codes .",
    "in section [ sect : large ] we show that in the case of large code distance , the size of a code in a spherical cap can be exactly expressed via the size of codes on the entire sphere .",
    "the result is used to relate the size of spherical cap codes with the kissing number @xmath6 we consider examples of small dimensions @xmath7 and illustrate the application of the extended delsarte s method to the derivation of the values of @xmath3 in these cases .    in section [",
    "sect : bound ] we derive a new bound on the size of spherical cap codes that relies on a transformation from codes in caps to codes on the hemisphere . in the same section",
    "we also address the problem of the maximum size of spherical cap codes in the case of large dimensions .",
    "a common perception in coding theory , originating with the asymptotic results of @xcite is that codes in spherical caps are analogous to constant weight binary codes ( i.e. , codes formed of vectors with a fixed number of ones ) .",
    "constant weight codes possess a rich combinatorial structure related to the properties of the johnson graph @xcite ; however , no similar theory has arisen for the spherical case .",
    "we provide an explanation of this by showing that the asymptotic problem of constructing spherical cap codes is equivalent to the analogous problem for codes on the entire sphere .",
    "section [ sect : hemi ] is devoted to a particular case of cap codes , namely codes in hemispheres .",
    "we derive an upper bound on the size of such codes and use it to derive estimates of a parameter closely related to @xmath8 the so - called one - sided kissing number @xmath9 we derive estimates of @xmath10 for @xmath11 and make a conjecture about the exact values for some of these cases .    in section [ sect",
    ": omega ] we use the method of section [ sect : hemi ] to derive another upper bound on spherical cap codes that often improves the result of section [ sect : bound ] .",
    "we show in examples that the bounds derived in this paper are sometimes better than the previously known results . in section [",
    "sect : lp ] we present a general approach to bounding the size of codes in spherical caps that combines several features of the methods introduced earlier in the paper .",
    "we conclude with a brief discussion of applications of the bounds on cap codes .",
    "let @xmath12 be a unit sphere in @xmath2 dimensions and let @xmath13 be the `` north pole . ''",
    "let @xmath14 denote by @xmath15)=\\{x\\in s^{n-1}|\\ ,                  \\cos\\phi\\le\\langle x , e_n\\rangle\\le\\cos\\psi\\}\\ ] ] a strip cut on the sphere by two planes perpendicular to the vector @xmath16 in particular , @xmath17)$ ] is a spherical cap with angular radius @xmath18 drawn about @xmath19 .",

    "below by @xmath21 we denote the angular distance between two points on the sphere .",

    "@xmath35 is equal to the number of nonoverlapping unit spheres that can touch the sphere @xmath12 and is called the _ kissing number _ in dimension @xmath2 .",
    "the problem of finding or bounding @xmath3 has a rich history @xcite .    likewise , the quantity @xmath36 is called the _ one - sided _ kissing number . the one - sided kissing number problem was considered recently in @xcite .",
    "@xmath10 has the following geometric meaning .",
    "let @xmath37 be a closed half - space of the @xmath2-dimensional euclidean space .",
    "suppose that @xmath38 is a unit sphere in @xmath37 that touches the supporting hyperplane of @xmath37 .",
    "the one - sided kissing number @xmath10 is the maximal number of unit nonoverlapping spheres in @xmath37 that can touch @xmath38 .",
    "the function @xmath34 has received considerable attention in the literature .",
    "therefore , one possible avenue of studying spherical cap codes is to map them on the sphere or hemisphere and relate them to spherical codes . in this paper , we rely on a number of mappings between spheres , spherical caps , and spherical strips to estimate the maximum size of a code in a spherical cap .",
    "some of them have been used earlier in the literature while the others have not been emphasized in the context of estimating the code size .",
    "the main problem addressed here is to design the mappings so that the distance between the images of two points in the domain can be bounded in terms of the original distance .",
    "one often - used map is the orthogonal projection @xmath39 which sends the point @xmath40 along its meridian to the equator of the sphere , i.e. , the set of points on @xmath12 with @xmath41 ( @xmath39 is defined on @xmath12 without the north and south poles ) .",

    "several estimates on the size of spherical cap codes have previously appeared in the literature .",
    "they connect the maximum size of codes in a spherical cap , and more generally , in a spherical strip and on the entire sphere .",
