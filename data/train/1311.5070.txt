    "spintronics is considered a potential follow - up technology to purely charge - based electronics . in spintronic devices ,",
    "both charge and spin of electrons are used as information carriers leading to faster switching at lower energy consumption compared to charge - based electronics .",
    "half - metallic ferromagnets ( hmfs ) represent the optimal materials for spintronics @xcite as their conduction electrons are expected to be 100% spin polarized .",
    "heusler compounds with @xmath2 type structure represent an especially favorable family of predicted hmf compounds and seem to offer all necessary ingredients for their implementation in spintronic devices such as high spin polarization @xcite , high curie temperatures @xcite , and a low gilbert damping constant @xcite . however , the observation of the required key spintronic properties in heusler compounds crucially depends on the type and degree of structural ordering @xcite .    nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( nmr ) allows one to probe the local environments of @xmath3co nuclei in co - based heusler bulk and film samples , and thus enables characterization of local order and quantification of different structural contributions as well as off - stoichiometric composition @xcite .",
    "such a local probe of structure and composition is very useful as compounds comprising elements from the same periodic row ( e.g.  co and fe ) have very similar scattering factors for x - rays , and thus , x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) only may not be sufficient to resolve the structural ordering unambiguously @xcite .",
    "in addition to information on the chemical , crystallographic environments , nmr techniques are useful to determine the magnetic state of a ferro- or ferrimagnetic material . the restoring field ( @xmath4 ) is an effective magnetic field originating from a resistance to magnetic oscillations , and therefore is proportional to the square root of the optimal power ( i.e. the power producing the maximum spin - echo intensity ) of the applied rf pulses during an nmr experiment .",
    "@xmath4 derived in nmr experiments provides a measure of magnetic stiffness or magnetic anisotropy on a local scale , compared with the macroscopic domain wall stiffness contributing to the coercive fields from squid magnetometry @xcite .",
    "the advantage of nmr is that we can measure at a given frequency and can thus relate the magnetic stiffness to a specific local magnetic environment ( e.g.  phase or structure ) .",
    "a particular interesting heusler compound to be mentioned in the context of hmf is co@xmath0feal@xmath1si@xmath1 .",
    "band structure calculations predict a high stability of the minority bandgap in this compound @xcite .",

    "we characterize the local crystallographic and magnetic structure of those films as a function of film thickness using nmr .",

    "details about growth and characterization are found elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the nmr experiments were performed at 5  k in an automated , coherent , phase sensitive , and frequency - tuned spin - echo spectrometer ( _ nmr service _ erfurt , germany ) .",
    "we used a manganin coil wrapped around the sample to apply and pick up the rf pulses .",
    "this coil is implemented in an lc circuit with three capacitors .",
    "the nmr spectra were recorded at 5  k in the frequency ( @xmath10 ) range from 104 - 254  mhz in steps of 0.5  mhz in zero magnetic field .",
    "all nmr spectra shown here were corrected for the enhancement factor as well as for the @xmath11 dependence , resulting in relative spin - echo intensities which are proportional to the number of nuclei with a given nmr resonance frequency @xcite .",
