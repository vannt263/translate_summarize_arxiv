    "in the past few months , the study of m2-branes was revived , initiated by bagger and lambert @xcite and gustavsson @xcite , in which the world - volume theory of two m2-branes was discovered . however , because the old bagger - lambert - gustavsson ( blg ) theory @xcite relies on a special form of 3-algebra , it is difficult to be generalized to arbitrary number of m2-branes @xcite . under certain conditions , the @xmath5 algebra in the old blg theory is unique and there is a no - go theorem @xcite .",
    "one can get around such a no - go theorem by relaxing the conditions @xcite .",
    "switching from euclidean 3-algebra to lorentzian 3-algebra , three groups @xcite showed a possible way for generalization . around a month later , aharony et al .",
    "@xcite opened another possibility .",
    "not restricted to 3-algebra , they turn to consider chern - simons - matter theories with a @xmath1 or @xmath6 gauge symmetry . in fact , the old blg theory can be reformulated into an @xmath7 theory @xcite .",
    "what is more , it was shown long ago that the gauge group @xmath1 plays an important role in the infrared limit of @xmath4 coincident d3-branes at a conical singularity @xcite . therefore , an @xmath6 aharony - bergman- jafferis - maldacena ( abjm ) theory , as a 3-dimensional superconformal chern - simons - matter theory , is a very attractive world - volume theory of @xmath4 coincident m2-branes .",
    "given that the old blg theory is difficult for generalization , although abjm s @xmath0 chern - simons - matter theories do not rely on 3-algebra , it is still appealing to recast them in terms of a certain 3-algebra , in hopes that it may told us how to better overcome the no - go theorem @xcite .",
    "this was elegantly accomplished by bagger and lambert as reported in @xcite recently , which we will call the new bl theory .    in this little exercise ,",
    "we reduce the @xmath0 @xmath8 chern - simons gauge theories to @xmath3 yang - mills gauge theories .",
    "we find the resulting theories have @xmath2 supersymmetry , or 16 real supercharges .",
    "we will review abjm theories in section [ review ] , and then in section [ higgs ] show the details of higgs mechanism for the present case .",
    "finally , in section [ conclusion ] , we will comment on how to apply our scheme to the new bl model generally and conclude .",
    "after integrating out auxiliary fields and combining the @xmath20 fields into an @xmath9 representation , @xmath21 one can write down the total action of abjm s @xmath0 , @xmath1 chern - simons gauge theories as @xcite @xmath22.\\ ] ] in the above action , the covariant derivative is defined by @xmath23 note that the notation @xmath19 with a tilde here is different from @xmath18 which will appear later .",
    "the chern - simons term is @xmath24 there is a potential like a yukawa term , by which scalars and fermions are coupled @xmath25 the sextic potential of scalars takes the form @xmath26",
    "in this section , we reduce the @xmath1 chern - siomons theories reviewed in the previous section into @xmath3 yang - mills theories .",
    "this process corresponds to recovering the world - volume theory of @xmath4 d2-branes from that of @xmath4 m2-branes .",
    "our main scheme is exactly in accordance with @xcite .",
    "firstly recast the gauge fields as ) was also made by the reference @xcite , which partly overlapped with our plan .",
    "what is more , actually the scaling limit taken in @xcite is equivalent to the limit @xmath27 in our scheme .",
    "anyhow we decided to finish this little exercise to obtain more details . ] @xmath28 and then integrate out the auxiliary field @xmath29 using its equation of motion . at the same time , take the vacuum expectation value to be @xmath30 and other components vanished .",
    "@xmath31 denotes our choice of the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) . in the following",
    ", @xmath32 denotes the choice in @xcite .",
    "we should stress here @xmath31 is real in spite of the fact that @xmath33 is a complex variable .",
    "the yang - mills coupling is defined by . at first glance",
    ", it contradicts with the relation ( [ gym ] ) .",
    "however , this disagreement is understandable because the normalizations are different . by the replacement @xmath34",
    ", one can change from their normalization to ours and recover ( [ gym ] ) . in the last step of ( [ gym ] )",
    ", we have used the quantization condition @xmath11 . ] @xmath35 as explained in @xcite . as did in @xcite",
    ", we have to rescale some of the components of @xmath36 and @xmath37 as @xmath38 and keep only leading order terms with respect to @xmath39 .",
    "in other words , we have to take the limit @xmath40 , @xmath27 with @xmath41 fixed .",
    "one possible interpretation of this limit is illustrated by figure 1 .    .",
    "in the rest of our paper , we will see that @xmath42 is a typical energy scale , below which our reduction is meaningful . according to the definition of @xmath41 , @xmath43 . since in reference",
    "@xcite @xmath44 is also related to physical mass scale , we see again that these two descriptions are equivalent .",
    "so taking the limit @xmath40 makes the cone become a fine cylinder .",
    "it is the usual picture that by compactifying the @xmath45 , m - theory is reduced to the type iia string theory.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    many of the techniques employed here can be found in @xcite . in reference",
    "@xcite , a precise relation between abjm model and lorentzian blg model was studied .",
    "since the lorentzian blg model is intimately related to d2 branes , our will partly overlap with the analysis there . in their analysis",
    ", they promoted the coupling constant to a spacetime dependent vector and recovered the @xmath46 invariance .",
    "since our aim is to get the world - volume theory of d2-branes , we will take @xmath31 to be spacetime independent and get the @xmath47 symmetry .",
    "first of all , we decompose fields as @xmath48 here @xmath33 and @xmath49 are complex variables , @xmath50 and @xmath51 are complex with two components , while @xmath52 is a real variable .",
    "let us also introduce @xmath53    making use of @xmath54+i\\{b_{\\mu},y^{a}\\}=\\mathcal{d}_{\\mu}y^{a}+i\\{b_{\\mu},y^{a}\\},\\ ] ] and conventions ( [ algebra ] ) , one can rewrite the kinetic term of scalars in the form @xmath55\\\\ \\nonumber & & + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2n}}b^{\\mu a}\\left[(\\partial_{\\mu}y^{a0})\\bar{y}_{a}^{a}+(\\partial_{\\mu}\\bar{y}_{a}^{0})y^{aa}\\right]\\\\ & & + \\frac{i}{2}d^{abc}b^{\\mu a}\\left[(\\mathcal{d}_{\\mu}y^{ab})\\bar{y}_{a}^{c}-(\\mathcal{d}_{\\mu}y_{a}^{b})^{\\dag}y^{ac}\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] while the kinetic term of fermions takes the form @xmath56    as for the chern - simons term , we obtain @xmath57 although the gauge fields @xmath58 are purely topological , after the recombination ( [ regauge ] ) , one of the new fields @xmath29 becomes an auxiliary field without derivatives , just as happened in @xcite .",
    "we will eliminate this auxiliary field using its equation of motion , and obtain the kinetic term of the other gauge field @xmath52 .",

    "we can eliminate it using the equation of motion @xmath66 when deriving this equation we have neglected the quadratic term in @xmath67 coming from the cubic self - interaction as well as terms coming from higher interaction with scalars . because these terms will lead to higher order contributions which are suppressed in the limit @xmath68 .    inserting the above equation into the lagrangian , up to a total derivative term",
    ", the kinetic and chern - simons terms turn out to be @xmath69 we find the kenetic terms of @xmath70 exactly cancel out ; hence they become non - dynamical . but a question may arise : where are the degrees of freedom newly turned on to compensate the disappeared @xmath70 . the doubt can be resolved by observing that the gauge field @xmath52 becomes dynamical . since in three dimensions ,",
    "each massless vector field @xmath52 has one dynamical degree of freedom as the scalar @xmath70 , the total degrees of freedom are unchanged . from the yang - mills term , by requiring its coefficient to be @xmath71 , one can quickly read the yang - mills coupling constant as in ( [ gym ] ) .",
    "it is clear that @xmath72 right now .",
    "for a finite @xmath41 , in the limit @xmath73 , the first term in ( [ chesim2 ] ) is finite while the second term vanishes , as we have assumed .",
    "since this limit is to keep the leading term in an expansion in powers of energy divided by @xmath74 , this also tells us that the resulting @xmath3 gauge theory is valid only at a energy below @xmath75 i.e. @xmath76 . on the other hand , since our derivation is to depict the weakly coupled limit of n d - branes , the theory is applicable only above the energy scale @xmath77 .    in the limit @xmath68",
    "while keeping @xmath78 finite , the potential terms for scalars and fermions reduce to @xmath79.\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath80[t^{b},t^{d}]\\right).\\ ] ] in ( [ vferm2 ] ) and ( [ vferm3 ] ) , we keep the notation @xmath81 to remind the inner product between two - component spinors . as one expected ,",
    "the goldstones @xmath70 disappear in ( [ kin3]-[vbos3 ] ) and hence in the total action .    if we define the minimal spinor of @xmath82 as , @xmath83 where",
    "each @xmath84 is also a two - component majorana spinor .",
    "then the fermionic potential is actually the standard yukawa coupling : @xmath85 at this moment , it is easy to see that the fermionic potential term also has an @xmath47 r - symmetry .",
    "the last step is to rescale the scalars and spinor as @xmath86 . gathering the above results together , in the limit @xmath27 with a fixed @xmath41 , we have @xmath87 where @xmath88 @xmath89[x^{i},x^{j}]\\right)-\\frac{1}{2}f^{abc}x^{ja}\\bar{\\psi}^{b}\\gamma^{j}\\otimes\\mathbf{1}\\psi^{c}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as one should have expected , at last we get a decoupled @xmath90 sector and a coupled @xmath91 sector , which is nothing else but an @xmath2 super yang - mills theory on the world - volume of @xmath4 coincident d2-branes .",
    "the action ( [ actiond2 ] ) is valid in the energy range between @xmath77 and @xmath76 , and we have assumed @xmath92 in the above procedure .",
    "in new bl models @xcite , in general the structure constant of 3-algebra does not have three totally anti - symmetric indices , so one can not apply mukhi and papageorgakis s method @xcite in a naive way .",
    "this difficulty has been discussed in a newly appeared paper @xcite , where cherkis and saemann also proposed a class of models similar to ( but a little different from ) the new bl models .",
    "one viable extrapolation of mukhi and papageorgakis s method @xcite is to decompose the 3-algebra into a couple of 2-algebras , say @xmath93 , just as did in @xcite : @xmath94 when @xmath95 , it exactly recovers the abjm theories , and the higgs mechanism we discussed in the previous section exactly applies .",
    "the procedure shown in the previous section still works if only @xmath96 , although that field theory would have less supersymmetries .",
    "it is easy to see that in general the goldstones becomes non - dynamical , at least they will disappear in the kinetic term . while the @xmath98 gauge symmetry is broken down to @xmath99 .",
    "the degrees of freedom of the goldstone bosons are transferred to the dynamical @xmath99 gauge fields .      as a conclusion",
    ", we can see that mukhi and papageorgakis s method , after a little adjustment , is still powerful in deriving the world - volume action of @xmath4 d2-branes from that of @xmath4 m2-branes when @xmath4 is arbitrary .",
    "_ note added _ :",
    "when this work was finished , a similar paper @xcite appeared with the emphasis on the pure yang - mils terms .",
    "the interested readers are encouraged to compare our results with that paper , especially the yang - mills coupling constant .",
