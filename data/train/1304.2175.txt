    "superconducting iron - based pnictides  @xcite attract considerable interest not only due to their high critical temperatures , but also because of the rich physics of their electron subsystem .",
    "the phase diagram in iron pnictides contains areas of superconductivity , spin - density wave ( sdw ) order  @xcite , both commensurate  @xcite and incommensurate  @xcite , and even a phase with electronic nematicity .",
    "@xcite    moreover , these materials often demonstrate spin and charge inhomogeneity , exhibiting characteristic features of systems with electronic phase separation .  @xcite the origin of this phase separation is important for understanding the mechanisms driving numerous phase transitions in the phase diagram of iron pnictides .",
    "the phase separation is quite ubiquitous , manifesting itself in different situations where the itinerancy of charge carriers competes with their tendency to localization .",
    "the latter is often related to some specific type of magnetic ordering , e.g. antiferromagnetic in manganites or low - spin state in cobaltites .",
    "the interplay between the localization - induced lowering of the potential energy and metallicity , providing a gain in the kinetic energy , favors an inhomogeneous ground state , such as nanosize ferromagnetic droplets on an antiferromagnetic insulating background .",
    "this type of phase separation has a long history ( beginning from the seminal work of refs .  ) in the fields of magnetic semiconductors and doped manganites .",
    "electron correlations here also play an important role enhancing the tendency to localization .",
    "@xcite moreover , it can be shown that in strongly correlated electron systems with different types of charge carriers , phase separation can appear even in the absence of any specific order parameter .",
    "@xcite    in this paper , we discuss a very different mechanism of phase separation , which is not directly related to electron correlations and could be more relevant in the case of iron pnictides .",
    "it is based on the imperfect nesting of different pockets of the fermi surface .",
    "indeed , it has been known that the sdw ground state in a model with two spherical fermi surfaces of unequal radius  @xcite can be unstable with respect to electronic phase separation .",
    "@xcite variations of the latter model have been used to describe sdw in chromium  @xcite and graphene bilayer with aa stacking  @xcite .",
    "it is also analogous ( but not identical ) to the commonly used model of iron pnictides where one deals , roughly speaking , with elliptical rather than spherical electron and hole sheets of the fermi surface .",
    "one can ask if a similar mechanism could apply to pnictides . in this paper , we demonstrate that the answer to this question is positive , and thus the charge inhomogeneity can result from a purely electronic mechanism .",
    "this finding is important for the interpretation of experimental data on charge inhomogeneity and for understanding the nature of the coexistence of the order parameters in iron pnictides .",
    "for definiteness , we will focus here on iron pnictides , although iron chalcogenides also exhibit phase separation .",
    "@xcite however , the physics related to the fermi surface nesting may not be directly applicable to iron chalcogenides , especially to those containing alkaline atoms . indeed , some chalcogenides do not have hole pockets , but nevertheless exhibit antiferromagnetism with rather high nel temperatures .",
    "@xcite moreover , the electron correlation effects in chalcogenides seem to be more pronounced than in pnictides .",
    "@xcite therefore , the case of iron chalcogenides requires a separate consideration .",

    "the shape of the fermi surface and the value of the fermi velocity are the only relevant single - electron band parameters . in the literature",
    ", the fermi surface of iron pnictides is typically described using two related approaches , which we briefly describe below . in fig .",
    "[ fermisurface](a ) , we plot the fermi surface within the so called unfolded brillouin zone ,  @xcite which corresponds to the square lattice of iron atoms , with one fe atom per unit cell and lattice constant @xmath0 . in this representation ,",
    "two quasi - two - dimensional nearly - circular hole pockets are centered at the @xmath1 point , one more circular hole pocket is located near the @xmath2 point , and two elliptical - shaped electron pockets are centered at the @xmath3 and @xmath4 points [ see fig .  [ fermisurface](a ) ] . at the same time , the actual unit cell of pnictides contains two fe atoms since in the crystal lattice the pnictogen atoms are located in non - equivalent positions . the ( folded ) brillouin zone corresponding to this unit cell is obtained by folding the brillouin zone shown in fig .  [ fermisurface](a ) by dashed lines and consequent rotation by @xmath5 . the fermi surface in the folded brillouin zone is shown in fig .",
    "[ fermisurface](b ) . in this figure ,",
    "all three hole pockets are situated near the @xmath1 point , while electron pockets represented by overlapping ellipses are located near the @xmath6 points , with @xmath7 . formulating our model",
    ", we will make several simplifications .",
    "first , we neglect the effects associated with non - equivalent positions of the fe atoms .",
    "consequently , the use of unfolded brillouin zone is sufficient .",
    "second , we will neglect the 3d structure of the material and study only the 2d model .    .",
    "in the unfolded bz , one of the hole pockets moves to the corner of the bz . for the unfolded bz ( a ) , the electron pockets are elliptic [ ( red ) dashed curves ] and located near the @xmath8 and @xmath9 points , while in the folded bz",

    "the ellipses are rotated by @xmath42 around their centers .",
    "due to the multi - sheeted structure of the fermi surface , the interaction hamiltonian @xmath43 , in general , must include a number of terms describing interactions between charge carriers in different bands .",
    "however , since we are interested in the sdw order , most of these terms may be omitted for they do not contribute to sdw phase transition @xcite .",
    "for this reason , we ignore the electron - electron and hole - hole interactions .",

    "each hole and electron bands are coupled to each other . however , to reproduce the striped magnetic structure it is sufficient to couple one electron and one hole band .",
    "@xcite for example , the sdw with oscillations along the @xmath44-direction occurs if we couple electrons in the hole band @xmath31 and electron band @xmath31 , or electrons in the hole band @xmath45 and electron band @xmath46 [ see the solid and dotted arrows in fig .",

    "specifically , for low @xmath134 , the function @xmath125 is non - monotonic and multivalued near @xmath178 [ see fig .",
    "[ figmu](a ) ] . at higher @xmath134",
    ", the multivaluedness disappears ; however , the non - monotonicity remains [ see fig .  [",
    "figmu](b ) ] .",
    "this vanishes at even higher values of @xmath134 [ as in fig .",
    "[ figmu](c ) ] .",
    "we now observe that in fig .",
    "[ figmu](a ) and fig .",
    "[ figmu](b ) there are finite ranges of doping where the chemical potential decreases as the doping increases .",
    "this means that the compressibility of the electronic system is negative and the homogeneous state is _ unstable _ with respect to separation into two phases .",
    "@xcite the phase transitions between homogeneous commensurate and incommensurate sdw phases , which we described in subsection  [ results ] , will be masked , at least partially , by the phase separation .    in the separated state there",
    "exist two phases , phase  @xmath31 and phase  @xmath46 , with electron density @xmath179(@xmath180 ) and @xmath181(@xmath182 ) , and with the volume fractions @xmath183 and @xmath184 satisfying the conditions @xmath185 and @xmath186 .",
    "as one can see from fig .",
    "[ figmu ] ( a , b ) , the phase @xmath31 is the commensurate and the phase @xmath46 is the incommensurate sdw state .",
    "the concentrations @xmath179 and @xmath181 are found from the equations  @xcite @xmath187 and @xmath188 , where @xmath189 are grand potentials in the phases @xmath31 and @xmath46 .",
    "the latter condition means the equality of two shaded areas shown in fig .",
    "[ figmu](a , b ) ( the so - called maxwell construction ) .",
    "the range of doping @xmath44 , where the phase separation exists , is largest when @xmath190 . in this case ,",
    "our model is identical to the two - dimensional rice model  @xcite , for which the presence of the phase separation was shown in refs .  .",
    "the range of the phase separation , @xmath174 , shrinks if @xmath191 increases , and disappears at the critical value @xmath192 .",
    "the phase separated state does not exist for @xmath193 .",
    "the obtained results are summarized in the phase diagram in the ( @xmath194 ) plane shown in fig .",
    "[ figphdiag ] .",
    "this phase diagram is calculated for @xmath143 .",
    "it remains qualitatively the same if @xmath195 .",
    "if the nonmagnetic bands are absent , @xmath196 , the homogeneous commensurate sdw phase exists only when @xmath197 .",
    "consequently , the electronic concentration @xmath179 in the phase 1 is zero in the phase separated state for any @xmath134 .    )",
    "plane ; for @xmath143 and @xmath198 .",
    "it is symmetric with respect to the replacement @xmath199 and/or @xmath200 .",
    "the boundary between incommensurate sdw and paramagnetic ( pm ) states shown by the dashed ( red ) curve corresponds to the first order and by the solid ( red ) curve to the second order phase transition .",
    "solid ( blue ) lines indicate the boundaries of the phase separated ( ps ) state .",
    "the solid ( black ) curve ( second order transition ) and dashed ( black ) curve ( first order transition ) show the boundaries between commensurate ( @xmath98 ) and incommensurate ( @xmath201 ) homogeneous sdw phases .",
    "note that phase separation partially masks the transition line between the homogeneous sdw states .",
    "]    finally , we would like to draw the attention of the reader to an unexpected feature of the phase diagram in fig .",
    "[ figphdiag ] .",
    "namely , the second - order incommensurate sdw - to - paramagnet transition line bends to the right , while all other transition curve in the phase diagram bend to the left . in other words ,",
    "the value of doping where the transition from paramagnetic to incommensurate sdw phase occurs increases when the ellipticity parameter @xmath39 increases . interpreting this feature , however , one must keep in mind that the nesting quality is controlled not only by @xmath39 but also by @xmath24 ( or @xmath44 ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath39 controls the shape of the electron pocket , while @xmath24 ( or doping ) controls the relative areas of electron and hole pockets .",
    "therefore , at larger doping levels , when the areas of the electron and hole pockets differ substantially , the electron and hole pockets could be better nested for larger ellipticity of the electron pocket .",
    "the most important result obtained here is the prediction of electronic phase separation in some range of doping .",
    "the separated phase consists of a mixture of commensurate and incommensurate sdw phases with different electronic concentrations .",
    "the phase separation in iron - based superconductors was observed in several experiments  @xcite .",
    "for example , the inhomogeneous state with a commensurate antiferromagnetic and nonmagnetic domains with characteristic sizes @xmath202 nm was observed in the hole doped ba@xmath203k@xmath204fe@xmath205as@xmath205 compound .",
    "@xcite our theory predicts that the second phase is an incommensurate sdw rather than a nonmagnetic one .",
    "however , the proposed mechanism of phase separation can , in general , be consistent with the observations reported in ref .  .",
    "we found that the thermodynamic potentials of the incommensurate sdw and the metastable paramagnetic phases are very close to each other in the doping range @xmath206 .",
    "the incommensurate sdw phase can be destroyed by an additional reason not taken into account in our model , e.g. , by disorder . in this case",
    ", the phase separation might occur between the commensurate sdw and the paramagnetic phases .",
    "in addition , the incommensurate sdw order parameter may be difficult to detect due to its weakness .",
    "the geometry of the emergent inhomogeneities and their characteristic sizes are beyond the scope of the present study .",
    "the electron concentrations in separated phases are different ; hence , the inhomogeneities are charged and one should take into consideration the electrostatic contribution to the total energy .",
    "the characteristic sizes of the inhomogeneities are controlled by the interplay between the long - range coulomb interaction and the energy of the surface between the phases . in the simplest case",
    ", the structure of the inhomogeneous state corresponds to the droplets of one phase embedded in the matrix of another phase .",
    "however , depending on the properties of the system , other geometries are possible , such as alternating layers of different phases , stripes , etc .",
    "@xcite when disorder is present in the sample , it also affects the structure of the inhomogeneous phase .",
    "in our study we chose the order parameter @xmath68 , eq .",
    "( [ deltaq ] ) . in the literature ,",
    "a different order parameter is also discussed .",
    "@xcite this order parameter is not homogeneous : sdw gap experiences periodic modulations in real space .",
    "when the state with such an order parameter is doped , the extra charges go to the places where the gap locally vanishes .",
    "the latter type of order may be more stable than eq .",
    "( [ deltaq ] ) .",
    "however , for several reasons we decided to avoid such an option .",
    "specifically , analytical calculations with inhomogeneous gaps become very complicated .",
    "further , the choice of the order parameter affects somewhat the phase diagram and , in particular , the region of the phase separation ; however , the inhomogeneous region does not disappear .",
    "in addition , we must remember that the relative stability of different order parameters is likely a non - universal quantity , which depends on a variety of microscopic parameters ( e.g. , details of the band structure , interaction , disorder ) .",
    "therefore , the type of suitable order parameter can not be deduced without input from experiments .",
    "it follows from the phase diagram in fig .",
    "[ figphdiag ] that the smaller effective ellipticity parameter @xmath134 , the larger the region of the phase separation .",
    "the sdw gap @xmath92 increases with increasing coupling potential @xmath67 .",
    "therefore , a stronger coupling is more favorable for phase separation since @xmath207 [ see eq .  ] .",
    "our mean - field approach is not applicable in the limit of strong coupling , where the use of hubbard - like models is more appropriate .",
    "the phase separation in such models is a common phenomenon  @xcite .",
    "thus , we expect that the existence of phase separation in our model is not an exclusive feature of the weak - coupling regime .",
    "the model studied here predicts an incommensurate sdw phase for both electron and hole doping in the range of dopant concentrations scaled by the parameter @xmath121 , eq .  .",
    "from the latter equation we conclude that @xmath208 if the weak - coupling condition , eq .  ( [ limitv ] ) , is met .",
    "thus , we predict the existence of the incommensurate sdw order for small doping , @xmath209 .",
    "the incommensurate sdw phase is characterized by the vector @xmath210 .",
    "our calculations show that there are only two possible equilibrium directions of @xmath211 : it can be either parallel , or perpendicular to @xmath86 , depending on the type of doping and the sign of the ellipticity parameter @xmath39 [ see eqs .   and  ] .",
    "it is clear , however , that both the magnitude and direction of @xmath211 is sensitive to the shape of the fermi surface , which is simplified in the present calculations . in real materials ,",
    "the shape of the hole pockets deviates from perfect circles .",
    "moreover , the spectrum of the hole and electron bands depend on the transverse momentum , @xmath212 , which is completely neglected in the model considered here . in particular , the electron bands have corrugated structure  @xcite , that is , the major axis of the ellipses are rotated by @xmath42 when @xmath212 varies from @xmath213 to @xmath214 .",
    "nevertheless , we believe that the model studied here captures the main features of the incommensurate sdw state in pnictides .",
    "indeed , the observation of the incommensurate sdw phase with @xmath211 perpendicular to @xmath86 in the electron doped ba(fe@xmath203co@xmath204)@xmath205as@xmath205 was recently reported in ref .  .",
    "the measured value of @xmath142 was about @xmath215@xmath216 for the concentration range @xmath217 .",
    "such values of @xmath44 and @xmath211 , as well as the direction of @xmath211 ( corresponding to @xmath41 ) , are consistent with our theory .",
    "the short - range incommensurate sdw phase was described in ref .   for the electron doped bafe@xmath218ni@xmath204as@xmath205 . in general",
    ", one must be cautious interpreting this experiment using our model , since the observed short - range sdw correlations do not correspond to our long - range sdw order .",
    "however , we note that the measured vector @xmath211 was perpendicular to @xmath86 , which is also consistent with a negative @xmath39 .",
    "we found no experimental work reporting the observation of the incommensurate sdw phase in the hole - doped pnictides . however",
    ", double - peaked spin fluctuations at @xmath219 have been observed  @xcite in the hole - doped ba@xmath203k@xmath204fe@xmath205as@xmath205 compound in a wide doping range . in these measurements  @xcite the vector @xmath211 was found to be parallel to @xmath86 , which , again , corresponds to @xmath41 in our model .",
    "note that , in general , all electron and hole parts of the fermi surface interact with each other .",
    "each @xmath220th pair of these interacting electron - hole surfaces are characterized by the nesting vector @xmath221 , coupling constant @xmath222 , and `` de - nesting '' parameter @xmath223 .",
    "however , the @xmath220th interaction contributes to the sdw order only if @xmath222 exceeds some critical value ( see section  [ results ] ) .",
    "all other charge carriers do not contribute to the `` magnetic '' interaction and form a reservoir .",
    "it is rather quite probable that among the various iron pnictides there exist systems with such reservoirs .",
    "however , the existence of the reservoir is not necessary for the nucleation of the incommensurate afm order or for phase separation .",
    "we limit our consideration to only one type of interaction .",
    "even this simple case corresponds to the experimentally - observed sdw symmetry both for commensurate and incommensurate phases .",
    "also , `` switching on '' additional interactions may be necessary in the future , if the incommensurate afm ordering with different symmetry would be observed .",
    "however , let us emphasize that the qualitative results of our work remain unchanged .",
    "we considered a model with imperfect nesting of the fermi surface suitable for the description of iron pnictides . we show that an incommensurate sdw phase arises at finite doping .",
    "we demonstrate that two spin configurations can arise in the system depending on the model parameters .",
    "it was shown that the homogeneous state is unstable toward phase separation into commensurate and incommensurate sdw phases in a specific doping range .",
    "these results are in qualitative agreement with the recent experimental observation of the incommensurate sdw order and phase separation in doped superconducting pnictides .",
    "the main achievement of this paper is the demonstration that a simple model approximating the fermi surface of pnictides implies the existence of electronic phase separation even in the weak - coupling regime , that is , in the absence of strong electron correlations .",
    "this is an important finding for the interpretation of the experimental data on phase inhomogeneity of iron pnictides : it proves that a purely electronic model with moderate interaction is sufficient to explain the observed inhomogeneities .",
    "there are several features of pnictides which we incorporate into our approach .",
    "let us briefly recall them .",
    "first , we need a fermi surface with sufficient nesting ( poor nesting implies no phase separation ) .",
    "the arpes data  @xcitesupport the assumption that at least some sheets of the fermi surface nest adequately .",
    "second , the interaction between electrons in the nested bands must not be too weak : the ground state of the parent compound should be the homogeneous sdw state .",
    "there is plenty of experimental evidence that a broad class of iron pnictides are in such a state at zero doping .",
    "however , to make our hamiltonian analytically tractable , we discarded all interaction constants except one , @xmath67 .",
    "further , @xmath67 was assumed to be momentum - independent .",
    "third , following rice  @xcite , we included non - magnetic (  reservoir \" ) bands into our model .",
    "this is a simple way to account for those sheets of the fermi surface which do not nest with some other sheets .",
    "the fermi surface pockets , which may serve as the reservoir , are seen by arpes ( like `` propellers '' , see , e.g. ref .  ) .",
    "in addition , the finite conductivity of pnictides even in the undoped sdw state may be easily explained by non - magnetic bands ( although , other explanations are also possible ) .",
    "clearly , our model , being quite simple and generic , can not predict whether a particular material exhibits phase separation .",
    "one can attempt devising a more elaborate model .",
    "for example , instead of a single coupling constant @xmath67 , a set of spin - dependent couplings @xmath224 , which describe the interaction of electrons in the band @xmath39 and the band @xmath225 , may be introduced .",
    "other refinements , e.g. , 3d structure of the material , orbital content of the fermi surface states  @xcite ( the latter introduces a pronounced momentum dependence of the interaction ) , are possible as well .    yet ,",
    "such a detailed investigation can be counterproductive .",
    "indeed , our analysis clearly shows that the phase separation is a non - universal feature of the model .",
    "that is , its presence depends on the parameters of the hamiltonian .",
    "it is very likely that a study of a a more complex model , while being quite costly in terms of effort , will bring up the same conclusion about the non - universality of phase separation .",
    "thus , in the situation where accurate knowledge of the microscopic parameters is absent , one would not be able to reliably establish the presence of phase separation for a given material . keeping these circumstances in mind ,",
    "we emphasize that the main purpose of our study is to introduce the mechanism of phase separation in iron pnictides . however , the problem regarding the instability of the homogeneous state for a particular material has to be solved on an individual basis by the analysis of the specific feature of its electronic structure .",
