    "the cv states of considerable importance are the gaussian ones .",
    "the interest in this special class of states stems from the experimental feasibility to produce them from reliable sources @xcite and to control them using accessible tools such as beam splitters , phase shifter , and squeezers @xcite .",
    "the two - mode entangled gaussian states have been utilized in many of quantum information applications @xcite .",
    "entanglement between two gaussian modes is routinely generated in laboratory , e.g. , the two output beams of a nonlinear optical device ( parametric down converter ) @xcite .",
    "alternatively , a beam splitter , one of the linear optical devices , can also be used to generate quantum entanglement between two modes @xcite .",
    "there have been many studies for producing entanglement using beam splitter as an entangler @xcite . in particular ,",
    "kim _ et al .",
    "_ studied the entangler properties with many different input states , such as fock states , pure- and mixed- gaussian states .",
    "they conjectured that in order to obtain an entangled two - mode state out of a beam splitter , it is necessary to have a nonclassical state at one input , which was later proved in @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the _ sufficiency _ of single - mode nonclassicality to generate entangled states via beam splitter was demonstrated by asboth _",
    "_ @xcite . on another side ,",
    "the separability criteria to detect such entangled outputs via beam splitter have also been derived @xcite .",
    "remarkably , a broad class of uncertainty inequalities was presented to detect entanglement produced using generalized single - mode nonclassical states , which include higher - order amplitude squeezing and high - order photon statistics @xcite .    in this paper , we investigate in detail the entanglement generated via beam splitter using two uncorrelated gaussian input modes .",
    "in particular , we consider a nonclassical single - mode state ( squeezed state ) and a thermal state at two input modes , respectively .",

    "in other words , the degree of entanglement is solely determined by the degree of nonclassicality regardless of the purity of input state . in realistic situations",
