    "the cell membrane physically separates the cell interior from the environment .",
    "the membrane is selectively permeable : it permits the passage of some species of molecules or ions to- and from the cell , while it blocks the transport for other species . around 1900 , while studying the working of general anaesthesia , hans meyer in marburg @xcite and ernest overton in zrich @xcite independently devised a simple rule to predict membrane permeability .",
    "they established that the more a molecule species is soluble in lipid , the greater the cell permeability for this molecule species is .",
    "while this rule can not account for transport processes not known at that time , such as those mediated by membrane carriers , channels ( _ e.g. _ , aquaporins @xcite ) or pumps , nor does it acknowledge membrane inhomogeneities , such as rafts @xcite present in the biological membrane , the meyer - overton rule seems to withstand the test of time @xcite . at the same time",
    ", there is a continuing interest in both basic physics of general anaesthesia @xcite and passive membrane permeability @xcite .    while a significant corpus of publications on permeability properties of biological cells has been accumulated since meyer and overton , experimental access to an isolated lipid bilayer only became available in the early 1960s , when a technique for preparation of thin films separating two aqueous compartments has been devised , known as the black lipid membrane @xcite .",
    "an arguably even more influential technique which was developed at roughly the same time allowed for producing artificial lipid vesicles , or liposomes @xcite .",
    "vesicles are osmotically sensitive structures which swell and shrink in response to changed osmotic conditions .",
    "even though the sub - micrometer liposomes which are the easiest to produce can not be visualized directly , their size can be estimated via light scattering @xcite ( see @xcite for a review on the optical methods in determining membrane permeability ) .    both model lipid bilayer systems ",
    "planar lipid bilayers and liposomes  have proved extremely fruitful in the studies of membrane permeability @xcite .",
    "planar lipid bilayers are well suited to electrical characterization , as the two chambers separated by the bilayer are both easily accessible , which allows simple placement of macroscopic electrodes .",
    "finkelstein @xcite measured the permeability of a planar lipid bilayer for water and seven other non - electrolytes in an attempt to resolve the mechanism by which neutral molecules and ions permeate the membrane .",
    "one possibility is the solubility - diffusion mechanism , which assumes that the permeating species dissolves in the hydrophobic membrane , diffuses across , and leaves by redissolving into the other aqueous compartment .",
    "another possibility is that permeation occurs through hydrated transient defects , which appear as a result of thermal fluctuations .",
    "that study concluded that both water and non - electrolytes cross the membrane through the solubility - diffusion mechanism .",
    "a similar but more comprehensive study was repeated a few years later by orbach and finkelstein @xcite .",
    "walter and gutknecht @xcite examined the correlation between the membrane permeability for 22 solutes and their partition coefficient between water and any of the four examined organic solvents , and found a very high correlation with hexadecane and olive oil , and a less pronounced correlation in the case of octanol and ether .    in an early work @xcite , bangham and coworkers made use of the fact that the total volume of liposomes in the suspension is proportional to the reciprocal of the optical extinction , which allowed them to examine the permeability of membrane for water and various solutes via osmotic swelling and shrinking of liposomes .",
    "as early as 1933 jacobs noticed @xcite that the volume of a cell transferred into a solution of permeant solute transiently decreases , reaches some minimal value , and then starts increasing .",
    "shaafi and coworkers @xcite employed this phenomenon and the kedem - katchalsky formalism @xcite to compute the permeability of erythrocyte membrane for urea .",
    "de gier and coworkers used the initial slope of the reciprocal of the optical extinction for determining membrane permeability of liposomes @xcite .",
    "hill and cohen @xcite brought the `` minimal volume '' technique to the experiment with liposomes as well .",
    "a comprehensive review of the use of liposomes in membrane permeability studies is given by de gier @xcite .",
    "using established techniques , paula _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite did an extensive study in another attempt to resolve the standing debate between the solubility - diffusion mechanism and the hydrated transient defects as a primary pathway , and concluded that except for ion permeability of lipid bilayers composed of phospholipids with short chain lengths , solubility - diffusion mechanism seems to be the dominant effect .",
    "examining the known phenomenon that upon transfer into a hypotonic medium , vesicles swell , and , if the gradient is large enough , burst and expel part of their content , shoemaker and vanderlick studied the influence of membrane composition on the extent of leakage @xcite , and found out a correlation between the membrane resistance to burst and its stretching modulus .",
    "both planar lipid bilayers and liposomes as model bilayer systems have their drawbacks , too .",
    "the original `` brush '' technique of producing planar lipid bilayers has been limited by pockets of residual solvent trapped between the two bilayer leaflets , which affects membrane properties .",
    "while an improved deposition method @xcite virtually eliminated this problem , the limited lifetime of the membranes most often less than one hour  remains a persisting problem which limits the duration of the experiment .",
    "liposomes , on the other hand  in particular large unilamellar vesicles ( luvs ) with a diameter of 100200  nm  have proved to be extremely stable .",
    "the interpretation of dynamic light scattering ( dls ) experiments of osmotic shrinking of luvs is not trivial , as it involves the transformation of shapes predicted by the area difference elasticity model @xcite to the hydrodynamic radius , which is characterized by dls @xcite .",
    "also , it has been argued that luvs , which consist exclusively of high - curvature membrane regions , serve as a poor model of biological cell membranes .",
    "an attempt to resolve the possible dependence of permeability on the membrane curvature @xcite was inconclusive , as the authors ascribe the observed differences in permeability to the problems they experienced with planar lipid membranes . finally , an effect which occurs in both systems , but is more prominent with the planar lipid bilayer , is the unstirred layer effect @xcite . in general , the concentration of solute adjacent to the membrane differs from its concentration in bulk .",
    "it is the concentration of solute immediately adjacent to the membrane which determines the permeation of solute across the membrane , while the concentration in bulk is the one that is usually known . in both the experiment design and the interpretation of the experimental findings",
    ", one needs to be aware of this discrepancy .",
    "while both planar lipid bilayers and liposomes have been used as model membrane systems for studies of membrane permeability since 1960s , studies employing guvs , which allow for a direct visualization of the process , appeared decades later @xcite , chiefly due to a lack of suitable techniques for preparation and manipulation of guvs in those early days . in the paper by boroske _",
    "@xcite , the authors describe the experiment in which guvs were prepared in pure water and subsequently transferred into a solution of either glucose or nacl ( concentrations used ranged from 1.520  mm ) while their size was monitored using phase - contrast microscopy . upon transfer ,",
    "vesicles shrank in size ; the process of shrinking depended on the vesicle size . vesicles with radius @xmath2 shrank with a linear time dependence : @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the molar volume of water , @xmath5 is membrane permeability for water ( water filtration coefficient ) , @xmath6 the solute concentration difference , and @xmath7 time .",
    "from measured data , the authors inferred the water filtration coefficient , @xmath8 .",
    "larger vesicles ( @xmath9 ) underwent a phase of `` instability '' in which the vesicle was flaccid , and after which a spherical shape was reestablished .",
    "the authors dismissed the idea of dissolving lipid molecules into the outer medium as a plausible explanation for the apparent decrease of vesicle surface area , in particular since they also noticed formation of smaller satellite spherical vesicles , seemingly connected to the mother vesicle .",
    "instead , they proposed a mechanism of concerted flipping of lipid molecules from the inner membrane leaflet into the outer membrane leaflet , induced by the flow of water .",
    "recently , membrane permeability has also been studied of guvs made of block copolymers @xcite .",
    "the remaining of this chapter is structured as follows .",
    "first , the experimental section introduces the system and presents the immediate experimental results .",
    "a section on the theory of membrane permeability offers a review of the few selected phenomenological models for membrane permeability , with a special emphasis on the influence of membrane elasticity and the swelling - burst cycle .",
    "the section concludes with a theory of the continous transition between the `` ironing '' and the stretching regimes of the osmotic swelling of a vesicle .",
    "the section on experimental analysis demonstrates the calculation of membrane permeability based on the swelling - burst cycle , and compares its result with the calculation based on the analysis of the transition between the `` ironing '' and the stretching regimes .",
    "we conclude with a discussion of the merits and limitations of the presented method .",
    "d-(+)-glucose , d-(+)-sucrose , glycerol , urea , and ethylene glycol were purchased from fluka ( buchs , switzerland ) .",
    "methanol and chloroform were purchased from kemika ( zagreb , croatia ) .",
    "1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-_sn_-glycero-3-phosphocholine ( popc ) was purchased from avanti polar lipids ( alabaster , usa ) .",
    "all the solutions were prepared in double - distilled sterile water .    a suspension of popc guvs in 0.1 or 0.2  mol / l 1:1 sucrose / glucose solution was prepared using an electroformation method , described in ref .   with some modifications @xcite .",
    "lipids were dissolved in a mixture of chloroform / methanol ( 2:1 , v / v ) to a concentration of 1  mg / ml . a volume of 25  @xmath10l of the lipid solution was spread onto a pair of pt electrodes and dried under reduced pressure ( water aspirator ; @xmath11  mmhg ) for 2  hours .",
    "the electrodes were then placed into an electroformation chamber , which was filled with 0.1 or 0.2  mol / l sucrose . ac current ( 8  v , 10  hz ) was applied , and the voltage and frequency were reduced in steps to the final values of 1  v and 1  hz @xcite . subsequently , the chamber was first drained into a beaker and then flushed with an equal volume of isomolar glucose solution , thus resulting in a suspension of guvs containing entrapped sucrose in a 1:1 sucrose / glucose solution , which increases the contrast in a phase contrast setup and facilitates vesicle manipulation @xcite .",
    "this procedure yields mostly spherical unilamellar vesicles , with diameters of up to 100  @xmath10 m .",
    "an inverted optical microscope ( nikon diaphot 200 , objective 20/0.40 ph2 dl ) with micro - manipulating equipment ( narishige mmn-1/mmo-202 ) and a cooled ccd camera ( hamamatsu orca - er ; c4742 - 95 - 12erg ) , connected _ via _ an ieee-1394 interface to a pc running hamamatsu wasabi software , was used to obtain phase contrast micrographs . in the streaming mode ,",
    "the camera provides @xmath12 12-bit grayscale images at a rate of 8.9  images / s .    in the experiment , an individual spherical guv is selected , fully aspirated into a glass micropipette whose inner diameter exceeds the vesicle s diameter , and transferred from a solution containing solutes of very low membrane permeability ( 1:1 glucose / sucrose ) into an iso - osmolar solution of a more permeable solute ( glycerol , urea , or ethylene glycol ) , where the content of the micropipette is released , and the micropipette is subsequently removed .",
    "vesicle response is recorded using a ccd camera mounted on the microscope .",
    "upon transfer into a solution of permeating solute , vesicles start to swell until the membrane critical strain is reached . at that point , the membrane ruptures , and the vesicle ejects part of its internal solution ( figure  [ fig : burst ] ) .",
    "after the burst , the membrane reseals , and another cycle of swelling starts . the observed sequences of swelling - burst cycles ranged from 3 to over 40 successive bursts , with an average in our sample being 15.4 .",
    "m ; immediately after the burst , it shrunk to 30.47  @xmath10 m .",
    "the images were taken at 0.11  s intervals .",
    "the bar represents 20  @xmath10 m . ]    for a quantitative analysis , the radius of the vesicle cross - section in each recorded micrograph was determined with a gnu octave script using a least - squares procedure for circle fitting @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : burst - seq ] shows a typical time course of vesicle radius after transfer . in about 80% of all cases , we observed a transient maximum of radius shortly after the transfer .",
    "we attribute this phenomenon to a slight hypertonicity of the target solution .",
    "this causes the vesicle to deflate rapidly , the rate of volume change being determined by the vesicle size and the permeability of phospholipid membrane for water . a deflated vesicle changes its shape from spherical into a shape which can be approximated with an oblate spheroid .",
    "small deviations from this shape , which originate from the effects of gravity @xcite , are neglected here . due to gravity ,",
    "the axis of rotational symmetry is aligned with the vertical , which , in our experimental setup , also coincides with the direction of the optical axis .",
    "thus , the observed cross - section radius is the oblate spheroid longer semiaxis , and consequently it increases with the decreasing volume , while the membrane area remains unchanged .",
    "concurrently with the initial vesicle deflation due to the slight hypertonicity , diffusion of permeating solute into the vesicle interior , accompanied by the osmotic influx of water , also takes place .",
    "the rate of this latter process is however dominated by the permeability of the membrane for the given solute ( in our case , glycerol , urea , or ethylene glycol ) , and is thus much slower than the initial rapid deflation due to the mismatch in tonicity . with time , however , the initial trend of vesicle deflation is overturned and the vesicle starts inflating again .",
    "inflation can be qualitatively divided into two phases . in the first phase ,",
    "the vesicle is still partially deflated , and the influx of solute and the accompanying osmotic influx of water increases the vesicle volume , all while the membrane area remains unchanged .",
    "this `` ironing '' phase is characterized by the decrease of the radius of vesicle cross - section . at some point ,",
    "the vesicle reaches a spherical shape , which can be observed as a local minimum of the cross - section radius .",
    "further permeating of solute into the vesicle interior , accompanied by the osmotic influx of water , causes the vesicle to inflate while maintaining a spherical shape . in this phase ,",
    "the increase of vesicle volume can be observed as an increase of vesicle cross - section . in order to accomodate the increased vesicle volume",
    ", the membrane needs to stretch .",
    "this stretching process continues until the critical strain for the membrane is reached .",
    "at this point , the membrane ruptures , and part of the vesicle interior is ejected outside .",
    "when the vesicle volume is thus reduced , the membrane reseals again . as the concentration difference for the permeating solute persists , which serves as a driving force for the diffusion of the permeating solute into the vesicle interior",
    ", this means that at the same moment , the vesicle volume starts increasing again , and another swelling cycle commences .",
    "repeated swelling - burst cycles give yield to the characteristic saw - tooth pattern , when the vesicle radius is plotted against the elapsed time ( figure  [ fig : burst - seq ] ) .    in total , 47 recordings of vesicle transfer from a 1:1 sucrose / glucose solution into an isomolar solution of glycerol , urea , or ethylene glycol were selected for further analysis . out of these , 15 transfers were into glycerol ( 5 at 0.1  m and 10 at 0.2  m ) , 15 transfers into urea ( 8 at 0.1  m and 7 at 0.2  m ) , and 17 transfers into ethylene glycol ( 12 at 0.1  m and 5 at 0.2  m ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : critical - strain ] shows the critical strain @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the radius of a relaxed spherical vesicle , and @xmath15 is the radius of a critically strained vesicle .",
    "the median critical strain obtained for a total of 738 recorded vesicle bursts is 0.033 , and mean critical strain is 0.038 with standard deviation 0.024 .",
    "a published value for the critical strain is around 0.04 @xcite .",
    "our own estimate based on the first burst in the sequence alone is a little higher : @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "this may indicate that the membrane might not always perfectly reseal , and that a local defect present in the membrane makes it more likely to rupture at a lower strain .",
    ", where @xmath14 is the initial and @xmath15 the final , or critical , radius for each of the swelling cycles . ]",
    "in this section , we will briefly review a few theoretical models used for the description of solute permeation across cell membrane , starting from the most general kedem - katchalsky formalism , based on nonequilibrium thermodynamics @xcite , then showing how in the case of separate pathways for water and solute transport it can be simplified into a two - parameter model , and subsequently when a two - parameter model can be simplified into a one - parameter model in the case when the membrane permeability for water greatly exceeds its permeability for solute .",
    "we will discuss the influence of finite membrane elasticity on the apparent membrane permeability , review the work on the repetitive swelling - burst cycles , and conclude with the theory of the continuous transition between the `` ironing '' and the stretching regime of a vesicle which swells osmotically due to the permeation of a permeable solute .",

    "the trend is even more apparent in figure  [ fig : permeability - concentration ] .",

    "this affinity of polyols to phospholipid headgroups may also account for a large scatter of published data on membrane permeabilities for polyols .",
    "the existance of reproducible techniques for producing giant unilamellar vesicles ( guvs ) @xcite , the availability of phase - contrast microscopy and high - resolution digital cameras , along with the efficient procedures for automated extraction of vesicle contour from the images and determination of the radius of vesicle cross - section @xcite , render the determination of membrane permeability of guvs a viable alternative to the established techniques employing either dynamic light scattering on sub - micrometer vesicles or planar lipid membranes .",

    "the continuous transition between the `` ironing '' and the stretching regime of a vesicle which swells osmotically due to the permeation of a permeable solute might seem similar to the `` minimal volume '' technique employed by shaafi _",
    "( _ cf . _ fig .  3 in @xcite and fig .  1 in @xcite",
    ". however , one needs to be aware of the fact that fig .  3 in @xcite shows vesicle volume as a function of time , while fig .",
    "1 in @xcite shows the radius of a non - spherical vesicle cross - section , and throughout the course shown in the diagram , vesicle volume is monotonously increasing . in our experiment , minimal vesicle volume appears at the top of the initial bulge ( visible around 40  s on the graph in figure  [ fig : burst - seq ] ) .",
    "we have not attempted an analysis analogous to the one performed by shaafi _",
    "@xcite or hill and cohen @xcite , because the initial moment in which the vesicles are brought in contact with the target solution is not defined as well as in the stopped flow experiments .",
    "the authors of earlier studies , on the other hand , seem to be unaware of the critical transition between the `` ironing '' and the stretching regime in the course of osmotical swelling of a vesicle .",
    "while offering a direct visualization of osmotic swelling , the method described here has its limitations .",
    "the three solutes tested here  glycerol , urea , and ethylene glycol  induce significant changes in vesicle size on the timescale of minutes . with solutes which are much more or much less permeable",
    ", the rate of changes may be either too fast for video camera , or so slow that other effects start to dominate the experiment ( _ e.g. , _ convection in the measuring chamber ) .",
    "another limitation is imposed by the refractive index of the solution .",
    "the refractive index of the target solution in general differs from that of the vesicle interior , and the difference between the two refractive indices increases with the increasing concentration of solutions . at high enough concentration ,",
    "the halo around the vesicle becomes blurred , and the algorithm used to determine vesicle contour @xcite fails . with our present equipment",
    ", we estimate that concentrations significantly higher than 0.2  mol / l are outside our reach .",
    "finally , we want to compare the results of two techniques dubbed `` burst train '' and `` critical swelling '' in table [ tab : permeability ] .",
    "as can be seen , they produce consistent results which are within the experimental error of each other .",
    "the experimental error estimates for both methods are also approximately the same .",
    "the `` burst train '' technique is more forgiving towards minor glitches , such as vesicle temporarily drifting slighly out of focus , which results in an overestimate of vesicle radius ( seen around 370  s in figure  [ fig : burst - seq ] ) .",
    "however , one needs to keep in mind that the `` burst train '' technique requires approximately 5 times as much data as the `` critical swelling '' , and consequently , minor glitches are more likely to occur during a longer period .",
    "we therefore lean towards recommending the `` critical swelling '' technique , which is less resource - greedy while giving the results with the same precision .",
    "our recommended procedure is therefore to keep recording the vesicle transfer up to the first burst ( which is easy to notice during the experiment ) , and carry out the analysis desribed in ref .",
