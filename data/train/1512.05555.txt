    "the introduction of the nonminimally derivative coupling to einstein tensor causes the scalar field to evolve more slowly because of the gravitationally enhanced friction , so the new higgs inflation was successfully implemented without either violating the unitarity bound or fine - tuning the coupling constant @xmath29 @xcite .",

    "@xmath134 derived from the statistics of the period derivatives of 21 millisecond pulsars @xcite , we find the strongest limit @xmath135 , so the theory with nonminimally derivative coupling deviates from einstein s general relativity in the order of @xmath0 .",

    "if we use the observational constraint @xmath140 and @xmath141 @xcite , then we get the contribution of the canonical kinetic energy is @xmath142 , so roughly we get @xmath143 and the high friction limit assumed in inflationary models @xcite is guaranteed unless the equation of state parameter @xmath144 is extremely close to be -1 .",
