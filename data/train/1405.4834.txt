    "in the past years , it has been demonstrated that the performance of nanowires ( nws ) can greatly benefit from the presence of a shell .",
    "for instance , surface passivation is an option to reduce scattering , and measurements on inas / inp core / shell nws have revealed significantly higher mobilities than in uncapped inas nws @xcite .",
    "furthermore , experiments on various core / shell nws @xcite have demonstrated that adding a shell can be very useful for optical applications , a feature that is well - known , e.g. , from colloidal quantum dots ( qds ) @xcite . in ge / si core / shell nws , which recently attracted attention ,",
    "the shell is beneficial for several reasons . in particular",
    ", it provides a large valence band offset at the interface , leading to a strongly confined hole gas inside the ge core without the need for dopants @xcite .    due to lattice mismatch , core / shell heterostructures",
    "are usually strained , which can have important consequences on their electrical and optical properties .",
    "for instance , strain may affect the lifetimes of spin qubits @xcite and has already been used to tune photons from separate qds into resonance @xcite .",
    "the reason for such effects lies in the strain dependence of the hamiltonian of the electronic states @xcite . for the core / shell nws of refs .  , a strong and strain - based correlation between the shell thickness ( or composition ) and the wavelength of the emitted photons has already been measured .",
    "in addition , the shell - induced strain may lift quasidegeneracies in the spectrum of nws and nw qds @xcite . considering these and other possibly relevant consequences ,",
    "knowledge of the strain distribution in core / shell nws is crucial .",
    "exact calculations of the lattice displacement , however , typically require numerics @xcite .",
    "analytical results are rare and require simplifying assumptions that may or may not be justified , depending on the choice of materials and on the effects that one is interested in . the model of ref .",
    ", for instance , assumes purely uniaxial strain along the nw axis .",
    "the results of refs .",
    "apply when the core and shell materials are isotropic and have the same elastic properties . to our knowledge ,",
    "the most general formulas provided so far are those of ref .  , assuming isotropic media and requiring only poisson s ratio to be the same in core and shell .",
    "a particularly attractive feature of nws is their potential to host electrically controllable spin qubits @xcite .",
    "while bare inas and insb nws have been the workhorse systems @xcite , spin qubits may also be implemented in core / shell nws such as ge / si @xcite , for which a large degree of external control has been predicted @xcite . as electrons and holes interact with lattice vibrations , understanding of the quantum mechanical behavior of the system requires knowledge of the phonon bath . for instance , it is well - known that phonons can be dominant decay channels for spin qubits @xcite .",
    "the shell of core / shell nws not only induces static strain , it also affects the phonon modes .",
    "while phonons in homogeneous nws have been discussed in detail in the literature @xcite , we are not aware of analytical results for nws with a finite shell .    in this paper , we derive algebraic expressions for the static strain and the low - energetic phonon modes in core / shell nws . assuming isotropic materials and a force - free wire surface , we allow for arbitrary core and shell radii , independent elastic properties in core and shell , and take all components of the stress and strain tensors into account .",
    "our results for the phonons illustrate that the shell notably affects the phonon - based displacement fields and , among other things , that the dispersion relations of the longitudinal , torsional , and flexural modes change differently with the shell thickness .",
    "in particular , new terms arise in the corresponding strain and stress tensors that are absent in homogeneous nws .",
    "we illustrate our results via the example of ge / si nws , given the fact that the coherence of their interfaces has already been demonstrated experimentally @xcite . the derived formulas for the static strain can be considered a further extension of those listed in ref .   and are consistent with experiments @xcite and numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "we calculate the effects of the static strain on the low - energy hole spectrum of ge / si nws , complementing the analysis of ref .  .",

    "the appendix contains useful relations and further details of the calculations .",
    "in particular , providing also a comparison to the case of bulk material , we discuss the displacement operator and the normalization condition for phonons in core / shell and core / multishell nws , as quantization is mandatory for quantum mechanical analyses .",
    "in this section we recall relevant relations from linear elasticity theory and introduce the notation used throughout this paper .",
    "the information summarized here is carefully explained in refs .  , and we refer to these for further details .    in a bulk semiconductor without additional forces , the atoms form a periodic and very well structured lattice , characterized by the lattice constant @xmath0 .",
    "the displacement of an atom @xmath1 from its original position @xmath2 is described by the displacement vector @xmath3 .",
    "it may be caused by externally applied forces , or , as in the case of core / shell nws , by an interface between materials with different lattice constants . in the continuum model , the displacement field @xmath4",
    "is directly related to the strain tensor elements @xmath5 via @xmath6 leading to strain - induced effects on the conduction and valence band states @xcite .",
    "the position is denoted here by @xmath7 , where the three orthonormal basis vectors @xmath8 are the unit vectors along the orthogonal axes @xmath9 .",
    "important quantities besides the strain are the stress tensor elements @xmath10 .",
    "these are of relevance as @xmath11 corresponds to the force along @xmath8 experienced by an area @xmath12 normal to @xmath13 .",
    "we note that @xmath14 and @xmath15 , which implies that the strain and stress tensors are fully described by three diagonal and three off - diagonal elements each .    for semiconductors with diamond ( ge ,",
    "si ,  ) or zinc blende ( gaas , inas ,  ) structure , the relation between stress and strain is given by @xmath16 where the @xmath17 are the elastic stiffness coefficients and @xmath18 are the main crystallographic axes .",
    "calculations with the exact stiffness matrix often require elaborate numerical analyses , and it is therefore common to replace the stress - strain relations by those of an isotropic material .",
    "this simplification usually results in good approximations when compared with the precise simulations @xcite .",
    "the elastic properties of such a material are fully described by the two lam parameters @xmath19 and @xmath20 , which are found from young s modulus @xmath21 ( often denoted by @xmath22 ) and poisson s ratio @xmath23 through @xmath24 considering the limit of isotropic media , we thus replace the stiffness coefficients of eq .",
    "( [ eq : stressstrainreldiamondzb ] ) by @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 .",
    "the relations between stress and strain are now the same for arbitrarily rotated coordinate systems .",
    "hence , referring to nws , we obtain @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the orthonormal basis vectors for cylindrical coordinates @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 .",
    "the vector @xmath34 is oriented along the symmetry axis of the nw , while @xmath35 and @xmath36 point in the radial and azimuthal direction , respectively . from @xmath37",
    "it is evident that the cartesian coordinates @xmath38 and @xmath39 are related to @xmath31 and @xmath32 through @xmath40 and @xmath41 ( the @xmath33 axis is the same in both coordinate systems ) .",
    "we wish to emphasize that we use @xmath42 throughout this work in order to avoid confusion with the density @xmath43 , and so @xmath44 .",
    "detailed information about the stress and strain tensor elements in cartesian and cylindrical coordinates is provided in appendixes [ secsub : transformation2ndranktensors ] and [ secsub : strainincylindricalcoords ] .",
    "finally , we note that eq .",
    "( [ eq : stressstrainrelnw ] ) is independent of the growth direction of the nw because of the isotropic approximation .",
    "an interface between two materials of mismatched lattice constants induces a static strain field . in core / shell nws ,",
    "such an interface is present at the core radius @xmath45 .",
    "when the lattice constants in core ( @xmath46 ) and shell ( @xmath47 ) are different , the system will tend to match these for reasons of energy minimization .",
    "for instance , @xmath48 and @xmath49 for ge / si core / shell nws @xcite , and so the shell tends to compress the core lattice , strongly affecting the properties of the confined hole gas @xcite .",
    "below , we analyze the strain in core / shell nws and derive algebraic expressions for both the inner and outer part of the heterostructure .",
    "the resulting static strain is found by assuming a coherent interface between the two materials , i.e. , pseudomorphic growth .",
    "we consider the limit of an infinite wire , which applies well away from the ends of the nw @xcite when the length @xmath50 is much larger than the shell radius @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "our approach is similar to those used previously @xcite .",
    "when the strain changes slowly on the scale of the lattice spacing , the displacement field leads to the distorted lattice vectors @xcite @xmath53 when viewed from an atom at position @xmath54 in the core ( @xmath55 ) or shell ( @xmath56 ) , respectively , where @xmath8 are the orthonormal basis vectors of the lattice , @xmath57 is a vector with integer components @xmath58 , and @xmath59 is the kronecker delta .",
    "pseudomorphic strain requires the components of the distorted lattice vectors in core and shell that are parallel to the interface to match at the core - shell transition .",
    "thus , @xmath60 , where @xmath61 stands for an arbitrary tangent to the core - shell interface .",
    "using cylindrical coordinates , the two orthogonal directions @xmath36 and @xmath34 are the basis vectors for any @xmath61 , which results in the boundary conditions @xmath62 and @xmath63 at radius @xmath45 .",
    "furthermore , the core - shell transition needs to be spatially matched in the radial direction , i.e. , there should be no unrealistic gaps or overlaps between the two materials at the interface .    in order to ensure pseudomorphic strain , we start from an initial configuration where the shell is unstrained and the core is highly strained , such that the lattice constant of the core matches the one in the shell @xcite . of course , this initial arrangement is unstable , and so the system will relax into a stable and energetically favored configuration .",
    "considering the continuum limit , the requirements for a coherent interface at @xmath64 can now be summarized in a simple form @xcite , @xmath65 where the @xmath66 , in contrast to the @xmath67 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : distorted_lattice_vecs ] ) , denote the displacement from the initially matched configuration .",
    "that is , @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "as illustrated in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ucanductildemain ] ) , the displacement field @xmath70 in the core can be described by a sum of two parts . when the lattice constant changes from @xmath46 to @xmath47 , the term @xmath71 shifts an atom that is originally located at @xmath72 to its new position @xmath73 .",
    "additional displacement from this new position is then accounted for by @xmath74 .",
    "consequently , the strain tensor elements @xmath75 in the core and shell read @xmath76_{\\mbox{\\footnotesize{$\\bm{r}^\\prime = a_s\\bm{r}/a_{c , s}$ } } } \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\frac{a_s - a_{c , s}}{a_{c , s } } \\delta_{ij } , \\label{eq : strainelemscoreshellmain}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath77 .",
    "the resulting strain tensor @xmath78 is linearly related to the stress tensor @xmath79 via the lam constants [ eq .  ( [ eq : stressstrainrelnw ] ) ] . as additional boundary conditions ,",
    "the stress must be continuous at the interface @xcite and we assume that the shell surface is free of forces , @xmath80 next , using the above - mentioned boundary conditions , we derive algebraic expressions for the static strain in core / shell nws .      from symmetry considerations ,",
    "the displacement in both core and shell must be of the form @xmath81 where we introduced @xmath82 for convenience .",
    "for the displacement field to be static , the differential equations @xmath83 need to be solved in the absence of body forces @xcite , and in doing so we find @xmath84 where @xmath85 and @xmath86 are the lam parameters in the core and shell , respectively .",
    "the coefficients @xmath87 to @xmath88 are to be determined from the boundary conditions .",
    "since the displacement must be finite in the center , we first conclude that @xmath89 .",
    "second , also @xmath90 because @xmath91 must vanish at the surface [ eq .",
    "( [ eq : boundarycond_nostress ] ) ] , and so the @xmath92 are constants . consequently , one obtains @xmath93 with @xmath94 as the resulting ( equilibrium ) lattice constant in the @xmath33 direction . from the boundary conditions listed in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : boundarycond_contdispl ] ) , ( [ eq : boundarycond_contstress ] ) , and ( [ eq : boundarycond_nostress ] ) , we can express all nonzero coefficients @xmath95 and @xmath87 in terms of @xmath94 only .",
    "the latter can finally be found by minimizing the elastic energy of the system .",
