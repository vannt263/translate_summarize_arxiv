    "highly excited many - particle states in many - body systems quite often can be presented as `` chaotic '' superpositions of shell - model basis states , see recent calculations for complex atoms @xcite , multicharged ions @xcite , nuclei @xcite and spin systems @xcite . the origin of this phenomenon relates to a very high density of many - particle energy levels , which increases drastically with an increase of energy .",
    "indeed , the number @xmath4 of combinations in the distribution of @xmath5 particles ( or quasi - particles ) over @xmath6 `` orbitals '' ( single - particle states ) is exponentially large ( @xmath7 in a fermi system ) .",
    "therefore , the spacing @xmath8 between many - body levels is exponentially small and a `` residual '' interaction @xmath9 between the particles can mix a huge number of the basis states of a mean field @xmath10 ( slater determinants ) , when forming exact eigenstates of the total hamiltonian @xmath11 .",
    "the onset of chaos for highly excited states , as well as for many - particle spectra , has been recently studied in great detail in terms of the two - body random interaction ( tbri ) model which was invented about three decades ago @xcite . in this model",
    "all _ two - body _ matrix elements are assumed to be independent and random variables , therefore all dynamical correlations are neglected .",
    "thus , the tbri model is essentially the random matrix model , however , it differs from standard random matrix models where the two - body nature of interaction is not taken into account ( see , e.g. @xcite and review @xcite ) .",
    "one of the important results obtained recently @xcite in the frame of this model is the anderson - like transition which occurs in the fock space determined by many - particle states of @xmath10 .",
    "the critical value @xmath12 for this transition is determined by the density of states @xmath13 of those basis states which are directly coupled by a two - body interaction @xcite .",
    "when the interaction is very weak , @xmath14 , exact eigenstates are delta - like functions in the unperturbed basis , with a very small admixture of other components which can be found by the standard perturbation theory . with an increase of the interaction , the number of principal components @xmath15 increases and can be very large , @xmath16 .",
    "however , if the interaction is still not too strong , @xmath17 @xcite , the eigenstates are sparse , with extremely large fluctuations of components . in order to have ergodic eigenstates which fill some energy range ( see below ) , one needs to have the perturbation large enough , @xmath18(for a large number of particles this transition is sharp and , in fact , one needs the weaker condition , @xmath19 ) .    above the threshold of chaos , @xmath19 ,",
    "the number of principal basis components in an eigenstate can be estimated as @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the spreading width of the _ strength function_. in such chaotic eigenstates any external weak perturbation is exponentially enhanced .",
    "the enhancement factor can be estimated as @xmath22 , see e.g. @xcite and references therein .",
    "this huge enhancement have been observed in numerous experiments when studying parity violation effects in compound nuclei ( see , for example , review @xcite ) .    in recent works",
    "@xcite the theory of many - body chaos has been extended to quantum computers . since in this case",
    "the density of energy levels is extremely high , it is often impossible to resolve particular many - body levels .",
    "this happens for the injection of an electron into a many - electron quantum dot , for the capture of an energetic particle by a nucleus or atom , or for different models of quantum computer with a large number of interacting qubits ( spins ) . in this case",
    "the approach based on the study of stationary chaotic eigenstates turns out to be not an adequate one , and one should consider the time evolution of a wave function and entropy @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the study of spectra and eigenstates , the analysis of the evolution of wave packets in random matrix models is based mainly on numerical results . in the first line",
    ", one should mention the numerical study @xcite of band random matrices that describe quasi-1d disordered models with finite number of channels .",
    "recently , the attention has been paid to the so - called wigner band random ( wbrm ) model @xcite which is used in the study of generic properties of strength functions in dependence on the strength of interaction @xcite . in particular , in refs.@xcite the problem of the quantum - classical correspondence for the time evolution of wave packets was under close study .",
    "we note that the wbrm model serves as convenient random matrix model for different quantum systems , and in many aspects can be compared with the tbri model @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we study generic properties of the evolution of wave packets in the energy shell , paying the main attention to the time - dependence of the entropy , width of packets , and inverse participation ratio .",
    "we derive analytical estimates for these quantities and check numerically our predictions with the use of the tbri and wbrm models .",
    "exact ( `` compound '' ) eigenstates @xmath23 of a many - body hamiltonian @xmath11 can be expressed in terms of simple shell - model basis states @xmath24 ( eigenstates of @xmath10 ) , or by products of qubits in a model of quantum computer : @xmath25 here @xmath26 are creation , or spin - raising , operators ( in the latter case , the ground state @xmath27 corresponds to the situation with all spins down ) , and @xmath28 are components of compound eigenstates @xmath29 formed by the residual interaction @xmath9 .    in what follows ,",
    "we consider the time evolution of the system for the case when compound eigenstates are",
    "_ chaotic_. by this term we mean that the number of principal components is very large , @xmath30 , and the components @xmath28 can be treated as uncorrelated amplitudes with the gaussian distribution around their mean values , see details in @xcite .",
    "let us assume that initially ( @xmath31 ) the system is in a specific basis state @xmath32 ( with certain orbitals occupied , or , in the case of a quantum computer , when the state with certain spins `` up '' is prepared ) .",
    "this state can be presented as a sum over exact eigenstates of the total hamiltonian @xmath33 : @xmath34 then the time - dependent wave function reads as @xmath35 here the sum is taken over the compound states @xmath36 and basis states @xmath37 , and we set @xmath38 .",
    "the probability @xmath39 to find the system in the initial state is determined by the amplitude @xmath40 here we replaced the summation over a large number of the eigenstates by the integration over their energies @xmath41 , and introduced the _ strength function _ ( sf ) @xmath42 which is also known in the literature as the _ local spectral density of states _ , ldos , @xmath43 with @xmath44 as the density of exact eigenstates .",
    "as one can see , the probability @xmath45 is entirely determined by the strength function ( [ strength ] ) .",
    "it is well known that in many applications this function has the breit - wigner ( bw ) form with a half - width @xmath46 . in our case",
    "@xmath47 is the density of directly coupled basis states and @xmath48 is the variance of the non - zero off - diagonal elements of @xmath33 , defined by the residual interaction @xmath49 .",
    "one should remind that in real situations the second moment @xmath50 of the sf is always finite due to a finite range of interaction in the energy representation .",
    "therefore , the breit - wigner form of the sf can occur for a finite energy range only , determined by the energy width of the interaction .",
    "however , it was recently shown ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) that if @xmath51 defined by the above expression , is of the order ( or larger ) of the mean - square - root width @xmath52 of the sf itself , the form of the sf in the tbri model is very close to the gaussian .",
    "strong deviations of the sf from the bw - dependence have been observed numerically when studying the structure of the sf and eigenfunctions of the ce atom @xcite . also",
    ", numerical data @xcite have revealed that the form of the sf in nuclear shell models is much closer to the gaussian rather that to the bw .",
    "this results from the fact that the three orbitals @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 included into the nuclear shell - model calculation @xcite , have close mean - field energies and the residual interaction @xmath9 plays the dominant role in the hamiltonian matrix .",
    "recent analytical results @xcite for the tbri model allow to describe the whole transition for the sf from the bw regime to that of the gaussian .",
    "this model is characterized by two - body random matrix elements which determine the residual interaction @xmath9 between @xmath5 fermi - particles occupying @xmath6 orbitals ( single - particle states ) , see details and references , for example , in @xcite .",
    "it was shown that in general case the sf is given by the following approximate expression @xcite , @xmath56 @xmath57 one can see that the general expression ( [ ffbw ] ) is of the breit - wigner form , however , with @xmath58 as some function of the total energy @xmath59 . here",
    "@xmath60 is the correction to the unperturbed energy level @xmath61 due to the residual interaction @xmath9 , and @xmath62 is the density of those basis states @xmath24 which are directly coupled by the interaction @xmath63 with the initial state @xmath32 .",
    "it was shown @xcite that for the tbri model the function @xmath58 has the gaussian form with the variance which depends on the model parameters .",
    "in the case of relatively small ( but non - perturbative ) interaction , @xmath64 , the function @xmath58 is very broad ( i.e. it does not change significantly within the energy intervals @xmath65 and @xmath66 ) and can be treated as the constant , @xmath67 . in the other limit case of a strong interaction , @xmath68 , the dependence @xmath58 in ( [ ffbw ] ) is the leading one , and the slow dependence in the denominator can be neglected .",
    "one should note that the simple expression ( [ gammah ] ) for the width @xmath58 has to be modified in this limit , see details in @xcite .",
    "the second moment @xmath50 of the sf can be found from the equation @xmath69 . here",
    "the summation is taken over the off - diagonal matrix elements @xmath63 which couple the initial state @xmath70 with the others @xmath71 .",
    "for the tbri model the analytical expression for @xmath52 has been obtained in @xcite , @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the variance of the off - diagonal matrix elements of the two - body residual interaction @xmath9 .",
    "in fact , for fermi - particles the width @xmath74 turns out to be the same for any basis state @xmath75 .",
    "let us first start with the probability @xmath76 of the system to stay in the initial state . in two limit cases of small and very large times ,",
    "the dependence @xmath45 is shown @xcite to be of the following forms , @xmath77 and @xmath78 here @xmath79 is the imaginary part of the pole of the sf ( see eq.([ffbw ] ) in the complex energy plane . in the case",
    "when the sf has the standard bw form , we have the obvious relation @xmath80 where the latter is given by the fermi golden rule . in other limit of a strong interaction ,",
    "when the sf has the gaussian form , the expression for @xmath81 is not simple .",
    "the transition from one regime of the time dependence of @xmath82 to another is schematically shown in fig.1 .",
    "now we estimate the probabilities @xmath83 to find the system in other basis states . for a very small time we have , @xmath84 note , that only the states directly connected to the initial state are populated at this time scale .",
    "one can estimate the population of these states for a larger time by substituting the time - dependent wave function @xmath85 into the schrodinger equation , @xmath86 here @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "note that the second term in the right - hand - side may be treated as a random variable with the zero mean value .",
    "indeed , @xmath89 , therefore , @xmath90 . the variance of this term is @xmath91 ) , one may conclude that the second term is not very important for small times when @xmath92 . neglecting the second term and assuming @xmath93",
    "which is valid for @xmath94 , we obtain @xcite , @xmath95 where @xmath96 .",
    "this approximate estimate shows that only the basis states within the energy interval @xmath97 can be substantially populated ( if @xmath98 , this energy interval is equal to @xmath99 ) .    for large time",
    ", the result is different for perturbative and chaotic regimes . in the perturbative regime",
    "the expression ( [ wf ] ) for @xmath100 is the final one . in the chaotic regime",
    "the asymptotic expression for @xmath101 can be obtained in the following way .",
    "the projection of @xmath102 ( see eq . ( [ psit ] ) ) onto the state @xmath37 gives @xmath103 @xmath104 here the result is written for the case when the sf has the bw form both for initial @xmath32 and final state @xmath24 with the corresponding half - widths @xmath105 and @xmath106 . in this case",
    "the resulting form of @xmath107 is , approximately , again the breit - wigner with the new half - width @xmath108 .",
    "however , if @xmath109 , the form of @xmath107 is close to the gaussian with the variance @xmath110 @xcite .",
    "the term @xmath111 can be written in the form , @xmath112 at large time , @xmath113 , the terms in the sum rapidly oscillate and one can put @xmath114 . thus , asymptotically the distribution of the components in the time - dependent wave function is close to that given by the form of the strength function ( see eqs.([strength ] , [ ffbw ] ) ) , with a slightly larger spreading width .",
    "note that similar expression for @xmath45 contains the term @xmath115 . for gaussian fluctuations of the components @xmath116",
    ", one can get @xmath117 = 3 @xmath118 which is the known result in the random matrix theory @xcite . therefore",
    ", if the number of principal components @xmath15 in the sf is very large , the probability to find the system in the initial state @xmath32 at large time is , at least , three times larger than the probability to find the system in any other state @xmath24 , see figs .",
    "2,3 .    in these figures",
    "the distribution of probabilities @xmath100 in the tbri model is shown after a very long time @xmath119 for two different strengths of interaction ( in fact , the time @xmath120 is measured in units @xmath121 where @xmath122 is the mean level spacing between single - particle energies @xmath123 ) . in both cases @xmath124 fermi - particles occupy @xmath125 orbitals , therefore , the total number of many - particle states ( the size of the hamiltonian matrix ) is @xmath126 .",
    "the distribution of @xmath127 is taken random with @xmath128 .",
    "two - body matrix elements are taken as gaussian random entries with the zero mean and variance @xmath73 , and in order to reduce the fluctuations , the distribution @xmath100 is obtained with an average over a number @xmath129 of matrices with different random realizations .",
    "initially , only one basis state @xmath130 was populated at the center of the energy spectrum , in order to avoid the asymmetry of the distribution in the basis representation .",
    "the two different values of @xmath131 , for which the distributions @xmath100 are obtained , are chosen in such a way that in one case , see fig.2 , the strength function has the breit - wigner form , and in the other , the form is very close to the gaussian ( fig.3 ) .",
    "we should remind that the above two forms occur in the energy representation , however , the results are shown in the basis representation .",
    "these two representations are related through the density of states which is known to be of the gaussian form for large number of particles and orbitals @xcite .",
    "one can see that in both cases , fig.2 - 3 , the probability to stay in the original basis state is much larger than in the nearest ones . comparing with the result of the standard random matrix theory , one can say that there is a noticeable difference ( namely , the enhancement factor in fig.3 is about 2.3 , instead of 3.0 ) .",
    "one of the important question is how the entropy of quantum isolated systems increases in time at the transition to equilibrium .",
    "it is natural to define the entropy of a many - body state through the shannon entropy , @xmath132 here @xmath133 is the probability for the system to be in the initial state , and @xmath134 is the probability to be in the basis state @xmath24 . in what follows",
    "we assume that the initial conditions are @xmath135 and @xmath136 , therefore , the entropy is equal to zero for @xmath31 .    in order to study the evolution of a many - particle system with two - body interaction , it is convenient to introduce sub - classes for all basis states in the following way .",
    "the _ first class _ contains those @xmath137 basis states which are directly coupled with an initial state by the two - body interaction given by matrix elements @xmath138 of the interaction .",
    "correspondingly , the _ second class _ consists of @xmath139 basis states which are coupled with the initial one in the second order of the perturbation , this coupling is determined by @xmath140 , etc .",
    "let us first consider the evolution for a large time @xmath141 ( below we assume the bw shape of the sf ) .",
    "for this case the probabilities of the states in different classes can be determined by the  probability conservation equations \" , @xmath142 @xmath143 @xmath144 @xmath145 @xmath144 here @xmath146 is the probability for the systems to be in the class @xmath36 .",
    "the first term @xmath147 in the right - hand - side of ( [ weq ] ) is responsible for the flux from the previous class , and the second term @xmath148 describes the decay of the states in the class @xmath36 , into the next class @xmath149 .",
    "we assume that the probability of the return to the previous class can be neglected .",
    "this is a valid approximation if the number of states @xmath150 in the next class is large in comparison with @xmath151 of the previous class .",
    "this approach can be compared with those based on the caley tree model @xcite where the flow from each state goes into other @xmath152 states , therefore , @xmath153 with @xmath154 .",
    "note that here we consider a system which is far from the equilibrium .",
    "indeed , if the system is in the equilibrium , the probabilities of all states within the energy shell defined by the relation @xmath155 , are of the same order , @xmath156 , with @xmath15 as the total number of states inside the energy shell .",
    "therefore , in order to neglect the return flux , one needs the condition @xmath157 to be fulfilled .",
    "equations ( [ weq ] ) have the simple solution , @xmath158 @xmath159 the maximal probability @xmath160 to be in the class @xmath5 determined by the condition @xmath161 , occurs for @xmath162 , therefore , this solution ( [ sol ] ) can be considered as a _ cascade _ in the population of different classes .",
    "indeed , at small times @xmath163 the system is practically in the initial state , at times @xmath164 the flow spreads into the first class , for @xmath165 it spreads into the @xmath166th class , etc . for an infinite chain one can easily check the normalization condition , @xmath167",
    "the above expressions allow us to find the time - dependence of the entropy , @xmath168\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath169 stands for the population of basis states of the class @xmath5 with @xmath170 as the number of states in this class ( in fact , for @xmath171 one needs to count only the states inside the energy shell since the population of the states outside the energy interval with @xmath172 , is small , see eq.([wf ] ) ) . here",
    "we have used the relations @xmath173 and @xmath174 .",
    "two last terms in the right - hand - side of eq.([s(t ) ] ) turn out to be smaller than the first one , therefore , one can write , @xmath175\\ ] ] with some function @xmath176 which slowly depends on time .    in this estimate for the increase of entropy",
    ", we did not take into account the influence of fluctuations of @xmath100 .",
    "one can show that for gaussian fluctuations of the coefficients @xmath177 with the variance given by their mean - square values , for large number of principal components @xmath178 the entropy should be corrected by a small factor of the order of @xmath179 ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "if one neglects the second term in ( [ sff ] ) , we obtain a linear increase of the entropy , which means that the number of principal components @xmath180 increases exponentially fast with time .",
    "this behavior can be compared with a linear increase of dynamical entropy @xmath181 in classical chaotic systems where @xmath181 was found to be related to an exponential divergence of close trajectories in the phase space ( @xmath182 with @xmath183 as the lyapunov exponent , see , for example @xcite ) .",
    "the non - trivial point is that the linear increase of entropy also occurs for systems without the classical limit , see recent paper @xcite .",
    "note , that for a small time the function @xmath76 has the form @xmath184 ( see ( [ wgauss ] ) ) , not the exponential dependence @xmath185 .",
    "therefore , one should modify the expression for the entropy in order to make it valid for small times . for this",
    ", we replace @xmath186 in eq.([sol ] ) by a more accurate expression , @xmath187 , which gives @xmath188 for small time @xmath189 and @xmath190 for large time @xmath191 , therefore , @xmath192 it is easy to check that the normalization condition is fulfilled again , @xmath193 for the entropy one obtains @xmath194    at small time @xmath195the entropy is given by two terms , @xmath196 and @xmath197 ( direct transitions ) , therefore , @xmath198 this expression can be compared with the direct calculation based on the relation @xmath199 , @xmath200 there is an agreement between eqs.([sfinal ] ) and ( [ pert ] ) since @xmath201 .",
    "let us now discuss the whole time dependence of the entropy , including large times @xmath120 when the system is close to the equilibrium .",
    "in a finite system of particles any basis state can be reached , starting from an initial state , in several `` interaction steps '' @xmath202 .",
    "for example , in the system of @xmath124 particles three steps is needed since the two - body interaction can not move more than two particles from one basis state to another .",
    "if the number of classes @xmath203 is finite , the states in the last class do not decay ( there is no term @xmath204 in the last equation in ( [ weq ] ) ) , and the probability to be in the last class is determined from the normalization condition @xmath205 .",
    "the additional condition is that the considered basis states should be inside the energy interval , @xmath206 , thus limiting the number @xmath170 of the basis states in each class . note that the value of @xmath207 is restricted from below by the equilibrium relation @xmath208 .",
    "these limitations make `` exact '' expression for the entropy very complicated .",
    "instead , we can propose the following simple expression which is approximately valid in systems with a small number of classes ( @xmath209 ) , @xmath210 this expression takes into account the normalization condition @xmath211 and has a reasonable behavior for both small and large times .",
    "now we compare the obtained analytical expressions with numerical data for the tbri model . for the case when the strength function ( sf ) has the breit - wigner form , the time dependence of the entropy is shown in fig.4 for the parameters of fig.2 , @xmath212 , with the average over @xmath213 hamiltonian matrices .",
    "the number @xmath152 of the basis states directly coupled by the random two - body interaction , is determined by the expression @xcite , @xmath214 where the first term gives the number of one - particle transitions , and the second stands for two - particles transitions . in our case of @xmath124 particles and @xmath125 orbitals , the total number of basis states is @xmath215 and @xmath216 .",
    "the _ effective number _ of classes in the cascade model can be determined from the relation @xmath217 .",
    "this gives @xmath218 .",
    "thus , we can use the simple expression ( [ sappr ] ) to describe the dependence of the entropy on time analytically .",
    "the data in figs.4 - 5 demonstrate an excellent agreement between the numerical and analytical results .",
    "we should note that the theoretical dependence ( [ sappr ] ) which gives quite good approximate description of the data on the whole time scale , has the parameter @xmath15 ( effective number of principal components in the stationary distribution @xmath219 which is related to the limiting value of the entropy , @xmath220 .",
    "it can be estimated analytically as discussed above from the width of the energy shell ; when plotting the solid curves in figs.4 - 5 we have used the exact value found numerically .    to avoid confusion",
    ", we should explain that the _ actual number _ of classes in the case of @xmath124 particles and @xmath125 orbitals is equal to @xmath221 since all basis states can be populated in the third order in the two - body interaction .",
    "however , the number of states in the second , @xmath222 , and third , @xmath223 , classes are much smaller than it may follow from the exponential relation @xmath224 ( in practice , this relation may be justified for a large number of particles only ) .",
    "this is the reason why the one - class formula ( [ sappr ] ) works so well .",
    "it is also instructive to compare the entropy with the linear time dependence , @xmath225 that stems from eq.([sff ] ) if the first term is taken only .",
    "this dependence globally corresponds to the data on some time scale , however , the actual dependence for @xmath226 clearly differs from the linear one ( see inset in fig.4 ) .",
    "note that the quadratic increase of energy occurs on a very small time scale only .",
    "as for the oscillations of the entropy for a very large time close to an equilibrium , this phenomenon will be discussed below .    for a strong interaction , when the form of the sf is very close to the gaussian , numerical data are reported in fig.5 for @xmath227 and for @xmath228 . the interaction strength is chosen in order to have the same ratio @xmath229 , as in fig.4 .    in this case the half - width of the strength function is determined by @xmath74 since @xmath230 is larger than @xmath52 . as a result , the role of @xmath231 in the expressions ( [ sff ] ) and ( [ sappr ] ) plays the width @xmath52 . in both cases",
    "numerical data give strong evidence of a linear increase of the entropy , @xmath232 before the saturation .",
    "it is clearly seen that this analytical estimate gives a correct value for the slope of @xmath226 .",
    "the shift is due to the initial time scale where the time dependence is quadratic , this fact is neglected in the estimate .",
    "it should be pointed out that the linear dependence of @xmath226 in fig.5 is much more pronounced than in the bw - region ( compare with fig.4 for which the sf is of the breit - wigner form ) .",
    "our results indicate a clear difference between the two cases related to the breit - wigner and gaussian forms of the sf .",
    "this point is somehow supported by recent studies @xcite where it was shown that for a relatively weak interaction ( @xmath233 is small in comparison with @xmath66 ) resulting in the breit - wigner form of the sf , there is no detailed quantum - classical correspondence for the evolution of wave packets in the energy space .",
    "on the other hand , in the gaussian region ( with the gaussian form for the sf ) , the detailed quantum - classical correspondence is possible @xcite . in the latter case",
    "one can expect a linear growth for the entropy , as it was found in classical models @xcite .",
    "the principal difference between these two cases ( in what concerns the quantum - classical correspondence and the possibility of the localization in the energy shell ) for the first time has been discussed in ref.@xcite .",
    "the width of the wave function in the basis representation can be measured through the variance , @xmath234 @xmath235 where @xmath236 and @xmath237 label corresponding basis states , @xmath238 , and we have used the normalization condition @xmath239 .",
    "the function @xmath240 is a slow function of time , it changes from the effective band - width of the hamiltonian matrix , entirely determined by the matrix elements @xmath63 , to the final width of the wave packet in the basis representation , which is defined by the width of the energy shell ( approximately equal to @xmath241 ) .",
    "therefore , the leading time dependence is given by the term @xmath242 .",
    "for relatively small times before the saturation , we can use the simple estimate @xmath243 , which results in the following quadratic dependence , @xmath244 here @xmath245 is some constant related to an effective band - width of the hamiltonian matrix .",
    "the linear dependence for the width of packet , @xmath246 , corresponds to a generic ballistic - like behavior of wave packets found for the wbrm model @xcite .",
    "note that the band - width of the hamiltonian matrix can be much larger than the final width of the wave packet due to the dependence of the latter on the interaction strength .",
    "therefore , the linear increase of @xmath0 can be very fast , and quickly it becomes saturated on the time scale of the applicability of the expansion in @xmath247 , see eq .",
    "( [ deltat ] ) .    before comparing the obtained expressions with numerical data ,",
    "let us first analyze the time dependence of the number of principal components @xmath248 for wave packets in the basis representation .",

    "this definition has been widely used in different applications , see for example , @xcite .",
    "the number of principal components can be also defined through the inverse participation ratio @xmath251 : @xmath252 here we used eq.([wn ] ) for @xmath146 .",
    "the sum in eq.([npc ] ) gives the following result for the infinite number of classes ( this may be a reasonable approximation for time @xmath253 ) @xmath254 where @xmath255 stands for the modified bessel function and we used the relation @xmath173 .",
    "this expression has the following asymptotics , @xmath256 for small time , and @xmath257 for large time .",
    "therefore , @xmath15 defined through the inverse participation ratio @xmath251 also may have an interval of exponential increase in time ( if the number of classes @xmath203 is not small and we can extend the summation over @xmath36 in eq .",
    "( [ npc ] ) to infinity ) .",
    "here we again neglected the fluctuations of @xmath258 which may increase the value of @xmath259 up to the factor @xmath221 .    for",
    "a system with small number of classes on can suggest the following approximate expression , @xmath260 this expression takes into account the normalization condition @xmath261 and has a reasonable behavior for both small and large time .    in any system with finite number of particles the energy shell contains finite number of basis states . for a stationary chaotic state",
    "the number of principal components is estimated as @xmath262 where @xmath8 is the mean energy distance between many - particle levels ( we assume here that the spreading width @xmath263 of exact eigenstates is less than @xmath52 ) . in the non - stationary problem",
    "this leads to the saturation of @xmath264 to the value @xmath265 , and to the maximal value @xmath266 for the entropy ( see above and in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    numerical data for the tbri model for the case when the sf is of the breit - wigner form are summarized in fig.6 for the same parameters as in fig.2 and fig.4 .",
    "three quantities are plotted here : the width @xmath0 , the number of principal components @xmath267 and @xmath268 determined by the inverse participation ratio . for @xmath248 two curves are given , one is due to the analytical expression ( [ sappr ] ) for the entropy , and another is computed directly from the evolution of the tbri model , with additional average over @xmath213 number of realization of random hamiltonian .    from the reported data one can see that the time dependence of the width @xmath0 of packets is quite simple .",
    "namely , on the first very short time scale the increase of the width is linear in time ( see also inset in fig.6 where @xmath0 is shown on this time scale ) , and after , the width quickly saturates .",
    "this behavior is in the correspondence with analytical estimates discussed above , and with numerical results found in the wbrm model @xcite .",
    "in contrast to this time dependence , the increase of the number of principal components @xmath248 is very different , both for @xmath248 defined by the entropy and for the @xmath269 determined by the inverse participation ratio . indeed ,",
    "both @xmath248 and @xmath269 increase slowly in time before the saturation to their limit values .",
    "the absolute difference between these two quantities is not important since the definition of @xmath251 is given up to some factor which is sensitive to the type of fluctuations in @xmath270 .",
    "as we already noted , the gaussian fluctuations decrease the value of @xmath251 by the factor @xmath221 .",
    "one of the most interesting facts which can be drawn from these data is a big difference for characteristic time scales which correspond to the saturation . indeed ,",
    "if the width @xmath0 completely saturates at time @xmath271 , both @xmath15 and @xmath251 manifest a very slow saturation by the time @xmath272 .",
    "this means that the mechanism for the width increase is different from that responsible for the increase of the number of principal components in the wave packet .    to explain this phenomenon",
    "let us consider the initial time scale for the time dependence of @xmath15 and @xmath251 , where one can detect an approximate linear increase of the entropy @xmath226 .",
    "the very point is that at small times @xmath273 the wave function has a large number of holes since only directly connected basis states are populated . for a system with a large number @xmath5 of particles",
    "the fraction of these states is exponentially small @xmath274 due a two - body nature of the interaction . with an increase of time , for @xmath275 ,",
    "the states in other classes start to be filled and the holes begin disappear .",
    "this stage for @xmath276 corresponds to an exponential increase of the number of principal components and linear increase of the entropy .",
    "it is instructive to analyze the evolution of wave packets on a smaller time scale of the ballistic spread , see fig.7 .",
    "these data confirm theoretical expectations according to which at small times only those basis states that belong to the first class , are involved in the dynamics . indeed , large gaps are clearly seen in the distribution of @xmath100 , which persist during all the time of the ballistic - like spread .",
    "these gaps reduce the number of the principal components , however , they are not important for the calculation of @xmath277 , see eq.([delta ] ) .",
    "an important peculiarity of the wave dynamics is that initially _ all _ basis states of the first class are excited .",
    "one can see that for a very small time @xmath278 the whole available region @xmath279 is filled with approximately the same amplitudes @xmath280 . with an increase of time ,",
    "the amplitudes grow and form the envelope of the packet , in accordance with eq.([wf ] ) .",
    "one should stress that the quadratic time dependence for the second moment of a packet on this short - time scale occurs not due to a linear spread of the front of the wave packet , but due to a specific growth of the amplitudes of those basis states which are located inside the energy shell .",
    "the remarkable effect is a kind of oscillations for all quantities of fig.6 .",
    "similar oscillations ( however , not so strong ) are also present in the time dependence of the entropy @xmath226 , see fig.4 . since the period @xmath281 of these oscillations is much larger than the time scale @xmath282 of the ballistic spread of wave packets , it is clear that this effect is entirely related to the dynamics in the fock space formed by different classes .",
    "the origin of these oscillations can be explained in terms of the cascade model discussed in section iii .",
    "indeed , one can expect a strong effect of a _ reflection _ due to the finiteness of the fock space .",
    "the first reflection occurs for @xmath283 , therefore , the period of oscillation is @xmath284 .",
    "one can see that this estimate gives the correct result for @xmath285 with @xmath286 .",
    "the latter value is close to our rough estimate @xmath287 for an effective number of classes .    to compare the data for @xmath251 defined by the inverse participation ratio with the analytical expression ( [ nfinal ] ) , we have plotted separately both results for a larger time scale @xmath288 in fig.8 .",
    "one can see that our estimate ( [ nfinal ] ) gives quite accurate description of the data on a large time scale up to @xmath289 .",
    "after this time , the saturation occurs and all local time dependence may be treated as fluctuations around the limiting value .",
    "the data presented in this figure give strong evidence of the effectiveness of our analytical approach .",
    "let us now come to the case when the form of the strength function is close to the gaussian . in fig.9 one can see that the analytical expressions connecting the probability @xmath76 to stay in an initial basis state , with the time dependence of the number of principal components @xmath250 and @xmath269 , give correct global description of numerical data .",
    "when comparing with the previous case of the bw - form of the sf , see figs.6,8 , one can conclude that for a strong interaction ( when the gaussian dependence for the sf emerges ) the behavior of all quantities do not reveal strong oscillations .",
    "this effect is related to the fact that the time scale for the saturation of the width of packets is of the same order as for the saturation of both @xmath15 and @xmath251 .",
    "in such a case the effect of reflection in the fock space is suppressed by a strong spread of packets in the energy shell .",
    "one can see , that there is a quite strong difference in the time - dependence of all discussed above quantities for the two extreme cases of the breit - wigner and gaussian forms of the strength function . in the bw - case the two effects ( ballistic - like spread of packets and the cascade - like evolution in the fock space ) have very different time scales , and both these effects can be distinguished in the dynamics .",
    "contrary , in the second case of the gaussian form of the sf , two time scales are comparable",
    ". therefore , the two effects coexist on the same time scale and , as a result , the global time - dependence turns out to be much simpler .",
    "in this section we discuss numerical results obtained for the wbrm model for the same quantities as the considered above .",
    "the dynamics of wave packets in this model has been recently studied in @xcite in the connection with the problem of quantum - classical correspondence . here , instead , we concentrate our attention on the correspondence between the evolution of packets in the wbrm and tbri models .",
    "as was mentioned , the wbrm model is quite close to the tbri model .",
    "it consists of two parts , one of which is a diagonal matrix with increasing  energies \" @xmath290 and another is a band matrix @xmath291 , @xmath292 where @xmath293 is the delta - function . in original papers @xcite the `` unperturbed spectrum '' was taken in the form of the `` picked fence '' , @xmath294 , where @xmath295 is the spacing between two close energies and @xmath296 is a running integer number .",
    "we consider here the case with random values @xmath297 with the mean spacing @xmath8 , reordered in an increasing way , @xmath298 . as for the off - diagonal matrix elements",
    "@xmath291 , they are assumed to be gaussian random and independent variables inside the band @xmath299 , with the zero mean , @xmath300 , and the variance @xmath301 . outside the band ,",
    "the matrix elements vanish .",
    "thus , the control parameters of this model are the ratio @xmath302 of a typical matrix element to the mean level spacing , and the band - width @xmath303 .",
    "as one can see , the first term in ( [ wbrm ] ) corresponds to a `` mean field '' @xmath10 , and the interaction @xmath9 has a finite energy range .",
    "for the first time the sf for the wbrm has been analyzed in ref .",
    "it was analytically found that the form of the strength function essentially depends on one parameter @xmath304 only .",
    "wigner has proved @xcite that for a relatively strong perturbation , @xmath305 , in the limit @xmath306 the form of the ldos is the lorentzian ,    @xmath307    which nowadays is known as the breit - wigner ( bw ) dependence . here",
    "the energy @xmath308 refers to the center of the distribution .",
    "the half - width @xmath309 of the distribution ( [ bw ] ) is given by the fermi golden rule , @xmath310    in other limit @xmath311 the influence of the unperturbed part @xmath312 can be neglected and the shape of the sf tends to the shape of density of the states of the band random matrix @xmath9 , which is known to be the semicircle .",
    "recently , wigner s results have been extended in @xcite to matrices @xmath313 with a general form of @xmath9 , when the variance of the off - diagonal matrix elements decreases smoothly with the distance @xmath314 from the principal diagonal . in this case",
    "the effective band size @xmath315 is defined by the second moment of the envelope function @xmath316 .",
    "another important generalization of the wbrm studied in @xcite , is an additional sparsity of the matrix @xmath9 , which may mimic realistic hamiltonians .",
    "in such a form , the wbrm model is closer to the tbri model , however , in the latter the sparsity of the interaction is due to a two - body nature of the interaction . as a result ,",
    "the positions of zero elements are not completely random as in the wbrm model , see details in @xcite .",
    "random matrix models of the type ( [ wbrm ] ) are very useful for the understanding generic properties of the sf .",
    "the condition for the sf to be of the bw form in the wbrm model has simple form @xcite , @xmath317 the left part of this relation indicates the non - perturbative character of an interaction , according to which many of unperturbed basis states are strongly coupled by an interaction . on the other hand",
    ", the interaction should not be very strong , namely , the width @xmath318 determined by eq.([bwgam ] ) , has to be less than the width @xmath319 of the interaction in the energy representation .",
    "the latter condition is generic for systems with finite range of the interaction @xmath9 .",
    "one should stress that , strictly speaking , the bw form ( [ bw ] ) is not correct since its second moment diverges . as was shown in @xcite , outside the energy range @xmath320 is irrelevant since there is no sharp border of the interaction and @xmath321 is of the order of the whole energy spectrum . for this reason , instead of",
    "@xmath321 it is more convenient to use the variance @xmath322 of the sf which may have the classical limit @xcite .",
    "the latter quantity can be expressed through the off - diagonal matrix elements of the interaction , @xmath323 for @xmath324 , therefore , @xmath325 . as a result",
    ", we have @xmath326 and eq.([range1 ] ) can be written as @xmath327    numerical data @xcite for the wbrm model show that on the border @xmath328 the form of the sf is quite close to the gaussian , and this transition from the bw dependence to the gaussian - like turns out to be quite sharp .",
    "although the extreme limit of a very strong interaction , @xmath329 ( or , the same , @xmath330 ) has been studied by wigner in the wbrm model ( [ wbrm ] ) , the semicircle form of the sf seems to be unphysical .",
    "indeed , this form is originated from the semicircle dependence of the total density @xmath331 defined by @xmath9 only , therefore , when neglecting the term @xmath10 .",
    "thus , the case @xmath332 in terms of the tbri model means that the residual interaction is much stronger than the mean - field part @xmath10 , which is physically irrelevant .",
    "numerical data for the wbrm model in the case of the bw - dependence of the sf are given in fig.10 .",
    "when comparing with the corresponding quantities discussed above for the tbri model ( see fig.6 ) we should note the following .",
    "first of all , one can see that the simple analytical expression ( [ sappr ] ) gives a correct description of the increase and saturation of the entropy @xmath333 .",
    "the same we can say about the expression ( [ nfinal ] ) for the number of principal components defined through the inverse participation ratio .",
    "second , we would like to stress that the global time dependence for all quantities is quite similar to that found for the one - class variant of the tbri model .",
    "relatively simple structure of the wigner band random matrices allows one to perform a detailed comparison of the data with analytical estimates .",
    "indeed , the application of the relation ( [ deltat ] ) for the wbrm model gives , @xmath334 see also ref.@xcite .",
    "therefore , for the parameters of fig.10 we have @xmath335 with @xmath336 which is in a good agreement with numerical data .",
    "we can also find the critical time @xmath337 after which the ballistic spread of the packet terminates .",
    "for this , we estimate the maximal width @xmath338 of packet via the width @xmath66 of the sf , @xmath339 .",
    "this leads to the estimate @xmath340 , therefore , for fig.3 we have @xmath341 which perfectly corresponds to the data .",
    "the latter estimates have been also checked for other values of @xmath131 and @xmath303 , with the same good correspondence between simple estimates and numerical data .    comparing global time dependence of the quantities presented in fig.10 with the results for the tbri model ,",
    "see fig.6 , one can see that the main difference is the type of oscillations for the width of packets @xmath0 .",
    "namely , in contrast to the tbri model where the period of oscillations is much larger than the time scale @xmath342 of the ballistic spread , in fig.10 the period @xmath285 is just defined by the ballistic spread , @xmath343 .",
    "this very fact demonstrate the principal difference between the two models .",
    "indeed , for the wbrm model there is no specific evolution in the fock space which is due to a two - body nature of interaction .",
    "formally , the cascade model can be applied to the wbrm model with the number of classes @xmath344 , since all states within the energy band @xmath345 start to be involved in the dynamics immediately .",
    "this means that in contrast to the tbri model , in the wbrm model there is only one mechanism for the oscillations , namely , the reflection inside the energy shell which is populated _ ergodically _ , when time is running .",
    "no oscillations are detected for the number of principal components ( the data for larger times are not shown ) , this confirms our conclusion about one kind of the reflection from the edges of the energy shell .",
    "it is interesting to note that the number of principal components does not reveal noticeable oscillations on the time scale of the ballistic spread since on this scale the value of @xmath15 is very small .    the difference between these two models can be also seen when comparing the structure of wave packets in the basis representation at some instant times before the saturation ( compare fig.11 with fig.7 ) .",
    "in contrast to fig.7 where many  holes  can be realized in the distribution @xmath100 , for the wbrm model the filling of the available energy range of size @xmath346 occurs ergodically . in both cases",
    "very strong fluctuations are present , which are expected to be gaussian , see discussion in @xcite .",
    "it is important to stress , that in order to reveal this difference , we should avoid the ensemble average which washes out the presence of holes ( if different hamiltonian matrices have different unperturbed spectrum ) .",
    "this fact reflects one of basic peculiarities of the tbri model , namely , the non - ergodic character of the matrices ( the average over the spectrum inside one ( very big ) matrix may give completely different result from that obtained by an ensemble average , see references in the review @xcite ) .    finally , we present the data for the wbrm in the case of the gaussian form of the strength function , see fig.12 . here",
    "we also can see oscillations for the width of packets . as for the number of principal components found from the inverse participation ratio , numerical data manifest the oscillations , as well , with the same period as for the width of packets . in average , the numerical data for @xmath226 and @xmath251",
    "are well described by the simple analytical expressions relating these quantities to the probability @xmath76 to stay in the initial state .",
    "the most interesting result which can be drawn from the numerical data presented in fig.10 and fig.12 , is a clear difference in the time dependence of the entropy @xmath226 .",
    "comparing the data in the insets , one can conclude that linear increase of the entropy occurs for the case when the form of the sf is close to the gaussian , but not for the case of the bw - form .",
    "indeed , it is hard to indicate clear time scale of a linear increase of @xmath226 in fig.10 , in contrast to fig.12 where the linear time dependence is clearly seen ( apart from a very small time scale ) .",
    "this very fact may be of quite generic , since in the tbri model we also see a non - linear character of the entropy increase in the bw - regime .",
