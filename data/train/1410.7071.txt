    "in the last years a great progress was achieved in experimental studies of the isotope shifts in highly charged ions @xcite . in ref .",

    "this experiment provided first tests of the relativistic theory of the nuclear recoil effect with highly charged ions @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite the measurements of the isotope shifts in dielectronic recombination spectra for li - like neodymium ions with @xmath0=142 and @xmath0=150 allowed determination of the nuclear charge radius difference .",
    "the accuracy of this experiment was also sensitive to the relativistic nuclear recoil contribution .",
    "moreover , in refs . @xcite it was demonstrated that the dr experiments at gsi can be extended to radioactive isotopes with a lifetime longer than about 10 s. it is expected that with the new fair facilities @xcite in darmstadt the isotope shift measurements in heavy ions will be improved in accuracy by an order of magnitude . from the theoretical side , to meet this accuracy one needs to evaluate the nuclear size ( field shift ) and nuclear recoil ( mass shift ) contributions , including the relativistic and qed effects .",
    "high - precision calculations of the mass shifts in highly charged li - like ions were performed in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the nuclear recoil contributions obtained within the breit approximation ( non - qed terms ) were combined with the related terms obtained using the relativistic theory beyond the breit approximation ( qed terms ) .",
    "the qed contributions were evaluated to zeroth order of the @xmath1 perturbation theory ( @xmath2 is the nuclear charge number ) , while the breit - approximation calculations were performed using the configuration - interaction dirac - fock - sturm ( ci - dfs ) method @xcite .",
    "an independent calculation of the non - qed mass shifts was presented in ref .",
    "the results of this calculation , that was based on the multiconfiguration dirac - fock ( mcdf ) method , agree with those from ref .",
    "@xcite for low- and middle - z ions .",
    "however , there is some discrepancy in the results for heavy li - like ions .",
    "therefore , it would be very important to calculate the relativistic nuclear recoil contributions using a different approach .",
    "to this end , in the present paper we develop a method which merges the perturbative and ci - dfs calculations .",
    "namely , we calculate the nuclear recoil contributions within the breit approximation to zeroth and first orders in @xmath1 and add the related contributions of second and higher orders in @xmath1 , obtained using the ci - dfs method . for checking purposes , we also perform the perturbative calculations starting with effective local potentials that partly include the electron - electron interaction effects .",
    "although the calculations of the @xmath1 nuclear recoil contributions are restricted to the breit approximation , the developed method can be straightforwardly extended beyond this approximation .",
    "the obtained non - qed results are combined with the corresponding qed contributions of the zeroth order in @xmath1 to get the most accurate theoretical data for the mass shifts in highly charged li - like ions .",
    "in addition , the field shifts are calculated in the framework of the dirac - coulomb - breit hamiltonian .",
    "these calculations , being performed by the ci - dfs method , are compared with the corresponding mcdf calculations of ref .",
    "the qed corrections to the field shifts are also evaluated .",

    "@xcite , the operator @xmath20 was used to evaluate the lowest - order relativistic nuclear recoil corrections to energy levels of he- and li - like ions to zeroth order in @xmath1 ( that corresponds to independent electron approximation ) .",
    "nowadays , this operator is widely used in relativistic calculations of the nuclear recoil effect using the configuration - interaction and multiconfiguration dirac - fock methods @xcite .",
    "it is known , however , that these methods can have a rather poor convergence in calculations of the specific mass shift .",
    "moreover , the ci - df and mcdf methods can not be adopted to account for the qed nuclear recoil contribution , which becomes very significant for heavy ions ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in the present paper",
    "we develop the perturbative approach to calculations of the interelectronic - interaction corrections to the mass shifts .",
    "although the perturbative calculations presented below are restricted to the breit approximation , the developed approach has a potential to be extended to the full relativistic treatment .",
    "to derive the nuclear recoil contributions to the binding energies of li - like ions by perturbation theory , we use the two - time green s function method @xcite with the @xmath21 shell regarded as belonging to a redefined vacuum .",
    "the energy shift of a level @xmath22 ( valence state ) due to all perturbative interactions is given by    @xmath23    where @xmath24 , @xmath25 is the fourier transform of the two - time green function , projected on the unperturbed state @xmath22 , @xmath26 is the unperturbed value of @xmath25 , and @xmath27 is the unperturbed energy of the @xmath22 state , which in the case under consideration is simply equal to the dirac energy of the valence electron : @xmath28 .",

    "to separate the breit - approximation term , we represent the one - electron contribution as follows    @xmath44    the first term in this equation gives the normal mass shift to zeroth order in @xmath1 , while the second term determines the qed part of the one - electron coulomb - recoil contribution .",
    "the expression @xmath45 defines the specific mass shift of zeroth order in @xmath1 .",
