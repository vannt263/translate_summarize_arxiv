    "weak measurement theory @xcite , first introduced by aharonov , albert and vaidman , describes a measurement situation where the measured system is weakly coupled to the measuring device .",
    "such weak measurement has been used to solve basic problems in quantum mechanics @xcite and explain certain paradoxes @xcite .",
    "weak measurement has been realized @xcite , and can be applied to amplifying tiny physical effects , such as spin hall effect @xcite and ultrasensitive beam direction @xcite , and measuring physical quantity , such as the direct measurement of wave function @xcite .",
    "more experimental protocols have been proposed @xcite .",
    "recently weak measurement protocol combined with cavity optomechanics @xcite is given in @xcite , and more applications of weak measurement are reviewed in @xcite .    in the most discussions about weak measurement ,",
    "the initial state of the pointer considered heretofore is gaussian state ( classical ) , such as @xcite , but we are interested in whether squeezed coherent state ( quantum ) pointer can further improve the amplification effect of weak measurement compared to gaussian pointer . in this paper",
    ", we use the same optomechanical model in ref . @xcite but the mirror is initially prepared in the squeezed coherent state , and find that the amplification of the displacement of the mirror depends on the enhanced fluctuations of squeezed coherent state , which is lager than that with gaussian pointer @xcite .",
    "this result is counter - intuitive since the enhanced fluctuations in a quadrature of motion is considered to be of no use . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "this is the first positive example for the use of the enhanced fluctuations of the squeezed coherent state .",
    "the amplification effect is caused by the noncommutativity of quantum mechanics relying on the squeezed coherent state , which can not be explained by the standard weak measurement @xcite ( see appendix a )    .",
    "the structure of our paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we state the main result of this work , including the amplification effect with squeezed vacuum state and squeezed coherent state pointers , and in sec .",
    "iii , we give the conclusion about the work .",
    "in fig . 1 the optomechanical cavity a is embedded in one arm of the march - zehnder interferometer and a stationary fabry - peot cavity b is placed in another arm .",
    "the two beam splitters are both symmetric .",
    "when the photon is detected at the dark port , the dynamical evolution of the photon and the movable mirror is finished , i.e. , the orthogonal postselection is performed .",
    "the hamiltonian of optomechanical system is expressed as : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is plank s constant .",
    "@xmath2 and @xmath3 ( or @xmath4 ) are frequency and annihilation operator of the optical cavity a ( or b ) , respectively .",
    "@xmath5 is annihilation operator of mechanical system with angular frequency @xmath6 and the optomechanical coupling strength @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the length of the cavity a ( or b ) .",
    "@xmath9 is the zero - point fluctuation and @xmath10 is the mass of mechanical system .",

    "( [ a ] ) corresponding to @xmath12 in eq .",
    "( [ sss ] ) in the standard scenario of weak measurement ( see appendix a ) and @xmath13 corresponds to @xmath14 .",
    "if the initial state of the mirror can be prepared at the squeezing coherent state @xmath15 , where @xmath16 with squeezing parameters @xmath17 and one photon interacts with the mirror , according to the results of the hamiltonian in @xcite , the state of the mirror will become @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the kerr phase of one photon with @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 $ ] is a displacement operator with @xmath23 .",
    "the position displacement of the mirror caused by one photon is @xmath24 with @xmath25 being the position operator .",
    "it can be shown that the displacement can not be bigger than @xmath26 for any time @xmath27 . since @xmath28 can not be bigger than @xmath29 in weak coupling condition @xcite , then the position displacement of the mirror caused by one photon",
    "can not be bigger than the zero - point fluctuation @xmath30 . in the literature",
    "@xcite we know that if the displacement of the mirror can be detected experimentally it should be not smaller than @xmath30 .",
    "therefore , the displacement of the mirror caused by one photon can not be detected . in the following",
    "we will show how the weak measurement can amplify the mirror s displacement .",
    "suppose that one photon is input into the interferometer , the state of the photon after the first beam splitter becomes @xmath31 and after interacting weakly with the mirror prepared at the squeezing vacuum state @xmath32 , the state of the total system is @xmath33 after the second beam splitter and detecting at dark port , that is , postselecting for an single - photon state @xmath34 which satisfies this case of the orthogonal postselection , i.e. , @xmath35 .",
    "then the final state of the mirror becomes @xmath36    the average displacement of pointer variable @xmath25 of the mirror is @xmath37 here we use the position operator @xmath38 .",

    "the average displacement @xmath42 of the mirror is shown in fig .",
    "2 as a function of @xmath43 with @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 . we can see that there are two amplification zones .",
    "one is that there exist amplification effects around time @xmath47 @xmath48 .",
    "the other amplifications occur around the vibration periods of the mirror @xmath49 @xmath50 .",
    "in particular , the maximal positive and negative amplifications around time @xmath51 @xmath50 are more prominent and they can also reach the maximal value @xcite @xmath52 , i.e. , the level of the squeezing vacuum - state fluctuation @xmath53 when @xmath45 and @xmath54 ( @xmath30 the level of the vacuum - state fluctuation ) . note that the maximal displacement of the mirror caused by one photon in cavity a ( see fig .",

    "therefore , the mirror state achieving the positive amplification is @xmath73 and the state achieving the negative amplification is @xmath74 .",
    "it is obvious that the key to understand the amplification is the superposition of the squeezing vacuum state and the squeezing one - phonon state of the mirror , which is due to the kerr phase .",
    "it is well - known that the squeezed state have many application in the diverse fields of quantum physics since it have less fluctuations in one quadrature component at the expense of increased fluctuations in another quadrature component , which is a key characteristic of the squeezed state on the application side . on the contrary ,",
    "the application of its quadrature component with increased fluctuations is seldom mentioned . here",
    "we show that the amplification achieved here is associated with the quadrature component with increased fluctuations in the squeezed state , i.e. , the level of the squeezing vacuum - state fluctuation @xmath75 .",
    "we can see that the amplification will become bigger if the level of the increased fluctuations of squeezed coherent state in another quadrature direction become larger and it becomes to be measured more easily .",
    "it will be shown that the maximal amplification due to the kerr phase obtained here is bigger than the level of vacuum - state fluctuation @xmath76 which ca nt be achieved if the mirror is initially prepared in the ground state @xcite or the coherent state @xcite . and",
    "in this case of the orthogonal postselection , the amplifications around time @xmath77 @xmath48 or @xmath49 @xmath50 are not explained by the weak measurement @xcite ( see appendix a ) which is applicable to the case that is an near - orthogonal postselection .",

    "achieving squeezed states in mechanical oscillators has not been realized experimentally but proposed by several schemes , such as resolved sideband cooling using squeezed @xcite or modulated input light @xcite .",
    "it is difficult to observe the amplification effect using the squeezed vacuum state pointer because of the very small post - selected probability of success and the very limited time zones for the appearance of the maximal displaced state .",
    "nevertheless , the amplification using the squeezed coherent state pointer is not the case . the probability density of a photon released from an optomechanical cavity after time @xmath43 is @xmath121 , where @xmath122 is the decay rate of the cavity .",
