    "parent compounds of iron - based superconductors undergo a tetragonal - to - orthorhombic structural transition upon cooling accompanied by an antiferromagnetic ( afm ) order and show anomalous metallic behavior .",
    "@xcite in this ordered phase , spins align antiferromagnetically along the @xmath2 axis and ferromagnetically along the @xmath3 axis ,  @xcite so the electronic state is essentially anisotropic .",
    "recent in - plane resistivity measurements performed on detwinned crystals of ba(fe@xmath4co@xmath5)@xmath0as@xmath0 , cafe@xmath0as@xmath0 , and srfe@xmath0as@xmath0  @xcite revealed an anomalous anisotropic electronic properties that the resistivity along the afm spin direction with longer lattice constant ( @xmath2 axis ) is smaller than the resistivity along the ferromagnetic ( fm ) spin direction with shorter lattice constant ( @xmath3 axis ) and this in - plane resistivity anisotropy can be seen in the tetragonal phase well above the phase transition temperature @xmath1 , which has been discussed in terms of nematicity .",
    "@xcite in relation to the nematicity , the orbital polarization above @xmath1 is observed by angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) .",
    "@xcite however , the in - plane resistivity above @xmath1 is negligibly small in the cases of cafe@xmath0as@xmath0 and srfe@xmath0as@xmath0 which show a strongly first - order phase transition ,  @xcite indicating that the in - plane resistivity anisotropy above @xmath1 or nematicity might not be intrinsic but could be induced by the external pressure .",
    "+ the in - plane resistivity anisotropy of undoped bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 is relatively small compared with underdoped ba(fe@xmath4co@xmath5)@xmath0as@xmath0 ,  @xcite despite the lattice orthorhombicity diminishes monotonically with increasing co concentration .",
    "@xcite the small anisotropy of undoped bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 has been discussed from magnetotransport measurements in terms of a dominant role of isotropic and high - mobility dirac pockets with the dirac point near the fermi energy @xmath6 ,  @xcite which were first observed by arpes ( the dirac point is located at 1  @xmath7  5  mev from @xmath6 ) .",
    "@xcite however , several fermi surface ( fs ) pockets other than dirac pockets also exist in the ordered state as evidenced by arpes  @xcite and quantum oscillation .",
    "@xcite in such a multiple - band system , is it really possible that such tiny dirac pockets with very small density dominate the charge transport ?",
    "additionally , recent optical measurement performed on detwinned bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 crystal  @xcite revealed that almost isotropic drude component existing along both @xmath2 and @xmath3 axis dominates the dc conductivity .",
    "the estimated drude weight is of the order of 10@xmath8  @xmath9 , which seems too large to be formed only by tiny dirac pockets .",
    "it seems that one needs another explanation for the small in - plane resistivity anisotropy of undoped bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 . +",
    "it is also reported that annealing remarkably improves transport properties in the ordered phase of bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 ,  @xcite which indicates that the as - grown crystals contain appreciable amount of defects / impurities , and hence the observation of the intrinsic charge transport in this system might be inhibited .",
    "therefore , it is required to investigate the intrinsic transport properties of this compound using annealed crystals .",
    "+ in this paper , we present the transport measurements on bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 single crystals with much improved quality .",
    "we show that the in - plane resistivity anisotoropy both above and below @xmath1 is diminished and the in - plane resistivity becomes almost isotropic , which indicates that the nematicity may not be intrinsic .",
    "we also provide clear evidence from the magnetotransport measurements that multiple carriers contribute to the charge transport in the ordered phase of bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 . only tiny dirac pockets do not play a dominant role as previously reported , but contribution to the conductivity from at least three types of carriers mask the underlying anisotropic electronic states .",
    "single crystals of bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 were grown by the self - flux method as described elsewhere.@xcite the crystals were cut in a rectangular shape along the tetragonal [ 110 ] directions which become @xmath2 or @xmath3 axes in the orthorhombic phase .",
    "typical crystal dimensions were 1.5  @xmath10  1.5  @xmath10  0.5  mm@xmath11 with the shortest edge along the @xmath12 axis .",
    "part of the crystals were sealed into an evacuated quartz tube together with ba or baas powders and annealed for several days .",
    "a standard four - terminal method was used for the in - plane resistivity measurements on twinned crystals .",
    "the magnetoresistance ( mr ) and hall resistivity @xmath13 were measured with the electrical current along the @xmath14 plane and the magnetic field along @xmath12 axis . for detwinning ,",
    "the bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 crystals were set into an uniaxial pressure cell and detwinned by applying compressive pressure along the tetragonal [ 110 ] direction .",
    "@xcite the resistivity along the @xmath2 and @xmath3 axis were measured simultaneously using montgomery method  @xcite without releasing pressure .",
    "the measurements in the magnetic fields up to 7  t were performed in a quantum design physical property measurement system ( ppms ) .",
    "mr and @xmath13 in the magnetic fields up to 14  t were measured at the high magnetic field laboratory , kyokugen , osaka university .",
    "figure [ fig1](a ) shows temperature ( @xmath15 ) dependence of the in - plane resistivity @xmath16(@xmath15 ) measured on twinned bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 crystals annealed under various conditions .",
    "@xmath16(@xmath15 ) of the as - grown crystal ( black dots ) shows typical temperature dependence so far reported for this compound .",
    "@xmath16(@xmath15 ) drops at @xmath1 @xmath17 136  k corresponding to the magnetostructural transition and shows residual resistivity of typically 0.1  m@xmath18 cm .",
    "the residual resistivity ratio ( @xmath19 ) defined as @xmath16(300k)/@xmath16(5k ) is about 3 .",
    "because the ordered state below @xmath1 has orthorhombic crystal structure , the twinned crystal has domains with different orientations hence the scattering at domain boundaries could be a source of residual resistivity .",
    "however , this is unlikely as a main source of scattering in the present case since @xmath20(@xmath15 ) of detwinned bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 still shows large residual resistivity ( see dashed curves in fig . [ fig2](a ) ) .",
    "+ the annealing remarkably reduced the residual resistivity in the ordered phase of bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 as reported in ref .  @xcite . in general",
    ", the annealing process would remove crystal defects and lattice dislocations which are possible scattering sources and can cause large residual resistivity .",
    "rotundu  @xmath21 adopted low - pressure ar gas annealing and obtained crystals with @xmath19 @xmath17  36 after 30-day annealing at 700  @xmath22c .",
    "@xcite in order to shorten the annealing time , we annealed crystals in a evacuated quartz tube together with ba or baas powders since we assumed that the main sources of scattering are defects and/or dislocations of ba and/or as sites .",
    "however , annealing with ba is found to not much improve the crystal quality , since ba reacts with crystals above 600  @xmath22c and @xmath19 gets worse .",
    "we found that @xmath19 can be improved more quickly by annealing with baas than ar gas annealing .",
    "after annealing for 48 hours at 800  @xmath22c , we obtained crystal with @xmath19 @xmath17  34 .",
    "however , it is still unclear why @xmath19 of this compound is so sensitive to the annealing process .",
    "+ temperature dependence of @xmath16(@xmath15 ) for the annealed crystal seems almost unchanged above @xmath1 after annealing , @xmath23 the annealing process scarcely affects the transport properties in the pm phase . on the other hand , as is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) , @xmath1 increases from 136  k to 142  k and the phase transition becomes sharper probably because crystal defects are removed and it helps to stabilize the orthorhombic lattice and magnetic ordering .",
    "remarkably , @xmath16(@xmath15 ) drops much steeper below @xmath1 and goes down to @xmath17 10  @xmath24 cm at @xmath15 = 5  k , one order of magnitude smaller than the value of as - grown crystal .",
    "if the carrier density is unchanged after annealing as reported ,  @xcite this indicates that carrier mobility is greatly enhanced by annealing .",
    "the in - plane resistivities of detwinned bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 crystal are shown in fig . [ fig2](a ) .",
    "note that effects of annealing on the in - plane resistivity anisotropy are also discussed by nakajima ,  @xmath25 in ref .",
    "the dashed line corresponds to resistivity components for the as - grown crystal .",
    "the blue and red colors correspond to resistivity along @xmath2 axis ( @xmath26 ) and @xmath3 axis ( @xmath27 ) , respectively . around room temperatures",
    "there is no appreciable difference between @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "as temperature is lowered , @xmath26 continues to decrease , while @xmath27 shows an upturn toward @xmath1 .",
    "the in - plane resistivity anisotropy can be seen well above @xmath1 , from about 80  k above , and @xmath26 is always smaller than @xmath27 .",
    "these results reproduce the reported ones  @xcite and confirm that the crystal is successfully detwinned by our technique .",
    "the in - plane resistivity anisotropy defined as @xmath27/@xmath26 - 1 is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) .",
    "the anisotropy shows a maximum value @xmath17  0.33 just below @xmath1 , but it is robust even at the lowest temperature ( @xmath17  0.2 at @xmath15 = 5  k ) .",
    "+ the solid lines in fig . [ fig2](a ) show the resistivity components of the annealed crystal .",
    "the temperature dependence of @xmath26 and @xmath27 seems qualitatively similar to that of the as - grown crystal .",
    "however , the anisotropy becomes appreciable only about 40  k above @xmath1 , that is , the phase transition becomes more first - order like as seen in srfe@xmath0as@xmath0 and cafe@xmath0as@xmath0 .",
    "@xcite this suggests that the magnetostructural transition might essentially be of the first order even in the purest sample of bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 .",
    "therefore , the in - plane resistivity anisotropy above @xmath1 seems not originated from nematic phase but induced by the external pressure and/or remaining crystal defects / disorder .",
    "remarkably , the anisotropy is much reduces as compared with that for as - grown crystal and diminishes as temperature is decreased below @xmath1 and the in - plane resistivity becomes nearly isotropic at temperatures well below @xmath1 ( @xmath27/@xmath26 - 1 @xmath17  0.04 at 5  k ) .",
    "in fact , the isotropic charge transport at low temperatures is consistent with the results of other experiments .",
    "arpes  @xcite and quantum oscillation  @xcite revealed ellipsoidal fs pockets which , when summed over the momentum space , would result in isotropic conductivity .",
    "also , the optical conductivity spectra of detwinned bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 for light polarization along @xmath2 and @xmath3 axis ( measured crystals were annealed under the same condition )  @xcite are dominated by an isotropic drude component with extremely high peak value ( of the order of 10@xmath28  @xmath29@xmath30 at @xmath15 = 5  k ) and narrow width , consistent with the dc resistivity .",
    "the anisotropy in optical conductivity shows up in finite frequency region , which arises from anisotropic gap feature below @xmath1 .",
    "the question is , whether or not this drude term originates from the tiny dirac pockets .",
    "we will answer this after we show the results of magnetotransport measurements .",
    "figures [ fig3](a)-(d ) show the magnetic field ( @xmath31 ) dependence of the magnetoresistance ( mr ) for transverse magnetic field ( @xmath32 , @xmath33 ) and its derivative with respect to magnetic field for as - grown ( a , b ) and annealed ( c , d ) crystals , respectively .",
    "the magnitude of mr is defined as @xmath34(@xmath31)/@xmath16(@xmath31=0)=[@xmath16(@xmath31)-@xmath16(@xmath31=0)]/@xmath16(@xmath31=0 ) . in both cases , mr is smaller than 0.03@xmath35 in the pm phase and rapidly increases below @xmath1 .",
    "mr of as - grown crystal is 14  @xmath35 at @xmath31 = 7  t and @xmath15 = 5  k ( fig . [ fig3](a ) ) and shows almost @xmath31-linear dependence above 1 t , which is more clearly seen in the @xmath31 dependence of the derivative of mr ( dmr / d@xmath31 ) ( fig . [ fig3](b ) ) .",
    "@xmath31-linear mr is anomolous , since in the framework of simple two carrier model , mr at low fields can be written in the form of ( @xmath36)@xmath37 where @xmath38 is magnetoresistance mobility , and mr saturates at high fields where @xmath36 or @xmath39 @xmath40 1 .",
    "huynh @xmath21 ascribed this non - saturating linear mr to a quantum transport of dirac cone states  @xcite based on a model proposed by abrikosov .",
    "@xcite however , recent study of mr for as - grown bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 under higher magnetic field up to 50  t showed nonlinear but quadratic @xmath31 dependence of mr at high fields  @xcite revealing the complicated @xmath31 dependence of mr .",
    "+ in the case of the annealed crystal , mr reaches @xmath17  280  @xmath35 at @xmath31 = 7  t and @xmath15 = 5  k ( fig . [ fig3](c ) ) , which is by an order larger than that of as - grown crystal .",
    "furthermore , in contrast to the case of as - grown crystal , mr shows quadratic @xmath31 dependence up to 7  t. considering that the magnitude of mr is a measure of carrier mobility , the mobility of carriers should be greatly enhanced by the annealing , which is consistent with the decrease of residual resistivity .",
    "note that dmr / d@xmath31 has a kink - like structure at low field around 0.5  t , that is , mr of annealed crystal also has some @xmath31-linear component similar to the case of as - grown crystal ( fig . [",
    "fig3](d ) ) , suggestive of a contribution from dirac pockets .",
    "however , observed large and quadratic @xmath31-dependent mr gives evidence that other fs pockets have appreciable contribution to the charge transport in the ordered phase of bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 .",
    "figure [ fig4](a ) shows the magnetic field dependence of the hall resistivity @xmath13 ( @xmath32 , @xmath33 ) for as - grown crystal taken at several temperatures .",
    "@xmath13(@xmath31 ) of as - grown crystal shows basically @xmath31-linear dependence below @xmath1 and a deviation from the @xmath31-linearity becomes apparent at @xmath15 well below @xmath1 .",
    "a previous report showed this sub - linear @xmath31 dependence of hall resistivity persists to 50  t ,  @xcite which was ascribed to the @xmath31 dependence of carrier density .",
    "+ the @xmath31 dependence of @xmath13(@xmath31 ) for annealed crystal is shown in fig . [ fig4](b ) . in stark contrast to",
    "the as - grown crystal , @xmath13(@xmath31 ) below @xmath1 soon deviates from @xmath31-linear dependence and exhibits nonmonotonic @xmath31 dependence . especially at @xmath15",
    "= 5  k , @xmath13(@xmath31 ) changes its sign to positive above @xmath31 @xmath17 4  t. it is natural to attribute this @xmath31 dependence of @xmath13(@xmath31 ) to the multiple - carrier effect .",
    "intuitively , the negative sign of hall coefficient at low field should be related to electrons with higher mobility and the positive sign at high field indicates the prevalence of hole carriers with relatively lower mobility .",
    "+ obviously , the magnitude of residual resistivity , the @xmath31 dependence of mr , and the nonmonotonic-@xmath31 dependence of @xmath13 are all correlated .",
    "they orginate from multiple - carrier contribution which becomes clear as the sample quality is improved or as the carrier mobilities become higher .",
    "below , in order to make more quantitative analysis on these results , we apply a multiple - carrier model to @xmath13(@xmath31 ) .",
    "first , we used a simple two - carrier model fitting  @xcite assuming one electron - type and one hole - type carriers . as is shown in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig5](a ) , the two - carrier model fairly well fits @xmath13(@xmath31 ) .",
    "however , the fitting parameter set shown in table [ tab1 ] seems not reasonable , since ( i ) the density of holes is by two orders larger than that of electrons , inconsistent with arpes  @xcite and quantum oscillation  @xcite , ( ii ) a calculated mr using the obtained parameter set is @xmath17 15  @xmath35 at 14  t , much smaller than the experimental data ( @xmath17 800  @xmath35 at @xmath31 = 14  t , see fig . [ fig6](b ) ) , and ( iii ) the calculated mr shows saturating behavior which can be seen as decrease of dmr / d@xmath31 above 5  t ( fig . [ fig5](c ) ) .",
    "any other parameter sets do not lead to better fitting than that shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5](a ) ( especially , if one put the constraint @xmath41  @xmath17  @xmath42 , fitting of @xmath13(@xmath31 ) becomes worse ) .",
    "thus , the two - carrier model is insufficient to describe the @xmath31 dependence of @xmath13(@xmath31 ) and mr .",
    "+ in order to explain the experimental data , we add a third carrier instead of considering @xmath31-dependent carrier density and/or dirac cone states , namely , we apply three - carrier model fitting .",
    "@xcite ( see appendix a ) one needs a number of parameters ( carrier type , electron or hole , carrier density and mobility for each carrier and their anisotropy ) for three - carrier model fitting , but there are several constraints ; ( i ) anisotropy would be negligible since the in - plane charge transport is almost isotropic , ( ii ) total carrier density should be of order of 10@xmath8  @xmath9 as estimated from the drude weight in the optical spectrum ,  @xcite ( iii ) the densities of electrons and holes should be equal as is also confirmed by the angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes )  @xcite and quantum oscillation data  @xcite , and ( iv ) the obtained parameter sets should be consistent with the magnitude of resistivity and mr .",

    "<S> we investigated the transport properties of bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 single crystals before and after annealing with baas powder . </S>",
    "<S> the annealing remarkably improves transport properties , in particular the magnitude of residual resistivity which decreases by a factor of more than 10 . from the resistivity measurement on detwinned crystals we found that the anisotropy of the in - plane resistivity is remarkably diminished after annealing , indicative of dominant contributions to the charge transport from the carriers with isotropic and high mobility below magnetostructural transition temperature @xmath1 and the absence of nematic state above @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we found that the hall resistivity shows strong non - linearity against magnetic field and the magnetoresistance becomes very large at low temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> these results give evidence for the manifestation of multiple carriers with distinct characters in the ordered phase below @xmath1 . by analyzing the magnetic field dependences </S>",
    "<S> , we found that at least three carriers equally contribute to the charge transport in the ordered phase , which is in good agreement with the results of recent quantum oscillation measurements . </S>"
