    "a radial variation of the mass - to - luminosity ratio in a galaxy ( hereafter @xmath0 ) is a clue to investigate the distributions of visible and dark ( invisible ) masses ( e.g. , kent 1986 , 1987 ; persic & salucci 1988 , 1990 ; salucci & frenk 1989 ; forbes 1992 ; persic et al .",
    "1996 ; hraudeau & simien 1997 ; rubin et al .",
    "however , most of the current studies have been devoted to investigate the dark halo , which is supposed to be closely related to galaxy formation and the stability of disks ( e.g. , ostriker & peebles 1973 ; athanassoula et al .",
    "1987 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "there have been few systematic investigations of dark matter within a bulge and an inner disk , for which , however , high - resolution and high - quality rotation curves are required as well as corresponding luminosity profiles .",
    "rotation curves ( rcs ) in disk and outer regions have been derived from position - velocity diagrams obtained by optical and hi - line spectroscopy ( rubin et al .",
    "1980 , 1982 , 1985 ; bosma 1981a ; mathewson et al . 1992 ; persic & salucci 1995 ; mathewson & ford 1996 ; clemens 1995 ; sofue 1996 , 1997 ; honma & sofue 1997 ) .",
    "recently , we have obtained inner - most rcs by analyzing high - resolution co , h@xmath7 , and [ nii]-line spectroscopic data ( sofue 1996 , 1997 ; sofue et al .",
    "1997 , 1998 , 1999 ) .",
    "1 shows thus obtained rcs of sb and sc galaxies ( e.g. , sofue 1999 ) . all the sb galaxies in our sample show very steep rises of rotation velocity in the central 100 @xmath3 500 pc region . the sc galaxies also show similar nuclear rises , except for a few small - mass galaxies , which show rigid - body growth in the rcs .",
    "1 includes some barred galaxies , which also show similar rotation properties to normal galaxies .",
    "recent ccd observations of the h@xmath7-line have also revealed the nuclear rises of rotation velocity for many galaxies ( rubin et al .",
    "1997 ; sofue et al .",
    "1997 , 1998 , 1999 ; bertola et al .",
    "1998 ) , in agreement with the co results .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the rotation velocities in many galaxies do not appear to decline to zero at the nuclei , indicating that the mass density increases steeply toward the center ( bertola et al .",
    "1998 ; sofue et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "1    the fact that almost all the galaxies show steep nuclear rises would imply that the high velocities are not due to the non - circular motions in bars . when observing a bar ,",
    "the probability of looking it at a side - on view is fairly higher than that of an end - on view .",
    "if the influence of the non - circular motion is significant , the rc will indicate lower and more gradually rising velocity than the circular velocity , rather close to the pattern speed of the bar .",
    "therefore , we may assume that the rcs trace the circular motions in the first approximation .",
    "if there exist bars , we may still underestimate the circular velocity , which would result in an underestimated mass density .",
    "radial profiles of the surface - mass density ( smd ) and the surface luminosity can be used to calculate the @xmath0 directly . as for smd profiles , bosma ( 1981b ) used two methods , each described by nordsieck ( 1973 ) and shu et al .",
    "( 1971 ) , to derive them directly from rcs .",
    "he compared these methods and found the good agreement between the two smd profiles .",
    "however , most of the current investigations have been done on the assumption that the visible part of a galaxy consists of a given set of a bulge and a disk , each assumed to have a constant @xmath0 .",
    "although this idea is useful to quantify the averaged characteristics in each component , it would be necessary to confirm whether the assumption of the constant @xmath0 is reliable .",
    "kent ( 1986 ) has extensively used the `` maximum - disk method '' to fit rcs calculated on this assumption to observed rcs : he has derived averaged @xmath0s in the individual components . however , this method is based on the assumption that there is no dark matter in the bulge and disk .",
    "moreover , results of such a fitting process much depend on bumps and wiggles in the luminosity profiles ( bosma 1998 ) as well as on the fitting range .",
    "forbes ( 1992 ) have derived the radial variation of the ratio of the total mass to total luminosity involved within a radius , @xmath8 , which can be called an integrated @xmath0. in this paper , we will derive both the smd and the surface luminosity as differential quantities at a given radius , and compare them directly in order to discuss the detailed radial distribution of the @xmath0 .    in section 2",
    ", we derive the smd profiles .",
    "we obtain the luminosity profiles in section 3 , describe the obtained @xmath0 profiles in section 4 , and discuss the results in section 5 .",
    "we assume that the true mass distribution in a real disk galaxy will be between two extreme cases ; spherical and axisymmetric flat - disk distributions",
    ". we can calculate the smd , @xmath9 , directly from a rc for these extreme cases .",
    "the mass @xmath10 inside the radius @xmath8 is given by @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the rotation velocity at @xmath8 .",
    "then the smd @xmath13 at @xmath14 is calculated by , @xmath15 here , @xmath14 , @xmath8 and @xmath16 are related by @xmath17 , and the volume mass density @xmath18 is given by @xmath19    for a given rc , @xmath12 , eq .",
    "( 3 ) can be calculated numerically .",
    "note , nevertheless , an underestimation of eq .",
    "( 3 ) becomes significant when @xmath20 , the outermost measured radius of the rc , because eq.(3 ) can be integrated only up to the @xmath21 , instead of @xmath22 .",
    "this edge effect is negligible elsewhere because of the factor @xmath23 , by which the contribution at @xmath8 far from @xmath14 decreased rapidly . in fig .",
    "2 we show the several results of the integration in eq . ( 3 ) for the miyamoto - nagai potential ( miyamoto & nagai 1975 ) , by taking several different values of @xmath21 . here , the ` true ' value for this potential is given by @xmath24 .",
    "the figure demonstrates that the edge effect is almost negligible except at radii @xmath25 , where the smd is underestimated .",
    "2      the smd for a thin flat - disk , @xmath24 , is derived by solving the poisson s equation : @xmath26,\\ ] ] where @xmath27 is the complete elliptic integral and becomes very large when @xmath28 ( binney & tremaine 1987 ) .",
    "when we calculate the @xmath24 , the following three points must be taken into account .",
    "( _ a _ ) first , eq . ( 5 ) is subject to the boundary condition , @xmath29 .",
    "the assumption @xmath30 may not be applied , if there is a black hole ( bh ) at the galactic center . however , a central bh with mass of several to hundreds million @xmath31 dominates the rc only within a few pc , and it does not influence the smd except at the center . on the other hand ,",
    "the spatial resolution in our data is of the order of 100 pc , thus the rcs could hardly trace the central bh .",
    "so , for our purposes we can safely ignore its existence .",
    "( _ b _ ) second , when calculating the first term on the right hand side of eq .",
    "( 5 ) , we have only a few data points in the central region within a radius comparable to the spatial resolution , where the reliability of the calculated @xmath12 is lower than the outer region .",
    "( _ c _ ) third , the upper limit of the integration of the second term is @xmath21 instead of infinity . since the rcs are nearly flat or declining outward from @xmath32 , the second term becomes negative",
    "hence , we overestimate @xmath24 at @xmath33 , and , as calculated here , the smd near the outer edges will give an upper limit to the true value . for such galaxies as ngc 1068 and ngc 4569 ,",
    "whose rotation velocities appear to increase even outwards of @xmath32 , the error would be still larger .",
    "we , here , examine how the results for the spherical and flat - disk assumptions differ from each other as well as from the ` true ' smd by adopting the miyamoto - nagai ( mn ) potential ( miyamoto & nagai 1975 ) , which realistically comprises four components denoting a compact nucleus , a bulge , a disk , and a dark halo .",
    "given a set of parameters for the mn potential suitable for our galaxy , we can calculate the ` true ' smd as well as the rc . using this rc",
    ", we derive the smd both for a spherical and flat - disk assumptions using the methods as in the previous sections .",
    "the mn potential is given by @xmath34}^{-0.5}$ ] and @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 in the units of @xmath39 .    in fig .",
    "3 we show the calculated true smd , and the smds for a spherical and a flat - disk assumptions calculated from the rc .",
    "we used the rc only up to @xmath40 kpc .",
    "3 shows that the spherical case well reproduces the true smd for the inner region .",
    "this is not surprising , because a spherical component is dominant within the bulge . on the other hand",
    ", the flat - disk case mimics the true one in the disk region , which is also reasonable . near the outer edge",
    ", the flat - disk case also appears to be a better tracer of the true smd .",
    "we stress that the results from the two extreme assumptions , spherical and flat - disk , differ at most by a factor of two , and do not differ by more than a factor of 1.5 from the true smd .",
    "we may thus safely assume that the true smd is in between the two extreme cases : it is better represented by a spherical case for the inner region , while a flat - disk case is better for the disk and outer part .",
    "3      we use the rcs in sofue ( 1997 ) to derive the smd profiles .",
    "we select 18 sa and sab spiral galaxies , for which the spatial resolution ( fwhm ) is less than 650 pc .",
    "4 shows the calculated @xmath13 and @xmath24 with error - bars , respectively . among the sample ,",
    "ngc 4527 has the highest signal - to - noise ratio , which have been obtained from co- , hi- and -line data . the parameters of the sample are listed in table 1 .",
    "table1    fig .",
    "4    from fig .",
    "4 the typical difference of smd values between the two assumptions ( sphere and flat - disk ) is estimated to be @xmath60.05 to 0.1 in a logarithmic scale .",
    "the error due to the error in rotation velocities is about @xmath60.05 .",
    "hence , the effective error of smd calculation is estimated to be @xmath60.1 to 0.15 .    in figs .",
    "5 and 6 the smd profiles of sb and sc galaxies are shown together .",
    "although some sc galaxies distinctly have smaller smd values than the average , the difference in smd between the two galaxy types is fairly small .",
    "sb and sc galaxies show similar surface - mass distributions . in the disk region at radii 3 to 10 kpc the smd decreases exponentially outward by about 0.3 times/5kpc . in the bulge region ( @xmath4 2 kpc ) of some galaxies , the smd shows a power - law decrease , much steeper than an exponential decrease .",
    "this may indicate that the surface - mass concentration in the central region is higher than the luminosity concentration .",
    "the central activities appear to be not directly correlated with the mass distribution .",
    "note that the present sample includes galaxies showing seyfert ( ngc 1068 , ngc 4569 ) , liner ( ngc 3521 , ngc 4569 ) , jets ( ngc 3079 ) , and black holes ( the milky way ) .",
    "5a , b    fig .",
    "luminosity profiles in bulge regions are affected by the interstellar extinction .",
    "the extinction is higher nearer the center ; it is higher for a larger inclination angle .",
    "it is also higher in shorter wave ranges .",
    "in fact , the color - gradient ( @xmath41 or @xmath42 ) between the bulge and disk for galaxies with larger inclinations ( @xmath43 ) is greater than that for lower - inclination galaxies ( hraudeau et al .",
    "1996 ) . on the other hand",
    ", galaxies with @xmath44 in de jong & van der kruit ( 1994 ) do not show significant differences in the color gradient .    in the present analysis",
    ", we have selected the galaxies whose inclinations are less than @xmath45 if they are observed in nir - bands and @xmath46-band , and the galaxies with inclinations less than @xmath47 if their data are in optical . in the latter case their mean surface luminosities",
    "may be weakened by 1 mag @xmath48 at most , depending on the inclination .",
    "we have , thus , selected 11 galaxies out of the 19 rc - selected galaxies .",
    "table 1 lists the parameters for individual galaxies and their references .",
    "since the data have been reduced in different ways by different authors , we have checked if their data are suitable for the present analysis of @xmath0 .",
    "we briefly describe the data , particularly how the surface - luminosity profiles , @xmath49 , have been obtained .",
    "\\(a ) regan & vogel ( 1994 ) have de - projected ngc 598 , and calculated @xmath49 mag @xmath48 by averaging azimuthally in rings of width @xmath50 .",
    "the deviation from axi - symmetry is at most about 0.1 mag @xmath48 including the observational error , which is much smaller than the error of the smd .",
    "the effects by spiral arms are small .",
    "\\(b ) kodaira et al .",
    "( 1990 ) and ( d ) de jong & van der kruit ( 1994 ) measured @xmath49 along the major axes .",
    "the errors of @xmath49 are as small as @xmath51 mag @xmath48 .",
    "\\(c ) frei et al .",
    "( 1996 ) published imaging data of spiral galaxies in fits format .",
    "we have used them to derive @xmath49 at the same position angles at which the rcs have been measured .",
    "the errors of @xmath49 are found to be smaller than that of smd .",
    "\\(e ) boselli et al .",
    "( 1997 ) reduced their data in the same way as regan & vogel ( 1994 ) to derive luminosity profiles . for ngc 4569",
    "they assumed an inclination of 67@xmath52 and a position angle of 23@xmath52 , which are almost the same as those we adopt here .",
    "the errors of @xmath49 are less than 0.1 mag @xmath48 between @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "\\(f ) mllenhoff et al .",
    "( 1995 ) calculated @xmath49 of ngc 4736 along the semi - major axis for different position angles and ellipticities . because of the central weak bar , @xmath49 may be about 0.5 mag @xmath48 brighter at @xmath55 than that at position angle of @xmath56 as adopted for the rc .",
    "we may , thus , consider that the errors in the luminosity profiles caused by the different ways is negligible compared to that due to the observations , except for ngc 4736 .",
    "we note , however , that observations in the v - band ( ngc 4303 , ngc 5055 , ngc 6946 ) may be affected by spiral arms , and the errors will amount to about @xmath60.5 mag @xmath48 ( @xmath570.2 in the unit of log(@xmath58 @xmath59 ) .",
    "to obtain @xmath0 profiles , we first converted the unit of @xmath49 from mag @xmath48 into @xmath58 @xmath60 , then divided the smd by @xmath61(@xmath58 @xmath60)@xmath62cos@xmath63 corrected for the inclination .",
    "we adopt the following solar luminosities in the individual bands : @xmath64 mag , @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "we note , however , that we can not compare the absolute values of @xmath0 profiles directly among the galaxies , because we use different filters for different galaxies .",
    "hence , we here focus on relative variations of @xmath0 with radius in each individual galaxy rather than compare the absolute @xmath0 values among different objects . fig .",
    "4 shows the thus obtained @xmath0 profiles for the 11 galaxies , and fig .",
    "7 shows the same but for the inner 4 kpc region . as the errors of smd are much larger than those of @xmath49 for all the galaxies , only the errors in smd are indicated .",
    "7      we discuss the results for the individual galaxies :    * ngc 598 : * this is a small - mass galaxy which has a mildly rising rc to reach only about 100 km s@xmath68 in the disk region .",
    "the @xmath0 increases slowly by 1.7 times from @xmath69 1 to 3 kpc . in the bulge region",
    "it appears to decrease inward rapidly , with large error - bars",
    ". it also appears to increase inward within 150 pc but it is not conclusive , because the spatial resolution is 210 pc .",
    "the @xmath0 in the disk region increases slowly at 4.6 times from @xmath69 2 to 6 kpc . in the bulge region",
    "it decreases more rapidly ( 0.28 times from @xmath69 2 kpc to 800 pc ) than in the disk , but within @xmath69 800 pc turns to be nearly flat or somewhat increasing .",
    "this is a seyfert type - ii galaxy , so the luminosity profile in v - band may be not exact in the central region .",
    "both the smd profile and @xmath49 have a remarkable bump at @xmath70 2 kpc .",
    "since the shape of the rc is also peculiar , we may not neglect the effect of non - axisymmetric component such as due to a spiral arm .",
    "interestingly , however , there appears no corresponding bump in the @xmath0 .",
    "the @xmath0 in the disk region increases slowly by 5.5 times from @xmath69 4 to 9 kpc .",
    "this sc galaxy has a compact bulge and we can not evaluate the @xmath0 of the inner bulge for the insufficient spatial resolution .    because of some irregularities caused by spiral arms , the @xmath0 in the disk region behaves irregularly , although it increases outward on the average . in the compact bulge region",
    "the @xmath0 decreases inward steeply from @xmath69 2 kpc to 500 pc .",
    "it , then , turns to increase within @xmath69 200 pc toward the center .",
    "the @xmath0 in the disk increases slowly by 2.0 times from @xmath69 3 to 8 kpc . in the bulge region",
    "it seems to decrease inward and then increase near the center , though the error - bar is large .",
    "some luminous bumps of about 0.5 mag @xmath48 are found at @xmath69 700 pc , 5 kpc and at 11 kpc , which may be caused by spiral arms .",
    "the @xmath0 increases systematically inward by about 2 times from @xmath69 300 to 150 pc .",
    "the @xmath0 in the disk region is almost flat , or slowly increases outward . in the bulge region",
    "it decreases inward from @xmath69 2 kpc to 500 pc .",
    "then , it turns to increase steeply toward the center .",
    "the @xmath0 in the disk region increases by 2.4 times from @xmath69 2 to 5 kpc . in the bulge region",
    "it appears to decrease inward , and then turns to increase toward the center .",
    "however , the spatial resolution is not sufficient to confirm the central increase .",
    "the luminosity profile is obtained only in the bulge region .",
    "the @xmath0 in the bulge region decreases distinctly inward by 0.38 times from @xmath69 1.8 kpc to 800 pc .",
    "the @xmath0 in the inner - most region can not be evaluated because of the large spatial resolution .",
    "the @xmath0 in the disk region increases slowly by 3.0 times from @xmath69 5 to 15 kpc . in the bulge region",
    "its variation is difficult to evaluate because of the insufficient resolution as well as due to the large error in the luminosity profile by spiral arms .",
    "it looks flat in the outer bulge and increases inward in the inner bulge region .",
    "the @xmath0 in the disk region is almost flat or rather decreases outward .",
    "the peculiar behavior of the smd , and therefore of the @xmath0 , is probably due to a disturbed rc by the tidal interaction with the companion galaxy ngc 5195 . in the bulge region , the @xmath0 is flat or slightly decreases inward to @xmath69 700 pc . within @xmath69 700",

    "\\(4 ) bulge components show a constant or a slightly smaller value than the disk value .",
    "\\(5 ) for ngc 4527 and ngc 6946 the @xmath0 increases steeply toward the nucleus inside the bulge .",
    "this drastic increase of @xmath0 within @xmath69 500 pc for ngc 4527 and ngc 6946 is of particular interest : for ngc 4527 this increase amounts to @xmath71 times/350pc from @xmath69 500 to 150 pc , and for ngc 6946 , @xmath72 times/500pc from @xmath69 600 to 100 pc .",
    "since the results are based on optical data , these values may be overestimated because of optical extinction .",
    "however , it is known that color gradients like @xmath42 and @xmath73 of face - on galaxies are of the order of 1 mag @xmath48 ( e.g. , de jong & van der kruit 1994 ; terndrup et al .",
    "therefore , we may conclude that the increase of @xmath0 for ngc 6946 , whose inclination is only 30@xmath52 , is significantly greater than that expected from the optical extinction effect . for ngc 4527 with @xmath74 ,",
    "the @xmath75 color gradient is estimated to be about 1.5 mag @xmath48 ( hraudeau et al .",
    "1996 ) . in the present data ,",
    "the luminosity profile of ngc 4527 is in the thuan - gunn @xmath46-band , and we may conclude that the central increase of @xmath0 for ngc 4527 will be also significant .",
    "such a remarkable increase of @xmath0 toward the center is , however , not detected in the other galaxies .",
    "for ngc 1068 , ngc 2903 , ngc 4303 , ngc 4569 , ngc 4736 and ngc 5194 , the spatial resolution is not sufficient to reveal such an increase even if it did exist . for ngc 4321 and ngc 5055",
    "we see some hints of a possible central increase . for the small - mass galaxy , ngc 598",
    ", we can not find any increase inward near the center .    in current studies of the @xmath0 of spiral galaxies ,",
    "the bulge and disk @xmath0s have been assumed to be radially constant .",
    "however , it does not necessarily mean that the total @xmath0 value is constant in the region corresponding to each component : in fig .",
    "8 we present the variations of the @xmath0 for galaxies with inclinations less than @xmath76 . here , the @xmath0 value is normalized to unity at @xmath77 kpc .",
    "it is now obvious that the total @xmath0 is not constant at all within a galaxy , but it varies significantly in the bulge and disk , not only in the massive halo .",
    "the @xmath0 value often increases outward by 100 times/(10@xmath330 ) kpc from the disk to the outer halo .",
    "only one exception is ngc 5194 , whose peculiar behavior of the @xmath0 would be due to the tidal interaction with the companion .",
    "we have used high - accuracy rc data to derive smd profiles for 19 galaxies and @xmath0 profiles for 11 galaxies . for three galaxies , ngc 598 , ngc 4527 , and ngc 6946 , we obtained both high spatial - resolution ( @xmath78 pc ) rcs and luminosity profiles without large irregularities due to spiral arms and/or bars . among these three galaxies , two galaxies ,",
    "ngc 4527 and ngc 6946 , are found to show a steep inward increase of @xmath0 in the central region , @xmath79 500 pc .",
    "such a steep central increase of @xmath0 may imply that the bulges contain an excess of ( dark ) mass inside a few hundred pc , which we call a `` massive dark core '' with a scale radius of 100 @xmath3 200 pc .",
    "this yields a mass of @xmath80 , assuming @xmath81 km s@xmath68 .",
    "the massive dark core could be an object linking the galactic bulge with a massive black hole in the nuclei ( miyoshi et al .",
    "1995 ; genzel et al . 1997 ; ghez et al . 1998 ) and/or massive core objects causing a central keplerian rc ( bertola et al . 1998 ) .    for the sbc galaxy ngc 4527",
    "we have detected both a dark core and a normal bulge within the luminous bulge region .",
    "for the scd galaxy ngc 6946 we found the dark core , whereas we could hardly detect a normal bulge component . on the other hand",
    ", we could see only a normal bulge component in the scd galaxy ngc 598 .",
    "such a difference may indicate that the existence of a dark core may not be directly related to the morphology .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the scale sizes of the dark cores in the two galaxies may not be uniquely correlated with the size of luminous bulges .",
    "although dark cores will have a crucial implication for the formation , evolution and dynamics of the central bulges of galaxies , their origin and universal properties remain open to discussion .",
    "it is interesting to derive the distribution of dark mass fraction ( hereafter dmf ) , @xmath82 , defined by the local dark - to - total mass density ratio at a given @xmath8 .",
    "if the luminosity profile can be corrected for the extinction , we can define the following quantity : @xmath83 where @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 , and @xmath87 denote the smd of the total mass , visible mass , dark mass , and the surface - luminosity density , respectively . if the @xmath0 of stars on the average at a given _ r _",
    ", which will be derived from luminosity profiles by multi - band observations in optical and infrared bands , is known , then we can define the dmf by @xmath88 this quantity can be used to evaluate the dark - matter distribution .",
    "since the absolute calibration of the stellar @xmath0 and the precise correction for the extinction are beyond our scope , here we only briefly attempt to examine qualitative trends of variation of the dmf .",
    "we examine the following two cases : in one case , we assume @xmath89 to be constant and equal to @xmath90 in the inner disk region ; in the other case , we take it equal to half of that .",
    "we thus derive @xmath82(_r _ ) and @xmath86(_r _ ) for ngc 6946 : the results are shown in figs . 9a and 9b , corresponding to the above two cases , respectively .",
    "since @xmath89 will be smaller in the outer disk region owing to the dominance of younger stars of lower metallicity ( e.g. , de jong 1996 ) , we may safely consider that the dmf is at least 80 @xmath3 90 % in the outer disk beyond 8 kpc . in the inner disk region ( @xmath8 @xmath1 4@xmath35 kpc )",
    "the dmf appears to be more than 50 % .",
    "however , the uncertainty is too large to give a more detailed discussion .",
    "\\(a ) we fit the observed luminosity profiles in a logarithmic scale by a non - linear least square fitting by a model , which consists of an exponential bulge and an exponential disk .",
    "the model is given by @xmath91 where @xmath92 and @xmath93 we could successfully fit the data by this model for nine galaxies , except for ngc 4736 and ngc 5194 : ngc 4736 was short of the data in the disk region , and ngc 5194 does not have a disk described by the exponential function probably because of the tidal interaction .",
    "\\(c ) we set the @xmath0 value at @xmath97 to that of the total mass , so that the visible mass becomes maximum in each galaxy . from the consideration in section 2.3 .",
    ", we adopt a flat - disk mass distribution for smds . by subtracting the smds of visible mass from those of total mass , we obtain distributions of dark mass for the nine galaxies .",
    "we define , `` mass - boundary radius '' , @xmath98 , outside of which the fitted smds of visible mass is dominated by the dark mass .",
    "note that , because of the assumption of maximum @xmath0 of visible mass , we , in fact , derive the maximum mass - boundary radius , @xmath99 , inside of which dark mass may even exceed visible mass .    in fig .",
    "10 , we show the results of smd profiles of the total , visible , and dark mass for each galaxy .",
    "the parameters are listed in table 2 .",
    "two interesting points are found : first , dark mass tends to dominate visible mass even in the inner disk region . in fig .",
    "11 , the relation between the effective radius of a disk component , @xmath100 , and @xmath99 is shown .",
    "as @xmath99 is an upper limit of @xmath98 , @xmath100 is approximately equal to or less than @xmath99 .",
    "this trend appears to be independent of morphology , partly because the sample is biased to the late - type galaxy .",
    "second , there may be a linear correlation between the two parameters in fig .",
    "this trend is caused by the maximum @xmath0 of visible mass in a disk .",
    "but the @xmath0s adopted here range from 0.5 to 4.0 except for ngc 6946 , and even if they are set to a half , @xmath99 will be reduced only by a few kpc .",
    "this correlation may indicate that , if any , dark mass traces visible mass only up to @xmath101 at most , and that the luminous scale of galaxies is almost independent of the distribution of a dark halo , because the difference in smd profiles is small ( see fig . 5 and 6 ) .",
