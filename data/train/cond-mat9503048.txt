    "the two - dimensional spin-@xmath1 heisenberg antiferromagnet ( hafm ) has received much attention during the last few years .",
    "the main reason for this new interest stems from the discovery of the ceramic superconductors , which has led to extensive studies of the hafm on a square lattice  @xcite .",
    "an important focal point has been the experimentally observed competition between superconductivity and antiferromagnetic order in these materials .",
    "this has encouraged numerous investigations of disordering effects , in particular the role of frustrating interactions .    to elucidate the role of frustration , it is interesting to study cases where frustration is intrinsic to the lattice structure such as the hafm on a triangular or kagom lattice .",
    "early papers on the triangular hafm  @xcite suggested that the spin-@xmath1 ground state is a spin liquid , lacking long - range order ( lro ) .",
    "more recent studies   point to the scenario of an ordered ground state possibly quite close to a disordering transition . yet other studies support the original proposal of a disordered ground state  @xcite .",
    "the spin dynamics of the model , intimately linked to the character of the ground state , also remains an open question .",
    "the problem of the spin dynamics above a ground state with nel - type order ( a @xmath0 state ) has been attacked with a variety of methods , like linear spin - wave theory ( lswt )  @xcite , nonlinear @xmath2 model  @xcite and schwinger - boson mean - field theory ( sbmft )  @xcite .",
    "the sbmft has proved successful in incorporating quantum fluctuations @xcite , but the choice of mean - field parameters is a delicate matter  @xcite .",
    "yoshioka and miyazaki  @xcite have used the sbmft combined with a resonant valence bond ansatz , and a similar theory including a ferromagnetic component in the mean - field expansion is recently analyzed by lefmann and hedegrd  @xcite .",
    "a drawback of these applications of sbmft is that the lswt structure of the dispersion relation can not be recovered in the limit of infinite spin .",
    "specifically , only two massless spin wave modes can be obtained , in contrast to the three massless modes of lswt .",
    "this is a weakness , since , at an analytical level , the only reliable way to motivate the validity of the theory is to use an approach that correctly reproduces the limit of classical magnetism  @xcite .",
    "we here employ another mean - field treatment , where we use a spin - rotation to identify the relevant mean - field parameters , treating the spin dynamics above a state close to the classical ground state . in this way",
    "three _ modes are obtained , two of which exhibit a massgap at finite spin . however , in the limit of infinite spin , the gap asymptotically vanishes on the relevant energy scale and the corresponding spin wave velocities exactly approach those of lswt .",
    "we discuss the origin of massgaps within this version of sbmft and `` explain '' why there are no gaps in lswt at any value of the spin .",
    "we consider the hamiltonian @xmath3 defined on a triangular lattice and with @xmath4 .",
    "the sums run over all lattice sites @xmath5 and three of the six nearest - neighbor vectors @xmath6 .",
    "we choose the vectors @xmath6 to be    [ alpha ] @xmath7    in units where the lattice constant equals 1 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : triangular ] ) .",
    "the triangular lattice is a bravais lattice and can be divided into three equal interlacing sublattices ( tripartite lattice ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : triangular ] the three sublattices are indicated .",
    "it follows that in the classical limit of large spin , the ground state is a @xmath0 state , i.e. a coplanar state with spins on each sublattice being ferromagnetically ordered and rotated @xmath0 vis a vis the spins on the two other sublattices .",
    "( the lattice constant of a sublattice is @xmath8 times the nearest neighbor spacing why this state also is called a `` @xmath9 state '' . )    when expanding around such a @xmath0 state , it is convenient to start with a local rotation of the spin coordinate system .",
    "the spins on neighboring sublattices are rotated by @xmath10 around the @xmath11-axis when going from @xmath5 to @xmath12 : and in the @xmath13 directions is not equivalent since the @xmath0 state breaks parity .",
    "note that in two dimensions a parity transformation is defined by a reflection in a line . ]",
    "[ eqn : spinrot ] @xmath14    where @xmath15 is defined by @xmath16 with @xmath17 integer .",
    "this implies that @xmath18 let us pick a specific @xmath0 state , with the ( unrotated ) spins on the first sublattice pointing in the @xmath19-direction while on the other two sublattices they span the @xmath20 plane with directions @xmath21 ( @xmath10 ) with respect to the @xmath19-axis when going in the @xmath6 ( @xmath13 ) direction in the lattice .",
    "any classical ground state can clearly be reached from this state by a ( global ) @xmath22 rotation of the spins .",
    "we immediately see that the spin rotation in eqs .",
    "( [ eqn : spinrot ] ) transfers this @xmath0 state into a ferromagnetic state with quantization axes lying in the @xmath20 plane .",
    "the first term in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : spinrotham ] ) vanishes when acting on a ferromagnetic state , and we may hence neglect it when modeling states with a local structure close to a @xmath0 state . in the rotated basis ,",
    "the effective hamiltonian is thus given by @xmath23 we have verified that in our case this approach is equivalent to that in ref .   where an analysis of the frustrated model on the square lattice is performed .",
    "it is interesting to note that in lswt the term that corresponds to @xmath24 in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : spinrotham ] ) is also neglected since it is cubic in the holstein - primakoff bosons .",
    "the schwinger - boson calculation that follows is similar to the treatment of the @xmath25 model on the square lattice  @xcite and on the honeycomb lattice  @xcite .",
    "the spin operators @xmath26 at each lattice site are replaced by two species of schwinger bosons @xmath27 via @xmath28 with the local constraints @xmath29 here @xmath30 is the vector of pauli matrices , and summation over repeated ( greek ) indices is implied .",
    "this leads us to the following hamiltonian : @xmath31 \\ \\ , \\label{bondh}\\ ] ] where we have included the local constraints with lagrange multipliers @xmath32 at each site .",
    "the expression for the summands is @xmath33 with @xmath34 any of the two link operators    @xmath35    the mean - field theory is finally generated by the hartree - fock decoupling @xmath36 where the link fields ( mean - field parameters ) @xmath37 and @xmath38 are taken to be uniform and real . in our mean - field treatment , we also replace the local lagrange multipliers @xmath39 by a single parameter @xmath40 .    for comparison of our results with those of lswt  @xcite it",
    "is convenient to fourier - transform the schwinger bosons independently on each sublattice , @xmath41 with @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 on the three different sublattices respectively .",
    "we then need to decouple the different bosons on the sublattices .",
    "this is done by the canonical transformations    @xmath45    where @xmath46 .",
    "finally we use the bogoliubov transformations    [ eqn : boug ] @xmath47    with @xmath48 to diagonalize the resulting hamiltonian .",
    "this yields free bosons @xmath49 with dispersion relations @xmath50 where the geometrical factors are given by    [ eqn : geo.fact ] @xmath51    by minimizing the free energy we obtain the three equations needed to determine the mean - field parameters :    [ inteq ] @xmath52    here @xmath53 is the area of the reciprocal unit cell of a sublattice , and @xmath54^{-1}$ ] is the bose occupation number . solving the mean - field equations numerically yields values for @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 , which are used to determine thermodynamic quantities at finite temperatures .",
    "given a bravais lattice , as in the present case , a division into sublattices is not necessary when fourier - transforming ( as it is on a non - bravais lattice ) and the theory may be formulated in terms of only one set of bosons .",
    "we have chosen to transform each sublattice independently in order to make the comparison with lswt results more transparent . in our treatment",
    "we thus have a small brillouin zone and three sets of bosons ( _ picture a _ ) , which is equivalent to _ picture b _ where the larger brillouin zone of the real lattice and one of the sets of bosons ( say @xmath58 ) is used ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : brill ] ) .",
    "the equivalence of the two pictures makes it evident why @xmath59 has to be combined with @xmath60 in eqs .",
    "( [ btransfb ] ) and  ( [ btransfc ] ) .",
    "it also explains the structure of the geometrical factors in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : geo.fact ] ) ( remembering that @xmath61 ) .",
    "until now we have used picture a , but e.  g.  in the figures we will use picture b ( one mode ) instead of showing plots for three different modes . since mode @xmath62 and @xmath63 in picture a are degenerate we will sometimes refer to them as the corner modes which is picture b language . to avoid confusion",
    "we indicate in the following which picture we use .",
    "in two dimensions there can be lro only at zero temperature .",
    "this means that exactly at @xmath64 there is an abrupt phase transition , and we must be careful when reducing @xmath65 to zero . as we see from eq .",
    "( [ inteq ] ) , the parameters @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 will depend on temperature via the bose occupation number @xmath66 , and hence , to calculate properties at @xmath64 we need to pass to a zero temperature formalism .",
    "following ref .",
    "we note that lro corresponds to a condensation of the schwinger bosons at some points @xmath67 in the brillouin zone and we obtain the mean - field equations at @xmath64 from eq .",
    "( [ inteq ] ) by the replacement @xmath68 where @xmath69 is a new unknown quantity measuring the bose condensate .",
    "since the condensation of the bosons implies that there is no gap in the spin - wave spectrum ( @xmath70 in ( [ dispersion1 ] ) ) at @xmath64 , these @xmath71 equations together with the three equations in  ( [ inteq ] ) are sufficient to determine the @xmath72 parameters @xmath57 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath69 .",
    "the procedure is the following : we start at a finite temperature and use eqs .",
    "( [ inteq ] ) to determine the mean - field parameters which gives us the dispersion relation .",
    "we then lower the temperature and examine the dispersion relation to identify the points in the brillouin zone where the gap scales down with temperature . in our case",
    "this happens for each of the three modes ( picture a ) at @xmath73 .",
    "we expand the dispersion relation around these points and for small @xmath74 the dispersion relations ( [ dispersion1 ] ) takes the relativistic form @xmath75 .",
    "carrying out the expansion we find that the spin - wave velocities @xmath76 are given by @xmath77 and @xmath78 the masses @xmath79 in the energy gap @xmath80 of the spin - wave excitations can in turn be extracted from @xmath81 and @xmath82 to examine whether we have condensation of bosons for all modes , we first consider the gaps , or the masses , since condensation of the bosons at @xmath83 implies that we have no gap in the spectrum at this point . to get all modes massless ( @xmath84 ) we need to have @xmath85 ( from eqs .",
    "( [ m1 ] ) and  ( [ m23 ] ) ) . since @xmath86 and @xmath87",
    "we see from eq .",
    "( [ angle ] ) that we must have equalities between _ finite _ quantities as @xmath88 and @xmath89 . but doing the replacement in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : t=0-replacement ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ inteq ] ) for all three modes then gives @xmath90 from eqs .",
    "( [ inteqb ] ) and  ( [ inteqc ] ) , in contradiction to the initial assumption . the only way to get three massless modes is to have @xmath88 _ infinite _ , which then yields @xmath91 at _ infinite spin @xmath92 _ as seen from eq .",
    "( [ inteqa ] ) .",
    "the result of the procedure above is that for finite spin @xmath92 we will get a condensation of the bosons only for the first mode which scales faster to zero than the two other modes . for this mode",
    "we do the replacement shown in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : t=0-replacement ] ) ( @xmath93 and @xmath94 ) into eq .",
    "( [ inteq ] ) ( @xmath95 ) and since @xmath96 , eq .",
    "( [ m1 ] ) gives @xmath57 in terms of @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "after these substitutions we have no temperature dependence in eqs .",
    "( [ inteq ] ) .    with this zero temperature formalism",
    "we have studied the _",
    "spin _ dependence of the mass @xmath97 ( @xmath98 ) . as we see in fig .",
    "[ fig : m2vss ] the mass goes to zero in the limit of infinitely large spin and we recover the three massless modes of lswt . the dispersion relation in eq .",
    "( [ dispersion1 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath99 which immediately can be compared with the lswt result , eq .",
    "( 13 ) in ref .  .",
    "to get the lswt results we need @xmath85 , which is ( as we have already seen ) the condition to obtain three massless modes ( @xmath84 ) .",
    "thus , in the limit of infinitely large spin , where we in fact obtain three massless modes , we _ exactly _ recover the lswt results . in fig .",
    "[ fig : omega ] we show the dispersion relation for two values of the spin @xmath92 .",
    "we see that on the relevant energy scale the gaps at the corners ( picture b ) go to zero and for infinite spin we recover the lswt dispersion relation .    we have also calculated the spin - wave velocities @xmath76 ( @xmath100 ) at @xmath64 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : ratioc1ratioc23vss ] we see the results compared with the lswt results extracted from ref .",
    "( which agree with the nonlinear @xmath2 model results in ref .  ):",
    "@xmath101 and @xmath102 . for large spin @xmath92",
    "we have good agreement with these results .",
    "we have also examined the ratio of the two spin - wave velocities , as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : c1c23ratiovss ] .",
    "to summarize : we have performed a sbmft analysis of the spin dynamics of the antiferromagnetic heisenberg model on a triangular lattice , expanding around a state with local @xmath0 order .",
    "considering that the @xmath0 state has been favored as a candidate ground state in several studies , this is a natural approach . in order to identify the relevant fields in such an expansion",
    ", we have performed a spin - rotation and we have also neglected the part of the hamiltonian which gives no contribution in the classical limit .    in the limit of infinitely large spin",
    "we obtain three massless modes in the dispersion relation of the spin - waves , exactly recovering the lswt results , including the spin wave velocities .",
    "this is an improvement on earlier sbmft calculations on the triangular lattice  @xcite , where the @xmath103 limit does not come out correctly . at finite",
    "spin , however , two of the modes acquire a mass . this can be understood as follows : the effective hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : effham ] ) is invariant under rotations in the @xmath20 plane , and the @xmath104 symmetry of the original model is lowered to @xmath105 . since the @xmath0 state breaks this @xmath105 symmetry , we should obtain _ one _ goldstone mode , which agrees with our results for finite spin .",
    "we do not believe that the massiveness of the other modes are due to enhanced quantum fluctuations at finite spin : if the effective hamiltonian had preserved the @xmath104 symmetry of the full hamiltonian we should probably have recovered the three goldstone modes as expected .",
    "we are also led to this conclusion by the discussion in ref .   where the analogous problem of the frustrated square lattice model is considered .",
    "we have already mentioned that the term in the full hamiltonian that we neglect in order to obtain the effective hamiltonian is also neglected in lswt . yet , lswt predicts three massless modes for arbitrary spin , even though the lswt hamiltonian is not @xmath104 invariant . from fig .",
    "[ fig : m2vss ] we see that for large spin the mass @xmath97 ( @xmath98 ) goes approximately as @xmath106 and from fig .",
    "[ fig : ratioc1ratioc23vss ] we see that the spin - wave velocities goes like the lswt result , that is , they are proportional to @xmath92 .",
    "thus , the energy gap goes like @xmath107 .",
    "since the energy in lswt only retains powers of @xmath92 larger than or equal to @xmath108 and the massgap is approximately proportional to @xmath109 , one still obtains massless modes in lswt . in the same sense that lswt is correct for large spin ( neglecting terms of order @xmath110 , @xmath111 ) our results are valid for large spins , neglecting energy terms of the order of the massgap .",
    "it is interesting to note that the modes at the corners of the brillouin zone ( picture b ) describes fluctuations in the @xmath11-component of the spin , while the center mode describes in - plane fluctuations  @xcite . the first term in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : spinrot ] ) is independent of the @xmath11-component , which means that fluctuations in this component are described equally well by the effective and the full hamiltonian .",
    "this makes the value of the spin - wave velocity at the corner modes more reliable than that at the center mode , since this last value directly depends on the difference between the effective and the full hamiltonian",
    ".    it should be interesting to perform an extended analysis of the spin dynamics above a state with local @xmath0 order .",
    "starting with the approach of lefmann and hedegrd  @xcite , one may write the hamiltonian in terms of a singlet field ( also considered by yoshioka and miyazaki  @xcite ) and a field representing the ferromagnetic correlations , _ and then perform a spin rotation_. certain pieces of the two fields then combines to a constant term and the remaining parts can be written in terms of four effective fields . diagonalizing this form of the hamiltonian using the sbmft may possibly yield a dispersion relation which can take all solutions into account _ within the same mean - field theory_. the solution presented in this paper is valid for large spin , as we have already argued , but this approach may help answering for which magnitudes of the spin the solutions of ref .   and ref .",
    "are relevant .",
    "we will return to this subject .",
