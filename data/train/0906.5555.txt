    "in this note we make a few observations on the hecke algebra @xmath0 .",
    "our main reference is jones s seminal paper @xcite . as an algebra , @xmath0 is generated by the same symbols @xmath1 as artin s braid group @xmath2 .",
    "in addition to the standard relations of @xmath2 ( that is , @xmath3 for @xmath4 and @xmath5 for all @xmath6 ) we also impose @xmath7    for topologists , the hecke algebra is significant because of its role in the original definition of the homfly and jones polynomials @xcite ( see also @xcite for a concise survey ) .",
    "namely , using ocneanu s trace @xmath8 $ ] , the _ framed _ homfly polynomial @xmath9 of a braid @xmath10 is obtained as @xmath11 in words : for @xmath10 , take its natural representation @xmath12 ( a common abuse of notation ) and its trace , substitute @xmath13 in it , and normalize suitably .",
    "if @xmath14 has exponent sum @xmath15 , then @xmath16 is an expression for the homfly polynomial of the oriented link @xmath17 which is the closure of @xmath14 .",
    "this is the version that satisfies the skein relation @xmath18 { skeinpos } } -vp_{\\includegraphics[totalheight=8pt]{skeinneg } } = zp_{\\includegraphics[totalheight=8pt ] { skeinsmooth}}\\ ] ] and the normalizing condition that for the unknot , we have @xmath19{circle}}(v , z)=1 $ ] .    from , it is not hard to deduce the famous morton  franks  williams inequalities @xcite : @xmath20    we will refer to these as the _ lower _ and _ upper mfw estimates_. the well - known bound on the braid index of oriented links is their immediate consequence",
    ". we will pay special attention to the `` extremal parts '' of @xmath21 with respect to . in that spirit , let the _",
    "left column _ of @xmath21 be denoted with @xmath22    [ def ] for any @xmath10 , let @xmath23 denote the braid obtained by writing the letters of a braid word representative of @xmath14 in reverse order .",
    "now for any two braids @xmath24 and @xmath14 on @xmath25 strands , define their _ left inner product _ by the formula @xmath26    this depends only on the braids and not on any representatives .",
    "the left inner product has a well - defined extension to the entire algebra @xmath0 as a bilinear form with values in @xmath27 $ ] .",
    "it is also symmetric :    for any @xmath28 , we have @xmath29 .",
    "consider the standard planar diagram for the closure of @xmath30 , and a line @xmath31 in the plane that is ( roughly ) perpendicular to the braid strands .",
    "rotate the diagram about @xmath31 in @xmath32 in three - space .",
    "the result is a standard diagram for the closure of @xmath33 ( hence the two closures are isotopic ) , except that the orientations of the strands are all reversed .",
    "such an overall change of orientation does not affect the homfly polynomial @xmath34 .",
    "since the exponent sums in @xmath30 and @xmath33 are the same , they also share the same framed homfly polynomial .    as a @xmath27$]module ,",
    "@xmath0 is free of rank @xmath35 .",
    "we will need two of its well known bases : the set of positive permutation braids , @xmath36 , and that of negative permutation braids , @xmath37 .",
    "the proof of our main result in the next section uses some standard techniques from legendrian knot theory . the summary given here",
    "is kept to a bare minimum while the interested reader is referred to @xcite .",
    "the standard contact structure @xmath38 in @xmath39 is the kernel of the @xmath40-form @xmath41 .",
    "a smooth link is _ legendrian _ if it is everywhere tangent to @xmath38 .",
    "the _ front projection _ of such a curve appears on the @xmath42-plane .",
    "generic fronts are immersed except for finitely many cusps . since @xmath43",
    ", they do not have self - tangencies or tangents parallel to the @xmath44-axis ( hence they contain an equal number of _ left and right cusps _ ) , and at their transverse self - intersections , the strand with lower slope appears as the overcrossing one .",
    "let @xmath45 be a generic , oriented front diagram with @xmath46 cusps .",
    "its _ thurston  bennequin number _ is @xmath47 , where @xmath15 is the writhe .",
    "an _ oriented ruling _",
    "@xcite of @xmath45 is a collection @xmath48 of positive crossings in @xmath45 with the following properties . after performing the smoothing operation @xmath49{splice}$ ] to all elements of @xmath48 ,",
    "the resulting diagram is a ( not necessarily disjoint ) union of _ eyes _ , that is simple closed curves so that each contains exactly one left and one right cusp .",
    "the two arcs at the site of the smoothing of any @xmath50 belong to different eyes , say @xmath51 and @xmath52 . finally , if we draw a line parallel to the @xmath44-axis through @xmath53 , then the segments in which it intersects the interiors of @xmath51 and @xmath52 are either disjoint or contained in one another",
    ".    one measure of the complexity of a ruling is @xmath54 and then we may measure the complexity of a front @xmath45 by summing @xmath55 over all of its oriented rulings .",
    "this laurent polynomial is called the ( oriented ) _ ruling polynomial _ of @xmath45 .",
    "a key connection was provided by rutherford @xcite when he showed that the ruling polynomial coincides with the coefficient of @xmath56 in the homfly polynomial @xmath57 of the oriented link type @xmath58 represented by @xmath45 .",
    "note in this regard that ( by the transverse push - off trick , bennequin s results on braiding transverse links @xcite , and ) the minimum @xmath59-degree in @xmath57 is an upper bound for @xmath60 for all fronts @xmath45 representing @xmath58 .",
    "the following construction will be helpful in the next section .",
    "let @xmath61 be a permutation .",
    "we define a legendrian tangle @xmath62 as follows .",
    "place the permutation matrix of @xmath63 on the @xmath42plane as indicated in the left panel of figure [ fig : egyperm ] ( with the @xmath40 s of the matrix represented by dots ) .",
    "start line segments in the northwest and southwest directions from each dot as shown . finally , turn the union of the segments into a front diagram as in the right panel , replacing the dots with cusps .",
    "note that @xmath62 is a legendrian realization of the negative permutation braid @xmath64 .",
    "@xmath65 at 390 10 @xmath44 at 10 380   of the three - cycle @xmath66.,title=\"fig:\",width=288 ]",
    "the basis @xmath37 of @xmath0 consisting of negative permutation braids is orthonormal with respect to the left inner product .",
    "let @xmath63 and @xmath67 be elements of @xmath68 . consider the legendrian representative of @xmath69 whose front projection is shown in the left side of figure [ fig : ketperm ] .",
    "it is constructed from the tangle @xmath62 and @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is a rotation in @xmath32 about the @xmath44axis in three - space .",
    "observe that it has oriented rulings if and only if @xmath72 , and in that case a unique one with @xmath73 .",
    "( because all crossings are negative in the front , the only possible oriented ruling is the empty set , and for that to work , the left and right cusps have to be readily matched up . )",
    "thus its ruling polynomial is either @xmath74 or @xmath75 depending on whether @xmath72 or not . as the thurston ",
    "bennequin number of this front is @xmath76 , where the non - positive quantity @xmath15 is the combined algebraic number of crossings in @xmath63 and @xmath67 , from rutherford s theorem we see that this ruling polynomial is the coefficient of @xmath77 in the homfly polynomial , that is the coefficient of @xmath78 in the framed homfly polynomial .",
    "the proposition follows immediately .",
    "in particular if @xmath14 is a positive braid , these coefficients always have a geometric interpretation as ruling polynomials .",
    "namely , @xmath82 is the ruling polynomial of the front diagram shown in the right side of figure [ fig : ketperm ] . here , @xmath14 is to be drawn in the indicated box horizontally , with crossings appearing as @xmath83{generator}$ ] .",
    "( here , the key is that the diagram only contains @xmath84 cusps .",
    "the same is possible for @xmath85 , where @xmath86 and @xmath87 are positive and @xmath88 is a negative permutation braid . )",
    "analogous to definition [ def ] , a _",
    "right inner product _ may be constructed using the coefficient of the other extreme term in the framed homfly polynomial : @xmath89 with respect to this , the basis @xmath90 of positive permutation braids is orthonormal .",
    "one easy way of showing this is by noting the identity @xmath91 for any braids @xmath28 .      the lower ( resp .",
    "upper ) mfw estimate is _ not _",
    "sharp for the braid @xmath14 if and only if @xmath14 is orthogonal in terms of the left ( resp .",
    "right ) inner product to the unit braid in the hecke algebra .",
    "we close the paper by indicating two possible directions for future research .",
    "the fact that the left and right inner products are polynomial - valued suggests a rich structure that might be further explored . for example , one may ask about specific values of @xmath44 : are some more significant than others ? can we associate special @xmath44 values to particular braids in a meaningful way ?    also , one may wonder whether other parts of the homfly polynomial can be used to define inner products , as well as if there are natural inner products that make other bases , such as the kazhdan  lusztig basis , orthogonal .",
