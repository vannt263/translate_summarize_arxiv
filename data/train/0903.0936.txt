    "the entanglement phenomenon is one of the most important quantum properties of multimode gaussian states ( both pure and mixed ) was studied in the context of their separability and entanglement in @xcite where the peres - horodecki criterion of separability @xcite was implemented for detecting the entanglement of two - mode - light gaussian state .",
    "the peres - horodecki criterion of separability of a quantum state is based on the property of positive but not completely positive map of the density matrix @xcite , which is the transpose transform of the density matrix . for a separable state of a bipartite system ,",
    "the partial transpose transform applied to variables of one subsystem yields a new density matrix that corresponds to the physical state . for the density matrix of an entangled state , the partial transpose transform can give a matrix that is a negative hermitian matrix .",
    "the criterion ( called ppt - criterion ) was used in @xcite to study the entanglement of gaussian states of photons .",
    "later on , other researchers successfully applied the ppt - criterion ( see , for example , [ 69 ] ) .",
    "the other separability criterion based on a nonpositive map of the density matrix , called the partial scaling transform , was suggested in @xcite ; its implementation is connected with properties of the wigner function @xcite with respect to the scaling of momentum . for a separable state of a two - mode light",
    ", the scaling of the second component of momentum provides an admissible wigner function .",
    "the scaling criterion can be extended to the case of multipartite quantum states .",
    "the ppt - criterion is a special case of the scaling criterion with the choice of the scaling parameter equal to @xmath3 .",
    "the scaling criterion was used recently by chirkin and saigin @xcite to study the entanglement properties of three - mode light generated in nonlinear crystals due to the interaction , where three different processes are involved , namely , two parametric down - conversions and one parametric up - conversion .    in this work , we study the application of the scaling criterion to three- and four - mode photon states .",
    "we consider both the pure and mixed states . our aim is to find some empirical correlations of the degree of entanglement and negative values of principal minors of the photon quadrature dispersion matrix as functions of the scaling parameters .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .    in sec .",
    "2 the definition of separability is discussed . in sec .",
    "3 the peres - horodecki criterion is reviewed .",
    "the properties of scaling transform are discussed in sec .",
    "the application of the scaling criterion to the three - mode case is elaborated in sec.5 , while the four - mode case is studied for a pure gaussian photon state in sec .",
    "a mixed four - mode gaussian state is considered in sec .",
    "some conclusions and perspectives are presented in sec .",
    "we consider a single - mode photon state described by the quadrature operators @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the density matrix @xmath6 of any field state obeys the following conditions : @xmath7 when taking a transpose of the density matrix , these conditions are kept for a new transposed state : @xmath8 the transpose transform of the density matrix is equivalent to the time inversion or complex conjugation of the density matrix .",
    "there is a one - to - one correspondence between density operators and wigner quasidistribution functions @xmath9 . from the definition of the wigner function",
    "it follows that the transpose transform of @xmath6 is equivalent to a mirror reflection of momentum @xmath10 in the phase space , namely , @xmath11    now we consider a two - mode state with the density operator @xmath12 and annihilation operators @xmath13 we say that a state is simply separable if @xmath14 a separable two - mode state is defined as a state with the density operator representable as a convex sum of simply separable states : @xmath15 here @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the density operators of modes 1 and 2 , respectively .",
    "the states which can not be presented in such a form are called entangled states . in other words , by definition , an entangled state is a state which can not be presented as a convex sum of simply separable states .",
    "it is evident from ( 4 ) that the partial transpose , i.e. , the transpose of a matrix for the second - mode term @xmath18 , leads to a separable positive density operator @xmath19 thus , @xmath20 describes a new separable state .    summarizing , we can say that the partial transpose @xmath21 of a separable state necessarily gives the density operator , which fits the conditions ( 1 ) .",
    "this is the peres - horodecki criterion of separability .    rewriting the decomposition ( 5 ) in terms of wigner functions we obtain @xmath22",
    "let us consider the wigner function of the generic gaussian form @xmath23 where the four - dimensional vector @xmath24 reads @xmath25 and the matrix @xmath26 is a @xmath27 real symmetric variance matrix @xmath28 with @xmath29 .    from ( 3 ) and ( 8) it is easy to see that the partial transpose is equivalent to the transform of a variance matrix @xmath30 , which is defined as follows : @xmath31",
    "the conditions of existence of a partial transposed state in the gaussian case can be rewritten in the form of the robertson - schr@xmath32dinger uncertainty relation @xcite .",
    "thus , the peres - horodecki criterion of separability is equivalent to the condition of positivity of principal minors of the matrix @xmath33 where @xmath34 here the dimensionless units with @xmath35 are used .",
    "since the transform considered does not change the minors but the determinant , the peres - horodecki criterion can be simplified into the inequality @xmath36    this criterion is a necessary and sufficient condition of separability of gaussian states in the two - mode case , but the application of the peres - horodecki criterion to the @xmath37-mode case with @xmath38 fails to detect all entangled states .",
    "now we consider a scaling transform , which is applicable for detecting the entanglement of gaussian states .",
    "we generalize the reflection transform @xmath39 in the phase space and use the scaling of momentum @xmath40 . in that way",
    ", we define the map @xmath41 for @xmath42 $ ] , this map defines a semigroup of maps .",
    "the map ( 15 ) is equivalent to the scaling of time @xmath43 . in the case",
    "@xmath44 , this is an identical map ; for @xmath45 we have a partial transpose used in the peres - horodecki criterion of separability , which was discussed in the previous section .    upon applying the scaling transform",
    ", the single - mode wigner function @xmath9 modifies as follows : @xmath46 where @xmath47 is a normalization constant .",
    "the initial wigner function is normalized @xmath48 and the transformed wigner function must be normalized , as well : @xmath49 substituting @xmath50 into the integral ( 18 ) , we obtain @xmath51 taking into account ( 16 ) we have the following result for the normalization constant @xmath47 : @xmath52 hence , the scaling transform modifies the wigner function as follows : @xmath53    now we find out how the partial scaling transform affects the dispersion matrix of the two - mode quantum state .",
    "we perform the scaling of the second momentum by the factor of @xmath54 , @xmath55 obviously , the variance matrix @xmath26 converts into @xmath56    we obtain a test of separability based on the robertson - schr@xmath32dinger uncertainty relation for the partially scaled matrix @xmath57 @xmath58",
    "changing the sign for one momentum only may not be efficient in the case of three and more modes .",
    "the peres - horodecki criterion detects the bipartite entanglement .",
    "this limitation can be overcome using the scaling transform by changing momenta for several modes in different ways . in the three - mode case",
    ", we can apply the following transform : @xmath59 the scaling parameters are determined , as in the previous case , in the domain from @xmath3 to @xmath60 , namely , @xmath61 $ ] , @xmath62 $ ] , and @xmath63 $ ] .",
    "the applied transform leads to the scaled variance matrix @xmath64    the uncertainty relation for the scaled matrix demonstrates the criterion of separability . since the first three principal minors remain unchanged , taking into consideration the initial uncertainty relation , the criterion reduces to the three inequalities : @xmath65 \\geq 0,\\ ] ] @xmath66 \\geq 0,\\ ] ] and @xmath67 \\geq 0.\\ ] ] here @xmath68 is the @xmath69 identity matrix . the fifth and fourth principal minors are denoted as @xmath70 and @xmath71 , respectively .",
    "the criterion consists in checking the sign of functions @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 in the domain @xmath75 \\times [ -1 , 1 ] \\times [ -1 , 1]$ ] .",
    "the negativity of one function is an indicator of entanglement of the given state with a certain variance matrix .",
    "below it will be shown that the absolute value of negative function @xmath72 is connected with the degree of entanglement .",
    "we consider a specific pure three - mode gaussian state with the wave function as follows : @xmath76 where @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and @xmath79 are the parameters of quadratic form determining the degree of entanglement .",

    "is nonnegative in the domain @xmath75 \\times [ -1 , 1 ] \\times [ -1 , 1]$ ] .",
    "so , for this separable state , the uncertainty relation holds and the criterion does not show any entanglement . otherwise , for any @xmath97 , such a pair @xmath103 and @xmath104 exists for which @xmath105 is negative",
    "thus , the partial scaling criterion ( 27 ) detects the entanglement in this case .",
    "moreover , it is easy to see that the rate and area of negativity increases with the coefficient @xmath77 .",
    "these facts will be demonstrated by some examples below .",
    "an illustrative example is shown in fig .",
    "1 . contour plots present the function @xmath85 with @xmath86 . to show that the graph is moving down with increase in entanglement , we constructed contour plots for @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",

    "the area between lines is a positive part of the function .",
    "it is worth mentioning that for @xmath108 or , in other words , for the maximum entanglement in this case , the positive part collapses to the line @xmath109 . in the considered case , it is the line @xmath110 .",
