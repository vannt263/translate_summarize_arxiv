    "fluid flows in two spatial dimensions have been the subject of substantial research efforts in recent decades . for the greater part of the twentieth century",
    ", it was generally considered that two - dimensional ( 2d ) flows were merely a theoretical idealization with limited practical relevance .",
    "this conception has changed drastically since the 1980s , when experiments in thin electrolyte layers @xcite , soap films @xcite , and liquid metals @xcite demonstrated that nearly 2d flows can indeed be realized in the laboratory . today , experimental approximations of 2d flows are widely employed as models of atmospheric and oceanic flows @xcite .",
    "being theoretically and experimentally more amenable than their three - dimensional ( 3d ) counterparts , 2d flows have also served as platforms for studying new phenomena such as turbulent cascades @xcite , coherent structures @xcite , and mixing @xcite .",
    "hence , experimental studies of 2d flows , with quantitative comparisons to theoretical predictions , are important for improving our understanding of fluid flows , in both 2d and 3d",
    ".    perhaps one of the best known 2d fluid flow models is a flow introduced by andrey kolmogorov in 1959 as a mathematical problem for studying hydrodynamic stability @xcite .",
    "the kolmogorov flow represents the motion of a viscous fluid in two dimensions ( we will refer to these as @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) driven by a forcing that points along the @xmath0-direction and varies sinusoidally along the @xmath1-direction .",
    "the fluid flow is considered incompressible , @xmath2 , and is governed by the 2d navier - stokes equation , @xmath3 here , @xmath4 is the velocity field , @xmath5 is the 2d pressure field , and @xmath6 represents the driving force with amplitude @xmath7 and wavenumber @xmath8 . the parameters @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the density and the kinematic viscosity of the fluid , respectively .",
    "kolmogorov flow has served as a convenient model for understanding a wide variety of hydrodynamic phenomena in 2d , such as fluid instabilities @xcite , 2d turbulence @xcite , and coherent structures @xcite .",
    "practically realizable flows , however , are never strictly 2d . experimental approximations of kolmogorov flow have often been carried out in either shallow layers of electrolytes @xcite or in soap films @xcite , wherein geometric confinement suppresses the component of velocity along one of the spatial directions ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "the remaining two velocity components , however , generally depend on both extended and confined coordinates , making the flow `` quasi - two - dimensional '' ( q2d ) . to account for the dependence on the confined coordinate , q2d flows in shallow layers",
    "have often been modelled by adding a linear friction term to the 2d navier - stokes equation ( [ eq:2dns ] ) : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is a constant .",
    "the addition of this term was first suggested by @xcite to model a q2d flow generated in a homogeneous shallow electrolyte layer .",
    "in such a flow , the bottom of the fluid layer is constrained to be at rest because it is in contact with the solid surface of the container holding the fluid .",
    "this no - slip constraint at the bottom of the fluid layer causes a gradient in the magnitude of the horizontal velocity * u * along the confined direction @xmath11 .",
    "@xcite rationalized that the dissipation due to this shear , for sufficiently shallow fluid layers , is captured by the linear friction term . in the context of q2d flows in electrolyte layers ,",
    "this term has come to be known as `` rayleigh friction . ''",
    "experimental flows in thin layers as well as models that employ equation ( [ eq:2dns_wf ] ) are now commonly referred to as `` kolmogorov - like , '' when the forcing profile is nearly sinusoidal .",
    "experimental realizations of q2d flows in recent years have employed two - fluid - layer setups : either a setup with _ miscible _",
    "layers comprised of a heavy electrolyte fluid ( salt water ) beneath a lighter nonconducting fluid ( pure water ) @xcite , or a setup with _",
    "immiscible _ layers comprised of a heavy dielectric fluid beneath a lighter electrolyte @xcite .",
    "the rationale behind these modifications was that in addition to confinement , density stratification and immiscibility should enhance two - dimensionality in the top layer .",
    "theoretical models of q2d experimental flows realized in stratified layers of fluids , however , have not accurately modelled the effect of the gradient in the magnitude of horizontal velocity @xmath14 along the confined direction @xmath11 .",
    "consequently , experiments were compared with simulations based on the 2d model ( [ eq:2dns_wf ] ) with empirically estimated parameters @xcite .    to address this deficiency , @xcite",
    "have investigated the variation in the horizontal velocity @xmath14 along the confined direction @xmath11 for a stratified two - immiscible - layer setup .",
    "the following modified version of equation ( [ eq:2dns_wf ] ) which accounts for the inherent three - dimensionality of a q2d flow and describes its evolution quantitatively was proposed : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is a numerical prefactor to the advection term that was not accounted for previously .",
    "this prefactor reflects the decrease of the mean inertia of the fluid layer due to the variation of the horizontal velocity in the vertical direction .",
    "equation ( [ eq:2dns_mod ] ) has been derived from first principles by depth - averaging the full 3d navier - stokes equation under the q2d approximation ( cf . appendix [ sec : sensitivity ] ) .",
    "the coefficients @xmath13 , @xmath10 , and @xmath17 are estimated by including effects of both the inhomogeneity in fluid properties as well the vertical profile of @xmath14 along @xmath11 .",
    "equations ( [ eq:2dns ] ) and ( [ eq:2dns_wf ] ) can be treated as special cases of ( [ eq:2dns_mod ] ) with suitable choices of the parameters @xmath13 and @xmath17 .",
    "furthermore , equation ( [ eq:2dns_wf ] ) can also be obtained from ( [ eq:2dns_mod ] ) by rescaling the variables ( cf .",
    "appendix [ sec : nondim ] ) .",
    "in this article we study instabilities of a q2d kolmogorov - like flow realized in a setup with two immiscible fluid layers .",
    "we compare experiments with results from direct numerical simulations ( dns ) of equation ( [ eq:2dns_mod ] ) .",
    "most previous studies of kolmogorov - like flow compared experiments to theoretical analysis of a perfectly sinusoidal shear flow on unbounded or periodic domain @xcite . while some of these studies reported quantitative agreement between theory and experiment in regards to the primary instability , none where able to match simultaneously both the critical reynolds number and the critical wavenumber . even matching one of these required treating the rayleigh friction coefficient @xmath13 as an adjustable parameter . to address these difficulties , we systematically investigate the effects of lateral confinement , which was not properly addressed by the previous studies , using numerical simulations with three different sets of boundary conditions .",
    "furthermore , we investigate how the observed flow patterns and their stability are affected by the deviations in the forcing profile from perfect periodicity in the extended directions and by the variation of the forcing profile in the confined direction .",
    "finally , we compare the results of numerical simulations with the experimental observations for the secondary instability , which introduces time - dependence into the flow .",
    "the prospect of developing a 2d model that quantitatively describes the evolution of a q2d flow is particularly appealing in view of the recent theoretical advances in understanding transitional flows and weak turbulence as a dynamical process guided by nonchaotic , unstable solutions of the navier - stokes equation , often referred to as exact coherent structures ( ecs ) @xcite .",
    "the bulk of numerical studies have explored the role of ecs in 3d flows simulated on periodic domains with simple geometries , such as pipe flow , plane couette flow , and plane poiseuille flow . however ,",
    "experimental evidence for the role of ecs is scarce @xcite , in part due to technical limitations in obtaining spatially and temporally resolved 3d velocity fields .",
    "q2d flows , on the other hand , can be quantified using 2d planar velocity fields which are relatively easy to measure .",
    "hence , experimental q2d flows that can be described by a 2d model serve as an ideal platform for testing and developing an ecs - based approach to understanding turbulence .",
    "recently , @xcite and @xcite have identified dozens of ecs in numerical simulations of a weakly turbulent 2d kolmogorov flow , governed by equation ( [ eq:2dns ] ) with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "we hope that this paper helps provide a rigorous foundation for future studies in the same spirit , but with a focus on experimental validation of theoretical predictions .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in  [ sec : exp_setup ] , we describe the experimental setup employed to generate a q2d kolmogorov - like flow . in  [ sec : model ] , we introduce a realistic model of the forcing in the experiment and discuss different types of lateral boundary conditions which are used to study the effects of confinement theoretically . in  [ sec : comparison ] , we compare the flow fields obtained from experimental measurements with those from the numerical simulations for different flow regimes and characterize the bifurcations associated with increasing the forcing strength .",
    "conclusions are presented in  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "we generate a q2d kolmogorov - like flow in the experiment using a stratified setup with two immiscible fluid layers , first introduced by @xcite . in this configuration , a lighter electrolyte",
    "is suspended on top of a denser dielectric , which serves as a lubricant between the electrolyte layer and the solid surface at the bottom of the container which holds the fluids .",
    "the fluid layers are set in motion using lorentz forces resulting from the interaction of a direct current passing through the electrolyte and a spatially varying magnetic field .",
    "we use a magnet array consisting of 14 ndfeb magnets ( grade n42 ) to generate a magnetic field that varies roughly sinusoidally along one direction , approximating the forcing in the kolmogorov flow .",
    "each magnet in the array is 15.24 cm long and 1.27 cm wide , with a thickness of @xmath18 cm .",
    "the magnetization is parallel to the thickness dimension , with a surface field strength of about 0.2 t. the magnets are positioned side - by - side along their width to form a 15.24 cm @xmath19 ( @xmath20 cm ) @xmath19 0.32 cm array such that the adjacent magnets have fields pointing in opposite directions , normal to the plane of the array .",
    "this magnet array is placed on a flat aluminum plate of dimensions 30.5 cm @xmath19 30.5 cm @xmath19 1.0 cm , and rectangular pieces of aluminum with the same thickness as the magnets ( @xmath21 cm ) are placed beside the magnet array to create a level surface .",
    "manufacturing imperfections in the individual magnets and the aluminum siding result in a surface which is not adequately smooth . hence",
    ", a thin glass plate measuring @xmath22 cm @xmath19 @xmath22 cm in area with a thickness of @xmath23 cm is placed atop the magnets and siding to provide a uniform bottom surface .",
    "a thin layer of black , adhesive contact paper ( with approximate thickness 0.005 cm ) is placed on top of the glass plate to serve as a dark background for imaging .",
    "the surface of the contact paper serves as the bottom boundary for the fluids .",
    "we place the origin of our coordinate system at this height and the lateral centre of the magnet array , with the @xmath0-coordinate aligned with the magnets longest side , the @xmath1-coordinate pointing in the direction of the magnet array periodicity , and the @xmath11-coordinate in the vertical direction .",
    "a schematic diagram is shown in figure [ expsetup ] .",
    "rectangular bars of acrylic are affixed directly onto the contact paper to create the lateral boundaries of the container that will hold the fluids .",
    "parallel to the @xmath1-direction , two bars are placed at a distance of 17.8 cm apart , centred about the origin .",
    "these solid boundaries for the fluid are henceforth referred to as the `` end walls . '' similarly , running parallel to the @xmath0-direction , two electrodes mounted on rectangular bars of acrylic are placed at a distance of 22.9 cm , symmetrically relative to the origin .",
    "these boundaries are henceforth referred to as the `` side walls '' and are used to drive the current through the electrolyte .",
    "the placement of the end walls and side walls leaves a buffer region of @xmath24 cm and @xmath25 cm , respectively , between the edge of the magnet array and these solid boundaries .",
    "the aluminum plate upon which the magnets are mounted is supported by three screws , which are adjusted to level the system .",
    "the interior of the container is filled with @xmath26 ml of a dielectric fluid and @xmath27 ml of an electrolyte to form two immiscible layers that are @xmath28 cm and @xmath29 cm thick , respectively .",
    "the dielectric fluid used is perfluorooctane , which has a viscosity of @xmath30 mpa@xmath31s and a density of @xmath32 kg / m@xmath33 at 23.0@xmath34c .",
    "the electrolyte fluid is a solution consisting of 60% 1 m copper sulfate solution and 40% glycerol by weight .",
    "the electrolyte s viscosity is @xmath35 mpa@xmath31s and the density is @xmath36 kg / m@xmath33 at 23.0@xmath34c . note that a large viscosity ratio @xmath37 has been chosen to enhance the two - dimensionality of the electrolyte , as described by @xcite .",
    "a small amount of viscosity - matched surfactant is added to the electrolyte to lower the surface tension , and a glass lid is placed on top of the container to limit evaporation .    a direct current , which serves as the control parameter , is then passed through the electrolyte ; the resulting current density @xmath38 ranges from about 10 to 40 a / m@xmath39 across the different runs .",
    "the interaction of this current with the spatially alternating magnetic field @xmath40 results in a spatially alternating lorentz force @xmath41 which drives the electrolyte ( cf .",
    "figure [ expsetup ] ( a ) ) .",
    "the viscous coupling between the electrolyte and the dielectric fluids sets the dielectric fluid in motion as well .",
    "since passing a current through a resistive conductor ( the electrolyte ) results in joule heating , a calibrated thermistor is placed in the corner of the fluid domain to monitor the fluid temperature , and the aluminum plate is immersed in a temperature - controlled water bath .",
    "the water bath is regulated such that the temperature of the electrolyte is maintained to @xmath42c . by limiting the temperature fluctuations ,",
    "the associated change in viscosity of the fluids is kept to a minimum .    for flow visualization ,",
    "we add hollow glass microspheres ( glass bubbles k15 ) manufactured by 3 m , sieved to obtain particles with mean radius @xmath43 @xmath44 m and mean density @xmath45 kg / m@xmath33 . being lighter than the electrolyte , the microspheres stay afloat at the electrolyte - air interface for the duration of the experiment .",
    "the microspheres are illuminated with white light emitting diodes placed near the end walls , outside the container holding the fluids .",
    "the flow is imaged at 15 hz with a dmk 31bu03 camera manufactured by the imaging source , placed directly above the setup .",
    "this camera has a ccd sensor with a resolution of 1024 @xmath19 768 pixels , which results in an adequate resolution of about 53 pixels per magnet width .",
    "the flow velocities are calculated using the prana particle image velocimetry ( piv ) package @xcite .",
    "this software employs a multigrid piv algorithm that deforms images to better resolve flows with high shear .",
    "the velocity field is resolved on a 169 @xmath19 126 grid , with about 9 points per magnet width .    for the experimental measurements listed above , we obtain @xcite the following depth - averaged values for the parameters in equation ( [ eq:2dns_mod ] ) : @xmath46 s@xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 m@xmath39/s .",
    "the complexity of the flow in both the experiment and simulation is characterized by the reynolds number , which we define as : @xmath50 where @xmath51 cm is the width of one magnet and @xmath52 is the measured root - mean - square ( rms ) velocity , where @xmath53 denotes spatial averaging over a sub - region with dimensions 10.16 cm @xmath19 10.16 cm at the centre of the magnet array .",
    "note that from this point on , unless noted otherwise , the characteristic length scale @xmath54 , velocity scale @xmath55 , and time scale @xmath56 will be used for nondimensionalization .",
    "in this section we present a model of the magnetic field generated by the finite array of permanent magnets in the experiment .",
    "we then introduce three types of boundary conditions used in our numerical simulations of the flow .      in the discussion",
    "so far , we have not addressed an important question of how the 2d forcing function @xmath57 in equation ( [ eq:2dns_mod ] ) relates to the 3d forcing @xmath41 in the experiment . for a kolmogorov flow ,",
    "the forcing @xmath57 is sinusoidal , by definition .",
    "however , for kolmogorov - like flows realized in electromagnetically driven shallow layers of electrolyte , @xmath57 needs to be computed from the 3d lorentz force * f * arising from the interaction of the magnetic field @xmath40 produced by a finite magnet array with a current density @xmath58 @xcite .",
    "the current density is easily calculated from geometrical considerations , but the magnetic field generated by the array of permanent magnets is quite complicated . for @xmath59 , the lorentz force density at any location @xmath60 within the electrolyte layer",
    "is given by @xmath61 .",
    "here , @xmath62 and @xmath63 are the @xmath0- and @xmath11-components of the magnetic field , respectively , which vary along all three coordinates @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath11 .",
    "experimental measurements show that the typical value of @xmath62 is less than 3% of the value of @xmath63 at any given location within the electrolyte .",
    "furthermore , the vertical component of the lorentz force along with the gravitational force will be balanced by the vertical gradient of the pressure .",
    "hence , the lorenz force density for all practical purposes can be approximated as @xmath64 .",
    "one can then compute @xmath57 using the expression : @xmath65 where @xmath66 and @xmath67 are the thicknesses of the electrolyte and dielectric layers , respectively , while @xmath9 is the depth - averaged density @xcite .",
    "+    the black symbols in figure [ fig : mag_prof ] ( a ) show the experimental measurements of @xmath63 along the line @xmath68 , passing above the centre of the magnet array at two different heights .",
    "clearly , the magnetic field profile deviates significantly from that of a pure sinusoid .",
    "furthermore , one can not ignore the fringe fields near the edges of the array . to obtain a magnetic field profile that closely resembles the one in the experiment , one could measure the @xmath11-component of the magnetic field ( @xmath63 ) across the entire flow domain at various heights above the magnet array . using the measured field , one",
    "could then compute the depth - averaged forcing profile using equation ( [ eq : depth_averaging ] ) @xcite .",
    "however , since measuring @xmath63 on a 3d grid is an extremely tedious process , we circumvent the labour by numerically modelling the magnet array as described below .",
    "the magnets in the array are arranged such that adjacent ones have magnetization pointing in opposite directions , along @xmath69 . to obtain a magnetic field that closely resembles the one due to this array , we model each magnet as a 3d cubic lattice of identical dipoles , each with a moment @xmath70 .",
    "changing the sign of @xmath71 across adjacent magnets accounts for the alternating direction of magnetization . the magnetic field at any location @xmath60 above the array",
    "is then approximated using the linear superposition of the field contribution from all of the dipoles modelling the array .",
    "hence , we refer to this model as the `` dipole summation . ''",
    "since the strength of the dipole @xmath71 can not be measured experimentally , a single scaling parameter is calculated from a least - squares fit with the experimental measurements , taken at two heights .",
    "the rescaled dipole summation magnetic field is shown in figure [ fig : mag_prof ] ( a ) ( red lines ) , along with the experimental measurements of @xmath63 ( black symbols ) , corresponding to the line @xmath72 at heights @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "figure [ fig : mag_prof ] ( b ) shows the magnetic field comparison at @xmath74 along the magnet centrelines .",
    "note that the electrolyte layer in the experiment is bounded by the planes @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "hence , we compute the magnetic field @xmath77 using the dipole summation at various heights , in steps of @xmath78 , in the region @xmath79 and depth - average it using a discrete version of the expression ( [ eq : depth_averaging ] ) .      in the experimental kolmogorov - like flow ,",
    "vertical solid walls serve as the lateral boundaries , resulting in a no - slip boundary condition .",
    "however , for reasons of analytical and computational feasibility , kolmogorov flow has been studied almost exclusively using unbounded or periodic domains .",
    "neither an infinite lateral extent nor periodicity offer a realistic representation of the effect of boundary conditions in the experiment , as far as the flow s structure and its stability are concerned . to explore the role of boundaries ,",
    "we compare the experiment to numerical simulations using computational domains with increasing degrees of confinement .",
    "the three different computational domains we study are described below .",
    "* doubly - periodic domain : this computational domain is chosen to coincide with the central @xmath80 region of the experimental domain ( @xmath81 and @xmath82 in nondimensional units ) . the simulated flow is constrained to be periodic in both the longitudinal and transverse directions , i.e. , @xmath83 and @xmath84 . along the transverse direction it spans a width equaling that of @xmath85 magnets .",
    "the 2d forcing profile @xmath86 over this doubly - periodic domain is constructed from the depth - averaged magnetic field presented in  [ sec : dipole ] by retaining only the two dominant fourier modes , @xmath87 and @xmath88 , along the @xmath1-direction , where @xmath89 in dimensionless units . along the @xmath0-direction",
    "the profile is uniform : @xmath90 .",
    "* singly - periodic domain : this computational domain coincides with the region @xmath91 and @xmath82 . the longitudinal dimension is the same as that of the experiment , while the transverse one spans a width equaling that of 8 magnets , like in the doubly - periodic domain .",

    "the 2d forcing profile @xmath94 over this singly - periodic domain is constructed as a product of two one - dimensional profiles @xmath95 . along the @xmath1-direction",
    "the profile is once again constructed by retaining only two dominant fourier modes of the depth - averaged magnetic field , @xmath96 . along the @xmath0-direction",
    "the profile @xmath97 is chosen to be the depth - averaged magnetic field profile from the dipole summation along the magnet centreline @xmath98 .",
    "we note that the effect of transverse confinement has been studied by @xcite , and therefore is not investigated here separately . *",
    "non - periodic domain : this computational domain is identical to the experimental one in both lateral dimensions , i.e. , @xmath91 and @xmath99 , with no - slip boundary conditions imposed at both the end walls and side walls , i.e. , @xmath92 and @xmath100 . as mentioned in  [ sec : dipole ] , the forcing over this domain is computed by depth - averaging the dipole summation .    to compare the experimental observations with those predicted by equation ( [ eq:2dns_mod ] ) with the three types of boundary conditions described above , we have performed direct numerical simulations . the flow over the doubly - periodic domain is simulated using a pseudo - spectral method in the vorticity - stream function formulation , as described in @xcite .",

    "in this section we present the results of our comparison between the experiment and the numerical simulations on the three domains described above .",
    "first , we discuss the straight uniform flow found at lower reynolds numbers , with a special emphasis on the effect of boundaries .",
    "we then perform linear stability analysis to demonstrate that equation ( [ eq:2dns_mod ] ) describes the primary instability more accurately than equation ( [ eq:2dns_wf ] ) on an unbounded domain , but still substantially underpredicts the experimentally observed critical reynolds number .",
    "next , we describe and compare the steady flow states found in the experiments and simulations above the primary instability . finally , we discuss the secondary instability which gives rise to a time - periodic flow .",

    "the largest discrepancy , which is 0.46 ( a 10% relative error ) , occurs around @xmath152 .",
    "the slight difference in the flow patterns in the nps and the experiment is partially due to the deviation of the latter from being perfectly q2d .",

    "figures [ fig : bif1_vary_params ] ( a ) and ( b ) show that the variation of parameters has a fairly weak effect on both the amplitude of the modulation and the wavelength of the pattern , suggesting that the disagreement between the simulation and experiment is primarily due to the deviation of the flow and/or forcing from two - dimensionality .",
    "note that for consistency , in both experiment and numerics , we use the same ( depth - averaged ) value of @xmath10 in the definition of the reynolds number , regardless of the actual value of @xmath10 used in the simulation .",
    "if experimental and numerical values of @xmath139 match according to this definition , they will also match if any other value of @xmath10 is used to define @xmath139 in _ both _ experiment and numerics .",
    "while one can also choose to adjust @xmath17 , @xmath10 , and @xmath13 simultaneously to better match the results of simulation and experiment , it is more instructive to study relation between these parameters and different physical mechanisms in the experiment they model . to begin with",
    ", @xmath17 controls the strength of the non - dissipative advection term and models the effect of the inherent three - dimensionality in suppressing the nonlinearity . a simple scaling argument ( cf .",

    "since @xmath171 , this calculation predicts that , as @xmath139 increases beyond @xmath153 , @xmath17 should indeed decrease and @xmath10 should increase , compared with their depth - averaged values computed for the straight flow .",
    "the change in @xmath13 is more subtle , however .",
    "the prediction based on depth - averaging assumes that the flow is strictly horizontal , so viscosity is the only transport mechanism that can carry momentum across the dielectric layer .",
    "in fact , the vertical velocity is not vanishingly small and when the viscosity of the dielectric layer becomes small , advection due to the vertical component of the flow becomes a dominant transport mechanism .",
    "this leads to an effective increase in @xmath13 that can not be properly described using the expression which is based on the approximation .",
    "as we increase the forcing further , the modulated flow in the experiment becomes unstable at @xmath172 giving way to a time - periodic flow with a period @xmath173 ( @xmath174 s in dimensional units ) at onset .",
    "the modulated state in the nps , with the depth - averaged as well as the adjusted parameters , undergoes a hopf bifurcation as the forcing is increased .",

    "while separately modifying @xmath10 , @xmath13 , and @xmath17 shows some improvement in matching either @xmath175 or @xmath176 , the above results demonstrate the necessity of modifying _ all _ the model parameters simultaneously to match _ both _ @xmath175 and @xmath176 .",
    "this , as discussed in the previous section , is a consequence of the dependence of all parameters on the average wavelength of the pattern which changes between the primary and secondary instabilities .",
    "hence , a different set of parameters is required to describe the two instabilities and , more generally , there is no universal set of parameters @xmath17 , @xmath10 , and @xmath13 that correctly describes the experimental flow at all @xmath139 .",
    "in this article , we have presented a combined experimental and numerical study of bifurcations in a q2d kolmogorov - like flow .",
    "this flow is realized in the laboratory by electromagnetically driving a stratified layer of electrolyte above an immiscible layer of dielectric .",
    "this q2d flow is described using a 2d model derived from first principles by depth - averaging the 3d navier - stokes equation .",
    "in contrast , virtually all previous studies have modelled q2d flows using equation ( [ eq:2dns_wf ] ) , a semi - empirical variation of the 2d navier - stokes equation with the addition of a linear friction . also unlike previous studies of kolmogorov - like flows which have assumed a perfectly sinusoidal forcing profile ,",
    "we have introduced a realistic model of the forcing which has been validated against 3d experimental measurements .    to test the importance of lateral confinement ,",
    "we have compared experimental measurements with numerical simulations using different boundary conditions .",
    "we have found that by incorporating realistic , no - slip boundary conditions at all lateral boundaries and a realistic forcing profile , quantitative agreement between the experiment and simulation can be achieved with no adjustable parameters . in particular , the reynolds number @xmath153 for the primary instability can be predicted to within about 5% and the critical wavenumber @xmath178 can be predicted to an accuracy higher than the measurement accuracy .",
    "these are significant improvements compared with previous studies , none of which were able to predict both @xmath153 and @xmath178 with this level of accuracy , _ despite using adjustable parameters_. furthermore , we have demonstrated that the model reasonably accurately predicts the modulated flow pattern ( both the wavenumber and the amplitude ) beyond the onset of the primary instability .",
    "moreover , this is the first study , experimental or theoretical , to provide a quantitative analysis of the secondary instability of a kolmogorov - like flow which generates a time - dependent pattern of vortices . even for the secondary instability the numerical predictions of the critical reynolds number @xmath175 and the critical period @xmath176 are in general agreement with the experiment ,",
    "although the accuracy of the numerical predictions decreases with increasing @xmath139 .",
    "the discrepancy between the numerical predictions and experiments has been traced back to two factors : ( 1 ) the dependence of the parameters of the 2d model on the average wavenumber of the flow pattern , which in turn depends on the reynolds number , and ( 2 ) the variation of the forcing profile with height .",
    "both of these issues point to the limitations of the 2d model of what in reality is a 3d flow , albeit with a strongly suppressed vertical component of the velocity .",
    "nonetheless , for a select range of @xmath139 the experimental flow can be reproduced with extremely good quantitative accuracy by making fairly small adjustments to the model parameters , compared with their depth - average values computed for a simple straight flow .",
    "the ability of the model to closely reproduce the experimental flow is crucial for the utility of q2d flows for testing the geometrical description of weakly turbulent flows and studying the dynamical role of exact coherent structures .",

    "experimental measurements of magnetic field from previous studies have shown such changes in the shape of the field profile as a function of @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "this is very much the case in our experiment as well , as can be seen from the magnetic field profiles shown in figure [ fig : mag_prof ] ( a ) .",

    "the above analysis shows that , although the nps with the depth - averaged magnetic field profile captures the salient features of the dynamics fairly well , the flow pattern depends fairly sensitively on the details of the forcing .",
    "hence , one should expect systematic deviations between the 2d model derived for a q2d flow and the experiment where quasi - two - dimensionality is broken by the forcing .",
    "it should be mentioned that the wavelength of the modulated flow measured by either seeding the dielectric - electrolyte interface or the top surface of the electrolyte are virtually identical .",
    "this implies that viscous coupling across the fluid layers produces a q2d flow despite the fact that forcing profile driving the flow is not perfectly q2d .",
    "an important consequence of bounding the flow in the longitudinal or transverse directions is that we restrict the set of coordinate transformations that leave the governing equation ( [ eq:2dns_mod ] ) equivariant .",

    "we discuss the symmetries implicit in the dps , sps , and nps , as well as the relations between their solutions corresponding to the modulated flow .    on an unbounded or a doubly - periodic domain , equation ( [ eq:2dns_mod ] ) is equivariant under the following symmetry operations : ( a ) continuous translations in @xmath0 : @xmath243 , where @xmath244 is an arbitrary translation along the longitudinal direction , ( b ) reflection in @xmath0 combined with a discrete shift of half a period in @xmath1 : @xmath245 , and ( c ) reflections in both @xmath0 and @xmath1 : @xmath246 .",
    "the reflection @xmath247 is equivalent to a rotation by angle @xmath248 about the @xmath11-axis , while the square of the symmetry operation @xmath249 corresponds to a discrete shift @xmath250 in the @xmath1-direction , i.e. @xmath251 .",
    "these transformations that leave the governing equation equivariant , however , need not leave the flow fields invariant .",
    "when a flow field does not share a certain symmetry of the governing equation , one can generate  by applying the corresponding coordinate transformation  a dynamically equivalent symmetry - related copy of the flow .",
    "for example , the straight flow in figure [ fig : str_flow ] ( a ) remains unchanged when an arbitrary translation @xmath252 $ ] is applied along the @xmath0-direction , so there is a unique straight flow solution .",

    "they are related by discrete translations @xmath257 with @xmath258 : @xmath259 , @xmath260 , and @xmath261 .",
    "the equivariance of the governing equation under @xmath257 with arbitary @xmath244 makes the choice of the coordinate origin @xmath72 for the modulated flow arbitrary .",
    "we fix it by requiring that @xmath262 . since both the discrete symmetries @xmath247 and @xmath249 include reflection of the flow about the line @xmath72 , the choice of the origin determines whether a particular solution remains invariant under either of these discrete symmetries .",
    "in particular , @xmath253 and @xmath255 are invariant under @xmath247 , while @xmath254 and @xmath256 are invariant under @xmath249 . in summary , the equivariant pitchfork bifurcation in the dps , by virtue of the continuous translational symmetry of the governing equation ,",
    "generates an infinite number of branches for the modulated flow .",
    "only four of these branches remain invariant under discrete symmetries @xmath247 or @xmath249 .",
    "the no - slip boundary condition at @xmath263 in the sps destroys the equivariance under translation @xmath257 .",
    "the governing equation , however , still remains equivariant under each of the discrete transformations @xmath249 and @xmath247 .",
    "the modulated flow solutions of the sps respect only one of these two symmetries , so we find two pairs of distinct solutions , as figure [ fig : sym_copies_sps ] illustrates . just like in the dps , @xmath253 and @xmath255 are invariant under @xmath247 , while @xmath254 and @xmath256 are invariant under @xmath249 . unlike dps , where @xmath257 relates all the distinct solutions corresponding to the modulated flow ( cf .",
    "figure [ fig : sym_copies_dps ] ) , there is no coordinate transformation that maps @xmath253 and @xmath255 to @xmath254 and @xmath256 .",
    "however , @xmath264 and @xmath265 . on an infinite domain ,",
    "all four branches of the modulated flow are created at exactly the same @xmath139 ( as in dps ) , however , on a finite domain , the pitchfork bifurcations that produce the two pairs of solutions would generally happen at different @xmath139 , which depend on @xmath266 and @xmath267 ( cf .",
    "figure [ fig : pitchfork ] ( b ) ) .",
    "in particular , spatial confinement in the @xmath1 direction should suppress the instability which gives rise to @xmath254 and @xmath256 , pushing the corresponding bifurcation to higher @xmath139 . on the other hand , @xmath253 and @xmath255",
    "should be less sensitive to the effect of confinement , and hence should appear at a lower value of @xmath139 for finite @xmath266 .",
    "the no - slip boundary condition at @xmath268 in the nps breaks the equivariance of the problem under @xmath269 , leaving the governing equation equivariant only under @xmath247 . since @xmath269 underlies the pitchfork bifurcation that gives rise to the solutions @xmath253 and @xmath255 in the sps , when this symmetry is broken , one finds an imperfect pitchfork bifurcation , as shown in figure [ fig : pitchfork ] ( c ) , with the straight flow @xmath270 at lower @xmath139 smoothly transitioning to the modulated flow @xmath253 at higher @xmath139 without an instability taking place , in perfect agreement with the results of our numerical simulations .",
    "the @xmath255 branch and the higher-@xmath139 branch of the straight flow @xmath271 are now created in a saddle - node bifurcation at @xmath272 .",
    "the states @xmath253 and @xmath255 , both of which are symmetric with respect to @xmath247 , are shown in figure [ fig : sym_copies_nps ] .",
    "while @xmath269 is no longer an exact symmetry in nps , given the large transverse extent of the domain compared with the period of the forcing ( @xmath273 = 9 ) , near the center of the domain this approximate symmetry holds and consequently @xmath274 .",
    "however , unlike @xmath253 , which remains stable up to @xmath275 in the nps , @xmath276 is unstable over the entire range of @xmath139 where it exists ( @xmath277 ) .",
    "this explains why our numerical simulations starting from randomized initial conditions have always converged to the modulated flow @xmath253 and why @xmath255 was never found in the numerical simulations or observed in the experiment .",
    "the pitchfork bifurcation which gave rise to the branches @xmath254 and @xmath256 in the sps also does not carry over into the nps .",
    "instead both @xmath271 and @xmath255 undergo hopf bifurcations , respectively , at @xmath278 and @xmath279 .",
    "this change in the nature of the bifurcation is likely caused by transverse confinement , which has a more prominent effect on @xmath254 and @xmath256 : these states are invariant under the @xmath249 symmetry in the sps , but this symmetry is broken in the nps . while we fail to observe @xmath254 and @xmath256 in the nps , the analogues of these solutions may appear for different model parameters , forcing profile , and/or the degree of confinement .",
