    "the issue of universality classes in nonequilibrium statistical systems is often linked to the existence of conservation laws [ ] . normally , the number of conservation laws is finite , leading to the occurrence of dynamically disjoint sectors whose number grows as a power of the system size . however , certain dynamical processes involving composite objects exhibit strongly broken ergodicity , with the number of disjoint sectors growing exponentially with system size , as a result of having an extensive number of conservation laws .",
    "examples studied earlier include deposition and evaporation ( @xmath0 ) [ ] , and diffusion ( @xmath1 ) [ ] of bunches of particles .",
    "if these moves are interpreted as involving trimers or dimers ( in general @xmath2-mers ) , then the @xmath2-mers in question do not keep their identity , and can reconstitute in time .",
    "the dynamical moves in these models do not connect configurations in different sectors , implying that the steady state is not unique and depends strongly on the initial condition .",
    "moreover , the form of the long - time decay of time - dependent correlations in the steady state varies strongly from one sector to another . in one dimension , both the partitioning of phase space into many sectors and the accompanying dynamical diversity",
    "could be understood in terms of a nonlocal construct known as the irreducible string ( is ) which is an invariant of the motion .",
    "the is provided a convenient label for each sector [ ] . moreover ,",
    "the position of the elements of the is were the relevant ` slow ' variables in the problem , and thus governed the long time dynamics in different sectors .",
    "the dynamical diversity found in different sectors ( ranging from different power law decays to stretched exponentials ) could be accounted for in terms of the differences in the is from sector to sector [ ] . in turn , the is can be used to construct an extensive number of conservation laws , although it turns out that these involve nonlocal combinations of the site occupancies [ ] .",
    "all such studies known to us involve a symmetric movement of the is .",
    "here we study the dynamical consequences of an asymmetric ( directed ) motion of the is .",
    "this brings in new phenomena associated with driven diffusive systems , such as kinematic waves and effects of the kardar parisi zhang ( kpz)/burgers nonlinearity , present in the 1-@xmath3 asymmetric simple exclusion process ( asep ) [ ] .",
    "we investigate these effects by studying the directed diffusion of reconstituting dimers ( ddrd ) .",
    "the model resembles the diffusing reconstituting dimer model studied in ref .",
    "[ ] , the only difference being that we allow for only forward motion of the dimers ( @xmath4 ) , in contrast to the two - way motion studied in that paper .",
    "the construction of the is is the same for symmetric / asymmetric motion , but the dynamics of dimers ( and of the is ) is quite different in the directed case .",
    "it turns out that there is a correspondence between the ddrd and the well - studied asep , though of a generalised sort , leading to extra features including additional wheeling motion of sites , oscillations of correlation functions , and other new kinetic effects .",
    "these typically result from the combination of collective driving and the invariant , but moving , is .",
    "interestingly , there is a very useful correspondence between the ddrd and a three - species exclusion process .",
    "further , the problem of forward - moving non - reconstituting ( hard ) dimers which keep their identity is recovered in the ddrd , in a particular sector .    as in the previous studies of dynamic diversity ,",
    "monte carlo ( mc ) simulation is a key ingredient in trying to understand the dynamics .",
    "in particular we study time - dependent correlation functions in different sectors and use analytic reductions related to the specific form of the is and the motion of its elements to correlate the diverse behaviour seen in the simulations with properties of the asep .",
    "remarkably close correspondences in nonuniversal as well as scaling properties are seen .",
    "the development begins ( section 2 ) with an introduction to the model and then moves on in the same section to the following sequence of emerging topics : equivalence to the three - species process and correspondences with the asep , whose properties are summarized . in section 3",
    "we study the kinetics within a particularly simple sector in which the problem is tantamount to that of non - reconstituting dimers . new effects such as wheeling of sites in the equivalent asep , resulting from the combination of driving and the composition of dimers , are shown to have important consequences for autocorrelation functions .",
    "these show early oscillations and later a decay , whose form ( exponential or power law ) , is decided by a critical condition related to wheeling and kinematic wave velocities .",
    "the long time behaviour shows scaling , and universality in the sense of data collapse to asep scaling functions , but with sector - specific parameters .",
    "the theoretical and mc results are extended to more general sectors in section 4 , via investigations of sublattice currents , sublattice current - density relations , and consequent kinematic wave velocities .",
    "section 5 is mainly concerned with spatial correlations in a particular sector , involving mc results and their exact analysis via one of the equivalent models .",
    "section 6 is a concluding discussion .",
    "the ddrd model consists of a ring of @xmath5 sites , each of which may be singly occupied ( occupation variable @xmath6 ) or empty ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "any of the @xmath8 possible configurations is then an @xmath5-bit binary string .",
    "the system evolves stochastically through the move @xmath9 , which represents the directed diffusion ( rightward hopping ) , of reconstituting dimers ( ddrd ) .",
    "this is equivalent to stochastic hopping of holes two steps to the left ( i.e. staying on the same sublattice ) provided the intervening site is occupied .",
    "the process is the totally asymmetric alternative to the fully symmetric reconstituting dimer diffusion process ( drd ) [ ] which is known to be strongly nonergodic due to the existence of a conserved string of variables , the is .",
    "all states linked by the dynamic process have the same is , so the phase space divides into many sectors , @xmath10 in number , where @xmath11 is the golden number ( @xmath12 . all these properties are shared by the asymmetric generalisations .",
    "the is for a given sector can be obtained from any state in the sector by deleting from its @xmath5-bit string any pair of adjacent @xmath13 s , and repeating the procedure until no more deletions are possible ( the result is independent of the order of deletion ) .",
    "for instance , the configuration @xmath14 leads to the is @xmath15 .    an equivalent representation of configurations , of the is , and of the process , uses characters @xmath16 related to the binary variables by @xmath17 [ ] . with the periodic boundary conditions used here any ddrd configuration",
    "can be uniquely decomposed into a configuration of @xmath18 s , @xmath19 s , and @xmath20 s .",
    "for example , the configuration @xmath21 of the last paragraph can be written as @xmath22 . moreover",
    ", the totally asymmetric dimer hopping move @xmath9 corresponds to either @xmath23 , or @xmath24 ; the former move involves dimer reconstitution .",
    "the is construction now corresponds to deletion of all @xmath18 s , so the is is a string of only @xmath19 s and @xmath20 s , e.g. for the configuration @xmath21 defined above the is is @xmath25 . the absence of any exchange of @xmath19 s and @xmath20 s in the ddrd process verifies the conservation of the is .    in terms of the characters @xmath16 ,",
    "the ddrd process has an obvious and important analogy with the ( totally ) asymmetric exclusion process ( asep ) , in which mutually excluding particles hop to nearest neighbour vacancies on the right . in this correspondence",
    "the dimers @xmath18 play the role of the asep particle , and the @xmath19 s , and @xmath20 s of the is correspond to asep vacancies . in order to exploit the correspondence here and later",
    ", we use @xmath26 to denote the numbers of dimers , 10 pairs , and single 0 s , respectively .",
    "then the lengths of the ddrd lattice , the is , and the asep lattice are @xmath27 , and @xmath28 , respectively .",
    "the particle density in the asep is @xmath29 , and the fraction of zeros of c type is @xmath30 .",
    "then , in the case of a periodic is , if the periodic unit [ ... ] of the is contains @xmath31 @xmath19 s and @xmath32 @xmath20 s , we have @xmath33 .",
    "it is straightforward to show from these definitions that @xmath34 .",
    "this ratio provides a metric factor particularly important for converting known currents , tagged hole velocities , and particle densities for the asep into corresponding ddrd quantities .",
    "an important point is that the asep image of a fixed ddrd site is not fixed , but moves forward and wheels around the periodic ring .",
    "the causes and consequences of wheeling are discussed in detail in section 3 .",
    "we conclude the section by recalling some facts about the asep that we will need later . on a ring",
    ", the asep has a product - measure uniform steady state ( ss ) , with current @xmath35 at asep particle density @xmath36 .",
    "density fluctuations move as a kinematic wave through the system [ ] , with velocity @xmath37 .",
    "also , in the long time scaling regime , the asep density - density correlation function @xmath38 is of the form @xmath39 it is known [ eq.(4.8 ) of [ ] ] that in the limit of large @xmath40 , @xmath41 with @xmath42 , so the correlation function is exponentially decaying in time at large time @xmath43 .",
    "the exception is when the co - moving condition @xmath44 applies , a special case being the autocorrelation function ( @xmath45 ) when @xmath46 ( making @xmath47 ) . in these cases",
    "the correlation function shows @xmath48 power law decay in time .    in view of the ddrd - asep correspondence",
    ", one might expect similar behaviour for asymmetrically diffusing dimers , unlike symmetrically diffusing dimers of ref .",
    "[ ] , where power law decay is always seen .",
    "detailed considerations of the correspondence show that the results are broadly in agreement with these expectations , but modified by a variety of interesting extra features discussed below .",
    "we denote a sector whose is contains no @xmath19 elements as a null sector . in terms of the notation introduced earlier",
    ", this refers to @xmath49^{{\\cal l}}$ ] with @xmath50 and @xmath51 . in any such sector , the ddrd with an even number of particles is isomorphic to directed diffusion of nonreconstituting or ` hard ' dimers .",
    "the reason is that every cluster of 1 s must contain an even number of particles ( otherwise the is would not be all @xmath52 s ) , and hence a cluster can be labeled as @xmath53 , with a @xmath54 at the start and @xmath55 at the end .",
    "each successive @xmath56 pair can be thought of as a dimer , which retains its identity forever : the elementary move @xmath9 is @xmath57 .",
    "the problem of nonreconstituting hard dimers ( and more generally @xmath2-mers ) is of interest in several contexts , and some aspects have been studied earlier [ ] .",
    "this isomorphism allows us to obtain the correlation function for the reconstituting dimer problem , in the special case of the null sector , from the derivation given in section 5 for the non - reconstituting case .",
    "we now summarize the results for dynamic properties of interest in null sectors",
    ". a more detailed account will appear in [ ] . by following the motion of a hole in the ddrd and its image in the asep , we find that the ratio of the currents @xmath58 ( for ddrd ) , and @xmath59 is equal to the metric factor @xmath60 .",
    "evidently , we then have @xmath61 .    0.3 cm _ . _",
    "an important effect shows up in a more detailed consideration of the mapping between sites in the asep and in the ddrd .",
    "a fixed site in the ddrd problem corresponds to a moving site in the asep ",
    "it wheels around the ring at a finite mean velocity .",
    "this happens because if we follow the asep image of a single jump @xmath9 in the ddrd , we find that the image of the central site of the triplet advances by one unit , while the images of the other two sites remain unchanged . in time",
    "@xmath43 , the displacement of a mapped site is thus @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the wheeling velocity and @xmath64 is a zero - mean variable which represents the effect of stochasticity in the motion . it can be shown [ ] that in the null sector , the wheeling velocity is given by @xmath65 the wheeling motion of asep sites has been verified by direct observation of mapped site motion in mc simulations , which shows a small jitter corresponding to @xmath64 around the predicted average wheeling velocity",
    ".    0.3 cm _ . _",
    "the considerations of the previous paragraph have important consequences for the ddrd : correlation functions are like those of the asep only if wheeling of sites ( @xmath66 ) is allowed for .",
    "this suggests that in the long time scaling regime , if the effects of jitter arising from the stochastic part @xmath64 can be ignored , the density - density correlation function @xmath67 of the ddrd in the null sector will be of the form @xmath68 \\ , t^{-2/3}\\,\\big)\\,.\\ ] ] for the autocorrelation function ( @xmath45 ) the argument of @xmath69 is proportional to the difference of the wheeling velocity and the kinematic wave speed @xmath70 of the asep , @xmath71 .",
    "then , if @xmath69 is similar to the scaling function @xmath72 of the asep , the autocorrelation function @xmath73 of the null sector will decay as @xmath74 at large times , where @xmath75 is a constant proportional to @xmath76 . on the other hand , in the special case where @xmath76 vanishes , late - time slower - than - exponential decay",
    "should be expected , that is @xmath77 where @xmath78 falls slowly , e.g. approaching a constant .",
    "notice that @xmath76 vanishes at the ` compensating ' value @xmath79 of the asep particle concentration given by @xmath80 which would correspond to an is @xmath49^{\\cal l}\\,$ ] of length @xmath81",
    ".    0.3 cm _ . _ to support these expectations , we have conducted extensive simulations of forward - diffusing , reconstituting dimers in a variety of situations . since autocorrelation functions of interest",
    "refer to spontaneous fluctuations in steady state ( ss ) , we avoided the relaxation of the system by generating directly ss configurations , thus saving considerable cpu time . in the equivalent asep , all configurations in ss are equally weighted under periodic boundary conditions and can be translated to ddrd configurations .",
    "this enables us to average our measurements over a large number of samples to reduce scatter in the data .    in null sectors with",
    "is of length @xmath82 , such initial conditions are obtained by random deposition of @xmath83 monomers on a ring of @xmath84 sites .",
    "subsequently , each monomer is duplicated by adding another one over an extra adjacent location specially added for that purpose , i.e. @xmath85 , which leave us with a ring of @xmath5 sites and @xmath86 randomly distributed dimers .",
    "notice that this generating procedure is not equivalent to a random sequential adsorption of dimers in the original system . had the latter method been applied it would necessarily introduce correlations between dimers because of shielding effects among them [ ] .",
    "we then evolved our ddrd system using the stochastic microscopic rules referred to above .",
    "after a sequence of @xmath5 update attempts at random locations , the time scale is increased by one unit , i.e. @xmath87 , irrespective of these attempts being successful . also , measurements at shorter ( longer ) time intervals can also be allowed by updating the system in @xmath88 @xmath89 microsteps , and increasing @xmath43 as @xmath90 . typically , we considered rings of @xmath91 sites and averaged our measurements over @xmath92 histories starting from the independent configurations constructed above . in fig.[s0.ps ]",
    "we show the resulting autocorrelation functions for various particle densities @xmath93 in null sectors of length @xmath94 , or equivalently , at different concentrations @xmath95 of the associated asep system .",
    "the full line corresponds to the compensating condition @xmath96 , thus making @xmath97 , and is the case where slower than exponential decay is seen .",
    "specifically , it is consistent with a large time behavior @xmath98 , in turn suggesting that the slow decaying function @xmath99 referred to after eq .",
    "( 3 ) approaches a constant at large @xmath43 .",
    "this is in marked contrast to all other is fractions studied which always give rise to exponential decays , either below or above @xmath79 .",
    "this constitutes a strong confirmation of the theory .    in preparation for the analysis of ss currents in more general situations",
    "( see section 4 ) , we also estimated numerically these quantities by measuring the three - point correlations involved in the assisted hopping , namely @xmath100 on each of sublattices @xmath13 and @xmath101 , where @xmath102 denotes a vacancy .",
    "as will be discussed below , the compensating condition also corresponds to the vanishing of both current derivatives with respect to particle densities .",
    "the inset of fig.[s0.ps ] displays the currents of sector @xmath49 $ ] ( both equivalent in this case ) , as a function of the particle density ( @xmath103 ) , closely following the @xmath58 current discussed above in this section .",
    "as expected , its extremum occurs very near to @xmath104 namely , close to @xmath105 .",
    "_ the above results would indicate that the long time autocorrelations of the ddrd and asep systems are similar provided that the kinematic wave in each system is stationary . despite the existence of jitter between site locations in the two systems , fig.[asep.ps ]",
    "provides a strong indication that this might be the case provided large times are considered ( @xmath106 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the short - time differences between both systems ( see inset of fig.[asep.ps ] ) can be qualitatively understood by combining wheeling with the equal - time spatial structure , which , as will be discussed in section 5 , has a finite ss correlation length .",
    "moreover , analogues with the asep would suggest attempting a collapse of all the null sector ddrd autocorrelation data at @xmath107 .",
    "fig.[colla.ps ] shows the data collapse for the ddrd autocorrelation @xmath108 at representative @xmath36 s in the null sector , as a plot of @xmath109\\,$ ] versus @xmath110 .",
    "there is a convincing collapse to a line corresponding to @xmath111 versus @xmath112 , where @xmath72 is the asep scaling function [ eq.([scaling ] ) ] in which @xmath113 . as for @xmath114 and @xmath115 , they are fitting parameters which depend on @xmath36 , and their numerical values [ ] closely follow those arising from the analysis of [ ] .",
    "the argument @xmath40 of @xmath116 and the overall prefactor required to give the autocorrelation function for the asep are given on dimensional grounds as functions of @xmath36 in [ ] and [ ] ( in particular , see eqs.(1.3 ) to ( 1.10 ) in [ ] ) , and involve @xmath117 and @xmath118 together with @xmath43 in forms consistent with the scaling variables given in section 2 .",
    "there are also numerical factors , which differ between the two papers . our data collapse for the ddrd yields values for @xmath114 which for most @xmath36 are within 1 per cent of the corresponding theoretical asep values [ ] ; likewise for @xmath115 , except for a persistent difference of a factor of 2 ( possibly owing to the definition of @xmath119 in [ ] ) .",
    "apart from this , the ddrd autocorrelations correspond in every detail to the asep ones except at early times .",
    "the data in fig.[colla.ps ] do not lie in the asymptotic regime where @xmath111 is linear in @xmath112 .",
    "this exponential decay is achieved only for @xmath120 , as displayed in upper inset ; the corresponding times are very large and the autocorrelations too small as to render them numerically accessible by direct simulation .",
    "size dependences are then noticeable unless @xmath121 is large compared to such times , so very large system sizes are required in the mc .",
    "further , the implied large equilibration times mean that for large @xmath5 it would not be feasible to prepare initial states by relaxation . in our simulations , initial states",
    "are obtained via the asep by exploiting its product measure property , as described above .",
    "in non - null sectors , the value of @xmath122 is a measure of reconstitution that occurs in that sector .",
    "we have examined some sectors with periodic is s and find pronounced oscillations in the autocorrelation functions e.g. figs .",
    "4 and 5 correspond to sectors @xmath123^{{\\cal l}/3}$ ] ( @xmath124 ) and @xmath125^{{\\cal l}/3}$ ] ( @xmath126 ) , with is s composed of repeating units @xmath127 and @xmath128 respectively .",
    "the time periods for such periodic sectors are readily calculated , since the oscillations are due to the alternations of 1 s and 0 s arriving at a site .",
    "_ in this new scenario the initial steady configurations were prepared by means of a slight variation of the generating procedure described for null strings ( section 3 ) .",
    "consider for instance the sector @xmath123^{{\\cal l}/3}$ ] .",
    "then , we can identify two types of ` single site holes ' @xmath129 and @xmath130 , within an asep ring of @xmath131 sites over which @xmath132 ` monomers ' ( later on recast as dimers @xmath133 ) , are randomly adsorbed . in going backwards from asep to ddrd",
    ", we first christen the asep vacancies as @xmath19 or @xmath20 , in the order in which they occur in the is .",
    "while reconstructing the ddrd configuration , we expand out the @xmath19 s to be 10 s and let the @xmath20 s be 0 s .",
    "the resulting configuration is updated by our usual stochastic rules .",
    "this was carried out on ddrd rings of @xmath134 sites and averaged typically over @xmath135 independent histories .",
    "particle densities , @xmath136 and @xmath137 , on even and odd sublattices are preserved throughout [ @xmath138 , whereas both autocorrelations and currents were separately computed in each sublattice .",

    "this investigation of the simplest model combining strongly broken ergodicity with driving has uncovered a wealth of properties , some expected and others not foreseen . in particular the model shows an interesting interplay between the collective ( and scaling ) kinetics of the basic driven model ( the asep ) and effects of the invariant is which characterises the sector in the ddrd .",

    "one would then have different decay patterns , according to sector ( ` dynamic diversity ' ) . the combination of the methods developed here with those of ref .",
    "[ ] might well allow analytic treatment of such effects .    changing from periodic boundary conditions to open ones with boundary injection",
    "could strongly alter the behaviour .",

    "density profiles , correlations , and dynamics differ in the different phases .",
    "we would expect all these features to occur in the corresponding boundary - driven version of the ddrd , in cases ( like injection / ejection of dimers ) so long as the injection and ejection processes keep the is in tact .",
    "again , the detailed properties would vary from sector to sector , and the methods used here should prove useful in this generalised situation .",
    "finally , generalisations from reconstituting dimers to @xmath2-mers , deserve consideration . as with dimers , the problem of nonreconstituting @xmath2-mers which is of current interest [ ]",
    "is contained in null sectors of the general problem .",
