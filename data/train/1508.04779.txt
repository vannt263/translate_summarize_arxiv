    "another relevant proposal to study critical systems is the generalization to the continuum  @xcite of the multiscale entanglement renormalization ansatz  @xcite .",
    "applications of cmps to the study of many - body systems directly in the continuum include : ground state properties  @xcite and excitations  @xcite of the lieb - liniger ( ll ) model , free massive dirac fermions  @xcite , the @xmath4-flavor gross - neveu model  @xcite , and two - species of bosonic  @xcite and fermionic  @xcite systems .",

    "inspired by lattice hamiltonian models we will refer to this bosonic system as the extended lieb - liniger ( ell ) model .",
    "we will see below that this extended hamiltonian is a minimal model that captures both the physics of the ll hamiltonian and that of bosons interacting through the screened coulomb potential . when described as a luttinger liquid",
    ", we will show that the luttinger parameter of the extended hamiltonian contains values taken by the corresponding parameter in the cases mentioned above .",
    "this will imply that our extended model displays strongly correlated behavior of both fermionic and bosonic character depending on the values of its parameters .",

    "in this work we will focus on a model of bosonic particles interacting via an exponentially - decaying density - density term in @xmath5 dimensions .",
    "its hamiltonian reads @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 represent bosonic field operators that annihilate and create a particle at point @xmath9 , respectively .",

    "( [ eq : wofq ] ) can not produce the leading order @xmath67 , which is a term necessary to stabilize such a state  @xcite .",
    "we notice as well that numerical calculations have shown that exponential potentials can mimic the general behavior of eq .",
    "( [ eq : wc ] )  @xcite .    to explore some further properties of hamiltonian  ( [ eq : realh ] )",
    ", we introduce the scaling transformation : @xmath68 , for the space coordinate @xmath9 .",

    "such states are not present in the original ll model , for which the ground state is always superfluid .",
    "thirdly , making use of the recently developed cmps techniques we have explored the ground state phase diagram of our system of exponentially - interacting bosons .    by calculating the superfluid and density correlation functions",
    ", we have shown that at weak coupling superfluidity governs the ground state in much the same way as in the ll model . at strong coupling , however ,",
    "superfluidity is strongly suppressed with a simultaneous increase of density correlations , signaling the emergence of the super - tonks - girardeau state . upon increasing",
    "the interaction density correlations dominate the ground state and a quasi - crystal state is stabilized . as noticed above , these additional phases are not present in the original ll hamiltonian .",
    "hence , the decaying exponential potential induces a crossover from superfluid to super - tonks - girardeau to quasi - crystal states , when the interaction strength is varied from weak to strong coupling . finally , resorting to luttinger liquid theory , we have shown that the value of the luttinger parameter ranges in the interval @xmath0 ; thus differing from the values taken by the corresponding quantity of both the ll model , where @xmath156 , and the screened coulomb case , for which @xmath157 .",
