    "the peculiarities due to reflection phenomena are also expected in the case of linear coupling with two phonon modes .",
    "in contrast to the model with coupling to one phonon mode , the oscillations mediated by the antisymmetric mode are nonlinearly coupled to the symmetric phonon mode .",

    "therefore it is reasonable to investigate jt model generalized by breaking the rotational symmetry ( while saving the reflection symmetry ) : we assume different coupling strengths for the onsite ( intralevel ) and interlevel electron - phonon couplings .",
    "such a model can also be considered as a generalization of the exciton - phonon or the dimer - phonon model by assuming the electron tunneling phonon assisted .",
    "jt model with the broken rotational symmetry will involve the coupling of two minima as well as the coupling of the symmetric and antisymmetric phonon modes . in the lattice model , however , in contrast to the local case , the mode correlation appears to be of a marginal importance ( section iii ) . as a consequence ,",
    "our ansatz for the variational wave function of the local model will involve ( i ) the reflection vp introduced by the construction of the two - center phonon wave function , and ( ii ) correlation vp respecting coupling of the symmetric and antisymmetric phonon modes .",

    "much effort was expended also to improve one - center variational approach by including correlations of the concerning two squeezed coherent phonon modes of the jt model .",
    "when compared to the lattice case , the local version of the model provides qualitatively similar effective potential .",
    "this conclusion was to be expected : in the symmetric case minima of the nonlinear effective potential related with two levels are close together and so the quantum fluctuations there are most effective .",
    "we considered both the mixing and squeezing correlation vp in order to find region of relevance of both parameters as functions of the interaction constants .",
