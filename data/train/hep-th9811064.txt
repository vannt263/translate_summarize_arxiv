    "type iib string junctions @xcite , and more generally string webs counterparts .",
    "string webs are composed of several string junctions . ]",
    "@xcite , have proven to be quite useful in determining the bps spectra of supersymmetric field theories , which can be realized as world - volume theories on certain branes [ 310 ] .",
    "the two fundamental properties of string junctions that allow us to learn about the spectrum of bps states is that their total nsns and rr charges vanish @xcite , and that the orientations of the strings are correlated with their @xmath1 type such that the net force on the junction vanishes @xcite . for planar webs , the second property guarantees that the configuration is ( classically ) supersymmetric @xcite .",
    "previously we constructed the bps states of @xmath0 @xmath2 sym using string webs @xcite .",
    "the theory is realized as the world - volume field theory of a 3-brane probe in the background of two mutually non - local 7-branes @xcite , and the bps states correspond to supersymmetric string webs connecting the three branes .",
    "we found string webs corresponding to all the known bps states , _",
    "i.e. _ the @xmath3-bosons and @xmath4 dyons , and were able to explain the discontinuity in the bps spectrum ( `` jumping '' phenomenon ) as a simple process of decay of a string web into a pair of strings .",
    "however , we found additional string webs which did not correspond to known bps states .",
    "we argued that although these webs were classically supersymmetric , they should exhibit some sort of supersymmetry anomaly analogous to the `` s - rule '' @xcite .",
    "the issue was subsequently resolved in @xcite , where a suitable generalization of the s - rule was given , which eliminates all the extra states from the bps spectrum . on the other hand",
    "this raises the question of what these additional string webs correspond to , given that they satisfy the aforementioned fundamental properties .    in a parallel line of development",
    ", certain _ non - perturbative _ stable non - bps states have been identified in string theory @xcite .",
    "in all these examples the existence of the non - perturbative state was predicted by knowledge of a _ perturbative _ stable non - bps state , together with some knowledge of the strong coupling behavior , _",
    "e.g. _ duality .",
    "a notable class of examples is the @xmath5-plane  d@xmath6-brane system , in which the lowest mass charged state is not bps .",
    "the strong coupling behavior is different for each @xmath6 , but in every case there should exist a stable non - bps state .",
    "these have been found so far for @xmath7 and @xmath8 . for @xmath9",
    "the state corresponds to a string web connecting three mutually non - local 7-branes , which describe the strong coupling behavior of the @xmath10d7 system .",
    "the web satisfies the two fundamental properties , but is nevertheless non - bps , as it violates the `` s - rule '' @xcite .",
    "the additional string webs found in @xcite fit nicely into this category of states , and therefore seem to correspond to stable non - bps states in @xmath0 @xmath2 sym . unlike the previous examples however , these non - bps states are not predicted by the perturbative picture . in this paper we shall extend this result , and find even more stable non - bps string webs connecting the 3-brane and the two 7-branes .",
    "furthermore , we will find a second curve of marginal stability @xmath11 ( in addition to the usual one @xmath12 ) , across which some of these webs decay .",
    "this suggests that the moduli space of @xmath0 @xmath2 sym theory is actually divided into _ four _ regions , each of which has a different stable ( but not necessarily bps ) particle spectrum . in the _ semi - classical _ regime , _",
    "i.e. _ outside both curves of marginal stability , the spectrum includes states of arbitrary even electric charge , and _ arbitrary magnetic charge _",
    "( modulo reducibility of the corresponding web ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  2",
    "we review the conditions for a string web to be supersymmetric , and the construction of the bps states in @xmath0 @xmath2 sym . in section  3",
    "we relax the above conditions to incorporate stable , but not necessarily supersymmetric , string webs , and solve for the stable particle spectrum .",
    "section  4 contains our conclusions .",
    "let us first recall how the bps spectrum is derived in the 3-brane probe picture . consider a string web lying in the @xmath13-plane , and ending on @xmath14 @xmath1 7-branes and @xmath15 3-branes , which are transverse to the plane .",
    "denote the charges of the external strings by @xmath16 , where @xmath17 for those ending on 7-branes , and @xmath18 for those ending on 3-branes . and @xmath19 need",
    "not be mutually prime .",
    "however , if @xmath16 have the same common divisor ( @xmath20 ) for all @xmath21 the configuration is reducible , and therefore at most marginally bound . ]",
    "the strings are taken to be oriented outward , and ordered counterclockwise .",
    "we define the _ self - intersection _ number of the web as @xcite _ 1i",
    "< jn+m|    ll p_i & p_j + q_i & q_j     junctions , and the second to the strings ending on 7-branes . to preserve supersymmetry",
    ", the webs must satisfy the following :    1 .",
    "strings lie on trajectories of minimal mass , _ i.e. _ @xmath1-geodesics .",
    "the orientations of the strings are correlated with their @xmath1 type , such that _ p , q(z ) = \\ { + c ( p+q(z ) ) + _ 1,0(z ) +   + ( p+q ) + _ 1,0(z ) + .",
    "[ orient ] these reduce to the zero force condition when applied to the junction points .",
    "the self - intersection number of the web satisfies the following inequality and @xmath22 ) have a self - intersection number @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is identified with the number of co - prime strings not ending on 7-branes . ]",
    "+ -2 + _ i = n+1^n+m ( p_i , q_i ) .",
    "[ jcondition ] in fact , this inequality must be satisfied for each irreducible sub - web , where strings not ending on 7-branes count as strings ending on 3-branes .    conditions * a * and * b * guarantee that the string web preserves supersymmetry at the _ classical _ level . at the _ quantum _ level",
    "there may be supersymmetry anomalies , _",
    "i.e. _ the true ground state of the configuration may break supersymmetry .",
    "the so - called `` s - rule '' @xcite is an example of such an anomaly . for our setup",
    "the statement of the s - rule is that given a @xmath1 7-brane and an @xmath25 string transverse to it , the number of @xmath1 strings that can link the two while still preserving supersymmetry is bounded above by @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "condition * c * is a generalization of this rule .",
    "the background corresponding to pure @xmath2 sym consists of two mutually non - local 7-branes .",
    "using our previous conventions @xcite , the 7-branes are located at @xmath27 and @xmath28 , and their charges are @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively . both branch cuts extend along the negative real axis .",
    "the sign for the second 7-brane is @xmath31 when viewed from above the cut and @xmath32 when viewed from below the cut .",
    "the @xmath1-metric on the transverse plane is given by @xcite t_p , qds = |pda + qda_d| , where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the integrals of the seiberg - witten differential over the two cycles of the auxiliary riemann surface @xcite .",
    "for the purpose of numerical analysis they are best expressed in terms of hypergeometric functions , @xmath35 thus @xmath1-geodesics satisfy the equation p dadt + q da_ddt = ( p+q(z))dadt = c_p , q , [ geodesic ] and their tangents are therefore oriented along _",
    "p , q(z ) = ( p + q ) - ( da / dz ) + ( c_p , q ) .",
    "[ geodesic_tangent ] it is immediately clear that the second equation in ( [ orient ] ) is compatible with ( [ geodesic_tangent ] ) , whereas the first one is not .",
    "this is because the 7-brane background picks out a unique complex structure on the transverse plane , in which only strings oriented according to @xmath36 can be supersymmetric @xcite .",
    "it then follows that conditions * a * and * b * are satisfied if and only if = , [ phases1 ] where @xmath37 is arbitrary .",
    "denote the positions of the @xmath29 7-brane , @xmath30 7-brane , and 3-brane by @xmath38 , and @xmath39 , respectively .",
    "likewise , denote the charges of the strings ending on the branes by @xmath16 , where @xmath40 .",
    "we assume that the string webs are completely _ degenerate _ , _ i.e. _ that all internal strings have a vanishing length , so that there is effectively a single junction point at @xmath41 .",
    "the geodesic constants are therefore given by c_p_i , q_i = p_i(a(z_i)-a(z_0 ) ) + q_i(a_d(z_i)-a_d(z_0 ) ) . [ c ] for the strings ending on 7-branes these simplify since @xmath42 for @xmath43 .",
    "solutions to ( [ phases1 ] ) were found for @xmath44 and @xmath45 , corresponding respectively to the @xmath3-bosons and dyon hypermultiplets .",
    "furthermore , these webs satisfy condition * c * , so the corresponding states are indeed bps saturated . in all cases the solution restricts the junction to lie on the curve defined by = 0 , \\",

    "[ const_phase ] the first curve is well known as the curve of marginal stability @xmath12 , and the second is a curve of constant phase for the function @xmath46 .",
    "the second condition in ( [ const_phase ] ) implies that the 3-brane must lie outside @xmath12 .",
    "thus the string junction picture confirms that , with the exception of the states @xmath29 and @xmath47 , which correspond to single strings , the above bps states exist only outside @xmath12 ( figure  1 ) .",
    "= 2.5 in = 2.5 in",
    "there are actually additional solutions to ( [ phases1 ] ) @xcite . however , as these carry magnetic charges of magnitude greater than @xmath48 , they can easily be shown to violate condition * c * @xcite .",
    "they do not therefore correspond to bps states . on the other hand ,",
    "the fact that they satisfy conditions * a * and * b * suggests that they are stable string webs , and therefore that we identify them as stable non - bps states in the field theory .    more generally , classical stability of a string web requires only that all the forces cancel .",
    "this means that for stable ( but not necessarily supersymmetric ) string webs condition * b * is replaced by :    b. : :    the orientations of the strings _ at the junctions _ satisfy _",
    "p , q(z_0 ) =    \\ {    +    c ( p+q(z_0 ) ) + _ 1,0(z_0 ) +     +    ( p+q ) + _ 1,0(z_0 ) ,    +    . [ tension ]    which guarantees that the forces on the junctions due to the string tensions cancel .",
    "this generalizes condition * b * , which restricted the orientations at _ all _ points along the strings .    for string webs which satisfy * b * but not * b * supersymmetry is completely broken , and therefore there are actually non - vanishing forces between the strings .",
    "this means that their trajectories deviate from @xmath1-geodesics , and condition * a * must be modified . the deviation is such that the string - string forces are balanced by elastic forces , r / l_s^2 ~ l_s^5/ r^6 , and is therefore negligible in the limit where the distances ( in the string metric ) between the branes are much greater than @xmath49 .",
    "we can therefore approximate the trajectories by @xmath1-geodesics in this limit . since this is precisely the regime where the stringy picture makes sense ,",
    "we conclude that conditions * a * and * b * guarantee that the string web is classically stable . on the other hand ,",
    "the field theory description holds when all distances are much _ smaller _ than @xmath49 .",
    "since the above string webs are not supersymmetric , their existence does not a - priori guarantee that the corresponding non - bps states will be stable in the field theory .",
    "we shall return to this point later on .    both orientations in ( [ tension ] )",
    "are now compatible with the geodesic condition .",
    "this means there are two kinds of junctions which can potentially be stable .",
    "let us refer to them as @xmath50-junctions and @xmath51-junctions , according to whether we use @xmath52 or @xmath53 to determine the orientations at the junction point .",
    "these correspond to the two different ways of ordering the three strings around the junction ( and therefore @xmath54 ) .    for a given position of the 3-brane , a state with",
    "a given set of charges @xmath55 ( other than @xmath56 ) can either correspond to a @xmath50-junction or to a @xmath51-junction , but not both .",
    "we can understand this qualitatively as follows . as @xmath57 the ordering of the strings changes . if we keep the 3-brane fixed , the @xmath29 and @xmath47 strings are exchanged .",
    "so for one of the junctions they would have to cross in order to end on the appropriate 7-branes .",
    "this leads to a closed loop of string , which is unstable to shrink to a point , giving back the other junction ( figure 2 ) .",
    "this will be verified by solving the stability conditions @xmath58 and @xmath59 , and finding all the stable states corresponding to @xmath50-junctions and @xmath51-junctions .",
    "= 5 in    as in the previous section , combining conditions * a * and * b * we find conditions on the arguments of @xmath60 , = \\ {    ll + ( p_i + q_i(z_0))^2 & - + & |-    . .",
    "[ phases2 ] since @xmath61 and @xmath62 must be integer multiples of @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively , we can set @xmath63 .",
    "therefore @xmath64 , and @xmath65 , where the sign depends on whether the string ending on the 7-brane at @xmath66 comes from the upper half - plane ( upper sign ) or the lower half - plane ( lower sign ) . given ( [ c ] ) , the conditions in ( [ phases2 ] ) then imply f(z_0 ) = 0 , ( f(z_0 ) ) = ( m nn ) , [ marginal2 ] and g(z_0,z_3)=0 , ( g(z_0,z_3 ) ) = ( m n ) , [ d3-brane ] where f(z ) \\ {    ll ( z)^2/(2+(z))^2 & - + 1 & |-    . , and g(z , w ) \\ {    ll ( z)^2/(2+(z))^2 & - + 1 & |-    . .",
    "solutions to ( [ marginal2 ] ) and ( [ d3-brane ] ) will correspond to force - free string webs , and therefore to stable states .",
    "there are four cases to consider , depending on whether the junction is @xmath50 or @xmath51 , and whether the junction point @xmath41 is in the upper or lower half - plane .",
    "@xmath51-junctions : :    @xmath67 corresponds to the familiar curve of    marginal stability @xmath12 . on the other hand",
    ", it follows    from ( [ marginal ] ) that @xmath68 on the upper    half - plane segment of @xmath12 , and    @xmath69 on the lower half - plane segment . solutions    to ( [ marginal2 ] ) therefore exist only for @xmath70 and    @xmath71 in the upper and lower half - planes ,    respectively .",
    "@xmath50-junctions : :    @xmath67 defines a _ new _ closed curve    @xmath11 which is diffeomorphic to @xmath12 , and ,    like @xmath12 , intersects the two 7-branes ( figure 3 ) .",
    "however the behavior of @xmath72 is precisely the    opposite : @xmath69 on the upper half - plane segment    of @xmath11 , and @xmath68 on the lower    half - plane segment ( this has been verified numerically ) .",
    "consequently    solutions to ( [ marginal2 ] ) exist only for @xmath73 and    @xmath74 in the upper and lower half - planes ,    respectively . therefore",
    ", as promised , @xmath50-junctions and    @xmath51-junctions are completely complementary .",
    "once the junction position @xmath41 has been fixed on either @xmath12 or @xmath11 , the condition @xmath75 determines a curve intersecting @xmath41 on which the 3-brane is to be placed . since @xmath76 when @xmath77 , _",
    "i.e. _ when the 3-brane is precisely on @xmath12 ( or @xmath11 ) , the sign of @xmath78 determines whether the 3-brane is inside or outside @xmath12 ( or @xmath11 ) .",
    "the condition on the sign of @xmath78 in ( [ d3-brane ] ) in fact requires the 3-brane to always be _ outside _",
    "@xmath12 ( or @xmath11 ) ( this has also been verified numerically ) .",
    "consequently stable @xmath51-junctions can only occur when the 3-brane is outside @xmath12 , and stable @xmath50-junctions can only occur when it is outside @xmath11 ( figure 3a ) .",
    "when the 3-brane coincides with @xmath12 ( @xmath11 ) all @xmath51 ( @xmath50 ) junctions become marginal , and when it moves inside they decay into open strings .",
    "therefore @xmath12 serves as a curve of marginal stability for states satisfying @xmath70 in the upper half - plane , and for states satisfying @xmath71 in the lower half - plane ( both include the bps states discussed in the previous section ) .",
    "likewise , the new curve @xmath11 is a marginal stability curve for states satisfying @xmath73 in the upper half - plane , and for states satisfying @xmath74 in the lower half - plane .",
    "the picture that emerges is that moduli space is divided into four regions ( figure 3b ) . in region",
    "i only @xmath29 and @xmath30 are stable . in region ii only states satisfying @xmath70 are stable , and in region iii only those satisfying @xmath71 are stable . in region",
    "iv , which includes the semiclassical regime , all values of @xmath79 and @xmath80 correspond to stable states .",
    "recall however that if the string web is reducible it can at most be marginally bound , in which case we will not count it as one of the stable states .",
    "the condition for irreducibility is given by = 1 , where the sign is again correlated with which half - plane ( @xmath81 ) we are considering .",
    "= 2.5 in = 2.5 in    : as the 3-brane moves around moduli space ( without crossing marginal stability curves ) the junction point slides along the curve of marginal stability , and eventually crosses one of the 7-branes , resulting in a string junction transition , by which strings get annihilated or created @xcite .",
    "this does not change the charges of the string ending on the 3-brane @xmath82 , since at the same time the 7-brane at @xmath83 changes its identity from @xmath47 to @xmath84 ( or vice versa ) , which precisely compensates for the string creation / annihilation effect . in the bps case",
    "the junction point always remains on @xmath12 . in the non - bps case ,",
    "on the other hand , it is possible for the junction point to `` jump '' from @xmath12 to @xmath11 , or vice versa .",
    "this is because the spectrum in region ii is different from that in region iii , so there are some states which correspond to @xmath50-junctions in one half - plane and to @xmath51-junctions in the other half - plane , like for example the state @xmath85 shown in figure  3a .",
    "in this paper we have extended the application of string junctions to the construction of stable non - bps states in @xmath0 @xmath2 sym . these correspond to string webs satisfying a reduced set of properties ,",
    "whereby the webs are classically stable , but do not preserve supersymmetry .",
    "the non - bps webs introduce a new curve of marginal stability into the moduli space , which in addition to the original one divides moduli space into four regions . in the region outside both curves",
    "we expect to see stable non - bps dyons of arbitrary even electric charge and arbitrary magnetic charge . the stable particle spectrum would thus be invariant under @xmath86",
    ". it would be worth while to find these states directly in the field theory .",
    "it should be stressed that all the results are classical , and therefore subject to quantum corrections .",
    "in particular , the webs we have constructed exist in the limit where all distances are much greater than @xmath49 .",
    "since the field theory limit corresponds to all distances being much smaller than @xmath49 , it does not immediately follow that these webs correspond to stable non - bps states in the field theory .",
    "one could however imagine starting with the string web picture , and gradually reducing the distances between the branes , while keeping the 3-branes always outside the curves of marginal stability . in this way the state should remain stable down to the field theory limit .",
    "the masses of the states and the precise form of the marginal stability curves ( with regard to the non - bps states ) will of - course differ from their classical ( string web ) values .",
