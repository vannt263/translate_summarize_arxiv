    "benzene is one of the most important organic molecules , because of its structural simplicity and its presence as a constituent of larger compounds .",
    "consequently , the molecule s various properties have been extensively studied , over the years . in particular , its electron transport properties are of interest @xcite , as being fundamental to the study of molecular wires , of various configurations and with differing components .    although the hckel molecular - orbital method @xcite has contained the overlap integral @xmath0 , since its earliest inception in the last century , overlap is quite often overlooked in quantum calculations , when its magnitude is deemed so small , as to render its inclusion unnecessary .",
    "a case in point arises in benzene transmission studies , where , because overlap has been considered negligible , it has so far not appeared in any reports ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . here",
    ", we redress this situation , by introducing overlap into the rescaling treatment of these molecules , and discover that overlap does , in fact , play a major role in determining the behaviour of the energy spectrum of the benzene transmission probability function @xmath1 .",
    "the discrete schrdinger equation gives rise to the rescaling technique @xcite , in which certain atomic sites are decimated , accompanied by renormalization of the parameters of the surviving sites . by this recursive process",
    ", the para- , meta- and ortho - benzenes can be mapped onto equivalent dimer molecules @xcite .",
    "such an approach facilitates the application of the lippmann - schwinger scattering theory @xcite for calculating the transmission - energy spectral function @xmath1 of the renormalized benzene molecules , thereby gaining insight into their electronic structure . in this paper ,",
    "the rescaling method is extended , in a straightforward manner , to include overlap , allowing its significant effect on the three benzene types to be explored .",
    "the molecular - orbital method is applied to a linear atomic chain ( see figure [ fig1](a ) ) , with coulomb integral @xmath2 at site @xmath3 , bond integrals @xmath4 and @xmath5 with neighbouring sites @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively , and corresponding overlap integrals @xmath8 and @xmath9",
    ".     decimated and and sites @xmath10 renormalized . other sites",
    "( with parameters not shown ) remain unchanged by the process.,width=453 ]    the discretized version of the schrdinger equation leads to the familiar secular equations @xcite , of which those involving site @xmath3 are : @xmath11 @xmath12 @xmath13 in order to eliminate site @xmath3 from the set , we solve ( [ eq2 ] ) for @xmath14 , and substitute into ( [ eq1 ] ) ( and similarly into ( [ eq3 ] ) ) , resulting in @xmath15 which can be rearranged as @xmath16   c_{n-1 } = ( \\beta_{n-2,n-1}-es_{n-2,n-1})c_{n-2 } \\nonumber\\\\ + { ( \\beta_{n-1,n}-es_{n-1,n } ) ( { \\beta_{n , n+1}-es_{n , n+1 } ) } \\over e - \\alpha_{n}}c_{n+1 } .",
    "\\label{eq5}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] equation ( [ eq5 ] ) can now be written in rescaled form as @xmath17 where the renormalized parameters are @xmath18 @xmath19 @xmath20 similarly , the substitution of ( [ eq2 ] ) into ( [ eq3 ] ) leads to the rescaled equation @xmath21 where @xmath22 is defined similarly to ( [ eq7 ] ) . taken together ,",
    "equations ( [ eq6 ] ) and ( [ eq10 ] ) replace ( [ eq1])-([eq3 ] ) in the set of secular equations , with site @xmath3 having been decimated , i.e. , deleted from the set , with its effect being incorporated within the renormalized parameters ( [ eq7])-([eq9 ] ) .",
    "the process of decimation - renormalization can be repeated , atom by atom , until the original chain or molecule is reduced down to one , or a few , site(s ) .",
    "looking at the renormalized parameters ( [ eq7])-([eq9 ] ) , it is important to notice that the _ de facto _ effect of including overlap is simply to replace @xmath23 by @xmath24 .",
    "consequently , it is straightforward to extend previous work on benzene transmission so as to incorporate overlap , as in the next section .",
    "in considering electron transmission through a benzene molecule , three cases arise , due to the different atomic sites to which the molecular leads can be attached ( see figure 2 of reference @xcite . ) in the para ( p)-benzene case , the leads are attached to the ( 1,4 ) sites , while in the meta ( m)-benzene and ortho ( o)-benzene varieties , they are joined to the ( 1,5 ) and ( 1,6 ) sites , respectively . as shown in detail in @xcite , the rescaling method is applied in such a way as to successively decimate four of the atoms in the benzene ring , leaving a dimer consisting of the two renormalized sites attached to the leads ( which are unaffected by the process ) .",
    "as indicated in the last section , the inclusion of overlap in the rescaling process requires only the replacement of @xmath23 by @xmath24 , and subsequently of the reduced energy @xmath25 by @xmath26 .",
    "this substitution is made only in the renormalized parameters , as we are only considering overlap between atoms in the benzene molecule , and not those in the leads .",
    "thus , the zero - overlap results of @xcite are readily extended to take overlap into account .    to this end ,",
    "renormalized parameters for each type of benzene dimer , modified from the results of @xcite , are as follows .",
    "( a ) * p - benzene * @xmath27 @xmath28 ( b ) * m - benzene * @xmath29   , \\label{eq13}\\ ] ] @xmath30 ( c ) * o - benzene * @xmath31   , \\label{eq15}\\ ] ] @xmath32^{-1 } , \\label{eq16}\\ ] ] with @xmath33    also adapted from @xcite is the transmission probability , namely , @xmath34 where @xmath35 with @xmath36 being the reduced dimer - site energies and the intra - dimer coupling , respectively .",
    "the index @xmath37 is chosen so as to represent the desired benzene type , using the appropriate pair of equations from ( [ eq11])-([eq16 ] ) .",
    "the methodology of the two previous sections can now be implemented to produce the @xmath1 curves for each of the three benzene types ( para- , meta- and ortho- ) , when overlap is ignored ( @xmath38 ) and for several non - zero values of @xmath0 . in the following calculations ,",
    "the parameter values chosen were the atomic - site energy @xmath39 and the bond energy @xmath40 , both in the benzene molecules and their leads .",
    "as mentioned earlier , overlap @xmath0 is included only in the benzene molecules , but not the leads , with its value varying from the no - overlap case of @xmath38 to a maximum of 0.25 .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows the @xmath1 curves for para - benzene , for the several values of @xmath0 indicated .     versus energy @xmath41 for para - benzene , with overlap @xmath42 ( a ) 0 ( green solid curve )",
    ", ( b ) 0.1 ( red long - dashed ) , ( c ) 0.2 ( blue dash - dotted ) , ( d ) 0.25 ( pink short - dashed).,width=453 ]    the no - overlap case , with @xmath38 , is illustrated in figure [ fig2](a ) .",
    "the curve is symmetrical in nature , with a pair of resonance maxima near the band edges , and a single local minimum at the band center @xmath43 .",
    "increasing @xmath0 from 0 , even marginally , has the effect of destroying the symmetry of the curve , and diminishing the resonances , although small values of @xmath0 ( see figure [ fig2](b ) ) produce otherwise minor changes in @xmath1 .",
    "larger increases in @xmath0 ( see figure [ fig2](c ) and ( d ) ) result in more significant changes , with further decreasing and broadening of the lower peak which nonetheless maintains a clear maximum , but more noticeably for the upper peak , which undergoes some narrowing and , eventually , complete suppression . thus , the asymmetry introduced by overlap shows a greater effect at higher energies , resulting in more favourable conditions for transmission at lower energies .    turning next to meta - benzene , the case @xmath38 is shown in figure [ fig3](a ) .     versus energy @xmath41 for meta - benzene , with overlap @xmath42 ( a ) 0 ( green solid curve )",
    ", ( b ) 0.1 ( red long - dashed ) , ( c ) 0.2 ( blue dash - dotted ) , ( d ) 0.25 ( pink short - dashed).,width=453 ]    the curve is symmetrical about the band center , with anti - resonances at @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "there are a pair of resonances at @xmath45 , and a pair of smaller peaks at @xmath46 , bounded by the anti - resonances .",
    "this structure , and in particular the anti - resonance at @xmath43 , makes meta - benzene the poorest transmitter of the three benzene types @xcite .",
    "taking @xmath0 to be non - zero ( see figure [ fig3](b)-(d ) ) again removes the symmetry of the @xmath1 curve , and all the more so with increasing values of @xmath0 .",
    "interestingly , and unlike the para - benzene case , the resonances are not lowered , but in fact , each is temporarily split into a pair of resonances ( figure [ fig3](b ) ) before , with increasing @xmath0 , the outer resonance of each pair is gradually lowered until eventually disappearing ( figure [ fig3](c ) and ( d ) ) .",
    "simultaneously , the lowermost peak broadens somewhat , while the uppermost narrows , due to the anti - resonances at @xmath44 shifting to slightly higher energies ( 0.66 and -0.4 , in figure [ fig3](d ) ) , while the band edges remain fixed , as does the anti - resonance at @xmath43 .",
    "the two smaller peaks flanking @xmath43 are relatively unchanged , with the lower one increasing and the upper one decreasing marginally , and their widths changed somewhat by the shifting energies of the anti - resonances . as in the previous case ,",
    "then , the greatest enhancement in @xmath1 is shown at lower energies , while the least occurs at energies near @xmath43 .",
    "finally , we consider ortho - benzene , starting from the case @xmath38 , as shown in figure [ fig4](a ) .     versus energy @xmath41 for ortho - benzene , with overlap @xmath42 ( a ) 0 ( green solid curve ) , ( b ) 0.1 ( red long - dashed ) , ( c ) 0.2 ( blue dash - dotted ) , ( d ) 0.25 ( pink short - dashed).,width=453 ]    once again , the @xmath1 curve is symmetrical , but with no resonances .",
    "there is a large central peak with a pair of smaller peaks on each side , separated by anti - resonances at @xmath47 and @xmath48 . as in the two previous cases , increasing @xmath0 from 0",
    "destroys the symmetry ( figure [ fig4](b)-(d ) ) , and indeed , more noticeably than in the other two cases .",
    "the change in the central peak is relatively mild , with the maximum increasing somewhat and moving to a slightly lower energy , as @xmath0 increases .",
    "but the real effect is in the side peaks , due partly to the anti - resonances shifting to higher energies , the upper duo more so than the lower pair .",
    "indeed , the uppermost anti - resonance eventually coincides with the upper band edge , so that the uppermost sub - band disappears , all the while as its height is decreasing ( figure [ fig4](c ) and ( d ) ) .",
    "its neighbouring peak increases substantially in height , while widening as well , to become one the graph s dominant features .",
    "meanwhile , the lowermost peak broadens and increases immensely to near - resonance status ( figure [ fig4](d ) ) .",
    "on the other hand , its neighbouring peak is relatively unaffected , albeit lowered somewhat .",
    "similar to the other two cases , @xmath1 exhibits its biggest increases at lower energies .    in comparing the effect of overlap in the three cases",
    ", it certainly appears that it is greatest for ortho - benzene , and smallest for meta - benzene . for even small non - zero values of @xmath0 , such as 0.05 ( not shown in the figures ) ,",
    "the symmetry of the @xmath1 curve is broken , but for such small @xmath0 , the effect is otherwise slight , at least for para- and meta- .",
    "the effect increases steadily with increasing @xmath0 . for para- and meta- , the effect is greatest for @xmath49 , while it is always present for ortho- . in all cases ,",
    "increasing @xmath0 has the general effect of shifting @xmath1 to lower energies .",
    "the rescaling technique has been extended , so as to incorporate overlap in the renormalization - decimation equations .",
    "subsequently , the method is applied to our previous work on transmission through benzene molecules , so as to investigate the effect of overlap between the carbon atoms in benzene .",
    "the observed effect is quite substantial , with the symmetry of the @xmath1 curve being broken by even a small degree of overlap , and increasing with @xmath0 . of the three types ,",
    "the largest effect occurs for ortho - benzene and the smallest for meta - benzene .",
