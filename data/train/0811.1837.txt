    "one of the most important problems in star formation is understanding the origin of the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) .",
    "the pioneering work by salpeter ( 1955 ) indicated that the imf in the mass range 0.4 - 10 m@xmath8 can be presented with power law or lognormal functions .",
    "recent studies have shown a break in the function around 1 m@xmath8 ( cf .",
    "kroupa 2001 , 2002 ; muench et al .",
    "2002 , 2003 ) .",
    "it is believed that the majority of stars are formed in clusters which contain a large number of low mass stars .",
    "these low mass stars play an important role in the study of imf .",
    "there are many embedded young clusters in molecular clouds ( cf . lada & lada 2003 ) , which are ideal targets for the study of imf , because the young clusters are known to keep their initial conditions of star formation .",
    "however , the molecular clouds have long prevented optical observations of the embedded young clusters , and we had to wait for the development of recent nir arrays for substantial observations ( e.g. , lada & lada 2003 ) .",
    "the functional form and the universality of the imf at a very low mass regime including brown dwarfs ( bds ) are still open questions . at the low end of the imf",
    "are bds which are star - like objects that span the mass range between giant planets like jupiter and the least massive stars that are just below the hydrogen - burning limit but above the deuterium - burning limit .",
    "the expectation that bds form by the same physical process as low - mass young stars suggests that one might find bds in the very locations that one finds protostars : molecular clouds .",
    "however , it is not clear how abundantly bds are formed in molecular clouds and whether they significantly contribute to the low - mass end of the luminosity function , and therefore to the imf . by conducting surveys of the young stellar populations often associated with molecular cloud cores we will be able to characterize the imf down into the bds regime and determine : i ) if there is a peak in the imf of young , emerging star clusters near the hydrogen - burning limit ( zinnecker et al . 1993 ; muench et al . 2002 ) and ii ) what connection is there , if any , between such a peak and the physical conditions that characterize the molecular cloud .",
    "the main difficulty so far is the lack of high spatial resolution and sensitive data in the crowded fields , such as dense cluster cores , where there is a high probability of finding bds .    so far",
    "the young brown dwarf ( ybd ) search has been limited to the nearby star forming regions ( @xmath9 500 pc ; e.g. orion , taurus , chamaeleon , lupus , ophiuchus : kaifu et al .",

    "an apparent ms track is noticeable at @xmath25 @xmath0 0.4 in this diagram ; however , a comparison of it with a similar diagram for the stars in the control field ( fig . 4 ; _ right _ ) shows that it is a sequence caused by field stars in the foreground of w3 main .",
    "it also appears that the reference field has foreground extinction of the order of 3 - 5 visual magnitudes .",
    "a comparison of the @xmath27 versus @xmath25 cc and @xmath25 versus @xmath7 cm diagrams of the reference field and w3 main region indicates that stars having @xmath28 1.0 are probable foreground sources . in figure 4",
    "( _ left _ ) , ysos ( classes ii and i ) found from the cc diagram ( fig .",
    "3 ) are shown as stars and triangles , respectively . however , it is important to note that even those sources not shown with stars or triangles may also be ysos with an intrinsic color excess , since some of them are detected in the @xmath12 and @xmath7 bands only and are not in the @xmath11 band because of their very red colors .",
    "figure 4 ( _ right _ ) shows that there is a lack of sources brighter than about @xmath7 = 14.5 in the reference field , which are saturated in our observations .",

    "the number of such bright stars in our field - of - view is small and does not contribute the object field as extincted background stars that mimic ysos .      in our deep nir observations , 130 very red sources are detected in the @xmath12 and @xmath7 bands , out of which only 10 sources have @xmath11 counterpart .",

    "it appears that most of these ysos ( class i sources ) are associated with the diffuse ionized gas at the edge of these h ii regions .",
    "most of the sources with large color indices ( @xmath29 ) also seem to be distributed all over the field , barring the w3a h ii region .",
    "however , an apparent concentration of these sources can be seen around w3f , irs 7 and irs 5 regions ( see figs . 1 & 5 ) .",
    "the lack of these red sources around w3a h ii region indicates that this region is relatively evolved as compared to other regions .",
    "if we assume that the large @xmath25 ( @xmath31 2 ) color results merely from the interstellar reddening affecting normal stars , then the extinction value might even exceed 60 mag in the molecular cloud in which some of the red stars are found ( see fig .",
    "however , with such a large amount of absorption , diffuse emissions are unlikely to be detected in the nir . since most of the red sources are associated with faint diffuse emission across the field ( fig .",
    "5 ) , this provides evidence that these sources are ysos with intrinsic nir excesses and possibly local extinction as well .",
    "we also find that the mean @xmath26 value of the class ii sources around w3 irs 5 dense cluster region is about 21 mag .",
    "a similar value of @xmath26 for the red sources indicates that large @xmath25 color of these sources should be due to nir excess .",
    "this further provides evidence that the red sources should be pms objects still embedded in clouds .",
    "the @xmath7-band luminosity function ( klf ) of an embedded cluster is useful in constraining the age of the cluster ( megeath et al 1996 ; ojha et al 2004a ) .",
    "our motivation is also to compare the klf slope obtained from deeper subaru @xmath7-band data with the results from previous studies of w3 main ( ojha et al .",
    "2004a ; megeath et al .",
    "1996 ) . in order to derive the observed klf",
    ", one needs to apply corrections for ( 1 ) the incompleteness of the star counts as a function of the @xmath7 magnitude , and ( 2 ) the field star contribution in the line of sight of the cluster .",
    "we have determined the completeness of our @xmath7-band data through artificial star experiments using addstar in iraf ( see  3 ) .",
    "this was performed by adding fake stars in random positions into the images at 0.5 magnitude intervals and then by checking how many of the added stars could be recovered at various magnitude intervals .",
    "we repeated this procedure at least five times .",
    "we thus obtained the detection rate as a function of magnitude , which is defined as the ratio of the number of recovered artificial stars over the number of added stars .",
    "one method to correct for the foreground and background contamination is to use a reference field , located reasonably away from the cluster , and yet close enough to have a similar galactic field star distribution , e.g. , with the same galactic latitude . the observed reference field is then assumed to represent the contaminating field population in the w3 main region .",
    "however , in the case of a young and partly embedded region like w3 main , the colors and magnitudes of the background contaminating populations are significantly affected by the parent molecular cloud . to correct for the foreground and background contamination",
    ", we used of both the galactic model by robin et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and the reference field star counts .",
    "this galactic model of population synthesis reproduces the stellar contents of the galaxy .",
    "the star counts were predicted using the besanon model of stellar population synthesis ( robin et al .",
    "2003 ) in the direction of the reference field close to the w3 main ( see  2 ) , which is also corrected for photometric completeness . to ensure that the model does a reasonably good job in predicting the field star population , we compared the model star counts with those of our observed reference field .",
    "figure 6 shows the comparison of the completeness corrected klf of the reference field with the model star counts where all the stars are made fainter by an interstellar extinction of @xmath26 = 5 mag .",
    "it can be seen that the model star counts match reasonably well with the observed reference field .",
    "hence , we used this model to predict the contamination to the w3 main field , for which all the field stars are made fainter by an interstellar extinction of @xmath26 = 5 mag , whereas the background stars are made fainter by an additional cloud extinction .",
    "the advantage in using this model is that the background stars ( @xmath32 1.83 kpc ) can be separated from the foreground stars ( @xmath33 1.83 kpc ) .",
    "while all the stars in the field suffer a general interstellar extinction , only the background stars suffer an additional extinction due to the molecular cloud . from figure 4",
    "we conclude that the average extinction to the embedded cluster is @xmath26 @xmath0 15 mag ( @xmath25 @xmath0 1.0 ) . assuming spherical geometry , background stars are seen through @xmath26 = 30 mag ( 2@xmath34 15 mag ) .",
    "therefore , we applied an extinction value of @xmath26 = 30 mag ( or @xmath35 = 2.7 mag ) in simulating the background stars .",
    "we combined the foreground and background stars to make a whole set of the contamination field and obtained the fraction of the contaminating stars over the total model counts .",
    "then we scaled the model prediction to the star counts in the reference field , and subtracted the combined foreground ( @xmath33 1.83 kpc ) and background ( @xmath32 1.83 kpc with @xmath35 = 2.7 mag ) data from the klf of the w3 main region .    after correcting for the foreground and background star contamination and photometric completeness",

    "the klf of the w3 main region shows a power - law slope of @xmath36 = 0.14 @xmath21 0.03 over the magnitude range 14 - 18 in the @xmath7-band . the derived klf slope is lower than those generally reported for the young embedded clusters ( @xmath40 , e.g. , lada et al .",
    "1991 , 1993 ; lada & lada 2003 ) .",

    "the distribution of other point sources appears to be quite uniform for both the @xmath58 mag ranges .",

    "the `` f '' region sources do not show any segregation ; although some patchy extinction just around w3 irs 5 provides an impression of a paucity of the `` f '' region sources near irs 5 , the radial averaged @xmath26 is quite smooth out up to 0.6 pc .",

    "<S> we present the results of deep and high - resolution ( fwhm @xmath0 0.35 ) @xmath1 near - infrared observations with the subaru telescope , to search for very low mass young stellar objects in the w3 main star - forming region . </S>",
    "<S> the near - infrared survey covers an area of @xmath0 2.6 arcmin@xmath2 with 10 @xmath3 limiting magnitude exceeding 20 mag in the @xmath1 bands . </S>",
    "<S> the survey is sensitive enough to provide unprecedented details in w3 irs 5 and irs 3a regions and reveals a census of the stellar population down to objects below the hydrogen - burning limit . </S>",
    "<S> we construct @xmath1 color - color and @xmath4 and @xmath5 color - magnitude diagrams to identify very low luminosity young stellar objects and to estimate their masses . </S>",
    "<S> based on these color - color and color - magnitude diagrams , we identified a rich population of embedded yso candidates with infrared excesses ( class i and class ii ) , associated with the w3 main region . </S>",
    "<S> a large number of red sources ( @xmath6 2 ) have also been detected around w3 main , which are arranged from the northwest toward the southeast regions . </S>",
    "<S> most of these are concentrated around w3 irs 5 . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that these red stars are most probably pre - main - sequence ( pms ) stars with intrinsic color excesses . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the slope of the @xmath7-band luminosity function of w3 main is lower than the typical values reported for young embedded clusters . </S>",
    "<S> based on the comparison between theoretical evolutionary models of very low - mass pre - main sequence objects with the observed color - magnitude diagram , we find there exists a substantial substellar population in the observed region . </S>",
    "<S> the mass function does not show the presence of cutoff and sharp turnover around the substellar limit , at least at the hydrogen - burning limit . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the mass function slope indicates that the number ratio of young brown dwarfs and hydrogen - burning stars in the w3 main is probably higher than those in trapezium and ic 348 . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of mass segregation , in the sense that relatively massive ysos lie near the cluster center , is seen . </S>",
    "<S> the estimated dynamical evolution time indicates that the observed mass segregation in the w3 main may be the imprint of the star formation process . </S>"
