    "we proceeded as follows : first we fixed @xmath7 between @xmath8 and @xmath9 and took a pump value for which the single ",

    "two features of the bistability domain are of particular interest:(i ) the domain extends to the left up to @xmath79 , well below @xmath80.(ii ) the domain extends up to a frequency @xmath81 larger than @xmath82 .",
    "hence , considering @xmath0 as the bifurcation parameter , the bifurcation is subcritical not only for @xmath83 , as shown by fu in the class  b limit , but also for @xmath84.(iii ) the domain extends up to a minimum frequency @xmath85 .",
    "let us now characterize the multi  mode dynamics existing in the range of parameters covered in fig .",
    "[ fig : bista ] .",
    "there are two clearly different regimes that are separated by the dashed line that crosses the bistability regime ( marked as @xmath86 ) . at the left of the dashed line , multi  mode emission is periodic , the modal intensities are constant and phases are locked .",
    "the dashed line marks a hopf bifurcation . at the right of this line",
    "the dynamics of the total intensity is quasi  periodic and the modal intensities and the relative phases oscillate periodically in time .    in order to analyze this in more detail , we describe now the dynamics of the system for the particular value @xmath87 as a function of the pump parameter @xmath0 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : int - a ] the modal intensities corresponding to the central mode , @xmath88 , and the two first sidebands ( modes @xmath89 and @xmath90 ) are represented as a function of @xmath0 ( the intensities of higher order modes are , at least , one order of magnitude smaller than @xmath90 ) .",
    "there are three clearly distinguishable zones in fig .",
    "[ fig : int - a]:(i ) for @xmath91 , the modal intensities are constant and single  valued , and symmetric modes have the same intensity ( @xmath92 , @xmath93).(ii ) for @xmath94 , the modal intensities are constant but there are two possible solutions , denoted as @xmath95 and @xmath96 in the figure , and symmetric modes have different intensities ( @xmath97 ) .",
    "precisely , when @xmath98 , then @xmath99 , and viceversa.(iii ) for @xmath100 the modal intensities are no more constant ( for this domain , in the figure we have represented the extrema of the modal intensities ) .    hence , looking at the modal intensities , we can conclude that they are subject to a pitchfork , symmetry breaking , bifurcation at @xmath101 and to a hopf bifurcation at @xmath102 .",
    "we studied more in detail the two multi  mode self  pulsing solutions that coexist in the interval @xmath103 .",
    "one could imagine that these solutions differ in the total intensity , because all the modes placed on one side of the spectrum have intensities larger than the corresponding modes on the other side .",
    "but this is not the case : the shape of the pulses emitted by the laser is exactly the same for the two solutions . how this can be possible",
    "can be understood looking at the behavior of modal frequencies and phases .    in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : frefas ] we show the calculated frequencies of the central mode @xmath104 and of the first side ",
    "modes @xmath105 , to which we have subtracted the empty cavity frequencies @xmath106 . in the lower panel of the same figure we represent in radians the relative phase @xmath107 , where @xmath108 is the phase of the @xmath109th mode . if the solution is phase ",
    "locked @xmath110 , as well as all the other relative phases @xmath111 that can be defined in the same way , must be constant .",
    "we see that at the pitchfork bifurcation the modal frequencies experience a shift in the same direction , positive or negative for the two solutions .",
    "this shift however preserves phase  locking , although @xmath110 is no longer equal to 0 as for @xmath112 , but it can take two opposite values , associated with the two solutions .",
    "notice that the maximum frequency separation between the two phase  locked solution is about 0.02 .",
    "the combination of different mode intensities , frequencies and relative phases makes it possible that the total intensities for the two solutions are identical .",
    "let us now analyze the laser dynamics beyond the hopf bifurcation @xmath102 . in figs .",
    "[ fig:15.4 ] , [ fig:16.0 ] , and [ fig:16.8 ] we considered the three different values for the pump @xmath113 , @xmath114 and @xmath115 . in each figure the upper panel shows the total intensity , the middle panel the modal intensities of the central mode and of the first two side  modes , and the lower panel the relative phase @xmath110 defined above , measured in radians .",
    "the total intensity displays a slow modulation with period of some hundreds time units , superimposed to the much faster self  pulsing oscillations of period @xmath116 .",
    "this slow modulation is clearly related to the oscillations of the modal intensities and of the relative phase , which have the same period .",
    "the period is almost the same in figs .",
    "[ fig:15.4 ] and [ fig:16.0 ] , and it is almost twice larger in fig . [ fig:16.8 ] .",
    "the strength of the modulation increases with @xmath0 , and the relative phase @xmath110 passes from the almost regularly periodic oscillations of fig .",
    "[ fig:15.4](c ) to the behavior shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:16.8](c ) , where @xmath110 remains most of the time close to 0 .",
    "we notice that the slow modulation frequency for the smaller values of @xmath0 is close to the maximum frequency separation between the two phase  locked solutions that is achieved immediately before @xmath102 .",
    "hence , we may interpret the dynamical state that arises from the hopf bifurcation as a state where the two phase  locked solutions are present simultaneously , and oscillate at their beat note .",
    "let us finally comment that we have not found chaotic behavior .",
    "certainly the quasi  periodic dynamics of the total intensity is more involved as pump increases , but multi  mode emission disappears before more complex dynamics develops .",
    "we have numerically and theoretically investigated bistability between single  mode and multi  longitudinal mode solutions in the standard ring",
    " cavity two  level laser within the uniform field limit .",
    "we have determined the domain of coexistence between the single  mode and multi  longitudinal mode solutions for a class  c laser ( we have used @xmath64 , and @xmath65 ) finding that this domain is relatively wide . in particular we have found that the domain of coexistence is different from that corresponding to a class  b laser as it extends for @xmath7 slightly larger than @xmath11 and for @xmath25 ( for class  b lasers it exists for @xmath117 and @xmath118 @xcite ) .",
    "we have also found that the multimode solution undergoes a pitchfork bifurcation ( which is a symmetry breaking bifurcation ) and a subsequent hopf bifurcation that destroys mode  locking . in the near future",
    "we plan to extend this numerical study to a situation closer to that of the experimental conditions in @xcite , in order to determine up to what extent the deviations from the theoretial predictions could be interpreted as a manifestation of the coexistence between single  mode and multi  longitudinal mode emission .",
