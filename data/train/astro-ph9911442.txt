    "strong ly@xmath0 line emission has been proposed as a possible signature of primeval galaxies . though early modeling conjectured that these emission lines would be highly luminous but diffuse , searches on 4m - class telescopes found no such emission lines ( pritchet 1994 ; thompson & djorgovski 1995 ) .",
    "deep spectra at the keck telescopes , however , regularly reveal serendipitous high - equivalent width , isolated emission lines ( e.g. , stern et al .",
    "1999 ; hu et al . 1998 ) .",
    "indeed , the first confirmed galaxy at @xmath5 was discovered in this manner ( dey et al .",
    "we report on two sources with strong line emission identified on a single slitlet from deep slitmask observations of the ssa22 field , with equivalent widths @xmath6 .",
    "the source targeted by this slitlet is a color - selected lyman - break galaxy ( lbg ) ; we analyze it in parallel for comparison .",
    "we adopt @xmath7 .",
    "we have obtained deep , moderate - dispersion spectra of @xmath8 lbgs in the ssa22 field with the aim of detailed studies of the ages , kinematics , dust - content , and abundances of the lbg population ( dey et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "the data were taken with the low resolution imaging spectrometer ( oke et al .",
    "1995 ) at the keck ii telescope on ut 1997 september 10 , using the 600 lines@xmath9 grating blazed at @xmath10 .",
    "slitlet widths were @xmath11 , resulting in a spectral resolution of @xmath12 ( fwhm ) .",
    "four @xmath13 exposures ( seeing fwhm@xmath14 ) are analyzed in this report .",
    "the data were processed using standard slit spectroscopy procedures ( for details , see manning et al . , in preparation ) .",
    "we find two serendipitous , isolated emission lines , ser-1 and ser-2 , in a @xmath15 long slitlet centered on the lbg , c17 ( z=3.299 ; see fig .",
    "1 ) . though only one of these serendipitously discovered sources ( see fig .",
    "2 ) displays the obvious asymmetry characteristic of most high - redshift ly@xmath0 emission ( e.g. , dey et al .",
    "1998 ) , we argue that ly@xmath0 is indeed the most likely interpretation for both .",
    "we performed a simulation of the [ o ii ] doublet under the @xmath16 resolution of our observations .",
    "we find that an [ o ii ] identification is inconsistent with ser-1 and ser-2 , since the doublet is marginally resolved and has significantly greater fwhm than our lines .",
    "the absence of associated emission argues against h@xmath17 , [ o iii]4959 , or [ o iii]5007 interpretations . finally , the lines are shortward of @xmath18 , so h@xmath19 is not a viable identification . in the following ,",
    "we assume what is most certainly the case  that these are in fact ly@xmath0 emission lines .",
    "notably , neither spectrum displays perceptible continuum .",
    "measured continua were consistent with zero counts .",
    "we establish a @xmath20 ( @xmath21 confidence ) limit on the equivalent width , @xmath22 ( ser-1 ) , and @xmath23 ( ser-2 ) .",
    "rest values are tabulated in table 1 .",
    "c17 has @xmath24 .",
    ".emission line properties [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     intrinsic source sizes are approximated by deconvolution of the observed spatial fwhm with the seeing , obtained from a quasar in an adjacent slitlet .",
    "the velocity widths have been deconvolved using the instrumental resolution , obtained from spectra of a near lamp ( see table 1 ) .",
    "the velocity dispersions of ser-2 and c17 are lower limits , as possible truncation of the blue - side of the emission line has not been accounted for .",
    "what is the physical origin of these isolated , high - equivalent width emission lines ?",
    "the small velocity dispersions ( @xmath25 ) and lack of associated n  v or c  iv emission argue against the presence of an agn , while the high surface brightness is inconsistent with photoionization by the metagalactic flux ( e.g. , bunker et al .",
    "thus we assume the lines are stellar in origin .",
    "below we argue that they are primeval .",
    "the starburst modeling of charlot & fall ( 1993 ) suggest that the ly@xmath0 rest equivalent width may exceed @xmath26 for timescales of at most a few @xmath27 yr .",
    "a model of primeval galaxies based on a collapsing isothermal cloud ( lin & murray 1992 ) predicts that primeval galaxies should have isophotal radii @xmath28 , and luminosities of order @xmath29 ; strong star formation continues for @xmath30 , fed by the continuing collapse of the cloud .",
    "cloud mass may be tuned to fit observed luminosities .",
    "we suggest that this theory holds promise for the modeling of our serendipitous sources .",
    "the ly@xmath0 luminosities imply lower limits to star formation rate ( sfr ) of @xmath31 for ser-1/ser-2 ( e.g. , dey et al . 1998 ) , while non - detection of continua imply upper limits of @xmath32 . assuming a sfr of @xmath33 , and @xmath34",
    ", we project @xmath35 at @xmath36 .",
    "steidel et al .",
    "( 1999 ) find a steep faint end slope for the luminosity function of star - forming galaxies at @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) , implying that a large fraction of the uv luminosity density is produced by galaxies fainter than the spectroscopic limits of photometric surveys . by virtue of the association of uv luminosity with sfr",
    ", this would also imply that a large fraction of the star formation density is unobserved . because the ly@xmath0 lines of such as our serendipitous objects are likely to be observable only for a very small fraction of 1 gyr , these two are tangible evidence for this many - fold larger population of slightly older , faint continuum , star forming galaxies with self - absorbed ly@xmath0 , inaccessible to even the deepest spectrosopic or color selection surveys .",
    "the evidence strongly suggests that ser-1 and ser-2 are primeval . in the near future ,",
    "interesting conclusions may be possible regarding the degree of clustering and/or isolation of these low - luminosity emission line galaxies .",
    "the large surface density variance in ly@xmath0 emission line galaxy candidates between different fields in a coarse `` narrow - band '' ( @xmath39 ) hst study ( pascarelle et al . 1998 ) , indicates that these compact galaxies are often at least loosly grouped .",
    "clearly , the model of lin & murray requires that primeval galaxies be born in relatively quiescent , yet gas - rich environments .",
    "however , as star - forming galaxies , their likely evolutionary antecedents , the lbgs , are often found clustered on large scales ( e.g. , steidel et al .",
    "1998 ) ; perhaps they are protoclusters .",
    "the dynamics involved in the growth of large scale perturbations ( i.e. , infall and rising central densities ) may be accompanied by a spreading `` wave '' ( in the lagrangian sense ) of primeval galaxy formation , perhaps occurring at a characteristic overdensity  a scenario reminiscent of stellar `` shell burning ''  reproducing the inside - out , older - to - younger galaxy age distribution seen in some recent studies of lower redshift fields and groups ( e.g. , loveday et al .",
