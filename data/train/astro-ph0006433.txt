    "an intrinsic colour calibration is a relation defining , either in some colour - colour plane , or in some n - dimensional space if the calibration requires n colour indices , the locus occupied by stars .",
    "the calibration is called `` intrinsic '' because it holds for the colours which emerge from the stellar atmosphere but not for the observed colours , which are altered while passing through the interstellar medium .",
    "knowledge of an intrinsic colour calibration allows , at least in principle , to derive the reddening of a given star by comparing the observed colours with the colours predicted by the calibration .",
    "this may fail if the effect of reddening is to shift the point representative of a star along the curve , i.e. if the reddening vector is parallel to the intrinsic locus .",
    "this occurs for instance in the @xmath3 plane for f , g , k stars where the reddening vector in the @xmath4 plane is almost parallel to the intrinsic locus of main sequence stars .    determining the reddening of an individual star is important for several reasons .",
    "first , estimation of reddening is necessary if we want to obtain a photometric distance of the star .",
    "second , it is necessary for the derivation of atmospheric parameters of the star , such as effective temperature , surface gravity and metallicity .",
    "these parameters can be derived from suitable colours , provided the reddening is properly taken into account .",
    "for example the @xmath5 colour may be accurately calibrated onto @xmath6 ( alonso et al 1996 , 1999 , di benedetto 1998 ) , but using @xmath5 rather than @xmath7 will result in an underestimate of the temperature .",
    "finally the knowledge of the reddening gives important information on the interstellar medium along the line of sight towards the star .    for f , g and",
    "k stars the calibration of @xmath8 colours by schuster & nissen ( 1989 ) has proved to be both a very powerful and accurate tool for estimating the reddening and has become the `` standard '' procedure for its determination .",
    "the possibility of deriving such a calibration was foreseen in the very design of the strmgren photometric system and was already exploited by the calibrations of crawford ( 1975 ) and olsen ( 1983 ) which preceded the schuster & nissen calibration and are superseded by it .",
    "the calibration is possible because the system provides two indices , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , which mainly depend on effective temperature ; however while @xmath9 depends on reddening the @xmath10 index is reddening  independent .",
    "therefore there exists a functional relation @xmath11 which allows to calibrate the reddening of the observed @xmath9 .",
    "this is accomplished by the schuster & nissen calibration in which terms in @xmath12 allow to take into account the metallicity dependence of @xmath9 , while terms in @xmath13 allow to take into account its dependence on surface gravity ( luminosity ) .",
    "although very powerful , strmgren photometry requires a considerable investment in telescope time , due to the large number of filters ( 6 ) and to their relatively narrow width .    the hk objective ",
    "prism / interference filter survey ( beers et al 1985 , 1992 ) provides , at present , the largest sample of stars suited for the study of the galactic structure .",
    "the survey is kinematically unbiased and therefore it is ideal for studying both kinematics and dynamics of the galactic halo . besides being the main source of extremely metal - poor stars , [ fe / h]@xmath14",
    ", it provides a large number of stars in the range @xmath15 \\le -2.0 $ ] which are well suited to study both the thick  disc and the halo thick  disc transition .",
    "the medium dispersion follow  up survey , which provides radial velocities and metallicities , has been extended by beers and collaborators in both northern and southern hemispheres and the results will be soon available ( see beers 1999 for a summary ) . at the same time",
    "photometric campaigns are being carried out to complement spectroscopic data .",
    "norris et al ( 1999 ) provide @xmath16 data for @xmath17 stars , preston et al ( 1991 ) for about 1800 stars , doinidis & beers ( 1990 , 1991 ) for about 300 stars and bonifacio et al ( 2000 ) for about 300 stars .",
    "strmgren photometry is provided for 89 stars by schuster et al ( 1996 ) , and for @xmath18 stars by anthony ",
    "twarog et al ( 2000 ) , although the latter data do not include the @xmath10 index and therefore can not be used to derive reddenings from the schuster & nissen calibration .    from the above summary it is clear that the schuster & nissen calibration is of little use in determining reddenings for hk stars and would require further observational efforts to obtain also @xmath8 data .",
    "so far reddenings for these stars have been determined from maps , those of burstein & heiles ( 1982 ) in the first place , and , more recently , those of schlegel et al ( 1998 ) .",
    "however it is possible to determine reddenings from available data by developing a suitable schuster & nissen  type calibration .",
    "the indices involved in the schuster & nissen calibration are mostly measures of the following quantities : slope of the paschen continuum ( @xmath19 ) , metallicity ( @xmath12 ) , balmer jump ( @xmath13 ) , @xmath20 ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "johnson photometry provides the slope of the paschen continuum ( @xmath21 ) and the balmer jump ( @xmath22 ) , the line index @xmath0 defined in beers et al ( 1999 ) is sensitive to metallicity , while the index @xmath1 is a pseudo  equivalent  width of @xmath23 .",
    "it is therefore reasonable to expect that a schuster & nissen  type calibration , involving @xmath24 and @xmath0 may be derived . in the following",
    "we show that this is indeed the case and that reddening may be derived from it with an accuracy comparable to that of the schuster & nissen calibration .",
    "to derive the calibration we used the sample of stars used by beers et al ( 1999 ) for the calibration of the @xmath0 index .",
    "for all these stars @xmath16 photometry and @xmath1 and @xmath0 indices are available . as calibrators we selected the stars with low reddening from beers et al ( i.e. @xmath25 ) . to make this criterion more stringent and thus to select a sample of truly unreddened stars",
    ", we searched the hauck & mermillod ( 1998 ) @xmath8 catalog , through the interface of the general catalog of photometric data ( gcpd , mermillod , hauck & mermillod , 1996 ) to find out stars of the beers et al sample with @xmath8 photometry .",
    "we then applied the schuster & nissen calibration to these data to obtain @xmath26 .",
    "our final criterion was that both the estimate of @xmath2 of beers et al and the one derived from strmgren photometry were less than or equal to 0.01 mag our criterion was @xmath27 . ] .",

    "a matter of concern is wether the luminosity ( gravity ) dependence of the calibration is properly captured by the @xmath52 colour .",
    "inspection of table 1 reveals that , although we did not impose any selection criterion on luminosity , most of our stars are dwarfs , only one is a giant , three sub  giants and one horizontal branch .",
    "this is a result of imposing a very tight criterion on reddening for the calibrators : all low  reddening stars are nearby and therefore most are dwarfs .",

    "although the high luminosity stars are under  represented there does not appear to be any obvious trend in the residuals with gravity .    from the above discussion we conclude that our reddening is comparable to that derived from strmgren photometry through the schuster & nissen calibration , while with respect to the reddening derived from the maps ( either those of schlegel et al or those of burstein & heiles ) there is an offset of @xmath68 mag , in the sense that the reddening predicted by equation [ ebv ] is higher than that predicted by the maps .",
    "the comparison also suggests that the accuracy of our reddening estimate is of the order of 0.03 mag , and therefore it is comparable to the reddening obtained from the schuster & nissen calibration .",

    ", our reddenings are systematically higher by about 0.01 mag .    the data base for @xmath1",
    ", @xmath0 , @xmath46 and @xmath52 for hk survey stars is steadily increasing thanks to the efforts of beers and collaborators and presently data for about 3000 stars are available .",
    "our calibration may be used to derive reddenings for all these stars .",
    "dereddened colours are necessary to determine the metallicity from the beers et al ( 1999 ) calibration and to derive a photometric distance . in the case of stars which will be observed spectroscopically at high resolution , dereddened colours will allow the determination of effective temperatures from colour  temperature calibrations .",
    "whenever @xmath8 photometry is available the schuster & nissen calibration is the preferred way to determine the reddening of a star .",
    "however , when no strmgren photometry is available , our calibration provides a useful way to estimate reddening with comparable accuracy .",
    "we are grateful to the referee , dr . a. alonso , for carefully reviewing our paper and for suggesting many additions and improvements to its first version .",
    "this research made use of the simbad data base operated at cds , strasbourg .",
