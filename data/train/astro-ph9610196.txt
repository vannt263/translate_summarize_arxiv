    "an outstanding achievement of modern cosmology has been the detection of anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background @xcite .",
    "these anisotropies provide a snapshot of the universe about 400,000 years after the hot big bang , just as the universe became transparent to electromagnetic radiation . despite this observational triumph , as yet it has been insufficient to differentiate between competing paradigms for galaxy formation , nor has it shed much light on cosmological processes taking place before photon decoupling .",
    "there are , however , other types of radiation , such as gravitational radiation , which penetrate through this electromagnetic surface of last scattering , travelling virtually unaffected since their emission , even when this occurred in the first few fractions of a second .",
    "of course , for gravitons this remarkable transparency is due to their very weak interactions with ordinary matter which , in turn , makes them difficult to observe .",
    "however , pioneering experiments have been proposed which could detect stochastic backgrounds of gravitational waves generated in the early universe over a range of frequencies .    gravitational radiation detected with a particular frequency",
    "today would have been created at a characteristic time ( if generated by classical , causal mechanisms ) .",
    "assuming that the radiation is emitted at a time @xmath0 before equal matter - radiation ( @xmath1 years ) and that it is created with a wavelength comparable to the horizon @xmath2 , then its frequency today is given by @xmath3 where the redshift @xmath4 and ` little @xmath5 ' is the rescaled hubble constant lying in the range @xmath6 .",
    "the quantity that is measured by a particular experiment is the dimensionless amplitude @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the gravitational radiation density contribution to the universe s density per octave at a frequency @xmath9 , and @xmath10 is the critical energy density .",
    "clearly , from ( [ eqnone ] ) gravitational radiation with higher frequencies will be more difficult to detect .",
    "there are currently four frequency bands available for studying gravitational radiation @xcite .",
    "first , there are the microwave background anisotropies created by tensor modes which may have been detected by the cobe - dmr experiment . in inflationary scenarios ,",
    "the precise signal ratio due to tensor versus scalar modes is sensitively model - dependent , but it could be as high as 50% .",
    "assuming that the entire cobe signal is due to gravitational waves implies a weak upper bound of @xmath11 at a frequency of @xmath12 .",
    "a second upper limit on @xmath13 comes from pulsars , since a stochastic background would lead to timing noise in measurements of the incoming periodic electromagnetic signal .",
    "a recent limit is @xmath14 at @xmath15 @xcite , though the statistical veracity of this result has been questioned with re - analyses of the same data suggesting both stronger and weaker bounds @xcite .",
    "thirdly , proposed ground based detectors will study frequencies around 100hz with a maximum sensitivity of about @xmath16 for the first generation of ligo detectors and @xmath17 for the next generation ligo and virgo detectors . finally , the proposed space - based interferometer lisa will have a sensitivity of @xmath17 at about @xmath18 .",
    "the inflationary paradigm @xcite is strongly motivated because it resolves a number of shortcomings of the standard hot big bang cosmology , including the horizon , flatness and monopole problems . however , possibly the most significant testable prediction of inflationary scenarios is a nearly scale - invariant spectrum of adiabatic density perturbations produced through quantum mechanical effects when the very early universe is dominated by the potential energy of some scalar inflaton field @xmath19 .",
    "an important by - product of this process is the excitation of tensor modes resulting in a background of gravitational waves .",
    "the spectra for scalar and tensor modes created in a slow - roll inflationary model are the following , @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the hubble parameter during inflation , @xmath22 is the value of the inflaton field when the mode with comoving wavenumber @xmath23 leaves the hubble radius @xmath24 , and the slow - roll parameter is @xmath25 with the prime @xmath26 denoting differentiation with respect @xmath19 .",
    "here , @xmath27 is related to the speed at which @xmath19 rolls down the potential @xmath28 ( less than unity during inflation ) .",
    "once a particular mode is created , it is driven outside the hubble radius ( or ` horizon ' ) by the rapid expansion and it effectively ` freezes ' until it returns inside the horizon during the subsequent radiation and matter dominated eras .",
    "lengthscales corresponding to the size of the observed universe went outside the horizon early when the inflaton field had a value denoted by @xmath29 ; after this there were about 60 e - foldings of expansion before the end of inflation when @xmath30",
    ".    for a specific inflaton potential @xmath28 , the dynamics of the hubble parameter in the hamilton - jacobi formalism is given by @xcite @xmath31 the hubble parameter monotonically decreases during slow - roll inflation , so from ( [ spectrum ] ) the largest contribution to the gravitational wave spectrum is due to modes that were driven outside the horizon early in inflation and have just come back inside the horizon at the present day .",
    "these scales correspond to those probed by the cobe - dmr experiment and the observed anisotropies can be used with ( [ spectrum ] ) to normalize @xmath32 . given this initial condition , ( [ eom ] ) can be used to calculate the hubble parameter during inflation and hence the resulting spectrum of gravitational waves .",
    "paradoxically , as we shall see , the larger the contribution of a model to the cobe signal , the smaller the signal will be in the frequency bands corresponding to lisa and ligo / virgo ; the hubble parameter must decrease more rapidly in order to maintain the condition that there be 60 e - foldings before the end of inflation @xcite .    in order to illustrate this point , we shall calculate the spectrum of gravitational radiation produced by an inflationary model similar to polynomial chaotic inflation , but slightly modified to make analytic calculations tractable @xcite . using a simple method to obtain the cobe normalization @xcite , the potential for this model",
    "is given by @xmath33 where @xmath34 and we require @xmath35 .",
    "for this model , the slow - roll and hubble parameters are given by @xmath36 for @xmath37 , substituting into ( [ spectrum ] ) and appropriately redshifting yields @xmath38^{\\alpha/2}\\,.\\ ] ] for @xmath39 , that is , scales which come inside the horizon later during the matter era , we have less redshifting and ( [ chaotic ] ) must be multiplied by an additional factor @xmath40 .",
    "to delineate the predictions of different slow - roll inflation models , one can use different values of @xmath41 ; the obvious limiting cases being @xmath42 , the simplest chaotic model , and @xmath43 ( say ) for which almost all the cobe signal is due to gravitational waves ( this case corresponds closely to power law inflation with an exponential potential ) .",
    "the results of these cases are plotted in figure  1 .",
    "the @xmath42 model has a low contribution to cobe but the spectrum for @xmath37 decreases slowly down to an amplitude of @xmath44 at a few hz .",
    "in contrast , the model with @xmath43 has a much larger contribution to cobe , but has a very small amplitude for scales @xmath37 ; in the lisa frequency band this has already fallen to @xmath45 , eight orders of magnitude smaller than for @xmath42 .",
    "nonetheless , both these models produce signals well below the sensitivity of proposed interferometers by several orders of magnitude .",
    "the largest possible cobe normalization provides a weak upper limit on the amplitude of gravitational waves for all scales @xmath37 which must be below the level @xmath46 .",
    "it may be possible to carefully construct a slow - roll potential which would almost achieve this limit in the lisa and ligo / virgo frequency bands , but undoubtedly the potential would look rather contrived . in any case , it is clear that the prospects for a detectable slow - roll signal are bleak , so we shall have to consider less orthodox inflationary models . in the next section ,",
    "we consider extended and hybrid inflation , but there are also more speculative superstring - inspired models which can give a larger gravitational wave background ( for example see @xcite ) .    0.5in5.0 in",
    "cosmological phase transitions in which symmetries are spontaneously broken are now an integral part of modern cosmology . in a first - order phase transition",
    "the field becomes trapped in a metastable local minimum of the potential  the false vacuum .",
    "the transition to the true vacuum takes place by the nucleation of bubbles and their subsequent rapid growth .",
    "when these vacuum bubbles collide copious amounts of gravitational radiation can be emitted , particularly if the relative velocity of the walls is relativistic as in strongly first - order phase transitions .",
    "it has been estimated that the maximum contribution to the gravitational wave background from such a transition would be @xcite @xmath47 at a frequency of @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the nucleation rate of bubbles , @xmath50 is the temperature of the phase transition , @xmath51 is the relevant hubble parameter and @xmath52 is the number of relativistic degrees of freedom . assuming that the electroweak phase transition is strongly first - order implies @xmath53 at a frequency of @xmath54 , inside the lisa band with a detectable amplitude , as illustrated in figure  1 .",
    "however , the minimal standard model is currently believed to have only a weakly first - order transition , if not second - order , with the bubble walls reaching velocities well below the speed of light . in this case , @xmath55 has been estimated to be around @xmath56 which is well outside lisa s sensitivity @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , there are a number of well - motivated extensions to the standard model ( like supersymmetry ) which could entail symmetry - breaking just above the electroweak scale ; if strongly first - order , such phase transitions would create a distinctive and detectable lisa signal . fortuitously from this point of view , lisa has a very interesting frequency response range .",
    "while the prospects for detecting gravitational waves from slow - roll inflation seem poor , there are a number of inflationary models which do not end in the standard re - heating scenario .",
    "these include extended inflation @xcite and hybrid inflation @xcite which exit through a phase transition ; this provides an extra , potentially more powerful source of gravitational waves if this final phase transition is strongly first - order @xcite .",
    "the radiation could be detected by the advanced ligo and virgo detectors if the re - heat temperature of the universe was close to @xmath57gev or @xmath58gev  scales which are far from ruled out by current observations .",
    "we have included a sample spectra for such a model in figure  1 .",
    "cosmic strings are line - like topological defects which may form during phase transitions in the early universe ( see , for example , @xcite ) . due to the large string mass per unit length ( typically about @xmath59 for gut scale strings ) , they may have acted as the initial seeds for the formation of large - scale structure @xcite . in general , a network of strings will evolve towards a self - similar scaling solution by the production of loops and the subsequent emission of radiation into a preferred channel . for local strings ,",
    "this channel is gravitational radiation , thus creating a stochastic background of radiation over frequencies from @xmath60hz to @xmath61hz .",
    "scale - invariant string evolution implies that the density of the string network @xmath62 remains constant relative to the background density .",
    "statistically , the network has the same properties at any two times , except for a universal scaling with respect to the growing horizon size , that is , there exists a characteristic length scale @xmath63 .",
    "this scaling regime has been shown to exist numerically @xcite and various parameters have been estimated , notably @xmath64 during the radiation era .",
    "the radiative dynamics of the strings is a crucial factor determining the precise contributions at various frequencies .",
    "the power radiated by a string loop is normally written as a sum over loop harmonics @xcite , that is , @xmath65 where @xmath66 @xcite is a constant parametrized solely by the particular loop trajectory and not its length , @xmath67 is the string mass per unit length and @xmath68 is some cut - off introduced by the effects of radiation backreaction @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .    assuming that @xmath69 is constant and for reasonable values of @xmath70",
    ", one can deduce that the spectrum of gravitational radiation due to loops created during the radiation era is independent of frequency and only very weakly dependent on the loop radiation spectrum .",
    "the amplitude of this flat spectrum is given by @xmath71 where @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath41 is the constant loop production size with respect to the horizon .",
    "in contrast , the radiation background today due to loops produced in the matter era is highly dependent on the loop radiation spectrum .",
    "assuming that @xmath75 , one can deduce that @xmath76=a+(1-q)\\log_{10}[\\omega]$ ] .",
    "therefore , the amount of radiation produced in the matter era which feeds into higher frequencies is extremely sensitive to @xmath77 and @xmath70 .",
    "it is precisely these frequencies that are relevant for the pulsar timing experiment @xcite .",
    "one can investigate these effects more fully as in ref .",
    "@xcite using a numerical algorithm which calculates the spectrum of radiation for given spectra and cosmological parameters @xcite .",
    "the parameters that were used are @xmath78 , @xmath79 and the electroweak model particle spectrum with three lepton generations .",
    "it was found that the contribution to the pulsar timing frequency was the same for all @xmath80 irrespective of the value of @xmath70 , while for @xmath81 it was sensitive to the value of @xmath70 . in particular , for @xmath82 and @xmath83 the amplitude of the spectrum will be in conflict with the constraint from pulsar timings for the string energy density @xmath84 normalised to cobe @xcite .",
    "however , if @xmath82 and @xmath85 then the contribution to the pulsar timing frequency will be the same as for @xmath86 and @xmath83 .",
    "the spectrum of radiation emitted by loops is likely to be cut off by the effects of backreaction as shown numerically for goldstone boson radiation from global cosmic strings @xcite , therefore it seems sensible to exclude the @xmath82 , large @xmath70 spectra on physical grounds ( as we discuss in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . using well - motivated values of @xmath77 and @xmath70",
    ", one can use the pulsar timing constraint to deduce that @xmath87 @xcite . using @xmath88",
    "also reduces the contribution to the pulsar timing frequency from matter era loops due to curvature domination at @xmath89 , though we expect this effect to be small .",
    "the contribution from cosmic strings to the lisa and ligo / virgo frequency ranges is likely to be slightly lower than that relevant for pulsar timing because particle mass thresholds cause entropy transfers which reduce the relative density contribution of any pre - existing decoupled radiation .",
    "the cosmic string spectrum shown in figure  1 illustrates this effect with a gradual rise in the otherwise flat spectra at frequencies around @xmath90hz .",
    "this particular rise is caused by particle annihilation near the qcd and electroweak phase transitions . if the particle physics model has more degrees of freedom at higher energies there could be other steps related to other phase transitions .",
    "however , the dependence on @xmath69 is reasonably weak and therefore we can conservatively estimate that @xmath91 at @xmath92hz and @xmath93 at 100hz for @xmath94 .",
    "we note also that very precise determinations of the stochastic background from cosmic strings at different frequencies would measure @xmath95 in different cosmological epochs , providing fascinating insight into the particle content of the early universe ( at times as early as @xmath96 for ligo and virgo ) .",
    "finally , we should note that there are other types of cosmic strings which do not produce a large background of gravitational radiation , such as those formed when global symmetries are broken .",
    "the dynamics of global strings is dominated by the production of goldstone bosons and a simple calculation suggests that gravitational waves will be suppressed by approximately four orders of magnitude ; the global string spectrum is also illustrated in figure  1 .",
    "gravitational waves potentially provide a unique and unparallelled probe of the very early universe .",
    "the proposed interferometers , both terrestrial and space - based , could rule out or severely constrain a number of viable theoretical models , most notably the cosmic string scenario . on the other hand",
    ", the detection of a primordial background of gravitational waves would have a profound impact on our understanding of high energy physics and cosmology , providing an unprecedented view of the earliest moments after the creation of the universe .",
