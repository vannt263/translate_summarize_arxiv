    "we investigate asymptotics of the excursion probability of non - smooth bivariate gaussian random fields on @xmath15 , where the methods are totally different from the smooth case .",
    "our work is also motivated by the recent increasing interest in using multivariate random fields for modeling multivariate measurements obtained at spatial locations ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
