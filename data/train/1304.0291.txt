    "such difference can also lead to independent raman transitions when the other two plane wave lasers are applied ( see next subsection ) .",
    "note that @xmath178 can drive the @xmath185 transitions from the ground states @xmath189 and @xmath190 to all possible excited levels which satisfy the selection rule .",

    "when the blue detunings @xmath197 are comparable with the fine - structure splitting , the @xmath198 transitions actually contribute to the lattice potential and can lead to a small spin - dependent term in the lattice potentials .",
    "however , by a similar numerical estimate based the experimental data for @xmath37k @xcite , we have verified that the spin - dependent term of the lattice potentials due to the @xmath198 transitions is only slightly above @xmath220 of the spin - independent term when the detunings @xmath197 is less than the fine - structure splitting .",

    "similar to the previous subsection , the two lasers can drive all possible transitions satisfying the selection rule . as we consider the @xmath191 line in the @xmath37k atoms , the ground state @xmath189 can couple to the excited level @xmath224 , while the state @xmath190 can couple to two excited levels @xmath193 and @xmath189 @xcite . by a similar calculation ,",
    "the effective rabi - frequencies induced by the two plane waves on the ground states satisfy @xmath225 here the dipole matrix elements are defined by @xmath226 and @xmath227 . using the experimental data of the relative transition strength for @xmath37k atoms  @xcite , we have from the above formula that @xmath228 this implies a small spin - dependent diagonal potential induced by @xmath221 , which modifies the zeeman term @xmath229 in the effective hamiltonian , or equivalently , shifts the energies of the two ground states ( stark shift ) .",
    "furthermore , as mentioned in the previous subsection , the two @xmath17 lasers @xmath221 can also drive @xmath198 transition from the ground state @xmath190 to the excited one @xmath189 in the manifold @xmath230p@xmath231 ( not shown in fig .  [ simodel2 ] ) @xcite . taking this contribution into account we further find for @xmath232thz that @xmath233 therefore the actual spin - dependent potential results in an effective zeeman term ( or energy shift ) with the magnitude being about @xmath234 , with @xmath235 .",

    "can approximate the effective rabi - frequencies induced by @xmath221 to be spin - independent to study the raman fields .",
    "the raman fields are generated by two - photon processes @xcite .",
    "when @xmath236 , the population of excited states due to single - photon transitions is ignorable .",
    "then the two - photon processes dominate and can drive the raman couplings between two ground states @xmath192 and @xmath194 if the two - photon off - resonance @xmath31 is small compared with the coupling strengths given by @xmath237 . note that the difference of the single - photon detunings @xmath186 ( about @xmath40mhz ) is much greater than @xmath237 ( @xmath238mhz ) .",
    "this leads to two independent raman transitions , with one induced by lasers @xmath27 , and another by @xmath29 [ fig .",

    "this is because in the experiment of alkali atoms , the degeneracy of the ground states is non - uniformly lifted by the external magnetic field . for @xmath37k atoms , with a magnetic field of strength @xmath241 g and tuning the raman transition between @xmath192 and @xmath194 to be nearly resonant ,",
    "the raman couplings between @xmath19 and other ground levels will be completely suppressed by large two - photon detunings ( @xmath187mhz ) @xcite . as a result",
    ", the raman couplings only occur between @xmath192 and @xmath194 , with the raman fields given by @xmath242 in the above form we have neglected the contributions of raman couplings through @xmath243 lines , which slightly reduce @xmath7 under the condition that @xmath197 are less than the fine - structure splitting . to induce the 2d spin - orbit coupling",
    ", we require a @xmath244-phase shift between the two plane waves @xmath245 and @xmath246 , which can be locked with mature technologies in the experiment .",

    "( 1 ) in the main text .      from the above discussions we can see that the atom - light couplings have two effects , namely , inducing the diagonal potentials and driving raman transitions . the diagonal potentials are approximately spin - independent for @xmath37k atoms in the parameter regime that the single - photon blue detunings @xmath197 are much larger than the hyperfine - structure splitting but less than the fine - structure splitting .",
    "the two standing wave lasers @xmath13 generate the conventional square optical lattice , and together with the two plane waves @xmath18 the raman fields are induced .",
    "note that the square lattice and the spatial profile of the raman fields are determined by the same standing wave lasers .",
    "the relative configuration between the raman fields and square lattice is automatically fixed : the periodicity of the raman fields is double of the lattice period , and the raman fields are antisymmetric corresponding to the center of each lattice site [ fig .",
    "[ simodel2 ] ( c ) ] .",
    "this implies that the phase fluctuations in the standing wave lasers , characterized by @xmath45 and @xmath46 , only lead to global shift of the lattice and raman fields as illustrated in fig .",

    "the relative spatial profile of @xmath7 and @xmath47 is always automatically pinned up and therefore the effective hamiltonian   is unchanged .",
    "this greatly simplifies the experimental setup in the realization .",
    "compared with the recent experiments of generating 1d spin - orbit coupling in cold atoms through a single pair of lasers @xcite ( and refs .",
    "[ 10,13,14 ] in the main text ) , the present proposal applies one more pair of lasers to drive another independent raman transition and uses blue - detuned lasers .",
    "note that both pairs of lasers couple to the same two atomic ground states and no additional optical transitions to other atomic ground states are needed .",

    "the tight - binding hamiltonian is given by @xmath248 where @xmath54 is the 2d lattice - site index , the zeeman term @xmath33 , the particle number operators @xmath55 , and @xmath53 denotes spin - conserved hopping , given by @xmath249\\phi^{(\\vec j+\\vec 1)}_{s\\sigma}(\\bold r).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] on the other hand , from the even - parity ( relative to the lattice - site center ) of the local @xmath1-orbitals @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) , the periodic terms @xmath7 , which are odd relative to each lattice - site center , do not couple the intrasite orbitals , but lead to spin - flip hopping with the coefficient given by @xmath250 representing the induced 2d so interaction .",
    "it can be directly verified that the spin - flip hopping terms due to the raman fields satisfy @xmath251 where @xmath58 with @xmath252 and @xmath59 the lattice constant .",
    "we note that the staggered property of the spin - orbit term are a consequence of the relative spatial configuration of the lattice and the raman fields : the periodicity of the raman fields is double of the lattice period , and the raman fields are antisymmetric corresponding to the center of each lattice site [ fig .",
    "[ simodel2 ] ( c ) ] . as pointed out in the previous section , this relative configuration",
    "is automatically fixed , since the spatial profiles of both the square lattice and the raman fields are determined by the same standing wave lasers @xmath13 .",
    "these results are stable against lattice oscillations when the phase fluctuations are present in the standing wave lasers in realistic experiments .",
    "the staggered spin - flip hopping terms in eq .",
    "bring two important effects .",
    "first , these terms lead to 2d spin - orbit coupling .",
    "moreover , the staggered property implies that the coupling between spin - up and spin - down states transfers @xmath253 momentum , which effective shifts the brillouin zone by half for the spin - down states ( relative to the spin - up states ) .",
    "the latter effect can be absorbed by redefining the spin - down operator @xmath60 .",
    "we then recast the hamiltonian into @xmath61+\\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\bigr[\\sum_{j_y}it_{\\rm so}^{(0)}(\\hat",

    "this interesting effect makes the above single - particle model be already nontrivial : it leads to the quantum anomalous hall effect as studied in the main text .",
    "finally we provide numerical estimate for parameters in the realistic experiments .",
    "the upper value of the detunings is limited by the fine - structure splitting and can be taken as @xmath163thz for @xmath37k atoms , which is actually the parameter regime in the recent experiment  @xcite . therefore in this proposal",

    "<S> the band gap closes at @xmath77 and reopens when @xmath78 , with the effective mass at this dirac point changing sign and leading to the change by @xmath79 in the chern number , and therefore the system becomes topological with @xmath80 . in the same way </S>",
    "<S> , one can determine that the phase is topological for @xmath81 . </S>",
    "<S> note that masses of both dirac hamiltonians around @xmath82 and @xmath83 change sign when varying @xmath84 to @xmath85 , implying that @xmath86 and therefore @xmath87 for @xmath81 . </S>",
    "<S> we then conclude that the hamiltonian realizes a qahe with the quantized hall conductance @xmath88    it is noteworthy that while the qahe was previously studied in spinless cold fermion models @xcite , it requires complicated lattice configurations and staggered gauge potentials which are hard to be achieved in the experiments . </S>",
    "<S> here we have proposed a novel scheme to observe qahe in spin-@xmath6 fermion system which is truly accessible with current experimental platforms .    </S>",
    "<S> _ chiral topological superfluid phase._@xmath2we next study the topological chiral superfluid phase by considering an @xmath1-wave interaction which can be well controlled with feshbach resonance in cold atoms @xcite . in optical lattice , this interaction is described by the attractive fermi hubbard model @xmath89 , where the regularized 2d effective interaction @xmath90 with @xmath91 , @xmath92 , and the s - wave scattering length @xmath93 . </S>",

    "<S> first of all , the square optical lattice and the periodic raman fields , used to induce 2d so interactions , are generated through the same standing - wave lasers , which greatly simplifies the setup for experimental studies . on the other hand , for blue - detuned optical lattice the atoms are trapped in the minimums of lattice potentials which may generally minimize heating effects @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> note that while the topological superfluid phase with majorana modes requires a fermion system , the topology and band structure of the insulating state can be demonstrated with cold bosons @xcite , which makes experimental observations even more straightforward . </S>",
    "<S> it is worthwhile to point out that 2d chiral topological orders are classified by a @xmath176 invariant , and is stable when stacking multi - layers of the 2d system . </S>",
    "<S> this enables a study of topological superfluid in the many - layer square lattice system which may have a higher transition temperature since the fluctuation in the superfluid order can be suppressed </S>",
