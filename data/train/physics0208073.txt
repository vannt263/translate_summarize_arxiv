    "for sufficiently high laser frequency and intensity , the ionization probability of an atom decreases by further increasing the laser intensity .",
    "this , at first sight , counterintuitive effect is called dynamic or adiabatic stabilization , depending on the pulse length @xcite .",
    "so far , it has been observed in numerical simulations only ( see @xcite and , for very recent results , @xcite ) .",
    "its theoretical explanation is most elucidating in the framework of high - frequency floquet theory @xcite : the time - averaged kramers - henneberger potential , as it is seen by a free electron moving in the laser field , provides bound states . the electronic probability density of these states is spread over spatial regions with dimensions of the order of the classical excursion amplitude which may be tens of atomic units or more .",
    "the laser frequency @xmath4 , required for dynamic stabilization where the electron starts from the field - free ground state with binding energy @xmath5 , has to exceed the field - dressed binding energy , @xmath6 . since such high frequencies are not yet accessible to nowadays intense laser systems the experimental verification of dynamic stabilization is still to come .",
    "however , with the intense , short - wavelength , and coherent light sources under construction worldwide ( e.g. , at desy in hamburg ) ground state stabilization should become experimentally accessible soon .",
    "signatures of dynamic stabilization of rydberg atoms , where @xmath7 is smaller , have been measured @xcite .",
    "dynamic stabilization has been studied extensively during the last decade .",
    "ionization rates and energy shifts were obtained numerically by floquet theory @xcite or approximate , analytical high - frequency floquet theory @xcite .",
    "full numerical _ ab initio _ solutions of the time - dependent , single - electron schrdinger equation were obtained for low - dimensional model systems ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) and , after the early work in @xcite very recently , in three spatial dimensions for linear polarization @xcite and circularly polarized laser pulses @xcite .",
    "although the floquet ionization _ rates _ decrease monotonically for laser intensity @xmath8 the ionization _",
    "probability _ in full _ ab initio _ solutions of the tdse for _ finite _ laser pulses assumes a minimum and increases again thereafter . in the limit of laser intensity",
    "@xmath8 but otherwise fixed pulse parameters the survival probability of an atom will thus approach zero .",
    "moreover , it has been found that the magnetic field of the laser  usually neglected because of the dipole approximation  leads to increased ionization @xcite .",
    "this is due to the ponderomotive force which pushes the electrons in propagation direction . in multi - electron atoms",
    "electron correlation also hinders stabilization ( see @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "two - color interference effects on stabilization in linear polarization was studied in @xcite .    in this paper the dynamic stabilization of h in circularly polarized single- and two - color fields is investigated .",
    "the article is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ theory ] the three - dimensional , time - dependent schrdinger equation to be solved numerically is introduced , and the form of the applied two - color fields is explained . in sec .",
    "[ singlecolor ] the results concerning the single - color , circular polarization case are presented . besides snapshots of the probability density and photoelectron spectra , particular emphasis is put on the comparison of ionization rates and energy shifts with results from floquet theory . in sec .",
    "[ twocolor ] the main two - color results are presented .",
    "probability density structures are observed which display well separated maxima , the number of which is related to the frequency ratio of the two fields .",
    "the structure moves as a whole in the laser field and can be explained with the help of two - color , time - averaged kramers - henneberger potentials .",
    "survival probabilities after the two - color pulses are presented as a function of the two laser s peak field strengths .",
    "the two - color survival probabilities and above - threshold ionization spectra are compared with the corresponding single - color results where the second field was absent .",
    "it is good news that adding a second color is possible without a drastic inhibition of stabilization even if the second laser s intensity lies in the `` death valley '' of high ionization .",
    "finally , we conclude in sec .",
    "[ concl ] .",
    "the time - dependent schrdinger equation ( tdse ) for the electron of atomic hydrogen in the electric field of a laser @xmath9 ^ 2   -\\frac{1}{r } \\right )    \\psi(\\vektr , t ) \\label{tdse}\\ ] ] is solved numerically in three spatial dimensions ( atomic units are used unless noted otherwise ) .",
    "the intense laser field can be treated classically . since the laser wavelength is large compared to all other relevant length scales and the electron dynamics",
    "is non - relativistic for our laser parameters , the dipole approximation can be applied so that the vector potential @xmath10 does not depend on spatial coordinates .",
    "hence , the magnetic component of the laser field is neglected .",
    "if we restrict ourselves to study _ coplanar _ two - color fields ( of , however , arbitrary ellipticity ) we may choose the coordinate system in such a way that the @xmath11-component of the electric field @xmath12 vanishes : @xmath13\\vekte_x+[e_y^{(1)}(t)+e_y^{(2)}(t)]\\vekte_y$ ] .    the wave function @xmath14 is expanded in spherical harmonics , @xmath15 which leads to a set of coupled tdses for the radial wave functions @xmath16 ,    @xmath17    where @xmath18 is the effective atomic potential including the centrifugal barrier , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and the purely time - dependent @xmath21-term has been transformed away .",
    "the matrix elements @xmath22 may be expressed in terms of clebsch - gordan coefficients .",
    "it is worth noticing the coupling of different @xmath23 and @xmath24 quantum numbers in the tdse due to the laser field : there is a @xmath25 coupling as well as a @xmath26 coupling ( where compatible with the condition @xmath27 ) . from the knowledge of these couplings one can immediately deduce non - perturbative selection rules , e.g. , if the initial wave function is the 1s groundstate , states with ( @xmath28 , @xmath29 ) , with ( @xmath30 , @xmath31 ) , with ( @xmath32 , @xmath33 ) etc .",

    "the radial coordinate @xmath34 was discretized directly in position space .",
    "the details of the implementation may be found in @xcite and is similar to what has been described in @xcite for the simpler case of linear polarization .    the radius of our numerical grid , including the region where the non - vanishing imaginary potential damps away probability density approaching the grid boundary , was between 240a.u .  and 450a.u .",
    "the maximum @xmath23 quantum number was typically @xmath35 .",
    "for testing the convergence of our results runs up to @xmath36 were also performed  with no significant changes in the observables of interest . for obtaining the results presented in this paper ,",
    "the run times of our schrdinger - solver were always less than 18 hours on 1 ghz pcs .",
    "we focus on two - color fields where both fields are circularly polarized .",
    "we assume a @xmath37-shaped up- and down - ramp of the @xmath38th field , @xmath39 over @xmath40 cycles and a constant part of @xmath41 cycles duration . in the following",
    "we will refer to such a pulse as a @xmath42-pulse . for the @xmath38th electric field in , say ,",
    "@xmath43-direction @xmath44 is set where @xmath45 .",
    "the absolute ramping time as well as the duration of the constant part of the laser pulse are chosen the same for both colors so that the times @xmath46 , @xmath47 , etc .",
    "are independent of @xmath38 .",
    "since we are interested in _ opposite _ circular polarizations @xmath48 are taken as the @xmath49-components of the two colors .",
    "the corresponding vector potential can be calculated from @xmath50 .",
    "in such two - color pulses , as long as @xmath40 , @xmath51 are integer numbers , a _ free _ electron ( initially at rest ) returns to its starting point at the end of the laser pulse  without residual drift momentum .",
    "before turning to the two - color study let us analyze the simpler single - color case .",
    "for the latter , results from _ ab initio _ solutions of the three - dimensional tdse were obtained only recently @xcite whereas two - dimensional model solutions were presented earlier @xcite .",
    "ionization _ rates _ as well as energy shifts for hydrogen in the stabilization regime ( with dipole approximation ) are available for several years @xcite so that a comparison with our finite pulse results is possible and will be presented in this paper . since all vector potential amplitudes @xmath52 considered in this work are @xmath53a.u .  the dipole approximation is applicable , as has been shown in @xcite .      in order to calculate the probability for the hydrogen atom to `` survive '' non - ionized till the end of the pulse the probability density",

    "the radius @xmath55 was chosen several times greater than the biggest excursion amplitude @xmath56a.u .",
    "considered in this paper .",
    "since the free part of the wavefunction vanishes inside that sphere at sufficiently large times after the laser pulse has passed by , the amount of probability density inside the sphere leads then with high accuracy to the same probability one would obtain by projecting on all bound states .     the probability density , integrated over a sphere of radius @xmath54 for laser pulses of frequency @xmath57 [ plot ( a ) ] and @xmath58 [ plot ( b ) ] vs.  time .",

    "[ severala : bigsphere ] the very existence of dynamic stabilization is proven : the survival probability at the end of the pulse increases with increasing peak field strength ( attached to the curves ) up to a maximum value .",

    "the highest survival probability in plot ( b ) amounts to @xmath60 .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the survival probability is rather sensitive to the laser pulse shape and duration .",

    "@xcite .    whenever the slope of the probability curves vs.  time is linear on the logarithmic scale an ionization _ rate _ can be determined . while this is straightforward for the curves in the @xmath58 panel it turns out to be more difficult for the @xmath57-results in ( a ) .",

    "although a probability density ring , describing the previously explained `` hula - hoop''-dynamics , is clearly visible , the probability density is not uniformly distributed along that ring but has rather a sickle - like shape . hence",
    ", the system is obviously not in the kh ground state but in a superposition of states with different azimuthal quantum numbers .",

    "note that there is always a probability density maximum at the position of the ion .",
    "for lower values of @xmath70 we observed more complex situations where no clear ring structure but two or more wave packets swirl about the ion .",
    "for the single - color case , accurate ionization rates were numerically obtained many years ago by means of non - perturbative floquet theory @xcite .",
    "those rates are accurate in the sense that _ if _ the system somehow manages to occupy a single floquet state it will decay precisely with the corresponding floquet rate .",
    "usually an adiabatic turn - on is needed to transfer the system from the field - free groundstate to a single floquet state .",
    "the problem is that an adiabatic ramping of the laser pulse counteracts stabilization because the system has to spend too much time in the so - called `` death valley '' of medium laser intensities where ionization is strong , and thus nothing would survive to be stabilized . hence , short turn - on times are desirable .",
    "however , after such rapid turn - ons the system might be `` shaken - up '' into a superposition of many floquet states . under such conditions",

    "it is the other way round : the two - color result follows closely the low - frequency curve whereas the high - frequency field alone yields higher ionization because @xmath119 is still close to the `` death valley . ''",
    "since in plot ( a ) all curves cross each other it is apparent that the final survival probability is sensitive to the pulse length . however , it should be stressed that , fortunately , the two - color survival probability is _ not _ determined by the frequency which yields highest ionization .",
    "this means that the two - color `` probability density shaping , '' as discussed in the previous subsection , can be performed without drastic reduction of the survival probability .     the probability to survive the laser field",
    "non - ionized vs.  time in laser cycles of the lower frequency field with @xmath67 .",
    "the full curves are the two - color results for @xmath117 , the dotted curves are the results for the low - frequency field alone , the dashed curves are the results for the @xmath117-field alone . in panel",
    "( a ) the equal excursion amplitude case @xmath144 is shown while in ( b ) the equal intensity case @xmath145 is presented .",
    "( 2,8,2)- and ( 4,16,4)-pulses were used for the @xmath0- and @xmath128-field , respectively . ]    in fig .",
    "[ survprobvse1e2 ] the survival probabilities at the end of ( 2,8,2)- and ( 4,16,4)-pulses for @xmath67 and @xmath117 , respectively , are plotted vs.  the field amplitudes @xmath120 and @xmath119 . because of the probability density representing free but slow electrons it takes a long time until the probability density integrated over the sphere of radius @xmath54 assumes a constant value .",
    "hence , to obtain fig .",
    "[ survprobvse1e2 ] we have chosen to measure the survival probability as the maximum probability to find the electron in a smaller sphere of radius @xmath146 within a time period of 85a.u .  after the pulse .",
    "the maximum probability has to be taken because of oscillations due to excitation of the 2s and the 3s state .",
    "note that this method for measuring the survival probability slightly overestimates ionization because probability density which represents slow recombining electrons , slowly spirals back to the ion and does not enter the small sphere within the observation time .",
    "however , here we are not interested in absolute numbers ( which depend sensitively on the pulse duration and shape anyway ) . from fig .",
    "[ survprobvse1e2 ] one infers that the highest survival probability is obtained , as expected , in the single - color high - frequency case where @xmath147 . in general , the overall behavior is an increasing stabilization probability up to a maximum value , followed by increasing ionization if the laser intensities are increased further .",
    "this is different from high - frequency floquet theory where the ionization rate monotonically decreases with increasing intensity because the `` shake - off '' during the pulse turn - ons and -offs is not taken into account .     the survival probability after a ( 2,8,2)- and ( 4,16,4)-pulse of frequency @xmath67 and @xmath117 , respectively , vs.  the peak field strengths @xmath120 and @xmath119 .",
    "the data points indicated by vertical lines were calculated , the shaded surface is an interpolation between them . increasing survival probability for",
    "@xmath148 was suppressed for the sake of better visibility of the results in the stabilization regime .",
    "see text for discussion . ]    in our results , the field strength regime where @xmath149 in fig .",
    "[ survprobvse1e2 ] may be identified as the `` death valley '' of high ionization probability . of course ,",
    "the survival probability increases towards unity as @xmath148 .",
    "however , this has been suppressed in the plot because it blocked the visibility of the results in the stabilization regime in which we are interested .",
    "given a certain @xmath120 , adding @xmath119 is , from a stabilization point of view , almost always beneficial , provided that @xmath119 is not too strong so that shake - off dominates .",
    "if , on the other hand , we choose a certain @xmath119 and add a @xmath0-field the survival probability may be enhanced or diminished , depending on whether @xmath119 lies in its single - color stabilization regime or near its single - color `` death valley . ''",
    "the case of a rosette - like stabilized probability density where the excursion amplitudes @xmath70 are equal leads only to a relatively small reduction in the survival probability with respect to the optimally stabilized @xmath128-field alone ( around @xmath150 in fig .",
    "[ survprobvse1e2 ] ) .",
    "in contrast , the equal intensity result remains close to the low - frequency single - color result where @xmath151 .",
    "note that maximum stabilization is achieved for modest values of @xmath152 where the probability density splitting , i.e. , trichotomy , quatrochotomy , etc . , is not yet developed .",
    "finally , let us briefly discuss the two - color photoelectron spectra .",
    "the single color case has been analyzed in subsection [ ati_singlecolor ] .    in fig .",
    "[ compati ] the two - color spectra are compared with the corresponding single - color results where either the @xmath67-field or the @xmath117-field was present .",
    "the laser intensities were chosen not deep in the stabilization regime because at such high laser intensities the clear ati - structure gets corrupted by peak broadening and modulations ( cf .",
    "[ atispectra ] ) .",
    "the ati peaks in the two - color spectra are located at higher energies than those of the corresponding single - color results .",
    "this is due to the fact that the ground state in the time - averaged kh potential experiences a stronger up - shift as compared to the single - color kh potentials",
    ". it would be interesting to analyze the ati peak positions in the two - color case in the same way as it was done in sec .",
    "[ ati_singlecolor ] for single - color fields .",
    "however , to our knowledge two - color floquet energies for high - frequency , circular polarization are not yet published .     comparison of two - color photoelectron spectra ( full curve ) with the corresponding single - color results where only the @xmath67-field ( dotted ) and only the @xmath117-field ( broken ) was present , respectively .",
    "the same pulse shapes as in fig .",
    "[ atispectra ] were used .",
    "the two - color result in the left panel has been obtained with @xmath153 . in the right panel",
    "the excursion amplitudes were equal : @xmath154 . ]",
    "as far as the peak strengths are concerned the two - color spectrum is , of course , not simply the sum of the two single - color spectra : the first ati peak in the single - color @xmath128-spectrum is stronger than both , the second peak of the two - color and the single - color @xmath0-field .",
    "this is compatible with fig .",
    "[ survprobvse1e2 ] from which one infers that adding to the @xmath128-field ( whose intensity lies close to the `` death valley '' ) the lower frequency @xmath0-field suppresses ionization . in the equal-@xmath52-result",
    "the two - color spectrum is close to the single - color , low - frequency spectrum . instead",
    ", the two - color spectrum for equal @xmath70 is qualitatively different from both two single - color spectra .",
    "not only modulations appear in the two - color result which are absent in the @xmath0-spectrum but also the height of the peaks differ significantly from each other .",
    "we have studied the dynamic stabilization of atomic hydrogen against ionization in single- and two - color , circularly polarized laser pulses by solving numerically the three - dimensional , time - dependent schrdinger equation . in the single - color case we confirmed the `` hula - hoop''-like dynamics for sufficiently high excursions @xmath70 .",
    "ionization rates were compared with those from ( high - frequency ) floquet theory , and good agreement was found .",
    "the positions of above - threshold ionization ( ati ) peaks in our numerical photoelectron spectra were analyzed .",
    "it was found that the ati peaks move with increasing laser intensity towards higher energies , in contrast to what happens in intense , low - frequency fields .",
    "this behavior can be explained by the laser field - induced up - shift of the initially populated , field - free ground state .    for two - color laser fields of opposite circular polarization",
    "we presented stabilized probability density structures . for laser frequencies @xmath0 and @xmath1 , @xmath2 and sufficiently large excursion amplitudes @xmath127 distinct probability density peaks were observed , in accordance to what one expects by virtue of the two - color , time - averaged kramers - henneberger potentials . as the generalization of the well - known `` dichotomy '' in linearly polarized laser fields , we called this multiple probability density peak - splitting `` trichotomy , '' `` quatrochotomy , '' `` pentachotomy '' etc .    the survival probability after two - color pulses of frequencies @xmath67 and @xmath117 was calculated as a function of the two peak field strengths . as expected ,",
    "highest stabilization is achieved with the high - frequency field alone for a certain , optimal laser intensity . however , adding the second , low - frequency field , even if its intensity falls into the `` death valley , '' fortunately does _ not _ drastically reduce stabilization , as one might expect from a naive superposition point - of - view .",
