    "dms are semiconductors where a fraction @xmath30.01 - 0.1 ) of nonmagnetic elements is replaced by magnetic @xmath4 ions .",
    "the class of iii - v dms has recently attracted considerable attention after the experimental observation of high @xmath0 s , due to significant improvements in molecular beam epitaxy techniques .",
    "@xcite these compounds can play an important role in spintronic devices , and they represent a challenge to theory due to the combined presence of correlations and disorder .    using a one - band model for dms , ( i ) the weak - coupling quadratic dependence of @xmath0 with @xmath2 is captured correctly by dmft @xcite , which also provides bulk limit results , while ( ii ) the mc techniques on finite clusters properly handle the random mn distribution and unveiled the reduction of @xmath5 at large @xmath2 due to carrier localization.@xcite for @xmath2 comparable to the hopping @xmath6 , both techniques reached similar conclusions , showing that they can complement towards a comprehensive understanding of dms .",
    "however , much theoretical work remains to be done , particularly the consideration of the several bands active in real dms materials beyond mean field approximations.@xcite    in this paper , we study a two - band model for dms at realistic low dopings @xmath7@xmath8@xmath9 , using a combination of @xmath10 techniques that gives unique characteristics to our work . to properly analyze the intermediate and strong coupling @xmath2 regime ,",
    "mc simulations that correctly handle the random mn distribution are crucial . here , mc results for dms models including more than one band are presented for the first time.@xcite on the dmft side , pioneering calculations for two - band double - exchange hamiltonians already exist.@xcite however , those calculations focused on special cases , while our current dmft effort is more general , with two @xmath11=1/2 bands and arbitrary couplings , hoppings , and carrier densities . one of our main results is that @xmath0 can be substantially raised by considering multiband systems since at intermediate couplings the maximal @xmath0 at carrier filling @xmath1@xmath12@xmath7 is approximately twice larger than the highest @xmath5 obtained in the single - band model at filling @xmath1@xmath12@xmath13 ( note that the alternative notation @xmath14=@xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the hole density as a fraction of @xmath1 , will be used in some portions of the paper ) .",
    "the qualitative reason is that the ib cooperate to raise @xmath0 for values of the chemical potential @xmath17 where those bands partially or fully overlap.@xcite    the paper is organized as follows : section ii describes the model ; the dmft results are presented in section iii , while section iv is devoted to the monte carlo study .",
    "conclusions and final remarks are in section v.",
    "it is known that in @xmath4-doped @xmath18 , the @xmath4 ions substitute for @xmath19 cations and contribute itinerant holes to the valence band .",
    "the @xmath4 ions have a half - filled @xmath20-shell which acts as a @xmath21 local moment .",
    "due to a strong spin - orbit ( so ) interaction , the angular momentum @xmath22 of the @xmath1-like valence bands mixes with the hole spin degree of freedom @xmath23 and produces low- and high - energy bands with angular momentum @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively .",
    "a robust so split between these bands causes the holes to populate the @xmath26 state , which itself is split by the crystal field into a @xmath27 band with heavy holes and a @xmath28 band with light holes .",
    "this is the reason why we choose to study two bands since this is the relevant number of orbitals in most iii - v dms . since we do not work in a @xmath29 basis",
    "our hamiltonian does not capture the orbital mixing in the hund term.@xcite however , we roughly consider the diagonal so effects in the magnetic interactions by allowing different values of @xmath2 in the two orbitals considered .",
    "the simple two - band model for dms used here is given by the hamiltonian @xmath30 where @xmath31=1,2 is the band index ( not to be confused with angular momentum ) , @xmath32 label sites ( nearest neighbors for the hopping term ) , @xmath33 creates a hole at site @xmath34 in the band @xmath31 , @xmath35 is the spin- operator of the mobile hole ( @xmath36 = pauli vector ) , @xmath37 and @xmath38 are spin indices , @xmath39 is the coupling between the core spin and the electrons of band @xmath31 , and @xmath40 is the spin of the localized @xmath4 ion at randomly selected sites @xmath41 , assumed classical in the mc simulations .",
    "@xmath42 is the hopping term in band @xmath31 .",
    "the inter - band hopping @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) is zero at the nearest neighbor level in cubic lattices @xcite .",
    "even if @xmath43 is explicitly added , the conclusions are similar as reported here @xcite .",
    "while real dms materials have zincblende ( zb ) structures , in this first nonperturbative study of a multiband dms model the simplicity of a cubic lattice allows us to focus on the dominant qualitative tendencies , a first step toward future quantitative studies with realistic zb lattices .",
    "the model will be studied using dmft and mc techniques .",
    "within dmft the self - energy is assumed to be local , @xmath45 , assumption valid exactly only in infinite dimensions .",
    "the information about the hopping of carriers on and off lattice sites , which are magnetic ( with probability @xmath7 ) or nonmagnetic ( with probability @xmath9-@xmath7 ) , is in the bare green s function ( gf ) @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "the full gf @xmath47 can be solved by integration with the result : @xmath48^{-1 } \\rangle+(1-x)\\langle{\\mathcal{g}}_{0}(i\\omega_{n})\\rangle$ ] , where @xmath49=@xmath50 are matsubara frequencies .",
    "the average @xmath51=@xmath52 is over the local moment @xmath53 orientations , with probability @xmath54 .",
    "the equation above was derived for each band , and the equations set for the gf were solved on a bethe lattice with a bare semicircular noninteracting density of states @xmath55=@xmath56 . in this case ,",
    "@xmath57 , where @xmath58=@xmath59 , and @xmath60=@xmath61 .",
    "@xmath5 is obtained by linearizing the bare inverse gf with respect to the local order parameter @xmath62 .",
    "to first order in @xmath63 , the implicit equation for @xmath0 is :    @xmath64^{3 } + ( 48j_{l}^{2}-3w^{2}_{l})[b^{2}_{l}(i\\omega_{n})-j_{l}^{2}]^{2}-5xj_{l}^{2}w_{l}^{2}[b^{2}_{l}(i\\omega_{n})-j_{l}^{2}]-2xj_{l}^{4}w_{l}^{2}}=1,\\ ] ]    where @xmath65 satisfies a fourth - order - degree equation : @xmath66.@xcite our formula was tested in different cases : ( 1 ) for @xmath67=@xmath68 , we reproduce the one - band results of ref . , and ( 2 ) at @xmath7=1 , @xmath69=0 , and @xmath70 we reproduced the results of ref .",
    "@xmath0 , contained in the matsubara frequencies , is obtained from eq.([tc ] ) numerically .",
    "the equations for @xmath71 , rewritten in real frequency space via @xmath72 , give the interacting @xmath55 for each band at zero temperature when @xmath73.@xcite the solutions of these equations depend crucially on the ratio @xmath74 . the critical value for the formation of well - defined ib ,",
    "corresponding to carrier spins locally parallel to @xmath4 spins , is @xmath75 .",
    "below , the domain @xmath76 is referred to as ` weak coupling ' , while @xmath77 is the ` intermediate coupling ' .",
    "the most interesting physics is observed at the boundary between these two regimes , i.e. when the ib are not completely separated from the valence bands .      in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , we show @xmath0 vs. @xmath1 , for different ratios @xmath78 and at fixed @xmath79=1 and @xmath80 , situation corresponding to the existence of a well - defined @xmath31=@xmath9 ib ( although @xmath1@xmath81@xmath7 in real dms , in this paper the case @xmath1@xmath82@xmath7 will also be studied for completeness , as done in ref . ) .",
    "the inset shows the total interacting dos evolution .",
    "the ib overlap if @xmath83 .",
    "if the ib do not overlap , then each one determines @xmath5 separately , causing the double - peak structure observed for some @xmath84 ratios . the band with the largest @xmath74 is filled first , for smaller @xmath17 s .",
    "at all @xmath1 s , we found that @xmath0 is maximum when @xmath85 , namely when the ib fully overlap .",
    "the dependence of @xmath0 on @xmath78 at fixed @xmath1 is in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) .",
    "the peak value is achieved when the bands fully overlap ( i.e. at @xmath78=1 ) .",
    "once the bands decouple , the value for @xmath0 matches one - band model results .",
    "let us consider now how changes in bandwidths influence @xmath0 . in fig .",
    "[ fig2](c ) , we show @xmath0 vs. @xmath1 parametric with @xmath86 , at fixed @xmath80 ( intermediate coupling ) , and with @xmath85.@xcite at small @xmath86 the second ib shall be located in a region of @xmath87 smaller ( i.e. farther from the valence bands ) , than the energy interval occupied by the @xmath88 ib .",
    "hence , the @xmath31=2 ib will be the first to be filled .",
    "decreasing @xmath89 , the second band moves to the right on the @xmath87 axis , towards the location of the first band . while the bands are still separated , each gives its own contribution to @xmath0 .",
    "the curves with @xmath90 and @xmath91 correspond to decoupled ib , while those with @xmath92 and @xmath93 correspond to partially overlapping bands .",
    "again , @xmath0 is maximized at all fillings when the bands fully overlap ( @xmath86=@xmath9 ) , in good agreement with ref .. although @xmath86=@xmath9 is not realistic in dms , mn doping materials with a relatively small heavy - light mass ratio will favor a higher @xmath5 .",
    "once established that @xmath0 is maximal for all @xmath1 when @xmath78=@xmath9 and @xmath86=@xmath9 , let us analyze @xmath0 vs. @xmath1 when @xmath94 varies .",
    "the results for @xmath0 , and total interacting dos , are in fig.[fig3 ] . at small coupling @xmath95 , @xmath0 is small , flat , and much extended on the @xmath1 axis , qualitatively similar to the one - band results.@xcite however , at intermediate coupling , @xmath0 is nonzero in the range from @xmath96 to @xmath97 , adopting a parabolic form with the maximum at @xmath98 , in contrast with the one - band model which gives a null @xmath0 when @xmath98 .",
    "the explanation is straightforward : at @xmath99 in the one - band model the ib is fully occupied leading to a vanishing @xmath0 , but for the same @xmath1 in the two - band model both bands are half filled , which ultimately leads to the highest value for @xmath0 .",
    "the @xmath0 dependence on the ratio @xmath94 at some fillings @xmath1 is displayed in fig.[fig2](b ) . at small coupling",
    ", @xmath0 correctly increases quadratically with @xmath94 , but at strong coupling @xmath0 incorrectly continues growing , result which will be improved upon by the mc simulations shown below .",
    "the hamiltonian eq .  ( [ ham ] ) was also studied numerically using mc techniques similar to those applied to mn - oxide investigations.@xcite the fermionic sector is treated exactly , while a mc simulation is applied to the classical localized spins .",
    "cubic lattices with @xmath100 and @xmath101 sites were investigated .",
    "these lattice sizes have been shown to be sufficient for the comparison with dmft results and to unveil general trends .",
    "in addition , the figures show only small variations for the @xmath0 estimations using the two lattices .",
    "however , if more sophisticated quantitative analysis is required , clearly larger systems will be needed .",
    "one may suspect that actually the number of mn spins may regulate the size effects , rather than the number of sites .",
    "for the small values of @xmath7 used in our study , the number of mn spins is also very small and serious size effects could be expected . however , in practice this does not seem to occur , and moreover the comparison with dmft shows similar results using both techniques . perhaps in the small j s regime , the delocalized nature of the carriers smears the effects caused by the actual location of the mn spins .",
    "these issues deserve further study , but for our purposes of unveiling trends in the multi - parameter space of dms materials , the lattices here used are sufficient .    returning to the numerical data , the spin magnetization is the order parameter that was used to detect the ferromagnetic transition.@xcite all quantities are in units of @xmath102=1 , and the density of magnetic impurities is @xmath103 . in fig .",
    "4(a ) , typical magnetization curves are presented at several carrier densities @xmath14 , and for @xmath104=@xmath69=@xmath2=4 and @xmath105=@xmath9 . in excellent agreement with dmft",
    ", it was observed that the estimated @xmath5 is the highest for @xmath14=@xmath9 .",
    "the value of @xmath2 used maximizes the critical temperature , and it was confirmed that it corresponds to the case where the ib are about to become separated from the valence band . in fig .",
    "4(b ) , it is shown how @xmath5 increases with @xmath2 up to @xmath2=@xmath106 , in agreement with dmft .",
    "the strong coupling behavior is nevertheless different since @xmath5 _ decreases _ at large @xmath2 .",
    "this is caused by hole localization in strong coupling , @xcite beyond the capabilities of dmft .",
    "the dependence of @xmath5 on the ratio of band hoppings is in fig .",
    "4(c ) , varying @xmath14 .",
    "these results are again in good qualitative agreement with dmft ( fig .",
    "the maximum @xmath5 for all values of @xmath14 occurs when @xmath107=@xmath9 . however , when @xmath105 is very different from @xmath102 the development of magnetism is regulated by only one of the ib and the results are similar to those obtained with a single band model , as shown in the curves for @xmath105=@xmath108 and @xmath109 in fig",
    ".  4(c ) . for @xmath107",
    "closer to 1 , a partial overlap of the ib occurs and a hump in @xmath5 develops at @xmath14=@xmath9 ( see curve for @xmath105=@xmath93 ) .    in fig .",
    "4(d ) we show that , once @xmath107 is optimized , a similar finite @xmath2 maximizes @xmath5 for several @xmath14 s . in all cases , the optimal @xmath2 best balances the weak coupling behavior , with mobile holes not much affected by the interaction with the mn ions , and the strong coupling region where the hole spins strongly align with the mn spins , becoming localized . this `` sweet spot ''",
    "is achieved when the ib are about to be separated from the valence bands .",
    "@xmath5 vs. @xmath14 , at several ratios @xmath84 and for @xmath102=@xmath105 is presented in fig .",
    "5(a ) . in agreement with dmft ( fig .  1 )",
    ", @xmath5 is maximized for all values of @xmath14 if @xmath69=@xmath104 , with the highest value at @xmath14=@xmath9 .",
    "overall , there is an excellent agreement with dmft , as described in the caption.@xcite @xmath5 vs. @xmath14 for several @xmath104=@xmath69=@xmath2 is in fig .",
    "5(b ) . at small @xmath2 ,",
    "again the mc results resemble those obtained with dmft ( fig .  3 ) . for , e.g. ,",
    "@xmath2=@xmath110 the ib are not formed yet ( inset ) . in this regime , @xmath5 remains finite , although small , even for @xmath14 larger than 2 .",
    "increasing @xmath2 , a nonzero @xmath5 is obtained only for @xmath14 between 0 and 2 , due to ib formation .",
    "@xmath5 reaches a maximum at @xmath2=4 .",
    "we have carried out the first study of a multiband model for dms using a powerful combination of nonperturbative techniques , dmft and mc .",
    "we found the parameter regime that maximizes @xmath5 .",
    "this happens at intermediate couplings and for all hole densities when @xmath111=@xmath9 and @xmath112=@xmath9 .",
    "the maximum @xmath0 is obtained at @xmath98 , in contrast with the one - band model which has a vanishing @xmath5 at the same doping .",
    "in addition , @xmath0 at filling @xmath113 in the one - band case is smaller than with two bands by a factor @xmath1142 . in view of the simplicity of the main results ,",
    "it is clear that adding an extra band to the calculations ( which is relevant for system with negligible so , but considerably raises the cpu cost ) will only lead to a further increase in @xmath0 when all the ib overlap .",
    "the excellent agreement dmft - mc is somewhat surprising due to the fact that monte carlo considers the influence of the random location of the mn sites much better than dmft .",
    "however , at small and intermediate j s , the carriers can be sufficiently delocalized that a smearing effect may occurs and considering the quenched disorder only in average appears to be sufficient .",
    "certainly at large j s the mc and dmft methods give totally different answers , with mc capturing the correct localization result .",
    "the approach described here is also quantitative .",
    "in fact , using gaas realistic parameters such as @xmath1=@xmath115 ( @xmath16=@xmath116/mn ) , a bandwidth @xmath114 10 ev ( @xmath102@xmath117 2.5  ev ) , @xmath105=(1/9)@xmath102 , and assuming @xmath118=@xmath9 and @xmath104=@xmath69 , we obtain @xmath119 , i.e. within the experimental range .",
    "while this excellent agreement with experiment@xcite may be accidental , the trends are reliable and the result improves upon single - band estimations .",
    "moreover , for optimal @xmath107=1 and @xmath120=2 , the @xmath5 raises to @xmath121 , even at small @xmath14=0.1 , setting the upper bound for dms under a two - band model description using a cubic lattice .    the general qualitative picture presented here can be used to search for dms with even higher @xmath5 s than currently known .",
    "our results suggest that semiconductors with the smallest heavy to light hole mass ratio , such as alas , could have the highest @xmath5 if the couplings @xmath2 could be tuned to its optimal value .",
    "the present effort paves the way toward future nonperturbative studies of dms models using realistic zb lattices , and points toward procedures to further increase the curie temperatures .",
