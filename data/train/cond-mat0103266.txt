    "more than half a century ago kramers proposed a diffusion model for chemical reactions in terms of the theory of brownian motion in phase space @xcite . since then the model and several of its variants have been ubiquitous in many areas of physics , chemistry and biology for understanding the nature of activated processes in classical @xcite , quantum and semiclassical @xcite systems , in general .",
    "these have become the subject of several reviews @xcite and monograph @xcite in the recent past .    in the majority of these treatments one",
    "is essentially concerned with an equilibrium thermal bath at a finite temperature which stimulates the reaction co - ordinate to cross the activation energy barrier .",
    "the inherent noise of the medium is of internal origin .",
    "this implies that the dissipative force which the system experiences in course of its motion in the medium and the stochastic force acting on the system as a result of random impact from the constituents of the medium arise from a common mechanism . from a microscopic point of view",
    "the system - reservoir hamiltonian description @xcite developed over the decades suggests that the coupling of the system and the reservoir co - ordinates determines both the noise and the dissipative terms in the langevin equation describing the motion of the system .",
    "it is therefore not difficult to anticipate that these two entities get related through a fluctuation - dissipation relation @xcite ( these systems are sometimes classified as thermodynamically closed system in contrast to the systems driven by external noise in nonequilibrium statistical mechanics @xcite ) .",
    "however , when the reservoir is modulated by an external noise it is likely that this relation gets affected in a significant way . since the modulation of the reservoir crucially depend on its response function",
    ", one can further envisage a connection between the dissipation of the system and the response function of the reservoir due to the external noise from a microscopic point of view .    in the present paper",
    "we explore this connection in the context of activated rate processes when the reservoir is modulated by an external noise .",
    "specifically our object here is twofold : ( i ) to explore the role of reservoir response as a function of external noise on the system dynamics in contrast to direct driving of the system by external noise , ( ii ) to calculate the generalized kramers rate for the steady state of this nonequilibrium open system taking full care of thermodynamic consistency condition .",
    "both the internal and the external noises are gaussian , stationary and are characterized by arbitrary decaying correlation functions .",
    "while the internal noise of the reservoir is thermal , the external noise may be of thermal or non - thermal type .",
    "we consider the stochastic motion to be spatial diffusion limited and calculate the rate of escape in the intermediate to strong damping regime .",
    "it is worth to mention that the externally generated nonequilibrium fluctuations can bias the brownian motion of a particle in an anisotropic medium and may be used for designing molecular motors and pumps @xcite .",
    "we further mention that nonequilibrium , non - thermal systems have also been investigated phenomenologically by a number of workers in several other contexts , e.g. , for examining the role of color noise in stationary probabilities @xcite , properties of nonlinear systems @xcite , nature of crossover @xcite , rate of diffusion limited coagulation processes @xcite , effect of monochromatic noise @xcite , etc . while these treatments concern direct driving of the system by an external noise the present consideration is based on modulation of the bath",
    ". a number of different situations depicting the modulation of the bath by an external noise may be physically relevant . as ,",
    "for example , we consider a simple unimolecular conversion ( say , an isomerization reaction ) from @xmath0 .",
    "the reaction is carried out in a photochemically active solvent under the influence of external fluctuating light intensity . since the fluctuations in the light intensity result in the fluctuations in the polarization of the solvent molecules , the effective reaction field around the reactant system gets modified .",
    "provided the required stationarity of this nonequilibrium open system is maintained ( which is not difficult in view of the experiments performed in the studies of external noise - induced transitions in photochemical systems @xcite ) the dynamics of barrier crossing becomes amenable to the present theoretical analysis that follows .",
    "the remaining part of this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we discuss a system - reservoir model where the later is modulated by an external noise and establish an interesting connection between the dissipation of the system and the response function of the reservoir due to external noise .",
    "the stochastic motion in a linearized potential field is described in terms of a fokker - planck equation in sec .",
    "iii . based on the traditional flux over population method",
    "@xcite we derive in sec .",
    "iv the generalized expression for the kramers rate of escape from a metastable well . in sec .",
    "v we numerically analyze the model and the bath modulated dynamics for the full potential and verify the theoretical rate with numerical simulation .",
    "the paper is concluded in sec .",
    "we consider a classical particle of mass @xmath1 is linearly coupled to a heat bath of @xmath2 harmonic oscillators driven by an external noise .",
    "the total hamiltonian is given by @xcite @xmath3    in eq.([eq1 ] ) , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the co - ordinate and momentum of the system particle ; @xmath6 are the variables associated with the @xmath7-th oscillator and @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the corresponding frequency and mass , respectively . @xmath10",
    "measures the interaction between the particle and the bath .",
    "@xmath11 is the potential energy of the particle .",
    "@xmath12 is assumed to be of the form @xmath13    the coupling function @xmath14 measures the strength of interaction and @xmath15 is the external noise which we assume to be stationary and gaussian with zero mean , i.e. , @xmath16 and is characterized by an arbitrary correlation function as follows ; @xmath17    here @xmath18 implies the averaging over the external noise .",
    "we then eliminate the bath degrees of freedom in the usual way @xcite to obtain the following generalized langevin equation @xmath19    [ while constructing eq.([eq4 ] ) we have set @xmath1 and @xmath9 equal to unity ] where @xmath20    @xmath21 is the internal forcing function generated through the coupling between the system and the heat bath and is given by @xmath22 \\ ; \\omega_i^2 \\ ; \\cos \\omega_i t + v_i ( 0 ) \\ ; \\omega_i \\ ; \\sin \\omega_i t \\right \\ } \\ ; \\ ; .\\ ] ]    in eq.([eq4 ] ) , @xmath23 is a fluctuating force term due to the external noise @xmath15 and is given by @xmath24    where @xmath25    the form of eq.([eq4 ] ) therefore suggests that the system is driven by two forcing functions @xmath21 and @xmath23 .",
    "@xmath21 depends on the initial conditions of the bath oscillators for a fixed choice of the initial condition of the system degrees of freedom . to define the statistical properties of @xmath21",
    ", we assume that the _ initial distribution _ is one in which the bath is equilibrated at @xmath26 in the _ presence _ of the system but in the _ absence _ of the external noise agency such that @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "now , at @xmath29 , the external noise agency is switched on and the bath is modulated by @xmath15 .",
    "the system is governed by eq.([eq4 ] ) , where , apart from the internal noise @xmath21 , another fluctuating force @xmath23 appears , that depends on the external noise @xmath15 .",
    "therefore , one can define an effective noise @xmath30 whose correlation is given by @xmath31    along with @xmath32 , where @xmath33 means we have taken two averages independently .",
    "it should be emphasized that the above relation ( [ neq6 ] ) is not a fluctuation - dissipation relation due to the appearance of the external noise intensity .",
    "rather it serves as a thermodynamic consistency condition .",
    "let us now digress a little bit about @xmath23 .",
    "the statistical properties of @xmath23 are determined by the normal mode density of the bath frequencies , the coupling of the system with the bath , the coupling of the bath with the external noise and the external noise itself .",
    "eq.([eq8 ] ) is reminiscent of the familiar linear relation between the polarization and the external field where @xmath34 and @xmath35 play the role of the former and the later , respectively .",
    "@xmath36 can then be interpreted as a response function of the reservoir due to external noise @xmath15 .",
    "the very structure of @xmath23 suggests that this forcing function although originating from an external force is different from a direct driving force acting on the system .",
    "the distinction lies at the very nature of the bath characteristics ( rather than system characteristics ) as reflected in the relation ( [ eq8 ] ) and ( [ eq9 ] ) .    with the coupling coefficients @xmath37 and @xmath38 , in the continuum limit @xcite @xmath39 and @xmath36",
    "reduce to the following forms @xmath40    and @xmath41    where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are constants and @xmath44 is the cutoff frequency of the oscillator .",
    "@xmath45 is the density of modes of the heat bath .    from the above two relations , we obtain @xmath46    eq.([eq14 ] )",
    "is an important content of the present model .",
    "this expresses how the dissipative kernel @xmath39 depends on the response function @xmath36 of the medium due to external noise @xmath15 [ see eq.([eq8 ] ) ] .",
    "such a relation for the open system can be anticipated in view of the fact that both the dissipation and the response function crucially depend on the properties of the reservoir especially on its density of modes and its coupling to the system and the external noise source . in what follows we",
    "shall be concerned with the consequences of this relation in terms of the langevin description in the next section ( eq.([eq15 ] ) ) and numerical analysis of the full model potential in sec .",
    "we now consider the system to be a harmonically bound particle of unit mass and of frequency @xmath47 . then because of eq.([eq8 ] ) the langevin equation ( [ eq4 ] ) becomes @xmath48    the laplace transform of eq .",
    "( [ eq15 ] ) allows us to write a formal solution for the displacement of the form @xmath49    where we have made use of the relation ( [ eq14 ] ) explicitly .",

    "it had been shown earlier that for several models the various time dependent parameters @xmath73 , @xmath74 , etc .",
    "do exist asymptotically as @xmath75 .",
    "the above consideration shows that @xmath54 , @xmath76 , etc .",

    "we now discuss the asymptotic properties of @xmath70 and @xmath71 , which in turn are dependent on the variances @xmath77 and @xmath78 , as @xmath75 since they play a significant role in our further analysis that follows .    from eqs .",
    "( [ eq25 ] ) and ( [ eq26 ] ) , we may write @xmath79    where ` @xmath7 ' denotes the part corresponding to internal noise @xmath21 and ` @xmath80 ' corresponds to the external noise @xmath15 .",

    "we next consider the parts , @xmath91 and @xmath92 , due to the presence of the external noise .",

    "are to be calculated from the general definition ( [ eq30 ] ) for the steady state . as an explicit example we consider the case of a @xmath107-correlated external noise and ornstein - uhlenbeck internal noise for which we provide the expressions for variances",
    "@xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath108 and the relaxation function @xmath54 given in the appendix - a",

    "the solution ( [ eq32 ] ) can be verified by direct substitution .",
    "the distribution ( [ eq32 ] ) is not an equilibrium distribution .",
    "this stationary distribution for the nonequilibrium open system plays the role of an equilibrium distribution of the closed system which may , however , be recovered in the absence of external noise term .",
    "we now turn to the problem of decay of a metastable state . in kramers",
    "approach @xcite , the particle coordinate @xmath4 corresponds to the reaction coordinate and its values at the minima of the potential @xmath11 denotes the reactant and product states .    linearizing the motion around barrier top at @xmath112 the langevin equation ( [ eq4 ] )",
    "can be written down as @xmath113    where , @xmath114 and the barrier frequency @xmath115 is defined by @xmath116    correspondingly the motion of the particle is governed by the fokker - planck equation ( [ eq29 ] ) @xmath117    where , the suffix ` @xmath118 ' indicates that all the coefficients are to be calculated using the general definition ( [ eq30 ] ) for the barrier top region .",
    "it is apparent from eqs.([eq31 ] ) and ( [ eq36 ] ) that since the dynamics is non - markovian and the system is thermodynamically open one has to deal with the renormalized frequencies @xmath119 and @xmath120 near the bottom or top of the well , respectively .",
    "we make the ansatz that the nonequilibrium , steady state probability @xmath121 , generating a nonvanishing diffusion current @xmath122 , across the barrier is given by @xmath123 \\ ; \\xi ( x , v)\\ ] ]    where @xmath124    @xmath125 is the renormalized linear potential as @xmath126    with @xmath103 , @xmath127 .",
    "the unknown function @xmath128 obeys the natural boundary condition that for @xmath129 , @xmath128 vanishes .",
    "the ansatz of the form ( [ eq37 ] ) denoting the steady state distribution is motivated by the local analysis near the bottom and the top of the barrier in the kramers sense @xcite . for a stationary nonequilibrium system , on the other hand , the relative population of the two regions , in general , depends on the global properties of the potential leading to an additional factor in the rate expression .",
    "although because of the kramers type ansatz @xcitewhich is valid for the local analysis , such a consideration is outside the scope of the present treatment , we point out a distinctive feature in the ansatz ( [ eq37 ] ) compared to kramers ansatz . while in the latter case one considers a complete factorization of the equilibrium part ( boltzmann ) and the dynamical part , the ansatz ( [ eq37 ] ) incorporates the additional dynamical contribution through dissipation and strength of the noise into the exponential part .",
    "this modification of kramers ansatz ( by dynamics ) is due to nonequilibrium nature of the system .",
    "thus unlike kramers , the exponential factors in ( [ eq37 ] ) and in the stationary distribution ( [ eq32 ] ) which serves as a boundary condition are markedly different . before carrying out global analysis in the present section our aim here",
    "is to understand the modification of the rate due to modulation of the bath driven by an external noise , within the perview of kramers type ansatz .",
    "the internal consistency of the treatment , however , can be checked by recovering the kramers result when the external noise is switched off .    from equation ( [ eq36 ] ) , using ( [ eq37 ] )",
    "we obtain the equation for @xmath130 in the steady state in the neighborhood of @xmath131 , the equation @xmath132",

    "we point out that the subscripts ` @xmath143 ' and ` @xmath118 ' in @xmath144 and @xmath145 refer to the well or barrier top region , respectively .",
    "eq.([eq54 ] ) is one of the key results of this paper .",
    "we note here that @xmath146 in the exponential factor defines a new _ effective _ temperature characteristic of the steady state of the nonequilibrium open system and an _ effective _ transmission factor is contained in the prefactor controlling the barrier crossing dynamics .",
    "as expected both are the functions of the external noise strength @xmath144 and coupling of noise to the bath modes .",
    "the dependence of the rate on the parameters can be exposed explicitly once we consider the typical cases .",
    "we first explore the distinctive aspects of the external noise - driven - reservoir - modulated dynamics of the system ( in contact with the external noise driven bath ) in contrast to direct driving of the system by the external noise .",
    "this will help us to elucidate the special role of the reservoir response function in controlling the rate . to this end",
    "we first return to our basic equation of the model , eq.([eq4 ] ) where @xmath147 as given by eq.([eq9 ] ) characterizes the response function .",
    "we solve this equation numerically using second order stochastic algorithm of fox @xcite for the full potential @xmath148 and plot the results of computation of the inverse of the mean first passage time as a function of the damping constant @xmath149 ( see eq.([eq12 ] ) ) in fig.(1 ) .",
    "the density of modes of the bath has been assumed to be of the standard lorentzian form , @xmath150 with vanishing internal correlation time @xmath151 .",
    "typically for the other scaled parameters we have used @xmath152 = 0.1 , the strength of the @xmath107-correlated external noise , @xmath144 = 0.1 .",
    "the mean first passage times have been calculated by averaging over 10000 trajectories .",
    "we first show the continuous curve in fig.(1 ) which represents the case of direct driving by the external @xmath107-correlated noise .",
    "what is immediately apparent is the loss of turnover of the rate as one allows the variation of the dissipation constant @xmath149 from low to high friction regime .",
    "this is in sharp contrast to what is shown by the dotted curve in fig.(1 ) which depicts the situation of bath modulation with the response function @xmath147 determined by eq.([eq13 ] ) .",
    "both the curves ( continuous and dotted ) representing the open system are compared to that for the standard kramers turnover , i.e. , when the dynamics is calculated in absence of the external noise ( dashed curve ) .",
    "as expected the rate in the driven system ( be it directly or through bath modulation ) is always higher that in the undriven one .",
    "fig.(1 ) also shows that although in the low damping region the direct driving causes a much higher rate , it is , however , the bath modulation which becomes more effective in inducing activated barrier crossing in the high friction regime .",
    "it is thus interesting to note that the barrier crossing dynamics of the system in contact with an external noise modulated bath captures the essential turnover features of the kramers dynamics of the closed system .",
    "we therefore realize that although open , the nature of the response function of the reservoir as well as the thermodynamic consistency condition ( [ neq6 ] ) , make the open system feel like a closed system .    in fig.(2 )",
    "we show the variation of inverse of the mean first passage time as a function of the strength of the external noise @xmath144 , keeping all other parameter same as before but for @xmath149 = 2.0 .",
    "it is apparent that the barrier crossing is more facilitated by modulating the bath than driving the system directly for higher values of external noise strength .",
    "so far we have considered the full potential @xmath148 and vanishingly small correlation times for external and internal noises for numerical computation .",
    "we now turn to our basic theoretical result eq.([eq54 ] ) which is a generalization of kramers rate for bath modulated dynamics for intermediate to strong damping regime . to examine its validity",
    "we calculate the rate ( [ eq54 ] ) as a function of the damping constant @xmath149 ( @xmath42 is related to both @xmath39 and @xmath36 in eqs.([eq12 ] ) and ( [ eq13 ] ) respectively ) for several values of external noise strength @xmath144 .",
    "the scaled barrier height @xmath137 and @xmath152 have been set to 0.25 and 0.1 , respectively .",
    "the results are plotted in fig.(3 ) ( continuous curve ) and compared to the rate , inverse of the mean first passage time ( dotted curve ) calculated numerically using full potential for the set of parameter values ( as given in the earlier subsection ) with eq.([eq4 ] ) . in figs.(4 ) and ( 5 ) we further compare our theoretical results ( continuous curve ) with numerical simulation ( dotted curve ) for the variation of rate as a function of external noise strength and its correlation time , respectively for several values of damping constant .",
    "it is apparent from figs.(3 - 5 ) that the theoretical and numerical results are in good agreement .",
    "based on a system - reservoir microscopic model where the reservoir is modulated by an external , stationary and gaussian noise with arbitrary decaying correlation function , we have numerically analyzed the model and generalized the kramers theory to calculate the steady state rate of escape from a metastable well .",
    "the main conclusions of this study are as follows ;    \\(i ) we have shown that since the reservoir is driven by the external noise and the dissipative properties of the system depend on the reservoir , a simple connection between the dissipation and the response function of the medium due to the external noise can be established .",
    "this connection is important for realizing an effective temperature of the reservoir characterizing the stationary state of the thermodynamically open system , as well as an _ effective transmission factor _ controlling the rate .",
    "both of these quantities depend on the strength and correlation time of the external noise .",
    "\\(ii ) many of the earlier treatments of the rate concern direct ( phenomenological ) driving of the system and did not emphasize the question of thermodynamic consistency in the context of open systems .",
