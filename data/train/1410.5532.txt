    "exploration of unresolved problems in the atmospheric neutrino sector is the principal goal of the proposed iron calorimeter ( ical ) @xcite detector at the india - based neutrino observatory ( ino ) @xcite .",
    "apart from making accurate measurements of neutrino mixing parameters using muon neutrinos and anti - neutrinos , separately , it will address the mass hierarchy problem .",
    "the atmospheric muon neutrinos ( @xmath5 ) interact with nucleons through charged current ( cc ) and neutral current ( nc ) interactions . in the cc interaction of a neutrino with a target nucleon",
    "the final state has the corresponding lepton and hadrons but in a nc interaction the in - elastically scattered neutrino is accompanied by hadrons . due to the presence of a neutrino in the final state of nc interaction",
    "this process is difficult to use for getting information about the incoming neutrino . on the other hand in the cc interaction with a muon in the final state the energy and direction of the incoming neutrino",
    "can be extracted by combining the energy and momenta of the muon and the hadrons . as presented in fig.1 @xcite",
    "the flux of the atmospheric neutrinos is 10 times higher up to 10  gev than below it at the ino site .",
    "so ical is mainly looking for neutrino with energy up to 10  gev for physics studies . by considering the energy loss of muon in 56  mm thick iron plate",
    ", typically a muon of energy from @xmath7 to few tev will be able to measured by the ical detector .",
    "the ical detector will consist of 3 modules , each weighing about 17  ktons and having dimensions of @xmath8 @xmath9 .",
    "the detector will consist of alternate layers of soft iron of thickness 56  mm and glass resistive plate chambers ( rpcs ) about @xmath10 in dimensions placed in inter - layer gaps of 40  mm .",
    "the rpc gives x- and y- information corresponding to the ionization produced by any charged particle , such as a muon , passing through the detector .",
    "this is derived from the electrical signal induced by the passage of the charged particle , due to the multiplication of charge on account of the high electric field applied between the anode and cathode , on the pick - up strips of @xmath83  cm width placed on either side of rpc and orthogonal to each other .",
    "since the rpc will be operated in the avalanche mode the signal rise - time is @xmath81  nsec . in a cc interaction of the muon neutrino",
    "the outgoing muon track is derived from the x and y hit information of the rpcs and the upward or downward direction is obtained by using the time information from the detector .",
    "typically the time difference @xmath11 between consecutive rpc layers of @xmath89.6  cm and by considering the zenith angle from @xmath12 is between @xmath13 to @xmath14 . in general 5 - 3",
    "minimum number of rpc layers and with strip multiplicities 1 - 3 for consecutive strips are used to generate a trigger . in this paper",
    "we report the results of a study of the pixel - wise time response of the 1  m@xmath15 glass rpcs to seek a possible improvement in time resolution . by correcting for the effect of propagation delay in the cable and in the pick - up panel the time resolution",
    "is improved to @xmath16 1  nsec .",
    "however in a few cases there is no significant change .",
    "these results will help in significantly improving on the extraction of the directionality of muons produced in cc interactions of @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "+ @xmath17 + @xmath5 + @xmath6 as a function of neutrino energy at the ino site.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]",
    "the rpc is a gaseous detector composed of two parallel electrodes made of float glass with a volume resistivity of about @xmath18 @xmath19 .",
    "the two electrodes of 3  mm thickness , are held 2  mm apart by means of suitable spacers .",
    "high voltage is applied to the outer surfaces of the glass plates which are coated with graphite having an area resistivity of @xmath8 1 @xmath20 .",
    "the gas mixture of freon ( 95.15@xmath21 ) , iso - butane ( 4.51@xmath21 ) and @xmath22 ( 0.34@xmath21 ) , and the suitable applied voltage enables the detector to operate in the avalanche mode . as the electrode is of high resistance glass the spark discharges within a limited area .",
    "a stack consisting of 12 rpc detectors of dimensions ( @xmath1 ) installed at tifr has been working for more than 10 years .",
    "each 1  m  @xmath23  1  m rpc has 32 parallel pick - up strips on each side laid orthogonally .",
    "these x , y signal strips map the zone of interaction in a rpc detector .",
    "the detector efficiencies are above @xmath24 @xcite as measured using cosmic - ray muons .",
    "apart from assessing the long term performance of rpcs , it has also been used to make measurements on the cosmic muon flux @xcite .",
    "such detectors of @xmath10 size will be used in large numbers in the flagship experiment to make measurements on atmospheric muon neutrinos using a magnetised iron calorimeter at the india - based neutrino observatory .",
    "the information one needs from the stack are the event time , co - ordinates of the interaction zone , its relative time of interaction in the detector with respect to event trigger and the status of the detector . due to the avalanche mode of operation of the detector",
    "the signal strength is of the order of few mv .",
    "the necessary amplification of the signal , from a pick - up strip has been done using a two stage cascading amplifier with a gain of @xmath880 .",
    "the amplified output is fed to an analog discriminator cum analog front end ( afe ) with a voltage threshold at -20  mv .",
    "then the afe output is fed to digital front end board ( dfe ) .",
    "each individual strip signal is stretched to 720  nsec as the trigger signal arriving at dfe is delayed due to the longer signal path .",
    "the pre - trigger signals from afe are used to form level  1 signals which are further used for generation of an event trigger in a camac based data acquisition ( daq ) system . to generate a triggered event ,",
    "these level 1 ecl signals from different layers are fed to a coincidence module via an ecl to nim converter module .",
    "data in the dfe board is latched and the tdc data is also stored for every trigger .",
    "the scalar is used to monitor the strip count rate irrespective of the trigger signal .",
    "all required control signals for event and monitoring processes routed to dfes via the control and data router  ( cdr ) board are initiated by the control module .",
    "event data is transferred serially to the readout board .",
    "the daq system has been optimised for the vme format and the details are presented in ref.@xcite .",
    "the detector time resolution is one of the criteria to judge the quality of a detector with respect to its response to minimum ionizing charged particles .",
    "so the time resolution describes quantitatively how precisely the time at which a particle crossed the detector can be determined . in this paper",
    "the time distribution is characterised by a gaussian with the parameters sigma(@xmath25 ) centered around a time @xmath26 , where the time distribution is parametrized as @xmath27 @xmath28 .",
    "the overall time resolution of a detector arises from , + 1 . the fluctuation or spread in the time response of the detector , + 2 .",
    "contribution from the electronics ( pre - amplifier and readout system which include time - walk and time - jitter ) , and + 3 .",
    "the time measurement device such as time to digital converter(tdc ) .    for a detector with high signal - to - noise ratio",
    "the time jitter is much smaller than the rise time , where as due to the different amplitudes there is a shift in the timing signal due to the use of leading edge discriminator termed as time - walk .",
    "this difference in amplitude arises from the avalanche process as well as the variation in attenuation of the signal due to the position dependent signal propagation path length through the pick - up panel depending on the point of induction in the detector .",
    "figure 2 shows a schematic diagram of the detector .",
    "figure 2 ( left ) shows possible hits of muons triggering a single x - strip at 3 locations in y giving rise to 3 signal times @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "they have different propagation delays corresponding to their propagation distances ( see sec . 4 ) .",

    "it is obtained with irrespective of the position of the hit point in the detector which results in a long tail @xcite .",

    "32 strips are divided in to 8 groups .",
    "so each group has 4 strips .",
