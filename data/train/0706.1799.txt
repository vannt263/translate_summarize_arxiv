    "r0.5        following the successful bfkl @xcite parametrisation of the forward - jet cross - section @xmath0 at leading order ( lo ) at hera @xcite , it is possible to perform a similar study using next - to - leading ( nll ) resummed bfkl kernels .",
    "this method can be used for forward jet production at hera in particular , provided one takes into account the proper symmetric _ two - scale _ feature of the forward - jet problem , whose scales are in this case @xmath1 for the lepton vertex and @xmath2 for the jet vertex . in this short report , we will only discuss the phenomelogical aspects and all detailed calculations can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite for forward jets at hera and in ref .",
    "@xcite for mueller navelet jets at the tevatron and the lhc .",
    "we perform a saddle point approximation of the bfkl nll formalism and compare it with the h1 forward jet cross section measurements .",
    "the bfkl nll @xcite formalism reads : @xmath3 with @xmath4 where the saddle point equation is @xmath5 .",
    "the effective kernels @xmath6 are obtained from the nll kernel by solving the implicit equation : @xmath7 the values of @xmath8 are taken at nll @xcite using different resummation schemes to remove spurious singularities defined as ccs , s3 and s4 @xcite .",
    "contrary to ll bfkl , it is worth noticing that the coupling constant @xmath9 is taken using the renormalisation group equations , the only free parameter in the fit being the normalisation .",
    "one difficulty arises while fitting h1 @xmath10 data @xcite : we need to integrate the differential cross section on the bin size in @xmath11 , @xmath12 ( the momentum fraction of the proton carried by the forward jet ) , @xmath13 ( the jet transverse momentum ) , while taking into account the experimental cuts . to avoid numerical difficulties , we choose to perform the integration on the bin using the variables where the cross section does not change rapidly , namely @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 .",
    "experimental cuts are treated directly at the integral level ( the cut on @xmath17 for instance ) or using a toy monte carlo .",
    "more detail can be found about the fitting procedure in appendix a of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the nll fits @xcite can nicely describe the h1 data @xcite for the s4 scheme ( @xmath18 per degree of freedom with statistical errors only ) whereas the s3 and ccs schemes show higher @xmath19 .",
    "( @xmath20 and @xmath21 respectively with statistical errors only ) the fit @xmath19 are good for all schemes if one considers statistical and systematics errors added in quadrature @xcite .",
    "the dglap nlo calculation fails to describe the h1 data at lowest @xmath22 ( see fig .",
    "1 ) .    the h1 collaboration also measured the forward jet triple differential cross section @xcite and the results are given in fig .",
    "the bfkl ll formalism leads to a good description of the data when @xmath23 is close to 1 and deviates from the data when @xmath24 is further away from 1 .",
    "this effect is expected since dglap radiation effects are supposed to occur when the ratio between the jet @xmath13 and the virtual photon @xmath11 are further away from 1 .",
    "the bfkl nll calculation including the @xmath11 evolution via the renormalisation group equation leads to a good description of the h1 data on the full range .",
    "we note that the higher order corrections are small when @xmath25 , when the bfkl effects are supposed to dominate .",
    "by contrast , they are significant as expected when @xmath24 is different from one , ie when dglap evolution becomes relevant .",
    "we notice that the dglap nlo calculation fails to describe the data when @xmath25 , or in the region where bfkl resummation effects are expected to appear .",
    "r0.5        mueller navelet jets are ideal processes to study bfkl resummation effects @xcite . two jets with a large interval in rapidity and with similar tranverse momenta are considered . a typical observable to look for bfkl effects",
    "is the measurement of the azimuthal correlations between both jets .",
    "the dglap prediction is that this distribution should peak towards @xmath26 - ie jets are back - to - bacl- whereas multi - gluon emission via the bfkl mechanism leads to a smoother distribution .",
    "the relevant variables to look for azimuthal correlations are the following : @xmath27 the azimuthal correlation for bfkl reads : @xmath28 where in the nll bfkl framework , @xmath29 and @xmath30 is the effective resummed kernel .",
    "computing the different @xmath31 at nll for the resummation schemes s3 and s4 allowed us to compute the azimuthal correlations at nll . as expected , the @xmath32 dependence is less flat than for bfkl ll and is closer to the dglap behaviour @xcite . to illustrate this result",
    ", we give in fig .",
    "3 the azimuthal correlation in the cdf acceptance .",
    "the cdf collaboration installed the mini - plugs calorimeters aiming for rapidity gap selections in the very forward regions and these detectors can be used to tag very forward jets .",
    "a measurement of jet @xmath33 with these detectors would not be possible but their azimuthal segmentation allows a @xmath34 measurement . in fig .",
    "2 , we display the jet azimuthal correlations for jets with a @xmath35 gev and @xmath366 , 8 , 10 and 11 . for @xmath3611",
    ", we notice that the distribution is quite flat , which would be a clear test of the bfkl prediction .",
    "similar measurements are possible at the lhc and predictions can be found in ref .",
