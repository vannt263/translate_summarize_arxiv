    "it is well known that bosons at sufficiently low temperatures tend to form bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) , which essentially consist on the macroscopic population of a single - particle state  @xcite . in absence of interactions ,",
    "the macroscopically occupied state is the lowest energy state of the single - particle hamiltonian .",
    "when the interatomic interactions are taken into account , and for sufficiently large number of atoms , the main effect is a broadening of the single - particle state , which can be accounted for by a mean - field gross - pitaevskii description . in the onsager - penrose picture , in a bec",
    "there is only one eigenvalue of the one - body density matrix which is of the order of the total number of particles .",
    "this is the largest eigenvalue and is termed the `` condensed fraction '' .",
    "in contrast , an interesting scenario appears when , in absence of interactions , the lowest single - particle states are degenerate . in this case",
    ", the many - body ground state may get fragmented  @xcite , as naively the atoms have no reason to condense in only one of the degenerate single - particle states .",
    "this implies that a finite number of eigenvalues of the single - particle density matrix are of order of the total number of atoms .    in ref .",
    "@xcite the authors describe three notable physical examples which produce fragmented condensates , e.g. the highly correlated regime in ultracold gases subjected to synthetic gauge fields , the two - site hubbard model and the ground state of a spinor condensate in absence of quadractic zeeman terms . in the first two cases , interactions need to dominate over tunnelling terms in order to get fragmentation .",
    "for instance , for atoms in the double - well it is in the strongly repulsive regime that the condensate fragments in two parts , with half the atoms populating each well . by increasing the potential barrier between the wells , the system enters into the fock regime ( interaction energy dominating over the tunnelling ) and fragments in two becs of equal number of particles .",
    "this has been realized experimentally  @xcite .",
    "notably , the quantum many - body correlations present in fragmented states can find applications in the field of quantum metrology to improve precision measurements  @xcite , and hold promise of being useful in near future technological applications  @xcite .",
    "it is desirable to pin down quantum many - body systems which feature fragmentation even at the single - particle level without explicit spatial separation . in this article",
    "we consider a minimal system which fulfills this , and which therefore has fragmented ground states both in absence of atom - atom interactions or for small ones .",
    "we consider @xmath1 identical bosons populating three single - particle states .",
    "the bosons are assumed to be able to tunnel between the different states .",
    "there are two options that are available with current techniques",
    ". the first one would be to trap the atoms in a triple - well potential , with fully connected sites as in  @xcite , or aligned  @xcite . in this case , the three quantum states are the three eigenstates of the single - particle hamiltonian , which are thus spatially localised .",
    "a second option is to consider three different internal states of the boson as single - particle states , with the whole cloud being trapped on the same harmonic potential .",
    "transitions among the three internal states can be induced by means of rabi coupling . in this case , the three quantum states are not spatially localised .",
    "these two cases may be referred to as external or internal , three - mode systems .",
    "the properties of such triple - well potentials have been studied previously exploring the effect of dipolar interaction in the system  @xcite , the many - body properties of the system  @xcite or the melting of vortex states  @xcite .    in the previous studies ,",
    "the coupling between the different modes is provided by the quantum tunnelling between the spatially localised modes .",
    "this has hindered the exploration of the regime we discuss in the present article .",
    "namely , we will consider triangular setups in which one of the tunnelling terms can be taken negative .",
    "this means that a particle tunnelling from one site to the next one acquires a phase of @xmath0 .",
    "thus , we consider cases when a particle acquires either 0 or @xmath0 phase when tunnelling around the triangle in absence of interactions . the key idea is to consider systems where tunnelling can be detuned  @xcite and particularly profit from the recent advances in producing phase dependent tunnelling terms .",
    "for external modal configurations , an external shaking of the system along one direction effectively results in a dressed tunnelling term whose sign can be switched from positive ( standard ) values to negative ( @xmath0-phase tunnelling )  @xcite .",

    ", they can be different sites , e.g. an ultracold gas confined in a triple - well potential , or three internal states of the atoms .",
    "for the time being , we will restrict our system to the former case .",
    "we consider tunnelling terms between the three sites , and a tunable rate between two of them .",
    "this tunable rate will allow us to explore colinear configurations , closed ones , and also configurations with @xmath0 phase .",

    "our study will concentrate mostly on the repulsive interaction case , which is more prone to be experimentally explored with current setups .",
    "we will also discuss briefly the attractive interaction case .",
    "in the latter even small asymmetries in the external trapping potentials will eventually have a large impact on the properties of the ground state  @xcite .",
    "thus , we will introduce small symmetry breaking terms , compared to both the tunnelling and interaction , to consider situations closer to experimental ones and also to control numerically the degeneracies in the problem .",

    "the considered hamiltonian now reads :    @xmath26      the system is studied through direct diagonalisation of the many - body hamiltonian for a fixed number of atoms , @xmath1 .",

    "it is worth stressing that a coherent state as the one defined above corresponds to a fully condensed atomic cloud .",
    "the fragmentation properties of the ultracold atomic gas  @xcite can be investigated by means of the eigenvalues of the one - body density matrix . in our system with @xmath1 bosons and three different modes ,",
    "the one - body density matrix of a many - body state @xmath39 is a @xmath40 matrix whose elements are ,    @xmath41    with @xmath42 .",

    "it is interesting to calculate its eigenvectors ( natural orbitals ) , @xmath45 , and eigenvalues , @xmath46 , with @xmath47 , that satisfy @xmath48 .",
    "each eigenvalue of the one - body density matrix gives the relative occupation number of the corresponding natural orbital : @xmath49 . in a singly condensed system , there is only one large eigenvalue that corresponds to the condensed fraction of the single - particle state , @xmath50 : @xmath51 and @xmath52 , with all the other eigenvalues @xmath53 ( @xmath54 ) being small @xmath55 . instead a fragmented system has more than one large eigenvalue , @xmath56 , with @xmath57 , and the rest of eigenvalues @xmath53 ( @xmath58 ) are small @xmath55 .",
    "in this situation the system is not fully condensed , but fragmented , quantum correlations become important and the mean - field approximation fails to describe the system .",

    "the schmidt spectrum fulfills @xmath69 , and contains information about the correlations and the entanglement properties of the state in subsystem @xmath14 with respect to the rest of the system .",
    "it is worth recalling that a many - body state is entangled when it can not be written as a product state . in the case of spatially separated modes ,",
    "the entanglement we are discussing is spatial .    a measure of the entanglement between the two subsystems is already provided by the single - site von neumann entropy , which can be computed as @xmath70 .",

    "a signature of the entanglement on the schmidt spectrum is the following one : if site @xmath14 is not entangled with sites @xmath15 and @xmath16 , it should be pure after tracing those sites out , and then the entanglement spectrum would be @xmath73 and @xmath74 for @xmath75 .",
    "this actually implies a zero of the corresponding von neumann entropy .",

    "the schmidt gap takes its maximum value of 1 .",
    "a vanishing of the schmidt gap marks large entanglement between the subsystems . as has been recently pointed out in ref .",

    "note that no relation exists between fragmentation and entanglement , in the sense that a system can be entangled and fragmented independently .",
