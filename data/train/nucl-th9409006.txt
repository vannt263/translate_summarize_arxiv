    "in a recent lattice qcd study of su(3 ) pure gauge theory @xcite the plaquette ",
    "plaquette correlation functions were measured at high temperatures . below the deconfinement transition temperature ( @xmath6 mev ) the observed exponential fall  off of those correlators was used to determine the mass spectrum of glueballs . above @xmath7 the two lowest masses deduced from the decay of the correlators were interpreted as twice the electric and magnetic screening mass in the gluon plasma . the interesting result reported in @xcite that we focus on is the claim that just above the critical temperature , @xmath8 , the magnetic screening mass , @xmath9 , is apparently twice as large as the electric screening mass , @xmath10 .",
    "our interest in these results stems from the sensitivity of certain transport properties and hence signatures of quark  gluon plasmas produced in ultrarelativistic nuclear collisions @xcite to the ratio of these screening masses .",
    "in ref.@xcite it was shown that the color relaxation time in a plasma is @xmath11^{-1}~,\\ ] ] where @xmath12 as @xmath13 .",
    "this time scale controls the lifetime of collective color excitations in the plasma such as the plasmon .",
    "also next  to  leading  order corrections to the electric screening mass depend self ",
    "consistently on the ratio @xmath14 @xcite . in lowest order perturbation theory , @xmath15^{1/2}$ ] while @xmath16 @xcite . the infrared magnetic singularities in higher orders",
    "are however expected @xcite to produce a non  perturbative @xmath17 . in the weak  coupling limit ( @xmath18 ) ,",
    "@xmath19 , and there is a natural ordering of the screening scales , @xmath20 .",
    "however , at @xmath21 , @xmath22 @xcite , and the measured screening masses imply a reversal of that perturbative ordering . since the temperatures accessible via nuclear collisions are of the order of @xmath23 , this inverse ordering of screening scales could have important phenomenological implications .",
    "for example , it implies a higher color conductivity which in turn could decrease the produced transverse energy and the dilepton rate @xcite .",
    "the screening masses are also of general interest as another test of the viability of the perturbative picture of the quark  gluon plasma . on the one hand , the lattice entropy density @xcite , color electric screening mass @xcite , baryon susceptibility @xcite , and spatial dependence of higher mass meson and baryon correlators @xcite are all consistent with the perturbative picture of the quark  gluon plasma , even near @xmath7 . on the other hand ,",
    "the temperature dependence of the energy density and pressure deviate strongly from the ideal stephan  boltzmann behavior up to several times @xmath7 @xcite , the decay of the scalar and pseudoscalar meson correlation functions can not be reconciled with free propagation of the @xmath24pair @xcite , and @xmath25wavefunctions behave as if the quarks were strongly bound @xcite .",
    "the recent measurement @xcite of @xmath26 poses a further problem for the perturbative picture of the gluon plasma .",
    "how can static color magnetic fields be screened on such a small distance scale ? in a magnetic screening volume @xmath27 there is less than 1/2 gluon on the average in the perturbative picture .",
    "perturbative mechanisms , such as a very dense color magnetic monopole gas , would have to exist to account for that large a magnetic screening mass .",
    "however , there appears to be no consistent effective qcd action that could generate such a monopole gas @xcite .    in this work",
    "we aim to clarify how the lattice results of @xcite above @xmath7 may translate into continuum physics . to this end",
    "we assume that the lattice spacing is small enough to allow the plaquette correlators to be related to energy density correlators .",
    "the latter can be decomposed into multi ",
    "gluon exchange diagrams .",
    "we furthermore assume that the dominant contribution is given by the exchange of two dressed gluons . according to standard arguments",
    ", this would give rise to a decay of the correlator governed by twice the gluon screening mass , in agreement with the interpretation the authors of @xcite have provided for their results .",
    "we first investigate the two  gluon exchange diagram in the interaction ",
    "free case to provide better insight on the screened case to be discussed subsequently . for distances",
    "@xmath28 , i.e. , on momentum scales where temperature effects are negligible , the correlators behave @xmath29 , as expected from dimensional arguments . for @xmath30 this behavior is changed to a decay @xmath31 due to finite temperature effects .",
    "then we study the effect of self  energy insertions .",
    "we show that the structure of the electric correlator is considerably more complex than that of the magnetic since the former mixes the longitudinal and transverse polarization effects . in both cases , for @xmath32 the correlators are found to be dominated by the power  law behavior encountered in the interaction  free case and not by the exponential decay expected for gluons with a finite screening mass .",
    "we then calculate the correlators on a lattice in the weak  coupling limit and show that the continuum limit is well approximated on a @xmath33lattice .",
    "consequently , the power  law behavior is still prominent @xcite and leads to an overestimate of the masses deduced from conventional exponential ",
    "type fit functions . the power  law behavior is caused by the point source and sink of the correlator .",
    "however , in @xcite fuzzed links @xcite were used which have the effect of `` smearing '' out the sources and sinks and partially remove the power ",
    "law enhancement at small distances .",
    "we introduce a model for fuzzed links which incorporates the smearing and show that the relative residual error in determining the screening masses indeed becomes small if the latter are large compared to @xmath1 . however , for a _ vanishing _ screening mass this fuzzing model still leads to an apparent _ finite _ mass .",
    "in fact , we show that the current lattice data @xcite may even be consistent with a vanishing magnetic screening mass  !",
    "the screening masses obtained from energy density correlators are therefore inconclusive and require confirmation from an independent measurement of e.g.  the gluon propagator @xcite .",
    "the remaining sections are organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we review in more detail the results of ref .",
    "@xcite and relate them to our investigations . in section 3 the energy density correlators are decomposed in terms of multi  gluon exchange .",
    "section 4 comprises a discussion of the interaction ",
    "free case . in section 5",
    "we discuss the correlators for dressed gluons .",
    "section 6 is devoted to the transcription of the perturbative continuum results onto the lattice . in section 7",
    "we investigate a model for fuzzed links and their effect on the extraction of screening masses .",
    "we use natural units @xmath34 and , except for section 6 and 7 , the minkowski metric @xmath35 .",
    "this implies @xmath36 and @xmath37 , with the gluonic matsubara frequencies @xmath38 .",
    "in the perturbative picture of a quark  gluon plasma as a weakly interacting system , @xmath25 ( or meson ) correlators are essentially given by a single @xmath25loop , since the mutual interaction between the quark and the antiquark is screened by the hot environment .",
    "also , a quark acquires a dynamical mass @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "the correlator is roughly proportional to the square of the ( dressed ) quark propagator @xcite . for ( large ) spatial distances ,",
    "the decay of the latter is governed by the lowest fermionic `` energy '' @xmath40^{1/2}$ ] ( @xmath41 being the smallest fermionic matsubara frequency ) . since @xmath42",
    "we may neglect the quark mass as compared to the matsubara frequency @xcite and the spatial meson correlator decays like @xmath43 @xcite . after correcting for lattice artefacts ,",
    "the lattice data for vector and axial vector meson are found to be in good agreement with this picture @xcite .",
    "the scalar / pseudoscalar channel is , however , an important exception in that it only decays @xmath44 .",
    "this points towards a strong residual interaction in this channel , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "however , as the study of @xmath45wavefunctions has revealed @xcite , _ even _ in the vector channel the quark ",
    "antiquark pair may be strongly bound .",
    "the reason why the corresponding binding energy does not show up in the mass extracted from the correlator is the same why we could neglect the quark mass in our above consideration : it is negligible as compared to @xmath46 which originates from the lowest fermionic matsubara frequency @xcite .",
    "it is therefore difficult to extract either the residual interaction effects or dynamical quark masses from spatial @xmath25correlation functions @xcite .    in view of this",
    ", the study of glueballs is of special interest : since the lowest matsubara frequency for gluons is zero , the measurement of glueball correlators is not impaired by the above mentioned effect .",
    "they may thus provide more detailed information on residual interactions and the gluon screening mass . in @xcite",
    "the irreducible representations for the glueball states on the lattice were identified and their masses measured via the decay of the corresponding spatial correlation functions @xcite . it was found that above @xmath7 the lowest mass state no longer corresponds to a glueball with definite quantum numbers . rather , it belongs to the ( connected ) correlator between plaquette operators of the form @xmath47 where @xmath48\\ ] ] is the elementary temporal plaquette with two spatial links @xmath49 and two temporal links @xmath50 , @xmath51 with @xmath52 , and the generators of su(@xmath0 ) @xmath53 .",
    "the lattice spacing @xmath54 is a dynamical quantity in the sense that it decreases with decreasing coupling @xmath55 according to the qcd @xmath56function @xcite .",
    "since @xmath55 decreases with increasing temperature , at sufficiently high @xmath1 the lattice spacing should be small enough to permit an expansion of the plaquette operator in powers of @xmath54 .",
    "to lowest ( non  trivial ) order @xcite in @xmath54 , the plaquette operator ( [ pt ] ) is therefore proportional to @xmath57~,\\ ] ] where @xmath58 is the @xmath59th component of the electric field strength ( @xmath60 is the field  strength tensor ) .",
    "thus , ( [ pt ] ) is proportional to the color electric field energy density .",
    "as will be shown in detail in section 3 , the field energy density correlator can be decomposed in terms of multi  gluon exchange diagrams , the simplest of which is a one  loop , two  gluon exchange diagram . in the perturbative picture of the gluon plasma ,",
    "this diagram is expected to give the dominant contribution to the energy density correlator , since mutual interactions between gluons are screened by the hot environment . in section 5",
    "we will show that in this case the mass determining the exponential decay of the energy density correlator is twice the gluon screening mass .",
    "it was found in @xcite that the mass extracted from the correlator between the @xmath61 is consistent with the mass extracted from the polyakov  loop correlation function , which for @xmath8 agrees well with the perturbative result @xmath62 .",
    "this suggests that indeed the perturbative picture of the gluon plasma is valid , i.e. , that the one  loop , two ",
    "gluon exchange diagram constitutes the dominant contribution to the @xmath61correlator at @xmath21 . in our following continuum analysis",
    ", this will be our main working _",
    "assumption_. however , we emphasize that there is no rigorous proof that the respective temperature @xmath63 is sufficiently high and , consequently , the lattice spacing @xmath54 sufficiently small so that the energy density correlators accurately reflect the plaquette correlators , and that the dominant contribution to the energy density correlators is the one  loop , two  gluon exchange .    the second lowest mass extracted from the spectrum of all glueball  like excitations above @xmath7 was identified to belong essentially to the connected correlator between elementary spatial plaquettes @xmath64 which , to lowest non  trivial order in @xmath54 , are proportional to the magnetic field energy density in @xmath65direction : @xmath66 @xmath67 . in analogy to the electric correlator , the authors of @xcite interpreted this screening mass as twice the non  perturbative magnetic screening mass @xmath68 .",
    "as indicated in the last section , if one assumes that the dominant contribution to the energy density correlators is given by two  gluon exchange , then this allows an interpretation of the mass determined from the decay of the correlators as twice the gluon screening mass . in order to clarify this",
    ", we decompose the energy density correlators into multi  gluon exchange diagrams .",
    "we start with the magnetic correlator which has the simpler structure . the magnetic point  to  point correlator between @xmath69 and @xmath70 reads @xmath71~{\\rm tr } [ g^c g^d ] ~\\left\\langle f_{xy}^a ( r )    f_{xy}^b ( r ) f_{xy}^c ( r ' ) f_{xy}^d ( r ' ) \\right\\rangle_c~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the subscript `` c '' at the ensemble average brackets indicates that only the connected part of the respective expression is to be taken into account .",

    "zero matsubara modes decay exponentially according to ( [ uinf ] ) .",

    "this changes the small distance @xmath125behavior to a decay proportional to @xmath127 .",
    "thus , finite temperature enhances long distance correlations by one power of the distance as compared to the @xmath119case ( in our case , from @xmath128 to @xmath129 ) .",

    "first of all , in that work sources and sinks of the correlators are plaquettes with a minimum edge length @xmath54 , while ( [ lattm ] ) is essentially a point  to  point correlator .",
    "in addition , _ fuzzed links _ were used to enhance the signal at large @xmath65 @xcite .",
    "this technique effectively enlargens sources and sinks to the size of several plaquettes and also suppresses contributions of higher excited states at small @xmath65 @xcite , thus having an effect similar to wall sources commonly employed in the calculation of hadronic correlation functions . in the next section we investigate a model for fuzzing and apply it to our perturbative correlators .    to conclude this section we remark that excited states are in our picture",

    "it is obvious that with suitable form factors one can suppress the contribution of large @xmath272 and @xmath78 .",
    "thus , our model correctly simulates the effect of fuzzing in that the small@xmath65 enhancement of the correlation function due to higher excited states can be reduced , which leaves the exponential decay less distorted .",

    "this corresponds to @xmath275 , which has the maximum effect of suppressing _ all _ higher transverse momenta and matsubara frequencies .",
    "unfortunately , wall sources are not applicable in our case , since the contribution of zero transverse momentum has zero measure in the integral in ( [ 23 ] ) and would thus lead to a trivial result for the correlator .",
    "we now investigate the influence of smeared sources and sinks on the lattice correlator ( [ lattm ] ) . to this end , eq .  ( [ smear ] ) is transcribed onto the lattice using standard discretization prescriptions . in @xcite",
    "the sources and sinks prior to fuzzing are plaquettes of edge length @xmath54 .",
    "fuzzing links up to fuzzing level @xmath276 increases the _ average _ edge length of the plaquette source and sink to @xmath277 @xcite .",
    "consequently , the sources and sinks have on the average the volume @xmath278 where @xmath279 .",
    "thus , we choose as form factor @xmath280 and the same for @xmath281 .",
    "this corresponds to a homogeneous smearing of the source and sink over a cube of volume @xmath282 .",
    "clearly many other possibilities for form factors are possible , but ( [ form ] ) is the most simple choice and will be adequate to prove our point , namely , that the extracted screening masses are extremely sensitive to the chosen smearing prescription and that smearing improves the extraction of screening masses only in the case when those are large compared to @xmath1 . for small screening masses smearing will be seen to introduce uncontrolled errors .",
    "the fuzzing level used in @xcite is @xmath283 , i.e. , @xmath284 and @xmath285 for the @xmath246lattice under consideration .",
    "consequently , @xmath286 and @xmath287 .",

    "one clearly observes a suppression of the polynomial enhancement at small @xmath65 , which is proportional to the degree of smearing of sources and sinks .",
    "this reflects the sensitivity of the correlators and hence the extracted screening masses to the choice of the form factor and thus to the particular fuzzing prescription . in the case of maximal smearing @xmath296 the decay of the correlator for @xmath297 is very close to exponential , which is confirmed by the fact that the local masses are nearly constant for @xmath298 .",
    "this can be seen from table 1 and fig .",
    "however , while the reduction of the error due to smearing is impressive for small @xmath65 , the overestimate is still approximately @xmath299 at @xmath258 .    reversing this argument , one could ask for the value of the _ real _ screening mass that would lead to an observed _ local _ mass near the value @xmath300 . to this end , consider first the local masses extracted from the _ free _ correlator ( fig .",
    "one observes ( cf .",
    "table 1 and fig .",
    "5a ) that the sensitivity of the local masses to the degree of smearing ( and thus the fuzzing prescription ) is even more pronounced than in the finite mass case , especially for small @xmath65 .",
    "however , the striking feature is that , although the _ theoretically assumed screening mass is zero _ , the _ local mass _ extracted via the exponential  type fit ( [ fit ] ) is _ finite _  ! this is independent of the degree of smearing , although more strongly smeared sources and sinks give smaller values for the local mass .",
    "nevertheless , the local mass extracted via ( [ fit ] ) fails completely to approximate the real mass if the latter is small compared to @xmath1 .    to compare with the results of @xcite we have to bear in mind that our perturbative analysis relies on the assumptions that ( a ) plaquette correlators can be approximated by energy density correlators , ( b ) the main contribution to the energy density correlators is the exchange diagram of fig .",
    "1d , and ( c ) that our smearing prescription accurately models fuzzing as employed in @xcite . the limitations of ( a ) and ( b ) have already been discussed in section 2 and 3 .",
    "assumption ( c ) could be questionable in view of the following fact : the exact shape of the source and the sink of the correlator , i.e. , the fuzzing or smearing prescription , is irrelevant only as long as there is sufficiently large overlap with the wavefunction of the state the mass of which is to be measured .",
    "this holds in general only for bound states . in our case , however , the correlator is supposed to be given by the exchange of two independently propagating , dressed gluons .",
    "we have already shown ( cf .",
    "figs.4b , c , and 5a ) that in this case the correlator is very sensitive to the chosen smearing ( fuzzing ) prescription .",
    "however , assuming the validity of our assumptions , it is surprising that on the average the local masses @xmath250 in the case @xmath295 are close to the value obtained in @xcite for the magnetic correlator  ! in order to get the value of @xmath300 at @xmath301 ( which was considered to give the best estimate for the mass determining the decay of the magnetic correlator in @xcite ) , we have to assume @xmath155 to be at most of the order of @xmath302 ( cf .",
    "on the average , @xmath303 ( corresponding to @xmath304 ) can be best reconciled with the data of @xcite .",
    "this , in turn , means that the local masses may easily overestimate the real masses by at least a factor of two .",
    "however , a more detailed comparison of our results with the lattice data reveals further problems with this interpretation . in our calculation , the general behavior of the local masses still reflects the remnant enhancement at small @xmath65 , giving rise to larger @xmath250 at small @xmath65 .",
    "this trend is not seen in the lattice data and could indicate that our form factor ansatz does not accurately model fuzzing as employed in @xcite .",
    "we suggest that a lattice test of the dependence of the local masses on the level of fuzzing could help in clarifying the situation .    on the other hand ,",
    "if our fuzzing model works accurately , we are lead to the conclusion that either the plaquette correlators may not be approximated by energy density correlators or that the latter are not dominated by the two  gluon exchange graph of fig .  1d .",
    "if the first possibility is true , then finite size effects are still too large to allow for a simple interpretation of the results of @xcite in terms of continuum physics . in the second case , a continuum analysis which improves and corrects",
    "the simple picture investigated in the present work will be extremely difficult , since one does not a priori know which multi  gluon exchange diagrams yield the dominant contribution to the energy density correlators .",
    "however , in view of recent measurements of the spatial string tension @xcite one might speculate that the magnetic correlator is dominated by a bound state , as represented by fig .  1e . to confirm this ,",
    "however , would require lattice data with much better statistics which is extremely difficult to obtain for the plaquette operators studied in @xcite . in any case",
    ", if this picture is true , the interpretation of the screening mass extracted from the decay of the magnetic correlator as twice the gluon magnetic screening mass is not possible .",
    "moreover , this indicates the breakdown of the simple perturbative picture of the gluon plasma , in accordance with the conclusions of @xcite .",
    "finally we comment on the electric correlator .",
    "given the fact that in the continuum it is not very different from the magnetic , we may use ( [ lattm ] ) as a rough approximation also for the electric correlator .",
    "however , in that case the smaller local electric masses found in @xcite ( @xmath305 , cf .",
    "5b ) , can only be accounted for in our model by assuming that the actual electric screening mass is essentially zero !",
    "this would be in clear contradiction to the screening mass extracted from polyakov  loop correlations @xcite ( unless they also suffer from ambiguities ) .",
    "we conclude that independent measurements of especially the non  perturbative magnetic screening mass are needed to better pin down this physically interesting and phenomenologically relevant quantity @xcite .",
