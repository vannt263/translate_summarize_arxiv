    "the existence of this transition is a strong prediction of the standard cosmological model and attempts have been made to measure the transition redshift .",
    "however , only very recently has this become possible , due to high redshift ( i.e. , @xmath4 above the deceleration - acceleration transition ) data that recently became available , with the most striking being the @xcite measurement of the hubble parameter @xmath7 km s@xmath8 mpc@xmath8 , well in the matter dominated epoch of the standard @xmath6cdm model .    from a compilation of 28 independent @xmath1 measurements over @xmath9 ( * ? ? ?",

    "more conventionally , cosmological data are used to constrain model parameters values such as @xmath33 and @xmath32 for the @xmath6cdm model .",

    "separately and in combination , provide strong evidence for accelerated cosmological expansion at the current epoch .",
    "however their error bars are still too large to allow for a discrimination between constant and time - varying dark energy densities .",
    "of course , both methods are equivalent , since they make use of the same data , but each has it own advantages and disadvantages .",
    "in particular , it is of some interest to actually discern the deceleration - acceleration transition in the @xmath1 data .",
    "while the data does indicate the transition , see fig .  4 of fr , the data points bounce around quite a bit .",
    "given the low reduced @xmath54 for the best - fit models ( see fr and table 1 here ) , all of which show significant evidence for a deceleration - acceleration transition , we investigate different data binning techniques here , to see if binned versions of the @xmath1 measurements more clearly illustrate the presence of a deceleration - acceleration transition .",
    "motivated by a similar situation in the early days of cmb anisotropy data constraints , in this paper we use the binning techniques of @xcite to bin the @xmath1 data and so construct a smoother representation of the observed @xmath1 function .",
    "while @xcite considered many more data points then we do here ( 142 vs.  23 ) , they covered a large range in multipole space with @xmath55 while we consider a significantly smaller range in redshift space with @xmath56 .",
    "the other striking point is that , unlike in @xcite for the cmb anisotropy case , we find here that when combining individual @xmath1 measurements the error bars of these measurements are consistent with what is expected for gaussian errors .",
    "this is quiet reassuring .",
    "we find that the weighted - mean binned @xmath1 equally well constrain cosmological parameters , as well as do the unbinned data .",
    "more interestingly , for our purpose here , the binned weighted - mean data clearly indicate the presence of the deceleration - acceleration transition .    our paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we summarize the two techniques we use to bin the @xmath1 data and compute binned results for a variety of data points per bin . in sec .",
    "[ constraints ] we use the binned @xmath1 data to derive constraints on cosmological parameters of the 3 models we consider and show that for the weighted - mean binning these constraints are very close to those that follow from the unbinned data .",
    "we conclude in sec .  [ summary ] .",
    "the 28 individual @xmath1 measurements bounce around on the @xmath3 plot , fig .  4 of fr .",
    "to try to get a smoother observed @xmath3 function we form bins in redshift and then combine the data points in each bin to give a single observed value of @xmath4 , @xmath1 , and @xmath57 for that bin .",
    "the measurements in each bin are combined using two different statistical techniques , weighted mean and median statistics .",
    "table [ table : wa ] lists the weighted mean results . these results were computed using the standard formulae ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "that is , @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the number of data points in the bin under consideration , @xmath60 is the weighted mean of the hubble parameter in that bin , @xmath61 is the value of the hubble parameter measured at redshift @xmath62 and @xmath63 is the corresponding uncertainty .",
    "weighted mean redshifts , denoted by @xmath64 , were similarly computed , @xmath65 the weighted mean standard deviation , denoted by @xmath66 , for each bin was found from @xmath67 the assumptions underlying use of weighted mean statistics are that the measurement errors are gaussian , and there are no systematic errors .",
    "hence , one can compute @xmath54 , the goodness - of - fit parameter , for each bin , @xmath68 ^ 2}{\\sigma_{i}^2 } , \\label{eq.chi}\\ ] ] which has expected value unity and error @xmath69 , so we can use this to determine the number of standard deviations that @xmath70 deviates from unity for each bin , @xmath71 an unaccounted for systematic error , the presence of significant correlations between the measurements , and breakdown of the gaussian error assumption for each measurement , are the three factors that can make @xmath72 much greater than unity .",
    "the second technique we use to combine measurements in a bin is median statistics , as developed in @xcite .",
    "table  [ table : med ] lists the median statistics results .",
    "the median is the value for which there is a @xmath73 chance of finding a measurement below or above it .",
    "it is fair to use median statistics to combine the @xmath1 data of table 1 of fr since we assume that all the measurements are independent and there is no over - all systematic error in the @xmath1 data as a whole ( individual measurements can have individual systematic errors , for discussion see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the median will be revealed as a true value as the number of measurements grow to infinity , and this technique reduces the effect of outliers of a set of measurements on the estimate of a true value .",
    "if @xmath59 measurements are considered , the probability of finding the true value between values @xmath74 and @xmath75 ( where @xmath76 ) is @xcite , @xmath77 this process of finding a median value was used for the redshift and the hubble parameter , and the hubble parameter probability distribution was used to determine @xmath57 for each bin .",
    "we would like to have as many measurements as possible in each bin , as well as bins that are as narrow as possible in redshift space .",
    "obviously , since these requirements are contradictory , compromise is necessary .",
    "in addition , we require roughly the same number of measurements per bin , so as to have approximately similar errors on the binned measurements .",
    "as indicated in table  [ table : wa ] and table  [ table : med ] we consider four different binnings of the 23 lower redshift , @xmath0 , measurements ; the five higher redshift measurements are sparsely spread over too large a redshift range to allow for a useful binning .",
    "the last column of table  [ table : wa ] shows that the first two binnings , with approximately 3 and 5 measurements per bin , do not show any deviation from what is expected from gaussian errors . on the other hand , the last binning , with about 8 measurements per bin , appears to be not so consistent with the assumption of gaussian errors",
    "this is likely a consequence of the large width in redshift of these bins , so the measurements at the low @xmath4 end and at the high @xmath4 end of each bin differ too much to be combined together .",
    "median statistics does not make use of the error bars of the individual measurements . as a result , it is a more conservative technique and when used to combine data in bins it results in larger error bars .",
    "a comparison of the results in tables   2 and  3 clearly illustrates this point .",
    "fortunately the weighted mean results we have found show that the individual lower redshift data points have reasonable error bars and so there is no obvious danger in using the more constraining weighted mean results to draw physical conclusions .",
    "the weighted - mean and median statistics binned results of tables  2 and 3 are plotted in the top panels of figs .",
    "[ fig : for table 2,3][fig : for table 8,9 ] ( in purple ) .",
    "these figures also show the 5 higher @xmath4 unbinned measurements listed in table  1 of fr ( in cyan ) .",
    "both sets of observations show @xmath78 and @xmath79 @xmath57 error bars .",

    "[ fig : for table 2,3][fig : for table 8,9 ] that the weighted - mean binning of the first 23 data points in table  1 of fr give almost exactly the same constraints on model parameters @xmath81 for the three cosmological models as do the unbinned data of table  1 of fr .",
    "since the weighted - mean technique assumes that the error in the measurements has a gaussian distribution and that the measurements are uncorrelated , this result is consistant with this assumption that the @xmath1 data in table  1 of fr have gaussian errors .",
    "consequently the best way to combine the measurements in a bin is to use the weighted - mean method .",
    "it is also useful to note that when there are fewer data points in a narrower bin , the constraints from the binned data matches better with the constraints derived from the unbinned data .",
    "this is not unexpected . in the case of median statistics , however , the constraints on model parameters for all three models from the binned data are much less restrictive than those derived from the unbinned data , see the right hand column of panels in the lower three rows of figs  [ fig : for table 2,3][fig : for table 8,9 ] .",
    "this is because median statistics is a more conservative technique and so , in this case , is not the best way of combining @xmath1 measurements in bins .",
    "it is also interesting to note , from tables [ table : fig1 details][table : fig4 details ] , that @xmath89 for the case of median statistics is significantly smaller than @xmath89 for the weighted mean case .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the larger error bars estimated by the more conservative median statistics approach .",
    "we have shown that the weighted - mean combinations of the lower redshift @xmath1 measurements in bins in redshift provide close to identical constraints on cosmological model parameters as do the unbinned @xmath1 data tabulated in fr .",
