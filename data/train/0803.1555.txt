    "in recent years privacy preserving data mining has emerged as a very active research area in data mining .",
    "the application possibilities of data mining , combined with the internet , have attracted and inspired many scientists from different research areas such as computer science , bioinformatics and economics , to actively participate in this relatively young field . over the last few years",
    "this has naturally lead to a growing interest in security or privacy issues in data mining .",
    "more precisely , it became clear that discovering knowledge through a combination of different databases , raises important security issues .",
    "despite the fact that a centralized warehouse approach allows to discover knowledge , which would have not emerged when the sites were mined individually , privacy of data can not be guaranteed in the context of datawarehousing .",
    "although data mining results usually do not violate privacy of individuals , it can not be assured that an unauthorized person will not access the centralized warehouse with some malevolent intentions to misuse gathered information for his own purposes during the data mining process .",
    "neither can it be guaranteed that , when data is partitioned over different sites and data is not encrypted , it is impossible to derive new knowledge about the other sites . data mining techniques try to identify regularities in data , which are unknown and hard to discover by individuals .",
    "regularities or patterns are to be understood as revelations over the entire data , rather than on individuals .",
    "however to find such revelations the mining process has to access and use individual information .",
    "more formally , this problem is recognized as the _ inference problem _ @xcite .",
    "originally this problem dates back to research in database theory during the 70s and early 80s , acknowledged back then as access control .",
    "models were developed offering protection against unauthorized use or access of the database .",
    "however , such models seemed unable to sufficiently protect sensitive information .",
    "more precisely , indirect accesses ( through a different database and metadata ) still allowed one to attain information not authorized for . here , metadata consists , e.g. , of dependencies between different databases , integrity constraints , domain knowledge , etc .",
    "in other words , the inference problem occurs when one can obtain vital information through metadata violating individuals ( or companies ) privacy . with the elaboration of different network technologies and growing interest in pattern recognition this problem naturally carries over to data mining .",
    "in fact it gets even worse as illustrated by sweeny in @xcite . in her work sweeny",
    "shows that the typical de - identification technique applied on data sets for public use , does not render the result anonymous .",
    "more precisely , she demonstrated that combinations of characteristics ( or attributes ) can construct a unique or near - unique identifier of tuples , which means that information can be gained on individuals even when their identifiers are distorted .",
    "over the past few years state of the art research in privacy preserving data mining has concentrated itself along two major lines : data which is _ horizontally distributed _ and data which is _ vertically distributed_. horizontally partitioned data is data which is homogeneously distributed , meaning that all data tuples yield over the same item or feature set . essentially this boils down to different data sites collecting the same kind of information over different individuals . consider for instance a supermarket chain which gathers information on the buying behavior of its customers .",
    "typically , such a company has different branches , implying data to be horizontally distributed .",
    "vertically distributed data is data which is heterogeneously distributed .",
    "basically this means that data is collected by different sites or parties on the same individuals but with differing item or feature sets .",
    "consider for instance financial institutions as banks and credit card companies , they both collect data on customers having a credit card but with differing item sets .      in this paper",
    ", we also consider data which is _ both _ horizontally and vertically distributed , which we will call _ grid partitioned data_. to our knowledge , there has been no research up till now in privacy preserving data mining that considers grid distributed data .",
    "however this kind of situation seems highly relevant and significant .",
    "consider for instance the situation were different financial institutions gather data on clients concerning savings account , investments , credit cards and others .",
    "this situation clearly considers data which is grid partitioned , since some institutions deal with credit cards and not with investments and vice versa and since financial institutions typically have data emerging from different branches of a bank . for a more thorough elaboration of this example",
    ", we refer to the end of this introduction ( section [ subsec : motexample ] ) . in this paper",
    ", we propose a new algorithm to preserve privacy when constructing a decision tree for classification over grid partitioned data using id3 , involving multiple parties .",
    "most closely related to this work is that of lindell and pinkas @xcite who introduced a secure multi - party computation technique for classification using the id3 algorithm over horizontally partitioned data and that of du and zhan @xcite who introduced a protocol for making id3 secure over vertically partitioned data .",
    "an important contribution of our work is to consider horizontally and vertically distributed data at the same time .",
    "furthermore , we also believe this is highly significant as most real life vital data mining situations , involving multiple parties , consist of grid partitioned data .",
    "a motivating example is discussed in section [ subsec : motexample ] . for grid partitioned data , we discuss two different evaluation methods for preserving privacy id3 , namely , first merging horizontally and developing vertically or first merging vertically and next developing horizontally .",
    "we show in section [ sec : discussion ] by means of a complexity analysis that the former is the most efficient . in the context of secure multiparty computation ,",
    "the `` semi - honest '' and the `` malicious '' model  @xcite are considered . in the former ,",
    "all parties follow the protocol strictly , but are allowed to remember everything they encounter while executing the protocol and to use this information to compute information about the other parties , whereas in the malicious model the parties are allowed to cheat .",
    "we assume the semi - honest model in this paper .",
    "the rest of this paper is structured as follows .",
    "we end this introduction by a motivating example for grid partitioned data , illustrating the importance of efficiently dealing with grid partitioned data in data mining applications . in section [ sec : preliminaries ] , we sketch the preliminaries as the id3 algorithm and definitions of horizontally , vertically and grid distributed data",
    ". section [ sec : algorithm ] introduces our algorithm .",
    "we discuss the two different evaluation methods for preserving privacy id3 in section [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "section [ sec : conclusion ] concludes the paper .",
    "typically for financial institutions as banks is that they offer their clients different services as a savings account , choice of credit card , maestro and all kinds of investment possibilities as mortgages , stock investments , fund orders and so on .",
    "of course a bank is interested in knowing which are good customers , which are bad ones and which are possible defrauders .",
    "reasons are obvious , making profit and avoiding losses because of clients which are not credit worthy and show unreliable behavior .",
    "gathering all kinds of financial data about their customers and their transactions can help them in identifying risky clients and possible defrauders , preventing huge financial losses .",
    "more precisely , by using good data mining techniques it becomes possible to generalize over these gathered data sets and identify possible risks for future cases or transactions .",
    "typical for different branches is to gather the same kind ( i.e. item sets ) of data on different clients , implying that data is _ horizontally _ partitioned .",
    "a possible item set re - occurring at banks is illustrated in table [ tab : itemset ] .",
    ".a possible item set . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      we start by remarking that it looks more logical to merge the data first horizontally and then to further develop it vertically .",
    "de emptiness test can be implemented more efficiently in the former case .",
    "the secure @xmath0 protocol gives an approximated result , but the difference from the real result is small .",
    "this protocol also makes heavy use of circuit computations . in practice",
    "it is preferable to avoid this .",
    "for what concerns complexity , the above obtained expressions also show that first horizontally merging is advantageous . and as remarked before it can be improved by an optimal use of encryption . indeed , by giving different parties the same encryption key",
    "it is not necessary to perform the secure size of set intersection protocols after the secure union protocols have been executed .",
    "in this paper we first discussed the significance of extending the current state of the art in privacy preserving datamining to grid partitioned data , i.e. data which is as well horizontally as vertically partitioned .",
    "our motivating example shows that this situation is of great interest to real world situations and applications .",
    "then we continued by formally defining horizontally , vertically and grid partitioned data . to our knowledge",
    "we are the first to formalize the concept of grid partitioned data .",
    "we continued by introducing three new privacy preserving data mining algorithms .",
    "we started by extending the result of lindell and pinkas @xcite , i.e. preserving privacy for decision tree learning with two parties when data is horizontally distributed , to more than two parties .",
    "however , the main contribution of this paper are the two algorithms to securely induce a distributed decision tree when data is grid partitioned .",
    "more precisely , we considered two possible solutions : one in which data is first merged horizontally and then further developed vertically and vice versa .",
    "the complexity analysis of both algorithms shows that it is more efficient to first merge data horizontally and further develop it vertically than the other way around .",
