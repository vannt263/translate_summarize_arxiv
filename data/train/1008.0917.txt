    "the standard model ( sm ) of elementary particle physics has been phenomenologically very successful . however , as a theory it is less impressive .",
    "there are many fundamental questions that remain unanswered by the sm . due to this",
    ", there are strong reasons to expect that there is a great deal of ( new ) physics beyond the sm , more fundamental with a characteristic mass scale .",
    "the present good agreement between the accelerator - based experimental data and the sm predictions suggests that the energy scale associated with any new physics model should be much higher than the energy reach of the colliders up to now .",
    "it is believed that the new accelerator , the large hadron collider ( lhc ) , started in 2009 , is able to produce new physics particles , first of all new on - shell resonances or a single heavy new particle in association with the sm ones  @xcite .",
    "however , such a scenario for visualizing new physics experimentally is obviously beyond the reach of future @xmath7 colliders , like the planned international linear collider ( ilc ) .",
    "there are methods to probe new physics at energies below the new physics mass scale .",
    "these more indirect scenarios are based on observations of small deviations from the sm predictions for processes with sm particles where new physics effects can arise only from non - standard interactions . the price to pay for such",
    "a possibility is the need for higher sensitivity , both experimentally and theoretically . in the case of future ilc - type colliders ,",
    "the achievable sensitivities are expected to be dramatically ( i.e.  up to orders of magnitude ) improved as compared to the ones obtained up to now . among the various ways to increase the sensitivity we emphasize two .",
    "first , there is a reason to expect that processes including heavy particles are more sensitive to new physics manifestations .",
    "second , processes including polarization effects have higher sensitivity than unpolarized processes . the possibility at ilc to use both longitudinally and transversely polarized initial beams provide additional means to increase the sensitivity for new physics .",
    "aforementioned circumstances considerably increases the potential to probe anomalous interactions via spin effects in @xmath7 annihilation into heavy particles .",
    "therefore , the processes @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 have been studied extensively . at the same time it is obvious that the search for new physics , even though performed at very sensitive future colliders ,",
    "can not be successful without knowing the sm predictions with appropriate precision . in ref .",
    "@xcite lykken writes : `` [  ] to first approximation [  ] experimenters do not need to know anything about bsm [ beyond the sm ] models in order to make discoveries  but they need to know a lot of the standard model physics ! '' in the context of searching for new physics in aforementioned processes via spin orientation , this means that the knowledge of all possible spin effects in these processes in the framework of the sm forms a good basis for rejecting or limiting anomalous couplings . in this paper",
    "we try to add our contribution to this basis .    in the framework of the sm we present and analyse analytical expressions for the @xmath0 boson spin polarization vectors and alignment tensors for the processes @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 near the production threshold .",
    "for all these processes the initial beams are taken to have both longitudinal and transverse polarization components .",
    "we demonstrate that the expressions for the spin orientation parameters in these processes have similar shape and symmetry properties .",
    "even more , the expressions for the @xmath0 boson polarization vector and alignment tensor for the processes @xmath11 and @xmath12 coincide .    the paper is organized as follows . in sec .  2",
    "we explain how spin orientation parameters can be described by density matrices .",
    "in addition we show how to obtain the actual spin polarization vector and alignment tensor of the final @xmath0 boson . in sec .",
    "3 we present the analytical expressions for the spin orientation parameters of the three processes and dwell on similarities and interesting symmetry features .",
    "the results are checked with the help of positivity conditions . at the end of this paper",
    "we give our conclusions .",
    "in physical processes the particles with non - zero spins are generally in a mixed spin state .",
    "contrary to the pure state which can be described by a single wave function , the description of a mixed state deserves an incoherent superposition of @xmath13 orthogonal pure state wave functions . by definition",
    "this superposition means that in order to calculate the probability for finding a certain mixed state , one has to calculate the average of the probabilities of the pure states , assigning to each pure state an appropriate weight .",
    "the most natural way to describe mixed states is to use the spin density matrix formalism .",
    "technically , if interested in the spin orientation of a certain particle in the process , one replaces the element @xmath14 ( spin-1/2 case ) or @xmath15 ( spin-1 case ) in the squared amplitude of the process by the mixed state spin density matrix . for our calculations the relativistic spin-1/2 density matrices for the initial beams and the non - relativistic spin-1 density matrices for the final @xmath0-bosons",
    "are needed .",
    "the relativistic spin-1/2 density matrices have the familiar shape @xmath16 where the upper signs refer to the electron and the lower ones to the positron . here and in the following we use feynman s slash notation @xmath17 .",
    "the polarization four - vectors are given by @xmath18 where @xmath19 are the polarization vectors in the resp .",
    "rest frame of the particle . for",
    "the absolute value @xmath20 of the mixed state polarization vectors one can take any value between zero and one .",
    "if the electron and positron have both longitudinal polarization ( lp ) and transverse polarization ( tp ) , it is useful to divide the polarization vector @xmath21 up into lp and tp parts .",
    "the limit @xmath22 which is used in our calculations can be conveniently taken by making use of the approximation @xmath23 and subsequently setting @xmath24 .",
    "@xmath25 is the measure of lp and @xmath26 is the tp four - vector with @xmath27 the transverse component of the polarization vector ( @xmath28 ) . after inserting eq .",
    "( [ ltp ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ rhoh ] ) and performing the limit @xmath29 , one obtains  @xcite @xmath30 convenient for our calculations .    for describing mixed states by @xmath31 non - relativistic hermitian spin - density matrixes , at most 8 real parameters",
    "are needed .",
    "for expanding such a matrix one can use a basis containing the unit matrix @xmath32 , the three spin matrices @xmath33 , and the six combinations of products of two spin matrices in the form @xmath34 in such a basis the basic elements are hermitian zero - trace matrices which makes their usage convenient .",
    "the density matrix expanded in this basis reads @xmath35 where here and in the following we sum over all indices which occur twice ( einstein s convention ) .",
    "note that this basis is over - determined . instead of 9 matrices needed to expand the density matrix it contains 10 matrices",
    ". however , not all the elements of the basis are linearly independent .",
    "the relation @xmath36 holds for three of the basic elements . in order to reduce the number of parameters from 9 to 8 independent ones ,",
    "it is necessary to claim @xmath37 due to this constraint , one obtains @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the polarization vector and @xmath40 is the orientation or alignment tensor describing the alignment of spins .    when taking the spin-1 matrices in the representation @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the totally antisymmetric tensor , one obtains @xmath43 in this case , @xmath44 from eq .",
    "( [ rhoij ] ) can be written in the simple form @xmath45 this form is used in our calculations .",
    "in our calculations it is supposed that the spin orientation of a single final @xmath0 boson is observed . and",
    "@xmath46 determine the angular distribution of the decay products .",
    "therefore , the @xmath0 boson spin orientation parameters can be seen by analyzing the angular distribution of its decay products . according to the particle data group  @xcite",
    ", the @xmath0 boson decays with @xmath47 probability into lepton pairs ( @xmath7 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 ) , and with @xmath50 probability into hadron pairs . considering only lepton pairs which can be clearly distinguished from the background",
    ", the analysis can be found in sec .  4 of ref .",
    "@xcite , giving the correlation between the spin orientation parameters and the angular distribution . ] accordingly , the squared amplitude of the process can be given in the form @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the scalar , vector and tensor built from the polarization parameters of the initial electron and positron , the kinematical parameters of all the particles participating in the process , and the coupling constants .",
    "since the calculations are performed in the cm frame with vanishing electron mass at threshold energies , there are only two kinematical parameters  the electron three - momentum @xmath53 and the mass @xmath54 of the @xmath0 boson .",
    "the squared amplitude determines the probability that the process produces a final @xmath0 boson with spin orientation parameters @xmath55 and @xmath46 . on the other hand ,",
    "the same probability can be expressed also as the traced product of two density matrices @xmath56 where the real ( actual ) density matrices and their parameters are denoted by an upper index @xmath57 .",
    "the symbols without this index are the density matrices and their parameters that are substituted into the squared amplitude instead of @xmath58 . by comparing eqs .",
    "( [ m2 ] ) and  ( [ rhorrho ] ) one can find the actual polarization vector and alignment tensor of the @xmath0 boson , @xmath59 where the term @xmath60 incorporates the tracelessness  ( [ traceless ] ) .",
    "the values of the parameters @xmath55 and @xmath46 are restricted by their physical boundaries as extremal values . in this physical region parameters are linear independent . however , due to the positivity ( non - negativity ) condition of the density matrices they depend on each other non - linearly .",
    "it can be shown that the most restrictive requirements for the spin-1 density matrix can be given by the inequality  @xcite @xmath61 if one expresses the density matrix through its parameters , one obtains @xmath62 from this expression one can clearly see how the vector and tensor parameters depend non - linearly on each other .",
    "( [ posex ] ) is useful when analyzing the possibilities of tuning the final @xmath0 boson spin orientation by varying the polarization of the initial beams .",
    "we are now ready to present the final @xmath0 boson spin orientation parameters ( polarization vectors and alignment tensors ) at the threshold energies for the three processes @xmath3 , calculated in the center - of - mass system .",
    "note that the kinematics simplifies significantly when calculating at the threshold . on the other hand ,",
    "the results obtained are also valid close to the threshold .",
    "the first process @xmath8 could be important in clarifying the mechanisms of electroweak symmetry breaking proposed by various beyond - the - sm models ( for an independent work on this subject see e.g.refs .",
    "@xcite ) . in the sm at tree level this process",
    "is described by an @xmath63-channel feynman diagram with a point - like @xmath64 vertex ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "actually , at lowest order there are three feynman diagrams corresponding to the process .",
    "however , the two diagrams where the higgs boson couples to the electron line can be ignored due to the smallness of the coupling which is proportional to the electron mass .",
    "the two remaining processes @xmath65 have been most of all used to investigate possible new physics manifestations via anomalous gauge boson self - couplings @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 . in the sm at tree level",
    "these processes are described by a @xmath69-channel and an @xmath70-channel diagram ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "+ ( a)(b )    the @xmath0 boson spin polarization vectors and alignment tensors for the processes @xmath1 with vanishing electron mass have been calculated by us earlier  @xcite . at the threshold energies",
    "the spin orientation parameters reduce to the same expressions , @xmath71\\label{tijz}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we used @xmath72 , @xmath73 in order to write the expressions in a more symmetric form , and the short hand notation @xmath74 . @xmath25 and @xmath27 are the measures of the electron ( positron ) longitudinal polarizations and the electron ( positron ) transverse polarization vectors , respectively .",
    "@xmath75 indicates the unit vector along the electron momentum .",
    "even though somewhat peculiar , the coincidence of the @xmath0 boson spin orientation parameters of a @xmath63-channel diagram with the spin orientation parameters of a @xmath69-channel and an @xmath70-channel diagram at corresponding thresholds is expected .",
    "one can say that eqs .",
    "( [ tiz ] ) and  ( [ tijz ] ) give the spin orientation parameters of the real @xmath0 boson in the process @xmath76 .",
    "the higgs boson is a spin-0 particle and , therefore , can not affect the spin orientation of the @xmath0 boson at the threshold of @xmath8 . in the same way , for @xmath77 the photon in the process @xmath11 can be considered as a radiative correction to the main process @xmath76 .",
    "the coincidence of the @xmath0 boson orientation parameters for the two different processes , therefore , can be taken as a cross - check for the final expressions .    in order to obtain the spin orientation parameters for one of the final @xmath0 bosons in the process @xmath2 at threshold",
    ", we again take the ( massless ) electron and positron beams to be polarized , having both longitudinal and transverse polarization components . in summing over the spin orientations of the second @xmath0 boson ( in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] indicated with momentum @xmath78 ) , we obtain for the squared amplitude of the process at threshold @xmath79t_{ij}\\bigg\\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the short - hand notation @xmath80 is used . according to the rules given in sec .",
    "[ sec21 ] , for the spin orientation parameters one obtains @xmath81.\\label{tijzz}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that the terms @xmath82 are introduced into @xmath46 in order to make it traceless . obviously , the spin orientation parameters in eqs .",
    "( [ tizz ] ) and  ( [ tijzz ] ) do not coincide with those of the processes @xmath1 ( eqs .",
    "( [ tiz ] ) and  ( [ tijz ] ) ) but are similar to them .",
    "this is quite understandable . due to the two @xmath0 boson final state the constants @xmath83 and",
    "@xmath84 appear twice in the squared amplitude .",
    "therefore , the squares in @xmath85 had to be replaced by fourth powers in @xmath86",
    ". on the other hand , only the direction @xmath75 of the electron and the transverse polarization vectors @xmath87 are available to build the spin orientation parameters . as a result , besides the change of the power of the coupling constants the expressions can differ only by the constants in front of the various three contributions .",
    "this is indeed the case in the expressions obtained .      in this section",
    "we demonstrate that the polarization vectors of the @xmath0 boson in the different processes under consideration feature interesting symmetries . expressing the polarization vectors as a function of the effective polarization parameter @xmath88 of the initial beams , for the processes @xmath1",
    "we obtain @xmath89 where @xmath90 where we used @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , and @xmath94 ( with @xmath95 , @xmath96  @xcite ) . for the process @xmath2 one obtains @xmath97 where @xmath98 for longitudinally unpolarized initial beams ( @xmath99 ) one obtains quite similar values @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "the similarity is related to the smallness of @xmath102 .",
    "exact coincidence would hold for @xmath103 .",
    "however , in this case one would obtain @xmath104 .    on the other hand ,",
    "the polarizations vanish for @xmath105 and @xmath106 , respectively , i.e.  @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "this is because the reciprocal functions read @xmath109 note that for the process @xmath110 at threshold the sm result for the final top quark polarization can be expressed as @xmath111 where the function @xmath112 has similar symmetry properties with @xmath113  @xcite .",
    "+ ( a)(b )    in fig .  [ fig3 ] the dependence of @xmath114 and @xmath115 as functions of the effective polarization parameter @xmath116 is presented .",
    "note that @xmath116 can obtain values between @xmath117 and @xmath118 only if the initial beams have no transverse polarization components .",
    "while @xmath114 takes all values between @xmath117 and @xmath118 , the range for @xmath115 is restricted to @xmath119 .",
    "this is mirrored also by the positivity condition in sec .",
    "[ sec22 ] , giving a possibility to check our result in an independent way .",
    "as mentioned before , the polarization vectors and the alignment tensors can depend only on the direction @xmath75 of the electron beam and the transverse polarization vectors of the initial beams . considering first longitudinally polarized beams ( @xmath120 ) and choosing the @xmath121-axis to be the direction of the electron beam , one obtains the non - vanishing components @xmath122 inserting the @xmath46 into the positivity condition  ( [ posex ] ) it turns out that the condition is satisfied independently of the value of @xmath123 and , therefore , also independently of the value of @xmath116 .",
    "hence , by varying the effective polarization parameter @xmath116 one can theoretically force the @xmath0 boson polarization vector to take any value between @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "practically achievable values are not far from the theoretical ones .",
    "when using the values @xmath124 , @xmath125 , planned to be achieved at the ilc , one can reach value @xmath126 for the effective polarization parameter , leading to similar values for the @xmath0 polarization ( cf .",
    "[ fig3](a ) ) .    when doing the same with the components of the spin orientation parameters for the process @xmath2 , one obtains @xmath127 inserting the @xmath46 into the positivity condition  ( [ posex ] ) , one obtains @xmath128 which is consistent with fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) .",
    "also in the general case , i.e.  with transversely and/or longitudinally polarized initial beams , the positivity condition  ( [ posex ] ) is in harmony with the spin orientation parameters @xmath55 and @xmath46 of the processes @xmath3 .",
    "our investigation checks the obtained expressions for the spin orientation parameters and shows how much one can tune these parameters when varying the initial beam polarization parameters @xmath25 and @xmath27 .",
    "taking both transverse polarization vectors @xmath129 and @xmath130 to be directed along the @xmath131-axis of the coordinate system , for the processes @xmath1 one obtains @xmath132 inserting the @xmath46 into the positivity condition  ( [ posex ] ) , one finds that the condition takes the form @xmath133 .",
    "this means that the positivity condition is satisfied in any case , i.e.  for any values @xmath25 and @xmath134 . as a consequence , by varying the lp parameters @xmath25 ( or @xmath116 ) one can tune the @xmath0 boson polarization over the whole range @xmath135 $ ] if @xmath129 or @xmath130 or both of them are equal to zero . in the same way , by varying @xmath27",
    "one can tune the alignment tensor for @xmath136 .    under the same conditions , for the process @xmath2 one obtains @xmath137 after inserting @xmath46 into the positivity condition  ( [ posex ] ) , one obtains the restriction @xmath138 in absence of the term depending on @xmath139 this result reproduces the previous result , i.e.  that by varying the parameters @xmath25 ( or @xmath116 ) one can theoretically tune the @xmath0 boson polarization from zero to @xmath140 ( @xmath141 for @xmath142 and @xmath143 for @xmath144 ) .",
    "finally , if we insert also the value @xmath145 into the positivity condition  ( [ posex ] ) , we obtain a condition of the form @xmath146 for @xmath136 the condition @xmath147 puts no constraints on the transverse polarization of the initial beams . on the other hand ,",
    "if one of the initial beams is longitudinally polarized , restrictions on the transverse polarizations of the initial beams are imposed .",
    "we have presented the spin orientation parameters of the final @xmath0 boson for the three processes @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 in the standard model at the threshold energies and have found their properties .",
    "note that a part of the properties found are valid also at higher energies .",
    "therefore , the processes depend on the longitudinal polarization of the initial beams via the factors @xmath148 or @xmath149 not only at the thresholds of the processes but also in the general case . such properties could be helpful in separating sm contributions from new physics ones .",
