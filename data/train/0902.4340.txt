    "recent advances in the analysis of the ubiquitous ruin problem from the theory of insurance risk has seen a tendency to replace the classical cramr - lundberg surplus process with a general spectrally negative lvy processes ; see for example @xcite to name but a few . in that case",
    "the surplus process is commonly referred to as a _ lvy insurance risk process_. although moving to this more complex setting , arguably , does not bring any more realistic features to the table than are already on offer in the classical cramr - lundberg model , a clear mathematical advantage has emerged . working with lvy",
    "insurance risk processes forces one to approach the problem of ruin via excursion or fluctuation theory which does not use specific features of the underlying lvy process other than a generic path decomposition of the process in terms of excursions from its maximum which manifests itself in the form of a poisson point process .    in this paper , we continue in this vein and build on ideas of lvy insurance risk processes with tax which were introduced and studied in @xcite .",
    "specifically we introduce a more general tax structure and therewith we establish , for the aggregate surplus process , new identities for the two sided exit problem , a generalized version of the gerber - shiu function as well the net present value of tax paid until ruin .",
    "henceforth the process @xmath0 with probabilities @xmath1 and natural filtration @xmath2 will denote a spectrally negative lvy process with the usual exclusion of processes in the latter class which have monotone paths ( that is to say a pure increasing linear drift and the negative of a subordinator ) . for convenience we shall always denote @xmath3 by @xmath4 .",
    "let @xmath5 be the laplace exponent of @xmath6 which is known to be finite for at least @xmath7 in which case it is a strictly convex and infinitely differentiable function .",
    "the asymptotic behaviour of @xmath6 is characterized by @xmath8 , so that @xmath6 drifts to @xmath9 ( oscillates ) accordingly as @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "when @xmath6 plays the role of the surplus process , it is usual to make the assumption that @xmath12 which is equivalent to the _ net profit condition _ in the case that @xmath6 is a cramr - lundberg process .",
    "however , this condition is not necessary for any of the forthcoming analysis .",
    "denote by @xmath13 the process which describes the running supremum of @xmath6 , that is to say , @xmath14 for each @xmath15 . following @xcite , we are interested in modeling tax payments from the lvy insurance process in such a way that the cumulative payment until time @xmath16 is given by @xmath17 where @xmath18 is a measurable function which satisfies @xmath19 in that case the aggregate surplus process , the primary object of our study , is given by @xmath20 in the special case that @xmath21 is a constant in @xmath22 our lvy insurance risk process with tax agrees with the model introduced in @xcite . in the case",
    "that @xmath23 , we are back to a regular lvy insurance risk process .",
    "note also that processes of the form ( [ agg ] ) constitute a subclass of controlled lvy risk processes , the latter being of popular interest in recent literature ; see for example @xcite    in order to state the results alluded to above which concern path functionals of @xmath24 , we must first introduce more notation . as is now usual when studying lvy risk processes , a key element of the analysis involves the use of scale functions , defined as follows .",
    "for every @xmath25 there exists a function @xmath26 such that @xmath27 for all @xmath28 and otherwise is almost everywhere differentiable on @xmath29 satisfying , @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the largest solution to the equation @xmath32 ( there are at most two )",
    ". we shall write for short @xmath33 .",
    "it is known that when @xmath6 has paths of unbounded variation , the scale functions @xmath34 are continuously differentiable on @xmath35 , and when @xmath6 has paths of bounded variation , they are almost everywhere differentiable . in either case",
    "we shall denote by @xmath36 the associated density .",
    "it is also known that if @xmath6 has a gaussian component then @xmath34 is twice continuously differentiable on @xmath35 .",
    "there exists a well known exponential change of measure that one may perform for spectrally negative lvy processes , @xmath37 for @xmath38 and @xmath39 under which @xmath6 remains within the class of spectrally negative lvy processes . in particular",
    "if @xmath40 is the lvy measure of @xmath41 under @xmath4 then @xmath42 is its lvy measure under @xmath43 .",
    "it will turn out to be useful to introduce an additional parameter to the scale functions described above in the light of this change of measure .",
    "henceforth we shall refer to the functions @xmath44 where @xmath39 as the functions that play the role of the scale functions defined in the previous paragraph but when considered under the measures @xmath43 .",
    "next define @xmath45 with the convention @xmath46 . for @xmath47 define @xmath48 by differentiating ( [ gamma - bar ] )",
    "latter we note that since @xmath49 it follows that @xmath50 is a strictly increasing function .",
    "moreover , since it is continuous it has a well defined inverse on @xmath51 which we denote by @xmath52 .",
    "we may now present the three main results of this paper as promised .",
    "their proofs will be given in the subsequent sections .",
    "for each @xmath53 , the process @xmath54 , @xmath15 , serves as a local time at @xmath55 for the markov process @xmath56 under @xmath57 .",
    "write @xmath58 for the right continuous inverse of @xmath59 .",
    "[ t : survival ] for any @xmath60 , we have @xmath61 = \\exp\\left\\{-\\int_x^a \\frac{w^{(q)\\prime}(y)}{w^{(q)}(y)(1-\\gamma(\\bar{\\gamma}^{-1}(y)))}dy \\right\\}.\\ ] ]    [ npv ] for any @xmath60 , we have @xmath62= \\int_x^\\infty \\exp\\left\\{- \\int_x^t \\frac{w^{(q)\\prime}(\\bar\\gamma(s))}{w^{(q ) } ( \\bar\\gamma(s ) ) } ds\\right\\ } \\gamma(t)dt.\\ ] ]    [ g - s ] for each @xmath15 let @xmath63 and let @xmath64 , the last moment that tax is paid before ruin .",
    "denote by @xmath65 the jump measure of @xmath41 . for any @xmath66 and @xmath67",
    ", we have @xmath68 furthermore , we also have , @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the gaussian coefficient in the lvy - it decomposition of @xmath6 .",
    "when @xmath71 is a constant , we note that the expressions ( [ e : laplace ] ) and ( [ dividends ] ) agree with formulas ( 3.1 ) and ( 3.2 ) in @xcite .",
    "indeed we have @xmath72 . for theorem [ t : survival ]",
    "we have @xmath73 = \\exp\\left\\{-\\int_x^a \\frac{w^{(q)\\prime}(y)}{w^{(q)}(y)(1-\\gamma)}dy \\right\\}=\\left(\\frac{w^{(q)}(x)}{w^{(q)}(a)}\\right)^{1/(1-\\gamma)}.\\ ] ] for theorem [ npv ] we have by two changes of variables @xmath74 which is formula ( 3.2 ) in @xcite .    theorem [ g - s ] on the other hand gives a new result for the setting of @xcite . in particular , we have @xmath75 and @xmath76    finally note that when @xmath77 and the process @xmath24 agrees with the lvy insurance risk process @xmath6 , the last two formulae above give us two new expressions for the time value of the overall maximal wealth accumulated prior to ruin , the wealth immediately before ruin and the deficit at ruin .",
    "one major criticism of working with scale functions is that , in principle , one has only solved the problems of interest up to inverting the laplace transform ( [ eq : scale ] ) .",
    "however , in the last year there have been a number of developments in the theory of scale functions which has seen a large number of explicit examples appearing in the literature ; including the case of cramr - lundberg models .",
    "see for example @xcite .",
    "the paper @xcite also gives recipes for evaluating scale functions numerically .",
    "we begin this section by pointing out some important features of the running supremum of the aggregate process ( [ agg ] ) which turns out to be key in our use of excursion theory in the forthcoming proofs .",
    "note that on the one hand @xmath81 on the other hand since @xmath82 we have @xmath83 and hence , since @xmath84 for all @xmath85 , @xmath86 together ( [ upper ] ) and ( [ lower ] ) imply ( [ u - sup ] ) .",
    "now suppose that @xmath87 .",
    "this implies that @xmath88 and hence @xmath89 . on the other hand , if @xmath90 , then @xmath91 showing that @xmath92 and hence @xmath93 .",
    "@xmath94    for the remaining proofs we shall also make heavy use of excursion theory for the process @xmath95 for which we refer to @xcite for background reading . we shall spend a moment here setting up some necessary notation which will be used throughout the remainder of the paper .",
    "the poisson process of excursions indexed by local time shall be denoted by @xmath96 where @xmath97 whenever @xmath98 .",
    "accordingly we refer to a generic excursion as @xmath99 ( or just @xmath100 for short as appropriate ) belonging to the space @xmath101 of canonical excursions .",
    "the intensity measure of the process @xmath96 is given by @xmath102 where @xmath103 is a measure on the space of excursions ( the excursion measure ) .",
    "an @xmath103-measurable functional of the canonical excursion which will be of prime interest is @xmath104 .",
    "a useful formula for this functional that we shall make use of is the following ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath105 providing that @xmath106 is not a point of discontinuity in the derivative of @xmath107 ( which is only a concern when @xmath6 has paths of bounded variation , in which case there are at most a countable number ) .",
    "lemma [ suprema ] also has an important bearing on the process of excursions described above .",
    "indeed , from the identity ( [ u - sup ] ) we note that if @xmath108 , or equivalently @xmath109 , under @xmath57 , then @xmath110 .",
    "moreover , @xmath111 , or equivalently @xmath112 , under @xmath57 and the excursions of @xmath24 away from its maximum agree precisely with @xmath113 .",
    "taking account of the remarks following lemma [ suprema ] we have that the event @xmath114 is the same as @xmath115 then , for @xmath53 , @xmath116 where we change the variable making use of the fact that , since @xmath117 , we have from the chain rule @xmath118 next , note that @xmath119\\notag\\\\ & = & \\exp\\left\\{\\phi(q)\\left(\\bar{\\gamma}^{-1}(a)-x\\right)\\right\\ } \\be_x \\left [ e^{-q \\tau^+_a } \\ind_{\\{\\tau_a^+ < \\tau_0 ^ -\\}}\\right ] \\label{one}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have appealed to the change of measure ( [ com ] ) with @xmath120 and the final equality follows by virtue of the fact that on @xmath121 @xmath122 where in the second equality we have made the change of variable @xmath123 .",
    "note also that it is known ( cf .",
    "chapter 8 of @xcite ) that for @xmath124 , @xmath125 and hence @xmath126 piecing together ( [ one ] ) , ( [ two ] ) and ( [ three ] ) we get @xmath127\\\\ & = \\bp_x^{\\phi(q ) } ( \\tau_a^+ < \\tau_0 ^ - ) \\exp\\left\\{-\\phi(q)\\left(\\bar{\\gamma}^{-1}(a)-x \\right)\\right\\ } \\\\ & = \\exp \\left\\{-\\int_x^{a } \\frac{{w_{\\phi(q)}}^{\\prime}(y)}{w_{\\phi(q)}(y)(1-\\gamma(\\bar{\\gamma}^{-1}(y ) ) ) } \\ , dy \\right\\}\\exp\\left\\{-\\phi(q)\\left(\\bar{\\gamma}^{-1}(a)-u \\right)\\right\\}\\\\ & = \\exp\\left\\{-\\int_x^a\\frac{w^{(q)\\prime}(y)}{w^{(q)}(y)(1-\\gamma(\\bar{\\gamma}^{-1}(y)))}dy\\right\\ } , \\end{split}\\ ] ] where we have also used the fact that @xmath128 the proof is now complete . @xmath94",
    "the proof builds on the experience of the calculations in the previous proof .",

    "the proof is completed by applying a straightforward change of variables .",
    "@xmath94    before turning the proof of theorem [ g - s ] , we need first to prove an additional auxiliary result . to this end , define @xmath134 , the first passage time above @xmath135 of the canonical excursion @xmath100 .",
    "we also need the first passage times for the underlying lvy process @xmath6 , @xmath136 for all @xmath38 .",
