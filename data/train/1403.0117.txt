    "charged hadron - hadron correlations have been extensively studied since the isr and s@xmath4s experiments in the mid 70 s  @xcite .",
    "these measurements have provided a good basis for investigating fragmentation processes .",
    "well before jet reconstruction methods were born , these correlation measurements have been applied more recently in relativistic heavy - ion collisions where full jet reconstruction is challenging , especially at low jet energies .",
    "the focus of these studies was to investigate medium effects such as back - to - back jet suppression and modifications of the fragmentation process .",
    "additionally , the discovery of long - range correlation structures in p - p , p - pb and pb - pb collisions at the lhc was based on two - particle correlation measurements  @xcite .",
    "various hadronization and hydrodynamical models of the space - time evolution of the hot and dense color medium , which have been employed to describe these phenomena , rely heavily on assumed parton and hadron distributions . nevertheless , the measured hadron spectra and extracted fragmentation functions are integrated distributions which mix up all possible contributions of parton - hadron channels via the convolution of initial - state , qcd and final state effects of high energy collisions  @xcite .",
    "the only way to decouple the specific hadronization contributions is to test the conservation of quantum numbers by tracing the baryon number and flavor - specific emission patterns of hadrons from the partonic medium .",
    "this study focuses on the identified - hadron correlations , which is related to the hadronization mechanisms . here",
    ", the baryon - to - meson ratio ( for light and strange particles ) is enhanced by more than a factor of three in pb - pb collisions compared to p - p collisions  @xcite .",
    "since this unique kinematic range separates the low momentum thermal bulk production from the parton fragmentation dominated regime at high momenta , the expected production mechanism is of particular interest . on the other hand , the question of quantum number conservation during the phase transition from the partonic to the hadronic world can be addressed only through correlations beyond the simple baryon - to - meson ratios .    in this short review",
    "we investigate the strength of the expected effects revealed by pid - triggered hadron - hadron correlations in high - energy p - p and pb - pb collisions at lhc energies in the mid - rapidity region ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "this region represents the sensitive geometrical areas of the rhic / lhc detectors , that are common to star , phenix , alice , atlas and cms .",
    "in this study we focused on the generated identified particles : @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and the charged hadrons @xmath10 as a reference .",
    "event generators pythia  6.4  @xcite and hijing  1.36  @xcite were used for the production of p - p and pb - pb event samples .",
    "the perugia-0 tune  @xcite was chosen for pythia .",
    "hijing event generation included the simulated effects of quenching and shadowing .",
    "the generated data include 200 million p - p events at @xmath11  tev and 4 million central ( @xmath2 ) pb - pb events at @xmath12 @xmath13tev .",
    "all charged final - state particles were kept for analysis from the monte carlo events , nevertheless the trigger particles and associated particles used for the two - particle correlations measurements were limited in pseudorapidity .",
    "trigger particles with @xmath14 and the associated particles with @xmath15 were rejected . in order to exclude the low - momentum region from the bulk effects ,",
    "the transverse momenta of the trigger particles were considered above @xmath16  gev / c in all the cases .",
    "the associated particle momenta were chosen such that @xmath17 to avoid double counting .",
    "the uncorrelated background was subtracted by the zyam method  @xcite .",
    "measuring quantum number conservation requires constraints both on the trigger and the associated particle directions to tighten the sensitivity of the measurement .",
    "the associated per trigger yield is defined with the following quantity as a function of pseudorapidity difference @xmath18 and azimuthal angle difference @xmath19 : @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 is the number of trigger and associated particles , respectively .",
    "this quantity was measured in several @xmath23 and @xmath24 intervals .",
    "the azimuthal angle correlations in this study are always projected within the pseudorapidity difference @xmath25 .",
    "the associated per trigger yield on the near - side was extracted from the @xmath26 interval @xmath27 and the away - side from the @xmath26 interval @xmath28 .      to test the quantum number conservation with @xmath24 the identified associated spectra of the associated particles ( hereafter called pid - associated spectra )",
    "have been plotted .",
    "we have investigated the pid - associated raw spectra using @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and charged hadron @xmath29 triggers .",
    "figure  [ fig : pid - triggered_spectra ] shows the raw ( unnormalized ) identified particle yields @xmath30 for the identified associated particles up to @xmath31 gev / c .",
    "the pid - associated spectra have been plotted for positively charged pions , as trigger particles , selected from the transverse momentum range .",
    "the upper row ( figure  [ fig : pid - triggered_spectra ] @xmath32 and @xmath33 ) shows the @xmath11 tev p - p pythia results and the lower row ( figure  [ fig : pid - triggered_spectra ] @xmath34 and @xmath35 ) shows the @xmath2 central pb - pb collisions at 2.76 @xmath13tev from hijing .",
    "the left column shows the spectra extracted from the near - side and the right column shows the spectra extracted from the away - side .",
    "the pid - associated spectra of the different associated particle species show the expected evolution with the transverse momentum .",
    "the yields of the pid - associated spectra significantly decrease with the selection of charged pion , kaon and proton triggers .      at the monte carlo event generator level , the basic conservation laws of the quantum numbers  such as charge ( @xmath36 ) , baryon number ( @xmath37 ) , and strangeness ( @xmath38)are fulfilled and reflected in the pid - associated spectra after the hadronization process . to extract and enhance the expected quantum number conservation effects , we use the following ratio : @xmath39",
    "which is the pid - triggered to charged hadron - triggered ratio of the pid - associated particle spectra , that is the case when we plot the associated spectra having an identified trigger compared to the one when we have a unidentified ( charged hadron ) trigger .",
    "furthermore , it can be understood as a specific normalization to the hadron - triggered associated spectra .",

    "a visible splitting effect is observed for all the trigger species starting from the first @xmath24 bin up to @xmath46 gev / c .",
    "the largest splitting is observed in the unlike - sign correlation , @xmath45 , where there is approximately @xmath47-times more anti - protons than protons above a specific @xmath24 bin , that is the splitting strength is about an order of magnitude larger than the like - sign correlation @xmath44 .",
    "the splitting , in case of unlike - sign pairs , for @xmath43 is weaker than in the @xmath45 but still comparable with it but the @xmath41 shows very weak splitting .",
    "in contrast , the away - side p - p ratios , in fig .  [ fig : pid - triggered_ratio ]  @xmath33 , show an equal ratio for the pions and protons ( compared to the near - side in fig .",
    "[ fig : pid - triggered_ratio ]  @xmath32 ) .",
    "conversely , kaons show a weak splitting in a limited transverse momentum range with respect to the near - side . the baryon number and charge",
    "is conserved and leads to highly correlated distributions in the same cone , since the fragmentation process was not modified by the media .",
    "these qualitative observations show that the strength of the quantum number conservation effects is increasing in the order of charge ( @xmath36 ) , strangeness ( @xmath38 ) and baryon number ( @xmath37 ) respectively . in case of hadron correlations with multiple quantum number conservation ( @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 ,   etc . )",
    "this effect will be stronger .",
    "[ fig : pid - triggered_ratio ]  @xmath34  and  @xmath35 exhibit a peculiar pattern for the case of hijing on the near- and away - side in the @xmath48 gev / c range for charged kaons and protons , where the baryon / meson anomaly was observed at rhic and at the lhc  @xcite , followed by the reversal of the splitting trend at higher transverse momenta .",
    "the charged pions show the splitting pattern only on the near - side .    the lack of the splitting effect below @xmath49 gev / c may be attributed to the fact that in hijing the embedded mini - jet production starts to appear around this scale . on the away - side ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pid - triggered_ratio ] @xmath35 ) , it can be seen that the effect is opposite to the pythia ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pid - triggered_ratio ] @xmath33 ) , there are more like - sign particles coming from that region .",
    "although it is much smaller than in the near - side , but not negligible .",
    "moreover , we believe that the observed splitting of the protons and anti - protons presumably related to the embedded parametrization of baryon number and charge in hijing .",
    "further studies are ongoing to characterize better the observed splitting effects that provide an interesting contrast point between various mc event generators and experimental results from the lhc .      in the previous subsection",
    "the associated particle spectra were studied in the case that the trigger particles have @xmath50 in a wide range ( ) . in this section",
    "we investigate the @xmath23 dependence of the spectra .",
    "we plot the differences between the like - sign and unlike - sign particle pairs for the normalized yields @xmath51 as plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : pid - triggered_ratio ] .",
    "since positively charged triggers were choosen we came to the definition below in order to plot these ratios higher than one :    @xmath52    where @xmath53 and @xmath54 denote the unlike - sign and like - sign trigger / associated particle pairs , respectively .",

    "concerning strange particles it seems to saturate at higher @xmath24 . for pions",
    "the relative difference is about factor of @xmath55 at most .",
    "there is almost no change in the ordering of the species in the other @xmath23 bins , @xmath56  gev / c , @xmath57  gev / c , and @xmath58  gev / c , and the shapes remain at the same level .    concerning the away - side , in fig .",

    "the number of @xmath59 s produced ( compared to @xmath60 s ) is proportional to @xmath24 .",
    "this trend is unexpected and completely opposite to the pythia on the away - side for all the @xmath23 bins .",
    "moreover , the effect manifests with similar magnitude within any @xmath23 ranges . in summary , these effects are observed in the central pb - pb collisions within the @xmath61 gev / c transverse momentum range , where the cronin effect  @xcite and the baryon / meson anomaly act .",

    "recall that the spectra , mentioned previously , are baseline - subtracted by applying the zyam - method .",

    "higher trigger momentum @xmath23 yields a narrower near - side peak , whereas higher associated momentum particles @xmath24 result in a lower associated particle yield .",
    "nevertheless , the amplitude of the correlation peak stays approximately constant on the away - side as a function of @xmath23 .",
    "if we compare the columns , that is the different trigger / associated particle pairs , we can observe that on the near - side , the ratio of the number of the associated particles to the trigger particles is less for strange particles with respect to the baryons compared to the pions . there is a hint that the same effect is visible on the away - side , but a more thorough study is needed .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : phi_distr_hijing ] the distributions for the pb - pb events , generated by hijing , show the same trend that is seen on the near - side for the pythia events .",
    "the difference between pythia and hijing in terms of the chosen trigger / assoc - iated species is evident , practically there is only a small flavour and charge correlation effect in hijing at all studied @xmath23 momentum bin .",
    "moreover , the number of associated particles for kaons and protons has the same order of magnitude on the near - side as well as on the away - side .",
    "monte carlo studies of two - particle azimuthal correlations have been performed with identified trigger particles and identified associated particles in p - p collisions at @xmath62  tev and in pb - pb collisions at @xmath63tev at mid - rapidity . as for the first verification of the generated samples",
    "the identified hadrons were extracted from the raw associated particle spectra : @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 with fixed positively charged pion ( @xmath64 ) trigger in two separated @xmath26 regions , near- and away - side .",
    "further investigation was needed to look deeper into the validity of the quantum number conservations of correlated particle pairs .",
    "for this reason we plotted the identified associated spectra for like - sign and unlike - sign trigger / associated particle pairs compared to the charged hadron identified associated spectra .",
    "we obtained conclusive results for pythia : the pid - triggered - to - hadron - triggered associated spectra on the near - side show a significant splitting between the particles and anti - particles which have the largest effect for the baryon triggers , but is absent on the away - side .",
    "qualitatively the difference between the baryon triggers and the pions is about one order of magnitude . for the hijing simulation the results show an opposite trend to the pythia up to @xmath68 gev / c and these effects are not vanishing on the away - side except for the pions .",
    "the splitting in pb - pb collisions starts at slightly larger @xmath24 threshold than in p - p because of the embedded physics in hijing ( for example the minijet production ) , but further investigation is needed with real data to confirm this observation . to conclude :",
