    "in image and video compression , the two - dimensional discrete cosine transform ( 2d - dct ) is very popular for its well - known energy compaction properties @xcite .",
    "the 2d - dct is obtained applying two separable 1d - dct transforms along the vertical and horizontal directions , respectively . for this reason ,",
    "it is very efficient at compressing images in which horizontal or vertical edges are dominating @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , when blocks contain significant directional features and arbitrarily shaped discontinuities the 2d - dct compression is less efficient @xcite .    to overcome this problem ,",
    "various approaches and solutions have been developed @xcite , most of which consist in modifications of the 2d - dct in order to incorporate directional information @xcite .",
    "the directional dct ( ddct ) presented in @xcite is the first attempt in this sense .",
    "it consists in a separable transform in which the first 1d - dct may follow a direction other than the vertical or horizontal one ; then the coefficients produced by all directional transforms in the first step are rearranged so that the second transform can be applied to those coefficients that are best aligned with each other .",
    "later , other works have followed this approach . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors have introduced new directions for the first transform and have proposed a new zigzag scanning method . in @xcite , it is suggested to not apply the second - stage dct , or to apply it only on the dc coefficients generated during the first transform @xcite . in @xcite , ddct @xcite",
    "is improved using anisotropic local basis supports , where the optimal basis is selected exploiting the bintree structure of the dictionary .",
    "these methods , however , have several issues .",
    "in particular , they require 1d - dcts of various lengths , some of which are very short and are not always a power of 2 ; moreover , the second dct may not always be applied to coefficients of similar ac frequencies @xcite . in our tests",
    ", we have also noticed that the performance of the ddct decreases when the block size increases .",
    "another method to introduce directionality in the dct has been presented in @xcite , where directional primary operations have been introduced for the lifting - based dct . in this way",
    ", the dct - like lifting transform can be applied along any direction , but it extends across block boundaries in order to apply direction adaptation .    in the specific case of intra - frame video coding , another approach has been investigated : the transform is constructed by a directional prediction and a corresponding data - dependent transform . in @xcite , mode - dependent directional transforms have been derived from karhunen - love transform , using prediction residuals from training video data .",
    "various follow - up works have then enhanced @xcite exploiting the symmetry to reduce the number of transform matrices needed @xcite .",
    "a common problem of these methods is that training sets must be processed to obtain transforms that are optimal for a given class , so the transform is always dependent on the training set used .    in the last few years , a new approach to image and video coding has been emerging , i.e. , transforms on graphs . an image can be viewed as a graph , where each pixel is a node of the graph and the describe the connectivity relations among pixels , e.g. , in terms of similarity @xcite .",
    "it is possible to define a transform on this domain , called graph fourier transform @xcite .",
    "thanks to the graph representation , the corresponding transform is `` aware '' of image discontinuities , which are downplayed so as to minimize generation of high - frequency coefficients and maximize energy compaction .",
    "block - based methods using graph fourier transform have been proposed in @xcite , but they reported unsatisfactory results on natural images that are not piece - wise smooth .",
    "however , one of the main drawbacks of graph - based compression techniques lies in the cost required to represent and encode the graph , which may outweigh the coding gain provided by the edge adaptive transform . for this reason ,",
    "some graph - based compression methods that require a small overhead have recently been developed @xcite ; their performance is competitive compared to the dct , but the price is a high computational cost to construct the transform matrix .    in our previous work @xcite , we have presented a new framework for directional transforms .",
    "starting from the graph transform of a grid graph , we have designed a new transform , called steerable dct ( sdct ) , which can be obtained by rotating the 2d - dct basis by a single given angle for each image block .    in this paper , we analyse the broader problem of finding the best _ set of rotations _ of the 2d - dct basis for each image block . in particular , we generalize @xcite considering an angle for each frequency , which can potentially provide a more compact representation at the price of more side information to transmit .",
    "the tradeoff can be analysed from a rd perspective .",
    "we first cast the problem as the minimization of a rd functional .",
    "the minimum provides the optimal number of rotation angles per block as well as the angles values .",
    "the problem is well - posed ( the global minimum exists ) , but it is non - convex , hence finding the global minimum is tricky .",
    "the best feasible strategy that one can conceive in such case is iterative alternated minimization , that allows to get to a local minimum or a saddle .",
    "this is the basis of our first proposed algorithm , named steerable dct through alternated minimization ( sdct - am ) .",
    "if suitably initialized , sdct - am is proved to always outperform dct in rd terms .",
    "we have also investigated other strategies to define and transmit the angles distribution , in order to reduce the angles transmission cost , and propose a subdivisions into subbands that can be encoded as a binary tree .",
    "this is the key idea for our second proposed algorithm , named sdct - bt , which significantly decreases the amount of side information .",
    "moreover , while in @xcite the sdct performance is assessed only in terms of energy compaction , in this paper we develop a fully fledged image encoder to compare the proposed technique with other competing transforms .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : graph ] we define the proposed transform , starting from graph transforms . afterwards , in section [ sec : optimal_rotation ] we state our problem in terms of a rd optimization problem , and define the optimal rotation . in section [ sec : algorithms ] , we present the sdct - am and sdct - bt algorithms . section [ sec : experimental ] is devoted to experimental tests , in which we compare our method to 2d - dct and directional methods .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : conc ] we draw some conclusions .",
    "we first review some elements of graph signal processing , specifically the concept of graph fourier transform and its relation to dct .",
    "we denote an undirected graph as @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the set of vertices and @xmath2 is the set of . given two graphs @xmath3 and @xmath4 , let @xmath5 be the product graph of @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "suppose @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , @xmath11 .",
    "then @xmath12 and @xmath13 are adjacent in @xmath14 if and only if one of the following conditions is satisfied @xcite : a ) @xmath15 and @xmath16 ; b ) @xmath17 and @xmath18 .    for any graph @xmath0 with @xmath19",
    ", we define the adjacency matrix @xmath20 , where @xmath21 if there is an edge between node @xmath22 and @xmath23 , otherwise @xmath24 . in this paper",
    ", we consider undirected graphs with no self loops , that is , @xmath25 is symmetric and has null diagonal .",
    "the laplacian matrix of a graph @xmath14 is defined as @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the adjacency matrix , and @xmath28 is a diagonal matrix with @xmath29 equal to the number of edges incident to node @xmath22 .",
    "any signal @xmath30 can be associated with a graph @xmath31 with @xmath19 @xcite ; each component @xmath32 , @xmath33 is associated with vertex @xmath34 .",
    "on @xmath35 , we define the so - called graph fourier transform @xcite of @xmath36 as follows : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the matrix whose columns are the eigenvectors of @xmath39 .",
    "@xmath36 can be easily retrieved from @xmath40 by inversion : @xmath41 .    , ( b ) the square grid graph @xmath42.,width=151 ]    ( a )    , ( b ) the square grid graph @xmath42.,width=151 ]    ( b )    one can also recast some existing transforms as graph fourier transforms on a specific topology .",
    "an example is the equivalence between the 1d - dct and the graph fourier transform of a path graph .",
    "we define a path graph @xmath43 as a graph with @xmath44 vertices and line topology , as shown in figure [ fig : struct](a ) .",
    "it is known that the eigenvectors of @xmath45 are equal to the basis vectors of the 1d - dct ( more precisely dct-2 ) @xcite .",
    "specifically , the 1d - dct has @xmath44 basis vectors @xmath46 which are defined as    @xmath47    each @xmath48 is the eigenvector of @xmath45 , for any @xmath49 , @xmath50 , associated with the eigenvalue @xmath51 given that the multiplicity of the eigenvalues in is always equal to 1 , the 1d - dct basis is the unique eigenbasis for @xmath45 , therefore the graph fourier transform for a signal represented by a path graph is equivalent to the 1d - dct transform .",
    "let us now consider the product graph of two path graphs , as shown in figure [ fig : struct](b ) . if the two path graphs have the same number of vertices , their product graph @xmath52 is a square grid graph with @xmath53 vertices .",
    "it has been proved that the basis vectors of the 2d - dct form an eigenbasis of @xmath54 @xcite .    moreover , the spectrum of the laplacian of a product graph depends on the spectrum of the two generator graphs , as illustrated in the following theorem .",
    "[ theo : compute_eigen ] let @xmath6 and @xmath7 be graphs on @xmath55 and @xmath56 vertices , respectively .",
    "then the eigenvalues of @xmath57 are all possible sums of @xmath58 , with @xmath59 and @xmath60 . moreover ,",
    "if @xmath61 is an eigenvector of @xmath6 corresponding to @xmath62 , @xmath63 an eigenvector of @xmath7 corresponding to @xmath64 , then @xmath65 ( where @xmath66 indicates the kronecker product ) is an eigenvector of @xmath14 corresponding to @xmath58 .      leveraging the results presented in the previous paragraph",
    ", we build a new transform that can be oriented in any direction . using theorem [ theo : compute_eigen ] and equations and",
    ", we can compute the eigenvalues and the eigenvectors of @xmath54 ( which , for simplicity , are labeled with a double index ) : @xmath67",
    "@xmath68 where @xmath48 is the eigenvector of @xmath69 corresponding to @xmath70 and @xmath71 is the eigenvector corresponding to @xmath72 . from ( [ eq3 ] ) , it is evident that some repeated eigenvalues are present , due to symmetry : @xmath73 for @xmath74 .",
    "moreover , through straightforward computations , it is possible to prove that the eigenvalue @xmath75 has algebraic multiplicity @xmath76 and corresponds to all eigenvalues @xmath77 with @xmath78 .",
    "therefore , in the spectrum of @xmath50 there are only @xmath76 eigenvalues with algebraic multiplicity equal to 1 ( i.e. @xmath79 with @xmath80 ) , and all the others but @xmath77 have algebraic multiplicity 2 .",
    "it is important to highlight that even if @xmath73 when @xmath74 , we still have that @xmath81 and @xmath82 are linearly independent , because the kronecker product is not commutative .",
    "therefore , the geometric multiplicity is equal to the algebraic multiplicity .",
    "this means that the dimension of the eigenspaces corresponding to these eigenvalues is bigger than one .",
    "this proves the following proposition .",
    "the 2d - dct is not the unique eigenbasis for the laplacian of a square grid graph .    ):",
    "the corresponding two eigenvectors of an eigenvalue with multiplicity 2 are highlighted in red , the @xmath76 eigenvectors corresponding to @xmath75 are highlighted in blue and the @xmath76 eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalues with algebraic multiplicity 1 are highlighted in green.,width=241 ]    in figure [ fig : basisdct ] the 2d - dct basis with @xmath83 is represented in matrix form ; as an example , we have highlighted in red the corresponding two eigenvectors of an eigenvalue with multiplicity 2 : we can see that they are clearly related to each other , since they represent the same frequency , one in the horizontal direction and the other in the vertical direction .",
    "since the 2d - dct is not the unique eigenbasis for @xmath54 , we aim to find all the other possible eigenbases and choose as transform matrix the one that better fits the properties of the specific image block that we are about to encode .",
    "given an eigenvalue @xmath84 of @xmath54 with multiplicity 2 and the two vectors of the 2d - dct @xmath81 and @xmath82 that are the eigenvectors of @xmath54 corresponding to @xmath84 , we can write any other possible basis of the eigenspace corresponding to @xmath84 as the result of a rotation of @xmath81 and @xmath82 @xmath85 where @xmath86 is an angle in @xmath87 $ ] .    for every @xmath84 with multiplicity 2",
    ", we can rotate the corresponding eigenvectors as shown in ( [ eq : rot ] ) ; the @xmath76 eigenvectors corresponding to @xmath75 are rotated in pairs @xmath88 and @xmath89 , if @xmath90 is even @xmath91 is not rotated . in the 2d - dct matrix , the pairs @xmath81 and @xmath82 are replaced with the rotated ones @xmath92 and @xmath93 obtaining a new transform matrix @xmath94 that can be defined only by the rotation angles used , which we have to transmit to the decoder . the number of angles used is equal to the number of rotated pairs , that is @xmath95 .",
    "the new transform matrix @xmath96 can be written as @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the 2d - dct transform matrix , @xmath99 is the vector containing all the angles used and @xmath100 is the rotation matrix , whose structure is defined so that , for each pair of vectors , it performs the rotation as defined in .",
    "@xmath101 can be decomposed in two matrices as @xmath102 where @xmath103 is a constant matrix representing the vectors that do not rotate , and @xmath104 represents the vectors that are rotated .",

    "then , for any signal @xmath117 our new transform , which in the following will be referred to as sdct , is defined as follows : @xmath118     components of @xmath119.,width=170 ]    the components @xmath86 of @xmath119 are ordered using the zigzag pattern shown in figure [ fig : ord ] . unlike the classical zigzag ordering , in this case we consider only @xmath120 elements , since @xmath121 and the diagonal elements @xmath122 are not considered , since the eigenvectors @xmath123 do not rotate .",
    "the transform is still the graph transform of a square grid graph , but with a different set of orientations with respect to dct . as an example , in figure [ fig : basisrdct ] , we show the basis vectors obtained rotating by @xmath124 every pair of eigenvectors . as can be seen , the diagonal elements @xmath123 are the same as the dct ones because the corresponding eigenvalues have multiplicity one , instead all the others are rotated by @xmath124 .",
    "in the previous section , we have shown that a new transform can be derived rotating @xmath125 columns of an @xmath126 dct matrix .",
    "the aim of this section is to determine the set of _ optimal _ rotation angles under a suitable criterion .",
    "since our ultimate goal is efficient compression , a sparse ( i.e. , with many null coefficients ) vector of transform coefficients is desirable .",
    "we now illustrate that we can find analytically the rotation @xmath119 that provides the sparsest coefficient representation .",
    "let @xmath127 be the original ( vectorized ) image block .",
    "given an eigenvalue @xmath84 of @xmath50 with geometric multiplicity @xmath128 and its corresponding eigenvectors @xmath81 and @xmath82 , for a given block , the corresponding dct coefficients can be expressed as @xmath129 @xmath130 if we rotate this pair of eigenvectors by an angle @xmath131 either of the two corresponding coefficients becomes null .",
    "in fact , given @xmath92 and @xmath93 , which are obtained rotating @xmath81 and @xmath82 by @xmath86 as in , the new transform coefficients are @xmath132 @xmath133    from , we conclude that @xmath134 and all the energy of this coefficient pair is conveyed to @xmath135 , as shown in figure [ fig : opt ] .",
    "transform coefficients are exactly null.,width=226 ]    this is obviously advantageous as it provides a lossless encoding of the image with @xmath136 coefficients instead of @xmath137 .",
    "nevertheless , since the decoder should also know the @xmath120 rotation angles to recover the image , the total number of values to transmit turns out to be the same .",
    "the optimal choice of the number and value of rotation angles can be naturally cast as a rd problem in the variables @xmath138 and @xmath119 .",
    "let @xmath139 be the steered transform matrix , @xmath127 be the image block , @xmath140 be the ordered set of angles , and @xmath141 be the coefficients in the transform . as a distortion metric",
    "we employ the reconstruction error : @xmath142 we consider two rate contributions , that is , the transform coefficients rate @xmath143 and the rotation angles rate @xmath144 .",
    "the total rate is @xmath145 .    in @xcite",
    ", it has been shown that for dct transforms there is an approximately linear relationship between the coding bitrate @xmath143 and the @xmath146-norm of @xmath40 , that is , the number of its non - zero coefficients , i.e. @xmath147 where @xmath148 can be empirically found @xcite .",
    "let us now discuss @xmath144 . in @xcite",
    ", we have considered the simple case of using the same angle for all the eigenspaces , and concluded that this is sufficient to outperform classical 2d - dct .",
    "our aim is now to study the intermediate cases , seeking the optimal number and values of angles yielding the best balance between recovery accuracy and rate .",
    "specifically , we split the angles into subbands of dct coefficients , choosing a single angle for all coefficients in each subband , so that the vector @xmath119 is piecewise constant .",
    "let @xmath149 be the number of subbands : if @xmath150 , instead of transmitting @xmath120 angles , we require only @xmath149 angles values and @xmath149 indexes indicating where the subvectors end . assuming no compression for the angles and a quantization over @xmath151 values in @xmath152 $ ] for each angle , the transmission amounts to @xmath153 , which clearly increases much slower than than @xmath154 .",

    "the problem is similar to sparse signal recovery problems , for which hard thresholding techniques can be used @xcite .",

    "this can be derived as a simpler subcase of iterative hard thresholding for sparse problems ( * ? ? ?",
    "* equation 2.1 - 2.2 ) : since our transform matrix is orthogonal , the procedure stops after one iteration .    our problem is made more difficult by the non - convexity of the distortion term due to the variable @xmath119 .",
    "however , we remark that the problem is well posed , because it is lower bounded by 0 , and it is proper ( if @xmath138 goes to infinity , @xmath171 tends to infinity as well ) .",
    "this encourages to search a solution ; to this end , we undertake alternated minimization on separated variables . in particular , we notice that the problem can be analytically solved with respect to the individual variables @xmath138 and @xmath172 .",

    "we start from a single angle value , say one subband , and we iteratively decide if it is convenient to split into different subbands .",
    "specifically , we impose that each subband can be divided into two subbands of equal length if this decreases @xmath171 ( spare pairs of vectors are included in the last group ) , as shown in figure [ fig : sub ] .",

    "<S> in image compression , classical block - based separable transforms tend to be inefficient when image blocks contain arbitrarily shaped discontinuities . </S>",
