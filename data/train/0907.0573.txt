    "the unified model of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) @xcite assumes the existence of dust torus that surrounds the central hierarchical structure consisting of a super massive black hole , an accretion disk , and a broad line region ( blr ) .",
    "the dust grains in the torus absorb the uv / optical continuum emission from the accretion disk and re - radiate in the near infrared ( ir ) wavelength region with some lag time corresponding to the light travel time from the accretion disk to the inner radius of dust torus .",
    "since the heated dust eventually sublimates at a constant temperature of 1500 - 1800k , a more luminous agn should have a larger dust torus and hence a larger lag time , yielding a correlation of @xmath5 between lag time @xmath2 and agn luminosity @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "in fact , based on the long - term multicolor monitoring data from the magnum project @xcite and available archival data , @xcite recently reported such a correlation from a sample of agns spanning a wide range of absolute @xmath4-magnitude from @xmath6 to @xmath7 .",
    "the optical luminosity is a good indicator of uv luminosity , because their variations are well synchronized with each other @xcite .",
    "therefore , the reported correlation in the @xmath4 band indicates that the inner radius of dust torus scales with the uv luminosity as well , which provides a strong piece of evidence for dust reverberation proceeding in the central region of agns .",
    "given the above result of scaling among agns of different luminosities , it is possible to examine how @xmath2 would scale with changing @xmath3 in an individual agn .",
    "this is currently an only diagnosis on its inner structure which is too small to be resolved by direct imaging .",
    "however , since a range of flux variation in an agn is as small as @xmath8 mag , detection of a change of @xmath2 is indeed a challenge and needs an elaborate method that enables precise estimation of @xmath2 .",
    "we here attempt to detect , if any , a change of @xmath2 for the case of a nearby seyfert 1 agn of ngc 4151 , using the six year log accurate and frequent monitoring data for bright agns in the program of magnum .    in section [ sec : app ]",
    ", we show details of observation of ngc4151 . in section [ sec : mod ] and section [ sec : tes ] we formulate estimation of @xmath2 and @xmath3 , by making use of model light curves . in section [ sec : ana ] we apply the formulation to the case of ngc 4151 and derive its time - changing track in the @xmath2 versus @xmath3 diagram . in section [ sec : dis ] we discuss time scale of dust formation in the central region of ngc 4151 .",
    "ngc4151 is one of the bright agns most frequently observed since 2001 by the magnum telescope . the monitoring period analyzed in this letter covers a length of @xmath9 d from mjd @xmath10 to @xmath11 ( 2001 - 2006 ) , and photometric images were obtained for about 220 nights in the @xmath4 and @xmath12 bands .",
    "the observations , photometry , and data analysis are mostly in common with those in @xcite , and we do not repeat them except for some important basics below .",
    "each night we took images of the agn and the reference star alternatively using the multicolor imaging photometer ( mip ) with the viewing angle of @xmath13 , and performed relative photometry of the agn with an aperture size of @xmath14 .",
    "this size was chosen to minimize the photometric error and the flux variation in the aperture by the seeing effect .",
    "the flux in the aperture contains the flux from the host galaxy , especially from its bulge .",
    "the host component was estimated by the model fitting to its surface brightness as @xmath15 @xcite and @xmath16 @xcite , and we subtracted these contributions from the @xmath4 and @xmath12 light curves , respectively .",
    "the narrow line flux was also significant in the @xmath4 band for ngc4151 , so we subtracted @xmath17 mjy following @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the ir flux contains the flux from the accretion disk , which makes @xmath2 systematically shorter than the actual lag . according to @xcite ,",
    "the ir disk component should vary to synchronize with the optical variation that is originated genuinely from the accretion disk .",
    "this component in the @xmath12 band was then estimated as @xmath18 , and we also subtracted this contribution from the @xmath12 light curve by assuming @xmath19 for the disk emission between the @xmath4 and @xmath12 bands .",
    "the resulting @xmath4 and @xmath12 light curves of ngc 4151 from 2001 to 2006 are shown in figure [ fig : fig2 ] .",
    "the @xmath4 light curve shown here is consistent with the optical continuum light curves reported by @xcite .",
    "we see that the optical flux of ngc 4151 reached a minimum around mjd @xmath10 and then increased until reaching a maximum at mjd @xmath20 .",
    "thereafter , it turned to decrease again to a minimum at mjd @xmath21 .",
    "apparently , the flux variation in the @xmath12 band followed that in the @xmath4 band with clear time delay .",
    "the light curve shown in figure [ fig : fig2 ] is complex , with many peaks and valleys . from it",
    "we need to extract a table of @xmath2 as a function of continuum flux which has sufficient precision for us to test the hypothesis that @xmath2 is proportional to @xmath22 as the flux varies , and/or to understand any difference from that expected result .",
    "the techniques used previously are not adequate . in our series of papers on dust reverberation in agns @xcite",
    ", we estimated @xmath2 and its error based on the cross correlation function ( ccf ) analysis by making use of the structure function ( sf , * ? ? ? * ) for the interpolation of optical flux variability during the monitoring period . in the equal sampling ( es )",
    "scheme of interpolation which we used for the ccf analysis @xcite , the number of data points generated at equal intervals of time can exceed that actually observed . in such a case ,",
    "the simulated light curve shows larger flux variation compared to an overall trend seen from the observed light curve , especially when the data points are generated far from the location of observed epochs .",
    "this necessarily gives rise to too large an error of @xmath2 .",
    "we here adopt the bi - directional interpolation ( bi ) scheme , where all @xmath4-band flux data are paired with @xmath12-band flux data and at least either @xmath4 or @xmath12 flux in each pair is measured by actual observation .",
    "while the bi scheme overcomes a problem of generating too many data points for ccf calculations , the ccf still shows an unreal peak with increasing the number of data pairs .",
    "this drawback is remedied by estimating @xmath2 from the ccf centroid around the peak which is interpreted as a luminosity - weighted distance of the dust torus from the agn central energy source @xcite . as a practice of determining the ccf range for centroid estimation ,",
    "the threshold is usually set to be 0.8 times the ccf - peak value .",
    "if the threshold is larger than @xmath23 , @xmath2 is influenced by an unreal peak of the ccf .",
    "on the other hand , if it is smaller than @xmath24 , @xmath2 is necessarily influenced by sub - features such as a flared foot of the ccf .",
    "we so far used a simple mean of observed @xmath4-band fluxes as an indicator of optical luminosity that corresponds to @xmath2 , but this could seriously be biased by the two factors .",
    "first , the flux mean depends on the sampling frequency of light curve during the monitoring period .",
    "when an agn is often observed in the bright phase rather than in the faint phase , the simple flux mean preferentially gives a value of brighter flux .",
    "second , the flux mean depends on the shape of light curve .",
    "when an agn undergoes an abrupt burst on a flat light curve , the simple flux mean gives a value which is more or less the same as the value of flat part of the light curve , although the flat part contributes very little to the value of cross - correlation ( cc ) coefficient for the estimation of @xmath2 .",
    "considering above , we take a mean of @xmath4-band fluxes generated at equal intervals of time , after excluding the data which statistically show no flux variation in time bins . to pick up such data",
    ", we use the equally interpolated optical light curve for which the size of time bins is taken as the mean interval of monitoring observations . the variability in each bin",
    "is tested by @xmath25 with a significance level of @xmath26 , and the data which are judged as showing no flux variation are excluded in calculating the mean of @xmath4-band fluxes .",
    "the distribution of this flux mean for all simulated light curves is then used to derive an average optical flux @xmath27 and its error .",
    "we next use model light curves to verify that our analysis procedure reliably finds a characteristic lag @xmath2 and its associated flux @xmath28 for each of the individual variability events that combine to make the complex light curve shown in figure 1 . in order to quantify the above estimation of a characteristic lag @xmath2 and its associated flux @xmath27 as well as their errors , we model the light curves to calculate ccfs . given a @xmath4 light curve @xmath29",
    ", we construct a corresponding @xmath12 light curve as @xmath30 , where @xmath31 for @xmath32 which roughly reproduce the lags seen in figure [ fig : fig2 ] . here , the units are days in time and arbitrary in flux . then we generate 30 data points along each of the @xmath4 and @xmath12 light curves , and disperse the points according to a gaussian distribution of photometric errors taken from the actual observations by the magnum telescope .",
    "the models include three characteristic shapes of ( 1 ) linear bottom , ( 2 ) quadratic bottom , ( 3 ) bursting gaussian peak , as shown in order from top to bottom in the left column of figure [ fig : fig1 ] .",
    "the models 1 to 3 are shown in figure [ fig : fig1 ] to examine the dependence on shape of time - symmetric incident @xmath4 light curve used for ccf calculation .",
    "in addition to all these models with a standard index of @xmath33 , we consider two cases of @xmath34 and @xmath35 for each of light curve shapes 1 and 2 .",
    "we note , however , that @xmath36 is considered only for academic purpose and contradicts with the geometrical @xmath37-dilution of the incident flux from the central energy source .",
    "following @xcite , we applied the bi method to each of model light curves to calculate the ccf and also the cc centroid distribution ( histogram ) by monte - carlo simulations , as shown in the middle column of figure [ fig : fig1 ] for @xmath38 .",
    "the results of @xmath2 and its error are given on the panels of this column and in table [ tab : tab1 ] .",
    "the results of @xmath2 for the models 1 to 3 give values around @xmath39 d. this indicates that @xmath2 could be estimated independently of the shape of light curve .",
    "now we derive an average flux @xmath27 for each of the models 1 to 3 , following the way described in section [ sec : mod ] .",
    "the horizontal arrows in the left column of figure [ fig : fig1 ] specify the periods in which the data are rejected in the estimation of flux mean due to their invariability .",
    "we calculate the distribution of this flux mean for the light curves generated by monte - carlo simulations , and present it as a histogram from which @xmath27 and its error are derived , as shown in the right column of figure [ fig : fig1 ] for @xmath38 .",
    "the results of @xmath27 and its error are given on the panels of this column and in table [ tab : tab1 ] .    to be consistent with the measured value of @xmath2",
    ", we compare our estimate of @xmath27 with that from the relation @xmath31 adopted in the ccf analysis .",
    "the relative difference of @xmath40 is shown in table [ tab : tab1 ] .",
    "we see that @xmath41 for @xmath33 is less than @xmath42 for all the models 1 to 3 , which is considerably improved over our previous estimate of @xmath43 by using the simple flux mean .",
    "the result of @xmath27 for different values of @xmath34 and @xmath35 tabulated in table [ tab : tab1 ] shows little difference from that for @xmath33 , which indicates that estimated @xmath27 is almost independent of this parameter .",
    "in addition , various other light curves in asymmetric shapes also give an essentially same result .",
    "given that the consistent estimation of @xmath2 and @xmath27 has been confirmed as above by using the model light curves , we apply it to the real data for ngc 4151 .",
    "we divided the whole monitoring period into eight separate periods , each of which contains a single feature of flux variation , as above , with a sufficient number of more than 40 flux data pairs for the ccf analysis .",
    "the middle date of each period is taken as an epoch that represents each period . following the procedure described in section [ sec : mod ]",
    ", the monte - carlo simulation was repeated 500 times for each period to form the distribution of cc centroid lag from which @xmath2 was obtained as the median and its error as @xmath44 34.1 percentile from the median .",
    "similarly , we calculated the distribution of flux mean from which @xmath27 and its error were obtained .",
    "their results for eight separate periods are given in table [ tab : tab2 ] as well as in figure [ fig : fig3 ] .",
    "we here note that the @xmath12-band data of ngc 4151 were well sampled and the observed @xmath12 light curves were smooth enough .",
    "therefore , in order to avoid additional ir flux variation which consequently overestimates the errors in @xmath2 , use of the sf for the interpolation was turned off and the simple linear interpolation was adopted for the @xmath12-band data in making pairs with the @xmath4-band data .",
    "it is apparent that @xmath2 is not constant in time . for the most extreme case",
    ", the difference of @xmath2 between the earlier periods of 1 through 4 and the later periods of 6 through 8 is larger than the measurement error by many @xmath45s .",
    "since @xmath2 corresponds to a light - travel distance to the surrounding dust from the agn center , this should be the first convincing evidence that the inner radius of dust torus did change in an individual agn ( cf .",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the change of inner radius of dust torus should occur reflecting the variation of the incident uv / optical flux from the central energy source .",
    "some theoretical models suggest the existence of sublimation radius inside which dust grains are sublimated @xcite .",
    "the sublimation radius expands when the uv / optical continuum becomes bright , then it retreats when the continuum becomes faint .",
    "if dust grains were sublimated or replenished immediately after the uv / optical flux variation , like the model we assumed in section [ sec : mod ] , the expected changes of @xmath2 and @xmath27 should trace the simple relation of @xmath5 which has the slope indicated by the thick line in figure [ fig : fig3 ] .",
    "we see from this figure that the observed change of @xmath2 follows the variation of @xmath27 in overall trend as expected .",
    "these results indicate that the dust torus is not a distinct , separate physical structure but is a part of continuous structure starting from the blr component out to dust component with its inner dust edge set by the sublimation radius that changes with the uv / optical flux variation @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , however , the observed time - changing track does not exactly trace the simple relation of @xmath5 .",
    "the lag @xmath2 at the period 1 is well above that expected for @xmath46 , and does not change so much with brightening of about 1 mag from the period 1 to 3 .",
    "then , with subsequent fading from the period 3 to 6 , @xmath2 still remains constant until the period 4 , and starts to rapidly decrease thereafter .",
    "these deviant behaviors suggest that the inner dust torus did not reach an equilibrium state immediately after the uv / optical flux variation .    in the case of period 1 ,",
    "the light curves in figure [ fig : fig2 ] indicate that there was a brighter period before the period 1 .",
    "the expanded inner radius of dust torus at the brighter period could still remain larger than the radius that would be expected at the period 1 . in this context , the behavior of almost constant @xmath2 followed by its rapid decrease in the fading period places a constraint such that a time scale of dust replenishment in the central region of agn should be as long as the elapsed time of about one year from the period 4 through 6 .",
    "a promising mechanism of such replenishment is re - formation of dust grains rather than their infall from the outer region .",
    "this is understood by considering that the decrease of @xmath2 from the period 4 to 6 is 24.5 d or a light - travel distance of @xmath47 km in the interval of 309 d between the middle dates of these periods .",
    "if such decrease of @xmath2 would occur with redistribution of dust grains supplied from the outer region of dust torus , the infall velocity would be @xmath48 km  s@xmath49 or 7.9% of the light velocity .",
    "this seems highly unlikely , when we compare this infall velocity with a few @xmath50 km  s@xmath49 for the velocity dispersion of blr clouds which exist just near the inner dust torus .",
    "consequently , we conclude that re - formation of dust grains did occur in the central region where they had been sublimated .    after the dust re - formation period , @xmath2 turned almost constant again from the period 6 through 8 .",
    "this indicates that dust sublimation radius became larger than actual inner radius of dust torus and dust sublimation would start .",
    "the length of period of constant @xmath2 suggests that a time scale of dust destruction could be longer than about one year .",
    "exact measurement of this time scale might have been possible if the light curves were obtained well after the period 8 .",
    "the formulation for improving the accuracy of lag and luminosity measurements was applied to the light curves for eight separate periods containing single features .",
    "this formulation , when applied to the light curves for the whole monitoring period containing several features , gives an almost average of their respective @xmath2 estimates derived from single features , and is still useful in discussing an overall lag ",
