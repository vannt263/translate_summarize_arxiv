    "reachability for continuous and hybrid systems has been an important topic of research in the dynamics and control literature .",
    "numerous problems regarding safety of air traffic management systems @xcite , @xcite , flight control @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ground transportation systems @xcite , @xcite , etc . have been formulated in the framework of reachability theory . in most of these applications",
    "the main aim was to design suitable controllers to steer or keep the state of the system in a `` safe '' part of the state space .",
    "the synthesis of such safe controllers for hybrid systems relies on the ability to solve target problems for the case where state constraints are also present .",
    "the sets that represent the solution to those problems are known as capture basins @xcite .",
    "one direct way of computing these sets was proposed in @xcite , @xcite , and was formulated in the context of viability theory @xcite . following the same approach , the authors of @xcite , @xcite formulated viability , invariance and pursuit - evasion gaming problems for hybrid systems and used non - smooth analysis tools to characterize their solutions .",
    "computational tools to support this approach have been already developed by @xcite .",
    "an alternative , indirect way of characterizing such problems is through the level sets of the value function of an appropriate optimal control problem . by using dynamic programming , for reachability / invariant / viability problems without state constraints ,",
    "the value function can be characterized as the viscosity solution to a first order partial differential equation in the standard hamilton - jacobi form @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "numerical algorithms based on level set methods have been developed by @xcite , @xcite , have been coded in efficient computational tools by @xcite , @xcite and can be directly applied to reachability computations .    in the case where state constraints are also present , this target hitting problem is the solution to a reach - avoid problem in the sense of @xcite .",
    "the authors of @xcite , @xcite developed a reach - avoid computation , whose value function was characterized as a solution to a pair of coupled variational inequalities . in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite the authors proposed another characterization , which involved only one hamilton - jacobi type partial differential equation together with an inequality constraint .",
    "these methods are hampered from a numerical computation point of view by the fact that the hamiltonian of the system is in general discontinuous @xcite .    in @xcite , a scheme based on ellipsoidal techniques so as to compute reachable sets for control systems with constraints on the state",
    "was proposed .",
    "this approach was restricted to the class of linear systems . in @xcite ,",
    "this approach was extended to a list of interesting target problems with state constraints .",
    "the calculation of a solution to the equations proposed in @xcite , @xcite is in general not easy apart from the case of linear systems , where duality techniques of convex analysis can be used .    in this paper",
    "we propose a new framework of characterizing reach - avoid sets of nonlinear control systems as the solution to an optimal control problem .",
    "we consider the case where we have competing inputs and hence adopt the gaming formulation proposed in @xcite .",
    "we first restrict our attention to a specific reach - avoid scenario , where the objective of the control input is to make the states of the system hit the target at the end of our time horizon and without violating the state constraints , while the disturbance input tries to steer the trajectories of the system away from the target .",
    "we then generalize our approach to the case where the controller aims to steer the system towards the target not necessarily at the terminal , but at some time within the specified time horizon .",
    "both problems could be treated as pursuit - evasion games , and for a worst case setting we define a value function similar to @xcite and prove that it is the unique continuous viscosity solution to a quasi - variational inequality of a form similar to @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the advantage of this approach is that the properties of the value function and the hamiltonian ( both of them are continuous ) enable us using existing tools to compute the solution of the problem numerically .    to illustrate our approach",
    ", we consider a reach - avoid problem that arises in the area of air traffic management , in particular the problem of collision avoidance in the presence of 4d constraints , called target windows .",
    "target windows ( tw ) are spatial and temporal constraints and form the basis of the cats research project @xcite , whose aim is to increase punctuality and predictability during the flight . in @xcite",
    "a reachability approach of encoding tw constraints was proposed .",
    "we adopt this framework and consider a multi - agent setting , where each aircraft should respect its tw constraints while avoiding conflict with other aircraft in the presence of wind . since both control and disturbance inputs ( in our case the wind ) are present , this problem can be treated as a pursuit - evasion differential game with state constraints , which are determined dynamically by performing conflict detection .    in section",
    "ii we pose two reach - avoid problems for continuous systems with competing inputs and state constraints , and formulate them in the optimal control framework .",
    "section iii provides the characterization of the value functions of these problems as the viscosity solution to two variational inequalities . in section",
    "iv we present an application of this approach to a two aircraft collision avoidance scenario with realistic data .",

    ", conflict refers to the loss of minimum separation between two aircraft .",
    "each aircraft is surrounded by a protected zone , which is generally thought of as a cylinder of radius 5nmi and height 2000 ft centered at the aircraft .",

    "this is reasonable , since in the hybrid model we assumed constant heading angle at each segment .",
    "moreover , based on the speed - altitude profiles , aircraft fly faster at higher levels , so at those altitudes there are more states that can reach the target .",

    "as it was expected , the set of states that could reach the target while avoiding conflict with the other aircraft , does not include the conflict zone of fig .",
    "6a , but also some more states that would end up in this zone .",
    "this is a `` centralized '' solution , since for the safe sets shown in fig .",
    "6b , there exists a combination of inputs for the two aircraft that could satisfy all constraints , i.e. reaching their tw while avoiding conflict .",
    "it should be also noted that all simulations where performed on the same grid , but were running in parallel . hence he have two 2d computations ( one for each aircraft ) instead of a 4d one , and @xmath263 was determined at each step by comparing the obtained sets as described in algorithm 1 .",
    "a new framework of solving nonlinear systems with state constraints and competing inputs was presented .",
    "this formulation was based on reachability and game theory , has the advantage of maintaining the continuity in the hamiltonian of the system , and hence it has very good properties in terms of the numerical solution .",
    "the problem of reaching a desired set , in this case the tw , while avoiding conflict with other aircraft was formulated as a reach - avoid problem , and was computed numerically by using the existing tools .    in future work",

    "another issue would be to extend the proposed approach to formulate games in the case where the obstacle function is time and/or control dependant .",

    "<S> a new framework for formulating reachability problems with competing inputs , nonlinear dynamics and state constraints as optimal control problems is developed . </S>",
    "<S> such reach - avoid problems arise in , among others , the study of safety problems in hybrid systems . earlier approaches to reach - avoid computations </S>",
    "<S> are either restricted to linear systems , or face numerical difficulties due to possible discontinuities in the hamiltonian of the optimal control problem . </S>",
    "<S> the main advantage of the approach proposed in this paper is that it can be applied to a general class of target hitting continuous dynamic games with nonlinear dynamics , and has very good properties in terms of its numerical solution , since the value function and the hamiltonian of the system are both continuous . </S>",
    "<S> the performance of the proposed method is demonstrated by applying it to a two aircraft collision avoidance scenario under target window constraints and in the presence of wind disturbance . </S>",
    "<S> target windows are a novel concept in air traffic management , and represent spatial and temporal constraints , that the aircraft have to respect to meet their schedule . </S>"
