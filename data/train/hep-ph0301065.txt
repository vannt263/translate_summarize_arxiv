    "the phenomenon of color superconductivity @xcite is of general interest , in particular , in studies of the qcd phase structure @xcite and applications in the astrophysics of compact stars @xcite .",
    "observable consequences are expected for , e.  g. , the cooling behavior @xcite .",
    "different aspects have been investigated so far , whereby models of the njl type have been widely employed @xcite in studies of the phase structure in the vicinity of the hadronization transition .",
    "recently , it has been shown in these investigations that for low temperatures ( @xmath2 ) and not too large chemical potentials ( @xmath3 ) the two - flavor color superconductivity ( 2sc ) phase is favored over alternative color superconducting phases @xcite . according to @xcite , the color - flavor - locked ( cfl ) phase occurs only at @xmath4 mev .",
    "it is generally agreed that at low temperatures the transition of the matter from the phase with broken chiral symmetry to the color superconducting phase is of the first order ( see e. g. @xcite ) . from the point of view of phenomenological applications , as e.g. in compact star physics , the order of the phase transition to quark superconducting matter plays an important role .",
    "the conclusion about the first order phase transition was drawn within models without vector interaction channels taken into account ; the vector interaction has been considered in few papers @xcite .",
    "it was found that the presence of quark interaction in the vector channel moves the critical line in the in @xmath5 plain to larger @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "recently it has been demonstrated @xcite that the critical line of first order phase transition in the @xmath5 plane can have a second end - point at low temperatures , besides the well known one at high temperatures .",
    "the latter one could even be subject to experimental verification in heavy - ion collisions @xcite whereas the former could be of relevance for neutron stars .",
    "while in ref .",
    "@xcite this feature of the phase diagram was a consequence of the presence of interaction in the vector channel , we would like to investigate in the present work the sensitivity of the phase diagram to the choice of model parameters without interaction in the vector channel .",
    "we will demonstrate that in the absence of the vector channel interaction the phase transition is not necessarily of the first order , thus revising statements in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that some progress has recently been done in lattice calculations .",
    "there are methods being developed that allow to extend lattice results to the case of finite chemical potentials @xcite",
    ". however , these methods are valid only for small chemical potentials ( see e.  g.  @xcite ) , below the conditions at which the color superconductivity phase is expected to form .",
    "the structure of our paper is as follows . in sect .  2 ,",
    "a chiral quark model is introduced , its lagrangian is given and the model parameters are fixed from the vacuum state in two different schemes .",
    "temperature and chemical potential are introduced into the quark model in sect .",
    "3 , using the matsubara formalism .",
    "the conclusions and a discussion of the obtained results are given in sect .",
    "in order to study the quark matter phase diagram including color superconductivity , one should generalize the concept of the single order parameter related to the quark - antiquark condensate in the case of chiral symmetry breaking to a set of order parameters when condensation can occur in other interaction channels too .",
    "the simplest extension is the scalar diquark condensate @xmath6 for @xmath7 and @xmath8 quarks @xmath9 which is an order parameter characterizing the domain where the color symmetry is spontaneously broken and the quark matter finds itself in the ( two - flavor ) color superconducting ( 2sc ) state .",
    "this quantity is the most important one among other possible condensates that can be constructed in accordance with the pauli principle @xcite . in ( [ delta ] )",
    "the matrix @xmath10 is the charge conjugation matrix operator for fermions @xmath11 the matrices @xmath12 and @xmath13 are pauli and gell - mann matrices , respectively . the first one acts on the flavor indices of spinors while the second one acts in the color space .    if the electroweak interaction is discarded and only the strong coupling is in focus , the resulting quark matter phase diagram is essentially determined by nonperturbative features of the qcd vacuum state .",
    "one therefore has to resort to nonperturbative approaches to describe the behavior of particles at various conditions , ranging from cold and dilute matter up to the hot and dense one .",
    "a reliable and widely tested model to nonperturbative strong coupling qcd is provided by the dyson - schwinger equations @xcite , however , for qualitative studies like the one we attempt here it proves to be too complex .",
    "therefore , we will use here a simple and tractable nonperturbative model of quark interaction , the nambu  jona - lasinio ( njl ) model @xcite , which has been extensively exploited for the description of the properties of the light meson sector of qcd ( also to describe the color superconductivity phase @xcite ) and proved to be a model respecting the low - energy theorems . before we proceed to the case of finite temperature and density , the model parameters that determine",
    "the quark interaction should be fixed .",
    "this shall be done for the vacuum state where hadronic properties are known .",
    "we will assume , according to common wisdom that , once fixed , these parameters ( originating from the nonperturbative gluon sector of qcd ) will not change , even in the vicinity of the transition to the quark matter .",
    "this transition is thus caused by medium effects in the quark sector only .      in the present paper",
    "we restrict ourselves to the two - flavor case , leaving the strange quark and effects related to it beyond our consideration .",
    "as we constrain ourselves to only two order parameters , the quark and scalar diquark condensates , during our investigation , the interaction of quarks will be represented in the lagrangian by @xmath14 symmetric scalar , pseudoscalar quark - antiquark , and scalar diquark vertices : @xmath15,\\\\ { { \\mathcal l } } _ { qq}&=&\\frac{h}{2}(\\bar\\psi i\\gamma_5\\tau_2\\lambda_2c\\bar\\psi^t)(\\psi^{t } c i\\gamma_5\\tau_2\\lambda_2\\psi),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the diagonal current quark mass matrix @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are constants describing the interaction of quarks in the scalar , pseudoscalar , and scalar diquark channels , respectively .",
    "we work in the isospin symmetric case @xmath20 , thus @xmath21 .    by the standard hubbard - stratonovich procedure ,",
    "we introduce auxiliary scalar ( @xmath22 ) , pseudoscalar triplet ( @xmath23 ) , and diquark ( @xmath24 ) fields together with yukawa - like terms in the lagrangian density instead of the four - quark vertices : @xmath25 in order to integrate out the quark degrees of freedom by gaussian path integration , it is appropriate to represent the quark fields by the bispinor @xmath26 and to introduce the matrix propagator @xmath27 : @xmath28 integrating over @xmath29 and @xmath30 , we then obtain an effective lagrangian in terms of collective scalar and pseudoscalar quark - antiquark and scalar diquark excitations . here , we restrict ourselves to the mean - field approximation , leaving the next - to - leading order corrections in the @xmath31 expansion beyond our model .",
    "finally , the effective lagrangian density reads @xmath32 the trace in ( [ invpropagator ] ) is taken in the dirac , color , and flavor space .",
    "the matrix @xmath33 contains @xmath22 and @xmath23 fields : @xmath34 the sum over @xmath35 is assumed , and @xmath36 .",
    "as it was mentioned above , we are working in the mean - field approximation and the quark condensates are of interest .",
    "therefore , further study can be performed in terms of the effective potential @xmath37 where @xmath38 is 4-dimensional volume .",
    "the vacuum expectation values of the collective variables @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 determine the absolute minimum of @xmath41 .",
    "they are given by the equation @xmath42 _ a priori _ it is known that in the vacuum only the @xmath22 field acquires a nonvanishing expectation value .",
    "the diquark fields @xmath39 , @xmath40 are expected to have nonzero mean values only in dense matter .",
    "the mean value of the pseudoscalar isotriplet field @xmath23 is always equal to zero , therefore we omit it hereafter .",
    "having solved eq .",
    "( [ vmin ] ) for the field @xmath22 , one can work in terms of the constituent quark mass @xmath43 , connected with the current quark mass by the gap equation @xmath44 in the chiral limit ( @xmath45 ) , the constituent quark mass is proportional to the quark condensate and thus can be treated as the order parameter .    in the njl model",
    "the quark condensate is @xmath46 where @xmath47 the divergence in @xmath48 is eliminated by means of a sharp 3d cut - off at the scale @xmath49 .",
    "in our model we have four parameters : the four - quark interaction constants @xmath18 and @xmath19 , cut - off @xmath49 , and the current quark mass @xmath50 . without diquarks , there are only three : @xmath18 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 .",
    "they are fixed by the following relations :    1 .   the goldberger - treiman relation ( gtr )",
    ": @xmath51 where @xmath52 mev is the pion weak coupling constant and @xmath53 describes the coupling of a pion with quarks @xmath54 @xmath55 2 .",
    "the quark condensate ( qc ) from qcd sum rules @xmath56 3 .",
    "the decay constant @xmath57 for the @xmath58 ( r2pd ) process @xmath59 the @xmath60 transitions are omitted here .",
    "the current quark mass @xmath50 is fixed from the gmor relation : @xmath61 in the chiral limit @xmath62 , @xmath45 .",
    "5 .   with the diquark channel",
    "included , there is an additional parameter @xmath19 which can be fixed as @xmath63 from the fierz transformation ( as e.  g. in@xcite ) .. it turned out that within our model the resulting phase diagram is not much affected if one makes the choice in favor of @xmath64 .",
    "however , it would be preferable to fix the constant @xmath19 from some observable , e.  g. from the nucleon mass . ]    in the item 2 , we have given two alternatives : one can either use the value of the quark condensate taken from qcd sum rule estimates or demand from the model that it should describe the @xmath58 decay .",
    "the latter is well observable in experiment contrary to the quark condensate .    for simplicity , we perform all calculations in the chiral limit @xmath45 . in this case , when investigating the hot and dense quark matter , the borders between phases turn out to be sharp and the critical temperature and chemical potential are well defined . with the finite current quark mass ,",
    "the transitions from one phase to the other become smooth .    as a result ,",
    "one obtains two different parameter sets shown in table  [ paramset ] .    in the type",
    "i parameter set the interaction of quarks is stronger , the uv cut - off is smaller , and the constituent quark mass is greater .",
    "one can calculate the dimensionless constant @xmath65 .",
    "it equals 4.6 for the type  i and 3.72 for the type ii , respectively . as we will see further , these two parametrizations result in qualitatively different phase diagrams",
    "we extend the njl model to the case of finite temperatures @xmath2 and chemical potentials @xmath3 , applying the matsubara formalism , and restrict ourselves to the isospin symmetric case where up and down quark chemical potentials coincide .",
    "the thermodynamical potential per volume is @xmath66 where @xmath67 are matsubara frequencies for fermions , and the chemical potential is included into the definition of inverse quark propagator @xmath68 the expression in ( [ thpot ] ) can be simplified using the equations @xmath69\\nonumber\\\\ & + & 2\\left[\\ln\\left(\\frac{(\\omega_n^2+{\\epsilon^+}^2)(\\omega_n^2 + { \\epsilon^-}^2)}{t^4}\\right)\\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath70.\\ ] ]    @xmath71\\right.\\right.\\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\left.2 t \\ln\\left[1+\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\epsilon^-}{t}\\right)\\right]\\right)\\nonumber\\\\ & + & 4\\left(\\left(e^++e^-\\right)\\theta(\\lambda^2-\\vec{p}^2)+2 t \\ln\\left[1+\\exp\\left(-\\frac{e^+}{t}\\right)\\right]\\right.\\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\left.\\left.2 t      \\ln\\left[1+\\exp\\left(-\\frac{e^-}{t}\\right)\\right]\\right)\\right\\ }   + \\frac{m^2}{2g}+\\frac{|\\delta|^2}{2 h}~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath72 @xmath73 the cold matter limit @xmath74 looks as follows : @xmath75 \\nonumber\\\\ & \\times&\\theta(\\lambda^2-\\vec{p}^2)+\\frac{m^2}{2g}+\\frac{|\\delta|^2}{2 h}~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the thermodynamical potential can not be calculated in closed form for arbitrary @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "however , in the cold matter limit one can easily obtain analytic expressions for the thermodynamical potential or its derivatives if only one of the collective variables @xmath22 or @xmath76 has a nonvanishing average value .",
    "this allows to find what kind of phase transition is to be expected for different parameter choices .",
    "we evaluate the remaining 3d momentum integrals numerically and calculate the value of thermodynamical potential at different @xmath2 and @xmath3 for the two types of model parameter sets .",
    "the equilibrium state for each @xmath2 and @xmath3 is determined by @xmath77 and @xmath78 corresponding to the minimum of @xmath79 .",
    "it is quite illustrative to look at the contour plots of the thermodynamical potential . for several values of @xmath3 at @xmath74",
    "they are shown in figs .",
    "[ thdp_i_1][thdp_i_4 ] where one can follow the appearance and disappearance of local minima , maxima , and saddle points of the thermodynamical potential with increasing chemical potential . for zero temperature and chemical potential",
    "we have , as expected , a nonzero constituent quark mass ( quark condensate ) corresponding to the absolute minimum of the thermodynamical potential at @xmath80 mev and @xmath81 in fig .",
    "[ thdp_i_1 ] . at a certain chemical potential , a new local minimum related to the diquark condensate near @xmath82110 mev and @xmath83 ( fig .",
    "[ thdp_i_2 ] ) , but it does not yet give the absolute minimum .",
    "there is also a local maximum around @xmath84 mev and @xmath81 .",
    "as the matter becomes more dense , the second minimum lowers until it becomes degenerate with the first minimum while the average value of @xmath22 ( or @xmath85 ) remains almost unchanged ( see fig .",
    "[ thdp_i_3 ] ) . above the",
    "corresponding ( critical ) chemical potential @xmath86 mev , the second minimum becomes the absolute one and a first order transition occurs , during which @xmath87 discontinuously changes to zero while the diquark condensate acquires nonzero value breaking the color symmetry of the strong interaction .",
    "this characterizes the color superconducting phase transition in quark matter .",
    "furthermore , the local minimum on the @xmath43 axis merges the saddle point ( see fig .",
    "[ thdp_i_4 ] ) and , at still higher @xmath3 , only the local minimum on the @xmath39 axis near @xmath88 130 mev and @xmath83 remains .    at a fixed chemical potential above @xmath89 , with the temperature rising ,",
    "the average value of @xmath76 decreases until it reaches zero at the critical temperature @xmath90 which can be roughly estimated using the bcs theory formula @xmath91 above this temperature quark matter is in the symmetric phase where the chiral and color symmetries are restored .",
    "finally , we obtain the phase diagram shown on fig .",
    "[ phdi ] with three phases : the hadron phase , 2sc phase , and symmetric phase .",
    "all three phases coexist at the triple point : @xmath92 mev and @xmath93 mev .      as for the type",
    "i parameter set , at zero @xmath2 and @xmath3 only the constituent quark mass @xmath43 , being the order parameter for the chiral condensate , is nonzero , whereas the diquark gap @xmath39 vanishes .",
    "however , the vacuum value of @xmath43 is lower than that for the type i and , with the chemical potential increasing , @xmath3 becomes equal to the vacuum value of @xmath43 before the second local minimum , corresponding to the diquark condensate , appears . at further increase of @xmath3 the constituent quark mass decreases , and it would vanish at @xmath94 , @xmath95 if the diquark condensate did not appear .",
    "actually , at the critical value @xmath96 both the quark condensate and the diquark condensate are small but nonzero .",
    "the changes of the local extrema for increasing chemical potential are similar to those shown in figs .",
    "[ thdp_i_1][thdp_i_4 ] .",
    "the cases of dilute ( @xmath97 ) and very dense matter ( @xmath98 mev ) are qualitatively analogous , only the absolute values of @xmath43 and @xmath76 at which the local minima are found are different . at intermediate densities , however , there is a qualitative difference . within a very narrow range of values of the chemical potential",
    ", there exists a new phase of massive superconducting matter .",
    "one can see this in fig .",
    "[ thdp_ii ] for @xmath99 mev . at higher @xmath3 the chiral symmetry",
    "is restored and the quark matter is in the pure superconducting phase .",
    "a possibility of the chiral diquark condensates to coexist at certain condition has been already noticed in ref .",
    "@xcite    thus , for the type ii parameter set , the transition from the hadronic to the superconducting phase is of the second order . in this case",
    "there are no degenerate local minima in the thermodynamical potential separated by a barrier .",
    "this behavior is unlike to what is commonly expected for a cold and dense matter but it parallels the findings of ref .",
    "@xcite where vector interactions are responsible for this behavior .",
    "the average value of @xmath76 is much smaller than for the type  i parameter set . as a consequence ,",
    "the border between 2sc and the symmetric phases of quark matter lies at noticeably lower temperatures .",
    "the phase diagram obtained in our model for the type  ii parameter set is shown in fig .",
    "[ phdii ] .",
    "in the framework of the simple njl model for two flavors , a phase diagram is obtained for @xmath74200 mev and @xmath97450 mev .",
    "three phases are found for the type i parameter set and four phases for the type ii parameter set .",
    "the critical temperature and chemical potential obtained in the type i scheme differ from those obtained with the type ii parameter set . at @xmath74 , @xmath100 mev for the type i parameter set and @xmath101 mev for the type ii .",
    "the corresponding quark densities differ by a factor 1.5  1.7 .",
    "the critical temperature for the type ii parameter set is as low as @xmath102 mev and thus much closer to critical temperatures for the paring instability in nuclear matter systems ( see @xcite ) whereas for the type i parameter set the critical temperatures are an order of magnitude larger .",
    "this striking difference in the critical parameters obtained within the same model calls for a more detailed investigation of the question of model parametrization .    in our work",
    ", the constant @xmath19 was not obtained from a fit to observable data . instead",
    ", fierz transformation arguments have been used to fix the ratio @xmath103 .",
    "a parameterization would be favourable where ( in the spirit of the type ii model ) experimentally measured quantities , like the @xmath104 meson width , are used rather than non - observable ones ( quark condensate etc . ) .",
    "it would therefore be more consistent to fit the constant @xmath19 from baryon properties , see @xcite and also to go beyond the mean field level of description .",
    "these investigations shall be performed in future work where it remains to be clarified which critical parameters for the color superconducting phase transition can be considered more realistic and of which order the phase transition is .",
