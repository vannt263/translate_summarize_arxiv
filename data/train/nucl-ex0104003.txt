    "although the shape of the excitation function is fairly well determined , there is a large spread in the absolute normalizations of these measurements .",
    "the cross section must be known at the very low relative energies ( @xmath14 20 kev ) relevant to @xmath2b production in the sun , but these low energies are experimentally inaccessible because the high coulomb barrier causes the cross section to plummet with decreasing energy .",
    "the strategy adopted is to measure the cross section at the lowest possible energy , and then extrapolate downward using theory . in order to extrapolate to low energies reliably ,",
    "the dominant energy dependences in the cross section can be factored out , leaving a quantity known as the astrophysical @xmath5 factor , which varies much more slowly with energy .",

    "the @xmath2b nucleus is radioactive with a half life of 770 ms and is not a viable photodissociation target .",
    "however , when an energetic beam of @xmath2b nuclei passes through a heavy target , the time - dependent electromagnetic field of the high z target nuclei acts as a source of virtual photons capable of dissociating the incident @xmath2b projectiles into @xmath0be + @xmath19 @xcite .",

    "the semiclassical formalism of coulomb excitation has been extended to coulomb dissociation at intermediate and high energies @xcite .",
    "the advantages of high energy coulomb dissociation over direct radiative capture measurements include thicker targets and larger cross sections , and thereby the possibility of reaching lower relative energies with an appreciable yield .",
    "coulomb dissociation has been used to infer @xmath9 @xcite , but the method is not without complications .",
    "first , several electromagnetic multipoles contribute in coulomb dissociation , e.g. , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 , while the radiative capture reaction is mainly driven by a single electromagnetic multipole transition at solar energies , @xmath20 .",
    "second , even though the electromagnetic interaction dominates , the effects of nuclear absorption and diffraction must be considered .",
    "finally , one must consider the effects of higher - order electromagnetic transitions that can destroy the simple correspondence between radiative capture and coulomb dissociation . an important experimental challenge is to identify and understand these complications in order to firmly establish coulomb dissociation as a viable alternative to direct radiative capture measurements . in this paper",
    ", we will show that these complications can be dealt with in a satisfactory manner by a judicious choice of the experimental conditions and by applying tested nuclear structure and reaction theories .    the first challenge , that of disentangling the contributions of different electromagnetic multipoles to extract one in particular , can be met by carefully studying the angular distribution of the breakup fragments . in the coulomb dissociation of intermediate energy @xmath2b , @xmath21 is the principal unwanted electromagnetic multipole . by carrying out an inclusive measurement of the @xmath0be fragments emitted in the coulomb dissociation of 44 and 81 mev / nucleon @xmath2b , we determined the @xmath21 contribution to the breakup cross section .",
    "having measured the @xmath21 strength in the coulomb breakup , we were in a position to study the breakup energy spectrum , @xmath23 , in order to determine the @xmath20 strength at low relative energies and thereby infer @xmath9 .",
    "this was done in an exclusive measurement of the elastic breakup of an 83 mev / nucleon @xmath2b beam . in the analysis of this experiment",
    ", we used the @xmath21 strength determined in the inclusive measurement , and investigated the influence of nuclear and higher - order electromagnetic processes .",
    "we discovered that these complications could be minimized , and the theoretical uncertainties made small enough that our coulomb breakup measurement is of comparable precision to the direct radiative capture measurements . in this paper",

    "a 300 @xmath32 m si @xmath33 diode detector mounted on a ladder 18 cm upstream of the targets was intermittently raised into the path of the beam .",
    "energy loss signals from this detector , in conjunction with timing signals from the plastic scintillator at the exit of the a1200 , yielded both the transmission and composition of the secondary beams .",
    "times - of - flight were measured for the @xmath14 70 m flight path between the scintillator at the exit of the a1200 and the s800 focal plane .",

    "two other nuclei , @xmath34li and @xmath35c , were also present in the beam .",
    "as the velocities of these contaminants differed substantially from that of the @xmath2b ions , their different times - of - flight provided reliable particle identification .",
    "we used the s800 spectrometer @xcite to detect the @xmath0be fragments emitted in the coulomb dissociation of @xmath2b nuclei on the ag and pb targets .",
    "the spectrometer was set at 0@xmath36 , and was operated in a dispersion - matched energy loss mode so that the 0.5% spread in the momentum of the @xmath2b beams did not limit the final momentum resolution , which was dominated by differential energy loss in the target . the large angular acceptance ( 20 msr ) and momentum acceptance ( 6% ) of the s800 allowed us to capture essentially the entire momentum distribution at a single magnetic field setting .",
    "the standard complement of detectors at the focal plane of the s800 spectrometer comprises two position - sensitive cathode readout drift chambers ( crdcs ) , a 41 cm deep , 16 segment ionization chamber , and three plastic scintillators .",
    "the crdcs are separated by 1 meter to give good angular resolution .",
    "@xcite describes these detectors in detail .",
    "the ionization chamber recorded the energy losses , and the first , 5 cm thick scintillator measured the total energies of particles reaching the focal plane .",
    "this information was sufficient to identify the @xmath37be breakup fragments unambiguously , as illustrated in fig.[s800pid ] ; the time - of - flight data provided a check .",
    "as the nuclei of interest were stopped in the first scintillator , the other two were not used .",
    "the particle identification was confirmed through comparisons with calibration beams of @xmath0be that had the same magnetic rigidity as the @xmath2b beams",
    ". the higher magnetic rigidity of the detected @xmath0be fragments compared to the @xmath2b beams made the focal plane particle identification particularly clean .",
    "the positions and angles of the @xmath0be fragments were measured in the crdcs .",
    "the position resolution obtained was approximately 0.3 mm ( 1@xmath38 ) , yielding an intrinsic angular resolution of about 2 mrad .",
    "we employed the ion optics code cosy infinity @xcite to reconstruct the trajectories of the @xmath0be fragments from their measured positions in the crdcs , and the magnetic fields of the spectrometer , which were continuously monitored by nuclear magnetic resonance probes throughout the experiment .",
    "we calculated the @xmath0be lab momenta and scattering angles on an event - by - event basis , allowing reconstruction of the longitudinal momentum distributions .",
    "corrections to the momentum distributions were made for two different effects .",
    "first , the overall efficiency of the crdcs was less than unity due to a high threshold on the anode wire constant fraction discriminator .",
    "this was a small correction in the case of the low energy beam ( @xmath39 3% ) , but larger for the high energy beam ( @xmath39 15% ) .",
    "the second was a momentum - dependent correction for the angular acceptance of the s800 , which was important for events having large deviations from the central momentum and large projections of the scattering angle in the dispersive direction of the spectrometer .",
    "these corrections affected only the tails of the measured momentum distributions , and amounted to less than 5% of the measured cross sections , even for the largest scattering angles .",
    "corrections were made on the basis of the data themselves by observations of the acceptance limits .",
    "uncertainties equal to half the size of the corrections were assigned to the data points in the momentum distributions that required correction . during some runs , the magnetic field of the spectrometer was varied to move the center of the distribution away from the center of the focal plane detectors in order to measure the tails of the momentum distributions precisely .",
    "the final momentum distributions represent the sums of measurements made at several different magnetic field settings .",
    "the 83 mev / nucleon @xmath2b beam used in the exclusive measurement was produced with a 125 mev / nucleon primary @xmath25c beam in the same manner described above .",
    "typical @xmath4b beam intensities were 10@xmath40 s@xmath31 , and the momentum spread in the beam was limited to @xmath28 0.25% by slits in the a1200 fragment separator .",
    "a total of @xmath41 @xmath4b nuclei were incident on the target .",
    "a thin plastic scintillator was placed at the exit of the a1200 fragment separator for beam intensity , transmission , and time - of - flight measurements .",
    "the @xmath2b nuclei were dissociated in a 47 mg @xmath24 pb target located in front of a room temperature 1.5 t dipole magnet .",
    "four position - sensitive multiwire drift chambers ( mwdcs ) @xcite recorded the positions of the @xmath0be and @xmath19 fragments produced in the breakup after they passed through the magnetic field .",
    "two mwdcs measured each breakup fragment , allowing the determination of both position and angle . a 16 element array of 4 cm thick plastic scintillator bars was placed behind the mwdcs . a 25 mm @xmath29 60 mm stainless steel plate located directly in front of the first @xmath0be mwdc absorbed nearly all of the direct beam .",
    "the composition of the secondary beam in the exclusive measurement was roughly 20% @xmath42li , 55% @xmath37be , 20% @xmath4b , and 5% @xmath43c .",
    "[ pos ] shows a schematic drawing of the experimental setup .",
    "the multiwire drift chambers used in this experiment have active areas of 112 mm @xmath29 112 mm , and use delay - line readout to measure the positions of particle tracks .",
    "the chambers were filled with p30 ( 70% argon , 30% methane ) at a pressure of 700 torr .",
    "each mwdc has two orthogonal wire planes , providing both x and y positions .",
    "drift time information is used to interpolate between anode wires using current pulses induced on the cathode field - shaping wires .",
    "the principles of operation of these detectors are described in ref .",
    "position resolutions of 0.4 mm ( 1@xmath38 ) were obtained for protons and @xmath0be fragments .",
    "particle identification was achieved through measurements of energy loss in the plastic scintillator array and time - of - flight between the exit of the a1200 and the scintillator array .",
    "the geometric average of signals from photomultiplier tubes on the top and bottom of each scintillator bar served as a measure of particle energy loss . since the scintillator array was not sufficiently thick to stop the breakup fragments , direct total energy measurements were not possible , and the time - of - flight measurement was crucial for ion identification .",
    "calibration beams of @xmath0be and @xmath19 having the same magnetic rigidity as the @xmath2b beam were used to confirm the particle identification . the protons and @xmath37be struck",

    "we reconstructed the 4-momenta of the breakup fragments from the measured positions in all 8 mwdc planes and the magnetic field using the ion optics code cosy infinity @xcite .",
    "the magnetic field was measured with a hall probe at 2184 points in each of 4 planes in the gap of the dipole magnet to a precision of @xmath28 2 mg @xcite .",
    "second - order taylor series expansions about a reference trajectory were employed , and the trajectory reconstruction was checked through the use of proton and @xmath37be calibration beams .",
    "the invariant mass method was used to calculate the relative energy of the fragments according to @xmath44 , where @xmath3 is the total relativistic energy , and @xmath45 the total momentum in the laboratory frame .",
    "the energy and momentum are defined by @xmath46 , and @xmath47 .",
    "the relative energy is simply the kinetic energy in the center - of - mass reference frame .",
    "we obtained a relative energy resolution of 55 kev ( 1@xmath38 ) at @xmath8 = 100 kev ; the energy resolution increased for higher relative energies approximately as @xmath48 .",
    "the small separation between the 1st and 2nd mwdcs , combined with the mwdc position resolution , caused the angular resolution to limit the relative energy resolution .",
    "this small distance was necessitated by the requirement that the first detector be far enough away from the magnet that there be adequate separation between the @xmath0be fragments and the @xmath2b beam , and by the limitations of an existing vacuum chamber .",
    "other contributions to the relative energy resolution included energy loss and multiple scattering in the 47 mg @xmath24 target and the mwdcs , each of which was 30 mg @xmath24 thick .",
    "the resolution and efficiency of the experimental apparatus were determined through a monte carlo simulation .",
    "the inputs to the simulation included the beam emittance ( 6 mm beam spot diameter , @xmath28 6 mrad in the dispersive direction of the magnet , @xmath28 9 mrad in the non - dispersive direction ) and the measured detector position resolution . the beam emittance was measured by reducing the magnetic field , causing the @xmath4b beam to miss the beam blocker and be detected in the mwdcs , while the detector position resolution was determined through the use of a mask .",
    "the monte carlo simulation was also used to calculate the small fraction of the @xmath37be breakup fragments that were intercepted by the beam blocker .    in order to evaluate the geometric efficiency of the setup , we employed a model for the breakup of @xmath4b that includes both @xmath31 and @xmath32 transition amplitudes , which have different distributions in @xmath49 , the laboratory scattering angle of the excited @xmath4b . to account for the @xmath31-@xmath32 interference observed in the asymmetry of the longitudinal momentum distribution of @xmath37be fragments",
    ", we included an anisotropic angular distribution of the breakup fragments in the excited @xmath4b rest frame .",
    "the shape of this distribution is similar to those shown in fig .",

    "@xcite , but was empirically adjusted to reproduce the longitudinal momentum distribution of protons measured in this experiment , which will be discussed in section  [ results ] .",
    "the @xmath31 and @xmath32 dissociation probabilities were taken from the model of ref.@xcite , after scaling the @xmath32 matrix elements by the factor 0.7 .",
    "this quenching of the @xmath21 amplitudes , required for the best fit of the inclusive data , is discussed in more detail below .",
    "we gauged the model - dependence of the efficiency determination by also computing the efficiency using the same model without @xmath32 transitions .",
    "the difference between the computed efficiencies with and without @xmath32 transitions was less than 5% for the angular and relative energy ranges covered in the experiment .",
    "this difference was used as the theoretical uncertainty in the efficiency determination .",
    "since both @xmath32 transitions and nuclear absorption and diffraction effects are relatively more important at small impact parameters than at large ones , we imposed a impact parameter cutoff at 30 fm . for 83 mev / nucleon @xmath4b on pb ,",
    "this corresponds classically to @xmath49 = 1.77@xmath50 . in practice ,",
    "@xmath49 was determined from the reconstructed total laboratory momentum vector , and the 1@xmath38 resolution of this quantity was 4.5 mrad . the geometric efficiency for detecting @xmath4b breakups with b @xmath51 30 fm is shown in fig .  [ eff ] .",
    "the efficiency falls off rapidly with increasing relative energy , primarily due to the small solid angle subtended by the proton mwdcs . as the goal of the experiment was to determine the coulomb dissociation cross section at low relative energies , the experimental arrangement was most sensitive to the events of interest .",
    "the intrinsic detection efficiency , i.e. , the probability that all 8 mwdc planes provided good position signals when the breakup fragments passed through them , was measured to be 0.414 @xmath28 0.008 using the scintillator array .",

    "an early measurement of the momentum distribution of @xmath37be fragments from the coulomb breakup of 41 mev / nucleon @xmath4b on gold @xcite provided evidence of this effect , but the statistics were insufficient to draw any definitive conclusions . by measuring longitudinal momentum distributions of @xmath37be nuclei and protons on two targets at two different beam energies with two different experimental setups ,",

    ", we fit the central 6 data points of the 3.5@xmath50 @xmath37be longitudinal momentum distribution from the breakup of 44 mev / nucleon @xmath4b on the pb target in order to minimize the @xmath64 value . using this procedure",
    ", we found that the optimal ratio of @xmath21 and @xmath20 matrix element scaling factors was 0.7 .",

    "@xcite ) . in the exclusive experiment , it was not possible to measure the longitudinal momentum distributions with a precision comparable to that of the inclusive measurement .",
    "furthermore , any nuclear - induced breakup contribution is relatively more important for the ag target than for the pb target .",
    "for these reasons , we used only the inclusive measurements on pb to deduce the @xmath21 strength .",
    "the preliminary findings of the inclusive measurement were described previously @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the optimal ratio of the @xmath21 and @xmath20 matrix element scaling factors was incorrectly reported as the ratio of the scaling factors for the @xmath21 and @xmath20 strength distributions ; the correct value for this ratio is 0.7@xmath65 = 0.49 . as a consequence ,",
    "the reported @xcite ratio of @xmath21 and @xmath20 s factors at @xmath8 = 0.6 mev should be replaced by 4.7 @xmath7 .",
    "this result assumes the validity of 1st - order perturbation theory in describing the reaction mechanism , and a particular @xmath4b structure model .",
    "if higher - order electromagnetic effects are important , a larger intrinsic @xmath21 strength is required to fit the data .",
    "hence we have determined the effective @xmath21 matrix element which , within a 1st - order perturbation theory with a given @xmath20 matrix element , fits the empirically observed asymmetry in the longitudinal momentum distributions .",
    "table  [ table2 ] lists the integrated cross sections obtained in the inclusive longitudinal momentum distribution measurements on both targets .",
    "the purpose of these inclusive measurements was to deduce the @xmath21 strength in the coulomb breakup .",
    "a determination of low - lying @xmath20 strength would be subject to large nuclear structure uncertainties , since the inclusive measurements are sensitive to electromagnetic strength over a large range of excitation energies .",
    "however , the observed asymmetry in the longitudinal momentum distributions is a clear signature of @xmath20-@xmath21 interference , through which these measurements probe the total @xmath21 strength .",
    "in contrast to the @xmath21 component , the size of the @xmath22 contribution to the cross section for coulomb breakup can be determined from the measurement of the radiative capture cross section at the 0.64 mev 1@xmath66 resonance @xcite .",
    "@xmath22 transitions only play a role in coulomb dissociation near this energy , and the magnitude of the contribution is obtained from the measured resonance parameters @xcite and the calculated virtual photon spectrum @xcite .",
    "the energy resolution of our exclusive measurement is too large and the contribution too small to allow us to clearly see this resonance , but it represents a few percent of the measured cross section .",
    "since the radiative capture reaction involves protons and @xmath37be nuclei in their ground states , coulomb breakup that yields excited @xmath37be nuclei is not relevant to the inverse radiative capture rate . as our experimental setup did not include any provision for detecting @xmath1 rays , a correction for the yield to the 1/2@xmath53 excited state of @xmath37be",

    ", we have ensured that nuclear diffraction and absorption effects are small , and that the point - like projectile approximation employed in 1st - order perturbation theory is valid .",
    "furthermore , by also excluding relative energies below 130 kev from our analysis , we minimized the role of @xmath21 transitions and considered only relative energies where @xmath20 was the dominant ( @xmath67 90% ) contribution to the breakup . as illustrated in fig.[e1frac ] , @xmath20 transitions dominate the breakup cross section from 130 kev to 2 mev except for a narrow range surrounding the 0.64 mev @xmath68 resonance .",
    "@xmath21 transitions contribute significantly at relative energies under 130 kev , accounting for the sharp fall in the @xmath20 fraction of the cross section at low relative energies .",
    "to deduce the @xmath20 strength at low relative energies , we carried out the following procedure .",
    "after fixing the @xmath21/@xmath20 ratio using the inclusive data , we convoluted the calculated @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 cross sections with the energy - dependent experimental resolution , and then scaled the combined @xmath69 cross section in order to minimize @xmath64 for the measured differential cross section between 130 and 400 kev .",
    "recent work @xcite suggests that above 400 kev , nuclear structure uncertainties increase appreciably .",
    "the best - fit normalization factor of the @xmath69 calculation for the data between 130 kev and 400 kev was 0.93  @xmath70 , resulting in @xmath9  =  17.8  @xmath71  ev  b , with all sources of uncertainty added in quadrature .",
    "we extrapolated to zero energy using the prescription of jennings _ et al .",

    "the two reaction models describe the data between 130 kev and 2 mev equally well , implying that the theoretical uncertainties in the reaction mechanism are smaller than or comparable to the experimental uncertainties here . in large measure , this is due to the experimental conditions of the exclusive measurement . by limiting the angular acceptance as we did , we probed large impact parameters where the @xmath21 and nuclear contributions are small .",

    "we interpret the required quenching of the @xmath21 matrix elements in 1st - order perturbation theory as a manifestation of higher - order dynamical effects .",
    "for a fixed @xmath21 strength , the predicted asymmetry of the longitudinal momentum distribution is diminished when higher - order effects are considered compared with 1st - order perturbation theory @xcite . in dynamical calculations of the coulomb dissociation of @xmath4b that include higher - order processes @xcite ,",
    "the @xmath20 strength is essentially unaltered , while the @xmath21 strength is reduced with respect to 1st - order perturbation theory calculations .",

    "the analyses of references@xcite have treated the contributions of @xmath21 transitions as negligible , while our data imply they are not . since these experiments covered angular ranges larger than this measurement , they probed smaller impact parameters where @xmath21 transitions are relatively more important .",

    "such a reduction would bring these measurements into even better agreement with the present work .",
    "if we were to analyze our measured coulomb breakup cross section between 130 and 400 kev without considering @xmath21 transitions , the extracted @xmath20 strength would be 5% greater , and the inferred value of @xmath9 would increase to 18.7 @xmath28 1.3 ev b. the small @xmath21 correction is the result of restricting the angular range covered in this experiment , making the @xmath21 contribution to the breakup cross section comparable in magnitude to the statistical uncertainty of the measurement .",

    "<S> in an effort to better determine the @xmath0be(_p_,@xmath1)@xmath2b reaction rate , we have performed inclusive and exclusive measurements of the coulomb dissociation of @xmath2b . the former was a study of longitudinal momentum distributions of @xmath0be fragments emitted in the coulomb breakup of intermediate energy @xmath2b beams on pb and ag targets . </S>",
    "<S> analysis of these data yielded the @xmath32 contribution to the breakup cross section . in the exclusive measurement </S>",
    "<S> , we determined the cross section for the coulomb breakup of @xmath4b on pb at low relative energies in order to infer the astrophysical @xmath5 factor for the @xmath0be(_p_,@xmath1)@xmath2b reaction . interpreting the measurements with 1st - order perturbation theory , we obtained @xmath6 = 4.7 @xmath7 at @xmath8 = 0.6 mev , and @xmath9 = 17.8 @xmath10 ev  b. semiclassical 1st - order perturbation theory and fully quantum mechanical continuum - discretized coupled channels analyses yield nearly identical results for the e1 strength relevant to solar neutrino flux calculations , suggesting that theoretical reaction mechanism uncertainties need not limit the precision of coulomb breakup determinations of the @xmath0be(_p_,@xmath1)@xmath2b @xmath5 factor . a recommended value of @xmath9 based on a weighted average of this and other measurements is presented . </S>"
