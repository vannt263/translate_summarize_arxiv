    "understanding the qcd phase diagram in the temperature  chemical potential ( @xmath0 ) plane has many important implications in cosmology , in astrophysics and in the phenomenology of heavy - ion collisions  ( for a review , see  @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , it is extremely important to localize with high accuracy the critical lines in this plane and to determine if the transition across them is first order , second order or just a crossover  @xcite .",
    "the formulation of the theory on a space - time lattice offers a unique tool for such task .",
    "however , at non - zero chemical potential the determinant of the fermion matrix becomes complex , thus preventing to perform standard monte carlo simulations .",
    "one way out is to take advantage of physical fluctuations in the thermal ensemble generated at @xmath1 in order to extract from it information at ( small ) non - zero @xmath2 , after suitable reweighting  @xcite .",
    "however , it is not possible to know _ a priori _ to what extent the reweighted ensemble overlaps the true one at non - zero @xmath2.-dependence of the chiral condensate and of the number density between the determinations from reweighting and from standard monte carlo techniques .",
    "of course , this does not imply the ineffectiveness of the method in other theories and in different temperature regimes . ]",
    "an alternative approach is based on the idea to perform numerical simulations at _ imaginary _ chemical potential  @xcite , for which the fermion determinant is again real , and to analytically continue the results to real @xmath2  @xcite . in practice , the method consists in fitting the numerical data obtained for _ imaginary _ chemical potential @xmath3 by a polynomial , which is then prolongated to _",
    "real _ @xmath2 .",
    "the advantage of this method lies in the fact that its applicability is not restricted by large lattice volumes , since it makes no use of reweighting .",
    "therefore , size scaling analysis can be made after the analytical continuation to clarify the nature of the transition across the critical lines .",
    "on the other side , a limitation comes from the presence of non - analyticities in @xmath2 , thus implying , as we will see later on , that the method works practically only for @xmath4 .    in particular ,",
    "if non - analyticities are singled out for imaginary @xmath2 and even if numerical data are obtained inside a region of analyticity in the @xmath5 plane , it is necessary that during the `` rotation '' from @xmath3 to real @xmath6 no other non - analyticities are met .",
    "it is understood that non - analyticities show up only in the infinite volume limit and that all observables are analytic on finite lattices .",
    "however , the presence of non - analyticities in the thermodynamical limit is indicated on ( large ) finite volumes by sharp changes in the behavior of physical observables , which is practically difficult to interpolate by polynomials , if not by including a large number of terms .",
    "the papers where the method of analytical continuation has been used so far limited the attention to regions of temperature and chemical potential where this situation does not occur .",
    "of course , the compatibility between the results from two very different approaches , such as reweighting and analytical continuation , would give reasonable confidence on the validity of both .",
    "such consistency has been shown in the case of 4-flavor qcd in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "nevertheless , a test of both methods by comparison with direct determinations from standard monte carlo is interesting , especially because it could shed light also on the applicability outside the regions usually considered in literature . for this purpose , it is necessary to turn to a theory where direct monte carlo simulations in presence of _ real _ chemical potential are feasible .",
    "it is well known that the determinant of the fermion matrix of 2-color qcd or su(2 ) gauge theory is real even in presence of a real chemical potential ( see , for instance  @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , although being very different in the structure of the spectrum  @xcite , 2-color qcd shares many similarities with true qcd , therefore represents the best candidate for the mentioned test .    in this paper",
    "we adopt 2-color qcd to compare determinations of the polyakov loop and of the chiral condensate from the method of analytical continuation with results from direct monte carlo simulations .",
    "in particular , we characterize different regions of the phase diagram in the @xmath5 plane according to the applicability of this method .",
    "our findings can be helpful to apply and to understand the results of the method of analytical continuation in the theory of physical interest , i.e. in true qcd .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  2 we describe the structure of the phase diagram of 2-color qcd in the @xmath5 plane and discuss the implications on the method of analytical continuation ; in section  3 we present the numerical results ; in section  4 we draw some conclusions and anticipate some future developments .",
    "in order to draw the phase diagram of 2-color qcd we make use of known theoretical and numerical results on the behavior with temperature and chemical potential of the polyakov loop @xmath7 and of the chiral condensate @xmath8 .",
    "these objects represent true order parameters only in two limiting cases : the polyakov loop is the order parameter of the confinement - deconfinement transition in the limit of infinite quark masses , while the chiral condensate is that of the chiral transition in the limit of vanishing quark masses .",
    "however , there is a broad numerical evidence that they both exhibit a rapid variation in correspondence of certain values of the parameters of the theory , which therefore are taken as critical ones .",
    "plane according to roberge and weiss  @xcite.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    we start the discussion from the case of imaginary chemical potential , @xmath3 . roberge and weiss have shown  @xcite that the partition function of any su(n ) theory is periodic in the parameter @xmath9 ( the boltzmann constant is set equal to one ) as consequence of a remnant of the z(n ) symmetry valid in absence of fermions . moreover ,",
    "they have shown by weak coupling perturbation theory that above a certain temperature @xmath10 the free energy and the polyakov loop show cusps or discontinuities for @xmath11 , with @xmath12 .",
    "this suggests that there are first order vertical critical lines in the @xmath13 plane located at @xmath11 and extending from @xmath10 to infinity ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "they argue also that below @xmath10 , there is no phase transition for any value of @xmath14 , this being true also in the physical case of @xmath15 .",
    "the latter conclusion can not be true for all values of @xmath16 and of the fermion masses . in the chiral limit of qcd , there are arguments  @xcite according to which a chiral phase transition for @xmath1 does exist and is first order for @xmath17 and second order for @xmath18 . for su(2 ) , where a strong coupling analysis could be applied , according to ref .",
    "@xcite there is a second order chiral phase transition for @xmath19 and @xmath18 . for non - vanishing masses ,",
    "this phase transition probably becomes a crossover .",
    "furthermore , a numerical study on a @xmath20 lattice in su(2 ) with @xmath21 and @xmath22 has shown a peak in the susceptibility of the chiral condensate at @xmath23 , suggesting the possibility of a chiral phase transition near this point  @xcite .    in view of all this ,",
    "the worst case for the purposes of the analytical continuation ( but the most interesting from the point of view of the present study ) is that the roberge - weiss ( rw ) critical line at @xmath24 could be prolongated downwards and bent up to reaching the @xmath25 axis in correspondence of a critical temperature @xmath26 ( see also  @xcite ) . for the reasons mentioned above , this prolongation of the rw critical line",
    "will be referred to in the following as the _ chiral _ critical line  @xcite .",
    "the rw periodicity and the symmetry for @xmath27 , resulting from cp invariance , imply that knowing the expectation value of an observable for @xmath28 and @xmath14 inside the strip @xmath29 in the @xmath13 plane is enough to fix it on the remaining part of the plane . applying this argument also to the critical lines",
    ", we end up with the qualitative structure of the phase diagram drawn in fig .  2 . the actual nature of the transition across the branches of the critical lines of fig .",
    "2 which lie below @xmath10 is to a large extent unknown .",
    "other scenarios of phase diagrams are possible , depending on @xmath16 and on the fermion masses , such as , for instance , that where a chiral critical line emanating from @xmath26 ends somewhere before joining the vertical lines  @xcite .     plane after the inclusion of the chiral critical lines.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    inside the mentioned strip we can single out two regions where the ( non - perturbative ) determinations of an observable can be interpolated by a taylor series in @xmath30 : the region above and the region below the chiral critical line .",
    "this taylor series can be analytically continued to real @xmath6 by the `` rotation '' @xmath31 , if no non - analyticities are met during this rotation .",
    "such a condition is not _ a priori _ guaranteed .",
    "it is evident , that the crucial point is how the critical line in the @xmath13 plane , implicitely defined by @xmath32 , evolves during the rotation from imaginary to real @xmath2 .",
    "a reasonable assumption is that , at the end of the rotation , the critical line in the plane with real @xmath2 is given by @xmath33 , with @xmath34 a monotonically decreasing function in @xmath35 .",
    "another assumption , which needs confirmation by numerical tests , is that the critical line evolves smoothly during the rotation , i.e. it spans in the @xmath36 space a 2-dimensional surface , connecting the critical line in the @xmath37 plane with the one in the @xmath38 plane , which does not possess bumps or ridges or valleys .    if these assumptions are true and the scenario of fig .",
    "2 holds , we can identify three regions in the strip @xmath39 of the @xmath37 plane according to the possibility to apply the analytical continuation :    * @xmath40 : analytical continuation possible for @xmath41 ; * @xmath42 : analytical continuation possible for @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the solution of @xmath45 , i.e. the value of @xmath46 on the chiral critical line at the given temperature ; * @xmath47 : analytical continuation possible for @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the solution of @xmath50 , i.e. the value of @xmath35 on the critical line _ of the @xmath38 plane _ at the given temperature .",
    "so far the method of analytical continuation has been applied , implicitely making the assumptions we have mentioned , to the chiral condensate in the region @xmath40 for qcd with @xmath51  @xcite and to the critical line itself for qcd with @xmath51  @xcite and with @xmath52  @xcite . in the case of qcd with @xmath51 , the analytically continued critical line has been found in agreement with the determination of ref .",
    "@xcite .    in the next section",
    "we will compare the scenario sketched in the above list with numerical simulations in all the three temperature regions . as a test - field theory we use 2-color qcd with @xmath21 and as observables",
    "we adopt the polyakov loop @xmath7 and the chiral condensate @xmath8 .",
    "we consider the formulation of 2-color qcd or su(2 ) gauge theory on a @xmath53 lattice with staggered fermions for non - zero temperature and chemical potential of the baryonic density .",
    "the finite temperature is realized by compactifying the time direction and by imposing ( anti)periodic boundary conditions on ( fermion ) boson fields .",
    "the connection between the temperature @xmath28 and the lattice size in the time direction is @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the lattice spacing and @xmath56 is the bare coupling constant .",
    "the chemical potential is introduced by the replacements  @xcite @xmath57 where @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the gauge link variables in the forward and backward time direction , respectively .",
    "when @xmath2 is purely imaginary these replacements amount to add a constant background u(1 ) field to the original theory . for su(2 )",
    "the fermionic determinant , appearing in the partition function after integration of the fermion fields , is real for any complex value of the chemical potential @xmath2 , thus allowing the monte carlo importance sampling without any limitation .",
    "we adopted in this work the same hybrid simulation algorithm of ref .",
    "since for @xmath60 it is not possible to use the even - odd partitioning , we were forced to simulate eight degenerate continuum flavors .",
    "we performed all the simulations on a @xmath61 lattice , setting the quark bare mass to @xmath22 and the microcanonical time step to @xmath62 .",
    "we made refreshments of the gauge fields every 5 steps of the molecular dynamics and of the pseudofermion fields every 3 steps . in order to reduce autocorrelation effects , we made `` measurements '' every 50 steps and analyzed data by the jackknife method combined with binning .    before presenting the numerical results , it is convenient to redraw the phase diagram discussed in the previous section in units more suitable for the lattice .",
    "in particular , on the vertical axis we put the inverse coupling @xmath63 which is connected to the temperature @xmath28 by a monotonic function in the region of interest ( increasing @xmath63 means increasing temperature ) . on the horizontal axis we put the chemical potential in lattice units , @xmath64 .",
    "the qualitative structure of the phase diagrams in the @xmath65 and in the @xmath66 planes is the same as in the @xmath37 and in the @xmath38 planes . in the new units , however , the rw transition lines in the @xmath65 plane appear at @xmath67 . for @xmath68 the first rw transition line",
    "is located at @xmath69 .",
    "of course , the scenario illustrated at the end of the previous section must be reformulated in terms of @xmath63 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "an estimate of the value of @xmath71 can be deduced from the literature . indeed , in ref .",
    "@xcite , a study of the chiral condensate on a @xmath72 lattice for bare quark mass @xmath22 lead to the result @xmath73 .",
    "since we have a different lattice , we expect a small difference between our @xmath71 and the determination of ref .",
    "however , for our purposes we can safely adopt this value of @xmath71 .    as a first step we took two @xmath63 values , one ( much ) above @xmath71 and likely above @xmath70 , the other below @xmath71 in order to possibly single out a different behavior in @xmath74 of lattice observables across @xmath75 .",
    "we took @xmath63=1.80 for the higher @xmath63 value and @xmath76 for the lower and determined the polyakov loop and the chiral condensate for @xmath74 ranging between 0 and the value corresponding to the second rw critical line , i.e. @xmath77 . the results are shown in figs .  3 and  4 .",
    "we can clearly see the rw periodicity in all cases ; however , for @xmath78 we have discontinuity for the polyakov loop and cusp for the chiral condensate across the first rw critical line , while for @xmath76 the behavior is smooth for both observables .",
    "we have verified that the overshooting of the first rw critical line seen in fig .  3 is due to an hysteresis effect , which confirms the first order nature of the transition .    in order to proceed with the test of the method of analytical continuation",
    "we need also an estimation of @xmath70 .",
    "there is a nice procedure to do it , suggested in ref .",
    "it relies on performing simulations at a critical value of @xmath79 , say @xmath75 , and on changing @xmath63 from a very high value downwards .",
    "if the zero field configuration is chosen as the starting one , the system remains always in the phase on the left of the rw line until @xmath80 , if the flip to the other phase is prevented by a large space volume .",
    "due to our limited computational power , we are constrained to a space volume which is too small to prevent flips between the two phases .",
    "an alternative procedure to determine @xmath70 could be to study the behavior of the polyakov loop ( or of its phase ) and of the chiral condensate across the rw critical lines for different @xmath63 values and to see when the discontinuities or the cusps are smoothed out .",
    "another possibility could be to exploit the hysteresis effect in the polyakov loop or in the chiral condensate determinations across the rw critical line .",
    "the procedure consists in building two sequences of expectation values of the polyakov loop ; in the first ( second ) sequence the starting configuration of any new run is taken to be a thermal equilibrium configuration being always in the phase on the left ( right ) side of the first rw transition . across the rw",
    "critical line the comparison of these two sequences of data shows a hysteresis effect as long as @xmath80 .",
    "this effect disappears below @xmath70 .",
    "of course , both the above procedures demand for a high statistics and , so far , we can only say that @xmath70 is bounded between about 1.53 and about 1.57 .",
    "this level of accuracy is , however , enough for the purposes of the present study .",
    "we turn now to the main part of this work , i.e. the test if the scenario presented at the end of the previous section holds .",
    "we selected three values of @xmath63 ( 1.90 , 1.45 , 0.90 ) , each representative of one of the regions @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "for each @xmath63 we have performed simulations for both real and imaginary chemical potential , varying @xmath79 and @xmath83 between 0 and @xmath84 and have determined expectation values of the polyakov loop and of the chiral condensate .",
    "then , we have interpolated the data obtained for imaginary @xmath2 with a _ truncated _ taylor series of the form @xmath85 .",
    "after `` rotating '' this polynomial to real chemical potential , thus leading to @xmath86 , we have compared it with the determinations obtained directly for real @xmath6 .",
    "for @xmath87 we have interpolated with the fourth order polynomial the data obtained for @xmath88 and have found that the rotated polynomial perfectly interpolates data obtained directly for real @xmath6 in the same range ( see fig .",
    "the uncertainty in the rotated polynomial has been obtained by propagating in standard way the uncertainty on the fitted coefficients @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "we have verified that the same situation occurs for other values of @xmath63 larger than @xmath70 . from this outcome",
    "we can conclude that the analytical continuation works in the region @xmath80 for all the @xmath74 s before the first rw critical line .    for @xmath92",
    "we are in the region @xmath93 for which , if the scenario presented at the end of the previous section holds , we expect that by varying @xmath79 we meet the chiral critical line , while no transitions should be met at the same @xmath63 by varying @xmath83 .",
    "therefore this time we have interpolated with the fourth order polynomial the data obtained for the _ real _ chemical potential @xmath94 and have rotated this polynomial to its counterpart in @xmath74 .",
    "the comparison with data obtained directly for imaginary chemical potential shows agreement for @xmath74 below @xmath95 , which can be taken as an estimate of the chiral critical value in the @xmath96 plane at the given @xmath63 ( see fig .",
    "6 ) .    for @xmath97",
    ", we expect analyticity for all possible values of @xmath79 , while the chiral critical line in the @xmath98 plane is met by varying @xmath99 at the given value of @xmath63 .",
    "therefore we have interpolated with the fourth order polynomial the data obtained for @xmath100 and have rotated this polynomial to its counterpart in @xmath99 .",
    "the comparison with data obtained directly for real chemical potential shows agreement for @xmath99 below @xmath101 , which can be taken as an estimate of the critical value in the @xmath98 plane at the given @xmath63 ( see fig .",
    ".    we can conclude from these results that the scenario of the end of the previous section is consistent , thus giving support to the assumptions underlying it .",
    "in this paper we have presented a possible structure of the phase diagram in the temperature  imaginary chemical potential in 2-color qcd and have argued how this structure can be continued to real chemical potential .",
    "then , we have shown that the scenario we have described is consistent with monte carlo numerical determinations of the polyakov loop and of the chiral condensate for real and imaginary chemical potential .",
    "in particular , we have found that the method of analytical continuation , largely exploited now in the literature for the physically interesting case of qcd , works fine within the restrictions posed by the presence of non - analyticities .",
    "we plan , moreover , to further develop the present ideas by ( a ) determining the location of the critical lines for real and imaginary chemical potential by the standard method of susceptibilities , ( b ) verifying that the critical lines for real chemical potential can be obtained from analytical continuation of those for imaginary chemical potential , ( c ) following the `` evolution '' of the critical lines during the rotation from imaginary to real chemical potential by simulations with _",
