    "the @xmath0 nucleus optical potential has been a subject of intense study for a long time linked to the existence of @xmath0 bound states in nuclei  @xcite-@xcite .",
    "this latter topic has been the object of research lately and several reactions , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are being investigated at gsi  @xcite and others are being carried out or proposed in other laboratories  @xcite . with the exception of the @xmath0 in the two nucleon system where two independent works seem to rule out a bound state @xcite , all the other works predict bound @xmath0 states from @xmath8he up . experimentally there is no evidence that bound @xmath0 states exist and their observation might be problematic since , even if there are bound states , their widths could be very large compared to the separation of the levels .",
    "this was indeed the case in the potential derived in ref .",
    "however , as shown in this latter reference , there were large uncertainties in the potential , and hence in the energy and width of the bound states , mostly tied to the uncertainty in the binding potential of the @xmath9 resonance in the nucleus .",
    "this has been an open problem for years and only recently was it possible to give a credible answer to this question .",
    "the answer has come from the study of refs .",
    "@xcite where the @xmath10 and coupled channels scattering was investigated up to energies above the @xmath9 resonance , including the @xmath11 elastic scattering of relevance for the @xmath0 interaction in nuclei .",
    "the study was done using techniques of unitarized chiral perturbation theory adapted to the meson baryon interaction  @xcite which followed and extended the works using chiral lagrangians and the lippmann - schwinger equation initiated in refs .",
    "@xcite . in such schemes",
    "the @xmath9 resonance is generated dynamically from the multiple scattering of the mesons implied in the lippmann - schwinger equation of refs .",
    "@xcite , the bethe - salpeter equation of refs .",
    "@xcite or in the n / d unitarization method used in ref .",
    "this is important , since by implementing systematically medium corrections to the scattering equation , one can see how the pole of the @xmath9 resonance is changed in the nuclear medium and thus eliminate the main source of uncertainty of earlier evaluations of the @xmath0 nucleus optical potential .",
    "this latter work was conducted in ref .",
    "@xcite , using the vacuum amplitude of ref .",
    "@xcite , and the @xmath0 nucleus optical potential was evaluated in a selfconsistent way , as it was done for the antikaon case in ref .",
    "@xcite . among other results , in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was shown that the @xmath9 resonance barely moved in the nuclear medium with respect to the free - space , although its width was certainly changed .",
    "besides in that reference , the @xmath0 selfenergy in the nuclear medium was evaluated as a function of the @xmath0 energy , its momentum and the nuclear density . in this work ,",
    "we use the optical potential developed there in order to calculate @xmath12nucleus bound states , with the aim of finding the optimal nuclei to search for such states .",
    "this condition is met when there is a minimum overlap between the states , and the half widths are not much bigger than the separation of the levels .",
    "we find this situation for medium size nuclei rather than in the light ones , which have been mostly used or suggested up to now in the search for such states .",
    "in ref .  @xcite the self - energy of the @xmath0 meson is evaluated in nuclear matter at various densities @xmath13 , as a function of the @xmath0 energy , @xmath14 , and its momentum , @xmath15 , in the nuclear matter frame .",
    "it is calculated by means of @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the momentum of the neutron and the fermi momentum at nuclear density @xmath13 respectively , and @xmath19 is the @xmath0-neutron in - medium @xmath20wave interaction , with the total four - momentum of the system @xmath21 in the nuclear matter frame , namely @xmath22 and @xmath23 . here , the isospin symmetry , @xmath24 , is assumed and the amplitude is summed over nucleons in the fermi sea . since we are interested in finding bound states , we shall be concerned about the @xmath20wave @xmath0 self - energy which around the @xmath9 region is largely the most relevant , given the large @xmath20wave coupling of this resonance to the @xmath11 states .    the in - medium interaction @xmath25 is obtained by basing on the model of ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath10 and coupled channels scattering .",
    "that model reproduces the experimental data of @xmath10 scattering up to energies above the @xmath9 region .",
    "a similar chiral approach which covers a much wider energy range in isospin 1/2 , although with more free parameters , is also done in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the bethe - salpeter equation is considered with eight coupled channels including two @xmath26 states , namely \\{@xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34}. the kernels for the meson - baryon two - body sector are taken from the lowest order chiral lagrangians and improved by applying a form factor corresponding to a vector meson exchange in the @xmath35-channel .",
    "the kernels for @xmath36 transitions are determined so that they account for both the @xmath10 elastic and @xmath37 processes .",
    "that model reproduces well the the @xmath10 scattering amplitudes , especially in isospin 1/2 , for the center of mass energy energies from threshold to 1600 mev .",
    "it reproduces also the @xmath38 cross section at the region where the @xmath39-wave contribution is negligible . in this coupled channels approach , the model also provides the @xmath11 interaction in free space and generates dynamically the @xmath9 resonance providing the width and branching ratios for its decay in good agreement with experiment , among them the @xmath11 branching ratio which is quite large for that resonance .",
    "the agreement of the model with the different available data around the @xmath9 resonance region and the adequate description of the properties of the resonance , in particular the strong coupling to the @xmath11 state , give us confidence that the model is rather accurate to make predictions on the @xmath40 interaction and @xmath0 nucleus interaction .",
    "the medium effects in the @xmath11 scattering amplitude which are considered in ref .",
    "@xcite are : 1 ) the pauli blocking of the intermediate nucleon states appearing in the bethe ",
    "salpeter equation .",
    "2 ) the selfenergy of the mesons ( pions , kaons and eta ) in the intermediate states , with the @xmath0 selfenergy considered selfconsistently .",
    "3 ) the baryon selfenergy of the intermediate states ( n , @xmath41 and @xmath42 ) .",
    "= 85 mm    the results obtained for the @xmath0 selfenergy can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : iiabc ] .",
    "there one can see that the @xmath0 selfenergy around zero @xmath0 energy and negative values is strongly energy dependent , both for the real and the imaginary parts . in order to have a feeling of the strength of the potential we can evaluate the optical potential by means of @xmath43 this simple prescription gives the potential of @xmath44 mev at normal nuclear matter density .",
    "this means that one can expect bound states with around 50 mev binding and a width of about 60 mev .",
    "however , the energy dependence of the selfenergy is quite strong as one can see from fig .",
    "[ fig : iiabc ] and , hence , a realistic determination of the @xmath0 bound states should take that into account .",
    "for such purpose the results of ref .",
    "@xcite were parametrized in terms of analytical functions in the energy range @xmath45 as @xmath46 & = &            a(\\rho ) + b(\\rho)(k^0-m_{\\eta } )        + c(\\rho)(k^0-m_{\\eta})^2 + d(\\rho)(k^0-m_{\\eta})^3 \\nonumber \\\\",

    "we use the local density approximation , substituting @xmath13 by @xmath48 , the local density at each point in the nucleus which we take from experiment . for the @xmath20wave that we use here , it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the local density approximation ( lda ) gave the same results as a direct finite nucleus calculation .",
    "in the next section we solve the klein ",
    "gordon equation with the two potentials : @xmath49 the energy dependent one , defined in eqs .",

    "( [ eq : self ] ) .",
    "finally , we discuss the implications of our results in the practical search for these @xmath0 bound states .",

    "are being considered .    in order to solve the kge in coordinate space we use a numerical algorithm which has been extensively tested in the similar problems of pionic  @xcite and antikaonic  @xcite atomic states and in the search of possible antikaon - nucleus bound states  @xcite .",
    "charge densities are taken from ref .",
    "@xcite . for each nucleus",
    ", we take the neutron matter density approximately equal to the charge one , though we consider small changes , inspired by hartree - fock calculations with the dme ( density - matrix expansion )  @xcite and corroborated by pionic atom analysis  @xcite . in table  1 of ref .",
    "@xcite all the densities used throughout this work can be found",
    ". however , charge ( neutron matter ) densities do not correspond to proton ( neutron ) ones because of the finite size of the proton ( neutron ) .",
    "we take that into account following the lines of ref .",
    "@xcite and use the proton ( neutron ) densities in our approach .",
    "our results are shown in tables 1 and 2 for the energy dependent and energy independent potentials respectively .",
    "we also show them in graphic form in fig .",
    "[ fig : i ] . as an average",
    "we can see that the binding energies are about double with the energy independent potential than with the energy dependent one , which shows the importance of taking into account this effect . on the other hand",
    "we see that the half widths of the states are large , larger in fact than the binding energies or the separation energies between neighboring states .",
    "the widths are also smaller with the energy dependent potential , but comparatively to the size of the binding energies they are a little bit larger .    .",

    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      +    with the results obtained here it looks like the chances to see distinct peaks corresponding to @xmath0 bound states are not too big .",
    "however , the systematics carried out with the study of different nuclei is instructive .",
    "indeed , we see that the tendency for nuclei lighter than @xmath3 is that the binding energy becomes smaller but the half width stays comparatively more stable , such that the ratio of the width to binding energy becomes bigger for lighter nuclei and hence the chances to see these bound states become smaller .",
    "this tendency seems to be telling us that the light nuclei is definitively not the place where one should search for @xmath0 bound states . on the other hand ,",
    "if we go to heavy nuclei , like @xmath60 , there is a superposition of many bound states and the separation of the levels is small compared to the half width of these states .",
    "the chances to see peaks there are null . on the other hand",
    "there is a region , which , even with difficulty , still provides the optimum ground to see the @xmath0 bound states .",
    "this appears around the @xmath61 region where the binding energy is similar to the half width and there is only one bound state .",
    "if one goes to heavier nuclei the ratio of binding energy versus width become bigger , a welcome feature for the observation of the bound states , but simultaneously there appear new bound states , as one can see in @xmath62 , such that the half width of the states is much bigger than the separation between the levels . with all these considerations one comes to the conclusion that the region of nuclei around @xmath3 would offer the best chances to see the @xmath0 bound states . in this case , with a binding energy of around 12.5 mev and a half width of 16.7 mev one could see still some broad bump .",
    "on the other hand one can look at the results with a more optimistic view if one simply takes into account that experiments searching for these states might not see them as peaks , but they should see some clear strength below threshold in the @xmath0 production experiments .",
    "the range by which this strength would go into the bound region would measure the combination of half width and binding energy .",
    "even if this is less information than the values of the energy and width of the states , it is by all means a relevant information to gain some knowledge on the @xmath0 nucleus optical potential .",
    "we have used a recent @xmath0 nucleus optical potential , evaluated within a unitarized chiral perturbative approach , in order to find @xmath0 bound states .",
    "the potential is attractive and produces bound states for all nuclei which we study from @xmath1 up . on the other hand it also produces large widths , with the half widths slightly larger than the binding energy , which makes the observation of these states unlikely .",
    "we calculated the results using an energy independent potential , which is obtained taking the value of the potential for an @xmath0 energy equal to its mass .",
    "the second , more realistic potential , takes into account the strong energy dependence of the potential due to the fact that it is much influenced by the @xmath9 resonance appearing above the @xmath11 threshold .",
    "this potential reduces the strength of both the real and imaginary parts of the potential for energies below the @xmath0 threshold and leads to substantially narrower states , but at the same time with smaller binding energies , such that the half widths of the states are still larger than the binding energies .",
    "we found that light nuclei are not the best ones to search for @xmath0 bound states since the widths become comparatively much larger than the binding energies .",
    "the heavy nuclei accommodate many bound states and the separation of the levels is much smaller than the half width of the states .",
    "the best chances for observation of bound states are in the region of @xmath3 where there is only one bound state and the half width is only a little bigger than the binding energy . in any case it was stressed that , even if no broad bumps are found in the experiments , they should find some strength in the bound region stretching in energy down to the sum of the binding energy plus the half width of the bound states .",
    "short of having the values for the binding energy and width of the states , this more limited information is still very valuable to gain some knowledge on the @xmath0 nucleus optical potential and it should stimulate experiments in this direction .",
