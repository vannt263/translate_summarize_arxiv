    "in this note we study a class of systems whose parameters are driven by a time reversed markov chain . given a time horizon @xmath0 and a standard markov chain @xmath1",
    "taking values in the set @xmath2 , we consider the process @xmath3 and the system @xmath4 where , as usual , @xmath5 represents the state variable of the system and @xmath6 is the control variable . these systems may be encountered in real world problems , specially when a markov chain interacts with the system parameters via a _ first in last out _ queue .",
    "an example consists of drilling sedimentary rocks whose layers can be modelled by a markov chain from bottom to top as a consequence of their formation process .",
    "the first drilled layer is the last formed one .",
    "another example is a dc - motor whose brush is grind by a machine subject to failures , leaving a series of imprecisions on the brush width that can be described by a markov chain , so that the last failure will be the first to affect the motor collector depending on how the brush is installed .",
    "one of the most remarkable features of system @xmath7 is that it provides a dual for optimal filtering of standard _",
    "markov jump linear systems _ ( mjls ) .",
    "in fact , if we consider a quadratic cost functional for system @xmath7 with linear state feedback , leading to an optimal control problem @xcite that we call _ time reversed markov jump linear quadratic _ problem ( trm - jlqp ) , then we show that the solution is identical to the gains of the _ linear minimum mean square estimator _ ( lmmse ) formulated in @xcite , with time - reversed gains and transposed matrices . in perspective with existing duality relations ,",
    "the one obtained here is a direct generalization of the well known relation between control and filtering of linear time varying systems as presented for instance in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* table 6.1 ) , or also in @xcite in different contexts . as for mjls , the duality between control and filtering",
    "have been considered e.g. in @xcite , while purely in the context of standard mjls , thus leading to more complex relations involving certain generalized coupled riccati difference equations . here",
    ", the duality follows naturally from the simple reversion of the markov chain given in , with no extra assumptions nor complex constructions .",
    "another interesting feature of @xmath7 is that the variable @xmath8 , which is commonly used in the literature of mjls , @xcite , evolves along time @xmath9 according to a _ time - varying _ linear operator , as shown in remark [ rem_evolution_first_moment ] , in a marked dissimilarity with standard mjls .",
    "this motivated us to employ @xmath10 , the conditioned second moment of @xmath11 , leading to time - homogeneous operators .",
    "the contents of this note are as follows .",
    "we present basic notation in section [ sec - notation ] . in section [ sec - sys ]",
    "we give the recursive equation describing @xmath12 , which leads to a stability condition involving the spectral radius of a time - homogeneous linear operator . in section [ sec - problem ] ,",
    "we formulate and solve the trm - jlq problem , following a proof method where we decompose @xmath12 into two components as to handle @xmath13 that are visited with zero probability . the duality with the lmmse then follows in a straightforward manner , as presented in section [ sec - duality ] .",
    "concluding remarks are given in section [ sec - conclusions ] .",
    "let @xmath14 be the @xmath15-dimensional euclidean space and @xmath16 be the space formed by real matrices of dimension @xmath17 by @xmath15 .",
    "we write @xmath18 to represent the hilbert space composed of @xmath19 real matrices , that is @xmath20 , where @xmath21 , @xmath22 .",
    "the space @xmath23 equipped with the inner product @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the trace operator and the superscript @xmath26 denotes the transpose , is a hilbert space .",

    "if @xmath28 , we write simply @xmath29 .",
    "the mathematical operations involving elements of @xmath23 , are used in element - wise fashion , e.g. for @xmath30 and @xmath31 in @xmath29 we have @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the usual matrix multiplication .",
    "similarly , for a set of scalars @xmath34 we write @xmath35 .    regarding the system setup , it is assumed throughout the paper that @xmath36 is a random variable with zero mean satisfying @xmath37 .",
    "we have @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",

    "however , calculations similar to that in lemma [ lem - def - second - moment ] lead to @xmath80 note that the markov chain measure appears explicitly , leading to a time - varying mapping from @xmath81 to @xmath82 .",
    "the only exception is when the markov chain is _ reversible _ , in which case the facts that @xmath83 and that the markov chain starts with the invariant measure ( by definition ) yield @xmath84 in which case @xmath85 evolves exactly as in a standard mjls .",
    "the following notion is adapted from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 3 ) .",
    "we say that the system @xmath7 with @xmath65 is _ mean square stable _ ( ms - stable ) , whenever @xmath86    this is equivalent to say that the variable @xmath87 converges to zero as @xmath0 goes to infinity , leading to the following result .",

    "this `` time shifting '' in @xmath52 avoids a cluttering in the duality relation . along the same line , instead of writing the filter gains as a function of the variable @xmath177 , given by the coupled riccati difference equation ( * ? ? ?",
