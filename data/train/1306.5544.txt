    "massive neutrinos leave distinct imprints in the different cosmological data sets .",
    "concerning cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies , the primary effect of neutrino masses is via the _ early integrated sachs wolfe effect_. the transition from the relativistic to the non relativistic neutrino regime will affect the decays of the gravitational potentials at the decoupling period , leading to a non negligible signature around the first peak .",
    "this has been , traditionally , the most relevant signature from neutrino masses on the cmb  @xcite .",
    "however , recent neutrino mass bounds from planck data  @xcite , seem to be driven by the massive neutrino signature on gravitational lensing .",
    "a non zero value of the neutrino mass will induce a higher expansion rate which will suppress the clustering on scales smaller than the horizon while neutrinos turn non relativistic  @xcite .",
    "regarding large scale structure , due to the large neutrino velocity dispersion , the non - relativistic neutrino overdensities will only cluster at wavelengths larger than their free streaming scale .",
    "consequently , the growth of matter density perturbations is reduced and the matter power spectrum is suppressed at small scales , see ref . @xcite and references therein . therefore , cosmological data provide a unique tool to test the neutrino masses , see refs .",
    "@xcite for neutrino mass bounds before planck cmb data release .",
    "the limits from planck satellite , including lensing as well as low-@xmath5 polarization measurements from wmap 9-year data  @xcite ( wp ) are @xmath6  ev at @xmath2  cl .",
    "the addition of a prior on the hubble constant @xmath7 from the hubble space telescope  @xcite improves the constraint in a very significant way , @xmath8  ev . this is due to the strong degeneracy between @xmath7 and @xmath9 at @xmath2  cl : if the sum of the neutrino masses is increased , the change induced in the distance to last scattering can be compensated by lowering @xmath7  @xcite . however , planck and hst measurements of the hubble constant @xmath7 show a @xmath10 tension and therefore , it is fortunate that datasets other than the hst prior may help in pinning down the bound on neutrino mass from cmb data alone .",
    "baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao ) data , as measured by the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) data release 7  @xcite , the wigglez survey  @xcite , the baryon acoustic spectroscopic survey ( boss ) sdss - iii data release 9  @xcite and 6df  @xcite , also significantly improve the constraints , leading to @xmath11  ev at @xmath2  cl when combined with planck ( with lensing ) and wp data . however , in non minimal scenarios with a curvature or with a more general dark energy component these constraints are notably degraded and _ geometrical _ bao information from galaxy clustering may not be as powerful as _ shape _ measurements of the matter power spectrum .",
    "previous works  @xcite have noticed the advantages of using full power spectrum measurements in extended cosmological scenarios due to their ability of removing degeneracies .    here",
    "we combine recent planck data with galaxy power spectrum measurements from the boss experiment  @xcite , one of the four surveys of the sloan digital sky survey iii , sdss - iii  @xcite .",
    "we consider first the 2d angular power spectrum measurements  @xcite from the cmass sample  @xcite of luminous galaxies of sdss data release 8 ( dr8 )  @xcite .",
    "we then explore as well the neutrino mass constraints from the full 3d power spectrum shape of sdss data release 9 ( dr9 )  @xcite . while dr8 contains the full photometric cmass sample ,",
    "dr9 provides the galaxy spectra of cmass galaxies , the largest publicly available set of galaxy spectra to date .    the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite , in the context of a @xmath0cdm model , found @xmath12  ev ( @xmath11  ev ) at @xmath2  cl with ( without ) shot noise - like parameters when combining wmap 7 year data with dr8 2d angular power spectrum measurements plus a hst prior on @xmath7 . exploiting dr9 3d power spectrum measurements ref .",

    "<S> we present here bounds on neutrino masses from the combination of recent planck cosmic microwave background measurements and galaxy clustering information from the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey ( boss ) , part of the sloan digital sky survey - iii . </S>",
    "<S> we use the full shape of either the photometric angular clustering ( data release 8) or the 3d spectroscopic clustering ( data release 9 ) power spectrum in different cosmological scenarios . in the @xmath0cdm scenario , </S>",
    "<S> spectroscopic galaxy clustering measurements improve significantly the existing neutrino mass bounds from planck data . </S>",
    "<S> we find @xmath1  ev at @xmath2 confidence level for the combination of the 3d power spectrum with planck cmb data ( with lensing included ) and wilkinson microwave anisoptropy probe 9-year polarization measurements . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , robust neutrino mass constraints can be obtained without the addition of the prior on the hubble constant from hst .    in extended cosmological scenarios with a dark energy fluid or with non flat geometries , galaxy clustering measurements are essential to pin down the neutrino mass bounds , providing in the majority of cases better results than those obtained from the associated measurement of the baryon acoustic oscillation scale only . in the presence of a freely varying ( constant ) dark energy equation of state </S>",
