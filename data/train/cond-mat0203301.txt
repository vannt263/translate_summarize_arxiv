    "the supercooled liquid regime is the interesting state of the matter which precedes the glass formation ( once the crystal state is avoided ) .",
    "many efforts have been devoted to better understand the relevant physical processes taking place in the supercooled state , the most important being the enormous increase of both relaxation times and inverse diffusivity by many order of magnitude upon decreasing the temperature @xcite . in recent years",
    "the numerical investigation of simple model liquids has provided a very useful microscopic description of the supercooled regime and a detailed picture of the structural rearrangement of atoms during the dynamic evolution .",
    "one of the most powerful frameworks for the study of supercooled state has been the so called potential energy surface ( pes ) description of the system @xcite .",
    "this approach focuses on the properties of the multi - dimensional surface of the total potential energy sampled during the time evolution of the representative point in the @xmath4-dimensional configuration space ( @xmath5 is the total number of particles ) .",
    "different landscape features may control the motion of the particles @xcite , and the aim is to find those characteristics of the pes that have a direct relationship with ( if possible the main causes of ) the emergent behavior of the relevant physical quantities .",
    "the challenge is to find the `` _ good _ '' landscape features that one supposes to be responsible for the interesting phenomena , or at least useful to give a clear interpretation of them . among others ,",
    "two different landscape approaches have been widely used in the last decades in this context : the instantaneous normal modes ( inm ) approach @xcite , based on the investigation of the pes very close to the instantaneous point in the configuration space during the molecular dynamics evolution of the system , and the inherent structures ( is ) approach @xcite , based on the analysis of the minima of pes visited by the system during its dynamic evolution . in this paper",
    "we describe and revisit in a detailed way an additional approach , that has been very useful to give new insight in the analysis of the relevant processes taking place in the supercooled liquid regime .",
    "this approach focuses on the minima of the square gradient of the total potential energy , `` closest '' to the instantaneous points of the molecular dynamics trajectory .",
    "this approach allows one to obtain a microscopic interpretation of the relevant processes , the main result being the characterization of the dynamics above and below the mode coupling temperature @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "moreover , the analysis of these points allows one to obtain information about some relevant characteristics of the pes , of great importance to construct simplified models of the landscape .    lets us briefly",
    "resume the two main pes approaches , the inm and th is approach .",
    "the inm method is based on the investigation of the pes around the instantaneous configurations @xmath6 ( @xmath6 represents the @xmath4-dimesional vector of the representative point in the configuration space ) during the molecular dynamics evolution of the system .",
    "the diffusive quantities are supposed to be related to the shape of the energy surface at @xmath6 , that is to say to the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the hessian matrix ( the second derivative of the potential energy ) .",
    "the main hypothesis of the inm approach is that the relevant diffusive directions have to be searched among the downward curvatures ( eigenvectors with negative eigenvalues ) .",
    "many attempts have been devoted to extend this approach to different liquid systems and to develop a theory of the supercooled liquid state based on inm concepts .",
    "moreover many efforts have been spent to recognize the true diffusive directions among all the downward ones , as it is known there are downward curvatures that do not correspond to diffusive directions , notably in the crystalline state .",
    "the inm negative curvature directions are classified as _ shoulder modes _ ( related to anharmonicities of the pes ) and _ double wells _ ( with a double well shaped one - dimensional profile ) .",
    "diffusive directions are finally identified as those leading to different minima @xcite ( this analysis involves the search of the minima of the pes ) .",
    "the temperature dependence of the diffusion coefficient has been shown to be related to the temperature dependence of the fraction of diffusive directions @xcite .",
    "on the basis of this analogy , it has been conjectured a structural interpretation of the mode coupling temperature @xmath2 as the temperature at which the number of diffusive directions goes to zero @xcite .",
    "the second is landscape approach is based on the analysis of the inherent structures , the minima of the pes . to each instantaneous configuration @xmath6 one",
    "associates a inherent structure @xmath7 ( using , for example , a steepest descent path starting from @xmath6 ) , @xmath8 , partitioning the whole pes in the basins of attraction of minima .",
    "this kind of analysis has been very useful not only in the study of the diffusive directions in the supercooled regime ( see the previous discussion about the inm ) , but also in the study of thermodynamic quantities ( for example to evaluate the configurational entropy @xcite ) and in the study of the out - of - equilibrium dynamics @xcite .    in the present work",
    "we adopt a new approach in the analysis of the pes , in some way intermediate between the previous two , in that it maintains information about the possible diffusive degrees of freedom ( as the inm approach ) and uses a mapping in the pes that associates instantaneous configurations @xmath6 to new points in the pes ( as the is approach ) . in this approach @xcite the minima @xmath9 of the square gradient of the potential energy @xmath10 ( saddles and some inflection points of the pes ) , reached starting from equilibrated configurations @xmath6 , are calculated .",
    "this procedure partitions the pes in basins of attraction of this new points : @xmath11 .",
    "the choice of @xmath12 , suggested long time ago by weber and stillinger @xcite , was motivated by the fact that saddles points of @xmath0 are absolute minima of @xmath12 .",
    "as pointed out recently by doye and wales @xcite and discussed in more details in the following , the numerical minimization of @xmath12 locates mostly local minima of @xmath12 , i.e. points which are not real saddles of @xmath0 . for this reason in the following",
    "we refer to the local minima of @xmath12 as quasi saddle points ( qsp ) @xcite . in ref.s @xcite and",
    "@xcite the topological and metrical properties of such points have been used for a description of the dynamics of supercooled liquids .",
    "the investigated systems were monatomic lennard - jones and/or binary mixture lennard - jones .",
    "after equilibration of the system at a given temperature @xmath13 , corresponding to a given instantaneous potential energy @xmath14 , the minima of @xmath12 were searched and associated to the stationary points of @xmath0 ( saddles ) .",
    "then the energy @xmath15 and the number of negative curvatures @xmath16 at these saddle points were measured .",
    "the dependence of @xmath15 and @xmath16 on the temperature @xcite or on @xmath14 @xcite show interesting properties : ( _ i _ ) the quantity @xmath16 extrapolates to zero at @xmath2 , demonstrating the validity of the conjecture that @xmath2 marks the transition between a dynamics among minima at low @xmath13 and a dynamics among saddles at high @xmath13 ; ( _ ii _ ) the aspects of the energy landscape seen by a given minimum is highly regular ( as demonstrated by the linear dependence of @xmath16 on @xmath17 @xcite or on @xmath15 @xcite ) .",
    "the previous observation leads to the conclusion that the knowledge of the _ saddle _ points properties can be used to predict the supercooled dynamics and points out the relevance of these peculiar pes points .",
    "following these papers , the concept of _ saddles _ - as obtained by a minimization of @xmath18 - has been further used in the investigation of the supercooled liquid dynamics @xcite and aging dynamics @xcite .    as we anticipated above",
    ", there is a drawback in the approach used in ref.s @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in fact , while it is true that in a saddle point ( stationary point ) of the @xmath4-dimensional surface @xmath19 , the function @xmath12 has a minimum ( actually , @xmath20 there and @xmath12 has a global minimum ) , the reverse is not guaranteed to be true .",
    "there are local minima of @xmath12 , with @xmath21 , that are not stationary points of @xmath0 . in these points , along one or more directions @xmath22 , parametrized by @xmath23 , the function @xmath24 has an inflection point . in these inflection points ( qsp )",
    ", the hessian of @xmath0 has a number of vanishing eigenvalues ( excluding the three translation directions ) equal to the number of directions @xmath22 where @xmath0 has an inflection point .",
    "this property has been used in @xcite in order to identify the qsp : a threshold was arbitrary chosen , and all the minimizations of @xmath12 that lead to points where the hessian of @xmath0 has at least one eigenvalue smaller ( in modulus ) than the threshold were discarded from the analysis . in @xcite we claimed that only a small fraction of minimizations ended in a qsp points , and we estimated in @xmath25 the error introduced in @xmath16 by the choice of the threshold .",
    "doye and wales @xcite have shown - by the analysis of the same system investigated in @xcite and @xcite , the bmlj with periodic boundary conditions - that almost all ( around @xmath26 in their work ) the minimizations of @xmath12 ended in a qsp point , and not in a true saddle as claimed in @xcite and @xcite . motivated by such contradictory results , we reanalyzed the minima of @xmath12 found in @xcite . in this work",
    "we show the result of such an analysis .",
    "we conclude that the results of doye and wales are correct and the error in the analysis in @xcite originates from the `` imperfect '' minimization of @xmath12 : in a point close to ( but not exactly at ) qsp , the hessian of @xmath0 no longer has `` small '' eigenvalues , and the criterion used to identify false saddles fails .",
    "one puzzling question , however , still remains open : why the quantity @xmath16 - i.e. the number of negative eigenvalues at the minima of @xmath12 - is related to the critical temperature of the system ?",
    "it remains true that @xmath27 extrapolates to zero at @xmath2 . in the present paper",
    "we address this question , and we will further stress the importance of the quantity @xmath16 ; we will show that also the transport properties ( namely the diffusion coefficient ) can be determined by the knowledge of @xmath16 .",
    "the paper is organized as follow : in section ii we describe the new approach , defining the saddles of the pes and studying very carefully their operative definition and the problems related to the presence of false saddles .",
    "then in section iii we expose the relevant results obtained with the new pes approach , giving a topological interpretation of the mode coupling dynamic transition . in section",
    "iv the relationship between diffusivity and saddle properties is evidenced , giving a simple interpretation of the diffusion processes in terms of saddle order . in section",
    "v we describe some landscape features as emerged from saddle analysis . in section vi a simplified model of the pes is described , together with its relevant properties compared to the features of model liquids investigated above . at the end ( section vii ) a brief summary of the main results and conclusions are reported .",
    "the analyzed system is a simple model liquid , a monatomic modified lennard - jones 6 - 12 ( mlj ) .",
    "the model is able to support strong supercooling without the occurrence of crystallization , due to the presence of a small perturbation term in the hamiltonian that inhibits ordering ( this term is a function of the static structure factor , see ref .",
    "@xcite for more details ) .",
    "the system is composed of @xmath28 particles enclosed in a cubic box with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "truncated ( @xmath29 ) and shifted lj potential are used .",
    "equilibrium configuration are prepared by standard microcanonical molecular dynamics simulations at constant density @xmath30 ( standard lj units are used hereafter ) and at temperatures ranging from the normal liquid phase ( @xmath31 ) down to the mode coupling temperature ( @xmath32 , estimated from diffusivity ) .    the aim of our approach is to use a method of investigation of the pes that allows us to reject all the _ non - relevant _ degrees of freedom for the description of the slow supercooled dynamics .",
    "the idea is that there are particular points of the pes associated in some way to the instantaneous configurations , and that the properties of these points contain all the important information for the determination of the slow dynamics .",
    "possible and natural candidates are the saddle points of the pes . in principle",
    "one can think to partition the whole configuration space in basins of attraction of saddles ( the definition of the partition is obviously not unique , a possible choice could be that obtained using the voronoi polyhedra in the @xmath4-dimensional space ) . however",
    "a useful partition in basins of saddles ( that is local , i.e. allows us to associate a saddle point to each instantaneous configuration using only local information of the pes ) is still not available .",
    "a possible partition is that obtained using the pseudo - potential @xcite @xmath33 , associating to each instantaneous configuration during the molecular dynamics a minimum of @xmath12 :    _ instantaneous configuration @xmath34 minimum of @xmath12 _  .",
    "however , as already pointed out , the relation between all the minima of @xmath12 and saddles of @xmath0 is not one - to - one : absolute minima of @xmath12 ( with @xmath20 ) are all saddles of @xmath0    _ absolute minima of @xmath12 @xmath35 saddles of @xmath0 _  ,    but local minima ( with @xmath36 ) are inflection points of @xmath0 ( more precisely they are inflection points with the first derivative of @xmath0 of the same sign of the first derivative of the curvature in the inflection direction ) :    _ local minima of @xmath12 @xmath34 inflection points of @xmath0 _  .    in fig.s",
    "[ fig_pro_1 ] and [ fig_pro_2 ] examples of two possible one - dimensional profiles of @xmath0 and corresponding @xmath12 are shown as a function of a generic one - dimensional coordinate . in fig .",
    "[ fig_pro_1 ] the two absolute minima of @xmath12 correspond to two saddle points of @xmath0 ( in one dimension a minimum and a maximum ) .",
    "the arrows define the basins of attraction of minima of @xmath12 , and the boundaries of these basins are indicated with open symbols . in fig .",
    "[ fig_pro_2 ] the local minimum of @xmath12 corresponds to an inflection point of @xmath0 .     and @xmath12 along a given direction .",

    "the inflection point of @xmath0 corresponds to a local minimum of @xmath12 with @xmath37 .",
    "the arrows indicate the basins of attraction of the minima of @xmath12 . ]",
    "we note that at inflection points the eigenvalues of the hessian vanish , so in principle one can recognize them simply analyzing the eigenvalues of the hessian of @xmath0 . in a previous work @xcite we used this eigenvalues criterion ( choosing a threshold to discriminate inflection directions ) and we found that local minima of @xmath12 were found very rarely .",
    "a closer inspection , however , has revealed that , due to `` imperfect '' minimizations of @xmath12 , the eigenvalues associated to a point `` close '' ( due to the not perfect minimization ) to an inflection point were of the same order of magnitude of the eigenvalues associated to a saddle .",
    "refining the analysis of the minima of @xmath12 , we find that the number of points that are true saddles is very small ( about @xmath38% of the total ) , so almost all the minima of @xmath12 found are inflection points .",
    "however there is another interesting characteristic that has to be considered , the number of inflection directions ( number of zero eigenvalues of hessian , excluding the tranlations ) at the minima of @xmath12 : if this number is small one can think of the minima of @xmath12 as a `` quasi '' saddle point qsp , as they are _ true _ saddle points in the subspace orthogonal to the small number of inflection directions .",
    "one can conjecture that the properties of a qsp are very similar to that of a true saddle point associate to an instantaneous configuration ; however , a relationship between them has still to be proved . in the simulated mlj system",
    "the number of inflection directions @xmath39 with respect to the number of negative curvatures @xmath16 are reported in table [ table1 ] for the different investigated temperatures .",
    "the values of @xmath39 ( from @xmath38 to @xmath40 ) indicate that they correspond to few directions in the configuration space ; a small value that allows us to speak about qsp as good candidates to approximate the properties of the true saddle points .",
    "we note that the fraction @xmath41 is higher for the low temperature data ( where the quantity @xmath16 is small ) , evidencing how these points are more influenced by inflection directions . however , also in this case it is possible to estimate the error in the calculation of the order ( see fig .",

    "so , no matter if they are _ true _ or _ quasi _ saddle points , we are going to check if their properties are able to describe and to give a microscopic interpretation of the dynamic processes in the supercooled regime .",
    "we firstly analyze the temperature behavior of some quantities related to quasi saddle points , and compare them to the corresponding behavior of the same quantities calculated at instantaneous configurations and at inherent structures .    for each temperature ( ranging from @xmath31 to @xmath42 ) , we analyze @xmath43 independent equilibrium configurations . for each configuration",

    "the quantity @xmath15 shows a different behavior , decreasing gradually with temperature and approaching @xmath49 close to @xmath2 .",

    "we have then found a direct method to reject many negative eigenvalues ( corresponding to not diffusive directions ) of the hessian at the instantaneous configurations .",

    "the analysis of the pes has been very useful in the investigation of supercooled dynamics of simple model liquids . besides the two main approaches in the investigation of the pes , the instantaneous normal mode and inherent structures approaches , we have discussed an additional sampling of the pes explored during the dynamic evolution of the system in configuration space : it consists in the analysis of the minima of the square gradient of the potential energy , @xmath140 .",
    "the characteristics of these sampled points seem to have a very close relationship with the transport properties of the system .",
    "the main result we obtained is the characterization of the dynamic transition temperature @xmath2 as the temperature at which the behavior of quantities related to the minima of @xmath12 changes on character : more specifically the number of negative eigenvalues of the hessian at these points extrapolates to zero at @xmath2 .",
    "the minima of @xmath12 sampled at different temperatures appear to contain the relevant information about the diffusive directions and the process of minimization of @xmath12 eliminates the non - diffusive negative directions usually present at instantaneous configurations .",
    "recently , an interesting technique to evaluate the non - diffusive directions as been adopted in @xcite",
    ". in some previous works we called these points _ saddles _ , as the absolute minima of the function @xmath12 are true saddle points of @xmath0 .",
    "however , following doye and wales @xcite a closer inspection has revealed that very often the sampled minima during dynamic evolution are local minima of @xmath12 , that correspond to _ inflection _",
    "points of @xmath0 ( the energy profile along some normal mode directions at these points is an inflection direction ) .",
    "the fact that the number of inflection directions at a given local minimum of @xmath12 is small , allows us to think that the main properties of these points are determined by the saddle directions ( that give the value of the order , i.e. the number of negative curvatures ) . a further evidence of the relevance of the minima of @xmath12 is obtained analyzing the diffusivity .",
    "the temperature behavior of the number of negative curvatures is related to that of the diffusion coefficient , indicating a close relationship between them .",
    "it could be that the main information about the dynamic processes is in the saddle points and the relevant properties of the local minima of @xmath12 are good approximations of the properties of these _ true _ saddle points .",
    "but there is also the possibility that the _ true _ saddles are not so relevant in the description of the dynamics , at least not more relevant than points with inflection directions ( local minima of @xmath12 ) .",
    "all these findings lead to the following viewpoint about the supercooled dynamics : the relevant diffusion processes happen in a subspace of the total configuration space with dimension proportional to the number of saddle directions at the sampled minima of @xmath12 , and , due to the presence of these `` open '' directions , the relevant diffusive processes are not activated in energy . below @xmath2 things",
    "are different , as the number of negative directions at sampled minima of @xmath12 is vanishingly small , indicating that the system is with high probability in a basin of an inherent structure ( minimum of @xmath0 ) . in order to change basin and diffuse ,",
    "now the system has to find the `` good '' directions leading to other minima ( an _ entropic _ process , considering the whole @xmath4 dimensional space of the degrees of freedom , that could correspond to an _ energy activated _ process in a suitable @xmath1 dimensional subspace - with @xmath141 ) .",
    "another important result obtained refers to the structural organization of the pes , i.e. the relationship among the relevant points of it .",
    "a very simple structure of the pes emerges : saddles of order @xmath142 lie above saddles of order @xmath1 by a constant quantity @xmath77 and adjacent inherent structures are equally spaced in configuration space .",
    "the above observed regularities suggest the possible use of simplified models of the pes in order to capture relevant characteristics of the supercooled dynamics of liquids .",
    "the model we analyzed here is the trigonometric model , introduced by madan and keyes @xcite , a model of independent sinusoidal degrees of freedom .",
    "the behavior of the calculated diffusivity and saddle order seems to indicate that the model , despite the absence of cooperativity , is able to reproduce important aspects of liquid dynamics close to @xmath2 .",
    "the study of more complex and realistic pes models , with interactions among the degrees of freedom , is a interesting development of this kind of analysis .",
    "the reason for which we still use the word `` saddle '' deserves further clarifications . in our numerical experiments , although a few number of minima of @xmath12 are `` true '' saddles in a mathematical sense , most of the qsp found are `` almost '' saddles , in the sense that @xmath12 is almost zero numerically , and the number of inflection directions is very small .",
