    "an optically thick atomic sample can provide strong atom - photon coupling , but the sample must be prepared in such a way that the deleterious effects of linear absorption are mitigated . to date , most of the techniques that have been proposed to increase the atom - photon interaction strength ( _ e.g. _ , eit , cavity qed ) only rely on manipulating internal- or cavity - atomic states . by combining previously - used techniques with new approaches that use control of both internal and center - of - mass atomic states , novel methods for realizing enhanced nonlinear optical interactions",

    "furthermore , because these methods primarily involve center - of - mass atomic states , they are widely - applicable to a broad range of atomic species and less sensitive to optical and magnetic field inhomogeneities than quantum - interference - based schemes .    in this paper , we report on an approach that exploits the collective excitation of a spatially extended , optically thick sample of cold atoms . specifically , we focus on using a phenomenon known as recoil - induced resonance ( rir ) , which can be viewed in terms of raman transitions between the quantized momentum states of an atom @xcite . for a given pump - probe detuning",

    ". these cooling beams also act as the pump beams in the rir scheme , and have an effective rabi frequency of @xmath9 ( where @xmath10 mhz is the natural linewidth of the @xmath11 ) transition ) .",
    "the experiment is run in steady - state ( with the mot beams on ) , and all of the beams are typically detuned @xmath12 @xmath13 below the atomic resonance .",
    "this configuration enables the production of optical densities ( od ; @xmath14 ) of up to @xmath15 .",
    "we control the od by varying the detuning of the repump laser beam , which allows us to investigate rirs in both the low- and high - gain regimes .",
    "the probe beam used for rir spectroscopy is split off from the pump beam , which provides the phase coherence necessary for studying spectroscopically narrow , multiphoton resonances .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : setup ] a ) , the probe beam propagates along the long axis of the trap , with a polarization that is parallel to that of the counterpropagating pump beam ( _ i.e. _ , the @xmath16 configuration described in ref .",

    "we observe transient hysteretic phenomena that arise from both linear ( finite material response time ) and nonlinear ( population redistribution ) effects .",
    "the results of this study demonstrate that momentum - space hole - burning is possible because of the inhomogeneously - broadened nature of the rir , and that it persists for approximately 100 @xmath0s . by tailoring the atomic momentum distribution via coherent population redistribution mediated by rirs ,",

    "<S> we find that two distinct mechanisms govern the atomic dynamics : the finite , frequency - dependent atomic response time , and momentum - space population redistribution . at low input probe intensities , the residual doppler width of the atoms , combined with the finite atomic response time , </S>",
    "<S> result in a linear , transient hysteretic effect that modifies the locations , widths , and magnitudes of the resulting gain spectra depending on the sign of the scan chirp . </S>",
    "<S> when larger intensities ( _ i.e. _ , greater than a few @xmath0w/@xmath1 ) are incident on the atomic sample for several @xmath0s , hole - burning in the atomic sample s momentum distribution leads to a coherent population redistribution that persists for approximately 100 @xmath0s . </S>",
    "<S> we propose using rirs to engineer the atomic momentum distribution to enhance the nonlinear atom - photon coupling . </S>",
    "<S> we present a numerical model , and compare the calculated and experimental results to verify our interpretation . </S>"
