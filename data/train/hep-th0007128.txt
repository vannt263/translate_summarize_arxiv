    "there are two different ways of formulating renormalization group ( rg ) transformations : the first formulation @xcite , which we shall call the field theory method , relies on the fact that in a renormalizable field theory all physical quantities can be expressed in terms of a finite number of renormalized couplings which can be defined at an arbitrary scale @xmath2 . because the bare theory is defined without reference to @xmath2 , any change in the renormalized correlation functions in response to a variation of @xmath2 must be compensated by a corresponding change in the renormalized couplings , such that the bare correlation functions remain independent of @xmath2 .",
    "this relation is usually expressed in terms of a partial differential equation for the renormalized correlation functions , the callan - symanzik equation .",
    "the gell - mann - low @xmath0-functions describe how the renormalized couplings must depend on @xmath2 to guarantee that for fixed bare couplings the bare theory is independent of @xmath2 .    the other ,",
    "more modern formulation of the rg was pioneered by wilson @xcite . in this approach , which has been very fruitful in statistical physics and in condensed matter theory @xcite , one starts from a local bare action @xmath3 with some ultraviolet cutoff @xmath4 , and integrates out the degrees of freedom for momenta down to some smaller cutoff @xmath5 .",
    "after this elimination of the degrees of freedom , the momenta and in general also the fields have to be properly rescaled in order to obtain a fixed point of the rg @xcite . in this way",
    "one obtains an effective action with a new ultraviolet cutoff @xmath6 . in general , the new action is a very complicated non - local functional of the new fields .",
    "the wilsonian flow equations describe how the various couplings of the effective action change as the scale @xmath6 is reduced",
    ". an important advantage of the wilsonian rg over the field theory method is that the wilsonian method can also applied to non - renormalizable field theories .",
    "in fact , condensed matter systems are usually characterized by a finite lattice spacing , which plays the role of a physical ultraviolet cutoff .",
    "hence , there is no need to perform the continuum limit in condensed matter theory .    in the important work @xcite wegner and houghton showed that the change of the effective action due to an _ infinitesimal _",
    "change in @xmath6 can be described in terms of a formally exact functional differential equation . however , for practical calculations the wegner - houghton equation has some unpleasant features , so that it has not been widely used to solve problems of physical interest .",
    "recently , there has been a renewed interest in exact formulations of the wilsonian rg .",
    "polchinski @xcite noticed that a particular form of the exact wilsonian rg equation ( which is now called the polchinski equation , see sec .",
    "[ subsec : polchinski ] ) offers a straightforward approach to proof the renormalizability of quantum field theories .",
    "due to its intuitive physical interpretation and its greater generality , the wilsonian rg is the method of choice in condensed matter theory and statistical physics @xcite as long as a one - loop calculation is sufficient .",
    "in some problems , however , the correct behavior of physical observables requires the knowledge of the two - loop rg @xmath0-function .",
    "an example is the asymptotic low - temperature behavior of the susceptibility of classical @xcite and quantum @xcite heisenberg magnets in two dimensions .",
    "however , till now even condensed matter physicists resort to the less intuitive field theory method for two - loop calculations @xcite .",
    "in fact , the opinion seems to prevail that two - loop calculations within the exact wilsonian rg are more difficult than within the field theory method . in this work",
    "we shall show that this is not necessarily the case if one uses the irreducible version of the exact rg @xcite in the form derived by wetterich @xcite and , independently , by morris @xcite .",
    "we consider a simple scalar field theory with a bare action @xmath7 where the free part is @xmath8 here @xmath9 are the fourier components of a real scalar field @xmath10 in @xmath11 dimensions , and @xmath12 the interaction part @xmath13 may also contain counter terms that are quadratic in the fields .",
    "later we shall assume that it is a local function of the fields that is invariant under @xmath14 .",
    "the one - loop rg @xmath0-function for this theory has been derived some time ago from the polchinski equation @xcite by hughes and liu @xcite .",
    "several strategies for calculating the rg @xmath0-function at two loops have been proposed .",
    "a derivation of the two - loop @xmath0-function entirely within the framework of the exact rg was given by papenbrock and wetterich @xcite , who used the exact evolution equation for the effective average potential and worked with a smooth cutoff in momentum space . because sharp cutoffs in momentum space generate long - range interactions in real space , wilson and kogut @xcite recommended to use a smooth cutoff for calculations beyond one loop . on the other hand ,",
    "the one - loop @xmath0-function is most conveniently performed with the wilsonian rg using a sharp cutoff , so that it would be useful to have a formulation of the wilsonian rg where the same cutoff procedure can also be employed for higher order calculations .",
    "the precise relation between the orthodox field theory approach and the exact wilsonian rg was established by bonini _",
    "@xcite , who used this relation to obtain the @xmath0-function at the two - loop order .",
    "another strategy for calculating the two - loop @xmath0-function of @xmath15-theory was adopted pernici and raciti @xcite , who derived the gell - mann low equation from the exact rg , and then used this equation to express the @xmath0-function in terms of wilsonian green functions . in ref .",
    "@xcite an attempt has been made to calculate certain contributions to the two - loop coefficient of the @xmath0-function by truncating the functional differential equations of the exact rg within a momentum scale expansion ; unfortunately , this truncation is uncontrolled ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) and the result is not a good approximation to the known two - loop result obtained within the field theory method @xcite .",
    "very recently morris and tighe @xcite succeeded in calculating the two - loop @xmath0-function from the exact rg by resumming the momentum scale expansion for sharp cutoff and the derivative expansion for smooth cutoff to infinite orders . in this work we shall show how the two - loop @xmath0-function can be obtained directly within the framework of the exact wilsonian rg using a sharp cutoff in momentum space , without resumming the momentum scale expansion , and without any reference to the callan - symanzik equation .",
    "our motivation is to demonstrate that a two - loop calculation within the exact rg is conceptually quite simple and involves only straightforward albeit tedious algebra .",
    "our aim is to convince the reader that the exact rg is the most convenient method for performing two - loop rg calculations in condensed matter theory and statistical physics .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows : we begin in sec.[sec : different ] with a brief summary of the different versions of the exact wilsonian rg . in sec.[sec : rescaling ] we discuss the proper rescaling of momenta and fields in the exact rg . in sec.[sec : exact ] we explicitly write down the exact flow equations for the free energy , the irreducible two - point vertex , the irreducible four - point vertex , and the irreducible six - point vertex",
    ". we also elaborate on the relation between the anomalous dimension of the field and the irreducible two - point vertex . in sec.[sec : general ] we make some general remarks concerning the structure of the rg flow . in sec.[sec : oneloop ] we briefly re - derive the one - loop @xmath0-function .",
    "the two - loop calculation is then presented in sec.[sec : twoloop ] .",
    "our conclusions can be found in sec.[sec : conclusions ] . finally , in an appendix we briefly summarize the definition of various types of generating functionals and introduce some convenient notations .",
