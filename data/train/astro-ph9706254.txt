    "one of the most important recent discoveries in the field of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) is that flat spectrum radio sources ( blazars ) emit a substantial fraction , sometimes most of their power , at @xmath0ray energies .",
    "about 60 flat spectrum radio sources have been detected up to now above 100 mev by the energetic gamma ray experiment telescope ( egret ) onboard the compton gamma ray observatory ( cgro ) ( fichtel 1994 ; von montigny et al .",
    "1995 ; thompson et al .",
    "strong and rapid variability seems to be a common property of these sources in the @xmath0ray band ( e.g. von montigny et al . 1995 ) .",
    "the origin of this high energy emission is still unclear .",
    "a point of agreement is that the emitting plasma is in relativistic motion at small angles to the line of sight , with consequent beaming of the emitted radiation , which is required to avoid strong suppression of @xmath0rays due to photon  photon absorption ( mcbreen , 1979 ; for application to blazars see , e.g. , maraschi , ghisellini & celotti 1992 ; dondi & ghisellini 1995 ) .",
    "the correlated optical and @xmath0ray variability observed in some objects ( wagner et al .",
    "1995 , hartman et al .",
    "1996 ) indicates that the same population of electrons could be responsible for the flux in both bands , and suggests that the optical emission is due to the synchrotron process , while the @xmath0rays are produced by the inverse compton process between highly relativistic electrons and soft seed photons .",
    "however , the origin of the seed photons , the location and size of the emitting region(s ) , and the degree of relativistic beaming of the high energy radiation are unknown . according to one interpretation ,",
    "the seed photons can be produced by synchrotron emission internally to the emitting blob or jet ( maraschi , ghisellini & celotti 1992 ) .",
    "another possibility is that the blob itself could illuminate a portion of the broad line clouds , whose reprocessed line radiation can dominate the radiation energy density in the blob ( ghisellini & madau 1996 ) . in another scenario the seed photons",
    "are produced externally , by the accretion disk ( dermer & schlickeiser 1993 ) , by the broad line region illuminated by the disk ( sikora , begelman & rees 1994 ) , and/or by some scattering material surrounding the jet ( blandford 1993 , blandford & levinson 1995 ) .",
    "finally , a dusty torus could provide ir radiation to be scattered in the @xmath0ray band , as suggested by wagner et al .",
    "( 1995 ) .    for plausible values of the parameters , the relativistic electrons which emit @xmath0rays by the inverse compton process emit synchrotron photons in the ir ",
    "optical  uv range . as a consequence",
    ", the two emissions are expected to be strongly correlated .",
    "optical observations can therefore be crucial to understand the nature of @xmath0ray emission in blazars since they allow to derive information on both the seed photons and the radiating high energy electrons .",
    "renewed interest in optical monitoring is motivated also by the discovery that in the radio domain the flux of some blazars varies by 1030% on a timescale less than a day ( quirrenbach et al . 1992 ) .",
    "the inferred brightness temperature , of the order of @xmath4 k , poses severe difficulties to theoretical models , since it can not be reconciled with the compton limit of @xmath5 k for the commonly estimated values of the beaming factor ( see , e.g. blandford , 1990 ) .",
    "possible explanations are that these variations are due to regions with extremely high beaming or to coherent processes or that they are extrinsic , due to interstellar scintillation .",
    "simultaneous optical and radio monitoring is thus critical to discriminate different models .    in this paper",
    "we present the results of recent optical - uv observations of the bl lac object s5 0716 + 714 .",
    "this source is an ideal target for both the research fields outlined above , since it has been detected several times in the @xmath0-ray band and has shown intraday variability at optical and radio wavelengths ( wagner et al . 1996 ) .",

    "the outline of the paper is as follows : in sect .",
    "2 we review the available information on s5 0716 + 714 at all wavelengths ; in sects . 3 and 4 we describe and discuss the optical observations , taken from different sites and telescopes , and the uv observation obtained with iue simultaneously with the phase 4 egret pointing ; in sect .",
    "5 we model the overall emission spectrum with a homogeneous synchrotron self compton ( ssc ) model and with a relativistic inhomogeneous jet model . in sect .",
    "6 we draw our conclusions .",
    "s5 0716 + 714 was discovered in the bonn ",
    "nrao radio survey ( khr et al . 1981 ) of flat spectrum radio sources with a 5 ghz flux greater than 1 jy , and was identified as a bl lacertae object , because of the featureless spectrum , by biermann et al .",

    "the fr ii morphology conflicts with the suggestion that the parent population of bl lac objects should be fr i radiogalaxies ( see e.g. urry & padovani 1995 for a review ) but it is consistent with a more general  unified \" scheme whereby both fr i and fr ii radiogalaxies have similar relativistic jets in their cores ( maraschi & rovetti 1995 ) .",
    "a further  anomaly \" is that the observed ratio of the core to the extended radio flux , which is @xmath12 at 5 ghz and @xmath13 at 1.5 ghz ( perley , fomalont & johnston 1982 ) , is at the low extreme of the @xmath1distribution of the radio  selected bl lac objects ( see e.g. ghisellini et al .",
    "1993 and references therein ) .",
    "the radio core has an inverted spectrum [ @xmath14 between 1.5 and 5 ghz ; perley , fomalont & johnston 1980 ; @xmath15 the overall flat radio spectrum seems the result of the superposition of the core and more extended and steeper components ( see the decomposition of the radio spectrum in eckart et al .",
    "1986 ) , even if the intraday radio variability suggests that at least some of the radio emission may come from much smaller regions .",

    "( 1996 ) .    a simultaneous optical ( @xmath1 band ) and radio ( 5 ghz ) monitoring campaign , performed for a month ( february 1990 ) , suggested that the variations in the two bands were correlated , with amplitudes up to a factor 3 in the optical and 25% in the radio , and with typical timescales of 1 and 7 days in both bands ( wagner et al .",
    "1990 ; quirrenbach et al .",

    "photometry was carried out with several telescopes : the 1.05 m astrometric telescope of the observatory of torino ( b and r bands mainly ) , the 0.4 m automatic telescope of the university of perugia ( tosti , pascolini & fiorucci 1996 ) , the 0.5 m telescope of the astronomical station of vallinfreda , and the 0.4 m telescope of the ias  cnr at the observatory of monte porzio ( the last two operated by the rome group ) .",

    "the comparison among data obtained in the same nights with different telescopes yielded the same results within the errors , which are typically 0.02 mag in @xmath1 and 0.030.05 mag in @xmath2 .",
    "we did not find any published comparison sequence in the field of s5 0716 + 714 ; only one nearby star was calibrated by takalo , sillanp   & nilsson ( 1994 ) .",
    "we therefore calibrated some reference stars using several landolt s ( 1992 ) fields .",
    "the stars are indicated in the map of fig . 1 and the corresponding magnitudes are listed in table 1 ;",
    "quoted errors include the uncertainty on the absolute calibration , while magnitude differences between the reference stars in a given filter are good within 0.02 magnitudes .",

    "the reddening correction in the direction of s5 0716 + 714 was taken @xmath26 .",
    "it was derived from the @xmath27 value of @xmath28 @xmath21 ( ciliegi , bassani & caroli 1993 ) , in agreement with the best fit values of both uv and x  ray observations ( cappi et al .",

    "dense optical monitoring is a very powerful tool to better understand the radiation processes operating not only in the optical band , but also in the high energy part of the spectrum , and to put models for the @xmath0ray emission on test .    by themselves ,",
    "the optical data we have obtained for s5 0716 + 714 are indicative of a complex behaviour possibly characterized by more than one component .",
    "the dependence of the spectral index on the fast variations of the flux and its insensitivity to longer - term trends , suggest localized injections of energy in the form of fresh and rapidly cooling relativistic particles , superimposed to a steadier emission , possibly coming from larger regions .",
    "other constraints can be obtained by the shape of the fast flares , which seem symmetric and without plateau . in particular , this allows to derive a lower limit on the magnetic field strength .",
    "it is very interesting to verify if other sources behave like s5 0716 + 714 in this respect , to assess if this is a fundamental feature to be explained by emission models for blazars in general .",
    "indeed , some of the best monitored surces ( e.g. 3c 66a , takalo et al .",
    "1996 ; oj 287 , sillamp   et al . 1996",
    "; 0954 + 658 , wagner et al .",
    "1993 ; pks 2155304 , pian et al . 1997",
    "; pks 0422 + 004 , massaro et al .",
    "1996 ) , seem to confirm this behaviour .",
    "s5 0716 + 714 was very bright in the optical during the period of our observations , and in particular during the period of the egret pointing .",
    "since electrons radiating optical synchrotron photons would emit @xmath0rays by the inverse compton process , one inevitably predicts that the source had to be bright also in the egret band .",
    "the exact amount of the expected @xmath0ray emission is of course model ",
    "dependent ( this is the reason why simultaneous observations are so important ) , but we can restrict the existing possibilities by noting that the absence of emission lines in the s5 0716 + 714 spectrum makes inverse compton off photons produced @xmath32 to the jet less likely . for s5 0716 + 714 , a simple homogeneous and one  zone model is appropriate to describe the optical/@xmath0ray behaviour , because the regions emitting both these frequency bands are cospatial .",
    "this remains true in more realistic inhomogeneous models , which can better explain the entire electromagnetic output of the source , including the radio , far infrared , and x  ray bands .",
    "these models can be put on test by simultaneous monitoring in the above mentioned bands .",
    "in fact , a key ingredient of the inhomogenous jet model we used is that smaller jet regions , located at short distances from the jet apex , are responsible for the high energy steep tail of the x  ray synchrotron spectrum , while larger and outer regions mainly contribute to the radio  to  ir band by synchrotron , and to hard x  rays by self - compton emission .",
    "perturbances travelling along the jet could be mapped in the frequency space , with shorter variability timescales corresponding to higher synchrotron and inverse compton frequencies .",
    "in addition , there should be time delays in the light curves at different frequencies .",
    "if the seed photons to be upscattered in energy are local synchrotron photons , then we predict that s5 0716 + 714 should have reached , during the february 1995 egret observation , its brightest ever detected @xmath0ray state , with a flux a factor 310 higher than in the 1992 - 1993 egret observing periods .",
    "furthermore , the simple ssc models presented here assume that the bulk of the optical and @xmath0ray luminosities are produced in the same region , and therefore the flux in both bands should vary together , without delay . in particular , we observed a decline of the optical flux on a time scale of a few days , and we expect that a similar trend should also be found in the @xmath0-ray band if the statistical quality of the data is good enough . if the @xmath0ray emission is not linked with the decline of the bulk of the optical emission , one is still left with the interesting alternative that the @xmath0rays are connected with the optical fast flares . on the other hand , the absence of any optical@xmath0ray correlation would be a severe problem for all simple ssc models ."
