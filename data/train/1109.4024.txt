    "during the last twenty years the non - perturbative approach to the renormalization group ( rg ) originated by wilson  @xcite has been the subject of a revival in both statistical and quantum field theory .",
    "two main formulations of the non perturbative renormalization group ( nprg ) have been developed in parallel to study a system at equilibrium at , or near to , criticality ; for instance , in the simplest case , a system described , at microscopic scale @xmath6 ( in momentum scale ) , by an action @xmath7 $ ] where @xmath8 is a scalar field . in the first approach , one realizes a continuous rg transformation of the action @xmath9 $ ] from @xmath10 to @xmath11 and , _ a priori _ , no expansion with respect to whatsoever small parameter being required . at scale-@xmath12 ( in momentum space )",
    "the high energy modes @xmath13 , @xmath14 , are integrated out in the `` wilsonian '' action @xmath15 $ ] which is a functional of the slow modes @xmath13 , @xmath16 . this ",
    "coarse - graining  operation requires the implementation of some cut - off of the propagator , either sharp or soft , aiming at separating slow ( @xmath16 ) and fast ( @xmath17 ) modes .",
    "coarse - graining  process is devised in such a way that all the wilsonian actions @xmath15 $ ] yield the same physics in the infra - red ( ir ) limit ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "the flow of @xmath15 $ ] , from the microscopic scale @xmath10 to the macroscopic scale @xmath11 , is governed by the wilson - polchinski equation  @xcite in case of a smooth cut - off and the wegner - houghton  @xcite equation in case of a sharp cut - off .",
    "powerfull approximation schemes has been devised to obtain approximate , non - perturbative solutions of these equations ; for a review see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the second formulation , called the `` effective average action '' approach , was developed after the seminal works of nicoll , chang and stanley for the sharp cut - off version  @xcite and wetterich , ellwanger and morris for the smooth cut - off version  @xcite .",
    "this method implements on the effective average action @xmath19 $ ] - roughly speaking the gibbs free energy of the fast modes @xmath13 , @xmath20 of the classical field @xmath21 - rather than on the wilsonian action @xmath15 $ ] the ideas of integration of high - energy modes that underlies any rg approach .",
    "the flow of @xmath22 results in equations which can be solved under the same kind of non perturbative approximations than those used for the wilson - polchinski or wegner - houghton equations .",
    "the main advantage of this more recent formulation is that it gives access to the rg flow of physical quantities , i.e. the gibbs free energy @xmath19 $ ] and its field derivatives , the vertex functions , rather than to such an abstract object as the wilsonian action @xmath15 $ ] .",
    "quite remarkably , the same kind of formalism was developed in a less elaborated language by reatto _",
    "_ in the domain of the theory of classical liquids @xcite , many years before these recent contributions to statistical field theory .",
    "the relations between these corpora of works is discussed in ref .",
    "recent reviews and lectures devoted to wetterich s approach are available  @xcite and should be consulted for a thorough discussion .",
    "wetterich s version of the rg is in fact equivalent to that of wilson - polchinski as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in this paper",
    "we will adhere to wetterich point of view and focus on the study of approximate solutions of the nprg for a scalar field theory with @xmath0 symmetry , at a temperature @xmath23 below the critical temperature @xmath24 , i.e. in the `` ordered phase '' or `` two phase region '' . for @xmath25",
    "the system exhibits a spontaneous magnetization @xmath26 which can take any value in the interval @xmath27 with an equal probability in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "henceforth we shall reserve the name spontaneous magnetization for @xmath28 . as a result",
    "the susceptibility @xmath29 is infinite , or equivalently , the second derivative of the gibbs free energy with respect to the magnetization    @xmath30 in the ordered phase .",
    "the potential @xmath31 , strictly convex for @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) is affine for @xmath34 .",
    "the simplest non - perturbative version of the nprg , _",
    "i.e. _ the local potential approximation ( lpa ) , yields indeed a convex free energy with a plateau as noticed in refs  @xcite .",
    "however it has been discovered by reatto _",
    "_ that the analytic behavior of @xmath35 in the vicinity of @xmath36 depends strongly on the choice of cut - off and dimension @xmath37 . for a sharp cut - off ( and in @xmath38 ) , @xmath35 is a continuous function of @xmath39 , notably at @xmath36 , and thus @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "this is a serious flaw of the theory since obviously @xmath35 should be discontinuous at @xmath36 , _ i.e. _ vanishing identically in the two phase region with a jump to a finite positive value outside the two - phase region corresponding to a finite susceptibility .",
    "in other words one should have @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "however , with another choice of cut - off function proposed by litim @xcite , it was shown by parolla _",
    "_ in ref .",
    "@xcite that , at least in @xmath38 , @xmath35 exhibits the correct discontinuity at @xmath43 . in this work",
    "we extend these results to any kind of cut - off and dimensions @xmath37 of space and obtain the mathematical properties to be satisfied by the cut - off function to obtain the required discontinuity of the susceptibility at @xmath44 .",
    "the crux of the whole matter is that the rg flow of gibbs free energy stops in the ordered phase at some finite rg time and that the solutions of the rg flow can thus be obtained as asymptotic stationnary solutions for well chosen dimensionned functions the behavior of which gives insight on the region @xmath45 .",
    "these analytical results are then checked by numerical experiments in the case of a @xmath5 potential where the rg flow equations are solved with a new algorithm which generalizes that devised by bonanno and lacagnina  @xcite to any kind of cut - off .",
    "the idea is to solve the rg flow for the threshold function rather than for the potential itself , or one of its derivatives .",
    "the partial differential equation for the threshold function is of quasi - linear parabolic type ( rather than of non - linear parabolic type for the potential yielding huge numerical instabilities in the ordered phase ) and can thus be solved with an arbitrary high accuracy .",
    "the approach to convexity of the gibbs free energy is then achieved exactly with @xmath35 vanishing identically in the ordered phase , down to the smallest real available on your computer if wanted .",
    "solving rg flow equations for the threshold function above @xmath46 is also possible of course , but of less interest . a good numerical precision",
    "can therefore be achieved making possible to extract precise universal as well as non - universal quantities from numerical experiments .",
    "thorough numerical investigations have thus been undertaken with three different cut - off functions , _",
    "i.e. _ the sharp cut - off , litim s regulator and an exponential smooth cut - off , aiming _ inter alia _ at testing the theoretical predictions on the behavior of @xmath1 at @xmath2 ; a thorough comparison and discussion of the data provided by the different cut - off is also presented .",
    "this study is finally completed by solving the adimensionned flow equations asymptotically in the same vein as that used to solve the dimensionned equations , by solving the fixed point equations and the associated eigenvalue problem for the threshold functions rather than for the potential . fixed point functions and critical exponents are then obtained for the three cut - offs with a very high numerical precision , notably for the exponential smooth cut - off non considered up to now ; in the case of the sharp and litim s cut - off we recover the results obtained previously @xcite .    the paper is organized as follows ; in section  [ flow ] we summarize briefly wetterich formalism and the lpa approximation .",
    "the properties of the rg in the two - phase region are then explored in depth yielding the mathematical conditions to be fulfilled by the cut - off function in order to obtain the correct discontinuous behavior of @xmath35 at @xmath2 . in section  [ numeri ]",
    "we devise a new numerical algorithm in which a correct account of both initial and boundary conditions is given .",
    "this material is used to perform extensive numerical experiments aimed at testing the theoretical predictions of section  [ flow ] and at computing some universal and non - universal quantities of the @xmath5 potential .",
    "section  [ adim ] is devoted to a somehow new presentation and numerical study of the adimensionned flow equations .",
    "estimations of the critical exponents of the @xmath5 ( or ising ) @xmath47 model in the lpa and for three different cut - off are reported . in the case of litim s and sharp cut - off",
    "our results are in perfect agreement with those of ref.@xcite and in the case of the exponential smooth cut - off we provide the first high precision data for the even and odd spectrum of critical exponents . we conclude in section  [ conclu ]",
    "we consider a scalar field theory defined at scale @xmath6 by it s microscopic action @xmath48   =   \\int_{x } \\ , \\left\\ {   \\left (   \\vec{\\nabla } \\varphi_{x } \\right ) ^{2 } + v_{\\lambda } \\left(\\varphi_{x } \\right )   \\right\\ } \\",

    "below , for numerical applications , we shall restrict ourselves to the @xmath5 potential , i.e. a coarse - grained version of the ising model with @xmath57 ( @xmath58 ) , and will denote by @xmath59 the value of parameter @xmath60 at the critical point in the lpa approximation .",
    "finally it is understood that @xmath6 acts as an ultra - violet ( uv ) cut - off in integrals defined in fourier space , i.e. @xmath61 .",
    "following wetterich  @xcite we introduce a family of related @xmath12-models depending on an index @xmath12 in momentum space with @xmath62 . the bare action @xmath63 $ ] of the @xmath64model - not to be confused with the wilsonian action briefly alluded to in the introduction- is defined by @xmath65 = s_{\\lambda}\\left [ \\varphi\\right ]   + \\frac{1}{2 } \\varphi \\cdot \\mathcal{r}_{k } \\cdot \\varphi   \\ ; , \\ ] ] where @xmath66 is a massive term aimed at separating high and low energy field modes .",

    "\\varphi \\right )   \\ ; , \\ ] ] where the functional measure @xmath84 integrates over * all the field modes * @xmath13 ( @xmath85 ) and @xmath86 ( @xmath87 source ) . at scale",
    "`` k '' the slow modes @xmath13 , @xmath88 , are frozen by their mass @xmath89 and @xmath90 = \\log   z_k\\left[j \\right]$ ] can therefore be interpreted as the generator of the connected green s function with an ir cut - off .",

    "@xmath93 $ ] is the `` true '' gibbs free energy of the k - system .",
    "however it proves convenient to introduce and consider rather the * effective average action * of wetterich @xmath94 = \\overline{\\gamma}_{k}\\left [ \\phi \\right ] -\\dfrac{1}{2 } \\phi \\cdot \\mathcal{r}_{k } \\cdot \\phi \\ ; .\\ ] ] by contrast with @xmath95 $ ] this functional of the field @xmath96 is non - convex but has simple limits which follow from the mathematical properties of the cut - off function @xmath97  @xcite , _ i.e. _ :    * when @xmath98 no fluctuations has been integrated out . and",

    "* when @xmath100 all fluctuations have been integrated out and @xmath101 = \\gamma \\left[\\phi\\right]$ ] is the gibbs free energy of the model under study .",

    "the equation for @xmath111 $ ] is thus not closed .",
    "one has to resort to approximations to solve the flow .      a simple , non trivial way to tackle with eq .",
    "is to restrict the functional space to functionals of the form @xmath112=\\int_x \\left\\ { \\frac{1}{2 } ( \\vec{\\triangledown } \\phi_x ) ^{2 } + u_k(\\phi_x ) \\right\\ } \\ ; , \\ ] ] which constitutes the popular local potential approximation ( lpa ) . note that in this scheme there is no field - renormalization so that @xmath113 .",
    "we also stress that the * local potential * @xmath114 is a function of the local field @xmath115 at point @xmath50 , not a functional . combining eqs .   and one then obtains a closed partial differential equation ( pde ) for the @xmath116 which reads as @xmath117 where the potential @xmath118 is evaluated for a uniform magnetization @xmath119 and @xmath120 denotes its partial derivative with respect to @xmath39 .",
    "the pde  eq .   is non - linear but however quite easy to solve numerically above the critical point ( @xmath121 , in the case of the @xmath5 potential ) .",

[",
    "the ] and we need first to study its relevant analytical properties . for reasonable cut - off functions the two functions @xmath134 , and @xmath135 are positive for @xmath136 so that @xmath137 is a decreasing function of it s argument . in any reasonable case",
    "the function is defined on the interval @xmath138\\omega_0 , + \\infty [ $ ] where @xmath139 is the largest pole of the integrand in the r.h.s .",
    "( for any reasonable choices of the cut - off @xmath140 there is in general only a single pole ) .",
    "therefore @xmath137 decreases from @xmath123 to 0 when @xmath141 increases from @xmath139 to @xmath142 .",
    "finally note that @xmath143 is indeed a dimensionless quantity which gives sense to eq .  .",
    "before we tackle the general case let us consider two important cases .",
    "first , the ( ultra ) sharp cut - off defined by the regulator @xmath144 where the parameter @xmath145 . in that case one shows that @xmath146 @xcite , so that the flow equation reads as @xmath147    a second important case that we shall consider is litim s regulator @xmath148 which yields @xmath149 and the flow equation @xcite @xmath150    [ cols=\"<,>\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in this paper we attempted to make an exhaustive study of the properties of the @xmath5 model in the ordered phase in the framework of the nprg within the lpa approximation .",
    "we shown that the approach to the convexity is independent of the cut - off , but that fine details are strongly affected by the choice of the regulator , notably the analytical behavior of the inverse magnetic susceptibility @xmath151 at @xmath43 .",
    "we proved that the singularity of the threshold function @xmath133 about its largest pole ( or essential singularity ) @xmath139 governs the behavior of @xmath152 at @xmath43 ; if @xmath153   as @xmath154 then the inverse compressibility is discontinuous at @xmath2 ( as required on physical grounds ) only if the inequality @xmath155 holds .",
    "in particular litim s and any smooth cut - off yield a discontinuity of @xmath152 in dimension @xmath38 , while the sharp cut - off incorrectly predicts a continuous behavior and thus a merging of the spinodal and binodal curves .    we have confirmed these subtle properties of the solution below @xmath59 by extensive numerical experiments with the help of a new algorithm which solves the rg flow equations for the threshold functions rather than for the potential or one of its derivatives .",
    "the main advantage of the method is to replace the numerical resolution of a highly non linear pde which exhibits numerical instabilities in the ordered phase by that of a quasi - linear parabolic pde with good convergence properties .",
    "the  standard  version of the lpa retained in this work does not allow to compute the critical parameter @xmath59 of the model which depends strongly upon the choice of cut - off .",
    "the main reason is that the choice of the mf approximation as an initial condition for the rg flow is a too crude approximation .",
    "modified versions of the nprg  @xcite remedy to this flaw and yield a quite precise estimate for @xmath59 .",
    "however we noticed that , choosing as a new variable @xmath156 instead of @xmath60 , the thermodynamics of the lpa ( spontaneous magnetization , magnetic susceptibility ) for the @xmath157 potential is remarkably independent of the cut - off , except very close to the critical point .",
    "the latter merely shift @xmath59 to incorrect values .",
    "the numerical solution of the dimensionned rg flow equation does not yield a very precise estimate of the critical exponents either , probably because of small numerical errors in the resolution of the pde .    in order to compute precisely the critical exponents one must solve the linearized rg about the fisher fixed point .",
    "it can also be done for the threshold functions instead of the potential or its derivatives without any noticeable numerical differences but with the advantage of getting rid of some trivial solutions corresponding to redundant operators .",
    "the solution of the resulting fixed point equations and associated eigenvalue problems can be obtained with a high numerical precision with the help of a non - stiff solver like dopri853 @xcite for instance . since the ad originem problem is stiff , stiff integrators could be of some help however to reduce the integration step and should be tested .",
    "the author would like to thank personally c.  bervillier for enlightening e - mail correspondence , notably sec .",
    "[ trivial ] owes much to his remarks , and , collectively , all the members of the `` groupe de travail nprg '' of the lptmc ( jussieu , paris ) , directed and animated by g.  tarjus , for many discussions .",
