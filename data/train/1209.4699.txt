    "the main goals for palomar transient factory ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ptf , law  2009 ; rau  2009 ) ) include finding type ia and core collapse supernovae , discovering various rare transient events , as well as dedicated time domain study ( such as the ptf - orion project ) .",
    "the ptf employs a two - telescope approach at the palomar observatory : the p48 telescope serves as discovery and survey telescope , while the p60 telescope is used for multi - colors light curves follow - up of the discovered , or interesting , explosive transients .",
    "the p48 telescope is equipped with a wide field mosaic ccd imager for @xmath1 deg@xmath2 field - of - view ( fov ) , and observes in single band filter ( either @xmath3 , @xmath4 or @xmath5 ) .",
    "image subtraction techniques are used to find transients ( in real time ) from the images taken from p48 .",
    "about 80% and 50% of p48 and p60 time is allocated to ptf , respectively .",
    "other medium to large aperture telescopes within ptf network are also used for follow - up observations ( mainly spectroscopic ) , including p200 telescope , keck telescopes and others , for classification of transients discovered by ptf .",
    "even with a relatively large amount of telescopes time , only @xmath6% of the transients can be followed up ( see figure [ fig1 ] ) . to catch up with the ptf discovery rate",
    ", a new approach must be adopted  the sed machine is designed to observe most of the transients .",
    "sed machine ( for further details , see ( * ? ? ? * ben - ami  2012 ) ) is a low resolution integral field unit ( ifu ) spectrograph coupled with a rainbow camera ( rc ) , and it is planned to be installed at p60 in 2013 . the ifu spectrograph utilizes a lenslet array and a prism to produce @xmath7 spectra packed at ccd plane , each with resolution of @xmath0 .",
    "the rc is a large format ccd with different filters at 4 quadrants , in order to provide spectrophotometric calibration to within @xmath8% accuracy .",
    "how can the sed machine improve the classification efficiency ?",
    "study ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ben - ami  2012 ) ) has shown that spectral resolution of @xmath0 is adequate to classify most types of transients , hence allowing shorter exposure times at small aperture telescopes .",
    "the use of triple prisms permits a large wavelength coverage ( 370 to 920 nm ) and high throughput , and yet providing @xmath9constant spectral resolution .",
    "the acquisition and pointing efficiency can be improved by adopting lenslet - based ifu .",
    "the rc provides calibration efficiency for monitoring atmospheric extinction using a relatively large number of stars within its fov .",
    "finally , ccd detectors with high efficiency and low noise permit the observation and classification of @xmath10 transients per night .",
    "the sed machine is designed to be adopted for other 2 to 4 meter class telescopes , and not just on p60 .",
    "in addition to transients classification , sed machine may also be used for asteroid taxonomy study , galaxy clusers redshift determination , stellar principal parameters ( surface gravity , @xmath11 & @xmath12 $ ] ) estimation , and other science ."
