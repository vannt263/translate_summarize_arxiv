    "the galaxy j16021 + 3326 ( b1600 + 335 ) is classified as a gigahertz peaked spectrum ( gps ) radio source ( labiano et al .",
    "gps sources are so named due to their spectral energy distribution ( sed ) having a radio turnover frequency around 1 ghz .",
    "this class is principally composed of two types of sources : compact symmetric objects ( csos ) and core - jets ( e.g. , blazars ) .",
    "csos are dual - lobed sub - kiloparsec scale sources oriented close to the plane of the sky whose emission is dominated by the hotspots where their jets ram into the surrounding medium .",
    "the common opinion is that synchrotron self - absorption within the hotspots causes a spectral turnover around 1 ghz ( e.g. , de vries et al . 2009 ) , although free - free absorption has also been invoked ( e.g. , bicknell 2003 ) .",
    "core - jets can be classified as gps sources due to their highly variable sed ( tornikoski et al .",
    "2009 ) , or if by chance the emission is dominated by jet structures of the appropriate size to have a peak around 1 ghz ( scott & readhead 1977 ) .",
    "discriminating the reason a source is a gps typically requires multi - frequency imaging via very long baseline interferometery ( vlbi ) techniques , using instruments such as the very long baseline array ( vlba ) , to morphologically classify the source . in principle , long term sed variability studies could also be used to discern why a particular source is classified as a gps ( tornikoski et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "previous vlbi observations of j16021 + 3326 by kulkarni & romney ( 1990 ) and dallacasa et al .",
    "( 1995 ) were unable to disentangle the source structure well enough to explain why this is a gps source .",
    "after observations at 5 ghz in the vlba imaging and polarimetry survey ( vips , helmboldt et al .",
    "2007 ) , we decided to perform multi - wavelength followup with the vlba to clarify the nature of this source .    in this paper",
    ", we have adopted a redshift for j16021 + 3326 of 1.1 as per snellen et al .",
    "( 2000 ) & labiano et al .",
    "( 2007 ) . throughout this discussion , we assume h@xmath0=73 km s@xmath1 mpc@xmath1 , @xmath2 = 0.27 , @xmath3 = 0.73 , so 1 mas = 7.991 pc .",
    "multi - frequency observations of j16021 + 3326 were performed on february 19 , 2007 with the vlba , a summary of these observations is presented in table [ observations ] .",
    "these observations consisted of four 8 mhz wide ifs in the c , x and u bands with full polarization centered at : 4605.5 , 4675.5 , 4990.5 , 5091.5 , 8106.0 , 8176.0 , 8491.0 , 8590.0 , 14902.5 , 14910.5 , 15356.5 and 15364.5 mhz at an aggregate bit rate of 256 mbps to maximize ( @xmath4,@xmath5 ) coverage and sensitivity .",
    "when the data in each band were combined , the three central frequencies were : 4844.7 , 8344.7 , and 15137.5 mhz .",
    "the integrations were performed in blocks ( @xmath62 minutes for 5 and 8 ghz , @xmath67.5 minutes for 15 ghz ) and these blocks were spread out over a 10 hour period to maximize ( @xmath4,@xmath5 ) coverage of the source .",
    "most of the calibration and initial imaging of the data were carried out by automated aips @xcite and difmap @xcite scripts similar to those used in reducing the vips 5 ghz survey data @xcite . to summarize ,",
    "flagging of bad data and calibration were performed using the vlba data calibration pipeline @xcite , while imaging was performed using difmap scripts described in @xcite .",
    "final imaging was performed manually using the difmap program , with beam sizes of @xmath7 mas in position angle -31.86@xmath8 , @xmath9 mas in position angle -32.85@xmath8 and @xmath10 mas in position angle -29.68@xmath8 for 5 , 8 and 15 ghz respectively . for polarimetry purposes , the lower two and upper two ifs in each band",
    "were paired and imaged .",
    "j16021 + 3326 has also been observed regularly at 15  ghz with the 40  m telescope at the owens valley radio observatory ( ovro ) since mid-2007 as part of an ongoing candidate gamma - ray blazar monitoring program .",
    "this program monitors all 1158 sources with declination greater than 20@xmath8 in the cgrabs sample ( healey et al . , 2008 ) at least twice per week when weather conditions permit .",
    "the cgrabs sample consists of radio sources selected as likely to be active gamma - ray emitters based on their flat radio spectra and x - ray fluxes .",
    "cgrabs sources are predominantly known blazars , but also include a few other types . j16021 +",
    "3326 is identified as a narrow - line radio galaxy in the cgrabs catalog .",
    "the ovro 15  ghz flux densities of j16021 + 3326 were measured using azimuth double switching as described in readhead et al .",
    "( 1989 ) . the relative uncertainties in flux density result from a 5  mjy typical thermal uncertainty in quadrature with a 1.4% to 2% non - thermal random error contribution .",
    "the absolute flux density scale is calibrated to about 5% using the baars et al .",
    "model for 3c  286 ( baars et al . , 1977 ) .",
    "this absolute uncertainty is not included in the plotted errors .",
    "in addition to several interruptions in the monitoring program due to hardware failures , j16021 + 3326 was one of a subset of the sample affected by an unreliable pointing procedure during the period mjd  5475054908 which resulted in spurious fluctuations in the measured flux densities .",
    "all the potentially significant fluctuations in this period were closely correlated with similar fluctuations in other unrelated sources , suggesting the intrinsic flux density of j16021 + 3326 was relatively constant during this interval .",
    "an optical r - band observation of j16021 + 3326 was also performed , using five 300 second exposures with the palomar 200 \" telescope in july 2008 .",
    "figures [ images ] and [ zoom ] show the 5 , 8 , and 15 ghz vlba images made from the 2007 february observations of j16021 + 3326 . in figure [ images ]",
    "all three images have been convolved with identical beams , both to enable simpler comparison between the maps and to highlight the detected diffuse emission at 15 ghz . the scale of fig .",
    "[ zoom ] was chosen to focus on the structure surrounding the phase - center .",
    "all three images in fig . [ zoom ]",
    "are displayed at their natural resolutions to better show the complicated small - scale structure .",
    "self - calibration was utilized when reducing these data , so all absolute positions are lost since the brightest emission was placed at the phase center .",
    "the 5 ghz images reveal a northern elongation ( b ) coming from the phase center ( a ) , and more diminished spurs towards the east ( d ) and southwest ( e ) .",
    "diffuse emission is seen @xmath6 40 mas to the east ( f ) , as well as surrounding the southwest spur ( e ) . in the 8 ghz image",
    "the diffuse emission is much less prominent but components a , b , c & d are all still easily identifiable , although the southwest spur ( c ) has resolved into a ring . at 15 ghz ,",
    "the brightest component ( a ) has resolved into two distinct components ( a1 , a2 ) and the diffuse eastern emission ( f ) has almost completely disappeared .",
    "the eastern spur ( d ) is barely detected , and the southwestern spur ( c ) has marginally retained its ring - like structure .",
    "the r - band images obtained by the palomar 200 `` ( fig .",
    "[ optical ] ) show a faint ( 1.4 @xmath11jy integrated over a 3.6 '' aperture , for an absolute magnitude of 21.0 ) galaxy with evidence of a disturbed morphology , which is consistent with previous optical observations by stickel & kuhr ( 1996 ) .",
    "the 8 and 15 ghz images were matched in resolution in order to obtain a spectral index distribution across the source , where we take @xmath12 , which was overlaid onto 5 ghz contours to highlight the placement of the distribution within the source structure ( fig .",
    "[ spix ] ) . averaged spectral indices for components a1 , a2 , b , c , d and f and can be found in table [ spectralindex ] . in summary ,",
    "the only component exhibiting a flat - spectrum ( i.e. , an @xmath13 ) is a2 .",
    "polarization was detected at both 8 and 15 ghz with up to @xmath14 and @xmath15 polarization respectively .",
    "figure [ upol ] , showing the polarized flux from the if pair centered at 15.3605 ghz , provides an example of the polarization maps obtained .",
    "components a , b , c and d all exhibit polarization in the four if pairs , although the pair centered at 14.9065 ghz detected significantly less polarization the reason for which is unknown .",
    "the three if pairs that detected stronger polarization were used to compute rotation measures ( @xmath16s ) across the source ( fig .",
    "[ rm ] ) wherever polarization was detected at all three pairs by fitting the change in polarization angle ( @xmath17 ) to @xmath18 , with values ranging from -984 to 1426 rad m@xmath19 .",
    "the @xmath16 is dependent on the magnetic field strength ( @xmath20 ) and the electron number density ( @xmath21 ) by : @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the charge and mass of the electron and @xmath25 is the speed of light .",
    "these rotation measures were then used to calculate the magnetic field polarization angle corrected for faraday rotation ( fig [ rm ] inset ) .",
    "it is worth noting that the @xmath16 changes sign across a1 , which is indicative of a reversal of the magnetic field as seen in the above equation .",
    "the ovro 15  ghz light curve for j16021 + 3326 is shown in figure  [ var ] , along with scaled and offset light curves for the bright , constant - flux sources 3c  48 , 3c  286 , and dr  21 for reference .",
    "the median flux density of j16021 + 3326 is 858  mjy and the root mean square ( rms ) is 36  mjy , or 4.2% of the median .",
    "the rms fluctuations of 3c  48 , 3c  286 , and dr  21 are 1.7% , 1.3% , and 1.2% of the median flux density , respectively .",
    "the peak - to - peak variation is 133  mjy , or 15.5% of the median.we conclude that the variation in flux density of j16021 + 3326 results from actual source variations rather than systematic instrumental fluctuations",
    ". these observed fluctuations are consistent with the variability of the flux density ( up to 60% peak - to - peak at 5 ghz over a 6 year period ) noted by dallacasa et al .",
    "the unresolved , flat - spectrum ( @xmath26 ) , unpolarized component seen in fig . [ spix ] corresponds with a2 ( fig . [ zoom ] ) , and is consistent with the emission from the base of the radio - jet , commonly referred to as the core ( begelman et al .",
    "the remainder of the emission surrounding the core ( a1 , b , c , d , e , and f ) all exhibit steeper spectra ( @xmath27 to @xmath28 ) and are consistent with the identification of these components as jets or hot spots .      taken alone",
    ", the components a1 , a2 , and b look very much like a cso , in which the core feeds into two symmetric lobes to the north and south .",
    "however , this scenario does not readily explain the remaining components , with the positions of d and f being particularly difficult to reconcile .",
    "this source also does nt resemble a simple core - jet since there are extended components all around the core .",
    "clearly , imaging alone is not enough to determine the proper classification of this complicated source .",
    "the ovro variability data argue against j16021 + 3326 being a cso . since the jets associated with csos are oriented close to the plane of the sky there is little to no relativistic beaming of their emission expected and the emission is dominated by the extended hotspots where the jets terminate .",
    "the flux densities of 5 csos were observed to fluctuate over an 8 month period with an average rms of 0.7% ( fassnacht & taylor 2001 ) , while the two core - jet sources observed over the same period had an average rms of 3% .",
    "therefore , the observed variability of this source , 15.5% peak - to - peak and 4.2% rms over a 2 year period , strongly supports the blazar scenario .",
    "lastly , the polarization data also argue against j16021 + 3326 being a cso .",
    "since the jets of csos are oriented close to the plane of the sky , and are on the size scale of 10s of parsecs they should be viewed through the torus according to agn unification models ( antonucci 1993 ) .",
    "this torus can act as a faraday screen , thus depolarizing the synchrotron radiation as it leaves the galaxy ( peck & taylor 2000 ; gugliucci et al .",
    "very few csos have been observed to be polarized , and those that are only exhibit polarization in the oncoming jet .",
    "since we observe polarized flux all around the core of this source , it is unlikely to be a cso .",
    "the derived rms also lie within the typical blazar range of 500 to several thousand rad m@xmath19 ( zavala & taylor 2004 ) .",
    "while there seems to be plenty of evidence of the blazar nature of j16021 + 3326 , it is far from a conventional member of the class .",
    "typically , one would expect to see a one sided jet coming out of the core , while in this case there appears to be jet emission all around the core .",
    "precession , observed in other radio sources ( e.g. , ss 433 ; dubner et al .",
    "1998 ) , provides a simple explanation for this unconventional morphology from a blazar .",
    "if the jet is directed exceptionally close to the line of sight , any precession would make the jet appear to spiral around the core instead of producing the more familiar core - jet morphology typically exhibited by blazars .",
    "the structure observed in j16021 + 3326 ( fig .",
    "[ images ] ) is consistent with knots moving along a spiraling jet and/or foreground hotspot projection .",
    "j16021 + 3326 does display two non - blazar - like characteristics since it both appears to lack broad - line emission and it is optically extended ( i.e. , not a core dominated optical quasar ) .",
    "the first of these appears to be a non - issue since the spectral classification is not well supported in the literature , and yields a second reason a spectrum of this source should be observed and published in the future .",
    "as far as the optical classification , there are other examples of sources optically classified as galaxies exhibiting blazar like behavior in the radio ( e.g. , 3c 111 which exhibits superluminal motion and high variability ; cohen et al .",
    "it is possible this source is obscured by dust in the optical , but unaffected at radio wavelengths .",
    "analysis of multi - frequency ( 5 , 8 , and 15 ghz ) vlba data show a compact , flat - spectrum ( @xmath29 -0.05 ) component that we identify as the core of j16021 + 3326 surrounded by steeper - spectrum ( @xmath29 -0.5 to -1.0 ) polarized regions of emission .",
    "also , data from the ovro candidate gamma - ray blazar monitoring program reveal a relatively high level of variability ( 15.5% peak - to - peak and 4.2% rms over a two year period ) .",
    "this evidence , coupled with the detection of polarization in most components other than the core , indicate that j16021 + 3326 is a blazar .",
    "the peculiar structure observed is possibly due to the jet , presumably pointed close to the line of sight , precessing around and tracing out a spiral on the sky ."
