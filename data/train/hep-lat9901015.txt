    "continuum gauge field theory works under the assumption that all fields are smooth functions of space  time .",

    "continuum derivatives are replaced by finite differences and the concept of smoothness of gauge fields does not apply . any lattice gauge field configuration , @xmath8 can be deformed to the trivial gauge field configuration by the interpolation @xmath9 with @xmath10 and @xmath11 . since smoothness does not hold on the lattice away from the continuum limit , the space of gauge fields on the lattice forms a simply connected space .",
    "separation of the gauge field space into an infinite number of disconnected pieces can only be realized in the continuum limit .    in this paper",
    ", we will address the following basic question : do we see a separation of lattice gauge fields configurations into topological classes as we approach the continuum limit ? to answer this question , we will use several ensembles of lattice gauge field configurations obtained from pure su(2 ) and su(3 ) gauge field theory .",

    "_    we will show that numerical studies of the spectral flow on various ensembles favor the last scenario . before we do that , we present a topological argument which will show that zero eigenvalues of @xmath34 can occur anywhere in the region @xmath45  @xcite",
    ". the spectrum of @xmath34 and @xmath46 are identical for an arbitrary gauge field background .",
    "since zero eigenvalues can occur only for @xmath47 in @xmath34 , it follows that zero eigenvalues can occur only in the region @xmath45 .",
    "it also follows that every level crossing zero from above in the spectral flow of @xmath34 must be accompanied by a level crossing zero from below . in a single instanton background",
    "a level crossing zero from above at @xmath48 is accompanied by another level crossing zero from below at @xmath49 .",

    "the spectral flow changes smoothly as the configuration is changed slowly . as we move in configuration space the topological charge of a configuration changes . tracing the spectral flow as a function of configurations shows that zero eigenvalues of @xmath34 can occur anywhere in the region @xmath45 .",
    "in the previous section , we argued that @xmath34 can have zero crossings anywhere in the region @xmath58 .",
    "therefore the spectral gap is zero in this region on the lattice .",
    "this has direct implications for how the spectral density at zero behaves on the lattice .",
    "a careful study of the spectral density at zero has been performed on a variety of su(3 ) pure gauge ensembles .",

    "this shows that the last scenario presented in the previous section is favored by our numerical results .",

    "in addition to studying @xmath2 , we also looked at the density of levels crossing zero in an infinitesimal range @xmath66 centered at @xmath21 . in the continuum",

    "the overlap formalism for constructing a chiral gauge theory on the lattice  @xcite provides a natural definition of the index , @xmath67 , of the associated chiral dirac operator .",
    "the index is equal to half the difference of negative and positive eigenvalues of the hermitian wilson  dirac operator . a simple way to compute the index",

    "the net number at some @xmath68 is the index of the overlap chiral dirac operator . since crossings occur for all values of @xmath21 in the range @xmath58 , the topological charge of a lattice gauge field configuration defined as the net level crossings in @xmath34 in the range @xmath69 $ ] will depend on @xmath68 .",
    "the topology of a single lattice gauge field configuration is not interesting in a field theoretic sense .",

    ". we should emphasize that we look only at the sizes of eigenmodes that cross , and only close to the crossing point . only then",
    "can we expect to get a good estimate of the localization size inspired by the t hooft zero mode .",
    "the modes are large near @xmath60 where @xmath2 is large , then @xmath72 drops sharply to about @xmath79 or @xmath56 lattice spacings and stays there up to @xmath80 .",
    "we see that the corresponding topological susceptibility rises sharply when @xmath72 is large for @xmath21 near @xmath60 and then it is quite stable when @xmath72 is small .",
    "this result shows that while the index , @xmath67 , of the field is @xmath21 dependent , the topological susceptibility , @xmath81 ( a physical quantity ) is independent of the contribution from the small modes for @xmath82 .",

    "the topological susceptibility , @xmath81 , here defined by the contribution of zero modes of size @xmath83 and larger , is stable when @xmath84 .",
    "hence , the small modes do not affect the estimate of @xmath81 even though there is an abundance of such modes .",

    "studies in smooth gauge field backgrounds on the lattice have shown that single instantons result in a single level crossing zero at some @xmath21 in the region @xmath88 $ ] where the shape of the mode at the crossing is a good representation of the shape of the instanton  @xcite .",
    "similarly , there is a pair of levels crossing zero ( one from above and another from below ) when the gauge field background has an instanton and anti - instanton .",
    "again , the shape of the modes at the crossing points are good representations of the instanton and anti - instanton .",
    "this motivates us to look at the size distribution of the zero modes of the hermitian wilson - dirac operator on the lattice .",
    "since lattice gauge fields generated in typical monte carlo simulations are rough , the correspondence between zero modes and topological objects might be questionable  the existence of topological objects ( a collection of instantons and anti - instantons ) `` underneath '' the typically large quantum fluctuations is somewhat questionable as well .",
    "however , levels crossing zero contribute to the global topology and an analysis of the size distribution of the zero modes is therefore interesting .",
    "such size distributions are shown in figure  [ dn_su2 ] for gauge group su(2 ) .",
    "all distributions show a sharp rise at small sizes due to the abundance of small zero modes that occur in the bulk of the region @xmath58 .",
    "these modes do not affect the computation of the topological susceptibility and can be viewed as being due to the ultra - violet fluctuations in the gauge field background .",
    "if we eliminate the small modes from the distribution , the size distribution at @xmath89 on the @xmath90 lattice shows some evidence for a broad peak around @xmath91 fm .",
    "one should keep in mind that the box size is roughly @xmath92 fm and the peak is occurring at a value which is roughly a third of the box .",
    "it is tempting to explain this peak as a finite volume effect .",
    "some support for this explanation is provided by looking at the distributions at @xmath93 and @xmath94 on a @xmath90 lattice .",
    "these boxes are now roughly @xmath95 fm and @xmath96 fm , respectively . after discarding the small zero modes , both the distributions show a broad peak at roughly @xmath97 fm and @xmath98 fm , respectively . as in the @xmath89 case",
    "these peaks occur at roughly a third of the box size and the magnitude of the peak is larger as one goes to weaker coupling for a fixed lattice volume .",
    "this is quite consistent with the peak being a finite volume effect . in fig .",
    "[ dn_su2_rho ] we show all the su(2 ) size distributions together plotted in lattice units .",
    "there is evidence for a broad peak at roughly @xmath99 lattice units ",
    "roughly a third of the lattice box size .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the size distribution of zero modes does not show evidence for a peak at a physical scale even after we remove the small modes which are most likely lattice artifacts .",
    "we have to conclude that it is not possible to relate the size analysis of the zero modes carried out here to a size distribution of topological objects as it is postulated for the instanton liquid model of qcd  @xcite .",
    "= 5 in    = 4 in    the conclusions remain the same for the various su(3 ) ensembles that we studied .",
    "the size distributions are plotted in figure  [ dn_su3 ] .",
    "the @xmath100 ensembles come from lattices with linear extent roughly equal to @xmath101 fm , @xmath102 fm and @xmath103 fm , respectively .",
    "clearly the size distribution on the @xmath104 ensemble suffers strongly from finite volume effects whereas the @xmath70 ensemble is not affected as much",
    ". we should remark that we do not see any evidence for a finite volume effect in the computation of the topological susceptibility .",
    "this is probably because the size distribution of the individual zero modes is not that relevant for the global topology which only depends in principle on the net number of level crossings and not on the size and shape of these crossing modes .",
    "a probe of pure lattice gauge field ensembles using wilson fermions has revealed that the gauge fields are not continuum like on the lattice at gauge couplings that are typically considered to be weak .",
    "if they were continuum like , we should have seen evidence that @xmath2 is non - zero at a single value of @xmath21 or in a region in @xmath21 that is of the order of the lattice spacing .",
    "furthermore , we should have seen a symmetry in the spectrum at values of @xmath21 on either side of the point ( or region ) where @xmath2 is non - zero .",
    "instead , we found that @xmath2 is non - zero in a region @xmath58 . in the continuum limit",
    ", there is evidence that @xmath60 goes to zero and that @xmath2 goes to zero away from @xmath25 .",
    "however , the spectral distribution does not show evidence for a symmetry as @xmath105 .",
    "a remark on the approach of @xmath2 to the thermodynamic limit at a fixed lattice gauge coupling is in order . for a small lattice , with linear size of the order of the extent @xmath106 for which the finite temperature deconfinement transition occurs at the given gauge coupling",
    ", the number of very small eigenvalues of the wilson - dirac operator will be essentially zero .",
    "when the lattice size is increased this number will grow rapidly , leading , for a while , to a rapid increase in the extracted estimate of @xmath2 and then leveling off at the infinite volume value of @xmath2 .",
    "we found that this happens for a linear size about twice the extent @xmath106 mentioned above .",

    "dirac operator is in accordance with the behavior of @xmath2 . in spite of a large number of levels crossing zero in the bulk of @xmath58",
    ", we found that the topological susceptibility is unchanged by these small localized modes .",
    "we therefore interpret them as due to ultra - violet fluctuations .",
    "the size distribution of the zero modes is dominated by these small modes . however , the distribution , after we remove these small modes , does not show any clear peak at a physical scale .",
    "some broad peaks we see in are explained as a consequence of finite volume effects .",
    "we finally remark that all our studies in this paper have been on pure gauge field ensembles .",
    "there is a prediction for the spectral distribution of the wilson - dirac operator in full qcd using a continuum chiral lagrangian  @xcite .",
    "the prediction resembles the second scenario presented in section ii and is qualitatively different from the result we have obtained for pure gauge ensembles .",
    "it would be interesting to test this prediction by numerical simulations of full qcd with wilson fermions in the supercritical region .",
    "there is , however , a technical problem in using standard hybrid monte carlo type algorithms for such simulations : the system will be locked in a single topological sector ( with topology defined as half the difference of negative and positive eigenvalues of the hermitian wilson - dirac operator at the supercritical mass , @xmath108 , where the simulation is carried out ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that a change in topology will require a change of net level crossings in the region @xmath109 .",
    "however , the spectral flow has to be smooth as we update the configurations using classical dynamics in hmc type algorithms .",
    "therefore , at some point in the change of topology the level crossing would need to occur at @xmath108 , but such a configuration has a vanishing fermion determinant and hence can not be reached .",
