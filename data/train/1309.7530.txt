    "in two recent papers @xcite we showed how two of the exceptional four - dimensional regular polytopes , the 24-cell and the 600-cell , can be used to give a large number of  parity proofs \" of the kochen - specker ( ks ) theorem @xcite ruling out the existence of noncontextual hidden variables theories . in this paper",
    "we show how the third and most complex of these polytopes , the 120-cell , yields still further proofs of the same kind .",
    "thus our three papers collectively show how these beautiful geometric objects , which have been known since the middle of the 19th century , can be enlisted , if a bit quixotically , in defending the quantum theory against an attack mounted on it by a personage no less than einstein .",
    "+ the parity proofs based on the 24-cell have their origin in the proofs of the ks theorem given by peres @xcite and mermin @xcite .",
    "mermin s proof was based on sets of commuting observables for a pair of qubits , while peres proof was based on a set of 24 states derived from these observables .",
    "kernaghan @xcite later showed that peres states contain subsets of 20 that give parity proofs , and cabello et al @xcite showed that there are subsets of 18 that do likewise .",
    "one of us @xcite pointed out that the 24-cell , together with its dual , is the natural geometric framework for the system of rays introduced by peres .",
    "the interest of this observation is that it permits a simple geometrical construction to be given @xcite of all the @xmath0 parity proofs in this system .",
    "an exhaustive study of all the ks sets of vectors in the 24-ray peres set , whether they gave rise to parity proofs or not , has been carried out by pavii and his collaborators @xcite .",
    "+ the fact that the 24-cell , together with its dual , led to parity proofs suggested that the other four - dimensional regular polytopes might do likewise .",
    "the three simpler polytopes ( the simplex , the cross polytope and the measure polytope ) are too meager to lead to anything , but in @xcite we found , to our great surprise , that the 600-cell has a staggeringly large number of parity proofs in it .",
    "it should be stressed that while the 600-cell does have twenty five 24-cells in it , none of them is accompanied by its dual , and so there is no overlap between its parity proofs and those of the peres set .",
    "the contrast between the parity proofs in these two systems is very striking : whereas the peres rays have only six distinct ( i.e. unitarily inequivalent ) types of parity proofs ( and a total of 512 proofs when all their replicas under symmetry are taken into account ) , the 600-cell has over a hundred distinct types of proofs ( and over a hundred million when all replicas under symmetry are taken into account ) . + we were naturally led to ask whether the 120-cell , the most complex of these polytopes , might have any parity proofs in it .",
    "the 120-cell is remarkable in having copies of all the smaller polytopes in it .",
    "in particular , it has 10 600-cells and 225 24-cells in it .",
    "however none of the 24-cells is accompanied by its dual , and so none of the parity proofs of the peres set is contained in the 120-cell .",
    "but all the parity proofs of the 600-cell are contained in the 120-cell ( in 10 different incarnations , in fact ) .",
    "the question , then , is whether the 120-cell has any _ new _ parity proofs in it , i.e. , ones that span two or more of its 600-cells .",
    "it was far from obvious to us that it should have any proofs of this kind .",
    "however we have discovered that it does , and it is the purpose of this paper to report that discovery .",
    "+ the parity proofs provided by the four - dimensional regular polytopes all involve rays in a real four - dimensional space ( which is , in fact , the simplest setting in which parity proofs can arise ) .",
    "let us recall the other types of spaces in which parity proofs have been found .",
    "kernaghan and peres @xcite found a 36-ray 11-basis proof in a real 8-dimensional space which , together with the proofs in the peres set @xcite , were the only parity proofs known for many years .",
    "then , a few years back , there was an explosion in our knowledge .",
    "it was shown @xcite that there exist parity proofs in every complex space @xmath1 of dimension @xmath2 ( for @xmath3 ) that can be derived from suitable subsets of observables of the @xmath4-qubit pauli group .",
    "this showed that parity proofs are not singular phenomena but occur systematically in the state space of any number of qubits , with the variety and quantity of such proofs increasing sharply with the number of qubits .",
    "very recently , a completely unexpected discovery was made : lisonek et al @xcite found a 21-ray 7-basis proof in a complex 6-dimensional space that is remarkable because it involves the smallest number of bases ( seven ) known for a parity proof in any dimension and also because it is the first parity proof to be discovered in a dimension not of the form @xmath5 .",
    "this discovery seems to hint at the fact that there may still be things about parity proofs that we do not know .",
    "+ the parity proofs of this paper , like the others that have preceded them , are of interest for a variety of reasons : they can be used to derive state - independent inequalities for ruling out noncontextuality @xcite and bell inequalities for identifying fully nonlocal correlations @xcite ; they have applications to quantum games @xcite , quantum zero - error communication @xcite , quantum error correction @xcite and the design of relational databases @xcite ; and they can be used to witness the dimension of quantum systems @xcite .",
    "+ the plan of this paper is as follows . in sec.[sec:2 ] we give a simple construction of the rays and bases of the 120-cell based on its symmetries . in sec.[sec:3 ] we review the notion of a parity proof and identify substructures within the 120-cell that are more easily searched for such proofs .",
    "we then list the various types of proofs we have found , in terms of their symbols ( defined below ) , and give explicit examples of a few of the proofs . finally , in sec.[sec:4 ] , we make some concluding remarks .",
    "the 120-cell @xcite has 600 vertices distributed symmetrically on the surface of a sphere in four - dimensional euclidean space .",
    "the vertices come in antipodal pairs , and the lines through antipodal pairs of vertices define the 300 rays of the 120-cell .",
    "we will term any set of four mutually orthogonal rays ( or directions ) a basis .",
    "the 300 rays form 675 bases , with each ray occurring in 9 bases and being orthogonal to its 27 distinct companions in these bases and to no other rays .",
    "we will use the symbol @xmath6-@xmath7 to denote this system of rays and bases , with the left half of the symbol indicating the number of rays ( with their multiplicities as subscripts ) and the right half the number of bases ( with the number of rays in each basis as a subscript ) .",
    "we will use a similar notation for the other ray - bases systems that will be encountered below .",
    "for example , @xmath8-@xmath9 denotes a system of 240 rays and 300 bases , with 60 rays of multiplicity 2 and 180 rays of multiplicity 6 .",
    "we will only deal with bases of four rays in this paper , so the subscript in the right half of the symbol will always be 4 ( and will sometimes be dropped , for brevity ) . + the 120-cell has the property that all the orthogonalities between its rays are represented among its bases .",
    "thus its basis table ( i.e. , the list of all its bases ) contains the same information as its kochen - specker diagram .",
    "the basis table of the 120-cell is an object of great interest , because it is the structure within which all its parity proofs are embedded .",
    "in fact , any parity proof is just some subset of these bases , as we will see in sec.3 . +",
    "a listing of the full basis table of the 120-cell would take up too much space and is also unnecessary .",
    "we will explain how all the bases can be built up by applying suitable symmetry operations of the 120-cell to the computational basis , and then give a simple prescription that will allow the reader to write down all the bases from the few we actually list .",
    "+ let rays 1 - 4 of the 120-cell be represented by the vectors @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "these rays are mutually orthogonal and form a basis ( the  computational \" basis ) that we will denote 1 2 3 4 .",
    "let @xmath12 and @xmath13 be the orthogonal matrices    @xmath14    @xmath15    @xmath16    where @xmath17 is the golden ratio .",
    "these matrices represent four - dimensional rotations of period 3 , 5 and 5 , respectively , so that @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the @xmath20 identity matrix and @xmath13 are symmetry operations of the 120-cell , they can be described by the permutations they perform on its vertices : @xmath21 replaces the ray @xmath22 by the ray @xmath23 mod 300 , while @xmath13 replaces ray @xmath22 by @xmath24 if @xmath25 for @xmath26 , or by @xmath27 otherwise .",
    "the operator @xmath28 also performs a permutation , but it can not be described simply . ] .",
    "the other 296 rays of the 120-cell can be obtained by applying products of powers of @xmath28 , @xmath21 and @xmath13 to rays 1 - 4 in the manner described by the equation    @xmath29    where @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , and @xmath33 ( with @xmath34 ) is ray @xmath35 expressed as a four - component column vector .",
    "+    .the 300 rays of the 120-cell , grouped together in blocks of 12 rays each .",
    "each block defines a 24-cell , with each row of four rays within a block defining a basis .",
    "each row or column of blocks defines a 600-cell , with the 600-cells defined by the columns being labeled @xmath36 and those defined by the rows being labeled @xmath37 .",
    "each 24-cell in this table can be labeled by a pair of letters , one unprimed and the other primed , of the two 600-cells to which it belongs .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     tables 6 - 8 show three explicit examples of the parity proofs listed in table 5 .",
    "each proof spans a number of distinct 600-cells and each is also critical , as the reader may verify .",
    "+ we have not estimated how many different types of parity proofs there are in the 120-cell ( that do not lie entirely within a single 600-cell ) .",
    "we know there are no proofs of less than 19 bases and we have not found any with more than 41 bases , but we can not be sure about the upper limit because our searches have been limited to only the reduced sets in table 4",
    ". however two facts might be mentioned : the first is that a given ray - basis symbol often has a number of distinct ( i.e. unitarily inequivalent ) proofs associated with it , and the second is that each proof generally has hundreds or thousands of replicas under symmetry . taking both these facts into account , we estimate that there are probably over a million genuinely new parity proofs in the 120-cell that are not contained in any of the smaller polytopes in it .",
    "this paper has used the symmetries of the 120-cell to give a simple construction of the 300 rays and 675 bases associated with it ( see tables 1 - 3 ) ; it has identified several subsets of the 675 bases that are quickly searched for parity proofs ( see table 4 ) ; it has given a detailed account of the parity proofs in one of the subsets ( see table 5 ) ; and it has listed three explicit examples of the parity proofs ( see tables 6 - 8 ) so that any reader can see that they work as advertised . the framework established in this paper can be used by others who wish to view carry out a more exhaustive search for parity proofs in the 120-cell . + as mentioned in the introduction , parity proofs are interesting because they can be used to devise experimental tests of quantum contextuality and also have a variety of applications in quantum information processing .",
    "the 120-cell is the most complicated member of a family that includes the 600-cell and the 24 peres rays , but it abounds in many parity proofs that are distinctly its own and not contained in any of the smaller polytopes .",
    "the 120-cell ( like the 600-cell and the peres rays ) can be realized experimentally using a pair of qubits . from eq(4 ) it is clear that all the rays and bases of the 120-cell can be built up from the computational basis if one has the ability to implement the gates represented by the operators @xmath38 and their powers .",
    "this is a considerable experimental challenge , but it is not beyond the realm of possibility",
    ". it would be nice to find other examples of tasks that can be accomplished within the finite ( but fairly large ) universe of states and bases provided by the 120-cell , as that might further spur its experimental realization .",
    "whether there are any practical applications or not , the proofs of quantum contextuality made possible by the four - dimensional regular polytopes represent a charming encounter between classical geometry and quantum physics that does credit to both .",
