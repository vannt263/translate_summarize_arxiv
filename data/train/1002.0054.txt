    "interacting electrons in one - dimensional ( 1d ) metals constitute a highly collective state of matter : the tomonaga - luttinger liquid ( tll ) state .",
    "@xcite the collective nature of the tll states is what distinguishes them from their higher - dimensional counterparts .",
    "interacting electrons in two or three dimensions form a fermi liquid , wherein the only effects of interaction are the modification of their effective mass and the possibility of being scattered . in one dimension , however , even the slightest correlation between electron motions has a dramatic effect , leading to distinctive features that can not be explained by the fermi liquid theory . to date , physical consequences of the tll states have been experimentally observed in various systems , including carbon nanotubes,@xcite semiconducting quantum wires,@xcite quasi-1d organic conductors,@xcite quantum hall edge states,@xcite and other materials having highly anisotropic conductivity .",
    "@xcite from the theoretical viewpoint , a more general tll theory with a nonlinear dispersion @xcite as well as a novel wave - packed dynamics through y - shaped tll junctions@xcite have been recently suggested .",
    "a hallmark of tll states is a pseudogap in the one - particle density of states @xmath0 at the fermi energy @xmath1 .",
    "injection of an additional electron in the tll ground state disrupts the pre - existing correlation , thus requiring excitation of an infinite number of collective modes .",
    "this results in a power - law singularity of the form @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is called the tll exponent .",
    "the same power - law arises in the case of a differential tunneling current @xcite @xmath4 at high bias voltages @xmath5 and a temperature - dependent conductance @xmath6 at low voltages @xmath7 , although @xmath8 may change due to environment effects.@xcite these power - law behaviors are in strong contrast with the behavior of fermi liquids ; in the case of fermi liquids , @xmath0 close to @xmath1 and @xmath9 become constant .",
    "the tll exponent @xmath8 is nonuniversal ; it is dependent on the interaction strength,@xcite the geometric shape of the system,@xcite and the position of tunneling.@xcite in fact , different values of @xmath8 were obtained in carbon nanotube experiments when each electron tunneled into the end or bulk of the system.@xcite a further non - trivial shift in @xmath8 was suggested in multiwalled nanotubes , where @xmath8 varies in a continuous manner under the application of a high transverse magnetic field.@xcite continuous variation in @xmath8 was also found in a nuclear magnetic resonance study of cubr@xmath10(c@xmath11h@xmath12n)@xmath13 crystals;@xcite in this case , an external magnetic field acted as the chemical potential .",
    "such field - induced variations in @xmath8 can be exploited for achieving artificial control of transport properties in quasi-1d conductors , which would play a fundamental role in the development of next - generation quantum devices .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a theoretical framework for tll exponent manipulation based on electric field modulation .",
    "an analytical expression of the exponent @xmath8 for quasi-1d conductors subjected to a stepwise periodic potential is established in terms of the potential amplitude and period . under feasible physical conditions , @xmath8 increases significantly with an increase in the potential amplitude ; this indicates that it is possible to tune the quantum transport properties of quasi-1d systems by manipulating @xmath8 . for a concise description , we focus our attention on 1d spinless fermion systems , considering that the effects of spin degree of freedom requires no substantial revision of the present conclusion .",
