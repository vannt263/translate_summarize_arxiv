    "spinning particle models @xcite have been a useful framework to study fields of different spins in a first - quantized approach .",
    "wordline techniques can indeed give manageable representations of one - loop quantities in quantum field theories , such as effective actions , amplitudes and anomalies ( see for a review @xcite and references therein ) , and allow to describe ordinary higher spin fields in first quantization .",
    "we will present here a class of spinning particles enjoying a @xmath0-extended supersymmetry on the worldline @xcite , that naturally live on complex manifolds and give rise to complex higher spin equations . although a direct spacetime interpretation of these models is prevented by the complex nature of the target space , they are useful playgrounds to study issues related to the quantization of higher spins",
    ". they can as well provide insights in the study of khler geometries , supersymmetric field theories and qft s in curved backgrounds .",
    "more precisely , spinning particles are quantum mechanical models , enjoying local supersymmetries on the worldline . for instance , particles with @xmath2 local real supersymmetries describe spin @xmath3 fields in four dimensional spacetime .",
    "the constraints on the hilbert space of the particle theory , arising from the gauging , translate into a set of differential equations for the spacetime field , viewed as the wave function of the quantum mechanical model .",
    "interactions with scalars , gauge fields and gravity can be achieved , when allowed , by coupling the particle theory to suitable backgrounds . quantizing the particle",
    ", one can recover in a rather simple way various useful objects of the related qft , such as effective actions , n - point correlation functions , anomalies and so on .",
    "the path integral quantization for these non - linear sigma models , arising in gravitational backgrounds , requires regularization @xcite .",
    "this is essentially related to ill - defined products of distributions in perturbative computations , and we will use time slicing regularization ( ts ) in all the computations that will be showed .",
    "we organize the paper as follows : in the next section we will present the @xmath0 spinning particle and its dirac quantization in flat complex space .",
    "the end of the section will be devoted to the coupling to a curved khler background . in the last section",
    "we will focus on the @xmath4 model , studied in @xcite , describing @xmath1-forms on an arbitrary khler space .",
    "the local proper time expansion of the one - loop effective action will be briefly sketched , along with the first seeley - dewitt coefficients .",
    "we will comment at the end on exact relations between hodge dual forms that have been extracted from the particle model .",
    "the graded phase space of the model is spanned by complex coordinates of @xmath5 and momenta : @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , @xmath9 , along with the fermionic superpartners @xmath10 and @xmath11 , with @xmath12 .",
    "they obey equal time canonical ( anti)-commutation relations : @xmath13=i\\,\\delta^\\mu_\\nu\\;,\\quad[\\bar x^{\\bar\\mu},\\bar p_{\\bar\\nu}]=i\\,\\delta^{\\bar\\mu}_{\\bar\\nu}\\;,\\quad \\{\\psi^\\mu_i,\\bar\\psi_\\nu^j\\}=\\delta^\\mu_\\nu\\delta^j_i\\;.\\ ] ] quadratic operators constructed from the basic variables provide generators for the @xmath0-extended worldline susy : @xmath14=\\psi^\\mu_j\\bar\\psi_\\mu^i-\\frac d2\\,\\delta^i_j\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we raise and lower indices by means of the flat complex metric @xmath15 and its inverse .",

    "the equations of motion for the one - dimensional gauge fields constrain the classical generators to vanish . at the quantum level ,",
    "the operators ( [ un generators flat ] ) impose constraints on the hilbert space , by requiring that they annihilate physical states : @xmath30 where @xmath31 .",
    "this is allowed since ( [ un superalgebra ] ) is a first class superalgebra , and amounts to dirac quantization .",
    "the above constraints will be the aforementioned higher spin equations obeyed by spacetime fields , that sit as @xmath32-dependent coefficients inside @xmath33 , when expanded in terms of position eigenstates @xmath34 .      in a schroedinger picture",
    ", we shall realize the fermionic oscillator algebra in ( [ canonical commutators ] ) treating the @xmath35 operators as grassmann - odd variables , and the @xmath36 as odd derivatives thereof : @xmath37 .",
    "the states in the hilbert space will have a finite taylor expansion in powers of @xmath38 s , so that the coefficients of the expansion are multi - form spacetime fields with only holomorphic indices .",
    "the @xmath39 constraints are purely algebraic on the multi - forms , and impose irreducibility conditions with respect to @xmath40 .",
    "after imposing them , the only states that survive in the hilbert space correspond to tensors with @xmath2 blocks of @xmath29 antisymmetric indices , with @xmath28 : @xmath41, ... ,\\mu^n[m]}(x,\\bar x)\\;,\\ ] ] where we denoted @xmath42:=[\\mu_1 ... \\mu_k]$ ] .",
    "symmetry between block exchanges ensures they belong to a @xmath40 rectangular young tableaux with @xmath29 rows and @xmath2 columns . on the spacetime fields the supercharges @xmath17 and @xmath18 act as dolbeault operators",
    "the dolbeault operator acts as an holomorphic exterior derivative : @xmath43 and their hermitian conjugates , generalized to multi - forms such that @xmath44 meaning that it antisymmetrizes the derivative only among the indices of the @xmath45-th block .",
    "the remaining constraints have then the form of generalized bianchi and maxwell equations , _",

    "it is indeed possible to solve the first of ( [ hs equation curvature ] ) by introducing a gauge potential @xmath48 as @xmath49 or , in tensor language : @xmath50, ... ,\\mu^n[m]}=\\partial_{\\mu^1} ... \\partial_{\\mu^n}\\phi_{\\mu^1[m-1], ... ,\\mu^n[m-1]}\\;,\\ ] ] where each set of indices @xmath51 is antisymmetrized : @xmath52:=[\\mu^k_1 ... \\mu^k_m]$ ] .",
    "let us notice that for @xmath53 the maxwell equation ( [ hs equation curvature ] ) on the potential is higher derivative .",
    "we also mention that for @xmath54 we have ordinary @xmath55-forms @xmath56 , carefully studied in @xcite , while for @xmath57 the gauge potentials are completely symmetric tensors @xmath58 . since @xmath59 for each @xmath60 , it is easy to see that the curvature @xmath47 is indeed invariant under a gauge transformation of the form @xmath61 , that is @xmath62, ... ,\\mu^n[p]}=&&\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\partial_{\\mu^1}\\lambda^{(1)}_{\\mu^1[p-1], ... ,\\mu^n[p]}\\\\ & & \\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!+\\ldots+\\partial_{\\mu^n}\\lambda^{(n)}_{\\mu^1[p], ... ,\\mu^n[p-1 ] } \\label{gauge trans}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we already noticed that the maxwell - like equations are higher derivative in terms of the gauge field : @xmath63 .",
    "it is actually possible to introduce a second order wave operator , analogous to the fronsdal - labastida one , and reduce the field equations to second order : @xmath64 by means of an auxiliary compensator @xmath65 . in tensor language",

    "it turns out that it is possible to gauge fix the compensators to zero , at the price of having transverse gauge parameters : @xmath67 .",
    "we analyze here the changes needed to couple the spinning particle to an arbitrary background metric .",
    "let us consider as target space a @xmath68 dimensional khler manifold , equipped with a metric @xmath69 in holomorphic coordinates .",
    "having in mind the minimal coupling , it is sufficient to replace suitably covariantized constraints in the action ( [ phase space action un spinning ] ) . to this aim , we define @xmath40 `` lorentz '' generators @xmath70 $ ] so that we can construct covariant momenta and supercharges factors ensure that @xmath71 : @xmath72 the superalgebra ( [ un superalgebra ] ) is deformed by the target space geometry , namely one has @xmath73 where the minimally covariantized hamiltonian reads @xmath74 .",
    "one can see from ( [ qqbar curved ] ) that the algebra is no longer first class , and hence the model is inconsistent , on general khler backgrounds .",
    "important exceptions are the cases @xmath75 , presented in the next section , that can be quantized on any curved background , and represent differential forms . for @xmath76 one can still quantize the model on particular backgrounds . for instance , it is possible to quantize the spinning particle for general @xmath2 , that is for arbitrary `` spin '' , on khler spaces with constant holomorphic curvature @xcite , _",
    "we shall focus in this section to the model with @xmath78 on an arbitrary khler manifold with metric @xmath79 .",
    "we decide to realize the fermionic operators in a slightly different way : here we will treat @xmath80 and @xmath81 as odd coordinates , and @xmath82 , @xmath83 as derivatives thereof . in this way",
    ", states in the hilbert space are @xmath1-forms . in @xcite ,",
    "several theories of differential forms were investigated by using the @xmath4 spinning particle . here",
    "we restrict ourselves to present one of those models . to obtain the model we are interested in ,",
    "it is sufficient to gauge only the @xmath84 subgroup of the @xmath20-symmetry @xmath4 generated by @xmath85 and @xmath86 . in such a case one",
    "is free to have two different chern - simons couplings @xmath87 and @xmath88 , compared to @xmath27 in ( [ phase space action un spinning ] ) .",
    "this allows to fix independently the eigenvalues of the @xmath85 and @xmath89 constraints , and physical states will be forms @xmath90 , for given arbitrary @xmath91 .",
    "the four supercharges are realized now as dolbeault operators and their hermitian conjugates : @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 , @xmath95 , while the superalgebra ( [ un superalgebra ] ) closes on the hamiltonian that acts as the hodge laplacian @xmath96 bianchi equations can be locally integrated by introducing a potential : @xmath97 . in this particular model ,",
    "even if we are dealing with differential forms , maxwell equations ( @xmath98 ) are higher derivative with respect to the potential @xmath99 . as we did in the general case ,",
    "it is possible to have second order field equations by introducing a compensator : @xmath100 the equations ( [ field eq n=2 ] ) are gauge invariant under the combined transformations of the gauge field and compensator @xmath101 and one can see again that gauge fixing the compensator to zero would restrict the gauge parameters to be transverse .",
    "let us turn now to the path integral quantization of the @xmath4 spinning particle .",
    "if the particle is quantized on a circle with external gravity , one finds a representation for the qft one - loop effective action of the @xmath1-form in a gravitational background .",
    "we will present the corresponding heat kernel expansion in terms of local seeley - dewitt coefficients . in order to quantize the spinning particle",
    ", we have to take into account the gauge fixing of local worldline symmetries and faddeev - popov determinants .",
    "because of the topology of the worldline circle , one is left with three modular integrals : the usual one over @xmath102 , being the proper length of the circle , and two angular integration over @xmath103 and @xmath48 , taking into account the gauge invariant wilson loops of the two @xmath104 factors .",

    "first of all , let us stress that the overall coefficient @xmath116 gives the number of propagating degrees of freedom . for @xmath117 or @xmath118 greater than @xmath119 it vanishes and can not be factored out in ( [ effective action coeff ] ) .",
    "other coefficients can and indeed are non - vanishing , and represent the topological contribution of a non - propagating form . as a second remark we should notice that the result ( [ k coeff ] ) holds only for @xmath120",
    ". in @xmath121 only scalars propagate , and all the @xmath114 vanish . in @xmath122 instead , they have the form @xmath123 finally , we stress that the @xmath114 coefficients in ( [ k coeff ] ) were used to make manifest the symmetry under the exchanges @xmath124 and @xmath125 .",
    "the first exchange is related to the symmetry under complex conjugation , that states the equivalence @xmath126=z_{q , p}[g]$ ] and is exact . the second exchange relates forms with hodge dual curvatures and is more subtle . despite the manifest symmetry in the coefficients ( [ k coeff ] ) , it is not an exact symmetry at the quantum level , and one can already see that in @xmath122 the @xmath114 ( [ k coeff d=3 ] ) are not invariant under @xmath127 . in general , for higher dimension @xmath128",
    "the mismatch appears in higher order seeley - dewitt coefficients .",
