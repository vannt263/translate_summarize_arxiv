    "the bridge and the clump at the contact point , together with the less intense emission at @xmath49 , form an arc - shaped feature with a radius of @xmath16 pc ( dashed magenta lines in figure 4 ) .",

    "all these emission features also appear in the h@xmath1cn , sio , so , and hc@xmath3n maps but are less prominent in the hcn and hco@xmath0 maps ( figure 5 ) , presumably because of severe foreground absorption ( see also figure 2 ) . because these lines have high critical densities , the bridge , clump , and arc probably consist of dense [ @xmath50 @xmath51 molecular gas .",

    "the    hc@xmath3n emission from the filament disappears at    @xmath54 , while that of the other lines seems    to connect with the cnd . because hc@xmath3n is a uv - fragile    molecule ( rodrguez - franco et al .",
    "1998 ) , the absence of the    hc@xmath3n may be understood as a result of the    photodissociation by the intense uv field from the central cluster .",
    "this suggests the proximity of the northern ride to the nucleus .",
    "western streamer : :    a long filament curves from the west to the north side of the 2 pc    ring with a steep velocity gradient of 25 km s@xmath5    pc@xmath5 ( mcgary et al .",
    "submillimeter    interferometric observations resolved the streamer into four arms ( w-1    to w-4 ; liu et al . 2012 ) .",

    "this suggests    that w-1 moves in parallel with the rotation of the cnd with high    angular momentum , as previously inferred by liu et al .",
    "( 2012 ) .",
    "counterparts of w-2 and w-3 may be a diffuse component located at    @xmath57 in the velocity range of + 20 km    s@xmath58 km    s@xmath5 ( figure 3 ) .",
    "w-4 , which is located at    @xmath59 , is likely to be    a part of the nle or the northern edge of the bridge .",
    "southern streamer : :    a long filament is elongated from the + 20 km s@xmath5    cloud to the southern edge of the 2 pc ring ( e.g. , coil & ho 1999 ,    2000 ) .",

    "1991 ;    ho et al . 1991",

    "our data    distinctly delineate this bend and its connection to the nle with a    fine spatial resolution .",
    "features connected with the cnd have been discussed in several works as described above .",
    "our high - resolution data have manifested the emission continuity between the + 20 km s@xmath5 cloud and the cnd as the bridge , clump , and the nle for the first time .",
    "the continuity may indicate a physical connection between the + 20 km s@xmath5 cloud and the nle . in order to seek more support for the connection , we examine line intensity ratios .",
    "the _ j_=10 lines of hcn and hco@xmath0 are well - established probes of dense molecular gas .",
    "however , we do not use these lines in the following analysis because they tend to be optically thick for the molecular clouds in the galactic center and suffer from strong absorption by the foreground .",
    "we use the line intensity ratios of the h@xmath1cn to the cs , sio , so , and hc@xmath3n lines to diagnose the chemical difference between the + 50 km s@xmath5 cloud , the + 20 km s@xmath5 cloud , the cnd , and the bridge .",
    "the cs line is often used as a good probe of dense molecular gas as well as the lines of hcn and hco@xmath0 , and cs is not vulnerable to uv photons ( martn et al .",
    "2012 ) . on the other hand , hc@xmath3n can be easily destroyed by uv photons ( rodrguez - franco et al",
    ". 1998 ) and reaction with c@xmath0 ions ( meier & turner 2005 ) .",

    "the data were clipped by @xmath63 detection of the h@xmath1cn line ( 0.3 k ) .",
    "assuming an abundance ratio of [ h@xmath64cn]/[h@xmath1cn]=[@xmath64c]/[@xmath1c]=24 ( langer & penzias 1990 ) , the hcn / h@xmath1cn ratio suggested that the optical depths of the h@xmath1cn line are less than 0.2 in the cnd and range from 0.1 to 0.8 ( mostly less than 0.5 ) in the gmcs .",

    "however , the upper part of the + 20 km s@xmath5 cloud seems to be accelerating toward us .",
    "this fact is incompatible with the streamer interpretation of the bridge .",
    "this invokes the cloud - plunging scenario , in which a cloud has plunged into the + 20 km s@xmath5 cloud .",
    "figure 7 shows the schematic views of the scenario .",
    "the nle , which is the asymmetric part of the cnd , may be a remnant of the parent gmc that has been captured and disrupted by the potential well at the nucleus ( mapelli & trani 2016 ) .",
    "this asymmetric part may have plunged into the northern part of the + 20 km s@xmath5 cloud @xmath73 years ago .",
    "it compressed , accelerated , and swept up molecular gas in the + 20 km s@xmath5 cloud that had been just in front of the nle , to form the connecting bridge and the arc of emission .",
    "the negative - velocity end of the nle , which may correspond to its  head \" , has an lsr velocity similar to the rotational velocity of the 2 pc ring .",
    "thus , the head of the nle may have already gone through the northern periphery of the + 20 km s@xmath5 cloud .",
    "some fractions of the progenitor of the nle with smaller angular momentum may have gone ahead on inner orbits without colliding with the + 20 km s@xmath5 cloud .",
    "this streaming gas may compose the western streamer ( liu et al .",
    "2012 ) .",
    "because the difference in velocity between the nle head and the + 20 km s@xmath5 cloud exceeds 100 km s@xmath5 , it is expected with the cloud - plunging scenario that the gas - phase abundance of refractory molecules will increase in the shocked layer of the colliding clouds ( e.g. , habe & ohta 1992 ) .",
    "sio is a well - established shocked gas probe ( e.g. , martn - pintado et al .",

    "figure 8 shows the _ b  v _ maps of the sio _",
    "_ j_=10 intensity ratio at the same galactic longitudes as in figure 4 .",
    "the ratio was calculated for the locations where detection of the h@xmath1cn line was @xmath74 ( 0.3 k ) .",
    "we found that the ratio is enhanced ( @xmath75 ) in the northern edge of the + 20 km s@xmath5 cloud , where the southern streamer lies ( okumura et al .",
    "1989 , 1991 ; coil & ho 1999 , 2000 ) .",
    "liu et al . ( 2013 ) reported that the sio _",
    "j_=10 intensity ratio was also significantly enhanced in the northern edge of the + 20 km s@xmath5 cloud ( see figure 9 in their paper ) .",
    "these enhancements may be due to the increase in sio abundance caused by shocks .",
    "the authors suggested the presence of infalling clouds on noncircular orbits ( liu et al .",
    "wright et al . ( 2001 ) also suggested that the southern streamer also experienced shock heating , which was possibly induced by the supernova of sgr a east .",
    "although any of these shock processes including ours can not currently be ruled out , we interpret that the sio enhancement at the root of the bridge may be caused by the putative violent collision of the clouds , thereby providing support for the cloud - plunging scenario .",
    "the collision between the + 20 km s@xmath5 cloud and the nle cancels out their angular momentum and they lose kinetic energy with dissipation of the shock .",
    "as a result , part of the nle may accrete inward along highly eccentric orbits . these processes",
    "may lead to growth of the 2 pc ring and possibly feed the inner cavity .",
    "we estimated that the gas mass from this collision available for feeding is @xmath77 using the cs _ j_=21 data in the box defined by @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 km s@xmath5 .",
    "for the estimation , we assumed local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) with an excitation temperature of 10 k ( tsuboi et al . 2015 ) , an optical depth of 0.4 , a @xmath81/[h_2]$ ] fractional abundance of @xmath82 ( requena - torres et al . 2006 ) , and a distance to the galactic center of 8.3 kpc ( gillessen et al .",
    "the optical depth was estimated from the cs _ j_=21/@xmath1cs _ j_=21 intensity ratio obtained by our previous line surveys ( takekawa et al .",

    "the mass of the cnd was estimated from the cs intensity to be @xmath83 .",
    "this is comparable to the mass of ( 25)@xmath8410@xmath85 @xmath7 that was estimated by oka et al .",
    "the available mass ( @xmath86 ) is one order of magnitude smaller than the current mass of the cnd .",
    "therefore , the possible feeding of the cnd does not significantly alter its toomre s @xmath87 parameter ( @xmath88 ; toomre 1964 ) of @xmath1430 , so the cnd remains sufficiently stable against self - gravitational fragmentation . nevertheless , it is still possible that this collision increases the mass - feeding rate to the central 1 pc if the infalling gas reaches the inner cavity without accreting onto the cnd .",
    "our cloud - plunging scenario naturally explains the observed kinematics and proposes a possible pathway for the transportation of the molecular gas from the outer gmcs to within the central few parsecs .",
    "this scenario could be bolstered with direct measurements of the three - dimensional kinematics of the region , such as that performed for the minispiral with the very large array ( vla ; zhao et al .",
    "the long - baseline observations performed with the atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array ( alma ) at @xmath89 year intervals will be able to measure the proper motions of molecular clumps and thereby delineate the three - dimensional kinematics .",
    "this paper presents the results of mapping observations of the central 10 pc of our galaxy in seven molecular lines at millimeter wavelength with the nro 45 m telescope .",
    "the principal results of this study are summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "an emission bridge that may connect the + 20 km s@xmath5 cloud ( m0.130.08 ) and the nle of the circumnuclear disk ( cnd ) was detected in the cs , h@xmath1cn , sio , so , and hc@xmath3n lines . 2 .",
    "the bridge has intermediate line intensity ratios of cs / h@xmath1cn , sio / h@xmath1cn , so / h@xmath1cn , and hc@xmath3n / h@xmath1cn between those of the + 20 km s@xmath5 cloud and the cnd .",
    "this is consistent with the interpretation that the chemical and physical properties of the bridge are a hybrid of the + 20 km s@xmath5 cloud and the cnd .",
    "3 .   the cloud - plunging scenario , in which the nle plunged into the + 20 km s@xmath5 cloud ,",
    "was proposed to explain the kinematics of the bridge , the nle , and the bend of the + 20 km s@xmath5 cloud .",
    "such collisional events can feed the cnd and thereby could promote mass feeding into the central parsec .",
    "we are grateful to the nobeyama radio observatory ( nro ) staff for their excellent support of the 45 m telescope observations .",
    "the nro is a branch of the national astronomical observatory of japan , national institutes of natural sciences .",
    "we thank the anonymous referee for helpful comments and suggestions that improved this paper .",
    "this study was supported by a grant - in - aid for research fellow from the japan society for the promotion of science ( 15j04405 ) .",
