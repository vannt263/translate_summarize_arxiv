    "in the past few years , electron transport through magnetic molecules , especially the single - molecule magnet ( smm ) , was intensively studied in both experimental@xcite and theoretical@xcite aspects , which is stimulated by the fundamental importance as well as potential applications in molecular spintronics .",
    "many fascinating properties have been found , such as complex tunneling spectra@xcite , negative differential conductance ( ndc)@xcite , kondo effect@xcite , berry phase blockade@xcite , full counting statistics@xcite , colossal spin fluctuations@xcite , and so on , which are resulted from the large spin - number and high anisotropy of smm . the complete current suppression and negative differential conductance",
    "are also confirmed by the single - molecule - transistor measurement , which as a function of bias , gate voltage , and external magnetic field provide evidences of magnetic signatures of the smm@xcite .",
    "manipulation of spins in magnetic molecules , which is based on the development of spin - controlling techniques , may result in new strategies of quantum - state control .",
    "it is demonstrated that the charge and spin states of molecule can be identified from the measured tunneling spectra due to the existence of exchange interaction between the * * local spin of magnetic molecule and the spin of tunneling electron , particularly the antiferromagnetic exchange interaction in a magnetic single - molecule transistor based on n@c60@xcite . on the other hand",
    "the tunneling current between magnetic electrodes can also control the orientation of molecular magnet shown by the study of colossal spin fluctuations@xcite .    based on the study of spin polarized transport through a smm",
    "some new spintronic devices are proposed , which display many interesting effects .",
    "in particular the spin - diode behavior@xcite and tunnel magnetoresistance ( tmr ) @xcite are shown to be resulted from the exchange coupling between the lowest - unoccupied - malecular - orbital ( lumo ) level and the core spin .",
    "furthermore a large negative tmr is predicted in the case of antiferromagnetic exchange - coupling @xcite .",
    "the giant spin amplification and spin - blockade behavior are useful in molecular spintronics to serve as a read - out mechanism @xcite .",
    "it is also found that the magnetization of smm can be reversed by spin polarized current @xcite and spin - bias driven magnetization reversal is also observed theoretically@xcite .",
    "the most recent study is focused on the manipulation of smm by thermal spin - transfer torque @xcite .",
    "moreover a highly spin - polarized current can be generated by thermoelectric effects@xcite .",
    "to date , most researches are concentrated on the manipulation of a smm by the transported electron , which on the other hand may be used as a probe to explore the level structure of the smm .",
    "the spin - polarized current through a smm itself has received little attention , while in the quantum - dot ( qd ) case it is extensively studied@xcite in terms of nonequilibrium green s functions@xcite and master - equation @xcite respectively .",
    "the qd acts as a spin - current diode giving rise to the spin blockade .",
    "the spin current in qd system shows quite different characteristics compared with the charge transport @xcite .",
    "we in the present paper study the spin - polarized transport through a smm , which has more complex level - structure than the single qd .",
    "moreover the exchange coupling between smm and the transported electron - spin leads to additional dynamic mechanism to manipulate the spin - polarization of current .",
    "both parallel and antiparallel configurations of lead magnetization are considered along with the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic couplings . for the ferromagnetic exchange - coupling ,",
    "the spin current variation with respect to the bias voltage exhibits a step - like curve in parallel configurations and basin - like behavior in the antiparallel configurations , respectively .",
    "the interesting observation in antiferromagnetic coupling case is that , the spin - polarization can be reversed with increasing bias voltage in antiparallel lead - configurations .",

    "the bias - voltage dependence of the spin current @xmath106 and current - polarization @xmath107 for various lead - polarizations @xmath98 are shown in fig .",
    "3(c ) and fig .",
    "the spin current exhibits step - like behavior in parallel lead - configurations , which is  also the same as in a single qd @xcite , while with more steps due to the complex energy levels of smm .",
    "in addition , when lead - polarization @xmath98 increases , the spin current varies more evidently along with an increasing magnitude of current polarization @xmath107 in contrast to the charge current . the current polarization @xmath107 approaches the largest value at a very low bias voltage , which is dominated by elastic co - tunneling processes through majority - majority and minority - minority spin channels . with increasing bias voltage , the inelastic co - tunneling starts to enter the transport and leads to the decrease of @xmath107",
    "moreover , as the bias voltage reaches the threshold of sequential transport , the value of @xmath107 approaches the lead - polarization @xmath98 @xcite , due to the appearance of sequential transport channels .",
    "the results of antiferromagnetic exchange interaction ( fig.4 ) are different from the ferromagnetic case due to the two degenerate ground - states @xmath108 seen from fig .",
    "2(b ) , where the differential conductance spectra have four evident peaks . with the increase of lead - polarization @xmath98 ( except @xmath105 ) the position of peak@xmath109 shifts toward the negative direction of the @xmath110-axis since the contribution is mainly from the transition of @xmath111 instead of @xmath100 .",
    "the other three peaks ( peak@xmath112 ) are resulted from the transitions of @xmath113 , @xmath114 , and @xmath115 , respectively . for the case of @xmath105 , the position of peak-2",
    "has a great change different from the peak-1 in the ferromagnetic coupling , where the state @xmath116 does not participate in transition . besides",
    ", @xmath106 and @xmath107 exhibit similar behaviors with the ferromagnetic case .      in the antiparallel configuration of magnetic leads peculiar behavior of the spin current",
    "is observed , which is shown in fig .",
    "5 . from fig .",
    "5(a ) , it is seen that @xmath96 decreases monotonously from a maximum value to zero at a certain bias - voltage when @xmath98 increases from @xmath117 to @xmath118 .",
    "since transport occurs mainly through two spin channels ( majority - minority and minority - majority ) , for a large @xmath98 the most probable transport process is that a spin - down electron of higher rate from the lead @xmath119  tunnels through the molecule along with a spin - flip and molecular spin - state lowering simultaneously .",
    "however , this process is limited by the lowest spin - state of molecule and thus the charge current finally vanishes @xcite . also , the @xmath97 peaks in fig .",
    "5(b ) are suppressed with the increase of @xmath98 and the peak-2 appeared in fig .",
    "3(b ) even disappears because the transition channels through states @xmath120 are blocked .",
    "the spin current @xmath106 ( see fig .",
    "5(c ) ) shows a basin - like behavior in the region @xmath121 similar to the qd case .",
    "the difference is that @xmath106 in the smm can be suppressed by the lead - polarization @xmath98 at some value , however it is enhanced always with the increase of @xmath98 ( @xmath122 ) in the qd .",
    "nevertheless , @xmath107 displays a monotonic behavior with increase of @xmath98 ( @xmath122 ) for a fixed bias voltage @xmath110 seen from fig .",
    "it is found that the polarization @xmath107 can have a high value at low lead - polarization @xmath98 resulted from the exchange coupling between the electron - spin and the smm .",
    "moreover , in contrast to the parallel lead - configuration the current with @xmath123 is contributed mainly from elastic co - tunneling processes around zero bias voltage , which belong to the majority - minority and minority - majority spin channels . with increasing @xmath110 ,",
    "the inelastic co - tunneling dominates the transport and @xmath107 decreases . beyond the threshold value of sequential transport",
    "the peak-1 arises and @xmath107 reaches the lowest value due to the transition @xmath124 .",
    "then @xmath107 increases since more transport channels enter the bias window .    fig .",
    "6 is the @xmath125 diagram for antiferromagnetic exchange coupling , in which the @xmath96 curve ( fig .",
    "6(a ) ) exhibits a similar behavior as in the ferromagnetic coupling case .",
    "the corresponding differential conductance @xmath97 is shown in fig .",
    "moreover , in the antiparallel lead - configuration the steady state probabilities with the negative eigenvalues of spin operator @xmath126 become larger than that of positive eigenvalues resulted by the spin - flip process@xcite*. * therefore , the peak-1 and peak-3 of the @xmath97 curve are mainly contributed by the spin - up electron transitions @xmath127 and @xmath128 respectively . * * on the other hand , the peak-2 ( peak-4 ) is mainly induced by the transition @xmath124 ( @xmath129 ) of the spin - down electron .",
    "the spin - current curve @xmath106 in fig .",
    "6(c ) has a very interesting characteristic different from the ferromagnetic case that it possesses an alternate structure of two - plateau and one - basin**. * * the first plateau appears between the positions of peak-1 and peak-2 , where the spin - up current is larger than the spin - down ( positive @xmath107 ) . * * in addition , the spin current shows a non - monotonic behavior with increasing lead - polarizations @xmath98 , which is resulted from the competition between the spin - up and spin - down currents . * * furthermore , with increasing the bias voltage the basin emerges when the transition @xmath130 starts to participate in the transport , in which the spin - down current becomes larger than the spin - up current ( negative @xmath107 ) . * * the second plateau of spin current appears as the bias voltage increases to the value between the peak-3 and peak-4 .",
    "finally when all transport channels open up , the spin current vanishes . in conclusion , the polarization of spin current @xmath107 can be inverted by adjusting the bias voltage and the spin current exhibits rich multi - ndc behaviors @xcite .",
    "the polarization reversal of spin current may have potential application in the spintronic device .",
    "in summary , the spin current through a smm weakly coupled to two ferromagnetic leads is obtained in the nonlinear tunneling regime for both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic exchange - couplings . the complex energy spectrum of the smm results in rich properties of the currents and conductances compared with the single qd , which on the other hand provide magnetic signatures of the smm .",
    "the most interesting observation is the spin - polarization reversal in the antiferromagnetic exchange - coupling case , which can be manipulated by the bias voltage .",
    "these theoretical results may be useful in the future development of spintronic devices .",
