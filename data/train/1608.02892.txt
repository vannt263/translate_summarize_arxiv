    "in particular , the dy process on nuclear targets is an ideal tool to probe and to quantify the initial state interaction ( isi ) , saturation , gluon shadowing and coherence effects in a clean environment due to the absence of final - state interactions and fragmentation processes typically associated with energy loss or absorption phenomena @xcite .",
    "the corresponding predictions for the nucleus - to - nucleon ratio known as the nuclear modification factor @xmath4 have been obtained using the color dipole approach @xcite which is known to provide as precise predictions for the dy cross section in @xmath5 collisions as the next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) collinear factorisation framework . in the color",
    "dipole picture , the dy process off nuclei looks as @xmath6 bremsstrahlung off a projectile quark propagating through the nuclear medium @xcite .",
    "remarkably , the dipole framework enables us to include the coherence effects in nuclear collisions naturally from the first principles by means of the generalised path - integral ( or green function ) formulation ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) , and thorough studies of its implications for the dy reaction on nuclear targets is the main purpose of this work .",
    "the onset of nuclear coherence effects ( nuclear shadowing ) is controlled by the coherence length ( cl ) , @xmath2 , which can be interpreted as a lifetime of @xmath6-quark fluctuations in a nuclear environment . at high energies , the cl exceeds the nuclear radius @xmath0 , @xmath7 , and the corresponding formalism treating the coherence effects is greatly simplified .",
    "this regime referred to as the large coherence length ( lcl ) limit was discussed in details in ref .",
    "@xcite , where predictions for the nuclear suppression of the dy pair production at rhic and lhc energies were presented .    on the other hand , at small and medium c.m .",
    "collision energies ( @xmath3 gev ) when the cl is much shorter than the mean nucleon spacing in a nucleus , i.e. @xmath8 fm , the corresponding regime is known as the short coherence length ( scl ) limit where no effects of the quantum coherence are expected .",
    "consequently , the formalism used in ref .",
    "@xcite and valid in the lcl limit can not be extended directly to such kinematic region .",
    "an alternative way is to study the dy pair production process using the green function formalism developed in ref .",
    "@xcite which represents a universal method to describe dipole interactions with a nuclear target including effects responsible for the nuclear shadowing .",
    "this formalism naturally incorporates the color transparency and quantum coherence effects and can consequently be used in analysis of the nuclear shadowing without particular restrictions on magnitude of the cl .",
    "so far , the existing calculations of the nucleus - to - nucleon ratio of the dy pair production cross sections are performed in either lcl or scl limits and do not account for a realistic value of the cl .",
    "the lcl results systematically overestimate the nuclear shadowing effect suggesting the need for a more sophisticated analysis which should incorporate finite cls . as the main objective of the present paper , we investigate for the first time the dy process in the framework of generalised color dipole approach based on the green function formalism .",
    "the latter enables us to obtain realistic predictions for the nuclear shadowing in those kinematical regions where the scl and lcl regimes are not realised .",
    "we also verify that this formalism correctly reproduces both the scl and lcl approximations in the kinematical regions corresponding to very short and very long cls , respectively .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in the next section",
    ", we introduce the cl and present its dependences on energy , feynman variable @xmath9 and invariant dilepton mass @xmath10 .",
    "we have specified the kinematic regions where the dy cross section can be reliably predicted using the scl and lcl approximations .",
    "we have also determined the transition domains between the scl and lcl regimes where the use of the rigorous green function formalism is unavoidable for realistic predictions for the dy nuclear cross section . in section [ formalism ] , we present the color dipole description of the dy process and briefly discuss the key elements of the green function formulation . in particular , we describe the numerical method used in our analysis in order to obtain a numerical solution of the schrdinger equation for the green function determining the dipole propagation through a color medium . in section [ res ] , we present the results for the nuclear modification factor @xmath4 and compare them with the data available from the fnal fixed - target experiment .",
    "the predictions for @xmath4 as a function of dy pair rapidity and invariant mass are given in kinematical regions that can be probed by future measurements at rhic collider as well as by the after@lhc and lhcb fixed - target experiments .",
    "these calculations are performed for several models of the dipole cross section . at large feynman variable @xmath9 and/or at forward rapidities , besides the quark shadowing inherited from the green function formalism , we take into account the gluon shadowing ( gs ) contribution as well leading to an additional nuclear suppression . besides the shadowing corrections ,",
    "we incorporate yet another source of nuclear effects dominated at large dilepton invariant masses and @xmath9 values and caused by the initial - state interactions which are relevant in kinematic regions where no shadowing is expected . in order to test the considered green function formalism",
    ", we verify that it reproduces the results obtained in the standard scl and lcl approximations in the corresponding kinematic regimes .",
    "finally , in section [ conc ] we summarize our main conclusions .",
    "the color dipole approach is formulated in the target rest frame where the dy pair production process is viewed as @xmath6 bremsstrahlung off a projectile quark ( see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite ) . in the case of nuclear targets ,",
    "the dy process is controlled by the cl which regulates the interference of scattering amplitudes on different nucleons in the target nucleus .",

    "using the kinematic relations @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the light - cone momentum fraction taken by the photon from the incoming proton , @xmath22 is the proton mass , and @xmath23 is the projectile proton energy , one obtains the following expression for the cl @xmath24    in order to analyse the c.m .",

    "multiple scatterings off nucleons in the target nucleus give rise to various nuclear effects .",
    "one of such effects is the shadowing which represents one of the sources for the nuclear attenuation in the dy process .",
    "the cl controls the number of scatterings of a projectile in the course of its propagation through a nuclear target and , therefore , determines the magnitude of nuclear effects @xcite .",
    "one should distinguish between the two limiting cases where the physical picture and the corresponding description of nuclear effects in dy pair production is significantly simplified :    * * the short cl ( scl ) regime*. in this case , the mean cl @xmath30 becomes much smaller than the mean nucleon ( interparticle ) spacing in the nucleus , i.e. @xmath31 = @xmath32fm .",
    "such a short cl excludes any shadowing since the time scale of the fluctuation is so short that the constituents of the fluctuation have no time to multiply interact with the medium .",
    "thus , all nucleons of the nuclear target contribute equally to the cross - section .",
    "this is the so - called bethe - heitler regime @xcite .",
    "* * the long cl ( lcl ) regime*. this regime represents the situation when the mean cl considerably exceeds the nuclear radius , i.e. @xmath33 , such that the projectile interacts with the whole nucleus at the surface .",
    "this is the so - called landau - pomeranchuk - migdal effect @xcite corresponding to the maximal shadowing .",
    "the analysis of the transition region between the scl and lcl regimes is generally much more difficult and less straightforward .",
    "the most rigorous approach is based on the green function formalism @xcite that will be described in the next section .",
    "another and more simple alternative , that sometimes is used in the literature , is based on a simple interpolation between the scl and lcl limits using the longitudinal nuclear form factor @xmath34 , where the variable @xmath35 corresponds to the longitudinal momentum transferred in the scattering @xcite .    in fig .",

    ", one observes a strong onset of the isi effects at forward rapidities and/or at large @xmath16 where only a weak effect of the quantum coherence is expected .    finally , in fig .",
    "[ fig : mass_lhcb ] we show our results for the dilepton invariant mass and pseudorapidity dependence of the ratio @xmath4 at lhcb fixed - target c.m .",
    "collision energy @xmath130 gev considering several different targets .",
    "we observe an increase of the nuclear shadowing and/or isi effects with increasing rapidity as expected . as was already indicated above",
    ", a nuclear dy measurement at large dilepton invariant masses would allow to suppress the cl effects and thus represents a clean promising way of phenomenological investigation of the net isi effect .",
    "as was demonstrated by various studies during past few decades , the dy reaction in @xmath46 collisions is an effective tool for clean studies of the initial - state medium effects occurring before a hard collision in the nuclear environment since no final - state interactions are concerned . in this work",
    ", we have shown that the relative contribution of nuclear effects to the nuclear suppression @xmath4 is controlled by the cl which is correlated with the nuclear shadowing and depends on energy , rapidity and dilepton invariant mass .    in the range of small collision energies",
    "when the cl is small , namely , @xmath131 fm , one should not expect any shadowing effects ( scl regime ) due to a short lifetime of the @xmath81 fluctuation . in contract , at large collision energies and/or forward rapidities when the cl considerably exceeds the nuclear radius , i.e. @xmath1 , within an extended kinematic region we expect a maximal shadowing ( lcl regime ) . in both cases ,",
    "the theoretical description of the dy process is significantly simplified and is widely known in the literature .    however , at medium c.m .",
    "collision energies , @xmath3 gev , and/or at large dilepton invariant masses , the cl can be smaller or comparable with the nuclear radius , @xmath132 , and thereby corresponds to a transition region between the scl and lcl limits . in this case , calculations performed within the lcl approximation lead to a sizeable overestimation of the nuclear shadowing and , consequently , should not be used in analysis of the medium effects . for this reason",
    ", we employ the rigorous path - integral technique known as the green function formalism implying no restrictions to the cl .",
    "this formalism is known to provide an exact treatment of shadowing effects in various kinematic regions .",
    "such a generic study of nuclear shadowing in the dy process for arbitrary cls is the main purpose of our work .",
    "we verified that the green function formalism successfully reproduces the scl and lcl predictions for the expected nuclear attenuation in dy pair production off nuclei in the corresponding kinematic regimes .",
    "besides , we took into account additional shadowing corrections which come from the higher fock fluctuations containing gluons ( gs effect ) .",
    "the latter become relevant at large energies and at forward rapidities when the corresponding cl for the higher @xmath121 fock state is comparable or exceeds the nuclear radius .",
    "besides the shadowing effects , we included also the isi effects affecting considerably the nucleus - to - proton ratio @xmath4 at forward rapidities ( or large feynman @xmath9 ) . including the shadowing and isi effects and using the green function technique",
    ", we obtained a rather good description of available data from the fixed - target fnal e772 and e886 experiments for the nuclear modification factor as a function of the @xmath21-variable and dilepton invariant mass .",
    "we have also made the corresponding predictions at rhic energy @xmath123 gev . finally , we considered the kinematic regions expected to be probed by the planned after@lhc experiment as well as by the lhcb collaboration in recent studies of fixed - target proton - gas collisions . in all these cases",
    ", we have analysed the nuclear shadowing and isi effects as the main sources of nuclear suppression of dy pairs that can possibly be verified by future rhic and lhc measurements .",
    "finally , we would like to point out that the dy process off nuclei is especially convenient for a clean phenomenological study of the isi effects since for this process the nuclear coherence can be consistently eliminated by turning to large values of the dilepton invariant mass where the net isi effect is pronounced .",
    "this is in contrast to other high - energy reactions on nuclear targets where one can only probe the cl - isi mixing .",
