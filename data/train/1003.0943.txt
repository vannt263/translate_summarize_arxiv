    "the parallel chip - firing game or candy - passing game is a periodic automaton on graphs in which vertices , each of which contains some nonnegative number of chips , `` fire '' exactly one chip to each of their neighbors if possible .",
    "formally , let @xmath4 be an undirected graph with vertex set @xmath5 and edge set @xmath6 . define the _ parallel chip - firing game _ on @xmath4 to be an automaton governed by the following rules :    * at the beginning of the game , @xmath7 chips are placed on each vertex @xmath8 in @xmath4 , where @xmath7 is a nonnegative integer .",

    "such a vertex is referred to as _ firing _ ; otherwise , it is _ non - firing_. all vertices fire simultaneously ( in parallel ) .",
    "we employ the notation of levine @xcite .",
    "let @xmath11 denote the step operator ; that is , @xmath12 is the position resulting after one step is performed on @xmath9 .",

    "we refer to @xmath15 as the position occurring _",
    "after @xmath16 steps_. for simplicity , we limit our discussion to connected graphs",
    ".    as the number of chips and number of vertices are both finite , there are a finite number of positions in this game .",
    "additionally , since each position completely determines the next position , it follows that for each initial position @xmath9 , there exist some positive integers @xmath17 such that for large enough @xmath18 , @xmath19 .",
    "we refer to the minimal such @xmath17 as the _ period _ @xmath20 of @xmath9 , and we refer to the set @xmath21 as one period of @xmath9 . also , we call the minimal such @xmath18 the _ transient length",
    "_ @xmath22 of @xmath9 .",
    "the parallel chip - firing game was introduced by bitar and goles @xcite in 1992 as a special case of the general chip - firing game posited by bjrner , lovsz , and shor @xcite in 1991 .",
    "they @xcite showed that the period of any position on a tree graph is 1 or 2 . in 2008 ,",
    "kominers and kominers @xcite further showed that all connected graphs satisfying @xmath23 have period 1 ; they further established a polynomial bound for the transient length of positions on such graphs .",
    "their result @xcite that the set of all `` abundant '' vertices @xmath24 with @xmath25 stabilizes is particularly useful in simplifying the game .",
    "it was conjectured by bitar @xcite that @xmath26 for all games on all graphs @xmath4 . however , kiwi et .",
    "@xcite constructed a graph on which there existed a position whose period was at least @xmath27 , disproving the conjecture .",
    "still , it is thought that excluding particular graphs constructed to force long periods , most graphs still have periods that are at most @xmath28 . in 2008 , levine @xcite proved this for the complete graph @xmath1 .",
    "the parallel chip - firing game is a special case of the more general chip - firing game , in which at each step , a vertex is chosen to fire .",
    "the general chip - firing game , in turn , is an example of an _ abelian sandpile _ @xcite , and has been shown to have deep connections in number theory , algebra , and combinatorics , ranging from elliptic curves @xcite to the critical group of a graph @xcite to the tutte polynomial @xcite .",
    "bitar and goles @xcite observed that the parallel chip - firing game has `` nontrivial computing capabilities , '' being able to simulate the and , not , and or gates of a classical computer ; later , goles and margenstern @xcite showed that it can simulate any two - register machine , and therefore solve any theoretically solvable computational problem .",
    "finally , the parallel chip - firing game can be used to simulate a pile of particles that falls whenever there are too many particles stacked at any point ; this important problem in statistical physics is often referred to as the _ deterministic fixed - energy sandpile _ @xcite .",
    "the fixed - energy sandpile , in turn , is a subset of the more general study of the so - called _ spatially extended dynamical systems _",
    ", which occur frequently in the physical sciences and even economics @xcite .",
    "such systems demonstrate the phenomenon of _ self - organized criticality _ , tending towards a `` critical state '' in which slight perturbations in initial position cause large , avalanche - like disturbances .",
    "self - organized critical models such as the abelian sandpile tend to display properties of real - life systems , such as @xmath29 noise , fractal patterns , and power law distribution @xcite .",
    "finally , the parallel chip - firing game is an example of a cellular automaton , the study of which have implications from biology to social science .      in section 2",
    ", we establish some lemmas about parallel chip - firing games on general simple connected graphs . we bound the number of chips on any single vertex in games with nontrivial period , define the notion of a complement position @xmath30 of @xmath9 and show that it has the same behavior as @xmath9 , and find a necessary and sufficient condition for a period to occur .",
    "then , in section 3 , we find , with proof , every possible period for the complete bipartite graph @xmath31 .",
    "we do so by first showing the only possible periods are of length @xmath32 or @xmath33 for @xmath34 , and then constructing games with such periods , proving our main result . finally , in section 4 , we construct positions on the complete @xmath2-partite graph @xmath35 with period @xmath17 for all @xmath36 .",

    "a step of the parallel chip - firing game on @xmath4 is then defined as follows :    @xmath40    define a _ terminating _ position to be a position in which no vertices fire after finitely many moves .",
    "we begin our investigation by proving some lemmas limiting the number of chips on each vertex in a game with nontrivial period ( period greater than 1 ) .",

    "they then showed that if , after sufficiently many steps @xmath18 , there still exists a vertex @xmath8 with @xmath45 , then all vertices must be firing from that step onward . since the period of a position is 1 if and only if either all or no vertices in @xmath4 are firing @xcite , @xmath46 is true for any game on @xmath4 with nontrivial period and sufficiently large @xmath18 .",
    "we further bound the number of chips on each vertex by generalizing a result of levine @xcite :    [ lem : confined ] consider a vertex @xmath8 in position @xmath9 such that @xmath47 .",

    "@xmath56    if a vertex @xmath8 satisfies @xmath57 , we call it _ confined_.",

    "we generally limit our discussion to confined positions to exclude positions with trivial periods .",
    "next , we define @xmath62 to be the indicator function of whether a vertex @xmath8 fires at step @xmath18 .",
    "we prove a lemma about positions that are equivalent , or have the same behavior , when acted upon by the step operator @xmath11 .",

    "we begin by noticing that since @xmath9 is confined , each vertex @xmath8 has at most @xmath66 chips , so each vertex in @xmath30 has a nonnegative number of chips .",
    "observe that a vertex @xmath8 fires in @xmath30 exactly when it did not fire in @xmath9 .",
    "hence , @xmath67 , and all but @xmath37 neighbors will fire in @xmath68 .",
    "so @xmath69    this lemma means we may treat @xmath9 and @xmath30 as equivalent positions , as at any point during their firing , we may transform one into the other .",
    "this implies the following corollary :    for all positions @xmath9 on @xmath4 , @xmath70 .",
    "next , we prove a proposition that characterizes a period of the game on any connected graph @xmath4 . for each position @xmath9 and",

    "let @xmath88 and @xmath89 denote the number of vertices in @xmath83 and @xmath84 , respectively , that fire in @xmath9 .",

    "hence ,    @xmath102    next , we prove a lemma that bounds the number of times a vertex has fired once the position is confined .",

    "the base case , @xmath107 , is straightforward : vertices @xmath8 and @xmath38 have each fired either 0 or 1 times . if @xmath8 fires after step @xmath108 , then @xmath109 chips , and @xmath38 also fires .",
    "now , assume @xmath110    if @xmath111 , then by equation , @xmath112 @xmath113    thus , if @xmath8 is ready to fire after step @xmath18 , then @xmath38 must be ready to fire also .",

    "our numerical experiments have also verified this conjecture for cycle graphs and complete @xmath32-partite graphs ; in fact , my correspondence with zhai @xcite has produced a proof of this conjecture for the cycle graph .",
    "another interesting direction to pursue is observing the implications of `` reducing '' the parallel chip - firing game by removing as many chips as possible from each vertex without affecting their firing pattern ( without changing @xmath156 for all @xmath42 and @xmath306 ) .",
    "this reduction may simplify some games into being more approachable by induction .    besides studying period lengths of parallel chip - firing games , an examination of the transient length of games on certain graphs would be useful in modeling real - world phenomena .",
    "studying transient positions would also help uncover what attributes determine whether a position is within a period or not , and bounding the transient length would make for more efficient computation of the period length of games on complex graphs .",
    "chip - firing games on lattices and tori have been used as cellular automaton models of the deterministic fixed - energy sandpile ( see @xcite ) .",
    "since most studies of sandpiles have been concerned with asymptotic measures such as the `` activity , '' bounding the period length of such models could serve as a measure of the fidelity of the model to the real world .",

    "<S> the parallel chip - firing game is a periodic automaton on graphs in which vertices `` fire '' chips to their neighbors . in 1989 , bitar conjectured that the period of a parallel chip - firing game with @xmath0 vertices is at most @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> though this conjecture was disproven in 1994 by kiwi et .  </S>",
    "<S> al . </S>",
    "<S> , it has been proven for particular classes of graphs , specifically trees ( bitar and goles , 1992 ) and the complete graph @xmath1 ( levine , 2008 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we prove bitar s conjecture for complete bipartite graphs and characterize completely all possible periods for positions of the parallel chip - firing game on such graphs . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we extend our construction of all possible periods for games on the bipartite graph to games on complete @xmath2-partite graphs , @xmath3 , and prove some pertinent lemmas about games on general simple connected graphs .    tian - yi jiang </S>"
