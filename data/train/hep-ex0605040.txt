    "rare and forbidden charm decays : * the standard model predicts vanishingly small branching ratios for processes such as @xmath216 which is gim suppressed .",
    "rare decays of charmed mesons and baryons provide `` background - free '' probes of new physics effects that enhance rare or allow forbidden processes such as lepton flavor violation ( @xmath217 ) and lepton number violation ( @xmath218 ) .",
    "current limits are @xmath219 to @xmath220 and are limited by statistics . limits from besiii will improve to @xmath221 to @xmath222@xcite .",
    "it is noteworthy that long distance dynamics can generate some of these final states even within the sm such as @xmath223 , @xmath224 . in these cases distinguishing np from sm contributions",
    "will be a challenge .",
    "the absolute scale for charm baryon decays decays is not well determined . to date",
    ", the measurements of the charm baryon absolute rate are model dependent .",
    "the decay mode used to normalize all other decay rates is @xmath225 but it is only known to be @xmath226@xcite .",
    "prospects for improving this situation are poor without data taken near @xmath227 threshold where a modest amount data , 20  fb@xmath13 , could measure @xmath228 to within 1% of itself .",
    "semileptonic decays of charm baryons are also of interest to test our theoretical understanding of form factors .",
    "measuring @xmath229 is important for understanding of @xmath230 fragmentation and the study of @xmath231 which is usually studied in @xmath232 , @xmath233 .",
    "current questions in @xmath3 , open charm and charmonium have been summarized . for @xmath3 physics",
    "there is no compelling reason to run near threshold .",
    "charmonium data samples will increase by several orders of magnitude before a 2011 as besiii carries out it physics program .",
    "it is difficult to forecast what questions will remain and new question arise in this area .",
    "although isr from @xmath8  gev renders an @xmath115 scan unneccessary , the capability to study charm hybrids and charmonium above open charm threshold with direct production is desireable . using open charm produced near threshold to improve the precision of ckm parameters determined by babar , belle",
    ", cleo - c and besiii will require theoretical advances .",
    "searches for @xmath22-mixing , @xmath42 violation charm and rare charm decays are driven by statistics .",
    "the enormous @xmath9 and charm samples available at a super flavor factory at @xmath8  gev partially mitigate the need for charm threshold data . however , there are many advantages to running at threshold such as lower backgrounds , lower multiplicity , increased kinematical constraints and quantum coherence .",
    "thus , it is prudent to design the super flavor factory machine and detector with the flexibility to operate effetively with center - of - mass energies ranging from @xmath25 to @xmath12(5s ) . more work is required and is ongoing to determine whether the benefit of charm threshold running is worth the cost and effort .",
