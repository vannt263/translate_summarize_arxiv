    "the networks of interacting genes and proteins that are responsible for regulation , signalling and response , and which , ultimately , orchestrate cell function , are under the effect of noise @xcite .",
    "this randomness materialises in the form of fluctuations of the number of molecules of the species involved , subsequently leading to fluctuations in their activity . besides external perturbations",
    ", biochemical reactions can be intrinsically noisy , especially when the number of molecules is very low .",
    "far from necessarily being a mere disturbance , fluctuations are an essential component of the dynamics of cellular regulatory systems which , in many instances , are exploited to improve cell function @xcite . for example",
    ", randomness has been shown to enhance the ability of cells to adapt and increase their fitness in random or variable environments @xcite .",
    "random noise also serves the purpose of assisting cell populations to sustain phenotypic variation by enabling cells to explore the phase space @xcite .",
    "one of the mechanisms that allows noise - induced phenotypic variability relays on multi - stability @xcite .",
    "the basis of this mechanism was first proposed by kauffman @xcite , who associated phenotypes or differentiated states to the stable attractors of the dynamical systems associated to gene and protein interaction networks . in the presence of noise",
    ", the corresponding phase space generates an epigenetic landscape , where cells exposed to the same environment and signalling cues coexist in different cellular phenotypes @xcite .",
    "multi - stability is also an essential element in the control of cell response and function via signalling pathways @xcite . in particular , bi - stability as a means to generate reliable switching behaviour is widely utilised in numerous pathways such as the apoptosis @xcite , cell survival @xcite , differentiation @xcite , and cell - cycle progression @xcite pathways .",
    "for example , bi - stability is used to regulate such critical cell functions such as the transition from quiescence to proliferation through bistable behaviour associated with the rb - e2f switch within the regulatory machinery of the mammalian cell - cycle @xcite .    a common theme which appears when trying to model cell regulatory systems is separation of time scales , i.e. the presence of multiple processes evolving on widely diverse time scales .",
    "when noise is ignored and systems are treated in terms of deterministic mean - field descriptions , such separation of time scales and the associated slow - fast dynamics are often exploited for several forms of model reduction , of which one of the most common is the so - called quasi - steady state approximation ( qssa ) @xcite .",
    "this approximation is ubiquitously used whenever regulatory processes involve enzyme catalysis , which is a central regulation mechanism in cell function @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we investigate the effects of intrinsic noise on the bi - stability of two particular systems , namely , an enzyme - catalysed system of mutual inhibition and a gene regulatory circuit with self - activation . the mean - field limit of both these systems has been shown to exhibit bi - stability @xcite . the aim of this paper is to analyse how noise alters the mean - field behaviour associated to these systems when they operate under quasi - steady state conditions .",
    "we note that this work does not concern the subject of noise - induced bifurcations @xcite .",
    "such phenomenon has been studied in many situations , including biological systems .",
    "an example which is closely related to the systems we analyse here is the so - called enzymatic futile cycles .",
    "samoilov et al .",
    "@xcite have shown that noise associated to the number of enzymes induce bistability . in the absence of this source of noise ,",
    "i.e. in the mean - field limit , the system does not exhibit bistable behaviour .",
    "the treatment of this phenomena would require to go to higher orders in the wkb expansion , which we do not explore here .",
    "the issue of separation of time scales in stochastic models of enzyme catalysis has been addressed using a number of different approaches .",
    "several such analysis have been carried out in which the qssa is directly applied to the master equation by setting the fast reactions in partial equilibrium ( i.e. the probability distribution corresponding to the fast variables remains unchanged ) , and letting the rest of the system to evolve according to a reduced stochastic dynamic @xcite .",
    "other approaches have been proposed such as the qssa to the exact fokker - planck equation that can be derived from the poisson representation of the chemical master equation @xcite .",
    "approaches based on enumeration techniques have also been formulated @xcite .",
    "furthermore , thomas et al.@xcite have recently formulated a rigorous method to eliminate fast stochastic variables in monostable systems using projector operators within the linear noise approximation @xcite .",
    "methods for model reduction based on perturbation analysis have been developed in @xcite .",
    "additionally , driven by the need of more efficient numerical methods , there has been much activity regarding the development of numerical methods for stochastic systems with multiple time - scales @xcite .",
    "several of these methods are variations of the stochastic simulation algorithm @xcite or the @xmath0-leap method @xcite where the existence of fast and slow variables is exploited to enhance their performance with respect to the standard algorithms .",
    "another family of such numerical methods is that of the so - called hybrid methods , where classical deterministic rate equations or stochastic langevin equations for the fast variables are combined with the classical stochastic simulation algorithm for the slow variables @xcite .",
    "other related methods were studied in @xcite .    here , we advance the formalism developed in @xcite , in which a method based on the semi - classical approximation of the chemical master equation allows to evaluate the effects of intrinsic random noise under quasi - steady conditions . in our analysis of the michaelis - menten model of enzyme catalysis in @xcite",
    ", we showed that the semi - classical quasi - steady state approximation reveals that the velocity of the enzymatic reaction is modified with respect to the mean - field estimate by a quantity which is proportional to the total number of molecules of the ( conserved ) enzyme . in this paper , we extend this formalism to show that , associated to each conserved molecular species , the associated ( constant ) number of molecules is a bifurcation parameter which can drive the system into bi - stability beyond the predictions of the mean - field theory .",
    "we then proceed to test our theoretical results by means of direct numerical simulation of the chemical master equation using the stochastic simulation algorithm @xcite .",
    "we should note the hamiltonian formalism derived from the semi - classical approximation is formulated on a continuum of particles , which requires the number of particles to be large enough .",
    "this must hold true for all the species in our model , both fast and slow . since this separation between fast and slow species is based on their relative abundance , one must be careful that the scaling assumptions are consistent , particularly in the case of the model of self - activating gene regulatory circuit where the number of binding sites is typically small .",
    "this assumption , however , has been used in previous studies @xcite .",
    "also we show that our simulation results of the full stochastic processes agree with our analysis and , therefore , our re - scaled equations are able to predict the behaviour of the system .",
    "we note that the mean - field limit , which is conventionally obtained by ignoring noise in the limit of large particle numbers , is obtained by setting the momenta in our phase - space formalism to @xmath1 .",
    "the approximation we develop in this paper falls within the general framework of the optimal fluctuation path theory @xcite .",
    "this framework is a particular case of the large deviation theory which allows us to study rare events ( i.e. events whose frequency is exponentially small with system size ) . within these framework",
    "we will show that , upon carrying out the qssa , the only source of noise in the system is associated to the random initial conditions of the species whose numbers are conserved .",
    "we therefore predict that a population of cells , each having a random number of conserved molecules , will have a bimodal distribution .",
    "this paper is organised as follows .",
    "section 2 is devoted to a detailed exposition of the semi - classical quasi - steady state approximation for stochastic systems . in sections 3 and 4",
    ", we apply this formalism to analyse the behaviour of a bistable enzyme - catalysed system and a gene regulatory circuit of auto - activation , respectively .",
    "we will show that our semi - classical quasi - steady state theory allows us to study the effect of intrinsic noise on the behaviour of these systems beyond the predictions of their mean - field descriptions .",
    "we also verify our theoretical predictions by means of direct stochastic simulations . finally in section 5 ,",
    "we summarise our results and discuss their relevance .",
    "our aim in this paper is to formulate a stochastic generalisation of the quasi - steady state approximation for enzyme - catalysed reactions and simple circuits of gene regulation and use such approximation to determine if the presence of noise has effects on the behaviour of the system beyond the predictions of the corresponding mean - field models .",
    "specifically , we analyse stochastic systems for which the mean - field models predicts bi - stability and investigate how such behaviour is affected by stochastic effects . our analysis is carried out in the context of markovian models of the corresponding reaction mechanisms formulated in terms of the so - called chemical master equation ( cme ) @xcite .",
    "two example of such stochastic systems , a bistable enzyme - catalysed system and a gene regulatory circuit of auto - activation , are formulated and analysed in detail in sections [ sec : enzyme ] and [ sec : gene ] , respectively .",
    "following @xcite , we formulate the qss approximation for the asymptotic solution of the cme obtained by means of large deviations / wkb approximations @xcite .",
    "the cme is given :    @xmath2    where @xmath3 is the transition rate corresponding to reaction channel @xmath4 and @xmath5 is a vector whose entries denote the change in the number of molecules of each molecular species when reaction channel @xmath4 fires up , i.e. @xmath6 .    an alternative way to analyse the dynamics of continuous - time markov processes on a discrete space of states is to derive an equation for the generating function , @xmath7 of the corresponding probabilistic density :    @xmath8    where @xmath9 is the solution of the master equation ( [ eq : cme ] ) .",
    "@xmath7 satisfies a partial differential equation ( pde ) which can be derived from the master equation .",
    "this pde is the basic element of the so - called momentum representation of the master equation @xcite .",
    "although closed , analytic solutions are rarely available , the pde for the generating function admits a perturbative solution , which is commonly obtained by means of the wkb method @xcite .",
    "more specifically , the ( linear ) pde that governs the evolution of the generating function can be written as :    @xmath10    where the operator @xmath11 is determined by the reaction rates of the master equation ( [ eq : cme ] ) .",

    "<S> we analyse the effect of intrinsic fluctuations on the properties of bistable stochastic systems with time scale separation operating under1 quasi - steady state conditions . </S>",
    "<S> we first formulate a stochastic generalisation of the quasi - steady state approximation based on the semi - classical approximation of the partial differential equation for the generating function associated with the chemical master equation . </S>",
    "<S> such approximation proceeds by optimising an action functional whose associated set of euler - lagrange ( hamilton ) equations provide the most likely fluctuation path . </S>",
    "<S> we show that , under appropriate conditions granting time scale separation , the hamiltonian can be re - scaled so that the set of hamilton equations splits up into slow and fast variables , whereby the quasi - steady state approximation can be applied . </S>",
    "<S> we analyse two particular examples of systems whose mean - field limit has been shown to exhibit bi - stability : an enzyme - catalysed system of two mutually - inhibitory proteins and a gene regulatory circuit with self - activation . </S>",
    "<S> our theory establishes that the number of molecules of the conserved species are order parameters whose variation regulates bistable behaviour in the associated systems beyond the predictions of the mean - field theory . </S>",
    "<S> this prediction is fully confirmed by direct numerical simulations using the stochastic simulation algorithm . </S>",
    "<S> this result allows us to propose strategies whereby , by varying the number of molecules of the three conserved chemical species , cell properties associated to bistable behaviour ( phenotype , cell - cycle status , etc . ) </S>",
    "<S> can be controlled . </S>"
