    "in this paper , we give a quantum circuit for calculating the mean value of a function @xmath0 , where @xmath5 .",
    "classical algorithms for calculating the mean value of a structureless function @xmath2 take @xmath3 steps .",
    "our quantum algorithm is based on the original grover s algorithm ( see ref.@xcite ) or some variant thereof ( such as afga , described in ref.@xcite ) , and it takes @xmath4 steps .",
    "previous papers ( see refs.@xcite ) have proposed algorithms for finding the mean value of a function via grover s algorithm .",
    "our algorithm differs significantly from theirs .",
    "one big difference is that our algorithm encodes the final answer in the amplitude of a state whereas theirs encodes it in the quantum numbers of a state .",
    "a good analogy is to say that we use something akin to amplitude modulation ( am radio , where the signal is encoded in the amplitude ) whereas they use something akin to frequency modulation ( fm radio , where the signal is encoded in the frequencies ) .",
    "this paper assumes that the reader has already read most of ref.@xcite by tucci .",
    "reading that previous paper is essential to understanding this one because this paper applies am techniques ( what we call targeting two hypotheses and blind targeting ) described in that previous paper .",
    "most of the notation that will be used in this paper has already been explained in previous papers by tucci .",
    "see , in particular , sec.2 ( entitled  notation and preliminaries \" ) of ref.@xcite .",
    "in this section , we will give a quantum circuit for calculating the mean value of a probability amplitude @xmath2 where @xmath5 .",
    "our algorithm can also be used to find the mean value of more general functions using the method given in appendix c of ref.@xcite .",
    "we will assume that we know how to compile @xmath9 ( i.e. , that we can construct it starting from @xmath10 using a sequence of elementary operations .",
    "elementary operations are operations that act on a few ( usually 1,2 or 3 ) qubits at a time , such as qubit rotations and cnots . )",
    "multiplexor techniques for doing such compilations are discussed in ref.@xcite .",
    "if @xmath6 is very large , our algorithm will be useless unless such a compilation is of polynomial efficiency , meaning that its number of elementary operations grows as poly(@xmath6 ) .",
    "our method for calculating the mean value of @xmath14 consists of applying the algorithm afga to a target state @xmath15 .",
    "] of ref.@xcite in the way that was described in ref.@xcite , using the techniques of targeting two hypotheses and blind targeting . as in ref.@xcite ,",
    "when we apply afga in this section , we will use a sufficient target @xmath16 .",
    "all that remains for us to do to fully specify our circuit for calculating the mean value of @xmath14 is to give a circuit for generating @xmath17 .",
    "note also that for this method of finding the mean value of @xmath2 to work well , @xmath27 and @xmath28 must be of  comparable \" size , for if @xmath29 , then , by eq.([eq - z1-z0-again ] ) , @xmath30 , and it will take an unreasonable amount of time to get a bunch of null events . of course , the circuit for generating @xmath17 can be changed easily so that @xmath25 is proportional to @xmath31 instead of @xmath28 , where @xmath32 is any element of @xmath33 .",
