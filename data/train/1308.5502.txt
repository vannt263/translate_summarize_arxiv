    "the usual task in quantum tomography is to determine an unknown quantum state from measurement outcome statistics .",
    "there are two obvious ways to vary this setting .",
    "first , our task need not be the determination of any possible input state but only some states belonging to a restricted subset of all states .",
    "second , we typically have some prior information , or premise , which tells us that the input state belongs to some subset of states .",
    "it is clear that with this additional information and restricted task , this problem should be easier than the problem of determing an unknown quantum state without any prior information . as an example , consider the usual optical homodyne tomography of a single mode electromagnetic field @xcite .",
    "if the state is completely unknown , then , in principle , one needs to measure infinitely many rotated field quadratures @xcite . however , as soon as one knows that the state can be represented as a finite matrix in the photon number basis , then already finitely many quadratures are enough , the exact number depending on the size of the matrix @xcite .",
    "it should be emphasized that the premise is not merely a mathematical assumption but carries also physical meaning .",
    "indeed , it simply means that the probability of detecting energies above a certain bound is zero . since one might expect that also in general a given task and premise leads to the requirement of less or worse resources ,",
    "an immediate question is the characterization of these resources .",
    "the task and the premise can be described as subsets of the set of all states , hence this modified setting is specified by two subsets @xmath0 ( task ) and @xmath1 ( premise ) of all states .",
    "clearly , we must have @xmath2 to make the formulation meaningful .",
    "smaller @xmath0 means less demanding determination task and smaller @xmath1 means better prior knowledge . in this work",
    "we study the previously explained question from the point of view of quantum observables , mathematically described as positive operator valued measures ( povms ) . a quantum observable",
    "is called _ informationally complete _ if the measurement outcome probabilities uniquely determine each state @xcite , and this clearly relates to the usual task in quantum tomography . the previously described generalized setting leads to the concept of _ @xmath3-informational completeness_. we present a general formulation of this property , and then concentrate on some interesting special cases .",
    "our main results are related to situations when the premise tells that the rank of the input state is bounded by some number @xmath4 , and the task is then to determine all states with rank @xmath5 or less .",
    "we show , in particular , that if there is no premise and the task is to determine all states with rank less than or equal to @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the dimension of the hilbert space of the quantum system , then we actually need an informationally complete observable .",
    "perhaps the most important informationally complete observables are covariant phase space observables .",
    "these are widely used in both finite and infinite dimensional quantum mechanics .",
    "however , not all covariant phase space observables are informationally complete , and for instance noise can easily destroy this desired property .",
    "we will show that even if a covariant phase space observable fails to be informationally complete , it can be @xmath3-informationally complete for some meaningful sets @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
