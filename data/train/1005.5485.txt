    "recent advances in chemical synthesis have unveiled more and more the importance of soft - matter systems , such as dispersions of colloidal particles , polymers , and their combinations . besides their practical interest",
    ", these new developments have opened up new theoretical avenues in ( at least ) two instances .",
    "firstly , it is possible to experimentally fine - tune the details of interactions ( range , strength ,  ) , making these systems a unique laboratory for testing highly simplified models within an effective - interaction approach where the microscopic degrees of freedom are integrated out in favor of renormalized macroparticle interactions .",
    "secondly , they offer the possibility of exploring new types of equilibrium phase behaviors not present in the simple - fluid paradigm .",
    "as early as in 1989 , marquest and witten@xcite suggested that the experimentally observed crystallization in some copolymer micellar systems could be rationalized on the basis of a bounded interaction , that is , an interaction that does not diverge at the origin .",
    "successive theoretical work showed that this class of bounded or ultra - soft potentials naturally arises as effective interactions between the centers of mass of many soft and flexible macromolecules , such as polymer chains , dendrimers , star polymers , etc .",
    "( see , e.g. , ref .   for a reference on the subject ) .",
    "two well - studied cases belonging to the above class are the gaussian core model ( gcm ) introduced by stillinger@xcite and the penetrable - sphere ( ps ) model introduced in refs .  , whose freezing transition turns out to display rather exotic features with no analogue in the atomistic fluid realm .    in the present paper",
    ", we shall consider a close relative of the ps model , first introduced in ref .",
    ", denoted as the penetrable - square - well ( psw ) model , where a short - range attractive tail is added to the ps model just outside the core region . in the limit of infinite repulsive energy ,",
    "the ps and psw models reduce to the usual hard - sphere ( hs ) and square - well ( sw ) models , respectively .",
    "an additional interesting feature common to both ps and psw , as well as to all bounded potentials , is the fact that , even when confined to one - dimensional systems , they may exhibit a non - trivial phase diagram due to the penetrability which prevents an exact analytical solution .",
    "this is because particles can not be lined up on a line with a well - defined and fixed ordering in view of the possibility of reciprocal interpenetration ( with some positive energy cost ) , thus lacking an essential ingredient allowing for an exact solution in the respective hard - core counterparts ( hs and sw ) .",
    "it is then particularly useful to discuss some motivated approximations in the one - dimensional model which can then be benchmarked against numerical simulations and subsequently exploited in the much more complex three - dimensional case .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to complete a study on the one - dimensional psw model started in refs .  , as well as the general results presented in ref .   which are particularly relevant in the present context",
    "in the first paper of the series,@xcite we introduced the model and discussed the range of stability in terms of the attractive versus repulsive energy scale .",
    "we provided , in addition , exact analytical results in the low - density limit ( second order in the radial distribution function and fourth order in the virial expansion ) and a detailed study of the percus  yevick and hypernetted - chain integral equations .",
    "these were used in the following paper@xcite to propose a low - penetrability approximation at finite density which was then tested against numerical simulation .",
    "this low - penetrability approximation is expected to break down in the opposite regime , namely when temperatures and densities are such that particles easily interpenetrate each other . in the present paper , we address this latter regime by proposing a complementary approximation ( the high - penetrability approximation ) and discussing its range of validity and the relationship with the low - penetrability regime .",
    "note that a similar matching of the low- and high - penetrability approximation has already been carried out by two of the present authors in the framework of the ps model.@xcite it turns out that the high - penetrability approximation in the context of bounded potentials coincides with the linearized debye ",
    "hckel classical approximation originally introduced in the framework of the coulomb potential.@xcite it has been recently shown@xcite that two of the three standard routes to thermodynamics ( the energy and the virial routes ) are automatically consistent within the linearized debye  hckel approximation , for any potential and dimensionality .",
    "this means that a deviation from the third standard route to thermodynamics ( the compressibility route ) can be exploited to assess the degree of reliability of the high - penetrability ( or linearized debye ",
    "hckel ) approximation .",
    "this is indeed discussed in the present paper , where we also discuss the full hierarchy of approximations ranging from the full debye ",
    "hckel approximation to the simplest mean - spherical approximation .    in view of the boundness of the potential",
    ", the usual van hove no - go theorem@xcite on the absence of phase transitions in certain one - dimensional fluids does not hold .",
    "it is then natural to ask whether a phase transition occurs in the one - dimensional psw fluid by noting that the addition of an attractive tail to the pair potential of the ps model extends the question to the fluid - fluid transition , in addition to the fluid - solid transition possible even within the ps model . in the present paper",
    "we confine our attention to the fluid - fluid case only and discuss this possibility using both analytical arguments and state - of - the - art numerical simulations.@xcite our results are compatible with the absence of such a transition , as we shall discuss .",
    "this is also supported by recent analytical results@xcite using a methodology devised for one - dimensional models with long - range interactions.@xcite we discuss possible reasons for this and a plausible scenario for the three - dimensional case .",
    "finally , we note that the approach to a critical point is frequently anticipated by the so - called fisher ",
    "widom line@xcite marking the borderline between a region with oscillatory behavior in the long - range domain of the correlation function ( above the fisher  widom line ) and a region of exponential decay .",
    "we discuss the location of this line within the high - penetrability approximation and again the matching of this result with that stemming from the low - penetrability approximation .",

    "[ sec : rhpa ] we discuss some approximations related to it .",

    "the penetrable - square - well ( psw ) model is defined by the following pair potential@xcite @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the well width and @xmath2 and @xmath3 are two positive constants accounting for the repulsive and attractive parts of the potential , respectively . in the following , we shall restrict our analysis to the case @xmath4 and @xmath5 , where we know the one - dimensional model to be stable with a well defined thermodynamic limit.@xcite it is shown in appendix [ app : ruelle ] that , more generally , the one - dimensional psw model is guaranteed to be stable if @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the integer part of @xmath8 . for lower values of @xmath2 the model may or may not be stable and we will come back to this point in section [ sec : fw ] .",

    ".    a detailed discussion of the limiting cases of the psw model can be found in ref .  .",

    "in ref .   we discussed a low - penetrability approximation ( lpa ) to the psw model . within this approximation , one assumes @xmath26 so that the repulsive barrier @xmath2 is sufficiently higher than the thermal energy @xmath27 , penetrability is small , and the system is almost a hard - core one .",
    "the advantage of this theoretical scheme is that one can use the general recipe leading to the exact solution for the one - dimensional sw problem in fact , valid for any potential with a hard core and short - range attractions and perform some ad hoc adjustments to ensure that some basic physical conditions on the radial distribution function @xmath28 are satisfied .",
    "comparison with monte carlo ( mc ) simulations showed a good behavior of the lpa even for @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) , provided the density was moderate ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "the opposite limit @xmath32 is also inherently interesting for several reasons . from a physical viewpoint",
    "this amounts to starting from the ideal gas limit @xmath33 ( one of the common reference systems for simple fluids ) and progressively building up interactions by increasing @xmath34 .",
    "an additional mathematical advantage stems from the simple observation@xcite that in the ( exact ) cluster expansion of @xmath28 only the dominant chain diagrams need to be retained at all orders , thus leading to the possibility of an exact summation of those leading contributions . as we shall see",
    "shortly , this is in fact a procedure known as the debye ",

    "this completes the calculation of the correlation functions within the hpa .",
    "as anticipated in section [ sec : hpa ] , the hpa is the exact equivalent to the well - known ldh approximation , which is widely used in the context of charged simple fluids.@xcite the latter is actually an intermediate step of a hierarchy of successive approximations ranging from the simplest mean - spherical approximation ( msa ) to the full non - linear version of the debye ",
    "hckel approximation ( see ref .  [ 11 ] in ref .   for a discussion on this point ) . for the psw model",
    "and more generally for any bounded potential the ldh approximation ( the hpa in the present language ) is particularly relevant in view of the fact that one can make @xmath17 arbitrarily small by letting @xmath58 , thus justifying the approximation of neglecting non - chain diagrams .",
    "it is then interesting to check the performance of the other approximations included in the aforementioned class , which will be translated in the present context for simplicity .    on top of the hierarchy of approximations",

    "it has been shown in ref .   that the virial and energy routes to thermodynamics ( to be discussed below ) are consistent one another within the hpa , for any potential and any dimensionality .",
    "a similar statement holds true for soft potentials within the msa.@xcite this clearly includes the psw potential in both cases .",
    "it is interesting to make contact with previous work carried out by likos et al .",

    "( [ rhpa : eq4 ] ) along with the spinodal instability to be discussed in detail in section [ sec : fw ] , have been introduced for a general class of unbounded potentials including the ps as a particular case .",
    "this has been further elaborated and extended to include the gcm in ref . .",
    "in both cases , the authors discuss directly the three - dimensional case , so that a direct comparison with the present work can not be drawn at the present stage , but they also provide a detailed discussion of various approximations , within the general framework of density functional theory , that provide a unified framework where even the present model could be included .",
    "given an approximate solution of a fluid model there are several routes to the equation of state which , in general , give different results .",
    "the most common are three:@xcite the virial , the compressibility , and the energy route .",
    "the consistency of the outcome of these different routes can be regarded as an assessment on the soundness of the approximation .",
    "for some particular approximations it may also happen that the consistency of two of the three routes are automatically enforced ( see ref .   and references therein for a detailed discussion on this point ) .",
    "this is the case of the hpa , where the virial and energy routes coincide , as anticipated .",
    "hence , the consistency with the compressibility route will provide a rough estimate of the regime of validity of the hpa within a phase diagram for the psw potential .",
    "let us briefly recall@xcite the methods to compute the compressibility factor , @xmath70 , associated with the three different routes .",

    "we remark that @xmath85 is not limited in values from above due to the boundness of the potential .",
    "the clear downturn of all three curves for sufficiently large reduced density @xmath85 is a consequence of the existence of a maximum density @xmath86 [ see eq .  ] , beyond which the hpa breaks down , as described at the end of appendix [ app : appa ] . in particular , the values of the maximum density for @xmath80 and @xmath81 are @xmath87 , @xmath88 , and @xmath89 at @xmath90 , @xmath91 , and @xmath92 , respectively , in agreement with fig .",

    "this is a line separating two different regimes for the large - distance behavior of the rdf @xmath28 in the presence of competing repulsive / attractive interactions.@xcite the rationale behind the fw line is that on approaching the critical points where attractions become more and more effective , the behavior of correlation functions must switch from oscillatory ( characteristic of repulsive interactions ) to exponential with a well defined correlation length @xmath133 . in the previous work",
    ", we analyzed the location of this line for psw within the lpa .",
    "here we extend this analysis to the hpa regime and discuss the compatibility of the two results .",
    "let us first briefly recall the main points of the analysis , referring to ref .   for details . from eq .",

    "according to eq .  , the poles of @xmath134 are given by @xmath135 let @xmath136 be the imaginary pole and @xmath137 be the pole with the imaginary part closest to the origin .",

    "it is more convenient to use @xmath139 rather than @xmath108 as a free parameter to construct the fw line . in that way , eq .   becomes a transcendental equation that gives @xmath140 as a function of @xmath139 ; once @xmath146 is known , the solution to eq .",

    "we further note that the spinodal line only has a lower density ( or vapor - like ) branch , thus hampering the interpretation of @xmath164 as a conventional critical point .",
    "the above features are already suggestive of considering the hpa spinodal line as an artifact of the theory when used in a region of parameter space where the approximation is invalid .",
    "additional support to this view stems from the fact that the hpa keeps predicting a spinodal line and a critical point even in the sw case ( @xmath165 , @xmath166 ) , a clearly incorrect feature . as we shall discuss further below , specialized numerical simulations coupled with a recent analytical study,@xcite strongly support the absence of any phase transition in the present one - dimensional psw model .",

    "is also included .",
    "as said above , the fw and spinodal lines meet at the critical point . while at high temperatures ( above @xmath121 ) there is a remarkable agreement between the two approximations ,",

    "note that while in the lpa the three routes to the pressure are not distinguishable one from the other on the graph scale , for the hpa the difference between the virial and the compressibility route is noticeable at low temperatures .",
    "[ fig : fig8 ] ]    as in the original work by fisher and widom,@xcite we also report the fw line in the @xmath169 vs @xmath97 plane ( see fig .  [ fig : fig8 ] ) , where again we compare the lines as derived from the hpa and lpa schemes . for the energy ratio @xmath167 ( top panel )",
    "we see that the hpa and the lpa give qualitative similar forms of the fw line with a significant deviation at low temperatures , where again the hpa fw line is interrupted at @xmath154 .",
    "note that , while all three standard routes give practically identical results within the lpa , the virial(-energy ) route in the hpa differs from the compressibility one at low temperatures ( more than @xmath102 for @xmath170 ) . for consistency ,",
    "the hpa spinodal line is obtained via the compressibility route only .",
    "similar features occur for the second lower value of the energy ratio , namely @xmath111 ( bottom panel ) .",
    "again , the lpa and hpa lines are qualitatively similar , the three routes in the lpa provide indistinguishable results , and the virial and energy routes in the hpa deviate more than @xmath102 for @xmath170 . the main distinctive feature in this case",
    "@xmath111 is a marked upswing of the tail of the fw line , absent the previous case @xmath167 .",
    "this means that , on increasing penetrability that is , on decreasing @xmath21 the transition from oscillatory ( above the line ) to monotonic ( below the line ) behaviors occurs at a higher pressure and a higher density for a fixed temperature @xmath108 .    despite the important differences in the steps followed to derive the lpa and the hpa , it is noteworthy that they agree in the qualitative shape of the fw lines ( even though the hpa predicts a spurious spinodal line ) .",
    "it is then reasonable to expect that the true fw line should interpolate the lpa line at low temperatures with the hpa line at high temperatures .",
    "finally , we now tackle the issue of the existence of a phase transition for the psw one - dimensional model . in view of the hpa results on the seemingly existence of a spinodal line ( and hence of a critical point ) , we here consider the fluid - fluid transition .",
    "as we shall see , our numerics is compatible with the absence of such a transition , thus supporting the view that the above findings of a spinodal line is indeed a consequence of the application of the hpa to a regime where the theory is not valid .",
    "as the fw line always anticipates the critical point , as remarked , we can then look for the existence of a fluid - fluid coexistence line in the region predicted by the interpolation of the lpa and hpa fisher  widom lines . we have carried out extensive simulations of the psw fluid using gibbs ensemble monte carlo techniques and employing all standard improvements suggested in the literature.@xcite in order to validate our code , we tested it against the case of the one - dimensional sw potential , where exact analytical predictions for all thermodynamic quantities are available .",
    "we have used up to @xmath171 particles and carefully scanned the temperature range @xmath172 and the density range @xmath173 , as suggested by the fw line ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : fig7 ] ) .",
    "we have also considered different values of @xmath21 and @xmath8 for cases giving a significant overlapping probability . in all the cases",
    "we have not found any signature of a fluid - fluid phase separation .",
    "although the _ absence _ of a critical transition is always much more difficult to assess as opposed to its presence , the first scenario is consistent with more than one indication .",
    "the first indication stems from a lattice model counterpart of the one - dimensional psw model .",
    "this is discussed in appendix [ app : appb ] , where the lattice version of the psw model is constructed following standard manipulations with the result that no phase transitions are present for _ finite occupancy_. an additional evidence supporting the absence of any fluid - fluid or freezing transition stems from the very recent exact analytical work alluded to earlier,@xcite that , using the methodology presented in ref .",
    ", concludes that _ no phase transitions _ are present for the psw and ps models in one dimension .     obtained from mc simulations for @xmath80 , @xmath174 , @xmath113 , and @xmath175 ( top panel ) and @xmath176 ( bottom panel ) .",
    "[ fig : blob ] ]    in our simulations we have also investigated values of @xmath21 and @xmath8 which violate ruelle s stability criterion ( see appendix [ app : ruelle ] ) and thus the one - dimensional psw model is not necessarily stable in the thermodynamic limit . here",
    "the phenomenology turns out to be much more interesting . for sufficiently low temperatures and sufficiently high densities",
    "we observe the formation of a `` blob '' of many - particle clusters ( each made of a large number of overlapping particles ) having a well defined and regular distribution on the axis , and occupying only a portion of the system length . in the `` blob ''",
    "phases the energy per particle grows with the number of particles , thus revealing the absence of a thermodynamic limit .",
    "the transition from a `` normal '' phase to a `` blob '' phase if @xmath177 , where @xmath7 is the integer part of @xmath8 , is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : blob ] .",
    "this figure shows the rdf at @xmath175 ( top panel ) and @xmath176 ( bottom panel ) for @xmath80 , @xmath174 , and @xmath113 . at the lower density",
    "the structure of the psw fluid is qualitatively not much different from that expected if @xmath178 ( compare , for instance , with fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] ) .",
    "however , the structure at the higher density is reminiscent of that of a solid , except that the distribution of particles does not span the whole length ( here @xmath179 ) . instead",
    ", the particles distribute into a few clusters regularly spaced with distance @xmath180 , so that the particles of a given cluster interact attractively with all the particles of the nearest- and next - nearest - neighbor clusters .",
    "note that the number of particles within any given cluster is not necessarily identical .",
    "it is also worth noticing that , in spite of the huge difference in the vertical scales of both panels in fig .",
    "[ fig : blob ] , they are consistent with the condition @xmath181 .    the decay of the peaks of @xmath28 is mainly due to the lack of translational invariance , i.e. , the first and last clusters have only one nearest - neighbor cluster , the first , second , next - to - last , and last clusters have only one next - nearest - neighbor cluster , and so on .",
    "we stress that the above phenomenon is specific of bounded potentials , such as psw , and has no counterpart in the hard - core domain .",
    "it is then plausible to expect their appearance even in the corresponding three - dimensional versions of these models where freezing transition ( and phase separation for sw ) are present but could both be hampered by the presence of this clustering phenomenon in the region of parameter space where ruelle s stability criterion is violated .",
    "this would extend the interesting phenomenology already established for the ps case @xcite .",
    "work along these lines on the three - dimensional case is underway and will be reported elsewhere .",
    "in this paper we have completed the study initiated in previous work@xcite on the penetrable - square - well model in one - dimension .",
    "this is a model combining the three main ingredients present in many colloidal - polymer solutions , namely repulsions , attractions , and penetrability .",
    "while the first two are ubiquitous even in simple fluids , the latter is a peculiarity of complex fluids where there exist many examples of colloid - polymer systems which are penetrable ( with some energy cost ) to some extent , and they involve both steric repulsions and short - range attractions .",
    "this model then captures all these crucial features at the simplest level of description within an implicit solvent description .    the main new point of this paper was to present an additional and complementary approximation , denoted as the hpa , valid in regimes complementary to those valid for the low - penetrability scheme lpa discussed in ref .  .",
    "while the idea behind the lpa was to modify the _ exact _ relations valid for the one - dimensional sw fluid and in fact for any fluid with a hard core and short - range attraction to allow penetrability within some reasonable approximation , the driving force behind the hpa is the fact that for bounded potential the mayer function can be made arbitrarily small by considering sufficiently high temperatures .",
    "as a consequence , only the linear chain diagrams need to be retained at each order in the cluster expansion . as it turns out,@xcite this is tantamount to considering the celebrated debye ",
    "hckel theory for charged fluids , and we have here considered the soundness of this approximations at various regimes as compared to specialized mc simulations .",
    "the latter were also compared with other approximations which parallel the entire hierarchy of approximations in the framework of charged fluids , ranging from the most sophisticated non - linear debye ",
    "hckel to the simplest mean - spherical approximations .",
    "we have assessed the regime of reliability of these approximations both for thermodynamic and correlation functions by comparison with mc simulations and by internal consistency between different routes to thermodynamics .",
    "next we have also discussed the location of the fw line , separating oscillatory from monotonic behavior in the correlation function , within the hpa and compared with that obtained from the lpa introduced in previous work.@xcite in agreement with previous findings , we find that penetrability enhances the region where correlation functions have a monotonic regime .",
    "the fw derived from the hpa and lpa schemes are found to be in qualitative agreement thus making it possible the drawing of a line interpolating the high- and low - temperature regimes .    as a final point",
    ", we investigated the possibility of a fluid - fluid transition .",
    "this possibility arises because the boundness of the potential renders the van hove theorem on the absence of phase transition for one - dimensional model with short - range interactions non - applicable .",
    "in fact , the hpa is seen to predict a critical point where the fw line meets a spinodal line",
    ". however , this prediction takes place in a region of densities and temperatures where the hpa is not reliable .",
    "a careful investigation using both nvt and gibbs ensemble monte carlo techniques akin to those exploited in the investigations of the analog problem for the three - dimensional sw model yields negative results .",
    "these findings are also supported by analytical arguments based on the lattice gas counterpart where the absence of transition can be motivated by the absence of an infinite occupancy of each site , as well as by an exact analytical proof@xcite of a no - go theorem proving the absence of _ any _ phase transition in this model , which is in agreement with , and beautifully complements , our work .    in our quest for a possible thermodynamic transition in the one - dimensional psw model",
    "we have explored values of the energy ratio @xmath21 and well width @xmath8 for which the stability of the system in the thermodynamic limit is not guaranteed by ruelle s criterion.@xcite we have found that , as the temperature decreases and/or the density increases , a transition from a normal fluid phase to a peculiar solid - like phase takes place .",
    "the latter phase is characterized by the formation of clusters of overlapping particles occupying a small fraction of the available space and with non - extensive properties . this clustering transition preempts both the fluid - fluid and fluid - solid transitions .    in view of the results presented here",
    ", it would be very interesting to discuss the phase diagram of the corresponding three - dimensional psw model .",
    "the phase diagram of the sw model ( @xmath165 ) is indeed well established and includes both a fluid - solid transition present even in the hs counterpart and a fluid - fluid transition line .",
    "the latter is present for any value of @xmath3 and @xmath8 but is stable against freezing only for @xmath182 , the depth of the well being irrelevant .",
    "@xcite the results presented here strongly suggest the importance of the additional parameter @xmath21",
    ". a first interesting issue would be the ruelle instability in three - dimensions . a straightforward extension of the arguments presented in appendix [ app : ruelle ] predicts a guaranteed stability for @xmath183 ( if @xmath4 ) , but the actual onset of the instability can not be assessed through these arguments .",
    "one could expect that for sufficiently high penetrability ( i.e. , @xmath184 and high density ) a phenomenon akin to the `` clustering '' transition found here could be present . in the case",
    "@xmath183 , where the clustering transition is not expected , the interesting point is to assess the influence of the ratio @xmath21 on the location of the fluid - fluid critical point and coexistence line .",
    "all of this opens the possibility of a rich and interesting phase diagram which would complement that already present in a general class of bounded potentials with no attractive tails .",

    "<S> the one - dimensional penetrable - square - well fluid is studied using both analytical tools and specialized monte carlo simulations . </S>",
    "<S> the model consists of a penetrable core characterized by a finite repulsive energy combined with a short - range attractive well . </S>",
    "<S> this is a many - body one - dimensional problem , lacking an exact analytical solution , for which the usual van hove theorem on the absence of phase transition does not apply . </S>",

    "<S> the internal thermodynamic consistency with the compressibility route and the validity of the approximation in describing the radial distribution function is assessed by a comparison against numerical simulations . </S>",
    "<S> the fisher  widom line separating the oscillatory and monotonic large - distance behavior of the radial distribution function is computed within the high - penetrability approximation and compared with the opposite regime , thus providing a strong indication of the location of the line in all possible regimes . </S>",
    "<S> the high - penetrability approximation predicts the existence of a critical point and a spinodal line , but this occurs outside the applicability domain of the theory . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the possibility of a fluid - fluid transition by gibbs ensemble monte carlo techniques , not finding any evidence of such a transition . </S>",
    "<S> additional analytical arguments are given to support this claim . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we find a clustering transition when ruelle s stability criterion is not fulfilled . </S>",
    "<S> the consequences of these findings on the three - dimensional phase diagrams are also discussed . </S>"
