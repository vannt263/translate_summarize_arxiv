    "our specific focus here is a suitable permanence theorem for multiplicative actions of finite groups analogous to the classical shephard - todd - chevalley theorem for  linear \" actions of finite groups ( of good order ) on polynomial algebras ; this theorem states precisely when the corresponding algebra of invariants is again a polynomial algebra ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "multiplicative actions , also called exponential actions @xcite , are certain group actions on laurent polynomial rings or , equivalently , group algebras of lattices .",
    "specifically , let @xmath1 denote a lattice , i.e. , a free abelian group of finite rank , and let @xmath0 be a group acting by automorphisms on @xmath1 .",
    "this action extends uniquely to an action of @xmath0 on the group algebra @xmath2 $ ] of @xmath1 .",
    "actions of this type are referred to as _ multiplicative actions _ , and the resulting algebra of invariants @xmath4",
    "is called an algebra of _ multiplicative invariants_. it is easy to see that @xmath5 is again a group algebra only if @xmath0 acts trivially on @xmath1 ; see ( [ multinv = semigroup ] ) .",

    "the method employed leads directly to an explicit fundamental system of invariants .",

    "section [ fpf ] offers a first step in this direction .",
    "we show in theorem ( [ negative ] ) that multiplicative invariants of fixed point free actions ( in rank at least 2 ) are never semigroup algebras .",

    "our main tool in this section is an investigation of the singularities of multiplicative invariants .",
    "doubtless , a good deal more can be said on this topic .",
