    "these resonances have been interpreted in terms of nuclear molecules  @xcite .",
    "the question whether quasimolecular resonances always represent true cluster states in the compound systems , or whether they may also simply reflect scattering states in the ion - ion potential is still unresolved @xcite . in many cases ,",
    "these resonant structures have been associated with strongly - deformed shapes and with clustering phenomena , predicted from the nilsson - strutinsky approach  @xcite , the cranked @xmath0-cluster model  @xcite , or other mean - field calculations  @xcite .",
    "of particular interest is the relationship between superdeformation ( sd ) and nuclear molecules @xcite , since nuclear shapes with major - to - minor axis ratios of 2:1 have the typical ellipsoidal elongation ( with quadrupole deformation parameter @xmath9 @xmath10 0.6 ) for light nuclei  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the structure of possible octupole - unstable 3:1 nuclear shapes ( with @xmath9 @xmath10 1.0 ) - hyperdeformation ( hd ) - for actinide nuclei has also been widely discussed  @xcite in terms of clustering phenomena .",
    "a typical example of the possible link between quasimolecular bands and sd / hd shapes @xcite is given in fig .  1 for @xmath5ar  @xcite .",
    "large quadrupole deformations ( @xmath9  =  0.6 - 1.0 ) and @xmath0-clustering in light n = z nuclei are known to be general phenomena at low excitation energy . for high angular momenta and higher excitation energies ,",
    "very elongated shapes are expected  @xcite to occur in @xmath0-like nuclei for a@xmath11 = 20 - 60 .",
    "these predictions come from the generalized liquid - drop model , taking into account the proximity energy and quasi - molecular shapes  @xcite ( as in the cluster models  @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , highly deformed shapes and sd rotational bands have been recently discovered in several such n = z nuclei , in particular , @xmath5ar using @xmath4-ray spectroscopy techniques  @xcite .",
    "hd bands in @xmath5ar , illustrated in fig .  1 as quasimolecular bands observed in @xmath2c+@xmath1 mg ( open rectangles ) and @xmath6o+@xmath7ne ( full rectangles ) reactions @xcite , and their related ternary clusterizations are predicted theoretically @xcite . with the exception of",
    "the cluster decays of @xmath12ni @xcite and @xmath13zn @xcite recently studied using charged particle spectroscopy  @xcite , no evidence for ternary breakup has yet been reported @xcite in light nuclei ; the particle decay of @xmath5ar sd bands and of other highly excited bands ( displayed as stars in fig .",
    "1 ) is still unexplored .",
    "the main binary reaction ( i.e. @xmath0-transfer ) channel of the @xmath1mg+@xmath2c , for which both resonant effects @xcite ( see open rectangles in fig .  1 ) and orbiting phenomena @xcite have been observed , is investigated in this work by using charged particle-@xmath4-ray coincidence techniques .",

    "is shown on the side bar.,height=472 ]    the study of charged particle-@xmath4-ray coincidences in binary reactions in inverse kinematics is a unique tool in the search for extreme shapes related to clustering phenomena . in this paper , we investigate both the @xmath1mg+@xmath2c and the @xmath3s+@xmath1 mg reactions by using the binary reaction trigger spectrometer ( brs ) @xcite in coincidence with the euroball iv ( eb ) @xmath4-ray spectrometer  @xcite installed at the vivitron tandem facility of strasbourg .",
    "the @xmath1 mg and @xmath3s beams were produced and accelerated by the vivitron with beam intensities kept constant at approximately 5 pna . for the @xmath1mg+@xmath2c study the targets consisted of 200 @xmath14g/@xmath15 thick foils of natural c with an incident beam energy of e@xmath17 = 130  mev an excitation energy range up to e@xmath18 = 30  mev in @xmath1 mg is covered .",
    "for both reactions the brs , in conjunction with eb , gives access to a novel approach for the study of nuclei at large deformations as described below .",
    "the brs associated with eb combines as essential elements two large - area ( with a solid angle of 187 msr each ) heavy - ion gas - detector telescopes in a kinematical coincidence setup at forward angles . a photograph of one of the brs telescope is shown in fig .",

    "the two telescope arms are mounted symmetrically on either side of the beam axis , each covering the forward scattering angle range 12.5@xmath19 - 45.5@xmath19 , i.e. @xmath20 = 29@xmath19 @xmath21 16.5@xmath19 .",

    "@xcite for more details ) having different q - values .",
    "the narrow peak of the first angular correlation with @xmath22z = 0 comes from the binary nature of the fragmentation process .",
    "the two other narrow distributions , also peaked at 180@xmath23 for missing charges @xmath22z = -4 ( -2@xmath0 ) and -6 ( -3@xmath0 ) , define the coplanar ( or collinear ) ternary fission with a small out - of - plane momentum .",
    "the widening of the correlation width as observed with increasing @xmath22z for the underlying broad components is well understood as a statistical @xmath0-emission process where 1 - 4@xmath0 particles are emitted from the fully accelerated fragments .    for the @xmath1mg+@xmath2c @xmath0-transfer reaction , the identifications of all @xmath4 rays in @xmath7ne were achieved  @xcite .",
    "two previously unobserved transitions in @xmath6o from the decay of the 3@xmath24 state at 11.09  mev are clearly visible in the @xmath4-ray spectrum of fig .  4 , have been identified for the first time .",
    "the new the partial level scheme is proposed in the inset of fig .",
    "we note that , thanks to the excellent resolving power of the eb+brs set - up , the respective first escape peak positions of the 6.13 mev , 6.92 mev and 7.12 mev @xmath4-ray transitions in @xmath6o are also apparent in this spectrum .    with appropriate doppler - shift corrections applied to oxygen fragments identified in the brs",
    ", it has been possible to extend the knowledge of the level scheme of @xmath6o at high energies  @xcite , well above the @xmath2c+@xmath0 threshold , which is given in fig .  4 for the sake of comparison .",
    "new information has been deduced on branching ratios of the decay of the 3@xmath24 state of @xmath6o at 11.085  mev @xmath21 3 kev ( which does not @xmath0-decay because of non - natural parity @xcite , in contrast to the two neighbouring 4@xmath24 states at 10.36  mev and 11.10  mev , respectively ) to the 2@xmath24 state at 6.92  mev ( 54.6 @xmath21 2 @xmath25 ) and a value for the decay width @xmath26 fifty times lower than the one given in the literature @xcite , it means @xmath27 @xmath28 0.23 ev . the third state with non - natural parity ( 0@xmath29 ) belonging to the ( 0@xmath29 , 3@xmath24 , 4@xmath24 ) triplet near 11 mev has a known transition to the 1@xmath29 state which is not observed experimentally in our work .",
    "this 3@xmath24 state result is important as it is the highest known @xmath4-decaying level for the well studied @xmath6o nucleus @xcite .",
    "however , other experimental techniques will have to be used in the near future ( such as the paris / gaspard projects @xcite in preparation for the forthcoming spiral2 facility at ganil ) to search for the bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) @xmath0-particle state in @xmath6o ( an equivalent @xmath0+hoyle state ) predicted to be the 0@xmath30 state at about 2 mev above the 4@xmath0-particle breakup threshold  @xcite .",
    "the connection of @xmath0-clustering , quasimolecular resonances phenomena and extreme deformations ( sd , hd , ... ) @xcite can be discussed in terms of the aspects of @xmath4-ray spectroscopy of binary and/or ternary fragments .",
    "exclusive data were collected with the binary reaction spectrometer ( brs ) in coincidence with euroball  iv installed at the vivitron tandem facility of strasbourg .",
    "new @xmath4-ray spectroscopy results on @xmath6o from binary alpha - transfer reactions has been obtained from the @xmath1mg+@xmath2c reaction . in @xmath3s+@xmath1 mg , ternary events can be interpreted as ternary cluster decay from a @xmath12ni composite system at high angular momenta through hyper - deformed shapes .",
    "the search for extremely elongated configurations ( hd ) in rapidly rotating medium - mass nuclei , which has been pursued exclusively using @xmath4-spectroscopy , can be performed in conjunction with charged particle spectroscopy .",
    "we thank the staff of the vivitron for providing us with good @xmath1 mg and @xmath3s stable beams and the euroball group of strasbourg for the excellent support in carrying out all the experiments with the brs .",
