    "molecular systems display at high pressure a horn of plenty of intriguing phases .",
    "that is especially true of molecular oxygen , whose diatomic molecule survives unbroken up to at least 133 gpa  @xcite , and where the original spin s=1 of the gas phase plays an important role . in the phase diagram of o@xmath0 ( fig.[fig : pdiag ] ) we focus on the wide @xmath1-o@xmath0 phase between 8 and 96 gpa , a phase which has long intrigued the community  @xcite . unlike the two bordering phases ,",
    "@xmath4-o@xmath0 an antiferromagnetic ( af ) s=1 correlated insulator at lower pressure , and @xmath5-o@xmath0 a regular and superconducting nonmagnetic ( nm ) metal at higher pressure , @xmath1-o@xmath0 is an insulator of more complex nature .",
    "structurally , high - pressure x - ray diffraction  @xcite revealed in the last decade that at the @xmath6 transition at p @xmath7 8 gpa the close - packed o@xmath0 planes undergo a large distortion giving rise to molecular o@xmath8 `` quartets '' , ( inset in fig.[fig : pdiag ] ) .",
    "spin - polarized neutron diffraction showed that simultaneously there is a collapse of long - range af nel order at the @xmath9 transition  @xcite .",
    "that observation unfortunately did not provide conclusive information about the nature of the ground state in @xmath1-o@xmath0 and in particular about any further role played in @xmath1-o@xmath0 by the spin of individual molecules if any .",
    "it has been tempting to imagine that the o@xmath0 molecular magnetic state could simply collapse from s=1 to s=0 at the @xmath6 transition . in support of this idea",
    "it can be noted that the metallic state band structure of a hypothetical undistorted nonmagnetic o@xmath0  @xcite is prone to turn spontaneously insulating through a peierls type distortion , for example dimerizing  @xcite , or tetramerizing  @xcite the molecules .",
    "further density functional theory ( dft ) calculations strengthened that picture , showing the quartet distorted geometry  @xcite drives the undistorted metal to a band insulator .",
    "moreover , dft calculations showed that this state exhibits o@xmath0 vibrations whose frequency and pressure evolution are , between 20 and 96 gpa , in good agreement with infrared ( ir ) and raman data  @xcite ( see fig.[fig : mir](a ) ) .",
    "an alternative , much more speculative picture insisting instead on a correlated state where o@xmath0 retains its s=1 gas phase spin , and where the quartet of af coupled sites yields a singlet ground state as the basic o@xmath8 block of @xmath1-o@xmath0 ,  @xcite provided no such successful predictions and had limited following so far  see however ref.@xcite .",
    "let us provide first some background before embarking in theoretical calculations .",
    "several experimental authors @xcite had noted that the behaviour of o@xmath0 in the 8 - 20 gpa pressure range is in many ways anomalous compared with that above 20 gpa  @xcite .",
    "focusing on o@xmath0 vibrations , the good agreement found by pham _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite between the band insulator calculations and the measured ir and raman frequencies ( fig.[fig : mir](a ) ) is limited to above p @xmath10 gpa .",
    "below this pressure , the ir mode reverts non - monotonically upwards approaching the high frequency raman mode at the @xmath4-o@xmath0 phase boundary of 8 gpa , rather than dropping steadily as predicted by the band insulator .",
    "subtly , but not less significantly , the o@xmath0 raman data ( fig.[fig : mir](a ) ) show that 20 gpa marks a delicate but definite breaking point with a lower rate of decrease of the mode frequency with decreasing pressure .",
    "both ir and raman elements hint at a possible switch of individual o@xmath0 molecules from s = 0 to s = 1 upon decreasing pressure near 20 gpa . in particular",
    ", the frequency gap between the ir mode , where nearest neighbour o@xmath0 vibrate out of phase , and the raman mode where they vibrate in phase ( see insets in fig.[fig : mir](a ) ) is proportional to the ir effective charge , connected with electron current `` pumping '' between an instantaneously extended molecule ( which attracts electrons ) and a neighboring compressed one ( which expels them ) in the ir mode .",
    "this electron current is absent in the raman mode , where neighboring molecules vibrate in phase .",
    "if the molecules have spin and correlations are strong , the electron hopping is reduced and the current magnitude , proportional to the ir effective charge , must drop compared to the nonmagnetic band state . thus the onset of molecular spin upon decreasing pressure should be accompanied by a collapse of the ir intensity and of the ir -raman splitting , as is indeed observed ( see inset in fig.[fig : intensities ] ) . with this background ,",
    "experimental facts suggest dividing the vast @xmath1-o@xmath0 phase into two . a higher pressure phase between 20 and 96 gpa , which we may call @xmath2-o@xmath0 , where there is no molecular spin and whose physics including lattice vibrations is well described as a band insulator whose gap is due to the peierls - like quartet distortion , and a lower pressure phase between 8 and 20 gpa which we shall call @xmath3-o@xmath0 where that picture fails , and molecular spin probably resurrects signaling that strong correlations coexist within the quartet distortion of the molecules .",
    "the long range nel order typical of the lower pressure undistorted phases is absent here , suggesting that it might be replaced by some kind of correlated singlet state such as that of ref.@xcite . however , strong and verifiable predictions about the same measured vibrational and optical that are well described by the band insulator in @xmath2-o@xmath0 have not been advanced for this type of state .",

    "this evolution of both high and low frequency ir modes upon lowering pressure below 20 gpa goes together with a corresponding change  in fact a decrease  of the mode effective charge .",
    "fig.[fig : intensities ] shows that the dramatic drop of the ir intensity observed in this regime ( see inset in fig.[fig : intensities ] ) , so far unexplained , is now well accounted for by the onset of molecular spin .",
    "we already hinted at the main physical reasons why spin causes all these changes in the vibrational spectrum .",
    "the first element is that spin arises in connection with strong electron correlations , which characterize all lower pressure phases including @xmath4-o@xmath0 . in the strongly correlated state ,",
    "o@xmath0 molecules reduce their mutual electron hopping , and tend to revert toward their gas phase state , which has spin @xmath16 , with shorter bond length and about 71 @xmath15 higher vibrational frequency @xcite .",
    "that explains why the highest ( intramolecular ) raman mode reduces its softening rate below 20gpa ( see fig.[fig : mir ] ) . the reduced ir effective charge , and the shrinking of the frequency gap between the out - of - phase ir and the in - phase raman modes as calculated and observed implies a reduced intermolecular electron hopping in the af correlated state .    for our subsequent understanding of the magnetic state below 20 gpa",
    "it is also important to estimate the effective heisenberg exchange couplings among o@xmath0 molecules .",
    "calling @xmath17 and @xmath18 the exchange values between the first , second , third and fourth neighbors ( see fig.[fig : js.val ] ) we carried out constrained spin polarized dft+@xmath12 calculations , based on the experimental structure at p = 11.4 gpa @xcite and a variety of six different af configurations .",

    ", these values are probably somewhat larger values than real , and should be considered upper bounds .",
    "the previous section showed that the resurgence of molecular spin below 20 gpa could simultaneously explain several observed o@xmath0 vibrational anomalies . however the mean - field long range af order obtained by dft disagreed with the lack of long range spin order found experimentally  @xcite . a state",
    "where molecular spins are present without @xmath24 = 0 long - range order would constitute a kind of spin 1 liquid . in this section",
    "we discuss , extending the picture earlier proposed by gomonay and loktev  @xcite and more recently pursued by bartolomei _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite consisting of an overall singlet state of an isolated quartet of @xmath25 molecules .",
    "the quantum mechanical competition between af long range order and an overall singlet state must be pursued in the whole @xmath3-o@xmath0 lattice .",
    "for that purpose we simplify the system as a 2d square lattice model made of plaquettes ( quartets ) of @xmath25 heisenberg sites .",
    "each site , representing an o@xmath0 molecule , is af coupled to nearest neighbours within the same plaquette by af exchange couplings @xmath26 , and to nearest neighbours in the next plaquettes by @xmath27 , see fig.[heisenberg_model ] .",
    "two different states compete : the nel af configuration , as obtained by dft and which breaks spin su(2 ) symmetry , and a singlet , nm state that is akin to a collection of independent plaquettes , each in its singlet ground state .",
    "the singlet ground state of an isolated plaquette of energy @xmath28 is obtained by coupling second neighbor sites 1 and 3 to @xmath29 , sites 2 and 4 to @xmath30 , see fig.[heisenberg_model ] , and then coupling @xmath31 and @xmath32 to a total singlet @xmath33 .",
    "the energy per site of an independent collection of plaquettes thus is ( note that the number of plaquettes @xmath34 is one quarter the number of sites ) @xmath35 by comparison , the classical energy per site of the nel af configuration is @xmath36 therefore , for @xmath37 the non - magnetic collection of independent plaquettes will be lower in energy than the nel configuration .",
    "if we use @xmath38 mev and @xmath39 , we may conclude that the actual ground state is a collection of independent non - magnetic plaquettes .",
    "this state is akin to that proposed in ref .",
    "we observe further that the next - nearest - neighbor exchange @xmath40 frustrates and penalizes the nel configuration more than the non - magnetic one , leading to the energy balance within each plaquette from @xmath41 . moreover , the inter - plane exchange @xmath18 gives no contribution to the classical energy , since its effects cancel out as can be seen in fig.[fig : js.val ] .",
    "since both @xmath42 and @xmath18 are anyhow smaller than @xmath43 , we shall not consider them in the following analysis .",
    "( color online ) simplified two - dimensional heisenberg model.,width=264,height=234 ]    the above treatment however is still crude , as it does not take into account quantum fluctuations . to evaluate their impact we assess the stability of the non - magnetic state against quantum fluctuations .",
    "elementary quantum fluctuations are built by combining into an overall singlet two separate spin fluctuations in neighboring plaquettes .",

    "this attraction however can not overcome the hard - core constraint , since the two triplets can not reside on the same plaquette .",
    "the problem is thus equivalent to two hard - core bosons , each costing an energy @xmath19 and able to hop between nearest neighbour plaquettes with an amplitude @xmath61 . in spite of the weak nearest neighbour attraction @xmath60 , their lowest energy state is unbound and has energy @xmath62 .",
    "the overall singlet , spin liquid state will be stable so long as this excitation gap is positive , whereas antiferromagnetism will prevail if it is zero or negative . based on this result , a better estimate for the stability of the overall singlet is the condition @xmath63 , which leads to @xmath64 .",
    "the estimated values of the exchange couplings satisfy this inequality , confirming the stability of an overall singlet state , even once quantum fluctuations are included .",
    "the spin liquid singlet state , a lattice of plaquettes each made of four antiferromagnetically correlated s=1 sites , with weaker but nonzero inter - plaquette correlations , represents in conclusion our best model for @xmath3-o@xmath0 below 20 gpa .",
    "one burning question is at this point what evidence can one identify proving the existence of a nonzero molecular spin in low pressure @xmath1-o@xmath0 , despite its lack of magnetic long - range order .",
    "there is in fact at least one such evidence , long published that but not interpreted yet , and it is optical . near infrared spectroscopy across the @xmath4-@xmath1 transition shows the excitation of a single o@xmath0 molecule from its lowest energy @xmath65 s=1 configuration to the lowest s=0 @xmath66 state .",
    "this process , forbidden by spin and parity in isolated o@xmath0 , is allowed in a lattice of molecules and shows up in high pressure optical absorption  @xcite .",
    "the peak corresponding to @xmath67 ( and its first vibrational satellite , triggered by molecular elongation in the @xmath68=0 state ) is clearly visible in the @xmath4-phase , at an energy @xmath69 @xmath15 , a frequency comparable to that of the isolated molecule . when the @xmath1-phase sets in above 8gpa the @xmath56 is abruptly blue shifted to @xmath70 @xmath15 and very considerably broadened , to the extent that its vibrational satellites are not anymore distinguishable .",
    "@xcite that optical observation can now be explained .    in the @xmath25 heisenberg model representation , the@xmath67 excitation of a single",
    "molecule amounts to annihilating a spin 1 site in a plaquette leaving a vacancy in its place .",
    "we should expect optical absorption at a frequency equal to the @xmath71 molecular excitation energy plus the energy cost of the molecular vacancy .",
    "an experimental estimate of this cost was given as a mere 250 @xmath15 in the @xmath4-phase at much lower pressure  @xcite , where the absorption peak is close to the molecular excitation energy and its broadening , attributable to shake up of spin waves , is small .",
    "as pressure rises the exchange coupling @xmath19 increases rapidly , as signaled by the blue shift and broadening of this transition visible within the @xmath4-phase.@xcite in the o@xmath0 quartet singlet state , a vacancy costs roughly the energy difference between the ground state of the three surviving o@xmath0 molecules and the initial four - molecule state .",
    "this difference is readily found to be @xmath72 . moreover , since the three molecule state has @xmath25 , while the initial four molecule state was a singlet , an itinerant spin-1 excitation must be created in addition to the vacancy , costing an additional energy @xmath73 $ ] ( see inset in fig.[fig : blue.shift ] ) .",
    "we therefore predict the absorption line to undergo at the @xmath55 transition a sudden blue shift of @xmath74 with a large broadening @xmath75 due to inter - plaquette exchange . with the calculated exchange values at 11.4 gpa that means @xmath76 and @xmath77 respectively , values that are reasonably close to the experimental ones.@xcite ( see fig.[fig : blue.shift ] ) . in conclusion ,",
    "the abrupt change of optical absorption is explained by the onset of a correlated singlet state at the @xmath55 transition .",

    "the ground state of high pressure @xmath1-o@xmath0 , correctly described as a peierls - distorted nonmagnetic band insulator and an overall spin singlet above 20 gpa , turns below 20 gpa into a correlated insulator , where molecules recover their s=1 spin , but where exchange couplings and quantum fluctuations between spins conspire to yield another , different overall spin singlet ground state .",
    "sharing very similar quartet lattice structures , the two states appear to have similar symmetry , and the question is whether the phase diagram should show a phase transition between the two or not . assuming same symmetry , there could only be a first order transition or a smooth crossover . on account of the mechanical coupling",
    "which the onset of molecular spin must exert on the overall lattice structure , the likeliest candidate is a first order transition .",
    "as it turns out , there is in literature , ignored so far by most , a rather clear evidence of a low temperature , first order phase transition @xcite , signaled around 25 gpa at 20 k by a small but sharp and sudden 10 @xmath15 splitting of a low frequency vibration .",
    "we propose that this could signal precisely the first order line separating the low pressure phase , say @xmath3-o@xmath0 , and the high pressure one , say @xmath2-o@xmath0",
    ". this phase line will extend at finite temperature but , on account of same symmetry , should terminate with a critical point . because there are underlying spins in @xmath3-o@xmath0 but not in @xmath2-o@xmath0 , the phase line must turn towards higher pressures as temperature grows , because @xmath3-o@xmath0 possesses a high temperature spin entropy @xmath78 per molecule whereas @xmath2-o@xmath0 does not .",

    "<S> oxygen , one of the most common and important elements in nature , has an exceedingly well explored phase diagram under pressure , up and beyond 100 gpa . at low temperatures , </S>",
    "<S> the low pressures antiferromagnetic phases below 8 gpa where o@xmath0 molecules have spin s=1 are followed by the broad apparently nonmagnetic @xmath1 phase from about 8 to 96 gpa . in this phase which is our focus molecules group structurally together to form quartets while switching , as believed by most , to spin s=0 . here </S>",
    "<S> we present theoretical results strongly connecting with existing vibrational and optical evidence , showing that this is true only above 20 gpa , whereas the s=1 molecular state survives up to at about 20 gpa . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath1 phase thus breaks up into two : a spinless @xmath2 ( 20 - 96 gpa ) , and another @xmath3 ( 8 - 20 gpa ) where the molecules have s=1 but possess only short range antiferromagnetic correlations . </S>",
    "<S> a local spin liquid - like singlet ground state akin to some earlier proposals and whose optical signature we identify in existing data , is proposed for this phase . </S>",
    "<S> our proposed phase diagram thus has a first order phase transition just above 20 gpa , extending at finite temperature and most likely terminating into a crossover with a critical point near 30 gpa and 200 k. </S>"
