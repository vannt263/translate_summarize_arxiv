    "as electronic devices become smaller , they leave the regime of classical physics and enter the realm of quantum physics . many classical quantities such as resistance",
    "must be reinterpreted for systems on a mesoscopic scale .",
    "one such classical concept is that of the refrigerator : a device that uses an external source of work to cool a gas . in this paper",
    "we consider whether this classical concept can be applied to an electron gas so that one could cool such a gas by applying a voltage to a device .",
    "there are many ways to cool electrons in a condensed - matter system .",
    "for example , thermoelectric coolers based on the peltier effect  @xcite are available commercially .",
    "a different kind of electron - cooling mechanism in semiconductor devices is based on a quasistatic expansion of a two - dimensional electron gas.@xcite still other possibilities include taking advantage of many - body effects that can lead to liquid / gas phase transitions in the electron population in a semiconductor quantum well.@xcite    in this paper we investigate electron cooling in a mesoscopic solid - state device using evaporative emission .",
    "this method entails removal of ( `` filtering '' ) electrons from a high - energy subband of a many - electron system , followed by relaxation of the remaining electrons to a temperature lower than that of the initial system .",
    "evaporative cooling is widely used in bosonic systems.@xcite but this method is harder to implement for fermionic systems , as we shall discuss below .    in section [ sec : theory ]",
    "we describe the theory of a two - dimensional device to cool electrons in quantum wires .",
    "we use the landauer formula@xcite to analyze the cooling properties of these devices .",
    "this formula was originally developed to explain the transport properties of electrons in a quantum device .",
    "it relates these properties to the quantum mechanical scattering amplitudes for electrons that pass through the device . to calculate these amplitudes",
    ", we use an extension of r - matrix theory@xcite that we summarize in the appendix . in section",
    "[ sec : results ] we use this theory to calculate cooling properties of several two - dimensional devices .",
    "we begin with a simple t - junction device and show that by optimizing its design we can achieve electron cooling .",
    "we improve upon this result by switching to a `` plus - junction '' design , which can give up to 15%  cooling . in section [ sec : experiment ] we discuss applications and realistic parameters for a device to cool electrons , and in  [ sec : conclusions ] we summarize our key results and describe future research .",
    "our theoretical approach is analogous to the working principle of the classical hilsch vortex tube ,  @xcite which uses a t - shaped assembly of pipes to separate high - pressure air into a high - temperature system and a low - temperature system .",
    "this separation does not violate the second law of thermodynamics , because the system is driven by an external force .",
    "we use a similar idea to cool electrons in a quantum mechanical system .",
    "the simplest such device uses a t - shaped assembly of quantum wires to remove higher - energy electrons from an electron gas at fixed temperature .",
    "figure [ fig : tregions ] is a schematic of such a configuration that defines the regions of the device .",
    "we assume that our device is formed from a quantum well whose thickness is sufficiently small that the device can be considered two - dimensional .",
    "that is , we assume that the device confines electrons to a layer of thickness @xmath0 such that the confinement energy associated with motion in the @xmath1-direction is much larger than any other energy in the problem .",

    "the `` adiabatic region '' is within the electron - phonon scattering length ( @xmath4 ) of the junction .",
    "it is in the adiabatic region that we achieve cooling . at larger distances , in the `` equilibrium region , ''",
    "the electrons have returned to the temperature of the lattice .",
    "[ fig : tregions],width=3 ]    there are three leads in the t - junction : the input lead , output lead , and sidearm , as shown in  fig.[fig : tregions ] .",
    "we shall label physical quantities by subscripts `` i , '' `` o , '' and `` s '' respectively ; for example , we denote the widths of the leads by  @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and  @xmath7 .",
    "electrons are injected into this device through the input lead , and in the input region are in thermal equilibrium at an initial temperature @xmath8 and chemical potential  @xmath9 .",
    "filtering of higher - energy electrons from the initial electron gas occurs in the _ scattering region_. the rate of scattering into the sidearm depends upon the electron energy : if the subband energy in lead of width @xmath10 is given by @xmath11 , then the `` force '' electrons exert on the sides of the lead , @xmath12 , is larger for larger  @xmath13 .",
    "thus when an electron encounters the sidearm , the higher - subband states are more likely to squirt down the sidearm .",
    "alternatively , one can see that the higher - subband electrons scatter preferentially to the sidearm because they are in states with wave functions that are linear combinations of plane waves with larger transverse momenta .",
    "electrons that scatter forward into the output lead proceed into the _ ballistic region _",
    ", where the electron population is determined entirely by the product of the initial electron distribution and the scattering probability . next the electrons enter the _ adiabatic region _ , where they exchange energy among themselves and so relax to a temperature  @xmath14 and a chemical potential  @xmath15 . in principle , the values of these properties can be calculated from conservation laws for energy and particle number . in section [ sec : results ] we report such calculations and show that for some device geometries the temperature @xmath14 is less than the initial temperature : _ this temperature decrease is the desired cooling effect_.    finally , at large distances ( as determined by the electron - phonon scattering rate ) the electrons will return to equilibrium with the lattice at the initial temperature  @xmath16 ; this re - equilibration occurs in the _ equilibrium region_. to see cooling , one must measure the electron temperature before they get to this region    below we define our notation and describe how we calculate the electron distributions in the input and output leads .",
    "we also define and describe the calculation of a quantitative measure of electron cooling in the device .",
    "provided the electrons in each lead are in thermodynamic equilibrium , we can treat them as an ideal fermi gas . for lead  @xmath17 , therefore , the subband electron density ( per unit volume ) in an open ( energetically accessible ) subband  @xmath13  is @xmath18 for @xmath13 such that the subband energy obeys @xmath19 . in this equation ,",

    "the corresponding subband population in lead  @xmath17 is the integral of the subband density  ( eq .  ( [ eq : subbanddensity ] ) ) over all allowed total electron energies  @xmath21 : @xmath30 the total population in lead  @xmath17 is the sum of the subband populations for that lead , @xmath31      immediately upon leaving the scattering region the transmitted electrons are in a highly nonequilibrium distribution and can not be characterized by a temperature or a chemical potential . by the time",
    "these electrons have traveled a distance along the lead comparable to several times their relaxation length , they have come to equilibrium at  @xmath32 and  @xmath33 , and it is meaningful to describe them by a fermi - dirac distribution function @xmath34 .",

    ", we can determine the temperature in the output lead  @xmath32 by requiring that the number of electrons in the output lead at equilibrium equals the number of electrons transmitted into this lead ( conservation of electrons in the output lead ) . to set up equations to implement this strategy",

    "this system has a central region  @xmath101 connected to @xmath102  external regions or `` leads . ''",
    "the leads and the interior region meet at a set of boundary surfaces we denote by  @xmath103 , @xmath104 ,  , @xmath105 .",
    "we treat the boundaries between the shaded and unshaded regions as `` hard walls '' ( infinite potential ) so electron wave functions are non - zero only in the shaded regions .",
    "since there may be more than three leads , we depart from the notation used in the body of this paper ( in which the input , output and sidearm leads were denoted by subscripts @xmath37 , @xmath106 , and @xmath107 ) and denote the input lead by a zero subscript and all other leads by positive integer subscripts .",
    "we measure all distances in units of @xmath108 and energies in terms of @xmath109 .",
    "we seek an analytic solution for the amplitudes of outgoing states in the leads when only one incoming state is occupied .",
    "the time - independent schroedinger equation for the scattering function is @xmath111 where @xmath112 represents the state of an electron with kinetic energy  @xmath21 incident in input - lead subband  @xmath113 .",
    "note that @xmath114 is well - defined in all leads . in a _",
    "finite _ region , the hamiltonian  @xmath115 is not hermitian .",
    "we can produce a hermitian operator by adding to @xmath115 the so - called bloch operator  @xmath116.@xcite we denote the eigenfunctions of the sum of these operators in the interior region by @xmath117 and write the so - called bloch eigenvalue equation  as @xmath118 inserting the bloch operator into the schroedinger equation we get @xmath119    we now expand the scattering wave function @xmath120 in the set of orthonormal bloch eigenfunctions @xmath121 inserting this expansion into the schroedinger equation and using the properties of the bloch eigenfunctions yields @xmath122 where @xmath123  is the eigenvalue corresponds to the bloch eigenfunction @xmath124 .",
    "this expansion is valid throughout the interior region  @xmath101 and on its surface ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:2dfig ] ) .    to derive an equation for the r  matrix",
    ", we now apply this expansion of the scattering state on each boundary @xmath125 . at each such boundary",
    "we can expand the scattering function in either lead eigenfunctions or bloch eigenfunctions in the interior region . to be specific , we introduce a local cartesian coordinate system for each lead : @xmath126 and @xmath127 are the longitudinal and transverse coordinates of the @xmath128 lead , respectively .",
    "we choose @xmath129 on each boundary .",
    "( one can easily choose any orthonormal coordinate system , _ mutatis mutandis _ ) .",
    "each lead eigenfunction is then a product of a plane wave in the @xmath126 direction and a transverse bound - state eigenfunction  @xmath130 .",
    "the scattering wave function in the  @xmath128 lead therefore becomes @xmath131 where @xmath132 and @xmath133 are the wave vector and transmission _ amplitude _ for the channel with quantum number  @xmath134 in channel  @xmath135 . also , @xmath136 is the @xmath137transverse eigenfunction of lead  @xmath135 .",
    "finally , @xmath138 is the kroniker delta - function , which ensures that each wave function is defined only in one lead .",
    "if we measure energy in units of @xmath139 then we can express energy conservation in lead @xmath135 as @xmath140 , where @xmath141 is the width of the @xmath128 lead ( in units of  @xmath108 ) .",
    "we use this equation to determine the wave vector @xmath132 .",
    "after some algebra we get a set of linear algebraic equations that we can solve for the transmission amplitudes : @xmath142 in writing these equations we have defined @xmath143 finally , the r - matrix is given by @xmath144 this equation is general in that we can easily adapt it to any number of leads and to different choices of input  lead .",
