    "the challenge is now to explain the possible cause for this late time acceleration and there has been a wide range of proposals for this .",
    "one of the possible sources for this accelerated expansion could be an exotic type of matter with an equation of state parameter @xmath0 .",
    "such sources are collectively called dark energy .",

    "felice & tsujikawa  ( 2010 ) ) have been thoroughly investigated in recent time to explain the late time acceleration of the universe .",
    "in addition to circumvent the problem like cosmic coincidence , the advantage of using these fields is that they also mimic cc at late times . moreover , as the equation of state ( eos ) for these scalar fields in general vary with time , it is expected that these scalar field models can be distinguished from @xmath1cdm with observational data from higher redshifts which are expected to become available in near future .",
    "scalar field models in general , can be divided into two broad classes : the fast roll and slow roll models , also termed as tracking and thawing models , respectively (  caldwell & linder  ( 2005 ) ,  linder  ( 2003 ) ) .",
    "tracker models with steep potentials usually mimic the background matter / radiation in the early time and remains subdominant . only at late times",
    ", the field leaves the tracker regime and starts behaving like a component with large negative pressure and thereby behaves like dark energy . on the other hand ,",
    "thawing models are similar to inflaton , where the scalar field is initially frozen due to the large hubble friction in the flat part of the potential and hence behaves close to cc . at late times , the scalar field slowly thaws from this frozen state and departs from this cc behaviour . in both these cases , a certain degree of fine tuning ( whether in the form of the potentials or in the initial conditions ) is always necessary to get the required late time evolution .    with the high level of precision that exists in current observational techniques",
    ", the question naturally arises as to whether the available observational data indicate any clear preference of one of these models over the other . in the present exercise",
    ", we attempt to answer this question using the bayesian approach .",
    "to do so , it is important to look for a parametrization for the dark energy behaviour which interpolates between the tracker and the thawer behaviour .",
    "it has been however pointed out that general barotropic models described by @xmath2 can not fully mimic the scalar field models and in particular the tracker type of models (  scherrer  ( 2006 ) ,  linder & scherrer  ( 2009 ) ) . however , the attempt in this paper is to have a single model that broadly mimics the two overall behaviours , namely : 1 ) the equation of state is frozen initially at @xmath3 and then at late times it slowly thaws out from this frozen state which is similar to thawer type of scalar fields and 2 ) the equation of state is that of matter initially and later on starts behaving like cosmological constant which is similar to tracker type of scalar fields .",
    "fortunately a widely studied form , known as `` _ generalized chaplygin gas _ '' ( gcg ) (  kamenshchik et.al .",
    "( 2001 ) ,  bento et al .",
    "( 2002 ) ,  sen & scherrer  ( 2005 ) ) , can provide such a parametrization scheme [ see also (  aviles & cervantes - cota ( 2011 ) ) ] .",
    "this single parametrization for the eos of the dark energy can not only mimic both of these two behaviours , it can also act as dark energy with constant eos ( including @xmath4 which is the same as cc ) . using this parametrization",
    "we show that considering only the homogenous background cosmology and applying it to analyze observational data does not discriminate between thawing and tracker type of behaviours .",
    "however , if we include the data from the growth of matter perturbations as well as those from cmbr anisotropies , thawing type models are preferred if we do not consider the perturbation in the gcg fluid . but including perturbations in the gcg fluid results no preference of thawer over tracker type of behaviour .     as a function of redshift .",

    "the choice of the constants , @xmath15 and @xmath10 uniquely determines the dark energy behaviour in the gcg model .    one can easily show that @xmath16 . as our primary goal is to compare the thawing and tracking behaviours which primarily arise in the scalar field models , we confine ourselves to non - phantom region i.e @xmath17 . for @xmath18 ,",
    "gcg exactly behaves as cc at all times and in this case the parameter @xmath10 is redundant . for @xmath19 , gcg behaves exactly as a non - relativistic pressureless matter fluid at all times .    for @xmath20 ,",
    "the parameter @xmath10 determines the how the equation of state changes with time . for @xmath21 ,",
    "the gcg behaves as a fluid with constant equation state @xmath22 . for @xmath6 , at early times gcg behaves as matter while at late times it behaves as a fluid with negative equation of state and asymptotically tends to a cosmological constant like behaviour in the future .",
    "this is exactly what we need for a tracking behaviour . on the other hand , for @xmath23",
    ", gcg behaves as a cosmological constant to start with and then as the universe evolves , it starts deviating from this cc behaviour (  sen & scherrer  ( 2005 ) ) .",
    "this is similar to the thawing behaviour .",
    "further , in this case , gcg always approaches to matter behaviour assymptotically in the future ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "hence , in this model , accelerated expansion is a transient feature .",
    "all these different behaviours are shown in figure 1 .",

    "the growth of large scale structures is another useful observational probe to distinguish between different dark energy models .",
    "the growth rate of large scale structures is calculated from matter density perturbation @xmath29 in the linear regime and subhorizon scales @xmath30 . on these scales where one measures the growth",
    ", one can safely ignore the dark energy perturbations as it only affects the fluctuations comparable to hubble scales .",
    "the effect of dark energy is only through the background expansion and one can use the newtonian limit for the evolution of the matter density fluctuation satisfying the equation :    @xmath31    the growth factor @xmath32 is related to the linear density contrast @xmath33 by @xmath34",
    ". the compilation of data for growth factor measurements from different redshift surveys can be found in (  gupta et al .",
    "( 2011 ) ) ( see also references therein ) .",
    "using observational data mentioned above we calculate the joint likelihood for the gcg model as : @xmath35    before calculating the bayesian evidence for thawing type and tracker type of models , we maximise the likelihood function and calculate the allowed region in the parameter space of @xmath36 and @xmath27 for both thawing type and tracking type of models . the results are shown in figure ( 2 ) and figure ( 3 ) . in these figures",
    "we show the 3-d contours in the @xmath37 region . for the tracker type of models ( shown in figure ( 2 and 3 ) ) , it is clear that upto @xmath38 confidence level , the allowed behaviours are extremely close to c.c .",
    "this is apparent from the bound on @xmath15 which varies negligibly from @xmath39 , @xmath40 behaviour .",
    "the constraint on @xmath27 parameter is also extremely tight , @xmath41 . also , in this case , all the values of @xmath10 are allowed .",
    "but for two specific values of @xmath10 , the allowed value of @xmath15 is maximum .",
    "these are @xmath21 for which gcg behaves as a de with constant equation of state and for @xmath42 for which gcg itself behaves as a combination of @xmath1 and matter fluid . for @xmath43",
    "only @xmath18 is allowed which is similar to c.c .    for thawing case ( shown in figure ( 2 and 3 ) ) ,",
    "the variation of @xmath15 parameter is marginally higher than the tracking case , but here also the constraint on @xmath27 is extremely tight .",
    "also in this case , all values of @xmath10 are allowed , but as one increases @xmath10 , the allowed values for @xmath15 get decreased .",
    "to summarise , with all the data , the gcg parametrization puts extremely tight constraint on the dark energy behaviour and the cosmological parameter @xmath27 .",
    "we now proceed to substantiate this conclusion . in order to do this",
    "we calculate the bayesian evidence for both the thawing as well as tracking behaviour .",
    "this is defined as (  liddle et al .",
    "( 2006 ) ) @xmath44 where @xmath45 represents the set of model parameters , @xmath46 represents the likelihood function and @xmath47 is the prior probability distribution for parameter @xmath45 . in our case , we have three parameters @xmath48 and @xmath27 .",
    "as we have no prior knowledge about these parameters , we assume uniform prior for these three parameters.we get a thawing behaviour for @xmath49 and tracking for @xmath50 . for the thawing case",
    "we assume that @xmath10 is uniformly distributed in the range @xmath51 while for tracking case we assume that @xmath10 is uniformly distributed in the range @xmath52 .",
    "@xmath15 fixes the equation of state for dark energy at present ( @xmath53 ) and we assume that it is uniformly distributed between @xmath54 and @xmath55 for both thawing as well as tracking case .",
    "we also assume that for both the cases , @xmath27 is uniformly distributed between @xmath56 and @xmath57 .    according to jeffrey s interpretation (  jeffreys(1998 ) ) , if @xmath58 between @xmath55 and @xmath59 , it is a significant evidence for a model with higher @xmath60 while the same between @xmath59 and @xmath61 is a strong to very strong evidence . if @xmath62 is more than @xmath61 , the model with higher @xmath60 is decisively favoured .",
    "we calculate @xmath62 assuming thawing ( @xmath49 ) and tracking ( @xmath50 ) as two different models .",
    "we get the following results :    * @xmath63 *    @xmath64    with d.e .",
    "perturbation    @xmath65    without d.e .",
    "perturbation    from these results , it is clear that although observational data from the smooth background cosmology can not discriminate between thawing and tracking behaviour , when these are complemented with the information from the inhomogenous universe but assuming uniform dark energy distribution there is significant evidence in favour of thawing behaviour ( with odds ratio 5:1 ) .",
    "however , when we take into account the perturbation in the dark energy component while calculating the cmbr spectra , this preference over thawing type of models is lost and there is no bayesian evidence to prefere any type of behaviours .",
    "we should also mention that although we choose a specific prior for @xmath15 and @xmath27 as mentioned above , the results are only weakly sensitive to these priors . in order to verify this",
    "we have varied these priors and we found that the above results remain almost the same .",
    "this makes our result sufficiently robust .",
    "several observed features of the universe depend on the precise nature of cosmological expansion .",
    "broadly the evolution of universe with a dark energy can be classified in two categories . in one case",
    "the de equation of state is frozen at the @xmath3 in the early universe due to large hubble friction but in the late time as the hubble friction eases out , the equation of state slowly thaws out of this frozen state .",
    "this is so called thawing behaviour and can be modelled by the scalar field with slow - roll potentials . in the other case ,",
    "the de equation equation of state mimics the background matter in the early universe and in the late time it starts behaving like a c.c .",
    "this type of behaviour is called tracker type and can be mimicked by the scalar fields with steeper potentials . here",
    "we parametrize these two overall behaviours by the gcg type of equation of state and investigate whether the observational data prefer any one of them .    towards this end",
    "we have first used data pertaining to the background cosmology . in particular ,",
    "we have considered three types of data : ( i ) supernova type 1a , ( ii ) hubble parameter evolution with redshift , and ( iii ) lookback time of galaxies . for the supernova data we have used the union2.1 data .",
    "the data from keck - lris , spice and vvds has been used for the evolution of hubble parameter while for the present redshift hubble parameter hst key project has been used . for the look back time calculation",
    ", the incubation time of the galaxies has been marginalized over as we do not have definitive information about it .",
    "we have then complemented these with the information from inhomogeneous universe . for this",
    "we have used the results of cmb anisotropy ( as given in the wmap-7 data ) and the growth of large - scale structures .",
    "our results indicate that if we take into account only the smooth background cosmology , then the data is insufficient to give a clear verdict either way . on the other hand ,",
    "if we complement this with the information from inhomogeneities in the universe then there seems to be a preference for the thawing model if one does not consider the dark energy perturbations while calculating the cmbr spectra . in terms of bayesian evidence",
    ", this preference for thawing behaviour is significant .",
    "however , we find that incorporating the dark energy perturbation to calculate the cmbr spectra , this preferance for thawing type of behaviour is lost .",
    "we stress that the gcg can not represent the full scalar field dynamics for tracker type of models in particular and this weakens our conclusion .",
    "nevertheless , our analysis is the first one to investigate whether observational data prefer a thawing or tracking type of behaviour .",
