    "the brane - world idea , according to which the observable universe is a hypersurface ( brane ) embedded in a higher - dimensional spacetime ( bulk ) , has attracted the attention of particle physicists and cosmologists in recent years  for reviews see  @xcite .",
    "the idea is motivated from developments in string theory and m  theory , although many of the models which have been developed are phenomenological .",
    "two such models were constructed by randall and sundrum  @xcite , in which the bulk spacetime is a five - dimensional anti - de sitter ( ads ) spacetime with a small length - scale ( @xmath0 mm or less ) . in this article",
    ", we will be considering the second  @xcite of these models which has only one brane with a large , positive , bare tension to balance the curvature of the ads bulk .",
    "the cosmological background solutions in the bulk spacetime were calculated  @xcite shortly after the model was proposed .",
    "cosmological perturbations around this background , however , have resisted a solution in the face of a considerable research effort  @xcite .",
    "( for a review on cosmological perturbations in brane - worlds see @xcite . )",
    "although diverse formalisms for cosmological perturbations in brane models exist , the evolution of perturbations during the different cosmological epochs is not yet fully understood .",
    "the problem is that the bulk equations are partial differential equations which are subject to spacetime dependent boundary conditions on the brane .",
    "therefore , the full problem can can not be reduced to a four - dimensional effective problem .",
    "in addition , there is a large difference in scales : the ads length - scale is of the order of @xmath1 mm or less , whereas , the perturbations have to be evolved over many orders of magnitudes of conformal time , a ratio in scales of about @xmath2 . because of this , the wave equation for the evolution of the perturbations is difficult to solve numerically , at least by brute - force numerical integration : the spatial length scale of @xmath1 mm means that we would have to use a corresponding time scale as the time - step , meaning the code would have to be run for the order of @xmath2 time steps !    in order to test the brane - world idea against cosmological data , it is extremely important to understand the evolution of perturbations .",
    "one of the most powerful discriminating tools between cosmological models is the power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies , which is , effectively , a snapshot of the perturbations in the universe when it was about one thousandth of its current size . at",
    "about this time in the history of the universe , two related events occur : atomic recombination and last scattering of photons . before atomic recombination ,",
    "the temperature of the universe is so high that protons and electrons form a plasma , but during recombination they come together to form atomic hydrogen . at approximately the same time , the mean free path of the photons due thomson scattering in the plasma increases rapidly from being very small to very large ( effectively , from zero to infinity ) meaning that most of the photons arriving at the earth from the cosmological plasma will not have scattered subsequently .",
    "once foreground effects due to our galaxy and external galaxy clusters have been removed , the electromagnetic radiation seen from earth is an image of this surface of last - scattering , or , more precisely , the intersection of it with our past light - cone . however , because of perturbations in the early universe , this will occur at slightly earlier or later times at different points of space , so the cmb radiation will be slightly brighter or dimmer at different points on the sky .",
    "the upshot of this is that , by measuring the temperature fluctuations in the cmb , we can deduce the perturbations in the metric on the surface of last scattering .",
    "the details of the perturbations in the metric at the time of last - scattering and their subsequent evolution depend on the theory of gravity . in brane - world models ,",
    "einstein s equation becomes modified , at least at high energies , and it is plausible that these effects can propagate into the regime relevant to the creation of cmb anisotropies .",
    "clearly , the evolution of cosmological perturbations in this model is of significant interest .",
    "the modifications in the randall  sundrum ( rs ) model are twofold : first , in einstein s equation a term quadratic in the energy - momentum tensor appears . in the context of cosmology",
    ", this implies that at high energies the hubble parameter on the brane is proportional the energy density of matter @xmath3 and not proportional to @xmath4 , as in general relativity .",
    "however , in the rs model one can show that this term is negligible at low energies , i.e. , at energies much smaller than the brane tension .",
    "the other correction which appears in einstein s field equation is the five - dimensional weyl tensor projected onto the brane .",
    "this term encodes the influence of the bulk gravitational field on the dynamics of the brane . in the case of a homogeneous and isotropic brane",
    "this term vanishes in the case of an ads bulk , but is non - zero if the bulk contains a black hole ( schwarzschild  ads ) . from the point of view of 4d cosmology",
    ", this term behaves like a smooth energy component with equation of state @xmath5 and was therefore dubbed `` dark radiation''@xcite .",
    "its response to perturbations is somewhat different  @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this article is to study the evolution of tensor perturbations in the rs brane - world .",
    "although these perturbations are easier to understand than the observationally interesting case of scalar perturbations , we will see that their evolution is already very complicated .",
    "there are several coordinates system which one might use to tackle the problem . in the gaussian normal ( gn )",
    "coordinate system the brane is at rest but the bulk metric components have a complicated time - dependence : the brane boundary condition are easy to impose , but the solution of the corresponding wave equation is much more subtle since it is non - separable .",
    "alternatively , one can formulate the problem in a coordinate system where the brane moves , but the bulk spacetime is manifestly static : one can then solve the wave equation in the bulk , but the boundary condition on the brane is difficult to impose . in this paper",
    "we will discuss solutions in the near - brane limit of the gn coordinate system .",
    "these solutions are the most direct analogue of the well studied mode functions of minkowski space .",
    "some of the material presented here first appeared in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the fact that the equation of motion is not separable is likely to lead to mode mixing and this will be discussed in future work .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ overview ] we discuss the different scales involved and discuss different ways to attack the problem . in section  [ setup ]",
    "we present the setup and derive the bulk wave equation and the brane boundary conditions .",
    "we also discuss the issue of initial conditions . in section  [ bases ]",
    "we present the near - brane solutions in the different cosmological epochs . in section  [ secic ]",
    "we discuss the problem of initial conditions .",
    "we present our conclusions in section  [ conc ] .",
    "for simplicity , we will only consider the second rs model  @xcite which has a single brane of constant positive bare tension in an anti - de sitter ( ads ) bulk which has a reflection symmetry between the two sides of the brane .",
    "furthermore , we will restrict our attention to the case of a spatially flat universe , which is observationally favoured .",
    "the bulk einstein equation for this model is then @xmath6 the gauss relation gives the four - dimensional ricci tensor as @xmath7 where the extrinsic curvature tensor of the brane is defined as @xmath8 with @xmath9 being the unit covector normal to the brane , and @xmath10 is the contribution from the weyl tensor of the bulk spacetime  .",
    "the junction conditions  @xcite become @xmath11 whilst the definition of @xmath12 , combined with the bulk einstein equations ( [ backgroundeinstein ] ) , yields @xmath13 we will study perturbations by linearizing these equations about the cosmological background solution . for simplicity , we will focus on the case of a spatially flat universe , i.e. , where the surfaces of isometry are flat planes , and consider only the case of a pure ads bulk where @xmath14 for the background .",
    "there are a variety of formalisms available for studying this problem . in this section ,",
    "we explore some of these possibilities and discuss their various merits and drawbacks .",
    "there is no clear favourite , but some gauges are better for studying certain aspects of the problem .",
    "there are two different natural choices of coordinates in which it is convenient to express the background , in addition to the possibility of a coordinate - independent formalism .",
    "one natural choice is the gaussian normal ( gn ) coordinate system . in these coordinates the metric for the background ( non - perturbed ) spacetime has the form @xmath15 the main advantage of this coordinate system is that the brane remains at a fixed value of one of the coordinates , meaning that imposing the boundary condition due to the perturbed junction conditions is simple .",
    "the main disadvantage is that the metric components @xmath16 and @xmath17 have complicated functional forms and , as a consequence , the equations of motion are not separable .",
    "the other natural coordinate systems are ones where the static nature of the background is manifest .",
    "another way of writing the line element for a flat cosmology in an ads bulk is @xmath18 where the spacetime is manifestly conformally flat .",
    "( here , @xmath19 is the ads length - scale . )",
    "this coordinate system makes the five - dimensional linearized einstein equations simple .",
    "the price paid for this simplicity is that the brane is no longer at a fixed coordinate value , but has locus given by @xmath20 , making the boundary condition much more difficult to impose .",
    "in addition to the various coordinate systems for expressing the background , there are also various gauge choices for expressing the perturbations , as well as gauge - independent formalisms such as those used in  @xcite .",
    "the gauge we will use is the gn gauge , which arises by requiring that both the perturbed and unperturbed metrics have gn form , so that the perturbed line element has the form @xmath21 when using a gn background , this is a very natural choice and has the advantage of making it trivial to extract the perturbation of the brane metric , @xmath22 .",
    "note that this does not completely fix the gauge since it it possible to impose additional requirement on the values taken by certain components of perturbation variable on the brane .",
    "for example , we could impose @xmath23 on the brane , which would make the perturbation of the brane metric that of the synchronous gauge , a gauge often used in the treatment of perturbations in the standard , four - dimensional cosmology @xcite .",
    "if we chose to work in the conformally minkowski coordinates of ( [ confminkds ] ) , we would naturally write the perturbed metric as @xmath24 which would allow us to make various gauge choices . for example",
    ", @xcite used the transverse - traceless ( tt ) gauge where @xmath25 satisfies @xmath26 late in the history of the universe , the motion of the brane in this coordinate system is slow , so that the time coordinate , @xmath27 , is almost the same as conformal time on the brane and so the tt gauge is approximately a synchronous gauge .",
    "this setup has the advantage that the resulting perturbed einstein equations exactly soluble .",
    "however , in this gauge the position of the brane is not on the same locus as for the background but is displaced , an effect which has been dubbed `` brane - bending '' in the literature .",
    "we will be considering the evolution of perturbations by taking the fourier transform in the three spatial directions of the surfaces of isotropy and then evolving each fourier mode .",
    "thus , each mode has associated with it a length - scale given by @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the magnitude of the fourier transform variable .",
    "physically , we interpret @xmath29 as the comoving momentum of the mode and @xmath28 as the comoving wavelength .",
    "there is another length - scale , @xmath30 , given by the time dependent expansion rate of the universe , equivalent to the hubble radius of the universe . in the standard cosmology ,",
    "these are the only two length - scales , giving rise to a single dimensionless parameter , @xmath31 , which depends on time . in the language of cosmological perturbation theory ,",
    "this parameter tells us whether the mode is outside or inside the hubble horizon .    for perturbations in the rs model",
    ", there is another length - scale , namely the ads length - scale , @xmath19 .",
    "thus , we have three dimensionless parameters : @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 , two of which are independent .",
    "the first two of these depend on time : @xmath31 becomes larger at later times , whereas , @xmath32 is smaller at later times . both will ,",
    "of course , remain approximately constant during a period of inflation . as in the four - dimensional case",
    ", @xmath31 gives the scale of the mode relative to the horizon size .",
    "typically , the ads length - scale , @xmath19 will be less than @xmath1 mm whereas the length - scale of the perturbations @xmath28 will be greater than @xmath1mpc , so @xmath33 will be an extremely small number . except in the very early universe , @xmath32 will also be small since it is the hubble parameter measured in time units corresponding to @xmath1 mm .",
    "as already discussed , there are a variety of formalisms , each with its own merits . here",
    ", we shall use a gn coordinate system and gauge , so that the perturbed line element takes the form @xmath34 the brane is located at @xmath35 . note",
    "that our choice does not completely fix the gauge as , for example , we can set @xmath36 and @xmath37 to be zero on the brane , thereby having the brane metric in synchronous gauge . as a shorthand , we will denote derivatives with respect to @xmath38 and @xmath39 by dots and dashes respectively . note that @xmath36 and @xmath40 are irrelevant for the tensor perturbations studied here .",
    "the observed matter , @xmath41 , will comprise a background part into a background part @xmath42 and a perturbation @xmath43 with @xmath44 .",
    "this is similar to the formalism used in  @xcite .",
    "it has the great advantage that the brane metric in synchronous gauge can easily be read - off and standard cmb computer code ( such as cmbfast  @xcite ) can be applied to solve the boltzmann equations and determine the power spectrum of matter and cmb anisotropies .    for the rs model ,",
    "the bulk spacetime is pure ads , which has a length - scale , @xmath19 , related to the cosmological constant by @xmath45 the form of the functions @xmath46 and @xmath47 was found in @xcite to be @xmath48^{1/2}\\,,\\\\ n(\\tau,\\zeta)&=&n(\\tau,\\zeta)=\\frac{\\dot{a}(\\tau,\\zeta)a(\\tau,0)}{\\dot{a}(\\tau,0)}\\ , , \\label{sfn}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath49 is the total energy density supported on the brane , i.e. , the bare tension , @xmath50 , plus energy density of observed matter , @xmath51 . the metric component @xmath47 is chosen so that @xmath38 corresponds to conformal time on the brane .",
    "we will also tune the bare tension against the bulk cosmological constant so as to make the effective brane cosmological constant zero , for which we need to take @xmath52 . with this",
    "we get @xmath53 \\,.\\ ] ]    for convenience , we list the non - zero christoffel symbols for this background , which are @xmath54 and the non - zero components of the riemann tensor , which are @xmath55}}_{l]}\\,.\\ ] ] the bulk einstein equations give the following relations between the metric components @xmath56 the brane , at @xmath35 has extrinsic curvature given in gaussian normal coordinates by @xmath57 which has components @xmath58 from which we can deduce that @xmath59 note that some authors use the opposite sign convention for the extrinsic curvature .",
    "since we have chosen gn gauge , where the perturbed metric is in gn form , it is natural to consider the perturbation of the gauss relation ( [ 4dricci ] ) which is @xmath60 and perturbing ( [ kevolve ] ) and ( [ gevolve ] ) gives @xmath61 substituting these into ( [ gausspert ] ) and equating with the perturbations of the ricci tensor calculated from the metric gives the evolution equations for the metric perturbations .",
    "we will evaluate these evolution equations in the special case of tensor perturbations .",
    "perturbing the israel conditions of ( [ israel ] ) gives @xmath62 which will provide the boundary conditions we need at the brane .",
    "since we are aiming to evolve the equations of motion over the semi - infinite interval @xmath63 it would appear that a another boundary condition is not necessary .",
    "however , the coordinates used do not span the universal covering set of the ads spacetime ( see @xcite for more details on the universal covering set ) so we could expect that gravitational waves could cross the ads horizon .",
    "the choice of boundary condition on this horizon is somewhat arbitrary since we can have no knowledge of the other side ; this being a philosophical shortcoming of the randall  sundrum model . a reasonable , and popular , choice is to have no incoming radiation at the horizon , as advocated in  @xcite .    however , it is not possible to impose this boundary condition in addition to arbitrary initial conditions on some time - slice .",
    "so we can impose boundary data in two different ways :    1 .",
    "brane boundary condition and a condition at horizon .",
    "2 .   brane boundary condition and initial conditions at some time .",
    "the second of these is more in keeping with the orthodox approach to cosmological perturbation theory .",
    "however , it requires knowledge of what created in the first place .",
    "these are not as different as they might seem , we can gain a better understanding of how they are related , and of when it is necessary to specify boundary data at the horizon by considering carter ",
    "penrose conformal diagrams of the spacetime , see fig .",
    "[ cpdiagram ] .",
    "it is apparent from the diagrams that specifying data on the horizon is a limiting case of specifying data on a timelike initial surface .    to illustrate this further ,",
    "it is useful to consider the solution of the ordinary , wave equation in one spatial dimension , @xmath64 with a boundary condition @xmath65 at @xmath66 .",
    "the spatial part of the mode solutions are then of the form @xmath67 , multiplied by a time dependent part of the same frequency , @xmath68 . if we then impose a no incoming radiation condition , the solution is completely determined , and is constant , so it is not possible to impose initial data in addition .",
    "this can be seen more clearly by writing the general solution in the form @xmath69 .",
    "the no radiation condition would force us to take @xmath70 and the brane boundary condition necessitates that @xmath71 .    for studying the initial perturbation spectrum created in the inflationary era , it is useful to use the no - radiation boundary condition , as was done in  @xcite .",
    "once we have the perturbations at the end of inflation , we can evolve them forward through the radiation eras , for which we will have initial data on a time - slice , and then through the matter era .",
    "the perturbations in the four - dimensional part of the metric naturally split into scalar , vector and tensor parts with respect to the fourier transform variable , @xmath72 . to linear order in perturbation theory , they do not mix .",
    "of these the scalar perturbations are the most important since these contain the underdensities and overdensities giving rise to large - scale structure and so necessarily exist .",
    "as we have already suggested , it is much easier to solve the equations for the tensor perturbations .",
    "we have formulated the equations of motion for all three of these but will only provide solutions for the tensor modes .",
    "some of the lessons learned should assist in tackling the more difficult problem of the scalar modes .",
    "the variation of the purely spatial part of the ricci tensor is given by @xmath73 , so the tensor part is given by @xmath74 where the superscript @xmath75 represents either of the two tensor modes , which will evolve separately , to linear order , and will both obey the same equation of motion .",
    "equations ( [ diffkpert ] ) and ( [ diffgpert ] ) give us @xmath76 substituting these into the tensor part of ( [ gausspert ] ) gives @xmath77    the purely spatial part of the einstein equation ( [ backgroundeinstein ] ) evaluated for the background metric gives @xmath78 using this and equating ( [ rtens1 ] ) and ( [ rtens2 ] ) gives @xmath79 in agreement with the result in  @xcite .",
    "the boundary condition on @xmath80 at the brane is given by the perturbation of the purely spatial part of the junction condition ( [ israelij ] ) which becomes @xmath81 the tensor part can be written in terms of two polarization tensors @xmath82 and @xmath83 as @xmath84 so , in subsequent equations , we will simply write @xmath85 to represent either @xmath86 or @xmath87 .    for most of the history of the universe ,",
    "there is effectively no matter source for the tensor modes so this condition will reduce to @xmath88 on the brane .",
    "only when the cmb photons develop a quadrupole moment in the late universe is this assumption no longer valid .",
    "the wave equation ( [ tensorpertevol ] ) is not separable and is difficult to solve in general , due to the complicated form of the scale factors @xmath16 and @xmath17 , see ( [ aexpr ] ) .",
    "we will first study two cases where the equations can be solved exactly : the case of a minkowski brane and the case of a de sitter brane .",
    "the first of these was the case considered by randall and sundrum in their original paper  @xcite ; the second is very useful in cosmology for modeling an inflationary era in the early universe  @xcite .",
    "our main interest is in cases which correspond to different cosmological eras . in an inflationary model ,",
    "the universe will undergo a phase of accelerated expansion where the brane metric will be approximately de sitter .",
    "after a transition period , there will be an era where the matter content of the universe is dominated by a radiation fluid component , having equation of state @xmath89 .",
    "there will then be another transition to evolution dominated by pressureless matter . shortly after this transition",
    ", photons decouple from the cosmological plasma , producing the cmb radiation .",
    "since the eventual aim of studying perturbations is to determine theoretical cmb power spectra for rs models and compare these to the observed cmb spectrum , we should try to solve the problem in each of these eras .",
    "unfortunately , the equation of motion is not separable in the radiation and matter dominated eras so we will approximate the solution by one valid near the brane , ignoring the @xmath90 term in ( [ aexpr ] ) .",
    "the range of @xmath39 for which the near - brane limit is a good approximation depends on the density of the cosmological fluid . the value of @xmath39 for which @xmath91 is given by @xmath92 which will give us a qualitative idea of the domain of validity of such a solution .",
    "since @xmath3 will decrease with time in the radiation and matter eras , this domain of validity will get wider later in the history of the universe .",
    "the near - brane limit can also be thought of in some sense as a low energy limit , but the fact that it is an approximation suggests that discussion of a low - energy effective theory needs to be careful thought out .",
    "let us see where the locus of @xmath93 intersects the past light cone of a point on the brane today since this will correspond to the limit of causal validity of the near - brane limit .",
    "it is simpler to work in proper time on the brane , @xmath27 , so that a null geodesic satisfies @xmath94 near the brane .",
    "this integrates to give @xmath95 for the past light - cone , where @xmath96 is the time today .",
    "we want to compare this to ( [ goodapprox ] ) to see when we can argue that the approximation is good on causality grounds alone . during a matter dominated era of the universe ,",
    "the critical energy density is given by @xmath97 and the bare tension on the brane is related to the ads length - scale by @xmath52 .",
    "so , in the matter dominated era , ( [ goodapprox ] ) becomes @xmath98 which intersects the light - cone when @xmath99 .",
    "of course , the approximation used in ( [ nullde ] ) is good near the brane but breaks down as the null geodesic approaches the line ( [ goodapprox ] ) so this is only and order of magnitude estimate .",
    "nonetheless , this means that we can not use a causality argument to justify the approximation throughout the whole history  we would like to have obtained a time before the end of inflation as the answer !",
    "it seems clear that some mode mixing will take place .",
    "finally , we should point out that the near - brane approximation is also equivalent to an expansion in powers of @xmath100 ( or @xmath101 ) .",
    "since it involves ignoring the second term in ( [ aexpr ] ) , one could do this either because @xmath90 is small , or because @xmath102 is small .      for the rs case where the projected metric on the brane is minkowski , the functions @xmath16 and @xmath17 have the simple , separable form @xmath103 this simplifies ( [ rtens2 ] ) , giving @xmath104 or , equivalently , from ( [ tensorpertevol ] ) @xmath105 this equation has a constant solution , corresponding to a metric perturbation proportional to @xmath106 , which is the same as the solution found by randall and sundrum@xcite .",
    "they interpreted this as a graviton zero - mode localised on the brane , thus having the appearance of a four - dimensional gravitational perturbation .    to find a set of basis solutions , we perform a separation of variables , using the ansatz @xmath107 the equation of motion ( [ tensradevol ] ) then separates into @xmath108 where @xmath109 is a separation constant . because @xmath109 has dimensions of mass , modes with @xmath110 are referred to as massive modes , but it should be noted that @xmath109 can be negative .",
    "the solutions are @xmath111 where @xmath112 , @xmath113 , @xmath114 and @xmath115 are constants of integration and @xmath116 represents a linear combination of bessel functions of order @xmath117 .",
    "( the boundary conditions will determine which particular combination to choose . )",
    "randall and sundrum @xcite also showed that , in the newtonian limit , the contribution from the massive modes is sub  dominant , and so gravity has approximately four - dimensional behaviour .      during an era of inflation in the primordial universe ,",
    "the density of matter is almost constant , an so the spacetime is approximately a de sitter universe .",
    "for this reason it is useful to consider a brane - world where the brane metric takes de sitter form . for a de sitter brane ,",
    "the matter density of the background solution is a constant so scale factors @xmath16 and @xmath17 are separable functions .",
    "we shall work in conformal time , where they have the functional form @xmath118 where @xmath119 and @xmath120 is given by @xmath121 the wave equation ( [ tensorpertevol ] ) becomes @xmath122 we can find a set of basis solutions to this by performing the same separation of variables used in the rs case .",
    "writing @xmath123 , the wave equation splits into two parts : @xmath124 where @xmath109 is a separation constant as before .    in a de sitter era @xmath3 is a constant so , in conformal time , we have @xmath125 where @xmath126 is the energy scale for inflation , giving the evolution of the tensors as @xmath127 the solutions for @xmath128 are @xmath129 for @xmath130 , and @xmath131 for @xmath132 , where @xmath133 and @xmath112 and @xmath113 are constants of integration .",
    "the equation for @xmath36 reduces to a hypergeometric equation , which we can be solved exactly , but the solution is very complicated and not particularly informative .",
    "let us state briefly the @xmath134 solution , which is @xmath135    this de sitter case has been studied extensively in the literature .",
    "it was found that the kaluza ",
    "klein modes are not continuous , but there is a mass gap between the zero mode and the first massive mode . if one requires that @xmath136 is pure imaginary then @xmath137 . above that mass",
    "the spectrum is continuous . in @xcite",
    "it was argued that the tensor perturbation left after an inflationary era would mainly be comprised of the zero - mode solution , @xmath138 , and this result was made more quantitative in  @xcite where bogoliubov coefficients were calculated .",
    "thus , the perturbations produced from a period of inflation will be the zero - mode , @xmath139 , to good approximation .",
    "this has been extended to the case of any conformally flat brane metric in  @xcite .",
    "let us now consider the evolution of the tensor perturbations in the radiation - dominated epoch . as mentioned earlier",

    "the general solutions can then be written as a superposition of these modes of the form @xmath159 the evolution of the zero - mode is exactly the same as for the usual , four - dimensional cosmology based on general relativity . for all values of @xmath29 , the very heavy modes decay outside the horizon .    since special functions of this nature",
    "are not always easy to visualize , let us try to approximate to solution to ( [ depcf ] ) using the wkb method . first define the dimensionless parameter @xmath160 the wkb approximation for @xmath161 small recovers the asymptotic expansion given above .",
    "when @xmath161 is large , we rescale the time coordinate by @xmath162 , so that ( [ depcf ] ) is rewritten as @xmath163 we will use the formulation of the wkb approximation as described in @xcite , where a small parameter @xmath164 is introduced and an asymptotic solution of the form @xmath165 is postulated and the @xmath166 are functions to be determined .",
    "the parameter @xmath164 will be determined in terms of @xmath161 by a distinguished limit , i.e. , the choice for which a non - trivial answer is obtained . substituting ( [ wkbseries ] ) into the differential equation gives @xmath167 the term proportional to @xmath168 is the leading term on the left and so must match the right hand side .",
    "hence , we see that @xmath169 is the distinguished limit and @xmath170 the coefficients of the other powers of @xmath161 give differential equations for the other @xmath166 : for the next three , we have @xmath171 the solutions to these equations are @xmath172 which will give an approximation to @xmath173 .",
    "note that constants of integration have been omitted because they merely correspond to multiplying the solution by a constant factor .",

    "first , we will define the dimensionless variable @xmath182 and two rescaled time variables @xmath154 and @xmath183 which we will use in the limits @xmath184 and @xmath185 respectively .",
    "the equations of motion for @xmath128 are then @xmath186 and @xmath187      let us consider first the case where @xmath188 is small and use ( [ rescaledtensor1 ] ) .",
    "we can then find a solution using the wkb approximation as discussed in the previous section .",
    "we try to find an asymptotic solution of the form ( [ wkbseries ] ) , which , when substituted into ( [ rescaledtensor1 ] ) gives @xmath189 we see that the distinguished limit is when @xmath190 and that the @xmath166 are given by the differential equations @xmath191 for the first four terms . solving for these , we find @xmath192 substituting the first three of these into ( [ wkbseries ] ) along with the expressions for @xmath188 and @xmath27 , the solution with the first correction term is @xmath193 this solution is good for small @xmath29 and is progressively better for larger values of @xmath38 .",
    "we see that in the limit @xmath194 this solution reverts to the form ( [ psimatterm ] ) as one would expect .",
    "now consider the opposite limit where @xmath188 is large using ( [ rescaledtensor2 ] ) which is in a form suitable for using the wkb method as formulated above .",
    "we get @xmath196 and the following differential equations , @xmath197 for the first four terms ; the last three equations simplify to @xmath198 these have solutions @xmath199\\,,\\\\ s_3&=&\\frac{7t^4 + 2}{2t^2(1+t^4)^3}\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath200 are , respectively , elliptic integrals of the first and second kinds .",
    "these expressions are quite complicated , so let us consider the two limits where @xmath75 is small or large .",
    "when @xmath75 is small , the differential equations ( [ sde0]-[sde3 ] ) are @xmath201 so that the solution is approximately @xmath202 \\propto\\frac{e^{1/(k^2\\tau^2)}}{\\tau^2 } \\exp\\left[\\pm i\\left(k\\tau+\\frac{1}{k\\tau}\\right)\\right]\\ ] ] which should be a good approximation if @xmath203 .",
    "this approximate solution for small @xmath75 does not depend on @xmath204 , which is a consequence of the fact that the term involving @xmath204 is the equation of motion has a @xmath205 dependence .",

    "we are considering tensor perturbations here and since the matter on the brane has no tensor perturbation early in the universe , there is no matter source for these perturbations in the metric .",
    "so the boundary condition at the brane is @xmath88 .",
    "the @xmath39 dependence of the solution near the brane is the same in all eras , and its evolution is given by ( [ phiradeq ] ) , with solutions given in ( [ phisoln0 ] ) and ( [ phisolnm ] ) .",
    "the derivative of @xmath209 is @xmath210 so , if the junction condition is imposed , the massive modes are @xmath211 for which @xmath212 the zero - mode is simple a constant @xmath213 when the boundary condition is imposed .",
    "let us now try to impose initial conditions at some initial time , @xmath214 , which will , in practice , be the transition between two eras .",
    "this initial data must satisfy the boundary condition and will be expressible as a superposition of the mode solutions @xmath209 .",
    "this superposition is most easily calculated by considering the @xmath39 derivative of the initial data .",
    "so let us write @xmath215 where @xmath216 is the cylinder function @xmath217 we can deduce the @xmath218 from the orthogonality relation given in the appendix .",
    "the contribution from the zero - mode is just a constant , and this is , of course , the bit that is undetermined by considering @xmath219 .",
    "so we have a prescription for imposing any given initial conditions .",
    "the prescription given is somewhat academic , at least for the application under consideration here , because the spatial parts of the mode functions , @xmath209 , are the same in all eras , so the spectrum of modes present at the beginning of an era will be the same as the spectrum at the end of the previous era .",
    "in particular if inflation produces a perturbation which is well approximated by the zero - mode , as indeed it does according to  @xcite , then only the zero - mode is present during subsequent eras too .",
    "thus the evolution of tensor perturbations is the same as in the standard , four - dimensional case , and hence the contribution towards cmb anisotropies is the same .",
    "the absence of sources is responsible for this similarity , tensor matter perturbations on the brane would source the massive modes and give an answer different from the standard cosmology .",
    "the analysis presented here should extend to the scalar perturbations , although there are some additional technical difficulties .",
    "the scalar perturbations are not only the dominant contributions to the cmb anisotropies but are sourced by scalar matter perturbations so there will very probably be some signature of the rs model detectable in the cmb power spectrum .",
    "in this article we have discussed some aspects of tensor perturbations in the randall  sundrum brane - world . the problem can be formulated in several coordinate systems , each of which has its shortcomings . in gn",
    "coordinates , the brane is static and the boundary condition can easily be imposed .",
    "however , the equations of motion for tensor perturbations are not separable . by formulating the problem in static bulk",
    "coordinates in which the brane moves , the bulk equation can be solved but the boundary conditions are difficult to impose on the ( moving ) brane . therefore , an approximation scheme is necessary to make progress in both systems .",
    "we have presented solutions in the de sitter era , the radiation and matter dominated era using the near brane approximation first discussed in @xcite .",
    "the near - brane approximation is akin to an adiabatic treatment of the motion of the brane in that the warp factor @xmath46 has the same @xmath39 dependence as in the standard randall  sundrum picture for a minkowski brane , but is multiplied by the cosmological scale factor . in this lowest - order approximation ,",
    "independent modes persist throughout the radiation and matter eras .",
    "if this approximation is universally valid , which we have argued against on causality grounds , and the initial spectrum includes only the zero mode created during inflation then the observed tensor spectrum will be exactly that of the standard cosmological model .",
    "the zero mode is equivalent to the standard case of general relativity , but the massive modes have some novel features . in particular they can be seen to decay and oscillate outside the horizon , whereas standard massless gravitons only begin to oscillate at horizon crossing .",
    "one important consequence of this is that initial power spectrum of fluctuations in the massive modes can not be scale invariant as @xmath194 .",
    "there must exist a cut - off in the spectrum at very small values of @xmath29 .",
    "if one thinks of the perturbations as being particles created quantum mechanically during inflation then one can create those with @xmath220 just on energetic grounds .",
    "moreover , if massive modes exist and they decay outside the horizon , the photon quadrupole will increase without the need for thomson scattering since it will be sourced by the decay of the super - horizon gravitational potential .",
    "this could lead to a significant polarization signature in the angular power spectrum on large angular scales .",
    "it is worth noting that the equations of motion for the massive modes which we have solved here are equivalent to those of ordinary massless gravity with a mass term added to the lagrangian in an _ ad hoc _ way via an addition term of the form @xmath221 where @xmath204 is the graviton mass and @xmath222 is the 4d metric perturbation .",
    "although such a theory is believed to suffer from the van dam - veltman discontinuity  @xcite in the graviton propagator in going from @xmath134 to @xmath223 , this theorem will not apply in the rsii case where there is likely to be a spectrum of modes including the zero mode .",
    "it should be possible to incorporate non - adiabatic effects , by taking into account the non - separability of the equations .",
    "we anticipate that this will lead to mixing of the near - brane modes discussed in this paper , as considered in @xcite .",
    "this is likely to lead to non - trivial time evolution of the total perturbation amplitude and interesting cosmological signatures .",
    "the solutions found in this paper can be used to gain insights into the full problem .",
    "the non - linearity in the wave equation induced next - order correction to the expressions ( [ sfa ] ) and ( [ sfn ] ) for the scale factors @xmath46 and @xmath47 is the origin of the mode mixing phenomena in @xcite .",
    "the inclusion of a tensor matter component on the brane will source massive modes .",
    "the main source of this will be the photon quadrupole which develops late in the history of the universe .",
    "this issue will even more important in the case of scalar perturbations since the perturbations in the density , pressure and velocity will contribute to this .",
    "some of the methods discussed here should be of use in taking this effect into account .",
    "rab and cvdb are supported by pparc ; am is supported by emmanuel college , cambridge .",
    "we acknowledge useful conversations with martin bucher and toby wiseman .",
    "sturm  liouville theory tells us that our basis functions will be orthogonal , but we need to know the normalization .",
    "we will derive the orthogonality here explicitly for the bessel and parabolic cylinder functions used and determine the coefficient of the delta function in the orthogonality relation .",
    "there is a standard formula for bessel functions which tells us that @xmath224 where @xmath225 and @xmath226 are any two bessel functions of order @xmath117 and @xmath227 .",
    "this can be derived by an argument given in  @xcite .",
    "if we consider two functions @xmath228 and @xmath229 which satisfy the differential equations @xmath230 for some functions @xmath231 , then @xmath232 applying this to bessel s equation , we see that @xmath233 if @xmath234 and @xmath235 are chosen to vanish , or have vanishing derivatives , on the boundary .",
    "we are interested in the specific case @xmath236 with @xmath237 , and @xmath238 asymptotically , when @xmath239 is large .",
    "so the constant of proportionality can be deduced  @xcite to be @xmath240    for the time - dependent parts of the mode solutions , @xmath241 , we can construct a similar orthogonality relation the @xmath173 satisfy the differential equation ( [ depcf ] ) @xmath242 so applying the same argument as before gives @xmath243 where the r.h.s .",
