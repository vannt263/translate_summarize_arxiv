    "the relation between the percolation problem and thermal phase transitions of lattice spin systems has been a question of intense research for at least three decades .",
    "clusters of even spins are natural objects occurring in the analysis of phase ordering processes and nucleation @xcite , and a theory of critical phenomena in terms of purely geometrical objects appears appealing . in this context",
    ", it had long been surmised that a continuous phase transition of a spin system might be accompanied ( or , in fact , caused ) by a percolation transition of the clusters of like spins ( _ geometric clusters _ ) , the appearance of a percolating cluster sustaining the onset of a non - zero magnetisation @xcite .",
    "while for the special case of the potts model in two dimensions it turned out that , indeed , the thermal phase transition point coincides with the percolation transition of the spin clusters , this behaviour is not generic and does not occur in three - dimensional systems @xcite . also , the critical exponents associated to the percolation of geometric clusters are not directly related to the thermal exponents of the spin model @xcite . however , a close relation between the percolation and thermal phase transitions can be established by considering _ stochastically _ defined clusters ( or droplets ) as they occur in the fortuin - kasteleyn ( fk ) representation of the potts model , and it can be shown that , in fact , the potts model is equivalent to a site - bond correlated percolation problem @xcite such that the corresponding critical exponents agree .",
    "this identification of the proper cluster objects ( _ fk clusters _ ) percolating at the thermal phase transition subsequently also allowed for the design of _ cluster algorithms _ for the efficient simulation of potts models in the vicinity of the ordering transition @xcite , beating the observed critical slowing down of local update algorithms .",
    "similarly , relations of continuous - spin models to percolation problems could be established and corresponding cluster algorithms formulated @xcite , such that the continuous phase transitions of many standard models of statistical mechanics are by now understood in terms of the percolation properties of some suitably defined ensemble of stochastic clusters .",
    "although not in the universality class of the thermal phase transition , the clusters of like spins or geometric clusters still undergo a percolation transition in the course of thermal phase ordering .",
    "this transition is in general not equivalent to ordinary ( site or bond ) percolation @xcite and it remains an interesting open question to determine the general critical behaviour of clusters of aligned spins . for the case of the two - dimensional ising model",
    ", it has been conjectured and numerically verified that the geometric clusters are described by the @xmath2 tricritical potts model @xcite ; this correspondence can be understood from a direct construction starting from the dilute potts model @xcite .",
    "subsequently , analogous conjectures for the @xmath3 potts models were made and some of them substantiated by numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "analytical calculations concerning clusters occurring in systems of statistical physics and their boundaries , traditionally based on methods of conformal field theory and the coulomb gas @xcite , have recently seen major advances from the insight that fractal random curves can be described in a framework dubbed _ stochastic loewner evolution _ ( sle ) @xcite .",
    "collecting these observations , a more systematic analysis of the relation between the critical and tricritical branches of the potts model and their connection to the fk and geometric clusters has been performed , resulting in the identification of exact values for the different cluster fractal dimensions and their numerical verification @xcite .    coupling spin models to the planar random lattices of the dynamical triangulations model of two - dimensional euclidean",
    "quantum gravity @xcite corresponds to the introduction of a particular type of annealed connectivity disorder .",
    "the resulting randomness is strong , leading to a change in critical behaviour of virtually all types of coupled matter variables @xcite .",
    "geometrically , it is characterised by a large fractal dimension @xmath4 of these lattices of topological dimension two .",
    "it is interesting to see how the relation between geometric and fk clusters of the potts model works out far away from the regularity of a bravais lattice .",
    "the mentioned relations between geometric and fk clusters have not yet been rigorously established , such that evidence from further models is highly welcome support . besides , the behaviour of these fractal cluster objects on lattices which are themselves highly fractal is of particular interest in itself .",
    "the dynamical triangulations approach provides a constructive model for euclidean quantum gravity in general dimensions @xcite .",
    "it regularizes the path integral over fluctuating metrics naturally occurring in an attempt to quantize the gravitational interaction by a sum over combinatorial manifolds realised as simplicial complexes @xcite . in two dimensions ,",
    "the resulting canonical ensemble of discrete surfaces can be defined as that of all possible gluings of a given number @xmath5 of equilateral triangles to a closed surface of fixed ( usually spherical ) topology , where all resulting triangulations are counted with the same weight in the partition sum .",
    "this is a purely combinatorial definition , and due to the equilaterality of the triangles the resulting triangulations can not in general be embedded in the euclidean @xmath6 and , in fact , one is only interested in their _ intrinsic _ geometry .",
    "many counting problems related to these graphs can be solved exactly by using matrix integrals or general combinatorial techniques @xcite . for our purposes",
    "it is sufficient to note that the resulting random graphs are highly fractal with blobs ( `` baby universes '' ) of arbitrary size being connected to the main graph body with a minimal number of links .",
    "this structure entails an internal hausdorff dimension @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "decorating the vertices ( or edges , faces ) of the graphs with matter variables , corresponding to an annealed geometrical average , leads to a change of universality class at criticality , expressed through a dressing of the conformal weights @xmath8 of the matter fields given by the kpz formula @xcite , @xmath9 where @xmath10 denotes the central charge of the coupled matter model .",
    "analogously , the change of the string - susceptibility exponent @xmath11 can be expressed in terms of @xmath10 @xcite .    as mentioned above ,",
    "the fractal properties of fk and geometric clusters of the square - lattice ising model have been studied rather extensively @xcite . here , we are interested in the ( normalised ) fractal dimensions @xmath12 resp .",
    "@xmath13 of the incipient percolating fortuin - kasteleyn resp .  geometric cluster at criticality ( where @xmath14 denotes the spatial dimension ) .",
    "for the fk clusters , @xmath15 is an exact result @xcite . from the identification of the geometric ising clusters with the fk clusters of a @xmath2 tricritical potts model",
    ", one finds @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "these values are related to the conformal weights @xmath8 above as @xmath17 @xcite . to describe the coupling of the two - dimensional ising model to quantum gravity , the resulting weights @xmath18 and @xmath19 have to be dressed according to eq .",
    "( [ dressing_kpz ] ) . since for both , the ising and @xmath2 tricritical potts models , the central charge @xmath20 , from ( [ dressing_kpz ] ) we find @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "therefore , we expect the following cluster fractal dimensions for the ising model coupled to dynamical triangulations , @xmath23 which now have been written in units of the hausdorff dimension @xmath24 of the graphs coupled to the spin model , the value of which is not known exactly but numerically found to be consistent with @xmath7 for all @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "for a numerical simulation of the system , due to the annealed nature of the disorder both , the underlying dynamical triangulations as well as the coupled ising spins , must be updated in parallel .",
    "an ergodic set of monte carlo updates for the dynamical triangulations is given by the so - called pachner moves @xcite .",
    "for the canonical ensemble of a fixed number @xmath5 of triangles in two dimensions , these reduce to the following flip between two adjacent triangles ,    [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : exponents ]",
    "we have shown how the fractal dimensions associated with the geometric clusters of the potts model coupled to the dynamical triangulations model of euclidean quantum gravity in two dimensions can be inferred from a mapping to the tricritical branch of the potts model . to allow for an application of the kpz framework ,",
    "the conformal weights associated to the fractal dimensions @xmath26 of the cluster , @xmath27 of the cluster hull , @xmath28 of the external perimeter and @xmath29 of the cluster red bonds have been identified from the kac table . lifting the corresponding weights of the critical and tricritical branches to the dynamical triangulations results in rational values for the fractal dimensions of fk and geometric clusters for the @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 state potts models summarised in table [ tab : exponents ] .",
    "the duality symmetry @xmath35 present between the critical and tricritical weights on regular lattices , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : critical_operators ] ) and ( [ eq : tricritical_operators ] ) , is no longer present in the dressed weights of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : dressed_critical ] ) and ( [ eq : dressed_tricritical ] ) . as a peculiarity",
    ", we note that the fractal dimension of the geometric cluster hulls is a constant @xmath36 independent of @xmath0 . a scaling or duality relation between the dimensions of the external perimeter and cluster hulls found valid for the regular case @xcite",
    ", @xmath37 does not apply to the model coupled to quantum gravity , but instead one gets , @xmath38 also , while the four fractal dimensions fulfil the identity @xmath39 for regular lattices @xcite , for the random - lattice case we instead find @xmath40 .",
    "a couple of further similar scaling relations can be formulated .",
    "our simulation results for the case of the @xmath1 potts or ising model coupled to dynamical triangulations show full consistency of the measured fractal dimensions of the fortuin - kasteleyn and geometric clusters with the predictions resulting from the kpz mapping , confirming that the properties of the geometric potts clusters on dynamical triangulations are described by the corresponding tricritical potts model of the same central charge .",
    "corrections to scaling are found to be much stronger for the random - graph model than for the square - lattice simulations performed as a gauge .",
    "these corrections , known to result from the small effective linear extents of the graphs due to their large hausdorff dimension @xmath4 @xcite , have to be explicitly taken into account to find consistency with the scaling predictions and satisfactory quality of the fits .",
    "it would be interesting to see whether , as expected , the fractal dimensions of the geometric clusters of the @xmath41 potts models coupled to dynamical triangulations follow the predictions summarised in table [ tab : exponents ] , in particular for the case of @xmath42 , where the critical and tricritical branches coalesce and the kpz mapping ( [ dressing_kpz ] ) becomes marginal due to central charge @xmath43 .",
