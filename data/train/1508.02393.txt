    "different processes , taking place in the early universe , may have generated a primordial gravitational wave background , such as , among others , quantum perturbations during inflation , cosmic strings , pre - big - bang theories , etc ( for a complete review see @xcite and references therein ) . detecting this cosmological gravitational wave background ( hereafter cgwb )",
    "provides a unique way to probe the primordial universe and its evolution .",
    "+ the cgwb can be measured at low frequencies constraining a possible tensor - mode contribution to the large - scale temperature and polarization fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background radiation ( hereafter cmb ) .",
    "the most recent constrain on the tensor - to - scalar ratio is the one published by the planck collaboration in 2015 @xcite , i.e. @xmath4 at 95% c.l .",
    "@xcite , which corresponds to @xmath5 in the frequency range @xmath6 hz .",
    "+ at higher frequencies , in the range @xmath7 hz , pulsars can be used as natural gravitational wave detectors , e.g. from the last european pulsar timing array ( epta ) data release , lentati et al . constrain the amplitude of gw up to @xmath8 at 2.8 nhz @xcite . at smaller scales , interferometers such as ligo @xcite and virgo @xcite are also looking for gravitational wave signals .",
    "the most recent bound , at @xmath9 hz , is @xmath10 from the cross correlation between ligo and virgo detectors @xcite .",
    "+ moreover , at frequencies greater than @xmath11 hz , the stochastic background can be constrained through big - bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) .",
    "in fact , at these frequencies , primordial gravitational waves contribute to the total radiation energy density , increasing the expansion rate of the universe . in this scenario",
    ", the cgwb behaves as a free - streaming gas of massless particles .",
    "measuring primordial abundances of light elements it is possible to constrain the total number of relativistic degrees of freedom and , consequently , the gravitational waves energy density , for scales smaller then the comoving horizon at the end of the bbn @xcite .",
    "+ straightforwardly , it is possible to constrain the total radiation density through the cmb , reaching even smaller frequencies , @xmath12 hz , corresponding to the comoving horizon at the decoupling . in particular , if the cgwb energy density perturbations are adiabatic , the extra energy contribution due to gravitational waves is indistinguishable from the one due to relativistic neutrinos . therefore , if we fix the relativistic degrees of freedom to its standard value , @xmath13 , and parametrize all the extra radiation as the effective number of gravitational waves degrees of freedom , @xmath14 , it is then easy to translate @xmath14 into a cgwb energy density , as pointed out in @xcite .",
    "+ in this paper we update previous constraints on the cgwb energy density , as those presented in @xcite , in light of the latest planck data release and we present the bound reachable combining the future satellite missions core and euclid .",
    "in this section we discuss the datasets used in the analysis and the obtained results . we make use of the latest cmb temperature and polarization power spectra of the planck survey @xcite together with the planck lensing likelihood @xcite , the baryonic acoustic oscillations observations of @xcite and the most recent primordial deuterium abundance observation by cooke et al .",
    "+ we explore the cosmological parameters space with the july 2015 version of the publicly available ` cosmomc ` package @xcite .",
    "we adopt the following parametrization for the @xmath15cdm model : the baryon and cold dark matter densities @xmath16 and @xmath17 , the ratio of the sound horizon to the angular diameter distance at decoupling @xmath18 , the re - ionization optical depth @xmath19 , the scalar spectral index @xmath20 , and the overall normalization of the spectrum @xmath21 at @xmath22 .",
    "furthermore we assume adiabatic initial conditions and we impose spatial flatness .",
    "we fix the relativistic degrees of freedom , parametrized as @xmath23 , to its standard value of @xmath24 and , for each mcmc sample , we compute the primordial helium abundance assuming standard bbn @xcite , using a recent fitting formula based on results from the ` parthenope ` bbn code @xcite . +",
    "as mentioned above , we parametrize the extra relativistic content due to the cgwb as @xmath14 , adding it to the total amount of massless neutrinos . to translate @xmath14 to the cgwb energy density",
    ", we assume that the contribution from a single massless particle to a monochromatic cgwb is @xmath25 , therefore ( following @xcite ) : @xmath26 the effective number of gravitational waves degrees of freedom , acting as extra radiation , is completely degenerate with the extra relativistic degrees of freedom . therefore ,",
    "our bounds are model dependent , in fact , any process , that modifies the standard radiation content of the universe , will affect the @xmath14 bounds .",
    "for example , the presence of extra relativistic particles at recombination ( for example sterile neutrinos @xcite ) will tighten the bounds up .",
    "on the other hand , a reheating phase at @xmath27 temperature can produce a value of @xmath23 lower than the standard one @xcite , relaxing the bounds on @xmath14 .",
    "+ we test different combinations of data , starting from planck 2015 cmb data alone and then adding bao observations , lensing data and the primordial deuterium abundance measurement .",
    "we show in figure [ fig : whisker ] the @xmath28 c.l .",
    "upper limits for the cgwb energy density @xmath29 . in table",
    "[ tab : results ] we report the obtained upper limits on @xmath29 and @xmath14 for all the data combination that we consider . + the planck alone constraint is comparable with current upper bounds estimated by the ligo - virgo collaboration in 2014 @xcite ; adding the bao observations we reach @xmath30 at 95% c.l .. combining cmb power spectra with the lensing likelihood and the bao data we obtain a more stringent constraint , @xmath31 ; finally , assuming standard bbn @xcite , we add also the primordial deuterium abundance measurement reaching @xmath32 at 95% c.l . , improving the precedent planck constraint by a factor of about @xmath33 @xcite , the pre - planck cosmological constraint @xcite ( based on wmap @xcite and south pole telescope @xcite results ) by a factor of @xmath34 and the current interferometer measurements by about @xmath35 .",
    "+ it is also interesting to forecast the future sensitivity on @xmath29 achievable with future satellite missions such as core @xcite and euclid @xcite . to this end",
    "we simulate mock data for the core mission using the 5 channels in the range 100 - 220 ghz , following the approach described in @xcite , assuming perfect foreground removal and ignoring correlations between multipoles . analyzing this dataset",
    "we find that the core mission will be able to constrain the cgwb energy density to @xmath36 at 95% c.l .. for the euclid mission we use the fisher matrix approach as described in @xcite ; we then combine the inverse covariance matrix produced by ` cosmomc ` for core with the euclid fisher matrix obtaining @xmath37 at 95% c.l ..",
    "we have used the latest planck data to constrain a possible cosmological gravitational wave background at frequencies greater than @xmath38 hz .",
    "our tighter constraint is @xmath2 at 95% c.l .",
    ", obtained combining cmb with bao , lensing and primordial deuterium observations .",
    "this result improves previous cosmological bounds by a factor 2 and the recent ligo - virgo direct measurements by 50% .",
    "+ we also show that with the next generation cosmological satellite missions ( core and euclid ) would be possible to shrink the bounds by more than one order of magnitude with respect to current limits .",
