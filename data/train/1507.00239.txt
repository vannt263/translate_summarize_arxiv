    "<S> this has dramatic implications in terms of implementation : in particular , the commitment time can easily be made arbitrarily long , by only requiring both parties to communicate classically and perform efficient classical computation .    over the last decades , which witnessed the rapid expansion of quantum information , </S>",
    "<S> a new trend has developed : trying to obtain security guarantees based solely on the laws of physics . </S>",
    "<S> perhaps the most compelling example is quantum key distribution @xcite where two distant parties can exploit quantum theory to extract unconditionally secure keys provided that they have access to an untrusted quantum channel and an authenticated classical channel . </S>",
    "<S> however , many cryptographic applications can not be obtained only with secure key distribution . </S>",
    "<S> one important example is two - party cryptography , which deals with the setting where alice and bob want to perform a cryptographic task but do not trust each other . </S>",
    "<S> this is in contrast with key distribution where alice and bob cooperate and fight against a possible eavesdropper .    </S>",
    "<S> two - party cryptography has numerous applications , ranging from authentication to distributed cryptography in the cloud . </S>",
    "<S> these protocols are usually separated into building blocks , called _ </S>",
    "<S> primitives_. one of the most studied primitives is _ bit commitment _ , which often gives a strong indication of whether two - party cryptography is possible or not in a given model . </S>",
    "<S> for example , there are many constructions of bit commitment protocols under computational assumptions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is then natural to ask whether quantum theory can provide security for two - party cryptographic primitives such as bit commitment or oblivious transfer . </S>",
    "<S> a general no - go theorem was proved in 1996 by mayers and lo - chau @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> several attempts were made to circumvent this impossibility result by limiting the storage possibilities of the cheating party @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> an alternative approach to obtain secure primitives , pioneered by kent @xcite , consists in combining quantum theory with special relativity , more precisely with the physical principle that information can not propagate faster than the speed of light . </S>",
    "<S> this has opened the way to new , secure , bit commitment protocols @xcite , with the caveat that the commitment time is not arbitrary long in general but depends on the physical distance between the parties or on the number of parties involved .    </S>",
    "<S> a major open question of the field is therefore to design a secure practical bit commitment protocol , for which the commitment time can be increased arbitrarily at a reasonable cost in terms of implementation complexity . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we examine a protocol due to lunghi _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , which is itself adapted from based on an earlier proposal of simard @xcite . in their recent breakthrough paper , lunghi _ et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ showed that it was possible to extend the commitment time by using a multi round generalization of the simard protocol , and established its security against classical adversaries . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , the required resources scale double exponentially with the commitment time , making the protocol impractical for realistic applications . for instance , with the optimal configuration on earth ( meaning that each party has agents occupying antipodal locations on earth ) , the commitment time is limited to less than a second . here </S>",
    "<S> , we provide a new security analysis establishing that the dependence is in fact linear , provided that the dishonest player is classical . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that arbitrary long commitment times can be achieved even if both parties are only a few kilometers apart . </S>",
    "<S> we first present the relativistic bit commitment scheme studied by lunghi _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _ </S>",
    "<S> and we will then establish its security .    * the lunghi _ </S>",

    "<S> both players , alice and bob , have agents @xmath0 and @xmath1 present at two spatial locations 1 and 2 . </S>",
    "<S> let us consider the case where alice makes the commitment . </S>",
    "<S> the protocol ( followed by honest players ) consists of 4 phases : preparation , commit , sustain and reveal . </S>",
    "<S> the sustain phase is itself composed of many rounds , and each such round involves a pair of agents ( alternating between locations 1 and 2 ) referred to as the active players . </S>",
    "<S> overall the bit commitment protocol goes as follows .    1 </S>",
    "<S> .   _ preparation phase _ : @xmath2 ( resp .  </S>",
    "<S> @xmath3 ) share @xmath4 random numbers @xmath5 ( resp .  </S>",

    "<S> 3 .   _ sustain phase _ </S>",
    "<S> : at round @xmath17 , active bob sends @xmath18 to active alice , who returns @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> 4 .   _ reveal phase _ : @xmath14 reveals @xmath20 and @xmath21 to @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath12 checks that @xmath22 .    here , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath23 and @xmath24 refer to the field addition and multiplication in @xmath11 .    * security definition*. we follow the definitions of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the security requirements differ in the case of honest alice and honest bob . in the former case </S>",
    "<S> , bob should not be able to guess the committed value right before the reveal phase . </S>",
    "<S> the protocol should therefore be _ hiding _ , and it will actually be perfectly hiding here , meaning that bob can not guess the committed bit value better than with a random guess . </S>",
    "<S> security for honest bob is defined differently : the protocol should be _ binding _ , meaning that alice should not be able to decide the value of the committed bit after the commit phase . </S>",
    "<S> we follow the standard definition for bit commitment ( also used in @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath25 the probability that the alice successfully reveals bit value @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> we say that the protocol is @xmath26-binding if @xmath27 .    * timing constraints for the protocol*. the two pairs @xmath28 and @xmath29 are at a certain distance @xmath20 . at each round @xmath30 </S>",
    "<S> , there is an _ active _ ( alice , bob ) pair that performs the protocol while the other , _ passive _ , pair waits . at the end of round @xmath30 , they switch roles and perform round @xmath31 .    </S>",
    "<S> we require that round @xmath30 finishes before any information about @xmath32 reaches the other alice . for any @xmath30 </S>",
    "<S> , we therefore have the following : active alice has no information about @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> this means that @xmath33 is independent of @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> this will be crucial in order to show security of the protocol .    </S>",
    "<S> * our result*. our main contribution is to present an improved security proof for this protocol . in particular </S>",
    "<S> , this allows for implementations of this protocol that last for an ( almost ) arbitrary amount of time while the previous implementations were only secure for ( much less than ) a second @xcite .    in order to prove the security of the protocol </S>",
    "<S> , we present an inductive argument on the number of rounds of the protocol and show that at each round , the cheating parameter for alice increases by at most @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the number of transmitted bits per round . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , the proof involves the study of @xmath36 , which is a generalization of the @xmath37 game in the field @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> lunghi _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ also studied an extension of the @xmath36 game , which they called `` number on the forehead game '' . </S>",
    "<S> however , their security proof quickly becomes inefficient as the number of rounds increases .    </S>",
    "<S> * the @xmath38 game*. a crucial tool of our security proof is the analysis of the chsh@xmath39 game introduced by buhrman and massar @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this game is a natural generalisation of the chsh game to the field @xmath11 , where two non - communicating parties , alice and bob , are each given an input @xmath40 and @xmath41 chosen uniformly at random from @xmath11 , and must output two numbers @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> they win the game whenever the condition @xmath43 is satisfied . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath36 game has been much less studied in the litterature @xcite than its @xmath44 variant ( see @xcite for a recent review on nonlocality ) . a recent result by bravarian and shor @xcite establishes rather tight bounds on the classical and quantum values of the @xmath36 game . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , for prime or odd power of prime @xmath8 , one has : @xmath45 for some absolute constant @xmath46 .    </S>",
    "<S> these results hold only for a uniform input distribution . in order to use our inductive technique , </S>",
    "<S> we need to bound the value of this game for unbalanced inputs . </S>",
    "<S> it appears that the result of bavarian and shor does nt easily extend to this setting . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore developed new proof techniques that are based on using non - signaling constraints for the study of classical strategies .    </S>",
    "<S> let us consider a family of games , denoted by @xmath47 , where games are parametrized by the probability distribution @xmath48 for alice s input @xmath40 satisfying the constraint @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> for these games , bob s input distribution is uniform over @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , @xmath50 . the special case with @xmath44 was considered in @xcite where the following results are proved : @xmath51 note that for @xmath44 , alice s input distribution is entirely determined by the value of @xmath10 . in order to prove upper bounds on the value of games in @xmath47 , </S>",
    "<S> we show that if alice and bob can win such a game with high probability then alice has a method to obtain some information about bob s input , something that is prohibited by the non - signaling principle . </S>",
    "<S> this technique does nt directly extend to the quantum setting because alice s method requires her to perform her game strategy for different inputs , which could disturb the underlying shared entangled state .    </S>",
    "<S> our main technical result is an upper bound on the classical value for games in @xmath47 .    </S>",
    "<S> [ lemma ] for any game @xmath52 , we have @xmath53    fix a game @xmath52 . as usual </S>",
    "<S> , the classical value of the game can always be achieved with a deterministic strategy , meaning that without loss of generality , alice and bob s strategies can be modeled by functions @xmath54 and @xmath55 , namely : @xmath56 and @xmath57 . </S>",
    "<S> define the variable @xmath58 equal to @xmath59 if @xmath60 and @xmath61 otherwise .    </S>",
    "<S> our proof is by contradiction : if @xmath62 is too large , then alice could use her box to obtain some information about @xmath41 , which is prohibited by non signaling . </S>",
    "<S> more precisely , consider the following strategy for alice : pick a random pair of distinct inputs @xmath63 according to the distribution @xmath64 , i.e. with probability @xmath65 where @xmath66 , and output the guess @xmath67 for @xmath41 defined by @xmath68 . </S>",
    "<S> denote by @xmath69 the probability of correctly guessing the value @xmath41 . </S>",
