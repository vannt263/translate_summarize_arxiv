    "the motion of dye , or a temperature field , in a randomly stirred fluid leads to an equation for the dye density where the random velocity @xmath5 is coupled to dye density @xmath6 in a multiplicative way @xmath7 . obeying the equation @xmath8 in two and higher dimensions this is normally studied with the incompressibility condition @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath10 is a diffusion constant , and @xmath11 is a random function of position and time .",
    "this problem has received much recent attention  @xcite .",
    "the schroedinger equation with a random time dependent potential is another example  @xcite , although it will not be investigated here , and this is almost identical to the equation for wave propagation in random media  @xcite .",
    "population growth models which are relevant to chemical reactions  @xcite , population biology  @xcite and low temperature quantum systems  @xcite are often of this form @xmath12 where @xmath13 is a random function of position and time , @xmath14 and @xmath10 are parameters .",
    "dye laser theory also leads to an equation with both types of noise  @xcite .",
    "polymers in turbulent flow also make use of such equations  @xcite .",
    "the inclusion of additive noise most frequently corresponds to adding thermal fluctuations to the problem . in some cases",
    "it is a source term and replaces the effect of a boundary .",
    "for example in turbulent raleigh - bernard convection , where a liquid is heated from below , hot  plumes\"@xcite form and rise up through a liquid . in this case @xmath6 in eqn .",
    "( [ eq : passive ] ) represents the temperature field , and a source term in this equation should be added representing heat flow through the boundaries .    a one component problem similar to that studied here has been analyzed by drummond  @xcite .",
    "however his analysis is not completely applicable to the systems mentioned above as in these cases the additive and multiplicative noise are uncorrelated with each other .",
    "however he also finds two regimes , one with all moments defined and the other with a divergence at a finite moment .",
    "the classification into different two regimes is very similar to the one component case  @xcite where it was shown that there there are two different types of behavior found for the probability distribution function ( pdf ) .",
    "there it was shown that the pdf has power law tails in one regime and stretched exponential in another . in section [ sec : many ] the n - component vector version of these equations is considered for the case where both kinds of noise are white and gaussian . here under certain symmetry conditions it is shown that one also finds a power law tail for the pdf of any of the vector s components .",
    "an important example of non - power law tails involving many components is eqn .",
    "( [ eq : passive ] ) .",
    "@xmath15 in this case should lead to a stretched exponential or an exponential tail for the pdf of dye density .",
    "such distributions have been observed experimentally and have already been the subject of much theoretical work .",
    "the argument presented here for these tails is much general and just relies on mass conservation , that fact that dye is conserved .",
    "is there a physical system similar to eqn .",
    "( [ eq : passive ] ) where the dye particles are not conserved ?",
    "an example of such a system would be a reactive fluid , where heat is generated by particles reacting with each other . such a system would have lyapunov exponents that cross over to the first regime .",
    "this leads to the interesting prediction that such systems can exhibit power tails .",
    "this will be discussed in section [ sec : reaction ] .",
    "numerical confirmation of this prediction is given in section  [ sec : numerics ] .",

    "( [ eq : vector ] ) when the additive noise term @xmath16 is zero . in this case",
    "there is not a well defined steady state probability distribution .",
    "however this case can also be understood by considering the time dependence of the distribution for long times .",
    "we shall see that there is a scaling form of this distribution for long times which is identical in form to the one - component case .      without the additive noise ,",

    "the multiplication of random matrices has been well studied . for long times",
    "it has been proved that @xmath24 has an exponential dependence on time for long times  @xcite .",
    "fluctuations in this system are large in the sense that higher moments do not scale in a trivial way with lower moments . in one",
    "considers a single component of @xmath6 , @xmath25 then if @xmath26 , then @xmath27 , where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are not trivially related .",
    "this can be seen to be true even in the scalar case where the matrices are dimensions @xmath30 and hence commute . in summary , one can define a generalized lyapunov exponent @xmath15 by  @xcite @xmath31 where the brackets denote an ensemble average over the noise @xmath32 .",
    "now we would like to work out the form of the pdf of @xmath6 , one of the components of @xmath33 .",
    "this situation is similar to the problem of multifractals and its solution works out the same way .",
    "it can be checked that the distribution giving such scaling is @xmath34    another way of deriving this scaling form is by a thermodynamic analogy  @xcite .",
    "the discretized version of eqn . ( [ eq : formal ] ) can be thought of as a coupled one dimensional spin system , where each spin has @xmath35 states but with random interactions @xmath36 .",

    "( [ eq : matrix ] ) can be rewritten @xmath64 the objective here is to show that there exists some finite @xmath50 beyond which the moments do not exist .",
    "generically this will occur when the highest eigenvalue of @xmath63 passes through zero .",
    "positive eigenvalues show that the solution has become ill defined , and that the moments have ceased to exist .",
    "note that if the nth moments exist , the moments of order @xmath51 must also exist , and hence the right hand side of eqn .",
    "( [ eq : inverse ] ) exists .",
    "therefore one accomplishes the above objective by showing that the inverse matrix on the right hand side of eqn .",
    "( [ eq : inverse ] ) has eigenvalues that must pass from negative to positive , as n is increased .    from the end of section [ sec :",
    "moments ] , the value of @xmath50 where this occurs corresponds to the point where @xmath62 passes through zero .",
    "this condition is in agreement with the result obtained through the heuristic argument of the preceding publication  @xcite .",
    "thus to show this divergence , one must find the dependence of the eigenvalues of @xmath63 on @xmath50 , the order of the moments .",
    "one must show that at least one of the eigenvalues of this matrix become positive for sufficiently large n.    note that the eigenvalues of @xmath63 will span some finite domain @xmath65 to @xmath66 both of which are difficult to ascertain .",
    "however one can find a number between these two extremes by forming the scalar product @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is any unit vector . if this scalar product becomes positive ,",
    "then at least one eigenvalue is greater than zero , and therefore the nth moment is divergent .",
    "if one makes the choice @xmath69 then the scalar product can be evaluated . at this point",
    "we restrict the random matrices @xmath32 to be either real symmetric or anti - symmetric .",
    "@xmath70 now we need to analyze the behavior of this expression as a function of @xmath50 .",
    "the first two summations have prefactors proportional to @xmath50 , where as the last term is proportional to @xmath71 and must be positive . therefore this scalar product must become positive for sufficiently large n.    if we consider this scalar product as the @xmath72 s are varied one obtains a similar result .",
    "suppose we start with @xmath72 s that are sufficiently negative that the nth moment exists .",
    "as the @xmath72 s become less negative , at some point the scalar product becomes positive .",
    "therefore at this point the moments @xmath73 are ill defined .",
    "therefore for a fixed order of moments n , the moments can be made ill defined by varying the matrix @xmath3 .",
    "these arguments show that for a system described by eqn ( [ eq : vector ] ) , there must always be moments of the @xmath6 s that diverge if sufficiently high moments are examined .",
    "all of the moments of a given order are expected to diverge at the same time , if the matrix @xmath74 is not transformable to block diagonal form .",
    "block diagonal form should only occur when the system of eqns .",
    "( [ eq : vector ] ) , can be decoupled into completely separate subsystems . aside from this case , all elements of @xmath75 will become divergent at the same @xmath50 .",
    "this means for example , that @xmath76 should diverge at the same @xmath50 as @xmath77 .",
    "this argument shows that the divergence in moments should take place somewhere between the nth and ( n+2)th moment .",
    "it is quite reasonable to assume that the power law tail for the pdf will take on a non - integral value .",
    "note that the divergence is not dependent on the matrix @xmath78 , which is a function of @xmath79 the strength of the additive noise .",
    "therefore the exponent of the power law should also be unaffected by the strength of the additive noise .",
    "however the steady state distribution becomes ill defined in the limit of zero additive noise as we saw in section [ sec : absence ] .",
    "the power law tail should only depend on @xmath80 and @xmath3 .",
    "here the results of the previous section are used to understand and make predictions about an interesting physical system , the convection of a passive scalar field such as temperature in a random velocity flow .",
    "we will add the extra ingredient that the fluid is undergoing an irreversible chemical reaction @xmath81 .",
    "all molecules start off as type a and the reaction is exothermic . in general",
    "one expects the rate constant to be temperature dependent . over a limited temperature range",
    "this dependence can be approximated as linear .",
    "it is easily seennicolis that this reaction adds a term @xmath82 to the right hand side of eqn .",
    "( [ eq : passive ] ) .",
    "the equation under consideration is @xmath83 the last term is an additive random noise term , the correlation function in fourier space @xmath84 must go to zero as @xmath85 to ensure heat conservation in the absence of chemical reactions .",
    "it will now be argued that this system exhibits a cross - over from an exponential tail in the pdf , @xmath86 , to a power law as @xmath14 is increased .",
    "first consider the case of no reaction , @xmath87 and no additive noise . in this case",
    "we will now see that @xmath15 must asymptote to a constant @xmath88 .",
    "there are three ingredients in this argument .",
    "first the laplacian acts as a short distance cutoff precluding variation of the temperature field on a smaller scale . to estimate this length scale",
    "we are assuming that the velocity field has a small distance cutoff . in the case of turbulence",
    "this would be kolmogorov s smallest eddy scale .",
    "another scale of relevance is obtained by comparing the first two terms on the right hand side of eqn .",
    "( [ eq : alpha ] ) .",
    "this yields a scale @xmath89 . as is usual with competition between convection and diffusion , it is the latter that will dominate below and the former that will dominate above the scale @xmath90@xcite",
    ". therefore at a sufficiently small length scale the variation of @xmath18 should be smooth .",
    "second , in a closed system or one with zero net heat flux into the system , the integrated temperature is conserved .",
    "third if the the scalar field is initially positive everywhere , it must remain so under evolution of eqn .",
    "( [ eq : passive ] ) .",
    "these three observations , of _ ( a ) _ conserved heat flux , _ ( b ) _ minimum length scale , and _ ( c ) _ positivity of @xmath6 , imply that in steady state there will be a maximum that the temperature can take .",
    "this would be when the entire non - zero , or non - average , temperature field is concentrated in a spike of size the minimum length scale . because there is a maximum to @xmath6",
    ", it can not grow exponentially and therefore @xmath91 .",
    "but in fact from common experience one knows that without additive noise temperature variations will decrease in time .",
    "physically it is apparent , that after some time an isolated system should come to equilibrium at a constant temperature .",
    "the form of the decrease in r.m.s .",
    "temperature fluctuations depends on the form of the random velocity field .",
    "the decrease in fluctuations will depend , for long times , on the boundary conditions .",
    "if there is no heat flux in or out of the system , the integrated temperature is conserved . with @xmath92",
    "the process is purely diffusional , and one expects an exponential decay in fluctuations of the temperature field .",
    "the addition of a random velocity field should not change this conclusion .",
    "it should have the effect of mixing the system faster and increasing the rate of decay .",
    "if the boundary conditions are no longer insulating so that heat flows out of the system , the rate of decay should decrease further .",
    "the exact dependence is not important for the conclusions here , but only that in a finite size system and for a variety of boundary conditions , @xmath93 for @xmath94 .",
    "now consider the effect of adding a term @xmath82 to the right hand side of eqn .",
    "( [ eq : passive ] ) to make the fluid reactive as described above . by letting @xmath95 ,",
    "one eliminates the term @xmath82 from the equation .",
    "therefore the term @xmath82 modifies the the lyapunov exponents with no reaction @xmath96 to @xmath97 . because @xmath96 must be convex , sufficiently large @xmath14 must cause @xmath98 to cross zero at finite @xmath99 .",
    "if we now consider the steady state behavior of @xmath100 with additive noise we recall that because @xmath91 for @xmath101 , @xmath100 for one component models  @xcite must be an exponential or stretched exponential . for sufficiently large @xmath14",
    ", one should observe a cross over to power law behavior .",
    "the precise cross over behavior can not be predicted from this analysis , only that such a cross over must take place .",
    "the next section confirms this cross over numerically .",
    "we will illustrate and confirm some of the results presented here by means of computer simulation .",
    "consider eqn .",
    "( [ eq : passive ] ) in one dimension . in one dimension",
    "the incompressibility constraint can not be enforced and still obtain an interesting problem , so this constraint is dropped .",

    "the simplest `` order parameter '' for this system is the total standard deviation .",
    "@xmath105 this is to be distinguished from the @xmath6 s being evolved by eqn .",
    "( [ eq : vector ] ) . in this section",
    "we will denote the order parameter simply by @xmath6 .",
    "the different @xmath106 s are taken to be independent and gaussian distributed .",

    "16 lattice sites are used , and the distribution @xmath100 was computed by averaging .",

    "( [ eq : plnphi ] ) the resulting function should be independent of time , up to an overall vertical shift .",
    "the two curves have been shifted relative to each other and lie on top of each other within the error bars confirming the validity of the scaling assumed in this paper .",
    "note that the data for the longer time pdf does not extend down as far as for the shorter time . there is a problem measuring the tails of the pdf because the number of data points becomes very small .",
    "this one dimensional problem may not have an @xmath15 that is less than zero for positive @xmath99 as the positivity of @xmath43 is no longer guaranteed .",
    "we next turn to the case where additive noise is included .",
    "we shall illustrate the transition in behavior from an exponential tail in the pdf to a power law tail in the case of a reactive randomly stirred fluid . adding a term @xmath109 to the right hand of eqn .",
    "( [ eq : discrete ] ) represents a one dimensional discretized version of the reacting system described in section [ sec : reaction ] .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are still employed here but we start with the condition that the sum over all sites of @xmath43 is zero . in this case for a finite size system and @xmath101 , @xmath110 will decrease exponentially .",
    "this is seen from the fact that when the velocity field is zero , the system is diffusive and @xmath43 decreases exponentially . when velocity is added , this does not alter this result .",
    "from the previous section it was predicted that a system with sufficiently large @xmath14 should have power law tails .",

    "too small there is no discernible power law behavior .",
    "however this can not be ruled out based on the data .",
    "there is a narrow region where clear power law tails are manifest .",
    "the method just used for obtaining the pdf has the draw back of not being able to probe the tails of the distribution .",
    "equivalently , the high order moments and their @xmath15 s are difficult to obtain .",
    "it is the convergence of high order moments that presents a problem .",
    "multiplicative noise equations like eqn .",
    "( [ eq : vector ] ) have highly intermittent behavior .",
    "this is a result of the fact that different moments have different lyapunov exponents .",
    "therefore the typical behavior of a high moment will be very different from its true average .",
    "flucutations that are exponentially unlikely in time dominate the correct answer .",
    "therefore straightforward averaging is practically limited to very low @xmath99 , before the number of number of runs that are needed to obtain convergence becomes far too large .",
    "a way around this problem is to use a `` replication algorithm '' .",
    "similar methods have been used in quantum simulations for the past fifteen years  @xcite . in order for this method to work , one needs the order parameter @xmath6 to be positive definite , which it is in most situations , as in the above example . a large number of copies of the system described by eqn .",

    "the remainder of w is taken into consideration , by generating a random number between 0 and 1 and making an additional copy if the random number is smaller than the remainder . additionally , to stop the exponential explosion in the number of copies , the weights are all normalized so that the number of copies is kept almost constant .",

    "the interpretation of this is similar to nucleation theory  @xcite .",
    "the pdf for eqn . ( [ eq : vector ] ) has been analyzed for many components .",
    "it was found that pdf will exhibit power law tails when a symmetry condition holds for the random multiplicative matrix @xmath32 .    a passive scalar such as temperature in a random velocity field",
    "is predicted to have a pdf with an exponential or stretched exponential tail in agreement with earlier experimental and theoretical work  @xcite . if the fluid is reactive this is predicted to become power law when the reaction rate is sufficiently large .",
    "numerical evidence was presented supporting this prediction .",
    "the numerical work suggests that this power law behavior is most easily seen in small systems where the velocity correlation length is comparable to system size .",
    "it is interesting that the multi - component gaussian case should exhibit the same behavior as the a one component system albeit one that is no longer gaussian .",
    "an argument can be given to understand this equivalence with no additive noise .",
    "a multidimensional system has a variety of relaxation times .",
    "consider the longest of these @xmath160 .",
    "for times much longer than @xmath160 a system looks statistically identical to how it did originally except for an overall shift in scale . to make this concrete , suppose we shift the scale periodically after a time @xmath161 so that @xmath162 .",
    "the shift in scale will not be completely deterministic but will fluctuate because of the stochastic nature of the equation . for a long time",
    "@xmath163 , the overall scale factor is obtained by multiplying the @xmath164 shifts in scale together . each of these scale shifts is random and in general is expected to be non - gaussian .",
    "the nature of this non - gaussian distribution depends on the evolution of the system within a relaxation time .",
    "therefore the long time evolution of this system can still be properly modeled by a one component system as was investigated previously  @xcite      y.g .",
