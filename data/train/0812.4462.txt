    "collective excitations of charge density , so called plasma oscillations , in small low - dimensional superconducting structures have been a topic of great interest for a long time .",
    "there are two types of collective excitations in superconductors .",
    "one type is the so - called carlson - goldman mode @xcite . in this mode",
    "the superconducting current oscillations are balanced by the current of the normal electrons , and the charge densities produced by the superconducting and normal electrons are mutually compensated .",
    "this mode occurs only for temperatures that are very close to the critical temperature @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the other type of collective excitations are plasma oscillations which are similar to plasma oscillations in normal metals .",
    "unlike plasma oscillations in normal metals , those occurring in superconductors can not exist in bulk superconducting samples because the typical frequencies of plasma oscillations in the bulk ( @xmath8hz ) are far above the superconducting gap @xmath9 .",
    "however , in small systems like superconducting wires , thin films , and tubes , the dispersion relation of plasmons has a sound - like ( acoustic ) character . in what follows we will consider only acoustic type plasma excitations .",
    "we are interested in plasma oscillations that do not break the cooper pairs i.e. oscillations with frequencies @xmath10 .",
    "the existence of such ( acoustic ) plasmons in superconductors was predicted rather early by kulik  @xcite , who considered plasma excitations for two geometries : a thin infinite solid wire ( essentially one - dimensional , 1d ) and a thin infinite film ( essentially two - dimensional , 2d ) .",
    "it was found that the dispersion relation for the wire is a linear function of the wave vector @xmath2 along the wire , whereas for the infinite thin film the frequency of the plasmons is proportional to the square root of the wave vector .",
    "formally , plasmons in low dimensional superconductors with linear and square root dispersion are similar to those in normal conductors @xcite , but unlike the latter they have lower frequencies and decay rates .",
    "such `` superconducting plasmons '' were theoretically analyzed later @xcite and they were subsequently observed experimentally in superconducting films @xcite and wires @xcite .    the high sensitivity of non - simply connected superconducting systems ( cylinders and rings ) to weak magnetic fields is well known , and it is manifested by effects such as flux , or fluxoid , quantization  @xcite , and the little - parks effect ( oscillations of the critical temperature as a function of the magnetic flux with a period determined by the superconducting flux quantum @xmath4  @xcite ) . both of these effects may be considered as manifestations of the aharonov - bohm ( ab ) effect  @xcite ( see e.g. a review in  @xcite ) .",
    "consequently , it is of interest to investigate possible manifestations of the ab effect in plasma oscillations in superconductors  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we study plasma oscillations in a superconducting tube with an arbitrary radius @xmath3 and identify two dimensionality regimes ( 1d and 2d ) of the plasmon dispersion relation and the crossover between them , depending on the magnitude of @xmath11 ( see ref.@xcite ) .",
    "we demonstrate that the ab effect , pertaining to plasmons in superconducting tubes and rings , is expressed as oscillations of the plasmon frequencies as a function of the magnetic flux with a universal period of @xmath4 ( the flux quantum of a cooper pair ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we discuss the formalism used to describe plasma oscillations in superconducting tubes and calculate their dispersion relations . in sec .",
    "iii we use these results to study the behavior of plasmons in tubes and rings placed in a magnetic field .",

    "in this section we study the propagation of plasma waves in a hollow superconducting cylinder ( tube ) .",
    "let us take the symmetry axis of the cylinder as the @xmath12 axis of a cylindrical coordinate system and let @xmath13 , be the radius - vector perpendicular to the @xmath12 axis . for simplicity",
    "we assume that the width of the wall of the cylinder , @xmath14 , is much smaller than its radius @xmath3 ( fig .",

    "our discussion so far was general .",
    "to describe the superconducting regime we adopt a simple two - fluid phenomenological model  @xcite with a nonlinear superconducting term .",
    "we assume that the system is almost in a stationary state .",
    "for the description of the superconducting component we use the time - independent ginzburg - landau equation .",
    "it was shown rather early by bardeen  @xcite , that for clean metals ( close to @xmath7 ) the two fluid model can be derived directly from the bcs theory .",
    "subsequently it was also shown that the two - fluid model can also be successfully used for dirty metals  @xcite .",
    "the two - fluid model assumes that electrons are locally in thermodynamic equilibrium . in the case of low energy small amplitude long - wavelength collective excitations , like acoustic plasma waves , any gradients in the velocities or densities",
    "are sufficiently small , and the equation of motion of the superconducting electrons takes the form as for classically behaving particles .",
    "the electrons of the superconducting component of our two - fluid model move without dissipation , whereas the electrons of the normal fluid dissipate energy .",
    "the parameter that characterizes dissipation of the normal fluid @xmath36 is the average time between collisions of the normal electrons in the metal . unless this collision time is very small",
    "there is no significant difference between the normal and superconducting electrons since both contribute to the plasma oscillations .",
    "the situation is very different , however , for small collision times @xmath37 . in this case",
    "the normal carriers almost do not participate in the plasma oscillations ( see discussion in sec .",
    "iv ) .    let us assume that the thickness @xmath14 of the walls of the hollow cylinder ( tube ) is smaller than both the superconducting coherence length @xmath6 , and the london penetration depth @xmath38 , @xmath39 .",
    "these assumptions allow us to treat the amplitude of the order parameter @xmath40 in the cylinder as a constant and the current density ( in the dirty superconductor ) can be written ( from consideration of the time - independent ginzburg - landau equation ) in the form  ( see e.g. @xcite ) @xmath41 and @xmath42 is the concentration of the superconducting electrons , @xmath43 is their velocity which is a two component vector : @xmath44 is the velocity along the tube , @xmath45 is the velocity in the plane perpendicular to the axis of the tube ( @xmath46 ) , @xmath47 is the critical velocity , @xmath48 is the normal conductivity , and @xmath49 is the external electric field .",
    "@xmath50 is the `` effective concentration '' of the superconducting electrons in the film , which depends on the velocity @xmath51 .",
    "the first term in the equation for the above equation for @xmath52 describes the supercurrent , whereas the second term describes the current due to the normal electrons and it accounts for all the dissipation processes in our system .",
    "the relationship between the current and the velocity of the superconducting electrons is nonlinear ( see eq.[matter ] ) .",
    "when the amplitude of the velocity oscillations in the plasma wave is much smaller than the critical velocity @xmath47 we can linearize this relationship about the homogeneous solution @xmath53 @xmath54 where @xmath55 with @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "the uniform homogeneous background current through the tube has two components : normal and superconducting .",
    "we assume that the superconductor is very dirty and therefore the normal conductance of the tube is very small .",
    "because of the very small normal conductance the normal component of the constant background current is much smaller than the total background current and we neglect the voltage drop due to the normal current through the tube . in general however , if one takes into account the voltage due to the normal current , when considering the currents very close to the critical one , superconducting states with a uniform time - independent order parameter may become unstable toward small perturbations and the system may become normal or develop a time - dependent superconducting state ( see e.g.  @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "we assume here that we are sufficiently far from the critical current to assure that such transitions do not occur in the system under consideration .    substituting the continuity equation and the equation of motion written in the fourier representation @xmath58    into ( [ e_z ] ) and ( [ e_phi ] ) we derive the relations between the currents and the velocities of the electrons in the superconductor    @xmath59    where",

    "there are two important cases for which the dispersion relation for the plasma oscillations can be written explicitly in a simple form .",
    "these are : ( i ) the limiting case of plasma oscillations in an infinite superconducting thin wire ( 1d case ) , and ( ii ) plasma oscillations in a thin superconducting thin film ( 2d case ) .    in the first case ( i )",
