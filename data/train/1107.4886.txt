    "during the last forty years a very interesting jump from symmetry to supersymmetry has taken place , determining theoretic particle spectra in quantum field theories with extremely appealing characteristics , see e.g. @xcite . unlike many quantum field",
    "theoretical models , the supersymmetric systems are frequently amenable to non - perturbative treatments , see e.g. @xcite , but the main feature is that fermions and bosons are jointly assembled in multiplets , a fact , although suggestive , that has not yet experimentally confirmed .",
    "thus , mechanisms of spontaneous supersymmetry breaking must be investigated in the search for explanations of the apparent lack of supersymmetry in nature . in a series of papers ,",
    "witten , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , proposed the analysis of this phenomenon in the simplest possible setting : supersymmetric quantum mechanics .",
    "a new area of research in quantum mechanics was born , with far - reaching consequences both in mathematics and physics .",
    "the relation between the dirac operator in electromagnetic and/or gravitational fields - the supercharge - with the klein - gordon operator - the supersymmetric hamiltonian - provided a guide for the building of supersymmetric quantum mechanical systems .",
    "the factorization method of identifying the spectra of schrodinger operators by means of first - order differential operators , see @xcite for a review , is another antecedent of supersymmetric quantum mechanics that can also be traced back to the 19th century through the darboux transform @xcite . in its modern version ,",
    "supersymmetric quantum mechanics prompted the study of many one - dimensional systems from a physical point of view .",
    "a good deal of this work can be found in references @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "several examples of this structure with emphasis in the semi - classical behavior of non - harmonic oscillators have been worked out in @xcite .",
    "the formalism of physical supersymmetric systems with more than one bosonic / fermionic pairs of degrees of freedom was first developed by andrianov , ioffe and coworkers in a series of papers , @xcite , @xcite , published in the eighties .",
    "factorability , even though essential in n - dimensional susy quantum mechanics , is not so effective as compared with the one - dimensional situation .",
    "some degree of separability is also necessary to achieve analytical results .",
    "for this reason we started a research program in the two - dimensional supersymmetric classical mechanics of liouville systems , @xcite ; i.e. , those systems separable in elliptic , polar , parabolic , or cartesian coordinates , see papers @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we therefore follow this path in the quantum domain for type i liouville models in @xcite .    nevertheless , the authors from saint petersburg university mentioned above considered from the earlier eighties higher - than - one - dimensional susy quantum mechanics from the point of view of the factorization of n - dimensional quantum systems , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "ioffe et al .",
    "also studied the interplay between supersymmetry and integrability in quantum and classical settings in other types of model in references @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . in these papers ,",
    "a new structure was introduced @xcite : second - order ( and higher - order ) supercharges provided intertwined scalar hamiltonians even in the two - dimensional ( and higher - dimensional ) case , see the review papers @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this higher - order susy algebra allows for new forms of non - conventional separability in two dimensions .",
    "there are two possibilities : ( 1 ) a similarity transformation performs the separation of variables in the supercharges and some eigen - functions ( partial solvability ) can be found , see @xcite , @xcite .",
    "( 2 ) one of the two intertwined hamiltonian allows for exact separability : the spectrum of the other is known , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "our purpose in this paper is to describe planar supersymmetric systems - two bosonic / fermionic pairs of degrees of freedom - such that the bose - bose and fermi - fermi ( scalar ) hamiltonians will be separable . in reference",
    "@xcite eisenhart classified all the quantum systems with separable sch@xmath0dinger equations in cartesian , polar , parabolic , and elliptic coordinates",
    ". we shall address two planar supersymmetric separable systems , one in polar , the other in elliptic coordinates .",
    "we shall first consider the planar supersymmetric kepler / coulomb problem showing the separability in polar coordinates .",
    "we strongly rely on the work by wipf et al in papers @xcite , @xcite where they solve this problem in any dimension d by finding a supersymmetric matrix runge - lenz vector and describing algebraically the spectral problem in terms of the irreducible representations of @xmath1 .",
    "instead we shall attack the spectral problem in the bose - bose sector , finding the bound state energies in terms of the casimir eigenvalues of the irreducible representations of @xmath2 , whereas the eigenfunctions are generalized laguerre polynomials .",
    "the scattering eigenfunctions in this sector , as well as in the fermi - fermi sector , are generic confluent hypergeometric functions given in terms of infinite series . by acting with the supercharges ,",
    "we provide in turn both the bound state and scattering eigenfunctions in the fermi - bose sector .",
    "we remark that , following a previous work on the supersymmetric classical kepler / coulomb problem , @xcite , heumann chose another superpotential @xcite leading to a supersymmetric quantum mechanical system where the runge - lenz vector is no longer an invariant even in the bose - bose and fermi - fermi sectors .    in the second half of the paper we study a supersymmetric quantum mechanical system built from the classical euler problem : a light particle moving in the gravitational field created by two fixed newtonian centers of force restricted to the plane of the centers @xcite .",
    "besides euler , this system attracted the interest of investigators of stature such as lagrange , jacobi , liouville , darboux and others , see @xcite to read a brief history of the subject , on a double front : 1 ) because of the potential applications in celestial mechanics , e.g. , as an intermediate step in the three - body problem .",
    "2 ) because the euler problem was a playground where the ideas of integrability , curvilinear coordinates , hamilton - jacobi separability , of such importance in classical dynamics , were tested .",
    "all this was imported by pauli @xcite to the quantum domain in his research on the spectrum of the @xmath3 hydrogen ion molecule .",
    "a chapter of pauling and wilson s book on quantum mechanics @xcite is devoted to the developments in this quantum problem up to the mid thirties of the past century .",
    "we shall address a supersymmetric quantum mechanical system such that the scalar hamiltonians in the bose - bose and fermi - fermi sectors are related to the quantum mechanical euler / pauli hamiltonian .",
    "we are guided by the separability of the schr@xmath4dinger equation in elliptic coordinates : half the sum and half the difference of the distance to the centers .",
    "this is the main property of the euler - pauli hamiltonian allowing for its integrability .",
    "we choose our scalar hamiltonians fulfilling this property but supersymmetry requires the energy to be non - negative .",
    "we are forced to add a classical \" piece to the ep potential energy that pushes the ground state energy to zero .",
    "all this is achieved by the choice of a superpotential inspired in the ioffe / wipf et al superpotential for the supersymmetric kepler / coulomb problem ( our superpotential tends to the abi / klpw superpotential when the two centers collapse ) . in reference",
    "@xcite , however , we explored other possibilities in comparison with this superpotential .    a double change of variables to one - half of @xmath5 and @xmath6 of the elliptic variables transforms the separated spectral problem into systems of entangled razavy @xcite and whittaker - hill @xcite ( three - term hill , razavy trigonometric ) equations .",
    "the two equations in each system are in principle independent , but they are entangled because their parameters are determined from the integration constants -the energy and the separation constant- that allow one to formulate the hamiltonian spectral problem in terms of two separated ode s . to the best of our knowledge , this change of variables was formulated for the first time in @xcite .",
    "we shall profit from the fact that for certain values of the parameters either the razavy or the whittaker - hill equation are algebraic quasi - exactly solvable systems . more specifically ,",
    "the bound states of our system arise from values of the energy and the separation constant that lead to razavy equations belonging to this class of algebraic qes potentials , see @xcite .",
    "the algebraic qes potentials have corresponding quantum hamiltonians that are elements of the enveloping algebra of a finite dimensional lie algebra ( @xmath7 in many cases ) , admitting an invariant finite module of smooth functions as irreducible representations @xcite .",
    "these potentials were first studied by turbiner @xcite and then completely classified by gonzalez - lopez , kamran , and olver @xcite-@xcite . the associated ( weakly ) orthogonal polynomials",
    "were analyzed in full generality in @xcite and all this machinery was applied to study the razavy trigonometric potential in @xcite .",
    "unlike in the non supersymmetric case , see @xcite-@xcite , the whittaker - hill equations unfortunately are not qes for the values of the parameters for which the razavy equations are qes in the supersymmetric case .",
    "thus , we can only give the solutions in the form of infinite series following the theory of hill equations , see e.g. @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the case of two centers of the same strength is exceptional : instead of whittaker - hill equations we encounter mathieu equations .",
    "the solutions can be given analytically in terms of mathieu cosine and sine functions @xcite and it can be explicitly checked that at the limit where the two centers collapse the one - center wave functions are recovered .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows : after this long introduction in the second section  .2",
    "we settle down to the framework of @xmath8 supersymmetric quantum mechanics for systems of two degrees of freedom . because each degree of freedom can be labeled either as bosonic or fermionic , we have @xmath9 types of state .",
    "the clifford algebra of @xmath10 describes this situation perfectly and helps us to define the supercharges , the hamiltonian structure , and the hilbert space of states .",
    "section  .3 is fully devoted to discussing the planar supersymmetric kepler / coulomb problem .",
    "the bose - bose bound state eigenfunctions arise as irreducible representations of the dynamical @xmath11 symmetry associated with the runge - lenz vector whereas bose - fermi strictly positive bound states are obtained via the action of the @xmath12 operator on the bb bound states ( except the zero mode ) .",
    "the scattering states are also describe to unveil the whole spectrum of the supersymmetric kepler / coulomb problem . a direct analysis of the spectrum of the @xmath13 matrix hamiltonian and symmetry operators is also included . in section ",
    ".4 we address the same program in the supersymmetric modified euler / pauli two - center system .",
    "the bound state wave functions come from polynomial @xmath14 exponential solutions of ( infinite ) razavy equations multiplied by power series solutions of related whittaker - hill equations . in the case of two centers of the same strength ,",
    "the wh equations are replaced by mathieu equations . in section  .5",
    "we show how the kepler / coulomb spectrum reappears at the @xmath15 limit of the two centers .",
    "finally , we offer a final section with further comments on interesting generalizations of these classically integrable models .",
    "in this type of quantum mechanical systems there are two pairs of canonically conjugated bosonic operators - giving the position and momentum of the particle - that we choose in coordinate representation : @xmath16=i\\hbar\\delta_{kj } \\quad .\\ ] ] there are also two pairs of fermionic operators -of physical dimensions : @xmath17=m^{-\\frac{1}{2}}$ ] - taking care of the fermionic degrees of freedom of the system . the fermi operators satisfy anti - commutation relations of the form : @xmath18 showing that one operator is canonically conjugated to its adjoint operator .",
    "the fermionic fock space is built from the vacuum state : @xmath19 , the two degrees of freedom being in bosonic states because @xmath20 is an eigenstate of zero eigenvalue of the fermi number operator @xmath21 : @xmath22 .",

    "are then obtained in a dual way related by fermi statistics : @xmath26 .",

    "the supersymmetric wave functions read :    @xmath33    the standard procedure for introducing supersymmetric dynamics in this setup runs as follows : one first defines the supercharges$ ] we shall denote the physical dimensions of the observable @xmath34 .",

    "it is also shown in reference @xcite that it is equivalent to another supersymmetric system with two real supercharges : this is the reason for the @xmath8 in the title .      in order to skip abstract ket / bra dirac algebra",
    "we represent the fermi operators by means of the generators of the clifford algebra of @xmath10 : @xmath47 one can check that this is a minimal realization of the fermionic anticommutation rules ( [ ferr ] ) and the fermionic fock space becomes the space of four - component euclidean spinors with basis : latexmath:[\\[|0\\rangle \\ , \\ , \\rightarrow \\ , \\ , \\left(\\begin{array}{c } 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0\\end{array}\\right)\\ , \\ , \\ , , \\ , \\ , \\ ,     the supercharges are @xmath13-matrices of differential operators @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",

    "a fermionic zero mode in the one center problem , however , does not exist @xcite , @xcite .",
    "this is very intriguing and compels us to study susy quantum mechanics in curvilinear coordinates in a more profound way .",
    "the way forward to and backward from the curvilinear to cartesian coordinates of all these structures is highly non - trivial , see @xcite for early attempts in this program .",
    "we think that the difficulties with the zero modes have a similar origin to the subtleties arising in the definition of spinors on curved manifolds .",
    "we plan to analyze this issue in a future publication .",
    "all of us warmly acknowledge mikhail ioffe for lectures , seminars , talks , and conversations on supersymmetric quantum mechanics over recent years . his mastery of supersymmetric qm has greatly helped us in the struggle to improve our understanding of a matter with so many facets .",
    "jmg is also indebted to andreas wipf for patiently hearing from him about the two centers problem and for the crucial suggestion of studying the euler problem in close comparison with the kepler problem . besides being a very fruitful idea",
    ", it showed us how to shape the structure of the paper .",
    "we also thank primitivo acosta - humanez , david blazquez , mayerling nu@xmath200ez - portela and mikhail plyuschay for giving us the opportunity to present this material at the jairo charris seminar 2010 _ algebraic aspects of darboux transformations , quantum integrable systems , and supersymmetric quantum mechanics _ , santa marta , colombia , 4 - 7 august 2010 .",
