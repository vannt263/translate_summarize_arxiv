    "strong gravitational lensing is a powerful tool to map the matter distribution around galaxies on small scales . in particular , it is possible to infer the total mass enclosed within the einstein radius , allowing us to separate the dark and baryonic mass distribution of massive galaxies and constrain the stellar initial mass function ( imf ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , these measurements are complicated by various model degeneracies",
    ". lenses with multiple sources at distinct redshifts offer a unique opportunity to break these degeneracies , leading to accurate measurements of the dark matter distribution and imf ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , such double source plane ( dsp ) lens systems can be a useful , complementary cosmological probe ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , provided the mass - sheet degeneracy is broken ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",

    "only a handful are currently known ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and spectroscopic redshifts of the second sources have not been measured for these systems due to their faintness .",
    "ongoing / upcoming wide - area imaging surveys are expected to increase the number of such rare but fruitful systems . here",
    ", we report the discovery of a dsp lens system from the hyper suprime - cam subaru strategic program ( hereafter the hsc survey ) .",
    "the hsc survey is the largest observing program ever approved at the subaru 8.2-m telescope ( 300 nights ) . with a 3-layered survey strategy over @xmath71400 deg@xmath8 , it aims to address several outstanding astrophysical questions such as the nature of dark energy , galaxy evolution , and cosmic reionization .",
    "the survey is @xmath9 complete as of this writing .",
    "while the survey is still in an early phase , the exquisite data quality has led to the exciting discovery of this dsp lens .",
    "the system , hsc j142449@xmath0005322 , was serendipitously discovered at a science school for undergraduate students hosted at the national astronomical observatory of japan in 2015 .",
    "while visually inspecting galaxy cluster candidates , we found a likely cluster member with a clear sign of gravitational lensing .",
    "a more careful inspection revealed the multi - source nature of the system .",

    "a multicolor image of _ eye of horus _  constructed from hsc imaging data is shown in figure  [ fig : color_picture ] .",
    "the two sources with distinct colors are clearly seen around the lens : a red inner source ( s1 ) and a blue einstein ring ( s2 ) .",
    "these arcs are approximately 3  in radius .",
    "several knots with similar colors are embedded in the arcs , which are useful features to constrain our lens models ( section  [ sec : lensmod ] ) .",
    "_ eye of horus _  is located in the wide layer of the hsc survey , which aims to cover @xmath71400 deg@xmath8 down to @xmath15 .",

    "* ) on the 6.5-m magellan i baade telescope .",
    "fire covers the wavelength range @xmath16 m at a spectral resolution of @xmath17 .",
    "the observations were taken on the nights of ut 2016 february 1516 .",
    "conditions were clear , and the seeing varied from @xmath18 . a slit width of 1  was used to image the primary features of s1 and s2 across six separate pointings with exposure times ranging from @xmath19 minutes .",
    "the data are reduced using a combination of the firehose pipeline and custom idl scripts .",
    "we successfully determine the redshifts of most of the main features of both sources indicated in figure  [ fig : color_picture ] , making this the first dsp lens with spectroscopic confirmation of both source redshifts .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : spectra ] , we measure the redshift of the outer source to be @xmath3 based on multiple detections of the , h@xmath20 , and h@xmath21 lines .",
    "interestingly , s2 has two components that are slightly offset by @xmath22 in redshift space .",
    "however , they are likely physically associated given the small difference .    the inner source is confirmed at @xmath4 with weaker detections of the and h@xmath21 lines .",
    "in addition to our fire spectra , the spectrum from sdss also confirms the redshift of s1  feature h is included within the sdss fiber targetting the lens galaxy and we observe clear emission from h once the continuum is subtracted .",
    "s1 also seems to have two components as indicated by the small redshift offset of @xmath22 between h and the southern segment of the arc ( s1a - s ) as well as a very marginal hint of the western segment ( s1a - w ) being at a redshift consistent with h , suggesting that s1a - w is the counterimage of h. further follow - up observations will reveal the detailed dynamics of each source .",
    "the lens galaxy is a passive galaxy with no clear signs of active star formation based on the sdss spectrum .",
    "preliminary results of the camira algorithm @xcite applied to the hsc survey data suggest that there is a rich cluster of galaxies at @xmath23 at the location of the lens .",
    "the richness of @xmath24 implies a cluster mass of @xmath25 .",
    "given the lens galaxy s large stellar mass ( estimated below ) and proximity to the cluster center , it is potentially the brightest cluster galaxy . a more detailed analysis of the lens environment based on multi - object spectroscopy from the inamori magellan aerial camera and spectrograph ( imacs ; * ?",
    "* ) will be presented in a follow - up work ( wong et al . in preparation ) .    despite the superb seeing ,",
    "the lens and the surrounding arcs are still blended in the hsc imaging . in order to study the lens and perform detailed analyses of the background sources , we fit the lens with a double srsic model and",
    "subtract it from the images using glee @xcite .",
    "we first fit the lens in the @xmath26-band , in which the lens is detected at a high s / n of @xmath27 within a @xmath28 aperture and the seeing is good ( @xmath29 ; see table  [ tab : phot ] ) .",
    "the psf is modeled in each exposure and is evaluated at the position of the lens by coadding the psf models .",
    "we then fit the lens in the other bands with the structural parameters such as centroid , effective radius , ellipticity , and position angle fixed to those measured in the @xmath26-band .",
    "only the flux normalization is allowed to vary . the psf model in each band",
    "is evaluated in the same way as the @xmath26-band .",
    "the multicolor lens - subtracted image is shown in the left panel of figure  [ fig : lenssub ] .",
    "an arc - like feature ( h ) on the left of the lens emerges .",
    "the images show no subtraction residuals at the location of the lens , demonstrating our accurate modeling of psf and the lens galaxy light .    using the 5-band photomtetry and the known redshift of the lens galaxy",
    ", we fit its spectral energy distribution ( sed ) using mizuki @xcite . due to the strong blending",
    ", we use the double srsic fit to the lens to estimate the flux in each band .",
    "the fit has a very extended envelope out to large radii , but we truncate the model at a radius of @xmath30 ( @xmath31 kpc at the lens redshift ) , which is the radius of the s2 arc .",
    "this is a somewhat arbitrary choice , but it should include most of the lens light and also represent the enclosed stellar mass while keeping the flux from the ( uncertain ) envelope relatively small .",
    "the sed is then fit with a suite of model templates generated by @xcite models assuming a @xcite imf and @xcite dust attenuation curve .",
    "we apply bayesian priors on the physical properties of galaxies to keep the model parameters within realistic ranges and to effectively let the templates evolve with redshift in an observationally motivated way ( for more details , see * ? ? ?",
    "we find that the lens galaxy is very massive  it has a stellar mass of @xmath32 , making it among the most massive galaxies around this redshift @xcite .",
    "the star formation rate from the fit is very small for its stellar mass ( sfr @xmath33 ) , as is the dust attenuation ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "together with the early - type morphology , the lens may be the brightest cluster galaxy .",
    "note that the given uncertainties are just statistical uncertainties and do not account for systematic effects .",
    "we model the system based on the data in hand using two independent codes : glee @xcite and glafic @xcite .",
    "the system is complex , and our goal is to reproduce the main features of the image configuration of both sources to obtain a basic understanding of the system .",
    "more detailed lens models will be presented in a future paper ( wong et al . in preparation ) .",
    "we first model _ eye of horus _  with glee using pixelated grids with curvature regularization for the extended sources @xcite .",
    "lensing mass distributions are described by parameterized profiles .",
    "model parameters of the lens and source are constrained through markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) sampling .",
    "we use the full multiplane lens equation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to calculate deflection angles since there are multiple lens and source planes involved ( suyu et al . in preparation ) .",
    "our modeling strategy is to first use only s1 to constrain the parameters of the main lens galaxy ( l ) , then to model l and s1 simultaneously with the light from s2 as constraints .",
    "we separate s1 and s2 by subtracting the hsc images in two filters ( after matching the seeing ) weighted such that the light from either s1 or s2 is removed and leaving only light from the other .",
    "we find that using the @xmath26 and @xmath35 bands give the cleanest separation , as these filters straddle the 4000   break of s1 and probe the uv continuum of s2 . the lens galaxy l is parameterized as a singular power - law elliptical mass distribution @xcite .",
    "we fix the centroid to the galaxy light centroid and adopt flat priors on the ellipticity , orientation , and mass profile slope . we do not include external shear , as it does not drastically improve the fit .",
    "for the second part of our modeling , s1 is parameterized as a singular isothermal ellipsoid ( sie ) with flat priors on its ellipticity and orientation .",
    "the centroid of s1 is given a flat prior , but we link the centroid to the weighted source position of the brightest pixels in h and s1a . the likelihood determined from the offset between these pixels and the predicted image positions of the s1 centroid ( assuming one hsc - pixel positional uncertainty of @xmath36 ) are factored into the total likelihood .",
    "we then simultaneously vary the parameters of the lens and s1 using the light distribution of s2 as constraints .",
    "using a pixelated source alone is unable to remove point - like residuals at the positions of the bright clumps in s2 , so we also fit point sources convolved with the psf at each of these seven locations ( a  g in figure  [ fig : color_picture ] ) , allowing their position and amplitude to vary .",
    "we also include a satellite galaxy ( l1 ) parameterized as a singular isothermal sphere ( sis ) at the main lens redshift between features a and c , as a smooth model is unable to account for these features .",
    "l1 is given a flat prior on its position and einstein radius .",
    "glafic uses parameterized models for the extended light profile of the lensed source , contrary to glee .",
    "while the current public version of glafic supports a single lens plane only , we recently implemented the ability to calculate the deflection angles over two lens planes using the standard multiplane lens equation formalism , which is essential for modeling of this system .    in principle",
    ", glafic can fit the light and mass profile of the lens galaxies simultaneously .",
    "however , for simplicity , we model the light profile of the main lens galaxy ( l ) first with a srsic profile and subtract it from the @xmath26-band image . while holding the lens position fixed from the srsic model , we choose an elliptical power - law to model the lens potential .",
    "we adopt the following strategy for modeling each lensed source .",
    "a single srsic model is used to describe the light profile of s1 .",
    "the lens model includes an elliptical power - law for galaxy l and an sis for the dark satellite l1 , assumed to be at the same redshift as l. for s2 , we need two - component srsic models to fit the compact ( knots a , b , c , d and e ) and extended ( blue ring ) features .",
    "we also need another srsic component to model the knots g+f , which correspond to a distinct source ( see figure  [ fig : spectra ] ) . for s2",
    ", the mass model is same as before ( l+l1 ) , except now there is a secondary lens plane to account for the mass of s1 , which is modeled as an sie .",
    "the center of the light profile of source s1 is the same as the associated mass component .",
    "both sources are modeled simultaneously but the likelihood of the lens model for s1 is calculated by masking out everything else in the image except h and s1a .",
    "similarly , the likelihood of the lens model for s2 is calculated by masking out everything except the blue features .",
    "the final likelihood is a product of the two likelihoods .",
    "we use glafic for solving the lens equations while the sampling of the posterior distribution of the model parameters is done via the python module _ emcee _ @xcite .",
    "the reconstructed image configurations are shown in the middle and right panels of figure  [ fig : lenssub ] .",
    "we find that both glee and glafic successfully reproduce the main features of the system .",
    "both methods prefer a shallow mass profile ( @xmath37 , where @xmath38 ) for l , suggesting that there is a large dark matter fraction , possibly due to the cluster environment .",
    "both models also require an additional mass component between images a and c to split this feature into two images .",
    "we have assumed that this mass component , which is undetected in the hsc imaging and fire spectroscopy , is at the same redshift as the lens galaxy , although it could potentially be a line - of - sight structure as well .",
    "the image splitting is unlikely to be due to s1 as the positions are not coincident .",
    "the velocity dispersion of l1 , assuming an sis profile , is @xmath39 km s@xmath40 , although the uncertainties are large and there are likely degeneracies with the centroid position relative to features a and c. deeper and higher - resolution imaging is needed to potentially detect l1 .",
    "both models find that s1 has a velocity dispersion of @xmath41 km s@xmath40 ( assuming an sie profile ) with moderate to high ellipticity .",
    "the glee model maps feature h to s1a - w , while s1a - s maps to a segment of h just above the lens galaxy , resulting in a source that either consists of two components or is highly elongated ( e.g. an edge - on disk ) .",
    "the slight velocity offset of h and s1a - w with s1a - s indicated by the fire data supports this interpretation .",
    "unfortunately , the upper segment of h was not targeted in our fire observations .",
    "there are likely degeneracies among the physical properties of l and s1 .",
    "more detailed mass models using improved data will explore these degeneracies and more accurately determine the model parameters .    by extrapolating the results from cfhtls ( i.e. ,",
    "one confirmed dsp lens from * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we expect to discover @xmath42 dsp lenses in the hsc survey , of which _ eye of horus _",
    "is the first .",
    "our initial results highlight the potential wealth of information provided by dsp lenses , as well as the challenges of dsp lens modeling and the importance of high - quality data and multiple lens model analyses to understand all of the degeneracies and systematic effects .",
    "the spectroscopic confirmation of both sources and the presence of the potential substructure causing the image splitting of features a and c make _ eye of horus _  a valuable system for studies of cosmology and galaxy structure .",
