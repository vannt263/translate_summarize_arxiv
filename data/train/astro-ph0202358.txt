    "in cosmological models dominated by cold dark matter ( cdm ) and an unclustered energy component ( such as a cosmological constant ) , gravitational instability of primordial density fluctuations produces a population of dark matter halos , each in approximate virial equilibrium . depending on their mass",
    ", these halos may host individual galaxies , galaxy groups , or rich galaxy clusters .",
    "provided that one focuses on systems of overdensity @xmath18 , and regards higher density structures as subsystems within their parent halos , the halo population itself is insensitive to the gas pressure forces that influence the sub - dominant baryon component . in this paper",
    ", we investigate whether changes to cosmological parameters  specifically the matter density parameter @xmath0 and parameters that describe the shape and amplitude of the primordial power spectrum  always produce measurable changes in the dark halo population , or whether two models with different combinations of these parameters can give rise to halo populations that are effectively indistinguishable .",
    "our interest in this question is spurred by recent developments in the theory of biased galaxy formation .",
    "the uncertain relation between galaxies and dark matter is the primary limitation in testing cosmological models against observations of galaxy clustering .",
    "the `` halo occupation distribution '' ( hod ) characterizes this relation statistically in terms of the probability distribution @xmath19 that a halo of virial mass @xmath12 contains @xmath20 galaxies of a specified type , together with prescriptions that specify the relative spatial and velocity distributions of galaxies and dark matter within these halos .",
    "numerous recent papers have shown that the hod framework is a powerful tool for analytic and numerical calculations of clustering statistics , for modeling observed clustering , and for characterizing the results of semi - analytic or numerical studies of galaxy formation ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite have argued that the hod can be determined empirically from observed galaxy clustering , given an assumed cosmological model that determines the mass function and spatial and velocity clustering of the dark halo population .",
    "empirical determinations of the hod can provide insight into the physics of galaxy formation , and they may sharpen the ability of large scale structure studies to test cosmological models , since a model with an incorrect dark halo population may be unable to match the data for any choice of hod ( see @xcite for further discussion ) .",
    "suppose that we find a combination of cosmology and hod that reproduces all aspects of observed galaxy clustering .",
    "can we infer that the cosmology and the derived hod are both correct ?",
    "if there is another cosmological model that predicts an indistinguishable halo population , then the answer is clearly no , since the combination of this alternative cosmology with the same hod would predict identical galaxy clustering .",
    "these cosmological models would be degenerate in the sense that they could not be distinguished by galaxy clustering data without relying on a predictive theory of galaxy formation ( which might yield different hods for the two cosmologies ) .",
    "cosmological models that predict distinguishable halo populations could still be degenerate in this sense , if changes to the hod can mask the differences in the halo populations ; we will speculate on this point in  4 , but we reserve a quantitative examination of it to future work .",
    "we focus our analyses on cdm cosmological models with gaussian initial density fluctuation fields . motivated by cosmic microwave background measurements @xcite ,",
    "we restrict our attention to spatially flat models with a cosmological constant or @xmath21 , though we demonstrate in passing that galaxy clustering data at @xmath22 probably can not distinguish a flat model from an open model with the same @xmath0 . the parameters that define our cosmological models",
    "are : the matter density parameter @xmath0 ; the normalization @xmath9 of the power spectrum @xmath1 , which is the r.m.s .",
    "fluctuation of the linear density field filtered with a top - hat filter of radius 8 ; and the shape of @xmath1 , which we characterize by the spectral index @xmath14 of the inflationary power spectrum and the shape parameter @xmath15 of the matter transfer function ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "although existing data impose constraints on these parameters , individually or in combination , here we allow each to vary independently over a fairly broad range , so that we can isolate the physical effects of the matter density , the amplitude of mass fluctuations , and the shape of the power spectrum on the resulting halo population .",
    "we concentrate entirely on the halo populations at @xmath22 , since this is where galaxy clustering data will be good enough to allow empirical hod determinations in the near future .",
    "using @xmath20-body simulations described in ",
    "[ sec : sims ] , we measure ( in  [ sec : results ] ) mass functions , two - point correlation functions , mean pairwise radial velocities , and pairwise velocity dispersions of dark matter halos .",
    "first , we consider models that have the same initial power spectrum @xmath1 but different matter density parameter @xmath0 .",
    "we then move to cluster normalized models in which @xmath9 is changed to compensate the change in @xmath0 , so that the amplitude of the halo mass function is kept approximately fixed at a cluster scale . finally , we investigate models in which both the amplitude and the shape of @xmath1 are changed in order to match the amplitude and slope of the halo mass function at the cluster scale .",
    "we review our results and briefly discuss their implications for cosmological tests in  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "our results overlap previous numerical studies of the halo mass function and halo clustering ( recent examples include @xcite ) , but they differ in the examination of controlled parameter sequences rather than specific cosmological models .",
    "also , while some of these studies have focused on the large scale correlations of cluster mass halos , we devote considerable attention to the lower masses and smaller spatial scales that are important for non - linear galaxy clustering . throughout the paper , we adopt a hubble constant @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "in this work , statistics are mainly based on simulations run with a particle - mesh ( pm ) @xmath20-body code @xcite .",
    "we run pm simulations with different combinations of density and power spectrum parameters .",
    "each simulation follows the evolution of 200@xmath24 particles in a periodic cube 200on a side , with a 400@xmath24 mesh to compute the gravitational force starting at @xmath25 and advancing to @xmath22 in 40 equal steps of expansion factor @xmath26 .",
    "the mass of each particle is @xmath27 .",
    "we adopt the parameterization of @xcite for the fluctuation power spectrum @xmath1 .",
    "we divide our simulations into three categories corresponding to parameter changes in the matter density and the normalization and the shape of the initial fluctuation power spectrum . for each category ,",
    "four cosmological models are investigated with @xmath28(0.2,0.8 ) , ( 0.3,0.7 ) , ( 0.4,0.6 ) and ( 1.0,0.0 ) .",
    "we generally regard the ( 0.3,0.7 ) model as the central one for comparison . in the central model ,",
    "the spectral index is @xmath29 , the spectral shape parameter is @xmath30 , and the r.m.s .",
    "mass fluctuation within spheres of radius 8is @xmath31 , which is consistent with the observed abundance of clusters @xcite . for each model , we generate four independent realizations , and we use the dispersion among these realizations to estimate the statistical error bars on our clustering measures associated with the finite simulation volume .",
    "the total volume is comparable to that expected for the sloan digital sky survey @xcite out to its median redshift @xmath32 .",
    "we use a fof algorithm @xcite to identify the dark matter halos , and , unless explicitly stated otherwise , the linking length is 0.2 times the mean inter - particle separation . with this linking length",
    ", the fof algorithm picks out structures of typical mass overdensity @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "the advantage of a pm code is that it is relatively cheap to run multiple simulations with a large dynamic range in mass .",
    "the limitation of a pm code is its moderate force resolution , but this limitation is not too serious for our purposes , since we only identify halos and do not attempt to measure their internal structure .",
    "we perform two tests to make sure that the pm resolution is adequate for our purpose .",
    "first , we make a comparison between pm simulations and simulations run with the gadget tree code @xcite .",
    "second , we perform a self - similar scaling test for the pm code .",
    "gadget is a publicly available @xmath20-body code that calculates particle accelerations by the hierarchical tree method of @xcite .",
    "its advantages over the pm algorithm are its spatial and temporal adaptability . the gravitational softening length , @xmath34 , can be set significantly smaller than the initial particle grid spacing to increase force resolution , though if @xmath34 is too small 2-body relaxation effects will begin to influence the halo population .",
    "particles have individual timesteps , which can vary continuously to ensure accurate time integration given the adopted force resolution .",
    "gadget has fully periodic boundary conditions for comoving integrations via the ewald summation method @xcite .",
    "we have compared the results of two simulations with 100@xmath24 particles in a 100box , one evolved with the pm code using a 200@xmath24 mesh ( thus having equal resolution to the larger simulations on which our results will be based ) , and one evolved with gadget using @xmath35mpc .",
    "the initial conditions of the two simulations were identical to each other and used the parameters of the central model described above .",
    "slices through these simulations are plotted for comparison in figure  [ fig : pgslice ] .",
    "the structures formed in the two simulations are very similar at the level of detail discernible in this plot",
    ". the halo mass functions of the two simulations , also shown in figure  [ fig : pgslice ] , trace each other nearly exactly .",
    "the pm simulation produces slightly ( @xmath36 ) fewer halos below @xmath37 , which is to be expected given its lower force resolution ; the diameter of an overdensity 200 sphere of @xmath37 is 1.04@xmath38 , or about two pm grid cells .",
    "when the mesh size on this pm simulation was increased to 300@xmath24 , the resulting mass function was consistent with the gadget simulation even on these small mass scales .",
    "in addition to the halo mass function , the quantities important to our analysis are the correlation functions for both the mass distributions and the halo populations , which are shown in figure  [ fig : pgxicmp ] . as with the halo mass functions , the matter correlation functions for the pm and gadget simulations match very well .",
    "they begin to deviate at separations smaller than @xmath39mpc , or under one mesh cell .",
    "the halo correlation functions produced by the two methods are also consistent .",
    "larger simulations and multiple realizations of each model are efficiently produced with the pm code , which takes up to an order of magnitude less computing time at the force resolution adopted here .",
    "we next perform a self - similar scaling test for the pm code . assuming an einstein - de sitter universe ( @xmath21 )",
    ", we use a pure power - law power spectrum @xmath40 with @xmath41 ( and no transfer function modulation ) for the initial density fluctuations of the scale - free model .",
    "a 400@xmath24 force mesh is used to follow the gravitational evolution of 200@xmath24 particles .",
    "the normalization of the power spectrum is set so that the nonlinear mass @xmath6 at the final output corresponds to 400 particles .",

    "earlier outputs can be identified with higher redshifts or with larger volumes at @xmath22 . in the language of the redshift description",
    ", the simulation is evolved for 40 time steps from @xmath25 , with 4 outputs ( at redshifts @xmath451.00 , 0.60 , 0.25 , and 0.00 ) , when the corresponding @xmath6 values are 50 , 100 , 200 , and 400 particles , respectively .",
    "the following results are averaged over four independent realizations of the simulation , and the error bars represent the dispersion among the four realizations divided by @xmath46 to yield the error on the mean .",
    "@xcite performed the first study on scale - free cosmological models using @xmath20-body simulations and showed that many quantities in scale - free models have well - defined scaling behaviors . in an einstein - de sitter scale - free model , the cumulative halo mass functions at redshifts @xmath47 and @xmath48 have the scaling behavior @xmath49 the left panel of figure  [ fig : scalemf ] shows the cumulative halo mass function at different redshifts in our scale - free simulations ( solid curves ) .",
    "the dotted curves in figure  [ fig : scalemf ] are derived by scaling the mass function at @xmath22 according to the above scaling rule .",
    "the scaling properties shown in the figure are generally very good .",
    "the high mass end of the mass function drops systematically below the self - similar scaling as @xmath6 increases , a likely result of the finite simulation volume , which supresses the amplitude of fluctuations on the largest scales .",
    "comparison of the first and last outputs suggests that this effect becomes noticeable above @xmath50 at @xmath22 ( for our adopted @xmath51 scaling ) , or a mass scale @xmath52 0.1% of the total simulation mass ( 10% in length scale ) .",
    "the @xmath20-point correlation functions @xmath3 are expected to have a similarity transformation with the variable @xmath53 for an einstein - de sitter universe @xcite .",
    "the scaling rule for the correlation functions at redshifts @xmath47 and @xmath48 is then @xmath54 from figure  [ fig : scalemf ] and figure  [ fig : scalexi ] , it is clear that mass correlation functions and halo correlation functions at different values of @xmath7 obey the scaling rule quite well .",
    "there are some noticeable departures from self - similar scaling in the @xmath55 panel at the two earliest output times ( especially the earliest ) , when @xmath55 corresponds to 25 and 50 particles , respectively .",
    "the clustering of halos is biased relative to that of the matter .",
    "the halo bias factor @xmath56 can be defined via @xmath57 , where @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the two - point correlation functions of halos and matter , respectively .",
    "the relation between the clustering of halos and that of the matter has been extensively studied based on analytical models and numerical simulations ( e.g. , @xcite ; and references therein ) . @xcite give an analytic formula for the bias factor of halos of a given mass based on an extended press - schechter analysis @xcite .",
    "this formula is quite accurate for halos with @xmath60 . @xcite",
    "empirically modifies the formula to also fit the @xmath20-body simulation results for halos of lower mass , @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the r.m.s .",
    "fluctuation of the mass density at a mass scale @xmath12 , @xmath63 is the threshold density contrast for collapse of a homogeneous spherical overdense region at redshift @xmath64 , and @xmath65 for an einstein - de sitter universe . for @xmath41 here , @xmath66 .",
    "we derive the square of the bias factor numerically as a function of @xmath7 at different redshifts by averaging @xmath67 over comoving separations between 5and 30 . in this range , the ratio is almost constant .",
    "we compare the computed bias factor with that given by jing s fitting formula in figure  [ fig : scalebias ] .",
    "two conclusions can be drawn immediately from the comparison .",
    "first , since bias factors at different redshifts overlap with each other when plotted as a function of @xmath7 , the simulation displays the correct scaling behavior .",
    "second , the bias factors agree well with jing s fitting formula . at higher mass ,",
    "the computed bias is somewhat lower than that given by jing s formula .",
    "in fact , the same trend can be found in jing s plot ( see his figure  2 ) .",
    "we attribute this slight deviation in part to a sample volume effect and in part to systematic errors in the approximate analytic formula given by @xcite ( see @xcite ) . both the gadget simulation test and the scale - free model test assure that the numerical artifacts in the pm simulations have almost negligible effect on the statistics we care about in this paper .",
    "for example , the mass scales that we are concerned with are generally higher than the level where the pm and gadget halo mass functions begin to deviate slightly .",
    "moreover , the correlation functions are measured at scales @xmath68 0.5 mesh cells , where the pm and gadget results are consistent .",
    "the pm simulations reproduce the expected scaling behaviors in the scale - free model , which also demonstrates that we can measure masses of halos and their spatial distribution correctly based on these simulations .",
    "the scaling tests and code comparison suggest that there are some inaccuracies when the halo mass is lower than 50 particles or more than 0.1% of the total mass in the simulation , but even in these regimes there should be little impact on our conclusions because we compare different cosmologies evolved with the same code and numerical parameters .",
    "the pm code is therefore an ideal tool for our purpose in this paper .",
    "we start with a simple case in which we fix the power spectrum ( as linearly evolved to @xmath22 , with @xmath29 , @xmath31 , @xmath30 ) and change @xmath0 . in linear theory , the evolved fluctuations in these models are identical , and this independence of @xmath0 holds in the zeldovich approximation @xcite as well as its extension , the adhesion approximation , as emphasized by @xcite .",
    "in fact , it holds remarkably well into the fully nonlinear regime , as shown in the top and middle panels of figure  [ fig : slice ] , where slices of particle distributions at @xmath22 for models with different @xmath0 but identical initial conditions are compared .",
    "these slices are taken from gadget simulations that evolve the particle distribution from @xmath25 .",
    "particle distributions of three spatially flat models with different values of @xmath0 and one open model with @xmath69 are extremely similar to each other ( though particle velocities are higher for higher @xmath0 ) .",
    "@xcite extend the zeldovich / adhesion analytic explanation for this similarity of evolved structure by showing that the equations of motion of a collisionless gravitating system of particles in an expanding universe can be put in a form with almost no dependence on @xmath0 and @xmath70 , if the linear perturbation growth factor is used as the time variable .",
    "the evolutionary histories of the four models in figure  [ fig : slice ] are different , but this difference is captured almost entirely by the dependence of the linear growth factor on redshift .",
    "the bottom two panels demonstrate this point , showing the particle distributions of the flat @xmath71 and @xmath69 models at the redshifts when the linear growth factor is 0.5 , redshifts @xmath72 and @xmath73 , respectively ( we define the growth factor to be unity at @xmath22 . ) in most comparisons of n - body simulations with different @xmath0 , the amplitude and/or shape of @xmath1 is adjusted in concert with @xmath0 .",
    "such adjustments are well motivated by observational and theoretical considerations , but they mask the fact that the influence of @xmath0 at fixed @xmath1 is extremely simple .",
    "earlier examples of matched comparisons like those in figure  [ fig : slice ] include figure  1 of @xcite and figure  5 of @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : slice ] suggests that halo mass functions for different models in this case should be nearly the same when measured as a function of particle number , i.e. , mass divided by @xmath0 .",
    "this expectation is confirmed in figure  [ fig : case1mf ] , which shows mass functions ( from pm simulations ) of four spatially flat models . in the left panel ,",
    "all four ( cumulative ) mass functions have a similar shape and only shift horizontally relative to each other .",
    "when the halo masses are divided by @xmath0 , the four curves become nearly identical and overlap with the @xmath21 curve . to allow a closer inspection , in the right panel",
    "we plot the ratio of the scaled mass functions to that calculated using jenkins et al.s ( 2001 ) fitting formula for the central model .",
    "the maximum relative difference between the four scaled mass functions is only about 10% .",
    "the 10% residual differences reflect slight changes in the characteristic densities and profiles of halos in different cosmologies . for figure",
    "[ fig : case1mf ] , we have identified halos with our standard fof linking length parameter @xmath74 , which picks out structures with mean overdensity @xmath33 ( @xcite ) , close to the value @xmath75 predicted for the post - virialization overdensity in the spherical collapse model for an @xmath21 universe ( @xcite ) . if we instead use @xmath76 , roughly doubling the overdensity threshold ( @xmath77 ) , then halo masses drop by @xmath5220% as previously linked particles are unlinked , but the level of agreement among different cosmological models stay the same .",
    "another fairly common procedure is to scale @xmath78 in proportion to the virial overdensity predicted by the spherical collapse model , thus using a different @xmath79 for each cosmological model . if we adopt this approach , taking the virial overdensities from @xcite , then the discrepancy of the scaled mass functions reverses sign and rises in amplitude to a maximum @xmath80 .",
    "we conclude that the effect of a pure @xmath0 change is described by the simple scaling of halo masses to an accuracy @xmath36 for halos defined at fixed overdensity , that the discrepancies reflect the expected cosmology dependence of the characteristic virial overdensity , but that the magnitude of the cosmology correction predicted by the spherical collapse model is too large .",
    "@xcite also find better agreement among halo mass functions of different cosmological models for halos defined at constant overdensity rather than overdensities scaled according to the spherical collapse model .",
    "henceforth we will use the fixed linking length @xmath74 for all models , but our results would not be substantially different if we used @xmath76 or scaled @xmath79 with cosmology .",
    "the mass correlation functions @xmath81 for these four models are identical at large scales and gradually depart from each other at small scales ( @xmath82 ) , where the higher overdensities for lower @xmath0 boost @xmath81 .",
    "we calculate the two - point correlation function for halos of mass @xmath12 by counting pairs of halos with masses in the range ( @xmath83 , @xmath84 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : case1xi ] shows halo correlation functions @xmath85 for four values of @xmath7 . in each case , the four @xmath0 models are indistinguishable from each other , as we would expect , since @xmath6 scales with @xmath0 , and comparisons at fixed @xmath7 therefore remove any dependence on @xmath0 .",
    "the difference in @xmath81 arises from differences in spatial structure within the halos themselves ( which are difficult to discern in figure  [ fig : slice ] ) .",
    "we also calculate the halo bias factor from the mass and halo correlation functions ( not shown ) .",
    "when plotted as a function of @xmath7 , the bias factors of the four models are almost the same , as expected , and they agree with jing s ( 1998 ) fitting formula to a similar degree as seen in figure  [ fig : scalebias ] .",
    "the halo correlation function plummets at small @xmath86 because two halo centers can not be separated by less than the sum of their virial radii .",
    "halos for different @xmath0 have the same virial radius at a given @xmath7 ( in simulation terms , the scaling of @xmath6 with @xmath0 comes from the particle mass , not a change in halo size ) , so even this exclusion signature is the same in different models .",
    "although mass functions and spatial clustering of halos are nearly identical as a function of @xmath7 , different values of @xmath0 produce different velocity fields .",
    "figure  [ fig : case1ve ] shows the mean pairwise radial ( inward ) velocity , @xmath87 , and the pairwise velocity dispersion , @xmath88 , at @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "here @xmath91 and @xmath92 ( @xmath93 ) are the velocities and positions of a halo pair , and the average is over all halo pairs with separations around @xmath86 .",
    "both @xmath4 and @xmath5 drop as @xmath0 drops .",
    "the mean pairwise radial velocity @xmath4 increases for massive halos and increases much faster for pairs with small separations , a sign of the non - linear infall velocities induced by high mass halos .",
    "the velocity dispersion @xmath5 continues rising out to large separations , and its amplitude at large scales seems to be nearly independent of halo mass .",
    "linear perturbation theory predicts a relation between the peculiar velocity and matter density fields , @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the mass density contrast and @xmath96 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in the four cosmological models considered here , the mass density contrasts @xmath95 should be the same , so linear velocity fields simply scale with @xmath8 .",
    "the dotted curves in figure  [ fig : case1ve ] show the effect of dividing @xmath4 and @xmath5 by @xmath8 ; the agreement of these curves with each other and with the @xmath21 curve demonstrates that the impact of a pure @xmath0 change on halo peculiar velocities is well described by the linear theory scaling even on non - linear scales .",
    "figure  [ fig : slice ] suggests that the agreement of appropriately scaled halo mass functions , correlation functions , and pairwise velocity statistics should hold at other epochs for which the linear growth factors are equal . though we do not show the results here , we have verified explicitly that the matching of scaled statistical measures in figures  [ fig : case1mf ] , [ fig : case1xi ] , and  [ fig : case1ve ] holds equally well at the redshifts when the four models have growth factors of 0.5 ( @xmath72 , 1.36 , 1.50 , and 1.74 for @xmath97 0.4 , 0.3 , 0.2 ) .",
    "thus , for models with the same @xmath1 shape and the same @xmath9 at @xmath22 , the influence of @xmath0 and @xmath70 on the evolutionary history of the halo population is entirely encoded in the linear growth factor .      changing @xmath0 on its own preserves the shape of the halo mass function but shifts the mass scale in proportion to @xmath0 .",
    "this scaling implies that the threshold volume for collapse is independent of @xmath0 , given the same power spectrum .",
    "if we require that the four cosmological models that differ in @xmath0 have halo mass functions that match in amplitude at some physical mass scale ( rather than @xmath7 ) , we need to adjust the power spectrum in a way that builds more massive halos in low-@xmath0 models and fewer massive halos in high-@xmath0 models .",
    "in other words , we need a larger threshold volume for collapse in a low-@xmath0 model , so that its nonlinear mass @xmath6 increases . therefore ,",
    "if the shape of the power spectrum is kept unchanged , a higher @xmath9 is necessary in a lower @xmath0 model in order to compensate for the lower mean mass density .",
    "putting this idea in quantitative form , @xcite argued that the observed abundances of massive clusters of galaxies impose the constraint @xmath98 , with little dependence on the assumed shape of @xmath1 .",
    "many authors have revisited , refined and recalibrated this ",
    "cluster normalization \" constraint ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "one widely used formulation is that of @xcite , who found @xmath99 for a spatially flat universe .",
    "inspired by these results , we now consider a sequence of cluster normalized models in which we keep the shape of @xmath1 fixed but scale the amplitude as @xmath100 .",
    "figure  [ fig : case2mf ] shows cumulative halo mass functions for these cluster normalized models .",
    "mass functions of models with @xmath1010.2 , 0.3 , and 0.4 match in amplitude at a cluster scale ( @xmath102 ) .",
    "the mass function of the @xmath21 model crosses the others at a somewhat lower mass scale , @xmath103 .",
    "the discrepancy in matched mass scale just shows that the @xmath104 scaling does not hold all the way to @xmath21 , and the @xcite formula indeed implies that we should adopt a somewhat higher @xmath9 for @xmath21 .",
    "however , the crucial result for our purposes is that the mass functions of these cluster normalized models have systematically different shapes , and there is no value of @xmath9 we could choose that would make the @xmath21 model match the others at more than a single mass scale . over the smaller range @xmath105 , the cluster normalization condition keeps the halo mass functions reasonably well aligned over about a decade in mass , but by @xmath106 the halo space densities of the @xmath69 and 0.4 models differ from those of the central model by @xmath13 , and from each other by nearly a factor of two .",
    "the reason that cluster normalization does not preserve the shape of the halo mass function is that raising @xmath9 increases @xmath6 but simultaneously drives down the space density of @xmath6 clusters by increasing the scale of non - linearity . for models with the same @xmath1 shape and the same value of @xmath6 ,",
    "the space density of halos at fixed @xmath7 is proportional to @xmath0 ( see equation  ( 7 ) below ) .",
    "the mass functions of cluster normalized models with different @xmath0 must therefore cross at different values of @xmath7 , and because the shapes remain the same as a function of @xmath7 , they can not stay aligned as a function of @xmath12 .    in these cluster normalized models , the amplitude of @xmath81 increases as @xmath0 decreases , as shown in the upper left panel of figure  [ fig : case2xi ] . at large scales , where the mass density field is still linear , @xmath81 is just proportional to the amplitude of its fourier transform , the linear power spectrum , and hence to @xmath107 .",
    "the roughly constant logarithmic offset in figure  [ fig : case2xi ] shows that this multiplicative scaling holds approximately even into the strongly non - linear regime .",
    "however , the remaining panels of figure  [ fig : case2xi ] show that the halo correlation functions are very similar at a fixed physical mass . qualitatively",
    ", this similarity makes sense , since a given mass scale corresponds to a higher value of @xmath7 when @xmath0 is higher , and the correspondingly higher halo bias tends to compensate for the lower mass clustering amplitude .",
    "however , it is impressive just how well this cancellation between mass clustering and halo bias works quantitatively .",
    "the halo exclusion signature does shift to larger scale for lower @xmath0 because of the larger virial radii needed to compensate the lower mass density .",
    "figure  [ fig : case2ve ] shows that the mean pairwise velocity and pairwise dispersion increase with @xmath0 in this cluster normalized sequence , but the dependence is weak , especially at large separations . as in figure  [ fig : case1ve ] , more massive halos have higher pairwise velocities , especially at small separations .",
    "the weak dependence on @xmath0 at large scales can be understood with the help of equation  ( 4 ) . in linear theory ,",
    "velocity is proportional to @xmath108 , which , when combined with the cluster normalization condition , reduces to approximately @xmath109 .",
    "non - linear evolution at small separations amplifies the difference between models , but only slightly .      by varying the amplitude of the power spectrum with @xmath0",
    ", we can match the amplitudes of the cumulative halo mass functions at a given mass scale .",
    "however , this combination of parameter changes does not guarantee a match between the shapes of the mass functions at that mass scale . in order to match both the amplitude and the shape of the halo mass functions",
    ", we must adjust the relative amplitudes of fluctuations at different scales , or , in other words , the shape of @xmath1 .",
    "we therefore need to determine the appropriate combinations of parameters ( @xmath9 and parameters related to the shape of the power spectrum ) for each @xmath0 model so that all models produce halo mass functions that agree both in amplitude and in shape .      instead of searching the parameter space to obtain the right power spectrum combinations , we make use of the analytic form of the halo mass function .",
    "there are three commonly used analytic formulae for halo mass functions .",
    "@xcite developed the first theoretical framework based on the spherical collapse model ( also see @xcite ) and provided the first theoretical formula ( ps formula ) for the halo mass function , which is still widely used .",
    "the ps formula is known to underestimate the halo abundance in the high mass tail ( see @xcite and references therein ) . @xcite",
    "give an analytic formula ( st formula ) obtained by fitting to the results of @xmath20-body simulations , which turns out to be consistent with the ellipsoidal collapse model @xcite .",
    "based on more simulation results , @xcite provide the most accurate fitting formula for halo mass functions .",
    "however , this formula includes an absolute value of a function , which makes it difficult to use for our present purpose : obtaining an analytic solution of parameter combinations that lead to a good match in halo mass functions .",
    "we therefore use the slightly less accurate st formula .",
    "we require that the halo mass function of a given cosmological model match as closely as possible that of the central model at some mass scale .",
    "in other words , at this mass scale , both the amplitudes ( eq .  7 ) and the slopes ( eq .",
    "8) of the two halo mass functions should be equal .",
    "we thus solve these two equations for two unknowns ( @xmath121,@xmath122 ) for each cosmological model .",
    "all the information contained in the power spectrum is fully embedded in ( @xmath121,@xmath122 ) .",
    "therefore , by solving for these two parameters at a given mass scale , we can also determine the normalization @xmath9 and shape of the power spectrum .",
    "the power spectrum can be expressed as @xmath123 , where @xmath14 is the spectral index of the inflationary power spectrum and @xmath124 is the transfer function with shape parameter @xmath15 .",
    "a change in either @xmath14 or @xmath15 leads to a change in the shape of the power spectrum .",
    "we first keep @xmath15 fixed and only tilt @xmath1 . since @xmath125 and @xmath119 is simply the sum of @xmath14 and an index given by the transfer function , it is straightforward to obtain the change in @xmath14 with respect to that of the central model : @xmath126 .",
    "once the shape of @xmath1 is determined , the normalization @xmath9 can be obtained from @xmath122 .",
    "assuming that mass functions are matched against that of the central model at a cluster mass scale @xmath127 , we calculate @xmath14 and @xmath9 as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "the left panel of figure  [ fig : case3par ] shows that both @xmath14 and @xmath9 increase sharply towards low @xmath0 and drop slowly towards high @xmath0 . in order to match with the halo mass function of the central model , we need @xmath1281.33 , 0.82 , 0.42 and @xmath1291.16 , 0.78 , 0.55 for models with @xmath1010.2 , 0.4 , and 1.0 , respectively .",
    "alternatively , we can keep the spectral index @xmath14 fixed ( @xmath14=1 in our calculation ) and change the shape parameter @xmath15 .",
    "the right panel of figure  [ fig : case3par ] shows @xmath15 as a function of @xmath0 when halo mass functions are matched at @xmath127 .",
    "the shape parameter @xmath15 also has a sharp increase towards low @xmath0 and a slow drop towards high @xmath0 . for models with @xmath1010.2 , 0.4 , and 1.0 , solutions to @xmath15",
    "are 0.35 , 0.14 , and 0.06 , respectively . in this case , the normalization @xmath9 of each model is almost identical to that of the tilted model , which indicates that the two ways of changing the shape of the power spectrum are equivalent at this mass scale .",
    "although pure-@xmath14 and pure-@xmath15 changes alter the power spectrum in different ways , they produce power spectra ( and thus mass functions ) that match closely over a fairly large dynamic range , covering most of the regime in which @xmath130 is of order unity .",
    "the near degeneracy can be broken by examining the low mass end of the halo mass functions .",
    "more generally , we could allow both @xmath14 and @xmath15 to change .",
    "in that case , for each value of @xmath0 , there would be a 1-dimensional locus in the @xmath131 plane along which models would satisfy the requirement of matching the central model s halo mass function at some mass scale .",
    "however , we expect that results from this more general case would be similar to those of the two simple cases .      using the power spectrum parameters given by the above analytic solutions , we run simulations and make comparisons with the central model . here",
    "we only show results for different tilt models , since models with different values of @xmath15 give similar results .",
    "figure  [ fig : case3mf ] shows cumulative halo mass functions for the four cosmological models .",
    "the mass functions agree with each other quite well over a large mass range ( from @xmath132 to @xmath133 ) , with only @xmath36 relative differences .",
    "we do not expect the cumulative mass functions to match exactly both in amplitude and in slope at @xmath127 , for three reasons .",
    "first , the st formula is not a perfect fit to the halo mass functions in the simulations .",
    "second , we locally approximate the power spectrum as a power - law in order to obtain analytic solutions for the power spectrum parameters .",
    "third , we require a match for differential mass functions instead of cumulative mass functions . nevertheless , the cumulative mass functions trace each other remarkably well .",
    "the non - linear mass scales are quite different for these four models : @xmath134 , @xmath135 , @xmath136 , and @xmath137 , for @xmath69 , 0.3 , 0.4 , 1.0 , respectively .",
    "figure  [ fig : case3xi ] shows two - point correlation functions of the mass and halos .",
    "mass is more strongly clustered in low @xmath0 models , having a correlation function that is steeper and higher in amplitude than in higher @xmath0 models .",
    "however , the clustering of halos exhibits the opposite trend .",
    "halos in the @xmath21 model are highly biased with respect to those of other models , as one might guess from the low nonlinear mass of this model , and this bias more than compensates for the weaker mass clustering .",
    "conversely , at the mass scale @xmath138 , shown in the upper right panel of figure  [ fig : case3xi ] , halos in the @xmath69 model are actually anti - biased with respect to the mass .",
    "figure  [ fig : case2xi ] shows that for cluster normalized models with fixed @xmath1 shape , the effects of bias almost exactly cancel the change in @xmath9 , leaving @xmath85 nearly independent of @xmath0 . since our mass function matching approach imposes a redder @xmath1 shape ( lower @xmath14 or @xmath15 ) for higher @xmath0 , and increased large scale power amplifies the importance of bias , it is not surprising that bias _ over _ compensates mass clustering changes in these models , leaving @xmath85 steadily dependent on @xmath0 .",
    "figure  [ fig : case3ve ] shows the mean pairwise radial velocity and pairwise velocity dispersion for the four cosmological models . as in the case of cluster normalized models , models with higher @xmath0 have larger mean pairwise velocities and velocity dispersions than lower @xmath0 models .",
    "the dependence on @xmath0 is stronger and more systematic than that in figure  [ fig : case2ve ] , again a sign of the redder power spectrum of higher @xmath0 models .",
    "we have examined how changes to the matter density parameter @xmath0 and the shape and amplitude of the linear power spectrum @xmath1 affect the halo mass function , the two - point halo correlation function , and the first and second moments of the halo pairwise velocity distribution . a change in @xmath0 , at fixed @xmath1 , simply shifts the halo mass scale .",
    "therefore , if halo masses are scaled in proportion to @xmath0 , halo populations of different @xmath0 models have identical mass functions and clustering properties .",
    "however , mean pairwise velocities and pairwise velocity dispersions , which scale as @xmath8 on large scales ( and fairly far into the non - linear regime ) break this degeneracy . a change of the power spectrum amplitude ( @xmath9 ) along with @xmath0 ,",
    "maintaining a cluster normalization condition @xmath104 , produces halo populations that have nearly identical spatial clustering at a fixed physical mass scale and systematic but small differences in the mean pairwise velocities and pairwise velocity dispersions .",
    "however , while these cluster normalized models have the same halo space density at @xmath139 several @xmath140 , the shapes of their mass functions are systematically different .",
    "if we further allow the shape of the power spectrum to change ( either by tilting it or by changing its shape parameter @xmath15 ) , we can produce halo populations whose mass functions match very well both in amplitude and in shape , over a large mass range .",
    "the changes to the power spectrum shape cause correlation functions , mean pairwise velocities , and velocity dispersions for halos in the same mass range to differ .",
    "we conclude that the halo populations produced by distinct cosmological models are not degenerate .",
    "if they are indistinguishable by one statistic , they can be told apart using another statistic .",
    "our results imply that a perfect knowledge of the halo population and its properties would allow us to pin down the underlying cosmological parameters  specifically the value of @xmath0 and the shape and amplitude of @xmath1  even before bringing in constraints from other cosmological measurements .",
    "however , a galaxy redshift survey detects galaxies rather than halos .",
    "could changes to the halo occupation distribution ( hod ) mask the differences in the halo populations of different cosmological models ?",
    "models that differ only in @xmath0 lead to the same halo mass function and halo clustering in terms of @xmath7 , but with @xmath141 .",
    "their halos could be thus be populated the same way as a function of @xmath7 to produce indistinguishable galaxy spatial clustering",
    ". however , any dynamically sensitive statistics ",
    "virial masses of clusters and groups , pairwise velocity dispersions , the parameter combination @xmath142 inferred from redshift - space distortions , the galaxy - mass correlation function from galaxy - galaxy lensing  would distinguish models with different values of @xmath0 immediately .",
    "velocity bias within halos could mask some of these changes , but not all of them @xcite .",
    "cluster - normalized models with different @xmath0 and the same @xmath1 shape have different halo mass functions , and they would therefore require a different @xmath19 in order to keep the galaxy density fixed . this change would likely cause differences in the galaxy clustering even though the halo clustering is similar , since galaxy clustering is highly sensitive to @xmath19 ( @xcite and references therein ) . changing the shape of @xmath1 by the amount required to match mass function shapes",
    "makes substantial differences to the halo clustering and velocities , which seem unlikely to be masked by a change in the hod .",
    "these speculations suggest that distinct cosmological models , which produce nondegenerate halo populations , can not have galaxy populations that are indistinguishable in every spatial and velocity statistic , even if one allows complete freedom in the way that galaxies occupy these halos .",
    "we reserve a detailed investigation of this issue for future work .",
    "if our optimistic speculation holds true , then high precision measurements of galaxy clustering and galaxy - galaxy lensing should impose strong constrains on cosmological models without reliance on _ a priori _ models of galaxy bias .",
