    "extragalactic h@xmath0o maser emission at 22 ghz is known in 104 active galactic nuclei ( agn)(@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , braatz et al .",
    "2008 , in preparation ) . in early analyses , the majority of the nuclei for which pointed x - ray observations exist are compton thick or nearly so , with columns ( n@xmath7 ) @xmath2 @xmath3 @xcite .",

    "`` megamasers '' ) , 85% exhibited n@xmath7 @xmath10 @xmath3 and 50% exceeded @xmath11 @xmath3 .",
    "@xcite focus on a probably more homogeneous sub - sample for which maser spectra suggest the emission specifically traces rotating , highly inclined disk structures close to the central engines .",
    "( we refer to these as `` disk masers . '' ) seven of 9 nuclei with disk masers were compton thick .",
    "it is plausible that agn which host masers are characterized by high n@xmath7 in general , because large reservoirs of molecular gas along the line of sight are required to produce substantial maser amplification @xcite . among disk masers ,",
    "prevalence of high n@xmath7 may be anticipated because the emission is believed to arise in inclined disk structures .",
    "we have analyzed new , archival , and published x - ray data for maser agn and examine the statistics of the updated sample , now about one third larger than that of @xcite .",
    "masers show promise as signposts of compton - thick agn that are readily detected from the ground . in @xmath12 , we describe new spectral analyses and estimation of n@xmath7 .",
    "we discuss selection effects in the full sample and inferences about maser agn in @xmath13 .",
    "we observed seven maser - host agn using the xmm - newton observatory .",
    "in addition , we identified unpublished observations of five disk - maser hosts in the xmm and chandra archives ( 12 targets total ) .",
    "all data were reduced using standard tasks in sas and ciao .",
    "xmm observations of ngc 6323 and ngc 6264 were lost due to flaring ; ngc 3735 and ngc 2639 were lost due to high background .",

    "xmm epic pn spectra were extracted from 30@xmath14 circles centered on the brightest pixels within 2@xmath14 of the target coordinates ( comparable to the 1.5@xmath14 astrometric accuracy ) .",
    "background spectra were extracted from 80@xmath14 circles , centered off - source , as far from the readout nodes as the targets .",
    "we did not use epic mos data due to smaller effective area above 2kev .",
    "chandra acis target spectra were extracted from 6@xmath14 circles , while the backgrounds were obtained from annuli centered on the targets , with radii of 15@xmath14 and 30@xmath14 .",

    "importantly , this is accompanied in five sources by fe k@xmath1 emission with large equivalent widths ( ews ) , regardless of continuum model ( tab.2 ; fig.[figspectra ] ) .",
    "the strong lines probably arise from continuum reprocessing via fluorescence when the central engine is detected only in compton reflection ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "since signal to noise is relatively low for a majority of targets , we adopted a `` minimum '' model with a common set of fixed and free parameters .",
    "because of degeneracies , results are best viewed as indicative .",
    "we assumed that the continuum is entirely described by reflection ( a pexrav model ) with underlying ( incident ) photon index fixed to 1.7 .",
    "larger values ( @xmath16 ; e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ) observed toward type-1 agn are also consistent .",
    "we modeled the fe k@xmath1 lines as gaussians with fixed 6.4kev rest - frame energy and @xmath17ev intrinsic width .",
    "we also added a mekal component to match better emission below 2kev . fitted sub - solar abundances , when these arose , were probably not an accurate reflection of composition , but rather a consequence of a one - temperature model and omission of photoionization effects .",
    "separate absorption columns were applied to mekal and pexrav plus line components .",
    "spectral fitting with even the minimum model shows fe k@xmath1 line emission in mrk34 , mrk1419 and ngc6926 , as well as marginally in ngc5793 ( tab.2 ; fig.[figspectra ] ) .",
    "we compute ews with respect to the reflected continuum . in the case of ngc5793",
    ", we obtained ew=2.38kev(@xmath18/d.o.f=26.6/26 ) with a 0kev bound . freeing the line energy , we obtained ew=2.46@xmath19kev and @xmath18/d.o.f.= 24.9/24 , for line energy 6.32@xmath20kev ( rest ) .",
    "the shift in line energy may be due to coarse binning .",
    "some elaboration on the minimum model was required for mrk34 , to accommodate excess near 7kev , which we fit with a second gaussian at 7.05kev ( rest ) with @xmath17ev , corresponding to fe k@xmath21 .",
    "ews @xmath22kev for mrk34 , mrk1419 , and ngc6926 are consistent with n@xmath23 1 - 2@xmath2410@xmath25 @xmath3 @xcite , though quantitative interpretation depends on geometry .",
    "this and intrinsic limitations of the minimum model argue for inferred columns to be best regarded as indicative .",
    "no estimates are possible for eso013-g012 and vv340a because neither exhibited clear fe k@xmath1 emission ( though both showed marginal excess at @xmath26kev ) .",

    "substitution ( over time ) of n@xmath7 estimates for lower limits will exagerrate this .",
    "in contrast , the distribution for agn masers without evidence of origins in edge - on disks includes a larger proportion of compton - thin sources . a kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) test indicates a @xmath54 probability that the two distributions are drawn from a single parent . to account for lower limits in our test",

    "@xcite discussed an alternate sub - sample , selected based on apparent maser luminosity ( i.e. , megamasers ) . within the current sample of 42 agn with masers",
    ", we count 58% ( 18 of 31 ) of recognized megamaser hosts are compton thick ( 13 from @xcite , plus ngc1194 , ngc6926 , mrk1 , mrk1419 , and mrk34 ) , matching the incidence among maser agn broadly ( tab.[tabnh ] ) .",
    "we link the larger incidence of columns @xmath59@xmath3 among disk - masers to a simple model geometry ( edge - on orientation ) and contrast this with selection based on maser luminosity , which is nearly always estimated with the convenient but inaccurate assumption of isotropic emission , without knowledge of beam angles and orientation to the line of sight .",
    "columns @xmath60 @xmath3 are more common in maser agn than in a sample of 22 hard x - ray ( 14 - 195kev ) selected , similarly nearby agn observed with swift @xcite , which includes no maser hosts ( 95% vs 50% ; tab.[tabnh ] ) . however , for n@xmath61@xmath3 , incidence rates are similar ( 60% vs 50% ) . for masers in all classes of agn , we estimate a statistically similar frequency of compton - thick columns to that reported by @xcite and @xcite among seyfert2 objects : @xmath62 ( 22 of 48 ) and 65% ( 22 of 34 ) , respectively . however , this is somewhat below the rate for masers associated with seyfert2 nuclei , 74% ( 20 of 27 ) .",
    "the difference is suggestive but comparison of column distributions of maser systems and local type-2 agn is complicated by sample incompleteness in luminosity and distance , overlap between the x - ray and maser samples ( e.g. , 15/45 sources for risaliti _ et al . _  1999 ) , and uncertainty in x - ray luminosities for obscured agn ( though aperture and extinction - corrected [ oiii ] luminosities could be used in place of x - ray estimates , e.g. , melndez _ et al . _  2008 )",
    ".    demonstrated correlation between incidence of maser emission and high n@xmath7 may suggest a new strategy for future efforts to identify obscured agn .",
    "this is of particular interest if such objects are indeed substantial contributors to the hard x - ray background .",
    "heavily obscured agn typically have relatively low apparent luminosities and require long integrations ( e.g. , @xmath63 ksec to obtain @xmath64 counts for @xmath65kms@xmath15 ) .",
    "in contrast , maser emission in agn as distant as @xmath66kms@xmath15 can be detected with integrations on the order of 1ksec , using a well - instrumented 100m - dish antenna .",
    "we characterize the relative efficiency of maser and pointed x - ray observations , @xmath67 , by the ratio of compton - thick agn discoverable in a fixed time by each means , for a sample of optically identified type-2 objects .",
    "we obtain @xmath68 from @xmath69 / [ 10 ^ 3 x_{ct}]$ ] , where @xmath70 is the maser detection rate ( @xmath71 ; kondratko _ et al . _",
    "2006 ) , @xmath72 is the compton thick fraction of maser agn ( @xmath73 ; tab.[tabnh ] ) , and @xmath74 is the fraction of type-2 agn found to be compton thick in x - ray studies ( @xmath75 ; e.g. , risaliti _ et al . _  1999 ) .",
    "deep , wide - field , hard x - ray surveys ( e.g. , nustar ) will extend synergy with maser studies , creating statistically significant x - ray and joint x - ray / radio samples .",
    "nonetheless , there will be practical constraints on survey fields ( @xmath76 for nustar ) , and all - sky radio observations with well - defined completeness criteria could usefully guide pointed follow - up to enrich x - ray samples .",
    "strengthened correlation between disk - maser emission and large obscuring columns begs the question , is maser gas in disks responsible for obscuration in type-2 objects @xcite ?",
    "on the one hand , obscuration by cold disk gas at radii of 0.2 - 0.3 pc is inferred in ngc 4258 @xcite , and for circinus along other lines of sight @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "time - variable n@xmath7 data indicate obscuration at radii of a few@xmath77 pc toward ngc1365 , ngc4388 , and ngc4151 @xcite .",
    "direct physical association of maser and obscuring gas volumes still appears to be case - specific .",
    "highly inclined structures that give rise to disk masers probably span a range of radii , at least extending inward with accretion flows .",
    "where these cross the line of sight to the central engine , and how extensively , likely depends on the detailed geometry of each system , requiring case study to establish .",
