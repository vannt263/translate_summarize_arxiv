    "explicitly , this follows , for example , from theorem 1.1.1 in  @xcite by rewriting the exponential term as the solution to a stochastic differential equation driven by @xmath6 .",
    "nevertheless , we can show that a variation of the robustness representation formula still exists in this case .",
    "for this we need to `` enhance '' the original process @xmath6 by adding a second component to it which consists of its iterated integrals ( that , knowing the path , is in a one - to - one correspondance with the lvy area process ) .",
