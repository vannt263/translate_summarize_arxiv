    "a lot of works about cp ",
    "asymmetry effects in the top quark decays@xcite have been done within the supersymmetric model .",
    "most of those works have made the assumption that the mass of the light top squark is much smaller than that of the top quark . b.grzadkowski and w.y.keung calculated the cp violating effects induced by @xmath6-loop@xcite .",

    "3 we sketch the main steps of our calculations . in sec .",
    "4 we present our numerical results and in sec . 5 and sec .",
    "6 we discuss and summarize our results .",
    "the mass matrices for charginos , neutralinos and squarks are given in appendix a. in appendix b we give the relevant pieces of the lagrangian for our calculations and some analytic results are presented in appendix c.",
    "the most general form of the low energy lagrangian of mssm@xcite , which is @xmath18 gauge invariant and does not violate the sm conservation laws , can be written as @xmath19 the superpotential @xmath20 is given by @xmath21 where @xmath22 = -1 .",

    "i , j refer to the components of a su(2 ) doublet .",
    "the l , d , u are the yukawa coupling matrices .",

    "they are given by    @xmath24    @xmath25    @xmath26    where @xmath27,@xmath28,@xmath29 are u(1 ) , su(2 ) and su(3 ) gauginos masses respectively .",
    "fields in @xmath30 and @xmath31 are scalar components of the corresponding superfields",
    ".    in general , all the coupling parameters in the above expressions except those of the diagonal terms in @xmath30 may be complex which may be the cp violating sources",
    ". however , not all of them are physical and , even the physical parameters are too many to be disposed of . in actual calculations , simplifying assumptions must be made .",
    "we get the physical cp violating phases by the following steps .",
    "first , we take the gut assumption that the @xmath32s are universal at the gut scale and can be set real by a phase rotation@xcite . thus , the @xmath33s are real at any scale .",
    "second , we adjust the global phase between the two higgs superfields so that @xmath34 is real .",
    "this adjustment makes the two vacuum expectation values of the neutral higgs fields @xmath35 , @xmath36 real@xcite . after the adjustment",
    "the phases of the two higgs superfields are fixed and @xmath16 is complex in general .",
    "third , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 in the superpotential are diagonalized and the unphysical phases are absorbed by quark superfields similar to that done in the standard model .",
    "this leaves a cp violating phases @xmath40 in the after the superfield are redefined .",
    "fourth , to suppress the fcnc process in the susy extension of sm , as an approximation we require that all the matrices in @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 are flavor diagonal in the basis where @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 are diagonal ( flavor alignment@xcite ) . then the hermitian matrices in @xmath30 are now all real .",
    "the phases of all squarks are fixed after the third step .",
    "therefore , @xmath48 , @xmath47 are generally complex . in conclusion ,",
    "@xmath40 , @xmath50 , @xmath51s and @xmath52s are the cp violating phases in the low energy supersymmtric model under our assumptions .",
    "@xmath50 can not be larger than the order @xmath53 by the constraint from the experimental limit of the neutron edm@xcite . in our calculation",
    ", we always take @xmath16 to be real and thus no cp  violating effects are induced by @xmath16 .",
    "the cp violating effects induced by @xmath54 are greatly suppressed because they are proportional to the masses of the corresponding quarks which can be neglected compared with the squark mass parameters in @xmath30 except that induced by @xmath55 which is associated with the top quark(see the form of squark mass matrices in ( a.8 ) and ( a.9 ) in appendix a ) .",
    "thus , @xmath56 is the only new cp violating source in our calculation .",
    "after the interaction terms in the potential are diagonalized , the mssm lagrangian will be expressed by mass eigenstates instead of gauge eigenstates .",
    "the cp violating phases are then transferred to the gauge interaction vertices ( see appendix b for related lagrangian pieces ) .",

    "this implies that the cp violating effects comes from @xmath0 .",

    "we now discuss the cp violating effects in the process @xmath61 , which corresponds to diagrams in fig.1 , within the mssm framework .",

    "@xmath112 and @xmath113 are denominators of the two boson propagators in the loop graphs .",
    "note that the sm phase from @xmath96 is cancelled in the interference of the tree diagram and the one  loop diagrams .",
    "we get the analytic expressions for @xmath114 by integrating the phase space of @xmath3 and @xmath2 in @xmath115 system .",
    "the analytic results are given in appendix c. by expressing the formulae in lorentz invariant form , we translate the formulae to the top quark rest system . in this system",
    "the final state three body phase space integration is implemented numerically .",
    "all the @xmath116s for each graphs are proportional to @xmath117 ( for detail expressions of @xmath116s , see appendix c ) , so , we can write @xmath118 where @xmath119 @xmath120 and @xmath121 are given in ( a.13 ) and ( a.9 ) of appendix a. in terms of parameters in the top squark mass matrix we get that @xmath122 from the expression of @xmath123 in ( a.13 ) of appendix a we can see that @xmath124 can be as large as @xmath125 when the following conditions are satisfied at the same time , i.e. , @xmath126 , @xmath127 and @xmath55 is purely imaginary .",

    "another limit for the parameter space is adopted for simplicity that we require @xmath147 and @xmath148 .",

    "especially that @xmath50=0 and @xmath155 is that figs.2c , 2d and 2f do not acquire any cp  violating phase .",
    "so only figs.2a , 2b and 2e are considered .",
    "it is found numerically that more than 90% of contributions to @xmath156 come from the triangle diagram fig.2e .",

    "the dependence of @xmath156 on @xmath136 is plotted in fig.8 and fig.9 , for several values of @xmath135 and for @xmath164 and @xmath165 , respectively .",
    "an interesting feature of these two figures is that @xmath166 decreases as @xmath136 increases whereas @xmath167 increases .",
    "this is because low @xmath136 gives strong yukawa coupling for top quark so that we get large @xmath166 .",
    "however , large @xmath136 makes the threshold lower and thus elevates @xmath167 .",
    "so , @xmath167 prefers bigger @xmath136 in contrast to the situation in the top quark two body decays .",
    "as @xmath168 , we can see from fig.8 that @xmath82 is almost insensitive to @xmath136 .",

    "finally , we give the dependence of @xmath156 on the top squark mass in fig.11 for @xmath165 .",
    "it is found that @xmath156 depends essentially only on @xmath13 , not separately on @xmath133 and c. @xmath156 decreases with @xmath170 , just as what has been expected .",

    "we would like to point out two points in this section .",
    "the branch ratio for top quark decay drops rapidly when w boson is off shell . for @xmath171",
    "the branch ratio for @xmath172 final state is only about @xmath173 according to our calculation .",
    "however , as we have mentioned that the contributions to @xmath156 comes mainly from the triangle diagrams in fig.2 , @xmath156 for different final states have the same sign and approximately the same size .",
    "so we can make a combining analysis for the data of the three body cp asymmetries for different three fermion final states ( @xmath174 ) , ( @xmath175 ) , ( @xmath176 ) , and all allowed three quark decays .",
    "the total branch ratio for top quark three body decay for @xmath171 can reach up to about @xmath177",

    "such a minus sign is absent in the corresponding amplitude in fig.2 . on the contrary",
    ", there is a minus sign in front of the box diagram in fig.2 .",

    "odd effects are observable in top quark two body decays in one  loop level . in our calculation @xmath156 can reach up to 0.55% in the most favorable case .",
    "considering the small total branch ratio for @xmath182 which is about @xmath177 for all three body decays it is really hard to detect such small effects experimentally .",
    "however , several constraint in our calculations can be relaxed .",
    "for example , the gaugino mass parameters @xmath183 and @xmath135 can be complex and give new cp  violating sources if we do not make the universal assumption about the gauginos masses in gut scale .",
    "another possible cp source is from the higgs mass parameter @xmath16 .",
    "according to recent studies on the neutron edm , cancellation among different contributions can take place so that @xmath16 can have large imaginary part even when super particles are in @xmath184 level@xcite .",
    "if this is the case , complex @xmath16 can introduce additional cp asymmetries in top quark decays . and",
    ", if we relax the constraint on the @xmath13 to be slightly above 100gev , @xmath13 and @xmath185 cut can also give contribution to @xmath156 in three body decays . another improvement may come from branch ratio enhancement .",
