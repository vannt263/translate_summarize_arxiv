    "the second model was introduced in @xcite , in which the subleading functions are defined in terms of a single function @xmath189 the dimensionless free parameter @xmath6 is constrained to be @xmath190 by the requirement that the @xmath191th moments of the functions scale like @xmath192 .",
    "we will take @xmath193 in our plots ; larger values of @xmath6 reduce the effects of the subleading shape functions .",
    "we have @xmath194 note that in the first model the subleading shape functions vanish at @xmath195 , while in the second they are finite but nonzero .    in our third model",
    ", we use a model for the subleading shape functions that has an additional sign flip in the region of integration . we take @xmath196 where @xmath197 we plot the function @xmath198 in each of these models in .    : model 1 ( solid curve ) , model 2 ( dashed curve ) and model 3 ( dot - dashed curve ) . ]",
    "although the models have very different behaviour , we can verify that they are all reasonable by calculating the first few moments @xmath199 in each model and showing that they are of order @xmath200 .",
    "for @xmath201 gev , for model 1 we find @xmath202 and @xmath203 .",
    "for model 2 we find @xmath204 and @xmath205 , while for model 3 the corresponding moments are @xmath206 and @xmath207 .",
    "thus , the first few moments of each model scale like typical hadronic scales to the appropriate power .",
    "similar results are obtained for the moments of @xmath208 and @xmath198 .",
    "both the wilson coefficients and models for the shape functions depend on the @xmath6 quark mass @xmath26 . while in our formulas we are implicitly using the pole mass",
    ", it is well - known that this leads to badly behaved perturbative series , and so we expect that radiative corrections to these results will be minimized if a sensible short - distance mass is used instead .",
    "the @xmath209 mass @xmath210 is well - defined , but does not lead to small perturbative corrections in @xmath8 decays @xcite .",
    "threshold \" masses , including the 1s mass , ps mass and kinetic mass , are preferable in this context . at two - loops ,",
    "a pole mass of @xmath201 gev corresponds to a kinetic mass @xmath211 of about 4.6 gev , ps and 1s masses of about @xmath212 and an @xmath209 mass @xmath213 of about 4.3 gev .",
    "thus , to give an estimate of the @xmath26 dependence of our results , we plot them for @xmath201 gev and @xmath214 gev .",
    "in , we plot the hadronic invariant mass spectrum using the three models of the previous section for the subleading corrections . these corrections are clearly large and model dependent over much of the spectrum .",

    "the three curves refer to the three different models in .",
    "@xmath222 includes all the subleading corrections , including those proportional to the leading order shape function , while @xmath221 only includes the corrections from subleading shape functions .",
    "the right vertical line denotes the kinematic limit @xmath217 ; the left line denotes the  cut @xmath218.,width=624 ]    from these figures it is clear that , at least for the particular models we have chosen , the subleading shape functions do not contribute a large uncertainty in the extraction of @xmath4 , and that the dominant subleading effects are from the kinematic terms .",
    "this should not be surprising : since there are no @xmath0 corrections to the total semileptonic decay rate @xcite , the subleading corrections must vanish when integrated over the full spectrum .",
    "since the experimental cuts include a large fraction of the rate , the contribution to the integrated rate from the subleading corrections is correspondingly suppressed .",
    "this is evident from the plots in , where the fractional correction tends to zero as the cut is increased .",
    "it is useful to compare these results with analogous results for the lepton energy spectrum in semileptonic @xmath8 decays , given in @xcite . in this case , only @xmath223 of the rate is included , and the subleading corrections are substantial .",

    "it is clear from the figures that for lepton cuts near the kinematic limit @xmath229 gev , the uncertainty in @xmath4 from higher order shape functions is much greater for the lepton energy spectrum than from the hadronic invariant mass spectrum .     for the semileptonic @xmath230 decay width with a charged lepton energy cut , as defined in .",
    "the three curves refer to the three different models in .",
    "the solid line denotes the kinematic upper limit from @xmath231 decay.,width=624 ]",
    "we have calculated the hadronic invariant mass spectrum for @xmath3 in terms of shape functions to subleading order .",
    "introducing some simple models for the shape functions we have studied the @xmath1 spectrum numerically .    since we know little about the form of the subleading shape functions , it is difficult to estimate the corresponding theoretical uncertainty in @xmath4 .",
    "however , using the spread of models as a guide , we can conclude that the largest subleading effects are proportional to the leading order shape function , and so , given a determination of the shape function from @xmath5 decay , do not increase the theoretical uncertainty . assuming our spread of models provides a reasonable measure of the theoretical uncertainty",
    ", we can conclude that the theoretical uncertainty in @xmath4 due to higher order shape functions is at the few percent level .",
    "this is substantially less than the corresponding uncertainty in the integrated lepton energy spectrum with the current experimental cuts .",
    "this is also much less than the other sources of experimental and theoretical error in the current measurements of the integrated hadronic energy spectrum .",
