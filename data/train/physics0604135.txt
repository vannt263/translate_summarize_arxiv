    "the atomic level configuration consists of six levels as shown in figure 1 .",
    "the levels labeled @xmath2 form the triplet of the ground state f@xmath3=1 state with magnetic quantum numbers m@xmath4 respectively .",
    "those , that are labeled @xmath5 and @xmath6 are similarly the zeeman sublevels of the excited state f@xmath7 , with their magnetic quantum numbers m@xmath8 and @xmath9 . for sake of convenience",
    "the levels f@xmath3=1 and f@xmath7 could be hyperfine levels of the ground state 5s@xmath10 and of the first excited state 5p@xmath10 , respectively of @xmath11 .",
    "any two hyperfine states with f=1 , of any other alkali atom , such as sodium for instance , will give identical results .",
    "two beams , plane polarized in orthogonal directions are incident on this system . for the probe beam",
    ", we use the one which is plane polarized along the z - axis of quantisation .",
    "this beam couples the transitions @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the dipole transition between @xmath14 is forbidden due to vanishing clebsch - gordon coefficients .",
    "the other beam is plane polarized in xy plane , thus forming a combination of two circularly polarized lights with helicities @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "this beam therefore couples transitions @xmath17 .",
    "we refer to this as the pump beam .",
    "we then analyse the response of the medium to the probe beam , as modified by the pump beam .    in the semi - classical approach ,",
    "the pump and the probe beam are represented by their electromagnetic fields @xmath18 and @xmath19 respectively , where @xmath20 is the slowly varying envelop of the pump field and @xmath21 , that of the probe field . @xmath22 and @xmath23 are their respective angular frequencies . the pump beam is assumed to propagate in z direction , while probe beam can propagate either in x or y directions to give the required polarization .",
    "we assume it to be y direction for the sake of convenience .",
    "for rest of this paper , we refer these two beams by their respective rabi frequencies @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 .    a closely resembling configuration has been analyzed and reported by petrosyan et .",
    "@xcite showing an efficient two - photon process occurs in the media , with one photon from the pump beam and another from the probe .",
    "the authors present study of propagation effects in a situation where the @xmath27 and @xmath28 levels are zeeman shifted .",
    "our analysis differs from theirs in three aspects .",
    "firstly we look at the steady state phenomena , which can model most experiments involving cw lasers as well as very long pulses .",
    "secondly we analyze a nearly - degenerate system with no zeeman shifts involved , which , as we show , exhibits a wide variety of non - linear phenomena .",
    "thirdly , we derive a general method for obtaining numerical solutions of such systems with no restrictions on intensities of pump and probe beams .",
    "the method obtains results to all orders of magnitude in pump and probe beams and hence can be adopted even when probe and pump beams are of comparable intensities , or even when probe is stronger than the pump .",
    "we present the procedure involved to obtain numerical solutions below .",
    "the hamiltonian governing the system is given by @xmath29 where ,    @xmath30    @xmath31    @xmath32 are the eigen - energies of the states @xmath33 and @xmath34 respectively in terms of angular frequencies and @xmath35 .",
    "the coupling factors are defined as @xmath36    relative sign difference for transition between @xmath37 ) arises due to a sign difference between dipole matrix elements such that @xmath38    the evolution of 6x6 density matrix of the system is governed by the liouville equation @xmath39 + { \\cal l } \\rho\\label{liouville}.\\ ] ]    @xmath40 denote the terms involving decay terms that originate from both spontaneous emission and collisional mixing .",
    "we assume that collisions do not bring about any significant mixing between @xmath41 and @xmath42 states although collisional transfer within the zeeman substates of @xmath41 and @xmath42 are significant .",
    "that is , most collisions are of the spin - flip kind . the equations for each term of density matrix @xmath43 are explicitly written in appendix .",
    "traditional method of obtaining solutions for the equations involve a transformation into a rotating frame of reference such that the right hand side of equation ( [ liouville ] ) has constant coefficients .",
    "however using either of the two frequencies involved , namely that of probe or the pump beam , have oscillating coefficients .",
    "in other words , there exist two rotating frames of reference with rotational frequencies of @xmath22 and @xmath23 , and choosing either one of them as stationary will result in the other one rotate at a frequency equal to the difference between the two of them .",
    "to solve such a system , we chose a rotational transformation with the pump frequency @xmath22 such that the transitions connected by pump beam is seen stationary would equally serve . ] .",
    "these are the transitions @xmath44 and @xmath45 , which are the three levels configurations @xmath0 and v , which are independently studied in the past .",
    "the probe beam couples these two subsystems whose transitions are now investigated .",
    "accordingly , a rotational transformation is operated such as    @xmath46    the equations in such a rotated frame become @xmath47    @xmath48 is a 35 x 35 matrix that involves all interaction terms which are due to @xmath22 field alone , and those related to free evolution .",
    "these terms are seen as stationary in the rotating frame chosen . on the other hand , terms in @xmath49 and @xmath50 , which are also 35 x 35 matrices contain terms coupled to @xmath51 field and thus have terms with @xmath52 in the exponent .",
    "terms with a positive exponent ( i.e. , rotation with a frequency of @xmath53 are grouped in @xmath49 and those with a rotation in the opposite sense are grouped in @xmath50 .",
    "these terms are go to zero when @xmath51 is zero .",
    "@xmath54 is the single column matrix of dimension ( 35x1 ) .",
    "the column @xmath54 depends on the way the constraint    @xmath55    is used to write ( [ eq1 ] ) . in ( [ eq1 ] )",
    "the element @xmath56 has been eliminated using ( [ constr ] ) .",
    "explicit values for @xmath57 and @xmath54 that are used in our calculations are given in appendix .",
    "the solution of ( [ eq1 ] ) is obtained by assuming @xmath58 substituting ( [ series ] ) in ( [ eq1 ] ) and equating synchronous terms on both sides of ( [ eq1 ] ) , one obtains @xmath59 \\bar \\rho^{(n)}+m_+\\bar \\rho^{(n-1)}+m_- \\bar \\rho^{(n+1 ) } + i_0 \\delta_{n0}.\\ ] ] @xmath60 is the 35 x 35 identity matrix .",
    "these equations determine the dynamics of the different subsystems that exist in our main system .",
    "the transfer of populations and coherences from one subsystem to the other can be determined from here . in this paper we present results in steady state .",
    "the steady state is described as the state that is created as a result of equilibrium reached due to the continuous exchange of populations and coherences among different subsystems due to the incoherent processes like collisions and spontaneous emission as well as coherent interactions due to the two fields .",
    "such a steady state is characterized mathematically by setting on left hand side @xmath61 . using this condition leads to three term algebraic recursion relations @xcite , which can be solved in the following way :    we define square matrices @xmath62 such that @xmath63 and use these in the recursion relations for different @xmath64 , @xmath65",
    "one finds @xmath66    then @xmath67 is given by    @xmath68    this completes consistent mathematical procedure used for the numerical study for variety of cases in the six level model .",
    "the numerical procedure involves truncating the recursion relation ( [ eq4 ] ) and ( [ eq5 ] ) for sufficiently large values of integers n and m such that the result of ( [ eq6 ] ) converge to stable values .",
    "these are then used to determine other observables of the system using ( [ eq2 ] ) and ( [ eq3 ] ) above .",
    "this method , which is non - perturbative in approach , can be used for arbitrary intensities of pump and probe beams , as long as result of ( [ eq6 ] ) converges . the methodology adopted to solve this system",
    "can be extended to study several other configurations which involve two or more lasers and leading to time dependent terms such as those found in this case .",
    "we could use the same mathematics to solve a more complicated systems where the pump laser interacted resonantly with some transitions and off - resonantly with others , which were also coupled by the probe beam .",
    "we got consistent solutions for that system as well .",
    "using the method discussed in previous section , we numerically solve equation ( [ eq6 ] ) and obtain total susceptibility as @xmath69    since absorption and refractive index are related to @xmath70 as inverse beer length @xmath71 and @xmath72 respectively , we compute real and imaginary parts of @xmath73 to qualitatively study the atomic response .",
    "we present real and imaginary parts of @xmath70 as a function of probe rabi frequency @xmath51 , for different values of pump rabi frequency @xmath74 .",
    "we notice a pronounced nonlinear variation of both absorption and dispersion of the probe beam . for the graphs shown in figure 2 ,",
    "the pump beam is assumed to be resonant with the @xmath75 transition , while the probe beam is detuned by an amount which is thrice the transition linewidth @xmath76 .",
    "we do not yet understand why this precise value shows a maximum nonlinearity .",
    "perhaps the cause lies in the nature of different coherent superpositions that are formed for different values of @xmath23 and @xmath22 .",
    "the curves in figure 2 , which are labeled 1 to 5 , correspond to different values of @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "parts ( a ) and ( c ) show im@xmath70 , while parts ( b ) and ( d ) show corresponding variation in re@xmath70 . in all of them ,",
    "@xmath51 values on the ordinate range from a @xmath79 to 5.0 , i.e. , we investigate situations as @xmath51 ranges from a near - zero value , increasing upto becoming equal to @xmath74 and then increasing further .",
    "all values used for computation are normalized to the coherence decay @xmath76 .",
    "note that this susceptibility is calculated to first order in probe beam @xmath80 but to all orders in pump beam amplitude @xmath20 .",
    "note that each curve begins with a different value of @xmath73 , indicating that when @xmath51 is nearly zero , the value of @xmath73 depends only on @xmath74 .",
    "as @xmath51 is increased , value of @xmath73 is determined by instantaneous values of both @xmath74 and @xmath51 .",
    "for very large values of of @xmath51 , all curves asymptotically reach a single value of @xmath73 , irrespective of the @xmath74 value .",
    "in other words , when the two rabi frequencies differ by a large amount , the larger of the two determine the behaviour of @xmath73 .",
    "varying one of them with the other one fixed will show a behaviour of @xmath73 as seen in curves of figure 2 , indicating the competition between two rabi frequencies which control the behaviour .",
    "curve number 1 of figure 2a corresponds to @xmath81 , which is effectively a situation where only the probe laser is present .",
    "appropriately , this shows a saturation of probe absorption as @xmath51 is increased .",
    "curves 2 and 3 , with @xmath82 and @xmath83 respectively , show an increased absorption , which eventually saturates .",
    "surprisingly , increasing @xmath74 still further leads to reduced absorption , as shown by curves 4 and 5 of the same figure .",
    "the accompanying dispersion curves from figure 2 b show a corresponding behaviour .",
    "all the 5 curves asymptotically reach a saturation value of re @xmath84 .",
    "but curve 1 shows an early saturation behaviour as compared to others .",
    "curves 2 and 3 begin with an increased dispersion and eventually reach the saturation value , although at a much higher value of @xmath51 .",
    "increasing @xmath74 further , as shown by curves 4 and 5 , dispersion flips the sign and becomes negative throughout , eventually approaching zero asymptotically .",
    "this means that dispersion can be varied between negative and positive values by controlling @xmath74 , and thus a propagating probe pulse can be compressed or expanded dynamically .",
    "note that the absolute magnitude of re@xmath73 remains less than one , even when negative .",
    "therefore the refractive index remains positive for all values of @xmath51 .",
    "however , we can control the refractive index between values less than one and greater than one , by choosing appropriate value of @xmath74 .    plots of figure 2c and 2d show the data for same conditions except that a collisional decay rate of @xmath85 has been introduced .",
    "it is clearly seen that @xmath73 reaches its saturation value for a higher value of @xmath51 , than in case of no collisions .",
    "the numerical value of @xmath73 also significantly reduces , than its counterpart of no collision case .",
    "the qualitative behaviour of the variation , including the changes in sign of re@xmath73 , remains same .",
    "it has been shown that collisional processes destroy coherences formed and the laser that creates the coherence is required to be stronger in order to balance this loss @xcite .",
    "the effect seen here is similar , since it requires a stronger @xmath51 to saturate @xmath73 when collisions are present .",
    "this is an indication that the phenomena is indeed driven by atomic coherence , rather than mere optical pumping .",
    "we now look at the dressed states to understand the behaviour seen in above graphs .",
    "we can safely assume that whenever one of the two lasers are stronger than the other , it is the stronger laser which dresses the energy levels and the weaker laser probes the dressed atom .",
    "therefore , when @xmath86 , we look at the atom as it is dressed by @xmath74 laser . when @xmath87 , we look at the dressed states created by @xmath51 as probed by @xmath74 laser",
    ". complications arise only when both lasers are of comparable intensity when dressed states formed by both lasers together has to be taken into account . seen in this viewpoint",
    ", the graphs in figure 2 indicate the behaviour of the system as it traverses between different set of dressed states . in the beginning , when @xmath51 is small , the system is in dressed states of @xmath74 .",
    "as @xmath51 is increased , the system goes through a complex set of dressed states formed due to both @xmath51 and @xmath74 lasers and finally , reaches the dressed states of @xmath51 laser .",
    "intuitively , one can understand that for small values of @xmath51 , different values of @xmath74 form dressed eigenstates with different energies and hence the probe absorption is different .",
    "when @xmath51 reaches sufficiently high value , the dressed states formed by @xmath51 dominates and all atoms reach the cpt state formed by @xmath51 .",
    "thus the atoms are trapped and hence both absorption and dispersion reach a value of zero .    in the following section ,",
    "we look at the nature of the dressed states to substantiate this conclusion .",
    "we consider three separate cases , viz , ( i)@xmath88 , ( ii)@xmath89 and ( iii)@xmath90 , and analyze the dressed states in each of them .    *",
    "( i ) : @xmath88 : dressed states due to @xmath74 : * we compute semiclassical dressed states following @xcite .",
    "the complete hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) is diagonalized and the diagonalizing matrix is multiplied with the bare state vector to obtain the dressed states as a superposition of bare states .",
    "further , this configuration can be divided into two subconfigurations , viz .",
    ", a @xmath0 system formed by levels @xmath91 and a * v * system formed by @xmath92 ) @xmath93      also , @xmath96 . the levels @xmath97 and @xmath98 form a ladder of eigenstates , separated by a value equal to @xmath22 .",
    "there are nine possible coupling between these levels brought about by the probe laser , but only four of them have nonzero transition probabilities .",
    "quantum interferences causes cancellation of transition in other five cases , as explained by ( [ rules ] ) below      the level scheme , along with allowed transition is shown in figure 3 .",
    "it is evident from ( [ eigensystem1],[eigensystem2 ] ) , that the eigenvalues @xmath100 and @xmath101 , and hence the energy differences between them , depend upon value @xmath102 . in other words",
    ", different @xmath74 values will induce different energy shifts to the relevant energy levels and as a consequence , a probe beam coupling them will see different detunings .",
    "this will produce different values of @xmath73 as seen in figure 2 , in the regions of small @xmath51 .    *",
    "( ii ) : @xmath90 : dressed states due to @xmath51 : * the situation of @xmath51 being stronger than @xmath74 is similar to the one examined by petrosyan and coworkers @xcite and @xmath51 through the atom and show that this coupling strongly depends upon the zeeman shift of @xmath27 and @xmath103 states by an external magnetic field .",
    "we present a steady state , zero - field situation which is one of the limiting cases of our investigation ] . in absence of @xmath74 field ,",
    "the dressed state eigensystem is related to two two - level systems viz . , @xmath104 , given by @xmath105    the @xmath51 field does not couple @xmath106 transition .",
    "atoms that reach @xmath107 due to spontaneous emission from @xmath103 are therefore uncoupled from any radiation and are thus trapped in @xmath107 . however , such atoms are pumped out by @xmath74 laser , which couples @xmath108 transitions .",
    "these transitions are shown by solid lines of figure 4 .",
    "as @xmath51 is increased , the process of optically pumping the atom into the trap state @xmath107 dominates over the process of pumping it out by @xmath74 laser , and hence the probe absorption eventually reaches zero , as seen in figure 2 .",
    "* iii : @xmath109 : dressed states due to combined field : * in this condition it is hard to obtain analytical expression for the dressed states since the two fields are detuned from each other . only when both fields are on resonance with the atomic transition and hence @xmath110 , we can perform rotational transformation which eliminates time dependency in hamiltonian and hence analytically obtain eigenvalues      we can show that there exists a three - component cpt state for this configuration , given by @xmath112 identical to one found in reference @xcite .",
    "the probability amplitude for @xmath107 is seen to depend upon the ratio of rabi frequencies of the two lasers @xmath113 .",
    "on basis of this , it can be interpreted that the occupation probability of @xmath107 state under these conditions depend upon the relative strength of the two lasers . intuitively extending this to the situation when @xmath114",
    ", one can assume that the superposition state deviates only little from ( [ eigen_threelevel ] ) .",
    "in other words , the occupation probability of the state @xmath107 depends only on the relative intensities of the two lasers .    * the mixed states * : a study of tr(@xmath115 ) shows the distribution of atomic population among the different cpt states .",
    "figure 5 shows tr(@xmath115 ) as a function of @xmath52 , at different situations .",
    "the curves labeled 1 to 4 correspond to @xmath116 and @xmath117 .",
    "it can be noticed that tr(@xmath118 ) is close to 1.0 throughout when @xmath119 , denoting that all the atomic population is populating one pure state . as @xmath51 is increased , the value of tr(@xmath118 ) is exactly equal to 1.0 only at large values of @xmath120 , or when @xmath52 is exactly zero . for any values in between ,",
    "tr(@xmath118 ) deviates from 1.0 and the magnitude of this deviation depends upon value of @xmath51 .",
    "for all the data shown in figure 5 , @xmath22 is maintained at atomic resonance and @xmath23 is varied .",
    "the data implies that the atomic system is in a pure state when @xmath23 is far away from @xmath22 , which in other words is the situation of a largely detuned @xmath51 . in such cases",
    ", the resonant @xmath74 establishes a stronger coupling and hence traps the atom in its cpt state . on the other hand , when @xmath23 is exactly equal to @xmath22 , and both beams are on resonance , the atom is in the three component trap state ( [ eigen_threelevel ] ) .",
    "tr(@xmath118 ) being equal to 1.0 when @xmath110 , confirms this fact . for all values in between",
    ", tr@xmath121 indicates that the atom is in a mixed state , which means that the atomic population is distributed among many cpt states .    in figure 6 , we plot im@xmath73 as a function of @xmath52 . for each subset of graphs that are shown , @xmath74 is fixed and each curve corresponds to different @xmath51 , as described in figure caption . since the pump beam is kept at resonant , variation of @xmath52 is equivalent to changing the probe detuning .",
    "it can immediately be seen that for small values of @xmath74 , the probe absorption is a characteristic lorentzian function of probe detuning , as shown in figure 6 ( a ) .",
    "when the pump beam becomes stronger , as in figures 6(b ) and 6(c ) , the rabi splitting of levels due to dynamic stark shift and onset of electromagnetically induced transparency is noticed by presence of side bands and zero absorption for @xmath122 .",
    "it is now relevant to compare data shown in figure 6 with those in figure 2 .",
    "the corresponding situation of @xmath123 in figure 2 is equivalent to a point on the abscissa of figure 6 .",
    "increase of @xmath51 , as in data of figure 2 , is identical to a vertical line in figure 6 over which the point of investigation moves . it can immediately be noticed that as @xmath51 is increased , the peaks of i m @xmath73 curve traverse across this vertical line .",
    "since this peak shape and height also change across the curves of figure 6 , it is evident that the nonlinear i m @xmath73 seen in figure 2 originates in this traverse of peaks across the vertical line .    in conclusion ,",
    "we have studied an atomic response to a probe beam which varies nonlinearly with respect to the strength of probe beam .",
    "the exact trajectory of this variation can be controlled using a control beam .",
    "the control beam is polarized orthogonally to the probe beam and also propagates in a perpendicular direction .",
    "this allows a very easy control of the two beams without affecting each other .",
    "the atomic system , with two sets of degenerate triplets is often encountered in many alkali atoms . in short , this is a very simple and easy to use system which allows a critical control and nonlinear variation of atomic response .",
    "such critical control can have applications in a wide ranging areas of information processing , magnetometry etc .",
    "a precise control on the nonlinearity of @xmath73 will allow preparation and propagation of soliton pulses within the media as well .",
    "further , the phenomena also involves the atom being prepared in different cpt states .",
    "this property will be very useful in quantum computation where a faithful preparation of a state is required before performing computational operations on it .",
    "since these states are cpt states and constitute only ground states of the atom , such prepared states are robust against intensity fluctuations and decoherence .",
    "thus the state remains little affected till the quantum computation operations are preformed .",
    "preparations of such states also do not require precise pulse shaping techniques .",
    "we shall follow up with a work describing such state preparation in detail .",

    "<S> atomic response to a probe beam can be tailored , by creating coherences between atomic levels with help of another beam . </S>",
    "<S> changing parameters of the control beam will change the nature of coherences and hence the nature of atomic response as well . </S>",
    "<S> such change can depend upon intensity of both probe and control beams , in a nonlinear fashion . </S>",
    "<S> we present a situation where this nonlinearity in dependence can be precisely controlled , as to obtain different variations as desired . </S>",
    "<S> we also present a detailed analysis of how this nonlinear dependency arises and show that this is an interesting effect of several coherent population trap(cpt ) states that exist and a competition among them to trap atomic population in .    </S>",
    "<S> response of a material medium to an electromagnetic field usually exhibits a linear dependence on the intensity , at low intensities . when the intensity is sufficiently high , </S>",
    "<S> intensity dependant components of refractive index and absorption become dominant and the response of the material starts becoming increasingly nonlinear . while this is usually true for bulk medium , dilute atomic gases show a nonlinearity even at lower intensities . </S>",
    "<S> this is due to the fact that a near resonant laser prepares the atom in a coherent superposition of its energy levels . </S>",
    "<S> the response of an atom in such a superposition is not merely a sum of responses from the atom in its constituent states and can be dramatically different . </S>",
    "<S> thus , by creating a superposition state , a control laser can alter the behaviour of the atom towards a probe laser propagating through such a medium . </S>",
    "<S> such coherence induced control of an atomic response can also be interpreted as a coupling between photons of the control beam and those of the probe beam , giving us the same picture as in traditional nonlinear optics @xcite,@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although a nonlinear response at higher intensities is also observed , due to anharmonic interaction of the atom with the laser , the coherence induced nonlinearity is much more efficient since it happens at much lower intensities . </S>",
    "<S> this phenomena has found several applications such as achieving giant nonlinearities @xcite , efficient generation of of vacuum ultraviolet ( vuv ) using third harmonic@xcite , suppression of nonlinear responses @xcite , light induced focusing @xcite and many more . a fast variation of atomic response between a complete transparency to a complete opacity </S>",
    "<S> can also be achieved which would effectively make an optical switch using the medium @xcite .    a recent study @xcite experimentally investigates several @xmath0-like systems for dependency of atomic response on probe intensity and shows existence of a threshold intensity where linearity breaks down . on the other hand , we present a slightly different configuration in this paper which exhibits an almost completely nonlinear response </S>",
    "<S> further , this nonlinearity is precisely controllable , by manipulating the intensity and frequency of the pump beam . </S>",
    "<S> our configuration consists of two hyperfine states with quantum number f=1 and its zeeman manifolds , totally amounting to six levels . </S>",
    "<S> such a system is often encountered in atoms such as @xmath1rb or sodium , which is used in many atom - laser experiments . in other words </S>",
    "<S> , this is a familiar system which exhibits a sufficiently rich nonlinear response under appropriate conditions , as explained in this paper . </S>",
    "<S> we also present in detail the algorithm used to obtain numerical solutions which describe the dynamics of this system . due to involvement of two lasers of slightly differing frequencies , the most used method of transformation into a rotational frame will not eliminate explicit time - dependencies in the interaction hamiltonian and hence we resort to a continued fraction approach to solve them . </S>",
    "<S> this method , being non - perturbative in approach is valid for any intensities of pump and probe beams . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we are not confined to regimes of strong pump and weak probe alone , and are able to continuously investigate the behaviour of the atom as probe beam s intensity is increased from almost zero value to a value larger than that of the pump beam . augmenting the study with an analysis using semi - classical dressed states , we are able to show that the complex response shown by the atom is due to existence of many coherent population trap ( cpt ) states which compete with each other for atomic occupation .    </S>",
    "<S> cpt states are formed when superposition of atoms are prepared in such a superposition of its bare states , that the probability of transitions from each of its constituent states to a common external state cancel each other . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the atom can not absorb a photon to make a transition to the common external state is thus trapped @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , there may exist other states to which transitions not canceled , and the cpt state can be depopulated by using the appropriate laser . </S>",
    "<S> our configuration , due to existence of many degenerate levels , leads to formation of more than one cpt state . </S>",
    "<S> as the parameters of the lasers , such as frequency and intensity are scanned , the atoms are transferred from one cpt state to other . </S>",
    "<S> the rates of optically pumping the population to a particular cpt state or out of it depends upon the nature of the state . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , in the intermediate states , a competition between different cpt states manifests , as to trapping the population . </S>",
    "<S> this phenomena is observed as a variation in probe absorption and dispersion , which varies nonlinearly with variation of intensities of the beam , as shown in this paper . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the nature of nonlinear response shown to one of the beams can be modified by varying the detuning or intensity of the other beam involved . </S>",
    "<S> thus , a precise control over the nonlinearity is possible , which may have several applications in information processing using nonlinear properties of the medium .    this communication is divided into three parts . </S>",
    "<S> we describe the atomic configuration in detail in the following section , and also describe the method we have adopted to solve the density matrix equations . in the subsequent section , we present the results obtained under different conditions of pump and probe intensities . </S>",
    "<S> from this numerical results , we attempt an insight into the phenomena that occurs . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain the semiclassical dressed states in section iv and substantiate our conclusion of competition between different cpt states . </S>"
