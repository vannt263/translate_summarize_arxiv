    "one can define exotic atoms and nuclei , as systems in which one of the standard component particles is replaced by an exotic particle e.g. pionic atoms , where the negatively charged pion replaces an electron .",
    "the studies of exotic systems were proved to be very fruitful in the past , e.g. experiments on hypernuclei started a new branch of investigations - the strangess physics .",
    "more recently , studies of meson - nucleus interaction have attracted a lot of interest because they serves not only to better understand the meson - nucleon interaction but also provide information about meson properties embedded in nuclear matter , which are directly linked with the postulated partial restoration of the chiral symmetry and the structure of the qcd vacuum  @xcite . in general meson - nucleon binding is the result of an interplay of electromagnetic and strong forces but in the case of neutral mesons it is exclusively due to the strong interaction , thus the mesic nucleus can be considered as a meson captured in the mean field of the nucleons .",
    "the @xmath0-mesic nucleus is one of the most promising candidates for such a state because of the relatively strong @xmath0-nucleon interaction  @xcite . already in 1986 ,",
    "haider and liu postulated the hypothesis of a @xmath0-mesic nucleus  @xcite . since then many tries have been undertaken to experimentally confirm its existence but without any conclusive result .",
    "the search for the @xmath0-mesic bound states can be divided into two categories . in -",
    "direct search methods consist of study @xmath0 production cross - section right above the threshold to infer its subthreshold behaviour , and to establish binding conditions e.g. expressed as @xmath0-nucleus scattering length .",
    "although , such studies  @xcite provided important experimental indications in the case of @xmath4 and @xmath5 systems , where they showed the existence of a s - wave pole in the scattering matrix , they are not able to give the decisive answer whether the pole corresponds to a virtual or bound state as it was stated by  @xcite . the second category contains direct - search methods , which look for a subthreshold manifestation of a bound state in the excitation functions for chosen decay modes .",
    "this approach impose special experimental requirements e.g. very accurate knowledge of the total reaction energy , and good control over the luminosity and acceptance for consecutive energy bins .",
    "both aforementioned conditions are fulfilled with the wasa detector at cosy synchrotron .",
    "the wasa detection system  @xcite provide a high acceptance combined with the possiblity of registering all final state particles . also , we take advantage of the cosy synchrotoron ramped beam mode , which permits to smoothly change the beam momentum within one acceleration cycle , and in consequence to obtain an excellent reaction energy resolution .",
    "we carry out the search of a @xmath0-mesic helium produced in proton - deuteron and deuteron - deuteron collisions .",
    "we concentrate on the @xmath6 decay mode , in which the trapped @xmath0 meson is absorbed on one of the nucleons in the he nucleus .",
    "the nucleon is excited to the @xmath7 ( 1535 ) state , which subsequently decays into a pion - nucleon pair . in case of the @xmath8 channel ,",
    "the remaining three nucleons are likely to form a @xmath9he or @xmath9h nucleus .",
    "the outgoing @xmath10 nucleus is expected to have a relatively low momentum in the center of mass ( c.m . )",
    "frame that can be approximated by the fermi momentum distribution of the nucleons inside the @xmath11 nucleus .",
    "the process described above should result in a resonance - like structure in the excitation function of the @xmath12he@xmath13 and the @xmath12he@xmath14 reactions if we select events with low @xmath15he center - of - mass ( c.m . ) momenta .",
    "so far , three dedicated measurements were done with .",
    "the first experiment was performed in june 2008 by measuring the excitation function of the @xmath16 @xmath17 reaction near the @xmath0 meson production threshold .",
    "an upper limit for the formation and decay of the bound state in the process @xmath18 at the 90% confidence level , was determined from 20  nb to 27  nb for the bound state width ranging from 5  mev to 35  mev , respectively  @xcite . during the second experiment , in november 2010 ,",
    "two channels of the @xmath0-mesic helium decay were registered : @xmath19-@xmath20 @xmath21 and @xmath19-@xmath20 @xmath22 @xmath23  @xcite in the excess energy range from -70  mev to 30  mev .",
    "the preliminary excitation functions for the `` signal - rich '' region , corresponding to the low @xmath4 momenta c.m . frame , in which we expect the highest signal to noise ratio , are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : excit2 ] .    preliminary excitation function for the @xmath24 and for the @xmath2 reactions under condition that the @xmath4 momentum in c.m .",
    "frame is in the range from 0.1 to 0.25 gev / c ( `` signal - rich '' area ) .",
    "the distributions are not corrected for efficiency .",

    "frame is in the range from 0.1 to 0.25 gev / c ( `` signal - rich '' area ) .",
    "the distributions are not corrected for efficiency .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",width=207,height=188 ]    the predictions given in  @xcite , state a cross - section of 4.5 nb .",
    "this can be confronted with the expected sensitivity from the 2010 data , which is of the order of few nb .",
    "therefore , the ongoing analysis should be able to reveal the hypothetical signal from the decay of mesic nucleus in @xmath25 state .",
    "in may 2014 we carried out the third complementary experiment in proton deuteron collisions , aiming at the exploration of the @xmath26 mesic nuclei .",
    "this was motivated by the recent experimental and theoretical results  @xcite , which favor @xmath27 over @xmath28 bound states .",
    "in addition to the previously described decay mode via n@xmath29 resonance , we also considered a second mechanism , in which the bound @xmath0 decays , while still `` orbiting '' around a nucleus e.g. via @xmath30 ( @xmath26-@xmath31 reaction .",
    "although , the predicted cross - section for this decay mode is relatively small ( 0.4 nb  @xcite ) the background is expected to be highly supressed . a week - long measurement with an average luminosity of about 6@xmath32 @xmath33 s@xmath34 allowed to collect high statistics of data .",
