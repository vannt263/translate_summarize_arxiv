    "the top quark was discovered at the tevatron in 1995  @xcite . since then , many of its properties have been measured at the tevatron and the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "almost all of these seem to agree rather well with the standard model  @xcite . for a while ,",
    "the forward - backward asymmetry in @xmath1 production at the tevatron seemed to be much larger than predicted in the standard model  @xcite .",
    "however , in recent analyses , the discrepancy seems to have decreased considerably  @xcite .",
    "moreover , at the lhc , no deviation was observed at any stage in the analogous charge asymmetry observables  @xcite . at present , the top quark does seem to behave exactly as described in the standard model .",
    "nonetheless , the lhc , being a top - factory , affords us the opportunity to probe top properties further and also study rare processes involving the top .",
    "one such process is the decay @xmath0 .",
    "the dominant decay modes of the top involve @xmath2 , with the @xmath3 then decaying to @xmath4 , @xmath5 or @xmath6 .",
    "the decay @xmath0 would arise if @xmath7 . however , this decay is extremely suppressed in the standard model as it is proportional to @xmath8 ( @xmath9 = 0.04 being one of the elements of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa matrix ) . new physics contributions to this decay",
    ", if present , can be parametrized in terms of the following effective lagrangian : @xmath10 where @xmath11 { \\cal l}_{eff}^t   \\ ; & = \\ ;   4\\sqrt{2}g_f v_{cb}v_{tb } \\big\\ { x^t_{ll } \\ ; ( \\bar b \\sigma^{\\mu\\nu } p_l t ) \\ ; ( \\bar c \\sigma_{\\mu\\nu } p_l b )   \\ ; + \\ ; x^t_{rr } \\ ; ( \\bar b \\sigma^{\\mu\\nu } p_r t ) \\ ; ( \\bar c \\sigma_{\\mu\\nu } p_r b ) \\ ,   \\big \\ } \\ ; + \\ ; h.c.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the above , the colour indices have been suppressed but they are assumed to contract in the same manner as in the standard model .    at the lhc , the largest number of top quarks are produced through the process @xmath12 .",
    "the decays of these tops and antitops can then be investigated for signs of new physics .",
    "the large production cross - section compensates for the small branching fraction such that a statistical analysis remains feasible .",
    "moreover , as shown in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , angular correlations between @xmath13 and @xmath14 decay products also carry the imprint of new physics .",
    "for the purposes of this analysis , it is assumed that the @xmath13 decays to @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , while the @xmath14 decays to a @xmath16 , a charged lepton and an antineutrino .",
    "the square of the matrix element for the process @xmath18 is calculated in ref .",
    "it is seen that all new - physics dependence in @xmath19 can be parametrized in terms of certain combinations @xmath20 of the couplings @xmath21 given by @xmath22 % \\hat{a}_{\\bar b}^-   \\quad & = \\quad 4\\left|x^{v}_{rr}\\right|^2 - 8 \\,\\mbox{re}\\left(x^t_{rr}x^{s*}_{rr}\\right)+32 \\left|x^t_{rr}\\right|^2 \\ , , \\\\[0.5ex ] % \\hat{a}_{b}^+   \\quad & = \\quad \\left|x^{s}_{ll}\\right|^2+\\left|x^{s}_{lr}\\right|^2 -16\\left|x^{t}_{ll}\\right|^2 \\ , , \\\\[0.5ex ] % \\hat{a}_{b}^-   \\quad & = \\quad   \\left|x^{s}_{rr}\\right|^2+\\left|x^{s}_{rl}\\right|^2 -16\\left|x^{t}_{rr}\\right|^2 \\ , , \\\\[0.5ex ] % \\hat{a}_{c}^+   \\quad & = \\quad   4\\left|x^{v}_{lr}\\right|^2 + 8 \\,\\mbox{re}\\left(x^t_{ll}x^{s*}_{ll}\\right)+32\\left|x^t_{ll}\\right|^2 \\ , , \\\\[0.5ex ] % \\hat{a}_{c}^-   \\quad & = \\quad 4\\left|x^{v}_{rl}\\right|^2 + 8 \\,\\mbox{re}\\left(x^t_{rr}x^{s*}_{rr}\\right)+32\\left|x^t_{rr}\\right|^2 \\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in fact , as discussed in ref .",

    "iii b 3 ) , this is true even for @xmath23 .",
    "if the @xmath13 decay contains contributions from new physics , then , several observables related to the decay products get affected .",
    "of these , two turn out to be specially useful .",
    "these are    1 .",
    "@xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the momenta of two out of the three particles coming from the top decay .",
    "@xmath28 where @xmath29 is the angle between the direction of the @xmath30 decay product of the @xmath13 and the spin quantization axis of the @xmath13 in the @xmath13 rest frame , and @xmath31 is the angle between the direction of the @xmath32 and the spin quantization axis of the @xmath14 in the @xmath14 rest frame .",
    "the detailed expressions for these for different choices of @xmath33 and @xmath34 can be found in ref .",
    "[ fig : observables ] shows the normalised distributions for @xmath35 and @xmath36 for a particular choice of new - physics couplings .",
    "it clearly demonstrates the discriminating power of these observables even for cases where the new - physics couplings are not large .",
    "that is not all . @xmath37 and @xmath38 form a set of six differential distributions , each dependent on a different combination , there is also some additional dependence on re(@xmath39 ) . ]",
    "of the six @xmath20 s . by performing a simultaneous fit to all six distributions ,",
    "it is possible to extract the values of these @xmath20 s .",
    "@xcite discusses the detailed procedure for carrying out this exercise . in the absence of actual data in this channel ,",
    "monte carlo data generated using madgraph 5  @xcite is used to test and establish the algorithm .",
    "the model files for madgraph have , in turn , been generated using feynrules  @xcite .",
    "the crux of the idea is as follows .",
    "each of @xmath37 and @xmath38 gives a histogram .",
    "in general , each histogram @xmath40 can be written as @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the histogram @xmath40 for the standard model and other @xmath43 s represent same histogram @xmath40 with @xmath20 and re(@xmath39 ) = @xmath44 , one at a time .",
    "in essence , one only needs to determine the weights @xmath45 that best reproduce the data .",
    "the distributions @xmath38 are , in fact , closely related to the @xmath46 spin correlations . in the standard model , @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the spin correlation coefficient and the factors @xmath49 and",
    "@xmath50 depend on the identity of the particles @xmath33 and @xmath51 .",
    "since the @xmath1 pair decays instantly , the spin correlation coefficient is inferred by fitting this distribution to the functional form @xmath52 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath53 contains @xmath48 . in the presence of new physics ,",
    "this distribution gets modified to the form @xmath54 where @xmath55 is a different function of the @xmath20 s for @xmath56 .",
    "if the value of the spin correlation coefficient were to be inferred from this now , it would yield @xmath57 .",
    "there is , however , a caveat in all of this .",
    "note that the final state contains two @xmath16 s . in order to construct the aforementioned observables , the @xmath16 coming from the @xmath13-decay has to be ` correctly ' identified . here and in ref .",
    "@xcite , the @xmath16 that yields the smaller value of @xmath58 is taken to be the one arising from the @xmath13-decay .",
    "if both @xmath16 s yield nearly identical values of @xmath59 , the event is discarded .",
    "this ` cut ' modifies the shape of the angular correlations such that it is no longer possible to fit them to the functional form @xmath52 or any simple modification of it .",
    "nonetheless , the histogram fitting described in the previous section works just as well since the same ` cut ' is applied to the data ( @xmath40 ) as well as the templates ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "a full fit to all six observables is performed using monte carlo data with statistics corresponding to an integrated luminosity @xmath60 300 fb@xmath61 for 14 tev collisions at the lhc .",
    "different new - physics scenarios corresponding to different choices of the @xmath21 s are examined .",
    "the values of @xmath20 are recovered to within @xmath62 1.7@xmath63 of their input values .",
    "if only the @xmath64 distributions are measured , the values of ( @xmath65 ) , ( @xmath66 ) and ( @xmath67 ) can still be determined .",
