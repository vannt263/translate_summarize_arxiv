    "in this paper we consider the following subclass of holant problems  @xcite .",

    "the function @xmath3 takes 0 - 1 inputs from its incident nodes and outputs arbitrary values in @xmath4 .",
    "the problem is to compute the quantity @xmath5 .",
    "holant problems are a natural class of counting problems .",
    "as introduced in  @xcite , the general holant problem framework can encode all counting constraint satisfaction problems ( # csp ) .",
    "this includes special cases such as weighted vertex cover , graph colorings , matchings , and perfect matchings .",
    "the subclass of holant problems in this paper can also be considered as ( weighted ) @xmath6-homomorphism ( or @xmath6-coloring ) problems  @xcite with an arbitrary @xmath7 symmetric complex matrix @xmath6 , however _ restricted to _ regular graphs @xmath8 as input . e.g. , vertex cover is the case when @xmath9 } $ ] . when the matrix @xmath6 is a 0 - 1 matrix , it is called unweighted . dichotomy theorems (",
    "i.e. , the problem is either in @xmath10 or # p - hard , depending on @xmath6 ) for unweighted @xmath6-homomorphisms with undirected graphs @xmath6 and directed acyclic graphs @xmath6 are given in @xcite and @xcite respectively . a dichotomy theorem for any symmetric matrix @xmath6 with non - negative real entries is proved in  @xcite .",

    "@xcite proved a dichotomy theorem for all real symmetric matrices @xmath6 .",
    "finally , cai , chen , and lu have proved a dichotomy theorem for all complex symmetric matrices @xmath6  @xcite .    the crucial difference between holant problems and # csp is that in # csp , equality functions of arbitrary arity are _ presumed _ to be present . in terms of @xmath6-homomorphism problems",
    ", this means that the input graph is allowed to have vertices of arbitrarily high degrees .",
    "this may appear to be a minor distinction ; in fact it has a major impact on complexity .",
    "it turns out that if equality gates of arbitrary arity are freely available in possible inputs then it is technically easier to prove # p - hardness .",
    "proofs of previous dichotomy theorems make extensive use of constructions called thickening and stretching .",
    "these constructions require the availability of equality gates of arbitrary arity ( equivalently , vertices of arbitrarily high degrees ) to carry out .",
    "proving # p - hardness becomes more challenging in the degree restricted case .",
    "furthermore there are indeed cases within this class of counting problems where the problem is # p - hard for general graphs , but solvable in @xmath10 when restricted to 3-regular graphs .",
    "we denote the ( symmetric ) edge function @xmath3 by @xmath11 $ ] , where @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "functions will also be called gates or signatures . ( for vertex cover , the function corresponding to @xmath6 is the or gate , and is denoted by the signature @xmath15 $ ] . ) in this paper we give a dichotomy theorem for the complexity of holant problems on 3-regular graphs with arbitrary signature @xmath16 $ ] , where @xmath17 . first , if @xmath18 , the holant problem is easily solvable in @xmath10 .",
    "assuming @xmath19 we may normalize @xmath3 and assume @xmath20 .",
    "our main theorem is as follows :    [ thm : main - intro ] suppose @xmath21 , and let @xmath22 , @xmath23 .",
    "then the holant problem on 3-regular graphs with @xmath24 $ ] is # p - hard except in the following cases , for which the problem is in @xmath10 .",
    "1 .   @xmath25 .",
    "2 .   @xmath26 .",
    "3 .   @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "4 .   @xmath27 and @xmath29 .",
    "if we restrict the input to planar 3-regular graphs , then these four categories are solvable in @xmath10 , as well as a fifth category @xmath30 .",
    "the problem remains # p - hard in all other cases .",
    "these results can be extended to @xmath31-regular graphs ( we detail how this is accomplished in a forthcoming work ) .",
    "one can also use holographic reductions  @xcite to extend this theorem to more general holant problems .    in order to achieve this result ,",
    "some new proof techniques are introduced . to discuss this",
    "we first take a look at some previous results .",
    "valiant  @xcite introduced the powerful technique of _ interpolation _ , which was further developed by many others . in @xcite a dichotomy theorem is proved for the case when @xmath3 is a boolean function .",
    "the technique from @xcite is to provide certain algebraic criteria which ensure that _ interpolation _ succeeds , and then apply these criteria to prove that ( a large number yet ) finitely many individual problems are # p - hard .",
    "this involves ( a small number of ) gadget constructions , and the algebraic criteria are powerful enough to show that they succeed in each case .",
    "nonetheless this involves a case - by - case verification . in  @xcite this theorem is extended to all real - valued @xmath32 and @xmath33 , and we have to deal with infinitely many problems .",
    "so instead of focusing on one problem , we devised ( a large number of ) recursive gadgets and analyzed the regions of @xmath34 where they fail to prove # p - hardness .",
    "the algebraic criteria from @xcite are not suitable ( galois theoretic ) for general @xmath32 and @xmath33 , and so we formulated weaker but simpler criteria .",
    "using these criteria , the analysis of the failure set becomes expressible as containment of semi - algebraic sets .",
    "as semi - algebraic sets are decidable , this offers the ultimate possibility that _ if _ we found enough gadgets to prove # p - hardness , _ then _ there is a _ computational _ proof ( of computational intractability ) in a finite number of steps .",
    "however this turned out to be a tremendous undertaking in symbolic computation , and many additional ideas were needed to finally carry out this plan .",
    "in particular , it would seem hopeless to extend that approach to all complex @xmath32 and @xmath33 .    in this paper",
    ", we introduce three new ideas .",
    "( 1 ) we introduce a method to construct gadgets that carry out iterations at a higher dimension , and then collapse to a lower dimension for the purpose of constructing unary signatures .",
    "this involves a starter gadget , a recursive iteration gadget , and a finisher gadget .",
    "we prove a lemma that guarantees that among polynomially many iterations , some subset of them satisfies properties sufficient for interpolation to succeed ( it may not be known _ a priori _ which subset worked , but that does not matter ) .",
    "( 2 ) eigenvalue shifted pairs are coupled pairs of gadgets whose transition matrices differ by @xmath35 where @xmath36 .",
    "they have shifted eigenvalues , and by analyzing their failure conditions , we can show that except on very rare points , one or the other gadget succeeds .",
    "( 3 ) algebraic symmetrization .",
    "we derive a new expression of the holant polynomial over 3-regular graphs , with a crucially reduced degree .",
    "this simplification of the holant and related polynomials condenses the problem of proving @xmath37-hardness to the point where all remaining cases can be handled by symbolic computation .",
    "we also use the same expression to prove tractability .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section [ background ]",
    "we discuss notation and background information . in section [ interpolation ]",
    "we cover interpolation techniques , including how to collapse higher dimensional iterations to interpolate unary signatures . in section [ complexsignatures ]",
    "we show how to perform algebraic symmetrization of the holant , and introduce eigenvalue shifted pairs ( esp ) of gadgets .",
    "then we combine the new techniques to prove theorem  [ thm : main - intro ] .",
    "we state the counting framework more formally . a _ signature grid _ @xmath38 consists of a labeled graph @xmath39 where @xmath40 labels each vertex @xmath41 with a function @xmath42 .",
    "we consider all edge assignments @xmath43 ; @xmath44 takes inputs from its incident edges @xmath45 at @xmath46 and outputs values in @xmath4 .",
    "the counting problem on the instance @xmath47 is to compute @xmath48    suppose @xmath8 is a bipartite graph @xmath49 such that each @xmath50 has degree 2 .",
    "furthermore suppose each @xmath41 is labeled by an equality gate @xmath51 where @xmath52 .",
    "then any non - zero term in @xmath53 corresponds to a 0 - 1 assignment @xmath54 .",
    "in fact , we can merge the two incident edges at @xmath50 into one edge @xmath55 , and label this edge @xmath55 by the function @xmath56 .",
    "this gives an edge - labeled graph @xmath57 where @xmath58 .",
    "for an edge - labeled graph @xmath57 where @xmath59 has label @xmath60 , @xmath61 .",
    "if each @xmath60 is the same function @xmath3 ( but assignments @xmath62 $ ] take values in a finite set @xmath63 $ ] ) this is exactly the @xmath6-coloring problem ( for undirected graphs @xmath3 is a symmetric function ) .",
    "in particular , if @xmath49 is a @xmath64-regular bipartite graph , equivalently @xmath65 is a @xmath31-regular graph , then this is the @xmath6-coloring problem restricted to @xmath31-regular graphs . in this paper",
    "we will discuss 3-regular graphs , where each @xmath60 is the same symmetric complex - valued function .",
    "we also remark that for general bipartite graphs @xmath49 , giving equality ( of various arities ) to all vertices on one side @xmath66 defines # csp as a special case of holant problems . but whether equality of various arities are present has a major impact on complexity , thus holant problems are a refinement of # csp .",
    "a symmetric function @xmath67 can be denoted as @xmath68 $ ] , where @xmath69 is the value of @xmath3 on inputs of hamming weight @xmath70 .",
    "they are also called _",

    "note that @xmath75 $ ] and @xmath76 $ ] are equality gates @xmath77 and @xmath78 respectively , and the main dichotomy theorem in this paper is about @xmath79 \\mid [ 1,0,0,1]$ ] , for all @xmath80 .",
    "we will also denote @xmath81 \\mid [ 1,0,0,1]$ ] . more generally , if @xmath82 and @xmath83 are sets of signatures , and vertices of @xmath84 ( resp .",
    "@xmath66 ) are labeled by signatures from @xmath82 ( resp .",
    "@xmath83 ) , then we also use @xmath85 to denote the bipartite holant problem .",
    "signatures in @xmath82 are called _ generators _ and signatures in @xmath83 are called _",
    "recognizers_. this notation is particularly convenient when we perform holographic transformations . throughout this paper ,",
    "all @xmath71-regular bipartite graphs are arranged with generators on the degree 2 side and recognizers on the degree 3 side .",
    "we use @xmath86 to denote the principal value of the complex argument ; i.e. , @xmath87 $ ] for all nonzero @xmath88 .",
    "any signature from @xmath89 is available at a vertex as part of an input graph . instead of a single vertex",
    ", we can use graph fragments to generalize this notion .",
    "an @xmath89-gate @xmath90 is a pair @xmath91 , where @xmath92 is a graph with some dangling edges @xmath93 ( figure [ examplegadgets ] contains some examples ) .",
    "other than these dangling edges , an @xmath89-gate is the same as a signature grid .",
    "the role of dangling edges is similar to that of external nodes in valiant s notion  @xcite , however we allow more than one dangling edge for a node . in @xmath94",
    "each node is assigned a function in @xmath89 ( we do not consider `` dangling '' leaf nodes at the end of a dangling edge among these ) , @xmath95 are the regular edges , and @xmath93 are the dangling edges",
    ". then we can define a function for this @xmath89-gate @xmath96 , @xmath97 where @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 denotes an assignment on the dangling edges , and @xmath101 denotes the value of the partial signature grid on an assignment of all edges , i.e. , the product of evaluations at every vertex of @xmath6 , for @xmath102 .    we will also call this function the signature of the @xmath89-gate @xmath90 . an @xmath89-gate can be used in a signature grid as if it is just a single node with the same signature .",
    "we note that even for a very simple signature set @xmath89 , the signatures for all @xmath89-gates can be quite complicated and expressive .",
    "matchgate signatures are an example  @xcite .    the dangling edges of an @xmath103-gate are considered as input or output variables .",
    "any @xmath104-input @xmath105-output @xmath103-gate can be viewed as a @xmath106 by @xmath107 matrix @xmath108 which transforms arity-@xmath104 signatures into arity-@xmath105 signatures ( this is true even if @xmath104 or @xmath105 are 0 ) .",
    "our construction will transform symmetric signatures to symmetric signatures .",
    "this implies that there exists an equivalent @xmath109 by @xmath110 matrix @xmath111 which operates directly on column vectors written in symmetric signature notation .",
    "we will henceforth identify the matrix @xmath111 with the @xmath103-gate itself .",
    "the constructions in this paper are based upon three different types of bipartite @xmath103-gates which we call _ starter gadgets _",

    "for any such @xmath32 and @xmath33 , we know by lemma [ condition0 ] that either gadget 10 or 11 has a recurrence matrix with nonzero eigenvalues of distinct norm , except in the following cases , where we will use other gadgets to fill this requirement .",
    "if @xmath509 then @xmath438 , lest @xmath301 and @xmath302 be real , so lemma [ condition2 ] implies that unary gadget 12 has a recurrence matrix of the required form . if @xmath317 , then lemma [ condition3 ] indicates that either gadget 11 or gadget 13 satisfies the requirement , unless @xmath510 .",
    "now we may assume @xmath391 , so by lemmas [ condition4part1 ] and [ condition4part2 ] if @xmath465 then either unary gadget 13 , 14 , 15 , or 16 has a suitable recurrence matrix . in any case",
    ", we have a unary recursive gadget whose recurrence matrix has nonzero eigenvalues of distinct norm .",
    "hence we are done by theorem [ mainunary ] and lemma [ mainlemma2 ] .",
    "recall vertex cover is @xmath37-hard on 3-regular planar graphs , and note that all gadgets discussed are planar ( in the case of gadget 8 , each iteration can be redrawn in a planar way by `` going around '' the previous iterations ; see figure [ iteration ] ) .",
    "thus , all of the hardness results proved so far still apply even when the input graphs are restricted to planar graphs .",
    "there are , however , some problems that are @xmath37-hard in general , yet polynomial time computable when the input is restricted to planar graphs .",
    "this class of problems corresponds exactly with the problems we still need to resolve at this point , i.e. when @xmath511 but @xmath512 .",
    "the relevant interpolation results can be obtained with gadget 4 and holographic reductions , using a technique demonstrated in @xcite .",
    "if @xmath515 then this is already known @xcite , and a polynomial time algorithm for @xmath516 is in @xcite . now assume @xmath517 and @xmath518 .",
    "since these problems have an extra degree of symmetry , we use a 2 by 2 recurrence matrix to describe the recursive construction which consists of a single - vertex starter gadget ( figure [ startergadget ] ) followed by some number of applications of binary recursive gadget 4 ( no finisher gadget is used here ) .",
    "that is , if @xmath103-gate @xmath519 has signature @xmath520 $ ] , then the signature of @xmath521 is given by @xmath522 $ ] where @xmath523^\\mathrm{t } = m [ a_i , b_i]^\\mathrm{t}$ ] , and @xmath524 $ ] .",
    "now , @xmath525 and @xmath526 are both nonzero under our assumptions",
    ". it can be verified ( using the resolve function of mathematica@xmath291 ) that @xmath527 provided that @xmath517 , so by lemma [ relaxedunary ] , the eigenvalues of @xmath108 have distinct norm . also , @xmath528 = ( a+1)\\left[\\begin{array}{c } a(a^2-a+2 ) \\\\ ( 2a^2-a+1 ) \\end{array}\\right]$ ] , so the starter gadget is not an eigenvector of @xmath108 .",
    "we conclude by an analogous version of lemma [ unaryconstruction ] that we can interpolate all signatures of the form @xmath529 $ ] , and since @xmath530 \\mid [ 0,1,1,0]$ ] is known to be @xmath37-hard @xcite and equivalent to @xmath531 \\mid [ 1,0,0,1]$ ] by holographic reduction ( where @xmath532 is the principal 12@xmath533 root of unity ) , we conclude that @xmath513 \\mid [ 1,0,0,1]$ ] is @xmath37-hard .      if @xmath535 then @xmath333 and the problem is in p by theorem [ tractable ] .",
    "otherwise , @xmath536 , let @xmath537 , and applying a holographic reduction to @xmath538 \\mid [ 1,0,0,1]$ ] under the basis @xmath539 $ ] we see that the problem @xmath540 \\mid [ 1,0,0,1]$ ] is equivalent to @xmath541 \\mid [ 1,0,0,1]$ ] , because @xmath542 .",
    "since @xmath543 , we can apply lemma [ abequal ] and the problem @xmath538 \\mid [ 1,0,0,1]$ ] is in p if @xmath544 and @xmath37-hard otherwise .",
