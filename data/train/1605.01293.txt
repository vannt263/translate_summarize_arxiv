    "in this paper we consider the dynamic evolution of the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process ( tasep ) in both uniform and non - uniform one - dimensional ( 1d ) systems .",
    "the tasep , in its original version for uniform chains , already exhibits many non - trivial properties including flow phase changes , because of its collective character  @xcite , and is considered paradigmatic of non - equilibrium statistical mechanical models .",
    "we make use of the domain - wall ( dw ) approach  @xcite , coupled with numerical simulations .",
    "application of mean - field ( mf ) mobius mapping  @xcite to generalizations of the tasep such as non - uniform chains and hexagonal - lattice systems turns out to provide less accurate steady state results than for the well - known uniform 1d case . and",
    "for dynamics  @xcite , some significant discrepancies between mf predictions and numerics already arise for uniform 1d systems .",
    "such inadequacies motivate the formulation of a dw theory ( which includes fluctuations altogether absent in mf ) to provide further understanding of the physical processes underlying this model .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : theo ] we review the dw theory for uniform chains , and develop a generalization which applies for 1d systems with alternating bond rates . in sec .",

    "thus , @xmath9    the `` open '' chain with additional processes ( subject to the exclusion constraint ) of injection at rate @xmath10 at the left boundary , and ejection at rate @xmath11 at the right boundary is of particular interest , because of its rich behavior , including boundary - driven phase transitions and associated static and dynamic critical behavior .",
    "its properties , particularly densities , currents , and associated correlation functions , will be studied in what follows .",
    "one such property is the density profile @xmath12 given by the average of occupations at site @xmath1 and time @xmath13 , over all possible realizations of the evolution up to time @xmath13 .",
    "in general such quantities evolve in time towards an eventual steady - state form which , for the open chain , depends on the boundary conditions through @xmath10 , @xmath11 , but not on initial conditions .    the simplest approach , mf theory  @xcite , already distinguishes the different phases , through current and density averages and especially through the forms of the density profile .",
    "remarkably mf theory gives the phase boundaries in the ( @xmath14 ) plane exactly for the uniform chain  @xcite .",
    "a particular example of an mf steady state density profile is that for @xmath15 , corresponding to the coexistence line in the low current phase .",

[ fig : nsp_abclp ] ) that the limiting gap value is of the same order of magnitude as predicted by theory , apart from a factor of order @xmath57 at most .    before concluding , some further points merit discussion here .",
    "the main one concerns length and time scales . for the applicability of the macroscopic view underlying the dw approach one needs an appropriate separation and ordering of such scales , particularly length scales ( system size , domain size , domain wall width , and lattice spacing ) .",
    "such requirements are typically well satisfied in the uniform chain systems investigated here . but for the staggered chains the two - sublattice feature makes them questionable",
    ". this may well be the basic reason for the imperfect dw account of this case .",
