    "we studied this energy distribution as a function of angle @xmath5 in the detector in the region not too near to the direction @xmath3 . in this region , simple qcd perturbation theory is applicable , and we presented calculations at order @xmath1 . in this paper , we extend the analysis to the region of @xmath5 near to @xmath3 . here",
    ", multiple soft gluon radiation is important .",
    "thus we use a summation of perturbation theory .",
    "there is extensive literature on semi - inclusive deeply inelastic scattering ; a brief history and complete set of references can be found in paper  i. we begin here with a concise review of how the energy distribution function is defined , and then discuss how we sum the contributions that are important in the region @xmath6 to obtain a result which is valid for all values of @xmath5 .",
    "the reaction that we study is @xmath7 at the hera electron - proton collider .",
    "let us describe the particles by their energies and angles in the hera laboratory frame , with the positive z - axis chosen in the direction of the proton beam and the negative z - axis in the direction of the electron beam .",
    "in completely inclusive deeply inelastic scattering , one measures only @xmath8 and @xmath9 , the energy and angle of the scattered electron . in the semi - inclusive case studied in this paper ,",
    "one also measures some basic features of the hadronic final state . in principle",
    ", one can measure the energy @xmath10 and the angles @xmath5 of the outgoing hadron b. however , it is much simpler to perform a purely calorimetric measurement , in which only the total energy coming into a calorimeter cell at angles @xmath5 is measured .",
    "this calorimetric measurement gives the energy distribution @xmath11 the sum runs over all species of produced hadrons b. we have included a factor @xmath12 in the definition because this factor is part of the lorentz invariant dot product @xmath13 .",
    "notice that @xmath14 measures the distribution of energy in the final state as a function of angle without asking how that energy is split into individual hadrons moving in the same direction . for this reason , the theoretical expression for",
    "@xmath14 will not involve parton decay functions that describe how partons decay into hadrons .      at the born level",
    ", the hard scattering process for the reaction is @xmath15 by means of virtual photon or @xmath16 exchange . at order @xmath1",
    ", one can have virtual corrections to the born graph .",
    "in addition , one can have processes in which there are two scattered partons in the final state .",
    "then the initial parton can be either a quark ( or antiquark ) or a gluon , while the observed hadron can come from the decay of either of the final state partons .",
    "some of these possibilities are illustrated in , , and .",
    "let us consider the effect of the emission of the additional , unobserved , `` bremsstrahlung '' parton .",
    "we can define the part of the vector boson momentum @xmath17 that is transverse to the momentum of the incoming hadron @xmath18 and to the momentum of the outgoing hadron @xmath19 .",
    "one merely subtracts from @xmath17 its projections along @xmath18 and @xmath19 ( taking @xmath20 ) , @xmath21 we let @xmath22^{1/2}$ ] represent the magnitude of the transverse momentum .",
    "it is @xmath0 that is analogous to the transverse momentum of produced w s and z s or lepton pairs in the drell yan process . in the naive parton model ,",
    "there are no bremsstrahlung partons and all parton momenta are exactly collinear with the corresponding hadron momenta , so one has @xmath23 . at order @xmath1",
    ", unobserved parton emission allows @xmath0 to be nonzero .    in order to properly describe the parton kinematics we need four more variables besides @xmath0 .",
    "two are the standard variables for deeply inelastic scattering , @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "the third is a momentum fraction for the outgoing hadron @xmath26 , @xmath27 ( thus the integration over the energy of hadron @xmath26 in definition  ( [ eq : edist ] ) of the energy distribution is equivalent to an integration over @xmath28 . )",
    "the fourth variable is an azimuthal angle @xmath29 . to define @xmath29",
    ", we choose a frame , called the hadron frame , , in which the incoming hadron @xmath30 has its three - momentum @xmath31 along the positive @xmath28-axis and the virtual photon four - momentum @xmath32 lies along the negative @xmath28-axis .",
    "then as long as @xmath33 , hadron @xmath26 has some transverse momentum , and we align the @xmath34- and @xmath35-axes so that @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "we now define @xmath29 as the azimuthal angle of the incoming lepton in the hadron frame .",
    "these variables are described more fully in paper  i , and relevant formulas are given in the appendix of this paper .",
    "the variables @xmath0 and @xmath29 can be translated to the observables of the hera lab frame , . in the naive parton model , the outgoing hadron @xmath26 (",
    "along with all the other hadrons arising from the decay of the struck quark ) emerges in the plane defined by the incoming and outgoing electrons at a precisely defined angle @xmath3 , which can be computed from the incoming particle momenta and the momentum of the scattered electron .",
    "the point @xmath23 corresponds to @xmath38 .",
    "we choose our @xmath34-axis such that @xmath39 .",
    "lines of constant positive @xmath0 are curves in the @xmath5 plane that encircle the point @xmath3 . lines of constant @xmath29 radiate out of the point @xmath3 , crossing the lines of constant @xmath0 .",
    "this is illustrated in .",
    "the precise formulas for the map relating @xmath5 and @xmath40 are given in the appendix .    in paper",
    "i and in this paper , we find it convenient to convert from the laboratory frame variables @xmath41 of the scattered lepton and @xmath42 of the observed hadron to @xmath43 for the lepton and @xmath44 for the observed hadron .",
    "we also convert from @xmath10 to @xmath28 . with this change of variables ,",
    "becomes @xmath45      the main object of study in this paper is the distribution of energy as a function of @xmath0 for @xmath46 . in paper",
    "i , we applied straightforward perturbation theory to analyze the energy distribution in the region @xmath47 , and @xmath48 . here there is a rich structure as a function of the angles that relate the hadron momenta to the lepton momenta .",
    "in fact , a complete description requires nine structure functions .",
    "when one examines the region @xmath46 , one finds that the angular structure simplifies greatly .",
    "however , the dependence on @xmath0 becomes richer than the dependence on @xmath0 of the lowest order graphs . by summing the most important parts of graphs at arbitrarily high order ,",
    "one finds a structure that is sensitive to the fact that qcd is a gauge theory .",
    "briefly , the physical picture is as follows . at the born level of deeply inelastic scattering ,",
    "a quark in the incoming proton enters the scattering with momentum @xmath49 that is precisely along the beam axis .",
    "this quark is scattered by a virtual photon , @xmath50- or @xmath51-boson .",
    "its momentum @xmath52 is in a direction @xmath3 that can be reconstructed by knowing the lepton momenta .",
    "however at higher orders of perturbation theory , the momentum of the final state parton is @xmath53 where the @xmath54 are momenta of gluons that emitted in the process . in a renormalizable field theory ,",
    "it is very easy to emit gluons that are nearly collinear to either the initial or final parton directions .",
    "in addition , in a gauge theory such as qcd , it is very easy to emit gluons that are soft ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "each gluon emission displaces @xmath0 by a small amount , so that one may think of the parton as undergoing a random walk in the space of transverse momenta . with one gluon emission ,",
    "one finds a cross section that is singular as @xmath56 : @xmath57 at order @xmath58 the @xmath59 singularity is multiplied by a polynomial in @xmath60 of order @xmath61 .",
    "this series sums to a function of @xmath62 that is peaked at @xmath63 but is not singular there .",
    "the width of this distribution is much bigger than the @xmath64 that one would guess based on experience with soft hadronic physics .",
    "on the other hand the width is quite small compared to the hard momentum scale @xmath65 .",
    "essentially this same physics has been studied in the two crossed versions of the process @xmath66 that can be studied at hera . in electron - positron annihilation ,",
    "@xmath67 , one looks at the energy - energy correlation function for hadrons @xmath30 and @xmath26 nearly back - to - back . in @xmath68 ,",
    "one studies the distribution of the lepton pair as a function of its transverse momentum @xmath62 with respect to the beam axis .",
    "the same analysis applies also to the distribution of the transverse momentum of @xmath51 or @xmath50 bosons produced in hadron colliders .    from these studies ,",
    "the following picture emerges .",
    "first , the leading logs ( @xmath69 ) can be summed to all orders , and dominate the perturbation theory in the region @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "unfortunately , most of the interesting physics , and most of the data , lie outside this region of validity of the leading logarithm approximation .",
    "fortunately , one can go beyond the leading logarithm summation to obtain a result that is valid even when @xmath72 is large .",

    ", by comparing the summed form with the order @xmath1 form of @xmath77 , we will be able to extract the coefficients that appear in the summed form .",
