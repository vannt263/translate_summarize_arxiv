    "the two peaks induced by @xmath241 are universal and survive even for the case of fast fluctuations @xmath242 , as shown at fig 6b .",
    "rapid changes during @xmath11 and @xmath13 induce a new peak at the average frequency ( 0,0 ) , ( motional narrowing ) . the @xmath175 ( 0,0 )",
    "peak is lorentzian : the star - like contours , best seen for @xmath243 correspond to a product two lorentzians along @xmath244 and @xmath245 .",
    "the @xmath173 and @xmath174 lineshapes are similar .",
    "both may be described by a statistical mixture of rapidly fluctuating particles responsible for the central peak , with the static phase responsible for the divergent peaks at the fundamental frequencies .",
    "surprisingly , this picture is most pronounced for small @xmath243 where all peaks are well - separated .",
    "increasing @xmath204 broadens the ( -1,-1 ) , and ( 1,1 ) peaks , making them interfere with the central peak , and the lorentzian shape becomes less pronounced as @xmath205 .",
    "the variation of @xmath175 with @xmath12 in the slow fluctuation limit is displayed in fig 7 .",
    "for @xmath12 longer than the mean waiting time @xmath246 fractions of trajectories have different frequencies in the @xmath11 and @xmath13 intervals , as described by the @xmath247 contribution resulting in new cross peaks at ( -1,1 ) ; ( 1,-1 ) . since we are in the slow fluctuation limit the peaks are still well resolved .",
    "both diagonal and cross peak contours are elongated along the @xmath248 directions .",
    "nevertheless the decay of the @xmath247 contribution @xmath249 ( compared to the diverging @xmath250 decay of @xmath251 which is relevant for diagonal peaks ) is integrable and thus the cross peaks do not diverge .",
    "another notable point is the breakdown of eq.([factorization ] ) at @xmath248 ; memory loss is not complete since the algebraic functions do not factorize . at other frequencies the lineshapes approach this limiting lineshapes ( eq .",

    "the response function then depends @xmath67 even for @xmath255 .",

    "the lack of stationarity has some important consequences . as pointed in @xcite frequency domain absorption measurement",
    "is no longer given by the fourier transformed response function .",
    "thus the absorption of an aging ensemble can not be calculated using eq .",
    "( [ linform ] ) . fortunately ,",
    "2dcs works in the time domain , and the measurement directly probes the response function .",
    "thus the problems discussed in @xcite do not apply for impulsive time - domain techniques such as 2dcs lineshape .",
    "a more subtle point is that due to the lack of equilibration , the averaging over consecutive pulse sequences may depend on the experimental data acquisition repetition rate .",

    "in addition , aging effects appear at arbitrarily long timescales ( for suitable choice of parameters ) . this overcomes the difficulty with strongly anomalous ensembles , whose lineshapes can not be obtained by repeated measurements on the same sample , whose response function is changed between two pulse sequences .",
    "the top left panel of fig .",
    "8 ( @xmath69 ) shows fast - fluctuation markovian contours and only tiny peaks at ( 1,1 ) , and ( -1,-1 ) .",

    "( [ sym_diagonal ] ) is nearly satisfied .",
    "we next increase the aging time @xmath67 as we move from the top left panel to bottom right panel .",
    "the ( 1,1 ) and ( -1,-1 ) peaks appear and grow , while the central peaks slowly get weaker .",
    "this reflects decrease of the jump rate with time . some small deviation from the symmetry relation eq .",
    "( [ sym_diagonal ] ) can be noticed .",
    "the process is nearly reversible on the @xmath270 timescale which dominates the lineshapes .",
    "a remarkable point is that the central ( motional narrowing ) peak coexists with these static limit peaks .",
    "the anomalous process is better viewed as a mixture of static and fluctuating particles , rather than a homogeneous rate .",
    "this clearly distinguishes our algorithm from calculations based on time - dependent rate master equations , which do not allow to properly describe memory effects in multipoint probes . to support this statement we have constructed markovian process subjected to the same master equation",
    ", i.e. we require correct prediction of total densities and subsequently apply them to calculating response or multipoint correlation function based on markovian schemes .",
    "the trajectory picture of both approaches is different @xcite .    consider a markovian master equation whereby densities evolve in the same way as the aging random walk for arbitrary initial densities , i.e. it has the same green s function @xmath271 .",

    "aging effects ( decreasing mobility with time ) are reflected in the decreasing rates . increasing @xmath288 the decay is slower when approaching the markovian limit ( @xmath286 ) and the rates change slowly for long periods .",

    "the significance of the different trajectory picture can be seen by comparing the two lineshapes at fig 8 and 10 .",
    "we notice that the crossover to static lineshapes is somewhat faster at fig 10 .",
    "this is , however , less obvious feature , since it depends on chosen particular parametrization . the more significant feature , which distinguishes the two models is that the static peaks at fundamental frequencies and the fast motional narrowing central peak never coexist at fig 10 in contrast to fig 8 .",
    "this may be explained as the direct signature of memory .",
    "the ctrw model shows two populations static and fast fluctuating , i.e. particles are differentiated based on their histories .",
    "in contrast all particles in the markovian model have homogenous probabilities for the next jump .",
    "this lack of memory is reflected in the unique peak pattern with no simultaneous static and fast fluctuating signatures in the spectrum .",
    "these two models are nonequivalent since they assign different trajectory picture to the same density matrix , as is clearly seen from the higher order correlation functions and response .",
    "the coexistence of both static and fast fluctuations in spectra clearly reflects the additional information , beyond the two point correlation functions .",
    "the unravelling of master equations into trajectories is an important issue .",
