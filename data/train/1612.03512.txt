    "a simplicial complex is called @xmath0-neighborly if every subset of vertices of size at most @xmath0 is the set of vertices of one of its faces . neighborly complexes , especially neighborly polytopes and spheres , are interesting objects to study . in the seminal work of mcmullen @xcite and stanley @xcite",
    ", it was shown that in the class of polytopes and simplicial spheres , of a fixed dimension and with a fixed number of vertices , the cyclic polytope simultaneously maximizes all the face numbers .",
    "the @xmath1-dimensional cyclic polytope is @xmath2-neighborly .",
    "since then , many other classes of neighborly polytopes have been discovered .",
    "we refer to @xcite , @xcite and @xcite for examples and constructions of neighborly polytopes .",
    "meanwhile , the notion of neighborliness was extended to other classes of objects : for instance , neighborly cubical polytopes were defined and studied in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , and neighborly centrally symmetric polytopes and spheres were studied in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .    one goal of this manuscript is to discuss a similar notion for balanced simplicial complexes .",
    "balanced complexes were defined by stanley in @xcite , where they were called completely balanced .",
    "a @xmath3-dimensional simplicial complex is called balanced if its graph is @xmath1-colorable .",
    "we say that a balanced simplicial complex is _ balanced @xmath0-neighborly _ if every set of @xmath0 or fewer vertices with _ distinct _ colors forms a face .",
    "it is natural to ask whether apart from cross - polytopes , balanced @xmath0-neighborly polytopes or balanced @xmath0-neighborly spheres exist . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "no examples of such objects appear in the current literature , even for @xmath4 , and there is not even a plausible sharp upper bound conjecture for balanced spheres .    in this manuscript ,",
    "we provide two constructions of balanced 2-neighborly 3-spheres with 16 vertices . in @xcite , pfeifle , pilaud and santos , in answering the question of when a given graph is the graph of a polytope , studied the polytopality of cartesian products of certain classes of non - polytopal graphs . as a consequence ,",
    "our constructions show that the complete 4-partite graph on 16 vertices with parts of equal size is the graph of a 3-sphere .    in a different direction",
    ", it is also interesting to ask whether every rank - selected subcomplex of a balanced simplicial polytope or sphere has a convex ear decomposition .",
    "this statement , if true , would imply that rank - selected subcomplexes of balanced simplicial polytopes possess certain weak lefschetz properties , see theorem 3.9 in @xcite . as a consequence",
    ", it would also provide an alternative proof of the balanced generalized lower bound theorem , see theorem 3.3 and remark 3.4 in @xcite . in this manuscript , we present examples giving a negative answer to this question for 3-dimensional spheres .",
    "the structure of this manuscript is as follows . in section 2 , after reviewing basic definitions , we establish basic properties of balanced neighborly spheres ; in particular , we prove that for some values of @xmath5 , such spheres can not exist . in section 3 ,",
    "we present our first construction of a balanced 2-neighborly 3-sphere with 16 vertices .",
    "we also show that several of its rank - selected subcomplexes do not have an ear decomposition , and find two balanced non - shellable 3-balls as its subcomplexes . in section 4 ,",
    "we provide our second construction of a balanced 2-neighborly 3-sphere with 16 vertices .",
    "it is different from the first one since all of its rank - selected subcomplexes have ear decompositions .",
    "several other examples are provided in section 5 .",

    "we present an example different from construction [ first example ] .",
    "its rank - selected subcomplex can be embedded in @xmath321 .",
    "the strategy is that we want to construct a balanced 3-sphere @xmath6 so that for a fixed color set @xmath322 , the intersection of any two vertex links @xmath68 always has at least two connected components . in figure [ fig1:links ]",

    "it follows that the boundary complex of @xmath339 is a 2-sphere ; we let it be @xmath340 .",
