    "the central goal in the field of quantum information processing is to gain a deeper understanding of quantum mechanical systems as objects for encoding , transferring , securing , and manipulating information . in quantum mechanics ,",
    "the standard mathematical tool used for combining physical systems is the well - studied notion of _ tensor product_. many scenarios in quantum information processing require working with tensor product structures . as a direct consequence of the axiomatisation of quantum mechanics ,",
    "the tensor product has acquired a fundamental role in describing the behaviour of various physical phenomena : _ quantum entanglement _ is one of those . even if entanglement is somehow a mathematical artifact ,",
    "it quickly emerged as one of the defining characteristics of quantum mechanics itself . in quantum information processing",
    ", it is now clear that entanglement has ubiquitous applications , being a necessary ingredient in protocols for cryptography , a number of distributed tasks , and also computation @xcite .",
    "indeed , we have evidence to the fact that algorithmic speedup promised by quantum computers seems to rely on the presence of a sufficiently large amount of entanglement @xcite .",
    "however , recently , other quantities have been proposed as being responsible for quantum algorithmic speedup ",
    "see contextuality @xcite .    on a more firm ground , we can say that entanglement is responsible for the advantage exhibited by quantum strategies in a variety of multi - party games and interactive proof systems .",
    "moreover , there is a whole set of information theoretic tasks in which entanglement provides a neat distinction between classical and quantum behaviour  see , for example , zero - error quantum information theory @xcite , superactivation of channels @xcite , _",
    "etc_. finally , at the foundational level , quantum entanglement has been traditionally interpreted as an inherently quantum feature embodying non - classical correlations between the components of a physical system @xcite .    despite the fact that entanglement manifests itself as a `` physical property '' of quantum systems , detecting its presence with the mathematical tools made available by",
    "the theory is a complex problem in general .",
    "the task of deciding if a quantum state is _ entangled _ or , conversely , _ separable _ , is in fact highly non - trivial : no necessary and sufficient criterion exists for detecting entanglement . as a matter of fact ,",
    "the problem of testing separability of an arbitrary density matrix is np - hard @xcite . over the years",
    "a rich set of mathematical tools has been developed in relation to this problem .",
    "the toolbox includes hierarchies of positive semi - definite programs , results from operator theory and functional analysis , ideas from linear algebra and matrix theory , _ etc .",
    "while pure state entanglement is relatively well understood , the study of the mixed state case has revealed numerous subtleties . additionally , there are substantial differences between the case involving only two subsystems , and the generic case .",
    "one of the difficulties lies in the emergence of properties specifically connected with the presence of multiple subsystems , and in the choice of an appropriate entanglement measure .",
    "it turns out that in some cases , the performance of certain entanglement measures depends on the type of state under consideration . in other words ,",
    "different entanglement measures lend themselves to the analysis of particular families of states . with this perspective in mind , it is useful to introduce new families of mixed states as a means for testing different measures and , more generally , to study the behaviour of multipartite entanglement .      in this work ,",
    "we focus on the problem of detecting entanglement present in mixed states , using a classical description of the state as input .",
    "we present new combinatorial objects , which we call _ grid - labelled graphs _ , which are obtained by labelling simple graphs with the point coordinates of a given grid .",
    "we show how grid - labelled graphs can be used to represent the quantum states arising in a scenario which we refer to as the _ faulty emitter scenario_. here we have a device designed to emit a particular quantum state on demand , but which occasionally in error emits a different one . while the device does not know exactly which state it just emitted , it is able to produce a short - list of candidate states",
    ". the goal is then to use these candidate states to deduce if entanglement is present  see section [ subsection : faultyemittersandcombinatorialentanglement ] .",
    "the main focus of the paper is the study of grid - labelled graphs , and how their structural properties allow us to reason about separability in the underlying quantum state .",
    "this framework is not fully new , since it is closely related to the study of combinatorial laplacians as quantum states initiated by braunstein _",
    "on one hand we reconsider their ideas from the ground up , but our key innovation is the introduction of a natural vertex labelling induced by the tensor product .",
    "this labelling provides a more physical interpretation of the states .",
    "moreover , the labelling allows us to employ a wealth of mathematical tools of a combinatorial flavour .",
    "in particular , we shall explore how two entanglement criteria , the peres - horodecki criterion and the matrix realignment criterion , manifest themselves in terms of graph structure and related combinatorics .",
    "we use this novel perspective to explore the interplay between these entanglement criteria .",
    "we are able to use it to generate an infinite family of entangled states that are not detected by the matrix realignment criterion , as well as two entangled states that are not detected by the peres - horodecki criterion .",
    "the latter states are said to be _ bound entangled _",
    "let us recall that there is no general algorithm to decide whether a given state is bound entangled .",
    "the states arising in the faulty emitter scenario make up a discrete subset of all possible density matrices . despite the apparent simplicity of the states",
    ", it seems that there is no method for testing separability that works in all cases .",
    "this fact suggests that these states are an interesting playground in which to explore the interplay between entanglement and computational complexity .",
    "a proof of np - hardness of testing separability of these states is likely to rely on graph theoretic machinery , and could possibly be much simpler than the well known proof of gurvits @xcite . furthermore , such a hardness result would be interesting in its own right , as it would be an explicit demonstration of a family of density matrices for which separability is hard to test .    in our attempts to understand the entanglement properties of grid - labelled graphs we need to introduce a number of new mathematical concepts .",
    "while these are described in detail in the subsequent sections of this paper , in the remainder of this introduction we will attempt to give a taste of some of them .",
    "as shown by braunstein _",
    "@xcite , if the density matrix under consideration is a combinatorial laplacian matrix then the partial transpose corresponds to an operation on the edges of the corresponding graph .",
    "testing whether a density matrix is entangled by means of the peres - horodecki criterion then amounts to observing the effect of this operation on the edges of the graph .",
    "the corresponding density matrix is entangled if the vertex degrees are modified by the partial transpose .",
    "naturally , our canonical labelling of the graph means that this _ degree criterion _ can still be utilised in our grid - labelled graph framework . in section",
    "[ section : separabilityin3x3 ] , we are interested in characterising grid - labelled graphs that satisfy the criterion . in order to do so , we introduce _ edge contribution _ matrices and tables , as tools to gain insight into the effect of the partial transpose operation .",
    "such notions allow us to gain a `` spatial '' view of the contribution of each edge to the vertices on the grid before and after the partial transpose . in appendix [",
    "appendix : contributiontables ] we isolate objects and study them in their own right , formulating a single player board game .",
    "we leave the classification of the computational complexity of this entanglement inspired game as an open problem .    in the process of classifying grid - labelled graphs that satisfy the degree criterion , we come across two particular instances that have bound entangled quantum states .",
    "an advantage of using our grid - labelled graph framework is that it prompts us to see patterns in the structure of the quantum states we are considering .",
    "the two bound entangled states in question have grid - labelled graphs with a particular edge pattern .",
    "it is easy to see how this pattern can be scaled up to generate similar quantum states in higher dimensions .",
    "we leave it as an open question to determine whether or not these higher dimensional states with the particular edge pattern are bound entangled .",
    "our initial calculations suggest that such a cross - hatch structure is indeed a signature of bound entanglement @xcite .",
    "this is encouraging evidence in the favour of using `` structural '' arguments to characterise quantum states like we do .    in quantum mechanics ,",
    "if a multi - partite quantum state can be transformed into another by means of a sequence of _ local operations _",
    ", that is , a sequence of individual manipulations performed on each part of the system , then we say that the states are _ local operations and classical communication equivalent _",
    "( for short , locc equivalent ) .",
    "naturally , such local manipulations can not be used to increase the amount of entanglement in the system . in our discussion",
    ", we are able to meaningfully express a subset of the locc operations as manipulations of the edges of the grid - labelled graph .",
    "concretely , we say that two grid - labelled graphs are _ locally isomorphic _ if they can be obtained from one another by permuting the vertices in the rows and columns of the associated grid .",
    "this idea expresses a special case of the graph isomorphism problem . in section [",
    "subsection : localisomorphisms ] , not surprisingly , we prove that pairs of locally isomorphic graphs have the same entanglement properties .",
    "of course , acting with a generic permutation on a grid - labelled graph could lead to a state that has completely different entanglement properties . as such",
    ", isomorphisms in full generality could be interpreted as including the entangling operations , while local isomorphisms correspond to locc .",
    "this is another example of a mathematical concept that we feel is interesting in its own right , and could potentially lead to new combinatorial questions and ideas . for example , in section [ subsection : localisomorphisms ] we show that testing local isomorphism of grid - labelled graphs is at least as hard as the graph isomorphism problem .    finally , in section [ section : thematrixrealignmentcriterion ] , we introduce two matrices that encode the structure of a graph , the _ degree structure _ and _ adjacency structure _ matrices . we show that , in some cases , the entanglement present in the quantum state of a grid - labelled graph can be detected by calculating the eigenvalues of these matrices .",
    "this suggests that properties of grid - labelled graphs are also captured by methods from algebraic graph theory , beyond a direct combinatorial analysis . throughout the paper , we state a number of computational problems ,",
    "whose complexity is left open . in particular ,",
    "the problem @xmath0-graphseparability is concerned with testing separability of grid - labelled graphs with a particular number of vertices and edges .",
    "additionally , subsetppt and subgraphdc deal with constructing examples of quantum states that satisfy the peres - horodecki criterion and come from our analysis of the entanglement - inspired single player game discussed in appendix [ appendix : contributiontables ] . while intuitively there is a connection between subsetppt and the well known problem subsetsum , there is additional structure to subsetppt which does not indicate an immediate reduction .",
    "the combinatorial laplacian matrix of a graph has been treated as a density matrix in @xcite . in that work",
    ", it was shown that for such density matrices , the peres - horodecki entanglement criterion @xcite can be expressed in terms of the structure of the corresponding graph via a criterion referred to as the _ degree criterion_. this idea is further explored in @xcite , where it was conjectured that this criterion is necessary and sufficient for testing separability of such graph laplacian states .",
    "wu @xcite proved that the degree criterion is necessary and sufficient for graph laplacian states in @xmath1 for any @xmath2 .",
    "shortly afterwards however , hildebrand _ et al . _",
    "@xcite provided a counterexample to the conjecture , demonstrating a graph laplacian state in @xmath3 that satisfies the degree criterion , but is entangled .",
    "variations and generalisations on the work of @xcite has been carried out , mostly focusing on weighted graphs and multipartite correlations @xcite . in this work",
    "we focus on simple graphs and bipartite entanglement .",
