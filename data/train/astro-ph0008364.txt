    "after almost 90 years of research on cosmic rays ( crs ) , their origin is still an open question , for which the degree of uncertainty increases with energy : only below 100 mev kinetic energy , where the solar wind shields protons coming from outside the solar system , the sun must give rise to the observed proton flux .",
    "the bulk of the crs up to at least an energy of @xmath1ev is believed to originate within our galaxy . above that energy , which is associated with the so called `` knee '' , the flux of particles per area , time , solid angle , and energy , which can be well approximated by broken power laws @xmath2 , steepens from a power law index @xmath3 to one of index @xmath4 . above the so called `` ankle '' at @xmath5ev ,",
    "the spectrum flattens again to a power law of index @xmath6 .",
    "this latter feature is often interpreted as a cross over from a steeper galactic component to a harder component of extragalactic origin .",
    "[ fig1a ] shows the measured cr spectrum above 100 mev , up to @xmath7ev , the highest energy measured so far for an individual cr .",
    "the conventional scenario assumes that all high energy charged particles are accelerated in magnetized astrophysical shocks , whose size and typical magnetic field strength determines the maximal achievable energy , similar to the situation in man made particle accelerators .",
    "the most likely astrophysical accelerators for cr up to the knee , and possibly up to the ankle are the shocks associated with remnants of past galactic supernova explosions , whereas for the presumed extragalactic component powerful objects such as active galactic nuclei are envisaged",
    ".    the main focus of this contribution will be on ultrahigh energy cosmic rays ( uhecrs ) , those with energy @xmath8ev",
    "@xcite , see fig .  [ fig1b ] . for more details on crs in general",
    "the reader is referred to recent monographs  @xcite . in particular ,",
    "extremely high energy ( ehe)ev , while the abbreviation uhe for `` ultra - high energy '' will sometimes be used to denote @xmath9 1 eev , where 1 eev = @xmath10ev .",
    "clearly uhe includes ehe but not vice versa . ]",
    "cosmic rays pose a serious challenge for conventional theories of cr origin based on acceleration of charged particles in powerful astrophysical objects .",
    "the question of the origin of these ehecrs is , therefore , currently a subject of much intense debate and discussions as well as experimental efforts ; see refs .",
    "@xcite , and ref .",
    "@xcite for recent brief reviews , and ref .",
    "@xcite for a detailed review . in sect .  2 we will summarize detection techniques and present and future experimental projects .",
    "the current theories of origin of ehecrs can be broadly categorized into two distinct `` scenarios '' : the `` bottom - up '' acceleration scenario , and the `` top - down '' decay scenario , with various different models within each scenario .",
    "as the names suggest , the two scenarios are in a sense exact opposite of each other .",
    "the bottom - up scenario is just an extension of the conventional shock acceleration scenario in which charged particles are accelerated from lower energies to the requisite high energies in certain special astrophysical environments . on the other hand , in the top - down scenario , the energetic particles arise simply from decay of certain sufficiently massive particles originating from physical processes in the early universe , and no acceleration mechanism is needed .    the problems encountered in trying to explain ehecrs in terms of acceleration mechanisms have been well - documented in a number of studies ; see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite . even if it is possible , in principle , to accelerate particles to ehecr energies of order 100 eev in some astrophysical sources , it is generally extremely difficult in most cases to get the particles come out of the dense regions in and/or around the sources without losing much energy",
    ". currently , the most favorable sources in this regard are perhaps a class of powerful radio galaxies ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite for recent reviews and references to the literature ) , although the values of the relevant parameters required for acceleration to energies @xmath11 100 eev are somewhat on the extreme side  @xcite .",
    "however , even if the requirements of energetics are met , the main problem with radio galaxies as sources of ehecrs is that most of them seem to lie at large cosmological distances , @xmath12 100 mpc , from earth .",
    "this is a major problem if ehecr particles are conventional particles such as nucleons or heavy nuclei .",
    "the reason is that nucleons above @xmath13 70 eev lose energy drastically during their propagation from the source to earth due to the greisen - zatsepin - kuzmin ( gzk ) effect  @xcite , namely , photo - production of pions when the nucleons collide with photons of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , the mean - free path for which is @xmath14 few mpc  @xcite .",
    "this process limits the possible distance of any source of ehe nucleons to @xmath15 100 mpc . if the particles were heavy nuclei , they would be photo - disintegrated  @xcite in the cmb and infrared ( ir ) background within similar distances .",
    "thus , nucleons or heavy nuclei originating in distant radio galaxies are unlikely to survive with ehecr energies at earth with any significant flux , even if they were accelerated to energies of order 100 eev at source .",
    "in addition , if cosmic magnetic fields are not close to existing upper limits , ehecrs are not likely to be deflected strongly by large scale cosmological and/or galactic magnetic fields thus , ehecr arrival directions should point back to their sources in the sky ( see sect .  5 for details ) and ehecrs may offer us the unique opportunity of doing charged particle astronomy . yet , for the observed ehecr events so far , no powerful sources close to the arrival directions of individual events are found within about 100 mpc  @xcite .",
    "very recently , it has been suggested by boldt and ghosh  @xcite that particles may be accelerated to energies @xmath16ev near the event horizons of spinning supermassive black holes associated with presently _ inactive _ quasar remnants whose numbers within the local cosmological universe ( i.e. , within a gzk distance of order 50 mpc ) may be sufficient to explain the observed ehecr flux .",
    "this would solve the problem of absence of suitable currently _ active _ sources associated with ehecrs . a detailed model incorporating this suggestion",
    ", however , remains to be worked out .",
    "there are , of course , ways to avoid the distance restriction imposed by the gzk effect , provided the problem of energetics is somehow solved separately and provided one allows new physics beyond the standard model of particle physics ; we shall discuss those suggestions in sect .",
    "3 .    on the other hand , in the top - down scenario , which will be discussed in sect .  4 ,",
    "the problem of energetics is trivially solved from the beginning . here",
    ", the ehecr particles owe their origin to decay of some supermassive `` x '' particles of mass @xmath17ev , so that their decay products , envisaged as the ehecr particles , can have energies all the way up to @xmath18 .",
    "thus , no acceleration mechanism is needed .",
    "the sources of the massive x particles could be topological defects such as cosmic strings or magnetic monopoles that could be produced in the early universe during symmetry - breaking phase transitions envisaged in grand unified theories ( guts ) . in an inflationary early universe",
    ", the relevant topological defects could be formed at a phase transition at the end of inflation .",
    "alternatively , the x particles could be certain supermassive metastable relic particles of lifetime comparable to or larger than the age of the universe , which could be produced in the early universe through , for example , particle production processes associated with inflation .",
    "absence of nearby powerful astrophysical objects such as agns or radio galaxies is not a problem in the top - down scenario because the x particles or their sources need not necessarily be associated with any specific active astrophysical objects . in certain models , the x particles themselves or their sources may be clustered in galactic halos , in which case the dominant contribution to the ehecrs observed at earth would come from the x particles clustered within our galactic halo , for which the gzk restriction on source distance would be of no concern .    by focusing primarily on `` non - conventional '' scenarios involving new particle physics beyond the electroweak scale ,",
    "we do not wish to give the wrong impression that these scenarios explain all aspects of ehecrs .",
    "in fact , as we shall see below , essentially each of the specific models that have been studied so far has its own peculiar set of problems .",
    "indeed , the main problem of non - astrophysical solutions of the ehecr problem in general is that they are highly model dependent . on the other hand ,",
    "it is precisely because of this reason that these scenarios are also attractive  they bring in ideas of new physics beyond the standard model of particle physics ( such as grand unification and new interactions beyond the reach of terrestrial accelerators ) as well as ideas of early universe cosmology ( such as topological defects and/or massive particle production in inflation ) into the realms of ehecrs where these ideas have the potential to be tested by future ehecr experiments .    the physics and astrophysics of uhecrs are intimately linked with the emerging field of neutrino astronomy ( for reviews see refs .",
    "@xcite ) as well as with the already established field of @xmath0ray astronomy ( for reviews see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) which in turn are important subdisciplines of particle astrophysics ( for a review see , e.g. , ref .",
    "indeed , as we shall see , all scenarios of uhecr origin , including the top - down models , are severely constrained by neutrino and @xmath0ray observations and limits . in turn , this linkage has important consequences for theoretical predictions of fluxes of extragalactic neutrinos above a tev or so whose detection is a major goal of next - generation neutrino telescopes ( see sect .",
    "2 ) : if these neutrinos are produced as secondaries of protons accelerated in astrophysical sources and if these protons are not absorbed in the sources , but rather contribute to the uhecr flux observed , then the energy content in the neutrino flux can not be higher than the one in uhecrs , leading to the so called waxman bahcall bound  @xcite .",
    "if one of these assumptions does not apply , such as for acceleration sources that are opaque to nucleons or in the td scenarios where x particle decays produce much fewer nucleons than @xmath0rays and neutrinos , the waxman bahcall bound does not apply , but the neutrino flux is still constrained by the observed diffuse @xmath0ray flux in the gev range ( see sect .  4.4 ) .    finally , in sect .",
    "5 we shall discuss how , apart from the unsolved problem of the source mechanism , ehecr observations have the potential to yield important information on galactic and extragalactic magnetic fields .",
    "the cr primaries are shielded by the earth s atmosphere and near the ground reveal their existence only by indirect effects such as ionization .",
    "indeed , it was the height dependence of this latter effect which lead to the discovery of crs by hess in 1912 . direct observation of cr primaries is only possible from space by flying detectors with balloons or spacecraft .",
    "naturally , such detectors are very limited in size and because the differential cr spectrum is a steeply falling function of energy ( see fig .  [ fig1a ] ) ,",
    "direct observations run out of statistics typically around a few @xmath19tev .    above @xmath20tev ,",
    "the showers of secondary particles created in the interactions of the primary cr with the atmosphere are extensive enough to be detectable from the ground . in the most traditional technique , charged hadronic particles , as well as electrons and muons in these extensive air showers ( eas ) are recorded on the ground  @xcite with standard instruments such as water cherenkov detectors used in the old volcano ranch  @xcite and haverah park  @xcite experiments , and scintillation detectors which are used now - a - days .",
    "currently operating ground arrays for uhecr eas are the yakutsk experiment in russia  @xcite and the akeno giant air shower array ( agasa ) near tokyo , japan , which is the largest one , covering an area of roughly @xmath21 with about 100 detectors mutually separated by about @xmath22 km  @xcite .",
    "the sydney university giant air shower recorder ( sugar )  @xcite operated until 1979 and was the largest array in the southern hemisphere .",
    "the ground array technique allows one to measure a lateral cross section of the shower profile .",
    "the energy of the shower - initiating primary particle is estimated by appropriately parametrizing it in terms of a measurable parameter ; traditionally this parameter is taken to be the particle density at 600 m from the shower core , which is found to be quite insensitive to the primary composition and the interaction model used to simulate air showers .",
    "the detection of secondary photons from eas represents a complementary technique .",
    "the experimentally most important light sources are the fluorescence of air nitrogen excited by the charged particles in the eas and the cherenkov radiation from the charged particles that travel faster than the speed of light in the atmospheric medium .",
    "the first source is practically isotropic whereas the second one produces light strongly concentrated on the surface of a cone around the propagation direction of the charged source .",
    "the fluorescence technique can be used equally well for both charged and neutral primaries and was first used by the fly s eye detector  @xcite and will be part of several future projects on uhecrs ( see below ) .",
    "the primary energy can be estimated from the total fluorescence yield .",
    "information on the primary composition is contained in the column depth @xmath23 ( measured in g@xmath24 ) at which the shower reaches maximal particle density .",
    "the average of @xmath23 is related to the primary energy @xmath25 by @xmath26 here , @xmath27 is called the elongation rate and @xmath28 is a characteristic energy that depends on the primary composition . therefore",
    ", if @xmath23 and @xmath27 are determined from the longitudinal shower profile measured by the fluorescence detector , then @xmath28 and thus the composition , can be extracted after determining the energy @xmath25 from the total fluorescence yield .",
    "comparison of cr spectra measured with the ground array and the fluorescence technique indicate systematic errors in energy calibration that are generally smaller than @xmath14 40% . for a more detailed discussion of experimental eas analysis with the ground array and the fluorescence technique see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite .    as an upscaled version of the old fly s eye cosmic ray experiment , the high resolution fly s eye detector is currently under construction at utah , usa  @xcite .",
    "taking into account a duty cycle of about 10% ( a fluorescence detector requires clear , moonless nights ) , the effective aperture of this instrument will be @xmath29 at @xmath30eev , on average about 6 times the fly s eye aperture , with a threshold around @xmath31ev .",
    "another project utilizing the fluorescence technique is the japanese telescope array  @xcite which is currently in the proposal stage .",
    "if approved , its effective aperture will be about 10 times that of fly s eye above @xmath31ev , and it would also be used as a cherenkov detector for tev @xmath0ray astrophysics .",
    "the largest project presently under construction is the pierre auger giant array observatory  @xcite planned for two sites , one in argentina and another in the usa for maximal sky coverage .",
    "each site will have a @xmath32 ground array .",
    "the southern site will have about 1600 particle detectors ( separated by 1.5 km each ) overlooked by four fluorescence detectors .",
    "the ground arrays will have a duty cycle of nearly 100% , leading to an effective aperture about 30 times as large as the agasa array .",
    "the corresponding cosmic ray event rate above @xmath33ev will be about 50 events per year .",
    "about 10% of the events will be detected by both the ground array and the fluorescence component and can be used for cross calibration and detailed eas studies .",
    "the energy threshold will be around @xmath10ev , with full sensitivity above @xmath34ev .",
    "recently nasa initiated a concept study for detecting eas from space  @xcite by observing their fluorescence light from an orbiting wide - angle light - collector ( owl ) .",
    "this would provide an increase by another factor @xmath35 in aperture compared to the pierre auger project , corresponding to an event rate of up to a few thousand events per year above @xmath33ev .",
    "similar concepts such as the extreme universe space observatory ( euso )  @xcite which is part of the airwatch program  @xcite and of which a prototype may be tested on the international space station are also being discussed .",
    "it is possible that the owl and airwatch efforts will merge .",
    "the energy threshold of such instruments would be between @xmath36 and @xmath33ev",
    ". this technique would be especially suitable for detection of very small event rates such as those caused by uhe neutrinos which would produce deeply penetrating eas ( see sect .",
    "4.4 ) . for more details on these recent experimental considerations",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "high energy neutrino astronomy is aiming towards a kilometer scale neutrino observatory .",
    "the major technique is the optical detection of cherenkov light emitted by muons created in charged current reactions of neutrinos with nucleons either in water or in ice .",
    "the largest pilot experiments representing these two detector media are the now defunct deep undersea muon and neutrino detection ( dumand ) experiment  @xcite in the deep sea near hawai and the antarctic muon and neutrino detector array ( amanda ) experiment  @xcite in the south pole ice .",
    "another water based experiment is situated at lake baikal  @xcite .",
    "next generation deep sea projects include the french astronomy with a neutrino telescope and abyss environmental research ( antares )  @xcite and the underwater neutrino experiment southwest of greece ( nestor ) project in the mediterranean  @xcite , whereas icecube  @xcite represents the planned kilometer scale version of the amanda detector .",
    "also under consideration are neutrino detectors utilizing techniques to detect the radio pulse from the electromagnetic showers created by neutrino interactions in ice .",
    "this technique could possibly be scaled up to an effective area of @xmath37 and a prototype is represented by the radio ice cherenkov experiment ( rice ) experiment at the south pole  @xcite .",
    "neutrinos can also initiate horizontal eas which can be detected by giant ground arrays such as the pierre auger project  @xcite . furthermore , as mentioned above , deeply penetrating eas could be detected from space by instruments such as the proposed space based airwatch type detectors  @xcite .",
    "more details and references on neutrino astronomy detectors are contained in refs .",
    "@xcite , and some recent overviews on neutrino astronomy can be found in ref .",
    "a possible way around the problem of missing counterparts within acceleration scenarios is to propose primary particles whose range is not limited by interactions with the cmb . within the standard model",
    "the only candidate is the neutrino , whereas in supersymmetric extensions of the standard model , new neutral hadronic bound states of light gluinos with quarks and gluons , so - called r - hadrons that are heavier than nucleons , and therefore have a higher gzk threshold , have been suggested  @xcite .    in both the neutrino and new massive neutral hadron scenario",
    "the particle propagating over extragalactic distances would have to be produced as a secondary in interactions of a primary proton that is accelerated in a powerful agn which can , in contrast to the case of eas induced by nucleons , nuclei , or @xmath0rays , be located at high redshift .",
    "consequently , these scenarios predict a correlation between primary arrival directions and high redshift sources .",
    "in fact , possible evidence for an angular correlation of the five highest energy events with compact radio quasars at redshifts between 0.3 and 2.2 was recently reported  @xcite .",
    "a new analysis with the somewhat larger data set now available does not support significant correlations  @xcite .",
    "this is currently disputed since another group claims to have found a correlation on the 99.9% confidence level  @xcite .",
    "only a few more events could confirm or rule out the correlation hypothesis .",
    "note that these scenarios would require the primary proton to be accelerated up to @xmath38ev , demanding a very powerful astrophysical accelerator . on the other hand ,",
    "a few dozen such exceptional accelerators in the visible universe may suffice .",
    "neutrino primaries have the advantage of being well established particles .",
    "however , within the standard model their interaction cross section with nucleons , whose charged current part can be parametrized by  @xcite @xmath39 falls short by about five orders of magnitude to produce ordinary air showers .",
    "however , it has been suggested that the neutrino - nucleon cross section , @xmath40 , can be enhanced by new physics beyond the electroweak scale in the center of mass ( cm ) frame , or above about a pev in the nucleon rest frame .",
    "neutrino induced air showers may therefore rather directly probe new physics beyond the electroweak scale .",
    "two major possibilities have been discussed in the literature for which unitarity bounds need not be violated . in the first , a broken su(3 ) gauge symmetry dual to the unbroken su(3 ) color gauge group of strong interaction is introduced as the `` generation symmetry '' such that the three generations of leptons and quarks represent the quantum numbers of this generation symmetry . in this scheme",
    ", neutrinos can have close to strong interaction cross sections with quarks .",
    "in addition , neutrinos can interact coherently with all partons in the nucleon , resulting in an effective cross section comparable to the geometrical nucleon cross section .",
    "this model lends itself to experimental verification through shower development altitude statistics  @xcite .",
    "the second possibility consists of a large increase in the number of degrees of freedom above the electroweak scale  @xcite .",
    "a specific implementation of this idea is given in theories with @xmath41 additional large compact dimensions and a quantum gravity scale @xmath42tev that has recently received much attention in the literature  @xcite because it provides an alternative solution ( i.e. , without supersymmetry ) to the hierarchy problem in grand unifications of gauge interactions .",
    "the cross sections within such scenarios have not been calculated from first principles yet . within the field theory approximation which should hold for squared cm energies @xmath43 , the spin 2 character of the graviton predicts @xmath44  @xcite for @xmath45",
    ", several arguments based on unitarity within field theory have been put forward . ref .",
    "@xcite suggested @xmath46 where in the last expression we specified to a neutrino of energy @xmath25 hitting a nucleon at rest .",
    "a more detailed calculation taking into account scattering on individual partons leads to similar orders of magnitude  @xcite .",
    "note that a neutrino would typically start to interact in the atmosphere for @xmath47 , i.e. in the case of eq .",
    "( [ sigma_graviton ] ) for @xmath48ev , assuming @xmath49tev .",
    "the neutrino therefore becomes a primary candidate for the observed ehecr events .",
    "however , since in a neutral current interaction the neutrino transfers only about @xmath50 of its energy to the shower , the cross section probably has to be at least a few @xmath51 to be consistent with observed showers which start within the first @xmath52 of the atmosphere  @xcite .",
    "a specific signature of this scenario would be the absence of any events above the energy where @xmath53 grows beyond @xmath54 in neutrino telescopes based on ice or water as detector medium  @xcite , and a hardening of the spectrum above this energy in atmospheric detectors such as the pierre auger project  @xcite and the proposed space based airwatch type detectors  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , according to eq .",
    "( [ sigma_graviton ] ) , the average atmospheric column depth of the first interaction point of neutrino induced eas in this scenario is predicted to depend linearly on energy .",
    "this should be easy to distinguish from the logarithmic scaling , eq .",
    "( [ elongation ] ) , expected for nucleons , nuclei , and @xmath0rays . to test such scalings one",

    "this probes cross sections in the range @xmath57 . due to the increased water / ice detectors",
    "would probe cross sections in the range @xmath58  @xcite .",
    "within string theory , individual amplitudes are expected to be suppressed exponentially above the string scale @xmath59 which for simplicity we assume here to be comparable to @xmath60 .",
    "this can be interpreted as a result of the finite spatial extension of the string states . in this case , the neutrino nucleon cross section would be dominated by interactions with the partons carrying a momentum fraction @xmath61 , leading to  @xcite @xmath62 ^ 2\\,{\\rm cm}^2    \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this is probably too small to make neutrinos primary candidates for the highest energy showers observed , given the fact that complementary constraints from accelerator experiments result in @xmath63tev  @xcite . on the other hand , in the total cross section amplitude suppression",
    "may be compensated by an exponential growth of the level density  @xcite .",
    "it is currently unclear and it may be model dependent which effect dominates .",
    "thus , an experimental detection of the signatures discussed in this section could lead to constraints on some string - inspired models of extra dimensions .",
    "we note in passing that extra dimensions can have other astrophysical ramifications such as energy loss in stellar environments due to emission of real gravitons into the bulk .",
    "the strongest resulting lower limits on @xmath60 come from the consideration of cooling of the cores of hot supernovae and read @xmath64tev , @xmath65tev , @xmath66tev , and @xmath67tev for @xmath68 , respectively  @xcite .",
    "in addition , implications of extra dimensions for early universe physics and inflation are increasingly studied in the literature , but much work is left to be done on the intersection of these research domains .",
    "independent of theoretical arguments , the uhecr data can be used to put constraints on cross sections satisfying @xmath69 .",

    "the case of a light quasi - stable gluino does not seem to be settled .",

    "for example , as an interesting consequence of the very existence of uhecr , constraints on possible violations of lorentz invariance ( vli ) have been pointed out  @xcite .",

    "as mentioned in the introduction , all top - down scenarios involve the decay of x particles of mass close to the gut scale which can basically be produced in two ways : if they are very short lived , as usually expected in many guts , they have to be produced continuously . the only way this can be achieved is by emission from topological defects left over from cosmological phase transitions that may have occurred in the early universe at temperatures close to the gut scale , possibly during reheating after inflation .",
    "topological defects necessarily occur between regions that are causally disconnected , such that the orientation of the order parameter associated with the phase transition can not be communicated between these regions and consequently will adopt different values .",
    "examples are cosmic strings ( similar to vortices in superfluid helium ) , magnetic monopoles , and domain walls ( similar to bloch walls separating regions of different magnetization in a ferromagnet ) .",
    "the defect density is consequently given by the particle horizon in the early universe and their formation can even be studied in solid state experiments where the expansion rate of the universe corresponds to the quenching speed with which the phase transition is induced  @xcite .",
    "the defects are topologically stable , but in the cosmological case time dependent motion leads to the emission of particles with a mass comparable to the temperature at which the phase transition took place .",
    "the associated phase transition can also occur during reheating after inflation .",
    "alternatively , instead of being released from topological defects , x particles may have been produced directly in the early universe and , due to some unknown symmetries , have a very long lifetime comparable to the age of the universe .",
    "in contrast to weakly - interacting massive particles ( wimps ) below a few hundred tev which are the usual dark matter candidates motivated by , for example , supersymmetry and can be produced by thermal freeze out , such superheavy x particles have to be produced non - thermally .",
    "several such mechanisms operating in the post - inflationary epoch in the early universe have been studied .",
    "they include gravitational production through the effect of the expansion of the background metric on the vacuum quantum fluctuations of the x particle field , or creation during reheating at the end of inflation if the x particle field couples to the inflaton field .",
    "the latter case can be divided into three subcases , namely `` incoherent '' production with an abundance proportional to the x particle annihilation cross section , non - adiabatic production in broad parametric resonances with the oscillating inflaton field during preheating ( analogous to energy transfer in a system of coupled pendula ) , and creation in bubble wall collisions if inflation is completed by a first order phase transition . in all these cases , such particles ,",
    "also called `` wimpzillas '' , would contribute to the dark matter and their decays could still contribute to uhe cr fluxes today , with an anisotropy pattern that reflects the dark matter distribution in the halo of our galaxy .",
    "it is interesting to note that one of the prime motivations of the inflationary paradigm was to dilute excessive production of `` dangerous relics '' such as topological defects and superheavy stable particles .",
    "however , such objects can be produced right after inflation during reheating in cosmologically interesting abundances , and with a mass scale roughly given by the inflationary scale which in turn is fixed by the cmb anisotropies to @xmath127gev  @xcite .",
    "the reader will realize that this mass scale is somewhat above the highest energies observed in crs , which implies that the decay products of these primordial relics could well have something to do with ehecrs which in turn can probe such scenarios !    for dimensional reasons the spatially averaged x particle injection rate can only depend on the mass scale @xmath128 and on cosmic time @xmath129 in the combination @xmath130 where @xmath131 and @xmath132 are dimensionless constants whose value depend on the specific top - down scenario  @xcite , for example , the case @xmath133 is representative of scenarios involving release of x particles from topological defects , such as ordinary cosmic strings  @xcite , necklaces  @xcite and magnetic monopoles  @xcite .",
    "this can be easily seen as follows : the energy density @xmath134 in a network of defects has to scale roughly as the critical density , @xmath135 , where @xmath129 is cosmic time , otherwise the defects would either start to overclose the universe , or end up having a negligible contribution to the total energy density . in order to maintain this scaling",
    ", the defect network has to release energy with a rate given by @xmath136 , where @xmath137 in the radiation dominated aera , and @xmath138 during matter domination .",
    "if most of this energy goes into emission of x particles , then typically @xmath139 . in the numerical simulations presented below",
    ", it was assumed that the x particles are nonrelativistic at decay .",
    "the x particles could be gauge bosons , higgs bosons , superheavy fermions , etc .",
    "depending on the specific gut .",
    "they would have a mass @xmath128 comparable to the symmetry breaking scale and would decay into leptons and/or quarks of roughly comparable energy .",
    "the quarks interact strongly and hadronize into nucleons ( @xmath140s ) and pions , the latter decaying in turn into @xmath141-rays , electrons , and neutrinos . given the x particle production rate , @xmath142 , the effective injection spectrum of particle species @xmath143 ( @xmath144 ) via the hadronic channel can be written as @xmath145 , where @xmath146 , and @xmath147 is the relevant fragmentation function ( ff ) .",
    "we adopt the local parton hadron duality ( lphd ) approximation  @xcite according to which the total hadronic ff , @xmath148 , is taken to be proportional to the spectrum of the partons ( quarks / gluons ) in the parton cascade ( which is initiated by the quark through perturbative qcd processes ) after evolving the parton cascade to a stage where the typical transverse momentum transfer in the qcd cascading processes has come down to @xmath149 few hundred mev , where @xmath150 is a typical hadron size .",
    "the parton spectrum is obtained from solutions of the standard qcd evolution equations in modified leading logarithmic approximation ( mlla ) which provides good fits to accelerator data at lep energies  @xcite .",
    "we will specifically use a recently suggested generalization of the mlla spectrum that includes the effects of supersymmetry  @xcite .",
    "within the lphd hypothesis , the pions and nucleons after hadronization have essentially the same spectrum .",
    "the lphd does not , however , fix the relative abundance of pions and nucleons after hadronization .",
    "motivated by accelerator data , we assume the nucleon content @xmath151 of the hadrons to be in the range 3 to 10% , and the rest pions distributed equally among the three charge states . according to recent monte carlo simulations  @xcite , the nucleon - to - pion ratio may be significantly higher in certain ranges of @xmath152 values at the extremely high energies of interest here .",
    "unfortunately , however , due to the very nature of these monte carlo calculations , it is difficult to understand the precise physical reason for the unexpectedly high baryon yield relative to mesons .",
    "while more of these monte carlo calculations of the relevant ffs in the future will hopefully clarify the situation , we will use here the range of @xmath153 3 to 10% mentioned above , which also seems to be supported by other recent monte carlo simulations  @xcite .",

    "the @xmath141-rays and electrons produced by x particle decay initiate electromagnetic ( em ) cascades on low energy radiation fields such as the cmb .",
    "the high energy photons undergo electron - positron pair production ( pp ; @xmath154 ) , and at energies below @xmath155 ev they interact mainly with the universal infrared and optical ( ir / o ) backgrounds , while above @xmath156 eev they interact mainly with the universal radio background ( urb ) . in the klein - nishina regime , where the cm energy is large compared to the electron mass , one of the outgoing particles usually carries most of the initial energy .",
    "this `` leading '' electron ( positron ) in turn can transfer almost all of its energy to a background photon via inverse compton scattering ( ics ; @xmath157 ) .",
    "em cascades are driven by this cycle of pp and ics .",
    "the energy degradation of the `` leading '' particle in this cycle is slow , whereas the total number of particles grows exponentially with time .",

    "similarly to photons , uhe neutrinos give rise to neutrino cascades in the primordial neutrino background via exchange of w and z bosons  @xcite .",
    "besides the secondary neutrinos which drive the neutrino cascade , the w and z decay products include charged leptons and quarks which in turn feed into the em and hadronic channels .",
    "neutrino interactions become especially significant if the relic neutrinos have masses @xmath161 in the ev range and thus constitute hot dark matter , because the z boson resonance then occurs at an uhe neutrino energy @xmath162 ev .",
    "in fact , this has been proposed as a significant source of ehecrs  @xcite .",
    "motivated by recent experimental evidence for neutrino mass we assumed a mass of 1 ev for all three neutrino flavors ( for simplicity ) and implemented the relevant w boson interactions in the t - channel and the z boson exchange via t- and s - channel .",
    "hot dark matter is also expected to cluster , potentially increasing secondary @xmath141-ray and nucleon production  @xcite .",
    "this influences mostly scenarios where x decays into neutrinos only .",

    "therefore , values of @xmath168 few mpc and @xmath169 are conceivable on the local supercluster scale  @xcite .",

    "some sensitivity to the injection spectrum index @xmath141 exists whenever events are recorded over a sufficiently broad energy range .",
    "at least if the distance @xmath255 is known , it is in general comparatively easy to rule out a hard injection spectrum if the actual @xmath307 , but much harder to distinguish between @xmath308 and 2.5 .",
    "if the lifetime of the experiment is the largest time scale involved , the strength of the magnetic field can only be obtained from the time - energy image because the angular image will not be resolvable .",
    "when the time delay dominates over the emission timescale , and is , at the same time , larger than the lifetime of the experiment , only a lower limit corresponding to this latter timescale , can be placed on the time delay and hence on the strength of the magnetic field . when combined with the faraday rotation upper limit eq .",
    "( [ newf ] ) , this would nonetheless allow one to bracket the r.m.s .",
    "magnetic field strength within a few orders of magnitude . in this case",
    "also , significant information is contained in the angular image .",
    "if the emission time scale is larger then the delay time , the angular image is obviously the only source of information on the magnetic field strength .",
    "the coherence length @xmath258 enters in the ratio @xmath300 that controls the scatter around the mean of the @xmath301 correlation in the time - energy image .",
    "it can therefore be estimated from the width of this image , provided the emission timescale is much less than @xmath295 ( otherwise the correlation would not be seen ) , and some prior information on @xmath255 and @xmath295 is available .",
    "an emission timescale much larger than the experimental lifetime may be estimated if a lower cut - off in the spectrum is observable at an energy @xmath302 , indicating that @xmath309 .",
    "the latter may , in turn , be estimated from the angular image size via eq .",

    "( [ tsscale ] ) comes from constraints on maximal time delays in cosmic magnetic fields , such as the faraday rotation limit in the case of cosmological large - scale field ( smaller number ) and knowledge on stronger fields associated with the large - scale galaxy structure ( larger number ) .",
    "( [ tsscale ] ) constitutes an interesting range of emission timescales for many conceivable scenarios of uhecrs .",
    "for example , the hot spots in certain powerful radio galaxies that have been suggested as uhecr sources  @xcite , have a size of only several kpc and could have an episodic activity on timescales of @xmath314yr .    a detailed comparison of analytical estimates for the distributions of time delays , energies , and deflection angles of nucleons in weak random magnetic fields with the results of monte carlo simulations has been presented in ref .  @xcite . in this work , deflection was simulated by solving a stochastic differential equation and observational consequences for the two major classes of source scenarios , namely continuous and impulsive uhecr production , were discussed . in agreement with earlier work",
    "@xcite it was pointed out that at least in the impulsive production scenario and for an egmf in the range @xmath315 g , as required for cosmological grb sources , there is a typical energy scale @xmath316ev below which the flux is quasi - steady due to the spread in arrival times , whereas above which the flux is intermittent with only a few sources contributing .",
    "unfortunately , neither the diffusive limit nor the limit of nearly rectilinear propagation is likely to be applicable to the propagation of uhecrs around @xmath33ev in general .",
    "this is because in magnetic fields in the range of a few @xmath317 g , values that are realistic for the supergalactic plane  @xcite , the gyro radii of charged particles is of the order of a few mpc which is comparable to the distance to the sources .",
    "an accurate , reliable treatment in this regime can only be achieved by numerical simulation .    to this end , the monte carlo simulation approach of individual trajectories developed in refs .",
    "@xcite has recently been generalized to arbitrary deflections  @xcite .",
    "the supergalactic plane was modeled as a sheet with a thickness of a few mpc and a gaussian density profile .",
    "the same statistical description for the magnetic field was adopted as in refs .",
    "@xcite , but with a field power law index @xmath318 , representing a turbulent kolmogorov type spectrum , and weighted with the sheet density profile .",
    "it should be mentioned , however , that other spectra , such as the kraichnan spectrum , corresponding to @xmath319 , are also possible .",
    "the largest mode with non - zero power was taken to be the largest turbulent eddy whose size is roughly the sheet thickness .",
    "in addition , a coherent field component @xmath320 is allowed that is parallel to the sheet and varies proportional to the density profile .",
    "when cr backreaction on the weakly turbulent magnetic field is neglected , the diffusion coefficient of cr of energy @xmath25 is determined by the magnetic field power on wavelengths comparable to the particle larmor radius , and can be approximated by @xmath321 as a consequence , for the kolmogorov spectrum , in the diffusive regime , where @xmath322 , the diffusion coefficient should scale with energy as @xmath323 for @xmath324 , and as @xmath325 in the so called bohm diffusion regime,@xmath326 .",
    "this should be reflected in the dependence of the time delay @xmath295 on energy @xmath25 : from the rectilinear regime , @xmath327 , hence at the largest energies , where @xmath328 , this should switch to @xmath329 in the regime of bohm diffusion , and eventually to @xmath330 at the smallest energies , or largest time delays .",
    "indeed , all three regimes can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] which shows an example of the distribution of arrival times and energies of uhecrs from a bursting source .",
    "the numerical results indicate an effective gyroradius that is roughly a factor 10 higher than the analytical estimate , with a correspondingly larger diffusion coefficient compared to eq .",
    "( [ danaly ] ) .",
    "in addition , the fluctuations of the resulting spectra between different magnetic field realizations can be substantial .",
    "this is a result of the fact that most of the magnetic field power is on the largest scales where there are the fewest modes .",
    "these considerations mean that the applicability of analytical flux estimates of discrete sources in specific magnetic field configurations is rather limited",
    ".    in a steady state situation , diffusion leads to a modification of the injection spectrum by roughly a factor @xmath295 , at least in the absence of significant energy loss and for a homogeneous , infinitely extended medium that can be described by a spatially constant diffusion coefficient . since in the non - diffusive regime the observed spectrum repeats the shape of the injection spectrum , a change to a flatter observed spectrum at high energies is expected in the transition region  @xcite . from the spectral point of view",
    "this suggests the possibility of explaining the observed uhecr flux above @xmath82eev including the highest energy events with only one discrete source  @xcite .",
    "angular images of discrete sources in a magnetized supercluster in principle contain information on the magnetic field structure .",
    "for the recently suggested field strengths between @xmath331 g and @xmath332 g the angular images are large enough to exploit that information with instruments of angular resolution in the degree range .",
    "an example where a transition from several images at low energies to one image at high energies allows one to estimate the magnetic field coherence scale is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] .",
    "the newest agasa data  @xcite , however , indicate an isotropic distribution of ehecr . to explain this with only one discrete source would require the magnetic fields to be so strong that the flux beyond @xmath33ev would most likely be too strongly suppressed by pion production , as discussed above",
    "the recent claim that the powerful radio galaxy centaurus a at a distance of 3.4 mpc from earth can explain both observed flux and angular distributions of uhecrs above @xmath333ev for an extragalactic magnetic field of strength @xmath334",
    "g  @xcite was based on the diffusive approximation which is clearly shown by numerical simulations not to apply in this situation ; the predicted distributions are too anisotropic even at @xmath34ev .",
    "this suggests a more continuous source distribution which may also still reproduce the observed uhecr flux above @xmath335ev with only one spectral component  @xcite .",
    "statistical studies neglecting magnetic deflection can be performed analytically and also suggest that many sources should contribute to the uhecr spectrum  @xcite .",
    "a more systematic parameter study of sky maps and spectra in uhecr in different scenarios with magnetic fields is now being pursued  @xcite .",
    "such studies will also be needed to generalize analytical considerations on correlations of uhecr arrival directions with the large scale structure of galaxies  @xcite to scenarios involving significant magnetic deflection .",
    "intriguingly , scenarios in which a diffuse source distribution follows the density in the supergalactic plane within a certain radius , can accomodate both the large scale isotropy ( by diffusion ) and the small scale clustering ( by magnetic lensing ) revealed by agasa if a magnetic field of strength @xmath336 g permeates the supercluster  @xcite .",
    "[ fig13 ] shows the distribution of arrival times and energies , the solid angle integrated spectrum , and the angular distribution of arrival directions in galactic coordinates in such a scenario where the uhecr sources with spectral index @xmath337 are distributed according to the matter density in the local supercluster , following a pancake profile with scale height of 5 mpc and scale length 20 mpc .",
    "the r.m.s .",
    "magnetic field has a kolmogorov spectrum with a maximal field strength @xmath338 g in the plane center , and also follows the matter density .",
    "the observer is within 2 mpc of the supergalactic plane whose location is indicated by the solid line in the lower panel and at a distance @xmath339mpc from the plane center .",
    "the absence of sources within 2 mpc from the observer was assumed .",
    "the transition discussed above from the diffusive regime below @xmath340ev to the regime of almost rectilinear propagation above that energy is clearly visible .",
    "detailed monte carlo simulations performed on these distributions reveal that the anisotropy decreases with increasing magnetic field strength due to diffusion and that small scale clustering increases with coherence and strength of the magnetic field due to magnetic lensing .",
    "both anisotropy and clustering also increase with the ( unknown ) source distribution radius .",
    "furthermore , the discriminatory power between models with respect to anisotropy and clustering strongly increases with exposure  @xcite .    as a result ,",
    "a diffuse source distribution associated with the supergalactic plane can explain most of the currently observed features of ultra - high energy cosmic rays at least for field strengths close to @xmath341 g .",
    "the large - scale anisotropy and the clustering predicted by this scenario will allow strong discrimination against other models with next generation experiments such as the pierre auger project .",
    "ultra - high energy cosmic rays have the potential to open a window to and act as probes of new particle physics beyond the standard model as well as processes occurring in the early universe at energies close to the grand unification scale . even if their origin will turn out to be attributable to astrophysical shock acceleration with no new physics involved",
    ", they will still be witnesses of one of the most energetic processes in the universe .",
    "furthermore , complementary to other methods such as faraday rotation measurements , ultra - high energy cosmic rays can be used as probes of the poorly known large scale cosmic magnetic fields .",
    "the future appears promising and exciting due to the anticipated arrival of several large scale experiments .",
