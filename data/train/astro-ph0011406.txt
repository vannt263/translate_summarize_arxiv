    "be / x - ray binaries are composed of a neutron star orbiting a be star and accreting from its circumstellar disc .",
    "the high - energy radiation is believed to arise due to accretion of material associated with the be star by the compact object ( see negueruela 1998 ; see also bildsten et al .",
    "some be / x - ray binaries are persistent x - ray sources ( see reig & roche 1999 ) , displaying low - luminosity ( @xmath0 ) at a relatively constant level ( varying by up to a factor of @xmath1 ) .",
    "on the other hand , most known be / x - ray binaries ( though this is probably a selection effect ) undergo periods in which the x - ray luminosity suddenly increases by a factor @xmath2 and are termed be / x - ray transients .",
    "the distinction between the two groups is difficult to establish solely on terms of the temporal behaviour , since some sources such as a1118@xmath361 and 4u1145@xmath3619 display relatively weak outbursts , though there is some evidence that the x - ray spectral properties of the two groups could be different .",
    "be / x - ray transients fall along a relatively narrow area in the @xmath4/@xmath5 diagramme ( see corbet 1986 ; waters & van kerkwijk 1989 ) , indicating that some mechanism must be responsible for the correlation .",
    "those systems with fast - spinning neutron stars do not show pulsed x - ray emission during quiescence ( though non - pulsed radiation could be caused by accretion on to the magnetosphere ) because of the centrifugal inhibition of accretion ( stella et al . 1986 ) .",
    "systems with more slowly rotating pulsars show x - ray emission at a level @xmath6 erg s@xmath7 when in quiescence .",
    "transients show two different kinds of outbursts :    * moderate intensity x - ray outbursts ( @xmath8 erg s@xmath7 ) occurring in series separated by the orbital period ( type i or normal ) , generally ( but not always ) close to the time of periastron passage of the neutron star .",
    "the duration of these outbursts seems to be related to the orbital period . *",
    "giant ( or type ii ) x - ray outbursts ( @xmath9 erg s@xmath7 ) , lasting several weeks .",
    "the parameters of these outbursts do not correlate clearly with orbital parameters , though in a0535 + 26 and 4u0115 + 63 they seem to start always a few days after periastron passage .",
    "waters et al . ( 1989 ) tried to model the x - ray luminosities of be / x - ray transients during outbursts making use of a simple wind accretion model , in which the neutron star accretes from a relatively fast radial outflow .",
    "the density in the disc of the be primary was assumed to follow a power law , as in waters ( 1986 ) model for be stars . in this scenario ,",
    "the most relevant parameter is the relative velocity between the outflow and the neutron star , since the x - ray luminosity can then be expressed as @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the mass and radius of the neutron star and @xmath13 is the mass flow . in order to explain the wide range of observed x - ray luminosities , large changes in the value of the radial velocity have to be invoked .",
    "for example , waters et al .",
    "( 1989 ) deduced that the relative velocity was @xmath14 during a type i outburst of v0332 + 53 in 1983 , while it was @xmath15 during a type ii outburst in 1973 .",
    "there is a large number of implicit assumptions in this formulation , some of which are difficult to justify , but two obvious problems stand up .",
    "the first one is the low - luminosity x - ray emission displayed by many be / x - ray transients when they are not in outburst ( for example , several detections of a0535 + 26 at luminosities of @xmath16 by motch et al .",
    "the model does not offer any explanation as to why there could be a change from quiescence to outburst , unless very large and sudden changes in the density and velocity of the flow are assumed , while optical and infrared observations do not show any sign of the large variations that would be associated with a change of several orders of magnitude in the density of material .",
    "the major objection to the model is simply the fact that there is no observational evidence whatsoever supporting the existence of such fast outflows .",
    "all observations of be discs imply bulk outflow velocities smaller than a few @xmath17 .",
    "the evidence for rotationally dominated quasi - keplerian discs around be stars is overwhelming ( see hanuschik et al .",
    "1995 ; hummel & hanuschik 1997 ) , specially due to the success of the one - armed global oscillation model to explain v / r variability in the emission lines of be stars ( see okazaki 1991 , 1997 ; papaloizou et al .",
    "1992 ; hummel & hanuschik 1997 ) .    the discovery by reig et al . ( 1997 ) of a correlation between the maximum equivalent width reached by the h@xmath18 emission line in be / x - ray binaries and their orbital period strongly suggested that the neutron star had some kind of effect on the disc of the be primary .",
    "other observational facts , such as circumstantial evidence for the discs in be / x - ray binaries being optically thicker than those of isolated be stars , added further support to this idea .",
    "this , together with the increasing evidence for quasi - keplerian discs around be stars , has prompted us to investigate whether the properties of be / x - ray binaries can be better explained if we assume that the disc surrounding the be primary is a viscous decretion disc .",
    "due to space limitations , we will not try to argue the case here , but refer the interested reader to future publications ( negueruela & okazaki 2000 ; negueruela & okazaki , in preparation ) and concentrate on the derived model .",
    "we just note that the choice of the viscous decretion disc model has been prompted by its success at explaining observational characteristics of be stars ( lee et al .",
    "1991 ; porter 1999 ; okazaki 2001 ) , but it is not a necessary condition for the majority of the conclusions below . as a matter of fact , the tidal and resonant interaction of the neutron star can effectively truncate the be star disc for any model in which the outflow velocity in the disc is subsonic .",
    "a viscous decretion disc is held by the outwards diffusion of angular momentum due to viscous interaction .",
    "this viscous torque communicates angular momentum to the outflowing material , allowing it to follow quasi - keplerian orbits .",
    "a neutron star orbiting the be star exerts a negative torque on the material which takes away angular momentum .",
    "the competing effects of viscosity and resonant torques determine the radial distance at which the disc will be truncated .",
    "the effect of the neutron star is most strongly felt at the @xmath19 commensurabilities between the orbits of the neutron star and material at that distance , and truncation is likely to take place there . for every resonance @xmath19",
    ", there is a critical value of the viscosity parameter , @xmath20 , such that if @xmath21 , the disc is truncated at that resonance .",
    "the value of @xmath20 depends on the orbital parameters of the system under consideration .",
    "[ fig : systems ] shows the values of @xmath20 that will cause truncation at a given resonance radius for a number of be / x - ray binaries .",
    "the systems have been modelled using as masses for the be primaries those corresponding to their spectral type , when accurately determined .",
    "gro j1008@xmath357 and exo2030 + 375 , were assumed to have spectral type b0v and mass @xmath22 .",
    "the orbital parameters are those determined from the analysis of doppler - shift in the pulse arrival time during x - ray observations . assuming reasonable values for the viscosity ( @xmath23 ) , we find that all systems , except gro j1008@xmath357 , will be truncated at either the @xmath24 or @xmath25 resonance radius . in all five systems ,",
    "the likely truncation radii are very close to the size of the effective roche radius at periastron .    for the systems with close orbits",
    "( 4u0115 + 63 , v0332 + 53 and exo2030 + 375 ) , the first lagrangian point @xmath26 is always further away than the @xmath25 resonance ( see figure  [ fig : vcas ] ) . in a0535 + 26 , on the other hand , @xmath27 close to periastron , while @xmath28 always .",
    "similarly , for gro j1008@xmath357 @xmath29 close to periastron , while @xmath30 always .",
    "the scenario suggested by these results is as follows . for close systems ,",
    "the truncation of the disc prevents the accretion of significant amounts of material by the neutron star .",
    "even though the truncation is not expected to be 100% effective , centrifugal inhibition of accretion for very low accretion rates ( stella et al . 1986 ) leads to the absence of quiescence x - ray luminosity . however , these systems can still present series of type i outbursts if the discs surrounding the central be stars are very disturbed . if some sort of perturbation , such as a global density wave ( okazaki 1997 ) or radiation - induced warping ( porter 1998 ) , produces an eccentric disc , then material can be accreted through @xmath26 close to periastron",
    "this situation will lead to short and irregular series of x - ray outbursts , very likely showing decreasing intensity as in the 1996 series of outbursts of 4u0115 + 63 ( negueruela et al .",
    "1998 ) .    systems with wider orbits , such as a0535 + 26 and gro j1008@xmath357 can show series of type i outbursts if the viscosity is high enough to allow the disc to extend beyond @xmath31 .",
    "small changes in the viscosity can result in the system switching on or off for relatively long periods .",
    "the outbursts in one series will be of approximately the same strength , unless some other effects are involved ( it is not clear , for example , how a mediating accretion disc could affect the mass transfer ) .",
    ".orbital and stellar parameters used in the modelling of the be / x - ray binaries considered . for references , see negueruela ( 1998 ) .",
    "the orbital parameters for gro j1008@xmath357 are based on the best fit to the batse data ( m. scott , priv . comm . ) .",
    "data marked with a ` * ' are assumed values . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "the scenario seems to reproduce well the observed properties of most of the systems . both 4u0115 + 63 and v0332 + 53 show extended periods of quiescence during which no x - ray emission at all is detected .",
    "v0332 + 53 seems to have kept a very small disc for the last @xmath32 years ( negueruela et al .",
    "the outer rim of the h@xmath18 emitting region , as determined from the peak separation , is at a distance similar to our calculation for the @xmath24 resonance .",
    "4u0115 + 63 has only once displayed a series of type i outbursts in @xmath33 years of observations and this was when the disc of the be star was very disturbed ( negueruela et al .",
    "v0332 + 53 has only displayed a series of three type i outbursts since its discovery .",
    "another source with comparable behaviour is 2s1417@xmath362 , which has similar orbital parameters .    on the other hand , a0535",
    "+ 26 shows longer series of type i outbursts as well as long periods of quiescence ( during which it displays low - luminosity x - ray emission ) .",
    "the change between these two states can be explained as a consequence of small variations in the physical conditions in the disc which result in the outer edge moving between the @xmath25 and @xmath24 resonances .",
    "it must be pointed out that the behaviour of exo2030 + 375 is very different from that predicted , since it displays very long series of type i outbursts , similar to those predicted for systems with larger eccentricities . in principle , it could be argued that this is an indication of very high viscosity ( @xmath34 ) , but we note that there is no observational knowledge about the stellar parameters of the central star , which is too heavily obscured to allow even an approximate spectral classification . the actual values for the mass and radius of the be star could be very different from those used here .",
    "an interesting consequence of the model presented above is the fact that the discs surrounding the be primaries can not reach a steady state",
    ". material , having lost the angular momentum needed to outflow , will fall back and form a dense torus close to the truncation resonance .",
    "this situation will lead to the dynamical instability of the disc , which will produce large - scale perturbations , such as warping or global density waves .",
    "such perturbations will either lead to the dispersion of the disc or settle down after some time .",
    "therefore we expect the discs to undergo cycles of reformation and dissipation and/or major perturbations and resettling .    in the case of v635 cas , the optical counterpart to 4u0115 + 63",
    ", spectroscopic monitoring has shown that the be star undergoes cycles of disc reformation , warping and dissipation with time - scales of 35 years ( see figure  [ fig : cycle ] ) .",
    "these cycles are reflected in the x - ray behaviour of the source , which has shown quasi - periodicities of @xmath35 years , associated with the main cycle , and @xmath36 months , when the perturbed disc is precessing .",
    "bq cam , the optical counterpart to v0332 + 53 , on the other hand , suffered some major perturbation around the time of its last type ii outburst in 1989 , but then settled down to a semi - steady state ( negueruela et al .",
    "unfortunately , monitoring of the optical counterparts to other sources has been very sparse .    the large perturbation in the disc of v725 tau , the optical counterpart to a0535 + 26 , which occurred at the time of its last type ii outbursts ( negueruela et al .",
    "1998 ) has led to the gradual dissipation of the circumstellar envelope ( see haigh et al . in this proceedings ) .",
    "such behaviour is reminiscent of that observed in v635 cas and is probably indicating some similarly quasi - cyclical activity on a longer time - scale .",
    "the association of large - scale perturbations and type ii outbursts in be / x - ray binaries had already been noted by negueruela et al .",
    "the observations of v635 cas showing very fast changes in the shape and width of the emission lines indicate that the circumstellar disc of this source can become warped and precess .",
    "observations from 1989 ( covering the last three cycles of disc loss and reformation ) indicate that x - ray activity occurs only after the disc is warped , showing that it is the perturbation in the disc which leads to the outburst , and not otherwise .",
    "this is perfectly consistent with the model outlined above .",
    "estimates of the accretion rates during type ii outbursts show that a significant fraction of the disc material has to be accreted by the neutron star",
    ". since the disc is truncated , accretion of large amounts of matter will only be possible if the disc has become sufficiently asymmetric and dense to overflow the truncation radius .",
    "the main advantage of the model outlined in this paper over previous ones is that it provides a global picture , though still a very sketchy one , in which the whole phenomenology of be / x - ray binaries is seen as deriving from a small set of simple physical facts .",
    "the truncation of the discs surrounding the be stars by the neutron star companions provides an explanation for the long periods of quiescence , while the dependence of the truncation radius on the physical properties of the disc gives a natural way of understanding the onset of the series of type i outbursts and their eventual disappearance .",
    "our modelling of different systems shows that in all cases the parameters involved are such that values of the viscosity in the range expected from theoretical considerations and modelling ( @xmath37 ) result in truncation at distances comparable to the size of the effective roche lobe of the be star .",
    "moreover , in all cases , small changes of the viscosity result in variations in the distance at which truncation takes place .    as a consequence of disc truncation",
    ", the circumstellar discs can not be steady , which will lead to the development of the perturbations that have been observed .",
    "when the perturbations give rise to large asymmetries in the density distribution , the truncation mechanism will be much less effective and large amounts of material will be able to make their way to the neutron star , producing the giant type ii outbursts ."
