    "as pointed out in a recent paper by irvine and bouwmeester @xcite , electromagnetic knots are exact solutions of the classical maxwell equations of electromagnetism in vacuum .",
    "they appeared firstly in a paper by raada @xcite in 1989 .",
    "raada himself @xcite has used these solutions as the basic elements of a topological model of electromagnetism which is locally equivalent to maxwell s standard theory but implies furthermore some topological quantization conditions with interesting physical meaning @xcite .",
    "electromagnetic knots are defined through two fundamental complex scalar fields @xmath0 whose level curves coincide with the magnetic and electric lines respectively , each one of these lines being labelled by the constant value of the corresponding scalar .",
    "both scalars are assumed to have only one value at infinity , which is equivalent to compactify the physical three - space to the sphere @xmath1 .",
    "moreover , the complex plane is compactified to the sphere @xmath2 via stereographic projection . as a result of such compactifications ,",
    "the scalars @xmath3 and @xmath4 can be interpreted , at any time , as maps @xmath5 , which can be classified in homotopy classes , characterized by the value of the hopf index @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "it can be shown that the two scalars have the same hopf index and that the magnetic and the electric lines are generically linked with the same gauss linking number @xmath7 .",
    "if @xmath8 is the multiplicity of the level curves ( i.e. the number of different magnetic or electric lines that have the same label @xmath3 or @xmath4 ) , then the hopf index of both scalars is @xmath9 .",
    "the hopf index can thus be interpreted as a generalized linking number if we define a line as a level curve with @xmath8 disjoint components .",
    "an important feature of the model is that the faraday 2-form @xmath10 and its dual @xmath11 are proportional to the two pull - backs of @xmath12 , the area 2-form in @xmath2 , by @xmath3 and @xmath4 , @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a constant introduced so that the magnetic and electric fields have correct dimensions and @xmath15 is the velocity of light in vacuum . in the international system of units , @xmath14 can be expressed as a pure number times the planck constant @xmath16 times the light velocity @xmath15 times the vacuum permeability @xmath17 . as a consequence of the definitions ( [ pullback ] ) ,",
    "the maps @xmath3 and @xmath4 are dual to one another , @xmath18 , where * is the hodge or duality operator",
    ". this duality condition guarantees that both @xmath19 and @xmath20 obey the maxwell equations in empty space without the need of any other requirement .",
    "the electromagnetic fields obtained in this way are called electromagnetic knots .",
    "they are radiation fields as they verify the condition @xmath21 .",
    "it can be proved ( see @xcite for the details ) that any radiation field in vacuum is locally equivalent to an electromagnetic knot . moreover , because of the darboux theorem , any electromagnetic field in empty space can be expressed locally as the sum of two radiation fields .",
    "consequently , a model of electromagnetism based on these electromagnetic knots is locally equivalent to maxwell standard theory .",
    "however , its difference from the global point of view has interesting consequences , as are the following topological quantizations : ( i ) the electric charge of any point particle must necessarily be equal to an integer multiple of the fundamental value @xmath22 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "( ii ) the electromagnetic helicity @xmath23 is also quantized @xcite , where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the classical expressions of the number of right- and left - handed photons contained in the field ( i.e. @xmath26 , @xmath27 being fourier transforms of the vector potential @xmath28 in the classical theory , but creation and annihilation operator in the quantum version ) .",
    "in fact , for any electromagnetic knot , @xmath29 , which is a remarkable relation between the hopf index ( i.e. the generalized linking number ) of the classical field and the classical case of the difference @xmath30 .",
    "( iii ) the topology of the model implies also the quantization of the energy of the electromagnetic field in a cavity @xcite .",
    "( iv ) electromagnetic knots are compatible with the quantization of the magnetic flux of a superconducting ring @xcite , which in standard theory is always an integer multiple of @xmath31 , @xmath32 being the value of the magnetic monopole .    in this work",
    "we study a classical charged particle in a knotted electromagnetic field .",
    "we find that the particles can accelerate to light velocity .",
    "we first revise the construction and some physical propeties of the electromagnetic field built from the hopf map between the compactified three - space ( the sphere @xmath1 ) and the compactified complex plane ( the sphere @xmath2 ) .",
    "in particular , we pay attention to the electromagnetic energy density and how it evolves with time and introduce a mean quadratic radius of the energy density .",
    "then we consider the relativistic motion of electrons in this electromagnetic field .",
    "we study the trajectories of the electrons and their velocities , showing that they become ultrarelativistic for a wide range of the electromagnetic energy of the knot .",
    "finally we give some conclusions and prospects of future work .",
    "a method to find explicitly some electromagnetic knots can be found in @xcite .",
    "let @xmath33 , @xmath34 , two complex scalar fields such that can be considered as maps @xmath35 after identifying the physical space @xmath36 with @xmath1 and the complex plane with @xmath2 .",
    "they have to satisfy the following two conditions :    \\1 .",
    "the level curves of @xmath37 must be orthogonal , in each point , to the level curves of @xmath38 , since we know that electromagnetic knots are radiation fields ( @xmath39 ) .    \\2 .",
    "the hopf index of @xmath37 and of @xmath38 are equal , @xmath40 .",
    "this is necessary to ensure that the condition @xmath21 is maintained during time evolution .",
    "given @xmath37 and @xmath38 with this two conditions , we can build the magnetic and electric fields at @xmath41 as @xmath42 it is convenient to work with dimensionless coordinates in the mathematical spacetime @xmath43 , and in @xmath2 . in order to do that",
    ", we define the dimensionless coordinates @xmath44 , related to the physical ones @xmath45 ( in the si of units that we will use in this work ) by @xmath46 and @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is a constant with length dimensions .",
    "now , let us consider the hopf map , @xmath49 whose fibres are been used as a basis for a case of knotted entanglement in reaction - diffusion models , in particular for a fitzhugh - nagumo model @xcite .",
    "we also consider the map corresponding to the change @xmath50 in ( [ 11.19 ] ) , @xmath51 because of their construction , it is obvious that both maps ( [ 11.19 ] ) and ( [ 11.20 ] ) have the same hopf index .",
    "in fact , these maps have hopf index @xmath52 and their fibrations are mutually orthogonal at each point .",
    "consequently , we can build an electromagnetic knot from these maps .",
    "the cauchy data for the magnetic and electric fields are @xmath53 from ( [ 11.27 ] ) , two vector potentials @xmath54 and @xmath55 can be computed , such that @xmath56 , @xmath57 , with the results @xmath58 the magnetic and electric helicities of this knot are defined to be @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the vacuum permittivity . taking into account the cauchy data ( [ 11.27 ] ) and the potentials ( [ 11.28 ] ) , the electromagnetic helicity yields @xmath61 to find the electromagnetic knot at any time from the cauchy data ( [ 11.27 ] ) , we use fourier analysis .",
    "the fields turn out to be @xcite , @xmath62 where the quantities @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 are defined by @xmath66 and the vectors @xmath67 and @xmath68 are @xmath69 this solution fulfills now @xmath70 and @xmath71 at any time .",
    "it is possible to obtain directly the electromagnetic field ( [ 11.35 ] ) from the time - dependent expressions ( [ pullback ] ) . in terms of the magnetic and the electric fields",
    ", we have @xmath72 where the time - dependent expressions of the maps @xmath3 and @xmath4 are ( see @xcite ) @xmath73 note that the level curves of both maps @xmath3 and @xmath4 remain linked with a gauss linking number equal to 1 .",
    "the evolution of the curved lines of these maps gives the evolution of the force lines of the magnetic and electric fields given by the expressions ( [ timeeb ] ) .",
    "the energy density of the electromagnetic field ( [ 11.35 ] ) is given by , @xmath74 the maximum of the energy density is located at @xmath75 during time evolution .",
    "the function @xmath76 is symmetric in the coordinates @xmath77 and @xmath78 . in figure",
