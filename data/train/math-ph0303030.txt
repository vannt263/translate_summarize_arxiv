    "it is well known that in quantum field theory under external conditions , quantities like vacuum energies and effective actions , which describe the influence of boundaries or external fields on the physical system , are generically divergent and require a renormalization to get a physical meaning .    in this context , a powerful and elegant regularization scheme to deal with these problems is based on the use of the @xmath1-function @xcite or the heat - kernel ( for recent reviews see , for example , @xcite ) associated to the relevant differential operators appearing in the quadratic part of the actions . in this way , ground state energies , heat - kernel coefficients , functional determinants and partition functions for quantum fields can be given in terms of the corresponding @xmath1-function , where the ultraviolet divergent pieces of the one - loop contributions are encoded as poles of its holomorphic extension .",
    "thus , it is of major interest in physics to determine the singularity structure of @xmath1-functions associated with these physical models .    in particular @xcite , for an elliptic boundary value problem in a @xmath3-dimensional compact manifold with boundary , described by a differential operator @xmath4 of order @xmath5 , with smooth coefficients and a ray of minimal growth , defined on a domain of functions subject to local boundary conditions",
    ", the @xmath1-function @xmath6 has a meromorphic extension to the complex @xmath7-plane whose singularities are isolated simple poles at @xmath8 , with @xmath9    in the case of positive definite operators , the @xmath1-function is related , via mellin transform , to the trace of the heat - kernel of the problem , and the pole structure of @xmath10 determines the small-@xmath11 asymptotic expansion of this trace @xcite : @xmath12 where the coefficients are related to the residues by @xmath13    for operators @xmath14 with a singular potential @xmath15 asymptotic to @xmath16 as @xmath17 , this expansion is substantially different . if @xmath18 , the operator is essentially self - adjoint .",
    "this case has been treated in @xcite , where log terms are found , as well as terms with coefficients which are distributions concentrated at the singular point @xmath19 . for the case",
    "@xmath20 , the friedrichs extension has been treated in @xcite for operators in @xmath21 , and in @xcite for operators in @xmath22 .    on the other hand ,",
    "reference @xcite gave the pole structure of the @xmath1-function of a second order differential operator defined on the ( non compact ) half - line @xmath23 , having a singular zero - th order term given by @xmath24 .",
    "it showed that , for a certain range of real values of @xmath25 , this operator admits nontrivial self - adjoint extensions in @xmath22 , for which the associated @xmath1-function presents isolated simple poles which ( in general ) do not lie at @xmath26 for @xmath27 , and can even take irrational values .",
    "a similar structure has been noticed in @xcite for the singularities of the @xmath1-function of a system of first order differential operators in the half line , appearing in a model of supersymmetric quantum mechanics with a singular superpotential @xmath28 .",
    "let us mention that singular potentials @xmath29 have been considered in the description of several physical systems , like the calogero model @xcite , conformal invariant quantum mechanical models @xcite and , more recently , the dynamics of quantum particles in the asymptotic near - horizon region of black - holes @xcite .",
    "moreover , singular superpotentials has been considered as possible agents of supersymmetry breaking in models of supersymmetric quantum mechanics @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "it is the aim of the present article to analyze the behavior of the resolvent and @xmath1 and @xmath2-functions of a system of first order differential operators with a regular singularity in a compact segment , admitting a family of self - adjoint extensions .",
    "we will show that the asymptotic expansion for the resolvent in the general case presents powers of @xmath0 which depend on the singularity , and can take even irrational values .",
    "the consequence of this behavior on the corresponding @xmath1 and @xmath2-functions is the presence of simple poles lying at points which also depend on the singularity , with residues depending on the self - adjoint extension considered .",
    "we first construct the resolvents for two particular extensions , for which the boundary condition at the singular point @xmath19 is invariant under the scaling @xmath30 .",
    "the resolvent expansion for these special extensions displays the usual powers , leading to the usual poles for the @xmath1-function .",
    "the resolvents of the remaining extensions are convex linear combinations of these special extensions , but the coefficients in the convex combination depend on the eigenvalue parameter @xmath0 .",
    "this dependence leads to unusual powers in the resolvent expansion , and hence to unusual poles for the zeta - function .",
    "these self - adjoint extensions are not invariant under the scaling @xmath31 ; as @xmath32 they tend ( at least formally ) to one of the invariant extensions , and as @xmath33 they tend to the other . as @xmath34 the residues at the anomalous poles tend to zero , whereas as @xmath33 these residues become infinite . the way these residues depend on the boundary condition is explained by a scaling argument in section 7 .",
    "the structure of the article is as follows : in section [ the - operator ] we define the operator and determine its self - adjoint extensions , and in section [ the - spectrum ] we study their spectra . in section [ the - resolvent ]",
    "we construct the resolvent for a general extension as a linear combination of the resolvent of two limiting cases , and in section [ trace - resolvent ] we consider the traces of these operators .",
    "the asymptotic expansion of these traces , evaluated in section [ asymptotic - expansion ] , is used in section [ spectral - functions ] to construct the associated @xmath1 and @xmath2-functions and study their singularities .    finally , in section [",
