    "the problem of charge transport through an inhomogeneous system ( e.g. , a dielectric junction between two metallic leads ) continues to attract considerable attention from both purely theoretical and practical points of view .",
    "it is especially interesting in the case of a one - dimensional ( 1d ) junction where the interaction ( electron - electron or electron - phonon ) drastically changes the system properties .",
    "the most studied example is a 1d quantum metallic wire connected to 2d electron reservoirs .",
    "it is known that the low energy properties of electrons in the wire can be described by the luttinger liquid ( ll ) model.@xcite since electrons do not propagate freely in a ll , a nontrivial problem arises : how are conduction electrons converted into propagating charged excitations at the metal - ll boundary ?",
    "a few years ago , it was shown @xcite that , for adiabatic contacts ( i.e. , when all the inhomogeneities are smooth on a scale of the electron fermi length ) , the dc conductance of a pure quantum wire is perfect , @xmath0 , and temperature independent ( the factor of two accounts for spin degeneracy ) .",
    "this result is not surprising since electrons coming from the leads are not backscattered by the effective barrier represented by the ll piece of the wire .",
    "the linear conductance , according to the landauer - bttiker approach,@xcite should then be equal to the conductance quantum @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , the dc conductance of a pure quantum wire in adiabatic contact with source and drain leads is not renormalized by the interaction .",
    "the electron - electron interaction does affect the current - voltage characteristics of a ll junction if either impurities are present @xcite or electrons are backscattered by umklapp ( u)-processes .",
    "u - processes lead , as a rule , to the formation of a gap in the spectrum of charged excitations and in this case one may consider the junction as a _ dielectric _ wire .    recently , ponomarenko and nagaosa @xcite studied electron transport through a _ finite _ mott - hubbard dielectric . by mapping the problem at low temperatures onto the quantum impurity problem in an",
    "_ infinite _ ll ( the so - called kane - fisher problem @xcite ) they obtained a surprising result : the conductance of a finite - length correlated dielectric , adiabatically connected to metallic leads equals , at @xmath2 , the conductance of a perfect metal junction @xmath1 .",
    "however , an exponentially small conductivity , typical of a tunnel junction , is restored already at very small temperatures @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the mott - hubbard gap and @xmath5 ( @xmath6 is the length of dielectric and @xmath7 is the velocity of the charged excitations ) .",
    "this result was later generalized @xcite to the transport of fractional charge through a finite - length correlated dielectric .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to consider the electron transport through a junction formed by a peierls - frhlich dielectric where a charge density wave ( cdw ) is present .",
    "the problem of conversion of electronic current into cdw current at the boundary metal - peierls dielectric was studied for the first time over a decade ago.@xcite in ref .",
    "( see also ref .  )",
    "the peierls dielectric was treated in the so - called adiabatic approximation , when the dynamics of the electrons is considered for a fixed phonon field ( the order parameter ) , which is found self - consistently ( for a review , see refs .   and ) . for an order parameter with a time - independent phase",
    ", the transport problem can be reduced to solving the bogoliubov - de gennes equation for the electron wave function in the piecewise constant effective field of the order parameter .",
    "the calculations are very close to those for a metal - superconductor junction .",
    "there is only one important difference : while in a superconductor the condensate wave function is formed by two particles with opposite momenta , in a peierls state the corresponding spinor consists of a particle and a hole with momenta differing by @xmath8 . as a result , the scattering of particles on the off - diagonal barrier produced by the order parameter is not of the andreev type.@xcite for electrons in the metallic leads with energies inside the gap there is always a strong backscattering .",
    "it is then evident that the quasiparticle contribution to the conduction will be exponentially small , @xmath9 , for temperatures and voltages less than @xmath10 ( @xmath10 is the peierls gap at @xmath2).@xcite    one should not forget , however , that there exists another channel for charge transport in peierls - frhlich systems .",
    "namely , the electronic current coming from the metallic leads can be converted into a cdw current which freely propagates through the junction .",
    "the process of conversion is perfect when it involves an incommensurate cdw and the contacts between the peierls dielectric and the metallic leads are adiabatic.@xcite in other words , when the phase degree of freedom of the order parameter in the peierls dielectric is correctly treated , one finds that the conductance of an impurity - free adiabatic cdw junction is perfect at low temperatures .",
    "this result was proved in refs .   and using different approaches .    in ref .",
    "we related the property of perfect conductance of an incommensurate cdw junction to the existence of an anomalous chiral symmetry in the system . in this paper",
    "we focus our attention instead on the commensurate case , when the electron filling factor is a rational number and no chiral symmetry exists .",
    "we show that quantum fluctuations make the conductance of a commensurate , finite peierls dielectric perfect at @xmath2 , much in analogy to the case of a mott - hubbard dielectric.@xcite as temperature is increased , however , the conductance rapidly decreases ( we call this the instanton regime of quantum transport ) .",
    "the perfect conductance is lost at temperatures @xmath11 , where @xmath12 , @xmath13 is the velocity of the cdw , and @xmath14 is the rest energy of quantum cdw solitons . for higher temperatures , quantum phase fluctuations",
    "are suppressed and the conductance scales approximately as @xmath15 , reaching a global minimum value @xmath16 at temperatures @xmath17 .",
    "a further increase of temperature induces the appearance of fractionally charged solitons which dominate the conduction in the system ( we call this the soliton regime of quantum transport ) .",
    "thus , at temperatures @xmath18 the conductance sharply increases , saturating at the value @xmath19 ( @xmath20 is the commensurability index ) , which also corresponds to a perfect transport , but of fractionally charged solitons ( @xmath21 ) instead of bare electrons .",
    "this step - like behavior in @xmath22 terminates at @xmath23 , where the conductance rapidly reaches the pure metallic value @xmath1 .",
    "it is important to remark that the mott - hubbard and the peierls - frhlich systems are not identical .",
    "there are two energy scales in the latter which are not present in the former .",
    "these scales are the phonon energy @xmath24 ( here @xmath25 denotes the frequency of the phonons with momentum @xmath26 ) and the rest energy @xmath27 of quantum solitons of the commensurate cdw . in principle , the existence of these additional scales could lead to a more complicated temperature dependence of the conductance than that found in refs .   and .",
    "however , we will argue that the phonon energy scale , in particular , does not lead to any new features .",
