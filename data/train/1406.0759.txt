    "@xcite this fast decay rate results in the interaction being very short ranged and any method of amplifying the coupling to extend its range could prove useful for both the experimental detection of the rkky interaction and future spintronic applications .",
    "the sign of the coupling , which determines the ferromagnetic ( fm ) or antiferromagnetic ( afm ) alignment of the moments , should oscillate as a function of their separation , but in graphene this is masked by the coincidence of the fermi surface and brillouin zone .",
    "this causes the sign of the coupling , within the rkky interaction , to depend only on whether the two moments occupy the same or opposite sublattices .",

    "one such study looks at how the controlled growth of a line of defects in graphene can be used for gate - tunable valley filtering@xcite , while another study looks at how tm - nanowires results in long - range magnetic order and magnetic anisotropy in graphyne.@xcite    the possibility and ease of depositing a line of magnetic impurities in graphene has increased with the recent work of duesberg et al.@xcite in these works the electronic structure of graphene is altered via folding - sometimes called graphene origami .",
    "this folding is achieved by depositing the graphene over a corrugated surface which , in conjunction with an applied magnetic field , has recently been shown to open a bandgap in graphene.@xcite the ridges created during this process act as traps for magnetic impurities and open up the possibility of depositing impurities in straight parallel lines .",

    "we start by introducing the general formalism used to calculate the magnetic coupling , which is written entirely in terms of the real - space single - particle green s functions ( gfs ) of the host graphene sheet .",
    "we show in a mathematically transparent manner how the standard coupling equation may be modified to calculate the rkky interaction between two infinite lines of impurities .",
    "we find that the interaction of finite lines of impurities quickly tends towards the interaction of infinite lines , and that the reduced dimensionality of the system leads to smaller decay rates and longer ranged interactions .",

    "the coupling is represented as a sum of terms over @xmath73 , with decay rates that increase as @xmath74 .",
    "the decay rate is therefore determined by the first non - zero term in the series , as subsequent terms decay much more rapidly .",

    "[ fig : coupling2 ] we compare the coupling with the expected value of its decay rate at several fermi energies .",
    "we find that for values of the fermi energy not equal to zero @xmath79 that our theoretical predictions hold . at precisely @xmath80 , corresponding to an undoped graphene sheet , the analytical approximation no longer holds and a faster decay rate of @xmath81 is found .",
    "this difference of behaviour at the dirac point is a hallmark of such interactions in graphene and is also seen for the single impurity case .",

    "these cases produced similar results to the initial case examined above in both coupling decay rate and the convergence of finite lines to the infinite case .",

    "aligning all the layers with an applied magnetic field can lead to markedly different transmission probabilities and a resulting change in the resistance of the system@xcite .",
