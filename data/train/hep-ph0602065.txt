    "in recent years , the interest in degenerate fermionic systems has considerably increased . in part , this was driven by a substantial progress in experimental studies of trapped cold gases of fermionic atoms @xcite . by making use of various techniques , it has become possible to prepare atomic systems of different composition , temperature , density , and coupling strength of the interaction . because of such a flexibility , the basic knowledge gained in these studies is likely to be of immense value also outside the realm of atomic physics .",
    "for example , the knowledge of the ground state of an asymmetric mixture of two atomic species can shed light on the physical properties of strongly interacting dense quark matter that may exist in stars .",
    "it is conjectured that the baryon density in the central regions of compact ( neutron ) stars is sufficiently high for crushing nucleons ( and strange baryons if there are any ) into deconfined quark matter .",
    "the ground state of such matter is expected to be a color superconductor @xcite .",
    "( for reviews on color superconductivity , see ref .",
    "@xcite . ) at high density the energetically preferred phase is the so - called color - flavor - locked ( cfl ) phase @xcite . at densities of relevance for compact stars , however , the situation is much less clear .",
    "the difficulties in predicting the ground state of dense quark matter are related to the fact that the conditions of charge neutrality and @xmath0 equilibrium in a macroscopic bulk of matter such as the core of a compact star have a disruptive effect on quark cooper pairing @xcite .",
    "for example , as emphasized in ref .",
    "@xcite , enforcing charge neutrality can result in unconventional forms of superconductivity , such as the gapless 2-flavor color - superconducting ( g2sc ) phase .",
    "a 3-flavor version , the so - called gapless color - flavor - locked phase ( gcfl ) , was also proposed @xcite . while it was argued that both types of gapless phases are ( chromo-)magnetically unstable @xcite ( for the non - relativistic case , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , there exist convincing arguments that unconventional cooper pairing in one form or another is unavoidable @xcite . by taking into account the general observation of refs .",
    "@xcite that the role of gapless phases diminishes with increasing coupling strength , one may naively conclude that gapless phases do not exist in the regime of strong coupling . in this paper , we show that this conclusion is premature : not only do such phases exist , but they can even be magnetically stable .",
    "since the qcd coupling becomes strong at low densities , one may conjecture that quark matter undergoes bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) of diquarks rather than forming the usual cooper pairs of the bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) type @xcite .",
    "if this is indeed the case , one may observe well - pronounced diquark - pair fluctuations in the vicinity of the critical temperature @xcite and/or the formation of a pseudogap phase @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is of interest to study cooper pairing in the strongly coupled regime in more detail .    in this paper , we address the issue of the existence of stable gapless phases in a strongly coupled system of two species of massive fermions .",
    "( for a related study , based on an effective low - energy description , see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) . to keep the discussion as simple and as general as possible ,",
    "we consider a model with a local interaction that describes two fermion species with equal masses , but with non - equal chemical potentials .",
    "we find that gapless phases with either one or two effective fermi surfaces can exist at strong coupling .",
    "these phases are stable in the sense that they are free of ( chromo-)magnetic instabilities @xcite .",
    "it is expected that many results of our analysis should remain qualitatively similar also in the more complicated case of non - equal masses .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we briefly introduce the model and set up the notation . in sec .",
    "[ phase diagram ] , we present the zero - temperature phase diagram in the plane of the average chemical potential and the coupling constant for several values of the mismatch between the fermion chemical potentials . this diagram , while obtained in the mean - field ( mf ) approximation and , thus , not completely reliable at strong coupling , reveals a very interesting feature : it has regions of gapless phases that are free of the sarma instability @xcite _ without _ imposing the neutrality condition .",
    "note that this is drastically different from the situation at weak coupling , where the absence of such an instability is mainly due to charge neutrality @xcite , or other types of constraints on the system @xcite . in sec .",
    "[ meissner ] , we calculate the screening masses , defined by the long - wavelength limit of the static particle - number current - current correlator , and reveal a region of parameters ( generally at strong coupling ) for which gapless superconductivity is stable .",
    "the discussion of the results and conclusions are given in sec .",
    "[ conclusion ] .",
    "let us start by introducing the lagrangian density of the model , @xmath1 where @xmath2 denotes the dirac field which has two internal degrees of freedom , called `` flavors '' in the following .",
    "in general , the mass is a diagonal matrix of the form @xmath3 . for simplicity ,",
    "however , we restrict ourselves to the case of equal fermion masses , i.e. , we use @xmath4 in this paper . no constraints on the values of the chemical potentials of the two flavors of fermions are imposed , i.e. , @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 need not be equal .    in order to study superfluidity / superconductivity that results from cooper pairing of different flavors of fermions , we introduce the following local interaction term to the lagrangian density , @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the coupling constant , @xmath10 is the ( symmetric ) pauli matrix in flavor space , and @xmath11 is the charge conjugation matrix .",
    "this term describes a cross - flavor attractive interaction between fermions that can drive the formation of spin - zero ( and , therefore , totally antisymmetric ) cooper pairs at weak coupling , or even cause the appearance of localized bound states at strong coupling . at sufficiently low temperature",
    ", these bosonic states should form a condensate in the ground state .",

    "the critical chemical potential @xmath45 becomes smaller and the lines of first - order phase transitions terminate at endpoints .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the endpoints lie completely inside the region of the superconducting phase when @xmath48 and @xmath41 . in the case @xmath48",
    ", one can see this more clearly from the insertion in the lower left corner of fig .",
    "[ fig : mu - g_t0 ] . in the case",
    "@xmath40 , however , the corresponding endpoint lies on the phase boundary between normal and superconducting matter , or so close to it that our numerical resolution is not sufficient to make a distinction .    across the boundary of a second - order phase transition",
    ", the gap @xmath13 must be continuous .",
    "this means that the gap assumes arbitrarily small values just above the thin solid lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : mu - g_t0 ] .",
    "when the mismatch between the chemical potentials @xmath56 is non - zero , there inevitably exists a region adjacent to the transition line where @xmath57 . from fig .",
    "[ fig : del - mu ] we see that this is a necessary condition to have a gapless phase , and this is precisely what we observe in fig .",
    "[ fig : mu - g_t0 ] .",
    "it is , however , not a sufficient condition : if @xmath55 is sufficiently small , we could also have a gapped phase , as seen to the left of the gsc(1 ) region in fig .",
    "[ fig : del - mu ] .    the gapless phases in fig .",
    "[ fig : mu - g_t0 ] correspond to global minima of the effective potential and , thus , they are free of the sarma instability @xcite",

    "[ fig : del - mu ] , this path is shown as a dashed line .",
    "the region to the right of this line is not accessible in the mf analysis . as a consequence , the only gapless phases appearing in the phase diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig : mu - g_t0 ] are those of type gsc(1 ) .",
    "this excludes , therefore , possible ground states that correspond to the gsc(2 ) region as well as the splitting point s. in fact , the statement regarding the splitting point can be made rigorous by noting that the second derivative of the effective potential @xmath59 is negative at s , meaning that this point can not be a minimum of @xmath60 . of course",

    "our calculations show that @xmath68 is positive definite in the whole of plane of @xmath24 and @xmath25 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : del - mu ] .",
    "however , the magnetic screening mass @xmath44 could be imaginary ( i.e. , @xmath69 ) in some cases when @xmath56 is nonzero . in general , an imaginary result for @xmath44",

    "[ fig : mass ] .",

    "[ fig : del - mu ] , this is satisfied in parts of the sc and gsc(1 ) regions , giving rise to gapped and gapless phases , respectively . while the number densities of the two species of fermions are equal in the former , there is an excess of one of the species in the latter .",
    "in fact , this excess is an order parameter that defines the gapless phases at zero temperature @xcite .",
    "the gapless bec phase is a mixture of tightly - bound bosons in the form of a condensate and additional unpaired fermions @xcite .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the gapless phase of the gsc(1 ) type could also exist for a range of parameters when @xmath102 . in this case ,",
    "stable bosons do not exist and , thus , the bec regime can not be realized .",
    "if the diquark coupling in quark matter is sufficiently strong , this gapless phase can potentially be realized as the ground state of baryon matter .",
    "our analysis of the one - loop fermion contribution to the current - current correlator suggests that the gsc(1 ) phase is stable . in the case of",
    "quark matter , however , it might be important to check if the inclusion of gluon and ghost contributions does not change the conclusion . while such contributions are negligible in the weak - coupling limit , this may not be the case at strong coupling .",
    "a few words are in order regarding non - relativistic models @xcite . in our analysis",
    ", we saw that purely relativistic effects due to the antiparticle - antiparticle loops were always small near the splitting point .",
    "this suggests strongly that our results should remain qualitatively the same also in the non - relativistic limit that is defined by @xmath103 , @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "indeed , these conditions define a narrow area around the vertical line @xmath106 in fig .",
    "[ fig : del - mu ] which includes the point s. in fact , this also suggests that the topology around the splitting point is the same in both relativistic and non - relativistic models .    _ note added . _",
    "while finishing this paper , we learned that a similar study in a non - relativistic model is done by e.  gubankova , a.  schmitt , and f.  wilczek @xcite .",
