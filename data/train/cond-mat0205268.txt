    "however , not much attention was given to the _ validity of this assumption_. since @xmath1 is equal to 0 or @xmath2 for the closed interferometer , and deviates from these values for the open one , it is clear that @xmath1 _ must _ depend on the details of _ how the system was opened_. indeed , ref .",
    "@xcite considered one example of an open interferometer , and showed that the deviation of @xmath1 from its trivial values ( 0 and @xmath2 ) increases monotonically with the strength of the coupling to the  lossy \" channel .",

    "@xcite : to have @xmath24 , the electron must cross each branch only once .",
    "one necessary condition for this was appreciated qualitatively before @xcite : the electron must practically never be reflected from the  forks \" where the ring meets the incoming and outgoing terminals , in order to recover the two - slit result ( [ 2slit ] ) . in our model , this is achieved by having a very small net transmission after crossing each of the additional  lossy \" channels @xmath30 and @xmath31 in fig .",
    "[ ab](b ) . however , we find two additional conditions : first , the transmission through the upper branch , @xmath32 , should have the same phase ( up to a @xmath4-independent additive constant ) as @xmath12 , i.e. @xmath0 . in general , the scattering of the electron from the gates into channels @xmath33 and @xmath34 might cause  rattling \" of the electron back and forth through the qd , introducing more phase shifts into @xmath32 .",
    "we avoid that by also having a very _ small reflection _ from the scatterers @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "below we introduce a parameter , @xmath35 , which relates to the tunneling probabilities of the electron from the ring onto the  lossy \" channels . as @xmath35 increases , the transmission through the  lossy \" scatterers decreases , but the reflection from them increases . therefore , there is only an _ intermediate _ range of @xmath35 where @xmath24 ( shown in the lower left box in fig .",
    "[ ziur ] ) .",
    "the second new condition is that there should be no direct losses from the qd itself ; as explained below , these  smear \" the  phase lapses \" . in sec .",
    "v we discuss these results , and propose additional experiments which would check if an open interferometer indeed reproduces the desired  intrinsic \" qd information .",
    "as in many earlier calculations@xcite , our analytic calculations are based on the single - electron tight - binding model ( which can be viewed as a finite difference version of the continuum case ) : the system is made of discrete sites @xmath36 , with nearest neighbor ( nn ) real tunneling amplitudes @xmath37 and site energies @xmath38 .",
    "all nn distances are set equal to @xmath39 .",
    "the schrdinger wave equation is thus written as @xmath40 , where the sum is over nn s of @xmath41 . in each calculation",

    "the calculation of the transmission and reflection amplitudes , @xmath47 and @xmath48 , then amounts to solving a finite set of linear equations for the wave functions inside the scatterer .",
    "the qd may be described as a single dot , with many discrete energy levels .",

    "the  gap \" @xmath60 can be viewed as the hartree energy for an electron added to a qd which already has @xmath61 other electrons@xcite , thus capturing some aspects of the * coulomb blockade * behavior of the scattered electron .",
    "we study @xmath12 as function of the energy @xmath4 , which represents the plunger gate voltage on the qd .",
    "[ alpha ] shows typical results for the transmission @xmath6 and for the  intrinsic \" phase @xmath0 , where the zero of @xmath0 is set at its ( @xmath62dependent ) value at large negative @xmath4 . in this figure and below ,",
    "we choose @xmath63 , so that @xmath64 and the resonances of the transmission , where @xmath65 , occur exactly when @xmath66 , i.e. when @xmath67 @xcite .",
    "results are not sensitive to @xmath43 near the band center .",
    "we also use the simple symmetric case , @xmath68 , and measure all energies in units of @xmath69 .",
    "interestingly , this model reproduces the apparently observed behavior of @xmath0 : it grows smoothly from 0 to @xmath2 as @xmath70 crosses @xmath71 , and exhibits a sharp  phase lapse \" from @xmath2 to 0 between neighboring resonances , at points where @xmath72 .",
    "these latter points , associated with zeroes of @xmath73 , represent fano - like destructive interference between the states on the qd @xcite .",
    "many earlier theoretical ( e.g. @xcite ) and experimental ( e.g. @xcite ) papers approximated @xmath47 by a sum of the single resonance breit - wigner - like ( bw ) expressions@xcite , @xmath74/j}. \\label{bw}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] although this form gives an excellent approximation for @xmath12 near each resonance , it completely misses the fano - like zeroes and the  phase lapses \" between resonances .",
    "this happens because the approximation moves the zeroes off the real energy axis@xcite . as a result ,",
    "the approximate @xmath0 never reaches 0 or @xmath2 , and exhibits a smooth decrease from a maximum to a minimum near the correct  phase lapse \" values of @xmath4 . since our aim here is to check on accurate measurements of the  intrinsic \" phase , for a broad range of the parameters , and since the phase lapse has been a topic of much recent discussion @xcite , we prefer to use the exact solutions everywhere .",
    "this is particularly important since typically , available experimental data @xcite show quite broad resonances , so that the bw approximation is bound to fail between them .",
    "we emphasize again : in spite of the close similarity of our  intrinsic \" transmission results with the experiments , the purpose of this paper is not to relate the calculated @xmath12 to the experimental systems .",
    "this would require a justification for our choice of the same @xmath75 s and @xmath76 s for all the resonances , which goes beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "rather , we aim to check when the ab interferometer reproduces the  input \" behavior of the qd , by yielding @xmath24 for all @xmath4 .",
    "if this fails for our simple model then it would surely fail in the more complicated cases , where electron - electron interactions ( beyond our simple hartree approximation ) become important @xcite .",
    "we next place the above qd on the upper branch of the closed ab interferometer , as shown in fig .",
    "[ ab](a ) .",
    "we now treat the whole ring as our scatterer : each segment @xmath77 on the ring is modeled by a 1d tight binding model of @xmath78 sites , with @xmath79 and @xmath80 ( @xmath81 for the left and right upper segments and for the lower path , respectively ) .",
    "taking advantage of gauge invariance , we attach the ab phase factor @xmath82 to the hopping amplitude from the right hand  fork \" onto its nn on branch @xmath48 , which we write as @xmath83 . writing the wave functions in segment @xmath77 as @xmath84 , with @xmath85 given by @xmath86 , it is easy to express the total transmission and reflection amplitudes through the interferometer , @xmath47 and @xmath48 , in terms of the six amplitudes @xmath87 , and obtain six linear equations whose coefficients also contain @xmath88 .",
    "having solved these equations , one finally finds that the dependence of the total transmission amplitude @xmath47 on the ab phase @xmath11 has the general form @xmath89 where the complex functions @xmath90 and @xmath91 all depend on the other parameters of the qd ( including @xmath4 ) , the interferometer and the electron wave vector @xmath43 .",
    "it is easy to convince oneself@xcite that , apart from an overall multiplicative factor , the numerator represents the two - slit situation of one crossing through each branch of the ring , while the @xmath92 term in the denominator comes from a sum over an infinite geometrical series of additional motions around the ring : clock- and counterclockwise contributions contain factors of @xmath82 and @xmath93 , multiplying the same complex coefficient . except for the detailed dependence of the coefficients on @xmath4 ,",
    "these facts are model independent .",
    "in fact , the form ( [ tt ] ) appeared in many earlier model calculations ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , eq . ( [ tt ] ) implies that the exact form for @xmath13 is @xmath94 a fit to this equation , instead of the fourier expansion ( [ fit ] ) , would be much more accurate ( with only five parameters ) , and would enable an easier comparison of the data with theoretical calculations of @xmath90 and @xmath91 .    using exact integration on @xmath13 , the @xmath4-dependence of the coefficients in the expansion ( [ fit ] ) are presented for the closed interferometer in fig .",

    "[ alpha ] .",
    "( the figure was produced with @xmath95 , but the results for the closed case do not depend on these numbers ) .",
    "for the closed interferometer , time reversal symmetry implies that the ratio @xmath96 in eq .",
    "( [ tt ] ) must be real , and thus @xmath10 depends only on @xmath97 , in agreement with onsager s relations .",
    "this yields the same jumps of @xmath1 between zero and @xmath2 as in yacoby _",
    "s experiments@xcite , coincident with peaks and zeroes of @xmath27 .",
    "pursuing one possible scenario @xcite , we model the  leaking \" from each of the three segments on the ring ( imitating @xmath30 and @xmath31 in the experiment , fig .",
    "[ ab](b ) ) by connecting each site on the three ring segments to a 1d lead , which allows only an outgoing current to an absorbing reservoir ( fig .",
    "[ ab](c ) ) .",
    "each such segment is thus replaced by a  comb \" of absorbing  teeth \" .",
    "we start by investigating the properties of a single  comb \" . the  base \" of the  comb \" is described by a chain of @xmath98 tight - binding sites , with @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",

    "assuming only outgoing waves on the teeth , with wave functions @xmath105 and energy @xmath106 , one can eliminate the  teeth \" from the equations .",
    "the wave functions on the  base \" of the comb are then given by @xmath107 , where @xmath108 is a solution of the ( complex energy ) equation @xmath109 .",
    "when this  comb \" is treated as our basic scatterer , i.e. connected via @xmath110 and @xmath111 to our  standard \" two leads , then the transmission and reflection amplitudes via the  comb \" are given ( up to unimportant phases ) by @xmath112 and @xmath113 , and one ends up with two linear equations for @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "the results for @xmath116 and @xmath117 are shown , for three values of @xmath98 , in fig .",

    "it is rewarding to observe that both @xmath10 and @xmath58 are almost independent of the electron energy @xmath70 over a broad range near the band center .",
    "it is also interesting to note that for these parameters , @xmath10 decreases with @xmath35 , but @xmath58 increases with @xmath35 . for fixed @xmath35 , @xmath10 and @xmath58 exhibit some even - odd oscillations with @xmath98 , but basically @xmath10 decreases with @xmath98 while @xmath58 increases towards an almost constant value for @xmath121 .",
    "this is understandable : a strong coupling to the  teeth \" causes a strong decay of the wave function along the  comb \" .",
    "thus , for each value of @xmath98 one can find an intermediate optimal region in which both @xmath10 and @xmath58 are small .",
    "this region broadens , and has smaller @xmath10 and @xmath58 , for larger @xmath98 .",
    "we next place three such  combs \" on the ab interferometer , as in fig .",
    "[ ab](c ) , and study the ab transmission @xmath10 as function of the various parameters . for simplicity",

    "the main difference in the results is that now @xmath108 is complex , yielding a decay of the wave function through each comb .",
    "this also turns the ratio @xmath96 in eq .",
    "( [ tt ] ) complex , yielding non - trivial values for @xmath1 . to demonstrate qualitative results , we choose @xmath95 , use @xmath124 and keep @xmath63 and the qd parameters @xmath125 .",

    "other choices give similar qualitative results .",
    "[ ziur ] shows results for @xmath28 and @xmath1 as function of @xmath4 , for several values of @xmath35 .",
    "clearly , @xmath127 gives a phase @xmath1 which is intermediate between the onsager jumps of the upper left fig .",
    "[ ziur ] and the exact intrinsic @xmath0 of fig .",
    "[ alpha ] . increasing @xmath35 yields a saturation of @xmath1 onto @xmath0 , which persists for a broad range between @xmath128 and @xmath129 .",
    "however , larger values of @xmath35 , e.g. @xmath130 , cause a deviation of @xmath1 from @xmath0 , due to the increase of the reflection from each  comb \" .",
    "interestingly , this deviation is * in the same direction * as for small @xmath35 !",
    "the reason for this is clear : as the reflection of each comb increases , the electron  rattles \" in and out of the qd .",
    "this localizes it on the qd , and reduces the width of the qd resonances . for these large values of @xmath35",
    ", one has @xmath131 in eq .",
    "( [ tt ] ) .",
    "thus , the two - slit conditions hold , and one has @xmath132 and @xmath133 . we have solved the equations for the transmission through the upper branch only ( disconnecting the lower branch altogether ) , and found that indeed , the coefficient @xmath134 in @xmath135 is a constant as long as the reflection of the combs is small . however , as @xmath35 increases above about @xmath136 , @xmath134 is no longer a constant .",
    "the narrower resonances shown in fig .",
    "[ ziur ] ( lower right ) fully agree with this modified upper branch transmission . in any case ,  optimal combs \" , with small @xmath10 _ and _ @xmath58 , do yield @xmath24 .    so far , we assumed _ no _ direct losses from the qd itself .",
    "it is easy to add such losses , by connecting a  lossy \" channel to each resonant state @xmath137 @xcite , similar to the  teeth \" of our  combs \" , with a tunneling amplitude @xmath138 .",
    "as before , this introduces a complex addition @xmath139 to @xmath140 . fig . [ loss ]",
    "shows the results for the same parameters as above , but with @xmath141 .",
    "clearly , the new imaginary parts eliminate the fano - like zero in @xmath27 , and yield a smooth variation of @xmath1 near the  intrinsic phase lapses \" .",
    "although similar to the behavior arising in the bw approximation , the present effects are _ real _ , due to physical breaking of the unitarity on the qd .",
    "it is interesting to note that the data of ref .",
    "@xcite show similar ( and otherwise unexplained ) smooth features .",
    "it is however possible that the latter come from finite temperature averaging@xcite .",
    "in conclusion , we find that the ab interferometer yields quantitative information on the qd resonances only if the electron crosses each segment on the ring , as well as the qd itself , only once .",
    "as stated , this can be rephrased by two criteria : having the two - slit condition ",
    "i.e. effectively no reflections back from the  forks \" into the ring s branches , and having no  rattling \" around the qd  i.e. having little reflection from the  lossy \" terminals .",
    "a third criterion requires no direct losses from the qd itself .",
    "the two - slit conditions are easy to examine : a small @xmath142 in eq .",
    "( [ tt ] ) implies small amplitudes for all except the first harmonic in eq .",
    "( [ fit ] ) , as indeed seen by the decreasing relative values of @xmath143 for increasing @xmath35 in fig .",
    "this is also easily checked in the analysis of the experimental data@xcite .",
    "it might be interesting to fit intermediate range data to the exact eq .",
    "( [ tt ] ) , instead of using a truncated fourier series as in eq .",
    "( [ fit ] ) .",
    "the second condition , which has not been emphasized in the literature before , is somewhat harder to confirm .",
    "one way to check this is to vary @xmath35 experimentally , and look for the value which gives the _ largest _ width of the resonances .",
    "other ways require disconnecting the lower branch , and studying the conductance through the  lossy \" path including the qd and the two  combs \" .",
    "the  combs \" are acceptable for our purposes only below a threshold @xmath35 , as long as the conductance peaks remain independent of @xmath35 .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that the experimental data ( as reflected in fig .",
    "[ ziur ] ) actually contain more than the ab phase shift @xmath1 . as stated after eq .",
    "( [ 2slit ] ) , the two - slit condition implies that @xmath144 .",
    "since @xmath145 is independent of @xmath4 , this gives @xmath132 .",
    "assuming also that the  combs \" on the upper branch do not modify the @xmath4 dependence ( i.e. that @xmath134 is @xmath4-independent ) , we conclude that @xmath146 , where @xmath147 is the maximum of @xmath148 .",
    "indeed , we confirmed that our  data \" in fig .",
    "[ ziur ] obey this relation in the optimal range of @xmath35 .",
    "moving away from these optimal conditions causes a steeper increase in @xmath1 , and a related narrower peak in @xmath27 . both of these widths should be largest for the optimal conditions .",
    "in fact , a third way to ensure a correct measurement of @xmath0 would be to measure @xmath6 directly , from the conductance of the _ isolated _ qd , and compare it with the normalized @xmath149 in the interferometer measurement .",
    "obviously , all of the latter experiments require modifications of the mesoscopic circuitry , and may thus not be straightforward to follow .",
    "although we presented results for only one set of parameters , we emphasize that similar results can be obtained for many other sets .",
    "in particular , the results for @xmath1 and for @xmath150 do not depend on the parameters of the lower branch . varying these parameters only adds @xmath4-independent factors , and changes the @xmath4-dependence of @xmath126 ( which is dominated by the ratio @xmath151 ) .",
    "the results are also not sensitive to the sizes @xmath78 of the  combs \" .",
    "however , too broad combs imply too small values of the total transmission through the interferometer ( at optimum ) , giving very small outgoing currents which may be difficult to measure .",
    "thus , although weidenmller@xcite is right in wishing many terminals , this is not enough .",
    "one could also vary other parameters , like @xmath152 , but this might introduce additional resonances , due to the  combs \" and not to the qd .",
    "similar undesired comb - related resonances also arise when @xmath153 is close to the band edge , but will not arise when one abandons the special 1d treatment of the leads and branches , a situation which is better modeled near the center of the band .",
    "our analysis also shows that even away from optimum , the _ locations _ of both the resonances and the fano - like zeroes ( or  phase lapses \" ) are reproduced correctly , independently of the coupling strength @xmath35 .",
    "the main purpose of optimizing the interferometer is thus to obtain accurate values of the intrinsic resonance _",
    "widths _ , which should agree with those found from the direct measurements of the peaks in the isolated qd conductance .",
