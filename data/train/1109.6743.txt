    "vertical lines show the increase of intensity due to fluorescence excitation ( colour on line).,title=\"fig:\",width=249 ]        @xcite demonstrated that is it possible to construct consistent models of the central star atmosphere and the nebula to predict accurately the intensities of uv , optical and ir nebular and stellar emission lines in ic  418 .",
    "we used similar models and included excitation of dipole  allowed transitions by fluorescence besides recombination to predict the intensities of 189 emission lines of c  ii , n  i , n  ii , o  i , and o  ii observed by @xcite .    the high  resolution synthetic spectrum produced by the cmfgen code ( @xcite ) gives the opportunity to notice variations in the predicted intensities of some emission lines due to the expansion of the nebular gas .",
    "we used the cloudy nebular code ( @xcite ) to model the nearly spherical nebula with a density profile similar to the one used by @xcite .",
    "fluorescence is important in the population of s , p , and some d states while recombination populates f and g states .",
    "the most important effect of fluorescence is in the n  ii lines from the decay of s , p and most d states .",
    "intense lines in planetary nebulae like @xmath0@xmath1 and @xmath2@xmath3 have fluorescence contributions of 78% and 73% respectively .",
    "c  ii lines from most p and d states have between 20% and 69% contribution by fluorescence . o  ii lines are mostly excited by recombination , but fluorescence can contribute up to 50% of the excitation of @xmath4 states ( figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] and  [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "we can also predict some of the intensities of the n  i and o  i in a neutral shell around the ionized region .",
    "most permitted o  i lines are produced by recombination , while n  i permitted and optical forbidden lines are excited by fluorescence ( fig .  [ fig2 ] ) ."
