    "to control the transportation of micro- and nanoparticles artificially , it is very important to understand the diffusion properties under the confining walls .",
    "these phenomena are encountered in biological cells @xcite and zeolite @xcite , and in catalytic reactions in porous media @xcite . for this purpose ,",
    "the diffusion properties in confined geometries are discussed by several authors .",
    "the diffusion in a membrane with a certain thickness is discussed by gov @xcite , gambin et al .",
    "@xcite , and ogawa @xcite .",
    "the diffusion in general curved manifold is discussed by castro - villarreal @xcite .",
    "the diffusion in a tube with a varying cross section along the axis ( channel model ) is discussed by jacobs @xcite , yanagida @xcite , zwanzig @xcite , reguera and rubi @xcite , and kalinary and percus @xcite , and as a review , see burada et al .",
    "surprisingly , this channel model is related to the reaction rate theory due to the smoluchowski equation @xcite , @xcite .    in this paper ,",
    "we discuss the case in which a tube has a fixed cross section but is winding with geometrical properties , namely , curvature and torsion .",
    "then , we show that the diffusion in such a tube with a neumann boundary condition can be expressed by a quasi - one - dimensional diffusion equation with an effective diffusion coefficient that depends on curvature .",
    "this is carried out by integrating a three - dimensional diffusion equation in the cross section of the tube .",
    "the coefficient depends on the curvature of the central line of the tube .",
    "the physical interpretation of its curvature dependence is given by analogy to ohm s law .    by using the obtained equation",
    ", we show the mean square displacement ( msd ) of torus and helix tubes where the curvature is constant .",
    "when the curvature depends on position , we show the short time expansion for msd .    in section 2 ,",
    "we introduce the curvilinear coordinates and related metrics in a winding tube .",
    "this is carried out by using frenet - seret ( fs ) equations explained in appendix 1 . in section 3 , we define the quasi - one - dimensional diffusion field . in section 4 , the diffusion equation is obtained by using a local equilibrium condition .",
    "this condition is an assumption that the diffusion in the same cross section is completed in a short time , which is much smaller than our observed time scale ; thus , we may assume that the density is flat on the same cross section . in section 5 , we discuss the diffusion equation beyond the local equilibrium condition . in section 6 ,",
    "we calculate msd from the quasi - one - dimensional diffusion equation and show first two terms in the short time expansion by using curvature and its derivatives . in section 7 , the conclusion is given .",
    "in tube.,width=151 ]",
    "we consider the quasi - one - dimensional diffusion equation as the limitation process from a three - dimensional usual diffusion equation in a thin tube with a circular cross section .",
    "we set the curved tube with the radius @xmath0 in the three - dimensional euclidean space @xmath1 .",
    "the curvilinear coordinates that specify the points in the tube and their bases we use hereafter are as follows ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "@xmath2 is the cartesian coordinate in @xmath1 .",
    "@xmath3 is the length parameter along the center line of the tube and @xmath4 is its tangential vector .",
    "@xmath5 is the cartesian coordinate that specifies the points on the center line .",
    "@xmath6 is the coordinate in the transversal direction @xmath7 , the small latin indices @xmath8 run from 2 to 3 and the greek indices @xmath9 run from 1 to 3 .",
    "we sometimes use the notations @xmath10 and @xmath11 to obtain simpler expressions , and we define the area element of the cross section @xmath12 . @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the unit basis vectors introduced by the frenet - seret equations @xcite , @xcite explained in appendix 1 .",
    "then , we identify any points in the tube using    @xmath15    where @xmath16 with @xmath17 .    from this relation ,",
    "we obtain the curvilinear coordinate system in the tube ( @xmath18 ) using the coordinate @xmath19 and metric @xmath20 .",
    "@xmath21    @xmath20 is calculated by using the frenet - seret equations ( appendix 1 ) .",
    "@xmath22 where @xmath23 is the curvature and @xmath24 is the torsion defined in appendix 1 .",
    "we have nonzero off - diagonal elements due to the existence of torsion .",
    "the determinant of the metric tensor does not depend on torsion .",
    "the inverse metric is given as @xmath26",
    "let us define a three- dimensional diffusion field by @xmath27 and a three- dimensional laplace - beltrami operator with metric tensor ( [ eq : metric ] ) by @xmath28 .",
    "then , we obtain the diffusion equation with a normalization condition : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the diffusion constant , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 is the number of particles .",
    "our aim is to construct the effective one - dimensional diffusion equation from the 3d equation above in a small radius limit .    @xmath33    where @xmath34 is the one - dimensional diffusion field and @xmath35 is the unknown effective 1d diffusion operator that might not be equal to the simple 1d laplace - beltrami operator @xmath36 .    from two normalization conditions ,",
    "namely , ( [ eq : norm1 ] ) and ( [ eq : norm2 ] ) , we obtain @xmath37 ~ ds , \\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\int \\phi^{(1)}(s ) ~ ds.\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the particle number between @xmath38 and @xmath39 should be equal in the two fields .",
    "thus , we obtain @xmath40    we multiply @xmath41 by equation ( [ eq : diff ] ) and integrate it by @xmath42 and @xmath43 to obtain @xmath44    from the form of the laplace - beltrami operator @xmath45    our diffusion equation has the form    @xmath46    where the neumann boundary condition is used at the second equality .",
    "the torsion appears only when the axial symmetry of @xmath27 is broken as is expected from the definition .",
    "now , we suppose the `` local equilibrium condition '' as    @xmath47    in the directions @xmath48 and @xmath14 , the local equilibrium holds for a short time @xmath49 . when our observation is given in the time scale @xmath50 satisfying @xmath51 , we can assume local equilibrium condition ( [ eq : lec ] ) .",
    "note that this condition includes the neumann condition at the boundary of the tube .    from equations ( [ eq : relation ] ) and",
    "( [ eq : lec ] ) , we also obtain @xmath52    note that @xmath53 also satisfies condition ( [ eq : relation ] ) ; however , this relation does not satisfy the neumann condition at the boundary of the tube .",
    "then , we obtain    @xmath54    where    @xmath55    the static solution has the form    @xmath56    note that equation ( [ eq : result ] ) is consistent with normalization condition ( [ eq : norm2 ] ) .",
    "we also obtain the relation @xmath57 where @xmath58    then , we find a simple interpretation of this relation .",
    "let us consider the point p on the tube where the curvature is @xmath23 .",
    "we choose two sections near p and discuss the length connecting these two sections ( see figure 2 ) . at the coordinate @xmath42 , the length between the two sections is given by @xmath38 , which is different from the length of the center line , @xmath59 , with the ratio @xmath60    next , we should note that the relation between diffusion flow and density difference is similar to ohm s law . @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the flow density , @xmath63 is the cross section , @xmath30 is the diffusion constant , @xmath38 is the distance , and @xmath64 is the density difference . in the comparison with ohm s law ,",
    "electric current corresponds to @xmath65 , voltage corresponds to @xmath64 , and electric conductivity @xmath66 corresponds to @xmath67 . by using the above correspondence",
    ", we consider our tube as a bundle of thin tubes ( see figure 3 ) .",
    "thus , it can be seen as a parallel connection of many resistances .",
    "the total conductivity is calculated as     of tube : @xmath42 shows distance to the direction of center of curvature .",
    "the center line has the curvature radius @xmath68 and the line with @xmath69 has the curvature radius @xmath70.,width=151 ]    @xmath71    where @xmath72 . the last equality shows the definition of the effective diffusion coefficient .",
    "thus , we obtain @xmath73 where ( [ eq : ratio ] ) is utilized at the second equality .",
    "and cross - sectional area @xmath74.,width=226 ]    when the cross section is not circular but quadrangular as seen in figure 4 , we obtain @xmath75    note that @xmath76 is an even function of @xmath23 .",
    "this result is consistent with the surface diffusion with the thickness @xmath0 , where one tangential direction is flat and the other has the curvature @xmath23 , similarly to the case of a surface on an elliptic cylinder , which is shown in @xcite .        the physical reason why the diffusion coefficient increases at the curved point is similar to the discussion of total resistance for the following electric circuit .",
    "let us consider the parallel connection of three electric resistances .",
    "when the resistances have the same @xmath77 value , the total resistance is @xmath78 .",
    "however , when the resistances have a dispersion @xmath79 with a mean @xmath77 value ( @xmath80 ) , such as @xmath81 and @xmath82 , the total resistance takes the value @xmath83 the dispersion reduces the total resistance , i.e. , increases the diffusion coefficient , as is shown in ( [ eq : eff_diff ] ) .",
    "starting from the local equilibrium distribution , we discuss the perturbation theory .",
    "the fluctuation field @xmath84 is introduced as    @xmath85    the normalization condition is @xmath86    let us introduce the differential equation for the @xmath87 field . from ( [ eq : diff ] ) , ( [ eq : new ] ) , and ( [ eq : fluctuation ] ) , we obtain    @xmath88    by multiplying equation ( [ eq : n_eq ] ) by @xmath41 and integrating it by @xmath89 , we obtain @xmath90    thus , for consistency , condition ( [ eq : n_condition ] ) holds anytime when it is satisfied at the initial time .",
    "we solve equation ( [ eq : n_eq ] ) by following the method discussed by zwanzig @xcite .",
    "the formal solution of ( [ eq : n_eq ] ) is given as    @xmath91 dt',\\label{eq : n_solution}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath92    hereafter , we utilize the initial condition @xmath93 , which satisfies ( [ eq : n_condition ] ) .",
    "we solve equation ( [ eq : n_solution ] ) by the iterative method .",
    "@xmath94    the 0th order of the iterative solution is    @xmath95    where @xmath96 \\sim \\exp [ t/(\\epsilon^2/d)]$ ] changes rapidly in a short time scale @xmath97 , while @xmath98 changes slowly . to achieve our calculation",
    ", we utilize the markov approximation . for the fast changing variable @xmath99 and slowly changing variable @xmath100 , we have for a large @xmath50 , @xmath101 then , we obtain    @xmath102    the explicit form of @xmath103 is shown in appendix 2 ; however , we consider here more solutions .",
    "the first iterative solution @xmath104 is given by    @xmath105    where @xmath106 is any function that satisfies the laplace equation .",
    "@xmath107    this follows the relation @xmath108    in the same manner , we obtain @xmath109 where @xmath110 satisfies the same equation as @xmath106 .",
    "we should note that this fact comes from the markov approximation . in this manner",
    ", we obtain a solution for @xmath87 .",
    "@xmath111    from equation ( [ eq : n(1 ) ] ) , the general solution of @xmath103 contains the laplace field that satisfies the same equation as @xmath112 .",
    "therefore , the sum of @xmath112 is included in @xmath103 .",
    "thus , @xmath103 is the exact solution for @xmath87 .",
    "@xmath113    furthermore , from equations ( [ eq : new ] ) and ( [ eq : fluctuation ] ) , we have    @xmath114    on the other hand , ( [ eq : n(1 ) ] ) and ( [ eq:0 ] ) give    @xmath115    thus , we observe no effect from fluctuation @xmath87 even though @xmath116 ( see appendix 2 ) .",
    "although the particles diffuse in the transverse direction , the total flow along the centerline is not affected .",
    "this shows that the effective equation ( [ eq : result ] ) holds even in the case of a nonlocal equilibrium state under the markov approximation , where we utilize the condition : @xmath97 is small time scale compared to our time scale @xmath50 .",
    "our quasi - one - dimensional diffusion equation ( [ eq : result ] ) determines the time development of msd as follows .    from the definition of the expectational value ,",
    "we have    @xmath117    then , we obtain    @xmath118    where @xmath119 .",
    "+ we also obtain    @xmath120    when the tube forms a constant curvature configuration , such as a torus or a helix , we obtain    @xmath121    where @xmath122 for a torus with a ring radius @xmath77 and    @xmath123    for a helix defined by    @xmath124    here , @xmath125 is the length parameter    @xmath126    on the other hand , if the curvature @xmath23 exhibits a position dependence , we can show the short time expansion for msd .",
    "let us choose the initial condition    @xmath127    then , we calculate msd by short time expansion near @xmath128 .    @xmath129    where    @xmath130    in the same manner , we obtain    @xmath131    here , we utilize    @xmath132    note that these short time expansion coefficients are given by the curvature and its space derivatives .",
    "this procedure is similar to that given in a theory of diffusion in higher dimensional riemannian manifold @xcite , although the coefficients are determined by the riemannian curvature that vanishes in our case . in this manner",
    ", we obtain the curvature - dependent msd for the quasi - one - dimensional curved system .",
    "we have discussed the effective diffusion equation in a curved thin tube with local and nonlocal equilibrium conditions .",
    "we obtained the curvature - dependent diffusion coefficient in the case of the local equilibrium condition .",
    "the physical interpretation of curvature dependence is given by analogy to ohm s law .",
    "next , we studied the case in which the local equilibrium is broken by perturbation , and we showed that the effective diffusion equation does not change under the fluctuation of diffusion in the transversal direction when we work with the markov approximation .",
    "we calculated the mean square displacement ( msd ) by using the effective diffusion coefficient that depends on the local curvature . in the case of thin torus and helix",
    ", we obtain a constant curvature and a simple solution ( [ eq : msd ] ) for msd . in general cases , curvature depends on position and then we can not show the explicit form of msd ; however , we can calculate the short time expansion of msd in the form ( [ msd2 ] ) .",
    "the coefficients are calculated using the local curvature and its derivatives .",
    "thus , we have shown the geometrical aspect of the diffusion in the quasi - one - dimensional system .",

    "the reason for this is as follows .    at point @xmath5",
    ", we draw a circle that tangents this curved line . from figure 5(a ) , we easily obtain two relations : @xmath136 where @xmath77 is the radius of this circle . then , we obtain equation ( [ eq : kappa ] ) by identifying @xmath137 .    .",
    "( b ) torsion is defined by the rotation of @xmath48 around @xmath4 .",

    "however , @xmath140 can be calculated as    @xmath141    thus , we replace ( [ eq : torsion ] ) with @xmath142 the function @xmath24 is called torsion , which has a simple geometrical meaning .    from the equation    @xmath143",
    "we observe that @xmath24 indicates the rotation of the unit vector @xmath48 around the tangential direction of the line , as shown in figure 5(b ) .",
    "we further consider a derivative of @xmath14 ,    @xmath144    with the unknown functions @xmath145 and @xmath146 .",
