    "recently it was shown that artificially structuring superconducting rings on the subwavelength scale can produce nonlinear and switchable metamaterials @xcite .",
    "arrays of rings of josephson junctions or systems of superconducting islands on normal metal films can be excited by electromagnetic radiation @xcite and support the propagation of electromagnetic waves @xcite , thus significantly modifying vacuum permeability .",
    "even the sign of the permeability can be changed in such a system .",
    "each superconducting ring is a `` meta - atom '' or `` molecule '' and the arrays of rings make up the `` metamaterial '' .",
    "these rings can have currents induced into them by the application of electromagnetic fields .",
    "however , special rings containing two superconducting islands that are separated from one another by a weak link ( a josephson junction ) , generate their own spontaneous current when the difference in the phases of their quantum mechanical wave functions in the ground state energy is @xmath0 .",
    "these special junctions are known as @xmath0-junctions and rings containing odd numbers of them are @xmath0-rings @xcite .",
    "the spontaneous currents that circulate in these rings occur when no external current or magnetic field is applied and they are randomly orientated , i.e. clockwise or counter - clockwise .",
    "metamaterials composed of these rings exploit the energy competition resulting from the spontaneous currents and magnetic flux quantization , thus creating a complicated switching distribution .",
    "superconducting metamaterials are highly desirable due to their low ohmic losses , controllability by electromagnetic fields , sensitivity to temperature , and their potential for use in plasmonics .",
    "the harnessing of light by metamaterials is limited by dissipative losses .",
    "superconducting metamaterials offer a solution by being inherently low loss devices with negative effective permeability @xcite .",
    "spontaneous magnetization is a particularly intriguing attribute for a metamaterial as it reduces the need for a lot of extraneous circuitry .",
    "it also means that the metamaterial structure is already in a magnetic state and that small localized perturbations can be used at one part of the metamaterial to affect the whole structure , much like in spin - ice systems @xcite .",
    "-ring with four josephson junctions is shown ( three ordinary junctions and one @xmath0-junction ) .",
    "the energy of the ring is normalized by the josephson energy and is a function of the magnetic flux , @xmath1 , in units of the elementary flux quantum @xmath2 .",

    "these structures have become easier to make due to developments in fabrication technologies for molecular beam epitaxy , laser ablation and electron lithography techniques .",
    "these advancements in fabrication technologies allow one to design and to develop novel quantum devices with different structures built up of josephson junctions and even nanopatterned superconducting structures @xcite .",
    "the penetration of the magnetic field into a single ring with josephson junctions , the simplest structure of which is known as a superconducting quantum interferometer device ( squid ) , is characterized by the absorption of the magnetic flux quanta due to a flux quantization as it follows from gauge invariance .",
    "this flux quantization forms a firm basis for a highly sensitive measurement of magnetic fields . here ,",
    "in the present paper , we propose a series of new devices which are a generalization of a single squid to their arrays .",
    "such an array allows one to make measurements not only of the dc magnetic field but also ac or microwave electromagnetic fields with a high precision . in an array there",
    "emerges an interaction between single josephson vortices which are trapped with the magnetic field by the elementary rings or squids of the josephson network structure .",
    "the way these vortices penetrate into it depends upon the shape of the structure and whether it has a plane or space geometry .",
    "+ in the present work we consider simple networks of two - dimensional arrays of josephson rings and calculate their basic vortex configurations .",
    "particular attention is given to arrays consisting of josephson rings with a single @xmath0-junction included ( @xmath0-rings ) .",
    "the simplest josephson structures of @xmath0-rings are shown in the fig.[fig2 ] as linear arrays . in our method",
    ", we consider several examples of josephson networks where the flux patterns may have some applications .",
    "the work focuses upon chains of rings with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "+ different two - dimensional josephson arrays have already been investigated experimentally , in detail , by the means of the mutual inductance methods in @xcite .",
    "the josephson arrays containing a few cells have been studied in the framework of the resistivity - shunted - junction model @xcite in order to understand how big the real disorder and frustrations of the lattice are .",
    "there are numerous experimental investigations in this field that were carried out in the past [ e.g. , @xcite ] . in the present work",
    ", considering arrays of josephson rings with @xmath0-junctions , we found the distribution of the vortices for the given values of magnetic field for both the ground and the excited states .",
    "the incorporation of an odd number of @xmath0-junctions into the rings creates a set of highly degenerate energy states that otherwise would only be possible with the application of a magnetic flux equal to half an elementary flux quantum .",
    "the @xmath0 phase shift induces a spontaneous current that can flow clockwise or counter - clockwise around the ring @xcite . in",
    "both isolated and coupled groups of @xmath0-rings the magnetic fluxes tend towards one - half an elementary flux quantum as the large inductance limit is approached @xcite .",
    "the interaction of an assembly of closely spaced , electronically isolated @xmath0-rings leads to a rich and complicated energy balance .",
    "fabrication techniques are sufficiently advanced for it to be legitimate to assume that all the junctions on the ring have the same coupling energy , @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the temperature dependant junction critical current . because of the flux quantization or the aharonov - bohm effect , the value of the flux is limited to @xmath8 , i.e. the phase change over the junction is limited to the values @xmath9 .",
    "this indicates that if the ring has many junctions , @xmath10 , that the change of the phases @xmath11 on a single junction @xmath12 of the ring may be chosen by an appropriate gauge transformation so that it does not vary very much .",
    "if there is a single @xmath0-junction in the ring then there is a current in the ground state @xcite .",
    "this supercurrent , @xmath13 , is associated with the phase differences @xmath11 , which occur due to magnetic flux and the @xmath0-shift in the summed phase difference .",
    "therefore , for each @xmath0-ring an orbital moment arises .",
    "so then the arrays of the @xmath0-junction rings can be considered as an array of orbital moments .",
    "that is , if we consider the case of a complicated multi - connected network of the interacting @xmath0-rings , the gauge symmetry dictates that the total magnetic flux through each ring in this network must be quantized . with a single @xmath0-junction",
    "the expression for the total energy of the ring has the form @xcite : e(x)=e_j(1-cos(--))[eq1 ] .",
    "this is the ground state energy for a single ring consisting of @xmath14 ordinary junctions , including the magnetic energy of the ring , the josephson coupling energy , and with one @xmath0-junction , @xmath15 , i.e. @xmath16 . the last term in the cosine function , @xmath17 , stands for the existence of a single @xmath0-junction in the ring . in a ring",
    "there can be the presence of a vortex state @xmath18 .",
    "the resulting energy potential can be seen in fig.[fig1 ] , where one can see that the cuspoidal shape accurately describes the low energy term for @xmath19 , e_(x)=(-|x|)^2[eq2 ] .",
    "the zero flux cusp in the energy flux dependence corresponds to the instability leading to the formation of the spontaneous current and the orbital moment of the @xmath0-ring .",
    "hence , we obtain a model of the orbital moment formation using a very simple harmonic approximation @xcite . here",
    "we assume that @xmath20 .",
    "then the ring has trapped a unit flux and a harmonic approximation can also be carried out around the new minima associated with the single trapped vortex in the ring . without a trapped vortex , the energy minimum corresponds to the flux @xmath21 . to describe the interaction of the @xmath0-rings , = ^n_r_i=1 ( -|x_i|)^2 + x_i^2+x_ix_i+1 , [ eq3 ] where , @xmath22 is the number of @xmath0-rings and @xmath23 is the spontaneous flux in units of the elementary flux quantum @xmath24 .",
    "the self and mutual - inductances , @xmath25 and @xmath26 respectively , are taken to be of constant value for each ring and ring - ring interaction in an array .",
    "the rings are coupled through mutual inductance .",

    "the self - inductance of each of the rings is @xmath29 , where @xmath13 is the current circulating around each ring and @xmath30 .",
    "note that for an @xmath31 junction ring , @xmath32 , is similar to the well - known parameter , @xmath33 , that is used to define the inductance limit for the onset of spontaneous flux that is close to half a flux quantum @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that this parameter is sensitive to temperature fluctuations and applied magnetic fields .",
    "for example , random temperature fluctuations or the application of an electromagnetic field can change the system character and thus the effective dielectric constant of an array of @xmath0-rings , which may be a useful fact when designing metamaterials .    in this model the limits are as follows . when @xmath34 , the minima of the energy correspond to the zero flux state where @xmath35 ( see fig.[fig3 ] ( a ) to see this situation in the flux contour plots , with @xmath36 ) .     and",

    "such a competition may lead to multi - stability and the formation of a fractal .",
    "the fractal emerges as @xmath48 , but in order to map its origin we see in fig.[fig3 ] @xmath43 , where there are two coupled rings , that @xmath49 ( i.e. @xmath50 ) . in the limit @xmath51 ,",

    "the coupling parameter @xmath47 is restricted to be less than two ( i.e. @xmath63 ) .",
    "as @xmath47 increases , with @xmath32 remaining constant , the absolute value of the spontaneous flux for a @xmath41 state decreases , whilst the energy level becomes higher .",

    "of course , the degree of separation between the oppositely polarized rings spawns a set of degenerate energy levels too .",

    "we introduce @xmath108 as our dimensionless externally applied flux , @xmath109 with the magnetic flux penetrating the rings @xmath110 .",

    "magnetism has even been previously found to coexist with superconductivity in the absence of the meissner effect @xcite .",
    "thus , the @xmath0-ring array can have an amazing diversity of phase transitions and magnetic hysteresis pathways @xcite which we have found to lead to the possibility of a fractal structure in the magnetic flux . in the current work , the addition of a small magnetic field has been shown to produce remarkably complex changes between conditions for observing positive or negative permeabilities .",
    "the situations found in small magnetic fields experimentally in @xcite were also strongly influenced by temperature and this will be an area of future work for the fractal metamaterials discussed here . in this work",
    "a simplified model has been developed that has allowed us to characterize the spontaneous fluxes that develop in an array of @xmath0-rings .",
    "it is interesting to note that in the work of geim and co - workers @xcite on the experimental verification of the paramagnetic meissner effect for small superconductors , that changes in the radius and thickness of their superconducting disks altered the sign of the meissner effect .",
    "a thinner disk resulted in a smaller field requirement for the paramagnetic meissner state to become larger . in the fractal metamaterial",
    ", ring geometry also plays an important role , with the radius and nano - thickness dictating the size of the permeability and also the value of @xmath47 in a small external field .",
    "recent advances in josephson junction coupling have enabled the massive increase in the inductances of the circuitry through the addition of kinetic inductance to produce superinductors @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0-ring arrays could be connected to one another through thin superconducting lines so that the total inductance becomes a sum of both the geometrical and kinetic inductances . in this way inductance",
    "can become three orders of magnitude higher @xcite .",
    "thus , ring geometries can also be created that have tunable inductances .",
    "we described the properties of a new fractal metamaterial that is consisting of interacting superconducting rings containing @xmath0-junctions .",
    "however , quantum confinement effects are associated with generic metamaterial systems and lead to novel properties amongst the `` meta - atoms '' .",
    "the fractal metamaterial can also be found for structures such as those composed of nano - magnets ( such as those in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . indeed ,",
    "small linear chains described in terms of the ginzburg - landau model are well suited to finding novel spectroscopic signatures in the guise of fractals @xcite .",
    "these kinds of systems can be described in a similar fashion to the @xmath0-rings and other metamaterials .",
    "for example , for two - dimensional arrays of conically shaped nano - pillars , like those fabricated on the nanoscale by grigorenko and co - workers @xcite , there can be the existence of a fractal spectrum .",
    "small diameter cylinders or cones behave as if they have a single magnetic domain",
    ". the total distribution of magnetic moments in the molecular ring of `` artificial atoms '' is determined by dipole - dipole or exchange interactions .",
    "a chain of cylinders or cones with induced magnetism may be described by , f =- j_i , j**m**_i**m**_j+_i(*m*_i^2+*m*_i^4+*hm*_i .",
    "[ eq8 ] ) equation ( [ eq8 ] ) assumes a dipole - dipole coupling constant @xmath150 that describes the interaction of the meta - atoms .",
    "the external magnetic field is * h * and @xmath151 and @xmath152 are phemonological constants .",
    "the magnetization is described by @xmath153 , which for cones or cylinders can be taken in the reduced form to be @xmath154 . following @xcite and",
    "substituting for * m * , eq.([eq8 ] ) becomes , f=(m_s^2-jm_s^2)_iz_i^2+m_s^4_iz_i^4++[eq9 ] , where , = _ i , j(z_i - z_j)^2,and = -hm_s_iz_i.we now introduce some alternative notation in order to make the dimensionless form of the free energy : @xmath155 ; @xmath156 and @xmath157 . in this way",
    "we now obtain a generic form for metamaterials that are composed of elements that have have an elongated magnetic structure .",
    "* f*(x_1, ... ,x_k)=^k_i=1(x_i - x_i-1)^2+(x_i^2 - 1)^2-hx_i .",
    "[ eq12 ] in the above @xmath23 defines the orientation of the magnetization in the i - th meta - atom and @xmath158 is an effective saturation magnetization .",
    "the energy @xmath41 has been scaled by @xmath159 .",
    "this form of equation is similar to those employed for analyzing the coupled @xmath0-rings and will in fact also lead to fractal formation . for an in depth discussion of its use for a system of ellipsoidal nanomagnets",
    "see ref.@xcite .",
    "the point is that the fractal structures should be obtainable for a number of different kinds of magnetic structures , with complicated metastable energy states spawning the existence of these fractal clusters .",
    "so we have demonstrated the possible existence of a novel type of magnetic flux structure in @xmath0-ring arrays .",
    "it is also very interesting to note that `` splinter '' vortices have been experimentally found and to originate in a linear array of 0 and @xmath0-junctions @xcite .",
    "it may be that arrays of @xmath0-junctions can also be created to discover experimental evidence for new vortex -anti - vortex structures and glasses ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we have analyzed systems of josephson @xmath0-rings that individually contain any number of normal josephson junctions and one @xmath0-junction .",
    "these @xmath0-rings generate spontaneous magnetizations in the absence of a magnetic field .",
    "the number of rings in the system gives a distinctive spectral definition to the phase distribution as a function of the coupling parameter and the inductances of the system .",
    "the characteristics of odd and even numbers of rings gives slightly differing fractal patterns : even numbers of rings have an @xmath42 state , whilst odd numbers do not .",
    "the results contained in this analysis may be of interest for applications such as the creation of reversible logic devices , quantum computation @xcite , parametric amplifiers and various metamaterial designs exploiting the low loss , negative permeability states of the system .",
    "the supercurrent in a single ring can flow in a clockwise direction , resulting in a downward magnetic moment .",
    "flowing in the opposite direction ( anticlockwise ) the moment arises with an opposite polarity .",
    "the rings analyzed here are isolated from one another ( no electronic coupling ) and are thus coupled magnetically through mutual inductance .",
    "the application of small magnetic bias fields further manipulate the spontaneous currents and move the system from the ground state into a metastable state . upon examining the ground states of these superconducting rings we have discovered the possibility of fractal patterns that describe the magnitude and the orientations of these fluxes .",
    "these appear as dragonfly wing fractals .",
    "du @xmath160 @xmath161 have shown that squid arrays can be stable and bi - stable metamaterials @xcite and rakhmanov @xmath160 @xmath161 have developed quantum metamaterials @xcite .",
    "we propose the @xmath0-ring array as a further enhancement upon this .",
    "our description of the interactions between rings gives the ability to predict the behavior of small and large arrays that generate their own controllable interaction through the remarkable spontaneous generation of flux .",
    "the influence of external radiation on a superconductor array @xcite can change the spectral pattern of the system , making the possibility for using these systems as sensitive detectors of electromagnetic fields .",
    "the analysis demonstrates the possible existence of a spectrum of spontaneous fluxes and hence the propensity for hysteresis paths between the multitude of flux - states to exist .",
