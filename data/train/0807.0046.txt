    "a transfer of an unknown state is a primary object of quantum information science .",
    "since the phrase `` unknown state '' suggests that the physical system is possibly entangled with another system , the foundation of this object can be related with the change of quantum correlation thorough the transfer process . associated with the maintenance of the inseparability ,",
    "a distinguishing class of local operations is the so - called _ entanglement breaking _ ( eb ) channel that breaks any entanglement , i.e. , a local operation @xmath0 is eb if @xmath1 is a separable state for any state @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "it is well - known that an operation is eb if and only if it can be written as a _ measure - and - prepare _ ( m&p )",
    "scheme that assigns the output states based on the classical data obtained by the measurement of the input states .",
    "when a process is not a m&p scheme , there exists an entangled state that maintains inseparability after the process and it can transmit non - classical correlations .",
    "hence , it is natural to say that the process is in _ quantum domain _ ( qd ) if the process is not a m&p scheme .",
    "this poses clear distinction between quantum processes and classical processes firmly based on the maintenance of quantum correlation . in quantum information theory ,",
    "the local operation and classical communication ( locc ) is set free to use , hence , the quantum channel is only useful if it can not be simulated by locc .",
    "the assurance of qd processes tells us that a given quantum channel is different from any locc channel .",
    "subsequently , the criterion for qd processes has been quantum benchmark of the experimental success of core physical processes , such as transmission or storage of quantum states @xcite .",
    "mathematically , the set of qd channels is connected with a set of inseparable states by jamiolkowski isomorphism @xcite , and the concept of qd is considered to be the inseparability of quantum channels @xcite .    in principle",
    ", one can determine a given process by the process tomography , and check the necessary and sufficient condition for eb channel @xcite .",
    "however , tomographic reconstruction is not always easy to perform . assuming a practical channel and a limited set of experimental parameters , several qd criteria have been proposed associated with the quantum key distribution ( qkd ) @xcite .",
    "thereby , the problem is rather identified as a type of entanglement verification / detection and the formulations are deeply related with the entanglement witness @xcite . on the other hand , it might be more direct to demonstrate better - than - classical performance by introducing certain figure of merit when one shows the success of experiments .",
    "a familiar approach is to investigate the average fidelity of the process with respect to an ensemble of states @xcite . if one can find the upperbound of the average fidelity achieved by the m&p schemes , surpassing the bound is a sufficient condition of qd processes @xcite .",
    "the optimization problem of the average fidelity is also investigated in the state estimation and optimal cloning @xcite .    aside from the quantum inseparability ,",
    "an assurance of genuine quantum devices could be that not only a set of orthogonal states but also a set of their supperpositions is coherently transferred .",
    "as in the sprit of the two - state qkd scheme @xcite , the coherence can be demonstrated by testing with two non - orthogonal states , and it would be important to construct an experimentally simpler verification scheme of qd processes as well as a solid foundation on the primary object .",
    "based on the transmission of binary coherent states and quadrature measurements , a verification scheme is developed in @xcite . a general approach that concerns the average fidelity for two non",
    "- orthogonal states is found in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we construct a simple verification scheme of qd processes using two non - orthogonal states as a variant of @xcite .",
    "the setup is as follows : a pair of pure states @xmath3 with non - zero overlap is prepared and experiences a physical process @xmath4 .",
    "suppose that the process @xmath4 converts the input states as @xmath5 , and the projection probabilities of the output onto the pair of target states @xmath6 , say @xmath7 and @xmath8 , are measured .",
    "we show the condition on @xmath9 and @xmath10 that ensures that the process is in qd .",
    "we derive the criterion in sec .",
    "ii and consider applications for quantum - optical experiments in sec .",
    "we make a conclusion in sec .",
    "any physical process is described by a completely positive trace - preserving ( cptp ) map @xcite .",
    "we define the average fidelity on a process @xmath4 with respect to the transformation task from a set of input states @xmath11 to a set of _ target _ states @xmath12 with a prior distribution @xmath13 @xcite by @xmath14 the process is simulated by the m&p schemes when we can write @xmath15 where @xmath16 is a positive - operator valued measure ( povm ) and @xmath17 is a density operator .",
    "the classical boundary of the average fidelity for the task @xmath18 is defined by the optimization over the m&p schemes : @xmath19 where @xmath20 denotes operator norm .",
    "we can verify the process @xmath4 is in qd if measured @xmath21 exceeds @xmath22 .",
    "note that the optimization problem reduces to the problem of the minimum error discrimination ( med ) @xcite when @xmath23 . in this case",
    "we can see that @xmath24 for any cptp , and the orthogonal - target task is not useful to make the qd verification scheme .",
    "an interesting point is that the quantum correlation gains the score if the problem moves from the point of the med problem . with the non - orthogonality between the target",
    "states @xmath25 as a parameter we can work on a unified framework that includes the two widely investigated class of the problems : the state estimation @xmath26 @xcite and the med problem .",
    "the relation between the two problems was discussed in a different aspect @xcite .",
    "we start the two - state case by denoting @xmath27 and all the relations between the states are described by two parameters @xmath28 the upperbound @xmath22 can be obtained by following the discussion given by fuchs and sasaki @xcite where @xmath29 , however , the proof of the bound is somewhat complicated . here , we provide a different derivation of @xmath22 and the proof is quite simpler . by choosing the orthogonal basis of the target states @xmath30 ,",
    "we can write @xmath31 where we defined @xmath32 and @xmath33 then we have @xmath34 and @xmath35    let us choose the orthogonal basis of the input states @xmath36 , and define the pauli operators by @xmath37 .",

    "( [ pz ] , [ px ] , [ fc2 ] ) , we obtain @xmath56 the upperbound is achievable by the povm with two elements , @xmath57 and @xmath58 , which form spectral decomposition of @xmath59 .",
    "therefore , we obtain @xmath60 where we introduced the key parameter that represents the `` total non - orthogonalty '' of the state transformation @xmath61 this quantity measures the non - orthogonality of the input states @xmath62 with respect to the non - orthogonal axes @xmath63 . when the target states are orthogonal @xmath64 reduces to @xmath62 and @xmath22 corresponds to the success probability of med for the two - state ensemble @xmath65 .",
    "it is worth noting that in the two - dimensional case the extreme eb map is _ classical - quantum _ ( cq ) map , that is , the measurement is orthogonal projection ( see , th . 5 ( d ) of @xcite ) .",
    "our approach here is in a sense to find the extreme point of eb maps .",
    "hence , the same result will be obtained by restricting the optimization over cq maps .",
    "another approach for the optimization problem is found in a different context @xcite .",
    "the optimization of @xmath21 over cptp maps is considered in @xcite .",
    "now we proceed to make the criterion for qd processes given the observed probabilities , @xmath66 and @xmath67 , where @xmath5 is the output of the channel corresponds to the input @xmath68 . with the expression of the classical boundary fidelity @xmath22 of eq .",
    "( [ ec ] ) , the problem is the existence of @xmath69 that satisfies @xmath70 .",

    ", we can obtain @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the solution of the equation @xmath83 . from elementary calculation",
    "we obtain a simple qd condition in terms of the direct arithmetic mean @xmath84 , the slope @xmath85 , and the overlaps @xmath86 and @xmath87 , those are in @xmath64 defined by eq .",
    "( [ b ] ) : @xmath88 typical behavior of the boundary with respect to @xmath9 and @xmath10 for various @xmath64 is shown in fig .",

    "( b)the classical - quantum boundary for the fidelities @xmath9 and @xmath10 specified by criterion ( [ cr ] ) is shown for @xmath89 , and @xmath90 .",
    "[ legendre1],width=325 ]    this criterion provides a relation between the change of `` purity '' and the change of non - orthogonality in order that the process maintains the inseparability ( the fidelities give a lowerbound of the purity and operator norm of the output states such as @xmath91 and @xmath92 ) .",
    "certainly , the criterion is satisfied if both of the input states preserves the purity , i.e. , @xmath93 .",
    "moreover , it is known that a qubit channel is eb channel if it transforms a pure two - qubit entangled states into a separable state @xcite .",
    "hence , if our criterion is satisfied , we can fine a set of pure two - qubit entangled states whose inseparability survives after the local process . it might be valuable to consider the case where the input states are mixed states .",
    "suppose that the input mixed states @xmath94 are prepared by subjecting a cptp map @xmath95 on a pair of pure states @xmath96 .",
    "if the total process @xmath97 is in qd , it is clear that @xmath4 is in qd .",
    "then , we can use the criterion assuming the task @xmath98 . since the condition that there exists a cptp @xmath95 satisfying @xmath99 is @xmath100",
    ", we obtain the criterion in the case of mixed input by replacing @xmath62 with the uhlmann fidelity @xmath101 .",
    "in quantum optical experiments , one of the most accessible state is the optical coherent state @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the displacement operator and @xmath104 is the vacuum state defined by @xmath105 . in many situations ,",
    "the ideal lossy channel is useful to describe the transmission of the coherent state as a first approximation .",
    "the ideal lossy channel with the transmission @xmath106 transforms the coherent state as @xmath107 .",
    "this evolution preserves the purity and the ideal lossy channel is clearly in qd .",
    "a natural question is the maintenance of coherence in the presence of excess noise @xcite . for the case of gaussian - distributed input",
    "coherent states on the phase - space , one can find qd criteria where the noise is measured in terms of quadrature variance @xcite or average fidelity @xcite .    in order to apply our criterion for",
    "a lossy channel one may use the binary coherent state @xmath108 and choose @xmath109 .",
    "we can take @xmath110 without loss of generality .",
    "the experimental data @xmath9 and @xmath10 are directly measured by the photon detection after appropriate phase - space displacement @xcite .",
    "the threshold photon detector discriminates the more - than - one - photon states from the vacuum state , and the measurement statistics give the probability of the projection to the vacuum state @xmath111 .",
    "hence , the photon detection after the displacement @xmath112 gives the projection probability to the coherent states @xmath113 so that @xmath114 = \\textrm{tr }   \\left [ \\hat \\rho   \\hat d(\\alpha)|0 \\rangle\\langle 0| \\hat d^\\dagger ( \\alpha ) \\right ] = \\langle \\alpha |   \\hat \\rho | \\alpha \\rangle$ ]",
    ". therefore , in this case , the verification scheme can be realized in a common quantum optical experimental technology of preparation of binary coherent states , displacement , and threshold photon detection .    since",
    "any minimum uncertain state is a pure state , the `` purity '' can be connected with the noise of the quadratures . actually , it is possible to estimate a lower bound of @xmath9 and @xmath10 by homodyne measurements .",

    "there is a different qd criterion that directly concerns quadrature noises @xcite , which is formulated to verify the entanglement between an optical mode and a qubit , e.g. , @xmath121 .",
    "this criterion requires the measurements of four observable @xmath122 for each of the two input states @xmath123 , and uses eight quantities .",
    "the derivation of the criterion is based on the negative partial transpose of the virtual entangled states . on the other hand",
    ", the present method is derived based on the optimization of m&p schemes and requires measurements of one observable for each of the input states , i.e. , we use only two quantities , @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "an interesting application of the qd criterion is the proof of entanglement assistance for the quantum teleportation . in the innsbruck first experiment of teleportation @xcite ,",
    "the transmission of the two polarized single - photon states with the relative angle of @xmath124 were considered . in this case",

    "the objective of the use of our criterion is to find a workable qubit subspace embedded in the higher dimensional space .",
    "if a squeezed vacuum state is generated , one can prepare a set of non - orthogonal states by applying phase rotations on the squeezed vacuum .",
