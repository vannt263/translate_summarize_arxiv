    "since their discovery thirty years ago ( muller  1963 ) , the nature and origin of high velocity clouds ( hvcs ) has remained highly controversial .",
    "their chequered history has been discussed by verschuur ( 1988 ) and wakker & van woerden ( 1997 ) .",
    "hvcs @xmath4 which cover at least a third of the sky @xmath4 are concentrations of neutral hydrogen with velocities which do not conform to a simple model of galactic rotation .",
    "few , if any , clouds have reliable distance determinations , which has encouraged wide ranging speculation as to their origin . explanations ( assumed distances are given in parentheses ) range from local supernova remnants ( @xmath9100 pc ) , large - scale expanding motions in nearby spiral arms ( @xmath10 1 kpc ) , condensations in the local galactic halo ( @xmath9 1 kpc ) , structures in the galactic warp ( 5@xmath420 kpc ) , tidal disruptions of the magellanic clouds ( 20@xmath450 kpc ) , intergalactic gas ( @xmath11 50 kpc ) or protogalaxies ( @xmath9500 kpc ) .",
    "the distance uncertainty continues to be the major stumbling block in understanding hvcs ( schwarz , wakker & van woerden 1995 ) since the cloud density and mass scale inversely with distance , and as the square of the distance , respectively .",
    "ferrara & field ( 1994 ; see also wolfire  1995 ) have suggested one possible method for systematic distance determinations based on the core / envelope structure observed in some hvcs ( cram & giovanelli 1976 ) .",
    "part of the problem is that , besides  observations , it has proved difficult to detect hvcs in other spectral windows ( wakker & boulanger 1986 ; colgan , salpeter & terzian 1990 ) .",
    "initially , the prospect of optical emission line detections of hvcs looked bleak .",
    "reynolds ( 1987 ) did not detect any of six hvcs in the range  @xmath12 @xmath13 pc with the fabry - perot ` staring ' technique .",
    "but there have since been many attempts to detect hvcs at wavelengths other than , with sensitive  observations having the highest success rate .",
    "wakker & van woerden ( 1997 ) list the following published  detections of hvcs : hvc 168 - 43 - 280 ( 0.08 r , kutyrev & reynolds 1989 ) , cloud m  ii ( 0.1 - 0.2 r ; munch & pitz 1990 ) , complex c ( 0.03 r , songaila  1989 ; 0.09 r , tufte  1998 ) and the magellanic stream ( ms  ii , ms  iii , and ms  iv , at 0.37 , 0.21 , and 0.20 r respectively ; weiner & williams 1996 ) .",
    "other optical detections of hvcs rely primarily on absorption line studies .",
    "this work can be used to constrain distances and determine metallicities ( i.e. magellanic metallicities in lu  1998 ; see also schwarz , wakker & van woerden 1995 ) .",
    "most detections of visual band and/or ultraviolet absorption by metal ions are listed in table 3 of wakker & van woerden ( 1997 ) .",
    "the ions most commonly detected are , , and .",
    "van woerden  ( 1997 ) recently used ca k absorption to determine an upper limit on the distance to complex a , giving 4@xmath411 kpc as the first distance bracket for an hvc .",
    "hst is frequently used to search for the uv absorption lines , with the most recent detection by sahu & blades ( 1997 ) of  towards hvc 487 .",
    "all co observations of hvcs have resulted in non - detections ( hulsbosch 1978 ; giovanelli 1986 ; kim  1989 ) , indicating that some hvcs are further than 3 kpc away . though previous searches for far infrared emission have been negative ( wakker & boulanger 1986 ; bates   1988 ; fong  1987 ) , ivesic & christodoulou ( 1997 ) searched the iras point source catalog and found possible young stellar objects in the  cores of the m cloud and complex h.    there have been claims for enhanced x - ray emission towards hvcs from rosat observations , towards complex m near m  i and m  ii ( herbstmeier 1995 ) , and possibly from complex c ( kerp 1996 ) .",
    "blom ( 1997 ) claims extended mev emission is associated with hvc complexes m and a , in the same location as associated diffuse soft x - rays .",
    "absorption at 21 cm has been more successful for hvc detection .",
    "it yields a measurement of the hydrogen spin temperature , t@xmath14 , and can be used to determine the kinetic gas temperature ( dickey 1979 ; liszt 1983 ) .",
    "the results of this work generally yield temperatures between 50@xmath4100k .",
    "colgan  ( 1990 ) finds t@xmath14 @xmath11 20 - 70k for the anticentre clouds , t@xmath14",
    "@xmath11 20k for hvc 43 - 13 - 309 , and t@xmath14 @xmath11 10k for the magellanic stream . mebold ( 1991 )",
    "find t@xmath14 @xmath11 50k for another position in the magellanic stream .",
    "definitive results include two components at 70k and 300k in cloud r ( payne  1978 ; payne  1980 ) and 50k for complex h ( wakker  1991 ) .",
    "we now present the first simultaneous detection of more than one emission line towards an hvc .",

    "an in - focus , focal plane , colander mask was used to ensure that low - order ghosts fall outside the field of view .",
    "the taurus-2 f/8 pupil diameter is 59.9 mm which is oversized for the 50 mm diameter etalon . due to uncertainties of the precise location of the optical cavity within the etalon , we placed a 45.0 mm aperture stop immediately in front of the etalon .",
    "the pupil stop introduced a major loss of light ( 50% ) compounded by a cassegrain hole which is 17% of the total pupil area .",

    "the observational set - up was the same except for a 75 mm blocking filter centered at 6585  which was not baffled thereby producing a field of view similar to the f/8 observations .",
    "observations were made at two closely spaced positions on the smith cloud and at a sky position 15@xmath8 away ( fig .",
    "[ himom ] ) .",
    "the etalon was used at fixed gap spacings and the resulting ring pattern was imaged onto a tek 1024@xmath19 ccd with pixel scales of 0.594   pix@xmath20 ( f/8 ) and 0.315  pix@xmath20 ( f/15 ) , with a read noise of 2.3e@xmath21 .",
    "the wavelength range is dispersed quadratically over the 5  field at 1  resolution with blue wavelengths to the north . at both foci",

    "observations were also made in the direction of the south galactic pole ( bland - hawthorn , freeman & quinn 1997 , hereafter bfq ) , and twilight flats were taken on all nights with and without the etalon .",
    "we begin by establishing the optical axis of the incomplete calibration rings to better than 0.1 pix .",
    "this was achieved with orthogonal distance regression .",
    "next , we azimuthally bin the calibration rings for all nights to ensure that ( a ) there were no opto - mechanical shifts , ( b ) the instrumental response was constant , and ( c ) the etalon gap zero - point was constant from night to night . in ( b ) , the etalon was found to behave reliably except that there was a slow drift in the optical gap just after twilight on the second night .",
    "three exposures for the smith ii field were not used . in total",
    ", we obtained a total of 2.0 hrs on smith i , 3.7 hrs on smith ii , and 2.0 hrs for the offset sky position .",
    "we also have about six hours of observation for each night towards the south galactic pole ( bfq ) .",
    "some calibration spectra showed baseline variations after binning over different parts of the field .",
    "this arises from illumination ( vignette ) effects , stray light , chip structure and ccd fringeing which can be divided out reliably with flatfields .",
    "the spectral bandpass seen by individual pixels is roughly 1  where the bandpass centroid declines by 40  from the optical axis to the field edge .",
    "twilight flats were found to be the most reliable except that the fraunhofer spectrum leaves its imprint in the data .",
    "we divide out the solar spectrum from the flatfield by establishing the mean spectrum and then generating a polar image with this spectrum . occasionally , the flatfields leave residual fringe structure in the data .",
    "it is possible to remove this with azimuthal smoothing but potentially informative , intensity variations in the data will be washed out .",
    "ccd fringing constitutes the main systematic error in diffuse detection and provides a major challenge to achieving deeper detection limits than that quoted by bland - hawthorn  ( 1994 ; hereafter btvs ) .",
    "the response of the blocking filter is removed in the twilight division .    to obtain discrete spectra from the summed ccd images ,",
    "the data were divided into annular rings one pixel wide . within each annulus",
    ", we can calculate the mean , median or mode of the histogram .",
    "cosmic ray events appear as outliers and are therefore easily removed .",
    "we achieved better results when removing the high density of stars across the field due to the low galactic latitude .",
    "for all fields , we obtained a short exposure image through the blocking filter without the etalon .",
    "this enabled us to identify compact sources and to mask out these pixels .",
    "typically 12% of the pixels were removed in this way .    in order to demonstrate that the flatfielding was adequate , we divided each summed image into left and right halves and then differenced them ( see fig .",
    "[ left_right]@xmath22 ) . the residual for the brightest line is less than 1% of peak intensity . across the full bandpass",
    ", the residual has a dispersion of 0.9 cts .",
    "the positive residual feature at @xmath236564.12 appears to be real ( see below ) . in fig .",
    "[ left_right]@xmath24 , we show our best model fit to the line from the d lamp . once again , the residual is better than 1% of peak intensity .",
    "while our spectral bandpass is only 40 , it comprises typically 3@xmath44 oh lines , a geocoronal line , reynolds layer emission at both  and , and 1@xmath42 continuum features from scattered solar and lunar light .",
    "these features provide fundamental calibrations of serendipitous detections within the band .",
    "the oh emission arises from vibrationally and rotationally excited oh molecules in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere ( 80 - 100 km altitude ) due to reactions between h@xmath25 and o@xmath26 .",
    "the propagation of density and temperature differences through the atmosphere can cause large variations in both the relative and absolute intensity of the oh lines with periods as short as a few minutes ( adams & skrutskie 1996 ) . in fig .",
    "[ oh ] , we show the temporal dependence of the oh lines , geocoronal , and the sky continuum with respect to local midnight for three consecutive nights .",
    "but the dominant effect in our 20 min exposures is the increasing average intensity with the zenith angle of the observation ( van rhijn 1921 ; kondratyev 1969 ) .",
    "the oh lines in our bandpass arise from the p@xmath27 and p@xmath28 branches and vary in an identical manner .",
    "osterbrock & martel ( 1992 ) use oh lines at high spectral resolution to achieve wavelength calibrations to better than 0.04 but over our bandpass we achieve 0.01  at 1@xmath3 for the brightest line",
    ".    there are four discrete components to the  region . in fig .",
    "[ oh ] , the geocoronal lines reaches a minimum at local midnight and rises exponentially towards dawn .",
    "close to twilight or in strong moonlight , fraunhofer  absorption is clearly seen in the night sky spectrum .",
    "this is only apparent in the first few frames of our data on each night and is therefore easily corrected for .",
    "there are additional contributions from the reynolds layer , and a third redshifted component due to the high velocity cloud .",
    "the absolute variation of the geocoronal  emission is extremely well behaved from night to night .",
    "we are able to predict the strength of this atmospheric line to better than 5% after the first night .",
    "the central wavelength was measured at @xmath236562.73 which we could clearly distinguish from the d lamp wavelength  @xmath236562.80 at the 3@xmath3 level ( cf .",
    "yelle & roesler 1985 ) .",
    "the geocoronal emission arises from the exosphere at 500 km altitude due to solar ly@xmath29 excitation of neutral hydrogen .",
    "this process only excites the 3@xmath19p@xmath30 levels which decay to 2@xmath19s@xmath31 , in contrast to the discharge lamp where all fine structure levels are excited . since galactic emission is seen in all of our data , it was necessary to difference an observation near twilight with a later observation to measure the central wavelength of the exospheric contribution .",
    "the radial velocity at peak intensity of the reynolds layer  and  emission , using new wavelengths from spyromilio ( 1995 ) , provides an independent measurement of the earth - sun motion with respect to the local standard of rest .",
    "indeed , reynolds ( personal communication , 1997 ) uses this fact to isolate the galactic emission by up to 30  with a suitable choice of observing season .",
    "apart from extremely precise wavelength calibration , the geocoronal and reynolds layer emission ( and to some extent , the sky continuum ) are sensitive to the presence of cirrus . on the third night ( fig .",
    "[ oh ] ) , we stopped observing for a short time an hour after midnight .",
    "note the presence of cirrus on both the sky level and the geocoronal emission .",
    "cirrus tends to scatter more light into the beam . for all nights ,",
    "the conditions were almost always consistently photometric as judged by the reynolds layer emission .",
    "the photometric calibration was achieved using both line and continuum flux standards ( table 1 ) .",
    "for good sky subtraction , we find that it is always necessary to scale the sky lines by some factor even when interleaving sky with source observations .",
    "( an important exception is telescope nodding coupled with charge shuffling using an oversized detector now implemented at the aat . )",
    "so we obtained sequential sky observations at a comparable airmass after observing the source . after fitting a fraser - suzuki ( 1969 ) function to a calibration line",
    ", the fit was used to scale the night sky lines before subtracting from the source spectra .",
    "the fraser - suzuki function is a 5-parameter composite of lorentzian and gaussian functions that allows for fine adjustment between symmetric and asymmetric line profiles .    the geocoronal  uncertainties in subtraction amount to less than 100 mr at the lsr velocity from frame to frame .",
    "the model subtraction affects the reynolds emission centroid at the level of @xmath91 km / s .",
    "this could influence the absolute calibration of line fluxes for the smith cloud at the level of 20% .",
    "btvs determine the deepest  detection possible ( 10@xmath32r at 1@xmath3 ) phot @xmath33 s@xmath20 sr@xmath20 or 2.41@xmath1710@xmath34 erg @xmath33 s@xmath20 sr@xmath20 at . ] for a diffuse source of emission which fills the field . for sources with small projected velocities ,",
    "this is only possible for observations close to midnight and towards the galactic poles , in order to suppress both galactic and exospheric emission .",
    "the current limit is largely set by systematics due to flatfield structure .",
    "the smith cloud was first identified in 1963 as having a large positive velocity in the direction of the galactic centre ( smith 1963 ) .",
    "wakker & van woerden ( 1991 ) subsequently noted that there are smaller  clouds associated with this complex ( ` gcp ' ) , and that the radial velocity is only 25  in excess of their galactic rotation model ( cf .",
    "fig .  1 of wakker 1991 ) .",
    "integrated hi and individual velocity channel maps for the smith cloud are shown in figs .",
    "[ himom ] and [ hichan ] , respectively , and were constructed from hartmann & burton s ( 1997 ) leiden / dwingeloo survey ( lds ) .",
    "the cloud has a complex morphology with the peak in  intensity at  @xmath1 100 .",
    "an intense knot is seen at a galactic latitude @xmath35 with faint streamers extending to @xmath36 .",
    "the structure is reminiscent of the cometary morphology of some of the cloud complexes in the magellanic stream ( mathewson & ford 1984 ) .",
    "table [ tbl : tbl2 ] summarises the characteristics of the four primary all - sky hvc surveys . while the lds may suffer somewhat due to its higher hi detection limit , its vastly superior velocity resolution makes it the only survey suitable for studying the internal dynamics of hvcs .",
    "the pgf98 hvc survey , being carried out in tandem with the hi parkes all - sky survey ( staveley - smith 1997 ) , will offer at least an order of magnitude improvement over the only previous southern survey ( b85 ) , in terms of spatial sampling , with the added benefit of a factor of @xmath37 increase in survey sensitivity and increased resolution .",
    "compact isolated hvcs , @xmath38% of which would have been missed by b85 , will be a unique contribution of the pgf98 survey .",
    "the dramatic improvement in positional accuracy for both existing , and newly discovered , southern hvcs will be an important aspect of the pgf98 work , particularly for future taurus-2 emission - line work , as the existing b85 positions are severely compromised by the @xmath39 sampling grid .    in our hvc observing programme",
    ", we try to ensure that the small field - of - view of taurus-2 is actually sampling the peak of the hi emission .",
    "but the new lds data reveal that we are not always successful .",
    "the taurus-2 field positions are indicated in fig .",
    "[ himom ] .",
    "the sky position was chosen to be at roughly the same galactic latitude in order to match the reynolds layer contribution .",
    "this worked surprisingly well given that the wham survey of the northern sky has now shown the reynolds layer emission to be highly structured ( reynolds  1998 ) .    [ cols=\"<,<,<,>,<,<,^ \" , ]      in fig .",

    "the reynolds layer is easily detected in  at all positions , in  at smith i and ii , and only weakly in  at the offset position .",
    "smith i and the sky position are affected by fraunhofer  absorption indicated by ` f ' on the blue wing .",

    "we have superimposed the residual spectra for both nights of the smith ii observations .",
    "these agree remarkably well in accordance with the excellent photometric conditions .",

    "no  emission is seen beyond about 50 , and this also holds for the [ nii ] and  emission .",
    "the [ nii]/  ratio is roughly 0.15 , typical of solar - abundance  regions than the warm ionised medium .",

    "these ratios are factors of @xmath2 times higher than observed in the reynolds layer emission ( @xmath43 ) , and @xmath44 times higher than reported for high latitude gas in spirals .",

    "the first limit is ruled out by the neutral gas fraction along the stream ( bland - hawthorn & maloney 1997 ) , but we include this model for illustration and interpolation .    in fig .",

    "the trend is much slower at larger vertical distances as the cloud face absorbs flux from most of the disk , and the secant opacity law has only a small effect .",
    "the galactic latitude of the smith cloud ( @xmath50 @xmath87 ) provides a further constraint . from equation",
    "( 1 ) , the vertical cloud distance , @xmath80 , is related to the galactic radius @xmath63 for a fixed galactic coordinate position , since @xmath88 this equation is used to derive the bold curves in figs .",
    "[ em]@xmath22 and [ em]@xmath89 .",
    "note that even though the curves go through a maximum , there is no distance ambiguity for an observed  flux due to the latitude constraint in equation  [ lat ] .",
    "we evaluate the distance for a mean  surface brightness of 0.27r .",
    "the systematic error in separating the hvc from the reynolds contribution dominates and leads to a projected distance @xmath90 kpc ( fig .",
    "[ em]@xmath22 ) .",
    "this assumes we are observing through an optically thick facet of the cloud parallel with the galactic plane .",
    "if instead we are observing the face which maximises the received flux from the galaxy ( fig .",
    "[ em]@xmath89 ) , the derived ( projected ) distance is @xmath91 kpc . across both models , and correcting for the vertical height ( equation  [ lat ] ) , we determine that the true cloud distance is @xmath92 kpc .",
    "prima facie , it may seem surprising that the maximum flux model does not produce a significantly larger distance for the cloud .",
    "but the correction factors in equation  [ factor ] favour the ` downward face ' model , and largely compensate for the extra flux received by the ` maximising face ' model when @xmath93 ( see fig .  [ model ] ) .    in practice , we do not doubt that the true uncertainty is considerably larger .",
    "these models assume that the covering fraction of the hi slab is unity as seen by the ionising photons , and that the galactic dust and ionising sources are smoothly distributed .",
    "the unobscured uv luminosity from the disk is known to better than a factor of two ( bm ) .",
    "we suspect that the emergent uv at the distance of the magellanic stream is probably good to a factor of @xmath94 .",
    "this leads to a much larger uncertainty ( fig .",
    "[ em ] ) of 4 kpc in our distance estimation .",
    "therefore , we derive a cloud distance of @xmath95 kpc , which corresponds to a galactic radius of @xmath96 kpc ( equation  [ dist ] ) .",
    "we have looked at the complex problem of cloud geometry and porosity for a range of cloud distributions ( e.g. fractals ; see pfenniger & combes 1994 ) .",
    "the surfaces of these clouds are ` heated ' by both isotropic and anisotropic sources of ionisation .",
    "our simulations produce clouds that are roughly spheroidal .",
    "we find that ` volume brightened ' clouds at 21 cm , with large filling factors , can exhibit ` limb brightening ' at  over much of the smith cloud on arcminute scales .    the expected contrast level @xmath97 is given roughly by @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the depth of the ionised layer , @xmath100 is the radius of curvature at the ionised surface , and @xmath101 is the beam size .",
    "the plasma thickness is roughly @xmath102 pc , where @xmath103 ( cm@xmath32 ) is the neutral gas density at the cloud surface . for data of sufficient quality",
    ", we recommend dividing up the data to see if higher levels of  contrast and variance are apparent .    for our data",
    ", we require the full 5  field to obtain sufficient signal . if we take @xmath104  at the bright tip of the smith cloud ( fig .",
    "[ himom ] ) , equation  [ limb ] predicts that limb brightening should be observable ( @xmath105 ) .",
    "the observed variance ( in the absence of limb brightening ) is expected to be no greater than 50% or so .",
    "more reliable estimates of hvc distances will come from complete maps over the projected cloud surface in order to identify local enhancements due to the surface geometry .",
    "the surface ionisation of clouds close to the disk will be highly susceptible to the poorly known distribution of dust and uv sources , not to mention shadowing of the disk by other hvcs .",
    "but it is anticipated that more distant hvcs will reveal more uniform emission over the cloud surface compared to hvcs closer to the disk . indeed , the  variances , the degree of limb brightening and the mean flux level , taken together , are needed to improve the reliability of the  distance method .    for the smith cloud flux levels , the galactic coronal emission ( fig .  [ em]@xmath24 ) is not expected to influence our distance estimate . in fig .",
    "[ em]@xmath106 , we show the expected flux levels on the upper side of the  cloud which , for the most part , are undetectable ( btvs ) . thus we anticipate that , in general , the observed limb brightening at  due to disk ionisation will be highly asymmetric .",
    "wakker & van woerden ( 1991 ) determine that the smith complex extends over 44 square degrees with a flux density of @xmath107 jy .",
    "if this cloud lies near the tangent point , the  mass is @xmath108  ( corrected to a solar radius of 8.0 kpc ) . for our revised distance",
    ", we derive a cloud mass of @xmath109 .",
    "a crucial assumption of our model is that the halo radiation field at the surface of an hvc is dominated by the young stellar disk .",
    "but gas heated by supernovae can puncture the cold disk and escape into the halo ( norman & ikeuchi 1989 ) .",
    "the hot halo gas may form a galactic wind , a hydrostatic atmosphere around the galaxy or , more likely , it may eventually cool , recombine and descend onto the disk , establishing a galactic fountain ( shapiro & field 1976 ; bregman 1980 ; houck & bregman 1990 ; shapiro & benjamin 1991 ) . in this picture , the galactic fountain is largely responsible for the hot corona and may possibly explain hvcs as material involved in the circulation process ( but see wakker & van woerden 1991 ) .",
    "the cool , descending gas of the galactic fountain would be detectable at anomalous velocities in 21 cm emission .",
    "theoretically , the maximum velocity of gas streaming to the disk is roughly 100 km s@xmath20 .",
    "high apparent velocities are predicted only for distant clouds , because of the particular mechanism of acceleration in combination with projection effects induced by galactic rotation .",
    "thus , the model can explain the existence of gas with velocities up to 200 km s@xmath20 , but not if it is generally nearby",
    ".    the importance of detecting hvcs in more than one emission line can not be overstated .",
    "a fountain is expected to produce strong low ionisation lines ( , , , etc . )",
    "due to shocks and perhaps metal - enriched material from the central disk ( shapiro & benjamin 1991 ) .",
    "the few hvcs with constrained metallicities have abundances no more than one third of solar abundance ( de boer & savage 1984 ; blades  1988 ) . while metal abundances are uncertain , the emission lines provide an important diagnostic , particularly in constraining the ionisation parameter .",
    "detailed line ratios have been computed for a range of ionising sources , including shocks , non - thermal power laws , and hot young stars observed through an opaque medium ( mathis 1986 ; veilleux & osterbrock 1987 ; sokolowski 1992 ; sutherland & dopita 1993 ; shapiro & benjamin 1991 ) .",
    "if the surfaces of hvcs are collisionally ionised , it is unlikely that   can give a useful constraint on distance .",
    "however , as noted in @xmath154.2 , the /  ratio peaks within 10   of the  velocity .",
    "this is a major problem for shock ionisation models where the emitting regions arise from downstream gas and are therefore kinematically separated from the pre - shock material ( sutherland & dopita 1993 ) .",
    "wolfire  ( 1995 ) discuss alternative sources of hvc ionisation and heating , but these are not expected to produce significant optical line emission .",
    "the galaxy is encircled by satellite galaxies which appear confined to one or two great ` streams ' across the sky ( q.v .",
    "lynden - bell & lynden - bell 1995 ) .",
    "the most renowned of these are the magellanic clouds and the associated  stream .",
    "all of these are expected to merge with the galaxy in the distant future , largely due to dynamical friction from the extended dark halo ( tremaine 1976 ) .",
    "but the most spectacular accreting satellite , the sgr dwarf , was discovered only four years ago by ibata , gilmore & irwin ( 1994 ) .",
    "sgr is approximately 25 kpc from the sun , and 16@xmath72 kpc from the galactic centre .",
    "the long axis of the prolate body ( axis ratios @xmath9 3:1:1 ) is roughly 10 kpc , oriented perpendicular to the galactic plane along @xmath110 , centred at @xmath50 .",

    "the positions of the other dwarf spheroidals are given by majewski ( 1994 ) .",
    "the smith cloud and sgr are at an identical galactic latitude , and 35  apart in longitude .",
    "recent work ( ibata , personal communication ) reveals that the angular size of sgr is close to 30  ( 12 kpc ) extending almost perpendicular to the galactic plane .",
    "the smith cloud is about half this size if the distance from the sun is comparable ; its orientation is 45  to the plane .",
    "the projected separation is slightly more than the projected extent of sgr .",
    "the difference in velocity ( @xmath960 ) is three times higher than expected for gas in dynamical equilibrium at 15 kpc around a 10@xmath113 solar mass object .",
    "the total  mass of the cloud is about 10% of the visible matter in sgr .",
    "if our distance range for the smith cloud is reliable , it suggests a possible association with the sgr dwarf . in the rest frame of the galaxy , for sgr ,  @xmath1 172  ( ibata , gilmore & irwin 1995 ) compared with  @xmath0 236  for the smith cloud ( assuming a rotation speed of 220  at the solar circle )",
    "the stretched appearance of the  is suggestive of a tidal feature in strong interactions .",
    "if the cloud constitutes a gaseous tidal arm , we predict a counterpart on the same galactic latitude ( @xmath50 ) at longitude @xmath114 , and gsr velocity @xmath9 110 .",
    "this putative cloud has an lsr velocity greater than 200  and would therefore be labelled a ` high velocity cloud ' .",
    "a direct association of the  with sgr poses problems for our current understanding of the precursor since the dominant stellar population is old ( fahlman  1996 ) with [ fe / h ] @xmath1 -1 ( whitelock , catchpole & irwin 1996 ) .",
    "since the smith cloud gas falls well beyond the expected tidal radius of sgr ( @xmath37 kpc ) , an alternative interpretation is that the smith cloud has been dislodged from the outer  disk by the impact of the sgr dwarf .",
    "such a model may be consistent with ibata  ( 1997 , fig .",
    "11 ) who use numerical simulations to show that galactic tides can force a dwarf spheroidal into a prolate shape .",
    "most models favour a short period orbit ( @xmath1151 gyr ; oh , lin & aarseth 1995 ) implying that sgr has undergone at least a dozen perigalacticon passages , consistent with the minimum age of the dominant stellar population .",
    "if future x - ray surveys detect either emission ( bone , hartquist & sandford 1983 ) or absorption ( wang & taisheng 1996 ) towards the smith cloud , this would have important ramifications .",
    "nearby  clouds have been observed in shadow against the soft x - ray background ( burrows & mendenhall 1991 ) .",
    "there have even been claims for x - ray shadows from extragalactic objects ( barber , roberts & warwick 1996 ) . after repeated attempts ,",
    "we were not allowed access to the rosat high resolution database in order to check this .",
    "the low resolution ( 40 ) , rosat all - sky survey shows no obvious emission or absorption in the direction of the smith cloud .",
    "the recent detections of the magellanic stream in  ( weiner & williams 1996 ) provided bland - hawthorn & maloney ( 1998 ) with the critical normalisation for the emergent uv flux from the galactic disk .",
    "this model has been used to predict the ionising field throughout the galactic halo .",

    "the /  is greatly enhanced at the velocity of the cloud and  must be very weak , which together indicate a dilute ionising field impinging the cloud surface .",
    "possible complications are cloud geometry , porosity , and uncertain extinction corrections .",
    "a lower mean disk opacity would put the clouds further away .",
    "we anticipate that our model is more reliable for clouds at greater vertical distances as this tends to average out structure in the distribution of uv sources .",
    "clouds within a few kpc of the galactic plane could be in relative shadow , particularly for opaque disk models .",
    "more accurate distances for hvcs will come from large  surveys with optical follow - up . a crucial development has been the availability of target lists with higher sensitivity and better resolution , in particular , the parkes  multi - beam survey ( staveley - smith 1997 ) .",
    "more recent detections at the aat are sufficiently strong to suggest that a significant number of clouds should be observable with this technique . as such",
    ", it provides a crucial test of the blitz - spergel model ( blitz  1996 ; spergel  1996 ) which places roughly half of all high velocity clouds at extragalactic distances ( @xmath116 mpc ) within the local group , in which case none of the clouds should be detectable at these levels .",
    "we have set out to present a simplified picture as a challenge to theorists and experimentalists alike .",
    "the observational programmes that we have described here only require small to medium - sized telescopes ( 0.5@xmath44 m ) since both hvc and stream clouds subtend large angles , and the line surface brightness is expected to be fairly constant over large angular scales ( @xmath117 ) .",
    "since the fabry - perot interferogram is binned azimuthally in order to produce the detection , the site does not require good seeing although it should have relatively good photometric stability .",
    "a dry site is favoured because variable water vapour features can complicate sky subtraction for @xmath10 1 @xmath13 pc .",
    "we encourage a more widespread interest in the fabry - perot ` staring ' technique as it is set to make a profound contribution to the understanding of both galactic and extragalactic radiation fields over the coming years .",
