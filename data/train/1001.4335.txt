    "repetition of the generation structure of quarks and leptons is a great mystery in particle physics .",
    "although three generation models are widely accepted , the basic principle of the standard model ( sm ) allows the sequential fourth generation ( family )  @xcite . also , the electroweak precision data does not exclude completely existence of the fourth family  @xcite .",
    "since the lhc has a discovery potential for the fourth generation quarks at early stage  @xcite , we may explore this possibility more seriously .",
    "if the fourth generation exists , it is well - known that the condensate of the fourth generation quarks @xmath0 and @xmath1 can dynamically trigger the electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb )  @xcite .",
    "in such a scenario , multiple composite higgs bosons can naturally emerge as the scalar bound states of @xmath0 , @xmath1 and other heavy fermions such as the top quark @xmath2 and the fourth family leptons @xmath3 and @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "when the composite higgs bosons composed of @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are too heavy and hence inaccessible at tevatron and lhc , the effective theory at the tev scale will be a two higgs doublet model ( thdm )  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , if the extra higgs bosons other than the sm - like higgs are decoupled  @xcite , the effective theory of the thdm is reduced into the sm with the fourth family ( sm4 ) .    in this paper , we study the sm4 and also a thdm with the fourth generation .",
    "we assume dirac - type neutrinos .",
    "models with majorana mass terms will be studied elsewhere .",
    "the yukawa couplings of the fourth generation have the landau pole , so that the sm4 or the thdm are applicable up to at most several tens tev . in this sense",
    ", it is natural to expect the existence of some strong dynamics such as topcolor models  @xcite behind the sm4/thdm .",
    "nevertheless , we will not impose the compositeness condition  @xcite , because we are interested in a wider class of models rather than the nambu - jona - lasino type one .",
    "we reanalyze the stability condition(s ) of the higgs potential for the sm4 and the thdm  @xcite , and also impose the tree level unitarity bounds on the yukawa  @xcite and higgs quartic couplings  @xcite .",
    "we then find the cutoff @xmath5 at which some new physics enters to evade the instability of the higgs potential or the perturbative description breaks down owing to appearance of some strong dynamics .",
    "the cutoff @xmath5 should not be so small .",
    "otherwise , the models are not self - contained at the tev scale . besides the theoretical restriction",
    ", we take into account the constraints on the oblique parameters  @xcite .    by varying all masses of the fourth generation fermions and the higgs boson(s ) within a reasonable parameter space",
    ", we obtain a set of favorable mass spectra .",
    "strong correlations among the masses of the fermions and the higgs bosons are found .",
    "it turns out that the higgs mass in the sm4 should be larger than roughly the @xmath0 mass , while the light cp even higgs mass in the thdm can be smaller because the dynamics of the extra higgs quartic couplings can stabilize the higgs potential against the negative contributions of the yukawa couplings .",
    "another noticeable consequence is that the decay channel @xmath6 is allowed in a wide parameter space in both of the sm4 and the thdm .",
    "the decay channel @xmath7 is not necessarily excluded . as for the higgs , a decay channel into a pair of the fourth generation neutrinos",
    "is kinematically open in a certain parameter region .",
    "depending on such possibilities , more comprehensive studies should be required .",

    "we show the renormalization group equations ( rge s ) for the sm4 and the thdm in appendix  [ rge - sm4 ] and [ sec - rge-2hdm ] , respectively .",
    "let us study the sm4 , @xmath8 with @xmath9 where @xmath10 represents the higgs doublet field , @xmath11 is defined by @xmath12 , and @xmath13 and @xmath14 denote the @xmath15-th family doublet of quarks and leptons , respectively .",
    "we take into account the yukawa couplings of the third and fourth generations , and ignore other yukawa couplings as well as the neutrino masses other than @xmath4 .",
    "as explicitly shown in @xmath16 , we simply assumed the dirac - type neutrinos .",
    "the rge s for the yukawa and higgs quartic couplings are well - known  @xcite .",
    "we show a set of the rge s for the gauge , yukawa and higgs - quartic couplings at the one - loop approximation in appendix  [ rge - sm4 ] .",
    "we explore the cutoff scale @xmath5 of the sm4 at which some new physics or nonperturbative dynamics emerges .",
    "the point is that the yukawa coupling has the landau pole at a certain energy scale @xmath17 and only an intermediate mass range of the higgs boson is allowed by the triviality and instability bounds . before the full one - loop calculation , we schematically describe nature of the rge s .",
    "let us solve analytically the rge s under the following crude approximation .",
    "the electroweak gauge couplings are negligible .",
    "although the qcd coupling is not so small , it behaves like a constant in the energy scale @xmath18 tev . on the other hand , the yukawa couplings for the fourth generation run very quickly and diverge at the landau pole .",
    "thus we may ignore all of the gauge couplings at the zeroth approximation .",
    "for simplicity , we may neglect @xmath19 and also assume that all of the fourth generation yukawa couplings are the same as @xmath20 , although it is unrealistic because owing to a relatively heavy higgs , the @xmath21-parameter constraint requires appropriate mass differences of the fourth generation fermions , which will be taken into account in the full analysis of the one - loop rge s .    under the above crude approximation ,",
    "the rge for @xmath20 is given by @xmath22 and the solution is immediately found as @xmath23 where @xmath24 is an arbitrary scale .",
    "the universal fermion mass @xmath25 is defined by @xmath26 . by definition of the landau pole @xmath17 , @xmath27",
    "and then we obtain the relation between @xmath17 and @xmath25 as @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the higgs .",
    "numerically , it yields @xmath30 for @xmath31 compared with the full one - loop calculation ( the values in the parentheses ) , the approximation works in fact .    as for the higgs sector , within the above crude approximation , the rge for @xmath32 is @xmath33 where we explicitly treated the fermion contributions to the @xmath34-function in the @xmath35-function , i.e. , below the threshold of @xmath25 , the theory is matched to the sm without the fourth generation .",
    "we can easily find that the following quantity is the rge invariant : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the mass of the physical higgs boson @xmath38 and also @xmath39 note that when @xmath40 , @xmath32 goes to infinity at the scale @xmath41 $ ] , while it does to zero at the scale @xmath42 $ ] , when @xmath43 .    for @xmath44 ,",
    "the rge for @xmath32 develops only by the @xmath45-term in the region @xmath46 , so that it does not encounter instability in this region . for @xmath47",
    ", we do not need to care about the above threshold effects .",

    "a new feature of the two higgs extension is thus characterized by the low @xmath223 regime , @xmath231 . in the @xmath100-analysis ,",
    "this regime is more favorable than the high @xmath223 one , i.e. , most of the data points inside the 68% c.l .",
    "limit of the @xmath100-constraints are for the former .",
    "the point is that even for the low @xmath223 , the higgs potential can be stable owing to the dynamics of the higgs quartic couplings .",
    "when we take into account the tevatron bounds of the fourth generation quark masses , @xmath124  gev and @xmath125  gev  @xcite , only a small parameter space is left , however .",
    "nevertheless , we here mention that the parameter region with @xmath235 is interesting , because the extra higgs masses can be almost degenerate , @xmath236 , and also a scenario with @xmath237 is possible ( see the right of fig .  [ h - tb-2hdm ] ) .",
    "we also note that even in this regime , the leptonic decays of the higgs bosons such as @xmath238 , @xmath239 and etc .",
    "are open in a certain parameter space .",
    "we have analyzed only the case of @xmath168 . if we extend our analysis with a general @xmath240 , more favorable and exotic higgs mass spectra can be found .",

    "we have reanalyzed the constraints on the mass spectrum of the fourth generation fermions and the higgs bosons for the sm4 and the thdm  ii with @xmath168 .",
    "we showed that there are the noticeable correlations among the mass spectrum of the fermions and the higgs bosons .",
    "for the sm4 , the favorable mass range of the physical higgs boson @xmath38 is @xmath102 ( @xmath104 ) for the cutoff @xmath101  tev ( @xmath103  tev ) .",
    "we also found that the favorable parameter space is mainly contained in the region , @xmath241 and @xmath242 ( see also the semicircles in lower right of fig .  [ mtp - mbp ] . )",
    "we showed the data samples corresponding to several scenarios in table  [ tab-1 ] .",
    "for the thdm  ii with @xmath168 , schematically speaking , there are two domains for the favorable mass range of the light cp even higgs @xmath148 , @xmath230 and @xmath231 .",
    "the extra heavy higgs decoupling regime is contained in the former .",
    "this is consistent with the analysis of the sm4 . on the other hand ,",
    "an almost degenerate higgs mass spectrum such as @xmath235 and @xmath236 is allowed in the latter and in a part of the former . in this case , a model with @xmath243 is not excluded .",
    "( see the right of fig .",
    "[ h - tb-2hdm ] . ) as for the value of @xmath156 , we found that @xmath244 is favorable in the both domains .",
    "concerning the decay channels of the charged leptons , we found that @xmath6 is allowed in a wide parameter space in the sm4 and the thdm  ii .",
    "( see the lower right of figs .",
    "[ mtp - mbp ] and [ mtp - mbp-2hdm ] . )",
    "the fourth generation quark masses can be degenerate @xmath245 or the decay channel @xmath7 can be open , depending on the mass difference @xmath246 .",
    "( see the lower right of figs .",
    "[ mtp - mbp ] and [ mtp - mbp-2hdm ] . ) the higgs @xmath38 in the sm4 and the light cp even higgs @xmath148 in the thdm  ii can decay into a pair of the fourth generation neutrinos .",
    "( see the right of figs .",
    "[ mtp - mh ] and [ mtp - mh-2hdm ] . )",
    "furthermore , in the thdm  ii , a scenario that all higgs bosons decay into a pair of the fourth generation leptons is possible , i.e. , @xmath228 and @xmath239 , etc .. ( for studies of collider signals of the fourth generation leptons , see , e.g. , ref .  @xcite . ) we also comment that the main decay channel of the heavy cp even higgs @xmath149 can be @xmath247 , if kinematically allowed  @xcite .",
    "thus the phenomenology of the fourth generation models is very rich .",
    "the implications of the analysis in this paper are obvious : if the tevatron and/or lhc discover @xmath0 and/or @xmath1 , the higgs mass spectrum will be suggested , depending on the models . on the other hand ,",
    "if the lhc excludes the @xmath0 and/or @xmath1 masses @xmath122  gev at early stage , a big parameter space will be gone . in this case , essentially , a nonperturbative regime will be left to be examined .",
    "many issues remain to be explored :    * we did not consider a general case of @xmath240 .",
    "there probably exist more favorable and exotic parameter regions in the thdm  ii .",
    "moreover , we may consider a different yukawa structure other than the type  ii  @xcite .",
    "* majorana neutrinos can reduce @xmath85 and @xmath21  @xcite .",
    "it may affect the mass spectrum of the fourth generation fermions and the higgs bosons .",
    "* the two - loop effects are probably relevant for more precise predictions of the mass spectrum .",
    "the theoretical lower bound for the higgs mass , which essentially corresponds to the instability bound of the higgs potential , will be almost unchanged , however , because the parameters certainly stay in a perturbative region .",
    "* we did not take into account the mixing angle between the fourth and third generations .",
    "this is , of course , very important to discuss the flavor constraints and realistic decay chains of the fourth generation quarks and leptons  @xcite .",
    "* if the main branching ratios of @xmath0 and @xmath1 are different from well - studied ones in experiments , a first evidence of the fourth generation might be found in the higgs physics , for example , as a huge enhancement of the golden mode , @xmath248 .",
    "concerning the loop induced processes , it is important to notice that the loop effects in @xmath249 , @xmath250 and @xmath251 are quite different  @xcite . related to such possibilities , there should exist very large non - decoupling effects in the triple higgs coupling arising from the fourth generation quarks and leptons  @xcite .",
    "the triple higgs coupling is testable at the lhc / vlhc / slhc  @xcite and at the ilc  @xcite .",
    "* the fourth generation model may play an important role in b - cp asymmetries  @xcite and also in the electroweak baryogenesis  @xcite . *",
    "last but not least , if only a nonperturbative regime is left in the near future , what kind of study will be relevant ?",
    "for example , when the fourth generation quarks are ultraheavy beyond the perturbative unitarity bound , is there some nonperturbative effect in the nonresonant @xmath252 process  @xcite ?",
