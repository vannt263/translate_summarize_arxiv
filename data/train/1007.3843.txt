    "a good deal of interest has been attracted by model building from f - theory @xcite .",
    "it provides a geometric description of gauge theories of all the possible lie groups , automatically incorporating nonperturbative effects @xcite .",
    "most studies are devoted to constructions of grand unified theories ( guts ) based on a simple group , because , by relatively simple setup , they allow us to access intermediate routes to the standard model ( sm ) @xcite . as a merit , we have more degrees of freedom that are absent in the conventional field theoretic guts . for example , we have nontrivial source of four - form flux which breaks gauge symmetry and/or supersymmetry . in practice , we can obtain the sm from the @xmath8 gut by turning on the flux along the hypercharge @xmath9 direction without breaking the @xmath9 itself if some topological conditions are satisfied @xcite .",
    "but for this we should take good care of supersymmetry breaking , anomaly cancellation and decoupling of the chiral @xmath10-boson . also because of the unification relation , some unobserved interactions are hard to control .    in this work ,",
    "we directly build the standard model group and matter contents , without resorting to an intermediate unification @xcite .",
    "one of the obstacle in this approach has been limited understanding on the geometric realization of the sm group , being not a simple group @xcite .",
    "nevertheless the physical structure of unification shall hint us , since the geometric structure reflects that of algebra @xcite .",
    "studies of gut have revealed that , although the sm group is a combination of some small groups , it is far from arbitrary ; the structure of the matter contents such as charge assignment , quantization and anomaly freedom , indicates that the unification structure is quite compelling .",
    "the series of exceptional lie groups of @xmath4-type serves as a promising route to gut , harboring the standard model with the gauge group @xcite @xmath11 well - known gut completions include @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "in addition , we learned that a gauge or higgs bundle background in the internal space ( roughly a gauge field or an adjoint scalar , developing ` non - constant ' vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) ) breaks a unification group as well as makes four dimensional spectrum chiral , enabling gauge ",
    "matter unification . in this sense",
    ", @xmath14 or @xmath2 may have a more perfect structure to harbor all the observed fields including gauge bosons , matters and higgses into a _",
    "adjoint @xcite .",
    "besides , it is also interesting observation that the structure of neutrino flavor in f - theoretic @xmath8 gut context , we meet @xmath2 as a final group @xcite .",
    "f - theory provides natural description of the exceptional groups of @xmath4 series . under a mild assumption below , @xmath15 can be a good starting gauge group .",
    "we shall obtain a low - energy spectrum by breaking it using a background bundle in the internal space . in f - theory such background bundle is described by spectral cover @xcite . with the structure groups",
    "@xmath16 , we obtain @xmath4 group as commutant in @xmath2 @xcite . on top of this , we can also turn on an addition @xmath17 bundle which makes the @xmath17 itself unbroken because an abelian group commutes to itself @xcite .",
    "therefore , the background gauge bundle of @xmath18 yields the unbroken sm group ( [ smgroup ] ) @xcite . in figure [",

    "since the information on the symmetry breaking is contained in the spectral cover , we can find the desired matter contents as well .",
    "organization : first we briefly discuss how f - theory describes gauge theory with a toy example of @xmath8 gut model .",
    "we can qualitatively understand the gauge group and matter contents purely in terms of algebra , so section 2 contains such identification .",
    "a certain property of background higgs or gauge field is caught by the monodromy group , which enables realistic matter contents distinguishing higgs from lepton doublets .",
    "also we can survey yukawa couplings by gauge invariance .",
    "the model is concretely realized in f - theory in section 3 .",
    "first we construct the spectral cover describing the background bundle .",
    "this contains all the information , including the parameters used for constructing the sm gauge group , described in terms of singularity of elliptic fiber .",
    "also we identify and calculate homology cycles for the matter curve for the quantitative description . in section 4 ,",
    "we turn on @xmath7-flux to make the theory chiral and calculate the number of generations for the obtained matter fields .",
    "we also briefly comment on the requirements on the internal manifold and consequent phenomenologies .",
    "we conclude with an outlook about low - energy phenomenology .",
    "type iib string theory can be viewed as f - theory compactified on torus , whose complex structure is identified by axion - dilaton field @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is ramond - ramond scalar and @xmath21 is dilaton @xcite .",
    "the torus is described by the ellptic equation @xmath22 in space spanned by @xmath23 . perfecting the square and the cube ,",
    "it becomes weierstrass form @xmath24 it has one complex parameter , related to @xmath25 through klein s @xmath26-invariant @xcite @xmath27 to have @xmath28 supersymmety in four dimensions , we compactify f - theory on calabi  yau fourfold @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "because of the above requirement , @xmath10 is elliptic fibered over a three - base @xmath29 .",

    "we fix the convenient normalization of @xmath37 later , in ( [ su5discr ] ) .",
    "the singularities are classified by degrees of @xmath38 by kodaira @xcite .",
    "using intersection theory , the connectedness of a smoothened ( blown - up ) singularities is the same as that of root system in an @xmath39-@xmath40-@xmath41 algebra , thus they share the same names .",
    "however , in general , when we transport around some base point , the singularity is effectively reduced to a smaller one , modded out by a monodromy group @xcite . to retain the original @xmath39-@xmath40-@xmath41 symmetry , we need trivial monodromy , which is implemented as so - called the splitness condition that the equation ( [ ellfiber ] ) has some factorization structure .",
    "tate s algorithm includes the check on the splitness condition just by counting degrees of @xmath31 @xcite . for @xmath42 singularity",
    "we need a further information of ` complete square ' structure .",
    "moreover , this information is crucial in dealing with @xmath43 type groups , of which degrees of @xmath44 and @xmath45 are zero .",
    "we have displayed the results in table [ t : tate ] .",
    "f - theory is a remarkable realization in physics that the singularity determines the gauge group of the same name in the low energy limit @xcite . we can regard @xmath35 as a four - cycle where sevenbranes wraps , supporting the yang ",
    "mills theory of this gauge group on eight dimensional worldvolume @xcite . in the perturbative limit",
    ", the degree of @xmath37 is directly translated in the number of coincident d - branes on @xmath35 .",
    "the gauge fields in cartan subalgebra come from kaluza  klein reduction of three - form field @xmath46 in f - theory @xmath47 where @xmath48 are harmonic two - forms corresponding to the positions of sevenbranes .",
    "the ones for non - abelian directions come from m2 brane wrapping on blown - up cycles of the singularities , whose zero size limit make them massless @xcite .    in this paper , we additionally require an elliptic k3 fibration structure on @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "since elliptic k3 is an elliptic fibration over @xmath49 , the elliptic base @xmath29 is again @xmath49 fibration over @xmath35 , and the normal space @xmath49 has a faithful affine coordinate @xmath50 of the stereographic projection . with calabi  yau condition , the form of equation ( [ ellfiber ] ) is highly restricted , and the maximal group is @xmath15 localized on the opposite poles of the sphere @xcite .",
    "since they are separated  la heterotic - m picture and there is no field charged under the both @xmath2 s , we focus only on one of them .",
    "we may make use of the other @xmath2 as the origin of supersymmetry breaking .",
    "in fact this description is related to heterotic string on the dual calabi ",
    "yau threefold , with fiberwise duality between f - theory on k3 and heterotic string on torus @xcite . using the same kinds of background bundles for the gauge fields in the internal space ,",
    "we could obtain similar models . in f - theory side , however we can concretely obtain the singularity describing the sm group and matter curves localizing the matter fields .",
    ".singularities identified by the degrees of coefficients of elliptic equation ( [ ellfiber ] ) and ( [ origweieq ] ) @xcite .",

    "the spectral cover should encode such information , since the matter curves are induced from it . by using the parameters @xmath52 ,",
    "so far we have implicitly assumed @xmath53 monodromy . as seen in sec .",
    "[ sec : z4monodromy ] we need @xmath6 monodromy for the realistic spectrum so here we study how to realize its matter curve .      the spectral cover in fact describes a freedom of _ choosing _ monodromy of the background gauge bundle .",
    "we go on with @xmath6 monodromy considerd in section [ sec : z4monodromy ] .",
    "since @xmath6 singles one cover out of five , accordingly the spectral cover ( [ su5xu1cover ] ) is further factorized as @xmath54 , described by @xmath55 this is understood as a tuning among the parameters of @xmath56 @xmath57 ( we can understand the embeddability of @xmath58 for ( [ su5xu1cover ] ) in the same way . ) the traceless condition ( [ su6traceless ] ) becomes @xmath59 again we have an overall freedom to choose @xmath60 , whose transform we name @xmath61 .",
    "the transformations of parameters are summarized in table [ t : transf ] .",
    "relating @xmath62 , it is easy to see that @xmath63 are again the elementary symmetry polynomials of degree @xmath64 of @xmath65 , related by @xmath66 monodromy subgroup .",
    "the extra @xmath67 in ( [ u1bminusl ] ) is now identified by the one generated by cover @xmath68 , as to what @xmath69 is by @xmath70 .",
    "as expected , we obtain ` fundamental ' matter curves for @xmath71 and @xmath72 as @xmath73 where we omitted pullback .",

    "this factorization structure of coefficients in the spectral cover equation describes @xmath6 monodromy ( see also @xcite ) .    on @xmath35 , the homology classes for @xmath83",
    "is @xmath84 .",
    "noting that @xmath85 should be expressed in terms of @xmath86 in ( [ finaltraceless ] ) , the corresponding class is @xmath87 since @xmath88 is the remaining part of the decomposition , we implicitly had a nontrivial condition that @xmath82 has a factor @xmath86 , which gives the overall class as @xmath89 .",
    "the results are displayed in table [ t : mcurve41 ] .",
    "we need the homology class @xmath90 inside @xmath91 for each associated matter curve .",
    "since @xmath92 distinguished the homology of @xmath93 and @xmath94 , so the above setting @xmath95 makes various curves homologous .",
    "in particular it becomes @xmath96 and it follows @xmath97 where we used the disjoint relation ( [ disjoint ] ) .",
    "of course , the actual equations for @xmath93 and @xmath94 are different , as seen in table [ t : mequation ] , so the corresponding matters are localized on different curves .",
    "they are homologous . likewise @xmath98 and @xmath99",
    "are respectively distinguished by involution @xmath25 but homologous @xmath100 these relations imply @xmath8 gut unification structure where @xmath101 , as a consequence of the triviality of @xmath102 .",
    "we can perform a similar calculation for @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "since those for @xmath105 and @xmath106 are equivalent in trivial @xmath102 or @xmath107 , we continue the @xmath105 part .",
    "the matter curve for @xmath105 is inside @xmath108 .",
    "the calculation is analogous to the case of @xmath109 curves , @xmath110 thus we have @xmath111 the matter curves for @xmath112 and @xmath88 are obtained by decomposing @xmath113 referring to the homology class displayed in table [ t : mcurve41 ] .",
    "the corresponding classes are @xmath114 and @xmath115 which is also equivalent to the cycles for @xmath116 and @xmath117 .",
    "we distinguish the physical lepton doublets from higgs doublets .",
    "to agree with the previous matter curves before @xmath6 modding , the total sum of homology class in the unified multiplet should be the same .",
    "we have @xmath118 where the last terms in the last two lines will vanish later in @xmath119 limit .",
    "as before , we can not distinguish @xmath120 from @xmath121 , so we count only one of them .",
    "this provides another understanding on @xmath8 unification structure of the matter fields .",
    "so far , we have identified matter contents localized along curves in the internal manifold . in total space including our four dimensions , each curve spans six dimensional worldvolume , thus its spectrum is yet non - chiral in four dimension . in order to obtain chiral spectrum",

    "although physically different , the spectral cover describing the vector bundle background looks like another stack of seven - branes , whose positions from some origin are nothing but the eigenvalues @xmath127 , that is , along the fiber @xmath41 the background vector bundle is decomposed , @xmath128 turning on a @xmath7-flux , or spectral line bundle @xmath123 , on the spectral cover @xmath129 induces the flux on the matter curves .",
    "being on @xmath129 , it _ does not _ break the gauge symmetry living on @xmath35 .",
    "the zero modes of four dimensional chiral fermions are classified by homology , whose unified description is done by ext group @xcite . letting @xmath130",
    "respectively immersions of @xmath35 and @xmath129 into @xmath91 in ( [ threefold ] ) @xmath131 classifying the dirac eigenstates along the complex curve @xmath132 as topological defect @xcite .",
    "we can regard the above as intersecting brane picture . since f - theory employs open stringy description , where branes are natural objects for specifying the boundary conditions , they provide two distinctive way of obtaining chiral gauge theory in four dimensions .",
    "gut realizations are regarded as magnetized brane description : turning on flux @xmath133 of the field strength for the gauge group on @xmath35 .",
    "for example the @xmath9 flux achieve the breaking of the gut group and realize chiral four dimensional spectrum .",
    "it always breaks the gauge symmetry on @xmath35 , its gaugino field decomposes and gives rise to chiral fermions in four dimension , belonging to @xmath134 since we start with the standard model group from the beginning , we do not need this mechanism .",

    "let @xmath129 be a @xmath135-fold spectral cover of @xmath35 and @xmath136 be its projection @xmath137=n \\sigma + \\pi^*\\eta,\\quad p_{c } : c \\to s.\\ ] ] as alluded , for four dimensional chiral spectrum , we turn on a line bundle @xmath138 on @xmath129 @xmath139 which is related to a rank @xmath135 vector bundle @xmath140 of structure group @xmath141 ( of the higgs bundle or , of the vector bundle in the heterotic dual ) .",
    "this correspondence is known as fourier ",
    "mukai transformation @xcite .",
    "their characteristic classes are related by the grothendieck ",
    "roch index theorem @xcite .",
    "the first chern classes are related as @xmath142 the pullback @xmath143 is @xmath135-fold lifting and the pushforward @xmath144 loses such information , we have @xmath145 .",
    "if we want @xmath43 rather than @xmath141 , we may make it traceless by imposing @xmath146 .",
    "then , we have another equivalent @xmath147 for a class @xmath148 satisfying @xmath149 here @xmath150 is the one we specify , so we call also this as @xmath7-flux .    a rational number @xmath151 is introduced to make @xmath138 be in the integral class ( [ intn ] ) . the quantity in the parenthesis of ( [ traceless ] )",
    "is called the ramification divisor , reflecting the multifold nature of @xmath123 in @xmath140 .",
    "we constructed @xmath129 as a subspace of threefold @xmath91 in ( [ threefold ] ) . in this case , using the adjunction formula for @xmath152 on @xmath129 , @xmath153 the relation ( [ trlesflux ] ) becomes explicit @xmath154 as a result the integral condition ( [ intn ] ) becomes @xmath155 as we see in the next section , a large class of base manifolds admits @xmath156 as even cycles .",
    "so we just require @xmath151 to be any integer for even @xmath135 , or a half - odd - integer for odd @xmath135 .",
    "turning off the flux @xmath157 requires even @xmath135 .",
    "there is no such constraint for the @xmath17 case , since there is no ramification @xmath158 .",
    "another necessary condition is d - flatness in ( [ dflat ] ) . since the khler form @xmath126 is @xmath159 form , choosing @xmath160 satisfies the condition .",
    "one obvious choice is a cocycle @xmath150 dual to the matter curve @xmath132 @xcite . since @xmath161",
    ", we have @xmath162 this is always present , hence called the universal flux .    through ( [ ascflux ] )",
    "a line bundle @xmath138 induces flux on a matter curve @xmath163 as @xcite @xmath164 here in the second line we used @xmath165 and in the last line the adjunction formula @xmath166 . under this background , four dimensional massless chiral",
    "fermions are the zero modes of dirac operator in @xmath167 .",
    "their number difference is calculated by riemann  roch ",
    "hirzebruch index theorem @xmath168 in the second line we used ( [ spectrallinebundle ] ) and in the last line the contributions of @xmath169 cancel .",
    "using poincar dual cycle with the same notation , we can express it as @xmath170 .",
    "since associated matter curves @xmath90 , studied in section [ s : mcontents ] , are derived from the intersection of the spectral cover , the flux on the spectral cover should also induce a flux on the associated curves @xcite . from the tensor structure of matter curves ,",
    "this new flux is derived from the line bundle @xmath123 on @xmath129 . for this generalization ,",
    "let us define @xmath171 from above we have seen @xmath172 , showing the dependence on the spectral cover over which the flux is turned .",
    "it is already seen traceless .",
    "the index theorem for the associated matter curve shows the spectrum is similarly obtained @xcite , @xmath173 here the formula is essentially the same as before , where the contribution from @xmath152 was trivial .",
    "@xmath174 is the contribution from todd class , which was @xmath175 .",
    "the number of ramification points @xmath176 was counted to take the normalized matter curve .",
    "for example for @xmath103 , we have @xmath177 in the end , there are cancellation of terms except the @xmath178 dependent contribution in @xmath138 , as before .",
    "the spectrum in the class @xmath179 gives rise to rank three antisymmetric tensor representation of @xmath180 .",
    "since we want unbroken @xmath9 untouched , it suffices to consider turning on flux except @xmath70 cover corresponding to @xmath181 .",
    "the resulting matter curve is effectively antisymmetric curve @xmath182 .",
    "some comments are in order .",
    "we assumed that the matter curve comes from the same spectral cover component where the very flux @xmath138 is turned on .",
    "otherwise the flux can not affect the chirality of the matter localized on another spectral cover component .",
    "it is simply because the field is not charged under the corresponding dual structure group .",
    "also , kodaira vanishing theorem on the one dimensional curve states that @xmath183 and a similar for the antiparticle homology .",
    "thus it is nonzero only if the flux on the matter curve @xmath184 has positive degree @xcite .",
    "so it is difficult to obtain vectorlike components for the spectrum from the matter curve .",
    "for this reason we distinguish the matter curves for @xmath185 and @xmath186 .",
    "we may consider turning on spectral fluxes ( [ intn ] ) on various subsets of the covers @xmath187 which does not necessarily mean the union of all the covers .",
    "the cover @xmath70 provides a new freedom that is not present in @xmath8 gut models .",
    "we will shortly see that turning on fluxes on different part of covers leads to different unification relations among the matter contents .",
    "the simplest choice is to turn on a flux only on @xmath188 @xcite @xmath189 satisfying a stronger version of ( [ trlesflux ] ) .",
    "the matter spectrum is obtained by the above formula .",
    "for example for @xmath72 , we have @xmath190 we used the disjoint relation ( [ disjoint ] ) and the inner product is done for divisors of @xmath35 .",
    "being only on @xmath188 , the flux is induced only on the components of associated matter curve parameterized by @xmath191 .",
    "thus we easily understand the same multiplicity for @xmath93 and @xmath94 as @xmath72 @xmath192 the curve components of @xmath193 or @xmath181 are neutral , so that @xmath194 thus we do not worry about unwanted coupling involving these fields , as shown in table [ t : yukawa ] .",
    "this is to be contrasted to the case of the @xmath8 gut , broken by a nontrivial flux along the hypercharge direction , which always leaves nontrivial multiplicities for @xmath10 , arising from off - diagonal components of the @xmath8 adjoint .",
    "the expression ( [ pmulti ] ) provides a similar way to obtaining the spectrum for an associated spectral cover , where there is matter curve component not on @xmath35 .",
    "for example , @xmath195 here @xmath196 means just reading off the coefficient of @xmath163 .",
    "the matter curves for @xmath197 and @xmath198 differ by @xmath199 , hence the same multiplicity @xmath200 the other nontrivial spectrum is similarly obtained @xmath201 in the first line , we dropped the complex conjugate and instead we use the conjugate cycle having extra minus factor .",
    "we could access the matter curves and multiplicities of the neutrinos beloinging to @xmath202 of @xmath203 .",
    "however , we can not calculate the multiplicity of the @xmath203 singlet neutrinos @xmath204 , since they are the fermionic partner of gauge moduli thus lives on the bulk of @xmath188 .",
    "the anomaly cancellation condition for the color @xmath205 reads @xmath206 from which we have two choices @xmath207 this is from the four dimensional anomaly considerations .",
    "the former is required by the independent six dimensional conditions , so we will choose that , letting @xmath60 be a trivial section .",
    "we have final spectrum @xmath208 we stress once more that the product is for the divisors in @xmath35 , meaning that this is native property of @xmath35 .",
    "it is because , by choosing @xmath50 as a section of the normal bundle @xmath209 , we are assuming the base of elliptic fibration @xmath29 is again @xmath49 fiber over @xmath35 . for three generations of quarks and leptons ( and dirac neutrinos ) , we choose the base @xmath35 such that @xmath210 this condition is to be discussed in the following section .",
    "it follows that we have six pairs of higgs doublets , six pairs of colored higgses and twelve singlet neutrinos .",
    "the number of @xmath211 doublets is even , so there is no @xmath211 global anomaly .    in ( [ finmultipl ] ) ,",
    "the same numbers of generations for different multiplets can be tracked by gut relation .",
    "the spectral covers @xmath70 , @xmath68 and @xmath188 are respectively related to @xmath9 , @xmath67 and @xmath212 ` flavor ' symmetry , among which we turned on the universal flux ( [ su4flux ] ) only on @xmath188 . because the commutant of @xmath212 in @xmath2 is @xmath203 , we could expect that the matter multiplicities obey the gut relation .",
    "however the matter fields and higgs doublets are not related ; they are minimally related by @xmath13 .",
    "since there is no flux along @xmath9 , or @xmath213 , there is no anomaly and green  schwarz mechanism does not make the corresponding gauge boson massive . also @xmath214 means that there is no fayet ",
    "illipoulos term . nevertheless , turning on @xmath9 flux",
    "would be interesting .",
    "since then the flux does not obey the unification relation of @xmath8 gut , we may take care of doublet - triplet splitting problem .",
    "another nontrivial direction is to turn on non - universal flux @xcite .",
    "the traceless condition ( [ tracelessproj ] ) also allows the flux of the type @xmath215 or @xmath216 for a two - cycle @xmath217 .",
    "the condition for three generations is eq .",
    "( [ 3gencond ] ) .",
    "recall that @xmath218 depend on the surface @xmath35 , and @xmath219 hence @xmath220 depends on @xmath35 through the three base @xmath29 , which we specified below ( [ cartans ] ) .",
    "the good candidates are hirzebruch surfaces @xmath221 and their blowing - ups .",
    "we take del pezzo surfaces @xmath222 , defined by blowing @xmath135 points of @xmath223 it is generated by one hyperplane divisor @xmath224 and @xmath225 exceptional divisors @xmath226 satisfying the relation @xmath227 consider again the integral condition . on @xmath188 , @xmath228",
    "we obtain @xmath229 it requires @xmath230 is an integer and the divisor class for the other terms should belong to integer cohomology of @xmath35 .",
    "taking @xmath231 we can achieve three generations @xcite .",
    "the ampleness of @xmath232 that @xmath233 for any @xmath234 , is easily checked , thus the cycle @xmath35 is contractable and the decoupling limit exists @xcite .",
    "one thing to note is , since the canonical class is @xmath235 the even class condition for @xmath156 is always satisfied if @xmath135 is even .",
    "thus the minimal surface realizing the three generations is @xmath236 . for the explicit construction of global geometry",
    ", we refer to refs .",
    "@xcite    the nonabelian gauge degree of freedom is described by m2 branes wrapping 2-cycles @xmath237 .",
    "we can expand four form field strength as @xmath238 where @xmath48 are ( 1,1)-harmonic basis , dual to @xmath237 . thus the @xmath7-flux has components @xmath239 along cartan subalgebra of @xmath2 .",
    "this is @xmath150 .",
    "and we have @xmath240 tadpole cancellation is related to euler number @xmath241 of calabi  yau fourfold @xmath10 @xmath242 implying that we need @xmath243 three - branes to cancel anomaly .",
    "since nonabelian gauge symmetry enhancement takes place in the singular limit , we have additional contributions to euler number .",
    "we can calculate it using generalized plcker formula @xcite .",
    "the other @xmath2 is located at the section at the infinity @xmath244 , which is totally disconnected to the subgroups @xmath2 at @xmath245 .",
    "it can be partly broken , so that , for instance a small nonabelian gauge group gives rise to gaugino condensation by nonabelian group , contributing gravity mediation of supersymmetry breaking .",
    "it will lower the number of three - branes .",
    "we conclude with an outlook about the low - energy theory . we have obtained an f - theory derived model that is close to the minimal supersymmetric standard model .",
    "its gauge group @xmath0 is the commutant to the structure group @xmath18 in @xmath2 .",
    "the unification structure along @xmath4 series groups suggests that this group is unique .",
    "we can understand the corresponding singularity as a deformation of the @xmath8 singularity @xmath246 . upon breaking , the supporting surfaces for @xmath205 and @xmath211",
    "are back - reacted from the original position of that for @xmath8 , and the center - of - mass of brane stacks is responsible for the @xmath9 , as in the perturbative description .",
    "we calculated the matter spectrum and its localizing curves using spectral covers .",
    "the intersections between spectral covers and branes for the gauge theory localize fields .",
    "they are identified by relating their positions with the field quantum numbers under the structure group .",
    "the conditions from six dimensional green  schwarz mechanism agrees with the consistent unification relation .    to distinguish electroweak higgs bosons from lepton doublets , we need factorization of the spectral cover . a simple @xmath6 factorization is enough for it , and also forbids lepton and/or baryon number violating interactions up to an interacting scale . with a flux only on this ` @xmath6'-cover , we can obtain three generations of quarks and leptons , with six pairs of electroweak higgses and six pairs of colored higgses .",
    "this flux is along the direction not violating @xmath203 gut .",
    "so , although we have constructed just the standard model group , the gauge group and the matter contents obey the unification relation of @xmath8 and @xmath203 .",
    "we have the standard doublet - triplet splitting problem , also tightly related to the @xmath247-problem .",
    "we can further elaborate the model , employing a different factorization and/or fluxes . nevertheless , already this model has desirable symmetries to shed light on a dynamical resolution . because of the @xmath248 invariance , @xmath247-terms or colored higgs mass terms of the f - theory scale , close to the planck scale ,",
    "are forbidden .",
    "we expect some ` standard solution ' would break this symmetry and dynamically generate the mass matrix @xmath249 and @xmath250 at some intermediate scale .",
    "collecting the nonvanishing yukawa couplings we have the superpotential close to that of mssm , @xmath251 where @xmath92 s are matrix - valued yukawa couplings .",
    "the higgs sector have flavor structure , so a phenomenological study in this sector , leaving only one pair of light higgs doublets , would be interesting . here",
    "the proton decay problem is milder than those in @xmath8 since we have no mixing of triplet higgses with quarks .",
    "the continuous version of matter parity @xmath67 is well - known ` @xmath252 ' , the commutant to @xmath8 in @xmath203 .",
    "the conventional expectation is it would be broken down to @xmath253 symmetry , becoming the _ matter parity .",
    "_ our minimal model does not have such a field , except the right - handed sneutrinos @xmath254 belonging to @xmath255 of @xmath203 doing a similar job .",
    "their vevs @xmath256 break @xmath67 down to a discrete symmetry @xmath257 .",
    "there is an analysis along the context of heterotic compactifications with similar spectrum , where the renormalization group running generates desired potentials @xcite .",
    "the gauge couplings , contrary to gut constructions , receive no contribution from @xmath7-flux since we do not have flux component along any visible abelian gauge group , e.g. @xmath9 .",
    "so the coupling unification is natural at the f - theory scale from the geometric embedding structure to @xmath8 .",
