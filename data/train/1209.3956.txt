    "inspired by numerous prototypes in nature , photonic structures have become a captivating research subject of great demand and luminous future perspective . due to excellent theoretical as well as experimental results in the last decades ,",
    "this field already educed many basic modules for the future technology as to telecommunication and information industry , all - optical computing as well as displaying devices .",
    "the groundbreaking fundamental insight is the existence of structure - specific band structures @xcite , for instance providing complete band gaps that allow for particular bloch modes to explicitly be reflected . in analogy",
    "to charge carrier propagation processes in condensed matter , many new effects of light propagation in refractive - index modulated photonic structures besides bragg diffraction @xcite were discovered , e.g. bloch oscillation , zener tunneling , and anderson localization in the linear @xcite , as well as spatial discrete bright , dark , and vortex solitons in the nonlinear regime @xcite .",
    "up to now , relatively simple systems were investigated , however the scientific interest aspires at the investigation of more complex systems such as quasiperiodic @xcite , curvilinear including bessel and mathieu lattices @xcite where already solitary structures have been found , as well as randomized photonic structures @xcite .",
    "one of the most interesting field of highly promising systems regarding spectacular propagation effects are multiperiodic photonic structures , as especially in these systems intriguing analogies of quantum mechanics such as klein tunneling or zitterbewegung could be predicted theoretically as well as demonstrated experimentally @xcite , not disregarding distinct solitary solutions @xcite .",
    "in addition to direct - laserwritten @xcite or holographic - lithographically @xcite generated photonic structures , photorefractive materials represent a highly appropriate system to carry out linear as well as nonlinear light propagation experiments @xcite .",
    "the main advantage here is the reconfigurable and dynamically manipulable induction of complex two - dimensional refractive index modulations and thus , the optical induction of periodic , quasiperiodic and curvilinear two - dimensional @xcite as well as three - dimensional photonic structures could be presented @xcite .",
    "additionally , probing of the generated structures is feasible in one and the same setup and no further treatment of the sample is needed .",
    "the implementation of all the mentioned photonic structures were limited to one individual structure - inducing wave field , that is generated by interferometry , diffraction on artificial holograms , or via wave field moulding per spatial light modulators . as it is advantageous to implement wide - elongated photonic structures offering a longer interplay length which offers an analogue of long distance propatation to temporal behavior , one",
    "is constricted to use writing wave fields that are translation invariant in the direction of propagation , represented by the class of nondiffracting beams @xcite .",
    "though , designing wave fields of multiple transverse periodic lengths by coherently summing up various nondiffracting wave fields each showing different structural sizes , the translation invariance of the intensity distribution of each wave is no longer conserved due to occuring longitudinal interference modulations . anyhow , to implement multiperiodic structures by optical induction using nondiffracting beams , one has to care for an incoherent superposition of several writing beams of various structural sizes , for instance by holographic multiplexing techniques that are well known from the field of holographic data storage @xcite .",
    "the technique of incremental multiplexing to modulate the refractive index of a photosensitive medium was presented earlier @xcite where the former publication already presented the multiplexing method using 2d square lattices with different lattice periods as a proof of principle , and the latter demonstrates the generation of a one - dimensional ( 1d ) photonic ratchet structure .    in this contribution",
    ", we propose an approach for the optical induction of two - dimensional multiperiodic photonic structures by incremental multiplexing techniques .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows .",
    "after this first introductory section , section [ sec : mpstruct ] discusses theoretically the specification to create three representative multiperiodic structures .",
    "we respond to the proper incoherent combination of fundamental periodic lattices of different structural size to expand the desired superlattices .",
    "recapitulatory , the mathematical considerations of each structure are summarized graphically .",
    "the experimental implementation of the developed series expansion is subject of section [ sec : expimplmnt ] , where the experimental setup is presented and details of the optical incremental multiplexing method are specified . in section",
    "[ sec : analysis ] the analysis of the generated photonic superstructures and the results are detailed .",
    "this section addresses the derivations of the 2d superlattices in terms of fourier series expansions , which can be later applied for the experimental part of optical induction .",
    "therefore , we design the multiperiodic refractive index distribution by a stepwise and incremental induction of single index expansion terms using periodic nondiffracting beams ( ndbs ) with varying periodicity as the fundamentals .",
    "the usage of ndbs is essential , and thus we exclusively concentrate on this class of light waves as lattice - inducing wave fields and on their transverse intensity distributions in particular . although there is a wide spectrum of different intensity modulations among the four families of nondiffracting beams , we solely operate during the induction process with periodic discrete ndbs @xcite to preserve the periodic character of our photonic structures of inquiry .",
    "an intuitive approach to generate 2d structures with multiperiodic character is to use an optical fourier series expansions via 1d basis lattices in different orientations and varying periodic length . in this context , a 2d multiperiodic structure @xmath0 is designed by combining 1d lattice structures of equal modulation frequency resulting in a set of 2d fundaments of varying periodicity , which accounts for a series expansion of the desired structure .",
    "this procedure will for all of our examples end up in different sets of ten 2d basis lattice beams , where the series expansion is symbolically written as @xmath1 here , @xmath2 is the weighting coefficient of the @xmath3th order term and @xmath4 describes a 2d basis intensity .",
    "further , the vector @xmath5 characterizes a point in 2d space and @xmath6 with @xmath7 ( or depending on the rotational symmetry of the structure @xmath8 , respectively ) represents a modulation vector in the corresponding 2d fourier space . in general , all following field distributions and their intensities are specified as 2d functions exclusively in a transverse plane .",
    "the thereto orthogonal direction @xmath9 can be identified with the direction of propagation . the field evolution in this direction as well as",
    "the temporal development are consequently neglected in the following considerations , as these behaviors can be examined by a multiplication of the field distribution of interest with the term @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the coordinate of the 3d wave vector @xmath12 in the direction of propagation and @xmath13 describes the modulation in transverse direction .    in the following ,",
    "we introduce three representative multiperiodic structures with inherently different properties .",
    "thereby , we concentrate on considerations of intensity distributions since with our technique exclusively the intensity is relevant for refractive index changes caused by the photorefractive effect . to achieve particular intensity distributions ,",
    "we design corresponding light wave distributions showing nondiffracting properties as they can be very flexibly implemented experimentally @xcite .",
    "since the presented structures are only representative examples , various combinations of rotational symmetry ( even quasiperiodic ) and expansion rules for arbitrary periodic functions are implementable and , moreover , combinations of different expansion rules for unequal transverse directions are possible . in principle , all 2d intensity distributions are implementable that can be resembled in a series expansion of harmonic functions .",
    "nonetheless , an additional constant offset contribution can occur that might limit the resulting contrast of the structure in some cases .",
    "the first structure we consider is a 2d staircase refractive index superlattice .",
    "this unique structure offers steep slopes and flat plateaus , involving high spatial frequencies of nonnegligible significance .",
    "for that reason , a successful implementation of such a challenging structure proofs the high functionality and flexibility of the presented technique .",
    "figure [ fig : fourier_staircase](a ) represents graphically the desired 2d fourier series expansion . in the illustrations of the relevant fourier components sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : fourier_staircase](b ) , equally colored spots of a certain brightness represent the sine or cosine functions of one of the orientations .",
    "the first expansion orders are represented in gray boxes . especially in these schematics ,",
    "the multiperiodic character becomes obvious due to the higher order harmonics .",
    "combinations of all contributions of one order @xmath3 lead to the derived series expansions with 2d basis sets consisting of nondiffracting beam intensities .    to derive the correct intensity distribution of each set of 2d fundamentals , we first analyze the expansion rule for a 2d rectangular function @xmath14 with respect to 1d fundamentals . to keep the intensity non - negative",
    ", we adjoin an offset term : @xmath15,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 determines the order of the expansion term .",
    "thus , for every expansion term @xmath3 two @xmath16-modulations with orthogonal modulation vectors @xmath17 and @xmath18 contribute to the total 2d distribution @xmath14 .",
    "the length of the modulation vectors are given by the arbitrarily chosen lattice period of the first order @xmath19 and the order @xmath3 , hence : @xmath20 in the next step we will combine the 1d intensity contributions of a particular value of @xmath3 .",
    "these terms reveal modulation vectors @xmath6 which are transverse components of wave vectors with mutual equal projection length parallel to the direction of propagation and thus restrain any modulation of intensity in this direction which is characteristic for ndbs .",
    "the sum of the two sinusoidal intensity contributions for a fixed @xmath3 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : rectangular1d ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath21&\\\\   = & \\frac{1}{2}\\left[4 + { e^{i(2\\phi_1 - \\pi/2 ) } } + { e^{-i(2\\phi_1 - \\pi/2 ) } } + { e^{i(2\\phi_2 - \\pi/2 ) } } + { e^{-i(2\\phi_2 - \\pi/2)}}\\right]\\\\ = & \\frac{1}{2}\\left|{e^{i(\\phi_1 - \\pi/4 ) } } + { e^{-i(\\phi_1 - \\pi/4 ) } } + i{e^{i(\\phi_2   - \\pi/4 ) } } + i{e^{-i(\\phi_2   - \\pi/4)}}\\right|^2 , \\end{split}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we introduced the phase function @xmath22 for a particular @xmath3 with @xmath23 using @xmath24 and dropping the index @xmath3 .",
    "now it becomes obvious that the wave field whose absolute square value appears in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sinterms ] ) equals the intensity of a field distribution consisting of four interfering plane waves .",
    "this field belongs to the four - fold discrete ndbs , whose transverse intensity distribution is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : fourier_staircase](c ) and which is referred as @xmath25 in ref . @xcite . in the case here",
    ", every plane wave carries an additional phase shift of @xmath26 , where plane waves of opposite spatial frequency have opposite sign , resulting in a real space translation of the structure in transverse direction ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "hence , we can transcribe eq .",
    "( [ eq : rectangular1d ] ) to @xmath27 and receive a series expansion of a multiperiodic 2d staircase structure incorporating transverse intensities of a nondiffracting wave field as the fundamental structures .      in this subsection",
    "we derive an expression for the set of basis lattices creating a hexagonal multiperiodic structure . due to their hexagonal property",
    "such systems are of particular importance and coveted subject of many investigations for instance in graphene physics @xcite .",
    "basically , a more general interest in hexagonal structures arises from its non - separable character which implies the impossibility to generate a hexagonal lattice by a sum of two orthogonal one - dimensional lattices .    in analogy to the considerations of subsection [ ssec:2drectstruct ] , we start with the sum of 1d cosine lattices , resembling the hexagonal superstructure illustrated in fig .

    "( [ eq : hex_squarefield2 ] ) are summations of the formerly introduced phase functions @xmath22 .",
    "thus , the rule for the development of a multiperiodic 2d wire mesh function in hexagonal symmetry reads as @xmath34 and is equivalent to eq .",
    "( [ eq : hexagonal1d_basis ] ) .    in this connection ,",
    "the fineness of the structure and thus the diameter of each spike is adaptable by broadening the spatial frequency bandwidth of the structure , which can be achieved by increasing the number of expansion orders .    besides the weighting of the fundamental structures , also the choice of the rotational symmetry brings out a parameter to vary the resulting multiperiodic structure .",
    "thus the six - fold periodic structure presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : fourier_wiremesh](c ) is the basement for the hexagonal multiperiodic wire mesh structure presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : fourier_wiremesh](a ) which conserves the rotational symmetry .      in general , functional structures such as 2d ratchets",

    ", we are going to develop the rule for the optical induction of a 2d ratchet structure .",
    "therefore , we again start with a fourier series expansion under the usage of a basis set of 1d fundamental lattices : @xmath35.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]        figure [ fig : fourier_ratchet](a ) depicts the multiperiodic lattice in terms of the effective intensity distribution .",

    "( [ eq : sinterms ] ) , every expansion term of @xmath38 can be expressed through the earlier introduced wave field @xmath39 , which again is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : fourier_ratchet](c ) .",
    "hence , the series expansion for a multiperiodic 2d ratchet intensity distribution @xmath38 composed of a 2d set of fundamental nondiffracting beam intensities is @xmath40 where exclusively the weighting factor @xmath41 as well as the relation between the modulation vectors of every order @xmath3 determines the difference between eq .",

    "we employ a nonlinear cerium - doped strontium barium niobate ( sbn ) crystal that , externally biased , translates the intensity modulations into refractive index changes via the photorefractive effect . for the whole set of induction patterns , the external voltage is about over a distance of @xmath49 where the induction beam propagates along a @xmath49 orientation of the crystal .",
    "the polarization of each writing wave field is chosen to be perpendicular to the symmetry axis of the crystal ( @xmath50 axis ) in order to minimize the influence of the induced refractive index change on the writing light due to a small electro - optical coefficient @xcite .",
    "thus the refractive index of the medium can be assumed to be approximately homogeneous for this specific perpendicular state of polarization .    as a generalized approach ,",
    "the temporal development of the refractive index change in a biased sbn crystal caused by an illumination pattern behaves exponentially @xcite , fades to saturation with the time constant @xmath51 , and also gets exponentially erased ( @xmath52 ) due to illumination with non - identical intensity distributions .",

    "in general , a written refractive index modulation is persistent in the sbn crystal until further illuminations .    in all multiperiodic expansions introduced in the previous section ,",
    "the intensity belonging to a particular expansion order @xmath3 is weighted by a factor depending on @xmath3 .",
    "this weighting factor is realized in the experiment by adapting the illumination time @xmath46 for each lattice - inducing beam .",
    "thereby , rather than controlling the external voltage or intensity of each fundamental structure , we regulate @xmath46 to weight a specific induction term .",

    "<S> we introduce a universal method to optically induce multiperiodic photonic complex superstructures bearing two - dimensional ( 2d ) refractive index modulations over several centimeters of elongation . </S>",
    "<S> these superstructures result from the accomplished superposition of 2d fundamental periodic structures . to find the specific sets of fundamentals , we combine particular spatial frequencies of the respective fourier series expansions , which enables us to use nondiffracting beams in the experiment showing periodic 2d intensity modulation in order to successively develop the desired multiperiodic structures . </S>",
    "<S> we present the generation of 2d photonic staircase , hexagonal wire mesh and ratchet structures , whose succeeded generation is confirmed by phase resolving methods using digital - holographic techniques to detect the induced refractive index pattern . </S>"
