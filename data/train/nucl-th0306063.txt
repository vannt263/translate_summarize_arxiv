    "the study of pion propagation in dense nuclear matter is of central importance when addressing the in - medium modifications of nucleon and delta resonances @xcite .",
    "there are strong hints from the empirical photon nucleus absorption cross section as well as from pion - nucleus scattering data that the low - lying nucleon and delta resonances do change their properties in nuclear matter substantially already at nuclear saturation density @xcite .",
    "recent data on electroproduction of isobars off helium three @xcite are interpreted in terms of a repulsive in - medium mass change and an increased decay width of the isobar - resonance @xcite . since most nucleon and isobar resonances have a substantial decay fraction into one nucleon and one pion , the in - medium resonance structure",
    "reflects to a large extent the medium modified propagation properties of pions .",
    "the pion self energy in nuclear matter is quantitatively constrained by pionic atom data @xcite .",
    "most exciting are the recently established states where a negatively charged pion is bound by a heavy nucleus in an s - wave or p - wave state @xcite .",
    "it is still an open problem to find a quantitative and microscopic derivation in particular for the large absorptive part in the nuclear optical potential needed in the phenomenological description of pionic atom data @xcite .",
    "the problem requires a non - perturbative many - body approach , since the low - density expansion ceases to converge rapidly at the relevant nuclear densities even when chiral correction terms are considered @xcite .    in this work",
    "we generalize the covariant framework of @xcite , which was recently proposed for the self consistent propagation of antikaons and hyperon - resonances in nuclear matter , to the problem of pion , nucleon- and isobar - resonance propagation incorporating short range correlation effects .",
    "the merit of our scheme is that it is formulated entirely in terms of the two - body scattering phase - shifts properly extrapolated to subthreshold energies . given the empirical @xmath5 phase shifts and values for the migdal parameters @xcite describing important short range correlations the scheme is parameter free .",
    "we expect self consistency to lead to a broadening of the pion spectral function which may help to establish a microscopic understanding of pionic atom data and also offer an improved understanding of the expected broadening of nucleon and isobar resonances in nuclear matter .",
    "our present approach constitutes a significant progress as compared to previous self consistent calculations @xcite which were based on p - wave pion - nucleon dynamics only .",
    "moreover this work is the first attempt to consider the effects of the in - medium mixing of partial wave amplitudes .",
    "in particular the feedback effect of the in - medium modified s - wave @xmath1 and @xmath3 , the p - wave @xmath0 and the d - wave @xmath2 resonances to the propagation properties of pions will be addressed in this work .",
    "similarly the isobar resonances s - wave @xmath6 , p - wave @xmath7 and @xmath8 and the d - wave @xmath9 resonances are considered .",
    "we briefly recall the self consistent and covariant many - body framework introduced in @xcite appropriately adjusted to pion propagation in nuclear matter .",
    "first we recall the vacuum on - shell pion - nucleon scattering amplitude @xmath10 where @xmath11 guarantees energy - momentum conservation and @xmath12 is the nucleon isospin - doublet spinor .",
    "the vacuum scattering amplitude is decomposed into its isospin channels . applying standard notation for the paul matrices @xmath13 we write @xmath14 where @xmath15 are the initial and final pion and nucleon 4-momenta and @xmath16 in quantum field theory the scattering amplitudes follow as the solution of the bethe - salpeter matrix equation @xmath17 in terms of the bethe - salpeter kernel @xmath18 , the free space nucleon propagator @xmath19 and pion propagator @xmath20 . following @xcite we neglect self energy corrections in the nucleon and pion propagators . in a chiral scheme",
    "such effects are of subleading order . the bethe - salpeter equation ( [ bs - eq ] ) properly implements lorentz invariance and unitarity for the two - body scattering process .",
    "the generalization of ( [ bs - eq ] ) to a coupled - channel system is straightforward .",
    "the pion - nucleon scattering process is readily generalized from the vacuum to the nuclear matter case . in compact notation",
    "we write @xmath21 where the in - medium scattering amplitude @xmath22 and the two - particle propagator @xmath23 depend now on the 4-velocity @xmath24 characterizing the nuclear matter frame . for nuclear matter moving with a velocity @xmath25 one",
    "has @xmath26 we emphasize that ( [ hatt ] ) is properly defined from a feynman diagrammatic point of view even in the case where the in - medium scattering process is no longer well defined due to a broad pion spectral function .",

    "this is beyond the scope of this work .",

    "it is crucial to consider the latter term since it will introduce in particular the important short range correlation effects described by the migdal parameters .",
    "this will be discussed in more detail below .    with ( [ rewrite ] )",
    "the self consistent set of equations ( [ hatt],[hatg],[k - self ] ) is rewritten in a way that one may start with a set of tabulated free - space scattering amplitudes @xmath42 in terms of which self consistency is achieved .",
    "coupled channel effects , which are known to be important for @xmath5 scattering at higher energies , are included by assigning @xmath43 , @xmath27 and @xmath38 the appropriate matrix structures .",
    "the effect of all inelastic channels can be accounted for by a renormalization leading to a complex scattering kernel @xmath38 of the @xmath5 channel .",
    "therefore we may assume that the amplitudes @xmath42 in ( [ rewrite ] ) already include the dynamics of all inelastic coupled channels .",
    "in this work we study the consequence of the in - medium modified @xmath5 channel exclusively .",
    "thus it is not necessary to make the coupled channel structure of the @xmath5 amplitudes explicit @xcite .",
    "ultimately it would be desirable to also evaluate the in - medium modification of the inelastic processes described for instance by the @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 channels .",
    "the scattering amplitudes can be systematically decomposed into covariant projectors @xmath47 with good angular momentum and parity @xmath48 .",
    "we write @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 and @xmath52 . the representation ( [ t - vacuum ] )",
    "implies a particular off - shell behavior of the scattering amplitude , which was obtained in the course of constructing a systematic on - shell reduction of the covariant bethe - salpeter equation that does not depend on the choice of meson and baryon interpolation fields @xcite . in this work we focus on the leading @xmath53 and @xmath54 channels with @xmath55 ( s - wave ) , @xmath56 ( p - wave ) and @xmath57 ( p - wave ) , @xmath58 ( d - wave ) . for details on the construction and the properties of these projectors",
    "we refer to @xcite .    for energies above threshold",

    "@xmath66 an analytic continuation is required as for instance implied by the dispersion - integral representation , @xmath67 where the functions @xmath68 represent all left - hand cut contributions @xcite . since the cut structure in @xmath69 is largely dominated by the s- and u - channel nucleon - exchange contributions , it is straightforward to analytically continue the _ on - shell _ amplitudes into the region @xmath70 as to arrive at approximate partial - wave amplitudes specified for all energies . as a consequence",
    "the amplitudes would receive large and strongly energy - dependent contributions in the interval @xmath71 .",
    "we point out , however , that the formulation as presented above would lead to unphysical and misleading results for the pion self energy unless the dependence of the partial - wave amplitudes on @xmath72 at subthreshold energies is taken into account in some way .",
    "this is important , since the u - channel contribution to the partial wave amplitudes shows an extremely strong dependence on @xmath73 .",
    "typically for given @xmath74 with @xmath70 and @xmath75 the contribution is small and negligible but at the on - shell point @xmath76 it is large .",
    "since the subthreshold amplitudes are probed by the pion self energy only for @xmath77 , it is clear that the @xmath73-dependence must be considered . rather than extending our scheme for the most general off - shell structure in the scattering amplitude",
    "we propose a simple modification of the scheme that successfully circumvents the artifacts of a pure on - shell scheme .",
    "it would be unclear in any case what to use for the off - shell dependence , since such a dependence is highly scheme - dependent .",
    "the idea the proposed scheme is based on , exploits crossing symmetry as a tool that determines the troublesome off - shell part of the scattering amplitude .",
    "we seek a representation of the free - space scattering amplitude of the form @xmath78 that manifests the desired crossing symmetry of the amplitudes explicitly but masks the constraints set by unitarity .",
    "the decomposition ( [ def - decom ] ) is not unique per se but can be tailored to our application . in particular",
    "we insist that @xmath79 contains only s - channel unitarity cuts but shows no cuts in the u - channel .",
    "similarly we insist that @xmath80 is real for @xmath81 .",
    "in general there will be contributions present in @xmath82 which lead to both an s - channel and u - channel cut .",
    "such contributions must be put into a remainder term not displayed in ( [ def - decom ] ) , if we wish to keep perfect analytic properties of the amplitudes @xmath83 and @xmath80 .",
    "we point out however , that such contributions are zero identically , if one considered elastic scattering processes only . therefore we expect the degree of analyticity violation , when demanding @xmath79 to represent the complete strength of the s - channel unitarity cut , to be reasonably small if energies are not excessively large . within a given application window",
    "there is still the freedom how to distribute a polynomial background contribution .",
    "here it is advantageous to insist on @xmath84 beyond a certain scale @xmath85 .",
    "consistency then requires that for @xmath86 one should obtain @xmath87 or equivalently @xmath88 .",
    "the scattering amplitude @xmath79 is decomposed into partial wave amplitudes @xmath89 . in practise",
    "we use the representation ( [ an - con ] ) with the function @xmath68 replaced by a second order polynomial in @xmath74 .",
    "the coefficients of the latter are determined to guarantee first , that the real parts of @xmath90 vanish identically at @xmath91 and second , is such that a smooth matching to the real part of the partial wave amplitudes , @xmath92 , at @xmath93 as given in ( [ match ] ) is obtained .",
    "of course in the @xmath94 channel the nucleon pole contribution is incorporated in addition .",
    "the pion - nucleon coupling constant , @xmath95 , of @xcite is used . with @xmath96",
    "mev a remarkably smooth matching is achieved for all considered channels as described above .",
    "the deviation of @xmath97 from @xmath98 , both shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] , is a measure for the importance of u - channel cuts in a given partial wave .",
    "the idea is to use the amplitudes @xmath79 in ( [ def - decom ] ) properly decomposed into partial waves via ( [ t - vacuum ] ) .",
    "the effect of @xmath80 is incorporated into the pion self energy by adding to ( [ k - self ] ) the term induced by @xmath79 but with @xmath99 replaced . as we apply the decomposition ( [ def - decom ] ) for a many - body evaluation of the pion self energy ,",
    "the parameter @xmath100 plays the role of a scale that determines at what energy the manifestly crossing - symmetric scheme recovers two - body unitarity exactly . for energies close to the pion - nucleon threshold",
    "a unitarization is not really required for a quantitative description of the scattering amplitude .",
    "the amplitudes are largely dominated by the s- and u - channel baryon exchange contributions .",

    "such a condition is well justified in the present scheme since neither correlations nor binding effects are incorporated .",
    "that is outside the scope of this work .",
    "furthermore we drop a small contribution of intermediate hole states , not consistently treated here in any case , but part of the relativistic scattering equation ( [ hatt ] ) .",
    "this leads to an in - medium scattering amplitude , whose imaginary part , @xmath110 vanishes below the chemical potential as expected from the pauli principle . to be precise",
    "the property ( [ t - pauli ] ) requires also the consideration of the pauli blocking effect in the s - channel nucleon exchange contribution , i.e. @xmath111 .",

    "the results differ from conclusions of previous works @xcite that also incorporated self consistency but did not observe such a significant broadening of the isobar .",
    "this difference is a direct consequence of the soft form factor in the pion - isobar vertex used in @xcite . in our scheme",

    "however , a certain form of pion - nucleon - nucleon and pion - nucleon - isobar form factors commonly used in calculations of pion , nucleon and isobar self energies based on the relevant 3-point functions can also be introduced in the present scheme .",
    "the condition is that the solution of the bethe - salpeter equation in vacuum is not affected for the on - shell scattering amplitudes .",
    "indeed , the use of scattering phase shifts incorporates the form factors necessary to describe the pion - nucleon interaction , but only for on - shell particles .",

    "it should be emphasized , however , that the phenomenological need for such a form factor may stem from medium modifications of the interaction vertices rather than a strong off - shell dependence of the vertices in free - space .",
    "we do not modify the loop - integral calculation , since for consistency that would require considering also the influence of the migdal parameters on the pion - nucleon - nucleon and pion - nucleon - isobar vertices in those loop integrals .",

    "[ pion - self ] we show the pion self energy at nuclear saturation density , for momenta @xmath209gev and @xmath210gev .",
    "the most prominent feature of the self energy is the strong suppression of the delta - hole contribution for momenta around 0.2 gev , as well as the contributions of higher - mass resonances which leave the imaginary part non - vanishing even at energies up to 1 gev .",
    "these results show that further investigations of the effects of vertex modifications in the medium are required , which respect the features intrinsic to our present scheme .",

    "a novel framework based on the @xmath5 phase shifts , as measured in free space , together with a set of migdal parameters was developed .",
    "important constraints of crossing symmetry and unitarity were incorporated approximatively . using reasonable values for the migdal parameters we found that the nucleon resonances @xmath2 and @xmath3 are basically unaffected by the nuclear environment .",
    "contrasted results were obtained for the p - wave @xmath0 and d - wave @xmath1 resonances for which we predict considerable broadening already at nuclear saturation density .",
    "our result for the isobar resonance are not satisfactory at this stage , due to a significant overestimate of its in - medium decay width .",
    "improved results were obtained by incorporating a soft phenomenological form factor into the @xmath4 vertex . whereas the properties of slow isobars in nuclear matter are changed significantly , a soft form factor has rather moderate effects on the pion spectral function .",
