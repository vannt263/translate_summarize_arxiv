    "this chapter reviews the progress since the _ protostars and planets iv _ meeting ( _ mccaughrean et al . _ , 2000 ) in observations and modeling of scattered - light images of disks around young stellar objects ( ysos ) . for many years",
    "these disks were studied in the infrared and at millimeter wavelengths , but without the spatial resolution necessary to reveal their detailed structure . with the advent of the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) and ground - based adaptive optics ( ao ) systems , these disks were seen in scattered optical and near - infrared starlight .",
    "the first images of disks in scattered light showed them as never before .",
    "these images currently provide the highest spatial resolution images of disks and provide unique information on disk structure and dust properties .",
    "most disks around young low- and intermediate - mass stars fall into one of two categories on the basis of their gross observational properties .",
    "yso disks are optically thick at visible and near - infrared wavelengths , are rich in molecular gas , and are found around class i and class ii systems .",
    "debris disks are optically thin at optical and near - infrared wavelengths , have only trace quantities of gas , and are found around class iii and older systems .",
    "our current understanding of the evolution of dust in disks around young low- and intermediate - mass stars is that these observational categories correspond to very distinct phases . in yso disks",
    "our understanding is that gas and dust from molecular cores is processed through the disk and provides the raw material both for accretion and outflows .",
    "the dust is processed first in the dense molecular core and then in the disk itself .",
    "the dust grows and suffers chemical processing .",
    "dust growth is hypothesized to result in the production of planetesimals , which form rocky planets and the cores of gas giant planets . in debris disks , our understanding is that dust is present largely as a result of collisions between planetesimals .",
    "thus , yso disks are thought to be characterized by dust growth whereas debris disks are thought to characterized by planetesimal destruction .    in this chapter",
    "we focus on observations and modeling of scattered - light images of yso disks around low- and intermediate - mass stars .",
    "that is , we focus on the phase in which dust is expected to grow . of course",
    ", scattered - light observations and models are not the only means to explore these disks . the chapter by _ dutrey et al .",

    "_ discusses aspects of disks that are peculiar to binaries .",
    "further from the subject of our chapter , the chapter by _ cesaroni et al .",
    "_ discusses disks around young high - mass stars and the chapter by _",
    "meyer et al . _ reviews debris disks around solar - type stars .    in the following sections we summarize the data available on scattered - light disks around ysos , imaging techniques , and what we can learn about disk structure and dust properties from modeling multi - wavelength images and seds .",
    "we also speculate about future advances .",
    "at the time of the _ protostars and planets iv _ meeting , held in 1998 , only a dozen yso disks had been resolved in scattered light and another half dozen in silhouette against the orion nebula . since then , the number of resolved disks in these two categories has doubled and quadrupled , respectively .",
    "the new discoveries stem largely from targeted high - contrast imaging of greater numbers of ysos and wide - field imaging surveys of star - forming clouds . in the optical and near - infrared",
    ", the broader application of established observing techniques , rather than any instrumental improvements , has driven the recent expansion in the number of disks discovered . at longer mid - infrared wavelengths ,",
    "larger telescopes equipped with more potent mid - infrared imagers became available .",
    "these results are described in this section and images of some of the new disks are shown in figs .  1 and 2",
    ". a complete list of published yso disks resolved in scattered light appears in table  1 .",
    "most of these are around t  tau stars , although some are around herbig aebe stars .",
    "an on - line catalog of circumstellar disks resolved in scattered light , thermal emission , or molecular lines is now available ; the url is http://www.circumstellardisks.org .",
    "_ 2.1.1 coronagraphic and direct imaging . _",
    "the most general case , and also the most observationally challenging , is the detection of disk scattered light in the presence of direct starlight .",
    "subtraction of a fiducial reference star is almost always necessary to reveal the disk , and a coronagraph is usually employed to suppress stellar diffraction .",
    "various hst instruments have produced excellent images of disks around bright stars , while groundbased ao imaging of these disks is often hampered by the instability of the point spread function .",
    "the brightness of herbig aebe stars makes them excellent disk imaging targets , and three have been found to show interesting circumstellar nebulosity .",
    "hd 100546 has a disk viewed from high latitudes which contains what appear to be two spiral arms ( _ pantin , waelkens , and lagage _ , 2000 ; _ grady et al .",

    "the nebulosity around ab aur shows a wealth of structure ( _ grady et al .",
    "_ , 1999 ; _ fukagawa et al . _ , 2004 ) , but it is unclear how much is associated with the disk and how much with a more extended envelope .",
    "_ fukagawa et al . _",
    "( 2003 ) report a possible disk around hd 150193a .",

    "( 2003 ) revealed an asymmetric spiral - like feature and showed that the cleared region was not completely empty .",
    "hd 141569a is in a multiple system .",
    "dynamical studies suggest that stellar fly - bys or a recent periastron passage by the companions could be the origin of the observed spiral feature ( _ augereau and papaloizou _ , 2004 ; _ ardila et al . _ , 2005 ; _ quillen et al . _ , 2005 ) .",
    "perhaps the most significant new disk imaged around a directly visible star since _ protostars and planets iv _ is that of tw hya ( _ krist et al .",
    "_ , 2000 ; _ trilling et al . _ , 2001 ; _ weinberger et al .",
    "_ , 2002 ) .",
    "this face - on disk is also the closest t tauri star disk , at a distance of 56 pc , and has been well - studied at millimeter wavelengths .",
    "the disk radial profile shows a sharp break in slope at a radius of 140 au which is seen in multiple independent datasets .",
    "the physical origin of this sudden fading in the outer disk is unclear .",
    "long - slit spectra of the tw hya disk with hst stis ( _ roberge et al . _ , 2005 ) find that the disk has a roughly neutral color from 5000  to 8000  ( see their fig .  5 ) ,",
    "consistent with previous broad - band imaging in the same spectral region ( _ krist et al .",
    "_ , 2000 ) and near - infrared ( _ weinberger et al . _ , 2002 ) .",
    "despite the interesting results highlighted above , most yso disks ( those whose presence is inferred from infrared and submm excess emission ) remain undetectable in scattered light .",
    "there are probably multiple reasons for this fact .",
    "disks with outer radii smaller than 0.5 , the typical inner working angle cutoff for current coronagraphs and psf subtraction techniques , would not extend far enough from their host star to be readily detected .",
    "this can not be the whole explanation , however ; the disk of mwc 480 has a large outer radius in millimeterwave co emission ( _ simon et al .",
    "_ , 2000 ) , but repeated attempts to detect it in scattered light have failed ( _ augereau et al . _ , 2001 ; _ grady et al . _ ,",
    "there are other examples .",
    "many disks may simply be intrinsically fainter than the ones that have been imaged in scattered light to date ; they may be geometrically flatter ( and thus tending toward self - shadowing ) , depleted of small particles , or have undergone chemical processing that has reduced their albedo . with the typical yso disk currently undetectable against the direct light of its parent star , improved coronagraphic instrumentation will be needed to understand the diversity in disk scattering properties and their underlying causes .",

    "the usual objective when imaging ysos in the mid - infrared is to resolve extended thermal emission from their inner disks . at the distances of the nearest star - forming clouds , extended 1020 @xmath5 m thermal emission has only been detected in a handful of luminous ae stars ( hd 100546 , ab aur , and v892 tau ; _ liu et al .",

    "the 1020 @xmath5 m emssion is spatially unresolved  even in the relatively nearby case of tw hya ( _ weinberger et al . _ , 2002 ) .",
    "the absence of extended 20 @xmath5 m emission in t tauri stars may pose a problem for models of flared disk spectral energy distributions ( _ chiang and goldreich _ , 1997 ) .",
    "these models postulate a superheated disk upper layer where stellar radiation is predominantly absorbed by small dust particles , which then radiate inefficiently at longer wavelengths .",
    "large grains or flatter disks may be needed to explain the fact that most of these sources are unresolved in the mid - infrared .",
    "one of the more significant and surprising disk imaging results of recent years has been the detection of _ scattered light _ from three yso disks in the mid - infrared . _",
    "mccabe et al . _",
    "( 2003 ) found that the edge - on disk of hk tau b appears as an extended source in sensitive 10 @xmath5 m keck images .",
    "the good alignment of this 10 @xmath5 m nebulosity with the optical scattered light ( _ stapelfeldt et al .",
    "_ , 1998 ) , its extent well beyond a reasonable diameter for disk thermal emission , and its monotonically declining flux density from 2 to 10 @xmath5 m argue that this is scattered light .",
    "it is not clear if the original source of emission is the star or the inner part of the disk .",
    "the fact that some edge - on disks might be seen entirely via scattered light in the mid - infrared was already indicated by _ infrared space observatory _ photometry of hh 30 ( _ wood et al .",
    "_ , 2002 ) ; hk tau b is the first resolved example .",
    "a second is in the case of gg tau , where _ duchne et al . _",
    "( 2004 ) clearly detect the circumbinary ring in deep 3.8 @xmath5 m images . by the same arguments as above , this",
    "must also be scattered light . a third source , pds 144 ( _ perrin et al .",
    "_ , in preparation ) , is an a star that appears as a spectacular bipolar nebula in 10 @xmath5 m images ; the relative contributions of scattered light and pah emission in this image are still being assessed . as discussed in section 5.3",
    "below , scattered light at these long wavelengths is a powerful diagnostic of large grains in circumstellar disks .",
    "additional examples of resolved mid - ir scattered light from yso disks can be expected in the future .",
    "imaging polarimetry can confirm the presence of scattered light nebulosity and offer clues to the location of embedded illuminating sources .",
    "the strength of the observed polarization depends on the dust grain properties , the scattering geometry , the degree of multiple scattering , and the polarization induced by any foreground cloud material .",
    "spatially resolved polarimetry has been reported for only a few disks .",
    "the best example is gg tau , where the geometry of the circumbinary ring is very well understood , and thus the polarimetric results can be readily interpreted . _",
    "silber et al . _ ( 2000 ) found that backscattered light from the far side of the ring was very highly polarized at 1 @xmath5 m , requiring that the scattered light originate from submicron - sized grains .",
    "a new application for polarimetry has emerged in high contrast ao .",
    "groundbased ao systems provide a diffraction - limited image core , but also an extended , uncontrolled seeing halo .",
    "the light from this halo can overwhelm the faint nebulosity of a circumstellar disk .",
    "differential polarimetry exploits the fact that scattered light from yso disks is highly polarized while the seeing halo has virtually zero polarization . by simultaneously imaging in two polarizations , the unpolarized halo can be removed , and the polarized disk light more clearly seen .",
    "_ potter _ ( 2003 ) and _ perrin et al . _",
    "( 2004 ) report detections of several yso nebulosities with this technique ; most are circumstellar envelopes .",
    "a few disks have also been studied with this technique , notably tw hya ( _ apai et al . _ , 2004 ) and lkca 15 ( _ potter _ , 2003 ) .",
    "the latter has not been detected in several conventional unpolarized imaging searches .",
    "t tauri stars commonly show photometric variability on timescales of a few days to months . in the youngest stars ,",
    "these variations are now thought to be the result of hot spots , variation in accretion rate , and occultation by warps in the inner disk , all of which are natural consequences of magnetospheric accretion mechanism discussed in the chapter by _ bouvier et al .",
    "_ disks also show variability , and in this section we describe the best studied cases , hh  30 and aa tau .    _ 2.4.1 photometric variability in hh  30 . _ similarly to their central stars , disks show photometric variability .",
    "the scattered light from the disk should follow as the star brightens and fades .",
    "the integrated magnitude of hh 30 varies on timescales of a few days over a range of more than one magnitude in both @xmath6 and @xmath7 ( _ wood et al .",
    "_ , 2000 ) .",
    "the range is slightly greater in @xmath6 than in @xmath7 .",
    "early photometry suggested that the variability was periodic , but subsequent studies have not confirmed this .",
    "the range of variability of the disk is likely to be a lower limit on the range of variability of the star , as the multiple optical paths taken by scattered light will likely act to smooth the stellar variations to some degree , both because of the finite speed of light ( 173 au per day ) and because the disk is illuminated by light from a range of stellar azimuths .",
    "cool spots produce stellar variability with ranges of no more than one magnitude ( _ herbst et al .",
    "_ , 1994 ) , and so can not explain the variability of the disk",
    ". some other mechanism must be at work in hh 30 , perhaps hot spots , variations in accretion rate , or occultations .",
    "this is consistent with the strong veiling component observed by _ white and hillenbrand _ ( 2004 ) .",
    "_ 2.4.2 morphological variability in hh 30 .",
    "_ more interesting and unexpected are the quantitative changes in the morphology of the scattered light ( _ burrows et al .",
    "_ , 1996 ; _ stapelfeldt et al . _ , 1999 ; _ cotera et al .",
    "_ , 2001 ; _ watson and stapelfeldt _ , in preparation ) .",
    "these include changes in the contrast between the brighter and fainter nebulae over a range of more than one magnitude ; changes in the lateral contrast between the two sides of the brighter nebula over a range of more than one magnitude ( see fig .",
    "3 ) ; and changes in the lateral contrast between the two sides of the fainter nebula over a range of about half a magnitude .",
    "the timescales for the variability are uncertain , but are less than one year .",
    "thus , the variability is not due to changes in the disk structure at radii of 100 au but rather changes in the pattern of illumination at radii of 1 au or less .",
    "thus , this _ morphological _ variability is fascinating as it allows us to peek into the central part of the disk and possibly constrain the geometry of the accretion region .",
    "however , before we use the variability to constrain anything , we need to understand its origin .",
    "two mechanisms have been suggested ; _ wood and whitney _ ( 1998 ) have suggested that inclined hot spots could illuminate the outer parts of disk like lighthouses , and _ stapelfeldt et al . _",
    "( 1999 ) have suggested that warps in the inner disk could cast shadows over the outer disk .    in the case of hh 30",
    ", one might hope to distinguish between the mechanisms on the basis of the color of the morphological variability .",
    "hst observations show no significant differences between @xmath6 and @xmath7 . naively , one would expect illumination by hot spots to produce stronger variability in the blue whereas optically - thick shadowing should be neutral in color .",
    "however , spectroscopic studies show that the veiling component is often relatively flat in the red ( _ basri and batalha _ , 1990 ;",
    "_ white and hillenbrand _ , 2004 ) , so the lack of color is inconclusive .",

    "hst observations show that the asymmetry can change from one side to the other in no more than about six months but do not significantly constrain a lower limit on the period or , indeed , demonstrate that the variability is periodic rather than stochastic . since the net polarization vectors of the two sides of the bright nebula are not parallel ( see fig .",
    "6 of _ whitney and hartmann _ , 1992 ) , the asymmetry should produce a polarimetric signature .",
    "on - going polarimetric monitoring of hh  30 may help to determine the timescale of the asymmetry .",
    "_ 2.4.3 aa tau .",
    "_ aa tau seems to be a prototype for both mechanisms suggested to explain the morphological variability of hh 30 , apparently possessing both inclined hot spots and occulting inner - disk warps ( _ bouvier et al .",

    "recent second - epoch observations of several objects by _ cotera et al_.  ( in preparation ) are very useful . nevertheless ,",
    "since most disks have been observed at only one or two epochs , there is little that we can say about their variability .",

    "it is largely sensitive to the total mass - opacity product of the disk . as the mass - opacity product of a disk",

    "one can not use the width of the dark lane to constrain the mass or the absolute opacity individually without additional information .",
    "this is because the appearance of the disk at optical and near - infrared wavelengths is a scattering problem , and in the equations governing such problems the mass density and opacity per unit mass always appear as a product . on the other hand",
    ", one can use changes in the width of the lane to quantify relative changes in the opacity as a function of wavelength ( see section 5.2 ) .",
    "the increase in separation of the nebulae with increasing projected distance from the star . by this we refer to the degree of curvature of the boundary of the dark lane separating the two nebulae or the degree of apparent flaring of the nebulae .",

    "the light that emerges close to the projected disk axis has scattered through relatively small angles and the light that emerges far from the projected disk axis has scattered through relatively large angles . increased forward scattering enhances the former and diminishes the latter .",

    "another exception may be disks in which the inner part of the disk shadows the outer part completely .",
    "3 .   the outer radius . scattered light images of edge - on disks sometimes show a relatively sharp outer cut - off and this is often interpreted as the outer radius of the disk . however , it is possible that the disk continues beyond the bright nebulae , but that it is shadowed .",
    "such an extension would likely not be seen in scattered light .",

    "_ , 2002 , 2005 ) . through these studies , the density structure of the gg tau ring is perhaps now the best understood of all yso disks .",
    "a key feature of the ring is its intermediate inclination of 37@xmath15 from face on .",
    "this spatially separates both the foreground and background parts of the ring from each other and from the central binary .",
    "this `` clean '' configuration allows the relative strength of forward scattering and backscattering to be directly measured .",
    "this quantity can be a powerful diagnostic of dust properties in the ring .",
    "the scattering phase function strongly favors forward scattering when the grain size is comparable to the wavelength . at wavelengths much larger than the grain size ,",
    "scattering becomes more isotropic .",
    "a comprehensive study of phase function effects in the gg tau ring was recently carried out by _ duchne et al . _",
    "( 2004 ) . using new images taken at 3.8 @xmath5 m",
    ", the longest wavelength to date at which scattered light from the ring has been detected , and existing images at shorter wavelengths , _ duchne et al .",
    "_ modeled the wavelength dependence of the phase function from 0.8 to 3.8@xmath5 m .",
    "highlights from their results are shown in fig .",
    "the results show that the 3.8 @xmath5 m scattered light must arise from dust grains larger than those in the ism , whereas the 0.8 @xmath5 m scattered light must simultaneously originate from much smaller particles .",
    "additional evidence for small particles is provided by the 1.0 @xmath5 m polarimetry of _ silber et al . _ ( 2000 ) , who found the backscattered light was highly polarized and thus dominated by submicron grains .",
    "the gg tau phase function results indicate that no single power - law distribution of grain sizes can simultaneously account for the observations .",
    "_ duchne et al . _",
    "( 2004 ) suggest that these results can be explained by a vertically stratified disk in which the grain size increases towards the midplane . in this view",
    ", large grains responsible for the 3.8 @xmath5 m scattered light would be located in a denser region closer to the disk midplane , a region that shorter wavelength photons can not reach .",
    "the stratification could be due to dust settling to the ring midplane .",
    "alternatively , it might be the case that the preference for scattering at grain sizes comparable to the wavelength is so strong that the large grains dominate the 3.8 @xmath5 m scattered light , even though they are less numerous than the small grains . in that case , vertical dust settling would not necessarily have taken place .",
    "this picture is very attractive .",
    "however , _",
    "krist et al . _",
    "( 2005 ) point out that current models of gg tau do not fully explain the observations .",
    "for example , no current model simultaneously reproduces the total brightness of the disk , its color , and its azimuthal variation .",
    "furthermore , the ratio of brightness of the near and far parts of the disk has been observed to vary with time .",
    "additional observations and models will be required to confirm the suggestion of a stratified disk .",
    "it would be very valuable to perform a similar study in other disk systems ; unfortunately , the gg tau ring is currently unique .",
    "gm aur has a disk viewed at an intermediate inclination .",
    "the disk is clearly seen in wfpc2 and nicmos images after careful subtraction of a reference psf .",
    "scattered light is detected between 0.4 and 2.1(55 and 300 au ) from the star .",
    "modeling of the scattered light images by _ schneider et al . _",
    "( 2003 ) derived a dust vertical scale height of 8 au at a radius of 100 au and a disk inclination 56@xmath16 from face - on , and demonstrated that there was also a remnant circumstellar envelope .",
    "however , the coronagraphic occulting spot used for the observations blocked any information on the properties of the inner disk . to access that region , _",
    "schneider et al .",
    "_ turned to the infrared spectral energy distribution ( sed ) .",
    "emission between 2 and 70 @xmath5 m probes the disk temperature structure inside 40 au , and thus is complementary to the results of the scattered light modeling . using the disk model derived from the scattered light images , and appropriate assumptions about grain properties , _ schneider et al . _",
    "were able to reproduce gm aur s sed , including the millimeter continuum points ( see fig .",
    "the very small near - ir excess emission requires that the inner part of the disk be optically thin .",
    "_ rice et al . _",
    "( 2003 ) showed that the inner region may have been cleared by a jovian - mass planet .",
    "more recently , _",
    "calvet et al . _",
    "( 2005 ) have presented _ spitzer _ irs spectroscopy of gm  aur .",
    "this data requires an inner optically - thin region that extends to 24  au from the star .",
    "this is much larger than previous estimates based on modeling of broad - band mid - infrared photometry .",
    "the _ spitzer _",
    "irs data show that the inner disk is not empty , but contains a small amount of small dust grains which produce the silicate emission feature . to fit the long wavelength sed , the average grain size in the outer disk must be larger than in the inner , optically - thin region .        scattered light images do not generally provide information on the inner part of the disk .",
    "in addition to iras data , high - quality mid - infrared spectra from the _ spitzer space telescope _ are becoming available for many yso disks .",
    "scattered light images reduce many of the degrees of freedom in modeling disk spectra and seds , leading directly to more robust sed models .",
    "future combined studies of multiwavelength disk images , continuum spectra , and seds will provide critical tests for models of disk evolution .",
    "a key goal is to determine an evolutionary sequence for dust , especially dust growth and changes in shape and composition .",
    "one manifestation of dust evolution is to change the dust opacity law .",
    "work in hv tau c and hh 30 has shown that the opacity law can be determined from hst images in the optical and near - infrared using current modeling codes .",
    "extending this work is simply a matter of obtaining the relevant observations and `` cranking the handle '' .",
    "observations of thermal emission at longer wavelengths will help to restrict the degeneracies in the scattered light modeling .",
    "we would expect to find disks with different opacity laws , some with near - ism opacity laws like hv tau c and others with less opacity laws like hh 30 .",
    "the science will come from comparing the opacity laws with models for dust evolution and from correlating the opacity laws with system properties such as age , accretion activity , disk mass , and stellar multiplicity .",
    "the evidence for dust settling discussed in section 5.1 is as yet tentative . to advance",
    ", we need to be able to confidently compare the equivalent temperatures derived from the dust scale heights to the real temperatures in the disk or , more generally , the vertical distributions of the dust and the gas .",
    "this will require detailed calculations of the structure of the disk that solve for the vertical structure under the assumption of thermal equilibrium but allow for uncertainties in the radial structure .",
    "again , including mid - infrared and millimeter data will be very useful .    of course",
    ", we are ultimately interested in detecting young planets in disks , and especially those planets that are still accreting . direct detection will be difficult ( see the chapters by _ beuzit et al . _ and",
    "_ beichman et al .",
    "_ ) , but we can hope to observe the gap cleared by a planet as it grows . at the moment , these are most clearly seen in infrared spectra , and the contribution of scattered light images is mainly to reduce the number of degrees of freedom in the disk geometry and inclination and thereby improve the reliability of the models for the infrared emission .",
    "we would like to understand the transition between optically - thick protoplanetary disks and optically - thin debris disks in order to determine the timescale over which planetesimals and gas  the building blocks of planet formation ",
    "are present .",
    "advances are being made in this field with _",
    "imaging and spectroscopy .",
    "scattered light imaging can contribute because small amounts of dust can potentially be detected even at radii at which infrared detections are difficult , although the realization of this goal will require advances in high - contrast imaging .      the biggest instrumental advance for the study of yso disks will be the advent of the atacama large millimeter array ( alma ) . with spatial resolution surpassing that of hst , very high resolution spectroscopy for chemical and kinematic studies , and the sensitivity to study the disks of low - mass stars as far away as orion , alma will have a major impact on the field",
    "however , even in the era of alma , scattered light imaging will still make significant contributions to disk studies .",
    "first , scattered light traces the surface where stellar photons deliver energy to the disk .",
    "it will still be necessary to characterize this interaction region if the disk temperature structure , and thus its chemical nature , is to be understood .",
    "secondly , while millimeter wavelengths probe large particle sizes in the dust population , scattered light imaging provides information on the small particles . both are needed to provide a full picture of disk grain properties and their time evolution .",
    "the combination of millimeter maps and scattered light images at comparable resolutions will be a powerful synthesis for disk science efforts .",
    "the imaging performance of large groundbased telescopes can be expected to continue its evolution .",
    "particularly important will be new extreme adaptive optics instruments at the gemini and vlt observatories .",
    "their improved contrast performance should enable additional detections of yso disks in the near- and mid - infrared .",
    "the maturation and increasing application of differential imaging polarimetry should also yield exciting results .",
    "several concepts for extremely large ( d @xmath17 30 m ) telescopes are now being studied . when realized ( maybe not until after _ protostars and planets vi _ ) , these facilities will provide a threefold advance in spatial resolution .",
    "higher resolution images will improve our knowledge of all aspects of disk structure .",
    "the inner holes in systems such as tw hya and perhaps gm aur should be resolvable .",
    "an exciting possibility is the detection of hot young planets near to and perhaps even within yso disks and characterization of their dynamical interactions .    among future space missions in design and development",
    ", two will provide important capabilities for disk scattered light imaging . the nasa / esa james webb space telescope will have a 6.5 m primary mirror and operate from 1 to 28 @xmath5 m .",
    "it will be a superb telescope for imaging disks in mid - infrared scattered light and will provide roughly 0.2resolution . in the near - infrared , it will offer almost three times better resolution than hst , but is unlikely to provide improved contrast . from the point of view of high contrast imaging",
    ", the terrestrial planet finder coronagraph mission would be extremely exciting , as it would be able to detect scattered light from disks as tenuous as our own solar system s zodiacal light .",
    "however , as this misssion may be more than a decade away , several groups are proposing smaller coronagraphic space telescopes that might be realized sooner .",
    "while waiting for these future developments , the expanded application of existing scattered light imaging capabilities ( ao and mid - ir imaging from large ground - based telescopes and high - contrast imaging with hst ) should continue unabated .",
    "the new observations described in this review and the observation advances outlines above suggest a wealth of detailed data on circumstellar disks will become available . what will this data demand from the codes and models ?",
    "future codes will need to produce high - resolution images and integrated spectra at wavelengths stretching from the optical to the millimeter .",
    "they should be able to model three - dimensional distributions of sources and opacity and should incorporate accurate dust scattering phase functions , polarization , and the effects of aligned grains .",
    "evidence for dust growth and sedimentation requires that codes no longer restrict themselves to homogenoeus dust properties , but must be able to treat multiple dust species with different spatial distributions .",
    "they will probably solve for radiation transfer using monte carlo techniques in optically thin regions and the diffusion approximation in optically thick regions .",
    "computers are expected to become increasingly parallel in the future .",
    "many codes can already run in parallel , but those that can not will need to be modified to do so . in this context ,",
    "monte carlo algorithms have the advantage over classical algorithms as they often have natural parallelism .",
    "many radiation transfer codes now have the capability to determine the density structure from given disk physics or incorporate density structures from dynamical simulations .",
    "these will be increasingly useful in providing detailed tests of disk structure .",
    "on the other hand , parameterized density models will continue to be a useful tool for mitigating our incomplete knowledge of disk physics .",
    "the combination of future data and future codes will allow us to study dust properties , dust settling , disk structure , disk - planet interactions , accretion , and disk evolution .",
    "in the longer term , advances in techniques for numerical simulations coupled with increases in computing power and parallel processing make accurate radiation hydrodynamic simulations of disk formation and evolution a distant but realistic goal .",
    "perhaps the most important near - term work is to apply scattered light modeling techniques across already extant disk image datasets .",
    "observers have provided a significant number of new , high - quality images , but the corresponding modeling efforts have not kept pace .",
