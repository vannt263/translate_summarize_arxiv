    "elliptical galaxies follow an overall relation of decreasing size with decreasing luminosity that is continuous over the whole range of luminosities , but is more complex than a simple power law @xcite .",
    "the universality of this relation has been a subject of considerable debate : are there different scaling relations for faint and bright galaxies , or for galaxies of low and high surface brightness @xcite ?",
    "a continuous relation joining bright and faint galaxies would seem to support the notion of a similar origin of these galaxies , regardless of their luminosity @xcite .    at high luminosities , elliptical galaxies ( es ) follow a steep size - luminosity relation and are commonly believed to be a product of hierarchical galaxy formation through mergers ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in contrast , the faint low - surface - brightness galaxies classified as dwarf ellipticals ( des ) , which exhibit a much shallower relation with large scatter @xcite , may have acquired much of their present - day structure from environmental influence through tidal forces and ram pressure @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the discovery of a number of very compact , low - mass , non - star - forming elliptical galaxies ( ces ) adds even more complexity to the interpretation of the observed scaling relations of early - type galaxies @xcite . despite having a luminosity similar to the des ,",
    "they clearly deviate from the scaling relations , in that they have a much smaller size and higher effective surface brightness at a given luminosity than the des @xcite .",
    "interestingly , they seem to fall on the extension of the relation defined by bright ellipticals alone @xcite .",
    "they also possess a much larger velocity dispersion than found in a typical de of similar luminosity ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see fig .",
    "1 middle panel ) .",
    "until the advent of large - scale survey and high - resolution imaging from the hubble space telescope , these compact objects were thought to be extremely rare .",
    "m32 and vcc1297 are classical examples of ces in the nearby universe @xcite .",
    "the population of known ces , however , is increasing @xcite .",
    "most of them are found in dense environments , particularly around massive galaxies .",
    "such proximity to a massive host favours the scenario in which they arise through the tidal stripping of larger galaxies , where the inner bulge component becomes a naked compact galaxy after losing its outer disk component during interaction with its massive host @xcite .",
    "indeed , the discovery of ces with tidal debris near a massive host confirmed this picture @xcite .    in the absence of such environmental factors ,",
    "it is therefore naively expected that neither des nor ces can be formed in the field . however , the recent discovery of a ce in isolation @xcite has challenged this classical notion of environmental dependent evolution of compact low - mass , early - type galaxies . in this regard , we present a new field ce , cgcg 036 - 042 , which is closer than any previously identified , at a redshift of 0.007 , whereas the @xcite ce has a redshift of 0.019 .",
    "we present structural and stellar population properties , derived from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) archival images and new optical spectroscopic data that we have obtained from vlt - fors2 observation .",
    "finally , we discuss the possible origin of ces in such environments and their rare existence .",
    "as our primary interest is to find low - mass early - type galaxies in an isolated environment using the extensive sky coverage of the sdss , we carried out a systematic search for such objects in the local volume ( z @xmath7 0.01 ) in the field , deriving the distance to the nearest massive galaxies in terms of sky projected separation and relative velocities .",
    "we define isolated galaxies as those not having any nearby massive galaxies ( m@xmath8 @xmath7 @xmath218=71 km / s / mpc throughout the paper . ] ) within a projected distance of 700 kpc , and a velocity difference of 700 km / s .",
    "the morphological selection has been done with visual inspection of the sdss colour images .",
    "3.4 arcmin ( 28 @xmath9kpc ) , where north is top and east is left .",
    "we show a g - r - i combined true colour image ( top left ) , the r - band image ( top right ) , a one - component galfit model ( middle left ) and its residual ( middle right ) , as well as a two - component galfit model ( bottom left ) and its residual ( bottom right).,width=321 ]    at the position ra=10:08:10.32 ,",
    "dec=+02:27:48.3 , and a redshift of z = 0.00687 , we found a rare low - mass early - type galaxy , cgcg 036 - 042 , with an extended outer component ( fig .",
    "[ gfig ] , top panels ) .",
    "it is located south - west of the ngc 3166 group at an angular distance of 1.67 degrees . assuming the distance to the ngc 3166 group is 22.6 mpc = 1598 km / s @xcite . ]",
    ", the angular separation corresponds to a physical projected distance of 660 kpc .",
    "however , the difference in radial velocity between the ngc 3166 group and cgcg 036 - 042 is 755 km / s , only slightly larger than the relative velocity criterium that we applied to exclude it as a group member , which is @xmath410 times greater than the standard deviation of the velocities of known group members @xcite .    in the following ,",
    "we take , with no evidence to suggest that cgcg 036 - 042 is located at the distance of ngc 3166 group , the distance to cgcg 036 - 042 to be 33.1 mpc , based on the hubble law and the virgo + the great attractor infall corrected radial velocity @xcite , and it is thus _ not _ a member of ngc 3166 group . in this case",
    ", it has an r - band apparent ( absolute ) brightness of @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) mag .",
    "it is notable that we do find a low - mass star - forming galaxy near to cgcg 036 - 042 , at a sky - projected distance of 67.7 kpc with a relative radial velocity less than 100 km / s ( ra=10:08:06.94 , dec=+02:20:42.4 & redshift=0.00655 ) .",
    "adopting the ce s distance , the companion has an absolute magnitude ( m@xmath1 ) of @xmath12 and is thus 1.5 mag fainter than cgcg 036 - 042 .      to perform a detailed image analysis we retrieved archival images from the sdss - iii database @xcite , using the @xmath0-band image , since it provides a higher signal to noise ratio ( s / n ) than other bands .",
    "cgcg 036 - 042 is covered by two adjacent pointings of sdss , but is located right at the edge of both .",
    "we therefore needed to combine both fields to enclose the entire galaxy and extended stellar halo into a single image file . before combination",
    ", the sky - backgrounds were subtracted individually in each field , sampling the sky background at 10 independent positions around the galaxy where each individual sky region has an area of 10 @xmath13 10 pixel box .",
    "the sky - backgrounds were then computed as an average of sampled sky in each field .    after combining the two pointings ,",
    "the level of sky - background was cross - checked by comparing the mean sky - background of different subfields .",
    "we found that the difference in mean sky - background between the subfields is well within the sky - standard deviation of each subfields .",
    "the seeing in these fields is rather good , with an @xmath0-band point spread function ( psf ) full width half maximum ( fwhm ) of 0.9 arcsec .",
    "colour gradient is shown in lower panel .",
    "the positions of the dashed and solid vertical lines represent the mean psf fwhm in the sdss r - band image and the effective radius of the galaxy , respectively . the colour profile beyond 2kpc ( grey )",
    "is derived in bins of 20@xmath1320 pixels placed outward along the major axis.,width=294 ]    we used the iraf task @xmath14 to extract the galaxy s major - axis light profile , shown in fig . [ mfig ] . during the ellipse fitting the",
    "centre and position angle were held fixed and the ellipticity was allowed to vary .",
    "the centre of the galaxy was calculated using the iraf task @xmath15 and the position angle is determined using several iterative runs of @xmath14 before the final run .        due to the rather complicated light profile",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ mfig ] , top panel ) it is difficult to approximate the observed light distribution with a single parametric profile and then derive the global photometric parameters .",
    "the photometric parameters  half - light radius and total luminosity  are therefore derived using a non - parametric approach .",
    "we follow a similar procedure as described in @xcite .",
    "the total flux is computed within an aperture of twice the petrosian radius @xcite and corrected for the missing light outside of aperture as suggested by @xcite , although this correction is only 0.1 mag .",

    "we have presented a rare isolated ce , cgcg 036 - 042 , of which only one other has been identified to date . cgcg",
    "036 - 042 exhibits similar structural , kinematic and stellar population properties to that of @xcite .",
    "however , it remarkably shows a faint stellar component that extends up to 10 kpc from the centre . considering these evidences",
    ", we discuss below the possible formation scenarios of ces in isolation .",
    "although des and ces share a luminosity range , ces exhibit very different structural , kinematic and stellar population properties @xcite .",
    "they are not only an outlier in the size - luminosity relation , but also possess relatively high velocity dispersion and alpha - element abundance ratios compare to normal des . a typical",
    "de has a velocity dispersion of less than 50 km / s and near solar [ @xmath16/fe ] , whereas ces generally exhibit central velocity dispersions of nearly 100 km / s and a significantly super - solar [ @xmath16/fe ] @xcite .",
    "the branching of the size - luminosity relation was extensively discussed by @xcite : ces and the so - called ultra - compact dwarf galaxies ( ucds ) seem to rather follow the relation of es .",
    "@xcite proposed a maximum compactness , i.e.  maximum density , for any old stellar system .",
    "however , note that the scatter of data points in the de region blurs the distinction between des and ces ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* figure 9 ) , although the ces remain consistently at the lower part of the scattered data points as we can see in figure 4 .",
    "high - redshift observations ( for example * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have revealed that extremely compact early - type galaxies  but more massive than typical ces  are already in place at @xmath17 .",
    "the formation of these super dense objects has been studied from observational and theoretical perspectives @xcite .",
    "the general consensus is that dissipational collapse of matter during mergers of gas - rich galaxies leads to the formation of compact es @xcite .",
    "this scenario is also a good candidate for the origin of isolated ces .",
    "the observed super - solar value of the alpha - element abundance in our ce indicates that the majority of stars were formed in a short burst of star - formation @xcite , consistent with such a scenario .",
    "the observed gradient in age and metallicity can also be interpreted as the result of a central starburst after a merger , due to tidal inflow of star - forming gas driven by the interaction @xcite , leading to the formation of a dense stellar core @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the presence of fine structure  stellar bridges , shells and streams  in early - type galaxies has also been interpreted as the signature of tidal interactions or mergers @xcite .",
    "the observed extended outer component in our ce may be the consequence of a tidal interaction .",
    "alternatively , it might stem from the accretion of an even lower - mass galaxy ( see * ? ? ?",
    "however , such an accretion origin of the extended component would obviously not help to understand the existence of the ce itself in the first place .",
    "as cgcg 036 - 042 is located far beyond the nearest massive galaxy and has a large relative velocity , we think it is unlikely that it might have been disrupted by it .",
    "such mechanisms are observed very near to the giant host or the centre of a cluster or group of galaxies .",
    "for example , both ce systems of @xcite have sky projected separations of less than 20 kpc from a massive galaxy and relative velocities of less than 200 km / s . moreover , in our extensive search of disrupted dwarf galaxies ( @xcite and paudel et al .  in prep . ) around massive galaxies in the sdss data , we find no low - mass galaxies that are visibly in the process of disruption located more than 500 kpc from the massive host or with relative velocities larger than 300 km / s  in contrast to the ce presented here , with 660 kpc and 755 km / s , respectively .    while we can not entirely rule out a high speed fly - by of a bulge - dominated disk galaxy , it remains to be shown that this would be effective in destroying the entire outer disk during the very short interaction time , since such interactions have so far mainly be considered for inducing structure in the disk ( e.g.  bar formation , @xcite ) . in numerical simulation",
    ", it has been shown that the probability of a merger origin for low mass galaxies is very small compared to their more massive counterparts .",
    "@xcite predict that only one third of their least massive early - type galaxies have two progenitors .",
    "however , note that this result is primarily for cluster environments and , in contrast , @xcite predict that merger of sub - halos is significant outside of main host halo , and that small satellite galaxies located relatively far from the central galaxy might have a merger origin .",
    "also , on the observational side , the number of known dwarf - dwarf merger candidates have dramatically increased recently @xcite .",
    "the characterisation of environment is not straightforward and the criteria applied to define the various environments : isolated , field , group and cluster are diverse in literature @xcite . although cgcg 036 - 042 is located near to the ngc 3166 group in sky projection , it falls outside of the group s zero - velocity surface @xcite .",
    "we had applied a simple definition of isolation to select isolated galaxies ,  though our constraints seem more strict than the criteria used to prepare the catalog of isolated galaxies ( cig * ? ? ?",
    "they use a simple criteria that the galaxy ( with a diamter d ) should have no companion of size d/4 to 4d within the sky projected distance of 20d . as describe above",
    ", we do find a low - mass star - forming galaxy close to our ce , which defies the definition of isolation , ours and others e.g @xcite , but interestingly fulfils the cig criteria .",
    "as cgcg 036 - 042 is outside of ngc 3166 group , perhaps one can consider it an isolated pair outside the group .",
    "moreover , the presence of small companion , if it is truly bounded to cgcg 036 - 042 , might reinforce the our idea of independent evolution of cgcg 036 - 042 from the nearby group : the alleged pair have to remain bound during the fly - by of the group , and it is unlikely that the smaller disk galaxy would not suffer any disturbance during this interaction .    nevertheless , having only slightly more than a quarter of the cgcg 036 - 042 s luminosity and  based on the companion s bluer colour  probably less than a fifth of its stellar mass , it is thus unlikely that a strong interaction between these two low - mass galaxies is ongoing . nonetheless , while the smaller star - forming dwarf shows no signs of disruption in the sdss data , deeper images are necessary to reveal possible weak interaction signatures .    at the distance beyond the virgo cluster ,",
    "it is very hard to detect such compact objects in the seeing - limited imaging data from ground - based facilities .",
    "space - based telescopes with high resolution imaging capability are needed to measure the sizes of these compact galaxies unambiguously , which have effective radii comparable to the seeing of ground base observations .",
    "unfortunately , such observations are expensive and the available data on ces was mostly collected serendipitously , with the primary observing targets typically being nearby massive galaxies .",
    "this obviously leads to a biased sample , in which ces are located close to massive galaxies .",
    "thus it is not surprising that the stripping scenario for ce formation has often considered as adequate .",
    "nevertheless , ces are indeed rare objects in the local universe , including group and cluster environments : only a handful of ces have been reported within the distance of virgo cluster @xcite .",
    "however , the only two isolated ces reported so far  the one presented here and that of @xcite  are both located at a greater distance , and so it will be up to future surveys to confirm or refute whether their abundance is really so much lower than that of ces near massive galaxies .",
    "this study has made use of nasa s astrophysics data system bibliographic services and the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) .",
