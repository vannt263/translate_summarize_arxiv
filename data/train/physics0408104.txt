    "a classical topic in electromagnetism is the study of wave transmission in a finite parallel - plane faces medium , know as fabry - perot resonator .",
    "when the medium presents nonlinear behavior , bistability appears @xcite . to explain this phenomenon , the nonlinear fabry - perot resonator ( nlfp ) was modelled by a third order susceptibility or kerr - type nonlinearity @xcite . at monochromatic plane wave excitation",
    ", the nlfp stationary regime is summarized in a non - time - dependent nonlinear wave equation for the complex field amplitudes , the nonlinear helmholtz equation ( nlhe ) .",
    "hence , the reflectance and transmittance problem reduces to finding the nlhe solution with appropriate boundary conditions for the field amplitude modulus and phase .",
    "the nlhe complexity led to approximate methods of resolution .",
    "many approaches consider two counter - propagating waves in the medium and the analysis is done by separately considering the effects on each wave @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the linear superposition principle is no longer valid in nonlinear media and the separation of the electromagnetic field in these back and forth waves is meaningless . as a result , the nlhe separation into two equations , one for each wave , is only possible by neglecting various coupling nonlinear terms that would give an important contribution to the accuracy of the transmittance results .",
    "moreover the slowly varying envelope approximation ( svea ) is often applied to these waves @xcite when , yet within the counter - propagating wave approach , its validity was questioned @xcite .",
    "also , the boundary conditions were simplified rather than rigorously treating them @xcite .",
    "the above facts suggest that all these approximated approaches could not physically be equivalents to the exact problem .",
    "the work done by chen and mills exactly solve the nlfp for an absorptionless kerr - type medium @xcite .",
    "the proper of its resolution method was to assume a general complex field within the medium , disregarding the concept of counter - propagating waves .",
    "chen and mills derive a two coupled equation system for the field amplitude modulus and phase together with general boundary conditions , thus obtaining an analytic - transcendental solution for the transmittance of the nlfp .",
    "on the other hand , their work permitted us to note an implicit difference between the time - averaged poynting vector modulus , i.e. the electromagnetic radiation intensity @xmath0 , and the squared - field amplitude modulus @xmath1 inside the nonlinear medium .",
    "if the nonequivalence of these magnitudes were true , it could change certain well - established fundamental concepts in classical electrodynamics .",
    "this fact motivated us to develop a novel approach to wave propagation in nonlinear media inside the fabry - perot framework called _ s - formalism_. it introduces a new variable related to the time - averaged poynting vector which states that its magnitude could be nonequivalent with the squared - field amplitude modulus contrary to commonly accepted .",
    "furthermore , the s - formalism presents two important advantages : it permits to directly monitor the radiation intensity within the medium , and it avoids approximations , such as the svea , simplification of boundary conditions , and so on .",
    "the fact that the time - averaged poynting vector modulus be nonequivalent with the squared - field amplitude modulus , as the s - formalism will show , implies that the nonlinearity of kerr - type media is not proportional to the intensity which is contrary to what has been established to - date .",
    "this assertion leads to the following question regarding the modelling of the nlfp : is it a kerr - type nonlinearity , or does it vary proportionately to the intensity ? as this question does not have a definitive answer , the existence of the latter can not be denied .",
    "then , we define the _ poynting medium _ as the medium where nonlinearity is proportional to intensity .",
    "thus , our objective is to solve the _ poynting - nlfp _ through the s - formalism comparing the resultant transmittance with that obtained for a _ kerr - nlfp _ to remark the nonequivalence between squared - field amplitude modulus and radiation intensity .        in section",
    "ii , we derive the s - formalism in the following form : first the time - averaged poynting vector assuming harmonic fields is calculated .",
    "then , a dimensionless variable which is proportional to intensity is introduced .",
    "thus , a set of field evolution differential equations and the general boundary condition equations on the new field variable are obtained , which constitutes the s - formalism . in section iii ,",
    "the new approach is applied to derive the transmittance for the poynting - nlfp and the results compared with that obtained for a kerr - nlfp .",
    "a brief discussion about the possibily of existence and observation of poynting media is given .",
    "finally , in section iv , we conclude .",
    "refering to figure [ fig = problema ] , we start writing the linearly polarized transversal harmonic electromagnetic fields of frequency @xmath2 as    @xmath3 \\mathbf{h}_{\\ell}(z , t)=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(h^{\\omega}_{\\ell}(z)e^{-i\\omega t}+c.c .",

    "( [ s ] ) it is clear that if @xmath25 is not a linear function on @xmath18 , as is often happens in nonlinear media , then @xmath26 and @xmath27 are nonequivalents .",

    "however , for increasing values of @xmath53 , the peak transmittance separation diminishes for the kerr medium while it increases for the poynting medium .",

    "note that the departure from airy - type function for the kerr medium is stronger than for the poynting medium .",

    ", the kerr nonlinear susceptibility varies periodically .",
    "this fact implies the formation of a phase grating in the kerr medium on the contrary to the poynting medium .",
    "perhaps , this substantial difference can be measured , and this could be the starting point to experimentally identify a poynting medium .",
    "it is a fact that several unusual types of nonlinearities were predicted before its experimental observation , as it was remarked , for example , in the pioneer works of baranova et al . @xcite . with the aim to elucidate the isotropic medium requirements to observe the new phenomena , those authors pointed out the necessity of a analysis about transformation properties of electromagnetic quantities under rotations , spatial inversion and time reversal .",

    "intensity - dependent transmission and bistability was experimentally observed @xcite .",

    "in addition , parity under time reversal should be violated in poynting media .",
    "this means that any weak dissipative process , that converts field energy into heat , is necessary to remove the rule relating to the @xmath102 transformation .",
    "for example , either very weak absorbtion or current flow by external quasi - static field , that basically do not affect the wave propagation at light frequency @xmath2 , would ensure the medium non - invariance under time reversal .",
    "we believe that , in spite of experimental works are required , the above preliminary analysis could stimulate further discussions regarding the existence of poynting media .",
    "in summary , we derive a new formalism in terms of dimensionless variables related with the time - averaged poynting vector and field amplitude modulus within the fabry - perot framework .",

    "we find marked disagreement in the transmittance of both media , which support the differences between i and @xmath83 .",
    "also , a space - time symmetry analysis shows that the poynting nonlinearity should be only possible in noncentrosymmetric materials .",
    "the statements and analysis pointed out here constitute an advance on theoretical views of basic concepts in electrodynamics .",
    "the s - formalism could be important in problems where the time - averaged poynting vector must be rigourously monitored like in photoconductor or photorefractive materials .",
    "further to this particular case studied here , this new approach leaves open the possibility of new physical results in actual topics on nonlinear wave propagation such as spatial solitons , wave mixing and others .",
    "finally , we leave open the possibility that experimental techniques , based on intensity dependent phase changes of a gaussian beam such as _ z - scan technique _",
