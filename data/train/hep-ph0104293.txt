    "the ads curvature @xmath8 and the 5d planck mass @xmath11 are both assumed to be of order @xmath10 . at the tev - brane gravity is weak because the zero mode corresponding to the 4d graviton is localized at the positive tension brane ( planck - brane ) .    in low scale models of quantum gravity higher - dimensional operators ,",
    "now only tev - scale suppressed , are known to induce rapid proton decay , large neutrino masses and flavor violating interactions . in models with non - factorizable ( warped )",
    "geometry these problems can be cured to some extent by introducing the standard model ( sm ) fermions as bulk fields , without relying on ad - hoc symmetries such as lepton or baryon number @xcite .",
    "because of the warp factor , the effective cut - off scale varies along the extra dimension . if the quarks and leptons are localized towards the planck - brane in the extra dimension , the effective cut - off scale can by much larger than a tev .",

    "the induced fermion masses crucially depend on the overlap between the higgs and fermion wave functions in the extra dimension , and naturally become small for fermions residing close to the planck - brane .",
    "this mechanism offers a higher - dimensional view on the problem of fermion mass hierarchies @xcite .",
    "also , the quark mixings can be nicely reproduced from order unity yukawa couplings @xcite .",

    "the measured w and z boson masses are reproduced by some ( mild ) tuning of parameters .",
    "we note in passing that contributions of 10 tev kaluza - klein states to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon are two to three orders of magnitude smaller @xcite than the recently reported deviation of this observable from its sm prediction @xcite .    taking into account the constraints on the locations of fermions from their masses and mixings",

    "@xcite are in conflict with experiment for kaluza klein masses below 25 tev @xcite , are safely suppressed . in this respect",
    ", moving the sm fermions off the tev - brane allows for smaller kk masses @xmath14 tev and therefore reduces the amount of fine - tuning to obtain realistic weak boson masses .",
    "the unacceptably large majorana neutrino masses ( see previous paragraph ) are eliminated by imposing lepton number symmetry .",
    "another important consequence is that the proton becomes stable .",
    "however , certain baryon number violating processes , e.g.  neutron anti - neutron oscillations with @xmath15 , are still possible and may lead to interesting experimental signatures @xcite .",

    "we consider the non - factorizable metric @xcite @xmath16 where @xmath17 .",

    "@xcite we have shown that this geometrical picture beautifully generates the charged lepton and quark mass hierarchies , as well as quark mixings , by employing @xmath57-parameters and @xmath58 of order unity . in the following",
    "we apply this mechanism to also generate small neutrino masses consistent with neutrino oscillation experiments .",

    "we assume non - hierarchical yukawa couplings @xmath108 on order of the 5d gauge coupling @xmath109 .",
    "however , in our framework the structure of the yukawa couplings is not mapped one to one to a neutrino mass matrix .",
    "rather , the yukawa texture is deformed by the neutrino wave function in the extra dimension which enter eq .",
    "( [ 3.2 ] ) .",
    "therefore , it is not trivial that the neutrino data can be obtained with order unity yukawa couplings . on the other hand",

    "the sm relationship between the gauge couplings and masses of the z and w bosons gets modified .",
    "the electroweak precision data then requires the lowest kk excitation of the gauge bosons to be heavier than about 10 tev @xcite .",
    "this bound becomes especially important if the fermions are localized towards the planck - brane @xmath110 . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , this applies to all sm fermions , with the exception of the top - quark , if the fermion mass hierarchy arises from their different locations in the extra dimension . in this case the bounds induced by the contribution of kk excitations of the sm gauge bosons to the electroweak precision observables are weak .",
    "they only require the kk masses to be above about 1 tev @xcite . in the following",
    "we will therefore assume that the mass of the first kk gauge boson is @xmath111 tev .",
    "the corresponding masses of the kk fermions are then in the range 10 to 16 tev , for @xmath112 .",
    "the mass of the lightest kk graviton is 16 tev .    for simplicity",
    "we assume diagonal yukawa couplings @xmath50 for the charged leptons .",

    "the associated fermion mass parameters are @xcite @xmath120 the zero mode wave functions of the left - handed electron and tau , the right - handed zero mode of @xmath121 and the first excited state of the tau are displayed in fig .",
    "since the sm neutrinos are at different locations in the extra dimension , non - hierarchical yukawa couplings typically lead to nearest neighbor - type neutrino mass matrices .",
