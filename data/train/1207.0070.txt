    "exploring nuclear systems with strangeness , especially those with multiple units of strangeness , has attracted lots of attention from the researchers for many years .",
    "such systems have many astrophysical and cosmological implications and are indeed interesting by themselves .",
    "for instance , the core of neutron stars may contain a high fraction of hyperons@xcite , resulting in the third family of compact stars which possess a similar mass to a neutron star but smaller radius@xcite .",
    "the formation of strange matter in relativistic heavy ion collisions has also been explored .",
    "recently , the observation of an antimatter hypernucleus @xmath2 in relativistic heavy - ion collisions was reported by star collaboration@xcite .",
    "strange hadronic matter have been investigated extensively by many authors@xcite-@xcite . in the strange hadronic matter , the strange quarks are localized within individual hyperons , which are resumed to retain their identity in the bound system .",
    "schaffner et al .",
    "@xcite discussed for the first time a finite system of strange hadronic matter ( memos ) including @xmath3 and @xmath1 hyperons .",
    "strange hadronic matter in bulk was studied first by glendenning @xcite . as pointed out by schaffner and gal @xcite , some early works about strange hadronic matter are incomplete , either discuss @xmath0 matter@xcite or ignoring @xmath1 hyperons@xcite or arbitrarily constraining the fraction of strangeness@xcite .",
    "the correct calculation should fulfill the requirements of chemical equilibrium .",
    "on the other hand , the study of hypernuclei provides valuable information on hyperon - nucleon and hyperon - hyperon interactions .",
    "such information is crucial for understanding the properties of multi - strange systems and neutron stars .",
    "the single-@xmath0 hypernucleus is one of the most extensively studied hypernuclei where the @xmath0 hyperon is sitting outside of the closed - shell nuclear core .",
    "@xmath0 hypernuclear spectroscopy through the @xmath4 reaction indicates that @xmath0 is weakly bound in nuclear medium and its spin - orbit splitting is quite small compared to that of nucleon @xcite .",
    "many theoretical efforts to evaluate hypernuclear structures have been devoted during past decades in models with hadronic degree of freedom@xcite-@xcite .",
    "calculations have also been successfully performed using quark meson coupling model where both hyperon and nucleon are viewed as compositions of quarks @xcite-@xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , guichon et al .",
    "studied the properties of hypernuclei using the latest version of the quark - meson coupling model . in their work ,",
    "the effect of the medium on the color - hyperfine interaction due to the gluon exchange between quarks was included , which turned out to significantly affect the medium hadron ( in particular , hyperon ) mass .",
    "recently , an improved quark- mass density dependent model ( iqmdd ) with quark meson coupling mechanism was proposed@xcite-@xcite .",
    "the model was in part inspired by the quark mass density- dependent ( qmdd ) model of fowler , raha and weiner @xcite , where density dependence of quark mass was introduced to achieve phenomenological quark confinement .",
    "to form hadronic matter , quarks interact via the exchange of mesons in the same way as suggested in quark- meson coupling ( qmc ) model first introduced by guichon @xcite .",
    "the qmdd model assumes that the masses of u , d and s quarks ( and the corresponding antiquarks ) satisfy : @xmath5 @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the baryon number density , @xmath8 is the current mass of the strange quark , and @xmath9 is the bag constant . as explained in refs .",
    "@xcite-@xcite , the @xmath10 eqs.([mq1 ] ) and ( [ mq2 ] ) corresponds to a quark confinement hypothesis and can replace the mit bag boundary condition and produces very similar results .",
    "quark- meson coupling ( qmc ) is an hybrid model which successfully describes many physical properties of nuclear matter and nuclei@xcite-@xcite . in this model ,",
    "the nuclear system was described as a collection of non - overlapping mit bags in which quarks interact through the exchange of scalar and vector mesons .",
    "the interactions between quarks and mesons are limited within the mit bag region . as was pointed in refs .",
    "@xcite-@xcite , this model has two major shortcomings : ( 1 ) it can not describe the quark deconfinement phase transition since the quarks are confined within the mit bag by hard boundary condition . since the latter is a model hypothesis , deconfinement phase transition does not take place naturally .",
    "( 2 ) it is difficult to do nuclear many - body calculation beyond mean - field approximation(mfa ) by means of qmc model , because one can not find the free propagators of quarks and mesons easily .",
    "these may be attributed to the reason that the interactions between quarks and mesons are limited within the bag regions . in short ,",
    "these two shortcomings stem from the mit bag constraint .",
    "the introduction of iqmdd model was aiming at circumventing these difficulties . instead of the mit bag ,",
    "a friedberg- lee soliton bag was made use of in qmc mechanism . through the nonlinear interaction of @xmath11-mesons and their coupling with quarks ,",
    "the later are automatically confined owning to the non - topological soliton bag solution of the system .",
    "the bag boundary is determined subsequently by the calculated quark density as a function of radius , rather than by a prior hypothesis . in the original work of friedberg and lee@xcite ,",
    "the treatment is temperature independent and ( baryon ) density invariant . as a result",
    ", the bag boundary does not vary in terms of these quantities . in order to achieve dynamical deconfinement ,",
    "it is quite intuitive to further introduce temperature and density dependence into the model .",
    "inspired by qmdd model , we retain the quark mass density dependence . while at finite temperature , temperature dependence gives rise to dynamical deconfinement phase transition .",
    "the resulting calculations@xcite-@xcite showed that the iqmdd model successfully describes the properties of nuclear matter , neutron stars and finite nuclei meanwhile it provides an intuitive scenario for quark deconfinement phase transition . in particular , the model gives a reasonable critical temperature of quark deconfinement@xcite , and one may carry out many - body calculations beyond mfa in principle .",
    "the main purpose of present work is to extend the above iqmdd model to study multi-@xmath0 matter and @xmath0 hypernuclei .",
    "since the original imqdd model includes only two flavors of quarks . in order to provide a reasonable description of nuclear system with strange degree of freedom , it is necessary to incorporate the strange quark into the model(see eqs.([mq1 ] ) and ( [ mq2 ] ) ) . in hadronic sector , hyperons are consisted of up , down and strange quarks .",
    "strange mesons consisting of strange quarks will also be introduced .",
    "the coupling constants between quarks and mesons in the model are essentially determined by the bulk properites of nuclear matter .",
    "once the parameters are given , they are used not only in the study of bulk strange hadronic matter , but also in that of @xmath0 hypernuclei . in this context , there is no free parameters in the calculations of @xmath0 hypernuclei , the validity of the model is therefore tested by an uniform parameterization . in this work ,",
    "the calculations are carried out at zero temperature .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we give the main formulas for strange nuclear matter and hypernuclei in the iqmdd model .",
    "numerical results and discussions are presented in section iii , calculations are carried out under the mfa . the last section contains a brief summary .",
    "the iqmdd model is extended in this section by including @xmath0 and @xmath1 hyperons in the system .",
    "an additional hyperon - hyperon ( y - y ) interaction is mediated by two strange mesons @xmath12 and @xmath13 which couple only to strange quarks , as proposed by schaffner et al .",
    "for simplicity , we assume that @xmath14s appear in the system in the same proportion as @xmath15s . since the system we considered is symmetric for nucleons and @xmath1s , there is no contribution from @xmath16 mesons .",
    "this is similar to the protons and neutrons in symmetric matter .",

    "now we come to the coupling constants concerning strange degree of freedom .",

    "one subsequently obtains @xmath116 using this coupling parameter , we obtain the theoretical energy of one single @xmath1 in symmetric nuclear matter , @xmath117= -13 mev , reasonably close to the experimental value -18 mev @xcite . since the @xmath12 and @xmath13 mesons couple only to the hyperons , it is reasonable in the quark model to set @xmath118 ( q = u , d ) .",

    "it will be therefore referred to as weak y - y interaction below .",
    "song et al .",
    "had some calculations on the potential depth in ref .",
    "we note that in our calculation we do not take into account the progress in the reanalysis of double lambda events @xcite .",
    "those reanalyses indicate that the potential depth of @xmath136 in the case of weak of y - y interaction may be even shallower than that 5 mev .",
    "first we discuss the saturation properties of the multi-@xmath0 strange nuclear matter with different ratios @xmath68 . some discussions on multi-@xmath137 matter in bulk can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite-@xcite . as usual",
    ", we subtract the baryon masses in the total energy per baryon of the strange matter given by eq.([etotal ] ) and study the binding energy per baryon expressed as @xmath138 the calculated results are summarized in figs . 1 - 2 .",
    "in fig.1 , we plotted the binding energy per baryon versus the baryon density for iqmdd model at different @xmath68 values .",
    "the minimum point of each curve corresponds to the stability point of strange hadronic matter . to study the stability of the system more transparently ,",
    "we present the minimum of @xmath139 versus strangeness fraction @xmath68 in fig.2 . from fig.2",
    ", one notes that e / b possesses negative minimum up to @xmath68 = 0.8 .",
    "it implies that systems containing up to @xmath140 lambdas will still be stable against particle decay . as @xmath68 increases , the saturation curve becomes deeper first and then goes shallower .",
    "the lowest minimum occurs around @xmath68 = 0.1 . compared to ordinary symmetric nuclear matter , strange hadronic matter with @xmath141",
    "has an additional binding energy of @xmath142 mev .",
    "the increase in binding energy is comparable to that in the modified qmc model , which is about 0.6 mev @xcite .",
    "fig.3 shows the effective baryon masses as a function of baryon density when they are in `` bath '' of bulk hadronic matter .",
    "curves with labels @xmath143 show results of symmetric ordinary nuclear matter , and those with lables @xmath144 give corresponding results of nucleon-@xmath0-@xmath1 mixture matter .",
    "the solid lines stand for nucleons , the dashed lines are for @xmath0s , and the dotted lines are for @xmath1s . in all cases ,",
    "the effective baryon masses drop down monotonously when nuclear density increases . as expected , the effective baryon masses satisfy the following order : @xmath145 is the largest , followed by @xmath146 and @xmath147 is the smallest .",
    "first , it is natural to understand the above mass ordering because the coupling between @xmath1 and @xmath11 meson is about one third of that between the nucleon and @xmath11 meson . as a result , for hadrons in `` bath '' of symmetric nuclear matter ,",
    "the @xmath1-@xmath148 coupling is weaker than the @xmath149 coupling . since the contributions from strange mesons are irrelevant in this case .",
    "one can see from fig.1 that the effective @xmath0 mass in the @xmath144 case is almost same as that in the case of @xmath143 . on the other hand , when strangeness fraction increases the effective nucleon mass increases significantly , while the effective @xmath1 mass decreases .",
    "this is a result of competition between the following two factors . in the first place , when the strangeness fraction increases ,",
    "the number of non - strange quarks becomes smaller , which supresses any hadron - hadron interaction mediated by the non - strange mesons .",
    "secondly , the number of s quark increases with strangeness fraction , and subsequently amplifies the hadron - hadron interaction mediated by the strange mesons . in case of nucleons , since it does not contain any strange quark , it is hardly affected by the second factor .",
    "therefore when the strangeness fraction increases , interaction between nucleons is suppressed , results in decreasement of its effective mass . on the contrary , since @xmath1 contains two strange quarks , its effective mass is essentially determined by the first factor .",
    "@xmath0 hyperon stays in the middle , the two effects are more or less balanced with one another in such a way that its effective mass is almost not affected by strangeness fraction .",
    "the calculated results of saturation properties of nucleon-@xmath0-@xmath1 mixture matter are summarized in figs .",
    "such systems consist of symmetric nuclear matter in equilibrim with @xmath0s and @xmath1s . due to the condition of chemical equilibrium , namely eq.([cheq2 ] ) , the particle density of @xmath0s and that of @xmath1s are not at all independent .",
    "given the values of @xmath52 and @xmath68 , particle densities of @xmath0s and @xmath1s are fully fixed by eqs.([cheq2 ] ) and ( [ dfs ] ) .    in fig.4 , we show the binding energy per baryon @xmath139 versus baryon density @xmath52 at various strangeness fractions @xmath68 calculated with weak y - y interaction . it is seen that the saturation curve gets shallower and shallower with increasing strangeness fraction @xmath68 . and there is no negative minimum in the saturation curve when @xmath68 value is larger than about 1.2 .",
    "the results indicate that the strange hadronic matter with the weak y - y interaction is less stable than the normal nuclear matter and becomes unstable when the @xmath68 is over 1.2 .",
    "we should emphasize that numerical calculations above are based on the experimental data of the weak y - y interaction . if we would like to investigate the influence of the strength of y - y interaction on the strange hadronic matter , it is necessary to investigate strange hadronic matter both with the strong y - y interaction and the weak y - y interaction . in fig.5 , the energy per baryon vs baryon density in the strange hadronic matter with various of @xmath68 calculated with a strong y - y interaction",
    "one can see that the situation in this case is very different from that of the weak y - y interaction case as shown in fig.4 .",
    "in general , strange hadronic matter is more stable than ordinary nuclear matter with strong y - y interaction .    to study the stability of the systems , we again minimize the @xmath139 with respect to @xmath52 at each strangeness fraction @xmath68 , and we present minimum of @xmath139 as a function of @xmath68 in fig.6 , and the corresponding @xmath52 are plotted in fig.7 .",
    "it is found that the minimum of energy per baryon calculated with the strong y - y interaction occurs at the point @xmath150 ( -21.5 mev , 1.5 ) .",
    "compared to the symmetric nuclear matter , the system gets an additional binding energy per baryon of about 6.5 mev .",
    "this is caused by the strong attraction between the @xmath1s .",
    "the corresponding saturation density in two cases are shown in fig.7 .",
    "again the difference between the strong and the weak y - y interactions manifested itself . from figs.6 - 7 , for the strong y - y interaction we can find that the most deeply bound state appears at baryon density @xmath151 @xmath101 and with strangeness fraction @xmath152 where @xmath1 dominates .",
    "however , if the @xmath0-@xmath0 interaction is weak , the strange hadronic matter with any strangeness fraction is even less stable than normal nuclear matter .",
    "the larger the strangeness fraction is , the less stable the system is .",
    "the minimized energy for given @xmath68 increases with increasing @xmath68 .",
    "there is no negative minimum when @xmath68 is larger than about 1.2 .    after showing the numerical results for strange hadronic matter ,",
    "it is interesting to perform the calculations self - consistently for @xmath0 hypernuclei in the iqmdd model without further adjusting the parameters . in fig.8",
    ", we show the effective masses of the nucleon and @xmath0 as well as the baryon densities calculated for ( a ) @xmath153o , ( b ) @xmath154ca and ( c ) @xmath155pb .",
    "the results are for the @xmath156 state , where effects of the @xmath0 hyperon on the whole system are expected to be the largest .",
    "the effective masses in the all three hypernuclei ( @xmath153o , @xmath154ca , @xmath157pb ) behave in a similar manner as the distance @xmath158 from the center of each nucleus increases ( the baryon density decreases ) .",
    "the calculated @xmath0 single - particle energies for the closed - shell core plus one @xmath0 configuration are listed in table . 1 .",
    "one can easily see that spin - orbit splittings in the present model are very small for all hypernuclei .",
    "its magnetude tends to be even smaller as the baryon density increases or the atomic number increases . in fig.9 ,",
    "we show single - particle energies of @xmath0 hyperon for these hypernuclei in the iqmdd model . in order to reduce finite size effects such as surface effect ,",
