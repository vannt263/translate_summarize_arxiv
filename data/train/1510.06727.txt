    "some of the most celebrated theorems in matroid theory are characterization theorems for specific classes of matroids .",
    "we could classify these theorems into two main categories : ( i ) _ excluded - minor _ theorems and ( ii ) _ decomposition _ theorems .",
    "excluded - minor theorems provide a list of forbidden minors for a class of matroids while decomposition theorems provide a set of operations which decompose matroids of a given class into main building blocks .",
    "a representative example would be the case of regular matroids where we have their excluded - minor characterization by tutte in  @xcite , as well as their decomposition by seymour in  @xcite .",
    "in general , decomposition theorems for matroids are more difficult to obtain than excluded - minor characterizations and have important implications , such as polynomial time recognition algorithms for the associated classes of matroids .",
    "there is a handful of recognition algorithms for matroids available , and these algorithms constitute the basic ingredient for recognizing classes of matrices representing these matroids .",
    "specifically , the recognition algorithm for graphic matroids by tutte in  @xcite provided the first practical and easily implementable polynomial - time recognition algorithm for network matrices  @xcite , while the recognition of regular matroids by seymour in  @xcite provided the only known polynomial - time recognition algorithm for totally unimodular matrices ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "both classes of matrices are considered to be very important for optimization and integer programming problems since they are associated with integral polyhedra .",
    "moreover , there is also the project by geelen , gerards and whittle  @xcite which is currently taking place , and it will generalize the graph minors theory developed by robertson and seymour , to representable matroids over finite fields . upon completion the results of this project would imply that for representable matroids over finite fields , we could test in polynomial time whether a given matroid contains another matroid as a minor .",
    "therefore we could say that in theory , an excluded - minor characterization for a class of representable matroids would imply the existence of a recognition algorithm for that class .",
    "however it is known from our experience with the graph minors theory , that even if the project is completed , it would be far from an actual recognition algorithm for any given matroid class , since the algorithmic obstacles would be most likely immense .    in this work",
    "we will provide a decomposition theorem for signed - graphic matroids which are representable over the quaternary field but not on the binary field . utilizing the results of pagano in  @xcite where he characterizes the signed graphic representations of quaternary matroids",
    ", we will provide structural results for such singed graphs , and based upon these we will develop the necessary ingredients that will form the decomposition characterization for the associated matroid class .",
    "this theorem generalizes previous decomposition theorems for binary signed - graphic matroids in  @xcite and graphic matroids in  @xcite .",
    "this work is organised as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we give some preliminaries mainly for signed graphs and the associated matroids along with some known decomposition results which are used in this work .",
    "after the prelimaries , the special structure of the signed graphs representing @xmath0-representable signed - graphic matroids along with extensions of the bridge theory for matrois are utilized in order to provide a characterization in terms of decomposition for the examined class of matroids .",
