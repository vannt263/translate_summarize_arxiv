    "dark matter is a non - luminous , non - baryonic , pervasive fluid extending in and around the bound astronomical systems like galaxy and galaxy clusters .",
    "this hypothetical proposition emerged from an attempt to reconcile astronomical observations with newtonian dynamics .",
    "indirect indications of existence of dark matter is perceived through their putative gravitational interactions in several cosmological observations like rotation curves of spiral galaxies , the gravitational micro - lensing , observations on virgo and coma clusters @xcite bullet clusters @xcite etc .",
    "these observations indicate the existence of roughly spherical halo of dark matter around the visible galaxies . most of the constituents of dark matter is believed to be non - relativistic ( cold dark matter ) with weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) as the plausible candidates .",
    "the direct detection of the dark matter in terrestrial detectors involves the scattering of the target nuclei in a detector when dark matter interacts with them .",
    "the resulting recoil nuclei deposit their energy in the detector to produce dark matter signal in the detector .",
    "dedicated detectors are operational in search of any non - gravitational interaction of dark matter with ordinary matter to provide more insight into the nature of dark matter and its interactions .",
    "the dynamics of rotation of the milky way galactic disc through the halo of dark matter causes the earth to experience a wind of wimps apparently flowing along a direction opposite to that of the motion of the solar system relative to the dark matter halo .",
    "there are several ongoing / proposed experimental efforts @xcite to directly detect these galactic wimps by measuring the energy deposition by the wimps through their scattering off the detector nuclei .",
    "unambiguous identification of a wimp signal is severely challenged by presence of similar background signatures .",
    "+ an annual modulation is expected @xcite in the detection rates of wimps in the direct detection experiments .",
    "this seasonal variation is an effect of earth s revolution around the sun in course of which the component of earth s orbital velocity parallel to the wimp flow direction annually varies causing the earth to encounter different wimp fluxes at different times of the year .",
    "but the relative motion between the sun and the earth is much slower compared to the motion of solar system in galactic halo . owing to this",
    ", the annual modulation is expected to be only a few percent of the wimp detection rate and it is extremely difficult to extricate it as a positive signature of dark matter from seasonal variation of background rates . on the contrary ,",
    "observation of directional anisotropy of the wimp wind on earth is a signature which can hardly be mimicked by any other backgrounds and is potentially more powerful in providing unambiguous signature of galactic wimps .",
    "there are dedicated experiments with gas detectors with a time projection chamber ( tpc ) ( drift @xcite , newage @xcite , mimac @xcite , dmtpc @xcite ) or organic crystals @xcite as detectors , aiming to measure the directional ( angular ) distribution of wimp induced nuclear recoils .",
    "the technique involved in the directional measurements is the 3-d or 2-d reconstruction of nuclear recoil tracks with a good spatial resolution followed by the determination of sense of the recoil direction ( discrimination between the head and tail of the recoil track ) .",
    "the directional distribution of the nuclear recoils which carries the imprints of incoming wimp directions can be exploited to disentangle wimp signals from backgrounds .. there is a plethora of papers where comprehensive studies of various aspects of directional detection of dark matter has been performed @xcite . however , because of earth s rotation about its axis which has a particular orientation relative to the direction of incoming wimps , the average direction of the wimp wind with respect to an observer fixed on earth , changes over a sidereal day .",
    "such modulations in the apparent wimp direction leads to daily fluctuations in the directional ( angular ) distribution of wimp signal observed at a static detector on earth .",
    "observation of such diurnal variations in the directional distribution of the wimp signal would be a robust signature for wimps @xcite . the directional dependence , however , is sensitive to the velocity distribution of wimps in the halo of dark matter . generally the dark matter halo is considered to be spherical and isothermal @xcite with the velocity distribution of dark matter wimps with respect to the galactic rest frame being maxwellian which is a steady state solution of the collisionless boltzmann equation @xcite .",
    "halo model dependence of the directional distribution has been extensively discussed in @xcite . + the directional sensitivity is usually realised and presented in terms of galactic coordinates where the description is independent of daily time . in order to comprehend the manifestation of directional sensitivity in the wimp signal as registered in the earth - bound detectors , it is essential to describe the directional dependence of recoil rates with respect to laboratory ( detector ) fixed coordinate system .",
    "the transformation from galactic frame to laboratory frame naturally invokes temporal variation in the directional description of wimp rates over a sidereal day . in this work",
    "we explicitly calculate the transformation between galactic and laboratory reference frames taking into account details of the earth - sun geometry and dynamics and compute the time dependence of the directional recoil rates in direction sensitive terrestrial dark matter experiments . in order to demonstrate the results of the directional rates calculations in the laboratory frame we assume the standard halo model of dark matter with a maxwellian velocity distribution for the wimps . + in a previous work @xcite",
    "also the authors have studied the diurnal variation of the direct detection of dark matter in directional experiments . in @xcite , they express the wimp velocity in a coordinate system where the polar axis ( @xmath0 ) is in the direction of recoiling nucleus . in the present work , however , the detector fixed coordinate systems are used and the directional detection rates are explicitly computed for two specific detectors . in this case",
    "the direction is specified by the direction of recoil nucleus with respect to this detector fixed system . for the study of diurnal variation in @xcite the orientation of a detector",
    "is specified in the local frame which is given by a specific point in the sky designated by the right ascension @xmath1 and declination @xmath2 . on the contrary , in the present work",
    "we explicitly show , for specific detectors , the actual variation of the wimp detection rates over a day for different recoil directions ( of the target nucleus ) with respect to the detector fixed frame of reference . + it is also worth investigating the impact if other halo model different from the usual standard halo model is used for these calculations .",
    "on the other hand , such investigations may be useful to probe the structure of dark matter halo from the results obtained in actual experiments . in this paper",
    "we consider another halo model namely dark disc model @xcite and compare the results with those obtained for standard galactic halo model .",
