    "we shall introduce definitions and quantifiers for genuine multipartite correlations by using the concepts reviewed in section [ subsec - gmc ] to generalize the measures discussed in section [ subsec - rebq ] .    from the definition given in section [ subsec - gmc ]",

    "it is also worthwhile to mention that , although we choose the relative entropy as a measure of distance , our quantifiers for correlation can be defined in a similar manner using other distance measures .    regarding total correlations",

    "this last quantifier , @xmath64 , can be applied to study the _ degree of correlation _ ( as defined in section [ subsec - gmc ] ) of a system and can find application , for instance , in the study of quantum phase transitions in critical systems @xcite .    based on the discussion about classically - correlated states and of the quantum correlation present in non - classical states , addressed in the introductory section , we propose the following definition .",

    "we will apply some of the quantifiers of genuine @xmath2-partite correlations introduced here to study the generation of genuine multipartite system - environment correlations in some decoherent dynamics .",

    "now these two sub - systems are let to interact locally with two independent environments in the vacuum state @xmath88 , where @xmath89 .",

    "we extend these results by studying the generation of genuine multipartite system - environment correlations .",

    "now , in order to get a better grasp of these results , let us look at the kind of state generated during the evolution of the system under different kinds of noise environment .",
    "it is straightforward to verify that if the system initial state is @xmath129 ( i.e. , if @xmath130 ) , the whole system state for amplitude - damping channels and @xmath131 is @xmath132 which is equivalent , modulo local rotations , to the well known four - qubit @xmath133 state @xcite . for phase noise environments and @xmath98",

    "see the text for details . ]    for any @xmath137 and @xmath109 , we obtain the following expressions for the fidelity , @xmath138 between these states and its corresponding evolved density operators : @xmath139 and @xmath140 these fidelities are shown in fig .",
    "[ fidelities ] .",
    "we also observe that the mutual information is invariant under local unitary transformations and , as one can easily verify , the genuine total correlations for the @xmath133 and @xmath135 states are given by : @xmath141 , @xmath142 , and @xmath143 .",
    "moreover , if we trace out a subsystem of a @xmath135 state , the obtained tripartite density operator has zero quantum correlations .",
    "the same action in a @xmath133 state produces a @xmath1-partite system possessing quantumness in its correlations .",
    "thus , the values of the fidelities ( shown in fig . [ fidelities ] ) and the structure of @xmath133 and @xmath135 states with respect to its correlations help us to partially explain the general behavior of the correlations that we presented and discussed in the last section . in reality , both kinds of decoherent dynamics generated genuine multipartite correlations .",
    "the main difference is that for the amplitude - damping channel these correlations are null for @xmath98 while for phase environments they generally reach its maximum value in this limit .",
    "thorough investigations about the decoherence process are essential for us to obtain a better understanding of the phenomenon per se and also for the development of methods to circumvent it in the path for large scale implementations of protocols in quantum information science . from the fundamental point of view , before 2010 one believed that the flow of coherent information from the system to the environment was caused by the creation of entanglement between the two .",
    "nevertheless , considering bipartite correlations , one of us and colleagues showed , in ref .",
    "[ 57 ] , that this is not the case in general . for some composite systems interacting with local - independent phase - damping channels ( or pauli channels ) , it was shown that the systems lose its initial coherent phase relations but only bipartite non - classical correlation of separable states are generated during such decoherent dynamics .",
    "another interesting finding reported in this article was the fact that the initial bipartite quantum correlation between the systems ( non - local , non - separable , and discordant ) evaporated , i.e. , only bipartite classical correlations was present at the asymptotic time of evolution . in the present manuscript , besides proposing definitions and introducing quantifiers for genuine multipartite correlations , we studied the many - body correlations generated for some important decoherent processes .",
    "our investigation extended the previous ones in several directions , helping us to understand the global structure of the states generated during these evolutions and also explaining why the bipartite quantum correlations disappeared in the asymptotic time , by showing that they are transformed into genuine multipartite correlations .",
    "moreover , we showed that the genuine multipartite total correlation may also exhibits a sudden change in its evolution rate .",
    "as continuation of the present work , besides the actual calculation of the genuine multipartite quantum correlations , other interesting topic for future research is considering the dynamics of such correlations for the composition of both phase and ( generalized ) amplitude channels , which is a common situation in nature @xcite .",
    "in this case , the global state generated during the evolution under local environments will be a mixture involving w and ghz components .",
    "the extension of these results for global and correlated environments @xcite and to continuous variables systems @xcite is also worth pursuing .",
    "it is also important to mention that the first experiment with complete tomography of the environment s state has been successfully performed recently using an optical system @xcite .",
