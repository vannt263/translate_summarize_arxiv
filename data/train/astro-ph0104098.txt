    "one of the first stars around which a planet candidate was found @xcite was @xmath1 coronae borealis ( hr  5968 = hd  143761 = hip  78459 ) .",
    "the discovery was based on the detection of a small periodic radial - velocity modulation , with an amplitude of 67 .",
    "the corresponding minimum mass of the unseen companion was found to be 1 jupiter mass ( =) , its actual mass depending on the orbital inclination .",
    "recently gatewood , han & black presented an analysis of the _ hipparcos _ intermediate data , together with new ground - based astrometry they obtained with the multichannel astrometric photometer @xcite .",
    "their analysis suggests an orbital semi - major axis of 1.5 ( = mas ) with an extremely small orbital inclination  0.5 , indicating that the secondary might be a late m star with a mass of @xmath2 .",
    "the extremely small orbital inclination makes this discovery intriguing , because the probability of a binary to have such a small angle , assuming an _ isotropic _ orientation in space , is extremely small  @xmath3 .",
    "even among 50 systems , the current number of planet candidates @xcite , the probability to find one system with such an extremely small inclination is only @xmath4 .",
    "therefore , the statistical significance of the  analysis , which might have implications beyond the study of , should be estimated carefully .",
    "recently , pourbaix studied the significance of the derived _ hipparcos _ orbits of many planet candidates , including .",
    "pourbaix fitted an orbit to the _ hipparcos _ data and checked the improvement in the fit resulting from the additional parameters , using an f - test .",
    "he used the f - distribution to assess the final significance level of the derived orbit , concluding that the significance is somewhat high  99 per cent .",
    "this use of the f - distribution assumes gaussianity of the individual measurements .",
    "we avoid this assumption by using the permutation test , which belongs to the class of distribution - free tests ( e.g. good 1994 ) and thus is more robust against modeling problems of the measurement process .",
    "we present in this paper an independent analysis of only the _ hipparcos _ astrometric data ( i.e. without the map data ) , with an emphasis on the assessment of the significance of the detection . on one hand , we show that the _ hipparcos _ data alone , together with the radial - velocity measurements of noyes et al . , yield , indeed , a small astrometric orbit of 1.5 mas , implying a small inclination for . on the other hand , we show that the statistical significance of this finding is only about @xmath0",
    ". therefore , we can expect about one system out of 40 to have shown a false astrometric orbit .",
    "section 2 presents our analysis , while section 3 discusses our finding .",
    "the present analysis used the 38 afoe radial velocities of   ( noyes et al . 1997 ; 1999 ) , together with the 42 astrometric measurements of _ hipparcos _",
    "@xcite , which were analysed by the fast and the ndac consortia @xcite .",
    "the spectroscopic and astrometric solutions have in common the following elements : the period , @xmath5 ; the time of periastron passage , @xmath6 ; the eccentricity , @xmath7 ; the longitude of the periastron , @xmath8 . in addition , the spectroscopic elements include the radial - velocity amplitude , @xmath9 , and the centre - of - mass radial velocity @xmath10 .",
    "the astrometric orbital elements include three additional elements  the angular semi - major axis of the photocentre , @xmath11 ; the inclination , @xmath12 ; the longitude of the nodes , @xmath13 .",
    "in addition , the astrometric solution includes the five regular astrometric parameters  the parallax , the position ( in right ascension and declination ) and the proper motion ( in right ascension and declination ) .",
    "all together we had a 14-parameter model to fit to the spectroscopic and astrometric data .",
    "note that we have allowed small corrections to the values of the _ hipparcos _ reference solution of the five regular astrometric parameters .",
    "these 14 elements are not all independent . from @xmath9 , @xmath5 and",
    "@xmath7 we can derive the projected semi - major axis of the primary orbit ",
    "@xmath14 , in physical units .",
    "this element , together with the inclination @xmath12 and the parallax , yields the angular semi - major axis of the primary , @xmath15 . assuming the secondary contribution to the total light of the system is negligible ,",
    "this is equal to the observed @xmath11 .",
    "the results of our fit , which are consistent with the previous orbital solutions ( noyes et al .",
    "1997 , 1999 ; gatewood et al .",
    "2001 ) , are given in table [ table1 ] .",
    "the small semi - major axis implies a secondary mass of @xmath16 where we assumed 1  for the primary @xcite .",
    "lcl @xmath5 & @xmath17 & days + @xmath9 & @xmath18 &   + @xmath7 & @xmath19 & + @xmath6 & @xmath20 & hjd + @xmath8 & @xmath21 & + @xmath10 & @xmath22 &   + @xmath23 & @xmath24 & @xmath25au +   + @xmath12 & @xmath26 & + @xmath13 & @xmath27 & + @xmath11 & @xmath28 &   + parallax & @xmath29 &   +      the semi - major axis of the derived astrometric orbit is @xmath30 mas . a very small semi - major axis could have been falsely `` detected '' even without any real astrometric motion , due to the scatter of the actual measurements @xcite . to find out if this is the case here we performed a `` permutation '' test ( e.g. , good 1994 ) by generating simulated data from the very same astrometric measurements of .",
    "if there is some evidence of an orbit in the measurements , it should be ruined by the permutation . however ,",
    "if the derived orbit is spurious , some random permutations should be able to reproduce a similar effect . in a sense",
    ", we let the data `` speak for themselves '' and do not have to assume any specific distribution for the measurements .",
    "we used the iad _ hipparcos _ measurements @xcite and permuted the actual timing of the observations , modifying the partial derivatives with respect to the five astrometric parameters @xcite accordingly .",
    "we then analysed the permuted astrometric data together with the actual radial velocities , deriving a new false astrometric orbit .    for most of the original measurements",
    "there are two stellar positions , one derived from the ndac and the other from the fast consortia . the two positions are , obviously , not independent , but have an assigned non - vanishing correlation . in our permutation",
    "we kept the pairing of the corresponding ndac and fast positions , while permuting the timings among the pairs .",
    "this turned out to be a nontrivial exercise , and caused us to falsely assign a higher significance to the astrometric detection in an early phase of this study .",
    "a histogram of the falsely detected semi - major axes , derived from the `` simulated '' permuted data , is presented in figure [ figure1 ] .",
    "we see that most of the artificially detected semi - major axes are at the range of 0.51.0 mas , with a small distribution tail beyond 1.5 mas . in 2,000 random permutations we got 46 astrometric solutions with semi - major axis larger than 1.5 .",
    "this indicates that the detection significance is at the level of 0.977 , which is about @xmath0 .",
    "the analysis presented here shows that on average we expect about one out of 40 systems with a similar dataset to  to show a false astrometric orbit with @xmath31 mas .",
    "this implies that the statistical significance of the claimed astrometric orbit is not high enough at this point of the research .",
    "as explained in the introduction , pourbaix derived that the significance of the astrometric solution is at the 99 per cent level . compared to his technique",
    "we use a distribution - free analysis and thus we feel that our assertion , of a 97.7 per cent level , is more justified .    one way to find out the true nature of the secondary of  is to try and observe the secondary directly .",
    "if the secondary is indeed a stellar object , infrared spectroscopic observations , especially when analysed with todcor  a two - dimensional correlation technique @xcite , should detect some trace of the faint secondary ( e.g. , mazeh et al .",
    "2000a ) . together with m. simon and l. prato",
    ", we plan such observations in the near future .",
    "obviously , more precise astrometric measurements , expected to come in the future from the fame @xcite , sim @xcite , diva @xcite and gaia @xcite missions , will enable us to derive the secondary mass much more accurately .",
    "we turn now to discuss the relatively low metallicity of .",
    "it was noted by many workers ( gonzalez 1997 ; marcy & butler 1998 ; queloz et al .",
    "2000 ; gonzalez 2001 ; butler et al . 2000 ) that most stars that were found to harbor planet candidates exhibit metallicities higher than the typical metallicity of the solar neighborhood .",
    "queloz et al . and butler et al .",
    "further pointed out that the host stars to the `` 51 peg like '' planets are particularly metal rich .",
    "mazeh & zucker suggested a probable decrease of the stellar metallicity as a function of the orbital period of the planet candidates , a dependence which holds , according to their suggestion , up to about 100 days .",
    "to study their suggestion we plot in figure [ figure2 ] the metallicity as a function of the planet orbital period , for the stars that appear in the extra solar planets encyclopedia web site as of september 2000 @xcite .",
    "we follow the mazeh & zucker suggestion and therefore include in the figure only planet candidates with periods shorter than 100 days .",
    "whenever available we have used metallicities derived from spectral analysis , mostly from the seminal work of gonzalez .",
    "mazeh et al .",
    "derived the metallicity of hd  209458 .",
    "whenever such an analysis was not available , we have used the photometric metallicity derived by gimnez .",
    "the metallicities of the stars not considered by gimnez were derived by us following his prescription , based on the photometry of hauck & mermilliod and the calibrations calculated by crawford and olsen .    in this figure",
    "has one of the lowest metallicities .",
    "the analysis presented here , which does not support the conjecture about the stellar nature of the companion of , strengthens the suggestion that the metallicity might depend on the period .",
    "the figure draws attention to the other two low - metallicity planet candidates .",
    "the extreme one is hd  114762 ( latham et al . 1989 ; mazeh , latham & stefanik 1996 ) with a metallicity of about @xmath320.60 . the nature of this secondary is not clear because it has a minimum mass of about 10 , and even a moderate inclination can turn it into a brown - dwarf or stellar secondary .",
    "however , the other one is hd  6434 @xcite , with a minimum mass of 0.5 .",
    "this small minimum mass renders the conjecture that this is a real planet safe .",
    "therefore , even if the secondary of hd  114762 turns out to be stellar , the dependence of the metallicity on the period might still be real .",
    "we are indebted to r. noyes for many seminal suggestions , which led to substantial improvement of this study .",
    "m. simon is thanked for his wise advise .",
    "this work was supported by the us - israel binational science foundation through grant 97 - 00460 and the israeli science foundation ( grant no ."
