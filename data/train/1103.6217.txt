    "one of the best motivated extensions of the standard model consists of introducing extra fermions that are singlets under the standard model gauge group , which we will call for definiteness right - handed ( rh ) neutrinos . with this particle content",
    ", the lagrangian contains a yukawa coupling of the rh neutrinos with the left - handed leptonic doublets and the higgs doublet , which leads to a dirac neutrino mass when the electroweak symmetry is spontaneously broken .",
    "besides , it contains a majorana mass term for the rh neutrinos , which is a priori unrelated to the electroweak symmetry breaking scale .",
    "the most popular scenario in this model consists on assuming that the rh neutrino majorana mass scale is much larger than the electroweak symmetry breaking scale , thus naturally leading to tiny majorana neutrino masses through the renowned see - saw mechanism  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , any other low energy effect of the rh neutrinos decouples at least with their mass squared , resulting in a tiny rate for the rare leptonic decays  @xcite , a tiny leptonic electric dipole moment  @xcite and a tiny deviation of the electroweak observables from the standard model predictions  @xcite , in excellent agreement with presently existing experimental data .",
    "it should be borne in mind , however , that the mass of the rh neutrinos is a free parameter which can take any value between zero and the planck scale .",
    "an interesting possibility arises when the rh neutrinos have masses in the range @xmath2 gev .",
    "if this is the case , the new particles could be produced and detected at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) , if their couplings to the standard model particles are sizable  @xcite .",
    "this situation , at first sight bizarre in view of the tininess of the neutrino masses , can be realized in some well motivated scenarios , namely when lepton number is approximately conserved ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "more importantly , the contributions from the new particles to the low energy phenomena are no longer suppressed , opening the possibility of finding additional low energy signatures of the new physics with experiments at the intensity frontier .",
    "furthermore , the existence of rh neutrinos with masses in the range of @xmath3 gev with lepton number violating interactions can dramatically enhance the rate of neutrinoless double beta decay  @xcite , inducing rates that could possibly be observable at gerda  @xcite , even when the light neutrinos present a normal hierarchical mass spectrum .    in this paper",
    "we analyze the constraints from various experiments on the scenario where the rh neutrinos are accessible to collider searches , as well as the interrelation between the different constraints .",
    "more specifically , we will derive the constraints that follow from the present bounds on the rate of the process @xmath4 , with a special emphasis on the relation to the neutrino mixing and oscillation parameters .",
    "we will also discuss the prospects to observe neutrinoless double beta decay in the next round of experiments , in the view of all present experimental constraints . in section 2",
    "we discuss the formalism and define the parameter space of the theory . in sections 3 and 4",
    "we discuss the constraints on the parameter space which arise from radiative charged lepton decays and the implications for collider searches and electroweak precision observables .",
    "in the subsequent section we perform a detailed analysis of the possible enhancement of the neutrinoless double beta decay rate due to the exchange of the heavy ( rh ) majorana neutrinos . in section 6",
    "we combine the constraints on the parameter space that we obtained in sections 3 , 4 and 5 . finally , we report our conclusions .",
    "we denote the light and heavy majorana neutrinos with definite masses as @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "the charged and neutral current weak interactions involving the light majorana neutrinos have the form : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the pontecorvo , maki , nakagawa , sakata ( pmns ) neutrino mixing matrix @xcite , @xmath9 is a @xmath10 unitary matrix which diagonalises the majorana mass matrix of the left - handed ( lh ) flavour neutrinos @xmath11 ( generated by the see - saw mechanism ) , and the matrix @xmath12 characterises the deviations from unitarity of the pmns matrix . the elements of @xmath13 are determined in experiments studying the oscillations of the flavour neutrinos and antineutrinos , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , @xmath16 , at relatively low energies . in these experiments",
    "the initial states of the flavour neutrinos , produced in some weak process , are coherent superpositions of the states of the light massive majorana neutrino @xmath5 only .",
    "the states of the heavy majorana neutrino @xmath17 are not present in the superpositions representing the initial flavour neutrino states and this leads to deviations from unitarity of the pmns matrix .",

    "these constraints read @xcite : @xmath31 the elements of the matrix rv and the masses @xmath32 of the heavy majorana neutrinos @xmath6 should satisfy the approximate constraint on the elements of the majorana mass matrix of the lh flavour neutrinos @xcite , @xmath33 ev , @xmath34 . in the case of the type i see - saw mechanism under discussion this implies : @xmath35 this relation can be satisfied in several situations . the most trivial way to satisfy it",
    "is by imposing that @xmath36 for all @xmath37 and @xmath38 , which renders the observation of all rh neutrinos impossible at the lhc or in any low energy phenomena .",
    "however , this relation can also be fulfilled if one element of the matrix @xmath39 is sizable .",
    "this requires the existence of at least another large matrix element , in order to cancel the large contribution of the former one in eq .",
    "( [ vr1 ] ) . whereas the possibility of cancellations between three different terms can not be precluded , in the simplest case only two terms",

    ", in order not to spoil the cancellation between these two terms , the contribution from the third neutrino to eq .",
    "( [ vr1 ] ) should be negligible .",
    "therefore in what follows we will work for simplicity in the @xmath45 see - saw scenario , in which the indicated cc and nc weak interaction couplings of @xmath46 are set to zero and @xmath46 is decoupled . in this case",
    "the sm is effectively extended by the addition of 2 rh neutrino fields only . in this class of models ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) one of the three light ( majorana ) neutrinos is massless and hence the neutrino mass spectrum is hierarchical .",
    "two possible types of hierarchical spectrum are allowed by the current neutrino data ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) : @xmath47 normal hierarchical ( nh ) , @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 , where @xmath51 and @xmath52 ; + @xmath53 inverted hierarchical ( ih ) , @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 , where @xmath51 and @xmath57 . in both cases we have : @xmath58 .",
    "the two heavy neutrino fields satisfy the majorana condition : @xmath59 , @xmath60 .",

    "one can show , however , that we get the same results for the observables of interest to this study in the two cases .",
    "therefore in what follows we shall work with @xmath61 .",
    "we assume that the heavy rh neutrinos @xmath65 have masses in the range @xmath66 gev , which makes possible , in principle , their production , e.g. , at lhc . in order to be produced with observable rates at lhc , the cc and nc couplings of @xmath67 and @xmath42 in eqs .",
    "( [ ncc ] ) and ( [ nnc ] ) have to be sufficiently large . under this condition",
    "the existing experimental upper bounds on the neutrinoless double beta ( ) decay rate put stringent constraints on the mass spectrum of the rh neutrinos . it can be shown @xcite , in particular , that in the type i see - saw scenario of interest the two heavy ( rh ) majorana neutrinos @xmath65 must be almost degenerate in mass : @xmath68 . if we assume that @xmath69 and @xmath70 , @xmath71 , in order to satisfy the experimental limit on the -decay rate , one should have @xmath72 ( @xmath73 ) for @xmath74 ( @xmath75 ) gev @xcite .",
    "the charged current and the neutral current weak interaction couplings of the heavy majorana neutrinos @xmath17 , @xmath76 , are furthermore constrained by the requirement of reproducing the correct low energy neutrino oscillation parameters after the decoupling of the heavy degrees of freedom .",
    "remarkably , under the condition that @xmath77 are sufficiently large to produce observable effects of the rh neutrinos at low energies , these couplings take a very simple form @xcite .",

    "the dirac neutrino mass matrix can be decomposed accordingly as @xmath86 , in a self - explanatory notation .",

    "the neutrino yukawa coupling takes values @xmath248 . the correlation between @xmath176 and @xmath232 reported in eq .",
    "( [ bmeg ] ) is satisfied for values @xmath249 .",
    "this is in agreement with figs .",
    "[ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] , where it is shown that a signal compatible with the gerda sensitivity reach is possible , provided @xmath250 , for both types of neutrino mass spectrum .",
    "moreover , in the case of ih light neutrino mass spectrum , such correlation depends strongly on the value of the majorana phase @xmath151 .",
    "indeed , for @xmath251 gev and @xmath252 we expect that the meg experiment @xcite is able to measure the @xmath124 decay rate ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) . if lepton flavour violation is discovered by meg , according to eqs .",
    "( [ mee3 ] ) and ( [ ue21ih ] ) , a positive signal detected by gerda ii , @xmath230 @xmath253 ev , implies : @xmath254 . in the case of @xmath220 gev and @xmath223 ,",
    "used to obtain fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , we would expect , in general , positive signals to be observed in both meg and gerda ii experiments if @xmath255 ; in the case of @xmath256 , the @xmath229 and @xmath235 decays are predicted to proceed with rates below the sensitivity of these two experiments .",
    "we note , however , that it is not possible to get independent constraints on the degeneracy parameter @xmath226 and the majorana phase from the data on @xmath229 and @xmath235 decays . finally , we notice also that the strong correlation exhibited in fig .  [ fig6 ] is a consequence of the constraints imposed by the neutrino oscillation data on the type i see - saw parameter space in the case investigated by us .",
    "we have analyzed the low energy implications of a type i see - saw scenario with right - handed ( rh ) neutrino masses at the electroweak scale and sizable charged and neutral current weak interactions .",
    "this class of scenarios have the attractive feature that the rh neutrinos could be directly produced at the large hadron collider , thus allowing to test in collider experiments the mechanism of neutrino mass generation .",
    "furthermore , and in contrast to the high - scale see - saw mechanism , the rates for the rare leptonic decays are unsuppressed in this scenario , which opens up the possibility of detecting signatures of new physics with experiments at the intensity frontier .",
    "present low energy data set very stringent constraints on this scenario .",
    "namely , reproducing the small neutrino masses requires , barring cancellations , that two of the heavy rh neutrinos must form a pseudo - dirac pair even in the case when there is no conserved lepton charge in the limit of zero splitting at tree level between the masses of the pair . besides , reproducing the experimentally determined values of the low energy neutrino oscillation parameters ( mixing angles and neutrino mass squared differences ) fixes the weak charged current ( cc ) and neutral current ( nc ) couplings of the heavy majorana neutrinos to the charged leptons and @xmath28 and light neutrinos and @xmath257 , @xmath76 ( see eqs .",
    "( [ ncc ] ) and ( [ nnc ] ) ) , up to an overall scale which can be related to the largest eigenvalue @xmath110 of the matrix of neutrino yukawa couplings .",
    "this allows to derive explicit expressions for the rates of the lepton flavour violating ( lfv ) charged lepton radiative decays , @xmath123 , @xmath258 , @xmath259 , in terms of the low energy ( in principle measurable ) neutrino mixing parameters ( including the dirac and majorana cp violating phases ) , the neutrino yukawa coupling @xmath110 and the rh neutrino mass scale . using the present constraint on the rate of the process @xmath123",
    "we have obtained an upper bound on the coupling @xmath110 under the assumption that the rh neutrino mass scale is in the range ( @xmath260 ) gev .",
    "our analysis shows that the restrictions on this scenario from the data on the neutrino mixing parameters and the upper bound on the @xmath123 decay rate imply that the cc and nc couplings @xmath77 of the heavy rh majorana neutrinos are too small to allow their production at the lhc with an observable rate .",
    "other lepton flavour violating processes , such as @xmath261 conversion in nuclei , give complementary constraints on the parameter space of this model , which will be discussed elsewhere @xcite .",
    "we have also analyzed the enhancement of the rate of neutrinoless double beta ( @xmath229- ) decay induced by the rh neutrinos .",
    "we have shown that even after imposing the restrictions on the parameter space implied by the data on the neutrino oscillation parameters and on the lfv charged lepton radiative decays , the contribution due to the exchange of the rh neutrinos in the @xmath229-decay amplitude can substantially enhance the @xmath229-decay rate . as a consequence",
    ", the latter can be in the range of sensitivity of the gerda experiment even when the light neutrinos possess a normal hierarchical mass spectrum .",
    "finally , the rate of the @xmath1 decay , generated by the exchange of the heavy rh neutrinos can naturally be within the sensitivity of the meg experiment .",
    "thus , the observation of @xmath229-decay in the next generation of experiments which are under preparation at present , and of the @xmath1 decay in the meg experiment , could be the first indirect evidence for the tev scale type i see - saw mechanism of neutrino mass generation .",
