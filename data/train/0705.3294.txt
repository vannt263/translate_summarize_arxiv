    "this paper presents a series of numerical studies which investigate the use of shear in the production of chaos .",
    "the phenomenon in question can be described roughly as follows : an external force is applied to a system with tame , nonchaotic dynamics .",
    "if the forcing is strategically applied to interact with the shearing in the underlying dynamics , it can sometimes lead to the folding of phase space , which can in turn lead to positive lyapunov exponents for a large set of initial conditions .",
    "this phenomenon , which we call _ shear - induced chaos _",
    ", occurs in a wide variety of settings , including periodically - forced oscillators . for a topic as general as this ,",
    "it is difficult to compile a reasonable set of references .",
    "we have not attempted to do that , but mention that the first known observation of a form of this phenomenon was by van der pol and van der mark 80 years ago @xcite .",
    "other references related to our work will be mentioned as we go along .",
    "the starting point of the present work is a series of papers by wang and young @xcite . in these papers ,",
    "the authors devised a method for proving the existence of strange attractors and applied their techniques to some natural settings ; two of their main examples are periodically - kicked oscillators and systems undergoing hopf bifurcations .",
    "they identified a simple geometric mechanism to explain how the chaotic behavior comes about .",
    "because of the perturbative nature of their analysis , however , the kicks in these results have to be followed by very long periods of relaxation .",
    "in other words , the chaos in these attractors develop on a very slow time scale .",
    "relevant parts of the results of wang and young are reviewed in sect .",
    "[ wang - young ] .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to study shear - induced chaos in situations not accessible by current analytic tools .",
    "we believe that this phenomenon is widespread , meaning it occurs for large sets of parameters , and that it is robust , meaning it does not depend sensitively on the type of forcing or even background dynamics as long as certain geometric conditions are met .",
    "we validate these ideas through a series of numerical studies in which suitable parameters are systematically identified following ideas from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "four separate studies are described in sects .",
    "[ study1]  [ study4 ] .",
    "the first three studies involve an oscillator driven by different types of forcing ( both deterministic and stochastic ) ; in these studies , the unforced system is a simple linear shear flow model . in the fourth study ,",
    "the unforced dynamics are that of a coupled oscillator system described by a ( periodic or quasi - periodic ) flow on the @xmath0-torus .",
    "the linear shear flow used in studies 13 has been studied independently in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it is the simplest system known to us that captures all the essential features of typical oscillator models relevant to shear - induced chaos .",
    "moreover , these features appear in the system in a way that is easy to control , and the effects of varying each are easy to separate .",
    "this facilitates the interpretation of our theoretical findings in more general settings in spite of the fact that numerical studies necessarily involve specific models .",
    "we mention that our results on shear flows are potentially applicable to a setting not discussed here , namely that of the advection and mixing of passive scalar tracers in ( weakly compressible ) flows .",
    "finally , we remark that this work exploits the interplay between deterministic and stochastic dynamics in the following way : the geometry in deterministic models are generally more clear - cut .",
    "it enables us to extract more readily the relationship between quantities and to deduce the type of results these relationships may lead .",
    "results for stochastic models , on the other hand , tend to be more _ provable _ than their counterparts in deterministic models , where competing scenarios lead to very delicate dependences on parameters . our numerical results on stochastic forcing in studies 24 point clearly to the possibility of ( rigorous ) theorems , some versions of which",
    ", we hope , will be proved in the not too distant future .",
    "in this section , we review some rigorous results of wang and young ( mainly @xcite , also @xcite ) and the geometric mechanism for producing chaos identified in the first two of these papers .",
    "we will focus on the case of limit cycles , leaving the slightly more delicate case of supercritical hopf bifurcations to the reader . the material summarized in this section form the starting point for the numerical investigations in the present paper .      consider a smooth flow @xmath1 on a finite dimensional riemannian manifold @xmath2 ( which can be @xmath3 ) , and let @xmath4 be a",
    "_ hyperbolic limit cycle _ , _ i.e. _ @xmath4 is a periodic orbit of @xmath1 with the property that if we linearize the flow along @xmath4 , all of the eigenvalues associated with directions transverse to @xmath4 have strictly negative real parts .",
    "the _ basin of attraction _ of @xmath4 , @xmath5 , is the set @xmath6 .",
    "it is well known that hyperbolic limit cycles are robust , meaning small perturbations of the flow will not change its dynamical picture qualitatively .",
    "a _ periodically - kicked oscillator _ is a system in which  kicks \" are applied at periodic time intervals to a flow @xmath1 with a hyperbolic limit cycle .",
    "for now let us think of a  kick \" as a mapping @xmath7 .",
    "if kicks are applied @xmath8 units of time apart , then the time evolution of the kicked system can be captured by iterating its time-@xmath8 map @xmath9 . if there is a neighborhood @xmath10 of @xmath4 such that @xmath11 , and the relaxation time is long enough that points in @xmath12 return to @xmath10 , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath13 , then @xmath14 is an attractor for the periodically kicked system @xmath15 . in a sense",
    ", @xmath16 is what becomes of the limit cycle @xmath4 when the oscillator is periodically kicked .",
    "since hyperbolic limit cycles are robust , @xmath17 is a slightly perturbed copy of @xmath4 if the kicks are weak .",

    "i.e. _ , when the dynamics in @xmath10 exhibit sustained , observable chaos .",
    "two theorems are stated below .",
    "theorem 1 is an abstract result , the purpose of which is to emphasize the generality of the phenomenon .",
    "theorem 2 discusses a concrete situation intended to make transparent the relevance of certain quantities .",
    "let leb@xmath18 denote the lebesgue measure of a set .",
    "@xcite let @xmath1 be a @xmath19 flow with a hyperbolic limit cycle @xmath4 .",
    "then there is an open set of kick maps @xmath20 with the following properties : for each @xmath21 , there is a set @xmath22 with leb@xmath23 such that for each @xmath24 , @xmath17 is a `` strange attractor '' of @xmath15 .",
    "the term `` strange attractor '' in the theorem has a well - defined mathematical meaning , which we will discuss shortly . but first let us take note of the fact that this result applies to all systems with hyperbolic limit cycles , independent of dimension or other specifics of the defining equations .",
    "second , we remark that the kicks in this theorem are very infrequent , _ i.e. _ @xmath25 , and that beyond a certain @xmath26 , the set @xmath27 is roughly periodic with the same period as the cycle @xmath4 .",
    "the term `` strange attractor '' in theorem 1 is used as short - hand for an attractor with a package of well defined dynamical properties .",
    "these properties were established for a class of rank - one attractors ( see @xcite for the 2-dimensional case ; a preprint for the @xmath28-dimensional case will appear shortly ) .",
    "in @xcite , the authors identified a set of conditions that implies the existence of such attractors , and the verification of the conditions in @xcite in the context of theorem 1 is carried out in @xcite ( see also @xcite and @xcite for other applications of these ideas ) .",
    "we refer the reader to the cited papers for more details , and mention only the following three characteristics implied by the term  strange attractor \" in this section .",
    "* there is a set @xmath29 of full lebesgue measure in the basin of attraction of @xmath17 such that orbits starting from every @xmath30 have ( strictly ) positive lyapunov exponents .",

    "this is more a reflection of reality than a weakness of the result .",
    "for large enough @xmath8 in the complement of @xmath27 , the attractor is guaranteed to contain horseshoes , the presence of which will lead to some semblance of chaotic behavior . after a transient , however , typical orbits may ( or may not ) tend to a stable equilibrium . if they do , we say @xmath15 has _",
    "transient chaos_. this is to be contrasted with properties ( 1)(3 ) above , which represent a much stronger form of chaos .",
    "the next result has an obvious analog in @xmath28-dimensions ( see @xcite ) , but the 2-d version illustrates the point .",
    "@xcite consider the system @xmath35 where @xmath36 are coordinates in the phase space , @xmath37 are constants , and @xmath38 is a nonconstant smooth function . if the quantity @xmath39 is sufficiently large ( how large depends on the forcing function @xmath40 ) , then there is a positive measure set @xmath41 such that for all @xmath24 , @xmath15 has a strange attractor in the sense above .        [ shear ]    here",
    ", the term involving @xmath42 defines the kick , and @xmath43 .",
    "we explain intuitively the significance of the quantity @xmath44 .",
    "as noted earlier , to create a strange attractor , it is necessary to `` break '' the limit cycle .",
    "the more strongly attractive @xmath4 is , the harder it is to break . from this",
    "we see the advantage of having @xmath45 small . by the same token , a stronger forcing , _",
    "i.e. _ , larger @xmath46 , helps .",
    "the role of @xmath47 , the _ shear _ , is explained pictorially in fig .",
    "[ shear ] : since the function @xmath40 is required to be nonconstant , let us assume the kick drives some points on the limit cycle @xmath4 up and some down , as shown .",
    "the fact that @xmath47 is positive means that points with larger @xmath48-coordinates move faster in the @xmath49-direction . during the relaxation period ,",
    "the `` bumps '' created by the kick are stretched as depicted . at the same time , the curve is attracted back to the limit cycle .",
    "thus , the combination of kicks and relaxation provides a natural mechanism for repeated stretching and folding of the limit cycle .",
    "observe that the larger the differential in speed in the @xmath49-direction , _ i.e. _ the larger @xmath47 , and the slower the return to @xmath4 , _",

    "( [ thm2 ] ) ?",
    "the aim of this subsection is to shed light on the general geometric picture , and to explain how the dynamics of @xmath15 for large @xmath8 can be understood .",

    "we assume @xmath61 is kicked upward with its end points held fixed , and assume @xmath65 for some @xmath66 ( otherwise the picture is shifted to another part of @xmath4 but is qualitatively similar ) .",
    "since @xmath62 leaves each @xmath64-manifold invariant , we may imagine that during relaxation , the flow `` slides '' each point of the curve @xmath67 back toward @xmath4 along @xmath64-leaves . in the situation",
    "depicted , the effect of the folding is evident .    fig .  [ wss ] gives considerable insight into what types of kicks are conducive to the formation of strange attractors .",
    "kicks along @xmath64-leaves or in directions roughly parallel to the @xmath64-leaves will not produce strange attractors , nor will kicks that essentially carry one @xmath64-leaf to another .",
    "what causes the stretching and folding is the _ variation _ in how far points @xmath68 are moved by @xmath63 as measured in the direction transverse to the @xmath64-leaves . without attempting to give a more precise characterization , we will refer to the type of chaos that results from the geometry above as _ shear - induced chaos_. we emphasize that the occurrence of shear - induced chaos relies on the interplay between the geometries of the kicks and the underlying dynamical structures .",
    "returning to the concrete situation of theorem 2 , since eq .",
    "( [ thm2 ] ) without the kick term is linear , it is easy to compute strong stable manifolds . in @xmath69-coordinates , they are lines with slope @xmath70 .",
    "variations in kick distances here are guaranteed by the fact that @xmath40 is nonconstant . with",
    "@xmath40 fixed , it is clear that the larger @xmath71 and @xmath46 , the greater these variations .",
    "note that the use of the word kick  amplitude \" in the statement of theorem 2 is a little misleading , for it is not the amplitude of the kicks _ per se _ that leads to the production of chaos .      when @xmath73 , _ i.e.",
    "_ when kicks are very infrequent , the map @xmath15 sends a small tube @xmath74 around @xmath4 back into itself .",

    "rank - one maps can be analyzed using perturbative methods if they have well - defined `` singular limits . '' in the context of limit cycles , these singular limits do exist ; they are a one - parameter family of maps @xmath75 obtained by letting @xmath76 in the following way : for each @xmath77 ( recall that @xmath78 ) , let @xmath79 equivalently , @xmath80 is the unique point @xmath81 such that @xmath82 .",

    "these are the two known competing scenarios .",

    "the largest lyapunov exponent of @xmath15 may appear positive for some time ( which can be arbitrarily long ) before turning negative .",
    "in the second case , it stays positive indefinitely .",
    "in hyperbolic theory , there is , at the present time , a very large discrepancy between what is thought to be true and what can be proved .",
    "maps that are dominated by stretch - and - fold behavior are generally thought to have positive lyapunov exponents ",
    "although this reasoning is also known to come with the following caveat : maps whose derivatives expand in certain directions tend to contract in other directions , and unless the expanding and contracting directions are well separated ( such as in anosov systems ) , the contractive directions can conspire to form sinks .",
    "this is how the transient chaos described in sect .",
    "1.2 comes about .",
    "still , if the expansion is sufficiently strong , one would expect that positive lyapunov exponents are more likely to prevail  even though for any one map the outcome can go either way .",
    "_ proving _ results of this type is a different matter .",
    "few rigorous results exist for systems for which one has no _ a priori _ knowledge of invariant cones , and invariant cones are unlikely in shear - induced chaos .",
    "the rigorous results reviewed in the last two subsections have the following limitations : ( i ) they pertain to @xmath15 for only very large @xmath8 .",
    "this is because the authors use a perturbative theory that leans heavily on the theory of 1-d maps .",
    "no non - perturbative analytic tools are currently available .",
    "( ii ) a larger than necessary amount of expansion is required of the singular limit maps @xmath85 in the proof of strange attractors .",
    "this has to do with the difficulty in locating suitable parameters called misiurewicz points from which to perturb .",
    "( this problem can be taken care of , however , by introducing more parameters . )",
    "we point out that ( i ) and ( ii ) together exacerbate the problem : @xmath85 is more expanding when @xmath45 is small , but if @xmath88 is to be near its singular limit , then @xmath89 must be very small , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath90 must be very large .    that brings us to the present paper , the purpose of which is to supply numerical evidence to support some of our conjectured ideas regarding situations beyond the reach of the rigorous work reviewed .",
    "our ideas are based on the geometry outlined in sect .",
    "[ sec1.2 ] , but are not limited to periodic kicks or to the folding of limit cycles .",

    "shear - induced chaos , by which we refer to the phenomenon of an external force interacting with the shearing in a system to produce stretches and folds , is found to occur for wide ranges of parameters in forced oscillators and quasi - periodic systems .",
    "highlights of our results include :    * for periodically kicked oscillators , positive lyapunov exponents are observed under quite modest impositions on the unforced system and on the relaxation time between kicks ( in contrast to existing rigorous results ) .",
    "these regimes are , as expected , interspersed with those of transient chaos in parameter space . *",
    "continuous - time stochastic forcing is shown to be equally effective in producing chaos .",
    "the qualitative dependence on parameters is similar to that in deterministic forcing .",
    "we find that suitably directed , degenerate white noise is considerably more effective than isotropic white noise ( and additive noise will not work ) .",
