    "to extract useful work from random motion was a dream of mankind since the days when the brownian motion was recognized .",
    "unfortunately , the second law of thermodynamics forbids to extract energy `` for free '' from equilibrium thermal fluctuations ( white noise ) , which was didactically demonstrated by r.  feynman in his _ lectures_@xcite .",
    "nevertheless , one can extract useful work from _ non - equilibrium _ or _ time - correlated _ ( colored ) noise `` not paying '' for it , using so - called ratchets , _",
    "i.e. _ , systems with an asymmetric periodic potential@xcite .",
    "recently there was a boost of activity in this field related to the experimental investigation of directed motion in biological systems , so - called brownian motors which , _",
    "e.g. _ , move muscles or transport vesicles in a cell@xcite . in the latter case",
    "the probable mechanism of operation is the motion of kinesin molecules along the surface of microtubules , which can be mapped to the motion of brownian particles along a one - dimensional ratchet potential with the period @xmath0@xcite .",
    "the non - equilibrium energy is supplied by chemical reaction of splitting of adenosine triphosphate ( atp ) which takes place close to the kinesin molecule .",
    "in addition to the application of ratchets as noise rectifiers , it was suggested to use them for very efficient separation of small objects with different mobility , _",
    "e.g. _ , dna molecules , viruses , _",
    "the particle separation is based on so - called deterministic ratchets@xcite , where the particles move in a certain direction under the action of a deterministic force with zero time average . moreover , changing the force profile one can reverse the direction of the particle motion@xcite .",
    "the classification and discussion of different types of ratchet systems can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "in this paper we focus on josephson ratchets which are of particular interest because ( a ) the directed motion results in a dc voltage according to the josephson relation and ( b ) these systems can operate at very high frequencies up to about @xmath1 . as a first example we mention the asymmetric dc squid where the equation of motion for the josephson phase ( difference of quantum mechanical phases ) corresponds to the motion of an imaginary particle in a 2d ratchet potential .",
    "such squid ratchets have been proposed @xcite and studied experimentally@xcite .",
    "another type of josephson ratchet investigated recently is a 1d array of josephson junctions with spatially modulated properties@xcite .",
    "a josephson kink ( vortex ) , which can move along the array , can be considered as quasi - particle in a 1d ratchet potential .",
    "here we propose a new class of josephson ratchets which further develops the idea of a kink in a 1d array .",
    "the proposed system consists of a 1d long josephson junction ( ljj ) which may be bent in the @xmath2-plane [ see fig .  [",
    "fig : circuit](a ) ] or have variable width @xmath3 . here and below @xmath4 is a curvelinear coordinate along the junction .",
    "the fluxon ( josephson vortex ) moving along the junction , from a mathematical point of view , is a topological soliton .",
    "it has its own mass , velocity , and other particle - like properties@xcite .",
    "we study the motion of a fluxon in ljjs in a ratchet potential which can be formed either by applying an external magnetic field and bending the junction properly or by modulating its width @xmath3 . to provide the required periodicity of the potential",
    ", the junction is topologically closed in a loop .",
    "such a geometry is similar to the well known annular josephson junction@xcite in which a fluxon moves in a sinusoidal potential created by a magnetic field .",
    "using a more elaborated shape@xcite one can form an asymmetric potential with the possibility to control its amplitude by changing the amplitude of the external magnetic field .",
    "an alternative idea of magnetic field modulation using a specially shaped control line is proposed in ref .",
    "the directional motion of a fluxon can be detected by measuring the dc voltage across the junction which is , due to the josephson relation , proportional to the average velocity of a fluxon .    before discussing fluxon dynamics in a ratchet potential",
    "we would like to stress the difference between conventional ratchets and josephson vortex ratchets .",
    "first , the fluxon , although it has a topological charge and in general behaves like a particle , is a nonlinear wave , _",
    "i.e. _ , it can change its shape rather strongly as well as emit electromagnetic waves .",
    "second , the fluxon dynamics is usually studied in the underdamped limit which is opposite to the overdamped case which was considered for the majority of work on brownian particles in a ratchet potential .",
    "small damping may result in chaotic dynamics even in the deterministic case@xcite and , in the case of the fluxon , even without any potential@xcite .",
    "thus , to have a well defined behavior of a fluxon ratchet , one has to work in the overdamped or in the weakly underdamped limit .",
    "if one uses conventional nb - alo@xmath5-nb technology to fabricate the ljj , this requirement means that the working temperature should be very close to @xmath6 . as an alternative",
    "one can use junctions with intrinsically high damping such as sinis ljjs@xcite or high-@xmath6 ljjs technology@xcite which allows to fabricate ljjs of required topology .",
    "third , if we consider multi - particle dynamics , the strong repelling interaction between fluxons plays an important role and must be taken into account .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [",
    "sec : model ] we derive the equations for the dynamics of the josephson phase in a bent ljj of variable width @xmath3 in the external magnetic field .",
    "we also discuss different kinds of fluxon ratchets , their advantages and drawbacks .",
    "the numerical simulation results are presented in [ sec : simulation ] .",
    "section [ sec : conclusion ] concludes this work .",
    "here we derive the generalized perturbed sine - gordon equation which takes into account the curvature of the ljj in the @xmath2-plane [ see fig .  [",

    "all other curves for @xmath1630.1 were obtained by means of direct numerical simulation of eq .",

    "such values of frequencies were chosen taking into account that they should be less but comparable with @xmath160 . as we saw in simulations , at @xmath164 [ in the case of fig .",
    "[ fig : sim : vdc(irf):saw - tooth](a ) already for @xmath165 the rectification is suppressed almost completely .    from fig .",
    "[ fig : sim : vdc(irf):saw - tooth ] one can see that the dependence @xmath161 for quasi - static case is piecewise with jumps at the values of bias current where switching between different hysteretic branches occurs .",
    "for example , let us focus on @xmath166 [ see fig .",
    "[ fig : sim : vdc(irf):saw - tooth](b ) ] .",

    "[ fig : sim : ic(h):saw ] , [ fig : ivc@h=1.0 ] and [ fig : sim : vdc(irf):saw - tooth ] ) .",
    "several characteristic regions can be distinguished .",
    "first , in the region of small values of @xmath167 , where @xmath168 , the amplitude of the ac current is not big enough to exceed the pinning current and the fluxon is localized in the well . at higher ac bias up to @xmath169 the positive depinning current is exceeded and the system switches to the fluxon step , _",
    "i.e. _ , the fluxon escapes from the well and starts to move around the junction .",
    "note that during a period of ac drive the fluxon can only make integer number of turns and at the end of the period will be again localized in the well .",
    "this results in the quantization of the average velocity @xmath170 , as can be seen as steps on all curves except for the quasi - static one .",
    "the step number corresponds to the number of turns done by the fluxon during one period of ac drive .",
    "the voltage rectifier based on this principle will give a quantized voltage @xmath171 ( in physical units ) which is defined by fundamental constants and the applied frequency .",
    "the corresponding velocity quanta in fig .",
    "[ fig : sim : vdc(irf):saw - tooth ] are given by @xmath172 .",
    "this gives @xmath173 for @xmath90 and @xmath163 .",
    "note that the voltage quantum increases with @xmath159 and for @xmath163 five quanta ( turns per ac cycle ) give the same voltage as one quantum for @xmath174 .",
    "for the quasi - static case the voltage quantum is infinitesimal so that the quasi - static curves look smooth .",
    "a further increase of the ac bias amplitude @xmath175 results in a decrease of the dc voltage because during the negative semi - period of the ac drive the fluxon starts moving in the opposite direction so that the efficiency of the fluxon ratchet drops .",
    "the big peak at @xmath176 in fig .",
    "[ fig : sim : vdc(irf):saw - tooth](b ) is related to the switching of the junction to the resistive state during the positive semi - period while during the negative semi - period the junction stays in the zero - voltage state or on the fluxon step . when the amplitude of ac drive gets big enough to switch the system to the resistive state",
    "also during negative semi - periods , the dc voltage drops again and in the limit of very strong ac drive approaches zero .",
    "a large amplitude of ac bias @xmath177 implies that the system spends almost the whole period in the positive or negative resistive state and only a tiny fraction of the period on the asymmetric part of the current - velocity characteristic at low currents , so that the resulting average velocity is close to zero .",
    "in addition , such a strong ac drive results in chaotic dynamics , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : sim : vdc(irf):saw - tooth ] for large values of @xmath167 .",
    "figure  [ fig : sim : vdc(irf):saw - tooth ] also shows that the rectification effect decreases when the driving frequency increases and approaches the maximum fluxon rotation frequency @xmath160 .",
    "we point out that the performance of the fluxon rectifier depends on the chosen potential amplitude @xmath82 . for comparison in fig .",
    "[ fig : sim : vdc(irf):saw - tooth](a)(c ) we show the rectification characteristics for different values of magnetic field amplitude @xmath178 , 1.0 and 2.0 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : sim : ic(h):saw ] ) .",
    "we see that the potential depth affects the amplitude of ac drive at which rectification appears , at which @xmath161 has maximum and it affects the relative location of the two regions corresponding to the fluxon rectification regime and resistive rectification regime .",
    "we note , that the resistive rectification regime in principle gives a larger effect which is inversely proportional to the damping coefficient @xmath179 , _",
    "i.e. _ , it can be made rather big .",
    "however , this is a rather trivial effect which can be obtained using any non - symmetric @xmath152@xmath153 curve .",
    "the fluxon rectification regime , which is the main subject of this study , gives smaller but a quantized voltages .",
    "this can be an advantage for some applications .",
    "we proposed a new type of josephson vortex ratchets , where the motion of a fluxon along a long josephson junction closed in a loop can be considered as the motion of a quasi - particle in a ratchet potential .",
    "the derived model suggests several implementations of the fluxon ratchets , and , in particular , the one where the amplitude of the potential can be controlled during experiment .",
    "since the fluxon is a soliton ( non - linear wave ) moving in the underdamped medium with asymmetric potential , we expect some non - trivial effects related to ( a ) wave properties of the fluxon , ( b ) underdamped dynamics and ( c ) interaction between fluxons . as a first step , we performed a numerical analysis of the effective potential seen by a fluxon , and checked the rectification of a monochromatic signal .",
    "we found that a fluxon rectifier produces a quantized voltage , with a quantum given ( due to the josephson relation ) only by the fundamental constant @xmath180 and the driving frequency @xmath159 .",
