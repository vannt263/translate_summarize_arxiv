    "the physical process of star formation is of fundamental astrophysical importance over a wide range of interconnected scales .",
    "individual stars and star clusters are observed to form within giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) , which themselves form from the more diffuse interstellar medium ( ism ) within galaxies . at the largest scales",
    ", the evolution of star formation across cosmic time plays a key role in galaxy evolution ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "an important first step toward a predictive theory of star formation is an understanding of the empirical relationship between star formation rates ( sfrs ) and interstellar gas .",
    "half a century ago @xcite postulated that the star formation rate surface density in galaxies should scale as a power law with the surface density of gas , i.e. @xmath7 .",
    "more recently , @xcite demonstrated the existence of a nonlinear ( @xmath8 ) power law between galaxy - integrated @xmath9 and @xmath10 across several orders of magnitude in spiral and starburst galaxies .    in the past decade , the rapid improvement of observational facilities has led to high - resolution , high - sensitivity multiwavelength probes of star formation and gas across larger samples of galaxies , as well as the first resolved studies within external galaxies ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein for a comprehensive overview ) .",
    "investigations that separate the roles of atomic ( ) and molecular ( h@xmath11 ) gas have shown that the more fundamental relation is the one between star formation and molecular gas ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , multiple studies at kpc - resolution in both individual galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and across samples of spiral galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have found @xmath12  a linear relation between @xmath9 and the molecular gas surface density @xmath13 .",
    "one interpretation of this linear slope is an approximately constant depletion time ( @xmath14 ) , the timescale for the molecular gas reservoir to be entirely converted into stars .",
    "extragalactic studies consistently derive average depletion times of about 2  gyr  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "several factors complicate our understanding of the physical basis for the empirical power law relation between gas and sfr and the interpretation of @xmath15 . for example , the derived slope appears to depend on the physical scale sampled @xcite , the choice of molecular gas tracer @xcite , and the fitting method used @xcite .",
    "furthermore , while a linear slope ( and constant @xmath15 ) describes well the global average scaling relation in star - forming disk galaxies , individual galaxies show deviations from a single depletion time ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "second order effects such as variations in the ability of co to trace the total molecular gas content @xcite may contribute to the scatter in @xmath15 .",
    "intriguing insights into the relation between star formation and molecular gas have come from studies of the nearest molecular clouds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for example , @xcite , hereafter l10 , demonstrated a tight linear correlation between the integrated star formation rate ( sfr ) and total mass in dense ( i.e. , gas with @xmath16  @xmath17 ) molecular gas @xmath18 in a sample of ten well - resolved nearby molecular clouds .",
    "@xcite also showed that the same linear correlation exists between the sfr and _ total _ gas mass @xmath19 , albeit with more scatter .",
    "they interpret the scatter as arising due to differences in the dense gas fraction @xmath20 , and posit that the fundamental scaling law in local clouds is of the form sfr  @xmath21 .",
    "the importance of the density structure of clouds in star formation has also been corroborated in studies of other galaxies ; for example , @xcite find a linear relation between the total infrared luminosity ( a tracer of dust - embedded star formation ) and the luminosity in the dense gas tracer hcn in entire galaxies ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "additionally , the @xcite correlation extends smoothly across more than five orders of magnitude and is consistent with the @xcite results to within a factor of three .    for their sample of milky way clouds , l10 derive a median @xmath15 of 180  myr  an order of magnitude shorter than the typical depletion times inferred for kpc - sized regions within disk galaxies .",
    "does this difference reflect local environmental factors , the use of differing methods to derive sfrs and gas masses or densities , or the discrepant scales probed ? to address this issue",
    "it is necessary to expand the local cloud sample to include a more heterogeneous set of galactic environments .",
    "unfortunately , only the nearest clouds can be observed at a high enough resolution to be analyzed in a manner similar to that of l10 .",
    "furthermore , studies of more distant regions of the milky way are also complicated by uncertainties due to kinematic distance ambiguities and confusion along the line - of - sight . compiling a set of measurements of star - forming regions within an external galaxy",
    "effectively places all regions at a single , consistent distance , avoiding the above issues .",
    "however , deriving star formation rates at gmc scales within other galaxies is not a trivial exercise , as integrated measurements of emission from young stellar populations and extrapolation of the initial mass function ( imf ) must be employed since individual stars can not be resolved and the most massive stars dominate the luminosity of these populations . as a first step toward extending the study of star formation in gmcs within galaxies beyond the milky way ,",
    "we have conducted a survey of the molecular ism in the nearby spiral galaxy ngc  300 , which we analyze alongside archival ultraviolet , infrared , and h@xmath5 images in a manner as consistent as possible with the methodology used for the l10 sample .",
    "ngc  300 is a southern - declination ( @xmath22 ) , relatively small ( @xmath23  kpc ) , moderately inclined ( 40@xmath24 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , slightly subsolar metallicity spiral galaxy at a distance of 1.93  mpc @xcite .",
    "it is forming stars at a global rate of about @xmath25  yr@xmath26  @xcite .",
    "previous observations have revealed large numbers of active regions  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as well as supernova remnants ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , suggesting that star formation has been proceeding actively throughout the galactic disk for several generations of stars .",
    "it is thus an ideal laboratory in which to study the relationship between molecular gas and the sfr in a large sample of individual star forming regions .    our sample of star - forming regions in ngc  300 consists of 76 regions from the catalog of @xcite .",

    "inner radii chosen for crowded regions ranged from 16 to 36 , and outer radii from 28 to 72 .",
    "the background level per pixel for a given region was determined using the idl task ` mmm.pro ` , which uses a procedure that iteratively removes sources of emission within the annulus from the pixel distribution and returns the mode of the remaining pixels . using our most crowded image , the galex fuv image , we verified that this procedure is robust even for annuli containing multiple sources by comparing average pixel values of nearby blank sky regions with the background levels found by our iterative algorithm .",

    "we also compared photometry computed using the mode background - subtraction method with iterative sigma - clipping and then taking the mean background , and find excellent agreement for the majority of sources in our sample .",
    "we flux calibrated the h@xmath5 image using observations of the standard star ltt17379 taken the same night as our ngc  300 observations . as an independent check on this calibration",
    ", we also conducted photometry on a number of previously measured regions with measured fluxes published in @xcite .",
    "in particular , we measured the fluxes of 12 of their sources that are unambiguously uncrowded .",
    "we used the customized photometric aperture sizes specified in their table  1 ( 9.6 - 36.0 in diameter ) , although the results change very little if we use 27 diameter apertures .",
    "we find a tight correlation between our photometry and their measured fluxes , and fit the relation using linear least - squares analysis to derive a calibration factor .",
    "this factor is within 4% of the flux calibration determined from the standard star , and so we adopt 4% as our flux calibration uncertainty , which we propagate into our final photometric errors .",
    "note that @xcite report h@xmath5 fluxes having accounted for contamination of 10% the total flux within the filter . although in reality this number probably varies from source to source , the low average fraction suggests that the effect on our results is likely minimal .",

    "since we are targeting known regions , we are probing the locations in which stars have formed very recently .",

    "we assume here implicitly that the beam size is larger than the source size , and so have replaced the solid angle of the source convolved with the beam with that of the beam . given that gmcs in the milky way are typically @xmath40  pc in size , and that many of our sources show compact emission at other wavelengths , this assumption should be reasonable .",

    ", stars can be resolved , and thus star formation rates can be inferred by simply counting the total mass in young stars and dividing by their characteristic age . on the other hand ,",
    "calculations of the star formation rate on kpc or galaxy - wide scales utilize integrated measures of unresolved stellar populations and population synthesis modeling .",

    "other sources exhibit secondary peaks within the 250  pc aperture , but the fact that both are h@xmath5-bright at the same time suggests that these populations may be coeval and/or physically connected .",

    "while h@xmath5 and fuv emission are both signposts for massive star formation , they can be significantly attenuated by dust . since star forming",
    "regions tend to be rich in dust , this can leave only 20 - 40% of the original emission at these wavelengths actually visible within some parts of a spiral galaxy .",
    "the absorbed light is then re - radiated in the infrared as thermal emission from dust grains . due to the intense uv radiation fields near young massive stars",
    ", dust can be significantly heated , and despite the fact that 24@xmath4 m emission contributes only 5 - 10% of the total infrared luminosity , it is considered a reasonable tracer of dust - obscured star formation in young star - forming regions  ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . the ratio of infrared to ultraviolet ( or h@xmath5 , as a proxy ) emission can therefore be used to correct for extinction . while not as direct as using the balmer decrement or less attenuated recombination lines such as pa@xmath5 , this method allows for region - by - region extinction estimates when more easily obtained infrared photometry is available .",
    "we are thus able to use our 24 @xmath4 m photometry to account for the fact that extinction varies widely between the regions in ngc  300 @xcite .",

    "* ) . to test the implications of changing this assumption",
    ", we compared the results we obtained from the models discussed in   [ sec : models ] with those derived from continuous star formation models .",
    "in particular , we ran a series of ` starburst99 ` simulations with identical parameters to those described in table  [ tab : sb99 ] , with the exception that we set sfrs to be continuous with rates ranging between @xmath127  yr@xmath26 .",
    "initially , model tracks for the h@xmath5 and fuv luminosities from a continuous star formation model evolve towards higher luminosities in both axes .",
    "however , h@xmath5 remains constant after reaching a population age at which the birth rate of ionizing stars matches the death rate ( @xmath128  myr ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while fuv continues to increase until it reaches the corresponding fuv steady - state time ( @xmath129  myr ) .",
    "we then compared our instantaneous burst sfrs to those derived from the continuous sfr models at specific timescales : 2  myr , the luminosity - weighted average timescale for the emission of an h@xmath5 photon in an instantaneous burst population @xcite ; 3.7  myr , the characteristic age of our stellar populations as computed from our instantaneous burst model grid ; and , 10  myr , the upper limit for the lifetime of a gmc  @xcite .",
    "for all three cases we derived sfrs within a factor of two of our previous results , though we note that using the 10  myr timescale resulted in sfrs that were on average the most discrepant from our instantaneous burst results , again highlighting the importance of choosing model timescales judiciously .",
    "thus we conclude that , provided that we use appropriate ( @xmath130  myr ) timescales for 250  pc star forming regions , a continuous star formation model is also a reasonable assumption . for our analysis , we prefer the instantaneous burst models , as they allow modeling of the stellar population masses and ages , and a computation of the sfr in a manner more similar to that of l10 . using",
    "a continuous sfr model would produce a systematic shift toward lower sfrs by a factor of on average about 40% , the difference between the two sets of models when the continuous sfr tracks are read out at 3.5  myr .",
    "a second potential source of uncertainty is due to the fact that our analysis relies on tracers of only the most massive stars , which produce a majority of the luminosity but comprise a minority of the total stellar mass of the population .",
    "thus there is some sensitivity of our modeling results to the functional form , slope , and upper mass cutoff of the imf .",
    "previous studies have investigated this issue in detail ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , finding that differences in derived sfrs using salpeter and kroupa - type imfs amounted to factors of about 50% .",
    "we thus caution that our results may suffer from additional systematic uncertainties at this level .",
    "however , assuming that the form of the imf is similar across ngc  300 s star clusters , this should not affect the relative difference in sfrs amongst regions , and so we do not include this systematic uncertainty in our reported sfrs . to illustrate the effects of changing the upper mass limit of the imf , we present in table  [ tab : varimf ] the median sfrs for our sample of regions derived for a range of imf upper limits from 50 to 120  @xmath2 . over this entire range , sfrs change by a factor of at most 30% .",
    "note that upper mass limits lower than 50  @xmath2 lead to unphysical results in that the majority of the ngc  300 data points then lie outside the parameter space spanned by the tracks .",
    "we take the uncertainty on our derived sfrs to be @xmath131  dex , the relative difference in median sfr derived using our chosen 100  @xmath2 imf upper mass limit as compared to that derived using 50 and 120  @xmath2 upper limits .",
    "a third source of uncertainty is due to stochastic sampling of the upper end of the imf , which is particularly problematic for low - mass stellar populations  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . since the sfr tracers we use here rely on the presence of massive stars , the uncertainty in the total derived population mass using these tracers ( and thus the sfr ) increases as the expected number of massive stars in the population declines .",
    "previous studies have found that this effect is non - negligible for populations with fewer than about ten o - stars , or equivalently population masses @xmath132  @xcite . to quantify and account for this effect ,",
    "we have computed the `` most massive star '' ( with mass @xmath133 ) expected in a stellar population as a function of the population mass for our fiducial kroupa imf by analytically integrating the upper end of the imf and solving for the stellar mass above which only one star is expected ( see appendix [ sec : imf ] for details ) .",
    "since the poisson error on a histogram bin with value unity is also unity , the 1@xmath58 range on the number of stars in the mass bin centered on @xmath133 extends from zero to two .",
    "thus we take the fuv and h@xmath5 luminosities emitted by a star with mass @xmath133 to be the stochastic contribution to the uncertainties on the fuv and h@xmath5 luminosities of the population .",
    "this is propagated formally into uncertainties on @xmath115 , @xmath116 , and the sfr ; see appendix  [ sec : imf ] for a complete description of our procedure .",

    "we examine the radial variation of the detection rate and the gmc complex ( gmcc ) mass spectrum .",
    "our region sample was chosen to cover a representative range in galactocentric radii of ngc  300 s disk ( figure  [ fig : dclhist ] ) . to assess the distribution of gas - rich star forming regions within the galaxy , we plot histograms comparing the radial distributions of co - detected sources and upper limits in figure  [ fig : radialco ] , binned by 1  kpc . in the bottom panel of the figure we also show the co detection rate as a function of galactocentric radius .",
    "the detection rate is simply defined to be the number of regions in a given radius bin in which co is detected divided by the total number of observed regions in that radius bin .",
    "region positions were deprojected using a custom idl routine based on ` im_hiiregion_deproject.pro ` by j. moustakas .",
    "the detection rate clearly decreases with increasing radius .",
    "the inner 3 - 4 kpc is dominated by co detections , and we significantly detect co in about 75% of regions inside 3  kpc .",
    "however , despite the sample extending to @xmath140  kpc , we do not detect co in any regions with distances greater than 4 kpc .",
    "this trend is most likely a direct result of the fact that co becomes a progressively poorer tracer of molecular gas toward the outer reaches of the galaxy due to the negative radial metallicity gradient .",
    "since @xmath73 increases by up to a factor of three for the regions at largest galactocentric distance  ( see   [ fig : acovar ] ) , a cloud of a given mass in the outer reaches of ngc  300 would require a factor of nine longer integration time to detect in co(2 - 1 ) than the same cloud near the galaxy center .",
    "we thus very likely miss such clouds in the outskirts despite being able to detect similar objects at smaller radii .",
    "the decrease in detection rate with radius may also be due in part to the fact that gmcs more distant from the galaxy s center are on average less massive than those within the disk . the average surface density of molecular gas is lower in the outer part of the milky way ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and this may be the case for ngc  300 as well .",
    "if so , we may further be underestimating the masses of clouds at large galactocentric radii due to additional increase of @xmath73 in these regions caused by a lower @xmath84 than the milky way - average value we have assumed ( see   [ sec : mmol ] ) .          the mass spectrum of clouds ( or other bound entities )",
    "is generally expressed in differential form and taken to be a power law with index @xmath141 , i.e. , @xmath142 we calculate the mass spectrum for our sample of 42 co - detected sources in ngc  300 by separating the @xmath68 distribution into equally spaced logarithmic bins , where the bin size of 0.15  dex corresponds to twice the typical fractional uncertainty in @xmath68 .",

    "this fit is shown as a dotted line in the figure .",
    "changing the bin size has only minor consequences on the best - fit @xmath141 : varying the bin size between 0.08 and 0.25  dex , the best - fit power law index ranges from 2.1 to 2.7 .    while a gmcc mass spectrum does not necessarily map to a gmc mass spectrum with similar slope , it is nevertheless instructive to consider the distribution of gmccs by mass in the context of cloud mass functions in other galaxies .",
    "our derived slope of @xmath149 is relatively steep compared to the power law indices computed for inner milky way clouds ( @xmath150 ) by @xcite .",
    "that same study found progressively steeper indices in the lmc ( @xmath151 ) and m33 ( @xmath152 ) .",

    "testing this scenario conclusively awaits data from dense gas tracers .",
    "we do note that the ngc  300 co - detected regions show physically plausible dense gas fractions ranging between a few and nearly 100% .",
    "differences in the evolutionary state of individual regions could provide an alternative explanation for the large scatter in the sfr-@xmath68 plane .",
    "it could be that clouds with short @xmath15 have used up some of the gas from which the current population of stars formed , and thus are shifted to the left in the diagram from the position they occupied with their original gas reservoir .",
    "in such a scenario clouds with long @xmath15 may simply be very young , and just beginning the process of star formation , i.e. shifted downward in sfr for a given @xmath68 .",

    "evolutionary state in this sense thus does not seem to play a major role in explaining the scatter in @xmath15",
    ". we do not , however , account for two potential additional evolutionary effects : ( 1 ) feedback from stellar populations onto their parent clouds , which may have decreased the molecular gas content from its original reservoir due to ionization and photodissociation  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or ( 2 ) the possibility of continuing formation or accretion of molecular gas in gmcs  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which may act to increase the reservoir . investigating these scenarios",
    "further is potentially very interesting but would require additional detailed modeling that is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "@xcite also suggested that the linear relation between the sfr and gmc mass which describes the milky way sample and is consistent with our ngc  300 results also holds in entire galactic systems .",
    "this could be additional evidence pointing to a universal ( if not necessarily surprising ) linear relation between molecular gas mass and star formation rate . a potentially more interesting ( and physically meaningful ) relation",
    "is that between _ dense _ gas and star formation , which @xcite show also extends from local clouds to entire galaxies studied in the dense gas tracer hcn .",
    "the scatter in the sfr-@xmath18 relation is also much lower than that in the sfr-@xmath19 relation for the l10 sample .",
    "future observations of the molecular gas associated with regions in ngc  300 with , e.g. , alma to trace the dense gas component will test the hypothesis that the amount of scatter decreases when the mass in only dense gas is considered , as is the case for the local clouds , and further illuminate the role of the dense gas fraction in star - forming gmcs .      as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : ext ] , the population synthesis models used in standard prescriptions for estimating sfrs in galaxies and large regions within them typically utilize the continuous star formation approximation over 100  myr timescales .",
    "these assumptions are appropriate for large regions of star - forming galaxies in which multiple stellar populations are in various stages of evolution such that the total star formation rate , averaged over sufficiently long timescales , appears continuous",
    ". however , these prescriptions may not be valid for use on smaller regions consisting of localized , instantaneous star - formation where the above assumptions begin to break down  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . to explore the effects of applying extragalactic prescriptions on region - scales , we utilize our data to compute sfrs using two well - defined prescriptions from the literature and compare the results to those derived using our direct modeling approach",
    "figure  [ fig : litcomp ] shows our sfrs plotted against those computed with the h@xmath5 + 24@xmath4 m calibration of @xcite and the fuv+24@xmath4 m calibration of @xcite .",
    "we find an excellent correlation between sfrs derived using our method and each of these prescriptions , with spearman rank correlation coefficients of 0.93 and 0.94 , respectively .",
    "there is also a systematic offset such that our sfrs are higher by an average factor of 2.1 and 3.1 in relation to the @xcite and @xcite prescription - derived sfrs , respectively .",
    "the smaller offset with respect to the @xcite prescription may be because they targeted ` knots ' , centering their measurements on h@xmath5 and 24 @xmath4 m peaks ( and thus peaks of star formation ) , albeit at larger scales than our study .",
    "in contrast , the @xcite calibration was derived for kpc - sized regions within galaxies , without specifically targeting star - forming regions directly .",
    "furthermore , we recover higher sfrs than @xcite in the low - sfr regime . since h@xmath5 is heavily suppressed in lower mass star forming regions , our complementary use of fuv presumably allows us to recover low sfrs more accurately , although it is still subject to caveats regarding , e.g. , stochastic sampling of the imf at low cluster masses .",
    "the most likely explanation for the systematic offset of our sfrs with respect to the extragalactic prescriptions has to do with the timescales used in the models .",
    "unlike modeled emission from an instantaneous burst , fuv and h@xmath5 luminosity _ increase _ over time in a continuous sf model , eventually reaching a ` steady - state ' level where the stars that dominate the emission in a given tracer depart from the main sequence at the same rate that new stars replace them .",
    "the time to reach this steady - state condition is essentially the characteristic timescale over which the tracer probes star formation .",
    "since slightly older ( 10 - 100  myr ) populations contribute significantly to fuv emission , the modeled fuv luminosity increases over time until about 100  myr pass in the simulation .",
    "this has a significant effect on deriving sfrs from fuv observations : if a short timescale is assumed , a given fuv luminosity will correspond to a _ higher _ sfr than it would for a long timescale .",
    "thus continuous models based on 100  myr timescales will _ underestimate _ sfrs in regions where star formation has only been going on for a few to 10 myr .",
    "regions are typically younger than 10  myr , and so the application of standard extragalactic sfr prescriptions to regions at 250  pc scales results in an underprediction of the sfr , an effect we see in our results and that has been noted previously in the literature ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .",
    "many studies of statistically significant samples of regions within multiple galaxies have shown a linear or near - linear scaling of the surface density of star formation rate ( @xmath9 ) with that of molecular gas ( @xmath13 ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a linear scaling is equivalent to a constant average molecular gas depletion time , where here @xmath165 is the ratio of surface densities instead of integrated quantities .",
    "when all regions within a galaxy ( i.e. not just those identified as star - forming ) are considered , these studies identify much longer depletion times than those we derive for our sample of regions in ngc 300 .",
    "for example , @xcite find a global molecular gas depletion time of @xmath166  gyr ( with about a factor of two scatter ) in their comprehensive investigation of 30 nearby spiral galaxies .",
    "in contrast , we find a median depletion time of 230  myr in our ngc  300 sample , about an order of magnitude lower . in the next section",
    "we explore some possible explanations for this difference .",
    "most extragalactic studies of star formation scaling relations derive surface ( per area ) quantities instead of integrated ones .",
    "are there fundamental differences between this line of analysis and the integrated studies performed here and in most studies of local clouds ? in our sample , we do not resolve individual molecular clouds with apex , and so converting our integrated molecular gas measurements to gas surface densities simply involves dividing by the fixed area of the beam .",
    "for the sfrs , we assume that all emission in our tracers within the photometric aperture is from the young stellar population , and so converting sfr to sfr surface density implies dividing by the aperture area . since , by design , we chose the aperture to be the same size as the apex beam for the majority of sources , the relative position of data points in the @xmath9@xmath167 plane is very similar to that in the sfr@xmath68 plane .",
    "for those sources with altered aperture sizes , the change in area is not large enough to shift the data points significantly . as a test , we have computed @xmath15 using surface quantities derived from our measurements and find a very similar median value of 220  myr , as compared to 230  myr from integrated measurements .",
    "thus we conclude that the choice of integrated vs. surface measurements does not play a role in the @xmath15 difference between our results and kpc - scale extragalactic studies .      one crucial difference between the present study and those that sample sfr and molecular gas across the entirety of galactic disks is that we have purposefully biased our sample to target star - forming regions .",
    "if the star formation activity and molecular gas are both preferentially localized within such regions , this should have no effect on @xmath15 , as the kpc ( or larger ) scale measurements will simply consist of several such regions added together ( though with some dilution of signal due to a low filling factor ) . however , if there is a significant diffuse molecular component outside of star - forming regions , this could cause untargeted surveys to estimate a depletion time that refers to the time needed to consume _ all _ the molecular gas , including that which is not actively star - forming .",
    "cast in the context of the @xcite framework in which star formation activity is most closely connected to the dense gas fraction , the diffuse gas picked up in non - star - forming regions in untargeted surveys may have extremely low dense gas fractions , and thus low star formation rates .",
    "this could bias the depletion time to higher values and explain some of the discrepancy between our @xmath15 and that derived in untargeted surveys .",
    "however , the fact that we fail to detect co in several of our region targets places an approximate upper limit on the amount of molecular gas that might be missed in this way .",
    "our average co upper limit is @xmath168 , which corresponds to @xmath169  pc@xmath79 over our 250  pc beam .",
    "most extragalactic studies do not reach this level of sensitivity , and thus would also not pick up this quantity of gas in their kpc - scale beams ( though see also * ? ? ?",
    ". however , the low gas densities we observe may be partially a result of ionization and photodissociation of the original molecular gas reservoir by the energetic stars in the nearby regions , and so this upper limit may be an underestimate of the diffuse gas component in more quiescent regions of galaxies .",
    "furthermore , @xcite show that focusing measurements on peaks of star formation in m33 while using sub - kpc apertures leads to a factor of 2 to 3 higher sfrs and thus _ shorter _ measured @xmath15 compared to values computed from observations that do not target star forming regions .",
    "this may partially , but not entirely , explain why the value of @xmath15 we derive is smaller than that computed over kpc - sized regions in galaxies",
    ". the remainder of the discrepancy may be due to a significant diffuse gas component , as discussed above .",
    "the contribution of large - scale , diffuse , non star - forming molecular gas to the total molecular mass budget of a galaxy is highly uncertain , but there is some recent evidence that it may be significant .",
    "for example , half the total emission in the spiral galaxy m51 appears to be coming from diffuse gas at @xmath170  kpc scales  @xcite .",
    "if this is the case in other spiral galaxies ( such as ngc  300 ) , measurements on these large scales will naturally find longer @xmath15 than those that isolate star - forming regions .",
    "the depletion time measured over large scales in galaxies thus represents the time needed to consume the entire molecular gas reservoir , including that which is non star - forming .",
    "in contrast , the depletion time measured within star - forming regions reflects the time needed for conversion of gas primarily organized into molecular clouds into stars .",
    "we have conducted a comprehensive multiwavelength survey of a sample of 76 regions within the nearby ( @xmath171  mpc ) spiral galaxy ngc  300 to assess the molecular gas and star formation activity at 250  pc scales .",
    "we measured @xmath27co ( @xmath0 ) emission in targeted observations with apex , and used this data to derive the co luminosity and molecular gas mass .",
    "we utilized archival galex fuv and eso / wfi h@xmath5 maps to survey recent star formation , correcting for extinction with _",
    "spitzer_/mips 24@xmath4 m data .",
    "we developed a new , direct modeling approach to calculating masses , ages , and star formation rates for single stellar populations , leveraging our multiwavelength dataset alongside customized ` starburst99 ` simulation runs ( figures  [ fig : havsfuv ] , [ fig : mc ] ) .",
    "we summarize our main conclusions below .    1 .",
    "we detect @xmath27co(2 - 1 ) in 42 of the 76 regions observed .",
    "the co detection rate falls rapidly with radius , consistent with the previously measured metallicity gradient in ngc  300 and corresponding radial increase of @xmath73 , the co - to - h@xmath11 conversion factor ( figures  [ fig : acovar ] , [ fig : radialco ] ) .",
    "we derive masses @xmath115 for stellar populations within our region sample that range from @xmath172 to @xmath173 and population ages between 2 and 6  myr ( with a strong peak at 4 myr ; figure  [ fig : hists ] ) .",
    "there is no trend in any of @xmath115 , age , or sfr with galactocentric radius out to 7  kpc .",
    "we find that the mass function of gmc complexes ( gmccs ) associated with regions in ngc  300 is steep ( slope of -2.7 ) , more similar to the gmc mass function in m33 than that of the milky way ( figure  [ fig : massspec ] ) .",
    "the ngc 300 sample extends the local cloud sample of l10 by about an order of magnitude in both mass and sfr .",
    "the scaling relation between sfr and molecular gas mass @xmath68 in ngc  300 is consistent with the relation found by l10 for the local clouds ( figure  [ fig : sfrmmol ] ) . 5 .",
    "the level of scatter in the sfr-@xmath68 relation in the ngc 300 sample is consistent with that in the local clouds , and is likely mostly due to intrinsic region - to - region differences in physical properties such as the dense gas fraction , as is the case in the local gmcs .",
    "the scatter corresponds to a range in molecular gas depletion times @xmath15 from 23  myr to 1.2  gyr for the ngc  300 sample , similar to the range of depletion times found in milky way clouds .",
    "there is no trend in @xmath15 with galactocentric radius in ngc  300 ( figure  [ fig : tdep_rgal ] ) .",
    "we find a median @xmath15 of @xmath174  myr at our resolution of 250  pc  almost an order of magnitude shorter than that found in most extragalactic studies that resolve @xmath96  kpc scales . while extragalactic studies that sample kpc - scale regions in disks average over many stellar populations at different evolutionary states and can be modeled by a continuous star formation paradigm over 100  myr timescales , the regions we study here consist of individual young stellar populations better described by instantaneous burst models evolved over only a few myr .",
    "the depletion times we measure correspond to the timescale for star formation to use up the gas reservoir in the star cluster s parent gmc , which may be the more relevant quantity in the context of gmc - regulated star formation in galaxies .",
    "the method and analysis we present here for ngc  300 is general and applicable to other star - forming systems for which unresolved measurements of h@xmath5 , fuv , 24  @xmath4 m , and some tracer of the molecular ism are available .",
    "similar studies in other galaxies will be important in elucidating any systemic differences based on galaxy properties such as metallicity , mass , or morphology , and in assessing the physical reason(s ) for the scatter in @xmath15 .",

    ". our approach should be generally applicable to the estimation of uncertainties in population synthesis modeling which does not account for stochastic sampling of the imf such as ` starburst99 `  ( cf .",
    "measures of star formation that trace the upper end of the imf , such as fuv and h@xmath5 emission , are sensitive to both the form of the imf as well as stochastic deviation from the expected distribution within a given population .",
    "the latter effect is particularly severe for low - mass stellar populations in which there may be very few massive stars , and so the addition or removal of even a single star can alter the population s fuv and ionizing photon output significantly .",
    "for this analysis we treat the imf as a continuous probability distribution function ( pdf ) from which we draw each model population .",
    "the ` starburst99 ` models we choose ( table  [ tab : sb99 ] ) use the kroupa imf , which gives the number of stars @xmath225 in each mass bin as a two - part power law : @xmath226 with @xmath227 @xmath228 is a constant that sets the total population size ( and mass ) , and @xmath229 is the upper mass limit of the imf . the default value in ` starburst99 ` is @xmath230 , but here we leave @xmath229 as a free parameter and explore the effects of changing it .",
    "note that @xmath228 will take on different values for each segment of the broken power law .",
    "if we are interested in knowing the number of stars of particular masses for a given population mass , we can solve for @xmath228 and then integrate equation  ( [ eqn : imf ] ) over the desired range .",

    "we compute @xmath133 for each given @xmath229 by setting @xmath238 in equation  ( [ eqn : imf ] ) and integrating .",

    "figure  [ fig : modeluncerts ] shows the ratio of the luminosity of the most massive star in a population to that population s total luminosity at 2  myr for both fuv and h@xmath5 .",
    "this represents an approximation of the stochastic uncertainty due to sampling the imf . to apply this to our ngc  300 results ,",
    "we take the ratio of fuv luminosities , i.e. @xmath118(@xmath259 , to be the fractional uncertainty on the derived mass , and the ratio of h@xmath5 luminosities as the fractional uncertainty on the derived age . the uncertainty on the sfr",
