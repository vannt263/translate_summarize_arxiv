    "hot big bang theory has outstanding successes in cosmology , for instance describing the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation and the light nucleosynthesis . in spit of these successes",
    ", it suffers from several problems such as the flatness problem , the horizon problem and also the magnetic mono - pole problem .",
    "inflation theory was suggested to solve all of these problems , with the idea that a short period of rapid accelerated expansion has occurred before the radiation dominated era @xcite .",
    "in addition to solving the problems of the hot big bang cosmology , inflation can provide a rational explanation for the anisotropy observed in the cmb radiation and also in the large - scale structure ( lss ) of the universe @xcite .",
    "scalar - tensor theory was established by jordan in 1950 , who included a scalar field in the gravitational part of the action . in 1961 , brans and dicke @xcite introduced a formalism for gravity according to mach s principle , in which the metric field is coupled to the scalar field to describe the gravitational force .",
    "scalar - tensor and brans - dicke theories have been noteworthy frequently since for several reasons .",
    "first , a gravitational scalar field appears in scalar - tensor theories together with the metric tensor , and a fundamental scalar coupled to gravity is an inescapable feature of superstring , supergravity , and m - theories @xcite .",
    "scalar fields are ubiquitous in particle physics and in cosmology , such as the higgs boson of the standard model , the superpartner of spin @xmath5 particles in supergravity , the string dilaton appearing in the supermultiplet of the higher - dimensional graviton , or non - fundamental fields like composite bosons and fermion condensates .",
    "second , the most potent motivation for the study of scalar - tensor theories comes from this reality that the low energy limit of the bosonic string theory equivalent to a brans - dicke theory with @xmath6 , also @xmath7 is obtained from a less conventional string theory @xcite . a further interest in brans - dicke and scalar - tensor gravity emanates from the extended and hyperextended inflationary scenarios of the early universe @xcite . in addition , as for the energy scale of the primordial universe",
    ", it is believed that cosmological inflation has occurred in the regime of high energy physics . on the other hand",
    ", the effective quantum field theory predicts that the high energy theory has fields with non - canonical kinetic terms @xcite .",
    "all mentioned in above motivate us to investigate the cosmic inflation of the early universe within the framework of the brans - dicke gravity in which the constant brans - dicke parameter is generalized to a function of scalar field , i.e. @xmath1 . our main aim is to examine the viability of the quartic potential @xmath8 in light of the planck 2015 results .",
    "note that the result of this potential in both the einstein @xcite and standard brans - dicke gravity @xcite is disfavored by the planck data .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec2 ] ,",
    "we investigate inflation in the generalized brans - dicke setting .",
    "we introduce the background equations as well as the scalar and tensor power spectrum .",
    "then we obtain the inflationary observables in terms of the slow roll parameters . in section [ sec3 ] , for a quartic potential with two choices of the generalized brans - dicke parameter containing the power - law and exponential functions of the scalar field , we examine the predictions of the model in light of the planck 2015 data .",
    "section [ sec4 ] is devoted to our conclusions .",
    "the action of generalized brans - dicke ( bd ) gravity in the jordan frame is given by @xcite @xmath9 ,          \\label{action}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath2 are the ricci scalar , the scalar field , the generalized bd parameter and the self interacting potential , respectively .",
    "note that for the case of @xmath13 cte . , the action ( [ action ] ) reduces to the standard bd gravity . here",
    "we take @xmath14 . for a spatially flat friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) universe ,",
    "the friedmann equations in generalized bd gravity take the forms @xcite .",
    "@xmath15 where @xmath16 .",
    "also the continuity equation reads @xmath17 using the slow - roll conditions @xmath18 and @xmath19 , eqs .",

    "( [ heq ] ) into ( [ hdot ] ) gives @xmath22 where we choose the positive sign in eq .",
    "( [ scalareq ] ) .",
    "because our numerical results presented in section [ sec3 ] shows that the negative sign has no end for inflation .",
    "now we turn to calculate the inflationary observable parameters . to this aim",
    ", we need to obtain the scalar and tensor power spectrum .",
    "using the perturbed equations in the scalar - tensor gravity , the power spectrum of the curvature perturbation in the slow - roll approximation takes the form @xcite @xmath23 where @xmath24 should be evaluated at the time of horizon exist , i.e. @xmath25 . here @xmath26 the recent value of the scalar perturbation amplitude has been estimated as @xmath27 ( planck 2015 tt , te , ee+lowp data ) @xcite .",
    "the scale - dependence of the scalar power spectrum is determined by the scalar spectral index @xmath28 . in the slow roll approximation",
    ", it reads @xmath29 where @xmath30 are the slow - roll parameters defined as @xcite .",
    "@xmath31 and @xmath32 the scalar spectral index measured by the planck 2015 is about @xmath33 ( 68% cl ) @xcite .    from eq .",
    "( [ nsnur ] ) , one can calculate the running of the scalar spectral index as @xmath34 the recent measured value of this parameter is @xmath35 ( 68% cl , planck 2015 tt , te , ee+lowp data ) @xcite .",
    "the power spectrum of tensor perturbations can be realized in a similar approach that was followed for deriving the scalar perturbations . in the slow - roll regime , it is given by @xcite @xmath36 the tensor spectral index @xmath37 which shows the deviation of the tensor power spectrum from the scale invariance regime , can be obtained as @xmath38 using eqs .",
    "( [ psh ] ) and ( [ pt ] ) , the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath39 in the slow - roll approximation turns into @xmath40 the recent constraint on this observable has been obtained by planck satellite as @xmath41 ( 95% cl , planck 2015 tt , te , ee+lowp data ) @xcite .",
    "another important observable predicted by inflation is non - gaussianity parameter @xmath42 which determines the variance of perturbations from the gaussian distribution ( for review see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "different inflationary models predict maximal signal for different shapes of non - gaussianity .",
    "the squeezed shape is the predominant mode of models with multiple light fields during inflation .",
    "also , for the single field inflationary models with non - canonical kinetic terms , the non - gaussianity parameter has peak in the equilateral shape .",
    "furthermore , the folded non - gaussianity becomes predominant in models with non - standard initial conditions @xcite .",
    "the equilateral non - gaussianity parameter for the scalar - tensor gravity has been obtained in @xcite as @xmath43 where @xmath44 here , the e - fold number which determines the amount of inflation is obtained as @xmath45 where @xmath21 and @xmath46 are given by eqs .",
    "( [ heq ] ) and ( [ scalareq ] ) , respectively . here",
    "@xmath47 is the scalar field at the end of inflation and it is determined by the condition @xmath48 .",
    "the anisotropies observed in the cmb is equivalent to the perturbations whose wavelengths crossed the hubble radius around @xmath49 before the end of inflation @xcite . in",
    "what follows , for the quartic potential @xmath8 and two special choices of the generalized bd parameter @xmath1 , we obtain the inflationary observables in term of @xmath50 . then using the e - fold number ( [ efold2 ] ) , we calculate the scalar field @xmath51 at the time of horizon exit ( @xmath52 ) , numerically .",
    "therefore , we can plot the @xmath53 diagram for the model and examine its viability in light of the planck 2015 results .",
    "in addition , we estimate the running of the scalar spectral index @xmath54 and the equilateral non - gaussianity @xmath55 for our model and compare their results with the observations .",
    "here , we consider a quartic potential as follows @xmath56 which is one of the simplest chaotic inflationary potentials @xcite .",
    "quartic potential in the standard model of inflation which is based on the einstein gravity , runs into trouble with the cmb @xcite . because , its prediction for the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath39 is too large and it is in disagreement with the current constraint @xmath57 deduced from the planck 2015 data",
    ". also , the prediction of quartic potential in the standard bd gravity @xcite is disfavored by the planck 2015 results . in @xcite",
    ", it was shown that the model described by the action ( [ action ] ) and potential ( [ potential ] ) can justify the late - time accelerated phase of the universe in brans - dicke cosmology .",
    "the scalar field @xmath58 in bd gravity can play the role of the dynamical @xmath59 and describe the missing energy .",
    "authors of ref.@xcite also computed different parameters like the age of the universe , the luminosity - distance redshift relation and the time variation of gravitational coupling and show that the aforementioned cosmological parameters agree quite well with the observations @xcite .",
    "it is well known that within the framework of standard bd gravity , the constant bd parameter has constraint @xmath60 from the solar system test . on the other hand ,",

    "was introduced by @xcite .",

    "bd theory with time varying @xmath64 has gained a strong support from string and kaluza - klein theories @xcite .",
    "in addition , a few attempts have been done to study the dynamics of the universe in generalized bd .",
    "for instance , for large @xmath65 , bd theory gives the correct amount of inflation and early and late time behavior , and for small negative @xmath66 , it correctly explains cosmic acceleration , structure formation and coincidence problem @xcite . in what follows ,",
    "we consider two choices for the generalized bd parameter as @xmath67 and @xmath68 , and examine the viability of the quartic inflationary potential ( [ potential ] ) in light of the planck 2015 results .",
