    ".    however , in this work we want to emphasize the use of two  energy equations \" , namely the pure mechanical one , relating the variation of the centre - of - mass kinetic energy with the pseudo - work performed by the resultant external force , and the other one , which is simply the equation expressing the first law of thermodynamics : the variation of the total energy of a system is accounted for by all types of works upon the system and by the heat transfers .",

    "it should not be confused with the infinitesimal  work \" of a force which is the dot product of the force and of its own infinitesimal displacement .",
    "the above two equations are equivalent , though they may provide complementary information .",
    "the first equation will be referred to as the impulse - momentum equation and states that the infinitesimal impulse of @xmath5 equals the infinitesimal variation of the linear momentum of the center - of - mass , @xmath7 .",
    "the second equation , which will be referred to as the centre - of - mass equation , states that the infinitesimal pseudo - work equals the infinitesimal variation of the centre - of - mass kinetic energy , @xmath8 .",

    "( [ newtonpt ] ) and ( [ eq-3 ] ) , one readily obtains the corresponding integral equations",

    "on the other hand , if there are , for instance , thermal effects , these are not described by the centre - of - mass equation ( [ eq-3 ] ) @xcite .",

    "the above equations are valid in any inertial frame .",
    "this means that the amount of information provided by the set of equations is _ exactly _ the same , irrespective of the chosen inertial frame  there are no privileged inertial frames and the above equations are galilean invariant .    in many situations there are forces with zero spatial displacement in a certain inertial reference frame ( e.g. the force exerted by the ground on the foot of a walking person ) . in these cases",

    "on the other hand , in the energy equation ( [ totale ] ) , which incorporates the first law of thermodynamics , one has @xmath28 and , since the bottom force does not do any work , one obtains u = -f y + q ( @xmath29 is the displacement of the force exerted by the piston ) equivalent to the well known equation @xmath30 ( here , @xmath31 is the pressure and @xmath32 is the volume ) .",
    "for a body that behaves like an elementary particle ( no rotation , no deformation , etc . ) the centre - of - mass equation and the first law of thermodynamics provide the same information .",
    "but when the body does not behave like an elementary particle , such as the gas in the cylinder , the two equations provide complementary information .    summarizing , besides the impulse - momentum equation , one has at our disposal the centre - of - mass equation and the energy equation @xcite . both equations are always valid and , therefore , they should be compatible .",
    "they may provide the same information if the problem under consideration is a purely mechanical one .",
    "however , if the situation is within the scope of thermodynamics , the second equation , which embodies the first law , is more general and provides new information with respect to the centre - of - mass equation .",
    "of course , one still needs the second law of thermodynamics , which states that , observed the first law , only processes compatible with a non - decrease of the entropy of the universe , @xmath33 , are allowed . to illustrate the usage of the impulse - momentum equation together with the centre - of - mass or with the more general energy equation , we discuss , in the next sections , a set of examples ranging from mechanics to thermodynamics .",

    "we addressed this issue , in a pedagogical way , by firstly presenting the equations and then applying them to selected examples .",
    "situations for which there is mechanical energy production are particularly interesting .",
    "these include , among others , problems related with human activities ( a person jumping , climbing , cycling , etc . ) or with living beings ( a horse pushing a chariot , etc . ) and with thermal engines ( a car that accelerates due to an internal combustion , etc . ) , which are sometimes incompletely or even incorrectly addressed .",
    "this was actually a motivation for the present work where we have discussed interesting physical situations ranging from mechanics to thermodynamics .    together with the impulse - momentum vector equation we used a scalar energy equation , which is either the centre - of - mass equation or the first law of thermodynamics , emphasizing the additional information that can be obtained from the second one with respect to the other .",
    "we also paid some attention to the frame transformation : the set of equations appropriate to discuss a problem provide the same information irrespective of the chosen inertial reference frame ( principle of relativity ) .",

    "of course , the choice of the reference frame is usually determined by the simplicity of the resulting formalism .",
    "intrinsic dissipative processes , such as processes with chains , should be related with thermodynamics when they are solved . when a chain is unwrapped or raised , a significant part of the work provided by the external force that displaces the chain is dissipated as heat , an effect that deserves formalization into an equation , and which is not included when attention is only paid to the mechanical part of the problem .",
    "we also considered a couple of examples involving forces acting without displacing their application points . in a certain reference frame , such a zero displacement force produces no work but it does have an impulse . in another inertial frame",
    "there might be both impulse and work . whenever pertinent we discussed other thermodynamical aspects , namely the irreversibility of some processes in connection with the second law .",
    "on the contrary , we have discussed the forces that act in thermodynamical processes , something that is really uncommon in thermodynamical textbooks .",
    "for instance in the joule - kelvin process the porous plug exerts a force on the gas and , even though it does not do any work , it plays a crucial role in the description of the process .    through the discussion of the five examples presented in this article we aimed at clarifying the additional information provided by the more general first law of thermodynamics with respect to newton s second law .",
