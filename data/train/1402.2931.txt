    "it is frequently the case , in physics , that an hybrid scheme , logically incomplete , turns out to be quite useful because the full theory is unknown or leads to equations that can not be solved . among the many conceivable examples of this feature , we mention the following , since they are relevant for motivating the research problem we are going to study .",
    "0.3 cm ( i ) the nonrelativistic particle in curved spacetime @xcite , where the schrodinger equation is studied , which is part of nonrelativistic quantum theory , but the potential in such equation receives a contribution from spacetime curvature , which is instead defined and studied in general relativity .",
    "0.3 cm ( ii ) quantum field theory in curved spacetime , where the right - hand side of the einstein equations is replaced by the expectation value of the regularized and renormalized energy - momentum tensor @xmath1 evaluated in a classical spacetime geometry . only at a subsequent stage",
    "does one try to consider the backreaction on the einstein tensor , which , being coupled to a nonclassical object like @xmath1 , can not remain undisturbed .",
    "0.3 cm ( iii ) the application of the effective field theory point of view to the quantization of einstein s general relativity . within this framework ,",
    "starting from the lagrangian density @xmath2 , \\label{(1.1)}\\ ] ] one includes all possible higher derivative couplings of the fields in the gravitational lagrangian . by doing so",
    ", any field singularities generated by loop diagrams can be associated with some component of the action and can be absorbed through a redefinition of the coupling constants of the theory . by treating all coupling coefficients as experimentally determined in this way , the effective field theory is finite and singularity - free at any finite order of the loop expansion @xcite , even though it remains true that einstein s gravity is not perturbatively renormalizable @xcite and not even 2-loop on - shell finite @xcite .",
    "0.3 cm ( iv ) among the many outstanding problems of classical physics and , in particular , classical celestial mechanics , the 3-body problem played a major role , and the genius of poincar himself @xcite was not enough to arrive at a complete solution .",
    "nevertheless , one finds it often of interest , for example in the analysis of the sun - earth - moon system , to consider the so - called restricted 3-body problem @xcite . in this case a body @xmath3 of mass @xmath4 and a body @xmath5 of mass @xmath6 move under their mutual attraction .",
    "the center of mass @xmath7 of the @xmath8 bodies moves uniformly in a straight line , and one can suppose it to be at rest without loss of generality .",
    "the initial conditions tell us that the orbit of @xmath5 relative to @xmath3 is a circle , hence the orbit of each body relative to @xmath7 is a circle as well .",
    "moreover , a third body , the planetoid @xmath9 , moves in the plane of motion of @xmath3 and @xmath5 . by hypothesis ,",
    "@xmath9 is subject to the newtonian attraction of @xmath3 and @xmath5 , but its mass @xmath10 is so small that it can not affect the motion of @xmath3 and @xmath5 .",
    "the problem consists therefore in evaluating the motion of @xmath9 .",
    "now when general relativity is viewed as an effective field theory , it becomes of interest to derive ( at least ) the leading classical and quantum corrections to the newtonian potential of two large nonrelativistic masses .",
    "hence we have been led to ask ourselves whether , despite the extremely small numbers involved , a quantum perspective on the restricted 3-body problem can be obtained .",
    "the question is not merely of academic interest . indeed ,",
    "on the one hand , we know already that very small quantities may produce nontrivial effects in physics .",
    "an example , among the many , is provided by the stark effect : no matter how small is the external electric field , the stark - effect hamiltonian has absolutely continuous spectrum on the whole real line @xcite , whereas the unperturbed hamiltonian for hydrogen atom has discrete spectrum on the negative half - line . yet another relevant example is provided by singular perturbations in quantum mechanics : if a one - dimensional harmonic oscillator is perturbed by a term proportional to negative powers of the position operator , then no matter how small is the weight coefficient one can not recover the original hamiltonian if the perturbation is switched off .",
    "the unperturbed hamiltonian has in fact both even and odd eigenfunctions , whereas the singular perturbation enforces the stationary states to vanish at the origin , and the latter condition survives if the perturbation gets switched off @xcite , so that one eventually recovers a sort of ` halved ' harmonic oscillator , with only half of the original eigenfunctions .    on the other hand , by virtue of the improved technology with respect to the golden age of poincar , it becomes conceivable to send off satellites in the solar system that , within our lifetime , might become part of suitable 3-body systems with the advantage , with respect to natural planetoids such as the moon , that the satellite can be ` instructed ' to approach and even nearly miss the large masses of @xmath3 and @xmath5 .",
    "hence the putative quantum corrected newtonian potential can be tested at very small distances , in circumstances which were inconceivable a century ago .",
    "section ii builds the quantum - corrected lagrangian of our model .",
    "section iii writes down the equilibrium conditions and the partial derivatives of our full potential up to the second order .",
    "section iv is devoted to the equilibrium points on the line joining @xmath3 to @xmath5 , while sec .",
    "v studies equilibrium points not lying on the line that joins @xmath3 to @xmath5 .",

    "<S> one of the outstanding problems of classical celestial mechanics was the restricted @xmath0-body problem , in which a planetoid of small mass is subject to the newtonian attraction of two celestial bodies of large mass , as it occurs , for example , in the sun - earth - moon system . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , over the last decades , a systematic investigation of quantum corrections to the newtonian potential has been carried out in the literature on quantum gravity . </S>",
    "<S> the present paper studies the effect of these tiny quantum corrections on the evaluation of equilibrium points . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that , despite the extreme smallness of the corrections , there exists no choice of sign of these corrections for which all qualitative features of the restricted @xmath0-body problem in newtonian theory remain unaffected . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , first - order stability of equilibrium points is characterized by solving a pair of algebraic equations of fifth degree , where some coefficients depend on the planck length . </S>",
    "<S> the coordinates of stable equilibrium points are slightly changed with respect to newtonian theory , because the planetoid is no longer at equal distance from the two bodies of large mass . </S>",
    "<S> the effect is conceptually interesting but too small to be observed , at least for the restricted @xmath0-body problems available in the solar system . </S>"
