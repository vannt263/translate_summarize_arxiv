    "study of soliton excitations in one - dimensional ( 1d ) systems have been attracting much attention since the pioneering work by krumhansl and schrieffer .",

    "his prediction of the soliton - induced central peak in the dynamical structure factor was confirmed experimentally , which gave rise to intensive theoretical and experimental studies . since then",
    ", soliton signatures were reliably observed in static and dynamic characteristics of various 1d magnets with both ferro- and antiferromagnetic coupling , see recent reviews .",
    "easy - plane 1d antiferromagnetic compound tmmc ( ( cd@xmath0)@xmath1nmncl@xmath0 ) in external field is one of the most widely studied materials ( see also ref .   and references therein ) .",
    "its magnetic ions have spin @xmath2 , and thus it is believed that the dynamics of tmmc can be well described on the basis of classical equations of motion for the sublattice magnetization .",
    "it is well known that in presence of a strong magnetic field the equations of motion for antiferromagnet are rather complicated and can not be reduced to the sine - gordon ( sg ) model because of the importance of out - of - plane deviations .",
    "effective field - induced anisotropy competes with the easy - plane anisotropy , so that at certain critical field @xmath3 ( where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the exchange and anisotropy fields , respectively ) in - plane and out - of - plane magnon modes have equal excitation energies , and the sg approximation becomes obviously inadequate for @xmath6 close to @xmath7 .    at @xmath8",
    "the `` easy plane '' effectively changes .",
    "there are , respectively , two types of static kink solutions , one of which has lower energy at @xmath9 and the other at @xmath10 .",
    "corresponding dynamic solutions are much less understood .",
    "different authors obtained contradictory results concerning their stability .",
    "it was shown that the effective plane of rotation of the sublattice magnetization in a kink depends on the kink velocity , and the two types of kinks transform into each other at some critical velocity @xmath11 , @xmath12 at @xmath13 .    the main feature of the problem , determining kink stability and dynamics in strong magnetic fields , is the presence of out - of plane magnon mode localized at the kink .",
    "this internal mode is highly nonlinear at @xmath14 and strongly coupled to the `` translational '' ( zero ) mode of the kink motion , @xcite which makes its analysis rather complicated .",
    "moreover , it can be shown that because of the relatively small effective mass of solitons [ the ratio of soliton and magnon masses is @xmath15 for antiferromagnet , while for ferromagnets this ratio is proportional to the large parameter @xmath16 the dynamics of internal soliton degrees of freedom in antiferromagnets is essentially quantum even for `` almost classical '' values of @xmath15 like @xmath17 @xcite and exhibits subtle effects distinguishing between integer and half - integer @xmath15 .",
    "@xcite thus , to our opinion , the internal dynamics of solitons in tmmc in a strong - field regime can be highly nontrivial , and its consistent description , as well as experimental observation , is a fascinating problem .",
    "in this paper we present a detailed theoretical study of the soliton dynamics in 1d `` almost - classical '' spin-@xmath15 easy - plane antiferromagnet in strong external magnetic field close to the critical value @xmath7 .",
    "we show that quantum effects ( tunneling between two energetically equivalent kink states ) lead to appearance of a new localized mode which is also coupled to the translational mode and thus depends on the soliton momentum @xmath18 . at @xmath19",
    "the tunneling is suppressed for half - integer @xmath15 due to the topological effects , but at nonzero @xmath18 it becomes possible for any @xmath15 .",
    "we calculate the contribution of the localized modes into the dynamic structure factor ( dsf ) and show that it leads to an additional peak concentrated at nonzero frequency , which can be detected by electron spin resonance ( esr ) or inelastic neutron scattering ( ins ) technique .",
    "numerical estimations of the corresponding resonance frequencies and the peak properties for tmmc are given .",
    "to the knowledge of authors , at present the only known experiment probing internal soliton modes is the so - called `` soliton magnetic resonance '' in the ising - type quasi-1d antiferromagnet cscocl@xmath0 , and no such data exist for the heisenberg magnets .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : model ] we introduce the model . in sect .",
    "[ sec : internal - classic ] we derive an effective model of internal kink dynamics , perform classical linear analysis of the spectrum of excitations against the background of kinks and discuss the soliton stability problem , and in sect .",
    "[ sec : internal - quantum ] we perform quantization of the effective model and discuss the behavior of the energy levels of localized modes . in sect .",
    "[ sec : dsf ] the soliton contribution to the response functions is considered , and numerical estimations of predicted effects for tmmc are given .",
    "finally , sec .",
    "[ sec : summary ] contains concluding remarks .",
    "we consider a one - dimensional two - sublattice heisenberg antiferromagnet ( afm ) of the tmmc type in external magnetic field .",
    "this system is well described by the following hamiltonian : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the exchange constant , @xmath22 is the bohr magneton , @xmath23 is the lande factor , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are anisotropy constants , @xmath26 , @xmath27 is the magnetic field , and spins @xmath28 are treated as classical vectors . in absence of the field @xmath29 is an easy plane , and @xmath30 is the easiest axis in this plane ( the case of `` pure '' easy - plane afm corresponds to @xmath31 ) ; the chain axis is along @xmath32 .",
    "for tmmc the value of the spin is @xmath33 , and the following values for the parameters of the classical hamiltonian have been established : @xmath34  k , @xmath35  k , @xmath36  k , and @xmath37 .",
    "long - wavelength dynamics of afm can be described within the nonlinear sigma model approach .",
    "it is convenient to introduce the antiferromagnetism vector ( the sublattice magnetization ) @xmath38 at each magnetic elementary cell . at low temperatures , when the magnetization @xmath39 is small , @xmath40 can be regarded as a unit vector , and after passing to the continuum limit the following lagrangian can be obtained : @xmath41 its derivation from different points of view the reader can find in refs .",
    "; this approach is closely related to the commonly used mikeska s formulation .",
    "@xcite here @xmath42 is the lattice spacing , @xmath43 is the limiting velocity of spin waves , @xmath44 is the gyromagnetic ratio , @xmath45^{1/2}$ ] and @xmath46 are the characteristic length scales .",
    "the last term in ( [ lagr ] ) is the so - called topological term which can be rewritten as @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the pontryagin index ( the winding number ) of a given space - time configuration of the field @xmath40 .",
    "this term is irrelevant in classical analysis , but is very important for the quantum theory since it distinguishes between integer and half - integer @xmath15 .    within this approximation ,",
    "the vector of magnetization @xmath49 is a `` slave '' variable and can be expressed through the antiferromagnetism vector @xmath40 : @xmath50    further , it is convenient to introduce angular variables for the vector @xmath40 .",
    "we choose the easiest axis @xmath30 as a polar one , and put @xmath51 let us set the field in plane perpendicular to the easy axis , @xmath52 , then @xmath30 is always the easiest axis , and there is no spin - flop transition . however , at @xmath8 , where @xmath53 the axes @xmath54 and @xmath32 switch their roles : the easy plane is @xmath55 when @xmath9 , and @xmath56 when @xmath10 . in this paper , we consider the case of strong fields @xmath57 ; for tmmc the critical field is of the order of 100  koe . in what follows",
    ", we can safely neglect any contribution coming from @xmath58 because in strong fields the field - induced anisotropy in the basal plane is much larger than the initial crystal - field anisotropy .",
    "hereafter , we assume that the field is close to @xmath59 , and regard the quantity @xmath60 as a small parameter playing the role of effective rhombicity ( as far as only static properties are considered , @xmath61 corresponds to a `` uniaxial '' situation ) .",
    "because of the presence of magnetic field , the equations of motion for the model ( [ lagr ] ) contain not only the usual lorentz - invariant terms , but also terms of the first order in time derivatives , and thus their analysis is rather complicated .",
    "however , one can easily find static soliton solutions .",
    "there are two types of static kinks , with @xmath40 rotating in the @xmath29 plane ( @xmath62 ) or in the @xmath63 plane ( @xmath64 ) .",
    "the behavior of the angle @xmath65 in both kinks is given by @xmath66 where the kink thickness is @xmath67 for the @xmath63-kink and @xmath68 for the @xmath29-kink , and @xmath69 is an ( arbitrary ) kink coordinate . for @xmath9",
    "the kink with @xmath62 is the lowest energy nonlinear excitation , and for @xmath10 this role goes to the kink with @xmath64 ; at @xmath8 their energies are equal , as well as the energies of in - plane and out - of - plane magnon branches .    as it was shown in refs .",
    ", approximate soliton solutions can be constructed using the following trick : one can easily see that the characteristic scale of @xmath70 variation @xmath71 is much larger than the characteristic thickness of the kink @xmath72 . then , `` within the kink , '' i.e. , within the region where the variation of @xmath65 mainly takes place , we can neglect spatial dependence of @xmath70 and put @xmath73 .",
    "we use the same trick , but regard @xmath69 and @xmath74 as new dynamic variables slowly varying in time : we assume that the soliton solution has the form @xmath75 here @xmath76 is the topological charge distinguishing kinks and antikinks . substituting the ansatz ( [ ansatz ] ) into the lagrangian ( [ lagr ] ) and assuming that @xmath69 and @xmath74 are `` slow '' variables , i.e. @xmath77 one can obtain the following effective lagrangian with only two degrees of freedom : @xmath78 here the dot denotes differentiation with respect to time , and @xmath79 is a characteristic energy scale ( rest energy of a soliton at @xmath61 ) .",
    "the last term in the lagrangian comes from the topological term in ( [ lagr ] ) and is ineffective in classical treatment since it is a complete derivative .",
    "however , in quantum treatment it changes the definition of canonical momentum conjugate to @xmath74 which is very important , as we will see below .",
    "the effective potential for the internal variable @xmath74 strongly depends on the kink velocity @xmath80 .",
    "one can see that a classical analysis of the effective lagrangian ( [ leff ] ) allows one to reproduce the results of a more rigorous approach of refs .   which we briefly revisit below .",
    "the canonical momentum @xmath18 conjugate to @xmath69 , @xmath81 is conserved , and thus it is convenient to express everything in terms of @xmath18 .",
    "the effective potential @xmath82 has four extrema as a function of @xmath74 , at @xmath83 and at @xmath84 , where @xmath85 are two roots of the equation @xmath86 extrema at @xmath83 correspond to @xmath63-kinks , and extrema at @xmath84 correspond to @xmath29-type kinks . when the velocity of an @xmath29-type kink is zero , the plane of rotation of the vector @xmath40 is @xmath29 , and this plane smoothly changes to @xmath63 when @xmath18 tends to @xmath87 , so that @xmath29-type kink smoothly transforms into a @xmath63-kink .",
    "the frequency of linear oscillations around those extrema is given by @xmath88 where @xmath89 thus , @xmath29-type kinks are stable in the entire region @xmath90 where the corresponding solutions ( [ xy - kink ] ) have sense .",
    "the stability of @xmath63-kinks depends on @xmath18 and on the sign of the quantity @xmath91 : @xmath63-kinks with @xmath92 are stable at @xmath93 , and those with @xmath94 are stable at @xmath95 . for each @xmath63-kink there exist two possible `` daughter '' @xmath29-type kinks , corresponding to the two possible solutions @xmath85 , so that the transition from @xmath63-kink to @xmath29-kink when @xmath96 drops below @xmath87 is a spontaneous breaking of symmetry .    the dispersion relation for soliton excitations , i.e. the dependennce of their energy @xmath97 on the momentum @xmath18 , is schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : levels ] ( the curve labeled `` classical '' ) . for @xmath98 , i.e. @xmath99 the minimal energy is reached at @xmath19 , while at @xmath100 ( @xmath101 ) the minimum is located at @xmath102 ; in both cases the second derivative @xmath103 is discontinuous at @xmath104 .",
    "it should be remarked that the effective model ( [ leff ] ) was derived under the assumption that the variable @xmath74 is `` slow , '' and therefore expressions ( [ omega - loc ] ) have sense only if @xmath105 .",
    "this does not matter , however , for the classical analysis of stability presented above , because the corresponding frequencies are small in the vicinity of the transition .",
    "but what does matter is ( i ) strong nonlinearity : in linear analysis the localized mode frequency is zero at @xmath106 , which indicates that anharmonic terms have to be taken into account ; ( ii ) quantum effects : the magnitude of quantum zero - point fluctuations around the classical minima of the effective potential strongly increases when the potential well becomes `` flat . ''",
    "since the effective model ( [ leff ] ) contains only two degrees of freedom , one can easily quantize it in a canonical way .",
    "the lagrangian does not depend on @xmath69 and thus the total momentum @xmath18 is conserved and can be treated as a @xmath107-number , so that we are left with only one variable @xmath74 .",
    "the hamiltonian can be easily obtained in the form @xmath108 where @xmath15 in curly brackets appears because the last term in ( [ lagr ] ) changes the definition of the angular momentum .",
    "as we will see below , the presence of this term changes the situation drastically depending on whether @xmath15 is integer or half - integer . for the wavefunction @xmath109 one",
    "has usual periodic boundary conditions @xmath110 .",
    "the effective potential @xmath111 is generally two - well , with energetically equivalent well minima ; at @xmath19 the minima are located at @xmath112 , as @xmath18 deviates from zero they both move towards @xmath113 or @xmath114 depending on the sign of @xmath18 and the ` generalized ' topological charge @xmath115 , and at @xmath104 they merge into one well at @xmath116 or @xmath114 .",
    "one may expect that tunneling between equivalent minima at @xmath117 splits the lowest energy levels , leading to the appearance of one more internal soliton mode .",
    "however , using arguments of the same type as in refs .",
    ", it is easy to show that at @xmath19 the tunneling is possible only for integer @xmath15 .",
    "indeed , the tunneling amplitude is proportional to the path integral @xmath118 where @xmath85 are the well minima and the effective lagrangian is defined by eq .",
    "( [ leff ] ) . since @xmath119 contains the topological term @xmath120 , different paths contribute with the phase factor proportional to @xmath121 , where @xmath122 is the change in @xmath74 along the path . at @xmath19 one has two equivalent paths with @xmath123 , so that their contributions cancel each other for half - integer @xmath15 ( recall that in case of tmmc @xmath33 ) . if @xmath124 , the two paths become inequivalent , thus allowing nonzero tunneling amplitude .    the schrdinger equation with the hamiltonian ( [ heff ] ) can be easily solved numerically , and one gets the energy eigenvalues as functions of the soliton momentum @xmath18 ; a typical level structure is shown in fig.[fig : levels ] .",
    "all states at fixed @xmath18 @xmath125 can be labeled with two quantum numbers @xmath126 and @xmath127 ( @xmath127 being the parity of the `` reduced '' wavefunction @xmath128 ) , and for half - integer @xmath15 odd and even states are degenerate at @xmath19 .",
    "one can see that quantum effects change the soliton dispersion considerably comparing to the classical calculation ; particularly , the dispersion tends to have a minimum at nonzero @xmath18 even for fields lower than @xmath59 , -0.1 in -0.2 in 0.1inwhich means that @xmath59 is effectively renormalized towards its decrease .",
    "this renormalization is not small , as seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : levels ] , since at @xmath129 the lowest energy is still reached at @xmath124 .",
    "unfortunately , we are not able to calculate this renormalization quantitatively : first of all , our effective model is valid only at small @xmath130 , and second , there are other quantum effects influencing the effective soliton energy ( the change in the energy of zero - point fluctuations of magnon modes in presence of a kink ) which are not considered here ; the interested reader is referred for details to the original papers and to the recent review .",
    "the lowest excitations of internal soliton mode clearly have purely quantum nature , i.e. , they do not have any classical counterpart , and are determined by the tunnel level splitting .",
    "in this section we apply the results obtained so far to find out how the excitation of internal soliton degrees of freedom contributes into the response functions of easy - plane antiferromagnet in a strong - field regime ( @xmath6 close to @xmath7 ) .",
    "we wish to begin with a remark concerning the relation between the gap in the spectrum of linear excitations @xmath131 and the kink rest energy @xmath132 in various soliton - bearing systems . for the model of structural phase transition used by krumhansl and schrieffer @xmath133 , and @xmath134 , where @xmath135 is the magnitude of the order parameter , so that near the transition point @xmath136 , which justifies neglecting kink - phonon interaction at @xmath137 in ref .  .",
    "for ferromagnets one obtains @xmath138 , where @xmath139 and @xmath140 are the exchange and anisotropy constants , respectively . in case of the heisenberg magnets @xmath141 , and @xmath142 , so that the inequality @xmath143 , usually assumed in soliton - gas calculations , can be easily satisfied . for antiferromagnets the situation is `` intermediate '' : @xmath144 , and the inequality @xmath145 holds only for @xmath146 . the relation @xmath147 is often used as a condition under which a quantum spin system can be treated classically , but in actual practice the strong inequality is not needed , and classical equations of motion work well , say , for @xmath2 , as in case of tmmc .",
    "thus , in antiferromagnets for realistic @xmath15 values @xmath132 is only a few times greater than @xmath148 , and usually used condition @xmath143 is not valid as a strong inequality .",
    "( for example , in case of strong fields close to @xmath7 the characteristic values of kink energy and magnon gap for tmmc are @xmath149  k and @xmath150  k , respectively ) .",
    "to justify the phenomenological approach to the soliton thermodynamics , the only necessary condition is smallness of the kink gas density @xmath151 comparing to the inverse kink thickness @xmath152 .",
    "this means smallness of the exponent @xmath153 , i.e. , practically , it is sufficient that @xmath154 . therefore , for antiferromagnets instead of a strong inequality @xmath155 one must consider the converse condition @xmath156 .",
    "the most general quantity determining the response functions is the so - called dynamical structure factor ( dsf ) @xmath157 , which is essentially the space - time fourier component of the two - spin correlation function @xmath158 . in case of antiferromagnet ,",
    "the quantities of interest are ( i ) the dsf component at @xmath159 , describing the intensity of response in electron spin resonance ( esr ) experiments ; ( ii ) the dsf component at @xmath160 , where @xmath161 is the bragg wavevector , which is usually measured in inelastic neutron scattering ( ins ) experiments . the main contribution to",
    "the dsf at @xmath162 comes from the correlator of the antiferromagnetism vector @xmath163 , and the component at @xmath159 is determined by the correlator of magnetization @xmath164 .",
    "@xcite soliton contribution to the correlation functions can be calculated using the approximation of the soliton ideal gas,@xcite which means that at low density of kinks the main role is played by one - soliton correlations .",
    "then one has to deal with correlators of the form @xmath165 where @xmath166 and @xmath167 are generally certain operators .",
    "the average should be taken in both quantum - mechanical and thermodynamic senses .",
    "quantum - mechanical averaging is performed with the wavefunctions @xmath168 ( we use the notation @xmath169 for the sake of brevity ) , and the thermodynamic average should be performed with the gibbs distribution function @xmath170 where @xmath171 is normalized to the total density of solitons , and the quantity @xmath172 is the change in the free energy of the magnon gas due to the presence of a kink , which is attributed to the kink in the phenomenological approach : @xmath173\\;.\\ ] ] here @xmath174 labels different branches of magnons of the continuous spectrum , and @xmath175 are the frequencies of corresponding modes .",
    "the change in the magnon density of states @xmath176 is connected with the phase shift @xmath177 acquired by a magnon of the @xmath178-th branch with wavevector @xmath179 after its interaction with the kink having quantum numbers @xmath180 , @xmath18 : @xmath181 .",
    "[ in fact , @xmath182 contains divergent terms connected with the change in the energy of zero - point vibrations between the ground state and the one - soliton state .",
    "this divergence , however , is compensated by the counterterms arising from the normal ordering of operators , yielding finite quantum correction to the soliton energy . ]    using the above arguments , expression ( [ corr ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath183 where @xmath184 . at low temperatures @xmath185",
    "one may take into account only the contribution of the lowest two soliton levels @xmath186 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : levels ] ) .    at @xmath187",
    ", @xmath182 is proportional to @xmath188 and can be neglected . at @xmath189",
    "the effect of @xmath190 becomes significant ; its accurate calculation requires solving the soliton - magnon scattering problem to get the phase shifts , which is too complicated to be done analytically .",
    "however , @xmath191-type solitons , i.e. kinks with @xmath192 , classically have @xmath83 , thus being `` sine - gordon '' in structure , and the phase shifts for the sine - gordon ( sg ) problem are known .",
    "in this case @xmath193 at small kink velocities @xmath194 , and for @xmath195 we obtain the well - known sg result @xmath196 on the other hand , the same sg result should be valid for @xmath55-solitons with @xmath19 .",
    "we will assume that the same expression can be applied for all @xmath18 ; this assumption seems plausible though it can not be justified in a rigorous way .",
    "one can expect that possible weak dependence of @xmath172 will lead to certain renormalization of the @xmath18-dependence of the soliton energy levels @xmath197 , but we believe that our results will remain qualitatively correct .      the static component of magnetization @xmath49 , according to ( [ m ] ) , is directed along the @xmath198 axis .",
    "let us assume that the pumping rf field is parallel to @xmath199 , then the intensity of the esr signal is proportional to @xmath200 and is determined by the correlator of @xmath201 .",
    "it is easy to see that only the first term in @xmath201 , according to ( [ m ] ) , contributes to @xmath200 at nonzero frequencies [ the last term in ( [ m ] ) does not depend on @xmath74 and thus yields the delta function in @xmath202 , and the contribution from the second term just vanishes because at @xmath159 the corresponding formfactor @xmath203 in ( [ aver ] ) is zero ] .",
    "thus , the significant term in @xmath201 is proportional to @xmath204 , and @xmath205 , according to ( [ leff ] ) is proportional to @xmath206 , where @xmath207 is the operator of the canonical momentum conjugate to @xmath74 .",
    "again , @xmath208 yields @xmath209 , so that the only contribution at nonzero @xmath202 comes from @xmath210 . typical plots of the esr response depending on frequency for @xmath33 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : esr ] ; one can see that the transitions between @xmath211 and @xmath212 soliton levels lead to a pronounced peak with a maximum located well below the antiferromagnetic resonance frequency @xmath213 .",
    "since the levels @xmath211 and @xmath212 have different minima in their @xmath18 dependencies , the position of peaks in the esr response at positive and negative @xmath202 is also different .",
    "when the temperature increases , peaks shift towards @xmath213 , but still keep their shape with a clearly pronounced maximum .",
    "thus we expect that this effect can be really observable experimentally in tmmc , where at @xmath61 the three - dimensional ordering temperature @xmath214k , i.e. about @xmath215 .      in neutron experiments",
    ", it is usually possible to measure either longitudinal ( with respect to the magnetic field ) dsf component @xmath216 , or the transverse -0.1 in -0.2 in 0.1inone @xmath217 , with @xmath218 close to the bragg wavevector @xmath161 . in tmmc , both those components exhibit presence of the soliton central peak . in the transverse dsf",
    "the dominating contribution comes from @xmath219 ( which corresponds to the contribution of flips of the direction of the antiferromagnetism vector @xmath40 along the easy axis @xmath220 ) , and @xmath219 is insensitive to the effects of internal modes because @xmath221 does not depend on @xmath74 ; that is why we will be interested only in the longitudinal component @xmath222 determined by the correlator of @xmath223 . fig .",
    "[ fig : dsf ] shows several typical plots of @xmath224 for different values of the field and temperature ( actually , we have also calculated @xmath225 for a few values of @xmath218 close to @xmath161 , but the resulting curves exhibit very weak @xmath218 dependence , so that we restrict ourselves to presenting only plots for @xmath162 ) .",
    "one can see that the most significant manifestation of internal soliton modes is a nonzero width of the central peak ( cp ) -0.1 in -0.2 in 0.1inat @xmath162 ( recall that in the standard ideal - gas calculation @xcite without taking into account internal degrees of freedom the cp width for the longitudinal component is proportional to @xmath226 ) .",
    "however , it should be mentioned that the effects of soliton - magnon and soliton - soliton scattering , which we do not consider here , also lead to nonzero cp width at @xmath162 , @xcite and therefore it may be problematic to separate those two contributions experimentally .",
    "the additional peak at nonzero frequency is also present in @xmath222 , but with increasing temperature it quickly gets smeared by the tails of the dominating central peak ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : dsf]b ) , and in tmmc at @xmath57 for @xmath227 this peak should be almost completely suppressed .",
    "we consider the problem of soliton dynamics in 1d `` almost - classical '' spin-@xmath15 easy - plane antiferromagnet in strong external magnetic field , taking into account internal degrees of freedom of solitons .",
    "we show that quantum effects of tunneling between two energetically equivalent kink states lead to level splitting for all values of @xmath15 ; the usual selection rule * * ? ? ?",
    "* * which prohibits the tunnelling for half - integer @xmath15 is lifted due to the strong coupling between internal and translational modes .",
    "it is predicted that this internal mode can be detected in tmmc [ ( cd@xmath0)@xmath1nmncl@xmath0 ] by means of the electron spin resonance ( esr ) or inelastic neutron scattering ( ins ) technique ; we also show that esr is a preferable method because the corresponding resonance peak is much more pronounced comparing to that in the ins response .",
