    "three necessary steps for weak measurements are : ( 1 ) preselection of a quantum state ; ( 2 ) weak interaction between the system and the measuring device ; ( 3 ) postselection of a quantum state .",
    "we consider weak measurement of polarization of an optical pulse and the energy of the pulse takes the role of the measuring device .",

    "@xmath19 denotes the polarization state of the probe pulse and can be written as @xmath20 which is equivalent to the preselection of polarization .",
    "note that the circular polarization states @xmath21 make the eigen - basis of the pauli spin - matrix @xmath22 : @xmath23 .    in presence of the control field",
    ", these two polarization components propagate with different group velocities through the atomic medium .",
    "this can be explained as follows .",
    "when the central frequency of the probe pulse is in near resonance with @xmath24 transition , the control field , resonant with the @xmath25 transition makes an electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) window for the @xmath26 polarization component .",
    "this is also associated with a large normal dispersion and hence a slow group velocity of this component .",
    "a magnetic field can be applied to remove the degeneracy of the ground and the excited state manifold .",
    "this makes the @xmath27 component far from resonance from the @xmath28 transition .",
    "therefore the dispersion profile for this component exhibits a much flatter behavior in the frequency domain , leading to its group velocity not too different from @xmath29 , the velocity of light in vacuum .",
    "because of the difference in the group velocities inside the medium , the two circularly polarized components come out of the medium at different times with negligible absorption . in this way , the medium temporally separates the two orthogonal polarization components of the input pulse .      in this paper , we focus on a situation where the temporal separation @xmath2 between circular polarized components is much smaller than the width of the pulse such that the detector can not resolve between these two components in time - domain i.e. @xmath30 , @xmath31 being the temporal resolution of the detector . because , the group velocities are proportional to the number density @xmath32 of the atomic medium , such a situation would arise when @xmath32 is sufficiently small . in this paper , we consider @xmath33 . note that this situation mimics a weak interaction between the light pulse and the atomic medium , that plays the role of a measuring device for the polarization state of the pulse .    for negligible absorption ,",
