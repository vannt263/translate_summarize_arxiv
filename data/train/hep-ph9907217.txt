    "glueballs , bound color - singlet states of gluons , are a well - known prediction of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) and have long been sought in the mesonic spectrum .",
    "three popular , glue - rich environments have been the focus of this search .",
    "the most promising is radiative @xmath1 decay , @xmath2 , in which the @xmath3 pair decays to hadrons predominantly through two - gluon intermediate states .",
    "a second possibility is the annihilation into gluons of one or two @xmath4 pairs in @xmath5 collisions ( e.g. , @xmath6 ) .",
    "a third environment for glueball production is central @xmath7 collisions , where gluon - gluon fusion processes should be abundant ; glueball creation in this mode is expected to proceed via double pomeron exchange , with the pomeron presumed to be a multi - gluon color singlet .",
    "a fourth , related venue for glueball production is in peripheral heavy ion collisions .",
    "although central collisions of heavy ions at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) at brookhaven and the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern will form the frontlines in the search for a quark - gluon plasma , their large center - of - mass energies ( as high as 100 gev / nucleon at rhic and 3.5 tev / nucleon at the lhc ) should allow access to the regge region @xmath8 and thence to the production of glueballs in peripheral collisions by strong double diffractive scattering , i.e. , pomeron - pomeron ( @xmath9 ) exchange .",
    "one popular glueball candidate is the @xmath10 meson , which is produced in radiative @xmath1 decay at a rate of about 1 part in @xmath11 .",
    "there is some disagreement regarding the spin of this resonance@xcite , including evidence for two overlapping states obscuring one another@xcite .",
    "nevertheless , lattice qcd calculations have provided evidence identifying the oft - suspected @xmath10 as a scalar glueball with little or no admixture of valence quark  anti - quark pairs @xcite .",
    "moreover , recent analysis of radiative @xmath1 decay indicates that as a @xmath4 state , the rate of @xmath10 production is consistent only with @xmath12 ; for @xmath13 the production rate is too high for a pure @xmath4 state , but is compatible with a glueball or mixed @xmath4-glueball@xcite .",
    "this strengthens the claim for a ground state scalar glueball in the 1700 mev range . as such",
    ", the production and study of the @xmath0 could provide an important testing ground for qcd .    in this paper",
    "we discuss the production of @xmath14 mesons via pomeron - pomeron and photon - photon interactions in peripheral heavy ion collisions at both rhic and the lhc .",
    "in addition to pomerons , these facilities will also endow the colliding nuclei with large virtual photon luminosities ; since gluons are charge neutral , however , @xmath15 production of glueballs will not occur to leading order .",
    "nonetheless , such large photon luminosities raise the prospect of studying electromagnetic particle production via two photon interactions @xcite , and despite the expectation that the contribution from the @xmath15 mode is small , it will interfere constructively with the @xmath9 process .",
    "perhaps more importantly , just as one can calculate such @xmath15 processes in an equivalent photon approximation , one can construct by analogy an `` equivalent pomeron approximation '' for @xmath9 exchange@xcite .",
    "thus we begin in sec .",
    "ii with a review of the method of virtual quanta as applied to photons and pomerons .",
    "although the equivalent photon approximation is well known , we review the main features in order to facilitate comparison with equivalent pomerons ; the presentation will follow the outline of earlier work on the subject @xcite .",
    "we also discuss the impact parameter dependence of the two - photon and two - pomeron processes , complementing earlier work by natale @xcite . in sec .",
    "iii we present our results for both photon - photon and pomeron - pomeron interactions , including the effects of nuclear absorption .",
    "we consider the production of a state @xmath16 of large invariant mass @xmath17 by the exchange of two virtual quanta from the scattering nuclei .",
    "let @xmath18 be the invariant masses and energies of the exchanged quanta , @xmath19 the four - momenta of the two nuclei before and after the collision , and @xmath20 their invariant masses .",
    "we assume that the nuclei remain in their ground state , i.e. , the collision is elastic with respect to the scattering nuclei .",
    "the relevant four - momentum can then be expressed as @xmath21 where the notation for the various particle momenta is explained in figure 1 . in the high - energy limit , @xmath22 , we have @xmath23 which together give @xmath24 leading to the useful relation @xmath25    in the spirit of the equivalent photon approximation @xcite , for ion beams @xmath26 and @xmath27 with squared center of mass energy @xmath28 we write the cross section for either photon - photon or pomeron - pomeron fusion to a neutral state @xmath29 in the form @xmath30 in this expression @xmath31 is the distribution function for finding a quantum @xmath32 with energy fraction @xmath33 in the nucleus . the production cross section for the subprocess @xmath34 with squared center - of - mass energy @xmath35",
    "is given by@xcite @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the spin of the state @xmath29 and @xmath38 is the partial two-@xmath32 decay width of @xmath29 .",
    "for the photon case ( @xmath39 ) , the @xmath40-nucleus vertex is given by @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the elastic nuclear form factor and @xmath43 is the invariant four - momentum exchanged .",
    "then the distribution function @xmath44 for a fast moving nucleus of charge @xmath45 , mass @xmath46 , and nucleon number @xmath26 is @xcite @xmath47 where we have used equation ( 7 ) . approximating @xmath48 by the gaussian @xmath49 we see that the form factor imposes a cutoff @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the nuclear radius .",
    "thus for identical nuclei , a heavy state of invariant mass @xmath17 can be produced as long as @xmath52 .",
    "this is essentially the condition for coherence : the photon wavelength must be larger than the lorentz  contracted nuclear radius .",
    "coherence leads to the factor of @xmath53 in @xmath44 ( compounded to @xmath54 in the cross section ) , rendering electromagnetic interactions of high-@xmath45 ions an effective tool for the production of heavy neutral particles .    turning next to the pomeron ( @xmath55 )",
    ", we distinguish the exclusive process of figure 1 from the inclusive process shown in figure 2 . considering the pomeron as a two gluon ladder ,",
    "the exclusive case requires one of the gluons of each pomeron to fuse .",
    "such a process warrants a full gluon ladder calculation , and almost certainly yields a small rate .",
    "by contrast , inclusive production puts no restrictions upon the two remaining gluons , which are soft on average , and a ladder calculation may not be necessary .",
    "moreover , the inclusive rate should be larger than that for exclusive production , and is the process that will be seen first .",
    "we thus proceed for pomerons by considering only inclusive production .    as such",
    ", we are interested in the so - called `` soft pomeron '' , considered to be an effective description of a highly correlated gluon exchange with a structure determined by nonperturbative properties of the qcd vacuum .",
    "one begins with the regge trajectory @xmath56 where @xmath57 and @xmath58 gev@xmath59 .",
    "this trajectory has an intercept close to 1 , suggesting that the pomeron behaves like a spin - one boson in processes in which the exchanged four - momentum squared @xmath60 is small .",
    "pomeron exchange can thus be described as an isoscalar `` photon '' , with propagator at high c.m .",
    "energy given by @xcite , @xmath61 is the regge scale parameter and @xmath62 is the pomeron range parameter ( see appendix ) , @xmath63 following donnachie and landshoff @xcite , we denote the nucleon - pomeron coupling by @xmath64 where the quark - pomeron coupling @xmath65 is @xmath66 and @xmath67 is the isoscalar magnetic nucleon form factor . for nucleus - pomeron interaction ,",
    "we appeal to the additivity of the total nucleon - nucleon cross sections and replace @xmath65 by @xmath68 and @xmath67 by the elastic nuclear form factor @xmath69 .",
    "of course , a linear dependence of the nucleus - pomeron coupling on @xmath26 is too strong : while it may be appropriate for a hard process involving at least 100 gev , for the softer process considered here shadowing will moderate the coupling to scale like @xmath70 with @xmath71 . for small @xmath33 , where the method of equivalent quanta applies , @xmath72 @xcite .",
    "we will nevertheless use the linear coupling for simplicity and apply this suppression to the resulting cross sections .    for inclusive glueball production ,",
    "the distribution function for finding a pomeron in the nucleus with energy fraction @xmath33 is then given by @xcite @xmath73 where @xmath74 denotes the invariant subprocess with which the pomeron participates , i.e. , @xmath75 for the pomeron emitted by nucleus 1 , @xmath76 for the pomeron emitted by nucleus 2 .",
    "being concerned with inclusive production , an additional step is required between the subprocess cross section @xmath77 called for in equation ( 8) and the exclusive form advocated in equation ( 9 ) . specifically , we replace equation ( 9 ) with @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the gluon structure function of the pomeron and @xmath80 is the squared center - of - mass energy of the two-@xmath81 system .",
    "the gluonic glueball production cross section needed in equation ( 19 ) is now given by @xmath82 which differs from equation ( 9 ) only by a factor of @xmath83 due to averaging over initial color states .",
    "as for @xmath79 , experimental investigation into the partonic structure of the pomeron indicates that most of the pomeron momentum is carried by hard gluons @xcite , favoring a structure function of the form @xmath84 this , however , raises other concerns . as the mass @xmath17 of the produced particle decreases , a structure function approach to the glue content of the pomeron becomes invalid : without a large momentum scale one can not fully justify a parton model formalism .",
    "( indeed , structure functions such as ( 21 ) are obtained from data with large @xmath85 jets which serve as the scale for a perturbative approach . )",
    "just how small @xmath17 must be before the approach is no longer reliable is an open question , but it seems not unreasonable to be suspicious for @xmath86 gev .",
    "thus the calculation presented here is not intended to be truly predictive ; rather , it is offered as an order of magnitude estimate in a first attempt to see if the experiment makes sense . in order to get an idea how sensitive the results are to the choice of structure function",
    ", the calculation was performed not only using @xmath79 as in ( 21 ) , but with two invented structure functions as well , one softer the other harder than ( 21 ) , @xmath87    although we have now assembled the expressions required by equation ( 8) , a practical consideration remains . in order to obtain a clean glueball signal , it is important that the cross section remain viable out to impact parameters greater than roughly twice the nuclear radii  in other words , that the heavy ions engage in peripheral collisions . to calculate the impact parameter dependence of the cross section , we write the total @xmath88 exchange cross section ( 8) in the impact parameter representation and",
    "fold it with the probability that no inelastic interaction takes place other than double-@xmath32 exchange .",
    "the dependence of the cross section on the impact parameter @xmath89 is then found by integrating the squared matrix element over all spacetime coordinates save for the transverse distance @xmath89 between nuclei @xcite .",
    "the key ingredient in this recipe is the effective @xmath32-@xmath29 coupling , which depends on the spin and parity of @xmath29 .",
    "if we denote the vertex by @xmath90 and in the high - energy limit keep only the transverse polarizations of the @xmath32 s , the coupling of a scalar @xmath29 to the coherent nuclear current can be expressed in the form @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the spin - averaged invariant matrix element for the process @xmath34 .",
    "the factor @xmath93 would be replaced @xmath94 for a pseudoscalar @xmath29 .",
    "the different forms of @xmath90 for a number of other possible spin - parity states @xmath29 can be easily deduced from the list of two - photon helicity amplitudes given in @xcite .",
    "this procedure , together with the gaussian form factor ( 12 ) , results in straightforward calculations for the differential cross sections . for completeness",
    ", we display below expressions for both @xmath13 and @xmath95 .",
    "( note that for @xmath12 , the @xmath96 helicity states in @xmath97 have been observed to dominate @xcite , a phenomenon that can be understood in the context of tensor meson dominance @xcite .",
    "thus when treating the @xmath0 as a @xmath98 state , the helicity zero contributions can be neglected , greatly simplifying @xmath90 . )    for @xmath15 exchange , we get the general expression @xmath99 where we have defined @xmath100 with @xmath101 \\\\",
    "b_n(x ) & = & e^{-x^2m^2/q_0 ^ 2}\\int_0^\\infty~d\\xi~\\xi^n~       \\frac{e^{-\\xi}}{\\sqrt{a(a - b ) } }   ~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath102    the expressions are simpler for @xmath9 exchange , allowing much of the integration to be performed analytically ; for identical nuclei , we find @xmath103 where @xmath104 .",
    "since the pomeron propagator is a gaussian , the choice of a gaussian nuclear form factor allows the impact parameter dependence to be determined exactly .",
    "the differential cross section for @xmath13 is found to be @xmath105 whereas @xmath106 for @xmath12 . in both these expressions , we have defined @xmath107",
    "in order to derive numerical values for these cross sections , estimates for the two - photon and two - gluon decay widths are needed . determining these widths",
    ", however , depends upon whether the state is pure quarkonium , pure glue , or even a @xmath4glue hybrid . for a pure quarkonium state",
    ", the two - photon and two - gluon widths can be related to leading order by replacing the photon coupling @xmath108 with the gluon coupling @xmath109 , @xmath110 where 9/2 is the color factor and @xmath111 is the relevant quark charge .",
    "one can estimate @xmath112 from the measured total @xmath0 width of 140 mev @xcite and the expectation that the @xmath113 branching ratio is of order @xmath114 @xcite .",
    "the numerical value of @xmath115 is then estimated to be @xmath116 1 kev .",
    "glue states are more difficult .",
    "whereas one expects a @xmath113 branching ratio of order @xmath117 , a branching ratio of order 1 is anticipated for @xmath118 .",
    "in fact , even a two - gluon branching ratio as small as @xmath119 would make it difficult to classify the state as pure quarkonium@xcite .",
    "we rely on the analysis of close , farrar , and li @xcite and take the branching ratio for @xmath120 to be @xmath121 ( a value which is in accord with the analysis of reference @xcite ) , which yields @xmath122 mev . for the two-@xmath40 decay width , we use the results of kada , kessler , and parisi @xcite who calculated @xmath123 using a nonrelativistic gluon bound - state model . adapted for the @xmath124 and with a @xmath125 branching ratio of @xmath119 ,",
    "their expressions yield @xmath126 ev .",
    "our estimates for the various widths are summarized in table 1 .",
    "we have used the two - gluon widths to calculate the production of a @xmath14 glueball via double - photon and double - pomeron exchange in heavy - ion collisions at lhc and rhic energies .",
    "we consider @xmath127pb nuclei , and use the gaussian form factor ( 12 ) with @xmath128 mev@xcite .",
    "our calculations then yield a total cross section of @xmath129b at the lhc , @xmath130 nb at rhic .",
    "by contrast , the corresponding cross sections for the @xmath9 production mode are orders of magnitude higher : some 2160 b and 73 b at the lhc and rhic , respectively .",
    "it is useful to compare these results with those originating from proton - proton rather than heavy ion interactions . noting that @xmath131 scales like the inverse nuclear radius , i.e. , as @xmath132 , we see from ( 31 ) that @xmath133 . although the loss of large @xmath26 in proton - proton collisions will certainly lower the pomeron - pomeron cross section , the additional luminosity and energy available to proton beams at rhic ( @xmath134 , 250 gev ) should offset this expected decrease . for simplicity of comparison",
    ", we have approximated the usual nucleon dipole form factor with the gaussian of ( 12 ) , taking @xmath135 .",
    "the resulting cross section for the @xmath9 production of @xmath124 is 151 @xmath136b which , at the increased rhic luminosity , is competitive with production in heavy ion collisions .",
    "not surprisingly , the extra energy and luminosity which result in large event rates for @xmath9 fusion is of little consequence for @xmath15 fusion , since @xmath137 .",
    "indeed , calculation shows the resulting cross section to be at the @xmath138 pb level .",
    "these expectations , of course , are overly optimistic not only because they assume 100% detection efficiency , but because they do not account for the effects of inelastic nuclear scattering .",
    "the majority of the inelastic events is expected to occur at small values of the impact parameter @xmath89 ; indeed , the elastic nature of the interaction is maintained only in those collisions in which the two nuclei pass by each other .",
    "thus it is important to verify that a significant portion of the @xmath15 and @xmath9 cross sections extends out to relatively large impact parameters . for comparison",
    ", we have included inelastic scattering effects in two different ways .",
    "one is by applying a geometric cutoff at a minimum impact parameter of @xmath139 , where @xmath140 is the nuclear radius ( @xmath141 fm for @xmath127pb ) .",
    "a more realistic approach accounts for inelastic scattering effects using the glauber approximation , with an absorption factor @xcite @xmath142 } ~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath143 is the total nucleon - nucleon cross section .",
    "( we have used the formula of amaldi @xcite to extrapolate @xmath143 to rhic and lhc energies . ) for simplicity , we use the same gaussian form factor ( 12 ) to calculate the profile function @xcite @xmath144 for @xmath127pb , this approach yields @xmath9 elastic cross sections of approximately 95 mb at the lhc and 8.2 mb at rhic . including shadowing effects further suppresses these cross sections : letting @xmath145 with @xmath146 lowers the @xmath9 cross sections by about an order of magnitude . for proton scattering at rhic",
    ", the @xmath9 cross section falls to 121 @xmath136b , and thus may be the more fruitful experimental approach .",
    "our numerical results are summarized in tables 2 and 3 .",
    "the dependence of the differential cross sections on impact parameter at rhic is shown in figure 3 , where the dotted curves show the suppressing effects of absorption in the glauber approximation ; figure 4 shows the impact parameter dependence for proton - proton collisions at rhic .",
    "the pomeron results presented in table 3 all employ the structure function @xmath147 of equation ( 21 ) .",
    "as discussed in the previous section , however , without a large momentum scale one can not fully justify the use of the parton model formalism . in order to gauge the sensitivity of the results on the choice of structure function , both @xmath148 and @xmath149 of equations ( 22 ) and ( 23 )",
    "were also considered .",
    "the results are shown in figure 5 , where the differential cross section which emerges using @xmath147 is given by the solid curve , and is to be compared with the cross sections found using @xmath148 and @xmath149 , given by the dashed and dotted curves , respectively .",
    "the predicted cross sections are all found to be well within an order of magnitude of one another .",
    "as can be deduced from equation ( 34 ) , the difference between @xmath150 and @xmath131 corresponds to the folding of the nuclear density distribution with the range of the pomeron field .",
    "this behavior is evident in figure 3 : the double - pomeron exchange process essentially depends on the magnitude of the geometrical overlap of the two nuclei during collision .",
    "this is more readily appreciated in figure 6 , which shows the ratio of @xmath9 to @xmath15 cross sections ; an approximate exponential fall - off is evident , reflecting the pomeron s short range . moreover ,",
    "the pomeron contribution is more strongly suppressed because the probability for an elastic collision becomes large only for @xmath151 fm .    of course",
    ", it is not yet settled whether the @xmath0 meson is actually a glueball , and one must consider the experimental feasibility of using peripheral heavy - ion collisions to determine its nature . although the analysis of close , farrar , and li @xcite rules out a glueball interpretation for @xmath12 , our results are easily extended to a @xmath12 quarkonium state since the total cross section simply scales by the ratio of the two - body decay widths and by the @xmath152 factor of equation ( 20 ) .",
    "( note that although the impact parameter dependence can in principle distinguish between the @xmath13 and @xmath12 cases , the difference is negligible once absorption is accounted for . ) for @xmath13 , one must be concerned not only about a putative @xmath153 process being overwhelmed by conventional @xmath4 states , but also the inundation of both of these by the @xmath9 process .",
    "note however that as a probe only of the electrically charged @xmath4 component , the @xmath15 cross section can be varied by changing the nuclear charge @xmath45 at fixed energy . with @xmath154 decay widths which differ by a factor of 2.5 ( and perhaps by as much as a factor of 5",
    "should the @xmath10 be pure glue ) , one should therefore be able to distinguish a quarkonium from a glueball signal .",
    "as for concerns of pomeron fragmentation , the hard glue component of the pomeron carries @xmath155 of the pomeron s momentum , leaving only @xmath156 to fragment .",
    "moreover , the need for small @xmath33 requires that the two pomerons which form the state be soft : to make a 1700 mev state each pomeron must have less than @xmath157 mev longitudinal momentum , of which 850 mev goes into the produced state and 150 mev fragments .",
    "thus any fragmentation must yield a 300 mev , isospin zero state ",
    "most likely pion pairs .",
    "there seems little reason to expect that this will swamp a glueball signal .    in conclusion",
    ", we find that peripheral collisions of heavy - ions  and , at rhic , of protons  may be a fruitful approach to the production and study of glueballs . for the @xmath10 , the extent to which the measured production cross section agrees with results presented here may serve as a measure of the status of its candidacy ; application to other glueball candidates is straightforward .",
    "an essential difference between the production of states of high invariant mass by elastic two - photon exchange and that by double - pomeron exchange is that the electromagnetic interaction is long - ranged , whereas the strong interactions have a range of typically 1 fm . in order to understand how these features are contained in the scattering formalism employed here",
    ", we briefly examine the range of the various interactions @xcite . in momentum space the distribution of virtual quanta around their source is given by @xmath158 where @xmath43 is the invariant four - momentum exchanged , @xmath159 is the vertex function of the source , and @xmath160 is the propagator of the virtual quanta . for virtual photons emitted by a nucleus , we have @xmath161 where @xmath42 is the elastic nuclear form factor . for the pomeron",
    ", we have @xcite @xmath162 where @xmath163 is the regge trajectory of the pomeron , and @xmath164 is the pomeron - nucleon coupling constant .",
    "the @xmath165 term is part of the so - called `` signature factor '' which expresses the different properties of the pomeron under @xmath166 and @xmath167 conjugation .",
    "we are interested here in the spatial distribution of the virtual quanta in the nuclear rest frame , where we have @xmath168 .",
    "note that the pomeron propagator depends on the total scattering energy @xmath28 , i.e. , the pomeron distribution seen by the other nucleus ( or any other probe ) is a function of energy even in the rest frame of the source .    the spatial distribution @xmath169 is obtained from ( 36 ) by a fourier transformation .",
    "for the virtual photon field we find the well - known result , @xmath170 where @xmath171 is the ( nuclear ) charge density distribution .",
    "for the pomeron distribution we find @xmath172 where we have used eq .",
    "( 13 ) . at very high c.m .",
    "energy the numerator of the pomeron propagator falls off very rapidly with @xmath173 , with an exponential slope given by @xmath174 .",
    "we can therefore neglect the @xmath173 dependence of the signature factor and approximate @xmath175 \\approx \\cos { \\scriptstyle\\frac{1}{2}}\\pi\\epsilon \\approx 1 ~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] defining the pomeron range parameter @xmath62 as @xmath176 we obtain : @xmath177 we thus find that the pomeron distribution corresponds to the nuclear density distribution folded with a gaussian of range @xmath62 . at lhc energy for @xmath127pb nuclei , with @xmath178 gev and @xmath58 gev@xmath59 , we find @xmath179 gev / u@xmath180 fm . we conclude that the distribution of virtual pomerons falls off very rapidly at the nuclear surface , with a mean range less than that of the nuclear density itself .",
