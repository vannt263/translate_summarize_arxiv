    "<S> moreover , many np models predict the production of a long - lived particle that is likely to escape the detectors , carrying away missing energy ; production cross sections will thus not exhibit sharp resonances at the positions of np masses , and we must consider other ways to measure these .    </S>",
    "<S> one well - studied avenue is to construct invariant mass distributions of final jet or leptonic momenta in exclusive channels and study their endpoints , these being analytical functions of np masses@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> there are several caveats to this method however : the exclusive channel under study must somehow be identified or assumed , backgrounds must not interfere with endpoint measurement , and there may be some model - dependence in the method of fitting the endpoint on a 1-dimensional histogram . </S>",
    "<S> the first caveat is most severe , especially in a model such as the minimal supersymmetric sm ( mssm ) , where the gluino and squarks decay via literally hundreds of possible decay chains . </S>",
    "<S> although sm backgrounds can be reduced by requiring a suitable number of hard jets and isolated leptons , np backgrounds which may potentially shift the endpoint are much more challenging .    </S>",
    "<S> our claim is that two important features of np particle production , when used together , can greatly boost the efficacy of the above endpoint method . </S>",
    "<S> first , if np particles carry a new conserved charge , such as r - parity in the mssm , they will be multiply - produced . </S>",
    "<S> we may , for example , consider inclusive decay chains of the form @xmath4 , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are np states arising from parent systems @xmath7 , the total invariant mass of these latter assuming any value from @xmath8 ( henceforth designated ` threshold production ' ) all the way up to the maximum machine energy . </S>",
    "<S> second , depending on @xmath9 and the exact way in which @xmath10 decay to the specified endstate , invariant masses constructed from the final jet and lepton momenta attain extrema for certain kinematic configurations only . at threshold production , in particular , one special configuration will simultaneously maximize several invariant masses ; collecting a large number of threshold decays , a 2-d or 3-d scatter plot of these invariants would exhibit a clustering around this ` threshold point .
