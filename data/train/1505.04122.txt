    "the emission lines are used to probe to the structure and dynamics of the radiation region around the massive black holes in quasars . in the early 1970s ,",
    "peculiar balmer line profiles had attracted people s attentions , and all lines in a quasar do not produce the same redshift , howbeit the redshift difference between emission lines had not been systematically studied in quasars since the 1980s , even if some broad line shifts with respect to narrow lines had been reported in quasars @xcite .",
    "the different values for low - ionization lines ( lils ) to be red - shifted relative to high - ionization lines ( hils ) has been well noted @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite compiled a sample of over 2200 quasars from the sdss data and created a variety of composite quasar spectra . the existence of slight redshifts of lils with respect to hils is confirmed .",
    "the most peculiar result in their composite spectra is suggesting a redshift difference between the h@xmath1 and h@xmath2 lines , @xmath3 ( see table 4 of * ? ? ?",
    "observations show this trend of @xmath4 seems universal ( see e.g. , table 4 in * ? ? ?",

    "some physical and dynamical interpretations of line shifts have been developed in the study of quasars such as atomic physics , scattering processes , gravitational redshift , doppler effect , etc .",
    "@xcite , however , just as described in the review paper by @xcite , the systematical redshift differences between emission lines in quasars have not been fully clarified , and the structure and dynamics of the regions emitting the low - ionization lines ( lils ) are not fully understood .",
    "the physical models associated dynamical processes in quasars need to be further developed .    in our recent paper @xcite , we claimed that the cerenkov line - like radiation , created by the fast electrons in the dense clouds / filaments / sheets with high densities @xmath5 , has a significant contribution to the broad hydrogen lines and low - ionization lines of quasars .",
    "therefore the observed broad hydrogen line or low - ionization lines(lils ) should be a ` blended line ' with two components : the ` normal line ' , exactly at @xmath6 , produced by the bound - bound transition @xmath7 in atoms / ions , and the ` cerenkov quasi - line ' .",
    "actually , the latter is not a real emission line , instead , it is a narrow continuum near the intrinsic wavelength @xmath8 of a hydrogen line , @xmath9 , hence the name ` cerenkov line - like radiation ' , or simply , ` cerenkov quasi - line ' .",
    "besides , we mentioned that the high ionization lines(hils ) ( e.g. , c  iii , c  iv , n  v , etc . )",
    "are pure ` normal lines ' , because the cerenkov radiation disappears in a fully ionized dense hydrogen plasma , where all high - valence ions reside ( e.g. , c@xmath10 , c@xmath11 , n@xmath12 , etc . ) . in this region",
    ", the cerenkov mechanism does not work due to the ` effect of plasma oscillation ' , rendering the refractive index of plasma @xmath13 ( see also , * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , supposing that the hils are pure normal lines and the lils are blended lines with the two components of normal line and cerenkov quasi - line , this will be a plausible possibility to result in the difference between lils and hils , represented by mg  ii ( 2800   ) and c  iv ( 1549   ) respectively @xcite ( detailed discussion in section [ sec : conclusion ] ) .",
    "we should indicate that the mechanism has been verified by laboratory experiments @xcite .    in this paper",

    "* ) , one of the interesting properties of the cerenkov quasi - line is that , it does not exactly locate at @xmath6 , but is slightly redshifted , called as the ` cerenkov line redshift ' , which has a different amount of redshift from line to line @xcite .",
    "we try to find evidences in observations to confirm the reality of this newly recognized redshift .",
    "our effort is successful . in section [ sec : model ] of this paper , by using this new redshift effect and based on the blend models , we calculate the redshifts of different hydrogen lines to compare with the observations .",
    "the good fitting very favors the proposition of the ` blend line ' .",
    "table [ tab01 ] of this paper ( in section [ sec : calculation ] ) shows the averaged additional redshifts , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , of @xmath17 quasars , relative to the observed narrow line [ o  iii ] 5007   ( see the first line in table [ tab01 ] , section [ sec : calculation ] .",
    "data are taken from table 4 in @xcite , where the redshift is in unit of velocity .",
    "note that , the redshift data of another strong hydrogen line ly@xmath2 is absent in their table 4 ; hence absent in our table [ tab01 ] .",
    "but we still list the expected redshift of ly@xmath2 line in the third line in table [ tab01 ] for future detections in observations ) .",
    "the observed redshifts of hydrogen lines ly@xmath1 ,",
    "h@xmath1 and h@xmath2 in the first line of table [ tab01 ] are really different from each other .",
    "as mentioned above , the cerenkov component in the proposed ` blended line ' has an additional ` cerenkov line redshift ' with different amount for different lines .",
    "it is likely that the observed redshift - differences of different hydrogen lines could arise from this additional redshift , rather than from a velocity - origin , adopted in prevailing explanations .",
    "historically , it has been well known that , the low - ionization lines(lils ) and the hydrogen lines of quasars have a systemic redshift relative to the high - ionization lines(hils ) @xcite .",
    "a large sample of over 2,200 quasars from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) database are compiled and a variety of composite quasar spectra are obtained by @xcite .",
    "they confirmed the existence of the slight redshifs of lils , as well as the slight blueshifts of hils , with respect to the narrow [ o  iii ] 5007   beyond all doubts . according to the current explanation",
    ", both the redshifts of lils and the blueshifts of hils are attributed to the stratified structure of the broad line region ( blr ) of quasars , with different radial velocities of different ionization regions(inflow and outflow ) . from the stratification models ,",
    "it is inferred that there would be a correlation between the velocity shifts and the ionization potentials of spectral lines .",
    "this correlation is also confirmed by using the same composite quasar spectra ( see table 4 in * ? ? ?",
    "however , an issue arises : why the velocity - shifts are so different among the broad hydrogen lines , for which the ionization potential is the same , @xmath18 ev ( see e.g. , table 4 in * ? ? ?",
    "* also see , tables 1 and 2 in cheng et al .",
    "1990 and table 2 in nishihara et al . 1997 ) .",
    "it was suggested that , the hydrogen line stratification may occur due to the different radiation transfer effects for different lines ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the density gradient in blr with distance would cause the stratification of different hydrogen lines , leading to the different velocity - shifts .",
    "this may be true , and deserves to give a further detailed analysis to confirm this viewpoint .",
    "but until now no quantitative fitting to the observed redshift - differences of hydrogen lines has been developed by this way .",
    "this situation promotes us to make an attempt to find alternative solutions for this puzzle .",
    "this paper is arranged as follows . in section [ sec : model0 ] , we describe the blend model for the broad lines of quasars . in section [ sec : calculation ] , we first give the theoretical redshifts of the pure cerenkov ly@xmath1 , ly@xmath2 , h@xmath1 and h@xmath2 lines , for preparing the subsequent calculation of the additional redshifts of the blended lines .",
    "the detailed model calculations of the redshifts of the blended hydrogen lines are presented in section [ sec : model ] .",
    "finally , conclusions and discussions are given in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "we first give a clearer description for the blend model of the broad lines of quasars , than in our recent paper @xcite .",
    "we have mentioned that , the coexistence and blend of two kinds of emission lines need a coexistence of two kinds of clouds / filaments with higher and lower densities in the blr .",
    "the clouds / filaments with ` standard ' densities @xmath19 @xcite , illuminated by the central uv and x - ray continuum , are responsible to the normal line emission , but they have little contribution to the cerenkov lines(see figure 1 in @xcite ) . on the other hand , in the very dense clouds / filaments with @xmath20 , the cerenkov line - like radiation occurs and becomes more prominent for higher densities ; whereas the normal lines totally disappear because of the thermalization in the dense gas ( when @xmath21 , see @xcite ) . in brief ,",
    "the normal lines and the cerenkov quasi - lines , respectively , arise from the ` standard ' and the dense clouds / filaments in the blr ( intermediate densities of @xmath22 are also possible  it is unfair to exclude their existence , though they are unhelpful for producing the line - emission ) .",
    "the ` standard ' and the dense clouds / filaments , coexisting in blr , are likely to distribute in different regions .",
    "it is a consensus that the ` standard ' clouds / filaments spread in the whole blr , while a vast quantity of very dense cloudlets or filaments / sheets with small sizes are scattered in the very inner portion of blr , most plausibly in the magnetosphere around the central engine  typically on scales of @xmath23 ( @xmath24 is the gravitational radius of a central mass @xmath25 ) , where the random magnetic fields of @xmath26 gauss may pervade @xcite .",
    "the magnetic fields are likely to have complex structures .",
    "the dense cloudlets / filaments in the magnetosphere can be supported and confined by the magnetic fields .",
    "these dense cloudlets , with temperature of @xmath27  k , reprocess the primary non - thermal radiation of relativistic electrons from the central engine , and then contribute a quasi - blackbody continuum in the optical - uv bands ( the ` big blue bump ' ) .",
    "a possible range of the density @xmath28 and the size scale @xmath29 for dense cloudlets / filaments / sheets were suggested by the above authors ; @xmath30 , @xmath31 ( for filaments and sheets , @xmath29 expresses the thickness ) .",
    "@xcite further suggested that the most suitable values , favoring to surviving of the dense clouds around the central engine , are @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "besides , the presence of abundant fast electrons in the innermost region is conceivable .",
    "all these conditions are favorable to the production of the efficient cerenkov line - like radiation . in brief , in our blend models , the dense cloudlets and the ` standard ' cloudlets , respectively , exist in different regions of the blr ; the former are scattered in the inner magnetosphere around the central engine , whereas the latter distribute in the whole region of blr .",
    "some observations support the above picture of different regions : @xcite reported that , the variation response of hydrogen lines to the uv - continuum in arp  151 shows a deficit of prompt response in the balmer - line cores but strong prompt response in the red wings of lines .",
    "this is easy to understand if the cores and the red - wings of lines are , respectively , dominated by the normal line and the cerenkov line emissions ; and if the latter is produced by the dense matter in the innermost region of blr .",
    "moreover , we mention that , owing to the effect of the combined forces of gravity , radiation pressure and magnetic stresses , the dense clouds / filaments / sheets inside the magnetosphere should markedly deviate from the virial motion , controlled by the gravity alone , thus the speeds of clouds / filaments should be much less than the virial velocity due to the damping of both the radiation and the magnetic viscosity , i.e. , @xmath34 , @xmath35 is the gravitational radius with a central mass @xmath25",
    ". the possibility of @xmath36 is confirmed by the observations : the observed broadening of the hydrogen lines , emitted simultaneously with the central flare , is markedly less than that given by the virial theorem ( see the observed line widths in regions of time - delay @xmath37 in figures 3 and 4 in @xcite ) . in the following calculations , we neglect both the velocity - broadening and velocity - shift of the cerenkov lines , caused by the un - virial , slow flailing of dense clouds / filaments in the central magnetosphere .",
    "we assume that , all of the additional redshifts of hydrogen lines arise from the ` cerenkov line redshift ' .",
    "before the model calculations for the blended hydrogen lines , we first present the additional slight redshifts of pure cerenkov hydrogen lines . for a specific cerenkov quasi - line near the intrinsic wavelength @xmath38 , the ` cerenkov line redshift ' is given by @xcite @xmath39 here , @xmath8 is the intrinsic wavelength of a specific hydrogen line with the upper level @xmath40 and lower level @xmath41 ; @xmath42 is the einstein s spontaneous emission coefficient for the transition @xmath7 ; @xmath43 is the total quantum damping constant of the specific hydrogen line with wavelength @xmath8 , which is related to einstein s spontaneous emission probabilities @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "@xmath46 and @xmath47 are the degeneracy of the upper level @xmath40 and the lower level @xmath41 , respectively . @xmath48 and @xmath49 represent , respectively , the number densities of neutral hydrogen at the upper and the lower levels .",
    "@xmath50 is the number density of neutral hydrogen at the lowest level @xmath51 of the photoelectric absorption , which gives the dominant absorption among all qualified photoelectric levels of a hydrogen atom for the incident line photon with wavelength @xmath8 . for the cerenkov ly@xmath1 and ly@xmath2 lines , @xmath52 ; for the cerenkov h@xmath1 and h@xmath2 lines , @xmath53 , etc .",
    "@xmath8 is in unit cm .    from equation ( [ cer - redshift ] )",
    ", we obtain the additional redshifts of the cerenkov ly@xmath1 , ly@xmath2 , h@xmath1 and h@xmath2 lines : @xmath54 where @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 represent the number densities of neutral hydrogen in levels @xmath59 and @xmath60 , respectively . here",
    "we adopt atomic parameters in equation ( [ cer - redshift ] ) as @xmath61  cm , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64  cm , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67  cm , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70  cm , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 for our calculations .",
    "we have mentioned that @xcite , the cerenkov line - like radiation is effective only for the dense cloudlets ( and/or filaments , sheets ) with high densities @xmath77 . for the dense clouds ,",
    "the populations of hydrogen , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 , contained in equation ( [ cer - redshift1 ] ) , are given by the boltzmann law , thus @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 .",
    "therefore the temperature @xmath81 of the dense cloud / filament / sheet becomes an unique parameter for determining the ratios @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 , hence for the redshifts @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 in equation ( [ cer - redshift1 ] ) .",
    "we obtain the permitted range of @xmath81 of the dense matter in quasars as follows : as mentioned in section [ sec : model0 ] , a vast amount of very dense and ` cold ' clouds with typical temperature @xmath81 of @xmath89  k distribute in the magnetosphere around the central engine , which reprocess the non - thermal radiation from the central engine and contribute the ` ultraviolet excess ' ( the ` big blue bump ' ) in the optical - ultraviolet continuum of quasars , via the optically thick thermal emission .",
    "this thermal component can be well described by a blackbody at a single temperature @xmath81 . @xcite",
    "successively fitted the observed spectra of ultraviolet excess of eight seyfert 1 and quasars , and obtained the blackbody temperatures @xmath81 in range @xmath90 ( see table 2 in @xcite ) .",
    "the median or average temperature is @xmath91  k. they stressed that the thermal component need not be a single temperature blackbody .",
    "this is only the simplest form to fit the data well .",
    "in reality , there could be small contributions present from hotter or cooler gas which would be difficult to detect .",
    "furthermore , the observation indicates that there is little thermal gas much hotter than 40,000  k @xcite .",
    "therefore , in the following , we cease the calculations at @xmath92  k , and take @xmath93 as a permitted range of the temperature @xmath81 .    by using equation ( [ cer - redshift1 ] )",

    "differing to the cerenkov component , the ` normal line ' exactly locates at @xmath6 , with no additional redshift ( @xmath144 ) , which inevitably leads to a marked decrease of the resultant redshift of the ` blended line ' .",

    "although so far we can not give a convincing argument to show the reasonableness of the approximate equation ( [ intensityratio ] ) , but we have emphasized the importance of the cerenkov component in quasars .",
    "we mentioned that the cerenkov quasi - line is strong enough to compete with the accompanying normal line in the blended hydrogen lines or low - ionization lines @xcite .",
    "this implies that the intensity - ratio of the cerenkov quasi - line to the normal line should be not far from unit , e.g. , in a narrower range @xmath154 .",
    "therefore , in the primary @xmath155calculations , the approximate equation [ intensityratio ] , @xmath156 , seems to be acceptable . inserting equation ( [ intensityratio ] ) into equation ( [ expectedredshift ] ) , we obtain @xmath157    by using equation ( [ expectedredshift1 ] ) , the expected resultant redshifts of the blended hydrogen lines ly@xmath1 , ly@xmath2 , h@xmath1 and h@xmath2 are shown in the third line in table [ tab01 ] .",
    "obviously , the expected redshifts , given by the ` blend model 1 ' , are much closer to the observed ones ( table [ tab01 ] , the first line ) , than the pure cerenkov lines ( the second line in table [ tab01 ] ) .",
    "this result strongly supports the reasonableness of our proposition of the blended hydrogen lines .",
    "however , there still exist remarkable discrepancies between the predictions of model 1 and the observations for the h@xmath1 and h@xmath2 lines ( particularly for h@xmath2 ) , indicating that the approximation of ` equipartition of intensity ' ( equations ( [ intensityratio ] ) and ( [ expectedredshift1 ] ) ) is not equally good for all hydrogen lines . this is easy to understand .",

    "the good fitting shows the plausibility of above adopted intensity - ratios in quasars , though the theoretical argument has not been given yet .",
    "but we would like to mention that , the chosen value @xmath167 for fitting the ` zero redshift ' of h@xmath2 line seems to be quite questionable .",
    "the observed @xmath168 , with the largest error of measurement among ly@xmath1 , h@xmath1 and h@xmath2 lines , only indicates that no additional redshift can be detected at the level of order of magnitude @xmath140 ; and the observed redshift is uncertain in a wide range , @xmath169 , rather than @xmath170 .",
    "correspondingly , the ratio @xmath171 should be taken in a wider range , @xmath172 , rather than @xmath173 .",
    "anyway , the following conclusion remains beyond doubt : the ratio @xmath174 for the blend h@xmath2 line should be far from the ` equipartition of intensity ' .",
    "the small values of @xmath175 ( in range @xmath176 ) imply that , comparing with ly@xmath1 and h@xmath1 lines , the cerenkov component in the blend h@xmath2 line is no longer important , rendering the ` cerenkov line redshift ' difficult to be detected ( see equation ( [ expectedredshift ] ) , and the first line in table [ tab01 ] ) .",
    "table [ tab01 ] shows that , the expected redshifts of the blended hydrogen lines , given by model 1 or 2 , are well fitted to the observed values .",
    "furthermore , comparing the observations and the predictions of model 1 or model 2 ( see the first , third and forth lines in table [ tab01 ] ) , we find that , both the observed and the predicted redshifts have the same un - equality sequence , i.e. , @xmath177 , as well as @xmath178 . we stress that this un - equality sequence originates from the intrinsic property of the cerenkov hydrogen lines , @xmath179 , despite what @xmath81-value is adopted ( see figure [ fig:1 ] ) . we claim that , the good consistency , and the same un - equality sequence between observations and predictions , are not coincident , instead , it is an important evidence supporting the conclusion : the observed hydrogen lines of quasars are blended by both the cerenkov quasi - line and the normal line ; and the redshift - differences of different hydrogen lines originate from the ` cerenkov line redshifts ' , existing in the blended lines .",
    "another conclusion is that the average intensity ratios of the two components in the blended hydrogen lines of @xmath1802,200 quasars are not far from unit ( approximate ` equipartition of intensity ' ) .",
    "we particularly conclude that , for the strongest ly@xmath1 line , @xmath181 is more reliable because of the good fitting to the observed ly@xmath1 line ( both in the blend model 1 and model 2 , a more exact value should be @xmath182 , given by blend model 2 ) .",
    "this could be a progress in study of the blend models for the broad lines of quasars ; the ` equipartition of intensity ' for ly@xmath1 line , the strongest one in all hydrogen lines , numerically confirms the importance of the cerenkov line - like radiation for the broad lines of quasars , which can not be ignored any more .",
    "the ratios @xmath135 , @xmath136 , and @xmath183 , adopted in the model 2 , could be also helpful to estimate the intensity - ratios of different blended hydrogen lines , @xmath184 , where @xmath185 represents the total intensity of the blend ly@xmath1 line , similarly for @xmath186 , @xmath187 . if the above parameter - values @xmath135 , @xmath136 , and @xmath183 ( model 2 ) also give a good fitting to the observed intensity - ratios @xmath188 , the proposition of blended broad lines in quasars would be further confirmed .",
    "this is worth to do in subsequent study .",
    "the observed additional redshifts of the low - ionization lines , relative to [ o  iii ] 5007   ( e.g. , mg  ii 2798   , see table 4 in @xcite ) , should be also arise from the ` cerenkov line redshift ' , because the low - ionization lines also contain the cerenkov quasi - line component . we plan to fit the redshifts of some low - ionization lines in the same way as for the hydrogen lines , taking the intensity - ratios ( e.g. , @xmath189 ) as parameters .    in our blend model consideration ,",
    "the ` cerenkov line shift ' is the unique source of the additional redshifts of hydrogen lines .",
    "therefore , the ` blend models 1 and 2 ' are basically different from the generally accepted ` stratification models ' , in which the additional redshifts all arise from the doppler effect ( the velocity shift ) .",
    "the advantage of the ` blend models ' is obvious , which gives the best fitting to the observed redshifts .",
    "we hope that the future observations can give a further judgment on the two different kinds of models .    as of now there remain some outstanding difficulties in the current standard models to account for the observed broad hydrogen lines and some low - ionization lines in quasars , such as the steep balmer decrement(e.g .",

    "the quasi - line emission could provide a solution for these long standing puzzles , for which the energy is extracted from the kinetic energy of the fast electrons , rather than from the continuum photons .",
    "we hope that the existence of the component of this quasi - line emission in broad lines of quasars can be tested by future observations .",
    "the shape and redshift of emission lines in quasars reveal the physical processes and activities of central engine around black hole . until now",
    ", gaskell s results on the difference between low- and high - ionization lines ( represented by mg  ii ( 2800   ) and c  iv ( 1549   ) respectively ) have remained valid , and have yielded the observational basis for a model that still provides a basic interpretative sketch for the structure of broad line emitting region @xcite . in their model , the low - ionization lines(lils ) and the hydrogen lines of quasars have a systemic redshift relative to the high - ionization lines(hils ) @xcite .",
    "they think that hil blue shifts are associated with radial motion in a flattened structure ( e.g. , the accretion disk ) mainly emitting lils , also later developments confirmed the earlier results @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite pointed out that not all quasars are the same case , and that a first distinction between radio - loud and radio - quiet quasars was necessary : blueshifts were mostly present in radio quiet ( rq ) quasars , but definitely rarer in radio loud ( rl ) ( also  see , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we explain redshifts between the hils and the lils based on our primary idea , which the hils are mainly from the normal lines ( i.e. , bound - bound transition ) , whereas the lils are blended by the component of cerenkov quasi - line , which has an intrinsic redshift from line to line . besides",
    ", this thought should be expected to be confirmed that the cerenkov quasi - line emission has much more contribution to broad lines in rq quasars because there may be much denser gas ( @xmath190 ) required by cerenkov emission .",
