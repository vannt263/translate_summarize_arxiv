    "the thermonuclear runaway model has been successful in reproducing the _ gross _ features of nova outbursts . according to this widely accepted scenario , classical novae",
    "are produced by thermonuclear runaways ( hereafter , tnrs ) that take place in the white dwarf component of a close binary system .",
    "the large , main sequence companion overfills its roche lobe , providing matter outflows through the inner lagrangian point that lead to the formation of an accretion disk around the white dwarf .",
    "a fraction of this h - rich matter lost by the companion ultimately ends up on top of the white dwarf , where it is gradually compressed as accretion goes on .",
    "the piling up of matter heats the envelope up to the point when ignition conditions to drive a tnr are reached .",
    "an extended set of hydrodynamic computations of classical nova outbursts has been performed during the last 25 years ( see starrfield et al .",
    "1972 , for the first hydrodynamic study of the tnr model , and the recent papers by kovetz & prialnik 1997 , starrfield et al .",
    "1998 , jos & hernanz 1998 , and references therein ) , for a wide range of white dwarf masses and initial luminosities , mass accretion rates and initial chemical compositions . from the nucleosynthesis viewpoint ,",
    "these computations have been able to identify two types of nova outbursts , those occurring in co or in one white dwarfs .",
    "the latter ones have provided a framework for the origin of the high concentrations of ne and more massive isotopes found in the spectra of some well - observed novae , such as v693 cra 1981 , v1370 aql 1982 , qu vul 1984 no .",
    "2 , v838 her 1991 or v1974 cyg 1992 ( livio & truran 1994 ; gehrz et al .",
    "1998 ) . among the isotopes synthesized in these so - called ne ( or one ) novae , two radioactive species have raised a particular astrophysical interest : @xmath0na and @xmath1al .",
    "the potential role of @xmath2na for diagnosis of nova outbursts was first suggested by clayton & hoyle ( 1974 ) .",
    "it decays to a short - lived excited state of @xmath0ne ( with a lifetime of @xmath3 yr ) , which de - excites to its ground state by emitting a @xmath4-ray photon of @xmath5 mev . through this mechanism , nearby one novae within a few kiloparsecs from the sun may provide detectable @xmath4-ray fluxes .",
    "several experimental verifications of this @xmath4-ray emission at 1.275 mev from nearby novae have been attempted in the last twenty years , using balloon - borne experiments ( leventhal et al .",
    "1977 ) , and detectors on - board satellites such as heao-3 ( mahoney et al .",
    "1982 ) , smm ( leising et al . 1988 ) , and cgro ( leising 1993 ; iyudin et al . 1995 ) , from which upper limits on the ejected @xmath0na have been derived . in particular , the observations performed with the comptel experiment on - board cgro of five recent ne - type novae ( nova her 1991 , nova sgr 1991 , nova sct 1991 , nova pup 1991 and nova cyg 1992 .",
    "iyudin et al .",
    "1995 ) , as well as observations of _ standard _",
    "co novae , have led to an upper limit of @xmath6 m@xmath7 for the @xmath0na mass ejected by any nova in the galactic disk .",
    "this restrictive limit has posed some constraints on pre - existing theoretical models of classical nova explosions .",
    "@xmath1al is another unstable nucleus , with a lifetime of @xmath8 years , that decays from ground state to the first excited level of @xmath9 mg , which in turn de - excites to its ground state by emitting a gamma - ray photon of 1.809 mev .",
    "this characteristic gamma - ray signature , first detected in the galatic center by the heao-3 satellite ( mahoney et al . 1982 , 1984 ) , has been confirmed by other space missions like smm ( @xcite ) and by several balloon - borne experiments .",
    "the most recent measurements made with comptel have provided a map of the 1.809 mev emission in the galaxy ( diehl et al .",
    "1995 , 1997 ; prantzos & diehl 1996 ) .",
    "the inferred @xmath10 m@xmath7 of galactic @xmath1al are , according to the observed distribution , mainly attributed to young progenitors , such as massive agb stars , type ii supernovae and wolf - rayet stars .",
    "more recent analyses of the 1.809 mev comptel map reveal a correlation between this map and the cobe / dmr maps , tracing free - free emission , thus confirming that the main contributors to the galactic @xmath1al are massive stars ( kndlseder 1997 ) .",
    "however , a potential contribution from novae or low - mass agb stars can not be ruled out ( see jos , hernanz & coc 1997 , for a recent analysis of @xmath1al production in classical novae ) .",
    "first estimates of the @xmath0na and @xmath1al production in novae were performed by different groups , using simplified one - zone models with representative temperature and density profiles .",
    "hillebrandt & thielemann ( 1982 ) and wiescher et al . (",
    "1986 ) suggested already that classical novae might produce significant amounts of @xmath1al , not enough to represent major galactic sources , but relevant to account for the observed isotopic anomalies found in some meteorites .",
    "new parametrized calculations by weiss & truran ( 1990 ) and nofar , shaviv & starrfield ( 1991 ) , revealed that nova envelopes previously enhanced in heavy elements ( from ne to mg ) produce large amounts of @xmath0na and @xmath1al .",
    "since this metal enrichment is expected to result from dredge - up of core material , weiss & truran suggested that massive onemg white dwarfs ( the ones attaining the highest peak temperatures and , therefore , the most efficient dregde - up ) are likely to provide the largest abundances of both @xmath0na and @xmath1al in the ejecta .",
    "politano et al .",
    "( 1995 ) revisited this scenario using hydrodynamic computations .",
    "they reported on a strong anticorrelation between @xmath0na and @xmath1al production : novae that produce the largest amounts of @xmath0na ( i.e. , massive white dwarfs ) are not the same as those accounting for the largest yields of @xmath1al ( i.e. , low - mass white dwarfs ) .",
    "the obtained @xmath0na yields range between @xmath11 and @xmath12 , by mass . assuming that the whole envelope ( @xmath13 m@xmath7 ) is ejected during the outburst",
    ", they concluded that nearby onemg novae with @xmath14 m@xmath7 should produce detectable @xmath0na @xmath4-rays for cgro , a prediction not confirmed so far ( iyudin et al .",
    "their results showed also a significant production of @xmath1al ( i.e. , @xmath15 , by mass , corresponding to onemg white dwarfs with masses between @xmath16 m@xmath7 , respectively ) , which could account for a major fraction of the galactic @xmath1al .",
    "recent hydrodynamic computations of one novae ( jos , hernanz & coc 1997 ; jos & hernanz 1997 , 1998 ) using updated initial compositions and nuclear reaction rates , have led to a significant reduction of both @xmath1al and @xmath0na ejected during nova outbursts . in particular , a mean mass fraction of @xmath17 of @xmath0na is found in the 1.25 m@xmath7 one model ( with @xmath18(@xmath0na)=@xmath19 m@xmath7 ) , whereas a maximum value of @xmath20 results from the 1.35 m@xmath7 one model ( @xmath18(@xmath0na)=@xmath21 m@xmath7 ) .",
    "the corresponding peak fluxes in the 1.275 mev @xmath0na line , below @xmath22 photons s@xmath23 @xmath24 for novae at 1 kpc , turn out to be too low to be detected with osse or comptel but represent potential targets for the nearby future integral mission ( hernanz et al .",
    "1997 ; gmez - gomar et al .",
    "1998 ) . concerning @xmath1al , yields ranging from @xmath25 to @xmath26 by mass have been obtained in a series of one nova models with masses between @xmath27 m@xmath7 .",
    "contribution of novae to the galactic @xmath1al is limited to @xmath28 m@xmath7 ( jos , hernanz & coc 1997 ) .",
    "nevertheless , a larger contribution can not be ruled out if the ( uncertain ) lower limit for one white dwarfs is reduced down to 1.0 m@xmath7 ( jos & hernanz 1998 ) .",
    "other hydrodynamic computations performed by starrfield et al .",
    "( 1997 , 1998 ) , using also updated nuclear reaction rates and opacities , have modified their previous estimates ( politano et al .",
    "the expected abundance of @xmath0na in the ejecta has risen up to @xmath29 , by mass , when 1.25 m@xmath7 onemg white dwarfs are adopted , high enough to be detected by cgro , provided that all the accreted envelope ( @xmath30 m@xmath7 ) is ejected . on the other hand ,",
    "the improved input physics translates into a factor of 10 reduction on the synthesis of @xmath1al , in better agreement with the analysis of the 1.809 mev emission map provided by comptel , and also with the results previously reported by jos , hernanz & coc ( 1997 ) .",
    "whereas the agreement between the different groups on the expected contribution of classical novae to the galactic @xmath1al has significantly increased , there remains some discrepancy concerning the amount of @xmath0na present in the ejecta .",
    "since the synthesis of both @xmath0na and @xmath1al is very dependent on the adopted nuclear reaction rates , the large uncertainties present in some key reactions of both nena and mgal cycles ( coc et al .",
    "1995 ; prantzos & diehl 1996 ) , may significantly modify the expected yields .",
    "in particular , the study of the influence of a given reaction rate on @xmath2na production is not trivial due to the two possible modes of formation and their interplay with convection ( coc et al .",
    "moreover , during a nova outburst , thermodynamic conditions change on a short timescale so that nuclear reactions are never close to equilibrium .",
    "due to obvious experimental difficulties , reaction rates involving short - lived radioactive nuclei of the nena - mgal group are in general poorly known and the associated uncertainties may reach many orders of magnitude .",
    "it is thus important to know how the yields of important isotopes like @xmath2na and @xmath9al are affected by those uncertainties . in this paper ,",
    "series of hydrodynamic nova models have been computed assuming upper , recommended and lower estimates of the reaction rates , from which limits on the production of both @xmath0na and @xmath1al are derived .",
    "the present analysis is focused on capture rates on radioactive nuclei , and for a temperature domain in the range @xmath31 0.5  3.5 .",
    "we refer to the nacre compilation ( angulo et al .",
    "1998 ) for a more general discussion concerning capture rates on stable isotopes , and a wider temperature range . for convenience ,",
    "we use the terms nena cycle and mgal cycle to denote the reactions involved in @xmath2na and @xmath9al formation .",
    "however , because of the high @xmath32na(p,@xmath4 ) and @xmath33al(p,@xmath4 ) rates , they can not be considered as genuine _",
    "cycles_.    in section 2 , we outline some details of the method of computation and input physics .",
    "a detailed analysis of the synthesis of @xmath0na and @xmath1al in classical novae , together with the study of the role played by specific nuclear reactions of the nena - mgal cycles , is given in sections 3 & 4 .",
    "constraints on the production of @xmath0na and @xmath1al assuming lower , recommended and upper rates for some key reactions are derived in section 5 .",
    "the most relevant conclusions of this paper are summarized in section 6 .",
    "a detailed appendix focused on the nuclear physics aspects of the reaction rates within the nena and mgal cycles follows .",
    "evolutionary sequences of nova outbursts have been calculated by means of an updated version of the code shiva ( see jos 1996 ; jos & hernanz 1998 ) , a one - dimensional , implicit , hydrodynamical code in lagrangian formulation , that follows the course of the outburst from the onset of accretion up to the expansion and ejection stages .",
    "the code solves the standard set of differential equations for hydrodynamical evolution : conservation of mass , momentum and energy , energy transport by radiation and convection , plus the definition of the lagrangian velocity , including a time - dependent formalism for convective transport whenever the characteristic convective timescale becomes larger than the integration time step ( wood 1974 ) .",
    "partial mixing between adjacent convective shells is treated by means of a diffusion equation ( see prialnik , shara & shaviv 1979 , for the formalism ) .",
    "the code is linked to a reaction network , which follows the detailed evolution of 100 nuclei , ranging from @xmath34h to @xmath35ca , through 370 nuclear reactions , with updated rates , and screening factors from graboske et al .",
    "( 1973 ) and dewitt , graboske & cooper ( 1973 ) . as suggested by politano et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , the matter transferred from the companion is assumed to be solar - like , and is mixed in a given fraction with the outermost shells of the underlying core by means of an unknown mechanism ( either shear mixing , diffusion or a convective multidimensional process ) .",
    "the composition of the underlying core has been taken from recent detailed evolutionary models in the case of one white dwarfs , which are the main contributors to @xmath2na and @xmath9al synthesis .",
    "these stars are made basically of @xmath36o and @xmath37ne ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , with smaller traces of @xmath38na , @xmath39 mg , @xmath40al and other species .",
    "this issue plays a crucial role in the resulting nucleosynthesis , and should be taken into account in order to compare results obtained by different groups .",
    "in particular , the onemg models computed by starrfield et al .",
    "( 1998 ) have an initial composition of the white dwarf core based on old nucleosynthesis calculations of c - burning from arnett & truran ( 1969 ) , which is richer in @xmath41 mg and @xmath42ne than the one adopted in this paper ( see table 1 ) .",
    "the high temperatures attained during one nova outbursts ( with peak values within @xmath43 k ) , allow a noticeable nuclear activity in the nena and mgal cycles , which results on a significant production of species of astrophysical interest , such as @xmath0na and @xmath1al . in this section",
    ", we will describe the main mechanisms of @xmath2na synthesis , through a detailed analysis of a 1.25 m@xmath7 , one white dwarf , which accretes solar - like matter at a rate @xmath44 m@xmath7.yr@xmath23 , assuming a 50% degree of mixing with the one core ( model one5 , in jos & hernanz 1998 ) .",
    "snapshots of the evolution of several isotopes relevant to @xmath0na synthesis ( i.e. , @xmath45ne , @xmath46na and @xmath47 mg ) are shown in figure 1 .      at the onset of accretion ,",

    "destruction of @xmath2na through ( p , @xmath4 ) reactions goes on but , due to convection , @xmath2na shows a nearly flat profile throughout the envelope .    when @xmath50 2 k ( panel 4 ) , there is a dramatic decline in @xmath32na ( due to ( p,@xmath4 ) and ( p,@xmath52 ) reactions ) and in the @xmath2na abundance ( by @xmath2na(p , @xmath4)@xmath32 mg ) .",
    "@xmath2ne has slightly decreased .",

    "with respect to the other neon isotopes , @xmath48ne increases ( mainly due to the @xmath49-decay of @xmath48na at the outer shells ) , whereas @xmath2ne is destroyed by @xmath2ne(p , @xmath4)@xmath32na .",
    "the two magnesium isotopes @xmath47 mg increase as a result of proton captures onto @xmath54na .    shortly after , due to the sudden release of energy from the short - lived @xmath49-unstable nuclei @xmath57n , @xmath58o , and @xmath59f ,",
    "the envelope begins to expand .",
    "the role played by ( p,@xmath4 ) and ( p,@xmath52 ) reactions is therefore reduced following the drop in temperature , whereas @xmath49-decays progressively dominate the evolution .",
    "the abundances of @xmath53na and @xmath47 mg decrease as a result of such @xmath49-decays , which in turn increase the amount of @xmath53ne and @xmath47na ( panels 6 & 7 ) .    at the final stages of the outburst ( panel 8) ,",
    "as the envelope expands and cools down , most of the remaining nuclear activity in the nena cycle is due to @xmath49-decays , such as @xmath48na(@xmath49)@xmath53ne , @xmath2mg(@xmath49)@xmath0na or @xmath32mg(@xmath49)@xmath38na .",

    "1996 ) have provided a firmer basis for the determination of its rate . since the new rate is lower than the old caughlan & fowler s ( 1988 ) analytic fit ( i.e. , one order of magnitude for @xmath64 ) , destruction of @xmath2na by means of ( p,@xmath4 ) reactions is reduced . in a test model , consisting of a 1.25 m@xmath7 one white dwarf ( model one5 , jos & hernanz 1998 ) , the mean abundance of @xmath2na in the ejecta increases by a factor of @xmath65 3 when the new @xmath2na(p , @xmath4)@xmath32 mg rate ( stegmller et al . 1996 ) , instead of the cf88 one , is adopted ( see table 2 ) .",
    "it is worth noticing that significant nuclear uncertainties affect this rate ( a factor ranging from 3 to 6 for @xmath64 ) , which turn out to be crucial in order to derive ranges of @xmath2na production during nova outbursts . according to @xcite",

    "calculations assume one white dwarfs of masses 1.15 , 1.25 and 1.35 m@xmath7 , and the same input physics than models one3 , one5 and one6 described in jos & hernanz ( 1998 ) , but reducing the @xmath48na(p , @xmath4)@xmath2 mg rate given by cf88 by a factor of 100 ( similar , for novae , to the lower rate given in the appendix ) .",

    "this effect can be interpreted as follows : when the @xmath53na(p,@xmath4)@xmath0mg(@xmath49)@xmath0na rate is reduced by a factor of 100 , the alternative path , @xmath53na(@xmath49)@xmath53ne(p,@xmath4)@xmath0na , is favored . in this case , @xmath2na production is delayed to a time when the envelope is already expanding and cooling down ( contrary to the case when the higher @xmath48na(p , @xmath4)@xmath2 mg rate is adopted ) . as a result , a major fraction of @xmath2na survives .",
    "this , in turn , explains the lower effect found in the 1.35 m@xmath7 model , caused by the higher temperatures achieved in the envelope ( with @xmath69 k ) which remain high enough at the time when @xmath2na is synthesized .",

    "no significant effect on the @xmath2na production is found when using updated rates for such reactions ( see appendix and table 2 ) , because of the limited nuclear flow they conduct for nova conditions .    according to this analysis",

    "snapshots of the evolution of several isotopes relevant to @xmath1al synthesis ( i.e. , @xmath70 mg , @xmath71al , @xmath72si and the ground and isomeric states for @xmath1al , herefater @xmath1al@xmath73 and @xmath1al@xmath74 ) are shown in figure 3 .",
    "nucleosynthesis of @xmath9al is complicated by the presence of a short lived ( @xmath75 = 6.3  s ) spin isomer . at low temperatures ( @xmath76 ) ,",
    "the @xmath9al ground and isomeric states do not reach thermal equilibrium and must be treated as two separate isotopes ( ward & fowler 1980 , see also coc & porquet 1998 ) .",
    "the nuclear activity in the mgal cycle at the early phases of the tnr , when the temperature at the burning shell is @xmath77 k , is dominated by @xmath78mg(p,@xmath4 ) , which leads to both @xmath1al ground and isomeric states . a significant amount of @xmath1al@xmath79 is already synthesized at such temperatures ( figure 3 , panel 1 ) .",
    "another aluminum isotope , @xmath40al , is slightly enhanced with respect to its initial abundance by means of @xmath1al@xmath80(@xmath49)@xmath1mg(p,@xmath4)@xmath40al .",
    "a similar trend is found when @xmath81 k ( panel 2 ) : both @xmath1al@xmath79 and @xmath40al continue to rise ( specially the first one , which increases by nearly a factor of 10 from the abundance shown in panel 1 ) .    at @xmath82 k ( panel 3 ) , the evolution in the mgal cycle",
    "is dominated by @xmath41mg(p,@xmath4)@xmath78al(@xmath49)@xmath78 mg , which in turn accounts for a noticeable production of the @xmath49-unstable nuclei @xmath78al , and also for the increase in the mean @xmath1al@xmath79 abundance ( by means of @xmath78mg(p,@xmath4)@xmath1al@xmath83 ) . a nearly flat profile of @xmath1al@xmath79 results from convective mixing , which extends already throughout the whole envelope .",
    "a major change in the dominant nuclear path is found when @xmath84 k ( panel 4 ) .",
    "the temperature attained near the burning shell is high enough to allow ( p,@xmath4 ) reactions to proceed efficiently . in particular ,",
    "the abundance of @xmath41 mg is reduced by a factor of @xmath65 1000 .",
    "the isomer @xmath1al@xmath80 exceeds already @xmath85 by mass for most of the envelope .",
    "a significant fraction of @xmath78al is transformed through proton captures into @xmath1si , which will increase the abundance of @xmath1al@xmath80 , and in turn that of @xmath40al in the late phases of the tnr .",
    "the final @xmath40al/@xmath1al@xmath79 ratio will reflect a competition between two different paths : @xmath41 mg ( fed by @xmath38na(p,@xmath4)@xmath41 mg ) is transformed by proton captures into @xmath78al , which can either decay into @xmath78 mg or capture another proton , leading to @xmath1si . only the first channel accounts for @xmath1al@xmath79 synthesis , whereas @xmath40al can be produced by both paths , following @xmath78mg(p,@xmath4)@xmath1al@xmath83(p , @xmath4)@xmath40si(@xmath49)@xmath40al , or @xmath1si(@xmath49)@xmath1al@xmath80(@xmath49)@xmath1mg(p , @xmath4)@xmath40al .",
    "anyway , because of the large abundance of @xmath78 mg in the envelope at this stage , proton captures on the seed @xmath86 mg become the major source of @xmath9al@xmath79 .",
    "some leakage from the mgal cycle due to @xmath1al@xmath83(p,@xmath4)@xmath40si is also obtained at this stage of the outburst .",
    "when the burning shell attains its peak temperature ( @xmath87 k. panel 5 ) , most of the mgal isotopes show a significant reduction near the burning shell because of ( p,@xmath4 ) reactions .",
    "the dominant paths at this stage are @xmath78mg(p,@xmath4)@xmath1al@xmath79(p,@xmath4)@xmath40si and @xmath40al(p,@xmath4)@xmath88si , which also account for a significant leakage from the cycle ( moreover , @xmath72si(p,@xmath4 ) are much faster than the corresponding @xmath49-decays ) .",
    "following the course of the outburst ( panels 6 to 8) , as the envelope expands and cools down , proton capture reactions are progressively reduced .",
    "therefore , the late time evolution is mainly dominated by @xmath49-decays , such as @xmath1si(@xmath49)@xmath1al@xmath80 , @xmath40si(@xmath49)@xmath40al , @xmath78al(@xmath49)@xmath78 mg and @xmath1al@xmath80(@xmath49)@xmath1 mg , which in turn , increase the final amounts of @xmath89 mg and @xmath40al .",
    "the mean abundance of @xmath1al in the ejecta of this 1.25 m@xmath7 , one white dwarf model is x(@xmath1al ) = @xmath90 by mass , which translates into @xmath91 m@xmath7 of @xmath1al ejected into the interstellar medium .",

    "in this case , the number of nuclear reactions involved in the synthesis of @xmath9al is rather large ( see fig .",
    "2 ) . several test models of nova outbursts have been computed to analyze the role played by each one of the most relevant reactions .",
    "main results are summarized in table 2 .",
    "the @xmath32na(p,@xmath95 mg rate ( in contrast with @xmath32na(p,@xmath96ne ) has been strongly modified by the introduction of the upper limit for the @xmath97=0.138  mev resonance strength obtained by grres , wiescher & rolfs ( 1989 ) .",

    "some @xmath33al is also overproduced ( by a factor of 1.4 ) when this resonance is taken into account .",
    "those effects are expected to be stronger for more massive white dwarfs .    at the temperatures attained in nova outbursts",

    "the @xmath94mg(p,@xmath99al rate is dominated by the presence of the @xmath97 = 0.214  mev , @xmath102= @xmath103 resonance and suffers little uncertainty .",
    "@xmath86mg(p,@xmath104al@xmath79 is also of great importance since it is the only channel that leads to @xmath9al in its ground state .",
    "one may expect that its potential uncertainties are directly reflected in the @xmath1al@xmath79 yields .",
    "the new rate is significantly smaller by a factor of @xmath617 ( @xcite ) than the @xcite one , below @xmath105 , but this has no consequences in the nova domain .",
    "@xcite reanalyzed available transfer reaction data concerning the lower lying resonances and concluded that the associated uncertainties are relatively small ( i.e. , a factor of 1.52 ) . for @xmath106 ,",
    "available direct measurements lead also to very small uncertainties ( a factor of 1.5 , according to @xcite ) and should not influence significatively @xmath9al production .",
    "moreover , since @xmath86mg(p,@xmath4 ) can lead either to @xmath9al@xmath79 or @xmath9al@xmath80 with a known branching ratio ( endt & rolfs 1987 , iliadis et al .",
    "1996 ) , the @xmath86mg(p,@xmath4)@xmath9al@xmath80 rate is known with a similar precision as the @xmath86mg(p,@xmath4)@xmath9al@xmath79 one .    in nova nucleosynthesis ,",
    "the most important resonance in @xmath9al@xmath79(p,@xmath107si is the @xmath97 = 0.188  mev , while uncertainties on the lower lying resonances have no influence ( coc et al .",
    "1995 ) . in our calculations",
    ", we use the only single direct measurement available ( vogelaar 1989 ) for this crucial resonance strength . recently ,",
    "the results of the proton transfer reaction that motivated this subsequent direct measurement have been published ( vogelaar et al .",
    "1996 ) but the resonance strength deduced from this indirect measurement is strongly dependent on the adopted transferred angular momentum .",
    "accordingly , we have checked the influence of such resonance on the resulting @xmath9al yields by reducing its strength by a factor of 1/3 , well within the range of values adopted by @xcite .",
    "we obtain a significant increase by a factor of @xmath65 2 in the final amount of @xmath9al ( for a 1.15 m@xmath7 one white dwarf model .",

    "@xmath78al(p,@xmath4)@xmath1si plays an important role on @xmath9al synthesis , since it leads to the formation of the short - lived isomer ( through @xmath1si(@xmath49)@xmath1al@xmath80 ) , instead of the long - lived ground state .",
    "we have checked the role played by the @xmath78al(p,@xmath4)@xmath1si rate , adopting the upper and lower estimates ( see appendix ) provided by coc et al .",
    "results are compared with those obtained with the @xmath78al(p,@xmath4)@xmath1si rate given by wiescher et al .",
    "whereas the final amounts of @xmath9al and @xmath33al are very slightly enhanced when the lower rate is adopted ( i.e. , case a. coc et al .",

    "@xmath78al(@xmath49)@xmath78 mg becomes faster than @xmath78al(p,@xmath4)@xmath1si and , therefore , the final amount of @xmath86 mg ( and in turn @xmath9al ) increases ( table 2 ) .",
    "large uncertainties affect the @xmath1al@xmath80(p,@xmath4)@xmath40si rate .",
    "the existing caughlan & fowler s ( 1988 ) prescription for this rate results from a hauser - feschbach calculation , a statistical approach that is not reliable at low temperatures , where the contribution of isolated resonances dominates .",
    "hence , the rate may differ by several orders of magnitude from the theoretical one at the temperatures achieved during nova outbursts .",
    "however , no noticeable effect on @xmath1al production is found when the @xmath1al@xmath80(p,@xmath4)@xmath40si rate , as given by cf88 , is multiplied arbitrarily by a factor of 100 , with the exception of a net reduction ( factor @xmath65 2 ) on the final amount of @xmath9 mg .",
    "nuclear uncertainties significantly affect the @xmath9mg(p,@xmath107al rate .",
    "since the initial amount of @xmath9 mg is of the same order of magnitude than that of @xmath33al , and it is also fed continuously by @xmath9al@xmath80(@xmath109 mg ( @xmath110 = 9.15  s ) , these uncertainties can not be ignored as for @xmath2ne(p,@xmath111na ( see section 3.2 ) .",
    "they are specially important around @xmath112 , where the rate remains uncertain by a factor of @xmath113 ( champagne et al .",
    "1990 ) , due to the unknown strength of an hypothetical resonance at @xmath114 = 90  kev .",
    "no influence on the final @xmath72al yields results from the inclusion of the @xmath1mg(p,@xmath4)@xmath40al recommended rate given by champagne et al .",

    "1994 , wiescher et al .",
    "1986 , and also wiescher et al .",
    "1986 , respectively ) .",
    "constraints on the synthesis of @xmath0na and @xmath1al during nova outbursts have been derived by means of hydrodynamic calculations involving one white dwarfs of masses 1.15 , 1.25 and 1.35 m@xmath7 , assuming lower , recommended and upper estimates for several key reactions of the nena - mgal cycles .",
    "table 3 lists the set of reaction rates adopted for the calculation of minimum to maximum @xmath0na and @xmath1al production , compared with the rates adopted in jos & hernanz ( 1998 ) . the specific choice adopted for these three sets",
    "is directly determined by the range of nuclear uncertainties accompanying the rates .",
    "the corresponding yields obtained with the different nuclear reaction networks , which are summarized in tables 4 to 6 , allow to derive error bars to the synthesis of @xmath0na and @xmath1al . since we have not included other sources of uncertainty ( convection , modelization of the explosion , ... ) these error bars are only of nuclear physics origin .",
    "the early stages of the outburst are mainly dominated by the cno cycle ( jos & hernanz 1998 ) .",
    "therefore , the update of the nuclear reaction rates of the nena - mgal cycles has no influence on the characteristics of the accretion phase ( for instance , the duration of the accretion phase , @xmath119 , or the mass of the accreted envelope , @xmath120 ) .",
    "differences in the time evolution appear when the temperature near the burning shell reaches @xmath121 k. at this stage , energy generation by nuclear reactions involves a relevant contribution from the nena - mgal cycles , together with the hot and cold modes of the cno cycle .",
    "the use of updated rates modifies several properties of the tnr , such as the time required for a temperature rise from @xmath122 k up to @xmath123 k ( hereafter , @xmath124 ) .",
    "for instance , a value of @xmath125 s was found for model one5 ( jos & hernanz 1998 ) , whereas a shorter time , @xmath126 s , has been obtained in model one125b , computed with updated ( recommended ) rates .",
    "the role played by the nena - mgal cycles increases when the temperature at the location of the burning shell exceeds @xmath127 k. this has an important effect on the energy production as well as on the resulting peak temperature achieved during the tnr .",
    "for instance , peak values for the nuclear energy generation rate and temperature achieved in model one5 , @xmath128 @xmath129 and @xmath130 k , translate into @xmath131 @xmath129 and @xmath132 k , for model one125b .",
    "a similar trend was also pointed out by starrfield et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , using updated nuclear reaction rates with respect to caughlan & fowler s ( 1988 ) ones .",
    "such differences have also some influence on the last phases of the evolution , when the envelope expands , cools down and eventually a fraction of the formerly accreted shells is ejected . in general , we find that models computed with updated rates lead to slightly larger ejected masses with larger mean kinetic energies ( see tables 46 ) as a result of the larger @xmath133 attained .",
    "it is worth noticing that these differences in the properties of the tnrs will be reflected in the accompanying nucleosynthesis .",
    "the reason is twofold : first , the update of the reaction rates implies a certain modification of the nuclear paths . and second , the differences found in the time evolution as well as on the peak temperatures achieved modify the role played by ( p,@xmath4 ) and ( p,@xmath52 ) reactions .      due to the higher peak temperatures achieved in the models computed with the updated network ( recommended rates .",
    "see tables 46 ) , @xmath42ne is slightly reduced in the ejecta with respect to previous results obtained with older rates ( jos & hernanz 1998 ) .",
    "differences are rather small ( i.e. , a mean mass fraction of 0.17 by mass , instead of 0.18 , results for the 1.15 & 1.25 m@xmath7 models ) , but they turn out to be important to determine the synthesis of less abundant species within the nena cycle .",
    "for instance , the abundance of @xmath53ne increases by a factor between @xmath134 ( the higher temperatures as well as the lower rate adopted for @xmath48na(p,@xmath4)@xmath2 mg favor the chain @xmath37ne(p,@xmath4)@xmath48na(@xmath49)@xmath48ne ) , however no significant change is found for @xmath0ne ( which is essentially reduced by ( p,@xmath4 ) reactions from its initial amount ) .",
    "worth noticing is also the net increase in the final amount of @xmath0na in the ejecta : a factor of @xmath135 for the 1.15 & 1.25 m@xmath7 models ( resulting from the lower rates adopted for @xmath54na(p,@xmath4)@xmath47 mg ) .",
    "this may have important consequences for gamma - ray astronomy , since it translates into a change by a factor of @xmath108 in the maximum expected distance at which the 1275 kev @xmath0na line emitted by an exploding one novae would be eventually detected .",
    "other isotopes , such as @xmath38na and @xmath78 mg , are also overproduced ( except for the 1.35 m@xmath7 model ) , but less efficiently . as a result",
    ", the isotopic ratios @xmath38na/@xmath0na decrease by nearly a factor of @xmath136 .",
    "the abundances of the other magnesium isotopes , @xmath137 mg , are slightly enhanced ( in some cases even by a factor of @xmath138 ) .",
    "another interesting feature is that @xmath1al remains essentially unaffected by the update of the network when the recomended rates are used . therefore , the conclusions relative to the small contribution of classical nova outbursts to the synthesis of the galactic @xmath1al ( see jos , hernanz & coc 1997 ) still hold .",
    "since the amount of @xmath40al ( and that of @xmath88si ) in the ejecta remains essentially unchanged , no variation on the isotopic ratio @xmath1al/@xmath40al is found .",
    "another relevant outcome from the nucleosynthetic viewpoint is the dispersion in the mean ejected abundances obtained when the uncertainties associated with the nuclear reaction rates are taken into account . in the following , we will analyse the impact of such uncertainties in the resulting mean abundances in the ejecta . for that purpose",
    ", we will compare the yields obtained when the two extreme networks listed in table 3 ( i.e. , a and c , leading to maximum and minimum @xmath0na-@xmath1al production , respectively ) are adopted .",
    "we define the _ dispersion factor _ , @xmath139 , as the ratio between the mean ejected abundances of a given nuclear species obtained when network a and c are adopted . all models computed ( i.e. , involving 1.15 , 1.25 or 1.35 m@xmath7 white dwarfs ) show a very small dispersion in the @xmath42ne yields , which results essentially from the different peak temperatures attained at the envelope rather than from uncertainties in the nuclear reactions ( such as @xmath42ne(p,@xmath4)@xmath53na ) .",
    "no relevant dispersion is found either for @xmath0ne , @xmath38na , @xmath40al , and @xmath88si . on the contrary ,",
    "the @xmath53ne yields show a rather wide dispersion : a factor @xmath140 in the 1.35 m@xmath7 models .",
    "concerning @xmath0na , differences between @xmath141 are found .",
    "similar degrees of dispersion are also obtained for the magnesium isotopes , with @xmath139 ranging from 3 to 5 in the case of @xmath78 mg and from 2 to 3 for @xmath41 mg .",
    "dispersion factors between 0.3 and 0.7 result for @xmath1 mg .",
    "the variation in the ejected amounts of @xmath1al is particularly worth noticing , with a dispersion factor ranging from @xmath142 4 to 7 ( not considering the possible uncertainty associated with the 188 kev resonance in @xmath9al@xmath79(p,@xmath4)@xmath33si ) . also interesting",
    "to notice is the fact that the @xmath1al/@xmath40al ratio remains in the range 0.50.1 ( see tables 46 ) .    in view of the abovementioned analysis ,",
    "the nuclear uncertainties accompanying the reaction rates within the nena - mgal cycles introduce a relatively wide dispersion in the yields resulting from classical nova outbursts .",
    "therefore , predictions of @xmath0na and @xmath1al yields would benefit from new nuclear physics experiments aimed at reducing the uncertainties associated with some key reactions of the nena - mgal cycles , in particular @xmath48na(p , @xmath4)@xmath2 mg and @xmath86al(p,@xmath4)@xmath9si whose rates are uncertain by several orders of magnitude but also @xmath32na(p,@xmath95 mg and @xmath2na(p , @xmath4)@xmath32 mg .",

    "the most relevant conclusions extracted from this work can be summarized as follows :    \\1 . the update of the nuclear reaction network results in a net increase in the final amount of @xmath0na ejected into the interstellar medium during classical nova outburts .",
    "this translates into an increase ( by a factor of @xmath108 ) of the expected maximum distance at which an exploding one nova would be eventually detected through its emission at 1275 kev ( @xmath0na decay @xmath4-ray line ) .",

    "neutron spectroscopic factors were obtained by @xcite for many @xmath2ne levels , from @xmath174=0 to 9.07  mev , but not for the @xmath174=6.120  mev one due to its very low population and flat angular distribution . indeed , the direct comparison of peak heights in the experimental spectrum ( fig .  1 , neogy et al .",

    "1972 ) is very flat , indicating no evidence for a direct component and hence a very small neutron spectroscopic factor .",
    "this conclusion can be extended to the proton spectroscopic factor in the @xmath2na mirror level .",
    "the 6.551  mev @xmath2na level , is assumed ( endt 1990,endt 1998 ) to belong to the same isospin triplet as the 6.120  mev @xmath2ne level .",

    "( 1972 ) data and would result , for the 5.714  mev @xmath2 mg level , in a proton width in excess of the measured , 16.5  mev , total width .",
    "hence one may question the isospin triplet assignment made by endt ( 1990 ) and endt ( 1998 ) .",
    "moreover , the 5.714  mev @xmath2 mg level is withdrawn from the triplet in the last paper by endt ( 1998 ) .",

    "we provide below the updated formula for the rate including the uncertainty factors and the direct capture contribution from caughlan & fowler ( 1988 ) : @xmath187 the third term corresponds to the 5.837  mev level , assuming that the analog assignment made by endt ( 1990 ) is correct .",
