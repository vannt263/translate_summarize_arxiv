    "the antennae ( ngc  4038/4039 ) are a pair of disk galaxies in an early stage of merging which contain numerous massive super star clusters ( sscs ) along their spiral arms and around their interaction region @xcite .",
    "the molecular gas distribution peaks at both nuclei and in the overlap region @xcite , but the gas is not yet undergoing a global starburst typical of more advanced mergers @xcite .",
    "star formation in starbursts appears to occur preferentially in sscs .",
    "we chose to observe the antennae because their proximity permits an unusually detailed view of the first generation of merger - induced sscs and their influence on the surrounding interstellar medium .",
    "the infrared space observatory ( iso ) @xmath18 m image showed that the hot dust distribution is similar to that of the gas , but peaks at an otherwise inconspicuous point on the southern edge of the overlap region @xcite .",
    "this powerful starburst knot is also a flat - spectrum radio continuum source @xcite and may be associated with an x - ray source @xcite .",
    "we imaged the region around this knot , and discovered a bright compact star cluster coincident with the mid - ir peak .",
    "we obtained moderate - resolution ( r @xmath5 ) k - band spectra of both the obscured cluster and the ngc  4039 nucleus .",
    "nirspec is a new facility infrared ( @xmath19 m ) spectrometer for the keck - ii telescope , commissioned during april through july , 1999 @xcite .",
    "it has a cross - dispersed cryogenic echelle with r @xmath20 , and a low resolution mode with r @xmath21 .",
    "the spectrometer detector is a 1024 @xmath22 1024 insb aladdin focal plane array , and the ir slit - viewing camera detector is a 256 @xmath22 256 hgcdte picnic array .",
    "we observed the antennae with nirspec during the june 1999 commissioning run .",
    "slit - viewing camera ( scam ) images at 2 @xmath4 m reveal that the mid - ir iso peak is a bright ( k @xmath23 ) compact star cluster located 20.4 east and 4.7 north of the k - band nucleus .",
    "this cluster is associated with a faint ( v @xmath24 ) red ( v@xmath3i @xmath25 ) source ( # 80 in @xcite ) visible with space telescope ( whitmore & zhang , private communication ) .",
    "we obtained low resolution ( r @xmath26 ) @xmath27 m spectra through a @xmath28 slit at pa=77@xmath29 located on the obscured star cluster and the nucleus of ngc  4039 .",
    "the total integration time on source was 2100 s.    we dark - subtracted , mean - sky - subtracted , flat - fielded , and corrected two - dimensional spectra for bad pixels and cosmic rays before rectifying the curved order onto a grid in which wavelength and slit position are perpendicular .",
    "we then corrected for residual sky emission and divided by a b1.5 standard star spectrum to correct for atmospheric absorption .",
    "the object spectra were extracted using a gaussian weighting function matched to their strong continuua collapsed in wavelength ( intrinsic fwhm = 0.84 for cluster , 0.99 for nucleus ) and @xmath30 ( intrinsic ) , due to the extended line contribution and rectification errors of order @xmath31 1 pixel at the chip edges . ] , and then an aperture correction was applied to recover the full flux in the continuua .",
    "thus we neglected more - extended h@xmath32 emission , which has maximum fwhm @xmath33 in the cluster and @xmath34 in the nucleus .",
    "we obtained a flux scale by requiring the 2.2 @xmath4 m star flux to equal that corresponding to its k magnitude .",
    "reduced spectra are shown in figures 1 and 2 .",

    "the nebular emission lines are slightly more extended than the continuum , and the h@xmath32 emission is even more extended .",
    "this suggests a picture in which hot stars and dust are embedded in a giant compact h  ii region surrounded by clumpy ( see  3.2 ) clouds of obscuring gas and dust whose surfaces are ionized and photodissociated by fuv photons escaping from the star cluster .    for a distance to the antennae of 19 mpc ( h@xmath37=75 km s@xmath38 mpc@xmath38 , 1= 93 pc ) @xcite",

    "we find a@xmath43 mag , which implies m@xmath44 , adopting a@xmath45 ( which is confirmed by our analysis of the recombination lines in  3.1 ) .",
    "we can use the intrinsic brightness along with the lyman continuum flux inferred from the de - reddened br@xmath46 flux ( @xmath47 erg s@xmath38 @xmath48 ) , q(h@xmath49 photons s@xmath38 , to constrain the cluster mass and age . using instantaneous starburst99 models",
    "we find a total mass of @xmath50 m@xmath8 ( with @xmath51 o stars ) for a salpeter imf extending from 1 to 100 m@xmath52 , and an age of @xmath6 myr .",
    "this age is consistent with the lack of photospheric co and metal absorption lines from red supergiants and other cool giants , which would begin to contribute significantly to the 2 @xmath4 m light at an age of @xmath53 myr @xcite .",
    "the cluster s density is then about 115 m@xmath8 pc@xmath10 for stars of 0.1@xmath3100 m@xmath8 within a half - light radius of @xmath54 pc .",
    "this density is 30 times less than that of the lmc ssc , r136 ( within a radius of 1.7 pc , assuming a salpeter proportion of low - mass stars ) @xcite .",
    "thus the antennae cluster may be a complex of clusters rather than one massive cluster .",
    "- nirspec spectrum of ngc  4039 nucleus shows extended collisionally excited h@xmath32 emission and a strong stellar continuum marked by photospheric absorption .",
    "no br@xmath46 is present .",
    "scaled sky counts are shown at 1.5 mjy .",
    "the cluster spectrum features a variety of nebular lines that reveal information about the conditions in the ionized gas around the cluster , which in turn allows us to constrain the effective temperature of the ionizing stars .",
    "we detected pfund series lines from pf  19 to pf  38 , and display their fluxes relative to that of br@xmath46 in figure 3 .",
    "the filled symbols give fluxes for the blends pf 28+h@xmath32 2@xmath31 s(0 ) and pf 29 + [ ] .",
    "they fall well above the other points , which follow closely the theoretical expectation for intensities relative to br@xmath46 ( solid curve ) with no reddening applied , for a gas with n@xmath55 cm@xmath10 and t@xmath56 k @xcite .",
    "excluding the two known blends , the best - fit foreground screen extinction is a@xmath57 mag ( dashed curve ) , assuming the extinction law of @xcite and evaluated at 2.2 @xmath4 m .",
    "we consider this an upper limit on a@xmath58 because a close look at the spectrum shows that the points above the dashed line in figure 3 for pf 22@xmath324 at 2.404 , 2.393 , and 2.383 @xmath4 m may also be blended or contaminated by sky emission , implying a lower a@xmath59 and a much better fit to the theory .",

    "filled symbols represent lines that are known blends , and the dashed curve shows theoretical fluxes with the best - fit extinction a@xmath45 mag .",
    "the lack of a strong pfund discontinuity at 2.28 @xmath4 m indicates that nebular free - free and bound - free continuum is diluted by starlight and dust emission ( signaled by the rising continuum toward longer @xmath62 ) in the cluster .    the ratios of [ ] lines are nebular density diagnostics ; table 1 presents observed ratios and theoretical predictions of @xcite for emission from a collisionally excited 10@xmath63 k gas , as tabulated by @xcite",
    ". the ratios of [ ] 2.146 @xmath4 m and [ ] 2.243 @xmath4 m to [ ] 2.218 @xmath4 m are consistent with n@xmath64 cm@xmath10 .",
    "the ratio [ ] 2.348 @xmath4m/ [ ] 2.218 @xmath4 m is 20% higher than its theoretical value , which is roughly constant over all of parameter space @xcite , but [ ] 2.348 @xmath4 m is blended with pf 29 and subject to measurement errors that are larger than the difference in extinctions in question ( see figure 3 ) .",
    "even the minimum value we infer for this ratio , with @xmath65 , is significantly greater than the model prediction .",
    "high values of [ ] 2.348 @xmath4m/ [ ] 2.218 @xmath4 m were also found by @xcite in orion .",
    "this discrepancy may be due to blending with another unknown line , or to theoretical error ; ratios from the latest calculations have an average deviation from data of 10% @xcite .",
    "line ratios can in principal be used to infer nebular temperature t@xmath66 , and are fairly insensitive to n@xmath66 . however , of the three lines we detected , two are not suitable for such an analysis : the 2.1615 + 2.1624 @xmath4 m blend falls on the wing of strong br  @xmath46 so its flux has a large ( 50% ) measurement error , and the strong 2.0589 @xmath4 m line is subject to radiative transfer and density effects .",
    "the 2.0589 @xmath4m / br  @xmath46 ratio is an indicator of the t@xmath67 of hot stars in regions @xcite , although it is sensitive to nebular conditions such as the relative volumes and ionization fractions of he@xmath68 and h@xmath68 , geometry , density , dustiness , etc . @xcite .",
    "@xcite studied h and he excitation in a sample of starburst galaxies and regions .",
    "for starbursts they found evidence for high - t@xmath67 , low - n@xmath66 ( @xmath69 @xmath48 ) ionized gas from 2.0589 @xmath4m / br  @xmath46 ratios of 0.22 to 0.64 .",
    "this is consistent with giant extended regions expected to dominate the emission - line spectra of typical starbursts .",
    "the ultra - compact regions were characterized by higher ratios ( 0.8@xmath30.9 ) and higher densities , @xmath70 10@xmath63 cm@xmath10 .",
    "the cluster has a flux ratio of 0.70 , a value between the two object classes of @xcite .",
    "assuming the line emission is purely nebular , this ratio is consistent with a high - density ( 10@xmath63 cm@xmath10 ) model of @xcite , and implies t@xmath71 k for the assumed model parameters .",
