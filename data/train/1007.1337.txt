    "recently , motivated by theoretical considerations developed a long time ago by veselago @xcite and following insights from pendry and coworkers @xcite , shelby , schultz , smith and colleagues @xcite have been able to build , for the first time , by combining arrays of wires and split - ring resonators , an artificial medium for which the electric permittivity , the magnetic permeability and therefore the refractive index are simultaneously negative in the microwave frequency range .",
    "they have thus opened a new era for optics because in negative - refractive - index media ( also called left - handed materials or double - negative media ) , electromagnetism presents unusual properties due to various anomalous effects such as reversed doppler shift , reversed cerenkov radiation , negative radiation pressure and inverse snell - descartes law @xcite .",
    "since then , several other groups have successfully fabricated left - handed media and it is now possible to test and to exploit left - handed electromagnetism \" in a large range of frequencies .",
    "of course , the unusual and remarkable properties of negative - refractive - index media could revolutionize optics , optoelectronics and communications and , as a consequence , this recent and rapidly evolving new field of physics has attracted interest of many researchers and many technological applications are already considered including superlenses , band - pass filters , beam guiders , light - emitting devices , cloaking devices ...    in this article , we shall focus our attention on a particular problem of left - handed electromagnetism namely the propagation of surface polaritons in a curved slab made of a negative - refractive - index material and we shall study the effects of curvature on their dispersion relations and attenuations . surface polaritons ( and other guided modes ) supported by a left - handed flat slab have been studied extensively in the recent years ( see , e.g. , ruppinpla2001,shadrivov2003,raoong2003,parkleefuzhang2005,shadrivov2005 , hecaoshen2005,shadrivov2006,darmanyankobyakovchowdhury2007,moreaufelbacq2008,wangli2008 ) due to the central role that they seem to play in the superlensing phenomenon @xcite and in the giant goos - hnchen effect @xcite as well as due to their other potential applications , for example , if we have in mind the development of unconventional photonic integrated circuits and ultra - compact plasmon - based integrated circuits .    in the left - handed flat slab configuration",
    ", we can consider that the properties of surface polaritons are now completely known .",
    "they have been obtained from rather elementary calculations involving homogeneous and inhomogeneous plane waves . to our knowledge , there exists no description of surface polaritons guided by a left - handed curved slab despite the interest of this problem .",
    "indeed , these surface polaritons are necessary in order to explain the resonant behavior of hollow left - handed nanoparticles ruppin2005  or of coaxial cylindrical cables made of negative - index metamaterials @xcite and they could be used to transmit efficiently information by using curved waveguides .",
    "mathematically , the description of surface polaritons guided by curved interfaces can be achieved in the framework of complex angular momentum techniques or , in other words , by using the regge pole machinery watson18,sommerfeld49,nus92,grandy . in optics ,",
    "such techniques permit one to naturally shed light on the physics lying behind the transcendental equations involving non - elementary special functions which usually appear in the description of surface waves propagating close to a curved interface .",
    "recently , these techniques have been used in order to describe surface polaritons guided by single interfaces separating a dispersive medium and an ordinary one ( see berrymv1975,anceydecaninifolaccigabrielli1,anceydecaninifolaccigabrielli2 , anceydecaninifolaccigabrielli3,anceydecaninifolaccigabrielli4,hasegawanockeldeutsch1 , hasegawanockeldeutsch2 ) . in the present article , we shall apply these techniques in order to analyze the properties of surface polaritons guided in a left - handed cylindrical slab .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we briefly recall the theory of surface polaritons guided in a left - handed flat slab embedded in an ordinary dielectric medium .",
    "we note that these surface polaritons propagate without any losses and we more particularly emphasize the existence of frequency ranges where they present a left - handed behavior \" , i.e. with opposite group and phase velocities . in section 3 , we extend our analysis to the case of a left - handed cylindrical slab and we consider the effects of its curvature on surface polariton properties .",
    "we observe that curvature slightly modifies the dispersion relations of the surface polaritons while , in general , it can lead to important attenuations .",
    "however , it is worth pointing out that curvature does not induce any losses for some surface polaritons and , in particular , for those presenting a left - handed behavior . in section 4 ,",
    "we recall the main results of our work and briefly discuss some possible practical applications .",
    "it should be noted that , in our article , we implicitly assume the time dependence @xmath0 for all the fields .",
    "we consider a symmetric slab of thickness @xmath1 made of a negative - refractive - index material ( region ii ) imbedded in a host medium ( region i ) with electric permittivity @xmath2 and magnetic permeability @xmath3 both frequency independent ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : slab ] for the geometry of the system and the notations ) . as far as the electric permittivity @xmath4 and the magnetic permeability @xmath5 of the slab are concerned , we assume they are respectively given by @xmath6and @xmath7where @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "of course , the parameters @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 depend on the structure of the negative - refractive - index material but we do not attribute any microscopic \" interpretation to them .",

    "thus , the electric permittivity , the magnetic permeability and the refractive index are simultaneously negative in the region @xmath17 . in that region",
    "the metamaterial presents a left - handed behavior .",

    "it is therefore very interesting to know that it is possible to transmit information without loss by using left - handed curved waveguides and that this can be achieved by using surface polaritons with unusual properties .",
    "finally , it should be noted that , in this article , we have restricted to surface polaritons our study of the modes guided in a left - handed curved slab .",
    "it is important to recall that such a waveguide is in fact a very rich system : indeed , in addition to the surface polaritons considered here , there also exists an infinite family of oscillating guided modes already present on the left - handed flat slab as well as an infinity of new guided modes of whispering - gallery - type which have no analogs in the flat slab case .",
    "they could also play an important role in the context of nanoparticle physics ( in order to fully understand the resonant properties of hollow spheres made of a negative - refractive - index material ) or in the context of optical transmission of information .",
