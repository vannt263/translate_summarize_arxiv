    "this idea has been followed by many other proposals giving rise , at low energy , to such kind of effective models . to cite only a few connections to the physics of dimers , related again to magnetism",
    ", the lowest - energy configurations of fully frustrated ising magnets can generally be mapped onto dimer configurations on the dual lattice  @xcite .",
    "other specific ( quantum ) dimer models have recently been derived from a spin - orbital model describing linio@xmath1 @xcite , from the trimerized _ kagome _ antiferromagnet @xcite , or for heisenberg antiferromagnets under applied field in the pyrochlore lattice  @xcite .",
    "lastly , we note that hard - core bosons or correlated fermions on frustrated lattices like the planar pyrochlore lattice can also be mapped onto dimer representations in the limit of large coulomb repulsion  @xcite .",
    "although the rk model is quantum mechanical , there is a special value of the parameters of the hamiltonian for which the ground - state is an equal weight superposition of all dimer tilings of the square lattice ( rk point ) .",
    "static properties at zero temperature can then be understood by the purely combinatorial problem of counting dimer tilings of the square lattice first solved in the early 60 s  @xcite .",
    "this system turns out to be a critical model , and more precisely a conformal field theory with central charge @xmath2 .",
    "subsequently to the rk work , moessner and sondhi @xcite have shown that the same dimer model on the triangular lattice shows , instead of a single point with critical algebraic correlations , a disordered phase with short range dimer correlations - as expected from the known physics of its classical counterpart  @xcite . from the interpretation originally given to the dimers ,",
    "it is legitimate to call this phase a spin liquid .",
    "more recently , a study performed by alet _ et al .",
    "_  @xcite on a square lattice classical dimer model showed the existence of a kosterlitz - thouless phase transition from a critical phase to a columnar ordered phase for the dimers .",
    "this transition is triggered by including an interaction term , consisting in the number of plaquettes doubly occupied by parallel dimers .",
    "subsequently , a quantum mechanical dimer model can be built from this classical model proving that the single point showing criticality in the original rk hamiltonian can be promoted to a whole critical phase  @xcite .",
    "an important difference between the square and the triangular lattices for quantum dimer models lies in the degeneracy of the ground state at the rk point : it is finite for the triangular lattice with periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) and scales exponentially with the linear size for the square lattice with the same pbc ( see ref .   and ref .",
    "respectively for details ) .",
    "this large degeneracy of the square lattice , related to its bipartiteness , has been often designated as the responsible of the existence of critical correlations in this case .",

    "on the square lattice , dimers are found to be in a critical phase : dimer - dimer correlations decay algebraically as @xmath6 with relative distance @xmath7 , whereas the monomer - monomer ( defining a monomer as a site with no dimer ) correlations behave as @xmath8 .",

    "monomer - monomer correlations decay to @xmath12 at long distances , either algebraically ( in the critical phase ) or exponentially ( in the columnar phase ) . from now on , unless it is specified otherwise , we set @xmath13 and let the different dimer - dimer interactions ( @xmath3 for the purely square lattice ) vary .",

    "[ def]a ) .",
    "the same line - shifting modes provide only a much smaller ( @xmath121 ) degeneracy for vertical or diagonal ground - states .",

    "consequently , in the limit of large @xmath124 , we expect horizontal line - shifting modes to predominate .",
    "if there is long - range order in the system , the previous analysis indicates that the long cylinder geometry induces a preferential ordering in the horizontal dimers ( for entropic reasons ) .",

    "as soon as @xmath3 is larger than @xmath4 , the mean occupation of horizontal links @xmath137 is @xmath138 at zero temperature , which is consistent with the fact that , as in the purely square columnar state , only @xmath139 configurations have the minimal energy .",
    "nevertheless , the ordering occurring when @xmath3 increases is characterized by larger values of @xmath128 in an intermediate temperature range .",
    "as @xmath49 increases , the maximal value of @xmath137 gets closer to @xmath0 , which is the value found in the ordered phase discussed previously in the isotropic case . notice that the extent of the temperature range where @xmath137 approaches @xmath0 increases with the length @xmath33 of the system ( see @xmath140 curves in the fig .",

    "our numerical results therefore seem to be consistent with a finite temperature ordering of the isotropic lattice model , probably triggered by an order by disorder mechanism  @xcite .",
    "the sharp behavior of both specific heat and `` order parameter '' at the transition ( see fig .  [ m1m2 ] ) , as well as the absence of any criticality behavior in the central charge , suggests that this transition is first order .",

    "another insight could be given by monte carlo simulations for this model .",
    "we expect however these simulations to be difficult as the presence of the low - energy modes ( and the corresponding large degeneracy of the ground - state ) will certainly induce ergodicity and freezing problems in the monte carlo process  @xcite .",

    "to summarize , we have constructed a simple classical interacting dimer model on a lattice that interpolates between square and triangular lattices .",

    "it is of interest that such a behavior appears immediately for arbitrary small fugacity of diagonal bonds so that one can view the typical behavior of the square lattice as a `` singular '' limit .",
    "however , we note that the critical phase itself survives in an extended vicinity of the square lattice model ( although its extension in temperature jumps abruptly ) and this stability is therefore _ not _ related to the bipartiteness of the lattice . while the critical phase disappears progressively with increasing interaction anisotropy , the ordered phase survives for any range of anisotropy , as well as the high - t liquid dimer .",
