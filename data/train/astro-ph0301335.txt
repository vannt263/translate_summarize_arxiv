    "the `` butterfly star '' in taurus , iras  04302 + 2247 , is a class  i source located in the vicinity of lynds  1536b dark cloud .",
    "its near - infrared appearance is dominated by a totally opaque band that bisects the scattered light nebulosity . as pointed out by padgett et al .",
    "1999 , the apparent thickness of the extinction band decreases by about 30% from 1.1  @xmath0 m to 2.05  @xmath0 m , accounting for the reddening seen alonge its edges . a further strong evidence on the interpretation of the dark lane as a circumstellar disk seen precisely edge - on comes from @xmath1co(1 - 0 ) mapping obtained at the owens valley millimeter array ( padgett et al .",
    "these observations indicate that the dark lane coincides with a dense rotating disk of molecular gas .",
    "former attempts to model the circumstellar environment of iras  04302 + 2247 have been undertaken by lucas & roche ( 1997 , 1998a ; see also lucas & roche 1998b ) .",
    "the slight quadrupolar morphology of the object ( therefore the alias `` butterfly star '' - lucas & roche  1997 ) was assumed to be resulting from a circumstellar shell representing the late stage of contraction of an initially spherical non - magnetic cloud combined with a cavity and an embedded opaque jet parallel to the axis of the angular momentum of the cloud .",
    "based on the ( later ) findings of a circumstellar disk mentioned above , we model the source as a combination of a disk plus a circumstellar envelope .",
    "the slight ( mirror ) symmetry , found also in the high - resolution _",
    "hst_/nicmos images of the source , is modeled under the assumption of an optically thin outflow cone .",
    "we base our modelling on the following observations : ( 1 ) resolved 1.3 mm and 2.7 mm maps of the disk obtained with the _ owens valley radio observatory _ ( ovro ) , and ( 2 ) high - resolution near - infrared images obtained with _",
    "hst_/nicmos at 1.10@xmath0 m , 1.60@xmath0 m , 1.87@xmath0 m , and 2.05@xmath0 m .",
    "while the millimeter observations are sensitive only to radiation being emitted from dust in the dense region within the disk , the near - infrared images are dominated by scattering of the stellar light on the dust in the circumstellar envelope and the disk `` surface '' .",
    "these observations trace different physical processes in different regions of the circumstellar environment , but are both strongly related to the dust properties in the system .",
    "thus , we are in the position not only to model both components separately and to find the best model on the basis of common ( geometrical ) parameters , but may also investigate whether the dust can be the same in the two components or not . the latter possibility has been suggested by investigations on the dust grain evolution in circumstellar disk where dust grain growth alters the dust grain properties in the circumstellar disk significantly while it is of less importance in the low - density envelope ( see , e.g. , weidenschilling  1997a , 1997b ) .",
    "we concentrate on modelling the circumstellar disk , and compare and verify our results with simple models for the rather complex and highly - structured envelope .",
    "our millimeter and near - infrared observations and data reduction are described in brief in  [ observations ] . in  [ modgen ]",
    "we discuss the chosen models of both the circumstellar disk and envelope (  [ diskstruc ] ) , define the main heating sources of the dust (  [ heat ] ) , compile the properties of the considered dust model (  [ dust ] ) , and give a short overview about the radiative transfer model (  [ mc3d ] ) .",
    "based on the millimeter maps the parameters of the circumstellar disk are derived in  [ modmm ] and compared with the results of the subsequent near - infrared light - scattering simulations in  [ nircons ] .",

    "while the circumstellar disk is assumed to be responsible both for the dark lane in the optical / infrared wavelength range and the millimeter structure of the object , an additional envelope is required to explain the extended scattered light structure .",
    "although an infalling envelope , seen perpendicular to their axis of rotation symmetry , may also create a dark lane which hides the central star at optical / infrared wavelengths ( see , e.g. , lucas & roche  1997 ) , the observed sharp transition of the dark lane towards the scattered light regions , which could be resolved for the first time in our nicmos / hst images , points to the presence of a disk .    for the disk",

    "for the envelope we assume a density profile resulting from mass infall under consideration of envelope rotation ( ulrich  1976 ) : @xmath24 here , @xmath25 is the mass of the central star , @xmath26 is the infall rate , @xmath27 is the centrifugal radius , @xmath28 is the polar angle between the radial vector of the particle and the z axis , and @xmath29 defines the direction of the initial streamline of the infalling material . for @xmath30 , the density shows a steep decrease which is in agreement with the spectral energy distributions ( sed ) of class  i sources ( see , e.g. , butner et al .  1991 ) and the flux distribution of class  0 sources in the radio wavelength range ( see , e.g. , ward - thompson et al .",
    "the density varies more slowly towards smaller radii , achieving @xmath31 for @xmath32 .",
    "the main heating source for the circumstellar environment is the embedded star .",

    "the bolometric luminosity of the object ( @xmath35 , padgett et al .",
    "1999 ) may be used as a lower limit for the stellar luminosity . however , this is only a weak constraint since it could be derived from the scattered light only , the amount of which is also determined by the  rather complex  structure of the circumstellar envelope ( see yorke & bodenheimer  1999 for the `` flashlight '' effect ) . for a similar reason , namely the unknown amount and optical properties of the light - scattering dust in the circumstellar envelope , it is too vague to derive the effective temperature of the star from the sed of the scattered light . for these reasons",
    "we assume typical parameters of a t  tauri star : @xmath36 , @xmath37 ( gullbring  1998 ) which correspond to a luminosity of @xmath38 under the assumption of a blackbody .",
    "as it finally turned out , the particular choice of a @xmath39 combination within the range of typical values for t tauri stars is of much less importance than ( a ) the geometry and mass of the disk and ( b ) the dust grain properties .",
    "further heating of the disk is provided by accretion , whereby we assume the source of radiation being located in the midplane of the disk . applying the viscous disk model by lynden - bell & pringle ( 1974 ) , the accretion luminosity @xmath40 of a circular ring with the surface @xmath41 and a radius @xmath17",

    "_ grain shape : _ we consider the dust grains to be homogeneous spheres .",
    "although dust grains are expected to have a fractal structure , the scattering behaviour is similar to that of spheres ( see lumme & rahola  1994 for porous dust particle light scattering ) . furthermore",
    ", dust grains are expected to have a non - spherical shape ( see , e.g. , elvius & hall  1967 , scarrott et al .",

    "however , since we do not expect the grains to be aligned on a large scale by magnetic fields and thus , the assumption of spherical grains is a valid approximation ( wolf et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "_ grain chemistry : _ the strong absorption observed at 9.7 and 18  @xmath0 m , corresponding to stretching and bending modes in silicates on the one hand , and the strong extinction feature at 0.2175  @xmath0 m which can be approximately be reproduced by small graphite particles on the other hand ( stecher & donn  1965 ; wickramasinghe & guillaume  1965 ) , are the basis of a widely applied grain model : it incorporates both silicate and graphite material , represented in two separate grain populations .",
    "we use the optical data , i.e. , the complex refractive index , of `` smoothed astronomical silicate '' and graphite published by weingartner & draine  2001 draine . ] .",
    "since the longest wavelength considered in our self - consistent radiative transfer ( rt ) simulations is 2 mm and the longest wavelength to be considered for image modelling is 2.74 mm , we extrapolate the refractive indexes on the basis of the astronomical silicate and graphite data published by draine & lee  ( 1984 ) , ensuring a smooth transition between both data sets . for graphite",

    "have shown , this graphite model is sufficiently accurate for extinction curve modelling . applying a silicate - to - graphite abundance ratio of @xmath57 ( @xmath58=3.1 ; weingartner & draine  2001 ) , we derive relative abundances of 62.5  % astronomical silicate , 25  % graphite ( @xmath54 ) , and 12.5  % graphite ( @xmath53 ) .    _",
    "grain size distribution : _ we assume a grain size power - law of the form @xmath59 where @xmath60 represents the particle radius , and @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the minimum and the maximum grain radii , respectively . for @xmath63 nm and @xmath64 nm , this grain size distribution is identical to the widely applied size distribution found for the interstellar medium by mathis et al .",
    "kim et al .  ( 1994 ) showed , that the interstellar grain size distribution has to depart from a simple power law in order to achieve a good fit to the u , b , and v extinction data where the extinction curve changes slope and in the ultraviolet .",
    "as a solution these authors propose an additional parameter for the size distribution to provide an exponential cutoff beyond @xmath62 .",
    "however , in the circumstellar environment of a t  tauri star , such as iras  04302 + 2247 , the grain evolution is expected to depend on the particular considered region : dust grain evolution processes , such as grain growth ( see , e.g. , beckwith et al .",
    "2000 ) , are expected to occur on much shorter timescales in the inner , dense region of the circumstellar disk than in the less dense outer regions or even the circumstellar envelope ( weidenschilling  1997a ) - thus , a radial and vertical dependence of the grain size distribution is expected . furthermore",
    ", dust settling and the resulting increase of the grain  grain interaction probability will result in a further vertical dependence of the grain size distribution ( see , e.g. , weidenschilling  1997b ) . beside the grain evolution , mixing processes , such as convection within the circumstellar disk have to be considered ( see , e.g. , klahr et al .",
    "since the separate processes , and , even more , their mutual influence during the evolution of the circumstellar environment is still rather poorly understood , we assume the simple power - law given in eq .",
    "[ gsdpl ] to be valid both throughout the disk and the circumstellar envelope , but discuss possible corrections if necessary .",
    "we fix the lower grain size ( @xmath63 nm ) , but leave the upper grain size as a free parameter , allowing us to change the dust properties , such as the opacity and scattering behaviour .",
    "based on the dust grain size distribution given in eq .",
    "[ gsdpl ] , the total mass of the circumstellar disk and envelope @xmath65 can be estimated from @xmath66 where we assume a gas - to - dust mass ratio @xmath67 and a grain mass density @xmath68 the quantity @xmath69 is the exponent of the grain size distribution . since both , the gas - to - dust mass ratio and the grain mass density have no impact on the rt , the total mass derived , e.g. , for the circumstellar disk in  [ modmm ] may be corrected accordingly if future observations reveal other values for these quantities .",
    "for example , a more porous , fractal structure of the grains may result in a significantly smaller grain mass density @xmath70 but would also have implications on the light scattering and absorption behaviour of the grains ( see , e.g. , wright  1987 , lumme & rahola  1994 ) .    at this point",
    ", we would like to remind the reader , that only the resulting extinction and scattering behaviour of the dust grain ensemble is of importance for the temperature structure and reemission properties of the disk and the scattering in the circumstellar envelope ( beside the disk geometry and density distribution and the heating sources ) .",
    "since these properties of the grain ensemble are a fairly complex function of the grain size distribution and dust grain chemistry , each of which is based on assumptions , it is not possible to derive a unique solution in the fitting procedure for the observed millimeter and near - infrared images .",
    "however , restricting ourselves to a minimum set of model parameters and choosing reasonable parameters for each of those will allow to derive at least qualitative results , while the particular quantitative result derived from the best fit to the observed data always has to be considered in context of the restrictions of the applied model , i.e. , compact spherical homogeneous grains with a power - law grain size distribution and the discussed silicate / graphite mixture .",
    "the interaction between the radiation field and the dust grains is described by mie theory . in order to do this two problems had to be investigated first : ( 1 ) the radiative transfer in dust grain mixtures and ( 2 ) the numerical description of mie scattering in case of large size parameters .    _",
    "dust grain mixtures : _ for the most accurate solution of the rt problem in a dust grain mixture one had to consider an arbitrary number of separate dust grain sizes within a given interval @xmath71 $ ] and different chemical populations in order to derive the temperature distribution and therefore the contribution to the ( re)emitted radiation of each grain species .",
    "those observables , based on the rt considering each grain species separately are close to the observables resulting from rt simulations based on weighted mean dust grain parameters of the dust grain ensemble ( wolf  2003 ) .",
    "thus , we use weighted mean values for the efficiencies factors , cross sections , the albedo , and scattering matrix elements . for each dust grain ensemble , @xmath72 logarithmically equidistantly distributed grain sizes within the interval @xmath73 $ ] have been taken into account for each chemical component in the averaging process .",
    "_ 2 . large size parameters",
    "x : _ the size parameter @xmath74 is defined as the ratio of the grain radius to the wavelength of the incident electromagnetic radiation @xmath75 @xmath76 ( surrounding medium : vacuum ) . since previously widely applied mie scattering codes , such as the code by bohren & huffman  ( 1983 ) fail for large size parameters ( @xmath77 ) , we calculate the mie scattering function using the numerical solution for the estimation of the mie scattering coefficients published by voshchinnikov  2002 , which achieves accurate results both in the small as well as in the ",
    "arbitrarily   large size parameter regime .",
    "this was necessary since we consider particle sizes up to 10 cm in the following whereby the shortest considered wavelength was 50 nm , resulting in a size parameter of @xmath78 .",
    "an alternative solution would have been the combination of existing mie scattering codes and geometric optic solutions for the small and large size parameter range , respectively .",
    "although we applied the mie scattering function for the description of the scattering behaviour of the dust grain ensemble in the following , we also compared the results of our simulations with those based on the much more simple approach by heyney & greenstein ( 1941 ) , where the scattering parameter @xmath79 was derived from the scattering matrix element @xmath80 @xmath81 and the ( one - parameter ) phase function can be written as @xmath82^{3/2}},\\ ] ] where @xmath83 is the scattering angle .",

    "mc3d_. it is based on the monte - carlo method and solves the continuum rt problem self - consistently , i.e. , it estimates the dust temperature distribution taking into account any heating sources .",
    "it makes use of the temperature correction technique as described by bjorkman & wood  ( 2001 ) , the absorption concept as introduced by lucy  ( 1999 ) , and the enforced scattering scheme as proposed by cashwell & everett  ( 1959 ) .",
    "the radiation field is described by stokes parameters , i.e. , in interaction processes of the radiation with the circumstellar matter ( absorption , scattering ) its polarization state is taken into account .",

    "although the 1.36  mm and 2.74  mm images are simply structured ( see fig .  [ mmcomp ] ) , both images provide three decisive parameters :    1 .   the net flux , 2 .   the peak flux , and 3 .",

    "the midplane of the disk is optically very thick which adds another complexity to the relation between the model parameters and the resulting fluxes , i.e. , the disk - mass to millimeter - reemission relation is far from being linear : the higher optical depth ( with increasing disk mass ) results ( a ) in a less efficient heating of the disk and ( b ) in a higher absorption of the reemitted radiation ( as illustrated in fig .",

    "furthermore , all fluxes have been found to be too small in case of @xmath90 , while their difference between models with @xmath91 and @xmath92 is negligible compared to the uncertainty of the measurements ( see fig .  [ cuts ] - an simultaneous increase of the @xmath45 and @xmath89 results in a slightly more peaked intensity distribution ) .",
    "based on a more narrow parameter range around the values compiled above we found the following disk parameters : @xmath87=300au , @xmath92 ( @xmath112 ) , @xmath94(100au)=15au , and @xmath113 .",
    "the optical depth in the disk midplane as seen from the star amounts to @xmath114(550nm)@xmath115 .",

    "either , the optical depth towards to other ( three ) intensity peaks resulting from light scattering on the inner boundary of the outflow cone is higher than towards the visible one , or the only visible one is not `` real '' but results from a local density enhancement , i.e. , the `` v''-shaped intensity profile far above the midplane is negligibly weak .",

    "however , this result is not satisfying since the simulated 1.36 mm maps in fig .",
    "[ mmcomp ] clearly support a smaller scale height and a higher mass .",
    "therefore , another parameter to be considered is the grain size distribution in the regions being traced by the near - infrared measurements , i.e. , the envelope and the disk surface .",
    "fig .  [ hires ] clearly shows that the millimeter observations trace a region which is slim compared with the width of the dust - lane in the near - infrared wavelength range and is located below the near - infrared scattering surface of the disk .",
    "thus , the assumption of another dust species in the disk surface and envelope does not contradict the 1.36mm/2.74 mm model . applying a grain size distribution as for the interstellar medium , i.e. , a minimum grain size @xmath61=0.05@xmath0 m and a maximum grain size @xmath61=0.25@xmath0 m ( mathis et al .",

    "this mass is by a factor of 10 smaller than that resulting from our millimeter continuum model .",
    "this huge discrepancy strongly supports the hypotheses that two distinct dust grain species are required to fit the millimeter and near - infrared observations simultaneously is verified .",
    "the mass of the envelope alone amounts to about @xmath131 ( see fig.[smallgrain1 ] and [ smallgrain2 ] ) .",
    "another property of the images which can be better reproduced by the small grain size distribution is the overall brightness distribution : in agreement with the observations , the intensity is much more concentrated in the light - scattering centers on the disk surface and inner boundaries of the outflow cones in case of the small grain size distribution .",
    "a further , independent test of the combined envelope plus disk model can be achieved by comparing the resulting sed with observed fluxes over a large wavelength range .",
    "we consider the wavelength interval @xmath132m-3 mm where most of the dust reemission occurs . scattered radiation in the optical to near - infrared wavelength range is not consider here , since the observed images show that large - scale irregular structures determine the appearance and therefore the short - wavelength fluxes of iras  04302 + 2247 .",

    "[ dendisk ] , and ( 2 ) a more efficient heating or a higher initial temperature of the dust in addition to heating by the embedded star .",
    "the first approach would require modifications to already well - established circumstellar disk models , allowing the embedded star to heat the disk midplane much more efficiently than it is possible in the @xmath140 models considered in our investigations .",
    "we found that @xmath45=1.2 - 1.5 would be required which is not met by any of these models .",
    "the second suggestion , however , would need a detailed re - examination of the viscous and other ( also external ) heating processes leading to a higher temperature of the dust close to the very dense regions close to the midplane of the disk . in agreement with the modelling efforts for ,",
    "e.g. , the hh  30 circumstellar disk mentioned above , we considered the stellar and viscous heating as the main heating sources .",
    "but , we also found that the assumption of an initial dust temperature of about 10k in the dense parts of the disk would result in the observed millimeter fluxes ( and the resolved 1.3 mm image ) under the assumption of a smaller ( e.g. , the interstellar ) grain size distribution as well .",
    "interestingly , this is the temperature regime which is assumed to be maintained in the innermost regions of bok globules even under the neglection of external heating sources ( see , e.g. , clemens et al .",
    "the near - infrared scattered light images in the wavelength range between 1.10@xmath0 m and 2.05@xmath0 m have been used to verify the disk and dust parameters found on the basis of the millimeter observations .",
    "it turned out that much smaller grains are required in the upper layer of the disk and the circumstellar envelope in order to achieve an agreement between the obtained disk geometry and the wavelength - dependent width of the dust lane between the scattering lobes .",
    "furthermore , the smaller grains do better reproduce the contrast between the scattering centers and the weaker structures in the observed images .",
    "we conclude that , based on the example of the class  i source iras  04302 + 2247 , we found a first observational hint for different dust evolutionary scenarios in the dense circumstellar disk and the circumstellar envelope of young stellar objects : while dust grain growth results in @xmath141 m sized grains in the disk midplane , the grain size in the circumstellar envelope is much more similar to interstellar medium grains .",
    "we want to point out that further modelling of the presented observations is required in order to verify the quantitative results : instead of a fixed density distribution , the vertical structure of the circumstellar disk should be derived simultaneously with the temperature structure in an iterative procedure , based on the condition of hydrostatic equilibrium . since the accretion",

    "[ abrel ] will have to be given up in order to find out if the theoretically predicted values for @xmath45 and @xmath89 do really provide a unique description of the disk structure of iras  04302 + 2247 .",
    "furthermore , the density and temperature profile at the very inner region of the massive circumstellar disk ( within a radius of @xmath1041au ) has significant influence on the heating of the outer region of the disk through dust reemission , since here the stellar radiation  which is the dominant energy source  is reprocessed .",
    "while the approximation of mean dust grain parameters describing the optical properties of dust grain ensembles holds in the optically thick disk regime , the sublimation radii and dust grain temperature distribution in the inner region , which is directly heated by the star , strongly depend on the particular grain size and chemical composition .",

    "<S> we present a model of the circumstellar environment of the so - called `` butterfly star '' in taurus ( iras  04302 + 2247 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the appearance of this young stellar object is dominated by a large circumstellar disk seen edge - on and the light scattering lobes above the disk . </S>",
    "<S> our model is based on multi - wavelength continuum observations : ( 1 ) millimeter maps , and ( 2 ) high - resolution near - infrared obtained with _ hst_/nicmos . </S>",
    "<S> the advantage of the combination of both observations is that they trace ( a ) different regions of the system and ( b ) different physical processes . on the one hand , </S>",
    "<S> the millimeter - observations are sensitive to the long - wavelength radiation being re - emitted from the dust in the central parts close to the midplane of the circumstellar disk . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the geometry and small - scale density distribution of the disk has been studied . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , in contrast to the pure flux measurement , the resolved 1.3 mm image allows to discriminate between different disk models with a similar far - infrared / millimeter spectral energy distribution and therefore to disentangle the disk geometry much more precisely . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , the near - infrared observations trace the envelope structure and dust properties in the envelope and the disk surface .    </S>",
    "<S> we find disk and envelope parameters which are comparable with those of the circumstellar environment of other young stellar objects . </S>",
    "<S> a main result is that the dust properties must be different in the circumstellar disk and in the envelope : while a grain size distribution with grain radii up to 100@xmath0 m is required to reproduce the millimeter observations of the disk , the envelope is dominated by smaller grains similar to those of the interstellar medium . </S>",
    "<S> alternatives to this grain growth scenario in the circumstellar disk are discussed in brief as well . </S>"
