    "<S> the superconducting state of a two - dimensional @xmath0-@xmath1 model is studied from the spin fluctuation point of view by using a strong coupling theory . </S>",
    "<S> the fluctuation exchange ( flex ) approximatoin is employed to calculate the spin fluctuations and the superconducting gap functions self - consistently in the optimal- and over - doped regions of hole concentration . </S>",
    "<S> the gap function has a symmetry of @xmath2 type and develops below the transition temperature @xmath3 more rapidly than in the bcs model . </S>",
    "<S> its saturation value at the maximum is about @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> when the spin fluctuation - induced superconductivity is well stabilized at low temperatures in the optimal regime , the imaginary part of the antiferromagnetic spin susceptibility shows a very sharp resonance peak reminiscent of the 41 mev peak observed in the neutron scattering experiment on @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the one - particle spectral density around @xmath6 shows sharp quasi - particle peaks followed by dip and hump structures bearing resemblance to the features observed in the angle - resolved photoemission experiment . with increasing doping concentration </S>",
    "<S> these features gradually disappear . </S>"
