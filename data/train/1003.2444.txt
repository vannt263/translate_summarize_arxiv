    "the number of parameters describing a quantum map scale exponentially with @xmath1 , with @xmath2 the dimension of the hilbert space @xmath3 of the system .",

    "this is why the complete characterization of a quantum map is considered to be a _",
    "nonscalable _ task .",
    "the task of characterizing a quantum map is known as quantum process tomography ( qpt ) @xcite and the above is the main reason why full qpt is exponentially expensive . moreover , many existing methods have another major defect as they are inefficient also in extracting partial information about the quantum process ( for a review , see @xcite ) .",
    "recently , however , several works @xcite have demonstrated that it is possible to extract partial but nevertheless relevant information in an efficient way [ where by efficient we mean that it is done at a cost that scales at most polynomially with @xmath1 ) ] .",
    "this has opened a new chapter in quantum information processing toward the scalable characterization of quantum processes .",
    "these new methods share a common feature .",
    "they are based on the idea that the relevant properties of the quantum map can be obtained by averaging properties of a family of maps which are obtained from the original one .",
    "the averaging is done by an operation denoted as twirling @xcite ( which will be defined in detail later ) and involves the application of certain operations before and after the application of the map .",
    "+ in this work we present a review of the recent methods for partial qpt , establishing connections between them and adding results . we not only present a unifying perspective of these methods but also develop a better understanding of the problem at hand  the tomographic characterization itself .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : chi ] we introduce the @xmath0-matrix description of a quantum process distinguishing completely positive ( cp ) maps and others that are not cp . in sec .",
    "[ sec : twirl ] we present the basic ideas behind the notion of a twirling operation .",
    "we show that the elements of the @xmath0-matrix can be obtained from this type of operation .",
    "moreover , some important properties of such a matrix ( in particular , some useful relations between diagonal and off - diagonal elements ) are discussed in secs .",
    "[ subsec : cp ] and [ subsec : p ] .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : fulltwirl ] we review the method of `` selective efficient quantum process tomography , '' originally presented in @xcite .",
    "we reformulate this approach by using more general types of twirlings .",
    "not only do we highlight the power of this method but also we establish the convenience of one type of twirl over another .",
    "furthermore , we provide a clear prescription for its implementation when targeting the scalable measurement of several @xmath0-matrix elements at a time .    in sec .",
    "[ sec:1qubittwirl ] we move to protocols utilizing simpler forms of twirling , which are substantially less demanding regarding their experimental implementation .",
    "we take the results from @xcite and @xcite and present them in a new compact form as a single protocol enabling us to obtain the diagonal elements of the @xmath0-matrix grouped by `` how many '' and `` which '' qubits are affected by the quantum map . by fully proving the method by construction , we aim to further clarify its simple implementation as well as its limitations .    finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : diagonal ] , we discuss the potential of these strategies toward achieving scalable complete tomography of a quantum process .",
    "we believe that the key to this lies in the hierarchization of the exponentially large number of parameters ( in which the results of secs .",
    "[ subsec : cp ] and [ subsec : p ] play an important role ) .",
    "the methods described in secs .",
    "[ sec : fulltwirl ] and [ sec:1qubittwirl ] retrieve the diagonal elements of the @xmath0-matrix , and in sec .",
    "[ sec : diagonal ] we show how the diagonal elements provide information not only about themselves but also about the off - diagonal ones .",
    "this is what we identify as an information hierarchy .    furthermore , we hope that this article sets a practical path for experimentalists looking to implement quantum process characterization in a quantum information setting , that is , when the scalability of the tomographic method matters .",
    "a general quantum process can be described by the action of an arbitrary map @xmath4 on the state @xmath5 in @xmath3 .",
    "any linear map @xmath4 can be expressed as @xmath6 where the operators @xmath7 form a basis for the space of operators @xmath3 . the complex numbers @xmath8 form the so - called @xmath0-matrix of the map .",
    "the @xmath0-matrix is obviously dependent on the operator basis . without loss of generality",
    ", we can take this basis to be orthogonal , that is , to be such that @xmath9}=d \\delta_{l , l'}$ ] @xcite .",
    "it is simple to show that the map preserves the hermiticity of @xmath5 if and only if the @xmath0 matrix is hermitian itself ( i.e. , if @xmath10 ) . moreover , the map @xmath4 is trace - preserving if and only if the condition @xmath11 is satisfied . in such a case",
    "it is simple to count the number of independent real parameters defining the quantum map , which turns out to be @xmath12 ( with the trace preserving condition implying a reduction of the number of parameters in @xmath13 and also implies that the condition @xmath14 must be satisfied ) .",
    "we remark that this description is valid for any linear map . for the case of hermitian maps it is possible to uncover further structure .",
    "in such a case the @xmath0-matrix can be diagonalized by a unitary transformation . in matrix notation",
    "we can write @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is a diagonal matrix with real eigenvalues .",
    "the columns of the unitary matrix @xmath17 define the eigenvectors : the @xmath18-th component of the @xmath19-th eigenvector @xmath20 is @xmath21 . by using this notation",
    "it is evident that the elements of the @xmath0 matrix can be obtained as @xmath22 .",
    "+ some simple but useful results follow from this expression . replacing it in the original formula for the map given in eq .",
    "( [ chimatrixe ] ) we obtain the following alternative expression for an arbitrary linear hermitian map : @xmath23 where the operators @xmath24 form an orthonormal basis defined as @xmath25 .",
    "( the orthonormality of @xmath24 follows from the fact that these operators are a linear combination of the original @xmath26 with coefficients that are elements of a unitary matrix . ) it is worth noticing that the coefficients @xmath27 , which are the eigenvalues of the @xmath0-matrix , are necessarily real but can be either positive or negative .",
    "this representation for the quantum map is closely related to the so - called kraus representation ( which is obtained only if the eigenvalues @xmath28 are all positive , which is in turn valid for the case of cp maps only , as discussed below ) .",
    "in fact , eq . ( [ kraus ] ) is a generalization of the kraus representation valid for any linear hermitian map .    more generally , the above expressions make evident that an arbitrary linear hermitian map can always be written as the difference between two cp maps @xcite ( this is the case since any matrix @xmath16 can be expressed as the difference between two positive matrices ) . +      using the above results",
    ", we can derive some properties for the @xmath0-matrix of completely positive maps ( i.e. , when the map @xmath4 and any trivial extension of it to a bigger hilbert space preserve positivity ) . since the matrix @xmath16 is positive , it is clear that matrix elements @xmath0 are obtained as the inner product between two eigenvectors @xmath20 defined through the positive matrix @xmath16 , @xmath29 from this observation we can conclude the following : first , it is evident that diagonal elements must be positive ( i.e. , @xmath30 ) .",
    "moreover , as the inner product satisfies the cauchy - schwarz inequality , we can obtain the following relation between diagonal and off - diagonal elements of the @xmath0-matrix : @xmath31 _ this means that , for any cp map , the diagonal elements of the @xmath0-matrix are always nonnegative , and that they bound the corresponding off - diagonal elements .",
    "_ these two simple results are quite significant and they will prove very useful later on .",
    "below , we will derive another relation between diagonal and off - diagonal coefficients for the @xmath0-matrix valid for positive ( not necessarily cp ) maps . in this way we will be also able to establish some conditions to distinguish these two important classes of maps .",

    "therefore , @xmath51 , which implies @xmath52 .",
    "+ moreover , again using the cauchy - schwarz inequality on this inner product , we obtain that for @xmath53 @xmath54 so for large systems where we can consider @xmath55 , the off - diagonal matrix elements are effectively bound by the diagonal ones .",
    "these bounds also suggest that non - cp but positive processes are `` exponentially close '' to cp ones .",
    "this is an interesting result in the framework of open quantum systems , where there are still important discussions about what mathematical conditions a physical map should fulfill @xcite",
    ".      equation ( [ main_ariel ] ) already demonstrates the usefulness of twirls in extracting the elements of the @xmath0-matrix .",

    "an example of such a scenario was explicitly shown in the experimental work in @xcite , using a liquid - state nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) processor with four qubits .",

    "for this we will use that the clifford operators can in turn be decomposed into pauli operators ( the normalizer of the clifford group ) and the so - called symplectic operators ( the resulting quotient group ) . + we will follow the notation of @xcite . each index @xmath19 carries the following information : @xmath167 , @xmath168 , @xmath169 .",

    "there are of course @xmath225 of these vectors describing the @xmath75 .    if we use eq .",
    "( [ eq_pwandwhich ] ) and start with the probability of having all the qubits flipped in the outcome , and go backward toward the survival probability ( i.e. , none of the qubits flipped ) , we find    [ probschi ] @xmath226    so essentially we could determine @xmath227 using ( [ chie1 ] ) , then insert it in ( [ chie2 ] ) and obtain the @xmath65 possible @xmath228 from the different @xmath229 , and then insert that in ( [ chie3 ] ) , and so on and so forth .",
    "these equations define a triangular matrix that relates the probabilities @xmath230 to the collective coefficients @xmath231 .",
    "notice there is no need to perform different experiments to obtain the different probabilities : we only need to implement @xmath56 realizations of the twirl and keep the outcome of the measurement for each of the realizations .",
    "this outcome should be a @xmath65-bit string indicating whether each @xmath72-th qubit was found in @xmath232 or @xmath233 .",
    "+ the problem arises not in obtaining the experimental information , but in its posterior processing . the matrix given by eqs .",
    "( [ probschi ] ) is of size @xmath234 , therefore the cost of the processing would scale exponentially in @xmath65 . for this strategy to work , it is key to relate it hierarchically to the determination of the @xmath202 : the experimental information required is the same and can be obtained efficiently by sampling .",
    "the idea goes as follows . if we are analyzing a map @xmath4 that is close to the identity ( a noise channel ) or a quantum gate involving a few qubits ( typically one or two )",
    ", then we would expect that above a certain cut - off pauli weight @xmath235 , the @xmath202 will be null . this is a reasonable expectation : since @xmath236 ( the trace - preserving condition ) , the @xmath202 can not all be arbitrarily large , and thus it will be possible to bound the coefficients above the cut - off by a negligible amount . in this scenario , the matrix relating the @xmath230 with the @xmath231 will have a size @xmath237 , @xmath238 , which scales polynomially in @xmath65 @xcite .",
    "there is a second caveat though . as explained in @xcite respectively , the errors in determining the @xmath202 or the @xmath187 scale inefficiently with @xmath167 , a consequence of the matrices relating them with the corresponding probabilities ( eqs .",
    "( [ eq_pw ] ) and ( [ probschi ] ) respectively ) .",
    "although the measured probabilities will have a standard deviation @xmath134 , this error will propagate into the @xmath202 or the @xmath187 with a factor that grows polynomially with @xmath65 but exponentially with @xmath167 .",
    "again , we must resort to neglecting the @xmath202 after a certain cut - off",
    ". the system can be arbitrary large ( arbitrary @xmath65 ) , and as long as the @xmath202 are negligible above a certain @xmath235 ( with @xmath235 independent of or scaling efficiently with @xmath65 ) we will be able to obtain all the non - negligible @xmath239 efficiently .",
    "+ notice that , in the previous section , the requirement that only a few ( @xmath240 ) coefficients @xmath241 are non - negligible is not a priori .",
    "we can indeed run the protocol , efficiently , and arrive at this conclusion .",
    "however , the one - qubit twirling method poses a stronger condition , since the values of the @xmath242 must respond to a hierarchy associated to their pauli weights .",
    "only then we can establish the pauli weight cut - off and run the protocol [ in particular , solve the system of equations ( [ probschi ] ) ] .    with the twirl in u(@xmath2 )",
    "we obtain the coefficients directly with a standard deviation @xmath134 , while with the twirl in u(@xmath164)@xmath165 we only obtain probabilities @xmath203 with standard deviations @xmath243 , which still need to be propagated in order to obtain the estimated error for the @xmath187 .    with the protocol of sec .",
    "[ sec : fulltwirl ] @xcite , the measurement of the largest @xmath88 can be done then more precisely , with no coarse - graining and with no restrictions on the map under study . clearly , the protocol of this section @xcite is quite less demanding , requiring the implementation of only @xmath244 one - qubit gates instead of @xmath84 one - qubit and cnot gates .",
    "however , this advantage is counterbalanced : we have a more restricted and less precise tomographic method . in practice , nevertheless , the choice between the two will be given by the extent to which we can control our system experimentally .",
    "finally , we must notice that in both approaches , the methods are universal in the sense that they do not require any prior knowledge on the specific dynamics of @xmath4 .",
    "the protocol twirling in full space is valid for any linear hermitian map , while the one with one - qubit twirling only has the extra requirement of having a structure with a cut - off pauli weight . for an example of a characterization incorporating substantial prior knowledge of the dynamics or specific models for @xmath4 ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "if we diagonalize the @xmath0-matrix , we will obtain the weights of an operator - sum representation , where the operators in the sum are the corresponding basis where the @xmath0-matrix is diagonal .",
    "of course , this basis will not necessarily be the pauli operator basis , but in principle a combination of them . using the notation of sec .",
    "[ sec : chi ] , take @xmath245 to be the diagonalization of the @xmath0-matrix written in the pauli operator basis .",
    "let @xmath246 be the change of basis , so @xmath247 where the @xmath248 form an orthonormal basis , but just as in an operator - sum representation , they are not necessarily unitary ( otherwise any process would be unital ) nor hermitian . and , as we already mentioned , the @xmath249 are real but could be negative in principle .",
    "thus in general neither the @xmath88 nor even the @xmath249 have a simple interpretation .",
    "+ nevertheless , despite the different ways of describing the process under study @xmath4 in @xcite , in all the cases they determine specifically the diagonal elements of the @xmath0-matrix of the map in the generalized pauli operator basis .",
    "notice that either the one - qubit twirl or the full - space twirl implies a pauli twirl ( since the pauli operators are a subgroup of the clifford group in both cases ) , and that the pauli twirl erases the information of the off - diagonal elements of the @xmath0-matrix .",
    "we ask then , what is the meaning of the diagonal ?",
    "it was assumed in @xcite that the @xmath202 represented the probability of an operator of pauli weight @xmath167 happening in the process described by @xmath4 . in @xcite ,",
    "the @xmath187 were regarded as indicators of the locality or range of the process , that is , the probability of an operator involving the qubits in @xmath168 happening .",
    "these are both quantities that are relevant to quantum error correction and fault - tolerant quantum computing .",
    "+ both these interpretations are fair when the @xmath0-matrix in the pauli operator basis is approximately diagonal , at least block - diagonal in blocks characterized by @xmath167 , @xmath168 .",
    "but that is not generally the case , in particular for maps that will be of our interest  such as quantum computing gates . for example , the cnot gate for qubits @xmath250 and @xmath251 has a @xmath0-matrix with only a @xmath252 nonzero block , @xmath253 corresponding to @xmath254 .",
    "clearly , the off - diagonal coefficients carry critical information with equal weight , which for example differentiates the cnot from a depolarizing channel with the same @xmath75 .",
    "thus previous interpretations of @xmath202 and @xmath187 are arguable : we could even have in principle a process involving a set of qubits given by @xmath167 , @xmath168 that has @xmath255 in that block but @xmath256 in the diagonal . however , as demonstrated in secs .",
    "[ subsec : cp ] and [ subsec : p ] , it is possible to draw a relation between the diagonal and off - diagonal elements of the @xmath0-matrix .    for cp maps , eq .",
    "( [ boundcp ] ) guarantees that if either @xmath257 or @xmath258 , the off - diagonal @xmath259 is null . and for positive maps in general , eq .",
    "( [ boundp ] ) gives us a bound that is exponentially close to this result .",
    "this a very powerful result , since once we have established the nonzero diagonal elements , in order to perform a full characterization we only need to worry about the off - diagonal elements that correspond to that resulting block .",
    "this hierarchization of the information could potentially allow for a complete quantum tomography of the process at a scalable cost  provided that the number of non - null matrix elements turns out to be @xmath260 .",
    "it is in order here to point out though that the work in @xcite also presents a strategy to measure the off - diagonal elements of the @xmath0-matrix .",
    "however , an ancillary qubit which is not twirled is required for this task .",
    "the ancilla is assumed to be error - free and outside the system we are looking to characterize .",
    "this does not imply an issue when it comes to scalability , since only one qubit ancilla is required for arbitrary @xmath2 .",
    "nonetheless , it puts this method in a different category regarding resources and assumptions when it comes to its implementation .",
    "by revisiting previous work @xcite we have stated two scalable approaches for characterizing the diagonal elements of the @xmath0-matrix in the pauli operator basis , for any arbitrary quantum process .",
    "we emphasize once more that the work in secs .",
    "[ sec : fulltwirl ] and [ sec:1qubittwirl ] arises from the revision of these previous results and goes beyond , which we would like to summarize here : the general approach discussed in sec . [ sec : fulltwirl ] restates the method originally presented in @xcite , further clarifying its ability to measure the largest diagonal elements of the @xmath0-matrix together .",
    "we study this protocol by recognizing its familiarity with other twirling methods and present a natural alternative approach which , we conclude , is slightly less convenient if we work with only a few qubits . on the other hand ,",
    "the approach discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec:1qubittwirl ] combines the two protocols originally presented in @xcite and @xcite , by building and again proving both protocols , but simultaneously .",

    "we have made the point that there are different ways of twirling that reproduce eqs .",
    "( [ haaru ] ) and ( [ haarstate ] ) .",
    "moreover , we have shown that a deeper analysis may lead to advantages of one form of twirl over another , in particular for working with a small number of qubits .",

    "[ sec : fulltwirl ] when comparing the clifford twirl and the mub twirl in u(@xmath2 ) .",

    "+ on the other hand , in the light of eqs .",
    "( [ boundcp ] ) and ( [ boundp ] ) , our work establishes the relevance of the diagonal coefficients .",
    "we believe that this type of hierarchization of the information is key to achieve complete tomography in a scalable way .",

    "[ sec:1qubittwirl ] [ eqs .",

    ", the bounding of the off - diagonal elements by the diagonals also gives us a form of grouping .",
    "when a diagonal element is null , we can conclude that all the elements corresponding to that row and column are also null .",
