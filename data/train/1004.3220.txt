    "lets @xmath264 denote the number of restricted ascents sequences of length @xmath3 .",
    "the catalan numbers @xmath265 can be defined by the recursion @xmath266 with the initial condition that @xmath267 .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath268 since the empty sequence is a restricted ascent sequences .",
    "we must show that @xmath269 thus we need a procedure to take a restricted ascent sequence @xmath270 of length @xmath6 and a restricted ascent sequence @xmath271 of length @xmath272 and produce a restricted ascent sequence @xmath273 of lenght @xmath260 .",
    "we shall describe a procedure `` gluing '' two ascent sequences , @xmath270 and @xmath271 which is equivalent to gluing two dyck paths together . to define our gluing procedure",
    "we first need the concept of the `` rightmost maximum '' in an ascent sequence , defined as a left - to - right maximum @xmath15 such that @xmath15 is one more than the number of ascents to the left of @xmath15 , and none of the left - to - right maxima to the right of @xmath15 has this property ( in other words , this is the last time we use the maximum option in the interval @xmath274 $ ] among the left - to - right maxima ) .",
    "the sequence @xmath275 is the only one that does not have the rightmost maximum .",
    "for example , 0010101003 has the rightmost maximum ( the leftmost ) 1 , whereas 0010103323234 has the rightmost maximum ( the leftmost ) 3 . then procedure of `` gluing '' two ascent sequences , @xmath270 and @xmath271 together can be described as follows .    1 .   for @xmath276 ,",
    "define @xmath277++@xmath278 where `` + + '' means increasing _ each _ element of @xmath271 by the number @xmath279 .",
    "for example , if @xmath280 and @xmath281 , then @xmath282 .",
    "2 .   for @xmath283 define @xmath284 with the rightmost maximum element duplicated ( add extra 0 if @xmath285 ) .",
    "for example , @xmath286 .",
    "it is easy to see that in case 1 , the element @xmath287 is the the rightmost maximum element of @xmath288++@xmath278 which is either the rightmost element if @xmath289 or is followed by @xmath279 if @xmath290 since @xmath271 must start with 0 in that case .",
    "it follows that the rightmost maximal element is not duplicated in @xmath291 in case 1 and , hence , it is easy to recover @xmath270 and @xmath271 from @xmath292",
    ". clearly , in case 2 , the rightmost maximal element of @xmath293 is dulplicated so that we can distinguish case 1 from case 2 .",
    "moreover , it is easy to see that we can recover @xmath271 from @xmath292 in case 2 .",
    "this proves that ( [ rrec ] ) holds and hence @xmath294 for all  @xmath3 .",
    "recall that posets avoiding @xmath10  are those that do not contain , as an induced subposet , a 3-element chain together with another element which is incomparable to all elements in the 3-element chain . as we mentioned in the introduction , the number of posets avoiding @xmath0and @xmath10  is given by the catalan numbers ( see  @xcite ) . using the bijection  @xcite applied to small restricted ascent sequences , one would be tempted to conjecture that restricted ascent sequences are bijectively mapped to @xmath0- and @xmath10-free posets as both of the objects are counted by the catalan numbers .",
    "indeed , this is true for posets of size less than or equal to six .",
    "moreover , we can show that the first time one violates that restricted ascent sequence condition , then the corresponding @xmath0-free poset contains an induced copy of @xmath10 .",
    "that is , suppose that @xmath258 is a restricted ascent sequence , @xmath298 , and @xmath299 .",
    "then we claim that the poset corresponding to @xmath300 , must contain an induced copy of @xmath10 .",
    "that is , let @xmath157 be the element on level @xmath15 that corresponds to @xmath15 under the bijection of section  [ decomp ] .",
    "now in @xmath300 , @xmath15 is preceded by a larger element , and thus @xmath157 has a neighbor , say @xmath301 , on its level , level @xmath15 .",
    "because the first time we encounter @xmath62 in @xmath93 , its corresponding element @xmath47 in the poset covers all maximal elements , it follows that there must be at least one non - maximal element , say @xmath41 , on level @xmath64 .",
    "next , since @xmath299 , there exists an element @xmath58 in the poset such that @xmath302 and @xmath303 .",
    "that is , @xmath304 is on a higher level than @xmath220 and the down - sets are linearly ordered by inclusion according to their levels . since @xmath157 copies relations of @xmath301 , @xmath305 . since @xmath157 is a maximal element , also @xmath306 and @xmath307 .",
    "finally , @xmath41 is a non - maximal element , thus there exists @xmath308 .",
    "finally @xmath309 since @xmath157 is maximal so that the four elements @xmath310 and @xmath157 form a @xmath10  configuration .",
    "if it was the case that our addition operations preserved the property of containing @xmath10  configuration , then it would be the case that the bijection in section  [ decomp ] would send @xmath0- and @xmath10-free posets to restricted ascent sequences .",
    "however , this is is not the case .",
    "for example , consider the poset on the left in figure  [ fig1 ] which corresponds to @xmath0-free poset corresponding to the ascent sequence 0101202 .",
    "one can check that there is an induced @xmath10  in the poset corresponding to the non - restricted ascent sequence 010120 , but clearly there is no induced @xmath10  in the @xmath0-free poset corresponding to the ascent sequence 0101202 .",
    "this means that there must be a restricted ascent sequence of length seven whose corresponding @xmath0-free poset does contain an induced copy of @xmath10 .",
    "such a sequence and its corresponding @xmath0-free poset is shown on the right in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "we leave it as open problem to characterize @xmath0-free posets corresponding to restricted ascent sequences under the bijection in  @xcite and to characterize ascent sequences corresponding to @xmath0- and @xmath10-free posets under the same bijection ."
