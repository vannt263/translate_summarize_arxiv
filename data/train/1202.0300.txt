    "the remarkable discovery of extrasolar planets orbiting sun - like stars in 1995 was accomplished by utilizing novel techniques that improved the radial velocity ( rv ) precision by two orders of magnitude ( from @xmath151 km / s to 10 m / s ) , which was at last sufficient to search for the slight gravitational wobble induced by an orbiting gas giant planet upon its host star ( walker et al .",

    "1997 ; but cf .",
    "latham et al . 1989 ) . since then an extensive international effort has begun to determine the ubiquity and basic properties of these initially elusive objects . based on a modest extrapolation of current findings , we now know that roughly 12% of sun - like stars ( f , g , and k spectral type ) harbor gas giant planets within 30 au ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ;",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . while the masses of these planets are similar to the gas giants in our solar system ( i.e. jupiter and saturn ) , their orbital properties are in many ways radically different .",
    "some orbit their host star in just a few days time ( the `` hot jupiters '' ) , while others have highly eccentric orbits .",
    "planet - like companions have even been directly imaged at separations of more than 100 au from their host star @xcite .",
    "the dramatically different properties of extrasolar planets compared to those in our solar system forced theorists to reconsider the standard paradigm for gas giant planet formation .",
    "now , planet formation scenarios generally fall into 2 categories , core accretion @xcite and disk instabilities @xcite .",
    "core accretion is the favored mechanism for producing giant planets with large core masses ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) and can naturally explain the enhanced frequency of planets around metal rich stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    ". however , at wide separations ( @xmath16 10 au ) the timescale for planet formation via core accretion @xcite is longer than the typical disk dissipation timescale ( @xmath17 10 myr ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; it is thus an unlikely formation mechanism for the planets in very wide orbits about fomalhaut and hr 8799 @xcite .",
    "disk instabilities , on the other hand , can form planets much more quickly ( @xmath17 1 myr ) , well before circumstellar disks are dispersed ( * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * but cf .",
    "stamatellos & whitworth 2008 ; meru & bate 2011 ) .",
    "this mechanism also works nearly as efficiently around low mass stars , with sufficiently massive disks , and seems a more plausible scenario for forming the known massive planets orbiting m dwarfs @xcite . of course , it is possible that both scenarios operate or dominate within different regimes of stellar and/or disk mass .",
    "in addition to the uncertainties surrounding planet formation , it is also unclear how the orbits of newly formed planets dynamically evolve . since giant planets are believed to form beyond the snowline ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , inward orbital migration must occur in many systems to explain the wealth of short period planets ; roughly 10% of gas giant planets have separations less than 0.1 au @xcite .",
    "interactions with disk material is widely believed to be the most efficient mechanism for inward migration ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "if most gas giants migrate via this process , the hot jupiters must become hot within @xmath18 myr after formation , prior to disk dissipation .",
    "however , planet - disk interactions typically circularize orbits and maintain spin - orbit alignment with the star , so other processes such as dynamical scattering with other planets @xcite or a nearby star @xcite may be needed to produce the broad extrasolar planet eccentricity distribution and the spin - orbit misaglignments of many transiting planets ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "these dynamical interactions could take many hundreds of millions of years ( e.g. see review by * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "one direct way to begin constraining the mechanisms and timescales of planet formation and migration is to search for planets around stars with ages of @xmath19 myr , or essentially immediately after planets could have formed .",
    "direct imaging searches for planets have been more successful at this recently than rv searches .",
    "several massive jupiter - like companions have been directly imaged around stars with these ages , though at somewhat wide separations ( 10 to many 100s of au ; e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; these important discoveries are helping to motivate future high - contrast imaging facilities and the science achievable with them ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in many cases , however , planetary status relies upon comparisons with poorly tested evolutionary models , and the wide separations offer little constraint on the migration mechanism responsible for forming hot jupiter - like planets .",
    "planets identified via rv variations , on the other hand , yield immediate mass lower limits ( @xmath20sin@xmath8 ) and preferentially find massive short - period planets which most likely have migrated .",
    "however , two universal properties of young stars inhibit measuring their rv precisely at optical wavelengths , and consequently they are often excluded in high precision rv surveys for planets .",
    "the first of these is that young sun - like stars are much cooler while young , and thus fainter at optical wavelengths .",
    "a 1 solar mass star , for example , has a spectral type of @xmath15 k5 at 10 myr @xcite .",
    "this , coupled with the fact that all star forming regions are further away than 100 pc means that most young stars are simply too faint for high - precision rv work at optical wavelengths .",
    "the second of these is that young stars are often modestly to rapidly rotating .",
    "this rotation broadens stellar absorption features and , even more perniciously , generates chromospheric activity and a spotted stellar surface .",
    "several pioneering rv studies of young spotted stars have shown that their presence can induce low amplitude , periodic rv shifts , and thus mimic the effect of one or more orbiting planets @xcite ; amplitudes of 200 - 700 m / s have been observed . in a couple cases , jupiter - like companions",
    "have been reported orbiting young stars based on low - amplitude ( @xmath21 km / s ) rv variations @xcite , but subsequent observations indicate that these too were misidentifications caused by star spots @xcite",
    ".    one promising way to overcome these observational challenges is to observe at infrared wavelengths .",
    "as has been demonstrated , modern infrared spectrographs utilizing molecular gas cells are able to obtain rv precisions comparable to very stable optical facilities ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this wavelength range is advantageous for young stars on cool convective tracks since it is much closer to the peak of their energy distribution , thereby improving observing efficiency .",
    "more significantly , at these wavelengths the contrast between the photosphere and cool star spots is reduced ; this is confirmed by the decline in the photometric variability of spotted stars with wavelength ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . since the rv `` noise '' induced by star spots is directly proportional to the amplitude of a star s photometric variability @xcite , the diminished variability at longer wavelength observations should help mitigate the noise of star spots",
    ". observations of young spotted stars at both optical and infrared wavelenghts appear to confirm this prediction @xcite .",
    "motivated by the prospects for obtaining high - precision rv measurements of young stars at infrared wavelengths , in late 2004 we began an ambitious observational program at the w. m. keck observatory ( pi : r. white ) to search for young planets .",
    "here we present initial results . in section 2",
    "we describe the sample selection and in section 3 we summarize the acquisition of infrared spectra . in sections 4 and 5",
    "we describe our method for optimally extracting the spectra and for modeling the spectra to determine precise rvs .",
    "the results of this survey , which include the discovery of two spectroscopic binaries and one candidate hot jupiter , are highlighted in section 6 . in section 7",
    "we determine detection limits for the ensemble sample via monte carlo simulations and quantify the advantage infrared rvs measurements have over optical measurements for young stars .",
    "our overall findings are summarized in section 8 .",
    "although our entire young star survey includes stars from both star forming regions and nearby loose associations , in this first paper we focus only on young stars in the @xmath1 pic and tw hydrae associations , which have ages of @xmath2 myr and @xmath3 myr , respectively @xcite .",
    "the high quality spectra of these nearby , systematically brighter stars were our initial focus as we developed techniques for precise rv measurements .",
    "the selection criteria for targets within these associations were that the star have no known companions within 20 , be somewhat slowly rotating ( @xmath7sin@xmath8 @xmath17 15 km / s , if known ) , show no signs of accretion ( e.g. tw hya itself was excluded ) , and have an m spectral type .",
    "the spectral type criterion was adopted to ensure that that stars have strong @xmath22co r - branch lines in their spectra , from which rvs are measured .",
    "stars were selected from the membership lists assembled in @xcite ; 9 stars from the @xmath1 pic association and 9 stars from the tw hydrae association met these criteria .",
    "wide companions to 2 of these stars have spectral types just slightly earlier than m , ag tri a ( k6 ) and twa 9a ( k5 ) , and were therefore also included since their acquisition overhead would be minimal .",
    "spectroscopic observations of a few of these stars ( gj 871.1 b , twa 12 , twa 23 ) revealed that they were more rapidly rotating than our initial selection criterion .",
    "we nevertheless continued to observe these stars in order to investigate empirically how the precision degrades with projected rotational velocity .",
    "after our observational program began , one of our targets , gj3305 , was discovered to be a 0093 binary @xcite , making it a triple star system @xcite .",
    "it was consequently observed less often as it was considered a less likely planet host .",
    "we also note that of the 20 young stars in this sample , 14 of them ( 70% ) are members of wide binary star systems , with separations ranging from 29 to 1967 au .",
    "these include ag tri a and b , gj 799 a and b , gj 871.1 a and b , gj3305 , twa 8a and 8b , twa 9a and 9b , twa 11b , twa 13a and 13b .",

    "gj 873 is the second brightest m dwarf x - ray source in the _ rntgensatellit _ all - sky survey @xcite , has one of the strongest surface magnetic field strengths measured on an m dwarf @xcite , and a differential star spot covering factor of 4 - 11% @xcite .",
    "while its activity suggests a young age , its dwarf - like gravity and the absence of lithium in its atmosphere @xcite indicate it is not pre - main sequence .",
    "it s usually classified as a young disk star ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with an approximate age of @xmath26 yr .",
    "the motivation for including this star was to assess the achievable rv precision at infrared wavelengths in the limit of extreme surface activity .    for calibration purposes we observed a handful of a spectral type stars during each observing run .",
    "the telluric absorption features superimposed upon these nearly featureless stellar spectra , at infrared wavelengths , are used to characterize the instrumental profile .",
    "in addition , we observed 3 mid - m dwarf stars ( gj 628 , gj725a and gj725b ) that have been previously monitored with high precision optical rv techniques and shown to have no detectable rv companions @xcite ; @xcite measure rv dispersions of 7.4 m / s and 7.1 m / s for gj 725a and gj 725 b , respectively .",
    "these stars were included to assess the achievable rv precision in the limit of slowly rotating , inactive stars .",
    "stellar masses for the young stars are estimated by comparing their stellar temperatures to a theoretical isochrone . to do this we assembled stellar spectral types from original references ( see table [ table1 ] ) and assigned temperatures using the t tauri - like temperature scale of @xcite for stars cooler than m0 , and the dwarf temperature scale of @xcite for hotter stars .",
    "these temperatures are then compared to the 10 myr isochrone of @xcite with a mixing length of 1.9 above 0.6 m@xmath27 and a mixing length of 1.0 at lower masses ; this evolutionary model with the adopted temperature scale is consistent with the available dynamical mass constraints for young stars @xcite .",
    "this yields stellar masses that range from 0.12 m@xmath27 to 1.01 m@xmath27 , with a median mass of 0.6 m@xmath27 .",
    "approximate masses for the field dwarfs are estimated from the absolute magnitude - mass relations of @xcite , where the absolute magnitudes have been assigned based on spectral type relations given in @xcite .",
    "table [ table1 ] summarizes the basic properties of the sample observed , excluding the a spectral type stars .",
    "the listed properties include spectral types , @xmath28 magnitudes , mass estimates , rotational periods , if known , previously reported @xmath7sin@xmath8 values , if available , and the corresponding references .",
    "the @xmath28 magnitudes for the field stars are taken from @xcite whereas the values for association members are from the 2mass survey , and thus are @xmath29 magnitudes .",
    "since the 2mass survey reports only a combined magnitude for gj799ab , a 28 pair , we estimate each component s magnitude by assuming they are equally bright ; the components of this binary have the same spectral type .",
    "spectroscopic observations of the sample stars were obtained using the cross - dispersed infrared echelle spectrograph nirspec @xcite on the w. m. keck ii telescope .",
    "the observations were obtained over 12 observing runs in total , spanning from 2004 nov 16 to 2009 may 12 .",
    "the large number of runs was a consequence of this program being completed in concert with a similar program focused on l dwarfs @xcite .",
    "all observations were obtained with the 3 pixel ( 0432 ) slit in combination with the n7 blocking filter , and approximate echelle angle 62.65 and grating angle 35.50 .",
    "this yielded 7 orders of spectra spanning approximately 1.99 @xmath5 m to 2.39 @xmath5 m , with gaps between the orders , at a resolving power of approximately 30,000 ( measured as described below ) .",
    "the spectra were obtained in pairs at two locations along the slit .",
    "collecting observations in this manner provided a nearly simultaneous measurement of sky emission and detector bias for both images .",
    "since the measurement goal of this program was precise rvs , considerable effort was put into maintaining instrument stability by not moving any internal components of nirspec while observing . however , when the nirspec software is first started ( at the beginning of a night ) or when a software crash occurs , the motors for the filter wheels and reflection angles must all be reinitialized , forcing the internal components to move .",
    "since resetting the reflection angles typically results in a slightly different setting , these values were tweaked slightly , by eye , to return to the primary wavelength setting ; this procedure resulted in the same wavelength coverage to within a few pixels . since the spectroscopic properties of this new setting would be slightly different , we strived to characterize each observational set by intensively observing one of the a spectral type stars for each nirspec setting .",
    "we were successful in this effort for all but one observational set.",
    "for each observational set , described above , dark images were median combined and this median was subtracted from each flat - field image .",
    "these subtracted flat - field images were then normalized by counts in the central @xmath30 of the array , and then median combined to generate a master flat .",
    "regions outside the illuminated 7 orders were set to unity .",
    "the orders were not normalized in the direction of dispersion , a necessary step to strictly preserve the counts and the correct relative signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) ; skipping this led to fringing effects that were more consistent , smaller in amplitude , and easier to remove ( see below ) .",
    "all spectrum images were then divided by the master flat constructed for its observational set , and then each flattened image had its corresponding nod image subtracted from it to remove the sky emission , detector bias and dark current .",
    "this yielded 2 reduced spectrum images for each epoch .    prior to spectral",
    "extraction , the 7 spectral orders were located on the reduced spectrum image automatically by finding maxima in smoothed spatial profiles of each order ( i.e. perpendicular to the dispersion direction ) .",
    "gaussian functions were then fit to these spatial profiles in binned segments of 10-columns along the orders .",
    "the orders were then traced by fitting a low order polynomial to the peak position of these gaussians , with 3@xmath31 outliers excluded from the fit .",
    "next , regions that were more than 3 sigma above or below the best fit polynomial defining the center of each order were masked and excluded from any further analysis . masking the orders in this way",
    "objectively accounted for variations in the spatial width of the spectra , usually caused by variations in the seeing , and proved vital for successful extraction of pair subtracted spectra only 100 apart .",
    "spectra were extracted from the masked images using a modified version of the optimal extraction procedure described in @xcite . unlike standard extraction techniques which simply sum pixel values over a specified range , optimal extraction sums pixels weighted by the variance of an assumed smoothly varying spatial profile that can be defined either perpendicular to or parallel to the dispersion direction .",
    "this minimizes the noisy contributions of profile wings and allows significant deviates from the profile ( e.g. hot pixels and cosmic rays ) to be easily identified and removed ( see piskunov & valenti 2002 for this and other issues related to the optimal extraction of cross - dispersed echelle spectra ) .",
    "after considerable experimentation , we adopted spatial profiles defined parallel to the dispersion direction and used a gaussian plus second order polynomial to model these .",
    "the variance of the profile was determined from each pair subtracted flat - fielded spectrum image .",
    "we note that this is slightly different from the recommendation of @xcite to use a bias subtracted flat - fielded spectrum image ; as with most infrared observations , the bias is only removed as a part of pair subtraction .",
    "the addition of these bias counts produced slightly larger variance estimates , but this yielded no noticeable effect on our relatively high snr spectra .",
    "future studies may consider obtaining bias images throughout the night in an attempt to determine a more accurate variance image .",
    "an example of an optimally extracted spectrum is shown in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "one feature not accounted for in these extractions is interference fringing .",
    "although some investigators have developed prescriptions to remove this via fourier filtering @xcite , we accounted for this feature in the spectral modeling process .",
    "precise rvs were extracted from the observations by constructing a detailed model of each spectrum .",
    "although a wide variety of modeling prescriptions were investigated with our data to optimize this , the prescription described here is the one that yielded the most consistent rvs for 15 + epochs of 3 slowly rotating m dwarfs with no known planets ( gj 628 , gj725a and gj725b ) .",
    "the modeled spectra were constructed from an ultra - high resolution kpno / fts telluric spectrum , extracted from observations of the sun @xcite , and synthetically generated stellar spectra , computed from updated and improved nextgen models @xcite , constructed and provided by coauthor t. barman .",
    "although the @xmath32 bandhead and r branch lines are temperature and surface gravity dependent , we did not determine these parameters from our spectra ; attempts to do this yielded results that were only marginally consistent with previous values considered to be more accurate ( e.g. from optical spectra ) .",
    "instead , we used a synthetically generated spectrum that most closely matched each star s spectral type and expected surface gravity .",
    "all field stars ( gj 628 , gj725a , gj725b , gj 873 ) were assumed to have a log(g ) = 4.8 dex , while the young stars were assumed to have a log(g ) = 4.2 dex , consistent with recent log(g ) measurements @xcite .",
    "the stellar properties of the spectral templates used for each star are listed in table [ table2 ] .",
    "each observation was modeled by combining a telluric and a synthetic spectrum , parametrized by 10 free parameters .",
    "four parameters determine instrumental properties - the wavelength solution was parametrized by a quadratic polynomial , characteristic of slightly curved spectral orders , and the instrumental spectral profile was modeled as a single best - fit gaussian for the entire order .",
    "the remaining six parameters characterize the spectral properties , including the depth of telluric features , the depth of stellar features , the star s projected rotational velocity ( @xmath7sin@xmath8 ) , a linear ( 2 parameter ) continuum normalization offset , and finally , the star s rv .",
    "the limb darkening coefficient used to calculate rotationally broadened profiles , which was _ not _ considered a free parameter in these calculations , was held fixed at 0.6 in all cases .",
    "only 1 of the 7 orders acquired ( nirspec order # 33 ) was modeled ; this is one of the few wavelength regions which has a sufficiently rich array of both the stellar and telluric absorption features , permitting precise rv calibration .",
    "the usable region of the observed order spans approximately 270  , from 2.288 @xmath5 m to 3.315 @xmath5 m ( figure [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the spectral modeling proceeded in essentially 3 stages .",
    "first , the a - type star spectra were modeled to construct initial estimates of the wavelength solution and instrumental profile for each observational set .",
    "since the spectra of a type stars are essentially featureless over this wavelength range , their spectra were modeled as simple telluric spectra , and 3 of the 10 parameters of the general fit were omitted ( stellar absorption depth , @xmath7sin@xmath8 , and rv ) .",
    "the best fit was determined by subtracting the model spectrum from the observed spectrum and applying a hamming filter to this difference to remove the residual fringing pattern .",
    "optimization was achieved by an iterative process that minimized the variance - weighted reduced @xmath33 of these filtered residuals , using the prescription described below .",
    "parameters determined for multiple a star observations within a set were averaged , weighted by their @xmath33 values , to determine the best `` first guess '' values for that set .",
    "the average best fit instrumental profile determined from the best fit models of the a star spectra corresponded to a resolving power of @xmath15 30,000 , with a dispersion of @xmath34 .",
    "this is larger than expected for this instrumental setup , which is predicted to yield resolving powers of @xmath35 @xcite . although we are unsure of the discrepancy , it may be attributable to the excellent seeing at mauna kea and starlight not fully filling the 0432 slit .",
    "each late - type stellar spectrum was modeled by adopting and holding fixed its set s estimates of the linear and quadratic terms of the wavelength solution .",
    "all other parameters were determined via an iterative fitting process , but at all times the parameters were nevertheless restricted to realistic ranges . in the first iteration the 0th order component of the wavelength solution was optimized by allowing it to vary ; the parameter describing the instrument profile was adopted from its set s estimate .",
    "the second iteration optimized the instrument profile by allowing it to vary .",
    "the third iteration was used to determine the stellar @xmath7sin@xmath8 by allowing it to vary .",
    "once complete , a chi - square weighted mean of the best - fit @xmath7sin@xmath8 value was computed and adopted for the star . in the final iteration only the 5 remaining parameters ( 2 normalization parameters , telluric depths , stellar depths , rv ) were allowed to vary .",
    "for the 1 observational set without any a star observations ( section 3 ) , the target stars of that set were modeled using the average a star parameters from all other sets as a first guess .",
    "the analysis then proceeded as described above .",
    "the agreement of measured stellar properties ( e.g. rvs , @xmath7sin@xmath8 ) from this set and other sets suggested the lack of a stars did not compromise the analysis in this case , likely because of the nearly identical observing setups carefully determined each time .    the specific",
    "prescription used to determine multiple - parameter best fits can have a significant impact on the results . in this first study we adopted a minimization of the filtered difference spectra based on the downhill simplex method of nelder & mead ( 1965 ) , as implemented by press et al .",
    "our implementation of this prescription enforced user - specified limits on each parameter by restarting an iteration with new parameters if any were out of bounds .",
    "the minimization proceeded until both the best fit @xmath33 dropped by less than one percent and all parameters remain consistent with recent values .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows an example model spectrum for comparison with the observed spectrum of the young star au mic .",
    "the residuals to the fit have a normalized dispersion of 1.5% , which is typical for the majority of modeled spectra .",
    "we note that the results from this last stage yield absolute rvs , since they are determined relative to _ at rest _ telluric absorption features .",
    "these values are then converted to barycentric velocities using a correction prescription accurate to @xmath36 m / s ( g. basri ; priv . comm . ) . for the interested reader",
    ", we note that @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite provide detailed descriptions of complementary methods to determine precise rvs with nod - subtracted infrared spectra .",

    "uncertainties in the @xmath7sin@xmath8 values are set to be the standard deviation of the @xmath7sin@xmath8 estimates using all epochs for each star and thus are not necessarily free of systematic effect .",

    "it is possible that the larger - than - expected rv dispersion of twa 13a is caused by either instrumental errors or stellar activity being larger than expected for this star during these observations ; these sources of variation are harder to predict and account for . as a possible test for the former , we compared the rv dispersion of twa 13a to that of its companion twa 13b .",
    "both stars are equally bright ( @xmath77 ) and in 13 of twa 13a s 14 observations , both stars were observed either immediately before or after one another .",

    "companion mass detection limits are determined via monte carlo simulations . since this survey is most sensitive to short period companions , we set limits only at representative orbital periods , namely 3 , 10 , 30 and 100 days .",
    "the shortest period is choosen to be near the peak in the orbital period distribution of hot jupiters while the other periods are chosen to demonstrate how the sensitivity declines with increasing orbital period , given the precision and temporal sampling of this survey . for each star ,",
    "a set of 10,000 orbits is generated with random inclinations , phases , and companions spanning a broad range of planetary and brown dwarf masses .",
    "for discussion purposes , we refer to companions with masses @xmath79 m@xmath80 as planets and more massive companions ( up to @xmath81 m@xmath80 ) as brown dwarfs .",
    "all orbits are assumed to be circular , as would be expected if these companions migrated to these locations via disk interactions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in combination with the stellar masses listed in table [ table1 ] ,",
    "these orbits are used to predict a set of rv measurements with the same temporal sampling as each star s set of observations .",
    "an assumed gaussian error of 53 m / s , equal to the median observational error above ( @xmath82 ) , is added to these measurements ; we note however that adding these relatively small errors has no significant effect upon the results .",
    "conservative detection limits are then set by determining the companion mass that induces a rv dispersion that is 2@xmath31 greater than the expected dispersion for the star s @xmath7sin@xmath8 ( see figure [ vsini_sigma_quadratic ] ) 99% of the time ; this is consistent with the criteria used to identify candidate variables such as twa 13a .",
    "the companion detection limits determined from this prescription at 3 , 10 , 30 , and 100 days are listed for all single stars in table [ table2 ] . the 3 field stars , which have the smallest rv dispersions , have the lowest companion mass detection limits . on average , these are 4.1 , 6.0 , 10 , and 13 m@xmath80 for the above 4 orbital periods , respectively .",
    "these observations confirm that these stars have no short - period massive planet or brown dwarf companions at any orbial orientation except possibly nearly face - on .    in assessing the young stars detection limits , we exclude the known or candidate rv variables and use only results for stars with 11 or more observations ( thus excluding gj 182 with only 6 observations ) . for this 18 star subsample ,",
    "the average detection limits are 8.5 , 13 , 17 , and 26 m@xmath80 at the above 4 orbital periods , respectively .",
    "the lowest mass stars within this subset have the lowest companion detection limits , as expected since the detection limit scales as @xmath83 .",

    "overall , the observations only exclude the presence of the very massive hot ( @xmath84 d ) jupiters . however , the observations confidently exlude all hot brown dwarf companions and all but the lowest mass warm ( @xmath85 d ) brown dwarf companions",
    ".    the rv measurements would translate to much stricter companion detection limits if the companion s orbital plane is assumed to be edge - on .",
    "this assumption is plausible for the young star au mic that is known to harbor an edge - on circumstellar disk ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "at an assumed age of 12 myr , its m0 spectral type corresponds to a stellar mass of 0.73 m@xmath27 . for this star ,",
    "we calculate companion detection limits using the same monte carlo simulations described above , but assuming an edge - on orientation for the orbit .",
    "this yields companion detection limits of 1.8 , 2.5 , 3.9 and 5.2 m@xmath80 at the above 4 periods , respectively .",
    "these detection limits are consistent with the lack of any transiting jupiter - sized planets found in this system @xcite .",
    "if massive jupiters do exist within the au mic system , they have not migrated inwards in its @xmath2 myr lifetime .",
    "one of the primary motivations for conducting this rv survey of young stars at infrared wavelengths , as opposed to optical wavelengths , was to mitigate the rv variations induced by stellar activity ; we subsequently refer to this as stellar jitter .",
    "to investigate the success of this , we compare estimates of the stellar jitter of our infrared observations to the estimates from optical observations .",
    "the infrared stellar jitter is estimated by subtracting , in quadrature , the instrumental and average theoretical errors from the observed dispersion for each star ( @xmath86 ) .",
    "this yielded values ranging from 36 m / s to 181 m / s , with a median value of 113 m / s ; these are illustrated in figure [ stellar_jitter ] versus @xmath7sin@xmath8 .",
    "the values are then compared to the stellar jitter values calculated from rv measurements in @xcite , who obtained precise optical rv measurements of 6 members of the @xmath1 pic association , including 2 stars in the present survey here , au mic and gj 3305 .",
    "gj 3305 is not included in these comparisons , however , because we identify it as a spectroscopic binary star .",
    "@xcite obtained precise rvs using the telluric oxygen band at 6900  with an instrumental precision of @xmath87 m / s .",
    "as with the infrared measurements , the stellar jitter is estimated by subtracting , in quadrature , the theoretical and instrumental uncertainties from the observed velocity dispersions .",
    "these results are plotted in figure [ stellar_jitter ] versus @xmath7sin@xmath8 , and range from 270 m / s to 490 m / s , with a mean of of 360 m / s .",
    "a comparison of these suggests that the stellar jitter at infrared ( @xmath28-band ) is approximately 3 times less than at optical wavelengths ( @xmath88-band ) .",
    "this is consistent with the reductions meausured by @xcite for the similar age star tw hya .",
    "the recent study by @xcite reports similar reductions between infrared and optical jitter for the younger t tauri stars dn tau and hubble i 4 , and slightly larger reductions ( a factor 4 - 5 ) for v827 tau and v836 tau .",
    "although the binary star gj 3305 is not included in these comparisons , we note that @xcite do not identify it as a spectroscopic binary , despite having observed it 11 times on 4 different nights .",
    "we attribute this to their limited sampling , its apparently low amplitude rv variations , and the larger stellar jitter associated with optical observations of young stars .",
    "we also note that we can not confirm the claim of @xcite that hip 12545 is a single - lined spectroscopic binary .",
    "although they do not report individual measurements , they claim to have measured large ( 20 km / s ) rv variations for this star using on high dispersion optical spectra .",
    "our 14 measurements of this star spanning from 2004 november 19 to 2006 july 6 have a dispersion of only 0.18 km / s .",
    "altogether these results confirm the expectation that infrared observations mitigate the rv variations due to stellar activity and , moreover , quantify the benefit .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , this is expected if the rv variations are primarily caused by cool star spots .",
    "however , infrared observations made during other chromospheric events such as giant flares or coronal mass ejections may have little or no benefit over optical measurements .",
    "it has been shown that giant flares on active stars can cause temporary shifts in optically determined rv of several hundred m / s @xcite . although we do not have information to identify flare or flare - like events in our data",
    ", this could explain the occasional large ( @xmath89 200 m / s ) , one - time rv changes seen for some stars .",
    "one of our clearest examples occured during observations of the slowly rotating star twa 7 ( @xmath7sin@xmath8 = 4.5 km / s ) .",
    "as illustrated in figure [ rv_twa7 ] , all but 1 of its 12 rv measurements are consistent to within 100 m / s ( @xmath72 = 47 m / s ) ; the discrepant epoch deviates by @xmath90 m / s from the mean rv of the other 11 epochs .",
    "comparisons of stars observed immediately before and after this epoch show no similar large amplitude deviations , which might be expected if the detector was especially noisy at this time ; the deviation appears to be limited to this observation .",
    "the snr of this observation is also above the mean of the remaining observations , and the spectrum shows no defects , such as an cosmic ray event that was not corrected in the optimal extraction .",
    "this leads us to believe the deviation is intrinsic to the star itself . because we ca nt fully explain the event ( or others like it ) , we highlight it here as a cautionary remark for future surveys . coordinated photometric and/or spectroscopic observations that target chromospheric indicators may help identify these events , which when excluded , would improve the overall sensitivity to low mass companions .",
    "finally , the ensemble infrared stellar jitter results provide a guide for the achievable rv precision for young active stars in the limit of high snr spectra with no wavelength calibration error . for the slowest rotating stars ( @xmath7sin@xmath8 @xmath91 km / s ) ,",
    "the median stellar jitter is 77 m / s ( 1 @xmath31 spread of 21 m / s ) . for stars with modest rotation ( 6 km / s @xmath92sin@xmath93 12 km / s ) , the median stellar jitter is 108 m / s ( 1 @xmath31 spread of 43 m / s ) . and for the most rapidly rotating stars ( @xmath7sin@xmath8 of 12 - 23 km / s ) , the median stellar jitter is 168 m / s ( 1 @xmath31 spread of 24 m / s ) .",
    "we also note that none of the 4 stars with @xmath7sin@xmath8 values @xmath11 km / s have stellar jitter values above 180 m / s , possibly hinting at stellar jitter saturation ( figure [ stellar_jitter ] ) .",
    "although the available data can not robustly confirm this , we highlight this possibility because this @xmath7sin@xmath8 limit is similar to the observed x - ray saturation limit of @xmath94 km / s , though for slightly more massive stars in the pleiades @xcite ; the x - ray saturation is interpreted as a consequence of maximal coverage of star spots .",
    "likewise , we find that stars with the largest stellar jitter have rotational periods @xmath95 days ( table 1 ) .",
    "as demonstrated in @xcite , subsolar mass stars with rotation periods @xmath9 3.0 - 3.5 days ( depending somewhat on mass ) all have saturated x - ray emission .",
    "given that the most rapidly rotating stars studied here appear to be near or beyond the regime where x - rays saturate , its plausible to presume that the stellar jitter is also saturated .",
    "the results have implications for how precisely the radial velocities of rapidly rotating stars can be determined .",
    "we present the results of a high - precision infrared rv study of 20 young stars in the @xmath1 pic and tw hya associations , as well as the chromospherically active , young disk m3.5 star gj 873 . high spectral resolution",
    "( r @xmath15 30,000 ) measurements at 2.3 @xmath5 m were obtained with nirspec at the keck observatory ; the majority of stars have more than a dozen epochs , with a typical temporal sampling of several observations over a week - long run , and then several runs over 2 to 3 years .",
    "precise rvs are determined using telluric absorption features as an absolute wavelength reference .",
    "each observation is modeled as the combination of a telluric spectrum and a synthetically generated stellar spectrum , both convolved by a parametrized instrumental profile and projected onto a parametrized wavelength solution .",
    "the best fit , which includes the rv of the star , is determined by minimizing the @xmath96 .",
    "this modeling technique yields rv dispersions of @xmath97 m / s for 13 + epochs each of 3 slowly rotating field stars .",
    "the dispersion of these rv measurements is dominated by instrumental errors and thus @xmath97 m / s can be considered a practical precision limit for nirpsec ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; this precision is nevertheless well above nirspec s original design specifications .",
    "significant improvements to this precision will likley require a new detector to mitigate dominant noise sources such as fringing , variable bias , and read noise .",
    "the observed rv dispersions for young stars range from 48 m / s to 197 m / s .",
    "these dispersions are dominated by noise from stellar activity , or stellar jitter .",
    "we estimate the contribution from stellar jitter by subtracting , in quadrature , the average instrumental noise ( 46 m / s ) and the calculated theoretical noise ( @xmath71 m / s ) from the observed dispersions .",
    "the stellar jitter increases with projected rotational velocity ( @xmath7sin@xmath8 ) . the slowest rotating stars ( @xmath7sin@xmath8 @xmath91",
    "km / s ) have a median stellar jitter of 77 m / m , modest rotation stars ( 6 km / s @xmath92sin@xmath93 12 km / s ) have a median stellar jitter of 108 m / s , and the most rapidly rotating stars ( @xmath7sin@xmath8 of 12 - 23 km / s ) have a median stellar jitter of 168 m / s .",
    "there is also tentative evidence that stellar jitter saturates at @xmath98 m / s above @xmath7sin@xmath8 values of @xmath2 km / s , or below rotational periods of @xmath99 days , consistent with the rate of rotation that causes x - rays to saturate .",
    "these infrared stellar jitter values are , on average , a factor of 3 less than the stellar jitter values of similar age @xmath1 pic association stars observed at optical ( r - band ) wavelengths .",
    "case studies by @xcite and @xcite corroborate these reductions .",
    "this is expected if stellar jitter is predominantly caused by cool star spots , and confirms that infrared measurements have a significant advantage over optical measurements in obtaining precise rv measurements of active stars .",
    "three stars have rv dispersions significantly above the level expected for their @xmath7sin@xmath8 .",
    "the smoothly accelerating rvs of 2 of these stars , gj3305 and twa 23 , indicate they are single - lined spectroscopic binaries .",
    "the rv orbits are still under - determined . in the case of gj 3305 , the motion is likely caused by its recently identified @xmath100 milliarcsecond companion @xcite .",
