    "in a group formation game , each player can be a member of one and only one group , and individual payoffs depend , directly or indirectly , on group structure .",
    "many difficult and pressing economic problems fall into this category , including rent - seeking , resource management , contract bidding , volunteer organization , problem solving , and political lobbying . depending on the application , the collection of individuals",
    "may be called a group , club , or coalition . however , apart from this basic semantic difference , all of these problems share the same basic characteristics  they all create incentives , such as economies of scale , risk - sharing , skill aggregation , and social capital accumulation , that make working within a group ( coalition or club ) more attractive than working alone . in this paper ,",
    "i combine two recent areas of interest  dynamic coalition formation games and social network constraints  to explore how groups form when individuals move dynamically and face social , spatial , and institutional constraints on group membership .",
    "traditionally , group formation has been modeled statically  that is , players make their group membership decisions simultaneously  see , for instance , hart and kurz ( 1983 ) , nitzen ( 1991 ) , yi and shin ( 1997 ) , konishi and weber ( 1997 ) , and heintzelman _ et al _ ( 2006 ) .",
    "these models are advantageous because of their analytical simplicity and clarity . however , as i will show in section [ sec : static - coalition - formation ] , static group formation games often have multiple equilibria , suggesting that there are potentially large gains to clarifying the process by which they form .",
    "the presence of multiple equilibria raises a new , more complicated set of questions . which of these equilibria can we realistically expect to reach",
    "given a dynamic group formation process ?",
    "will the equilibrium outcome reached be efficient ?",
    "what characteristics of the problem affect that outcome ? these questions can not be addressed using a static model , and thus researchers have increasingly turned towards dynamic models of the coalition formation process .",
    "recent work spans may different subfields , including industrial organization , political economy , rent - seeking , and local public good provision and includes ( among many others ) bloch ( 1996 ) , yi ( 2000 ) , arnold and schwalbe ( 2002 ) , konishi and ray ( 2003 ) , macho - stadler _ et al _ ( 2004 ) , arnold and wooders ( 2005 ) , and page and wooders ( 2007 ) .",
    "however , these dynamic group formation models largely still assume that players are unencumbered by social , spatial , or institutional barriers to group membership .",
    "that is , the players interact freely with all other individuals in the game and can join any of the groups in the game without regard to the composition of the group .",
    "this is a reasonable assumption in some contexts  however , in many other cases , individuals face substantial barriers in making their group membership decisions .",
    "the nature of these barriers will differ depending on the context of the specific problem being considered .",
    "barriers to group membership may be social ( eg : an individual can only join a group that contains someone he knows ) or spatial ( eg : an individual can only join a group with close neighbors )",
    ". some of these barriers are explicit ( eg : a requirement that a current member `` vouch '' for the applicant ) but others are implicit ( eg : a social norm against attending a party composed only of strangers ) .",
    "the barriers may either limit actions ( an individual is unable to join a particular group ) or information ( an individual does not know about the group ) .",
    "however , by modeling these constraints explicitly , we can look beyond the more superficial of these differences and ask a whole new set of questions . how do characteristics of the underlying constraint affect the eventual group structure ?",
    "are individuals better or worse off when they are constrained more heavily ?",
    "how do constraints of different types affect social welfare ?    in this paper ,",
    "i model the constraints faced by individuals via a network of connections  a player can only join a group if she is connected to a current member .",
    "this method allows me to use machinery from the burgeoning networks literature , which explores how social , spatial and institutional networks affect individual behavior .",
    "this literature encompasses a wide range of subfields that ( as noted in jackson ( 2005 ) ) have only recently started to interact .",
    "one branch of the literature has developed tools used to identify communities within existing social networks ( see , for instance , girvan and newman ( 2002 ) , newman and girvan ( 2004 ) , and copic _ et al _ ( 2007 ) ) ; another branch examines how limiting interactions between individuals can affect strategic behavior ( see , for instance , galeotti _ et al _ ( 2007 ) and charness and jackson ( 2006 ) ) ; and a third branch explores the dynamics of how social networks form ( see jackson ( 2005 ) for a survey of this work ) .    by combining elements of these two emerging literatures ,",
    "i am able to illustrate the importance of both dynamics and network constraints in the group formation process . as a baseline for comparison ,",
    "i start with a static game in which individuals are completely unconstrained in their choice of groups and show that this game has multiple equilibria .",
    "i then allow individuals to move sequentially , and solve explicitly for the set of nash equilibria of this game .",
    "i show that the dynamics act as an equilibrium refinement . however , the equilibrium reached in the dynamic game is highly suboptimal  the negative externality imposed by entering individuals drives groups to be much too large , relative to the social optimum .",
    "i then compare the grouping behavior of the unconstrained individuals to the behavior of individuals constrained by an exogenous network of connections .",
    "the network limits a player s action set to those groups containing individuals she is connected to .",
    "i show that the network constraint mitigates the tendency for groups to get too large .",
    "the efficiency of the outcome depends on the topological characteristics of the network constraint ",
    "social welfare is higher when the network is sparse and highly ordered .",
    "this result has the surprising implication that informational , institutional , and geographic barriers to group membership may actually improve social welfare by restricting groups from becoming too large .",
    "finally , i consider optimal institutional design and show that the optimal membership rule also depends on network topology  when a network is dense or random , the exclusive membership rule ( which allows a group to reject members who do not improve the group s welfare ) is always optimal .",
    "however , when the network is sparse or highly ordered , the exclusive membership rule can lead to highly suboptimal results .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : basic - model ] , i introduce a static coalition formation model , in which individuals choose their group membership simultaneously .",
    "i characterize the set of nash equilibria of that game , and show that only one is optimal . in section [ sec : seq unconstrained ] ,",
    "i transform the static model by allowing individuals to make their group membership decisions sequentially over time .",
    "this defines a dynamic game similar to that of arnold and wooders ( 2005 ) .",
    "i characterize the set of nash equilibria of this game , and show that a single , highly suboptimal equilibrium survives . in section [ sec : seq network constraint ] , i introduce the network constraint .",
    "i first characterize the set of nash equilibria of the constrained static game .",
    "i then move to the dynamic game and show how network topology affects social welfare . in section [ sec :",
    "opt inst design ] , i consider optimal institutional design and show that the optimal membership rule depends on the topology of the network constraint . in section [",
    "sec : extensions and conclusions ] , i conclude and discuss extensions to the model .",
    "before considering the behavior of individuals who face a constraint , i will first consider a game in which individuals are unconstrained .",
    "this game is actually a special case of the constrained game ( ie : one in which all individuals are connected ) and thus provides a good baseline for comparison between this game and the existing unconstrained literature .",
    "consider a group formation game with @xmath0 homogeneous individuals , @xmath1 .",
    "an individual can be a member of one and only one group  thus , the group structure at time @xmath2 is a partition of @xmath3 , @xmath4 , where @xmath5 denotes the set of individuals in group @xmath6 . note that the number of groups is determined endogenously , and thus @xmath7 may vary from one period to the next .",
    "the set of all such partitions of the players into groups is denoted @xmath8 .",
    "although all of the games defined in this paper could be played using a generalized payoff function , in the following i will assume that the players have identical payoff functions that depend only on the size of the player s own group .",
    "thus , individual @xmath9 payoffs are given by @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 is the size of group @xmath6 .",
    "i also assume that @xmath13 is single - peaked with maximum value @xmath14 .",
    "the assumption that payoffs depend only on own group size obviously does not allow for externalities between groups . nor does it allow players to have preferences over group composition .",
    "however , this is an appropriately simple starting point for dynamic analysis  to the extent that inter - coalition externalities muddy behavior , they are best left to future extensions .",
    "i will also assume that payoffs are single - peaked in group size .",
    "this assumption is useful because individual and social preferences are aligned  the individuals all want to be in groups of size @xmath14 , and social welfare is highest when this occurs .",
    "i will show that the equilibrium reached is suboptimal , _ despite this alignment_. the assumption that payoffs are single - peaked also covers nearly all cases that we might encounter  generalizing further would add considerable complication without yielding much useful insight .",
    "however , extensions to more general payoff forms are obviously important , and are of interest for future studies .",
    "section [ sec : extensions and conclusions ] includes a discussion of these generalizations .",
    "define @xmath15 to be the smallest @xmath16 such that @xmath17 .",
    "that is , @xmath15 is the largest group that will form before an individual forms a new group of size 2 . if @xmath18 , then a new group will never form , and for convenience , i will define @xmath19 in these cases .",
    "figure [ illustrating gbar ] illustrates an example of @xmath15 with @xmath20 .",
    "an illustration of @xmath15 the smallest @xmath16 such that @xmath17 . ]    note that since individuals in this game are homogeneous , the exact arrangement of the players in the groups is not as important as the sizes of the groups .",
    "thus , i will often find it convenient to refer to the vector of group sizes resulting from a particular partition of the individuals into coalitions , rather than referring to the partition itself . to that end , define the _ group size vector _ of a partition @xmath21 by @xmath22 .",
    "note that the mapping from partitions to group size vectors is many - to - one , and thus the mapping from equilibrium partitions to equilibrium group size vectors will be as well .      ultimately , the process of group formation is a dynamic one  individuals join , leave , and form new groups over time .",
    "however , the assumption that moves are made simultaneously may be accurate in some instances and since dynamics add a good deal of analytical complication to the model , it is reasonable to ask whether making the model dynamic adds to our understanding of the problem .",
    "to that end , i will first examine a static group formation model .",
    "i show that when payoffs are single peaked in group size , there are often multiple nash equilibria . in section",
    "[ sec : seq unconstrained ] , i show i allow individuals to choice their group membership sequentially , and show that the dynamics of the game refine the set of equilibria , leaving a single equilibrium group size vector .",
    "this indicates that adding model dynamics can yield insights beyond those gained from static models .",
    "consider a static group formation game with @xmath0 players and payoffs , @xmath13 , single - peaked in group size .",
    "individuals choose their group membership simultaneously .",
    "we can think of the individuals as choosing a `` location '' , and all of the individuals who jump to the same location are then members of the same group  thus , an individual s behavior strategy consists of a choice of coalition : @xmath23 .",
    "the pair @xmath24 defines the static coalition formation game .",
    "a nash equilibrium of this game is a partition of the players into coalitions , such that no individual wishes to deviate unilaterally .",

    "let @xmath27 denote the set of nash equilibrium coalition size vectors induced by those equilibrium partitions .    in the following ,",
    "i characterize @xmath27 .",
    "this characterization reveals several interesting aspects of group formation with single - peaked utility and also establishes the need for equilibrium refinement .",
    "[ lem : at most one small]-[lem :- odd size ] establish several characteristics that an equilibrium of the static game will have : 1 ) the coalitions will mostly be larger than the social optimum ( at most one will be smaller ) and 2 ) all of the groups larger than the optimum will be approximately the same size . theorem [ thm : static eq ] assembles these conditions into a complete characterization of @xmath27 .",
    "finally , theorem [ thm : number of static eq ] puts a lower bound on the number of equilibria in the set @xmath27 , showing that this static game will often have multiple equilibria .",
    "lemma [ lem : at most one small ] states that in equilibrium , most groups will be larger than the social optimum  at most one group can be too small .",

    "but then players in group 1 have an incentive to move to group 2 , so @xmath22 can not be an equilibrium    lemma [ lem : at most one small ] implies that in characterizing @xmath27 , we need consider only two cases : either all of the groups are larger than the socially optimal size ( @xmath35 ) , or exactly one group is small ( @xmath36and @xmath37 ) .",
    "the following two lemmas address the sizes of the groups in these two different cases .",
    "lemma [ lem : all same size ] shows that in any equilibrium where all groups are larger than the social optimum , the groups must be approximately the same size .",

    "it might , for example , represent a simple rent - seeking game , in which players compete for a single rent .",
    "there are many incentives for individuals to pool their efforts and compete as a group : risk averse individuals may be willing to trade some rent in expectation for a more consistent income stream ; a complicated rent seeking task may require a range of skills ; and economies of scale may make larger groups more likely to win .",
    "however , individuals must weigh these advantages against the disadvantages of higher maintenance costs , free - rider problems , and the division of rents .",
    "many of these incentives come down to a decision over different size groups .",
    "thus , we might think of this example as one in which individuals have determined that a rent - seeking group of size 10 maximizes their expected utilities by mitigating risk and taking advantage of economies of scale .",
    "beyond that ideal size , the losses from managing a larger size group , free - riding off of others efforts , and division of rents between a larger number of people reduce the expected utility of the individuals in those groups .",
    "however , they still prefer that larger group to pursuing the rents alone .",
    "when a group has more than 17 members , the costs of maintaining that group make pursuing rents alone more attractive than staying in the group .",
    "lemma [ lem : at most one small ] indicates that in any nash equilibrium of this game , at most one coalition will be smaller than the socially optimal group size , @xmath63 .",
    "lemma [ lem : all same size ] indicates that all of the groups larger than the social optimum will be approximately the same size .",
    "using these two facts , one can show that there are 5 nash equilibria of this static game : @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 .",
    "note that @xmath71 is _ not _ an equilibrium , because an individual in a group of size 20 is better off striking out as an individual .",
    "this example illustrates several difficulties with the static game .",
    "first of all , the set of stable coalition configurations is highly sensitive to the particular parameters used .",
    "for example , with @xmath72 individuals , the game illustrated above does not have an equilibrium with a small group .",
    "however , if we change the game slightly , so that there are @xmath73 individuals , there will be an `` odd - sized '' equilibrium : @xmath74 .",
    "secondly , most games will have multiple stable group size configurations .",
    "in fact , it is possible to put a lower bound on the number of equilibria for a given game .",
    "theorem [ thm : number of static eq ] does just that .",
    "[ thm : number of static eq]let @xmath24 be a static group formation game .",
    "then @xmath75 .",
    "i will set the lower bound by enumerating the equilibria in which all groups are larger than the social optimum ( ie : the first set in theorem [ thm : static eq ] ) .",
    "note that since all groups are approximately the same size , each equilibrium with all large groups is entirely characterized by the _ number _ of groups .",
    "the largest possible group is @xmath15 and the smallest possible group is @xmath14 .",
    "thus , there should be one equilibrium for each integer in the interval @xmath76 $ ] , and @xmath15 divide @xmath0 evenly , but including that complication only adds more equilibria , keeping the lower bound accurate ( albeit a bit lower than is strictly necessary ) . ] or @xmath77 .",
    "since the lower bound in theorem [ thm : number of static eq ] is usually greater than 1 , the static game will usually have multiple equilibria .",
    "however , the static game provides no insight into which of those equilibria is most likely to occur .",
    "are they all equally likely , or is there a distribution of equilibria ?",
    "does that distribution depend in a predictable way on the observable elements of a particular problem ?",
    "these questions are particularly important because some of the equilibria lead to considerably higher social welfare than others .",
    "the following section shows that a more dynamic model of the group formation process , in which individuals make their decisions sequentially over time , provides an equilibrium refinement .",
    "as i will show , not all of the equilibria characterized in theorem [ thm : static eq ] are attainable when players start the game as individuals .",
    "surprisingly , the surviving equilibrium group size vector is the worst possible of the static equilibria .",
    "while a static group formation game @xmath24 will typically have more than one equilibrium , only one is efficient .",
    "this obviously begs the question  will individuals moving sequentially reach the efficient coalition arrangement , or will they reach an inefficient outcome ?",
    "will that outcome be unique or are several outcomes possible ? in this section , i show that allowing the players to move sequentially refines the set of equilibria from the static game .",
    "when the players start the game as individuals , they will always reach an equilibrium group structure with the same coalition size vector .",
    "furthermore , it is not the socially optimal one  when individuals make their group formation decisions dynamically , they end up in groups that are much too large , despite a clear alignment between individual and social welfare .      in the unconstrained sequential group formation game ,",
    "individuals are able to join any currently existing group @xmath78 , or alternatively they can strike off as an individual , forming a group of size 1 . thus , individual @xmath79 s action set at time @xmath2 can be denoted by @xmath80 , where @xmath81 denotes the action of striking out as an individual . in the following , i will assume that individuals make their group membership decisions myopically  that is , they decide which group will maximize their return , given only the _ current _ group structure .",
    "this defines a behavior strategy that simply maps the current group partition , @xmath82 , to the individual s action set as defined above : @xmath83 .",
    "this myopic behavior strategy is identical to that used in arnold and schwalbe ( 2002 ) and arnold and wooders ( 2005 ) .",
    "the myopia assumption is convenient because it makes the analysis more tractable .",
    "however , in the case of sequential coalition formation games , it is also behaviorally more reasonable than perfect foresight .",
    "the sequential nature of this game induces an explosion in number of possible states , making the sequential coalition formation game more like chess or go than tic - tac - toe .",
    "moreover , as i will mention later , one can show that myopia is not the sole cause of the observed behavior , making the assumption relatively innocuous .",
    "@xmath84 defines an unconstrained sequential coalition formation game , where @xmath85 is a particular order of motion for the players .",

    "regardless of the order of motion , a new group forms only if all existing groups have reached size @xmath15 .",

    "this is true regardless of how many `` large '' groups ( groups with more than one individual ) there are .",
    "thus , the second group forms when there are 83 individuals and one group of 17 , the third group forms when there are 69 individuals and two groups of size 17 , and so on .",
    "the last group forms when there are 15 individuals and five groups of size 17 .    this sixth group is the final group that will ever form .",
    "individuals may ( and indeed , will ) move between the existing groups , but no new group will ever form .",
    "the individuals will stop moving when all six groups are approximately the same size ",
    "namely , in the configuration with two groups of size 16 and four groups of size 17 : @xmath70 . as predicted by theorem [ thm : worst possible eq",
    "] , this is the stable group arrangement with the lowest possible social welfare value .",
    "note also that at no point did we specify the order of play  thus , the players will reach the arrangement @xmath70 regardless of their order of motion .",
    "one might be tempted to attribute the behavior detailed in theorems [ thm : number seq eq ] and [ thm : worst possible eq ] to the players myopia . however , it is possible to show that even perfectly forward - looking players will form groups that are larger than the socially optimal size .",
    "since even forward - looking agents reach a suboptimal equilibrium , it is clear that myopia is not all that is at work in this result .",
    "the cause of the observed behavior is the externality that joining a group imposes on existing group members . when the group is smaller than the social optimum , that externality is positive",
    "however , when the group is at the optimal size , the externality is a negative one .",
    "the entering member is obviously made better off by the change ( otherwise , he would not move ) , but the rest of the group is made worse off .",
    "the negative externality causes individuals to enter a group that does not benefit from the extra member , which then drives groups to become too large .",
    "obviously , in the real world , groups of individuals will sometimes make their membership decisions together .",
    "if we allow a subgroup of up to @xmath101 individuals to move as a group , then any equilibrium that exists will necessarily have smaller groups .",
    "however , the set of equilibria that are stable to such coalitional deviations are largely empty ( see arnold and wooders ( 2005 ) for a discussion of this problem ) . more importantly , when we move on to games with a network constraint , as in the following section , it becomes less clear what is meant by a configuration that is stable to `` coalitional deviations '' .",
    "analysis of more complicated , network - specific equilibrium concepts are obviously venues for future work .",
    "additionally , there is empirical evidence that groups tend to be too large .",
    "many institutions exist that constrain the size of coalitions , a measure that would be unnecessary if individuals found themselves in groups of ideal size . in the following section , i consider the effects of social and spatial constraints on individual behavior and show that such constraints can improve total social welfare .",
    "section [ sec : opt inst design ] continues this discussion by exploring the effect of the network constraint on optimal institutional design .",
    "the analysis of the previous section ( as well as much of the existing literature ) assumes that individuals are free to join any existing group , regardless of its current composition .",
    "however , the cases where individuals are completely unconstrained are relatively few  in most instances , individuals face social , spatial , and information constraints when making their membership decisions .",
    "consider , for example , a set of farmers forming water management groups along the banks of a river . although it is conceivable that the farmers would organize into groups at random , they are more likely to join farmers who are adjacent to them on the river than those in a distant location .",
    "similarly , research groups are more likely to be composed of colleagues than strangers , and an individual is unlikely to attend a party unless he already knows someone who is attending .",
    "the most natural way of modeling these constraints is via a network of connections .",
    "i give each individual an exogenous network of connections to other people .",
    "an individual can only join a group if it contains a person she is connected to on the network .",
    "more formally , @xmath102 defines a particular sequential group formation game with a network constraint , where @xmath103 is an exogenous , unchanging matrix of connections between individuals  that is , @xmath104 if @xmath79 is connected to @xmath6 on the network and @xmath105 otherwise . in the constrained game ,",
    "an individual s action set is restricted to include only those groups she is connected to : @xmath106 .",
    "clearly such a matrix of connections can model any set of constraints faced by individual agents , making the network formulation of this problem extremely general .",
    "however , there is an additional advantage of using a network constraint ",
    "namely , it allows us to draw conclusions about general `` classes '' of constraints that seem similar , without getting caught up in the details of a particular case .",
    "for instance , we might want to determine how individuals on a spatial network behave differently than individuals on a social network , without getting tied up in the details of a particular network structure .",
    "fortunately , by varying only a few parameters , we can obtain a natural spectrum of network structures that correspond nicely to the types of networks that we would observe in the real world . for my analysis of network topology",
    "i will use a watts - strogatz network , which has only two parameters .",
    "the first is average degree , @xmath107 , which enumerates the average number of connections each individual in the network has .",
    "the second is the watts - strogatz parameter , @xmath108 , which allows us to examine a spectrum of different network types ",
    "when @xmath109 , the network is regular and approximates a spatial network ; when @xmath110 , the individuals are connected at random ; for values of @xmath111 between 0 and 1 , the network has a `` small world '' structure , which approximates that of a social network .",
    "a pair @xmath112 describes a family of networks with similar topological characteristics .",
    "note that when the network is fully connected , every player knows someone in every group and therefore @xmath80 .",
    "thus , the unconstrained static and sequential games considered previously are a special case of the constrained game ",
    "namely one where the average degree is at a maximum : @xmath113 .",
    "i will first use the static game to illustrate the effects of the network constraints on individual behavior given a particular network and then i will show how social welfare is affected by the network constraint .      as in the unconstrained case , i will start by looking at individual behavior when players make their group membership decisions simultaneously .",
    "this section generalizes the results of section [ sec : static - coalition - formation ] to the constrained case .",
    "an equilibrium of the static game with a network constraint is a partition of the players into groups that is both feasible and individually rational .",

    "note that this would not be an equilibrium on the fully - connected network because the players in group c would move group a. ]    it is obvious from figure [ fig : ring with new eq ] how the ring affects the stability of this configuration .",
    "the individuals in group c would like to join group a , but they are unable to because they are not connected to that group on the social network .",
    "if the network were fully connected , the individuals in group c would like to move to group a , and the configuration would not be stable .",
    "note that the constraint of the ring could represent either a constraint on actions ( the players would move if they could ) or information ( the players would move if they knew ) .",
    "it could also equally well represent an explicit constraint ( a legal constraint ) , an implicit constraint ( a social norm ) , or a functional constraint ( a geographic coincidence ) .",
    "this result is significant because while existing models predict that groups will be the same size in equilibrium , real - world groups are seldom identical in size .",
    "this analysis indicates that if individuals are constrained , group sizes need not be the same . by exploiting the fact that any two connected individuals form a fully connected subgraph",
    ", we can extend the results in theorem [ thm : static eq ] to the current case . to do so",

    "obviously , as degree increases , the drop in social welfare from the regular graph to the random graph becomes less dramatic .",

    "one possible reason for this trend is that as the watts - strogatz parameter increases , the clustering coefficient decreases .",
    "the clustering coefficient is the probability that two of a nodes neighbors are connected . as the clustering coefficient decreases , the probability that an individual knows more than one person in a group decreases , and the expected size of the action set increases .",
    "thus , as the clustering coefficient decreases , the network becomes less constraining and average social welfare declines .",
    "there is considerable evidence that real - world groups do tend to be too large .",
    "the most compelling evidence is that groups have developed institutions to artificially restrict membership ",
    "a measure that i argue would not be required if individuals self - organized optimally . in this section ,",
    "i examine how network topology affects the optimal choice of membership rule .",
    "when individuals are homogeneous , there are only two possible membership rules : the `` open membership rule '' ( no restriction on group membership ) and the `` exclusive membership rule '' ( groups can reject a member ) . when individuals are unconstrained , the exclusive membership rule is always preferable to the open membership rule .",
    "in other words , the coalition members should never allow the group to get larger than @xmath14 .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     one might think that the exclusive membership rule would _ always _ be preferably .",
    "however , figure [ fig : leaf example ] illustrates that when individuals are restricted in their choice of groups via a social network , the exclusive membership rule can sometimes result in group configurations with extremely low social welfare values .",
    "an even simpler example uses a ring network .",
    "suppose 20 individuals are arranged on a ring as shown in figure [ fig : ring bad outcome ] .",
    "if @xmath137 , then the exclusive membership rule may cause individuals to be `` isolated '' between groups of the ideal size . both of these examples highlight why the exclusive membership rule is less beneficial when individuals are constrained in their choice of groups . in the unconstrained case , all of the individuals who were excluded from other groups could band together .",
    "when individuals are restricted , they no longer have that option , and there is a much greater chance of individuals being forced into low utility outcomes .",
    "an example illustrating how the exclusive membership rule can be detrimental on a ring .",
    "this is a game with 20 individuals arranged on a ring and @xmath137 . because the large groups can prevent them from joining , the isolated individuals must accept a lower payoff . ]    once again",
    ", more general results can be obtained by averaging over many runs on topologically similar networks .",
    "figure [ fig : opt inst design degree ] shows that when degree is low , the exclusive membership rule is no longer the clear optimal choice .",
    "similarly , figure [ fig : opt inst design w - s ] shows that when the graph is very ordered , the exclusive membership rule is , on average , less beneficial . given the possibility of extremely poor outcomes , such as those pictured in figures [ fig : leaf example ] and [ fig : ring bad outcome ] , the open membership rule may be more desirable when the network constraint is low degree or highly ordered .    ]    ]",
    "the model i have introduced in this paper lends itself to numerous interesting extensions .",
    "although i have chosen a very simple payoff function for this initial work , the basic game structure of the model is easily generalized to model any problem in which payoffs depend on coalition structure .",
    "for instance , by making payoffs a function of the entire coalition size vector ( @xmath138 ) , we can include inter - coalitional externalities .",
    "this would allow us to model ( among other things ) a sequential version of the traditional 2-period rent - seeking game ( such as that in nitzen ( 1991 ) ) or resource - allocation game ( such as that in heintzelman _",
    "et al _ ( 2006 ) ) and ask whether inter - coalitional externalities are affected by the structure of the underlying network constraint . for example , we might ask whether social welfare is higher when resource management groups are formed according to geography ( eg : water management groups on a river ) or social / family ties ( eg : fisheries on a bay ) .",
    "if we allow heterogeneity of players , then the payoff function might depend on the _ composition _ of the groups , as well as their size ( @xmath139 ) , which would allow us to explore another set of problems .",
    "if individuals are heterogeneous in ability or tool sets , then we can ask where self - organized teams contain an optimal level of diversity for problem - solving .",
    "if individuals are heterogeneous in ideology , we can explore the formation of lobbyist organizations and political parties .",
    "more abstractly , if individuals are heterogeneous in an arbitrary characteristic , we can model discriminatory behavior .    finally , making the network structure endogenous may add some insight into network formation ( see jackson ( 2005 ) for an excellent survey of this growing literature ) .",
    "this might be accomplished either by making links weighted , or allowing links to be added an lost over time .",
    "the process of group formation is one that has attracted increasing interest in the past decade . in this paper ,",
    "i use a simple extension of a static coalition formation game to illustrate the importance of dynamics and membership constraints in the coalition formation process .",
    "i show that in the sequential coalition formation game , individuals tend to form groups that are too large , especially when players are unconstrained .",
    "real world groups often implement membership restrictions , indicating that without such restrictions , the groups would tend to be too large .",
    "i also show that if individuals are constrained by a network , they tend to form groups that are closer to the ideal size , without the addition of membership restrictions .",
    "in fact , constraining group membership by requiring a social or spatial connection can effectively substitute for the institutional constraint of a membership rule .",

    "note that @xmath148 is not an equilibrium of the game presented in figure [ fig : seq groups of 2 ] , proving that the set of equilibria may depend on the order of play . ]    because the first few players to move are separated from the existing large groups , they are unable to impose on the groups that have already formed , as they did in the previous example .",
    "the result is an equilibrium coalition structure with four groups of the ideal size : @xmath148 .",
    "since @xmath148 is in @xmath149 but not in @xmath150 , it is clear that the order of motion does affect the set of equilibria .    of course",
    ", the outcome pictured in figure [ fig : seq groups of 2 ] is not the only possible equilibrium of the game with order of play @xmath146 .",
    "many players in this game are forced to make random choices .",
    "figure [ fig : seq groups of 3 ] shows that if some of those players make different choices , then the players will find themselves in a different configuration  in this case , @xmath151 .",
    "this game is identical to that presented in figure [ fig : seq groups of 2 ] .",
    "note , in particular , that the order of play is the same : @xmath147 .",
    "however , the players have made different random choices , leading to a different equilibrium outcome : @xmath151 .",
    "this shows that when players are sufficiently constrained , there need not be a unique equilibrium coalition size configuration . ]    this is an illustration of the first half of claim [ cla : not like unconstrained ] , which states that a coalition formation game with a network constraint need not have a unique equilibrium coalition size configuration ."

    "<S> in this paper , i illustrate the importance of both dynamics and network constraints in the group formation process . </S>",
    "<S> i introduce a class of games called sequential group formation games , in which players make their group membership decisions sequentially over time , and show that the dynamics act as an equilibrium refinement . however , the resulting equilibrium is highly suboptimal  </S>",
    "<S> groups tend to be much too large , relative to the social optimum . </S>",
    "<S> i then introduce a network constraint , which limits a player s action set to those groups that she is connected to on an exogenous network . </S>",
    "<S> the network constraint mitigates the tendency for groups to get too large and social welfare is higher when the network is sparse and highly ordered . </S>",
    "<S> this result has the surprising implication that informational , institutional , and geographic barriers to group membership may actually improve social welfare by restricting groups from becoming too large . </S>"
