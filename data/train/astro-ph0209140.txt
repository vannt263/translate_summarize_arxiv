    "the existence of massless scalar partners associated with the tensor field of einstein gravity is generically predicted by the recent attempts toward unifying all elementary forces in nature based on supergravity , superstrings @xcite , and other higher dimensional gravity theories . in these theories , time variations of fundamental constants such as the gravitational constant and the fine structure constant",
    "are naturally introduced .",
    "a recent claim of the time varying fine structure constant from observations of qso absorption lines@xcite may be a piece of evidence .",
    "scalar - tensor gravity theories , whose original version was proposed by jordan @xcite and brans and dicke @xcite and were extended in a more general framework later @xcite , naturally provide coupling between the massless scalar fields and the tensor field of einstein gravity .",
    "scalar - tensor gravity theories are almost only possible alternatives to einstein gravity . moreover",
    ", scalar - tensor theories may supply a new approach to implementing the inflationary scenario ( called extended inflation ) @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the time - varying gravitational `` constant '' which is their distinctive feature slows the inflationary expansion from exponential to power - law in time , and then the inflationary epoch has finite period , thereby solving the so - called `` graceful exit '' problem .",
    "furthermore , scalar - tensor theories provide a natural framework of realizing the time - variation of fundamental constants ( gravitational constant ) via the dynamics of the brans - dicke dilaton ( for review see @xcite ) .    in the jordan - brans - dicke theory @xcite,@xcite ( hereafter",
    ", we refer to it as the brans - dicke theory for simplicity ) which is the simplest example of scalar - tensor theories , a constant parameter @xmath0 is introduced . in the limit @xmath1 , the gravitational constant can not change and einstein gravity is recovered .",
    "although scalar - tensor theories including the brans - dicke theory are compatible with einstein gravity in several aspects , they have many deviations from it .",
    "weak - field experimental tests in solar - system have constrained the post - newtonian deviation from einstein gravity , @xmath2 @xcite,@xcite .",
    "measurement of the signal time delay of millisecond pulsars or the light deflection of quasars may raise this limit @xcite .    in more general scalar - tensor theories , @xmath0 can vary depending on the scalar field . in cosmological models based on such theories ,",
    "it has been pointed out that there is generally an attractor mechanism that drives @xmath0 to @xmath3 in the late cosmological epochs @xcite .",
    "the nature of gravity can be significantly different in the early universe .",
    "hence , information on the different cosmological epochs may constrain such theories .",
    "a simple and natural extension of the brans - dicke theory to the attractor model is the harmonic attractor model in which the scalar field has a quadratic effective potential of a positive curvature in the einstein conformal frame .",
    "the analysis of big - bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) in this model @xcite restricts two parameters characterizing the potential ( its curvature @xmath4 and today s gradient @xmath5 ) .",
    "it is concluded that the bbn limit on the possible deviation from einstein gravity ( @xmath6 ) is much stronger than the present observational limits in large @xmath7 models . aside from bbn",
    ", we have another source of the information about the early universe that is the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) .",
    "the trace of primordial fluctuation can be seen clearly in the cmb anisotropy spectrum where the information on the early universe up to the last scattering time ( @xmath8 ) is integrated on the acoustic peaks .",
    "the precise cmb data which will be provided in near future @xcite,@xcite should further constrain the allowed parameter region . toward probing gravity theories by cmb data ,",
    "we examine the cosmological perturbation evolution in the context of scalar - tensor gravity theories .",
    "our primary goal is to clarify the growth process of perturbations in the scalar - tensor cosmology and understand the influence on the resultant observable power spectra .",
    "we also revisit the perturbations of the brans - dicke theory which has been investigated by several authors @xcite .",
    "although the contemporary plausible model is a vacuum dominated model , we adopt flat standard cdm ( scdm ) models for three reasons .",
    "the first reason is that the universe necessarily experiences matter domination once at least .",
    "therefore , we should begin by revealing the effect of the scalar - tensor gravity up to the matter - dominated epoch without confusing curvature or vacuum energy effect with it .",
    "the second reason is that the dependence of the scalar evolution on the matter density ( @xmath9 ) is quite simple as shown in section iv .",
    "the final reason is that , if we take account of the current constraint for @xmath10 , the attracting scalar - tensor gravity virtually becomes einstein gravity before vacuum domination and hence any extra process originating from the scalar - tensor gravity would not occur after vacuum domination .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section ii , the field equations and the background cosmological evolution equations in the scalar - tensor theory are described . in section iii , we present the cosmological perturbation theory based on the scalar - tensor gravity . we demonstrate the numerical calculations in section iv .",

    ", we obtain smaller initial @xmath12 . in the brans - dicke ( constant @xmath0 ) models ,",

    "the variability of @xmath12 is summarized as follows : @xmath133 the initial slope represents the ratio of matter energy density to radiation energy density .",
    "then , the motion of @xmath12 is negligible and does not affect the spacetime metric through either of the minimal and the non - minimal coupling .",
    "hence , the scalar - tensor gravity effectively behaves like einstein gravity and the only difference is the magnitude of the gravitational coupling `` constant '' .",

    "the analytic estimation is presented in appendix . before the horizon entry ,",
    "the scalar field fluctuation cumulates around the dense region and @xmath122 always grows .",
    "then , the amplitude is approximately proportional to the factor @xmath136 which regulates the nonminimal interaction . while , after the horizon entry , the field fluctuation flows out and its growth is suppressed",

    "immediately after the horizon entry , the contribution suddenly drops and becomes negligible .",
    "this potential drop at the horizon entry is the characteristic event caused by the scalar field fluctuation especially in the matter - dominated epoch during which the horizon entry does not involve the potential decay in the einstein model . because of the late time convergence to einstein gravity , large scale modes , as well as small scale modes which enter the horizon long before the equality time , are not affected by the scalar fluctuation in the attractor model .     on a scale @xmath141 mpc@xmath142 in the scalar - tensor models with scdm parameters .",

    "the metric evolution directly affects the evolution of matter perturbations .",
    "its evolution can be seen through the observations of the present matter structures .",
    "for example , the turnover scale in the matter power spectrum corresponds to the horizon scale at the equality time .",
    "cmb observations provide more detailed information about the gravity evolution .",
    "therefore , we pick up some scale modes which appear on the cmb anisotropy spectrum as the characteristic structure , namely the modes corresponding to the acoustic peaks .",
    "the evolution of the first and the second acoustic peak modes at the decoupling time is displayed in fig.[fig : psi_bd ] and fig.[fig : psi_st ] where the large scale limit modes are also compared for reference . the initial behavior is model independent because the scalar - tensor gravity behaves like einstein gravity . in the brans - dicke model ,",
    "the late time evolution , except for the horizon entry , is flat as discussed in appendix .",
    "also in the attractor model , the late time evolution gradually becomes flat because of the convergence to einstein gravity .",
    "the large scale limit mode especially is not affected by the difference in the horizon entry and its late time deviation is determined by @xmath136 . after the equality , the decay widths of peak modes at a time generally become smaller in the scalar - tensor models than those in the einstein model ( see e.g. the second peak mode in fig.[fig : psi_bd ] or fig.[fig : psi_st ] ) .",
    "we point out two reasons for it .",
    "one reason is that the non - relativistic matter amount ( @xmath111 ) is larger in the scalar - tensor models .",
    "the relative contribution of radiation to metric perturbations is smaller at the same @xmath149 and hence the decay caused by radiation pressure becomes smaller .",
    "the other reason is the motion of @xmath12 . as explained in fig.[fig : ills ] , if @xmath12 is constant , a peak mode in each model enters the horizon at the same time .",
    "however , since @xmath12 moves with time after the equality , the entry time of the peak mode in the scalar - tensor model is shifted to lower @xmath149 .",
    "this time lag also makes the decay width smaller .",
    "furthermore , during the early phase of potential decay ( approximately from the horizon entry up to the first maximum compression of photon fluid ) , the contribution of the scalar induced decay occurring coherently to the decay deriving from radiation pressure is not negligible .",
