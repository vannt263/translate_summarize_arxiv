    "agile was selected by asi ( 1997 december ) for a phase a study to be completed within the end of 1998 .",
    "the goal is to achieve an on - axis sensitivity comparable to that of egret on board of cgro ( a smaller background resulting from an improved angular resolution more than compensates the loss due to a smaller effective area ) and a better sensitivity for large off - axis angles ( up to @xmath2 ) .",

    "1 ( right panel ) shows the off - axis response to gamma - ray detection of agile and egret .",
    "we summarize here agile s scientific objectives .",
    "@xmath8 _ active galactic nuclei_. for the first time , simultaneous monitoring of a large number of agns per pointing will be possible .",
    "several outstanding issues concerning the mechanism of agn gamma - ray production and activity can be addressed by agile including : ( 1 ) the study of transient vs. low - level gamma - ray emission and duty - cycles ; ( 2 ) the relationship between the gamma - ray variability and the radio - optical - x - ray - tev emission ; ( 3 ) the correlation between relativistic radio plasmoid ejections and gamma - ray flares . a program for joint agile and ground - based monitoring observations is being planned . on the average",
    ", agile will achieve deep exposures of agns and substantially improve our knowledge on the low - level emission as well as detecting flares .",
    "we conservatively estimate that for a 3-year program agile will detect a number of agns 23 times larger than that of egret .",
    "a companion paper presents the impact of agile on the study of agns ( mereghetti et al .",
    "super - agile will monitor , for the first time , simultaneous agn emission in the gamma - ray and hard x - ray ranges .",
    "@xmath8 _ diffuse galactic and extragalactic emission_. the agile good angular resolution and large average exposure will further improve our knowledge of cosmic ray origin , propagation , interaction and emission processes .",
    "we also note that a joint study of gamma - ray emission from mev to tev energies is possible by special programs involving agile and new - generation tev observatories of improved angular resolution .",
    "@xmath8 _ gamma - ray pulsars_. will contribute to the study of gamma - ray pulsars in several ways : ( 1 ) improving photon statistics for gamma - ray period searches by dedicated observing programs with long observation times of 1 - 2 months per source ; ( 2 ) detecting possible secular fluctuations of the gamma - ray emission from neutron star magnetospheres ; ( 3 ) studying unpulsed gamma - ray emission from plerions in supernova remnants and searching for time variability of pulsar wind / nebula interactions , e.g. , as in the crab nebula ( de jager et al . , 1996 ) .",
    "@xmath8 _ galactic sources , new transients_. a large number of gamma - ray sources near the galactic plane are unidentified , and sources such as 2cg  135 + 1 or transients ( e.g. , gro  j1838 - 04 ) can be monitored on timescales of months / years . also galactic x - ray jet sources ( such as cyg x-3 , grs  1915 + 10 , gro  j1655 - 40 and others ) can produce detectable gamma - ray emission for favorable jet geometries , and a too program is planned to follow - up new discoveries of _ micro - quasars_.    @xmath8 _ gamma - ray bursts_. about ten grbs have been detected by egret s spark chamber during @xmath9 years of operations ( schneid et al . , 1996a ) .",
    "this number appears to be limited by the egret fov and sensitivity and not by the grb emission mechanism .",
    "grb detection rate by agile is expected to be a factor of @xmath10 larger than that of egret , i.e. , @xmath11510 events / year ) .",
    "the small agile deadtime ( @xmath12 times smaller than that of egret ) allows a better study of the initial phase of grb pulses ( for which egret response was in many cases inadequate ) . the remarkable discovery by egret of ` delayed ' gamma - ray emission up to @xmath13  gev from grb  940217 ( hurley et al . , 1994 )",
    "is of great importance to model burst acceleration processes .",
    "agile is expected to be highly efficient in detecting photons above 10  gev because of limited backscattering . super - agile will be able to locate grbs within a few arcminutes , and will systematically study the interplay between hard x - ray and gamma - ray emissions .",
    "@xmath8 _ solar flares_. during the last solar maximum , solar flares were discovered to produce prolonged high - intensity gamma - ray outbursts ( e.g. , schneid et al . , 1996b ) .",
    "agile will be operational during part of the next solar maximum and several solar flares may be detected .",
    "particularly important for analysis will be the flares simultaneously detected by agile and hessi ( sensitive in the band 20  kev20  mev ) .",
    "agile is planned to be integrated with a spacecraft of the mita class currently being developed by gavazzi space with the support of asi .",
    "agile s pointing is obtained by a three - axis stabilization system with an accuracy near 0.51 degree . pointing reconstruction reaching an accuracy of 12 arcmin",
    "is obtained by star trackers .",
    "the downlink telemetry rate is planned to be @xmath14 , and is adequate for agile and super - agile for a single contact per orbit .",
    "the ideal orbit is equatorial ( 550  650  km ) .",
    "the agile mission is being planned as an * observatory * open to the international scientific community .",
    "planning of pointed observations , quicklook and standard data analysis results will be available to the community through a guest observer program .",
    "the agile mission emphasizes a rapid response to the detection of gamma - ray transients .",
    "the agile science support group will help coordinating multiwavelength observations of gamma - ray sources , and will stimulate investigations of observational and theoretical nature on gamma - ray sources detected by agile ."
