    "since the celebrated camassa - holm ( ch ) equation was derived as a model for unidirectional motion of dispersive shallow - water by camassa and holm in 1993 @xcite , integrable pdes admitting peakons ( ch type equations ) have attracted much attention in recent years .",
    "two of the most famous equations are the ch equation and the degasperis - procesi ( dp ) equation , which are contained in the following one parameter family of pdes @xcite : @xmath0where @xmath1 is an arbitrary constant .",
    "when @xmath2 , the equation is the ch , which is completely integrable with a lax pair and a bi - hamiltonian structure given @xcite .",
    "the ch equation is solvable by inverse scattering transform @xcite and the associated algebro - geometric solutions are also discussed @xcite . and explicit formulas for the multi - peakon solutions of the ch equation are studied by the inverse spectral methods@xcite . moreover , it is connected with the negative kdv equation by a reciprocal transformation @xcite .",
    "when @xmath3 , the system ( [ ch ] ) is just the dp equation , which is discovered by the method of asymptotic integrability to isolate integrable third - order equations @xcite .",
    "indeed it may also be obtained by the theory of shallow water @xcite .",
    "the dp equation is connected to a negative flow in the kaup - kupershmidt hierarchy via a reciprocal transformation , and a lax pair of the equation is constructed by the relation . the bi - hamiltonian structure and the integrable finite - dimensional peakon dynamics for the dp equation are also studied in @xcite . furthermore , the research of explicit formulas for the multi - peakon solutions of the dp equation can be found in @xcite .    in the past two decades ,",
    "many other ch type equations are proposed and studied ( see e.g. @xcite and references ) .",
    "for example , the novikov equation @xcite @xmath4 is discovered by the method of symmetry classification .",
    "bi - hamiltonian structure and a lax pair for the novikov equation are given and it is shown to connect with a negative flow in the sawada - kotera hierarchy @xcite . and explicit formulas for multi - peakon solutions of it are obtained in @xcite .",
    "in addition , the geng - xue equation @xmath5is proposed as a generalization of the novikov equation @xcite .",
    "it is completely integrable with a lax pair and associated bi - hamiltonian structure as well as infinitely many conserved quantities@xcite .",
    "furthermore , a reciprocal transformation and explicit formulas for the multi - peakon of it are discussed in @xcite .",
    "the subject of this paper is a three - component ch type system proposed by geng and xue @xcite , i.e. @xmath6 where @xmath7which admits the following spectral problem @xmath8 bi - hamiltonian structure as well as infinite many conserved quantities and the dynamical system for the @xmath9-peakon solutions of this system are discussed in@xcite .",
    "it is interesting that the spectral problem ( [ thr2 ] ) for this 3-component model may be reduced to which of the ch equation and the geng - xue equation , and bi - hamiltonian structures of the two equations can also be obtained by reductions for bi - hamiltonian structure of the system ( [ gengxue3 ] ) .",
    "we are intrigued about the reciprocal transformation of this system , because it turns out that the spectral problem ( [ thr2 ] ) for the 3-component system ( [ gengxue3 ] ) is gauge link to a spectral problem of a second three - component ch type system constructed by us in @xcite , however , the reciprocal transformation ( more precisely , liouville transformation ) on our 3-component ch type system ca nt be applied to the system ( [ gengxue3 ] ) @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to construct a reciprocal transformation for the 3-component system ( [ gengxue3 ] ) .",
    "the results show that the transformed system is linked to a negative flow in a 3-component extension to the mkdv hierarchy .",
    "it is easy to find that the spectral problem ( [ thr2 ] ) is reduced to which of the ch equation in the condition @xmath10 , and reduced to which of the geng - xue equation as @xmath11 .",
    "meanwhile , we note that bi - hamiltonian structure of the 3-component system is written as @xmath12where @xmath13with @xmath14and @xmath15dx , \\\\",
    "h_0 & = & \\int [ v+ur_x ] dx.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] direct calculations show that the compatible hamiltonian operators for the ch and the geng - xue may be obtained by the reduction of the hamiltonian pair in ( [ biham1 ] ) in the case of @xmath10 and @xmath11 respectively . besides it is easy to find that the hamiltonian pair and a spectral problem for the novikov hierarchy can also be obtained when @xmath16 .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that a lax pair of the 3-component system ( [ gengxue3 ] ) is given by the spectral problem ( [ thr2 ] ) and associated auxiliary problem @xmath17based on this lax pair , infinitely many conservation laws for the 3-component system ( [ gengxue3 ] ) have been constructed@xcite .",
    "specially , one of them is @xmath18which defines a reciprocal transformation @xmath19    in what follows , the 3-component ch system ( [ gengxue3 ] ) with the lax pair ( [ thr2]-[tpart ] ) under the reciprocal transformation ( [ rt1 ] ) will be shown .",
    "writing the column vector @xmath20 in components as @xmath21 and eliminating @xmath22 in the spectral problem ( [ thr2 ] ) , we find @xmath23under the reciprocal transformation ( [ rt1 ] ) and after the gauge transformation @xmath24 , the above spectral problem is transformed to @xmath25using the method of factorizing the lax operator @xcite , we arrive at the following spectral problem : @xmath26where @xmath27 with @xmath28 and @xmath29 it is worth to note that many choices for the transformed spectral problems are tried here but failed since the variable @xmath30 is lost in the time part of the lax pairs corresponding to the transformed spectral problems .",
    "the transformed spectral problem ( [ tranlax1 ] ) can be reduced to which of the mkdv hierarchy as @xmath31 and we call the associated hierarchy a generalized mkdv hierarchy .    furthermore , taking similar procedure",
    "as before and through tedious calculations , we get the auxiliary problem corresponding to the spectral problem ( [ tranlax1 ] ) , that is @xmath32where @xmath33and @xmath34,\\\\ & & g=-(\\partial_y-2q_1)^{-1}2.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] then the compatible condition of the lax pair ( [ tranlax1]-[tranlax2 ] ) yields just the transformed system @xmath35where @xmath36 consequently , the 3-component ch type system ( [ gengxue3 ] ) and the lax pair ( [ thr2]-[tpart ] ) are transformed to ( [ treqq ] ) and ( [ tranlax1]-[tranlax2 ] ) respectively .",
    "in this section , we will discuss the bi - hamiltonian structure of the generalized mkdv hierarchy .",
    "one may note that in @xcite a generalized kdv hierarchy is proposed associated with a 3 @xmath37 3 matrix spectral problem @xmath38which may be transformed to a spectral problem of yajima - oikawa hierarchy ( see e.g. @xcite ) or a sepctral problem associated with a energy - dependent lax operator ( example 4.1 in @xcite ) by two gauge transformations respectively . by writing the column vector @xmath39 in components and comparing it with the similar result of ( [ tranlax1 ] )",
    ", we find the relation of the three potentials in the two system is related as @xmath40 bi - hamiltonian structure of the generalized kdv hierarchy associated with the spectral problem ( [ ipsp ] ) is given without a proof , since the original expression of it is tedious , and we rewrite the hamiltonian pair of it as @xmath41 through the relation ( [ rela1 ] ) , we may get the compatible hamiltonian operators and associated hamiltonian functions for the generalized mkdv hierarchy associated with the spectral problem ( [ tranlax1 ] ) .",
    "since the method of trace identity hasnt been taken , we only give the hamiltonian pair here .",
    "the generalized mkdv hierarchy associated with the spectral problem ( [ tranlax1 ] ) has a pair of hamiltonian operators @xmath42where @xmath43 proof : in order to prove the theorem , we need to show the two operators @xmath44 and @xmath45 are hamiltonian operators and they constitute a compatible pair .",
