    "for example , two families of such compounds read acu(pba)(h@xmath3o)@xmath4nh@xmath3o and acu(pbaoh)(h@xmath3o)@xmath4nh@xmath3o , where pba = 1,3-propylenebis ( oxamato ) , pbaoh = 2-hydroxo-1,3-propylenebis ( oxamato ) , and a = ni , fe , co , and mn . published experimental work implies that the magnetic properties of these mixed - spin materials are basically described by a quantum heisenberg spin model with antiferromagnetically coupled nearest - neighbor localized spins : @xmath5\\cdot { \\bf s}_2(n)\\nonumber \\\\ & -&\\mu_bh\\sum_{n = 1}^{n}\\left [ g_1s_1^{z}(n ) + g_2s_2^{z}(n)\\right],\\hspace{0.1 cm } j>0\\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here the integers @xmath6 number the @xmath7 elementary cells , each of them containing two site spins with quantum numbers @xmath8 . the @xmath9-factors , related to the spins @xmath10 and @xmath11 ,",
    "are denoted by @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "@xmath14 is the bohr magneton , and @xmath15 is the external uniform magnetic field applied along the @xmath16 direction . as an example , the following values for the parameters in eq .",
    "( [ ham ] ) have been extracted from magnetic measurements on the recently synthesized quasi-1d bimetallic compound nicu(pba)(d@xmath3o)@xmath42d@xmath3o : @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20.@xcite in view of the recent developments in the physics of uniform quasi-1d systems ( concerning , in particular , the behavior of antiferromagnetic chains and ladders in external magnetic fields : see , e.g. , ref .   and",
    "references therein ) , ferrimagnetic chains and ladders open an interesting new area .",
    "the point is that the presence of two or more different quantum spins in the elementary cell considerably increases the number of situations of interest : the topology of spin arrangements plays an essential role in the structure of the ground state and low - energy excitations.@xcite for example , the diamond lattice in fig .",
    "[ chains ] represents another interesting class of heisenberg ferrimagnetic chains constructed of one kind of antiferromagnetically coupled site spins but with a different number of lattice sites in the @xmath21 and @xmath22 sublattices.@xcite it is remarkable that only in the last few years interest in the physical properties of 1d quantum heisenberg ferrimagnets has considerably increased:@xcite most of the early efforts were concentrated on the chemistry of molecular magnets and a relatively small amount of work was devoted to physical properties.@xcite    since interactions in the models presented in fig .  [ chains ] set up bipartite lattices , the lieb - mattis theorem@xcite is applicable .",
    "in particular , for the mixed - spin system it predicts the existence of a ferrimagnetic ground state with the total - spin quantum number @xmath23 .",
    "thus the model ( [ ham ] ) exhibits long - range ordered magnetic ground state characterized by the magnetization density @xmath24 , @xmath25 being the lattice constant .",
    "such a magnetic phase may be referred to as _ a quantized unsaturated ferromagnetic phase _ : it is characterized by both the quantized ferromagnetic order parameter @xmath26 ( quantized in integral or half - integral multiples of the number of elementary cells , @xmath27 ) and the macroscopic sublattice magnetizations @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "what makes such a state and the related transitions to magnetically disordered states interesting is the fact that the ferromagnetic order parameter is a conserved quantity : in heisenberg systems this is expected to imply strong constraints on the critical behavior.@xcite consequences of the spontaneous symmetry breaking @xmath30 ( related to the establishment of a ferrimagnetic ground state ) for the structure of low - energy excitations are dictated by the nonrelativistic version of goldstone s theorem@xcite : in the absence of long - range forces , a spontaneous symmetry breaking leads to low - energy excitations whose energy tends to zero for wave - vectors @xmath31 .",
    "in contrast to the relativistic version , the theorem does neither specify the exact form of the dispersion relation for small @xmath32 , nor does it determine the number of different goldstone modes : these features are not fixed by symmetry considerations alone  rather , they depend on the specific properties of the system .",
    "turning to the case of heisenberg ferromagnets , in a hydrodynamic description the quadratic form of the magnon energies @xmath33 results entirely from the symmetry of the ferromagnetic state and the fact that the order parameter is itself a constant of the motion.@xcite here @xmath34 and @xmath1 are , respectively , the magnetization density and the spin - stiffness constant of the heisenberg ferromagnet .",
    "this form of the goldstone modes ( which is just the landau - lifshitz formula ) can rigorously be obtained by simple sum - rule arguments ( see , e.g. , ref . ) .",
    "similar arguments are applicable to heisenberg ferrimagnets as well.@xcite an alternative approach , relying on the suggested conformal invariance of the model ( [ ham ] ) , also predicts the quadratic form of eq .",
    "( [ ll]).@xcite due to the doubling of elementary cell in the ferrimagnetic ground state , there appears a second spin - wave branch in the ferrimagnetic case ( optical magnons ) with a finite energy gap @xmath2 at @xmath35 : @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the magnetic susceptibility parallel to @xmath38.@xcite at intermediate temperatures , it is the optical magnon branch which produces a number of specific thermodynamic properties characteristic especially for the ferrimagnetic systems .",
    "@xcite    the existence of a macroscopic magnetic ground state also opens an interesting and rare opportunity to apply the spin - wave theory ( swt ) to the low - dimensional quantum spin system ( [ ham ] ) .",
    "indeed , recently published analysis based on the linear spin - wave approximation @xcite qualitatively confirmed the expected structure of low - energy excitations in heisenberg ferrimagnets .",
    "the second - order swt was shown@xcite to produce precise quantitative results for the ground - state energy @xmath39 and the on - site magnetizations @xmath40 and @xmath41 even for the extreme quantum system @xmath42 : the second - order swt results differ by less than @xmath43 for @xmath39 , and by less than @xmath44 for @xmath45 , from the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) estimates.@xcite in this respect , an interesting question is to what extend the spin - wave approach can effectively be used to describe the properties of the 1d model ( [ ham ] ) at zero temperature .",
    "a purpose of the present paper is to demonstrate , through an explicit study of the magnon - dispersion perturbation series , that the spin - wave approach can produce precise quantitative results for the magnon dispersions as well .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , using the dayson - maleev boson representation of spin operators , the original spin hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) is transformed to an equivalent boson hamiltonian .",
    "the choice of an appropriate zeroth - order quadratic hamiltonian for the perturbation series is also discussed here . in section 3",
    "we study the second - order corrections for the magnon energies and the related corrections for the spin - stiffness constant and the optical magnon gap .",
    "third - order self - energy diagrams and the respective corrections for the optical magnon gap are also considered here . in the last section",
    "the results are summarized and a comparison with available numerical estimates is made .",
    "to develop a spin - wave theory ( see , e.g. , refs .   and references therein ) , one firstly transforms the original spin hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) to an equivalent boson hamiltonian .",

    "is not the most appropriate choice of a starting zeroth - order approximation for perturbation series .",
    "since we are also interested in systems with small site spins , it is more appropriate from the very beginning to redefine @xmath75 by adding the first - order @xmath76 corrections to magnon dispersions.@xcite the latter corrections come entirely from a normal ordering of the quasiparticle boson operators @xmath70 and @xmath71 in the quartic interaction @xmath68 .",
    "it is important that these corrections ( similar to oguchi s corrections in antiferromagnets@xcite ) renormalize the magnon excitation spectra ( and the ground - state energy ) without changing their basic structure , i.e. , the number of goldstone modes . unlike the case of heisenberg antiferromagnets ,",
