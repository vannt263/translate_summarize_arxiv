    "the physics of heavy fermion behaviour in pr - compounds is very different from that in ce - compounds . while in ce - compounds the heavy fermion behaviour has its origin in kondo effect , in pr - compounds it is realized either due to the quadrupolar kondo effect as in prinag@xmath0 @xcite or due to the excitonic mass enhancement as observed in pros@xmath9sb@xmath10 @xcite .",

    "realizing that the pr - based compounds can also present extraordinary magnetic and superconducting properties we have started working on these systems with an objective of finding novel pr - compounds and explore the interplay of magnetism and superconductivity in them . in order to achieve the destined goal we are investigating pr@xmath0t@xmath1ge@xmath2 compounds ( t = transition elements ) in view of interesting features of their ce - analogs .",

    "a similar favourable situation also exists in the case of our compound pr@xmath0pd@xmath1ge@xmath2 which consists of layers of pr - atoms separated by pd - ge network in _ ibam_-structure .",
    "therefore as in the case of r@xmath0ni@xmath1si@xmath2 ( r= tb , sm , nd ) , the large positive gmr in pr@xmath0pd@xmath1ge@xmath2 may be speculated to arise from the layered nature of structure .",

    "extremely large value of magnetoresistance ( resistance decreases by a factor of 200 ) was also found in hgcr@xmath0se@xmath9 which is caused by magnetic field induced changes in the carrier mobility and concentration @xcite .",

    "that the ground state is a singlet separated by 12 k from the first excited is further supported from the fact that magnetic entropy attains a value of rln(2 ) at 10 k ( inset of figure 6 ) .",
    "the temperature dependence of magnetic entropy also reveals the significant contribution from higher excited states , e.g. an increased value of magnetic entropy over rln(3 ) at 40 k in the magnetic entropy is due to the contribution from the levels above 40 k. further a constant difference in the specific heats of pr@xmath0rh@xmath1ge@xmath2 and la@xmath0rh@xmath1ge@xmath2 , which starts appearing above 25 k , is an indication of the involvement of closely spaced excited states .",
    "from such a behaviour of the specific heat we can suggest that in this case possibly the crystal field removes the nine fold degeneracy of pr@xmath19 by splitting them into nine singlets which is expected in the orthorhombic environment .",

    "the resistivity data of la@xmath0rh@xmath1ge@xmath2 exhibit a very broad curvature around 150 k possibly due to the band effects together with a residual resistivity of @xmath7 39 @xmath28-cm ( at 2 k ) and a residual resistivity ratio of 9 .",
    "a considerable departure from the linear temperature dependence is also observed in resistivity of pr@xmath0rh@xmath1ge@xmath2 on account of crystal field effects and/or band structure effects .",
    "the value of residual resistivity at 2 k is @xmath7 58 @xmath28-cm with the residual resistivity ratio of 11 .",
    "the large residual resistivity is possibly due to the presence of ( micro)cracks in the sample . in spite of the large residual resistivity in the sample we made an attempt to extract the physics content in the data . the data at low temperature ( below 4 k ) fits to @xmath34 ( t ) = @xmath30 + at@xmath21 with a = 0.25874 @xmath28-cm / k@xmath21 .",
    "this corresponds to a/@xmath37 = 3.94 x 10@xmath16 @xmath38-cm - k@xmath21-mole@xmath21-j@xmath39 which is larger than the universal value of kadowaki - woods ratio expected for the ce - based kondo lattice / heavy fermion compounds @xcite .",
    "further , the wilson ratio r@xmath40 = 23.31 using the value of @xmath13 = 0.10641 emu / pr - mole at 2 k ( b = 0.1 t ) and @xmath6 = 81 mj / mole - pr - k@xmath21 is also large similar to the case of non - fermi - liquid heavy fermion compound ybrh@xmath0si@xmath0 which is situated very close to the quantum critical point in which large wilson ratio is attributed to the presence of ferromagnetic fluctuations @xcite .",
    "since the results obtained for pr@xmath0rh@xmath1ge@xmath2 are in the same range of the values which are obtained for ce- and yb - based heavy fermion systems , pr@xmath0rh@xmath1ge@xmath2 is a new heavy fermion system .",
    "since the electrical resistivity and specific heat data of pr@xmath0rh@xmath1ge@xmath2 do not show any signature of kondo effect , the mechanism for the heavy fermion behavior in pr@xmath0rh@xmath1ge@xmath2 is not the usual kondo effect , rather , the heavy fermion behavior results from the low lying crystal field levels by the inelastic scattering of conduction electrons with the excited levels usually referred as excitonic mass enhancement .",
    "the theory of excitonic mass enhancement was initially proposed by white and fulde to explain the mass enhancement of pr metal @xcite and has been recently applied to explain the origin of heavy fermion behaviour in pros@xmath9sb@xmath10 @xcite .",
    "there are two intrinsic requirements for the excitonic mass enhancement  the ground state must be a singlet and the splitting energy between the ground state and the first excited state must be low  to develop a heavy fermion state . for our system",
    "pr@xmath0rh@xmath1ge@xmath2 both the requirements are fulfilled  the ground state is nonmagnetic singlet and first excited state lies at 12 k  hence pr@xmath0rh@xmath1ge@xmath2 is a new heavy fermion system that validates the theory of excitonic mass enhancement .",
