    "recall that a _ matching _ on a set @xmath0 is a collection of pairwise disjoint subsets of @xmath0 of size two . using terminology from graph theory",
    ", we refer to a subset of size two as an _ edge on @xmath0_. the _ matching complex _",
    "@xmath1 is the family of matchings on the set @xmath2 .",
    "since @xmath1 is closed under deletion of edges , @xmath1 is an abstract simplicial complex .    despite its simple definition ,",
    "the topology of @xmath1 remains a mystery .",
    "its rational simplicial homology is well - known and has been computed by bouc @xcite and others @xcite , but the integral homology is known only in special cases . specifically , the bottom nonvanishing homology group of @xmath1 is known to be an elementary @xmath18-group for almost all @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "in fact , there is a nearly complete characterization of all @xmath22 such that the homology group @xmath19 contains elements of order @xmath18 @xcite ; see proposition  [ kr - prop ] ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) for a summary . as for the existence of elements of order @xmath3 for primes different from @xmath18",
    ", nothing is known besides the recent discovery @xcite that @xmath23 contains elements of order @xmath5 .",
    "computers have not been able to tell us much more about the homology of @xmath1 .",
    "a complete description is known only for @xmath24 ; already for @xmath25 , there are too many cells in @xmath1 to allow for a direct homology computation , at least with the existing software .",
    "the goal of this paper is to cut @xmath1 into smaller pieces and then use a computer to search for torsion in the homology of those pieces . via this technique , we come fairly close to a complete description of the homology of @xmath1 for @xmath26 . moreover , and maybe more importantly , for each of the primes @xmath5 , @xmath9 , @xmath14 , and @xmath16 , we find new values of @xmath10 such that the homology of @xmath1 contains elements of order @xmath3 .",
    "* first , we split the chain complex @xmath27 of @xmath1 into smaller pieces with the property that the homology of @xmath1 is isomorphic to the direct sum of the homology of the smaller complexes , except that the sylow @xmath28-subgroups of the torsion part may differ . using this splitting technique , we determine the @xmath18- and @xmath5-ranks of the homology of @xmath1 for @xmath29 . here",
    ", we define the @xmath3-rank of an abelian group to be the rank of the sylow @xmath3-subgroup of the torsion part of the group .",
    "* second , we use a similar technique to produce even smaller pieces .",
    "while it does not seem to be possible to compute the entire homology of @xmath1 from these pieces , we may still deduce useful information about the existence of elements of order @xmath3 for various primes @xmath3 .",
    "specifically , our computations show that there are elements of order @xmath5 in @xmath30 for @xmath31 , in @xmath32 for @xmath33 , and in @xmath34 .",
    "this turns out to imply that there are elements of order @xmath5 in the homology of @xmath1 whenever @xmath35 , @xmath36 , or @xmath6 . moreover , there are elements of order @xmath9 in @xmath37 for @xmath38 and in @xmath39 , elements of order @xmath14 in @xmath40 , and elements of order @xmath16 in @xmath41 .      based on our computations ,",
    "we derive conjectures about the existence of elements of order @xmath3 in the homology of @xmath1 for arbitrary odd primes @xmath3 .",
    "for example , the above data suggest that there are elements of order @xmath3 in the homology of @xmath42 for any odd prime @xmath3 .",
    "let us explain the underlying method in some detail .",
    "for a given group @xmath43 acting on the simplicial chain complex @xmath27 of @xmath1 , let @xmath44 be the subgroup of the chain group @xmath45 consisting of all sums @xmath46 such that @xmath47 .",
    "as long as the order of @xmath43 is not a multiple of a given prime @xmath3 , the homology of the subcomplex does not contain elements of order @xmath3 unless the homology of @xmath1 contains elements of order @xmath3 ; see section  [ genconstr - sec ] .",
    "in particular , if we indeed detect elements of order @xmath3 in the subcomplex , then we can deduce that the homology of @xmath1 also contains elements of order @xmath3 .    to give an example ,",
    "we first introduce some notation . for a sequence @xmath48 of nonnegative integers summing to @xmath10 ,",
    "let @xmath49 be the young group @xmath50 .",
    "given a set partition @xmath51 of @xmath2 such that @xmath52 for @xmath53 , we obtain a natural action on @xmath27 by letting @xmath54 act on @xmath55 in the natural manner for each @xmath56 ; for a group element @xmath57 , the action is given by replacing the edge @xmath58 with the edge @xmath59 for each choice of distinct elements @xmath60 .    in section  [ lambdascc - sec ] , we demonstrate that @xmath61 is isomorphic to the chain complex of a certain simplicial complex @xmath62 .",
    "the vertices of this complex are all edges and loops on @xmath63 ; a loop is a multiset of the form @xmath64 ) .",
    "a collection of edges and loops is a face of @xmath62 if and only if the total number of occurrences of the element @xmath56 in the edges and loops is at most @xmath65 for @xmath66 . by a computer - based result due to andersen @xcite , @xmath67 is a cyclic group of order five . as a consequence ,",
    "the following is true .",
    "the proof @xcite of proposition  [ matchtor - prop ] uses a definition of @xmath61 that differs slightly from the one given above . as alluded to earlier , we present a computer - free proof of the proposition in section  [ m14-sec ] .              to prove the theorem , we consider various actions of the young group @xmath49 on the chain complex of @xmath1 for certain choices of @xmath48 .",
    "specifically , for each sequence @xmath73 of signs , we obtain an action given by @xmath74 where @xmath75 and @xmath76 . here",
    ", @xmath77 denotes the symmetric group @xmath54 , viewed as the group of permutations on the set @xmath55 . whenever we refer to an action on @xmath1 as being induced by the pair @xmath78 , we mean this action .",
    "for clarity , we will often write the pair in matrix form as @xmath79 if all @xmath80 are equal to @xmath81 , then the action is simply @xmath82 .",
    "we refer to this action as the _ natural signed action _ and the action @xmath83 as the _ natural unsigned action_.    to prove ( i ) and ( ii ) in theorem  [ 5tor - thm ] , we split the chain complexes into many small pieces using the actions defined in ( [ youngaction - eq ] ) for the group @xmath84 for @xmath85 and @xmath86 , respectively . for the proof of ( iii ) , we consider the natural signed action of certain young groups @xmath49 on the chain complex of @xmath1 . in some cases ,",
    "we need to pick an even larger group whose elements permute not only the elements within each @xmath55 but also the sets @xmath55 themselves .",
    "we describe this construction in greater detail in section  [ wreath - sec ] .",
    "it is important to stress that the choice of signs has a significant impact on the homology of the resulting piece . for many of the choices of @xmath87 used for proving theorem  [ 5tor - thm ] ,",
    "the piece resulting from the natural _ signed _ action of @xmath49 contains plenty of elements of order @xmath5 , whereas the piece resulting from the _ unsigned _ action of @xmath49 does not contain any such elements at all .",
    "the homology groups @xmath32 and @xmath94 contain elements of order @xmath5 for each @xmath93 .",
    "thus the homology of @xmath1 contains elements of order @xmath5 for all @xmath6 and for @xmath95 and @xmath36 .",
    "[ m19 + 2u - thm ]    we do not know whether proposition  [ further5-prop ] can be extended to include @xmath96 . in particular , we can not tell whether @xmath30 contains elements of order @xmath5 for @xmath97 , though we do conjecture that this is the case .",
