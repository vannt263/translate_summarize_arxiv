    "it is well - known that the ( co - moving ) space densities of the rarest , most powerful quasars and radio galaxies were much higher at epochs corresponding to @xmath1 than they are now ( longair 1966 ) .",
    "the behaviour of the space density beyond these redshifts is the subject of this paper .",
    "dunlop & peacock ( 1990 ) found evidence for a ` redshift cut - off ' ( a decline in the co - moving space density ) in the distribution of flat - spectrum radio sources over the redshift range @xmath2 . through failing to find any flat - spectrum radio quasars at @xmath3 in a large ( @xmath440 per cent of the sky ) survey ,",
    "shaver et al ( 1996 , hereafter sh96 ) argued for an order - of - magnitude drop in space density between @xmath5 and @xmath6 , for this class of object .",
    "as emphasised by sh96 , the crucial advantage of any radio - selected survey is that with sufficient optical follow - up , it can be made free of optical selection effects , such as increasing dust obscuration at high redshift .",
    "it is chiefly for this reason that the work of sh96 provides the most convincing evidence to date for the existence of an intrinsic decline in the co - moving space density of any galaxy class at very high redshift .",
    "we adopt a parameterisation of the rlf which is separable in 151-mhz luminosity @xmath7 and redshift @xmath8 with a single power - law in @xmath7 of the form @xmath9 .",
    "we consider two cosmologies @xmath10 , @xmath11 ( cosmology i ) and @xmath12 , @xmath13 ( cosmology ii ) .",
    "model a parameterises the redshift distribution as a single power - law of the form @xmath14 . for model",
    "b the redshift distribution is parameterised as a gaussian , giving an overall expression for the co - moving space density of @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the normalising term and power - law exponent respectively , @xmath18 is the gaussian peak redshift and @xmath19 is the characteristic width of the gaussian .",
    "model c is described by the same model up to @xmath18 beyond which it becomes constant .",
    "for sources in the top - decade in luminosity of the @xmath20 plane ( fig.1 ) our parametric fitting and likelihood analysis of model radio luminosity functions ( table 1 ) show that the data are inconsistent with a @xmath21 power - law in redshift ( model a ) , but are well fitted by both models b and c. these models are shown in fig.@xmath22 in the form of a log@xmath23 / log@xmath24 plot .",
    "we conclude that although the relative likelihood for model b is @xmath25 times larger than for model c , this is not statistically significant enough to distinguish between the two models with any confidence .",
    "this uncertainty is further compounded by the effects of assuming a mean spectral index in the model fitting .",
    "this result is in very close agreement with the rlfs for radio loud quasars modelled by willott et al ( 1998 ) and various studies of agn at optical ( irwin et al 1991 ) and x - ray ( hasinger et al 1998 ) wavelengths .",
    "this is in apparent contradiction to the findings of sh96 for flat - spectrum quasars .",
    "if the relationship between the flat- and steep - spectrum populations is as described by unification models of agn then we might expect to see similar evolution in the two populations .",
    "thus to determine the co - moving space density of radio sources at high - redshift , an understanding of the spectral index trends , @xmath26corrections and associated selection effects must first be achieved .",
    "fig.@xmath22 also illustrates the contribution of powerful sources at high redshift to the total source count in a low - frequency survey .",
    "we see that even for the no cut - off model ( model c ) the fractional contribution is very small .",
    "this may render the location of the redshift cut - off virtually impossible to determine until the selection effects associated with radio surveys are fully understood .",
