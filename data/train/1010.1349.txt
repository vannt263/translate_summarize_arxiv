    "the modified newtonian dynamics ( mond ) @xcite is a successful alternative framework for interpreting the galactic rotation curves and the empirical tully - fisher relation without relying on dark matter halos ( see  @xcite for a review ) . at the non - relativistic level , the best modified - gravity formulation of mond is the modified poisson equation originally proposed by @xcite , @xmath1 = -4\\pi g \\rho\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath2 is the density of ordinary ( baryonic ) matter , @xmath3 is the gravitational potential , @xmath4 is the gravitational field and @xmath5 its ordinary euclidean norm .",
    "the modification of the poisson equation is encoded in the mond function @xmath0 of the single argument @xmath6 , where @xmath7 denotes the mond constant acceleration scale .",
    "the mond function interpolates between the mond regime corresponding to weak gravitational fields @xmath8 , for which it behaves as @xmath9 , and the newtonian strong - field regime @xmath10 , where @xmath11 reduces to @xmath12 so that we recover the usual newtonian gravity .",
    "relativistic extensions of mond modifying general relativity have been proposed @xcite and extensively studied ( see  @xcite for a review ) . alternatively the mond equation   can be reinterpreted as a modification of dark matter rather than gravity by invoking a mechanism of `` gravitational polarisation ''  a gravitational analogue of the electric polarisation @xcite ; this yields to the concept of dipolar dark matter which has been formulated as a relativistic model in standard general relativity by @xcite .",
    "an important consequence of the non - linearity of eq .   in the mond regime , is that the gravitational dynamics of a system is influenced ( besides the well - known tidal force ) by the external gravitational environment in which the system is embedded .",
    "this is known as the external field effect ( efe ) , which has non - trivial implications for non - isolated gravitating systems .",
    "the efe was conjectured to explain the dynamics of open star clusters in our galaxy @xcite , since they do not show evidence of dark matter despite the involved weak internal accelerations ( i.e. below @xmath13 ) .",
    "the efe effect shows that the dynamics of these systems should actually be newtonian as a result of their immersion in the gravitational field of the milky way .",
    "the efe is a rigorous prediction of the bekenstein - milgrom equation , and is best exemplified by the asymptotic behaviour of the solution of far from a localised matter distribution ( say , the solar system ) , in the presence of a constant external gravitational field @xmath14 ( the field of the milky way ) . at large distances",
    "@xmath15 we have @xcite @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the mass of the localised matter distribution , where @xmath18 is the azimuthal angle from the direction of the external field @xmath14 ( see also fig .  [",
    "f : setting ] ) , and where we denote @xmath19 and @xmath20 , with @xmath21 and @xmath22 . in the presence of the external field ,",
    "the mond internal potential @xmath23 shows a newtonian - like fall - off @xmath24 at large distances but with an effective gravitational constant @xmath25 . , showing that there is no escape velocity from an isolated system @xcite .",
    "however since no object is truly isolated the asymptotic behaviour of the potential is always given by , in the approximation where the external field is constant .",
    "] however , contrary to the newtonian case , it exhibits a non - spherical deformation along the direction of the external field .",
    "the fact that the external field @xmath14 does not disappear from the internal dynamics can be interpreted as a violation of the strong version of the equivalence principle .",
    ", remains satisfied @xcite .",
    "] for the reader s convenience we derive the result in the appendix  [ appa ] .    in a recent paper",
    ", @xcite has shown that the imprint of the external galactic field @xmath14 on the solar system ( due to a violation of the strong equivalence principle ) shows up not only asymptotically , but also in the inner regions of the system , where it may have implications for the motion of planets .",
    "this is somewhat unexpected because gravity is strong there ( we have @xmath26 ) and the dynamics should be newtonian . however , because of the special properties of the equation , the solution will be given by some modified poisson - type integral , and the dynamics in the strong - field region will be affected by the anomalous behaviour in the asymptotic weak - field region . thus the results apply only to the nonlinear poisson equation , not to modified inertia formulations of mond .",
    "the anomaly expresses itself as an anomalous quadrupolar contribution to the mondian internal field @xmath27 , as compared to the newtonian potential , given by @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the distance from the solar system barycentre , and @xmath30 is a trace - free quadrupole moment of the type @xmath31 with @xmath32 being the quadrupole coefficient and @xmath33 the preferred direction of the galactic centre ( i.e. @xmath34 ) .",
    "the anomalous term is a harmonic solution of the laplace equation , i.e. @xmath35 .    the radial dependence of this anomaly is @xmath36 and can thus be separated from a quadrupolar deformation due to the sun s oblateness which decreases like @xmath37 .",
    "this result is valid whenever @xmath38 is much less than the mond transition distance for the solar system , defined by @xmath39 with @xmath17 the mass of the sun and @xmath13 the mond acceleration scale .",
    "this radius corresponds to the transition region where the newtonian acceleration becomes of the order of the mond acceleration @xmath13 and therefore , mond effects become dominant .",
    "we have @xmath40 so the effect  is valid in a large volume around the sun including all the planets ( recall that neptune s orbit is at @xmath41 ) .",
    "in addition to we have also the usual mond effect . in the special case of spherical symmetry",
    ", the equation reduces to @xmath42 , with @xmath43 the ordinary newtonian gravitational field . for a mond function behaving like @xmath44 when @xmath45 ( i.e. in the region @xmath46 ) , the newtonian field is modified by @xmath47 . for @xmath48",
    "this corresponds to a constant acceleration similar to the pioneer anomaly , and for @xmath49 the effect is very small and the motion of planets is almost unaffected .",
    "this effect is independent of the presence of the external field , and is spherical , so can be distinguished from the quadrupolar deformation induced by the external field ; we neglect this effect here .",
    "in the present paper we shall confirm the existence of the effect  and shall derive it by an independent numerical integration of the equation   using an elliptic solver originally built for numerical relativity purposes .",
    "the magnitude of the quadrupole coefficient @xmath32 depends on the dimensionless ratio between the external field @xmath50 and the mond acceleration @xmath13 , say @xmath51 and on the particular mond interpolating function @xmath11 in use . for the milky way field at the level of the sun we have @xmath52 which happens to be slightly above the mond scale , i.e. @xmath53 .",
    "our calculation implemented for various standard choices for the @xmath11-function gives @xmath54 the quadrupole coefficient @xmath32 is found to be positive corresponding to a prolate elongation along the quadrupolar axis .",
    "we shall verify numerically that @xmath32 is indeed constant over a large portion of the inner solar system , and starts decreasing when the distance becomes comparable to the mond transition scale @xmath55 , at a few thousands au from the sun .",
    "we shall also check that @xmath32 scales approximately like the inverse square root of the central mass , in agreement with dimensional analysis which shows that we should approximately have @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is a dimensionless quadrupole coefficient depending on the ratio @xmath58 between the external field and the mond acceleration .",
    "we find that for @xmath53 , @xmath59 ranges over @xmath60 , in good agreement with the values found by @xcite .",
    "we then study some consequences of the anomalous quadrupole moment for the motion of planets , notably the secular advances of planetary perihelia . applying standard perturbation equations of celestial mechanics",
    "we obtain the anomalous precession rate @xmath61\\,.\\ ] ] to simplify , we have assumed that the direction of the galactic centre lies in the plane of the ecliptic ( this is only approximately correct ) and that all planets move in this plane .",
    "we defined the origin of the precession angle @xmath62 to be the direction of the galactic centre .",
    "the orbital frequency of the planet is @xmath63 ( @xmath64 is the orbital period ) , and @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 denote the standard orbital elements .",
    "the effect seems to be the most interesting for saturn for which we find @xmath68 those values are within the range of published residuals for the precession of saturn as obtained from global fits of the solar system dynamics in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however we shall find that in the case of the earth the predicted perihelion precession may be greatly constrained by the best estimates of postfit residuals obtained thanks to the jupiter vlbi data using the inpop planetary ephemerides @xcite .",
    "this is turn reduces the possible choices for the mond function @xmath0 to those that exhibit a sharp transition from the newtonian to mondian regime .    to conclude",
    ", we present very accurate numerical computations performed within the well - defined theory , and compare the results with recent observations of the motion of planets in the solar system .",
    "we find that the observational constraints are rather strong , and may even conflict with some of the predictions .",
    "thus our results provide motivation for investigating more systematically possible anomalous effects in the solar system predicted by alternative theories . in particular , the external field effect associated with the preferred direction of the galactic centre",
    "could be seen as a typical one arising in generic attempts to modify gravity with motivation coming from dark matter and/or dark energy .",
    "indeed we expect that generic departures from general relativity will violate the strong equivalence principle @xcite .",
    "on the other hand let us cautiously remark that mond and more sophisticated theories such as teves @xcite , which are intended to describe the weak field regime of gravity ( below @xmath13 ) , may not be extrapolated without modification to the strong field of the solar system .",
    "for instance it has been argued by @xcite that a mond interpolating function @xmath11 which performs well at fitting the rotation curves of galaxies is given by @xmath69 defined by below .",
    "however this function has a rather slow transition to the newtonian regime , given by @xmath70 when @xmath71 , which is already excluded by solar system observations @xcite .",
    "indeed such slow fall - off @xmath72 predicts a constant supplementary acceleration directed toward the sun @xmath73 ( i.e. a `` pioneer '' effect ) , which is ruled out because not seen from the motion of planets .",
    "thus it could be that the transition between mond and the newtonian regime is more complicated than is modelled in eq .  .",
    "this is also true for the modified dark matter model @xcite which may only give an effective description valid in the weak field limit and can not be extrapolated as it stands to the solar system .",
    "while looking at mond - like effects in the solar system we should keep the previous _ proviso _ in mind .",
    "the potential conflict we find here with the solar system dynamics ( notably with the earth orbital precession ) may not necessarily invalidate those theories if they are not `` fundamental '' theories but rather `` phenomenological '' models .",
    "the plan of this paper is the following . in sec .",
    "[ s : multipoles ] , we derive an expression of the solution of the mond equation near the origin in terms of multipole moments . section  [ s : numerics ] is devoted to numerical techniques and results , with a description of the particular formulation and assumptions used for the numerical integration in sec .",
    "[ ss : implementation ] , of the various tests passed by the code ( sec .",
    "[ ss : tests ] ) , and the numerical results and values for the first multipoles of the potential in sec .",
    "[ ss : quadrupole ] .",
    "section  [ s : effect ] details the consequences of this modified gravitational potential on the orbits of solar - system planets , with first the derivation of the perturbation equations in sec .",
    "[ ss : perturbation ] and numerical values for the planetary precessions ( sec .",
    "[ ss : precession ] ) .",
    "finally , section  [ s : conc ] summarises the results and gives some concluding remarks .",
    "in this paper we shall solve the modified poisson equation with the boundary condition given by the constant external gravitational field @xmath14 ( defining a preferred spatial direction denoted @xmath34 ) , i.e. that the gravitational field @xmath4 asymptotes to @xmath74 .",
    "the external field @xmath14 should consistently obey a mond equation , but here we shall simply need to assume that @xmath14 is constant over the entire solar system .",
    "the mondian physicist measures from the motion of planets relatively to the sun the internal gravitational potential @xmath27 defined by @xmath75 which is such that @xmath76 .",
    "contrary to what happens in the newtonian case , the external field @xmath14 does not disappear from the gravitational field equation and we want to investigate numerically its effect .",
    "the anomaly detected by a newtonian physicist with respect to the mondian physicist is the difference of internal potentials , @xmath77 where @xmath78 denotes the ordinary newtonian potential generated by the same ordinary matter distribution @xmath2 , and thus solution of the poisson equation @xmath79 with the boundary condition that @xmath80 .",
    "hence @xmath78 is given by the standard poisson integral @xmath81 a short calculation shows that the anomaly obeys the ordinary poisson equation @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is the density of `` phantom dark matter '' defined by @xmath84 where we denote @xmath85 .",
    "the phantom dark matter represents the mass density that a newtonian physicist would attribute to dark matter . in the model by @xcite the phantom dark matter is interpreted as the density of polarisation of some dipolar dark matter medium and the coefficient @xmath86 represents the `` gravitational susceptibility '' of this dark matter medium .",
    "the poisson equation @xmath82 is to be solved with the boundary condition that @xmath87 ; hence the solution is given by the poisson integral @xmath88 we emphasise here that , contrary to the newtonian ( linear ) case , the knowledge of the matter density distribution does not allow to obtain any analytic solution for the potential ; however , we can still infer the structure of the multipolar expansion near the origin , and the moments will be computed numerically .",
    "we can check that the phantom dark matter behaves like @xmath89 when @xmath90 , so the integral is perfectly convergent .",
    "we want to discuss the influence of the external galactic field in the inner part of the solar system where the gravitational field is strong ( @xmath26 ) ; thus @xmath11 tends to one there , so @xmath86 tends to zero . for the discussion in this section we adopt the extreme case where @xmath86 is",
    "_ exactly _ zero in a neighbourhood of the origin , say for @xmath91 , so that there is no phantom dark matter for @xmath91 ; in later sections devoted to the full numerical integration we shall still make this assumption by posing @xmath92 inside the sun ( in particular we shall always neglect the small mond effect at the centre of the sun where gravity is vanishingly small ) . if @xmath93 when @xmath91 we can directly obtain the multipolar expansion of the anomalous term about the origin by taylor expanding the integrand when @xmath94 . in this way",
    "we obtain @xmath95 where the multipole moments near the origin are given by denotes a multi - index composed of @xmath96 multipolar spatial indices @xmath97 ( ranging from 1 to 3 ) ; @xmath98 is the product of @xmath96 partial derivatives @xmath99 ; @xmath100 is the product of @xmath96 spatial positions @xmath29 ; similarly @xmath101 is the product of @xmath96 unit vectors @xmath102 ; the symmetric - trace - free ( stf ) projection is indicated with a hat , for instance @xmath103 $ ] , and similarly for @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "the decomposition of @xmath106 in terms of stf components @xmath105 is given by ",
    "below . in the case of",
    "summed - up ( dummy ) multi - indices @xmath107 , we do not write the @xmath96 summations from 1 to 3 over their indices . ]",
    "@xmath108 because the integration in is limited to the domain @xmath109 and @xmath110 is symmetric - trace - free ( stf ) there [ indeed @xmath111 , we deduce that the multipole moments @xmath112 themselves are stf .",
    "this can also be immediately inferred from the fact that @xmath113 when @xmath91 , hence the multipole expansion must be a homogeneous solution of the laplace equation which is regular at the origin , and is therefore necessarily made solely of stf tensors of type @xmath114 .",
    "hence we can replace @xmath115 in by its stf projection @xmath114 .",
    "it is clear from the formula that the mondian gravitational field ( for @xmath116 ) can influence the near - zone expansion of the field when @xmath117 .    with the expression for the phantom dark matter and the mond equation , we can further transform @xmath112 as @xmath118 \\partial_l\\left(\\frac{1}{r}\\right)\\,.\\ ] ] approximating the central matter distribution as being spherically symmetric ( i.e. ignoring the `` back - reaction '' of the non - spherical anomalous field @xmath119 on the matter which generates the field ) , we see that the first term is non - zero only in the monopolar case @xmath120 where it reduces in the limit @xmath121 to minus the newtonian potential evaluated at the origin . on the other hand",
    "the second term in can be transformed as a surface integral .",
    "we find @xmath122\\,.\\ ] ] our notation means that the surface integral is composed of two contributions , an inner one at @xmath123 ( denoted @xmath124 ) and an outer one at infinity @xmath125 ( say @xmath126 ) . in eq .",
    "we implicitly assume that the limit @xmath121 is to be taken after evaluating the inner surface integral .    inserting @xmath127 into the surface integral at infinity @xmath126",
    "we find that it contributes only to the dipolar term and reduces to the external galactic field ; thus @xmath128 with all other @xmath126 s being zero . on the other hand",
    "the inner surface integral @xmath124 is found to have a well - defined limit when @xmath121 given by @xmath129 , where we recall that @xmath105 denotes the stf part of @xmath98 .",
    "we then find that the galactic field in @xmath127 cancels the dipole term in the surface integral at infinity , so that the result is @xmath130 the internal mondian potential @xmath27 admits therefore the following stf multipolar expansion ( equivalent to a near - zone expansion when @xmath131 ) @xmath132 in appendix  [ appb ] we derive an alternative proof of this result . at this stage",
    "we have elucidated the structure of the multipole expansion of the anomaly @xmath119 near the origin , but still we need to resort to a numerical integration of the non - linear mond equation in order to obtain quantitative values for the multipole moments .",
    "section [ s : numerics ] will be devoted to this task .",
    "finally we show that the dipole moment @xmath133 ( with @xmath134 ) is actually zero @xcite .",
    "this follows from the weak equivalence principle satisfied by the bekenstein - milgrom theory . as a consequence , the total acceleration of the centre of mass of the solar system in the galactic external field @xmath14",
    "does not depend on the solar system s internal dynamics and is simply given by @xmath14 ( for a detailed proof see  @xcite ) .",
    "the centre of mass of the solar system does not differ much from that of the sun , so we deduce that the `` self - acceleration '' of the sun , i.e. the total acceleration due to the internal potential @xmath27 when integrated over the whole volume of the sun , must be ( approximately ) zero : @xmath135 we have obviously the same result for the newtonian potential @xmath136 in newtonian gravity so the same will be true for the anomalous field @xmath137 . in other words the phantom dark matter which is the source for the anomaly exerts no net force on the sun and we get , for a spherically symmetric star , @xmath138 in sec .",
    "[ ss : quadrupole ] we shall numerically verify that the dipole moment @xmath133 is indeed zero within our numerical error bars .",
    "using spherical spatial coordinates @xmath139 , we consider a star represented by a spherically symmetric distribution of matter @xmath140 obtained from a hydrostatic equilibrium model in newtonian theory ( polytrope ) .",
    "these models are obtained by integrating the hydrostatic spherical equilibrium equation ( relating the pressure @xmath141 and the gravitational field ) and the newtonian equation for the gravitational field ( relating the gravitational field and the density distribution @xmath2 ) , together with a polytropic equation of state ( eos ) of the form @xmath142 , where @xmath143 and @xmath144 are two constants . as it shall be shown later in sec .",
    "[ ss : tests ] , the results do not depend on the specific eos used to obtain this hydrostatic equilibrium , so we do not discuss the particular eos used for obtaining the density distribution .",
    "it also means that we neglect the effect of mond theory on the structure of the star .",
    "this is not a severe restriction , since inside the star the gravitational field is much higher in amplitude than the constant @xmath13 , making @xmath145 and newtonian theory is recovered up to very high accuracy .",
    "we then solve the mond equation  , with the boundary conditions given by the constant galactic gravitational field @xmath14 ( see fig .  [",
    "f : setting ] ) , i.e. @xmath146 . in order to be closer to a poisson - like form of the partial differential equation ( pde )",
    ", we are solving in terms of the internal potential @xmath147 such that @xmath76 . defining @xmath148 ,",
    "the mond equation   becomes the following pde : @xmath149 with @xmath150 being the derivative of the function @xmath11 with respect to its argument @xmath151 .",
    "this pde is solved numerically , using the library lorene which implements spectral methods ( for a review in the case of numerical relativity see @xcite ) in spherical coordinates . in our case",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ f : setting ] ) , the fields do not depend on the azimuthal angle @xmath152 and the problem is axisymmetric . since eq .   is a non - linear elliptic pde , the algorithm used is the fixed point iteration method in which one starts from an initial guess @xmath153 , here the solution of the newtonian poisson equation @xmath154 . knowing @xmath155 at a given iteration step @xmath156 , one computes the non - linear source terms in the right - hand - side of eq .  ,",
    "say @xmath157 , to obtain a new value of the potential @xmath158 , solving a linear poisson equation @xmath159 and using a relaxation technique @xmath160 with @xmath161 $ ] being the relaxation parameter ( often taken to be @xmath162 ) .",
    "this iteration is stopped when the relative variation of the potential @xmath27 between two successive steps becomes lower than a given threshold ( usually @xmath163 ) .",
    "the linear equation   is solved decomposing each field on a truncated base of spherical harmonics @xmath164 ( with @xmath165 because the problem is axisymmetric ) in the @xmath18-direction , and chebyshev polynomials @xmath166 in the @xmath38-direction . for this",

    "moreover , this multi - domain technique imposes that the potential @xmath27 , as well as its first radial derivative , be continuous across the stellar surface .",
    "finally , the only modification made to the exact equation   in order to be numerically integrated is the setting @xmath169 inside the star .",
    "indeed , there are two problems here .",
    "first , the mond gravitational field @xmath170 does not admit a regular taylor expansion near the origin , as does the density in eq .   and",
    "the associated newtonian gravitational field which follows as @xmath171 this can be immediately seen from the fact that in spherical symmetry the mond equation reduces to @xmath42 . using we see that the expansion of @xmath172 when @xmath131 starts with a term proportional to the square root of @xmath38 and is therefore not regular ; more precisely we have @xmath173\\,.\\ ] ] with our polynomial decomposition of fields in the radial direction , where we decompose in chebyshev polynomials @xmath166 , we therefore get an incompatibility when trying to solve the poisson equation   in the vicinity of the origin at the centre of the sun .",
    "the second problem is that , at the very centre of the star @xmath174 and therefore @xmath175 , which makes the division present in the right - hand - side of eq .",
    "difficult to handle numerically .",
    "here we have chosen to avoid both problems by imposing @xmath176 in the star so it is entirely newtonian .",
    "this approximation may produce a noticeable change in the value of @xmath0 only within a sphere of radius @xmath177 , where @xmath178 is the central density and @xmath179 is the radius of the sun .",
    "it is thus supposed to have a completely negligible effect on the results .",
    "the result which is finally used to study the influence of the modification of the newtonian gravity on the orbits of planets is the value of the trace - free multipole moments @xmath112 defined in sec .",
    "[ s : multipoles ] . in the case where all the multipole moments are induced by the presence of the external field @xmath14 in the preferred direction @xmath180 ,",

    "[ ss : motiv ] ) .",

    "@xmath193 this last expression shows that higher - order multipoles should have lower influence on solar - system planets , for which @xmath46 .",

    "next , an indication of the error comes from the use of the gauss theorem : @xmath195 where @xmath17 is the mass of the star , computed from initial data at a very high precision .",
    "then , another check ( which is however not _ a priori _ independent ) is the asymptotic behaviour of the potential @xmath196 when @xmath197 , which is @xmath198 where @xmath199 and @xmath200 with @xmath21 ( see the proof in appendix  [ appa ] ) .",
    "the two tests are not really independent because the gauss theorem is obtained by integrating the asymptotic field over a sphere at infinity .",
    "the main interest of these tests is that while the field is computed asymptotically on a sphere at infinity , the mass @xmath17 is obtained `` locally '' by integrating numerically the density over the volume of the star .",

    "with the same other parameters [ choices of @xmath0 , @xmath13 and @xmath50 ] , the relative difference in the induced quadrupole is @xmath206 , while the error indicators give a relative numerical uncertainty of @xmath207 .",

    "in the case of the earth the inpop ephemerides find a tight constraint @xmath316 coming from the jupiter vlbi data @xcite .",
    "this constraint seems already to exclude most of our obtained values for @xmath303 , except for mond functions of type @xmath226   with rather large values of @xmath156 . in particular",

    "that for all the planets the octupolar precession rate @xmath304 is very small and clearly completely negligible in current fits of the solar system dynamics .",
    "thus it seems that in the case of the earth the constraint from the jupiter vlbi data is already quite tight , and it is difficult to accommodate our anomalous quadrupolar precession rate @xmath303 for most choices of mond function @xmath0 .",
    "however let us remark that the postfit residuals in table  [ tab5 ] are obtained by adding by hands an excess of precession for the planets and looking for the tolerance of the data on this excess .",
    "but in order to really test the anomalous quadrupolar precession rate @xmath303 , one should consistently work in a mond picture , i.e. consider also the other effects predicted by this theory , like the precession of the nodes , the variation of the eccentricity and the inclination , and so on .",
    "then one should perform a global fit of all these effects to the data ; it is likely that in this way the quantitative conclusions would be different .    on the other hand ,",
    "as we have commented in the introduction , it is non - trivial to know if testing mond - like theories ( including teves and the model proposed by @xcite ) in the solar system could invalidate those theories , if they represent only some phenomenological models describing the weak field regime of gravity and as such should not be extrapolated as they are in the strong field of the solar system .",
    "in mondian gravity , the influence of the external galactic gravitational field onto the orbits of solar - system planets appears mainly through the presence of a quadrupolar perturbation to the gravitational potential , as it has been shown through a multipolar analysis of the solution of the mond equation .",
    "this contribution has been computed using a spectral , highly accurate , numerical poisson solver to obtain a solution of the equation  .",
    "this numerical solution has been extensively tested and compared to known analytical formulas , and all the expected properties have been recovered .",
    "using the most commonly used mond coupling functions @xmath0 and value of the mond acceleration @xmath13 , we have obtained quadrupole contributions that are compatible with those published by @xcite .",
    "we have also extended this calculation to include octupole contributions . with the derivation of detailed perturbation equations , the influence of the quadrupole and octupole on the perihelion precession of planets",
    "have been quantified and compared to two sets of observations , in particular the inpop planetary ephemerides by @xcite .    at first sight , these observational results seem to exclude the presence of a mond - efe induced quadrupole , for some choices of the mond function @xmath11 and scale @xmath13 .",
    "this is particularly true for the earth orbit , where constraints from the jupiter vlbi observations are very strong .",
    "however , for other choices of the mond function the observational constraints on the precession of the earth orbit are still compatible with the computed effect .",
    "these compatible mond functions share the property of having a very sharp transition from the weak - field ( modified ) to the strong field ( newtonian ) regime .",
    "moreover one should be very cautious and keep in mind that :    * the observational constraints on the solar - system orbits have been obtained by a global fit , using a fully relativistic first - post - newtonian model . taking only into account a particular mond effect like precession without considering",
    "a fully - mondian model is in principle incoherent since all the other effects should also be considered ; * the mond theory is a phenomenological approach trying to describe gravity in the weak field regime ( where evidence for dark matter arises ) .",
    "it is therefore unclear if such theory can be applied to stronger gravitational fields and , in particular , in the solar system .",
    "conversely , the constraints obtained here in strong field may not be relevant for the weak - field case unless some more fundamental theory , valid in both regimes , is known .    in any case , further studies are to be done if one wants to obtain more stringent conclusions about constraints imposed by solar - system observations onto mond - like theories .",
    "more precise observations could also give valuable informations about an eventual efe due to mond theory and also restrict the number of possible mond functions that are compatible with the observations .",
