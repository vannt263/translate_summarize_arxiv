    "the lifetime of the noble - metal ( 111 ) surface states has been the subject of numerous theoretical and experimental investigations .",
    "these states are formed due to the breaking of translational symmetry at the surface in combination with the band gap existing in the surface - projected bandstructure in the [ 111 ] direction . due to their localized nature",
    ", they play a role in a variety of surface - related phenomena , such as catalysis , adsorbate interactions , or surface transport , and can be probed by spectroscopic surface - sensitive techniques such as scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy ( stm and sts ) , photoemission , etc .. @xcite they furthermore constitute the fundament for the appearance of quantum - interference phenomena such as the famous quantum mirage in quantum - coral systems.@xcite    although surface states are orthogonal to bulk states when only the periodic crystal and surface potential is considered , in reality there are always coupling mechanisms of the surface states to each other and to the bulk states . mainly , these mechanisms are electron - electron interactions ( including interactions with collective electron modes such as plasmons ) , henceforth labeled `` ee , '' electron - phonon interactions , henceforth labeled `` ep , '' but also scattering at defects of the surface such as step edges , islands or adsorbate atoms , henceforth labeled `` ed . ''",
    "the total lifetime @xmath3 associated with these mechanisms is related to a sum of the scattering rates by @xmath4 at low temperature , the phonon contribution becomes negligible , while the contribution of the electron - electron interaction depends on the electron energy @xmath5 with respect to the fermi level @xmath6.@xcite for @xmath5 close to @xmath6 , and assuming fermi - liquid behavior , the contribution to the decrease of the lifetime from electron - electron interactions behaves as @xmath7 and is thus also ultimately frozen out .",
    "however , the scattering at defects remains finite .",
    "the lifetime @xmath3 of surface states is an experimentally measurable quantity .",
    "most commonly used methods for this purpose are angular resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes)@xcite and sts.@xcite arpes can detect the full surface band structure , @xmath8 and @xmath9 ( with @xmath10 appearing as a broadening @xmath11 of the electron bands ) , but defect scattering is necessarily averaged over a large surface area and can not be disposed of . in fact , one of the first experiments where the importance of defect - scattering was detected was based on arpes.@xcite it was shown that the lifetime @xmath3 of the cu(111 ) surface state actually _ decreased _ for energies close to @xmath6 , contrary to the predictions of fermi - liquid theory ; this effect was attributed to strong defect - scattering at those energies .",
    "sts , on the other hand , follows the onset of the surface state in the @xmath12 signal which is proportional to the density of states , changing shape from step - like ( as it would be for a two - dimensional electron system ) , to obtaining a certain width @xmath13 due to scattering.@xcite additionally , @xmath3 can be found via the phase coherence length @xmath14 by probing a quantum interference pattern in the @xmath12 curves produced by nanoscale resonators.@xcite in particular , sts has the advantage that one can choose a defect - free surface region , in order to isolate the electron - electron and electron - phonon scattering from the defect - scattering.@xcite    whereas in most of the experiments localized defects have been avoided as much as possible , there are a few experimental studies which followed the idea of controlling the defect concentration , in order to extrapolate to a defect - free surface .",
    "the first of these experiments has been performed with arpes for different concentration of potassium atoms on cu ( 111),@xcite where the structural disorder was investigated and quantified with leed . in references ,",
    "similar experiments have been reported , in which the surface - state lifetimes at several coverages of cu adatoms on cu ( 111 ) have been measured in order to extrapolate to zero - defect concentration .",
    "theoretical approaches to the surface - state lifetime address , in most cases , the electron - electron and electron - phonon interaction , under the assumption of an ideally defect - free surface .",
    "progress has been made in calculation of the effects of the electron - electron interaction , as the initial degenerate electron gas model@xcite was replaced by the more elaborate @xmath15 approximation@xcite of many - body theory . applied to image potential states,@xcite this approach led to a nice agreement with experiment,@xcite accounting for both intra - band and inter - band scattering . concerning electron - phonon scattering , already calculations based on the simple debye model lead to a satisfying agreement between numerical and experimental data,@xcite while more accurate @xmath16 calculations of the phonon density of states comprise the investigation of bulk and surface phonons.@xcite generally , at low temperatures the electron - phonon contribution of the scattering rate behaves as @xmath17 with @xmath18 being the electron - phonon coupling parameter .",
    "this linear behavior is also found by experiment.@xcite    however , in particular on scattering of surface states at adsorbate atoms , only few calculations have been published to date , mainly based on the wavepacket propagation method , which is a real - space , real - time approach.@xcite a systematic theoretical _ ab initio _ investigation of lifetime reduction caused by ( elastic ) scattering at different species of adatoms or substitutional impurities in the ( 111 ) surfaces of the noble metals is still lacking . bridging",
    "this gap is the purpose of this paper . furthermore , many of the aforementioned lifetime measurements ( especially in sts experiments )",
    "have been performed at the lower band edge of the surface - state band , where the contribution to the surface - state linewidth caused by defect scattering merges with the electron - electron and the electron - phonon contribution .",
    "this is different at the fermi energy ( at least at low temperatures ) , where defect scattering becomes the dominant mechanism .",
    "in addition , the fermi level is the relevant energy for transport processes .",
    "these are the main reasons , why we have performed our calculations at the fermi level .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : we start with an introduction to the theoretical formalism , i.e.  multiple scattering theory , based on the korringa - kohn - rostoker ( kkr ) green function method .",
    "we proceed with an analysis of computational and numerical aspects of the calculations , demonstrating differences between full potential calculations and those performed within the atomic sphere approximation .",
    "we study the lifetime reduction due to scattering at @xmath0 and @xmath1 impurities in the first surface layer and in the fcc adatom position on the noble metal thin films cu , ag and au , which turn out to show similar trends . while the trend for the scattering rates for impurities in the first surface layer is found to be similar to that calculated in bulk materials@xcite ( known also from residual resistivity results@xcite ) , the trend for scattering at adatoms remarkably differ .",
    "therefore , we focus on adatoms , and analyze the trend of scattering rates for @xmath0 and @xmath1 adatoms on cu(111 ) .",
    "this analysis includes an angular - momentum resolved study of surface - state lifetimes as well as a resolution of scattering into bulk and surface states . finally , the trend observed for magnetic impurities and adatoms is investigated .",
    "a note should be made here on our approximation concerning magnetic impurities .",
    "below the kondo temperature , the magnetic moment of these defects is quenched by many - body effects.@xcite the kondo temperature varies over orders of magnitude with respect to impurity type and host , depending exponentially on the position of the @xmath2 resonance and on the hybridization .",
    "therefore , there is no unique temperature above which all @xmath0 impurities become simultaneously magnetic .",
    "at a sufficiently low temperature , however , they should all be non - magnetic in the sense of the kondo effect . in this case",
    ", the non - magnetic density of states in the local - density approximation does not represent the physical density of states , except exactly at the fermi energy @xmath6 , where it is probably a good approximation .",
    "this follows from considerations on the anderson impurity model . in the case of a single localized impurity",
    "orbital , the exact solution gives the same phase shift and density of states at @xmath6  as the restricted mean - field solution ( i.e. , the mean - field solution where the two spin populations are constrained to be equal to each other , which is basically equivalent to a non - magnetic calculation ) . in a more general case",
    "the friedel sum rule reads @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the valence difference between impurity and host while @xmath21 is the phase shift at @xmath6  for angular momentum @xmath22 and spin @xmath23 and is directly related to the scattering matrix and scattering rate .",
    "if one assumes that only the @xmath2 electrons screen the impurity charge of a transition - metal impurity and that all @xmath2 orbitals are equivalent and have the same phase shift @xmath24 , and additionally takes into account that @xmath24 is spin - independent in the kondo regime , then the friedel sum rule reads @xmath25 .",
    "thus the phase shift at @xmath6  is fixed to the same value whether one considers the restricted - mean - field or the exact solution . in reality",
    "the assumption that only the @xmath2 electrons screen the impurity is an approximation , as is the assumption that the phase shift of all @xmath2 states is equivalent , since there is a small crystal - field spitting . in practice , however , the two assumptions are relatively well fulfilled , as one can see from comparison of experiment with calculations on the residual resistivity of simple - metal dilute alloys with @xmath0 impurities , where the impurity electronic structure was calculated within the density - functional theory and restricted to be non - magnetic ( see , e.g. , refs .  ) .",
    "therefore , the results obtained here by the non - magnetic calculations should be considered to be a reasonable approximation , since only fermi - level phase shifts enter the calculation .",
    "the approximation clearly breaks down for properties that probe the phase shift off the fermi level , e.g. in the thermopower where the derivative @xmath26 at @xmath6  enters . in this case",
    "the density - functional calculations@xcite can not account for the giant thermopower encountered for the kondo impurities mn and fe in al .",
    "details of the kkr method for electronic structure calculations and impurity scattering have been published elsewhere.@xcite here we focus on the definition of some quantities which will be useful in the discussion .    in the kkr method ,",
    "the bloch wavefunction @xmath27 at a point @xmath28 within an atomic cell @xmath29 sited at @xmath30 is expanded as @xmath31 where the @xmath32 are regular scattering solutions of the schrdinger equation of the atom @xmath29 embedded in free space with boundary condition of an incoming spherical wave of angular momentum @xmath33 , while @xmath5 denotes the energy eigenvalue .",
    "the coefficients @xmath34 are found by the solution of the kkr secular equation for lattice site 0 and propagated by a bloch factor to any other site .    in the presence of an impurity",

    ", @xmath39 is calculated using the expression @xmath40 where the algebraic form of the @xmath38 matrix @xmath41 contains information on the impurity structural green function @xmath42 and on the difference in the atomic scattering properties between the embedded - impurity and substituted - host atom at site @xmath29 : @xmath43 with @xmath44 being the regular scattering solutions of the impurity atom in free space in analogy to the host - atom solutions @xmath45 ( the r.h.s of eqs .",

    "( [ eqn : def_t_llnn ] ) is limited to the sites for which the self - consistent potential is appreciably affected by the presence of the impurity ; usually the impurity site and its nearest neighbors are sufficient . only these sites are taken into account also for the calculation of the impurity structural green function via an algebraic dyson equation @xmath49 from the host green function @xmath50    finally , the probability for an electron scattering from a state @xmath51 to a state @xmath52 is given by @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the total number of atoms in the crystal and @xmath55 is the impurity concentration ( @xmath56 is the number of randomly positioned impurities ) .",
    "assuming that each impurity scatters independently , the lifetime of a state @xmath51 can be found by summing up the probabilities for scattering of a state @xmath51 into all possible final states @xmath52 @xmath57 the summation over @xmath52 can be transformed to an integral , such that the inverse lifetime is obtained by integration over the fermi surface @xmath58 @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the fermi surface element , @xmath61 is the fermi velocity and @xmath62 the brillouin zone volume .",
    "the electronic structure of the investigated finite - thickness films and defects has been calculated self - consistently within density - functional theory using the principal layer technique implemented in the kkr green function method@xcite using the experimental lattice parameter and an angular momentum cutoff of @xmath63 .",
    "exchange and correlation effects were included within the local - density approximation to density - functional theory in the parametrization of vosko et al,@xcite while relativistic effects were taken into account in the scalar relativistic approximation ( ignoring spin - orbit coupling ) . except from section [ sec : comp_asa_fp ] , where the difference between full potential ( fp ) calculations and those performed in the atomic sphere approximation ( asa ) is compared ,",
    "the asa was used .",
    "the perturbed region , where charge relaxation is allowed , is restricted in our calculations to a cluster of 13 sites , thus the shell of nearest neighbors , unless otherwise stated .",
    "structural relaxations are not taken into account , as they could have a quantitative but not qualitative effect to the trends that are related , as we find , to symmetry reduction , reduced screening of adatoms , and the variation of localization of the surface states as a function of film thickness .",
    "our calculations are performed on finite - thickness films .",
    "the situation of a half - infinite crystal with a single surface is approximated by increasing the film thickness up to 40 layers .",
    "furthermore , the vacuum region is described by empty atomic sites at 3 ( or in the fp calculations 4 ) layers above the surface ; these are called ` vacuum layers ' , composed of ` vacuum sites ' .      the three investigated materials , copper , silver and gold crystalize in the fcc structure , have a very similar electronic structure and therefore their fermi surfaces are very similar to each other , too . as these systems are characterized by a two - dimensional periodicity , their fermi surface consists of one - dimensional curves that form ring - like structures , except in the vicinity of the brillouin - zone boundary , where hexagonal - like structures occur .",
    "the number of rings on the fermi surface scales linearly with the number of layers , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : fs_cu ] for the example of a copper ( 111 ) fermi surface for films with 6 ( left ) and 18 copper layers ( right ) .",
    "the two innermost rings represent the surface bands which are formed in the gap of the surface - projected band - structure.@xcite    surface states are localized at the atomic layers close to the surface and decay exponentially into the bulk and into the vacuum . since in a finite film",
    "there are two surfaces ( say `` left '' and `` right '' ) , also two surface states @xmath64 and @xmath65 appear and interact , forming a bonding and an anti - bonding hybrid , @xmath66 with energies @xmath67 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : local_sf_states ] ) .",
    "the coupling of these two states manifests in a splitting between the two inner rings of the fermi surfaces , decreasing with increasing film thickness since the overlap of the two surface states decreases exponentially . in the sections on the lifetime calculation we show results on the innermost surface - state ring at @xmath68 , @xmath69 , noting that the lifetime @xmath70 changes only very weakly for different @xmath71 corresponding to the same surface - state ring , due to the isotropic character of the surface states .    in the limit of infinite film thickness",
    "only one of the two surface bands survives at each surface ( either @xmath64 or @xmath72 ) .",
    "however , the overlap of these states with the surface - impurity is higher by a factor @xmath73 compared to the overlap of @xmath74 with the impurity .",
    "therefore , for comparison with experiments performed not on ultrathin films but on crystal surfaces , the scattering rates which are calculated here in the @xmath74 basis can be taken from the thick but finite film calculations but have to be multiplied by a factor 2 .",
    "contrary to the case of bulk systems where momentum - relaxation times and residual resistivities due to scattering at impurities have been calculated in _ ab initio _ calculations ( e.g.  in ref .  ) , there are no numerical or experimental references to compare our results of lifetime reduction of surface states caused by adatom scattering .",
    "however , another possibility to attest the numerical correctness of the results is given by the optical theorem , according to which the elements of the scattering matrix @xmath75 must obey @xmath76 this identity turns out to be a very sensitive consistency probe .",
    "also , it is numerically fulfilled only if the numerical convergence of the quantities involved is very good .",
    "we have calculated surface - state scattering rates @xmath77 for impurities in the first surface layer as well as in adatom position on top of the surface at the fcc threefold - hollow site on a 6 layers cu(111 ) film via both sides of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : opt_theo ] ) . the deviation between the left and the right side of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : opt_theo ] ) was in all cases less than @xmath78 ( the latter deviation was obtained for surface - state scattering rates off impurities in adatom position in fp calculations ) .",
    "the accuracy of the calculations is very sensitive to the number of @xmath51 points used for the calculation of the structural green function of the host , @xmath79 , which is used to calculate the impurity green function @xmath80 via a dyson equation .",
    "additionally , four vacuum layers are necessary to obtain the above mentioned accuracy .",
    "the computational effort in asa is lower than in fp calculations . however , at surfaces , where the symmetry is broken , non - spherical components of the potential could play an important role .",
    "therefore , for the example of a film of 6 layers of copper , surface - state lifetimes within asa and fp calculations are calculated and compared to each other .",
    "the results are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : comp_asa_fp_slabs_sf ] . in the two panels on the left the self - consistent perturbed potential of the impurity and the nearest neighbors ( 13 sites in total , which we call a _ multiple - site _ calculation ) has been included in the calculation of the scattering matrix @xmath81 . in the two panels on the right , calculations in the _ single - site - approximation _ are presented , i.e.  only the impurity site is taken in the summation of eq .",

    "all scattering rates , i.e.  inverse lifetimes @xmath77 , are given in units of ps@xmath82 per atomic percent of impurities .",
    "for impurities in the first surface layer ( the results are shown in the two upper panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : comp_asa_fp_slabs_sf ] ) , the agreement between the asa and fp schemes is very good , both for single - site and multiple - site calculations .",
    "this is not the case for adatoms as can be observed in the two lower panels of the same figure where a quantitative difference of maximal @xmath83 can be observed .",
    "nevertheless , the trends in fp and asa are qualitatively similar",
    ". since we are interested in these trends , we will restrict our further calculations to the asa .",
    "the qualitative difference between single - site multiple - site calculations in the case of adatoms raises the question whether the cluster consisting of nearest neighbors is large enough to obtain converged results .",
    "therefore , multiple - site calculations ( not shown here ) including additionally the shells up to the third nearest neighboring sites ( 43 atoms in total ) have been performed .",
    "they show that the results remain practically stable beyond the nearest - neighbor approximation , which we adopt henceforth .",
    "the most striking feature of our results is the qualitative difference between the trends of scattering rates at adatoms and those of impurities in the surface , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : comp_asa_fp_slabs_sf ] . while the trend for impurities in the first surface layer ( lower panel ) resembles that which has been found for scattering at impurities in bulk,@xcite the trend for the scattering rate at adatoms ( upper panel ) does not .    in the case of impurities in the first surface layer as well as in bulk , the observed trend follows the local density of states of the impurities ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : dos_adatoms ] ) : for the @xmath2 scatterers , the scattering rate shows a peak with a maximum at v and cr as the @xmath2 resonance crosses the fermi energy .",
    "then , as the @xmath84 states start crossing @xmath6 , the scattering rate increases again starting off quadratically according to linde s rule.@xcite    basically , this correlation between the impurity local density of states and the scattering strength of impurities can be traced back to conditions which are not necessarily met for adatoms .",
    "the first condition is that the screening of the impurity charge in metals takes place mostly in the impurity atomic cell .",
    "thus the perturbation of the potential in nearby cells is rather small , while the impurity wavefunctions are relatively atomic - like in the cell and matched to phase - shifted host waves outside .",
    "the second condition is that the free - electron - like behavior in the bulk of normal metals together with the nearly spherical symmetry of the impurity potential allows for independent scattering of the @xmath85 , @xmath84 and @xmath2 without mutual interference .",
    "thus the angular - momentum resolved local density of states reflects the scattering properties of the angular - momentum channels independently to each other .    for adatoms , however , the screening is not as efficient , thus the atomic size can increase significantly . here , by atomic size we mean the volume in which the impurity induces a significant potential perturbation .",
    "in addition , the reduced symmetry allows for interference between different angular momenta , notably ( as we will see ) between @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "impurities in the surface layer are apparently close enough to the impurity - in - bulk situation that they behave in the same way .",
    "having in mind these comments , we proceed to an analysis of the results .      considering the trend of adatom - scattering rates in the multiple - site approach ( see the left - bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : comp_asa_fp_slabs_sf ] ) , there are two features to observe : the first part of the trend ( from sc to fe / co ) is dominated by a relatively large scattering rate , showing a plateau which is absent in the single - site calculations ( right - bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : comp_asa_fp_slabs_sf ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the second part of the curve ( from ni to se ) is qualitatively the same for single - site and multiple - site calculations .",
    "however , it behaves in an uncommon manner , showing a kink - like structure , which is completely different from the trend for the @xmath87 impurities in the surface .",
    "the plateau in the scattering rates of the early @xmath0 scatterers can be understood by the significant difference between the single - site approximation compared to multiple - site calculations ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : charge ] ) , which hints at an atomic size effect . these atoms ( sc , ti",
    ", v ) have relatively large atomic radii ( which are @xmath88 for sc , @xmath89 for ti , @xmath90 for v)@xcite and therefore extend much more into the vacuum than e.g.  a ni adatom with @xmath91 .",
    "this is not any more the case for atoms embedded in the surface or in bulk , as the strong screening strongly reduces the atom size . in order to verify this line of arguments",
    "we have performed additional calculations where  apart from the adatom site  only the perturbed surrounding vacuum sites or only the perturbed substrate cu atoms are included in the expression for @xmath75 ( see the summation over sites @xmath92 in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : t_kk_t_nn ] ) ) .",
    "these calculations reveal that the largest contribution next to the adatom - site arises from the surrounding vacuum potential , and _ not _ from the cu atoms in the surface layer .",
    "we also examined the density of states at @xmath6  around the impurity , shown in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : dos_adatoms ] .",
    "we found that , indeed , there is an increased dos in the vacuum around the early @xmath0 adatoms , while this contribution is reduced for the late @xmath0 series .",
    "when the @xmath84 states start crossing @xmath6  ( at ga ) the size of the atom grows again , but apparently the qualitative trend is governed by different effects ( see next paragraph ) , although there are some quantitative differences between single- and multiple - site calculations .",
    "the larger extent of the early @xmath0 adatoms also manifests in a larger charge transfer to the surrounding vacuum sites .",

    "( iii ) gives a behavior of the form @xmath125 for scattering into bulk states , which should show a saturation for large @xmath119 , but could be either increasing or decreasing at small @xmath119 depending on the relative importance of the two terms . on the other hand , point ( i ) gives a behavior of the form latexmath:[$1/\\tau_{\\vec",
    "k}^{\\mathrm{surf}}\\sim    which should be first decreasing with @xmath119 and then also saturating .",
    "the qualitatively expected behavior is consistent with our calculations ( fig .",
    "[ fig : scat_bulk_sf ] ) .",
    "the scattering rates into surface states are larger for the 6 layer film than for the 40 layer film by approximately a factor 2 , while the scattering rates into bulk states are a little larger for the 40 layer film .",
    "in the previous section we have analyzed surface - state lifetimes for impurities in and on copper films . here",
    "we extend our investigations to silver and gold films .",
    "even though the band structure of the three noble metals is similar , differences are anticipated mainly due to the change of energetic position of the surface state , especially in ag .        the calculated data , shown in fig .  [ fig : scat_cuagau ] , are qualitatively similar for all three hosts .",
    "scattering rates off adatoms are largest for the first elements of the row and remain almost constant until mn ; just as in the case of the copper film ( see previous section ) , this should be due to the larger atomic radius entailing a larger extent of these adatoms into the vacuum . furthermore , all three host materials show a clear trend that scattering at adatoms on a film of six layers is enhanced compared to that of larger thickness .",
    "the reason is the higher localization of the surface state for thin films , as explained in the cu(111 ) case .",
    "we show here results for the innermost surface state only , whose lifetime , especially for the 6 layer films and for some adatoms , remarkably differs from that of the second surface state . while for the early @xmath0 elements the difference is relatively small ( a few percent ) , it can increase up to @xmath127 for ge and @xmath128 for as adatoms .",
    "for the 40 layer film , this difference almost vanishes as does the splitting between the two surface bands .    concerning scattering at impurities in the surface , the situation is somewhat complicated .",
    "qualitatively , for all three host materials a clear maximal scattering rate for the @xmath0 elements with half - filled shells ( v , cr ) is observed as well as high scattering rates for the @xmath87 scatterers .",
    "hence , as expected , the global trend reflects the situation of scattering at impurities in the bulk .",
    "however , large quantitative differences among the three host materials are observed when considering the thickness - dependence as well as the comparative scattering strength of @xmath0 and @xmath1 impurities . while for a copper host , the scattering rate does not depend much on the film thickness , especially for silver films the thickness can change the scattering rate up to almost an order of magnitude .",
    "actually , such a strong variation in the ag films is reasonable , because of the relatively shallow position of the surface state with respect to the fermi energy.@xcite as a result , in thin films quantum - confinement effects push one of the two surface states ( the innermost ring ) above @xmath6 and the other lower , resulting in a significant change of the available phase space for scattering . in thicker films",
    "the two states are approximately degenerate and below @xmath6 . in any case , in ag the scattering rate into surface states",
    "is small due to the smallness of the corresponding fermi rings .",
    "a comparison to other theoretical or experimental results is not possible because of lack of data ; although these surface states have been subject of many experiments , to our knowledge no experiments have been performed in which the surface - state lifetimes due to scattering at the specific impurities at the fermi level have been measured .",
    "however , the order of magnitude of the calculated scattering rates should allow for an experimental detection , which e.g. in arpes reaches a few mev .",
    "to compare , in inverse photoemission spectroscopy a linewidth of about @xmath129 for cu , @xmath130 for ag and @xmath131 for au for electron - electron scattering processes has been measured.@xcite a measurement for @xmath132 of defects should be , therefore , within the experimental resolution .",
    "so far , only scattering at non - magnetic impurities and adatoms has been considered , in an approximation that was explained in the introduction . however , above the kondo temperature , some of the @xmath0 impurities become magnetic and scattering in the two spin channels has to be treated separately .",
    "we investigate now the consequences of spin polarization , showing results for the cu(111 ) surface only , which suffices to demonstrate the main effect of a double - peak structure in the scattering rate .",
    "the calculated lifetimes are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : scat_cuagau_magn ] for a 40-layer film . in the adatom position",
    "the @xmath0 elements starting between ti and ni are magnetic , while as impurities in the surface ti and ni are paramagnetic .",
    "the @xmath1 elements are in all cases non - magnetic .",
    "the magnetism of the @xmath0 elements leads to an expected double - peak structure in the trend of the scattering rates , which is already known e.g.  for residual resistivity in bulk above the kondo temperature@xcite and originates from the offset of the @xmath2 resonances of the two spin channels , which are mutually repelled by the exchange interaction .",
    "thus , a first peak of the scattering rate is observed for ti , where the @xmath2 resonance of the majority channel is centered at the fermi level , while a second peak appears for fe and co in the minority - spin channel . for cr impurities , where scattering rates are large in the case of paramagnetic impurities ,",
    "the scattering rate is most drastically reduced as @xmath6  lies between the resonances .",
    "in summary , we have presented a systematic study of the lifetime of the ( 111 ) surface state of the noble metals considering scattering at the fermi energy due to @xmath0 and @xmath1 impurities atoms on and in the surface .",
    "our main finding is a qualitatively different trend , as a function of the impurity atomic number , for adatoms compared to surface - embedded impurities . while the latter case is similar to the trend for impurities in the bulk , reflecting the sharpness of the @xmath2-resonance and linde s rule as the @xmath2 and @xmath84 states cross the fermi level , adatom scattering is found to be dominated by other criteria such as the size of the adatom and interference effects between the scattering amplitudes of different angular momenta .",
    "the conclusion is that the surface strongly affects the scattering properties by the reduction in charge screening as well as by the lowering of symmetry .",
    "a separation of scattering rates into surface - to - surface and surface - to - bulk parts shows that the two contributions are comparable in magnitude for adatoms as well as for embedded impurities .",
    "additionally , in the case of ultrathin films we have found that the scattering into surface - states contribution decreases with film thickness , since the surface state extends further into the bulk in thicker films , and finally saturates .",
    "furthermore , we have found that the lifetime is sensitive on the film thickness , especially for ag .",
    "this is due to the very shallow surface state of ag , which can be shifted in energy due to quantum confinement effects , changing the available phase space for scattering .",
    "the calculated lifetimes should be detectable as a surface - state linewidth within the resolution of photoemission spectroscopy already for impurity concentrations 1% .",
    "we are indebted to prof . p. h. dederichs for valuable discussions .",
    "s.  l. acknowledges the support of the hgf - yig programme vh - ng-717 .",
    "the temperature dependence of the contribution of the electron - phonon coupling to the surface - state linewidth can be addressed by arpes only , since at elevated temperature sts measurements do not lead to significant results ; this is due to a change of the width of the fermi distribution function @xcite and thus an intrinsic broadening .                                                        in photoemission spectroscopy",
