    "error - correction mechanisms are essential for preventing loss of information in transmissions through noisy environments .",
    "they are of increasing technological importance with applications ranging from high capacity storage media to satellite communication . the surprising fact",
    "that error - free communication is possible if the information is encoded to include a minimum amount of redundancy was discovered by shannon in 1948 @xcite .",
    "shannon proved that a message encoded at rates @xmath0 ( message information content / code - word length ) up to the channel capacity @xmath1 can be decoded with vanishing average error probability @xmath2 as the length of the message increases @xmath3 .",
    "this theorem was then progressively refined by gallager and others ( see @xcite and references therein ) to say that the average over messages and codes of the error probability is bounded by @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the error exponent that is greater than zero for rates up to the channel capacity @xmath1 .",
    "these proofs were presented in a non - constructive form by assuming encoding processes by ensembles of unstructured random codes and impractical decoding methods like maximum likelihood or typical set decoding @xcite .",
    "no encoding - decoding scheme that is practical and attains the coding bound has been found to date .",
    "the most successful code in use to date is the turbo code @xcite .",
    "however , the current performance record is owned by an irregular low - density parity check code ( ldpc ) , more specifically an irregular gallager code @xcite .",
    "this code was first proposed by gallager in 1962 @xcite , and were all but forgotten soon after due to technical limitations of the time .",
    "recently a variation of the original proposal by gallager named mn code has been proposed by mackay and neal @xcite ; they showed that this code has good performance , what attracted renewed interest to ldpcs .",
    "since then ldpcs have been reconsidered in a variety of architectures @xcite .",
    "some of which reported close to optimal performance @xcite .    representing a message by a binary vector @xmath6 , the ldpc encoding process consists of producing the binary vector @xmath7 defined by @xmath8 , where all operations are performed in the field @xmath9 and are indicated by @xmath10 and @xmath11",
    "is a @xmath12 generator matrix .",
    "the transmission is then corrupted by noise , that we assume to be a binary vector @xmath13 , and the received vector takes the form @xmath14 .",
    "the decoding process is performed by applying a suitable parity - check matrix to the received message to produce the _ syndrome _ vector @xmath15 .",
    "the parity - check matrix @xmath16 defines the code structure and can be represented by a bipartite undirected graph with check and bit nodes .",
    "this gives rise to the classification of ldpcs to regular ( those forming regular graphs ) and irregular codes .",
    "the parity - check matrix for gallager codes is a concatenation @xmath17 $ ] of two very sparse matrices , with @xmath18 ( of dimensionality @xmath19 ) being invertible and the rectangular matrix @xmath20 of dimensionality @xmath21 .",
    "the generator matrix of a gallager code is @xmath22 \\mbox { ( mod 2)}$ ] , where @xmath23 is the @xmath24 identity matrix , implying that @xmath25 and that the message itself is set as the first @xmath26 bits in the transmission .",
    "the syndrome vector is then @xmath27 from which the noise can be estimated and subtracted from the received message . for a mn code",
    "the generator matrix has the form @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is an @xmath30 invertible matrix and @xmath31 is @xmath32 .",
    "the matrix applied by the decoder is given by @xmath29 producing @xmath33 , from which the most probable message vector can be predicted .",
    "although gallager and mn codes can be analysed by the same methods of information theory @xcite , they represent different physical systems with different properties . in this paper",
    "we will restrict the analysis to irregular mn codes , the analysis of gallager codes will appear elsewhere .    statistical physics",
    "has first been applied to the analysis of error - correcting codes in the seminal work of sourlas @xcite which has been recently extended to the case of finite code rates @xcite .",
    "similar methods have been recently applied to the case of turbo codes @xcite and regular mn codes @xcite , providing a detailed description of the system s phases and capabilities for various parameter choices . here",
    "we analyse irregular mn codes using the standard replica calculation to find a free energy that is a measure of the likelihood of typical solutions to the decoding problem , given an ensemble of code matrices @xmath31 and @xmath29 ( _ code construction _ ) , channel and message models ( _ noise level _ and _ message bias _ ) .",
    "we show that three types of solutions emerge depending on the parameters provided : successful errorless decoding ( number of incorrect bits less than @xmath34 ) , imperfect decoding ( number of incorrect bits of order @xmath26 ) and complete failure ( number of correct bits less than @xmath34 ) .",
    "we also show , as in @xcite , that the line separating errorless and complete failure phases can coincide with the coding limit ; this fact itself is not particularly surprising as the statistical physics analysis relies on the same kind of arguments used in the original coding bounds , using averages over ensembles of codes and maximum likelihood decoding .",
    "the main difference here is that the matrices in the ensemble have some structure .",
    "the statistical physics approach can be regarded as complementary to that of information theory ; it enables one to attain a more complete picture by analysing the decoding problem in the infinite message limit and by looking at global properties of the free energy .",
    "it allows for a transparent analysis of the possible performance of different codes characterised by different choices of construction parameters , and has already resulted in new practical high performance codes @xcite .    in this framework",
    ", bayes - optimal decoding generally corresponds to finding the global minimum of a tap free energy @xcite which is very costly if the landscape has multiple local minima .",
    "a practical decoding algorithm that has been used in ldpcs is the scheme known as belief propagation , broadly used by the bayesian inference community @xcite .",
    "belief propagation is equivalent to solving iteratively a set of coupled equations for finding extrema ( local or global ) of the tap free energy @xcite .",
    "this method is very sensitive to the presence of local minima and can be easily trapped in sub - optimal solutions .    in this paper",
    "we study the dependence of the free energy surface on the noise level and the message bias ; this allows us to study the solutions which exist in each one of the cases and to detect the emergence of suboptimal solutions that will interfere in the practical decoding dynamics .",
    "this paper is organised as follows : section 2 presents irregular mn codes , while the statistical physics analysis is outlined in section 3 ; the relations between the belief propagation approach and statistical physics are discussed in section 4 and employed to examine the decoding performance in sections 5 and 6 .",
    "concluding remarks are given in section 7 .",
    "although the best irregular ldpcs found so far are defined in @xmath35-ary alphabets @xcite , we will restrict the current analysis to the binary alphabet @xmath9 .",
    "we suppose that the binary messages @xmath36 comprise independent bits sampled from the prior distribution @xmath37 , where @xmath38 stands for the dirac s delta distribution .",
    "we also assume a simple memoryless binary symmetric channel ( bsc ) with binary vectors @xmath39 having independent components sampled from a similar prior distribution of the form @xmath40 .",
    "from now on we will reserve the symbols @xmath41 and @xmath42 for the actual message and noise , using @xmath36 and @xmath39 for denoting random variables in the message and noise models .",
    "the goal is then to find the bayes - optimal estimate @xmath43 ; the matrices @xmath29 and @xmath31 are also given , but were omitted for brevity .",
    "one can use bayes formula to incorporate the prior knowledge on message and noise and write the adequate posterior probability : @xmath44 where the indicator function is @xmath45 if @xmath46 is true and @xmath47 otherwise .",
    "the matrices are chosen at random in such a way that @xmath29 is invertible over the field @xmath9 and a row @xmath48 in @xmath31 and @xmath29 contains @xmath49 and @xmath50 non - zero elements respectively . in the same way , each column @xmath51 of @xmath31 contains @xmath52 non - zero elements and each column @xmath53 of @xmath29 contains @xmath54 non - zero elements .",
    "parity - checks for the signal and noise bits are specified by the matrices @xmath31 and @xmath29 respectively .",
    "the system can be mapped onto a bipartite graph represented by @xmath55 ( adjacency matrix in the graph theory jargon ) , to say , each one of the @xmath56 rows lists the bit nodes connected to a check node and each one of the @xmath57 columns lists the checks conveying information about the particular bit node .",
    "therefore , the sets @xmath58 and @xmath59 give the order of check nodes , @xmath60 and @xmath61 the order of bit nodes .",
    "clearly this sets must obey the relations : @xmath62 standing for the number of edges in the signal and noise graphs respectively .",
    "the information rate of the code is given by @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the binary entropy of the source .",
    "alternatively one can write @xmath65 , where : @xmath66    to simplify the calculations we change , as in the original work by sourlas @xcite , the representation of the variables , replacing the field @xmath9 by @xmath67 and modulo 2 sums by products . moreover , we restrict our analysis to the case of irregular bit nodes ( sets @xmath60 and @xmath61 ) and regular check nodes ( fixed @xmath68 and @xmath69 ) . the case with regular bit nodes and irregular check nodes",
    "is the basis for high performance codes studied in @xcite .",
    "to assess the performance of irregular mn codes we compute , using standard techniques , the free energy of the system @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the normalisation in ( [ eq : problem ] ) .",
    "the average @xmath72 is performed over the matrices @xmath29 and @xmath31 , the messages @xmath41 and the noise @xmath42 and will provide information about the _ typical _ performance of these codes .    in the @xmath73 representation ,",
    "the syndrome vector @xmath33 becomes @xmath74 , where @xmath75 and @xmath76 are sets of indices corresponding to the non - zero elements in one of the @xmath56 rows of @xmath31 and @xmath29 respectively .    the prior distribution over the message bits @xmath77 becomes @xmath78 , while for the noise bits @xmath79 one has @xmath80 .",
    "the code construction is specified by the tensor @xmath81 that determines the set of indices @xmath82 which correspond to non - zero elements in a particular row of the matrix @xmath55 . to cope with non - invertible @xmath29 matrices one can start by considering an ensemble with",
    "uniformly generated @xmath30 matrices .",
    "the non - invertible instances can then be made invertible by eliminating a @xmath83 number of rows and columns , resulting in an ensemble of @xmath84 invertible @xmath29 matrices and @xmath85 @xmath31 matrices .",
    "as we are interested in the thermodynamical limit we can neglect @xmath86 differences and compute the averages in the original space of @xmath30 matrices .",
    "the averages are then performed over an ensemble of codes generated as follows :    1 .",
    "sets of numbers @xmath87 and @xmath88 are sampled independently from distributions @xmath89 and @xmath90 respectively ; 2 .",
    "tensors @xmath91 are generated such that @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 , where @xmath95 stands for all sets of indices that contain @xmath51 .",
    "the indicator @xmath96 in ( [ eq : problem ] ) can be replaced by a more tractable function that is @xmath97 , if the dynamical variables @xmath36 and @xmath39 satisfy @xmath98 and @xmath99 otherwise .",

    "is obtained in the _ zero temperature _ limit unlike the sourlas code case where optimal decoding must be carried out at finite temperatures @xcite .",
    "the free energy @xmath109 can be determined using the replica method along the same lines as reported in @xcite , but for the irregular case it also depends on the probability distributions @xmath89 and @xmath90 used to generate the ensemble of codes .",

    "can only be obtained numerically and must be bellow the shannon s bound as can be shown by a simple upper bound proposed in @xcite .",

    "in particular , we will focus on the belief propagation decoding process . in this practical scenario",
    "the energy landscape may be dominated by the basin of attraction of paramagnetic or suboptimal ferromagnetic states even when the ferromagnetic state is the global minimum , degrading the practical performance of the code .",
    "the decoding problem focuses on finding a bayes - optimal estimate ( also known as _ marginal posterior maximiser _ , mpm ) @xmath152 for the original message , given the code structure , the syndrome vector @xmath153 and prior probabilities @xmath143 and @xmath144 .",
    "the bayes - optimal estimator is defined as an estimator that minimises the posterior average of some determined loss function . using the overlap between message and estimate as a loss function ,",
    "the bayes - optimal estimator that emerges is of the form @xmath154 @xcite .",
    "the task of computing this estimator is usually very difficult as no simple form is known for the posterior @xmath155 and an exponential number of operations is required .",
    "the problem can be solved in practical time scales by applying the belief propagation ( bp)@xcite framework . in this framework ,",
    "an approximation for the marginal posterior probabilities @xmath156 can be computed iteratively in linear time . for that , a graphical representation ( belief network ) for dependencies between check nodes ( or evidence nodes ) and signal nodes can be constructed . by identifying proper substructures in the belief network one can write a closed set of equations whose solutions provide the approximation to the posterior probabilities .",
    "these substructures can be uniquely identified with conditional distributions . for ldpcs",

    "one can see that the magnetization of ordinary nodes follow that of the regular code in the first iterations , elite nodes are then corrected quickly achieving high magnetization values .",
    "these highly reliable nodes then lead the correction of ordinary nodes ( around the fifth iteration ) , producing successful decoding . from the decoding dynamics point of view",
    "irregular mn codes can be qualitatively regarded as a mixture of low and highly connected regular codes where elite nodes can tolerate higher noise levels while ordinary nodes allow for higher code rates .",
    "in the last section we gained some insight on how irregularity affects the practical performance of codes . the dynamical decoding process shown in figure [ figure3b ] only provides a qualitative explanation and does not seem to allow some simple analysis .    a possible alternative is to relate the observation that the system gets trapped in suboptimal states ( figure [ figure3a ] ) to global properties of the free energy . the tap / bp algorithm can be regarded as an iterative solution of fixed point equations for the tap free energy ( [ eq : tap_freeenergy ] ) , which is sensitive to the presence of local minima in the system .",
    "one can expect convergence to the global minimum of the free energy from all initial conditions when there is a single minimum or when the landscape is dominated by the basin of attraction of this minimum when random initial conditions are used .    to analyse this point",
    "we rerun the decoding experiments starting from initial conditions @xmath208 and @xmath209 that are random perturbations of the ferromagnetic solution : @xmath210 and @xmath211 where for convenience we choose @xmath212 .",
    "we performed tap / bp decoding several times for different values of @xmath121 and noise level @xmath144 .",
    "for @xmath213 we observed that the system converges to the ferromagnetic state for _ all _ constructions , message biases @xmath143 and noise levels @xmath144 examined .",
    "it implies that this state is always stable .",
    "the convergence occurs for any @xmath121 for noise levels below the transition observed in practice .",
    "these observations suggest that the ferromagnetic basin of attraction dominates the landscape up to some noise level @xmath214 .",
    "the fact that no other solution is ever observed in this region suggests that @xmath214 is the noise level where suboptimal solutions actually appear , namely , it is the noise level that corresponds to the _ spinodal point _ of the system .",
    "this behaviour have already been observed for regular mn codes with @xmath205 or @xmath215 @xcite .",
    "in @xcite we have also shown that mn codes can be divided into three categories with different equilibrium properties : ( i ) @xmath216 or @xmath217 , ( ii ) @xmath218 , @xmath215 and ( iii ) general @xmath69 , @xmath205 . in the next two subsections",
    "we will discuss these groups separately .      to show how irregularity affects codes with this choice of parameters we choose @xmath219 , @xmath220 , @xmath221 and biased messages with @xmath222 .",
    "these choices are arbitrary but can illustrate what happens with the practical decoding performance . in figure [ figurek3l3 ]",
    "we show the transition from the decoding phase to the failure phase as a function of the noise level @xmath144 for several rates @xmath0 in both regular and irregular codes .",
    "practical decoding ( @xmath223 and @xmath224 ) results are obtained for systems of size @xmath225 with a maximum number of iterations set to @xmath226 .",
    "random initial conditions are chosen and the whole process repeated @xmath227 times .",
    "the practical transition point is found when the number of failures equals the number of successes .",
    "these experiments were compared with theoretical values for @xmath214 obtained by solving the rs saddle - point equations ( [ eq : fields ] ) ( represented as @xmath228 and @xmath229 in figure [ figurek3l3 ] ) and finding the noise level for which a second solution appears . for comparison",
    "the coding limit is represented in the same figure by a full line .",
    "as the constructions used are chosen arbitrarily one can expect that these transitions can be further improved , even though the improvement shown in figure [ figurek3l3 ] is already fairly significant .    the analytical solution obtained in section [ section3 ] for @xmath216 or @xmath230 , @xmath218 and unbiased messages @xmath231 implies that the system is bistable for arbitrary code constructions when these parameters are chosen .",
    "the spinodal point noise level is then @xmath232 in this case and can not be improved by adding irregularity to the construction . up to the noise level @xmath233 the ferromagnetic solution is the global minimum of the free energy , and",
    "therefore shannon s limit is potentially saturated , however , the bistability makes these constructions unsuitable for practical decoding with a tap / bp algorithm when unbiased messages are considered .",
    "the situation improves when biased messages are used .",
    "fixing the matrices @xmath29 and @xmath31 one can determine how the spinodal point noise level @xmath214 depends on the bias @xmath143 .",
    "in figure [ figure3 ] we compare simulation results with the theoretical predictions of @xmath214 as a function of @xmath143 . the spinodal point noise level @xmath214 collapses to zero as @xmath143 increases towards the unbiased case .",
    "it obviously suggests the use of biased messages for practical use of mn codes with parameters @xmath216 or @xmath230 , @xmath218 under tap / bp decoding .",
    "for biased messages with @xmath216 or @xmath230 , @xmath218 the qualitative picture of the energy landscape differs from the unbiased coding presented in @xcite . in figure [ figure4 ] this landscape is sketched as a function of the noise level @xmath144 for a given bias . up to the spinodal point",
    "@xmath214 the landscape is totally dominated by the ferromagnetic state @xmath234 . at the spinodal point",
    "another suboptimal state @xmath235 emerges , dominating the decoding dynamics . at @xmath233",
    "the suboptimal state @xmath235 becomes the global minimum .",
    "the bold horizontal line represents the region where the ferromagnetic solution with @xmath131 dominates the decoding dynamics . in the region represented by the dashed line decoding dynamics",
    "is dominated by suboptimal @xmath236 solutions .",
    "for the remaining parameter choices , namely general @xmath69 , @xmath205 and @xmath215 , it was shown in @xcite that unbiased coding is generally possible yielding close to shannon s limit performance .",
    "the free energy landscape of the @xmath205 was shown to behave in a similar way to the one depicted in figure [ figure4 ] while the landscape of the case @xmath215 and unbiased messages shows a different behaviour where some regions include three stable states plus their mirror symmetries .    in the same way as in the @xmath216 case the practical performance",
    "is defined by the spinodal point noise level @xmath214 .",
    "the addition of irregularity also changes @xmath214 in these cases .    in the general @xmath69 ,",
    "@xmath205 family we illustrate the effect of irregularity by the choice of @xmath237 , @xmath220 and @xmath238 . in figure [ figure5 ]",
    "we show the transitions observed by performing @xmath227 decoding experiments with messages of length @xmath225 and a maximal number of iterations set to @xmath226 ( @xmath228 for regular and @xmath229 for irregular ) .",
    "we compare the experimental results with theoretical predictions based on the rs saddle - point equations ( [ eq : fields ] ) ( @xmath223 for regular and @xmath224 for irregular ) .",
    "shannon s limit is represented by a full line .",
    "the improvement is modest , what is expected since regular codes already present close to optimal performance .",
    "discrepancies between the theoretical and numerical results are due to finite size effects .",
    "we also performed a set of experiments using @xmath215 with @xmath239 and @xmath240 , the same system size @xmath225 and maximal number of decoding iterations @xmath226 .",
    "the transitions obtained experimentally and predicted by theory are shown in figure [ figure6 ] .",
    "we showed that in the thermodynamic limit mn codes are equivalent to a multi - spin ferromagnet submitted to a random field .",
    "a replica calculation shows that a phase transition from an _ errorless _ ( ferromagnetic ) phase to a _ failure _ ( either paramagnetic or suboptimal ferromagnetic ) phase occurs as the noise level increases .",
    "the phase transition line can be analytically obtained in the case where constructions with @xmath241 , a minimum of two checks per bit and unbiased messages ( @xmath231 ) are used .",
    "it coincides with shannon s coding limit and is independent of the code construction .      the practical decoding using belief propagation",
    "is shown to attain inferior performance to shannon s limit due to the collapse of the ferromagnetic basin of attraction when new states emerge at the spinodal point noise level @xmath214 .",
    "irregularity increases @xmath214 thus improving the code s performance . we show that the maximal noise level corrected by an mn code agrees with the replica theory prediction for the spinodal point noise level @xmath214 .",
    "this framework is currently being employed for optimising code constructions ( recently studied in @xcite ) , as well as for finding alternatives to the tap / bp decoding scheme and for analysing the effect of using inaccurate priors .",
