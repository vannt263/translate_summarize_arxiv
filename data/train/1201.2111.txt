    "the well - known _ constrained minimal supersymmetric standard model _ ( cmssm ) @xcite , which is a highly predictive version of the _ minimal supersymmetric standard model _ ( mssm ) based on universal boundary conditions for the soft _ supersymmetry _ ( susy ) breaking parameters , can be further restricted by being embedded in a susy _ grand unified theory _ ( gut ) with a gauge group containing @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "this can lead @xcite to ` asymptotic ' _ yukawa unification _ ( yu )  @xcite , i.e. the exact unification of the third generation yukawa coupling constants @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 of the top quark , the bottom quark , and the tau lepton , respectively , at the susy gut scale @xmath11 .",
    "the simplest gut gauge group which contains both @xmath6 and @xmath7 is the _ pati - salam _ ( ps ) group @xmath12 @xcite  for yu within @xmath13 , see refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "however , given the experimental values of the top - quark and tau - lepton masses ( which , combined with yu , naturally restrict @xmath14 ) , the cmssm supplemented by the assumption of yu yields unacceptable values of the @xmath1-quark mass @xmath15 for both signs of the parameter @xmath16 .",
    "this is due to the presence of sizable susy corrections @xcite to @xmath15 ( about 20@xmath17 ) , which arise @xcite from sbottom - gluino ( mainly ) and stop - chargino loops and have the sign of @xmath16  with the standard sign convention of ref .",
    "the predicted tree - level @xmath18 , which turns out to be close to the upper edge of its @xmath19 _ confidence level _ ( c.l . ) experimental range , receives , for @xmath0 [ @xmath20 , large positive [ negative ] corrections which drive it well above [ a little below ] the allowed range .",
    "consequently , for both signs of @xmath16 , yu leads to an unacceptable @xmath18 with the @xmath21 case being much less disfavored .",
    "the usual strategy to resolve this discrepancy is the introduction of several kinds of nonuniversalities in the scalar @xcite and/or gaugino @xcite sector of mssm with an approximate preservation of yu . on the contrary , in ref .",
    "@xcite , concrete susy gut models based on the ps gauge group are constructed which naturally yield a moderate deviation from exact yu and , thus , can allow acceptable values of the @xmath1-quark mass for both signs of @xmath16 within the cmssm . in particular , the higgs sector of the simplest ps model @xcite is extended so that the electroweak higgs fields are not exclusively contained in a @xmath22 bidoublet superfield , but receive subdominant contributions from other representations too . as a consequence ,",
    "a moderate violation of yu is naturally obtained , which can allow an acceptable @xmath1-quark mass even with universal boundary conditions .",
    "it is also remarkable that the resulting extended susy ps models support new successful versions @xcite of hybrid inflation based solely on renormalizable superpotential terms .",
    "these models provide us with a set of ` asymptotic ' yukawa quasi - unification conditions , which replace exact yu and can be applicable @xcite for both signs of the mssm parameter @xmath16 .",
    "we focus here on the @xmath0 case since @xmath21 is strongly disfavored by the constraint arising from the deviation @xmath23 of the measured value of the muon anomalous magnetic moment @xmath24 from its predicted value @xmath25 in the _ standard model _ ( sm ) .",
    "indeed , @xmath21 is defended only at 3@xmath26 by the calculation of @xmath25 based on the @xmath27-decay data which is presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , whereas there is a stronger and stronger tendency at present to prefer the @xmath28-annihilation data for the calculation of @xmath25 , which favor the @xmath0 regime .",
    "moreover , in [ jen ] , it was claimed that , after some improvements , the @xmath27-based result shifts considerably towards the @xmath28-based one .",
    "let us recall that , in this case , the suitable ` asymptotic ' yukawa quasi - unification condition applied @xcite is @xmath29 this relation depends on a single parameter @xmath30 , which is taken , for simplicity , to be real and lying in the range @xmath31 . with fixed masses for the fermions of the third generation , we can determine the parameters @xmath30 and @xmath32 so that eq .",

    "although the neutralino - stau coannihilations drastically reduce the neutralino relic abundance and , thus , enhance the upper bound on @xmath34 implied by the assumption that the neutralino is a cdm particle , they do not quite succeed to bring it to an acceptable level compatible with the lower bound on @xmath34 induced by @xmath64 .",
    "therefore ,  contrary to our findings in [ yqu ] ",
    "@xmath54 is excluded as cdm particle by the combination of the constraints from @xmath64 and cdm . as a consequence ,",
    "the model can become consistent with observations only if the lsp is a susy particle other than the neutralino",
    ". this could be the axino or the gravitino and can account for the present cdm abundance in the universe .",

    "<S> we present an updated analysis of the constrained minimal supersymmetric standard model with @xmath0 supplemented by an ` asymptotic ' yukawa coupling quasi - unification condition , which allows an acceptable @xmath1-quark mass . imposing constraints from the cold dark matter abundance in the universe , @xmath2 physics , the muon anomalous magnetic moment , and the mass @xmath3 of the lightest neutral cp - even higgs boson </S>",
    "<S> , we find that the lightest neutralino can not act as a cold dark matter candidate . </S>",
    "<S> this is mainly because the upper bound on the lightest neutralino relic abundance from cold dark matter considerations , despite the fact that this abundance is drastically reduced by neutralino - stau coannihilations , is incompatible with the recent data on the branching ratio of @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> allowing for a different particle , such as the axino or the gravitino , to be the lightest supersymmetric particle and , thus , constitute the cold dark matter in the universe , we find that the predicted @xmath3 s in our model favor the range @xmath5 . </S>"
