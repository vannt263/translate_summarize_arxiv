    "`` type-2 qso '' is a missing population of agns which are radio - quiet narrow - line qsos , i.e. , luminous cousins of seyfert 2 galaxies , or radio - quiet analogues of high - redshift radio galaxies .",
    "so - called unified scheme of seyfert galaxies explains differences between seyfert 1 and 2 galaxies with a difference of viewing angle to a nucleus surrounded by a dusty torus system @xcite .",
    "qsos are thought to be luminous versions of seyfert galaxies .",
    "if the unified scheme holds for qsos , then they should have a similar nucleus and dusty torus system in their center .",
    "seyfert 2 galaxies outnumber seyfert 1 galaxies in the local universe @xcite , and if that ratio can be extrapolated to higher luminosities , then we should expect many type-2 qsos to be detectable in the high - redshift universe .",
    "strikingly , none have been convincingly detected to date .",
    "the existence of absorbed high luminosity agn has been postulated to account for the hard x - ray spectrum of the cosmic x - ray background ; there should be three times more absorbed narrow - line qsos than non - absorbed broad - line qsos @xcite .",
    "recently , deep hard x - ray surveys with imaging satellites detect several candidates of type-2 qsos in the high - redshift universe ( @xcite ; @xcite , hereafter paper i ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "these objects have hard x - ray luminosities as luminous as broad - line qsos , and their hard x - ray spectra suggest that their x - ray nuclei are obscured . in the observed optical wavelength , they do not show the broad components in permitted emission lines , like seyfert 2 galaxies . but",
    "this evidence is insufficient to definitely identify these objects as luminous versions of seyfert 2 galaxies , because the characteristic point of seyfert 2 galaxies is that no broad h@xmath6 emission line ( above a certain level ) .",
    "therefore , in order to discuss similarities to seyfert 2 galaxies , we need to cover source - frame h@xmath6 emission line .",
    "it should be noted that majority of agns in the local universe meets this criterion @xcite . actually , for the candidate of type-2 qso found by almaini et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , later observation in the near - infrared wavelength revealed the presence of a strong broad h@xmath6 emission line and the object was reassigned as a type-1.9 qso @xcite .",
    "so far there is no hard - x - ray - selected type-2 qso which is confirmed to follow the strict definition of seyfert 2 ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "if there is no true type-2 qso in the universe , it is suggested that qsos are not simple luminous extension of seyfert galaxies .",
    "ax  j08494 + 4454  is another candidate of a type-2 qso at @xmath0 .",
    "it was found in the course of the optical identification of _ asca _ deep survey in lynx field ( paper i ) .",
    "based on the large hard x - ray luminosity , hard x - ray spectrum , which reflects a heavy absorption to the nucleus , and absence of broad h@xmath11 emission line , the object is identified as a type-2 qso ( paper i ) .",
    "later @xmath5-band spectroscopic observation targeted on the redshifted h@xmath6 emission line does not show the presence of a strong broad h@xmath6 emission line at all ( @xcite , hereafter paper ii ) .    in this paper , results of a deep hard x - ray observation with _ chandra x - ray observatory _ and a deeper near - infrared observation of a redshifted h@xmath6 emission line with subaru telescope of ax  j08494 + 4454  are reported .",
    "the x - ray spectrum of the object establishes the large absorption column density along the line of sight to the nucleus .",
    "although the previous near - infrared spectroscopy of ax  j08494 + 4454did not detect a significant broad h@xmath6 emission line , the deeper near - infrared spectrum reveals the probable existence of a very broad h@xmath6 emission line , whose strength suggests the broad - line is not affected severely by dust absorption .",
    "we discuss the discrepancy between source - frame optical and x - ray absorption and no existence of `` type-2 qsos '' . throughout this paper ,",
    "we use @xmath12 and @xmath13 km s@xmath4 mpc@xmath4 .",
    "ax  j08494 + 4454  was observed with the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ in the 0.510 kev band on 2000 may 3 ( obsid=1708 ) and may 4 through 6 ( obsid=927 ) in the course of deep observations of the lynx field ( object name = cl  0848.6 + 4453 ) .",
    "ax  j08494 + 4454  was located in the acis - i3 chip at the row number of about 800 . to mitigate the effect of degradation by the charge transfer inefficiency ( cti ) , we applied an improved technique developed by @xcite for the the level 1 event data .",
    "this improved the spectral resolution to 4.4% ( fwhm ) at 3.4 kev ( corresponding to 6.4 kev at @xmath14 ) .",
    "then the data were analyzed in a standard way using the ciao 2.1 software .",
    "we used only events of _ asca _  grade 0 , 2 , 3 , 4 , and 6 . after excluding periods of the background flares , we obtained a net exposure of 45 ksec for the may 3 observation and 119 ksec for the may 46 observation .",
    "we detected ax  j08494 + 4454  in the acis images as a point - like source from the both data sets .",
    "the position determined by _",
    "chandra _ is @xmath15 , @xmath16 ( j2000 ) , after correcting the aspect solution according to the method available at the _ chandra _ science center web page .",
    "the position error was conservatively estimated to be 1 arcsec : we confirmed the accuracy by cross correlating the position of a tyco - catalog star and other apm catalog sources located in the field of view of the acis - i arrays .",
    "the x - ray source position is @xmath17 east and @xmath18 south of the optical position , and the x - ray and optical positions agree with each other within the uncertainty .",
    "the accurate x - ray position clearly rejects the possibility that the x - ray emission comes from a no - emission - line object @xmath19 west ( see paper i and ii ) .      for an extraction of the spectrum , we accumulated events around the source position within a radius of 5 arcsec .",
    "the background spectrum was taken from a nearby , bright - source free region in the same chip .",
    "the background count rate was only 1% to the source photons in the 0.510 kev band and was not important .",
    "examining the light curve and spectrum , we found that both the flux level and spectral shape of ax  j08494 + 4454  were constant throughout the two observations within the statistical error .",
    "we thus summed the spectra of the two data sets with a total exposure of 164 ksec to obtain the best photon statistics . for a spectral fit",
    ", we used an appropriate response matrix file in which the above cti correction is taken into account . considering possible calibration uncertainties at low energies",
    ", we added a systematic error of 20% to each spectral bin below 1.2 kev .",
    "spectral analysis was performed using the xspec package .",
    "figure  [ chan_spec ] shows the _ chandra _ acis spectrum of ax  j08494 + 4454folded with the detector response . as recognized from the figure ,",
    "the x - ray spectrum is hard ; the observed flux was @xmath20 ergs @xmath2 s@xmath4(0.52 kev ) and @xmath21 ergs @xmath2 s@xmath4  ( 210 kev ) , which are consistent with the previous _ asca _  observation ( paper i ) . in the spectral fit performed below ,",
    "we assume galactic absorption with a hydrogen column density fixed at 2.6@xmath22 cm @xmath23 , as estimated from hi observations by dickey & lockman ( 1990 ) .",
    "first we fit the spectrum with a single power law continuum with an intrinsic absorption at source frame . as a result",
    ", we obtained a photon index of 1.2@xmath240.2 and a hydrogen column density of @xmath25 @xmath2 .",
    "the fit was not acceptable ( @xmath26 = 79 for the degree of freedom of 56 ) , however , leaving a soft excess below @xmath27 1.2 kev .",
    "although we have to bear in mind possible calibration uncertainties in the current response matrices , we could attribute this to the presence of a scattered and/or less absorbed component ( i.e. , partial covering model ) .",
    "such components have been observed in many of nearby seyfert  2 galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "accordingly , we fit the spectrum with two absorbed power laws with different absorptions and normalizations , represented by the formula @xmath28 $ ] , where @xmath29 is the source - frame photon energy in kev , @xmath30 is the photon index , @xmath31 is the normalization at 1 kev , @xmath32 is the photo - electric absorption cross section ( morisson & mccammon 1983 ) , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are hydrogen column densities , and @xmath35 represents the covering fraction .",
    "we find that the model can reproduce the observed continuum well .",
    "the best fit parameters are given in table  [ chan_fits ] ; the hydrogen column density is @xmath33 = @xmath36 @xmath2 and the absorption corrected source - frame 210  kev luminosity goes up to @xmath37 erg s@xmath4 with an intrinsic photon index of @xmath38 .    finally , we add an iron k emission line at the source frame , which is expected as a result of reprocessing from the x - ray absorbing matter .",
    "we here consider only a narrow line and assume a 1@xmath39 intrinsic width of 0.02 kev : this corresponds to the velocity width of @xmath40900 km s@xmath4 , which is chosen to be comparable to the widths of optical emission lines ( 600 km s@xmath4 ; paper i ) .",
    "we obtain the center energy to be 6.51@xmath240.14 kev with an equivalent width of 148@xmath41 ev at the source frame ( table  [ chan_fits ] ) .",
    "the center energy indicates that it originates from cold ( or warm ) ambient matter .",
    "the maximum allowed value for the equivalent width of the iron k line , @xmath27300 ev , rules out that the observed spectrum consists purely of a scattered or reflected component , which would produce an equivalent width of 13 kev ( e.g. , matt , brandt , and fabian 1996 ) .",
    "this gives strong evidence that a significant fraction of the observed emission comes directly from the central source .",
    "we plot the best fit model of each component in figure  [ chan_spec ] with residuals in the lower panel .",
    "the relation between the obtained source - frame equivalent width of iron - k line and the absorption column density is consistent with the presence of surrounding matter around the central source in a spherical or torus - like geometry .",
    "for example , in the simplest case that a spherical gas with a uniform density surrounds the central source , we expect an equivalent width of about 100300 ev for a column density of @xmath42 @xmath2 assuming a power law spectrum with @xmath43 ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) . for a typical obscuring torus model",
    "as defined by ghisellini , haardt and matt ( 1994 ) in their figure  1 , an iron - k emission is produced with an equivalent width of 40110 ev for @xmath44 @xmath2 when we view through the torus having an opening angle @xmath45  ( see their figure  3 ) .",
    "the source - frame equivalent width of 148@xmath41 ev is explained by this torus model having the same column densities as in the line of sight .",
    "@xmath5-band spectroscopic observations of ax  j08494 + 4454  were done with infrared camera and spectrograph ( ircs ; @xcite ) attached to subaru telescope on 21 march 2001 .",
    "a @xmath5-band grism , which covers a wavelength region from 1.18@xmath46 m to 1.38@xmath46 m with the fifth order , and a reflective slit with @xmath18 width were used .",
    "in the configuration , the spectral resolution ( @xmath47 ) was 343 and the dispersion was 3.7  pixel@xmath4 .",
    "the spatial scale was @xmath48 pixel@xmath4 , which is over - sampling under the @xmath49 seeing condition during the observations . because the seeing size was smaller than the slit width , the higher spectral resolution than @xmath47 of 343",
    "was achieved for the object .",
    "the spectra were taken at 2 positions , hereafter a and b positions , of the slit which separate 7@xmath50 apart .",
    "one set of a dithering pattern consists of four spectra taken at a , b , b , and a positions . at each position 120",
    "s integration was made and 5 dithering sets were taken .",
    "thus , the total effective integration time was 2400 s. the observation was done at the object airmass from 1.1 to 1.2 . before the observation , a field a0 type star ( sao42433 , @xmath51 mag ) was also observed at an airmass of 1.2 for the atmospheric absorption correction .    the data were reduced in the following manner ; at first from each set of a and b positions or b and a positions combinations , the b position image was subtracted from the a position image . most of night sky emission lines were removed with the process , but for the strongest night sky lines , they could not be removed completely , thus we removed the remaining night sky emissions , using the sky spectra along the slit direction . after that",
    "all a minus b images were flat fielded with a flat image which was made from subtracting images taken with a slit - illumination lamp ( halogen lamp ) off from images with the lamp on .",
    "next , all the flat - fielded images were stacked and the wavelength calibration of the stacked image was done using night sky lines in the raw object frame .",
    "the uncertainty of the wavelength calibration was 10  ( r.m.s . ) .",
    "after optimum extraction method was applied to extract one dimensional spectral data from the two dimensional stacked image , spectra taken at a position and b position were summed . atmospheric absorption and a sensitivity function",
    "were corrected using spectra of the standard star which were reduced in the same manner .",
    "flux calibration was done based on the @xmath5-band magnitude of the object as described below .    during the telescope acquisition of @xmath5-band spectroscopic observation , four images with a 45 s integration time",
    "each were also taken with the @xmath5-band filter of mauna kea observatory near - infrared filter set .",
    "for the flux calibration , three photometric standard stars were observed ( ukirt faint standard stars ; fs021[@xmath5=12.976mag ] , fs125[@xmath5=10.789mag ] , and fs127[@xmath5=11.947mag ] ) .",
    "four images of ax  j08494 + 4454  were taken at different position in the detector , thus at first we subtracted each image from another image in order to subtract sky background .",
    "after that these sky subtracted images were flat - fielded with a flat image which was made from subtracting images taken with the field - illumination lamp ( halogen lamp ) off from images with the lamp on . in each flat - fielded image ,",
    "the signal to noise ratio of the object is high , thus we measured the count rate in each image , independently .",
    "the measured count rates were consistent within 6 % .",
    "the standard star frames were reduced in the same manner .",
    "count rates of each star taken at different positions of the detector were consistent within 2 % . based on the scatter of calculated count rate to magnitude conversion factor for the 3 standard stars , the uncertainty of the flux calibration",
    "was estimated to be 0.05 mag .",
    "the measured @xmath5-band magnitude of ax  j08494 + 4454 is @xmath52 mag , and the flux calibration of the @xmath5-band spectrum was done with the @xmath5-band magnitude .",
    "the size of the object in the @xmath5-band image was fwhm of 5.9 pixel ( @xmath49 ) , which is the same as those of other stellar objects .",
    "no extended component was detected . because the slit width was wider than the object size",
    ", all parts of the object should be sampled .",
    "the @xmath5-band spectrum of the object is shown in figure  [ al12_spec ] .",
    "a strong narrow h@xmath6 emission line is detected , and it shows a shoulder in the red side , which comes from [ n  ii]@xmath536583  emission line .",
    "a continuum emission of the object is also detected .",
    "there is a weak bump at the wavelength corresponding to [ s  ii]@xmath546718,6733  emission lines .",
    "it should be noted that the [ s  ii]@xmath546718,6733  region suffers from a strong night sky emission line . the narrow - h@xmath6 line strength and the continuum flux level are consistent with those obtained in the previous @xmath5-band spectrum of ax  j08494 + 4454  ( paper ii ) .",
    "although in the previous spectrum no significant broad - h@xmath6 emission line was detected , in the continuum emission of the new @xmath5-band spectrum there is a bump in the wavelength range from 12000 to 13000 , and an existence of a broad h@xmath6 emission line is suggested .",
    "because of a low efficiency of the grism in the wavelength range below 12300  , the signal to noise ratio in the wavelength range was low , and the blue part of the broad component is uncertain . the broad component could be an artifact of an error of the sensitivity correction . in order to examine whether the broad h@xmath6 emission line is due to an error of the sensitivity correction ,",
    "we apply the sensitivity function which is used to the spectrum of ax  j08494 + 4454  to a spectrum of a bright g5v type star taken in the next night of the observation of ax  j08494 + 4454 .",
    "the corrected spectrum of the star is consistent with the model spectrum of a g5v type star @xcite within 10% in the wavelength range above 12000 , and we expect that the broad h@xmath6 feature is not due to an error of the sensitivity correction . it should be noted that the probable broad emission line has a much larger velocity width ( @xmath55 km s@xmath4 ) than that assumed in figure  1 of paper ii ( 3000 km s@xmath4 ) .    in order to determine the strength and the velocity width of these narrow and broad emission lines , fitting to the obtained spectrum with the @xmath56 minimization method",
    "is applied in the wavelength range from 12300 to 13500 . in the fitting",
    ", we assume that all the redshifts for the narrow - h@xmath6 , broad - h@xmath6 , narrow-[n  ii]@xmath546548,6583 , and narrow-[s  ii]@xmath546718,6733  emissions are the same , and the velocity widths of the narrow - emission lines are also the same . the flux ratio between [ n  ii]@xmath536548  and [ n  ii]@xmath536583  is fixed .",
    "the best - fit wavelengths , fluxes , and velocity widths of each emission lines are summarized in table  [ tab_emi ] and the result of the fitting is shown in figures 1b and 1c .",
    "one sigma uncertainties of each free parameters are listed also .",
    "all of the uncertainties of emission line fluxes are dominated by @xmath5-band photometry uncertainty , except for the flux of [ s  ii]@xmath546718,6733  emission lines .",
    "the resulting redshift of the narrow - h@xmath6 emission line is @xmath57 , which agrees with that obtained in the optical spectrum ( @xmath58 ; paperi ) and obtained in the previous @xmath5-band spectrum ( @xmath59 ; paper ii ) .",
    "the spectral resolution measured with night sky emission lines in the frame is fwhm of 30 , which corresponds to 8 pixel and @xmath60 in the spatial direction .",
    "resolution for the object emission line should be higher than that of the night sky lines because the fwhm of the object ( @xmath49 ) is smaller than the slit width in the spatial direction . considering the fwhm difference between the object and the slit images",
    ", we estimated the resolution for the object to be 22  , which corresponds to 533 km s@xmath4 . using this value as instrumental broadening , we estimated intrinsic velocity widths of narrow- and broad - emission lines to be fwhm of @xmath61 and @xmath7 km s@xmath4 , respectively .",
    "the probable existence of the strong broad h@xmath6 emission line and non - detection of a broad h@xmath11 emission line suggest ax  j08494 + 4454  is similar to seyfert 1.9 galaxies .",
    "however , the width of the broad balmer emission line corresponds to the smallest value of high - luminosity radio - quiet qsos ( @xmath62 mag ) , and is the largest value of low - luminosity radio - quiet qsos ( @xmath63 mag ) @xcite .",
    "interpolating the two samples of radio - quiet qsos , we expect that the velocity width of ax  j08494 + 4454  is consistent with qsos with @xmath64 of about @xmath65 mag .",
    "therefore , the large velocity width of the broad - line of ax  j08494 + 4454  suggests that the object has a high - luminosity qso nucleus in its center .",
    "the narrow - line width is consistent with that of narrow-[o  iii]@xmath535007  emission line in the optical wavelength ( 600 km s@xmath4 ; paper i ) and that of typical values of narrow - line region of seyfert galaxies @xcite .",

    "this is @xmath79 mag brighter than that estimated from the optical spectrum ( 20.3 mag ; paper i ) .",
    "the discrepancy can be due to an underestimate of the object brightness in paper i , because the slit might not have been centered on the object . in the @xmath66- , @xmath67- , and @xmath47-band images , ax  j08494",
    "+ 4454  has slightly larger image size ( fwhm of 5.1 pixel ) than stellar objects in each frame ( fwhm of 4.4 pixel ) . in the @xmath68-band ,",
    "the image is elongated by a guiding error , no measurement on the image size was made .",
    "the hard x - ray and narrow - emission line properties of ax  j08494 + 4454are consistent with those of seyfert 2 galaxies .",
    "its x - ray spectrum can be fit with an absorbed power law with a column density of @xmath80 @xmath2 at the source frame .",
    "the results on the x - ray spectrum generally agree with the picture of the unified scheme for type-2 agns @xcite , except that the intrinsic 210 kev luminosity ( @xmath81 ergs s@xmath4 ) is larger than those of nearby seyfert 2 galaxies .",
    "the hard x - ray to [ o  iii]@xmath535007  luminosity ratio of the ax  j08494 + 4454  follows the extension of those of seyfert 1 and 2 galaxies ( @xcite ) .    the probable existence of the strong h@xmath6 broad - emission line conflicts with the large x - ray absorption , which corresponds to @xmath8 of @xmath82 mag with galactic extinction curve and gas - to - dust ratio .",
    "in order to quantitatively examine the discrepancy , we estimated the amount of dust absorption to the broad - line region with three indicators ; balmer decrements , hard x - ray to h@xmath6 luminosity ratio , and shape of optical continuum emission .    we can only put lower limit on the balmer decrement of ax  j08494 + 4454 because broad h@xmath11 emission line was not detected in the optical spectrum ( paper i ) . the upper limit on the flux of the broad h@xmath11 emission line with the velocity width of 9400 km s@xmath4 is @xmath83 erg s@xmath4 @xmath2 .",
    "thus , the lower limit on the balmer decrement to the broad - line region is 4.8 , and we obtain the lower limit on the absorption to the nucleus as @xmath8 of 1.2 mag , assuming that an intrinsic balmer decrement is the typical value in broad - line qsos ( 3.1 ; @xcite ) , and the nuclear absorption follows the galactic extinction curve .    based on the relation between hard x - ray and h@xmath6 luminosity , the luminosity of the broad h@xmath6 emission of object with hard x - ray luminosity of @xmath3 erg s@xmath4 @xmath2 , should be @xmath84 erg s@xmath4 @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the measured h@xmath6 flux corresponds to h@xmath6 luminosity of @xmath85 erg s@xmath4 @xmath2 , which falls within the above range .",
    "the upper limit on the absorption to the h@xmath6 emission is estimated to be @xmath86 of 2.7 mag , that is converted to @xmath8 of 3.4 mag with the galactic extinction curve .",
    "the reddening to the nucleus is also estimated from the shape of optical and near infra - red continuum emission , if the optical continuum is dominated by the reddened nuclear emission .",
    "ax  j08494 + 4454  has a red @xmath87 color and , there are three possibilities to the origin of the red color : reddened nuclear continuum , old stellar population of host galaxy , and reddened young stellar population . in figure",

    "the average qso colors have scatter of about 0.2 mag ( r.m.s . )",
    "@xcite . for galaxy models ,",
    "two galaxy color evolution models are plotted ( kodama , arimoto 1997 ) : 1 ) elliptical model ( plotted with a solid line ) in which star formation occurs during the first 0.353 gyr with an initial mass function with a slope of 1.20 ; after that the galaxy evolves passively .",
    "the model parameters well reproduce the reddest and brightest ( @xmath91 mag ) class elliptical galaxy in the coma cluster ( kodama et al .",
    "2 ) disk model ( plotted with a dotted line ) is used in which star formation occurs constantly with the same initial - mass function as that in the elliptical model .",
    "the colors of these models at redshift of 0.9 with ages from 0.01 gyr to 5 gyr , which corresponds to the age of the universe at the redshift , are shown with tracks .",
    "the colors of the reddened ( @xmath92 mag ) average qso spectrum ( filled triangles ) are close to the observed colors of ax  j08494 + 4454 .",
    "while ax  j08494 + 4454  does not have as red color as old elliptical model in @xmath89 color , which reflects the size of 4000 break at the redshift of 0.9 , thus an old stellar population can not be the origin of the optical continuum .",
    "considering the direction of reddening vector , we can also reject the possibility that an absorbed young stellar population makes the red color of ax  j08494 + 4454 .",
    "therefore , the reddened nuclear continuum is the most plausible origin of the red optical to near infrared colors .",
    "the @xmath5-band spectrum of ax  j08494 + 4454  also supports the model , because the source frame equivalent width of the broad h@xmath6 line ( 380@xmath93  ) is similar to those of broad - line qsos ( @xmath94  , @xcite ) , and contamination from stellar continuum emission should be negligible in the @xmath5-band .",
    "on the other hand , the optical images of ax  j08494 + 4454  are slightly extended . from deconvolution of an @xmath68-band image of ax",
    "j08494 + 4454 the contribution of the host galaxy to the total light is estimated to be @xmath95% ( paper ii ) .",
    "there are @xmath96 mag discrepancy between the colors of ax  j08494",
    "+ 4454  and the @xmath92 mag absorbed qso model , and the colors of ax  j08494 + 4454  are shifted to the tracks of the galaxy models .",
    "the discrepancy can be due to the contamination of the host galaxy component .",
    "the overall spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of ax  j08494 + 4454  is also consistent with a qso sed affected with @xmath8 of 1 mag in the optical wavelength . in figure  [ al12_sed ] , the energy densities at 8  kev , 4  kev , @xmath66- , @xmath67- , @xmath68- , @xmath97-bands ( paper ii ) and 1.4 ghz @xcite are plotted with an average radio - quiet qso sed taken from @xcite . in the hard x - ray range , we plotted the intrinsic power - law component determined by the x - ray spectral fitting .",
    "@xmath98 survey upper limits ( paper i ) are also plotted with downward arrows .",
    "the average qso sed is normalized to have the same energy density with ax  j08494 + 4454  at 1.4 ghz .",
    "the faint optical magnitudes are explained well with average qso spectrum affected by @xmath8 of 1 mag in the optical wavelength ( upper dashed line in figure  [ al12_sed ] ) .    to summarize the optical extinction estimations , the extinction to the nucleus is estimated to be @xmath8 of @xmath9 mag from the strength of broad h@xmath6 line , and the extinction is consistent with the optical colors and the overall sed of ax  j08494 + 4454 .",
    "the estimated amount of absorption is significantly smaller than that expected from the x - ray absorption .",
    "the estimated @xmath99 value of ax  j08494 + 4454  is @xmath100 mag @xmath2 , and more than 20 times smaller than those measured in the galaxy ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "similar discrepancy of values between absorption from broad balmer ( or paschen)-line ratio and from x - ray spectrum is reported for objects with @xmath101 @xmath2 and with broad - balmer and/or paschen lines ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in seyfert 2",
    "galaxies , the amount of absorption determined from @xmath102-band reddening is also much smaller than the expected absorption derived from the hard x - ray observation ( @xcite ) .",
    "similar discrepancy is reported even in the line of sight to the galactic center ( @xcite ) .",
    "the discrepancy can be explained with a smaller dust to gas mass ratio which may due to dust sublimation in the x - ray absorbing matter , the size difference between optical and x - ray emitting region , or different dust size distribution in agns ( @xcite ) .",
    "in hard - x - ray - selected heavily - absorbed agns , there may be a discrepancy of amount of dust reddening between seyfert galaxies and qsos .",
    "ax  j08494 + 4454  has the hardest x - ray spectrum in the x - ray sources detected in the lynx field with _",
    "chandra _ , and it is confirmed that the object is affected by the heavy x - ray absorption , but ax  j08494 + 4454  probably has broad h@xmath6 emission as strong as normal qsos .",
    "in contrast , very hard x - ray sources detected in wider area _",
    "surveys are identified with low - redshift seyfert 2 galaxies that do not show strong broad h@xmath6 emission line at all @xcite .",
    "their estimated amounts of x - ray absorption are similar to that of ax  j08494 + 4454 but their h@xmath6 emission lines are much more affected by dust extinction than in ax  j08494 + 4454 .",
    "the discrepancy between the high - redshift qso and the low - redshift seyferts may suggest that x - ray luminous qsos have different internal structure from low - luminosity seyfert galaxies : on average , qsos have smaller @xmath99 value than low - luminous seyfert galaxies , and qsos are less affected by dust reddening .",
