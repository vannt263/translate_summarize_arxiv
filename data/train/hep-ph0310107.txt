    "large - scale neutrino telescopes @xcite have as a main goal the detection of ultrahigh - energy ( uhe ) cosmic neutrinos ( @xmath9 @xmath10 ) produced outside the atmosphere ( neutrinos produced by galactic cosmic rays interacting with interstellar gas , and extragalactic neutrinos ) @xcite .",
    "uhe neutrinos can be detected by observing long - range muons produced in charged - current neutrino - nucleon interactions . a very enlightening discussion on uhe neutrino interactions is given by r. gandhi _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite .",
    "the detection of uhe neutrinos will provide us with the possibility to observe @xmath11-collisions with a neutrino energy in the range @xmath12 and a target nucleon at rest .",
    "earlier estimations of the @xmath0 production rates in @xmath11-scattering were given in 1970 , by h. h. chen @xcite , and by j. reiff @xcite , in 1971 by r. w. brown and j. smith @xcite , and by f. a. berends and g. b. west @xcite .",
    "in those works the calculations were made using neither the standard model @xcite nor the parton model @xcite .",
    "one of the aims of detecting uhe neutrinos is to look for physics beyond @xcite the standard model @xcite .",
    "however , the event rates for most of the exotic processes could be of the same order as the event rates for heavy gauge boson production in @xmath11-scattering .",
    "hence , even though the cross sections for heavy boson production are expected not to be large enough to allow for detailed investigations of the heavy bosons properties , it is necessary to calculate them . only if heavy boson production , which could be an important background for physics beyond the standard model , is completely known and subtracted from the exotic event rates , the new physics could be investigated .",
    "therefore , we discuss in this paper heavy vector boson production in the deep inelastic @xmath13-scattering within the frame of the standard model @xmath14 of the strong and electroweak interactions and using the parton model @xcite with the parton distribution functions reported by j. pumplin _",
    "we use the cteq pdfs provided in a @xmath15 active flavours scheme .",
    "the cross section for the process @xmath16 is expected to be the most important one because it gets contributions from photon exchange diagrams ( see figs .",
    "2.1 - 2.5 ) .",
    "we thus present results for the total cross section for @xmath17 production through the processes @xmath18 as a function of the neutrino energy in the range @xmath19 , in order to use the cteq pdfs in the range of the ( @xmath20 ) parameter space in which these have been found to be valid : @xmath21 and @xmath22 and taking @xmath6 for the nucleon .",
    "we also calculate @xmath7 to find out how it compares to @xmath23 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we provide the expressions for the kinematics of the production of a massive vector bosons in deep inelastic neutrino - nucleon scattering and discuss the influence of setting cuts on the phase space of the produced particles . in section iii , we perform the explicit calculation of the matrix elements and the differential cross section for polarized scattering .",
    "we present and discuss our results for the total cross section for the case of @xmath17 production in section iv .",
    "finally , section v contains a summary of our conclusions .",
    "in this section we will discuss the kinematics and phase space of the production of a heavy vector boson @xmath24 through the inclusive processes @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 stand for the incoming neutrino , the target nucleon , the final lepton ( @xmath28 or @xmath29 ) and the produced massive boson , respectively .",

    "the following construction is chosen : @xmath34    as usual we define the invariants : @xmath35 and the dimensionless variables : @xmath36 the physical region of these kinematical variables is obtained by requiring that the scalar products of any two particle four - momenta be positive ,",

    "inequality ( 10 ) can be used to replace ( 6 ) by the more stringent relations : @xmath54 the expressions given in ( 8) , ( 9 ) and ( 11 ) define the physical region for the dimensionless variables @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath46 .",
    "we have taken all fermion masses to be zero , this implies that in the calculation of the total cross section the integration over the momentum transfer square extends up to zero .",
    "hence , we have no natural regulator for the contribution of the photon - exchange diagrams .",
    "this is one of the reasons why we need cuts on @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "another reason is that the parton distributions can be used only when @xmath59 and @xmath60 are not too small .",
    "furthermore , in order to separate deep inelastic from elastic scattering , a cut on the invariant mass @xmath0 of the unobserved particles in the final state is required .",
