    "it leaves enough flexibility to to reveal key behaviors in terms of phase transitions .",
    "it would be easy to remove it at the price of an increased technicality .",

    "we will see that we can observe a wealth of phenomena , including hysteresis .",
    "the purpose of this note is to summarize the analytical results , as well as some numerical simulations which illustrate this phenomena .",
    "all the proofs are detailed in  @xcite , where   arises as the spatially homogeneous version of a space - dependent kinetic equation , obtained as the mean - field limit of a self - propelled particle system interacting through alignment .",

    "we first state results about existence , uniqueness , positivity and regularity of the solutions of  . under hypothesis  [ hyp - regularity ] , we have the following    [ theorem - existence - uniqueness ] given an initial finite non - negative measure  @xmath38 in  @xmath39 , there exists a unique weak solution  @xmath10 of   such that  @xmath40 .",
    "this solution is global in time .",
    "moreover ,  @xmath41 , with  @xmath42 for all positive  @xmath43 , and we have the following instantaneous regularity and uniform boundedness estimates ( for  @xmath44 , the constant  @xmath45 being independent of  @xmath10 ) , for all  @xmath46 : @xmath47    for later usage , we define  @xmath48 as an anti - derivative of  @xmath49 :  @xmath50 . in this case , the dynamics of   corresponds to the gradient flow of the following free energy functional : @xmath51 indeed , if we define the dissipation term  @xmath52 by @xmath53 we get the following conservation relation : @xmath54      we now define the von mises distribution which provides the general shape of the non - isotropic equilibria of  @xmath35 .",

    "the case  @xmath62 corresponds to the uniform distribution , while when  @xmath63 is large ( or  @xmath58 is close to  @xmath64 ) , the von mises distribution is closed to a dirac delta mass at the point  @xmath65 .",
    "some comments are necessary about the interval of definition of  @xmath33 .",
    "first note that , under hypothesis  [ hyp - regularity ] ,  @xmath49 is defined from  @xmath66 , with values in an interval  @xmath67 , where we may have  @xmath68 .",
    "so  @xmath33 is an increasing function from  @xmath67 onto  @xmath69 .",
    "moreover , for later usage , we can define @xmath70 where  @xmath71 may be equal to  @xmath72 , and where we recall that  @xmath73 denotes the dimension .",
    "the equilibria are given by the following proposition :    [ prop - equilibria ] the following statements are equivalent :    1 .",
    "@xmath74 and  @xmath75 .",
    "2 .   @xmath76 and  @xmath77 .",
    "3 .   there exists  @xmath78 and  @xmath55 such that  @xmath79 , where  @xmath56 satisfies the compatibility equation : @xmath80    let us first remark that the uniform distribution , corresponding to  @xmath81 is always an equilibrium .",
    "indeed , we have  @xmath82 and   is satisfied",
    ". however , proposition  [ prop - equilibria ] does not provide any information about the number of the non - isotropic equilibria .",
    "indeed , equation   can be recast into : @xmath83 which is valid as long as  @xmath84 .",

    "so since  @xmath88 as  @xmath86 ( see for instance  @xcite ) , we have the two following results ( also valid in the case  @xmath89 ) : @xmath90 we deduce that this function reaches its maximum , and we define @xmath91 for  @xmath92 , the only solution to the compatibility condition is  @xmath81 , and the only equilibrium is the uniform distribution  @xmath93 . except from these facts",
    ", we have no further direct information of this function  @xmath94 , since  @xmath95 and  @xmath33 are both increasing .",
    "figure  [ fig - shapes ] depicts some examples of the possible shapes of the function  @xmath94 .",
    "we see that depending on the value of  @xmath28 , the number of families of non - isotropic equilibria , given by the number of positive solutions of the equation  , can be zero , one , two or even more .",
    "we now turn to the study of the stability of these equilibria , through the study of the rates of convergence .",
    "the main tool to prove convergence of the solution to a steady state is lasalle s principle , that we recall here ( the proof follows exactly the lines of  @xcite ) . by the conservation relation  , we know that the free energy  @xmath96 is decreasing in time ( and bounded from below since  @xmath97 is bounded ) .",
    "lasalle s principle states that the limiting value of  @xmath96 corresponds to an  @xmath98-limit set of equilibria :    [ prop - lasalle]lasalle s invariance principle .",
    "let  @xmath38 be a positive measure on the sphere  @xmath3 .",
    "we denote by  @xmath99 the limit of  @xmath100 as  @xmath101 , where  @xmath10 is the solution to the modified smoluchowski equation   with initial condition  @xmath38 .",
    "then the set  @xmath102 is not empty .",
    "furthermore  @xmath103 converges in any  @xmath104 norm to this set of equilibria ( in the following sense ) : @xmath105    since we know the types of equilibria , we can refine this principle to adapt it to our problem :    [ prop - lasalle - refined ]    let  @xmath38 be a positive measure on the sphere  @xmath3 , with initial mass  @xmath28 .",
    "if no open interval is included in the set  @xmath106 , then there exists a solution  @xmath107 to the compatibility solution   such that we have : @xmath108    this last proposition helps us to characterize the  @xmath98-limit set by studying the single compatibility equation  .",
    "when  @xmath81 is the unique solution , then this gives us that  @xmath10 converges to the uniform distribution .",
    "otherwise , two cases are possible , either  @xmath109 , and  @xmath10 converges to the uniform distribution , or  @xmath110 , and the only unknown behavior is the one of  @xmath111 .",
    "if we are able to prove that it converges to  @xmath112 , then  @xmath10 converges to a fixed non - isotropic steady - state  @xmath113 .    however , proposition  [ prop - lasalle - refined ] does not give information about quantitative rates of convergence of  @xmath27 to  @xmath114 , and of  @xmath115 to  @xmath116 , as  @xmath101 .",
    "so we now turn to the study of the behavior of the difference between the solution  @xmath10 and a target equilibrium  @xmath117 .",
    "this study consists in two types of expansion .",
    "if we expand the solution around the uniform equilibrium , some simple energy estimates give us exponential convergence when  @xmath118 .",
    "but when we expand the solution around a non - isotropic equilibrium  @xmath117 , we see that the condition of stability is related to the monotonicity of the function  @xmath94 .",
    "hence we can see directly on the graph of this function ( see examples on figure  [ fig - shapes ] ) both the number of family of equilibria and their stability : if the function is decreasing , the family is stable . by contrast",
    "it is unstable when the function is increasing .",
    "when the difference between  @xmath10 and  @xmath117 converges exponentially fast to  @xmath116 ( on the stable branch ) , we are able to control the displacement of  @xmath119 , which gives convergence to  @xmath112 .",
    "we then have convergence of  @xmath10 to a given equilibrium@xmath113 .",
    "all these results are summarized in the following two theorems . in what follows , we say that a constant is a universal constant when it does not depend on the initial condition  @xmath38 ( that is to say , it depends only on  @xmath28 ,  @xmath73 and the coefficients of the equation  @xmath14 and  @xmath15 , and on the exponent  @xmath120 of the sobolev space  @xmath104 in which the result is stated ) .",
    "we have the following instability and exponential stability results around the uniform equilibrium : [ thm - uniform ]    * suppose that  @xmath118 .",
    "we define @xmath121 there exists a universal constant  @xmath45 , such that if  @xmath122 , then for all  @xmath1 , we have @xmath123 * if  @xmath124 , and if  @xmath125 , then we can not have  @xmath109 in proposition  [ prop - lasalle - refined ] : the solution can not converge to the uniform equilibrium .    to study the stability around a non - isotropic equilibrium , we fix  @xmath28 , and we denote by  @xmath63 a positive solution to the compatibility equation ( we will not write the dependence of  @xmath95 and  @xmath33 on  @xmath63 when there is no possible confusion )",
    ". we denote by  @xmath126 the value of  @xmath127 ( independent of  @xmath55 ) .",

    "then any equilibrium of the form  @xmath138 is unstable , in the following sense : in any neighborhood of  @xmath138 , there exists an initial condition  @xmath38 such that  @xmath139 .",
    "consequently , in that case , we can not have  @xmath140 in proposition  [ prop - lasalle - refined ] .",
    "let us now focus on the case where we always have  @xmath141 for all  @xmath142 ( see for example the lowest two curves of figure  [ fig - shapes ] ) . in this case , the compatibility equation   has a unique positive solution for  @xmath124 . with the results of the previous subsection about stability and rates of convergence",
    ", we obtain the behavior of the solution for any initial condition  @xmath38 with initial mass  @xmath28 .    *",

    "its solution converges exponentially fast to the uniform distribution , but this solution is not stable under small perturbation of the initial condition .",
    "let us remark that for some particular choice of the coefficients , as in  @xcite , it is also possible to get an algebraic rate of convergence in the second case  @xmath144 .",
    "for example when  @xmath150 , we have  @xmath151 for  @xmath43 sufficiently large .",
    "so we can describe the phase transition phenomena by studying the order parameter of the asymptotic equilibrium  @xmath152 , as a function of the initial density  @xmath28 .",

    "so we expect that the solution stays close to it , until  @xmath28 reaches the critical value  @xmath215 . for  @xmath124 , the only stable equilibria are the von mises distributions , and the solution converges to one of these equilibria .",

    "the only problem with this approach is that the solution converges so strongly to the uniform distribution for  @xmath118 , so after passing  @xmath215 , the linear rate of explosion for  @xmath224 is given by  @xmath225 , and is very slow when  @xmath28 is close to  @xmath215 .",
    "so since @xmath224 is initially very small when passing the threshold  @xmath144 we would have to wait extremely long in order to see the convergence to the stable von mises distribution . to overcome this problem , we adding a threshold  @xmath226 and strengthen  @xmath227 when  @xmath228 , by @xmath229 we note that this transformation that we still have  @xmath228 if it was the case before applying the transformation .",
    "figure  [ fig - numerics - kinetic-2d ] depicts the result of a numerical simulation with a threshold  @xmath230 .",
    "we clearly see this hysteresis cycle , which agrees very well with the theoretical diagram .",
    "the jumps at  @xmath189 and  @xmath144 are closer to the theoretical jumps when  @xmath231 is very large .",
    "we were not able to see any numerical significance of the value  @xmath232 ( for which uniform and non - isotropic distributions have the same free energy ) in all these numerical simulations .",
    "in particular ,  @xmath232 is close to  @xmath218 ( see figure  [ fig - free - energy ] ) , so in most of the cases where both uniform and non - isotropic distribution are stable , the uniform distribution is not the global minimizer of the free energy , but in practical , meta - stability is very strong , and the solution still converges to the uniform distribution .",
    "in this note , we have given the summary of strong results on the stability and instability of the equilibrium states of the modified smoluchowski equation  .",
    "this allows to have a precise description of the dynamics of the solution when time goes to infinity : it converges exponentially fast to a fixed equilibrium , with explicit formulas for the rates of convergence .",
    "we have also exhibited a specific example in which we observe a first order phase transition with a hysteresis loop ( in contrast with the second order phase transition of the original smoluchowski equation with dipolar potential  @xcite ) .",
    "the details of the proofs will be found in a longer paper  @xcite as well as numerical comparisons between the particle and kinetic models to confirm that the hysteresis is really intrinsic to the system and not simply an artifact of the kinetic modeling ."
