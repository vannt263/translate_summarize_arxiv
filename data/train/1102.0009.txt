    "this presents a window of opportunity for observing new physics ( np ) effects in this mode .",
    "this topic is particularly timely in view of experimental indications of np effects in both the exclusive decay @xmath8  @xcite ( for recent cdf results , also see ref .",
    "@xcite ) as well as the inclusive like - sign dimuon asymmetry observed in @xmath9  @xcite .",

    "( [ bmm ] ) ) is expected to markedly improve the current branching fraction bound .",
    "our strategy in this paper is somewhat reminiscent of our recent study  @xcite noting that in some np models the @xmath12 mixing and @xmath13 decay amplitudes have a common dependence on the np parameters .",
    "if so , one can predict the @xmath13 branching fraction in terms of the observed @xmath14 provided that much or all of the mixing is attributed to np .",
    "this is a viable possibility for @xmath12 mixing because the standard model ( sm ) signal has large theoretical uncertainties and because many np models can produce the observed mixing  @xcite .",
    "for @xmath0 the situation is very different . here , the sm prediction is in accord with the observed value ( _ e.g. _ see refs .   and papers cited therein ) .",
    "in fact , the analysis described below ( _ cf . _",
    "see eqs .",
    "( [ av - np]),([av - onesig ] ) ) gives @xmath15 , which demonstrates just how well the sm prediction agrees with the experimental value of @xmath0 . in view of this",
    ", our sm expression for @xmath0 will be given at nlo   whereas lo results will suffice for np models . as regards the corresponding width difference @xmath16 , the experimental and theoretical uncertainties are still rather significant ( _ viz _ sect .",
    "ii - c ) .    in those np models where mixing and @xmath5 arise from a common set of parameters , the severe constraint on any np signal to @xmath2 mixing places strong bounds on its contribution to @xmath17 .",
    "in fact , we shall find the constraint can be so strong that for some np models the predicted @xmath5 branching fraction lies well below the sm prediction .",
    "the first step in our study ( _ cf _   section",
    "ii ) will be to revisit the sm predictions for mixing in the @xmath18-quark system by using up - to - date inputs .",
    "we carry this out for the two mixing quantities @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the former in turn yields phenomenological bounds on np mixing contributions which in certain models can be used to bound the magnitude of the @xmath4 decay mode .",
    "we also update the sm branching fraction for @xmath4 by using the observed @xmath2 mixing as input .",
    "then , in section iii we discuss general properties of np models with tree - level amplitudes . in section iv , we explore various np models such as extra @xmath19 bosons , family symmetry , r - parity violating supersymmetry , flavor - changing higgs models , and models with the fourth sequential generation .",
