    "fiber bragg gratings ( fbg ) are microstructured optical fibers that present a spatially periodic variation of the refractive index .",
    "the combination of the guiding properties of the periodic media with the kerr nonlinearity of the fiber results in the very particular light propagation characteristic of these elements , which make them very promising for many technological applications that range from optical communications ( wavelength division , dispersion management , optical buffers and storing devices , etc . ) to fiber sensing ( structural stress measure in aircraft components and buildings , temperature change detection , etc . ) , see , e.g. , the recent review @xcite .",
    "the amplitude equations that are commonly used in the literature to model one dimensional light propagation in a fbg are the so - called nonlinear coupled mode equations ( nlcme ) @xcite , * * * * which , conveniently scaled , can be written as@xmath0 where @xmath1 are the envelopes of the two counterpropagating wavetrains that resonate with the grating , @xmath2 is the strength of the coupling effect produced by the grating and @xmath3 is ratio of the self to cross nonlinear interaction coefficient ( @xmath4 for a cubic kerr nonlinearity @xcite ) .",
    "the nlcme can be obtained from the full maxwell - lorentz equations using multiple scales techniques in the limit of small grating depth , small light intensity and slow spatial and temporal dependence of the field envelopes ( see @xcite for a detailed description of this derivation process ) .",
    "it has been recently shown @xcite that light propagation in fbg can develop dispersive structures that are not accounted for in the nlcme formulation , and that , to correctly describe the weakly nonlinear dynamics of the system , the nlcme have to be completed with material dispersion terms:@xmath5 the dispersive nonlinear coupled mode equations above ( nlcmed ) are scaled as the nlcme : the characteristic length scale is the slow scale that results from the balance of the advection term with the small effect of the grating , the characteristic time is the corresponding transport time scale ( which sets to one the scaled group velocity ) , and the characteristic size of the wavetrains is the resulting one from the saturation of the small nonlinear terms .",
    "the slow envelope assumption forces the dispersive terms to be always small as compared with the advection terms ; in other words , second derivatives of the slow amplitudes are much smaller than first derivatives . in the scaled equations",
    "this effect is contained in the scaled dispersion coefficient @xmath6 ( which measures the dispersion to transport ratio ) and therefore , in order to be consistent with the slow envelope assumption , the nlcmed must be considered in the limit @xmath7 .",
    "the nlcmed can be somehow regarded as asymptotically nonuniform , in the sense that the nlcmed is an asymptotic model obtained in the @xmath7 ( weakly nonlinear , slow envelope ) limit that still contains the small parameter @xmath6 .",
    "this is the unavoidable consequence of simultaneously considering two balances of different asymptotic order : one induced by the dominant effect of the transport at the group velocity ( balance described by nlcme ) and a second one that is associated with the underlying dispersive , nonlinear schrdinger - like dynamics of the system .",
    "the small dispersive terms in the nlcmed are essential to describe the dynamics of the system when it develops small dispersive scales @xmath8 .",
    "as it was shown in @xcite , the nlcmed in the @xmath7 limit constitute a singular perturbation problem ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) and the onset of the dispersive scales is not a higher order , longer time effect ; it takes place in the same timescale of the nlcme , no matter how small is the dispersion coefficient @xmath9 .",
    "a solution of the nlcmed for @xmath10 that exhibits small dispersive scales all over the domain is represented in figure  [ fig : xtchaos1 ] : note that , for short time , the dispersive structures just propagate with the group velocity but , for @xmath11 , they also interact with each other giving rise to a very complicated spatio - temporal pattern .",
    "the initial condition used in this simulation was a uniform modulus solution with a small random perturbation that , according to the dispersion - less nlcme formulation , was a stable solution . in order ensure that the small scales in figure  [ fig : xtchaos1 ] are dispersion induced scales we have repeated the nlcmed simulation but with a reduced dispersion @xmath12 .",
    "the result is plotted in figure  [ fig : xtchaos2 ] where it can be seen that the small scales fill again the entire domain , but its typical size , @xmath8 , is now approximately one half of that in figure  [ fig : xtchaos1 ] ( see also the corresponding animations ` movie1.1.gif ` and ` movie1.2.gif ` ) .",

    "see the file ` movie1.2.gif ` for an animation of the onset of the dispersive scales . ]",
    "the main goal of this paper is to show that , in addition to complex spatio - temporal patterns , the dispersion effects can also give rise to new , purely dispersive localized states , which might be of interest from the optical communications point of view .",
    "it is interesting to note that the results in this paper apply also to bose - einstein condensates in optical lattices ( a system that has recently received very much attention @xcite ) and , in general , to any dissipation - less propagative system , extended in one spatial direction , reflection and translation invariant , and with a small superimposed spatial periodic modulation of its background , since the nlcmed are the appropriate envelope equations for the description of the weakly nonlinear resonant dynamics of this kind of systems .    in order to show that light propagation in a fbg can happen in the form of dispersive pulses , we derive and solve numerically in section 2 an asymptotic equation for a family of symmetric pulses , and , in section 3",
    ", we perform some numerical integrations of the complete nlcmed to show that some of the pulses in this family do propagate as stable localized structures .",
    "finally , some concluding remarks are drawn in section 4 .",
    "the starting point is the continuous wave ( cw ) family of constant uniform modulus solutions of the nlcme ( [ eq : nlcme+])-([eq : nlcme- ] )    @xmath15    where @xmath16 is the light intensity flowing through the fiber , @xmath17",

    "we now look for localized dispersive pulses propagating on top of one of the amplitudes of a stable cw , as sketched in figure  [ fig : sketchpulse ] . in order to turn the background cw into a constant ,",
    "it is convenient to first perform in the nlcmed the following change of variables@xmath21 to obtain@xmath22 a localized dispersive pulse on @xmath23 depends on the fast spatial scale @xmath24 and , according to ( [ eq : f+])-([eq : f- ] ) , in the short time scale , @xmath25 , it just propagates with the group velocity , suggesting that we have to look for solutions of the form @xmath26 with @xmath27 . inserting the above ansatz into ( [ eq : f+])-([eq : f- ] )",
    "yields@xmath28 which means that @xmath29 remains in first approximation equal to the unperturbed cw .",
    "similarly , the following equation is obtained for @xmath30@xmath31 where the @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) sign corresponds to @xmath6 positive ( negative ) , together with the boundary conditions@xmath34 which ensure that the background cw is recovered away from the pulse .    for dispersive pulses propagating over a zero background we have to set to zero @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 in eq .",

    "a standard nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equation is then obtained , which is known to exhibit localized pulses ( solitons ) in the focusing case of positive dispersion ( recall that @xmath3 ) .",

    "the only nonzero fourier spectrum components of these nls solitons correspond , in first approximation , to very large dispersive wavenumbers ( @xmath38 ) that are so off - resonance that they simply do not feel the grating .",
