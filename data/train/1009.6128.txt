    "it is well - known that phase transitions can only occur in systems with infinitely many degrees of freedom . for example , the ising model in a finite volume does not display a transition , however using finite size scaling theory @xcite one can obtain properties of the system in the thermodynamic limit by studying finite systems .",
    "a similar situation is observed for models in the so - called genuine nonequilibrium universality classes @xcite , as is the case of direct percolation ( dp ) @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , a @xmath0dimensional ( with @xmath1 ) layer ising model infinite in @xmath2 dimensions and finite with size @xmath3 in the remaining dimension displays a transition also for finite @xmath3 .",
    "however , the transition for finite @xmath3 is different from the transition in the thermodynamic limit : in the first case we have the critical behavior of the ising model in @xmath4-dimensions and in the second in @xmath5-dimensions .",
    "similarly , nonequilibrium wetting finite systems also have a phase transition . here",
    "the wetting transition is defined as an binding - unbinding transition controlled by a growth rate .",
    "the reason is that both phases are basically determined by the sign of the velocity of a free interface , giving a well - defined ( but size - dependent ) transition point , even for finite systems .",
    "this circumstance has been pointed out some time ago by muoz @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the properties of this transition and its implications in finite size scaling were never studied in detail and this is the purpose of the present paper .",
    "nonequilibrium wetting is a very rich and interesting example of nonequilibrium critical phenomena .",
    "it basically corresponds to the study of the kardar - parisi - zhang ( kpz ) equation @xcite added with a soft - wall potential ( see @xcite for reviews ) .",
    "the kpz equation defines a robust universality class of nonequilibrium growing free interfaces @xcite .",
    "it is a langevin equation for the interface height @xmath6 , where @xmath7 gives the position on a @xmath5-dimensional interface and @xmath8 stands for time .",
    "the kpz equation added with a term accounting for the presence of a soft - wall was introduced by tu et al .",
    "@xcite and reads @xmath9 where @xmath10 is a gaussian white noise and @xmath11 is a soft - wall potential given by @xmath12 the laplacian term @xmath13 is related to surface tension , @xmath14 is the average interface velocity at zero slope and the nonlinear term @xmath15 is the lowest order term that breaks the up - down symmetry @xcite .    the wetting transition can be described as follows . if @xmath14 is bigger than the critical value @xmath16 the interface will grow like a free kpz interface , and the term @xmath17 becomes irrelevant after some transient . for @xmath18",
    "the interface stays bounded to zero height and does not propagate .",
    "the order parameter for this transition is the ensemble average of @xmath17 , which is zero for @xmath19 and non - zero for @xmath18 .",
    "for @xmath20 we have equilibrium wetting and equation ( [ eqbkpz ] ) becomes the edwards - wilkinson ( ew ) @xcite equation added with the soft - wall potential .",
    "this equation has been previously introduced by lipowsky @xcite in order to study dynamics in equilibrium wetting ( see @xcite for reviews on equilibrium wetting ) . for @xmath21",
    "we have nonequilibrium wetting and it turns out that the set of critical exponents characterizing the transition depends on the sign of @xmath22 .",
    "therefore , we shall consider three universality classes : the bounded - ew class ( bew ) and the bounded - kpz classes ( bkpz+ and bkpz ) , where the sign refers to @xmath22 .    by performing a cole - hopf transformation @xmath23 in equation ( [ eqbkpz ] )",
    "the following multiplicative noise langevin equation is obtained , @xmath24 where @xmath25 . the above equation is called the multiplicative noise 1 ( mn1 ) equation @xcite . performing the same transformation in equation ( [ eqbkpz ] ) but with @xmath26 the mn2 equation",
    "is obtained @xcite .",
    "clearly mn1 and bkpz ( mn2 and bkpz+ ) are the same universality class .",
    "the most robust universality class of nonequilibrium phase transitions is the dp universality class @xcite .",
    "the dp langevin equation is very similar to the mn1 equation , the difference resides in the term multiplying the noise . in the mn1 equation it is proportional to @xmath27 , while in the dp equation it is proportional to @xmath28 . in spite of the similarity of both langevin equations , the bkpz ( or mn1 ) and the dp universality classes are essentially different @xcite .",
    "finite systems in the dp universality class have no phase transition , the stationary state is the absorbing one independently of the value of the control parameter . on the other hand , finite systems in the bkpz universality classes still display a transition .",
    "this was clearly demonstrated by muoz @xcite with the solution of the corresponding one - variable fokker - planck equations ( obtained by eliminating the laplacian term ) for the dp and the mn1 classes , which roughly corresponds to a zero - dimensional limit .    in this paper",
    "we study the critical behavior of the phase transition taking place in a finite system and the finite size scaling of the bkpz universality classes .",
    "we consider the microscopic model introduced in @xcite , which is a restricted solid on solid ( rsos ) model with a hard - wall at zero height .",
    "we solve this model exactly for small systems with three and four sites , going beyond the zero - dimensional approximation from @xcite .",
    "as expected , we demonstrate that the critical exponents of the phase transition in finite systems are different from the critical exponents characterizing nonequilibrium wetting in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "surprisingly , we find that the phase transition in finite - systems does not discriminate between the bew , bkpz+ and bkpz universality classes .    moreover , we study the finite size scaling of bkpz universality classes .",
    "we show that the survival of a transition also in a finite system leads to finite size scaling that is different from the finite size effects observed in the other genuine nonequilibrium universality classes @xcite . in order to perform numerical simulations we use the single - step ( ss ) model with a moving wall @xcite . in this model",
    "the critical point is known exactly , leading to clean numerical results .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows .",
    "in the next section we introduce the models and discuss their phenomenology . in sec .",
    "iii we solve the rsos model exactly for the three - site and four - site cases . in sec .",
    "iv we analyze the finite size scaling of the bkpz universality classes with numerical simulations .",
    "we conclude in sec . v.",
    "first we define the microscopic realization of the bkpz equation introduced by hinrichsen et al . @xcite .",
    "the model is defined on a one - dimensional discrete lattice of size @xmath3 with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "to each site @xmath29 of the lattice a random variable @xmath30 is attached .",
    "it can take any integer value and is interpreted as the interface height .",
    "the allowed configurations are constrained trough the rsos restriction , @xmath31 , which generates a surface tension .",
    "usually , the initial condition is a flat interface at zero height , i.e. @xmath32 for all @xmath29 .",
    "the model evolves by random - sequential updates and the possible transitions are : evaporation @xmath33 and depositions @xmath34 .",
    "only transitions that satisfy the rsos restriction are carried out .",
    "the deposition rate ( transition probability per unit of time ) is @xmath35 , and the evaporation rates are @xmath36 and @xmath37 , with @xmath36 being the evaporation rate at a plateau ( see fig .",
    "[ transtionrates ] ) .",
    "the hard - wall is introduced by forbidding evaporation events at zero height , in this way negative heights are not allowed .        in order to explain the wetting transition within this model we first consider a free interface ( no wall at zero height ) . in this case",
    "the interface will propagate with a constant velocity after some transient . for a fixed value of @xmath36 , if @xmath35 is bigger ( smaller ) than a certain value @xmath38 , the interface propagates in the positive ( negative ) height direction . for @xmath39",
    "the interface velocity is zero .",
    "now consider the wall is present .",
    "for @xmath40 it has no influence because the interface moves in the positive height direction away from the wall . on the other hand , for @xmath41",
    "the situation is completely different : since the interface can not propagate in the negative height direction , it stays bounded to the wall .",
    "therefore , at @xmath39 that is a wetting transition , with @xmath40 corresponding to the the wet ( or moving ) phase and @xmath41 corresponding to the bound phase . in fig .",
    "[ phasediagram ] we show the phase diagram of the model obtained from numerical simulations .",
    "we note that the critical line depends on the system size and we are denoting by @xmath38 the critical line in the limit @xmath42 .",
    "when considering the critical point of a finite system we write @xmath43 .",
    "it can be shown that the parameter @xmath22 in the kpz equation can be obtained within a microscopic model by calculating how the interface velocity vary with the interface slope @xcite .",
    "for the rsos model the slope is introduced by changing the rsos condition between sites @xmath37 and @xmath3 in the following way . in order to have an interface slope @xmath44 the rsos condition between the boundary sites is changed to @xmath45 . in fig .",
    "[ phasediagram ] we also display the line @xmath20 obtained from numerical simulations , where above ( below ) this line @xmath46 ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "therefore , for @xmath48 the phase transition is in the bkpz universality class and for @xmath49 in the bkpz+ universality class . at @xmath50 and @xmath51 detailed balance holds ( see @xcite ) and we have equilibrium wetting , i.e. the phase transition is in the bew universality class .     and",
    "@xmath20 which corresponds to @xmath52 and are obtained from numerical simulations .",
    "moreover the figure shows the exact critical lines for @xmath53 and @xmath54 , which correspond to equation ( [ eqcriticall3 ] ) and ( [ eqcriticall4 ] ) respectively . ,",
    "width=283 ]    the order parameter of the phase transition is the density of sites at zero height @xmath55 , defined by @xmath56 where the brackets indicate an ensemble average . in the stationary state",
    "it is zero for @xmath57 and positive for @xmath41 .",
    "the critical exponent @xmath58 is related to how the stationary value of the order parameter goes to zero as criticality is approached from below , i.e. , @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the stationary value of the density of sites at zero height , @xmath61 , and the above relation is valid for @xmath62 small and positive . at the critical point",
    "the order parameter as a function of time goes to zero following a power law with exponent @xmath63 , i.e. @xmath64 the critical exponents defined by the divergence of the temporal correlation length @xmath65 and the spatial correlation length @xmath66 are @xmath67 which are valid for @xmath62 small and positive .",
    "the kpz universality class is related to the invariance of scale of the interface roughness @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the critical exponents of the bkpz universality classes are associated with the scaling exponents of the kpz universality class @xcite .",
    "hence , it is known that , in one dimension , @xmath68 and @xmath69 for the bkpz universality classes and @xmath70 and @xmath71 for the bew class @xcite . from dimensional",
    "analysis one can see that @xmath72 , and , therefore , with the introduction of the wall only one new exponent arises ( which can be @xmath63 or @xmath58 ) . for the bew this exponent can be determined exactly using the transfer matrix method and its value is @xmath73 ( or @xmath74 ) @xcite .",
    "for the bkpz universality classes no exact solution is known and the exponents are determined with numerical simulations . to our knowledge",
    "the best numerical values for these exponents were obtained in @xcite with time - dependent simulations of the ss model with a wall .",
    "the exponents are @xmath75 ( or @xmath76 ) for the bkpz universality class and @xmath77 ( or @xmath78 ) for the bkpz+ universality class .",
    "let us now define the notation for the distance from criticality and the critical exponents of a finite system .",
    "the distance from criticality will be denoted by @xmath79 .",
    "an important result that we assume to be valid for the bkpz universality classes and has been verified numerically in @xcite , for the rsos model , is that @xmath80 the critical exponents for a finite system @xmath81 and @xmath82 are related to how the stationary value of @xmath55 approaches zero as @xmath83 and how @xmath55 decays in time at the finite system critical point ( @xmath84 ) , respectively .    in this paper",
    "we also consider the ss model with a moving wall , which is more convenient to perform numerical simulations . in the following",
    "we describe this model briefly , for a full definition see @xcite .",
    "similarly to the rsos case this model is defined on a one - dimensional discrete lattice with periodic boundary conditions , however in the ss model the height difference between two neighbors is @xmath85 .",
    "the possible transitions are : deposition in a local minima with probability @xmath86 and evaporation in a local maxima with probability @xmath87 .",
    "this model can be mapped onto the simple symmetric exclusion process and , therefore , its interface velocity is known and given by @xmath88 the moving wall is implemented by increasing ( or decreasing ) the height of the wall by one unit after a fixed time interval @xmath89 , which produces a wall velocity @xmath90 ( @xmath91 ) .",
    "if the wall velocity is equal to @xmath92 we are at the critical point ( of a finite system ) .",
    "we will consider the cases @xmath93 and @xmath94 , which correspond to the bkpz and bkpz+ universality classes , respectively @xcite .",
    "all the critical exponents defined for the rsos model are defined in the same way for the ss model , where the distances from criticality are given by @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "note that from ( [ eqvl ] ) we see that ( [ deltadelta ] ) is exact for the ss model with a moving wall .",
    "the advantages of performing numerical simulations with this model come from the fact that the critical point is known exactly .    in the next section",
    "we solve the rsos model exactly for the cases @xmath53 and @xmath54 in order to make an exact analyses of the stationary state of a finite system . before ending this section",
    "we discuss the critical behavior of the rsos model at @xmath97 .",
    "this is a special case where the phase transition is in the dp universality class @xcite .",
    "comparing the transition at @xmath97 with the transition for @xmath98 provides a simple explanation for the essential differences between the dp universality class and the bkpz universality classes . at @xmath97",
    "once a layer is filled it is not possible to evaporate a particle on it anymore .",
    "hence , in a finite system along @xmath97 for any @xmath99 the interface will have a positive velocity , since eventually a layer will be completed .",
    "therefore , at @xmath97 a finite system has no phase transition . for @xmath98 particles",
    "can be evaporated from complete layers and because of that a phase transition is still present in a finite system .",
    "let us consider the rsos model with @xmath53 .",

    "there are seven possible configurations that satisfy the rsos restriction .",

    "because of the rsos restriction , the one - site probability distribution @xmath117 and the two - site probability distributions @xmath118 are related by @xmath119 . from the relation between the two - site probability distributions and the three - site probability distributions",
    "we obtain @xmath120 the order parameter in the present notation is the probability of being at height zero @xmath121 .",
    "the stationary state solution of the master equation ( [ masterl3 ] ) gives @xmath122 where the above solution is valid below the critical line , given by @xmath123 therefore , for @xmath53 the critical line is given by @xmath124 and @xmath125 for any value of @xmath36 . by integrating equations ( [ masterl3 ] ) numerically at the critical point",
    "we obtain @xmath126 , also independent of the value of @xmath36 .",

    "the same scaling forms ( [ scalingoffrho ] ) and ( [ scalingoffrho2 ] ) were demonstrated to hold in @xcite .",
    "secondly , we think that previous numerical results of the critical exponent @xmath58 for the bkpz class from off - critical simulations , as for example in @xcite , estimate a value smaller than @xmath165 ( obtained from time - dependent simulations in @xcite ) because the finite - size effects were not took into account properly .",
    "the third point is that we also performed simulations with the rsos model and the results are in agreement with the results for the ss model , however in the second case we get much better numerical results .",
    "as we cited in the introduction , it has been pointed out some time ago that the models in the bkpz universality classes have a phase transition in finite systems @xcite , in opposition to the dp universality class .",
    "however , it was not clear what kind of transition takes place in a finite system . here",
    "this issue was clarified : we showed that the phase transition in a finite system is characterized by a linear decay of the stationary value of the order parameter as criticality is approached and the average height of the interface performing a reflecting boundary random walk at the critical point .",
    "moreover , we showed that the transition in a finite system does not differentiate between the bkpz+ , bkpz and bew universality classes .",
    "we have considered two microscopic realizations of the bkpz equation : the rsos and the ss model with a hard wall .",
    "however we expect this finite system phase transition to be a feature of the bkpz universality classes .    as another main result of this paper",
    "we have established the finite size scaling theory for the bkpz universality classes , which is affected by the fact that finite systems also have a transition . for time - dependent simulations we showed that the scaling function ( [ scalingtemporal ] ) has a crossover from the infinite system size decay exponent to the finite system size decay exponent .",
    "for the off - critical simulations we showed that the scaling function have different forms , depending on considering the distance from the infinite system critical point or the finite system critical point . in the first case the scaling function defined in ( [ scalingoffrho ] ) follows @xmath166 for small @xmath149 and in the second case the scaling function defined in ( [ scalingoffrho2 ] ) follows @xmath167 for small @xmath149 .",

    "<S> this is different from nonequilibrium phase transitions into an absorbing state , where the stationary state is the absorbing one for any value of the control parameter in a finite system . in this paper , we study what kind of transition takes place in finite systems of nonequilibrium wetting models . by solving exactly a microscopic model with three and four sites and performing numerical simulations </S>",
    "<S> we show that the phase transition taking place in a finite system is characterized by the average interface height performing a random walk at criticality and does not discriminate between the bounded - kpz classes and the bounded - ew class . </S>",
    "<S> we also study the finite size scaling of the bkpz universality classes , showing that it presents peculiar features in comparison with other universality classes of nonequilibrium phase transitions .    </S>",
