    "signatures of the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) formation have been extensively studied via momentum space distributions of produced hadrons , but it is also natural to assume that finite angular momentum of the qgp droplets should be translated to alignment of final hadron s spins .",
    "hydrodynamical approach is a well - established tool for the qgp studies , however , polarization of produced hadrons had not been systematically assessed in it . in particular , the widely used cooper - frye formula assumes no distinction between different spin projections of the produced hadrons .",
    "spin only enters in the distribution function part of the cooper - frye formula as a @xmath2 multiplier .",
    "however , it was shown in @xcite that a more subtle effect is present and can play a role : spin - vorticity coupling can induce non - vanishing polarization of hadrons with nonzero spin produced in local thermal equilibrium .",
    "this is a purely thermo - mechanical effect , which polarizes both particles and anti - particles in the same direction defined by local thermal vorticity of the medium .    up to now , few results for the polarization of @xmath0 baryons based on this effect have been reported . in @xcite ,",
    "simulation of noncentral @xmath3  gev au - au collisions at rhic with initial state from yang - mills dynamics followed by a 3  dimensional ideal hydro expansion resulted in polarization of low-@xmath4 @xmath0 of few percent magnitude , parallel to the direction of total angular momentum of the fireball , whereas for few gev @xmath4 it reaches 9% . in another work",
    "@xcite aiming at the same collision energy , a 3 dimensional hydrodynamic expansion with initial state from optical glauber model with parametrized rapidity dependence chosen to reproduce directed flow results @xcite resulted in much lower values of polarization : about 0.2% for low-@xmath4 @xmath0 and up to 1.5% for @xmath5 component of polarization of high-@xmath4 @xmath0 . in a more recent work @xcite an event - by - event 3 dimensional viscous hydrodynamics with initial state from ampt model results in similar few per mille average polarization for a+a collisions at @xmath6 and @xmath7  gev .",
    "the abovementioned results confront the experimental analysis of au - au collisions at @xmath3  gev by star @xcite which only puts an upper limit of 0.02 on the polarization of @xmath0 baryons . at lower collision energies , because of emerging baryon stopping effect one may expect larger local vorticity and , as a result , larger polarization signal . indeed ,",
    "preliminary star results @xcite show that the mean polarization of hyperons can reach as much as several percents in au - au collisions at lower rhic beam energy scan ( bes ) energies . in this report",
    "we give an assessment of the polarization signal in a state - of - the - art hybrid model , which is tuned to reproduce basic hadron observables for heavy ion collisions in the bes program : ( pseudo)rapidity , transverse momentum distributions and elliptic flow coefficients .",
    "we simulate heavy ion collisions at rhic beam energy scan energies in ` vhlle+urqmd ` hybrid @xcite .",
    "herein we summarize its main features .",
    "the initial state is modeled with ` urqmd ` cascade @xcite . at a hypersurface @xmath8 the fluidization",
    "is imposed . at lower bes energies",
    "@xmath9 corresponds to a moment when two nuclei have completely passed through each other , @xmath10 .",
    "therefore the duration of pre - hydro stage changes considerably , from 3.2  fm / c at @xmath11  gev to 0.4  fm / c at @xmath12  gev .",
    "following 3 dimensional hydrodynamic expansion is numerically solved with ` vhlle ` code @xcite . in the hydrodynamic phase ,",
    "a finite effective value of shear viscosity over entropy density @xmath13 is taken into account , and the equation of state of the medium with finite @xmath14 is based on chiral model @xcite .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the mean relativistic spin vector of spin particles of sort @xmath15 with four - momentum @xmath16 , produced around point @xmath17 on particlization hypersurface is : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is ( fermi - dirac ) distribution function of the particles and @xmath20 is thermal vorticity , equal to ( minus ) the antisymmetric part of the gradient of the four - temperature field @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the proper temperature and @xmath23 is the hydrodynamic 4-velocity .",
    "the mean spin vector of the hadron species @xmath15 , produced at particlization surface ( which we will call _ direct _ hadrons ) , can be then calculated using an extension of the cooper - frye formula : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the average number of the hadrons produced , and lorentz transformation is made to the rest frames of the particles , denoted with the asterisk .",
    "finally we note that the experimentally observable quantity is mean polarization vector @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the spin of particle .",
    "the resulting components of the mean polarization vector of direct @xmath0 baryons at midrapidity , calculated in the model for 20 - 50% central au - au collisions at rhic bes energies is presented on the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] as a solid line .",
    "the @xmath28 is a component perpendicular to the reaction plane , and @xmath29 is the one parallel to the impact parameter .",
    "we observe a rapid decrease of the mean @xmath0 polarization with collision energy from a maximal value of about 1.8% at @xmath11  gev . while qualitatively one expects that the polarization is related to the angular momentum of the fireball , we argue that quantitatively it is not the case .",
    "in fact the total angular momentum of the fireball increases with increasing collision energy as one can see on the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , and the ratio of total angular momentum to total energy @xmath30 exhibits only a mild decrease .    as one can see from eq .",
    "[ eq - pixp ] , the actual quantity generating local polarization of hadrons is the local thermal vorticity at the points of their production .",
    "having an access to the space - time flow structure in the model , we can explore how the vorticity changes with collision energy . on the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we show a time evolution of the @xmath31 component of thermal vorticity , which generates the dominant contribution to the out - of - plane component of polarization @xmath28 , at two different collision energies .",
    "we find that ( 1 ) for lower collision energy , @xmath11  gev the hydrodynamic expansion starts with higher value of @xmath32 , which is a result of shear flow structure ( plotted with white vectors on the left panel plot ) at midrapidity formed by baryon stopping .",
    "also , ( 2 ) shorter lifetime of hydro phase ( as compared to the simulation at @xmath33  gev ) dilutes the initial vorticity less , resulting in larger vorticity at the end of hydrodynamic phase .",
    "as the low-@xmath4 @xmath0 are more likely to be emitted at the end of the hydrodynamic phase , the abovementioned factors explain the steep decrease of the mean @xmath0 polarization with collision energy .",
    "similar trends - increase of angular momentum of the fireball and decrease of the mean vorticity with increasing collision energy - were observed in ampt microscopic model @xcite .",
    "large fraction of observed @xmath0 come from decays of higher mass hyperon resonances , which possess polarization as well .",
    "the most abundant ones are strong decay of @xmath34 and electromagnetic decay of @xmath35 .",
    "preliminary analysis of the feed - down contributions and polarization transfer in the hyperon decays shows us that feed - down contributions from @xmath35 and @xmath34 decrease the resulting mean polarization by only few percents .",
    "however , extending the list of decays up to @xmath36 results in about 15% suppression of the overall @xmath0 polarization , as @xmath0 from decays of heavier resonances acquire alternating signs of polarization @xcite .",
    "in addition , in urqmd cascade which is used to treat interactions after particlization , cross sections of @xmath0 and @xmath35 with mostly abundant mesons and baryons , which are calculated according to additive quark model , are comparable to those of nucleons @xcite .",
    "this implies that @xmath0 actively rescatter in the hadronic phase .",
    "scatterings will presumably randomize the spin direction of primary as well as secondary particles , thus decreasing the estimated mean global polarization .",
    "therefore the values of polarization on fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] should serve only as an upper bound for the polarization of all @xmath0 in a complete hydro+cascade model with given initial conditions .     produced at the particlization surface ( left ) and ratio of total angular momentum to total energy of the fireball ( right ) , calculated in the model for 20 - 50% central au - au collisions at @xmath37  gev.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=50.0% ]   produced at the particlization surface ( left ) and ratio of total angular momentum to total energy of the fireball ( right ) ,",
