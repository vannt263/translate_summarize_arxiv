    "the decay and tunneling of the metastable states is an old quantum mechanical problem . however in the context of bose - einstein condensate ( bec )  @xcite , it revives new interest in the study of decay and tunneling of interacting trapped bosons through a potential barrier .",
    "optical traps of finite width can support both the bound and resonance states  @xcite and the macroscopic quantum tunneling of a bec through such finite size barrier is directly experimentally observed  @xcite .",
    "theoretically the treatment of transport within the mean - field has been attempted by many groups  @xcite .",
    "many interesting phenomena are observed due to the nonlinear interaction term in the gross - pitaeveskii ( gp ) equation .",
    "moiseyev _ et.al .",
    "_  @xcite have also studied the transition from resonance to bound states of trapped attractive bec when the interatomic attraction is increased .",
    "_  @xcite have studied the macroscopic quantum tunneling in a finite potential well in one , two and three dimensions .",
    "time dependent gp equation has been used to study the decay process of the bec  @xcite . in another attempt by the group of heidelberg  @xcite , the decay and tunneling dynamics of few interacting bosons through one - dimensional barrier is studied from the first principle and compared with the mean - field results .",
    "but the quantum many - body calculation with realistic interaction for 3d shallow trap and the study of stability of attractive bec with large number of bosons is still an open problem .    in the present work we consider quantum many - body tunneling of the attractive bec near the criticality and trapped in a quadratic with a quartic confinement .",
    "the quartic term takes care of the shallow gaussian potential of finite width .",
    "the external potential is modeled as @xmath4 .",
    "this represents the optical trap used in many experimental bec  @xcite .",
    "this type of study is important for various reasons .",
    "first , near the critical point , as the condensate becomes highly correlated the mean - field gp equation does not produce good results .",
    "this is pointed earlier that the choice of contact interaction in 3d attractive condensate does not represent the true interatomic interaction  @xcite .",
    "so near the critical point where the bec has high probability of tunneling through the adjacent barrier one needs to apply an approximate many - body technique which takes care the interatomic correlation .",
    "second , the choice of van der waals interaction in the many - body theory with a short range hard sphere and a @xmath5 tail gives the realistic picture . in the many - body effective potential the metastable bec",
    "is now bounded by double gaussian - like barriers of different height in two sides .",
    "thus the bec suffers tunneling through both the barriers simultaneously .",
    "this is distinctly different from the tunneling in the mean - field approach where the bec suffers tunneling through the right side barrier which is the effect of finite trap size only .",
    "although a preliminary attempt has been made in our earlier published work in this direction  @xcite but it needs further study for the following reasons . in our earlier study",
    "we have considered tunneling for a fixed @xmath0 parameter . in the present work we continuously tune @xmath0 and study the tunneling process adiabatically .",
    "this needs to control the height of the confining potential well in a controlled fashion .",
    "as the trapping potential is imposed optically by laser , in the routine experiments of bec , the height of the external potential is controlled by reducing the laser intensity .",
    "thus our present study is quite important as it could be obtained in the laboratory with present day set - up .    in our present calculation",
    "we choose @xmath6rb condensate in the anharmonic trap .",
    "we study the various tunneling phenomena for different choices of anharmonic parameter @xmath0 : weak , intermediate and strong .",
    "we observe new physics which substantially differs from mean - field picture .",
    "for very weak anharmonicity the stability of the attractive bose condensate is substantially improved whereas for very strong anharmonicity the condensate collapses quickly . for intermediate anharmonicity",
    "we observe dual tunneling of the condensate through the adjacent barriers .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we introduce the many - body calculation with the correlated harmonic potential basis .",
    "section iii discuses the numerical results and section iv concludes the summary of our work .",
    "the earlier theoretical studies on attractive bec in the harmonic trap used the mean - field approximation which results the gross - pitaeveskii ( gp ) equation for contact @xmath7-interaction  @xcite .",
    "as the total condensate wave function is taken as the product of single particle wave functions , the effect of interatomic correlation is completely ignored .",
    "however specially for the attractive condensate , as the atoms come closer and closer , the central density becomes high and the condensate becomes highly correlated near the critical point .",
    "naturally the interatomic correlation can no longer be ignored and one needs a full quantum many - body calculation which takes care of the effect of interatomic correlation .    in our present study",
    "we solve the many - body schrdinger equation by potential harmonic expansion method ( phem ) , which basically uses a truncated two - body basis set which keeps all possible two - body correlation  @xcite and we go beyond the mean - field approximation .",
    "the potential harmonic expansion method with an additional short range correlation function , called cphem , has already been established as a very useful technique for the study of attractive bec  @xcite .",
    "here we describe the methodology briefly for the interested readers .",
    "details are found in our earlier work  @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian for a system of @xmath8 identical bosons ( each of mass @xmath9 ) interacting via two - body potential @xmath10 and confined in an external trap ( which is modeled as a harmonic potential with a quartic term ) has the form @xmath11 after elimination of the center of mass motion and using standard jacobi coordinates  @xcite , the hamiltonian describing the relative motion of the atoms is given by @xmath12 @xmath13 is the sum of all pair - wise interactions expressed in terms of the jacobi vectors .",
    "it is to be noted that hyperspherical harmonic expansion method ( hhem ) is an _ ab - initio _ tool to solve the many - body schrdinger equation where the total wave function is expanded in the complete set of hyperspherical basis  @xcite .",
    "although hhem is a complete many - body approach which includes all correlations , due to large degeneracy of the hh basis , hhem can not be applied to a typical bec which contains few thousands to few millions of atoms .",
    "however in the context of experimentally achieved bec , as the interparticle separation is very large compared to the range of interatomic interaction , we can safely ignore the effect of three - body and higher - body correlation and can keep only the two - body correlation .",
    "this is perfectly justified for dilute bec where the probabilities of three and higher body collision is negligible .",
    "it permits us to decompose the total wave function @xmath14 into two - body faddeev component for the interacting @xmath15 pair as @xmath16 it is worth to note that @xmath17 is a function of two - body separation ( @xmath18 ) only and also includes the global hyperradius @xmath19 , which is given by @xmath20 .",
    "thus the effect of two - body correlation comes through the two - body interaction in the expansion basis .",
    "@xmath17 is symmetric under @xmath21 for bosonic atoms and satisfy the faddeev equation @xmath22\\phi_{ij } = -v(\\vec{r}_{ij})\\sum_{kl > k}^{a}\\phi_{kl}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 is the total kinetic energy .",
    "operating @xmath24 on both sides of equation ( 4 ) , we get back the original schrdinger equation . in this approach",
    ", we assume that when ( @xmath25 ) pair interacts , the rest of the bosons are inert spectators . thus the total hyperangular momentum quantum number as also the orbital angular momentum of the whole system",
    "is contributed by the interacting pair only .",
    "next the @xmath15th faddeev component is expanded in the set of potential harmonics ( ph ) ( which is a subset of hh basis and sufficient for the expansion of @xmath26 ) appropriate for the ( @xmath25 ) partition as @xmath27 @xmath28 denotes the full set of hyperangles in the @xmath29-dimensional space corresponding to the @xmath15th interacting pair and @xmath30 is called the ph basis .",
    "it has an analytic expression : @xmath31 @xmath32 is the hh of order zero in the @xmath33 dimensional space spanned by @xmath34 jacobi vectors ; @xmath35 is the hyperangle given by @xmath36 = @xmath37 . for the remaining @xmath38 noninteracting bosons",
    "we define hyperradius as @xmath39 such that @xmath40 and @xmath19 represents the global hyperradius of the condensate .",
    "the set of @xmath41 quantum numbers of hh is now reduced to _ only _ @xmath42 as for the @xmath38 non - interacting pair @xmath43 and for the interacting pair @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "thus the @xmath29 dimensional schrdinger equation reduces effectively to a four dimensional equation with the relevant set of quantum numbers : hyperradius @xmath19 , orbital angular momentum quantum number @xmath47 , azimuthal quantum number @xmath9 and grand orbital quantum number @xmath48 for any @xmath49 . substituting in eq(4 ) and projecting on a particular ph ,",
    "a set of coupled differential equation ( cde ) for the partial wave @xmath50 is obtained @xmath51u_{kl}(r)\\\\ + & \\displaystyle{\\sum_{k^{\\prime}}}f_{kl}v_{kk^{\\prime}}(r ) f_{k^{\\prime}l } u_{k^{\\prime}l}(r ) = 0 \\hspace*{.1 cm } , \\end{array}\\ ] ] + where @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "+ @xmath56 is a constant and represents the overlap of the ph for interacting partition with the sum of phs corresponding to all partitions  @xcite .",
    "the potential matrix element @xmath57 is given by @xmath58      as pointed earlier in the mean - field gp equation the two - body interaction is represented by a single parameter , the @xmath59-wave scattering length @xmath60 only .",
    "it disregards the detailed structure .",
    "the presence of essential singularity as @xmath61 for the attractive contact @xmath7-interaction makes the hamiltonian unbound from below .",
    "so in our present many - body calculation , we use a realistic interatomic potential like the van der waals potential with an attractive @xmath62 tail at large separation and a strong short range repulsion . the inclusion of detailed structure in the two - body potential with the short range repulsive core needs to include an additional short range correlation in the ph basis . this short range behavior",
    "is represented by a hard core of radius @xmath63 and we calculate the two - body wave function @xmath64 by solving the zero - energy two - body schrodinger equation @xmath65 this zero - energy two - body wave function @xmath64 is a good representation of the short range behavior of @xmath17 as in the experimental bec , the energy of the interacting pair is negligible compared with the depth of the interatomic potential .",
    "it is taken as the two - body correlation function in the ph expansion basis .",
    "the value of @xmath63 is obtained from the requirement that the calculated @xmath60 has the expected value  @xcite .",
    "we introduce this as a short - range correlation function in the expansion basis .",
    "this also improves largely the rate of convergence of the ph basis and we call it as correlated potential harmonic expansion method ( cphem ) .",
    "we replace eq(5 ) by @xmath66 and the correlated ph ( cph ) basis is given by @xmath67_{correlated } =   { \\mathcal p}_{2k+l}^{l , m } ( \\omega_{n}^{(ij ) } ) \\eta(r_{ij } ) , \\ ] ] the correlated potential matrix @xmath57 is now given by @xmath68 here @xmath69 is the jacobi polynomial , and its norm and weight function are @xmath70 and @xmath71 respectively  @xcite .",
    "one may note that the inclusion of @xmath64 makes the ph basis non - orthogonal .",
    "one may surely use the standard procedure for handling non - orthogonal basis .",
    "however in the present calculation we have checked that @xmath64 differs from a constant value only by small amount and the overlap @xmath72 is quite small .",
    "thus we get back the eq(11 ) approximately when the correlated potential matrix is calculated by eq(16 ) .",
    "the interatomic potential has been chosen as the van der waals potential with a hard core of radius @xmath73 , viz .",
    ", @xmath74 for @xmath75 and @xmath76 for @xmath77 .",
    "@xmath78 is known for a specific atom and in the limit of @xmath79 , the potential becomes a hard sphere and the cutoff radius exactly coincides with the @xmath59-wave scattering length @xmath60 . for our present study",
    "we consider @xmath6rb atoms in the jila trap where the controlled collapse experiment has been observed  @xcite . by utilizing the feshbach resonance one can effectively tune the negative scattering length and can study the stability in controlled fashion . in our choice of two - body potential",
    "we tune @xmath63 to reproduce the experimental scattering length .",
    "as we decrease @xmath63 , @xmath60 decreases and at a particular critical value of @xmath63 it passes through @xmath80 to @xmath81  @xcite . for our present calculation",
    "we choose @xmath6rb atoms with @xmath78 = @xmath82 o.u .",
    "@xcite and @xmath60 = @xmath83 o.u . , which is one of the choices of scattering length @xmath60 in the controlled collapse experiment of roberts _ et.al",
    ". _  @xcite . with this @xmath84",
    "we solve the zero - energy two - body schrdinger equation and tune @xmath63 to obtain correctly @xmath60 = @xmath83 o.u .",
    "we choose @xmath63 such that it corresponds to the zero node in the two - body wave function .",
    "the chosen parameter for our calculation is @xmath85 o.u .. with these set of parameters we solve the coupled differential equation by hyperspherical adiabatic approximation ( haa )  @xcite . in haa",
    ", we assume that the hyperradial motion is slow compared to the hyperangular motion and the potential matrix together with the hypercentrifugal repulsion is diagonalized for a fixed value of @xmath19 .",
    "thus the effective potential for the hyperradial motion is obtained as a parametric function of @xmath19 .",
    "we choose the lowest eigen potential @xmath86 as the effective potential in which the condensate moves collectively .",
    "the energy and wave function of the condensate are finally obtained by solving the adiabatically separated hyperradial equation in the extreme adiabatic approximation ( eaa ) @xmath87\\zeta_{0}(r)=0\\hspace*{.1cm},\\ ] ] subject to approximate boundary condition on @xmath88 . for our numerical calculation",
    "we fix @xmath89 and truncate the cph basis to a maximum value @xmath90 requiring proper convergence . in fig.1",
    "we plot the many - body effective potential @xmath86 as a function of hyperradius @xmath19 for @xmath91 atoms in the pure harmonic trap ( @xmath92 ) . for @xmath93 ,",
    "the condensate is metastable and is associated with a deep and narrow attractive well ( naw ) on the left side . for @xmath61 , there is a strong repulsive wall which is the reflection of the hard core van der waals interaction . for @xmath49 less than the critical number @xmath1 a metastable region ( msr )",
    "appears for larger @xmath19 .",
    "an intermediate barrier ( ib ) separates the naw from the msr .",
    "the panel ( a ) of fig .",
    "1 , the naw together with the repulsive core is shown .",
    "the ib and msr have been shown in panel ( b ) of fig .",
    "1 . with increase in @xmath49 , we observe that the height of ib decreases , together with a decrease in the difference ( @xmath94 ) between the maximum of ib ( @xmath95 ) and minimum of msr ( @xmath96 ) and the naw starts to be more negative and narrower . as @xmath97 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 coincides ,",
    "the msr disappears which corresponds to the collapse of metastable bec . for @xmath98",
    ", there will be only the naw and the condensate will settele in the deep attractive well.in the attractive @xmath7-function potential , as @xmath61 , the effective potential rapidly goes to @xmath99 which is called a pathological singularity . here",
    "the many - body picture is in sharp contrast with the gp mean - field picture with contact interaction .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     with increase in @xmath0 value , the barrier height of rib quickly decreases which enhances the tunneling probability rapidly .",
    "the effective potential is plotted in the fig .",
    "unlike the previous case of weak anharmonicity , here the msr has no deep well on the right side .",
    "so after tunneling the condensate will behave as trapless , uniform bose gas .",
    "the feature is also clear from fig .",
    "6(b ) where we observe that the condensate wave function is associated with oscillation on the right side . for better clarity",
    "the oscillatory part of the wave function is presented in the inset of fig .",
    "it clearly shows that the condensate is basically confined    in the msr but a part likages through the adjacent rib . with increasing @xmath0",
    "the oscillation also increases .",
    "the corresponding wkb tunneling probability is presented in fig .",
    "7 which shows sharp increase in @xmath23 even with small change in @xmath0 which indicates the quicker collapse of the condensate in a strong anharmonic trap .      here",
    "we study the collapse of attractive bose - einstein condensate in the shallow trap which is produced with an additional quartic anharmonic potential with a harmonic potential . in the bec experiments of attractive condensate  @xcite",
    ", it is observed that the condensate is metastable for a finite number of atoms .",
    "this is called critical number ( @xmath1 ) and the condensate collapses when @xmath98 . in the controlled collapse experiment of @xmath6rb condensate , the @xmath1 is calculated both by the gp mean - field theory  @xcite and _ ab - initio _ quantum many - body calculation  @xcite .",
    "the critical stability factor is more accurately calculated in the correlated many - body approach  @xcite and is closer to the experimental value compared to the mean - field result .",
    "thus in the present study we are interested to calculate @xmath1 when the external trap is slowly tuned from harmonic to weak anharmonic and then strong anharmonic . in fig .",
    "8 we plot the many - body effective potential for both harmonic and with weak anharmonicity . for @xmath0 = 0",
    ", the trap is purely isotropic , harmonic and the condensate collapses when @xmath98 . in fig .",
    "8 we observe that for @xmath0 = 0 , the    intermediate barrier on the left side ( ib ) just vanishes for @xmath100 and the metastable condensate confined in the msr settles down in the negative deep well on the left side of the intermediate barrier ( ib ) ( not shown in the figure ) .",
    "it corresponds to collapse and the corresponding critical number for collapse is @xmath1 = 2385 .",
    "now with the harmonic potential if we add anharmonic potential with small anharmonicity ( @xmath101 ) , the msr starts to develop and the intermediate barrier reappears . for this @xmath0 ,",
    "the condensate collapses for @xmath102 .",
    "thus by increasing @xmath0 by very small amount , the critical number increases by @xmath103 atoms and gives better stability of the condensate .",
    "it corresponds to the metastable condensate which is confined in msr .",
    "thus the stability is enhanced by controlling @xmath0 .",
    "the large @xmath19 behavior of the eigen potential almost remains unchanged .",
    "thus by increasing @xmath0 very slowly we observe the condensate becomes more stable and @xmath1 gradually increases with @xmath0 .",
    "it is shown in fig .",
    "9 , which nicely describes that @xmath1 smoothly increases with @xmath0 , when @xmath0 is small . in the earlier study of moiseyev _ et.al .",
    "_  @xcite the transition from resonance to bound state has been studied when the attractive interaction gradually increases . however to study such transition , an additional negative offset ( @xmath104 ) was required to prevent collapse . for @xmath105",
    ", the authors found in the ref .",
    "@xcite that resonance never turns into bound state as the nonlinearity becomes more negative , the condensate collapses .",
    "however due to the use of hard core van der waals potential we do not require any such external offset to create the metastable condensate . thus the increasing stability and the transition from resonance to quasi - bound states for very weak anharmonicity strongly differs from the earlier observation of moiseyev _",
    "et.al._. however with further increase in @xmath0 , we enter in the zone of intermediate anharmonicity and strong anharmonicity which shows that @xmath1 now sharply decreases with @xmath0 .",
    "thus we observe two branches in fig .",
    "we very carefully studied and observed that these two branches never meet .",
    "the magnified graph near the point of bifurcation is also presented in the inset of fig .",
    "in our present work , we have studied the decay and tunneling of attractive bose einstein condensate in the finite trap by approximate but _ ab - initio _ many - body calculation .",
    "main attention has been paid in the study of stability of attractive condensate when the effective trap height is tuned from very close to harmonic to weak anharmonicity and then to strong anharmonicity .",
    "the use of correlated ph basis and the realistic van der waals interaction correctly describes the many - body tunneling process and gives the realistic picture .",
    "our result strongly differs from the earlier study of mean - field results through one - dimensional barrier",
    ". the greater stability of attractive bose gas in the anharmonic trap with very weak anharmonicity and the dual tunneling of the attractive condensate for intermediate anharmonicity are of special interest .",
    "the use of hard core potential in the two - body interaction can always describe the post collapse scenario of the attractive condensate in the many - body picture .",
    "no additional negative offset potential is required at @xmath106 to observe collapse - to - metastable transition .",
    "such attractive condensates in the finite trap are created in the laboratory when the height of the confining potential is controlled by controlling the laser intensity in the optical trap or by controlling the electric current in magnetic trap .",
    "thus the attractive bec can be created in a shallow trap of chosen height and once it is materialized several experiments can be done .",
    "thus our present many - body calculation is quite relevant experimentally and calculated observables like the tunneling probability @xmath23 and critical value of @xmath0 parameter , @xmath1 can be easily observed in the present day experiments .",
    "the choice of scattering length @xmath60 is also taken from the experiment of @xmath6rb atoms in jila .",
    "this is the first such many - body calculation where we compute resonances and decay of many - boson systems in three - dimension beyond the mean - field .",
    "a natural extension of the present work is to study the dynamics and to calculate the non - escape probability and various coherence properties for many - boson systems in @xmath42d , which requires the solution of full time dependent many - body equation .",
