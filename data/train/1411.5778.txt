    "recently , baados , silk and west have rediscovered that the center - of - mass energy of a collision of two particles that are at rest at infinity can be arbitrary high near the horizon of an extremal kerr black hole if the particle angular momentum is fine - tuned to a critical value  @xcite .",
    "the phenomenon is now called baados - silk - west ( bsw ) effect ,",
    "but actually it was found for the first time by piran , shaham and katz in 1975 in a sequence of papers on the collisional penrose process  @xcite .",
    "the properties of high energy collisions in the vicinity of extremal and almost extremal kerr black holes have been investigated in detail  @xcite . for a review ,",
    "see e.g. harada and kimura  @xcite .",
    "the bsw process has been criticized in  @xcite .",
    "first , the proper time of a critical particle to reach the event horizon of an extremal kerr black hole is infinite .",
    "second , it is widely believed that astrophysical black holes can not be extremal .",
    "the thorne bound for the spin parameter of a kerr black hole accreting from a thin disk is @xmath0  @xcite , even if it can be violated in the cases of super - eddington accretion  @xcite and of deviations from the kerr background  @xcite .    from the relativistic point of view , high energy collisions of particles on curved spacetimes are interesting because the phenomenon would have close relationships with other relativistic effects , such as the emission of gravitational waves  @xcite , the self - gravity of colliding objects  @xcite , and instabilities of the background spacetime  @xcite . in astrophysical situations , the true upper bound of the center - of - mass energy for a particle collision would be affected by these relativistic effects .",
    "the electromagnetic counterpart of the bsw effect in the extremal reissner - nordstrm black hole spacetime was found by zaslavskii  @xcite , although the extremal reissner - nordstrm black hole can unlikely be considered an astrophysical object .",
    "the details of the bsw collision in the reissner - nordstrm spacetime have been investigated to understand the bsw effect deeply  @xcite since the reissner - nordstrm spacetime has a simpler structure than the kerr spacetime .",
    "the bsw effect has been also studied in a variety of near - extremal black hole spacetimes  @xcite , including cases in higher dimensions  @xcite , and some near - extremal non - black - hole spacetimes  @xcite .",
    "these recent studies have revealed that the bsw effect is a universal property in extremal and near - extremal spacetimes , while particle accelerations would also occur in non - near - extremal spacetimes if a gravitational potential is deep  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we will show clearly that particle collisions with a high center - of - mass energy can occur because of a deep effective potential .",
    "the bsw effect can be used to study the instability of the background spacetime .",
    "kimura  _ et al .",
    "_ pointed out that a bsw collision may generate a new black hole in the vicinity of extremal or almost extremal black holes  @xcite .",
    "this implies that extremal black holes are unstable against the bsw process .",
    "tsukamoto  _ et al . _",
    "@xcite showed that there are analogies between the instability of extremal horizons suggested by the bsw effect and the test - field instability of extremal horizons studied by aretakis  @xcite .",
    "general relativity permits gravitating objects with a non - trivial topology such as wormholes ( for a review on wormhole spacetimes , see e.g. visser  @xcite ) .",
    "astrophysical observations give some constraints  @xcite , but they can not exclude the existence of these objects in our universe .",
    "for instance , some traversable wormholes are still viable candidates to explain the supermassive objects at the centers of galaxies  @xcite .",
    "the ellis wormhole is the simplest traversable wormhole of the morris - thorne class  @xcite .",
    "it is a static , spherically symmetric and asymptotically flat solution of einstein s equations with a phantom scalar field  @xcite .",
    "however , the spacetime is unstable  @xcite , despite some early studies claiming its stability  @xcite .    in 2013 , bronnikov _ et al . _",
    "considered the ellis wormhole metric , but with the spacetime filled with a perfect fluid with negative density and a source - free radial electric or magnetic field . with this set - up , they proved that their wormhole was linearly stable under both spherical and axial perturbations  @xcite .",
    "it seems to be the first example of a stable wormhole without a thin - shell in general relativity .",
    "their result clearly shows that the stability of a wormhole does not only depend on the metric , but also on the matter content supporting the wormhole .",
    "interestingly , the center - of - mass energy of a collision between two particles is independent of the matter content supporting the wormhole .",
    "the possible instability suggested by the bsw effect can thus be a useful tool to study the instability of the spacetime .    in this paper",
    ", we will investigate the collision of two particles in the teo wormhole spacetime . such",
    "a metric was proposed by teo in  @xcite and describes a simple rotating wormhole . because of the absence of any event horizon , the process is different from the bsw effect .",
    "we find that the spin of the wormhole dramatically changes the picture .",
    "non - rotating teo wormholes can not be accelerators in a particle collisional scenario , while rotating teo wormholes can potentially accelerate particles and create collisions with a high center - of - mass energy .",

    "in this section , we will investigate the motion of a test - particle in the teo wormhole spacetime , which is a simple example of a rotating wormhole and was suggested by teo in  @xcite .",

    "1 shows that this time is finite .",
    "we remind the reader that a critical particle with a fine - tuned angular momentum reaches the event horizon in the extremal kerr black hole spacetime in an infinite proper time .",
    "now we want to study the collision of two particles , say particle  @xmath93 with rest mass @xmath94 and particle  @xmath95 with rest mass @xmath96 .",
    "the center - of - mass energy of the collision is @xmath97 where @xmath98 and @xmath99 are defined by @xmath100 and @xmath101 respectively , for particle @xmath102 and @xmath95 , and where @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 , and @xmath106 are @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 , and @xmath57 for @xmath102 and @xmath95 .",
    "we are interested in the collisions of two particles falling into the rotating wormhole from the two flat regions . with this set - up",
    ", we have @xmath110 .",

    "if the wormhole is static and spherically symmetric , namely @xmath116 , the center - of - mass energy of the head - on collision of the two particles at the wormhole throat  @xmath32 is @xmath117 if the wormhole throat is small @xmath118 , the center - of - mass energy for the particle collision can be large .",
    "however , this requires that the particles have a large conserved energy @xmath119 to reach the wormhole throat .",
    "the conclusion is that the static and spherical symmetric teo wormhole can not be used as particle accelerator in the particle collisional scenario .",
    "if the wormhole is small in size and it is fast - rotating , namely @xmath120 , @xmath121 , and @xmath122 , and if the conserved angular momenta @xmath104 for the particles @xmath102 and @xmath95 are negative , the center - of - mass energy of a head - on collision of two particles at the wormhole throat  @xmath32 is given by @xmath123 @xmath124 can be very large even if the initial energy at infinity is small .",
    "we thus find that rotating teo wormholes can be particle accelerators if they are small .",
    "in the teo wormhole spacetime , particles can reach the wormhole throat from an initial point in the flat regions in a finite proper time .",
    "this is an important difference with respect to the bsw process in an extremal kerr black hole spacetime , because here a collision with a high center - of - mass energy is possible in a finite proper time .",
    "moreover , we do not require any fine - tuning of the particle angular momentum or of the particle charge in order to reach a high center - of - mass energy .",
    "the center - of - mass energy of the particles near the wormhole throat can be very large if the wormhole is rotating fast and if its size is small , namely the parameter @xmath5 is small ( @xmath120 , @xmath121 , and @xmath122 ) . if the energy of the center - of - mass is sufficiently high , the collision could generate a black hole near the wormhole .",
    "our result can thus be interpreted as an indication that fast - rotating wormholes with small @xmath5 are unstable against particle collisions in the vicinity of the wormhole throat .",
    "we note that such a conclusion is independent of the matter content responsible for the existence of the wormhole .",
    "usual considerations on the wormhole stability are instead based on the study of small perturbations around the background metric and the matter configuration . because of this dependence of the matter content , in the wormhole cases it is not really possible to point out any analogy between particle collisions with high center - of - mass energy and instabilities depending on the matter content .",
    "however , the presence of an instability related to the collision of two particles with a high center - of - mass energy might become a useful tool to investigate the stability of gravitating objects .    even if we accept the hypothesis that some observed astrophysical objects like the supermassive bodies in galactic nuclei might be wormholes , the high rotating condition would not be achieved .",
    "our result may instead be relevant for wormhole formations .",
    "the creation of wormholes is still an open problem , although some authors are challenging this issue ( see e.g.  @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "wormholes might have been created in the early universe , because of quantum fluctuations in spacetime topology  @xcite , and enlarged to classical size  @xcite .",
    "if the particle collision with high center - of - mass energy in rotating wormhole spacetimes implies the instability of a wormhole , we may constrain the initial condition of rotating wormholes and the growth process .",
    "the fact that the collision of two particles has a high center - of - mass energy does not imply that an observer at infinity can detect very high energy radiation produced in the process , as such a radiation may be strongly affected by gravitational redshift .",
    "for instance , very energetic particles created in a collisional penrose process  @xcite in an extremal or almost extremal kerr black spacetime can not escape to infinity with a high energy or equivalently , very massive particles can not reach a distant observer  @xcite .",
    "the result is different in the reissner - nordstrm black hole case , in which a charged particle with a very high energy or a very large rest mass can do it  @xcite . recently ,",
    "the details of the collisional penrose process in an extremal kerr spacetime have been re - examined  @xcite .",
    "zaslavskii investigated a head - on particle collision and a collisional penrose process in a general spacetime without horizons or naked singularities  @xcite . using the notation in our eq .",
    "( [ eq : metric ] ) , he considered a spacetime with @xmath125 but arbitrary small at the collision point . in this sense , the spacetime is almost extremal , although there is no horizon .",
    "the teo wormhole spacetime discussed in this paper is quite different . as it can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ eq : n ] ) , @xmath126 is always larger than 1 , so it never becomes small .",
    "our process is thus the first example of particle collision with high center - of - mass energy in a spacetime with no event horizons , no naked singularities , and not being extremal at all .",
    "a rapidly - rotating teo wormhole has an ergoregion where a collisional penrose process can occur like in the ergosphere in the kerr spacetime and in the generalized ergoregion  @xcite in the the reissner - nordstrm spacetime .",
    "the details of the collisional penrose process in the teo wormhole spacetime will be discussed in a future work .",
    "our result does not mean that any static and spherical symmetric wormhole can not accelerate particles .",
    "we can consider static and spherical symmetric wormhole spacetimes in which particles with small conserved energy can reach the wormhole throat and therefore some wormholes can be used to accelerate particles , see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite , pages 159 - 160 .",
    "we conclude with a comment on exact solutions of rotating wormholes . recently ,",
    "rotating ellis wormholes with a phantom scalar field were investigated numerically in four  @xcite and in five dimensions  @xcite .",
    "the authors found that there is an upper bound for the wormhole angular momentum .",
    "however , this does not imply that highly rotating wormholes can not exist , since the key point is the matter content responsible for the spacetime geometry .",
    "the teo wormhole metric was introduced to study concretely the properties of wormholes that can rotate fast and do not have any horizon  @xcite .",
    "it is not an exact solution generated by a specific matter content .",
    "we hope that this paper will stimulate the investigations of rapidly - rotating wormholes .",
    "the authors would like to thank tomohiro harada , ken - ichi nakao , and oleg b. zaslavskii for valuable comments .",
    "the authors were supported by the nsfc grant no .",
    "11305038 , the shanghai municipal education commission grant for innovative programs no .",
    "14zz001 , the thousand young talents program , and fudan university .",
    "this appendix is devoted to the collision of two particles in the ellis wormhole spacetime .",
    "the ellis wormhole  @xcite was the first example of traversable wormhole of the morris - thorne class  @xcite .",
    "the line element is given by @xmath127 where @xmath5 is a positive constant .",
    "since the spacetime is spherical symmetric , we can consider the motion on the equatorial plane @xmath19 without loss of generality . as we have done in the teo wormhole case , we can define an effective potential @xmath128 as @xmath129 the effective potential @xmath128 is a monotonically decreasing function of @xmath130 and has a maximum at the throat @xmath32 .    the center - of - mass energy of the collision of two particles is @xmath131 where @xmath132 for @xmath102 and @xmath95 . at the throat @xmath32 , the center - of - mass energy in a head - on collision of two particles and the effective potential",
    "are exactly the same as in the teo wormhole spacetime with @xmath116 .",
    "therefore the ellis wormhole can not be a high - energy particle collider , just like the static and spherical symmetric teo wormhole .",
    "the scalar curvature @xmath133 on the equatorial plane ( @xmath19 ) in the teo wormhole is given by @xmath134 as shown in sec .",
    "iii , in the case of a wormhole of small size and high spin , namely @xmath120 , @xmath121 , and @xmath122 , the teo wormhole can work as a high - energy particle collider .",
    "it turns out that , in such a situation , the absolute value of the scalar curvature @xmath133 is very large at the throat on the equatorial plane . on the contrary , in the non - rotating case @xmath116 , the teo wormhole can not be used as a high - energy particle collider and eq .",
    "( [ eq : scalar_curvature ] ) shows that the scalar curvature @xmath133 vanishes everywhere .",
    "such a finding between curvature and center - of - mass energy may suggest that the possibility of an efficient particle acceleration requires a large @xmath135 .",
    "actually , this is not true .",
    "the scalar curvature @xmath133 in the ellis wormhole is given by @xmath136 at the wormhole throat @xmath32 , this gives @xmath137 . in the small @xmath5 case ,",
    "the absolute value of the scalar curvature is large at the throat @xmath32 .",
    "however , the ellis wormhole with small @xmath5 can not be a high - energy particle collider as seen in appendix  a. we thus conclude that the scalar curvature @xmath133 is not a good indicator to understand the possibility of the creation of high energy collision between two particles .",

    "<S> we study the collision of two particles in the teo wormhole spacetime , in which the wormhole is stationary and axisymmetric . </S>",
    "<S> we show that a non - rotating teo wormhole can not be a particle accelerator , while a rotating teo wormhole can be used to accelerate particles and create high energy collisions because of the deep effective potential of the colliding particles . </S>",
    "<S> the process is different from that in the vicinity of a near - extremal black hole , since here there is no event horizon . </S>",
    "<S> this is the first example of particle collision with high center - of - mass energy in a spacetime with no event horizon , no naked singularity , and not being extremal in a clear sense . </S>",
    "<S> the process can unlikely have direct implications for astrophysical observations , but it is interesting as a tool to investigate wormhole instabilities . </S>"
