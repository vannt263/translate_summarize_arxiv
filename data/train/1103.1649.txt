    "the decade or so preceding the development of qcd saw tremendous effort devoted to describing hadronic interactions in terms of @xmath20-matrix theory and self - consistency relations .",
    "one of the profound discoveries of that era was the remarkable relationship between low - energy hadronic cross sections and their high - energy behavior , in which the former on average appears to mimic certain features of the latter .    at low energies ,",
    "one expects the hadronic scattering amplitude to be dominated by just a few resonance poles . as the energy increases , the density of resonances in each partial wave , as well as the number of partial waves itself , grows , making it harder to identify contributions from individual resonances , and more useful to describe the scattering amplitude in terms of a sum of @xmath21-channel regge poles and cuts .",
