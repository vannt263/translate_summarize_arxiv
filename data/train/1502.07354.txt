    "the idea of a weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) has guided the research in dark matter ( dm ) over the last three decades  @xcite . in the standard cosmological scenario wimps",
    "are produced thermally in the early universe , with an abundance of particles today fixed at the time of thermal ( chemical ) decoupling .",
    "the energy density in wimps is mainly determined by their self - annihilation rates into the standard model sector . for particles with masses and couplings at the electroweak scale",
    "the energy density in thermal relics roughly coincides with the known abundance of dm .",
    "particles with these properties appear in e.g. supersymmetric extensions to the standard model , and this coincidence is usually known as the  wimp miracle . \"    however , there are alternatives that deserve to be considered seriously . we know that the amount of baryons in the universe is not determined at thermal decoupling , but by an asymmetry between the number densities of particles and antiparticles",
    "something similar could have also happened to dm  @xcite . if in addition to the existence of a nonvanishing conserved charge , dm is described in terms of a boson particle that was in thermal equilibrium with the constituents of the standard model in the early universe , it is natural to think that the zero - mode could have developed a nonvanishing expectation value , leading to the appearance of a cosmological bose - einstein condensate ( bec )  @xcite .",
    "we call this scenario _ asymmetric condensed dark matter_. other proposals with a similar spirit have been previously considered under many different names  @xcite .",
    "see also refs .",
    "@xcite for similar ideas in the context of the qcd axion , where unlike the case considered here dm never thermalizes with the standard model particles in the early universe .    in this paper",
    "we identify four conditions that , together , guarantee the appearance of a cosmological thermal condensate of particles that could match the totality of the cold dark matter ( cdm ) today :    1 .",
    "dm is described in terms of a boson field with a conserved current , 2 .",
    "there is a nonvanishing total boson charge with the right amount in the universe , 3 .",
    "the boson was in thermal ( kinetic and chemical ) equilibrium with the particles in the standard model , 4 .",
    "thermal decoupling took place at an energy scale below the critical temperature of condensation .    under these assumptions",
    "we conclude that a thermal bec can only emerge from a relativistic process , and that the particles composing the condensate should be much lighter than standard wimps .",
    "this requires dm - to - photon ratios that are at least eight orders of magnitude larger than in the case of baryons , a point that deserves further attention .",
    "it is this large asymmetry what makes it possible that light particles are nonrelativistic in spite of being in thermal equilibrium in the early universe .",
    "the interaction of the dm bosons with the standard model particles must be very weak , even more than the weak nuclear force , although strong enough to reach early thermal equilibrium .",
    "we speculate about the possibility that the gravitational interaction alone could bring the dm bosons into thermal equilibrium with standard model particles , but the naive analysis we present in this paper deserves a further study in terms of the boltzmann equation .",
    "figure  [ fig : cosmological evolution ] in section  [ sec : becdm ] summarizes the main features of this proposal , that remain valid if the condensate contributes only to a partial fraction of the total cdm in the universe .",
    "note that the four conditions above lead to a macroscopic excitation of the zero - mode that in the present universe is not precisely a thermal bec by the standard definition , i.e. it has not been in thermal equilibrium since dm decoupling .",
    "we will nonetheless refer to this state as the _ condensate _ in this paper .",
    "we should emphasize that the description of a thermal condensate we present here is only valid as long as the expansion rate of the universe is lower than the characteristic frequency of oscillation of the zero - mode .",
    "furthermore , in order to not affect the abundance of light elements predicted in the standard cosmological scenario the dm particles should be already decoupled from the thermal plasma before the outset of big - bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) , and then we can not extrapolate the results in this work to candidates lighter than around @xmath0 .",
    "further constraints on the temperature of decoupling coming from the effective number of extra neutrino species increase this value to @xmath1 .",
    "particles with a mass below this number require a more detailed analysis that we leave for another paper .",
    "we also stress that our motivation here is purely phenomenological , and we do not develop any specific boson candidate ( a possible particle realization is discussed in e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite , see also  @xcite ) .",
    "rather , we assume an asymmetry and an early stage of thermal equilibrium , and explore the consequences of demanding a late - time coherent behavior on the model .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : formalism ] we review some basics on quantum fields in curved spaces , and frame the idea of a cosmological thermal condensate of scalar particles within our current understanding of physical theory .",
    "then in section  [ sec : becdm ] we use some basic cosmological observations to constraint the parameters of the boson as a model of dm .",
    "finally , we conclude in section  [ sec : discussion ] with a brief discussion of the main results of this paper .",
    "let us first consider the general problem of a cosmological gravitating condensate .",
    "in this paper we assume that the spacetime metric is a classical object , but matter is described in the language of quantum field theory .",
    "this picture is expected to be appropriate as long as we are only interested in describing physical processes taking place well outside the planck regime , with the classical spacetime and the quantum matter fields connected through the semiclassical einstein field equations , @xmath2 . here",
    "@xmath3 is the einstein tensor , @xmath4 denotes newton s gravitational constant , and @xmath5 is the expectation value of the energy - momentum tensor operator , discussed further below .    in this section",
    "we consider the case of a cosmological gas of bosons in thermal equilibrium . at this point",
    "we do not need to specify how this thermal regime could have been achieved ( and even supported ) in practice .",
    "the process of dm decoupling , essential for any sensible condensate model , is discussed next in section  [ sec : becdm ] .",
    "we restrict our attention to the case of a massive , complex scalar field with an internal @xmath6 global symmetry and no self - interactions .",
    "associated with the global symmetry there is a conserved current , and then ( crucially ) the possibility to have a non vanishing conserved charge .",
    "the generalization to more involved fields and/or symmetries is possible , but we do not consider it here .",
    "classically , the scalar field @xmath7 satisfies the klein - gordon equation , @xmath8 with @xmath9 the dalembert operator in four dimensions and @xmath10 a generic point in the spacetime manifold . a minimal coupling between the scalar field and",

    "this charge essentially represents the difference between the number of particles and antiparticles in the configuration .",
    "@xmath50    *    @xmath50    next we derive a number of cosmologically - relevant expressions for this model .",
    "note that many of these equations would also apply if there are no conserved charges in the dark sector , @xmath51 , in which case it is not possible to develop a thermal condensate of dm particles . for a matter component described in terms of a real field particles and antiparticles coincide , and we can not define properly a conserved charge operator @xmath52 in the system . however , if this field were not coupled to the standard model of particle physics ( or if the interactions with this sector were weak enough ) , it could be possible to reach a diluted state of nonrelativistic kinetic equilibrium where , at the effective level , the number of particles were conserved .",
    "note however that this state would not be in chemical equilibrium with the cosmological thermal plasma , as we assume in this paper .",
    "it has been recently proposed that this could happen for the qcd axions  @xcite , where the particles are generated initially in a low momentum state through a misalignment of the vacuum in the early universe  @xcite , although there is still some debate in the literature  @xcite . in any case",
    ", the temperature in axions would not coincide with the temperature of the standard model particles , and then the results in this paper do not necessarily apply there .      in this section",
    "we apply a simple analysis in field theory to describe an asymmetric thermal gas of bosons in an expanding universe .",
    "we concentrate on the appearance of a cosmological condensate in the limiting case of a relativistic regime . as we will find next in section  [ sec : becdm ] the condensation of a dm component in equilibrium with the thermal plasma is necessarily a relativistic process , and then a relativistic analysis is mandatory for the purposes of this paper .    in absence of gravity ,",
    "the emergence of a thermal condensate has been extensively considered in the literature  @xcite .",
    "let us now focus on the case in which the boson particles live on a spatially flat , homogeneous and isotropic universe . under this assumption",
    "the spacetime metric can be written in the form @xmath53 here @xmath54 is the cosmological time , @xmath55 the scale factor , and @xmath56 a set of comoving spatial coordinates . without any loss of generality we can choose @xmath57 today , when comoving and physical quantities coincide . to proceed , we require a set of normal modes adapted to the cosmological background . because there is no timelike killing vector field associated to the line - element in eq .",
    "( [ eq.frw ] ) , there will not exist a set of normal modes in the form of ordinary plane - waves , and most of the results in flat spacetime do not formally apply .",
    "however , if the expansion rate of the universe is not too large , @xmath58 , we can still write @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the hubble parameter , and @xmath61 the dispersion relation of the scalar particle . we are imposing periodic boundary conditions over a box of _ comoving _ size @xmath62 , with @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 . note that the wavenumber @xmath66 labels the different mode - functions in eq .",
    "( [ cosmo.waves ] ) , and that the mode - energies @xmath67 depend only on @xmath68 ; this is a consequence of the symmetries associated to the slices of constant cosmological time @xmath69 .",
    "however , the spacetime background is not static , and then the dispersion relation is time - dependent .",
    "remember that we are interested in describing a condensate in an _",
    "infinite _ homogeneous and isotropic flat universe ,",
    "and then we can switch to the continuum , @xmath70 , if necessary .    the functions in eq .",

    "( [ cosmo.waves ] ) describes the whole spectrum of mode - functions to the next - to - leading order in the adiabatic approximation . in this paper",
    "we will be interested only in a description of the condensate to the zeroth order in this series expansion , and then we will not keep factors of @xmath73 in the final expressions .",
    "we are mainly interested in obtaining cosmological _ thermal _ expectation values .",
    "first , however , we need to clarify some issues related with the vacuum of the theory .",
    "formally , the expectation value of a quantity that is quadratic or higher order in field operators diverges , even when it is evaluated on the vacuum state .",
    "see for instance the hamiltonian as a particular realization of a quadratic operator with ultraviolet divergences .",
    "we should then use some regularization / renormalization prescription in order to obtain , from these quantities , well defined objects when acting on physical states .",
    "there are different methods to renormalize higher order operators , such as proper - time regularization , dimensional regularization , zeta - function regularization , point - splitting regularization , or adiabatic regularization  @xcite . for the case of a homogeneous and isotropic universe",
    "the simplest choice is probably adiabatic regularization .",
    "this prescription was employed for the first time by parker in  @xcite , and we can use this technique to identify sensible vacuum expectation values from ill - defined higher order operators . while important on their own , these vacuum contributions are not really relevant for the problem we want to address in this paper , and we will simply omit them in all the expressions below ( see for instance refs .",
    "@xcite for a renormalized energy - momentum tensor in the context of an expanding homogeneous and isotropic universe ) . in practice",
    ", this is essentially equivalent to impose standard normal ordering , e.g. @xmath74 , @xmath75 , on higher order operators , and ignore the divergent zero - point contributions to the expectation values .",
    "with all these assumptions the hamiltonian and the scalar charge in eq .",
    "( [ eq.thermal.exp ] ) simplify to @xmath76 where , as mentioned above , we have omitted nondiagonal terms in the expression for the hamiltonian operator that are suppressed by factors of @xmath73 in the series expansion . for completeness , the operator representing the total number of particles ( including antiparticles ) is by definition given by @xmath77 .    since the hamiltonian and the scalar charge commute , @xmath78=0 $ ] , we can choose a basis of the hilbert space in which both @xmath47 and @xmath52 are diagonal .",
    "to the zeroth order in the adiabatic expansion the hamiltonian and the scalar charge also commute with the number operators , @xmath79=[\\hat{n}_{\\vec{k}}^b,\\hat{h}]=[\\hat{n}_{\\vec{k}}^a,\\hat{q}]=[\\hat{n}_{\\vec{k}}^b,\\hat{q}]=0 $ ] , and we can then use e.g. the basis obtained using the fock construction , where all the elements have a definite number of particles and antiparticles .",
    "this choice simplifies the analysis , since only the terms in the diagonal of an operator can contribute to the expectation value @xmath80 in this basis .",
    "this is what happens , for instance , in the case of the energy - momentum tensor , where in practice we can just forget the other terms in @xmath81 different to @xmath82 . here",

    "we have taken the @xmath97 limit in the size of the comoving normalizing box , and approximated sums over energy states by integrals over wavenumbers , @xmath98 .",

    "@xcite for an example in the cosmology literature ) . however , the density of momentum states @xmath99 vanishes at @xmath100 , and then the zero - mode is not contained in the previous integrals . that is the reason for which it has been necessary to write @xmath101 , @xmath102 , @xmath103 , and @xmath104 ( overbars omitted ) explicitly in eqs .",

    "then , the critical temperature of condensation decreases with the cosmological expansion faster than the temperature of a universe in adiabatic expansion , where @xmath164 ( remember that it is the temperature of the cmb photons that determines the temperature of the gas , as long as they are in thermal equilibrium due to the self - annihilation of dm particles into the standard model sector ) . therefore , given an asymmetry between the number densities of particles and antiparticles , the condition @xmath165 is most easily satisfied in the _ early _ universe .",
    "let us explore in more detail this scenario for the case of dm particles .",
    "a potential cdm candidate requires , among other things , of an energy density with the right amount , @xmath166 , that is already decoupled from the thermal plasma at bbn and redshifts like a nonrelativistic component , @xmath167 , at matter - radiation equality .",
    "it is well known that particles with a mass less than about an ev that are produced thermally in the early universe can not contribute significantly to the present matter content .",
    "this is a consequence of the cowsik - mcclelland bound  @xcite , of which standard model neutrinos are a particular example .",
    "furthermore , the energy density in these low mass thermal particles redshifts with the cosmological expansion as radiation , @xmath168 , for a too large period exceeding the time of matter and radiation equality .",
    "they are therefore not a good prospect for cdm .",
    "let us see how this picture is modified in presence of an asymmetry .    for an asymmetric component the interactions with the thermal plasma can accommodate a significant amount of charge density in the ground state zero - mode .",
    "the particles in a condensate behave like standard cdm , at least at the level of the background universe , and as long as the temperature is not close to the critical temperature of condensation so that the charge in the zero - mode does not change substantially with cosmic expansion , @xmath169 ( we already argued that the condensation is a very sharp process , and as we will find next for any sensible candidate the temperature of decoupling is always well below the critical temperature of condensation ) . in order to see this note that , according to the identities in eq .",
    "( [ eq.rho.p.rel ] ) , the particles in the condensate contribute to the energy density and pressure of the gas in the form @xmath170 , @xmath157 . the charge conservation within a comoving volume , @xmath171 , guarantees then the standard density evolution of a nonrelativistic component , @xmath167 .",
    "note that since @xmath172 , the amount of cdm is now fixed by an asymmetry , and it is not the result of the relics left dynamically at thermal decoupling ( we will discuss about the relics left by a thermal condensate later in this section ) .",
    "there is no problem _ a priori _ with low mass candidates as long as they are not too light , @xmath173 , so that the description in this paper applies and the previous simple arguments make sense . here",
    "@xmath174 is the value of the hubble parameter at thermal decoupling . since dm should be already decoupled at bbn , that imposes the constraint @xmath175 on the mass of the scalar particle .",
    "later in section  [ subsection.2 ] we will increase this number to @xmath1 using current bounds on the effective number of extra relativistic species .",
    "candidates lighter than this value require a more detailed analysis that we leave for another paper .",
    "once the particles are decoupled from the thermal plasma the occupation numbers get frozen and they just redshift with the volume of the universe , @xmath176 .",
    "this guarantees that the condensate does not evaporate if it did not before the time of decoupling , even if the temperature of the universe can grow above the critical temperature of condensation at later times ( actually the critical temperature is not even well defined if the gas is not in thermal equilibrium ) .",

    "note that , for a fixed value of the mass of the scalar particle , the condensate is present until the temperature of the universe reaches the critical temperature of condensation , when the condensate in principle disappears : if we move from the right to the left in figure  [ fig : cosmological evolution ] following horizontal lines we eventually leave the shaded region .",
    "that means that we need to break thermal equilibrium before reaching that point , so that the amount of charge in the condensate freezes out .",
    "furthermore , in order to do not affect the abundance of light elements predicted in the standard cosmological scenario , the temperature of decoupling should be at least as high as the temperature in the universe at the beginning of bbn , @xmath210 .",

    "let us now discuss these two constraints in turn",
    ".      if the mass of the scalar particle is too large , @xmath241ev , the thermal relics will be nonrelativistic today , @xmath244ev , and they will contribute to the mass density of the universe according to @xmath245 where @xmath246 , @xmath247 , @xmath248 , @xmath180 , and today @xmath227 .",

    "however , since we are now dealing with relativistic relics , and contrary to what happens in section  [ subsection.1 ] , this contribution is not sensitive to the actual mass of the particles .",
    "an analysis by cyburt _",
    "et al _ combining observations of the primordial @xmath265he mass fraction , light element abundances , and baryon - to - photon ratio ( @xmath266+d / h@xmath267+@xmath268 ) results in an upper bound of @xmath269 at 68%cl to the extra neutrino species at bbn  @xcite , and then in a lower bound of @xmath270 to the effective number of relativistic species contributing to the entropy density also at bbn . using the latest data provided by the planck collaboration in a joint cmb+bbn analysis ( d+_planck _ tt , te , ee+lowp ) , @xmath271  @xcite , we can improve this bound to @xmath272 , now at 95%cl .",
    "note however that this latter constraint applies only for dm bosons of mass less than about an ev , which are still relativistic at recombination .",
    "these values of @xmath235 lie around the scale of the qcd phase transition , @xmath273mev , where the baryons and mesons are formed and the number of massless degrees of freedom drops drastically from @xmath274 to @xmath275 .",
    "we can then conclude that @xmath276 for an asymmetric condensed dm candidate .",
    "two comments are in order here .",
    "first , since the number of massless degrees of freedom in the standard model is constrained to @xmath226 , then there is a lower bound for the number of extra neutrino species : @xmath277 .",
    "this value is around the sensitivity of @xmath278 on @xmath279 expected from future measurements of the polarization of the cmb  @xcite , and then the cosmological observations could test the viability of this model soon .",
    "second , the lower bound of @xmath280 on the temperature of freeze out is related to the self - annihilation , dm+dm@xmath281sm+sm , and elastic scattering , dm+sm@xmath281dm+sm , cross sections associated to the processes that maintained the condensate in chemical and kinetic equilibrium with the thermal plasma in the early universe , respectively , and then to the strength of the interactions between dm and standard model particles . as a consequence of this high value of the temperature of dm decoupling the interaction of the bosons with the standard model particles",
    "should be very weak , even weaker than in the case of ordinary wimps , where e.g. @xmath282mev for neutrinos . , but there this is a consequence of the rarefaction of the gas due to the unbalanced self - annihilation of dm into standard model particles , and not of the weakness of the interactions .",
    "] note also in figure  [ fig : cosmological evolution ] that for the allowed range of masses of the scalar particle the critical temperature of condensation is always above the temperature at which thermal equilibrium broke down , and also above the temperature of bbn .",
    "this would guarantee the survival of the coherent state to thermal evaporation , however , this point deserves a more detailed analysis of the kinetic and chemical decoupling in terms of the boltzmann equation in the presence of a condensate .",
    "let us come back to the general picture .",
    "one could imagine scenarios in which the condensate would represent only a fraction of the total cdm in the universe , the remainder being in the form of standard thermal relics or any other candidate to dm . in this scenario",
    "the lines in figure  [ fig : cosmological evolution ] dividing the high - density / low - density , and the condensed / non - condensed , phases move down ( note that they are sensitive to the asymmetry of the universe , and in particular they disappear if @xmath283 ) , but the other information in the figure remains unaltered .",
    "this does not affect , in particular , the conclusion that the thermal relics accompanying the condensate are hot , nor the upper bound we found previously in section  [ subsection.1 ] for the mass of the scalar particles .",
    "thermal relics of mass @xmath284ev would contribute to the energy density of the universe as hot dm , and they can not represent a significant part of the matter content .  @xcite . in order to not erase dwarf galaxies , @xmath285 , and heavier structures we should demand @xmath286 .",
    "] then , if there are no more particles in the universe apart from the dm boson and the constituents of the standard model , we can conclude that the totality of the cdm should be necessarily in a light condensate , or in the form of heavy thermal relics , but we can not have a combination of both .",
    "this last statement could be avoided , of course , if we had another component of dm ( apart from the boson particles that conform the condensate ) in the form of e.g. wimps , but the previous constraints on the scalar particles still apply .",
    "to summarize , the scalar dm scenario we presented in this paper has necessarily a condensed and a thermal component .",
    "the condensed component is essentially determined by a charge asymmetry , which must be substantial to provide enough cdm . lest the thermal component represent _ too much _ dm ( or the right amount , but with wiping out too much small - scale structure ) , it must be lighter than about a hundred of ev s , and then the dm boson must decouple at high temperature so that it does not add a light degree of freedom during bbn .",
    "these constraints remain even if the scalar dm particles comprise just a significant part , rather than all , of the observed cdm .",
    "@xmath50    *    @xmath50    since early decoupling is crucial , it is worth some discussion here .",
    "the question of decoupling is intimately related with the question of what led the system into thermal equilibrium . for a standard thermal candidate",
    "it is usually argued that gravity is not sufficient , and there should be an additional interaction , usually the weak nuclear force , that couples dm to the particles in the standard model . here",
    "the argument goes as follows  @xcite : for gravity the interaction rate scales like @xmath287 , where @xmath288 and @xmath289 . on the other hand , during the radiation dominated era the hubble parameter is proportional to @xmath290 , and then decoupling , @xmath291 , occurs at @xmath292 .",
    "we can not trust these expressions at the planck scale , and then we conclude that the gravitational interaction alone could not have brought the early universe into thermal equilibrium .",
    "however , for the case of an asymmetric dm component the number of particles scales with @xmath293 , and we can then conclude that @xmath294 . for ultralight candidates , @xmath295 , the interaction rate increases with respect to the standard scenario and decoupling is expected to take place well after the planck era , where we can now rely on these expressions .",
    "this is of course only a very naive picture ; a more accurate treatment would employ the boltzmann equation  @xcite to treat the decoupling process in the presence of a condensate .",
    "we leave this analysis for a future work .",
    "in this paper we have considered the possibility that much or all of the cdm in the universe results from an asymmetry between the number densities of particles and antiparticles , rather by the abundance of thermal relics frozen out at the time of thermal decoupling .",
    "we have identified three conditions that , if satisfied , guarantee the appearance of a thermal bec during the early stages of the universe : @xmath201  dm is described in terms of a boson field with a conserved current ; @xmath203  there is a nonvanishing total boson charge in the universe ; and @xmath205  the boson was in thermal ( kinetic and chemical ) equilibrium with the particles in the standard model .",
    "if , in addition , @xmath296  thermal decoupling took place at an energy scale below the critical temperature of condensation , then the macroscopic excitation of the ground state freezes out and could survive the ensuing cosmological evolution until now .",
    "note that for the purposes of this paper we did not need to develop any boson candidate , not even specify whether they are fundamental , or just an effective low energy description , e.g. made of pairs of fermions .",
    "we have estimated the charge asymmetry required to account for the totality of the cdm using the condensate , but do not address here how this large asymmetry would have arisen .    according to our findings",
    "there is an upper limit on the mass of the dm particles in a thermal bec .",
    "this is because in this model the macroscopic excitation of the zero - mode has a relativistic origin and then , apart from the condensate , there will be thermal relics in an abundance close to that of the photons in the cmb .",
    "these particles must then have masses lower than around @xmath297ev so that their density is below the current cosmological constraints ( compare this with the unitarity bound @xmath298 one finds in the case of ordinary wimps  @xcite ) .",
    "the existence of thermal relics could also alter the success of bbn . in order to not contribute in excess to the effective number of neutrino species",
    "the relics should be cold enough , that is , they should decouple early on in the history of the universe . using the latest bbn and bbn+cmb observational data we obtain that the dm bosons should be already decoupled at the time of the qcd phase transition , when the temperature of the universe was of the order of @xmath299mev . as a consequence",
    "the interaction between the dm particles that conform the condensate and those in the standard model should be even weaker than the weak nuclear force .",
    "we speculate about the possibility that gravity alone could be the responsible of the early thermal equilibrium .",
    "incidentally , there is a lower bound to the excess of neutrino species predicted by an asymmetric condensed dm component , @xmath277 .",
    "this value could be resolved in the next future using cmb data , and then test the viability of the model .",
    "let us emphasize that , in spite of the early thermal equilibrium , the particles in a dm condensate could be as light as @xmath300ev and behave like a nonrelativistic component in terms of their background `` equation of state . ''",
    "( for candidates of masses lower than this value the decoupling from the thermal plasma necessarily occurs during the regime of fast expansion , @xmath301 , and then a more elaborate analysis is necessary to treat the phenomenology of ultralight particles . )",
    "we usually tend to think of thermal cold candidates as particles with large masses , as happens in e.g. the standard _ symmetric _ cosmological scenario .",
    "however , if dm is described in terms of a boson field , there is another possibility to cool the particles in the universe : giving them a large asymmetry at the expense of low masses .",
    "note that even though the input of the asymmetric condensed dm scenario is very similar to that of ordinary wimps ( i.e. a thermal quantum field theory ) , the output differs drastically : whereas at the effective level we can think of wimps as a collection of classical _ particles _ , the condensate is described in terms of a classical _ field _ theory .",
    "this can affect , for instance , the process of structure formation at small scales , leading to possible interesting observational consequences in the late - time universe  @xcite .",
    "the analysis in this paper complements the standard thermal scenario of a boson dm candidate ( without an asymmetry , or with an asymmetry much lower than the value reported in eq .",
    "( [ eq : eta_dm ] ) , so that the quantum bose statistics is blurred by the classical maxwellian distribution for most of the history of the universe ) , and indicates that a boson particle that was in thermal equilibrium with the constituents of the standard model of particle physics should be in a condensate , or in the form of thermal relics , but we can not have a combination of both aspects contributing significantly to the matter content today .    we are grateful to patrick draper , alma gonzalez - morales , david marsh , chanda prescod - weinstein , stefano profumo , tanja rindler - daller and luis urea - lopez for useful comments and discussions .",
