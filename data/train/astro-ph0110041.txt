    "the modulation of the @xmath0-ray light curves at gev energies testifies to the production of @xmath0-ray radiation in the pulsar magnetospheres either at the polar cap ( harding , tademaru , & esposito 1978 ; daugherty & harding 1982 , 1996 ; michel 1991 ; sturner , dermer , & michel 1995 ; shibata , miyazaki , & takahara 1998 ; harding & muslimov 1998 ; zhang & harding 2000 ) , or at the vacuum gaps in the outer magnetosphere ( e.g. , cheng , ho , & ruderman 1986a , b , hereafter chra , b ) . both of these pictures have had some success in reproducing global properties of the observed emission .",
    "however , there is an important difference between these two models : an polar gap accelerator releases very little angular momenta , while outer gap one could radiate them efficiently .",
    "more specifically , the total angular momentum loss rate must equal the energy loss rate divided by the angular velocity of the star , implying an average location of energy loss on the light cylinder ( cohen & treves 1972 ; holloway 1977 ; shibata 1995 ) , of which distance from the rotation axis is given by @xmath1 where @xmath2 denotes the angular frequency of the neutron star , and @xmath3 the speed of light .    on these grounds ,",
    "the purpose here is to explore a little further into a model of an outer gap , which is located near the light cylinder . if the outer magnetosphere is filled with a plasma so that the space charge density is equal to the goldreich - julian density , @xmath4 , then the field - aligned electric field vanishes , where @xmath5 is the component of the magnetic field along the rotational axis .",
    "however , the depletion of charge in the goldreich and julian model in a region where it could not be resupplied , may cause a vacuum region to develop .",
    "holloway ( 1973 ) pointed out the possibility that a region which lacks plasma is formed around the surface on which @xmath6 changes its sign .",
    "subsequently , chra , b developed a version of an outer magnetospheric @xmath0-ray emission zone in which acceleration in the holloway gaps above the null surface , where @xmath5 vanishes , brought particles to large lorentz factors ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "after chra , b , many outer - gap models have been proposed ( chiang & romani 1992 , 1994 ; romani & yadigaroglu 1995 ; romani 1996 ; zhang & cheng 1997 ; cheng , ruderman & zhang 2000 ) .",
    "their basic idea is as follows : a deviation of the charge density from @xmath8 results in an electric field along the magnetic field , @xmath9 .",
    "if this electric field becomes strong enough to accelerate @xmath10 pairs to ultrarelativistic energies , they could radiate @xmath0-rays tangential to the curved @xmath9 field lines there .",
    "the curvature @xmath0-rays may be converted into @xmath10 pairs via two photon collisions . in order to keep a steady current flow and the charge density @xmath8 in the regions outside the gap",
    ", the gap will grow until it is large enough and the electric field is strong enough to maintain a sufficient supply of charges to the rest of the open field line region .",
    "if the gap ends in a region where @xmath11 and @xmath12 , charges from the surrounding region may flow in through the end ( or the boundary ) . if both boundaries are located on the null surface , pairs produced in the gap will replace the charge deficiency inside the gap , and finally the gap will be filled up .",
    "however , if a vacuum gap extends to the light cylinder , the charged particles created in the gap should escape from the magnetosphere , so the gap would not be quenched .",
    "hence , stable outer gaps ( if they exist ) are those from the null surface to the light cylinder along the last - open field lines . in an outer gap , the inner boundary lies near the intersection of the null surface where @xmath8 vanishes and the boundary of the closed field lines of the star on which the magnetospheric current does not exits .    recently , solving the vlasov equations that describe a stationary pair production cascade , hirotani and shibata ( 2001a , b , papers vii and viii ) elucidated important characteristics of the particle acceleration zones in the outer magnetosphere .",
    "they demonstrated that a stationary gap does not extend between the null surface and the light cylinder .",
    "rather , their width ( @xmath13 ) along the field lines is adjusted so that a single particle emits copious @xmath0-rays one of which materialize as a pair in the gap on average .",
    "the resultant @xmath13 becomes about @xmath14 of @xmath15 in the case of the crab pulsar .",
    "the produced pairs in the gap do not completely cancel the acceleration field , because the particles do not accumulate at the gap boundaries .",
    "outside of the gap , the particles flows away from the gap along the magnetic field lines as a part of the global current flow pattern . in another word ,",
    "the remained , small - amplitude electric field along the magnetic field lines outside of the gap prevents the gap from quenching .",
    "moreover , they demonstrated that the gap position is not fixed as considered in previous outer gap models .",
    "their position shifts as the magnetospheric current flowing the gap changes .",
    "that is , if there is no particle injection across either of the boundaries , the gap is located around the null surface , as demonstrated in their earlier papers ( hirotani & shibata 1999a , b , c , papers  i , ii , iii ; hirotani 2000a , b , c , papers  iv , v , vi ; see also beskin et al .",
    "1992 and hirotani & okamoto 1998 for a pair - production avalanche in a black - hole magnetosphere ) .",
    "however , the gap position shifts towards the light cylinder ( or the star surface ) if the injected particle flux across the inner ( or the outer ) boundary approaches the goldreich - julian value . in other words , the accelerator can be located at any place in the magnetosphere ; their position is primarily constrained by the magnetospheric current .    in papers  vii and viii",
    ", they examined the outer gaps formed in the magnetospheres of young or millisecond pulsars , assuming a sub - goldreich - julian particle injection across the boundaries . in this paper , we apply the same method to a middle - aged pulsar b1055 - 52 and demonstrate that a stationary gap is maintained even if the injected particle flux exceeds the goldreich - julian value , and that the possibility of such a large particle flux injection is ruled out if we compare the predicted @xmath0-ray spectrum with observations .",
    "in the next section , we formulate the basic equations describing the stationary pair production cascade in the outer magnetosphere . in   3 ,",
    "we apply the method to a middle - aged pulsar , b  1055 - 52 and reveal that large magnetic inclination and a sub - goldreich - julian current are plausible for the outer - magnetospheric emission from this pulsar . in the final section ,",
    "we compare the results with previous works .",
    "we first consider the continuity equations of particles in   [ sec : cont ] , the boltzmann equations of @xmath0-rays in   [ sec : boltz_gamma ] .",
    "combining these equations with the poisson equation , we present the vlasov equations describing the one - dimensional electrodynamic structure of an accelerator along the field lines in   [ sec : reduction ] .",
    "we finally give appropriate boundary conditions in ",
    "[ sec : bd ] .      in the same manner as in papers  i - viii",
    ", we simply assume that the electrostatic and the curvature - radiation - reaction forces cancel each other in the boltzmann equations of particles . under this mono - energetic approximation ,",
    "the boltzmann equations reduce to continuity equations . assuming that the toroidal bending is negligible for the magnetic field",
    ", we obtain the following stationary ( @xmath16 ) continuity equations ( paper  vii ) , @xmath17 ,    \\label{eq : cont - eq}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 and @xmath19 represent the spatial densities of positrons and electrons , respectively , @xmath20 and @xmath21 the distribution functions of outwardly and inwardly propagating @xmath0-rays , respectively , and @xmath22 the strength of the magnetic field . the pair production redistribution functions @xmath23 can be defined as @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the pair - production cross section and @xmath26 refers to the collision angle between the @xmath0-rays and the x - rays with energy @xmath27 .",
    "x - ray number density between dimensionless energies @xmath28 and @xmath29 , is integrated over @xmath28 above the threshold energy @xmath30 to infinity .    in paper  vii",
    ", we adopted @xmath31 for the crab pulsar magnetosphere , in which a power - law x - ray component dominates the surface ones .",
    "however , in the present paper , we apply the theory to a middle - aged pulsar , b1055 - 52 , of which soft x - ray emission is dominated by surface components .",
    "we thus evaluate @xmath32 by the collision angle between the _ surface _ x - rays and the curvature @xmath0-rays .",
    "the collision approaches head - on ( or tail - on ) for inwardly ( or outwardly ) propagating @xmath0-rays , as the gap shifts towards the star .",
    "for simplicity , we assume that the outwardly ( or inwardly ) propagating @xmath0-rays dilate ( or constrict ) at the same rate with the magnetic field ; this assumption gives a good estimate when @xmath33 holds . under this assumption ,",
    "we obtain ( paper  vii ) @xmath34 where the redistribution function , @xmath35 , for the curvature - radiation is explicitly defined in equation  ( 12 ) in paper  vii ( see also rybicki , lightman 1979 ) .      as described at the end of   3 in paper  vii , it is convenient to introduce the debey scale length @xmath36 , where @xmath37 and @xmath38 is the magnetic field strength at the gap center .",
    "the dimensionless coordinate variable then becomes @xmath39 by using such dimensionless quantities , and by assuming that the transfield thickness of the gap is greater than @xmath13 , we can rewrite the poisson equation into the following one - dimensional form ( paper  vii ) : @xmath40 @xmath41      + \\frac{b_z(\\xi)}{{b_{\\rm cnt } } }    \\label{eq : basic-2}\\ ] ] where @xmath42 ; the particle densities are normalized by the goldreich - julian value as @xmath43 we evaluate @xmath44 at each point along the last - open field line , by using the newtonian dipole field .",
    "let us introduce the following dimensionless @xmath0-ray densities in the dimensionless energy interval between @xmath45 and @xmath46 : @xmath47 in this paper , we set @xmath48 , which corresponds to the lowest @xmath0-ray energy , @xmath49 mev .",

    "we can now rewrite the continuity quation  ( [ eq : cont - eq ] ) of particles into @xmath62 ,    \\label{eq : basic-3}\\ ] ] where the magnetic field strength , @xmath22 , is evaluated at each @xmath63 .",
    "the dimensionless redistribution functions @xmath64 are evaluated at the central energy in each bin as @xmath65    a combination of equations ( [ eq : basic-3 ] ) gives the current conservation law , @xmath66 if @xmath67 holds , the current density per unit magnetic flux tube equals the goldreich - julian value , @xmath68 .",
    "the boltzmann equations  ( [ eq : boltz_gam ] ) for the @xmath0-rays are integrated over @xmath69 between dimensionless energies @xmath70 and @xmath71 to become @xmath72 where @xmath73 ( @xmath74 ) and @xmath75 is dimensionless ; @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 refer to the modified bessel function of @xmath79 order , curvature radius of the magnetic field lines , and the particle lorentz factor , respectively .    to ensure that the lorentz factors do not exceed the maximum attainable limit , @xmath80 , we compute @xmath78 with ( paper  vii ) @xmath81 where @xmath82 represents the terminal lorentz factor that is realized if the electric force , @xmath83 , balances with the radiation reaction force .",
    "we now consider the boundary conditions to solve the vlasov equations ( [ eq : basic-1 ] ) , ( [ eq : basic-2 ] ) , ( [ eq : basic-3 ] ) , and ( [ eq : basic-5 ] ) . at the _ inner _",

    "thus two extra boundary conditions must be compensated by making the positions of the boundaries @xmath107 and @xmath108 be free .",
    "the two free boundaries appear because @xmath109 is imposed at _ both _ the boundaries and because @xmath97 is externally imposed ( see   [ sec : free_param ] for details ) .",
    "in other words , the gap boundaries ( @xmath107 and @xmath108 ) shift , if @xmath90 and/or @xmath98 varies .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the gap width , @xmath13 , is related with the x - ray field density as follows ( for details , see papers  v , vii , and viii ) : @xmath110 where @xmath111 refers to the pair production optical depth , and @xmath112 the expectation value of the @xmath0-ray photons emitted by a single particle while it runs the gap .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : closure ] ) is automatically satisfied by the stationary vlasov equations . from equation  ( [ eq : closure ] )",

    "we examine such features more accurately in the next section , by analyzing the vlasov equations numerically .",

    "( 1996 ) reported that the x - ray spectrum consists of two components : a soft blackbody with @xmath113  ev and @xmath114 and a hard blackbody with @xmath115  ev and @xmath116 , where @xmath117 refers to the distance in kpc . here ,",
    "@xmath118 and @xmath119 indicate the observed emission erea of soft and hard blackbody components , respectively ; @xmath120 expresses the area of the whole neutron star surface .",
    "mignani , caraveo , and bignami ( 1997 ) claimed that the blue / uv flux is consistent with an extrapolation of the soft , thermal part of the rosat x - ray spectrum .",
    "we thus compute the infrared flux from the rayleigh - jeans side of the soft x - ray spectrum with @xmath113  ev and @xmath114 .",
    "this ir photon field is , in fact , so weak that the ic drag acting on a particle is negligibly small compared with the curvature drag .",
    "therefore , the vlasov equations can be solved without the ir field ( i.e. , the pair - production rate can be computed only from the gev - kev collisions ) .",
    "let us now substitute the x - ray field into equation  ( [ eq : def_etap_0 ] ) and solve the vlasov equations by the method described in ",

    "since the @xmath0-ray energies are predicted to increase with increasing @xmath173 in paper  v , we examine in this section whether the egret pulsed flux around 6  gev can be explained if consider a larger @xmath173 . in figures  [ fig : ell_1055_4inc ] and [ fig : spc_1055_4inc ] , we present the acceleration fields and the expected spectra for @xmath174 , @xmath175 , @xmath176 , and @xmath177 as the dash - dotted , dashed , solid , and dotted lines . the current densities are chosen as @xmath144 , @xmath126 . in each case , the outward @xmath0-ray flux is depicted , because it dominates the inward ones .",
    "= 8.5 cm    = 8.5 cm    it follows from figure  [ fig : spc_1055_4inc ] that a large inclination angle ( @xmath175 or greater ) is preferable to explain the @xmath0-ray spectrum around 6  gev .",
    "the reasons are fourfold ( see also   6.2 in paper",
    "vii ) : + @xmath178   the distance of the null surface from the star decreases with increasing @xmath173 .",
    "+ @xmath178   the magnetic field strength , and hence the goldreich - julian charge density , @xmath179 , in the gap increases as the distance from the star decreases .",
    "+ @xmath178   it follows from the poisson equation that the derivative of @xmath132 ( i.e. , @xmath180 ) increases with increasing @xmath136 ( i.e. , with decreasing distance from the star ) .",
    "+ @xmath178   by virtue of this increasing derivative , the acceleration field , @xmath132 , at the gap center increases .",
    "we may notice here that @xmath13 does not decrease very rapidly with increasing @xmath173 , because of the negative feedback effect due to the @xmath112 factor in equation  ( [ eq : closure ] ) .",
    "as a result of this increased @xmath132 , the spectrum becomes hard for a large @xmath173 .",
    "it is worth noting that the tev flux is always negligibly small compared with the observational upper limit .",
    "this is because the infrared flux , which is deduced from the rayleigh - jeans side of the soft surface blackbody spectrum , declines sharply as @xmath181 at small frequency , @xmath182 .",
    "we have assumed that the distance is @xmath183  kpc so that the observed area of the soft blackbody emission , @xmath184 , may be less than @xmath120 . in this section",
    ", we consider the case when the distance is @xmath185  kpc , as indicated by taylor , manchester and lyne ( 1993 ) , and compare the results with @xmath186  kpc case .    in figure",
    "[ fig : s1055dist ] , we present the resultant spectra for @xmath174 , @xmath144 , and @xmath126 .",
    "the solid ( or dashed ) line represents the @xmath0-ray spectrum when the distance is @xmath183  kpc ( or @xmath185  kpc ) .",
    "the normalization is adjusted by the fluxes below @xmath183  gev ; namely , the cross sectional area is @xmath187 ( or @xmath188 ) is assumed for @xmath186  kpc ( or @xmath185  kpc ) .",
    "it is clear from figure  [ fig : s1055dist ] that the gev spectrum becomes hard if we assume a smaller distance , @xmath117 .",
    "the conclusion that a small distance to this pulsar is preferable , is derived , because the less dense x - ray field for a smaller @xmath117 results in a larger @xmath111 in equation  ( [ eq : closure ] ) , and hence in a larger @xmath13 and the acceleration field , @xmath132 .",
    "however , the solution does not vary so much even though the x - ray density increases @xmath189  times .",
    "this is due to the negative feedback effect caused by the @xmath142 factor in equation  ( [ eq : closure ] ) ; that is , the increase of @xmath13 is substantially canceled by the increase of @xmath112 , which is proportional to the product of the curvature - radiation rate of a particle per unit length and @xmath13 . in other words",
    ", the solution exists for a wide range of parameters and does not change very much if the variation of the x - ray field density is within one order of magnitude .",
    "in summary , we have developed a one - dimensional model for an outer - gap accelerator in the magnetosphere of a rotation - powered pulsar . solving the vlasov equations that describe a stationary pair - production cascade",
    ", we revealed that the accelerator shifts towards the star surface ( or the light cylinder ) as the particle injection rate across the outer ( or inner ) boundary approaches the goldreich - julian value . applying this theory to a middle - aged pulsar , b1055 - 52",
    ", we find that stationary solutions exist for a wide range of parameters such as the injected currents , magnetic inclination , and the distance to the pulsar .",
    "comparing the expected spectrum with erget observations , we conclude that a sub goldreich - julian current density , a large magnetic inclination , and a small distance ( 500  pc , say ) are preferable for this pulsar .      in this subsection ,",
    "let us discuss the physical reason why @xmath97 should be treated as a free parameter , rather than a quantity that is solved from the vlasov equations .",
    "we first consider the vacuum limit in which the true charge density @xmath190 in the poisson equation  ( [ eq : basic-2 ] ) is negligible compared with the goldreich - julian charge density , @xmath191 . in this limit",
    ", it follows from equations  ( [ eq : basic-3 ] ) and ( [ eq : basic-5 ] ) that if @xmath103 and @xmath104 form a solution of the vlasov equations then @xmath192 and @xmath193 do , as long as the arbitrary factor @xmath194 satisfies @xmath195 \\ll b_z / b$ ] .",
    "it is @xmath97 that parameterizes the arbitrary factor , @xmath194 .",
    "next , we consider a non - vacuum gap in which the screening effect due to @xmath190 becomes important in the poisson equation . in this case , the solution deviates from the vacuum one as a continuous function of @xmath97 ( see figs .  9 , 10 in paper  i , where @xmath196 in that paper corresponds to @xmath97 in the present paper ) .",
    "the same can be said when the inverse compton scatterings dominate ( figs .  8 , 9 , 10 in paper  ii",
    "; see also eq .  [ 50 ] , which describes how the voltage drop depends on @xmath196 , i.e. , @xmath97 ) .",
    "the nature of @xmath97 as a free parameter is unchanged if particles are injected from the boundaries .",
    "for example , equation  ( [ eq : closure ] ) shows that the pair production physics determines the gap width as a function of @xmath141 , even if @xmath90 and @xmath98 are fixed .",
    "in the present paper , we are primarily interested in the outer - magnetospheric accelerator .",
    "therefore , to emphasize that a gap itself has a freedom , we regard @xmath97 as a free parameter , in addition to @xmath90 and @xmath98 , and calculate @xmath169 from @xmath197 .",
    "however , we may alternatively consider that the total current @xmath169 is determined globally ( e.g. , in the wind region ) .",
    "in this case , we may have to regard @xmath169 , @xmath90 , and @xmath98 as free parameters in an outer gap and calculate @xmath97 from @xmath198 . in another word ,",
    "@xmath97 may be constrained by a global condition , if we consider the polar - cap , outer - magnetospheric , and wind regions as a whole .",
    "we next discuss why there is an upper limit for the current flowing in the gap .",
    "it follows from the poisson equation  ( [ eq : basic-2 ] ) that @xmath199 changes its sign where a space charge is overfilled in the sense that @xmath200 exceeds @xmath201 , or equivalently , in the sense that @xmath202 exceeds @xmath203 in equation  ( 30 ) in paper  vii , where @xmath204 designates the position in the gap ( see   2 of paper  vii for details ) .",
    "if the overfilling occurs at a certain position , @xmath199 changes its sign there and will diverges outside of the gap ( fig .  2 in hirotani & okamoto 1998 ) .",
    "under this circumstance , we obtain two accelerators : the original one and an additional one outside of the point where @xmath205 is minimum .",
    "( usually , such an overfilling occurs close to one of the two boundaries , where @xmath200 maximized . ) since @xmath205 diverges in the latter accelerator , a large flux of @xmath0-rays are expected to illuminate the original gap .",
    "the resultant , excessive @xmath0-ray flux leads to an additional pair production in the gap , which screens the original @xmath205 .",
    "this screening may continue until @xmath205 closes at the boundaries and hence until the additional accelerator vanishes .",
    "we conjecture that such a solution having diverging @xmath205 ( and hence belonging to a higher energy state ) is dynamically unstable .",
    "we thus consider that there is an upper limit for @xmath97 above which stationary solutions cease to exist due to the overfilling of space charges .",
    "we next consider the expected pulse - phase relationship between the incoherent gev emission from the outer gap and the coherent radio emission from the polar cap ( e.g. , michel 1991 ; zhang & harding 2000 ) . if the neutron star is nearly orthogonally rotating ( @xmath206 ) , as indicated in ",
    "[ sec : incl_b1055 ] ( or fig .",
    "[ fig : ell_1055_4inc ] ) , and if the outer gap is located near to the null surface , as indicated in the last paragraph n   [ sec : res_b1055 ] , both the polar - cap and outer - gap emissions are beamed nearly in the same direction ( fig .",
    "[ fig : impl_sideview ] ) .",
    "it is noteworthy that the intersection of the null surface and the last - open field line is located only at @xmath207 ( or equivalently , @xmath208s in light crossing time ) from the star for @xmath174 .",
    "it is therefore possible that the formation of an outer gap near the null surface for a large inclination angle explains the observational fact that the gev peak in the light curve occurs at the close phase with one of its two radio pulses ( thompson et al .  1999 , and references therein ) .",
    "in this subsection , we present the @xmath0-ray spectrum as a function of the position in the gap . as the best - fit case",
    ", we choose @xmath174 , @xmath126 , and @xmath144 . to integrate the @xmath0-ray flux in certain regions in the gap",
    ", we divide the gap into the following four regions : + * region  1 * @xmath209 , + * region  2 * @xmath210 , + * region  3 * @xmath211 , + * region  4 * @xmath212 .",
    "+ in figure  [ fig : spc_1055_80_position ] , we present the outward @xmath0-ray flux emitted from each region : the solid , dashed , dash - dotted , and dotted lines correspond to the fluxes from regions  4 , 3 , 2 , and 1 , respectively .",
    "it follows from the figure that the outward @xmath0-ray fluxes from regions  2 , 3 , and 4 do not differ very much .",
    "however , from region  1 , the flux is much smaller than those from other regions .",
    "the figure also indicates that the spectrum becomes hardest from region  3 , because the electric field is strong there .",
    "the @xmath0-rays emitted from region  1 becomes soft , mainly because the curvature radius is large at the inner region .",
    "as demonstrated in ",
    "6.3 in paper  vii , the spin - down luminosity of a rotation - powered pulsar becomes ( see   6.3 in paper vii ) @xmath213 where @xmath214 is the neutron star s magnetic dipole moment ; @xmath215 represents the ratio of magnetic fluxes along which currents are flowing and those that are open . for psr  b1055 - 52 , @xmath216 .",
    "if all the open field lines are active ( i.e. , @xmath217 ) , @xmath218 is required so that the observed spin - down luminosity @xmath219 may be realized . if a small fraction of open field lines are active ( i.e. , @xmath220 ) , a super - goldreich - julian current ( i.e. , @xmath221 ) is required",
    ".    however , our outer - gap model requires ( and , in fact , previous outer - gap models assume ) @xmath222 .",
    "thus the deficient current must flow along the open field lines that are not threading the accelerator .",
    "let us finally compare the present work with the numerical simulation performed by smith et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , who examined equilibrium charge distributions in the magnetosphere of an aligned rotator . in the first place",
    ", they demonstrated that the goldreich - julian charge distribution is unstable and collapses to form a polar dome containing plasma of one charge and an equatorial belt containing plasma of the other sign : @xmath223 inside both of them .",
    "these are separated by a vacuum gap in which @xmath224 holds .",
    "to apply the theory developed in the present paper to the case when the goldreich - julian charge distribution breaks down , we must modify the poisson equation ( eqs .",
    "[ [ eq : basic-1 ] ] and [ eq : basic-2 ] ) so that the electric field caused by the charges in the dome and the belt may be taken into account .    in the second place ,",
    "smith et al .",
    "( 2001 ) demonstrated that the creation of electron - positron pairs in the gap between the dome and the belt reduces the value of @xmath225 in the gap so that it turns off at last .",
    "this is because the charges are attracted to regions of the same sign , following the closed field lines , and increasingly filling the magnetosphere . instead ,",
    "as considered in the present paper , if pairs are created in the open field line region , we may expect global flows of charged particles and hence a stationary pair production cascade in the magnetosphere of a spinning neutron star .",
    "if we extend the work by smith et al ( 2001 ) into oblique rotators and apply the present method to the gap , we may construct a stationary magnetospheric model with pair production cascade under the existence of global currents .",
    "there is room for further investigation on this issue .",
