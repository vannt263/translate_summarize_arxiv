    "the origin of magnetic fields starting from unmagnetized plasmas is a central question in astrophysics .",
    "although much of the observable universe is magnetized such that the magnetic field plays an important role in the dynamics , in the early universe this was not so . during the period before recombination , when the cosmic microwave background was generated , it is widely accepted that there was no magnetic field  @xcite .",
    "magnetic field growth is generally attributed to the turbulent dynamo  @xcite , which greatly amplifies a required initial seed field . the biermann battery mechanism @xcite , in contrast , generates magnetic fields in the absence of a seed via perpendicular density and temperature gradients , and is thought to be the major source of these seed fields .",
    "the biermann mechanism can explain the generation of a @xmath11 field after recombination , but it is questionable whether turbulent dynamo growth alone can explain amplification up to the @xmath12 fields seen today throughout the interstellar medium  @xcite , ( where the magnetic pressure is of the order of the plasma pressure , @xmath13 ) . a possible solution to this problem may be provided by the potential role played by kinetic instabilities in the amplification of magnetic fields .",
    "one such instability is the weibel instability  @xcite , which we will discuss later .",
    "the biermann mechanism is also the presumed cause of self - generated magnetic fields ( of order @xmath14 , @xmath1 ) found in laser - solid interaction experiments  @xcite .",
    "the laser generates an expanding bubble of plasma by hitting and ionizing a solid foil of metal or plastic .",
    "this bubble thus has a temperature gradient perpendicular to the beam ( hottest closest to the beam axis ) , and a density gradient in the direction normal to the foil , allowing for the biermann battery to take place .",
    "these experiments , in addition to being interesting in themselves and in inertial confinement fusion , provide an opportunity to help clarify poorly understood astrophysical processes , namely magnetic field generation and amplification , and even turbulence at both fluid and kinetic scales .",
    "temperature gradients form perpendicular to astrophysical shocks ( hotter in the center of the shock ) , while density gradients form parallel to the shock , once again allowing the biermann battery to take place .    inspired by the laser - plasma configuration , we investigated , in a previous paper  @xcite , the generation and amplification of magnetic fields using particle - in - cell ( pic ) simulations of an expanding plasma bubble with perpendicular temperature and density gradients .",
    "these kinetic simulations confirmed the fluid prediction of the biermann battery  @xcite with the generation and saturation of magnetic fields scaling as @xmath15 for moderate values of @xmath16 , where @xmath2 is the ion inertial length , and @xmath0 is the system size .",
    "in addition , we found that , for large @xmath0 these simulations revealed the weibel instability , which is kinetic in nature , as the major source of magnetic fields , allowing the magnetic field to remain finite ( @xmath1 ) for large @xmath0 .",
    "we will hereupon refer to ref .",
    "@xcite as paper i.    in the present paper a more in - depth study of this problem is performed . in the following sections we",
    "further detail and expand the results of paper i  @xcite , showing the scaling of biermann generated magnetic fields with system size , and the formation of the weibel instability for large system sizes ( @xmath3 ) . in the next two sections we show the theory behind the two mechanisms for magnetic field growth ; the biermann battery mechanism ( section ii ) and the weibel instability ( section iii ) .",
    "section iv describes the computational setup . in section",
    "v we provide evidence that the results from paper i  @xcite hold for larger , more realistic , mass ratios . in section",
    "vi we show further agreement between observations of the instability in the large @xmath17 regime and theoretical predictions of the weibel instability . in section",
    "vii we present agreement with gyrokinetic theory via power law slopes of both the magnetic and electric field energy .",
    "finally , in section viii we reiterate the importance of the @xmath15 scaling of biermann magnetic fields , and the existence of the finite weibel magnetic fields ( @xmath18 ) generated in large scale temperature and density gradients , relevant for both astrophysical systems and some current and future laser setups .",
    "assuming a two - fluid description of a plasma with massless electrons , the magnetic field evolution is given by the generalized induction equation , @xmath19 which shows the evolution of magnetic field @xmath20 , based on the fluid velocity @xmath21 , the current density @xmath22 , the number density @xmath23 , and the electron temperature @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the electron plasma pressure . here , @xmath26 is the speed of light , @xmath27 is the resistivity , and @xmath28 is the charge of an electron .",
    "the terms on the rhs of eq .",
    "( [ induction ] ) from left to right are the convective term , the resistive term , the hall term , and the biermann battery term .",
    "the induction equation is often simplified by assuming the system size @xmath0 is large compared to all kinetic scales , and only considering the convective term on the rhs .",
    "the resistive term compared to the convective term scales as @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the resistive scale , the hall term as @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the alfvn velocity , and the biermann battery term as @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the electron larmor radius , and @xmath35 is the electron thermal velocity . in ideal magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) ,",
    "all of these terms are neglected because @xmath36 , @xmath2 , and @xmath34 are assumed small compared to @xmath0 .",
    "the biermann battery term operates when the density and the temperature gradients are not parallel to each other ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "although in mhd it is a small term , it is the only term independent of @xmath20 and thus dominates for small magnetic fields ( where @xmath38 ) .    starting with @xmath39 , all terms on the rhs except for the biermann term",
    "can be ignored , and thus @xmath20 grows linearly .",
    "based on scaling , given @xmath40 , we find : @xmath41 where @xmath0 is more precisely defined by the length of the gradients ( @xmath42 , which we will take to be comparable ) .",
    "assuming the other rhs terms remain small , the linear growth should continue until the biermann term disappears : within an electron transit time @xmath43 , hot electrons flow down the temperature gradient , while cold electrons flow up , smoothing out the gradient , and effectively removing the biermann term .",
    "( note , the density gradient , on the other hand smooths out at the much slower sound transit time @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the sound speed . )",
    "because the gradient changes with time , the magnetic field growth eventually ceases to be linear and one must include terms proportional to @xmath46 . however , we know that by @xmath47 , without the biermann term , the magnetic field should saturate .",
    "we can thus estimate the final magnetic field as eq .",
    "( [ bevolution ] ) at @xmath47 , and arrive at the condition @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the electron larmor radius , and @xmath50 is the electron cyclotron frequency .",
    "this can be rewritten in terms of the electron plasma beta , leading to the following scaling of the final magnetic field : @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the electron inertial length , and @xmath53 is the electron plasma frequency . for large @xmath54 , which is typical of astrophysical systems and some experiments ,",
    "this means @xmath55 is small ( @xmath56 large ) , in other words the magnetic field generated can be considered insignificant .    the validity of eq .",
    "( [ bescaling ] ) rests on the assumption that the biermann term remains the dominant term in eq .",
    "( [ induction ] ) as the magnetic field grows .",
    "let us check that this is indeed true .",
    "the fluid velocity @xmath21 should quickly reach the sound speed @xmath57 . assuming this flow , at @xmath58 , the convection term scales as a factor of @xmath59 smaller than the biermann term and",
    "thus should remain negligible .",
    "( for simplicity , we have now assumed all gradients are of the same order @xmath60 . ) for small scales ( @xmath61 ) the hall term becomes stronger than the convection term . because @xmath62 , at @xmath63 the hall term scales as a factor of @xmath64 smaller than the biermann term , and thus also should remain small as long as @xmath65 .",
    "a different situation arises if the density and temperature gradients are fixed , as may occur in a system with a long pulsed laser , i.e. one that continually supplies the biermann term , or in astrophysical shocks which can also keep the gradients steady . in such cases ,",
    "the convection term will eventually become significant .",
    "if we assume that there are no dynamo effects which cause the magnetic field to continue growing such that the convection term surpasses the biermann term , these two terms may eventually balance as magnetic fields convect away from the biermann source faster than the field can grow . this balance results in the following scaling for the saturated magnetic field strength : @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the ion inertial length , and @xmath68 is the ion plasma frequency , or equivalently @xmath69 , where @xmath70 . as in eq .",
    "( [ bescaling ] ) , the final magnetic field scales as @xmath15 .    this @xmath71 scaling was predicted in previous works @xcite , including haines @xcite , who also predicted that the saturated field would peak at @xmath72 and vanish for small @xmath73 .",
    "for these small , sub-@xmath2 , scales the current is limited by microinstabilities such as the lower hybrid drift instability and the ion acoustic instability , which lead to a reduced magnetic field strength .",
    "this was confirmed for the first time in paper i  @xcite .     a still frame ( at @xmath74 , when the magnetic fields saturate ) from a movie ( multimedia view ) , showing the evolution of three contours of density , and a selection of magnetic field lines generated by the biermann mechanism ( from @xmath75 to @xmath76 ) .",

    "[ 3dbiermann ] a still frame from a movie ( multimedia view ) is shown , which illustrates this generation of magnetic fields via the biermann battery , with perpendicular temperature and density gradients in a 3d pic simulation .",

    "( this is from the 3d simulation presented in paper i  @xcite ; here , @xmath78 and @xmath79 . )",
    "the movie shows the plasma expanding ( at the sound speed ) outward as magnetic fields are generated via the biermann battery mechanism .",
    "as we showed in paper i  @xcite , the configuration that gives rise to the biermann battery also triggers the weibel instability  @xcite for @xmath3 .",
    "note , only the temperature gradient is essential for this effect .",
    "this instability is caused by pressure anisotropies , and thus is an intrinsically kinetic effect .",
    "the anisotropy in this paper is due to the kinetic evolution of a temperature gradient in a collisionless system , the details of which will explained in a forthcoming publication . unlike the biermann battery ,",
    "the weibel instability must start from a seed magnetic field .",
    "this seed field may be generated by the biermann battery , or from small scale fluctuations found in both pic simulations and in nature , due to finite numbers of particles ( referred to as shot noise in electronics  @xcite ) .    to get a quantitative understanding of what is expected from such an instability ,",
    "let us consider an initial plasma with a bi - maxwellian velocity distribution : @xmath80 where the thermal velocity is larger in one direction deemed as parallel @xmath81 , with @xmath82 .",
    "the @xmath83 index represents each of the particle species .",
    "the dispersion relation of an unmagnetized collisionless plasma with this distribution can be obtained from the vlasov equation .",
    "the solution for electromagnetic perturbations consists of the following expression  @xcite : @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the wavenumber , @xmath86 is the plasma frequency , @xmath87 is the temperature anisotropy , @xmath88 , and @xmath89 is the plasma dispersion function  @xcite . for the purposes of this paper we assume that the ions do not play a role because of their large masses and low temperature and",
    "thus we will drop the @xmath83 index ; however , in systems with larger ion temperatures , they may play an important role on longer timescales , especially if the electron anisotropy is not present due to collisions . in this study ,",
    "the instability is based on electron physics : the anisotropy is in the electron pressure , and the instability forms at the electron inertial scale @xmath4 .",
    "there exists a purely imaginary solution where @xmath90 as long as the normalized perturbation wavenumber @xmath91 .",
    "this unstable growing mode is referred to as the weibel instability , and is driven by the anisotropy @xmath92 .",
    "although we have described this instability in the context of a bi - maxwellian distribution , similar physics is present for a wide range of velocity distributions with a larger velocity spread in the parallel direction . for example , delta functions @xcite , waterbag distributions @xcite , and kappa distributions @xcite all yield similar solutions .",
    "we will later use the bi - maxwellian solution to quantitatively check the growth rates and wavelengths found in our simulation .",
    "using the osiris framework @xcite , we perform a set of particle - in - cell ( pic ) simulations to investigate the generation and amplification of magnetic fields via the biermann battery .",
    "we use the same initialization for our simulations as in paper i  @xcite , a simplification of the aforementioned laser - plasma systems .",
    "the fluid velocity , electric field , and magnetic field are initially uniformly zero .",
    "we start with a spheroid distribution of density , that has a shorter length scale in one direction : @xmath93 @xmath94 is the reference density , and @xmath95 is a uniform background density . as in section ii , the characteristic lengths of the temperature and density gradients are denoted by @xmath96 and @xmath97 , respectively . to represent the newly formed plasma bubble , which is flatter in the direction of the laser , @xmath98 , we set @xmath99",

    "the prediction is based on energy transferred via a turbulent cascade of kinetic alfvn waves , which is converted at @xmath189 via electron landau damping into an entropy cascade .",
    "for the 3d run that was reported in paper i  @xcite , where @xmath77 , the dominant magnetic field is generated by the biermann battery . this magnetic field ( shown in  fig .",
    "[ 3dbiermann ] ) acts as a guide field on which kinetic alfvn waves may propagate , damp , and generate the predicted cascade .    in  fig .",
    "[ kspect ] , we show the magnetic and electric energy spectra for this run . the spectra are obtained by performing a fourier transform over the entire system for one component of the electric or magnetic fields , and then averaging over all directions of @xmath190 .",
    "in addition to the @xmath9 power - law slope of the magnetic energy already revealed in paper i  @xcite , we observe that the electric energy spectrum is in good agreement with a @xmath10 power - law , as predicted  @xcite . at the time",
    "shown , the spectra has reached a steady state and remains unchanged for the rest of the simulation , up to @xmath191 .",
    "we have performed kinetic simulations of plasmas with perpendicular temperature and density gradients of ranging mass ratio up to @xmath7 , and confirmed the magnetic field generation and amplification shown in paper i  @xcite .",
    "we have shown that as the system size increases beyond @xmath192 , the major source of magnetic field changes from the biermann battery mechanism to kinetic weibel generated fields , which remain finite ( @xmath18 ) for large system sizes .",
    "we have done further analysis on the simulations done in paper i  @xcite , and on the new simulations with @xmath193 confirming that in large system sizes , magnetic fields are generated by the weibel instability .",
    "finally we have shown that our results agree with gyrokinetic models in power laws found in both electric and magnetic energy spectra .",
    "we reiterate the main applications of our conclusions shown in paper i  @xcite , which are significant to the topic of the generation of magnetic fields in astrophysical contexts including shocks found in supernova remnants .",
    "although small scale , the weibel instability generates magnetic fields at significant levels ( @xmath18 independent of @xmath96 ) .",
    "these are astrophysically relevant magnitudes in typical contexts ( where @xmath194 ) , unlike the fields predicted by the biermann battery that yield @xmath195 .",
    "however the discrepancy between the large scales of astrophysical magnetic fields and the microscopic weibel fields remains .",
    "whether it is possible for a mechanism such as turbulence to bridge this gap remains an outstanding mystery of astrophysical research .",
    "the matching of power law spectra points to the exciting possibility of validating theories of kinetic turbulence in laser experiments . due to the small scale separation between @xmath96 , @xmath196 , and @xmath34 in our 3d simulation",
    ", we are only able to measure a sub-@xmath34 power law",
    ". however , the spectra at other scales could potentially be tested in simulations and experiments .",
    "in addition to the configuration that we have studied , weibel - generated turbulence may occur due to anisotropies induced by other mechanisms ; for example , laser - generated hot electron beams with return currents .",
    "it might be possible to probe such magnetized laser plasmas in order to investigate turbulence at kinetic scales .",
    "indeed , one such an experiment has recently been performed at the tata institute of fundamental research , mumbai  @xcite , probing the magnetic energy spectra in the range with @xmath197 .",
    "a power law of @xmath198 has been measured from the experimental results ( to be published shortly ) , consistent with theoretical predictions  @xcite .    in existing ( and future ) laser - plasma experiments the predicted @xmath15 scalings in eq .",
    "( [ bescaling ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ bscaling ] ) of the saturated biermann magnetic fields should be relevant .",
    "furthermore , it may be possible to find the electron - weibel instability as we have done here , as long as collisions do not occur faster than the electron transit time and keep the temperature isotropic ( @xmath199 ) .",
    "based on experimentally relevant parameters , this condition is equivalent to the following engineering formula : @xmath200 where @xmath23 is the number density , @xmath201 is the coulomb logarithm , @xmath96 is the gradient scale , and @xmath202 is the electron temperature .",
    "this inequality suggests the possibility of observing the weibel instability , since the physical values quoted above are reasonable numbers which can occur at the low density , high temperature coronae generated around laser targets , e.g.  @xcite .",
    "note that in this work the strong temperature gradient is assumed to form before the anisotropy and the subsequent instability .",
    "we think this is a good modeling assumption in cases where intense short - pulse lasers are used .",
    "cases with longer , less intense lasers require more careful consideration due to the possible influence of collisions and the laser fields during the timescale of the experiment .",
