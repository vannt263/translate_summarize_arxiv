    "soon after the first successful synthesis of rusr@xmath0gdcu@xmath0o@xmath1 @xcite the material was found to display not only superconductivity ( @xmath545k ) but coexisting magnetic order with @xmath6135k@xcite .",
    "evidence accumulated from static magnetization , muon spin rotation ( @xmath7sr)@xcite and from gd - esr@xcite studies showing that the magnetism is a spatially uniform bulk property .",
    "specific heat measurements@xcite and the diamagnetic shielding fraction at low temperatures@xcite indicate that the superconductivity is also a bulk property , and that the two phases therefore coexist on a truly microscopic scale .",
    "an initial neutron diffraction study eliminated the possibility of ferromagnetic order with the ru moments lying in the ruo@xmath0 plane , but did not rule out ferromagnetic alignment with the moments parallel to the @xmath8-axis , canted ferromagnetism or itinerant ferromagnetism@xcite .",
    "subsequent polarized neutron diffraction data@xcite have thrown the debate on rusr@xmath0gdcu@xmath0o@xmath1 wide open by appearing to show that the underlying ordering of the ru moments below the magnetic transition is in fact g - type antiferromagnetic ( antiparallel nearest - neighbour ordering in all three crystallographic directions ) . finally , the most recent neutron measurements on rusr@xmath0ycu@xmath0o@xmath1 confirmed that there is indeed a ferromagnetic component of about 0.28 @xmath9 which is about 1/5@xmath10 of the af component of 1.2 @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the magnetic order shows a rather strong and unusual response to an applied magnetic field , with the fm component growing rapidly in strength and dominating over the af already at 2 t .",
    "whatever the nature of its magnetism , the discovery of this material is an exciting development which poses new and important questions to our understanding of the interplay between magnetic and sc order .",
    "magnetoresistance ( mr ) , hall effect and thermopower ( tep ) measurements on undoped sintered ceramic rusr@xmath0gdcu@xmath0o@xmath1 were presented previously@xcite . above @xmath2",
    "the mr is negative and proportional to the square of the ru magnetization and was ascribed to spin - scattering of the current carriers . a model for dilute magnetic alloys",
    "was used to extract from these data a value ( @xmath1125 mev ) for the exchange interaction between the ru moments and the carriers .",
    "below @xmath2 the hall effect and tep both fall anomalously .",
    "it will be shown that these data may be explained within a simple two - band model by a transition from localized to more itinerant behavior in the ruo@xmath0 layer at @xmath2 .",
    "evidence for delocalized carriers within the ruo layers has also been obtained from other transport and microwave absorption studies@xcite as well as from ru - nmr measurements where clear anomalies in the ru - nmr relaxation rate occur near t@xmath12 @xcite .",
    "this observation suggests that the ru nuclear moments experience a sizeable hyperfine coupling to the charge carriers that enter the sc state .",
    "the magneto - thermopower reveals an extremely unusual variation of @xmath4 with applied field@xcite : @xmath4 actually _ increases _ by @xmath13 as the applied field is increased to 2 t .",
    "the increase saturates along with the ru magnetization , suggesting that the onset of ru magnetic order reduces a magnetic pair - breaking effect in the cuo@xmath0 layer .",
    "the carrier concentration in rusr@xmath0gdcu@xmath0o@xmath1 and its magnetic and sc properties , structural deformations , and so forth may be altered by cation substitution .",
    "examining the transport properties of such samples should lead to a better understanding of the parent material . in this paper",
    "we present magneto - transport measurements on substituted rusr@xmath0gdcu@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "it will be shown that the data strongly support a simple two - band model in which the hall effect and tep of each sample are determined by the properties of the cuo@xmath0 and ruo@xmath0 layers , weighted appropriately by their conductivities .",
    "the model indicates that the ruo@xmath0 layer in the undoped material is very poorly conducting at room temperature , with @xmath14 , increasing to @xmath15 or higher at low temperature .",
    "while in most of the samples studied the cuo@xmath0 layer remains the better conductor at all temperatures , we find that the ruo@xmath0 layer dominates the conductivity below @xmath2 in a sample with 10% ce@xmath16 substituted for gd@xmath17 .",
    "phase - pure sintered pellets of rusr@xmath0gdcu@xmath0o@xmath1 were synthesized as described previously via solid - state reaction of a stoichiometric mixture of high - purity metal oxides and srco@xmath18@xcite .",
    "the doped samples , listed in table i , were produced similarly ; the compositions given are nominal . a final extended anneal at 1060@xmath19c in flowing high - purity o@xmath0 produces a marked improvement in the crystallinity of the undoped material , resulting in a higher resistive @xmath4 ( as defined by @xmath20 ) but no significant change in the thermodynamic t@xmath12@xcite .",

    "[ cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     bars of approximate dimensions 4@xmath211@xmath210.7mm@xmath22 were cut from the sintered pellets using a diamond wheel , then polished down to a thickness of @xmath23 m in order to increase the measured hall voltage .",
    "they were mounted on quartz substrates in a standard six - contact configuration allowing both resistance and hall voltage to be measured simultaneously .",
    "the contacts were made using 25@xmath7 m gold wire and _ dupont 6838 _ conducting epoxy , cured in air at 450@xmath19c for six minutes , giving contact resistances @xmath24 .",
    "resistivity and hall effect measurements were made using an ac current source , low - noise transformers and lock - in amplifiers .",
    "a frequency of @xmath25hz was used to avoid mains pick - up , with current densities of around 0.25a@xmath26 .",
    "the hall coefficient , @xmath27 , was usually measured by stabilizing the temperature and field ( 10 t unless stated otherwise ) , then measuring the hall voltage with the sample rotated by 0@xmath19  and 180@xmath19with respect to the field .",
    "the hall coefficient is then given by @xmath28 where _ b _ is the magnetic field , _ t _ the sample thickness and _ i _ the current .",
    "this method eliminates the mr of the sample , and the offset voltage from @xmath29 due to contact misalignment . where @xmath27 was measured as a function of field , this was swept to both positive and negative values and @xmath30 determined from @xmath31 .",
    "tep measurements were made by the ` toggled ' heating method@xcite .",
    "two 25@xmath7 m chromel - alumel thermocouples , attached to the sample with small blobs of silver paint , measure both the thermal emf and temperature gradient , ensuring that these are measured between the same two points .",
    "the sample is first stabilized at the measurement temperature , a small thermal gradient is applied , and the resulting thermal emf measured .",
    "the thermal gradient is then reversed , allowing slowly changing thermal emfs in the cryostat wires to be nulled out .",
    "a ` rest state ' was added whereby both ends of the sample were heated at half - power , providing two extra measurement points . adding this state keeps the total power dissipation into the stage constant , avoiding fluctuation of its temperature when the heater currents are changed .",
    "hall effect , thermopower and resistivity data for undoped rusr@xmath0gdcu@xmath0o@xmath1 are shown in fig . [",
    "fig : figure1 ] .",
    "the room - temperature value of the tep implies a hole concentration , @xmath32 , of 0.06 - 0.07 holes / cu@xcite , while its temperature dependence is typical of other high-@xmath4 materials , with the exception of the unusual linear temperature dependence below @xmath2 .",
    "the overall magnitude and temperature dependence of the hall coefficient is consistent with a doping level , @xmath32 , of @xmath33 holes / cu , as inferred from the room - temperature tep .",
    "@xmath27 displays a high-@xmath4-like temperature dependence well above @xmath2 .",
    "however , below about 170k there is an anomalous downturn in @xmath27 which is not seen in typical high-@xmath4 data .",
    "the so - called ` anomalous ' hall effect observed in magnetic materials has been measured and discounted as the cause of this downturn@xcite .",
    "alternative possibilities are that it is due to charge delocalization in the ruo@xmath0 plane occurring near the magnetic transition , or to charge transfer into the cuo@xmath0 layers .",
    "it will be shown that a two - band model , with a localized to itinerant transition occurring at @xmath2 in the ruo@xmath0 layer , can explain both these and the tep data .",
    "we now introduce a simple two - band model which successfully describes the features of the above data .",
    "the bands in this model are those formed by carriers in the cu and ru orbitals ; the overall tep and hall effect are given by the sum of the cuo@xmath0 and ruo@xmath0 layer values , weighted by the layer conductivities@xcite : @xmath34 @xmath35 with some reasonable estimates of the ruo@xmath0 and cuo@xmath0 layer properties , it is possible to use this model and the measured room - temperature hall effect and tep to put a limit on the conductivity of the ruo@xmath0 layer .",
    "to do this we assume that the hall coefficient of the ruo@xmath0 layer is approximately zero ( the maximum value observed in other two - dimensional ru oxides studied to date is @xmath36m@xmath22c@xmath37)@xcite . with this assumption in eqn .",
    "[ eqn : h_add ] , the conductivity of the ruo@xmath0 layer may be estimated from @xmath38 the ratio of the hall coefficient of the cuo@xmath0 layers @xmath39 to the measured value @xmath27 caused by the presence of the ruo@xmath0 layer , is hard to estimate due to the uncertain doping state in rusr@xmath0gdcu@xmath0o@xmath1 and the spread of values of @xmath39 , for a given doping level , in the literature@xcite .",
    "given these uncertainties , a reasonable range of values of @xmath40 is 1 - 1.4 , giving @xmath41 in the range @xmath42 .",
    "the summary of @xmath39 values in the review by cooper and loram@xcite would favor the low end of this range .    for this range of conductivity in the ruo@xmath0 layer , equation [ eqn : s_add ]",
    "predicts that the measured net tep lies some 0 - 8@xmath7vk@xmath37 below the intrinsic cuo@xmath0 layer value , i.e. that @xmath43 .",
    "it is very unlikely that @xmath44 lies in the upper half of this range : a value of @xmath45vk@xmath37 would imply an extremely small hole concentration for which a @xmath4 as high as 46k would be extraordinary .",
    "having placed a limit on the conductivity one can use a 2d model to determine @xmath46 , the product of the fermi wave - vector with the mean free path for the ruo@xmath0 layers .",
    "this quantity gives an indication as to whether the carriers are localized or itinerant and for a cylindrical fermi surface may be written as    @xmath47    where @xmath8 is the separation of the planes .",
    "data in the literature for the _ ab_-plane resistivity of under - doped yba@xmath0cu@xmath18o@xmath48 ( ybco ) films and single crystals , with @xmath49 , give a consistent value of 1.2m@xmath50 cm at room temperature @xcite giving @xmath51 , near the limit of localization .",
    "in fact , in only slightly more under - doped samples one sees a semiconducting upturn at low temperatures .",
    "given the range of ratios of @xmath41 to @xmath52 derived from the hall effect , @xmath53 at room temperature .",
    "the tep data suggest that the true value is at the low end of this range , indicating that the carriers in the ruo@xmath0 layers are at best very poorly metallic .",
    "having established that the room - temperature conductivity of the ruo@xmath0 layer is close to zero , typical @xmath55 and @xmath56 data for high-@xmath4 superconductors may be scaled so that the room temperature values match those of rusr@xmath0gdcu@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "the differences below @xmath2 may then be used to follow @xmath54 as a function of temperature .",
    "typical hall effect data for the cuo@xmath0 layer have been taken from measurements on sintered ca - doped yba@xmath0cu@xmath18o@xmath48 , while @xmath57 will be set to zero , its value in other ruo@xmath0 layer compounds being much lower than @xmath39@xcite .",
    "typical @xmath58 data are approximated by measurements on sintered yba@xmath0cu@xmath18o@xmath48 with @xmath59@xcite , multiplied by 1.12 to match the high - temperature rusr@xmath0gdcu@xmath0o@xmath1 data .",
    "finally , @xmath60 is approximated by data measured on a sintered sample of srruo@xmath18 , which displays a magnitude and temperature dependence similar to that of sr@xmath0ruo@xmath61@xcite .",
    "all these data are shown in figure [ fig : figure1 ] , together with the resulting @xmath62 calculated from eqns .",
    "[ eqn : h_add ] and [ eqn : s_add ] .",
    "given the uncertainties in the approximated ruo@xmath0 and cuo@xmath0 layer properties the two @xmath63 curves calculated independently from the drops in @xmath55 and @xmath56 agree well qualitatively . if tep data for a sample of 20% sn - doped rusr@xmath0gdcu@xmath0o@xmath1 , in which we shall argue that @xmath54 is strongly suppressed below @xmath2 , is used to approximate @xmath58 , the agreement is also quantitative .",
    "because the tep is a less sensitive function of @xmath64 than the hall effect , the difference between @xmath65 and @xmath58 is quite small compared with that between @xmath66 and @xmath39 .",
    "thus the value of @xmath64 calculated from the tep data is more sensitive to inaccuracy in the assumed @xmath58 data .",
    "this explains why using the ( only slightly different ) 20% sn - doped data to approximate @xmath67 results in a better match to @xmath63 calculated from the hall effect .",
    "whichever data are used , the results show a rapid rise in the relative conductivity of the ruo@xmath0 layer below 150k , to @xmath68 or higher .        the diamagnetic sn@xmath16 ion substitutes for ru in solid solution , and is slightly larger in size than ru@xmath69",
    ". the effects of doping the ru site are of extreme interest given the current debate regarding the spin and charge configuration of the ru ions@xcite .",
    "we note that the sn - doped samples studied here were from two sources prepared with slightly different annealing strategies .",
    "comparison of their sample resistivities is therefore not necessarily meaningful , as annealing strongly affects the grain - boundary conductivity of rusr@xmath0gdcu@xmath0o@xmath1@xcite . in general the resistivity of sintered high-@xmath4 materials",
    "is also affected by sample density@xcite .    for the 2.5% and 7.5% samples the resistivity ( figure [ fig : figure2 ] ) is metallic , and similar in magnitude to the undoped sample .",
    "the 20% sample has a higher resistivity and shows a small semiconducting upturn at low temperatures , while both the magnitude and upturn are far larger for the 40% sample . estimating @xmath4 from the onset of the resistive transition reveals a gradual increase from 40.5k for the 2.5% sample to 43.5k for the 20% sample , while the 40% sample has a reduced @xmath4 of just 30k .",
    "the tep , @xmath55 , and hall effect , @xmath56 , are much less affected by grain - boundaries than the resistivity . in conventional high - t@xmath12 materials",
    "they closely reflect bulk cuo@xmath0 layer properties in conventional high-@xmath4 materials@xcite .",
    "the hall effect data show a slow and monotonic decrease in @xmath4 with increasing sn concentration , but it should be remembered that these data were taken in a field of 10 t and only partly reflect the zero - field @xmath4 .",
    "the vertical arrows in figure [ fig : figure2 ] ( and in subsequent figures ) show the location of the magnetic transition .",
    "the tep data show that @xmath4 ( defined by the maximum in the derivative ) rises by @xmath704k in going from the 2.5% sample to the 20% sample , in good agreement with the resistivity data .",
    "the 40% sample shows a much lower transition temperature , both in @xmath27 and @xmath71 .",
    "the increase in @xmath4 with sn concentration is attributed to a transfer of holes into the cuo@xmath0 layer@xcite , though we observe a smaller increase than the @xmath7012k reported previously@xcite . in the earlier studies @xmath4",
    "was defined from the resistivity onset , and the @xmath4 values obtained for low doping levels were significantly lower , possibly due to granularity .    on examining the temperature and doping dependence of the normal - state properties , one immediately observes that the room temperature tep @xmath72 is little changed by the addition of sn .",
    "this result is strange given the rise of @xmath73k in @xmath4 as the doping level is increased to 20% .",
    "the change in the hall effect is also counter - intuitive : the 30% increase in going from 0 to 20% sn would normally indicate a _ decrease _ in hole concentration .",
    "this apparent paradox is resolved when it is noticed that the anomalous drop in @xmath27 below @xmath2 is diminished in the 2.5% and 7.5% samples , and is absent in the 20% sample : as the sn concentration is increased the ruo@xmath0 layer becomes well localized below @xmath2 , reflecting significantly reduced conductivity at all temperatures .",
    "the changes in @xmath74 and @xmath72 may then be explained quite simply : the introduction of sn dopes a few extra holes into the cuo@xmath0 layer , increasing @xmath32 and raising @xmath4 by @xmath704k , but also drives the ruo@xmath0 layer more insulating .",
    "thus while @xmath39 probably decreases slightly , the overall hall effect increases as the ruo@xmath0 layer no longer provides a parallel conduction pathway . the slight increase in @xmath32 which would normally decrease the measured tep , is balanced by the decreasing @xmath54 , which removes the suppression of the tep by the ruo@xmath0 layer , leaving it relatively unchanged overall .",
    "certainly , the increase in doping is far smaller than one would expect from substituting sn@xmath16 for ru@xmath75 , suggesting that the mean valency of the ru ion is less than 5 + .",
    "this conclusion is supported by recent xanes measurements@xcite .",
    "the reduction in the room - temperature @xmath27 of pure rusr@xmath0gdcu@xmath0o@xmath1 , due to conductivity in the ruo@xmath0 layer , was estimated to be of the order of 30% .",
    "this is entirely consistent with the rise in @xmath27 observed as the sn concentration is increased to 20% , assuming that @xmath76 .",
    "the 40% sn - doped sample does not fit well into this picture , having a much larger @xmath27 at all temperatures .",
    "given the much larger resistivity of this sample and its drastically reduced @xmath4 , it is possible that some sn@xmath77cu substitution has occurred , reducing the cuo@xmath0 layer doping state , or that there are significant impurities present .",
    "nb also substitutes for ru in the rusr@xmath0gdcu@xmath0o@xmath1 structure , but has a dramatically different effect on the transport properties .",
    "in contrast to the sn ion , which has a charge of 4 + , nb is believed to substitute in its usual 5 + state@xcite , and thus for an average ru valency of less than five will remove holes from the system , further under - doping it .",
    "the room - temperature tep bears this out , showing a large increase proportionate with nb doping ( see figure [ fig : figure3 ] ) and confirming that the cuo@xmath0 layer is progressively under - doped by the substitution of nb .",
    "this conclusion is supported by the commensurate increase in the hall effect and the rapid reduction of @xmath4 , which is 19k for the 10% sample and below 1.5k ( if present at all ) in the 20% sample .",
    "the effect of nb doping on the ru layer is less clear .",
    "the hall effect of the 10% sample displays a maximum near @xmath2 , suggesting increased ruo@xmath0 conductivity below this temperature , but the drop is not as clear as in the undoped sample . for 20%",
    "nb@xmath77ru substitution @xmath27 rises to a more or less constant value of 1.2@xmath78m@xmath22c@xmath37 below 200k , and there is no sign of a significant change at @xmath2 .",
    "the conclusion from the tep and hall effect data , then , is that the transition from localized to itinerant behavior of the ruo@xmath0 layer is suppressed by the addition of nb , as it is by the addition of sn .",
    "the resistivity , on the other hand , shows surprisingly little difference between the 10% and 20% samples  in fact the residual resistivity ( extrapolated from the linear high - temperature data ) actually _",
    "decreases_. a possible scenario consistent with this result is that the ruo@xmath0 layer becomes _ more _ itinerant both above and below @xmath2 as the nb level is increased .",
    "however , if this were the case , the increased @xmath54 would be expected to suppress both @xmath27 and @xmath71 below the cuo@xmath0 plane values .",
    "in fact , for @xmath4=19k and @xmath79k , the universal relationship between @xmath72 and @xmath4 predicts @xmath80vk@xmath37 , as observed .",
    "thus , while the increased @xmath71 and @xmath27 , and the reduced @xmath4 are consistent with a reduced hole concentration in the cuo@xmath0 layer and a localized ruo@xmath0 layer , the relatively good conductivity of the 20% nb - doped sample is not .",
    "one possible explanation is that the behavior of the resistivity is extrinsic to the bulk in the 20% nb sample , resulting from either increased grain - boundary conductivity , or increased sample density .      unlike nb and sn ,",
    "which substitute for ru , ce substitutes for gd in the layer separating the two cuo@xmath0 planes , and so would be expected to affect these more than the ruo@xmath0 layers from which it is relatively remote .",
    "the ce ion is expected to be in the 4 + state in rusr@xmath0gdcu@xmath0o@xmath1 , as it is in the structurally similar compound rusr@xmath0(gd@xmath81ce@xmath82)cu@xmath0o@xmath83@xcite ; hence its substitution for gd@xmath17 should further underdope the material .    two samples ( 10% and 20% ce@xmath77gd ) were measured , and of all the doped samples studied these exhibit the most remarkable and revealing transport properties : a large drop in @xmath27 below @xmath2 ( in fact becoming negative in the 10% sample below @xmath7030k ) , and a large tep at room temperature which , like the hall effect , drops very rapidly below @xmath2 .",
    "these data are shown in figure [ fig : figure4 ] , along with the resistivities of the two samples .",
    "we note first that , as with other electron doping substitutions ( ce for gd , la for sr and hydrogen doping ) , @xmath2 is driven upwards .",
    "this appears to reflect an increasing ru@xmath16 fraction .",
    "the 10% ce sample will be dealt with first . as with the undoped sample , the departure from cuprate - like properties below @xmath2 indicates a transition from localized to itinerant behavior in the ruo@xmath0 layer . in this case , however , the room temperature tep , @xmath84vk@xmath37 , indicates a much lower cuo@xmath0 layer carrier concentration of @xmath85 holes / cu .",
    "this is consistent with the increased hall coefficient , which is probably still depressed from the true cuo@xmath0 value by residual conductivity in the ruo@xmath0 layer , and the large resistivity with its insulating upturn at low temperature .",
    "having concluded that @xmath86 , and hence @xmath87 , is much lower than in the undoped sample , the reason for the dramatic effects seen in @xmath27 and @xmath71 below @xmath2 becomes clear : the ratio @xmath88 is much larger in the ce - doped sample at low temperature , allowing the intrinsic ruo@xmath0 layer properties to dominate the behavior .",
    "the effect of changes in @xmath88 is greater for @xmath27 than @xmath71 , but for these samples the increased @xmath54 depresses the @xmath89 contribution to the total tep so much that @xmath90 dominates below 50k .",
    "the basis for this assertion is the double maximum in @xmath91 : initially , at low temperatures , @xmath55 follows a curve reasonably consistent with the tep of srruo@xmath18 . this contribution would appear to saturate at a value of @xmath92vk@xmath37 ; however , above 50k increasing @xmath87 allows @xmath89 to contribute , and the overall tep then rises more rapidly .",
    "the same qualitative treatment may be applied successfully to the hall effect data , though in order to explain the negative values below @xmath7030k it is necessary to assume a negative hall coefficient for the ruo@xmath0 layer of around @xmath93m@xmath22c@xmath37 .",
    "examining typical data from the sr@xmath94ru@xmath95o@xmath96 series one finds that @xmath27 of sr@xmath18ru@xmath0o@xmath97 remains positive at all temperatures , while that of sr@xmath0ruo@xmath61 becomes negative below 20k , but reaches just @xmath98m@xmath22c@xmath37 near 1k .",
    "however , srruo@xmath18 , which has the most similar ferromagnetic ruo@xmath0 layer to rusr@xmath0gdcu@xmath0o@xmath1 , has a negative @xmath27 below 100k , reaching a field - dependent value of @xmath99m@xmath22c@xmath37 below 60k@xcite .",
    "thus the value of @xmath27 observed in the ce - doped sample at low temperature is the same order of magnitude as that in srruo@xmath18 , confirming that the ruo@xmath0 layer dominates the transport properties .",
    "it is interesting to note that , though it may not be a large effect , ce substitution for gd should drive the mean ru valence closer to 4 + , as it is in srruo@xmath18 .",
    "turning now to the resistivity , one encounters a problem : if the ruo@xmath0 layer is indeed metallic below @xmath2 , why does the resistivity increase so dramatically as @xmath100 ?",
    "there are two possible answers to this question : either both the ruo@xmath0 and cuo@xmath0 layers are at least semiconducting , but such that @xmath101 , or it may be that insulating grain boundaries cause the upturn .",
    "the second of these scenarios seems more likely . in this case",
    "the tep and hall effect , being much less sensitive to inter - grain connectivity , are determined by a weakly metallic intrinsic @xmath54 .",
    "support for this conclusion is provided by close examination of the resistivity ( figure [ fig : figure5 ] ) which shows an extended metallic region below @xmath2 .",
    "this type of behavior is not uncommon in rusr@xmath0gdcu@xmath0o@xmath1   in fact extrinsic upturns in resistivity are observed in poorly annealed undoped samples . interestingly though",
    ", transport measurements on srruo@xmath18 also show a minimum in resistivity below t@xmath102 in samples where there is some disorder in the ruo@xmath0 layer@xcite .",
    "the temperature at which the minimum occurs , and the magnitude of the upturn below it both increase with ruo@xmath0 layer disorder : in good quality films the highest temperature minimum observed is 40k , coincident with the maximum residual resistivity@xcite . as the ruo@xmath0 layer may be considerably disordered in these doped rusr@xmath0gdcu@xmath0o@xmath1 samples , it is possible that the behavior shown in figure [ fig : figure5 ] is intrinsic to the ruo@xmath0 layer , and not a product of grain boundary resistivity .",
    "an extended anneal of the ce - doped sample could be used to test the origin of the effect , as it should improve the quality of the grain boundaries in the material .",
    "the 20% ce - doped sample appears initially to be inconsistent with the interpretation of the 10% ce data presented above : @xmath27 is higher at room temperature , as one would expect for even greater under - doping caused by the increase in ce content , but @xmath72 is actually _ lower _ than that of the 10% sample , apparently implying an increased hole concentration .",
    "the paradox may be resolved straightforwardly if one accepts that @xmath103 , even at room temperature , in this sample .",
    "then the values of @xmath72 and @xmath74 for the material are no longer dominated by the cuo@xmath0 layer ; @xmath44 and @xmath104 may both in fact be much larger than the overall measured values so long as @xmath105 and @xmath106 are lower , as expected . from the peak in the hall effect data , @xmath2 of this sample appears to be depressed by about 30k from its value in the undoped sample , while the resistivity at 50k is more than two orders of magnitude greater , and the sample is insulating , probably due to extreme granularity .      the ratio @xmath107 may be extracted from the data for the 10% ce doped sample using the two - band model , as described for the undoped material in the previous chapter . as in the previous calculation ,",
    "typical @xmath67 and @xmath108 data are matched to the high temperature rusr@xmath0gdcu@xmath0o@xmath1 data , where @xmath54 is assumed to be small compared with @xmath87 and the overall properties reflect those of the cuo@xmath0 layer most strongly .",
    "the deviation from cuprate - like behavior at lower temperatures is then used to extract the ratio @xmath63 .    for this sample ,",
    "@xmath67 data were taken as 1.05 times @xmath55 measured on a sample of under - doped sintered yba@xmath0cu@xmath18o@xmath48 , with @xmath109@xcite .",
    "@xmath108 data were taken as 1.16 times @xmath27 measured on a similar sample with @xmath110@xcite .",
    "@xmath27 and @xmath71 are particularly strong functions of doping in this region of the phase diagram : the good agreement in the values of @xmath111 required for the two sets of data to match those of rusr@xmath0gdcu@xmath0o@xmath1 suggests that the assumption of negligible @xmath54 is reasonable .",
    "the tep of the ruo@xmath0 layer is approximated by that of sintered srruo@xmath18 , as before . as",
    "the hall effect becomes negative at low temperatures in ce - doped rusr@xmath0gdcu@xmath0o@xmath1 taking @xmath112 , as was done for the undoped material , will not work .",
    "instead a rough approximation to data for srruo@xmath18 is used@xcite , which shows a field - dependent value of @xmath113 at 20k .",
    "the measured and estimated data , together with the results of the calculations are shown in figure [ fig : figure6 ] . above 50k",
    "there is remarkable agreement between @xmath63 calculated from the tep data ( @xmath114 ) and that calculated independently from the hall effect data ( @xmath115 ) , lending confidence both to the model and to the estimated @xmath56 and @xmath55 data for the ruo@xmath0 and cuo@xmath0 layers . below 50k the agreement is not so good : @xmath115 carries on increasing , a direct result of @xmath66 becoming very close to the estimated @xmath57 at low temperatures .",
    "@xmath65 does not approach the estimated @xmath60 as closely , and hence @xmath114 does not continue to increase .",
    "emerging clearly from these data is a large increase in @xmath64 below @xmath2 . at 50k",
    "@xmath116 , whereas for the undoped material the increase in @xmath88 is just 0.3 .",
    "the properties of the ruo@xmath0 layer dominate the overall transport properties of rusr@xmath0gdcu@xmath0o@xmath1 below @xmath117k in this 10% ce - doped sample .",
    "the remainder of the doped samples studied contained y , dy and eu on the gd site , plus a 5% li - doped sample , in which cu is substituted .",
    "the transport data for all these samples are shown in figure [ fig : figure7 ] .",
    "the hall effect shows the ` usual ' anomalous downturn below @xmath2 in all these samples .",
    "the magnitude of the downturn , due to the transition to a more itinerant ru layer , is approximately constant , leading to the conclusion that doping the cu and gd sites does not greatly affect the localization of carriers in the ruo@xmath0 layer .",
    "substituting a small amount of li@xmath118 for cu@xmath119 causes virtually no change in the tep , but depresses @xmath4 by approximately 20k .",
    "the hall effect of this sample is slightly larger than that of the undoped sample , possibly due to some cross - substitution of li with ru , depressing @xmath54 , or a slight decrease in the cuo@xmath0 layer carrier concentration .",
    "these results are consistent with li@xmath118 acting as a pair - breaker in the cuo@xmath0 layer , but with little other effect on transport properties .",
    "the rate of suppression of @xmath4 with li substitution in rusr@xmath0gdcu@xmath0o@xmath1 , @xmath120k/% , is about one quarter of that observed in under - doped yba@xmath0cu@xmath18o@xmath48 ( @xmath121 ) when either li or zn is substituted for cu @xcite .",
    "however the concentration of li in the rusr@xmath0gdcu@xmath0o@xmath1 sample studied is nominal , and the difference in the rate of suppression may simply reflect loss of li by vaporization during the long synthesis and anneal .",
    "the isovalent substitution of y or dy for gd actually causes a slight _ decrease _ in the tep of rusr@xmath0gdcu@xmath0o@xmath1 , these being the only substitutions studied to do so .",
    "the implied increase in the doping level of the cuo@xmath0 layers , presumed to arise from an ion - size effect , is confirmed by the increased @xmath4 in these samples - approximately 2k ( 10% y ) and 6k ( 40% dy ) higher than in the undoped sample as seen by both resistivity and tep measurements .",
    "however , the magnitude of the hall effect is larger for these samples than for the undoped ones .",
    "having argued that the cuo@xmath0 layer is less under - doped in these two samples , this effect may only arise from a decrease in the conductivity of the ruo@xmath0 layer , partially removing the ` shorting ' of the cuo@xmath0 layer hall effect .",
    "full substitution of eu for gd causes an increase in @xmath72 to 90@xmath7vk@xmath37 , @xmath4 as measured by the tep or resistivity drops significantly , and @xmath27 is greatly increased .",
    "all these results suggest a drop in the cuo@xmath0 layer hole concentration , again consistent with the above - noted ion - size effect , perhaps coupled with a decrease in @xmath54 .",
    "the resistivity of this sample is much less metallic than that of the others ( which are all metallic , with magnitudes two to three times the well - annealed undoped sample ) , consistent with this interpretation .",
    "the hall effect and tep data described in this paper provide strong evidence for a transition from very poorly metallic to more itinerant behavior in the ruo@xmath0 layer below @xmath2 .",
    "results from substituted rusr@xmath0gdcu@xmath0o@xmath1 samples confirm this picture .",
    "the universal relationship between @xmath72 and @xmath32 appears to hold in rusr@xmath0gdcu@xmath0o@xmath1 as a result of the low @xmath54 at room temperature , though below @xmath2 both @xmath71 and @xmath27 are reduced by ` shorting ' of @xmath89 by the ruo@xmath0 layer .",
    "the two - band model proposed is successful in explaining most of the existing data qualitatively : the anomalies , which lie mainly in resistivity data , are most likely due to grain boundary and density effects .",
    "the quantitative agreement is also reasonably good .",
    "the results support a picture in which the ruo@xmath0 layer in the pure compound is localized above @xmath2 , with @xmath14 , but becomes more conducting below @xmath2 , mirroring the behavior of other ruthenates .    the transition from localized to itinerant ruo@xmath0 layer behavior at @xmath2 in the undoped compound",
    "may be modified by substituting ru with sn or nb .",
    "sn increases the doping level of the cuo@xmath0 layers , raising @xmath4 and suppressing @xmath2 , and simultaneously drives the ruo@xmath0 layer more insulating .",
    "nb under - dopes the cuo@xmath0 layers , lowering @xmath4 , and also appears to drive the ruo@xmath0 layer insulating , though the 20% sample does not show the expected semiconducting resistivity .",
    "these results imply an initial ru valence lying between 4 + and 5 + , in agreement with x - ray absorption near edge spectroscopy ( xanes ) data which may be modelled as an admixture of ru@xmath16 and ru@xmath75 spectra in a 40:60 ratio@xcite .    as might be expected , doping of the cu site has little effect on @xmath2 or the transport properties of the ruo@xmath0 layer .",
    "li@xmath118 acts as a pair - breaking impurity in the cuo@xmath0 layer and causes a depression of @xmath4 in line with its behavior in other cuprates .",
    "isovalent doping of the gd site with other lanthanide elements changes the cuo@xmath0 layer doping level , with a remarkably strong variation in @xmath4 .",
    "this appears to be a ion - size doping effect .",
    "altervalent substitution of ce for gd rapidly reduces the doping level of the cuo@xmath0 layers and drives the material non - superconducting . in all but the ce - doped samples , the conductivity of the ruo@xmath0 layer only ever reaches a modest fraction of that of the cuo@xmath0 layer . in the 10% ce - doped sample",
    "the more heavily under - doped cuo@xmath0 layer has an insulating upturn at low temperature , whilst the ruo@xmath0 layer remains more metallic , and so the ratio of their conductivities reaches at least 1.9 .",
    "to a first approximation the electronic properties of the cuo@xmath0 layer in rusr@xmath0gdcu@xmath0o@xmath1 are the same as those of similar cuo@xmath0 layers in other high-@xmath4 cuprate superconductors in all respects .",
    "this conclusion is supported by the resistivity , tep and hall effect data presented here , and by results on the specific heat jump at @xmath4 . on a more detailed level ,",
    "magneto - transport measurements reveal an interaction between the carriers in these layers and the magnetization of the ruo@xmath0 layer .",
    "this interaction , with an energy which would seem to be of the same order as the sc energy gap@xcite , is not sufficient to destroy superconductivity .",
    "the electronic properties of the ruo@xmath0 layer appear to bear a remarkable similarity to those observed in the ruthenate srruo@xmath18 . at room temperature",
    "the conductivity of the layer is perhaps 10% of that of the cuo@xmath0 layer , with @xmath122 , indicating very badly metallic or localized behavior .",
    "below @xmath2 the conductivity of the layer rises significantly - by at least 0.3@xmath87 .",
    "this increase raises the weighting of the ruo@xmath0 layer properties relative to those of the cuo@xmath0 layer in the admixture that determines the overall transport properties of rusr@xmath0gdcu@xmath0o@xmath1 . as the hall effect and tep of the ruo@xmath0 layer",
    "are both considerably smaller than those in the cuo@xmath0 layer the result is a drop in both @xmath27 and @xmath71 below @xmath2 . in pure rusr@xmath0gdcu@xmath0o@xmath1 , and also in most of the substituted variants studied , @xmath54 remains lower than @xmath87 over the whole temperature range .",
    "for the ce - doped samples studied , however , the cuo@xmath0 layer becomes insulating at low temperatures , allowing the poorly metallic ruo@xmath0 layer to dominate the conductivity , and its intrinsic transport properties to show strongly in the overall @xmath27 and @xmath71 of the material .",
    "the two - band model of parallel conduction in the ruo@xmath0 and cuo@xmath0 layers has been very successful in modelling the transport properties observed in all the rusr@xmath0gdcu@xmath0o@xmath1 samples studied , and it has been possible to describe well the effects of doping the different atomic sites .",
    "the inferred mixed valency of ru , together with the onset of itinerancy at the magnetic transition suggests a possible role of a double - exchange mechanism in the magnetic interactions but also raises the possibility of charge ordering in these compounds at appropriate doping levels ."
