    "transition metal ( tm ) oxides have been one of the main subjects of materials science for decades .",
    "experimental and theoretical efforts are driven by their rich , complex , and potentially useful behaviors originating from strong correlations between electrons and/or electrons and lattices.@xcite the recent developments in the crystal growth techniques , in particular the ( laser ) molecular - beam epitaxy , have made us recognize the opportunity to further control their behaviors and to generate phenomena that are not realized in the bulk systems.@xcite    here , we focus on the magnetic behavior at an interface between perovskite manganite and other tm oxides .",
    "perovskite manganites , especially la@xmath7sr@xmath8mno@xmath9 ( lsmo ) , are particularly important because of their ferromagnetic ( f ) metallic behavior with relatively high curie temperature @xmath10 and large polarization . controlling the magnetic interaction at interfaces involving manganites would cause a technological breakthrough for electronic devices using , for example , a tunneling magnetoresistance ( tmr ) effect@xcite and an exchange bias ( eb ) effect.@xcitethis requires the microscopic information on the orbital states , not only on the spin states as demonstrated for cuprate / manganite interfaces in refs .   and .",
    "however , it remains controversial whether the magnetic moment is induced in the cuprate region@xcite or the dead layers appear in the manganite region.@xcite    the difficulty dealing with interfaces involving strongly - correlated electron systems comes from the small volume fraction which makes the experimental analysis challenging , and strong - correlation effects which hinder some of theoretical treatments .",
    "therefore , if a goodenough - kanamori - type @xcite transparent description of the interfacial magnetic interaction becomes available , both experiment and theory would greatly benefit .    in this paper , we present a general consideration for the magnetic interaction at an interface involving manganites .",
    "we first focus on the interfacial interaction derived by @xmath1 orbitals which have the largest hybridization along the @xmath11 layer - stacking direction .",
    "we see that the sign of the magnetic interaction via the @xmath1 orbitals is naturally fixed based on the molecular orbitals formed at the interface and the generalized hund s rule .",
    "the argument uses localized orbitals , and therefore shows only the qualitative trend .",
    "the molecular orbitals effectively lift the degeneracy between @xmath1 and @xmath12 orbitals by the order of the hopping intensity . in the second part ,",
    "we perform the model hartree - fock calculation and show that the broken degeneracy can lead to the additional change in the magnetic interaction between the interfacial mn layer and its neighboring mn layer .",
    "we also discuss how to generalize the molecular - orbital based argument for more complicated situations including @xmath6 orbitals .",
    "in this section , we consider the magnetic interaction between manganite and other tm oxides focusing on the molecular orbitals formed by @xmath1 orbitals which have the largest overlap at the interface .",
    "the tm region is specified by the number of electrons occupying a @xmath1 orbital . here , @xmath6",
    "electrons are assumed to be electronically inactive and considered as localized spins when finite number of electrons occupy @xmath6 orbitals .",
    "generalization including these electrons will be discussed later .    _",
    "@xmath13 system_. let us start from the simplest case , an interface between mn and a @xmath13 system ( fig .",
    "[ fig : d0 ] ) . in this case , the bonding ( b ) orbital is occupied by an electron whose spin is parallel to the localized @xmath6 spin in mn , while the antibonding ( ab ) orbital is unoccupied . when there are other unpaired electrons in the @xmath13 system at @xmath12 and/or @xmath6 orbitals , their spins align parallel to that of the electron in the b orbital due to the hund coupling .",
    "thus , the f coupling is generated between mn and @xmath13 systems .",
    "this is equivalent to the double - exchange ( de ) interaction originally proposed by zener.@xcite when @xmath12 is much lower in energy than @xmath1 and in the interfacial mn layer ( termed @xmath12 order ) , mn and @xmath13 systems are virtually decoupled .",
    "thus , the magnetic coupling is due to the superexchange ( se ) interaction between @xmath6 electrons .",
    "this interaction is either f or antiferromagnetic ( af ) depending on the orbital state and the occupancy of the tm @xmath6 level .",
    "orbitals on mn ( right ) and tm with the @xmath13 configuration ( left ) . ]    _",
    "@xmath14 normal_. this simple consideration can be easily generalized to @xmath3 and @xmath4 systems .",
    "first we consider that the @xmath1 and @xmath12 are nearly degenerate in the interfacial mn layer and the unoccupied @xmath12 level in the tm region is much higher than the @xmath1 level ( fig .",
    "[ fig : d12 ] , top figures ) .",
    "we call this configuration `` normal '' ( n ) configuration . in the lowest energy configuration ,",
    "b orbitals and the mn @xmath12 orbital are occupied by electrons . for the @xmath3 system ,",
    "the f interaction is favorable as in the @xmath13 system . on the other hand , for the @xmath4 system ,",
    "the down electron orbital is hybridized with the minority band in the mn region .",
    "thus , the `` down '' b orbital is higher in energy and has larger weight on the tm than the `` up '' b orbital . because of the hund coupling with the `` down '' electron in the b orbital , other unpaired electrons , if they exist in @xmath12 and/or @xmath6 orbitals , tend to be antiparallel to the mn spin .",
    "since @xmath12 orbitals are predominantly occupied in the interfacial mn layer due to the b / ab splitting of @xmath1-based molecular orbitals , further stabilization of @xmath12 orbitals in the mn region , i.e. , @xmath12 order , would not affect the interfacial magnetic coupling discussed here .",
    "but , this could reverse the magnetic coupling between the interfacial mn layer and the second mn layer as discussed in the next section .    _",
    "@xmath14 anomalous_. when the @xmath12 level in the tm region becomes lower than the mn @xmath12 level , the charge transfer occurs .",
    "we shall call this configuration `` anomalous '' ( an ) configuration ( fig .",
    "[ fig : d12 ] , middle figures ) .",
    "the electron transferred to the tm @xmath12 orbital has the same spin as the higher energy b orbital due to the hund coupling ( indicated by arrows ) .",
    "therefore , the sign of the magnetic coupling between the mn and @xmath14 systems is unchanged .",
    "note that this argument is applicable when the hopping probability between @xmath12 orbitals in the mn and the tm regions is negligibly small .",
    "the finite hopping probability would make the charge transfer continuous . furthermore , when the hopping probability becomes large , the de interaction is generated .",
    "although the de interaction through @xmath12 bonds may not be realistic , it cooperatively stabilizes the f spin alignment for the @xmath3 case , while it competes with the af tendency for the @xmath4 case .",
    "magnetic interactions discussed so far are insensitive to the electron density in the interfacial mn because the interactions are mainly derived from the virtual electron excitation from the occupied @xmath1 orbital in the tm region to the unoccupied counterpart in the mn region .",
    "next , we consider that the @xmath1 level is much lower than the @xmath12 in the interfacial mn layer due to either the local jahn - teller distortion or compressive strain originating from the substrate ( fig .",
    "[ fig : d12 ] , lower figures denoted by `` jt '' ) .",
    "the magnetic coupling in this case is sensitive to the electron density of the interfacial mn .",

    "black ( light ) lines indicate the level of majority ( minority ) spins .",
    "the up level and down level are exchange split resulting in the level scheme as indicated .",
    "the minority levels are neglected in the upper left two because these are irrelevant . ]    _",
    "@xmath3 jt_. when the mn @xmath1 density is close to 1 , the se interaction between the occupied @xmath1 orbitals becomes af . on the other hand ,",
    "when the density is much less than 1 , the f interaction between @xmath13 configuration on mn and @xmath3 becomes dominant .    _",
    "@xmath4 jt_. when the mn @xmath1 occupancy is close to 1 , `` up ''",
    "electrons are localized on each sites because both b and ab molecular orbitals are occupied while down electrons can be excited or leaked from the @xmath4 system to the mn minority level , i.e. , down electron density is virtually reduced in the tm region . as a result , unpaired spins , if they exist in @xmath12 and/or @xmath6 orbitals , become parallel to the up spin , i.e. , f coupling .",
    "when the mn @xmath1 density becomes much less than 1 , the up ab orbital becomes less occupied while keeping the occupancy of b orbitals relatively unchanged . eventually , the down density in the tm region becomes larger than the up density , and the magnetic coupling between the mn and @xmath4 regions becomes af .",
    "in the previous section , we discussed the interfacial magnetic coupling controlled by the molecular orbitals .",
    "the separation between b and ab molecular levels can become as large as the order of @xmath15 , the hybridization between @xmath1 orbitals along the @xmath11 direction . since the interfacial mn @xmath1 band is represented by the b ( ab ) @xmath1 orbital for a @xmath16/manganite interface , the @xmath17 degeneracy is effectively lifted in the interface layer .",
    "this degeneracy lifting is expected to affect the magnetic interaction in the mn region . in this section",
    ", we discuss this effect using the microscopic model calculation .",
    "we consider a two - band de model given by @xmath18 here , an electron annihilation operator at site @xmath19 and orbital @xmath20 $ ] is given by @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and the level difference between @xmath23 and @xmath24 is given by @xmath25 .",
    "we consider the large hund coupling limit , in which the spin direction of a conduction electron is always parallel to that of a localized @xmath6 spin on the same site , and omit the spin index . instead , the relative orientation of @xmath6 spins is reflected in the hopping matrix ; @xmath26 is the unitary transformation representing the rotation of the spin direction between sites @xmath19 and @xmath27 . for simplicity ,",

    "the main effect of the level separation @xmath25 is changing the stability of planar - type af ( a or a ) with respect to the chain - type af ( c or c ) and f states .",
    "in particular , the a - af phase is stabilized by the positive @xmath25 more strongly than the c - af phase by the negative @xmath25 .",
    "this is because the energy gain by the de mechanism is favorable for the a - af than the c - af .",
    "the result is semiquantitatively consistent with the previous report based on the density - functional theory.@xcite at @xmath65 , the boundary between f and a - af phases is moved down to @xmath66 at @xmath67 .",
    "this behavior suggests that , when the @xmath1 ab level for the @xmath14/manganite interfaces is about @xmath15 higher than the mn @xmath12 level , the magnetic coupling between the interfacial mn and the second mn layers is switched to af while retaining the intraplane f coupling .",
    "we confirmed this behavior by computing the surface phase diagram considering f phase and two af phases : a1(2 ) where the surface layer ( and the second layer ) is antiferromagnetically coupled to its neighbor .",
    "we introduce positive @xmath25 only on the surface layers in the 20-layer slab . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pd ] ( d ) , a large part of f phase is replaced by a1 phase compared with the bulk phase diagram ( b ) .",
    "( precise phase boundary requires detailed information of the surface or interface . )",

    "a question one may ask is what causes the `` an situation '' in ybco and the `` n situation '' in bfo ? a qualitative explanation is as follow : in ybco , the unoccupied cu @xmath12 state is right above the mott gap and its position is nearly identical to the occupied band of manganites.@xcite therefore , the charge transfer from mn @xmath17 to cu @xmath12 can easily occur . on the other hand , the high - spin state is realized in bfo , and the unoccupied @xmath12 state with opposite spin with respect to the majority electrons is located far above the gap . in addition , the very close chemical potentials ( i.e. close @xmath1 levels ) of bfo ( ref .  ) and lsmo ( ref .  ) maximize the b and ab splittings .",

    ", because of the strong on - site coulomb interactions , the energy gain by forming b orbitals becomes small for @xmath6 electrons and comparable to having electrons in both b and ab orbitals with the parallel spin configuration .",

    "<S> a general consideration is presented for the magnetic interaction at an interface between a perovskite manganite and other transition metal oxides . </S>",
    "<S> the latter is specified by the electron number @xmath0 in the @xmath1 level as @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> based on the molecular orbitals formed at the interface and the generalized hund s rule , the sign of the magnetic interaction is rather uniquely determined . </S>",
    "<S> the exception is when the @xmath1 orbital is stabilized in the interfacial manganite layer neighboring to a @xmath3 or @xmath4 system . in this case , the magnetic interaction is sensitive to the occupancy of the mn @xmath5 orbital . </S>",
    "<S> it is also shown that the magnetic interaction between the interfacial mn layer and the bulk region can be changed . </S>",
    "<S> manganite - based heterostructures thus show a rich magnetic behavior . </S>",
    "<S> we also present how to generalize the argument including @xmath6 orbitals . </S>"
