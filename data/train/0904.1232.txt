    "[ fig : device ] . with this device",
    "the teleportation can be carried out by just performing the joint detection of both cavities fields if , before detection , the sender ( alice ) maps the state of her atom onto the field state of her cavity , and the receiver ( bob ) creates the maximally entangled state of his atom and his cavity field .",

    "first , let us present the main idea in a simplified way  comparing it to the standard teleportation protocol  @xcite . in the standard teleportation protocol alice has unknown to her ( and to bob ) qubit @xmath4 . the state to be teleported is initially stored in the alice atom and next is mapped using the laser to the cavity field qubit , but the mapping is not perfect , and the initial state is slightly distorted",
    "let the state of the alice cavity field takes the form @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the normalization factor and @xmath7 is a parameter that measures to what degree the original state has been distorted .",
    "if there is no distortion @xmath8 , and the state is just the original state .",
    "it is important that the parameter @xmath7 does not depend on the original state ( it does not depend on @xmath9 and @xmath10 ) but depends solely on the mapping procedure which is known for both parties of the protocol .",
    "both parties can agree on the details of the procedure in advance .",
    "now the question arises : can we use our knowledge of @xmath7 to improve the fidelity of the teleported state ?",

    "[ fig : teleport ] .",
    "the first qubit is the alice cavity field qubit , the state of which is initially the state @xmath11 given by equation  eq .  ,",

    "the other two outcomes are rejected as unsuccessful .",
    "alice next communicate to bob , using the classical channel , the results of her measurement ( two classical bits ) , and bob applying the postmeasurement operations shown in fig .",

    "the most important role play the detectors @xmath44 and @xmath45 together with the beam splitter @xmath46 .",

    "alice during the second stage just waits for a finite time @xmath59 registering events of photon detection .",

    "note , however , that neither time @xmath56 nor time @xmath74 depend on the amplitudes of the teleported state .",
    "if in the preparation stage bob turns his laser on for time @xmath56 then , after the detection stage , the state of his system becomes identical to the initial unknown alice s state except for the phase factor @xmath75 fortunately , the phase factor can be removed using the zeeman evolution  @xcite , what bob performs in the last stage after receiving classical information about alice s measurement . at the end of the whole protocol bob has the original alice s state stored in his atom @xmath76 .",
    "it turns out that the fidelity of this teleportation protocol can be close to unity even for realistic cavity decay rates .",
    "figure  [ fig : fk ] shows teleportation fidelities of both protocols ( the modified with non - maximally - entangled state and the bose  _ et al .",
    "_ protocol ) as functions of the cavity decay rate .     for the modified protocol ( solid line ) and the original protocol ( dashed line ) for @xmath77 mhz.,width=264 ]    one can see that for real cavity decay rate",
    "@xmath78  mhz  @xcite the fidelity of teleported state is still equal unity while the fidelity of the original protocol does not exceed the value @xmath79 .",
    "this result is quite impressive but one can easily note that the high fidelity is not for free . since @xmath80 depends on the damping factor , the probability that the teleportation protocol will be successful is lowered by the increasing cavity decay rates .",
    "let us now estimate the probability of success for currently available cavities .",
    "the probability that all stages of the protocol will succeed has the following form : @xmath81 for @xmath59 , the probability of success can be very well approximated by @xmath82 we can use this simple formula to estimate the value of the success probability for the experimental parameters of ref .",

    "@xcite for the parameter values @xmath77 mhz .",
    "it is seen that the probability of success for the modified protocol goes to zero faster than that for the original protocol , but it still has considerable values for realistic decay rates .",
    "let us now take into account the important imperfection which is present in all real setups , i.e. , finite detection efficiency .",
    "this imperfection is caused by absorption in the mirrors , photon losses during the propagation between the cavities and the detectors , and by nonunity detectors efficiency . in ref .",
    "@xcite the overall detection efficiency is only @xmath87 .",
    "therefore , with such efficiency only a small fraction of all successful runs will be detected .",
    "moreover , the case of two photons emissions will be erroneously counted as a successful case if only one photon is detected .",
    "of course , this effect would lead to lowering of the fidelity .",
    "the two - photon case is also very important if detectors can not distinguish a single photon from two photons , since both emitted photons are always collected by the same detector  @xcite , it is not possible to reject such unsuccessful runs .",
    "if we want to estimate the real values for the teleportation fidelity and the success probability , we have to include the efficiency @xmath88 and the two - photon case in our calculations .",
    "the probability that two photons will be emitted from the cavities during the teleportation protocol and only one of them will be detected in the detection stage is given by @xmath89 where @xmath90 for photon - number - resolving detectors and @xmath91 for conventional photon detectors .",
    "this probability depends on the modulus of the amplitude @xmath10 which is in general unknown .",
    "hence , it is necessary to compute the average probability of two photon emissions taken over all possible input states .",
    "such an average probability takes the form @xmath92 the average probability that the measurement will indicate success is then given by @xmath93 in the case of two - photon emissions bob s atom is in the state @xmath94 .",
    "if we can not reject all runs in which two photons were emitted then the final state of bob s atom is a mixture of @xmath94 and @xmath20 , i.e. , @xmath95 we can calculate the average fidelity using the density matrix @xmath96 .",
    "the average fidelity of the teleportation protocol is given by @xmath97 where @xmath98 .",
    "it is now evident that there is one more important feature of the protocol .",
    "expressions  ( [ eq : peta ] ) and  ( [ eq : feta ] ) indicate that for large cavity decay rates , it is almost irrelevant if the detectors can distinguish a single photon from two photons . for sufficiently large cavity decay rates",
    "@xmath99 is small , and , therefore , @xmath100 for conventional detectors is close to unity .",
    "for example , the parameter s regime @xmath101 @xmath102 mhz leads to @xmath103 .",
    "hence , possible implementations of the protocol with currently available cavities do not require detectors with the single - photon resolution .",
    "the analysis of experimental feasibility of this protocol requires taking into account another imperfection , which is the spontaneous emission from the atom .",
    "we have done it using numerical calculations . in the following",
    "we present some details of the calculations .",
    "we have calculated the average fidelity and the average probability of success using hamiltonian  ( [ eq : hamiltonian0 ] ) and the quantum trajectories method  @xcite .",

    "if we want to satisfy this condition , we have to set @xmath3 to be small enough .",
    "then , however , we get considerable population of the excited state @xmath104 .",
    "fortunately , this population oscillates , and we can use the fine tuning technique  @xcite to minimize its effect . applying this technique we have chosen @xmath107 mhz . for these parameters",
    "analytical expressions for @xmath74 and @xmath56 are not precise enough , and therefore we have used numerically optimized times @xmath108 and @xmath109 and not too long detection time @xmath110 .",
    "the detection time @xmath111 is long enough to get a quite high value of the fidelity  @xcite .",
    "we do not set longer times of the detection stage to make the influence of the dark counts on the protocol negligible .",
    "for the dark count rate of @xmath112  @xcite the mean time between dark counts ( @xmath0  ms for both detectors ) is much larger than the time window for detection in the protocol @xmath113 .",

    "of course , the spontaneous decay rate @xmath115  mhz and dark counts of @xmath112 reduce the average fidelity , but it is still well above the limit of @xmath79 .",

    "[ fig : peta ] .",
    "the probability of success tends to zero with decreasing @xmath88 . for the currently available efficiency of @xmath116 , the success rate has the value of @xmath85 , which means that it takes on average hundreds of runs to get successful teleportation .",
    "such small probability of success means that this teleportation protocol will not have commercial applications for currently available cavities and detectors .",

    "finally , we shortly discuss the realizability of our teleportation protocol .",
    "as mentioned above , almost all parameters used in our computations are feasible with current technology .",
    "the only parameter the value of which may be demanding for present technology is the detuning . in our numerical calculations",
    "we have chosen @xmath119  mhz , which is the value six times greater than that of ref .",
    "moreover , so far we have assumed that the laser pulses have rectangular shapes .",
    "this assumption makes it possible to examine the proposed teleportation protocol analytically and numerically .",

    "the pulses duration times used in our numerical calculations are much shorter : @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "so , it is rather unrealistic to implement experimentally the protocol in its present form . nevertheless , the protocol can be easily adapted for using other shapes of laser pulses .",
    "all what is actually needed to complete this teleportation protocol is the ability to perform the state mapping @xmath122 and the ability to generate the non - maximally - entangled state @xmath123 .",

    "the second operation can be achieved with short gaussian pulses .",
    "in conclusion , we have presented a modified protocol that , in principle , should allow for atomic - state teleportation via cavity decay using currently available optical cavities .",
    "we have shown that the destructive influence of large cavity decay on the fidelity of teleported state can be minimized by using in the teleportation protocol the non - maximally - entangled state instead of the maximally entangled state .",
