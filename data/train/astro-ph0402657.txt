    "the mounting observational evidence for the existence of dark energy ( de ) , which probably accounts for @xmath2 of the critical density of the universe @xcite , rises a number of questions concerning galaxy formation .",
    "the nature of de is suitably described by the parameter @xmath3 , which characterizes its equation of state .",
    "the  model ( @xmath4 ) was extensively studied during the last decade . recently much more attention was given to physically motivated models with variable @xmath5 @xcite , for which a number of n  body simulations have been performed ( klypin et al 2003 , kmmb03 hereafter , dolag et al .",
    "2003 , linder & jenkins 2003 , macci et al .",
    "one of the main results of kmmb03 was that dynamical de halos are denser than those with the standard   one . in this work",
    "we want to analyze the impact of this higher concentration on the strong lensing properties of the cluster size halos .",
    "was first noted by bartelmann et al .",
    "( 1998 ) ( for ocdm , scdm and   cosmology ) that the predicted number of giant arcs varies by orders of magnitude among different cosmological models .",
    "the agreement between data and   simulation was tested by many authors ( see meneghetti et al 2000 , dalal et al .",
    "2003 , wambsganss et al . 2004 )",
    "but the situation is still unclear .",
    "a direct comparison of arcs statistic with observational data is out of the scope of this work , what we want to point out is the capability of strong lensing to discriminate between different kinds of dark energy ( a similar paper but for a different choice of the dynamical de parameters was recently submitted by meneghetti et al .",
    "( 2004 ) ) .    here ,",
    "using a ray shooting technique , we make a lensing analysis of dark matter halos extracted from n - body simulations of cosmological models with varying @xmath5 arising from physically motivated potentials which admit tracker solutions .",
    "in particular , we focus on the two most popular variants of dynamical de @xcite .",
    "the first model was proposed by ratra & peebles ( 1984 , rp hereafter ) and it yields a rather slow evolution of @xmath5 .",
    "the second model @xcite is based on potentials found in supergravity ( sugra ) and it results in a much faster evolving @xmath5 .",
    "hence , rp and sugra potentials cover a large spectrum of evolving @xmath5 .",
    "these potentials are written as @xmath6 here @xmath7 is an energy scale , currently set in the range @xmath8@xmath9gev , relevant for the physics of fundamental interactions .",
    "the potentials depend also on the exponent @xmath10 .",
    "the parameters @xmath7 and @xmath10 define the de density parameter @xmath11 .",
    "however , we prefer to use @xmath7 and @xmath11 as independent parameters .",
    "figure  10 in mainini et al .",
    "( 2003b ) gives examples of @xmath5 evolution for rp and sugra models .",
    "the sugra model considered in this paper has @xmath12 gev this implies @xmath13 at @xmath14 , but @xmath5 drastically changes with redshift : @xmath15 at @xmath16 .",
    "the first rp model ( rp@xmath17 ) has the same value for @xmath7 of the sugra model . at redshift @xmath14",
    "it has @xmath18 ; then value of @xmath5 gradually changes with the redshift : at @xmath16 it is close to @xmath19 .",
    "although the @xmath5 interval spanned by this rp model covers values significantly above -0.8 ( not favored by observations ) , this case is still important both as a limiting reference case and to emphasize that models with constant @xmath5 and models with variable @xmath5 produce different results even if average values of @xmath5 are not so different . for the second rp model ( rp@xmath20 )",
    "we have chosen @xmath21 gev , in this case the value of the state parameter at redshift @xmath14 is the same of sugra : @xmath22 gev@xmath23 .",
    "this model is certainly better in agreement with cmb constrains but it loses most of its interest from a theoretical point of view : such a small value of @xmath7 has not any clear connection with the physics of fundamental interactions and so it has exactly the same `` fine tuning '' problem of the   model .",
    "we have normalized all the models in order to have today the same value of the @xmath24 density fluctuation on a scale of 8  , that has been chosen as @xmath25 .",
    "the adaptive refinement tree code ( art ; kravtsov , klypin & khokhlov 1997 ) was used to run the simulations .",
    "the art code starts with a uniform grid , which covers the whole computational box .",
    "this grid defines the lowest ( zeroth ) level of resolution of the simulation .",
    "the standard particles - mesh algorithms are used to compute density and gravitational potential on the zeroth - level mesh .",
    "the art code reaches high force resolution by refining all high density regions using an automated refinement algorithm .",
    "the refinements are recursive : the refined regions can also be refined , each subsequent refinement having half of the previous level s cell size .",
    "this creates a hierarchy of refinement meshes of different resolution , size , and geometry covering regions of interest .",
    "because each individual cubic cell can be refined , the shape of the refinement mesh can be arbitrary and match effectively the geometry of the region of interest .",
    "the criterion for refinement is the local density of particles : if the number of particles in a mesh cell ( as estimated by the cloud - in - cell method ) exceeds the level @xmath26 , the cell is split ( `` refined '' ) into 8 cells of the next refinement level .",
    "the refinement threshold depends on the refinement level .",
    "for the zero s level it is @xmath27 .",
    "for the higher levels it is set to @xmath28 .",
    "the code uses the expansion parameter @xmath29 as the time variable . during the integration , spatial refinement",
    "is accompanied by temporal refinement .",
    "namely , each level of refinement , @xmath30 , is integrated with its own time step @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the global time step of the zeroth refinement level .",
    "this variable time stepping is very important for accuracy of the results .",
    "as the force resolution increases , more steps are needed to integrate the trajectories accurately .",
    "extensive tests of the code and comparisons with other numerical @xmath33-body codes can be found in kravtsov ( 1999 ) and knebe et al .",
    "the code was modified to handle de of different types ( mainini et al 2003b & kmmb03 ) .",
    "we performed a low resolution simulation for each model with the following parameters : box size : 320 , number of particles : @xmath34 , force resolution : 9.2 , all the simulations have the same initial random seed so at @xmath14 the clusters are more or less in the same positions . than we selected the four massive clusters in the   simulation and re - run them with a mass resolution 64 times higher .",
    "the same clusters are also re - run with the same resolution also in the rp and sugra models . at the end",
    "we have 12 lensing systems ( each cluster can be seen by three different orthogonal directions ) for each cosmological model , with a mass resolution of @xmath35 and a force resolution of 4.8 .",
    "a complete list of simulation parameters is contained in table  1 .",
    ".parameters of simulations [ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]",
    "in order to compute arc statistics for the models discussed above , we adopted a technique similar to the one originally proposed by bartelmann & weiss ( 1994 ) .",
    "we center the cluster in a cube of 4  side length and study three lenses , obtained by projecting the particle positions along the coordinate axes .",
    "this grants us a total of 12 lens planes per model that we treat as though being due to independent clusters , for our present purposes .",
    "we then divide the projected density field @xmath36 by the critical surface mass density for lensing @xmath37 so obtaining the convergence @xmath38 . here",
    "@xmath39 is the speed of light , @xmath40 is the gravitational constant , while @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 are the angular - diameter distances between lens and observer , source and observer , lens and source , respectively .",
    "once we set the lens and source redshift , the value of the angular diameter distance depends on the cosmological model .",
    "we detail this point in the next section . in figure",
    "[ fig : conv ] we show the convergence map for one of the cluster , whose length scale size is 4 .",
    "the deflection angle due to this 2d particle distribution , on a given point @xmath44 on the lens plane reads : @xmath45 here @xmath46 is the position of the @xmath47-th particles and @xmath33 is the total number of particles .",
    "as direct summation requires a long time , we sped up the code by using a p@xmath48m  like algorithm : the lens plane was divided into 128@xmath49128 cells and direct summation was applied to particles belonging to the same cell of @xmath50 and for its 8 neighbor cells .",
    "particles in other cells were then seen as a single particle in the cell baricenter , given the total mass of the particles inside the cell .",
    "the deflection angle diverges when the distance between a light ray and a particle is zero . to avoid this unwanted feature",
    "we introduce a softening parameter @xmath51 in eq:([eq : alpha ] ) ; the value @xmath51 is tuned on the resolution of the current simulation .",
    "we start to compute @xmath52 on a regular grid of 256@xmath49256 test rays that covered the central quarter of the lens plane , then we propagate a bundle of 2048@xmath492048 light rays and determine the deflection angle on each light ray by bicubic interpolation amongst the four nearest test rays ( see section [ sec : aa ] for further discussion on the effects of the adopted resolution in the lens mapping ) .",
    "the relation between images and sources position is given by the lens equation : @xmath53 and the local properties of the lens mapping are then described by the jacobian matrix of the lens equation , @xmath54 the shear components @xmath55 and @xmath56 are found from @xmath57 through the standard relations : @xmath58 , \\ ] ] @xmath59 , \\ ] ] and the magnifications factor @xmath60 is given by the jacobian determinant , @xmath61^{-1 } .\\ ] ]    finally , the jacobian determines the location of the critical curves @xmath62 on the lens plane , which are defined by @xmath63 . because of the finite grid resolution , we can only approximately locate them by looking for pairs of adjacent cells with opposite signs of @xmath64 .",
    "then , the lens equations @xmath65 yield the corresponding caustics @xmath66 , on the source plane .      for statistical purposes one has to distribute and map a large number of sources .",
    "we are interested in arc properties and arcs form near caustics ; so for numerical efficiency we have to distribute less sources in those part of the source plane that are far away from any caustics , and more sources close or inside the caustics .",
    "we follow the method introduced by miralda - escud ( 1993 ) and later adapted to non - analytical models by bartelmann & weiss ( 1994 ) . in the previous section",
    "we have obtained the deflection angles for the @xmath67 ( with i , j=1, ... ,2048 ) positions on the lens ( or image ) plane , using the lens equation ( [ eq : lens ] ) we can obtain the corresponding positions on the source plane @xmath68 , as usual we call this discrete transformation the _ mapping table_.    we model elliptical sources with axial ratios randomly drawn from the interval @xmath69 $ ] and area equal to that of a circle with radius @xmath70 .",
    "we first distribute sources on a coarse grid of 32x32 , defined in the central quarter of the source plane covered by the light rays traced ( due to convergence only a restricted part of the source plane can be reached by the light rays traced from the observer through the lens plane ) . from the mapping table",
    "we have obtained the magnification ( @xmath60 ) , if it changes by more than one ( absolute value ) between two sources , we place an additional source between both , in this way we increase the resolution by a factor 2 in each dimension . for",
    "the n - th iteration of source positions the criterium to add additional sources is that magnification changes by @xmath71 .",
    "we repeat this procedure four times to obtain the final list of source positions . to compensate for this artificial increase in the source number density",
    "we assign a statistical weight of @xmath72 to each image of a source placed during the @xmath73-th grid refinement . on average",
    "we have about 15000 sources for each lensing system .      to find the images of an extended source , all images - plane positions @xmath44 are checked if the corresponding entry in the map table @xmath74 lies within the source : i.e. for an elliptical source with axes @xmath75 and centered in @xmath76 it is checked if : @xmath77 where @xmath78 are the components of the vector @xmath74 .",
    "those points fulfilling the previous equation are part of one of the source images and are called image points .",
    "we then use a standard _ friends - of - friends _ algorithm to group together image points within connected regions , since they belong to the same image ( the number of images of one source ranges from 1 to 5 for our clusters ) .",
    "we measure arc properties using a method based on bartelmann & weiss ( 1994 ) .",
    "the arc area and magnification are found by summing the areas of the pixel falling into the image .",
    "arc lengths are estimated by first finding the arc center , then finding the arc pixel farest from the centroid as well as the pixel farest from this pixel .",
    "the arc length is then given by the sum of the lengths of the two lines connecting these three points .",
    "the arc width is defined as the ratio between the arc area and the arc length .    in figure",
    "[ fig : lw ] we plot the relation between length / width ratio and magnification ; we found a good agreement with previous results obtained by dalal et al .",
    "the scatter in this relation is due to local fluctuations in the surface mass density , highly distorted images are also highly magnified , but the converse is not always true .    before proceeding with our analysis",
    "we have performed some tests on the resolution adopted in our ray shooting code ; figure [ fig : res ] shows the fraction of sources ( number of sources divided by the total number ) vs. their length / width for different values of the resolution of the lens mapping grid @xmath79 ( results are for the  model with @xmath80 and @xmath81 ) .",
    "if the resolution of the lens mapping is not high enough the critical curves are too small compared to the source size and a spurious cut off in the number of arcs with @xmath82 appears .",
    "this cut off is totally artificial and it vanishes for @xmath83 . as figure [ fig : res ] shows the results are stable also for a higher value of @xmath84 ( 4096 ) , then in order to have a good compromise between resolution and computational time we have adopted @xmath85 in the following .",
    "in this paper we aim to compare the lensing properties of a given cluster as it appears in different cosmological models .",
    "there are three main features that affect the number of giant arcs : the concentration of the halo , the total number of lensing systems at a given redshift and the value of the critical surface mass density ( @xmath86 ) .    as predicted analytically by bartelmann",
    "et al ( 2002 ) ( for constant @xmath5 models ) and first noted in numerical nbody simulations by kmmb03 , and then confirmed by dolag et al ( 2003 ) and linder & jenkins ( 2003 ) , the concentration of dynamical de halos is greater than the concentration of   ones .",
    "here we use the same definition of concentration of kmmb03 : the ratio of the radius at the overdensity of the   model ( 103 times the critical density ) to the characteristic ( `` core '' ) radius of the nfw profile .",
    "( see however kmmb03 for more details ) . a greater concentration increases the probability of forming giant arcs . in figure",
    "[ fig : prof ] we report the density profile of the same halo simulated in different cosmological models .",
    "the rp@xmath17 halo is clearly denser and more concentrated than the   halo with the sugra halo laying in between ; the rp@xmath20 halo ( which is not shown in this plot ) has a concentration parameter close to the one of the   model .",
    "the expected number of objects with a mass exceeding @xmath87 ( in order to produce multiple images ) at a given redshift ( in this case @xmath88 ) can be estimated using a press & schechter formalism ( see mainini et al 2003a ) . in dynamical de , objects form earlier than in , so we have more lensing systems per mpc@xmath48 at @xmath89 .",
    "this can be taken into account by multiplying the number of arcs by 1.3 , 1.21 and 1.12 in rp@xmath17 , sugra and rp@xmath20 respectively .",
    "( in figure [ fig : mf ] we report the evolution with redshift of the mass function for a mass threshold of @xmath90 ) .",
    "the evolution of the scale factor @xmath29 with time also depends on the model .",
    "this implies that , at a given redshift @xmath91 , the angular diameter distance @xmath92 is model dependent ; in fact its value is given by : @xmath93 here @xmath39 is the speed of light , @xmath94 and @xmath95 are the present value of the hubble constant and the matter density parameter and @xmath96 gives the evolution of the de density parameter with the expansion factor . to compute @xmath96 for rp and sugra models",
    "we have used the analytical expression of mainini et al ( 2003b ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : sigma ] we show the value of the critical surface mass density for the adopted cosmological models .",
    "the different values for @xmath86 mean that a   halo yields more arcs than a dynamical de halo , if they have the same surface mass density .",
    "the effect of the different values of the angular diameter distance tends therefore to reduce the number of arcs in dynamical de models .",
    "the first result of our analysis is shown in figure [ fig : arcs ] , where we plot the fraction of sources ( number of sources divided by the total number ) vs. their length / width ratio for a cluster ( lens ) redshift @xmath80 , where lensing is most efficient for a source redshift of 1.0 ( as shown later in figure [ fig : arcsz ] ) .",
    "as expected , the rp@xmath17 model produces more distorted images , due to its more concentrated halos .",
    "the sugra and rp@xmath20 models are quite similar for @xmath97 and they lay in between rp@xmath17 and   which , as expected , produces less highly distorted images than the dynamical de models .",
    "we want to underline that part of the higher lensing signal due to the higher concentration of dark matter halos in such models is canceled by the increased @xmath86 value .",
    "this effect is clearly illustrated in figure [ fig : arcs2 ] where we have computed the arc statistics in a sugra model using the   critical surface density . as expected , we have obtained a result for sugra that is closer to the rp@xmath17 one .    as pointed out by many authors ( wambsganss et al .",
    "2003 , dalal et al .",
    "2003 ) the number of arcs that a cluster is able to produce is strongly related to the redshift of the sources ( although the strength of this effect is not yet completely understood , different authors found different results ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : cfr ] we plot the arc number counts for the   model for @xmath98 ( dashed line ) and @xmath99 ( solid line ) . as in previous work we found that the number of arcs increases if we increase the source redshifts .",
    "figure [ fig : arcs.2 ] shows the same results of figure [ fig : arcs ] but for @xmath99 .",
    "as expected , the total number of arcs increases in all cosmological models .",
    "again we have a sort of hierarchy of results according to what is expected from the dynamical evolution of dark matter halos in the corresponding cosmological model",
    ".    moreover , due to the lower difference in the value of @xmath86 for this sources redshift , the four models are better separated , expecially the sugra and rp@xmath20 ones .",
    "a difference between these two models is somewhat expected even if they have the same value of state parameter today ( @xmath100 ) , this arises from the different evolution of @xmath5 : in sugra it drastically changes with redshift ( @xmath101 at @xmath16 ) when it is more constant in rp@xmath20 ( @xmath102 at @xmath16 ) .    as final result in figure [ fig : arcsz ]",
    "we show the evolution with the lens redshift of the number of arcs for two different choices of the length / width ration : 10 and 7.5 ( the redshift of the sources is @xmath81 ) .",
    "on average the the rp@xmath17 model is always above the others , instead the different between sugra and   is more or less constant at all redshift and the lensing signal decreases rapidly for @xmath103 .",
    "the rp@xmath20 model has a sort of double behavior : it is close to   for @xmath104 but it is more similar to sugra for @xmath105 , we think that this bimodality is due again to the evolution of the state parameter in this model expecially if compared to the sugra one : the ration @xmath106 decreases with redshift towards unity at @xmath14 , so it is less different from   at high redshift in respect to sugra .",
    "the peaks in the lensing signal have slightly different positions in the different models . as argued by other authors ( torri et al 2004 , meneghetti et al .",
    "2005 ) this could be due to time offset between merger events in different dark energy cosmologies .",
    "models with dynamical de are in an infant state .",
    "we do not know the nature of de .",
    "thus , the state parameter @xmath107 is still uncertain . in view of this functional indetermination , at first sight",
    ", it could seem that the situation is hopeless .    in spite of that",
    ", we can outline some general trends that result from our analysis : in dynamical de models , halos tend to collapse earlier than in a   model with the same normalization at @xmath14 . as the result , halos are more concentrated and denser in their inner parts ( kmmb03 ) . starting from this finding",
    "we have explored the consequences of this higher concentration , on strong lensing properties of dark matter halos , in sugra and rp cosmologies .",
    "we found that rp@xmath17 halos ( obtained assuming the cluster abundance of the power spectrum and a value for the energy scale @xmath7 in the range suggested by the physics of fundamental interactions ) produce a higher number of arcs with a @xmath97 if compared to the standard   model .",
    "this model ( rp@xmath17 ) is marginal consistent with observations and its purpose is mainly to illustrate the principal effect of a dynamical dark energy component on arcs statistic .",
    "the second model we analyzed based on rp potential ( rp@xmath20 ) is more realistic from an observational point of view but less motivated by theoretical arguments .",
    "this model produce about 50% more arcs with @xmath97 than the   one for @xmath80 and @xmath98 but it is marginally distinguishable from   for lensing system at moderate high redshift ( @xmath108 , fig [ fig : arcsz ] ) or for high redshift sources / arcs ( @xmath80 and @xmath99 ) .",
    "the sugra model is always in between the   and the rp@xmath17 models and it produces about 70 - 80% more arcs than  .",
    "this difference is almost constant both changing the sources and the lens redshift and it tends to disappear for @xmath109 ( for @xmath81 ) where all the lensing systems considered in this paper ( @xmath110 ) are unable to produce highly distorted images ( except in the test model rp@xmath17 ) .",
    "we also noted that part of the stronger lensing signal due to the higher concentration of halos in dynamical de models is partially canceled by geometrical effects that increase the critical surface density in such models ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sigma ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : arcs2 ] ) .    as final remark",
    "we would like to stress that arc statistic is a powerful tool to investigate the nature of the dark energy .",
    "the forthcoming observational surveys(i.e . cfht legacy survey , sdss and others ) will improve the statistic of giant arcs on the sky ( for example the rcs-2 survey ( gladders et al .",
    "2003 ) will cover an area of 830 deg@xmath111 and is expected to produce 50 - 100 new arcs ) .",
    "such an observational material will provide a discrimination between de cosmologies possibly allowing to constrain the @xmath7 scale of the sugra and rp potentials .",

    "<S> we have 12 high resolution lensing systems for each cosmological model with a mass greater than @xmath1 . using a ray shooting technique </S>",
    "<S> we make a detailed analysis of the lensing properties of these clusters with particular attention to the number of arcs and their properties ( magnification , length and width ) . </S>",
    "<S> we found that the number of giant arcs produced by galaxy clusters changes in a considerable way from   models to dynamical dark energy models with a rp or sugra potentials . </S>",
    "<S> these differences originate from the different epochs of cluster formation and from the non - linearity of the strong lensing effect . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest the strong lensing is one of the best tool to discriminate among different kind of dark energy .    </S>",
