    "the h1 and zeus collaborations at the @xmath4 collider hera have published measurements of the structure function @xmath0 @xcite , which extend the range in @xmath1 and @xmath2 by two orders of magnitude as compared to previous fixed target experiments .",
    "a prominent rise of the structure function has been observed at small values of @xmath1 , which has stimulated a variety of theoretical investigations .",
    "the behaviour of the structure function @xmath0 for @xmath5 , with @xmath2 fixed , corresponds to the high - energy or regge limit for virtual photon - proton scattering .",
    "the computation of the high - energy behaviour of cross sections in qcd is an important and still unsolved problem .",
    "theoretical approaches to understand the regge limit are almost exclusively based on perturbation theory .",
    "the standard evolution equations predict a rise of the structure function @xmath6 at small @xmath1 .",
    "this holds for the double - asymptotic solution of the evolution equations at large @xmath2 and small @xmath1 @xcite , as well as for the solution of the bfkl equation @xcite which makes a prediction for the growth at small @xmath1 for fixed @xmath2 .",
    "one expects that the rise of cross sections at large energies is eventually damped by screening corrections @xcite leading to an asymptotic behaviour which , for proton - proton scattering , has to satisfy the froissart bound @xcite .    the starting point of this paper is the examination of the small-  regime of the hera data . for values of  below about @xmath7 all measurements are compatible with a double - logarithmic behaviour in  and .",
    "we then address the question whether the observed rise of the structure function @xmath6 at small @xmath1 is consistent with unitarity bounds .",
    "it is argued that a @xmath8 increase , if persistent to asymptotically small , may be compatible with constraints from unitarity . the double - logarithmic fit to the data is compared with the double - asymptotic form considered by ball and forte @xcite .",

    "fig : phsp ] .",
    "the measurements of both collaborations are compatible with each other .",
    "the 1994 data by the h1 collaboration @xcite are used for the fits , since at present they are the most precise ones , and they also allow the distinction between correlated and uncorrelated contributions to the systematic uncertainties .    the behaviour of the structure function  in the covered kinematical range is displayed in figs .",

    "the striking new feature of the hera data is the prominent rise at values of  below about 10@xmath10 .",

    "[ eq : acc ] the cut in  implies an effective cut of the high -data ( cf . fig .",

    "it is a remarkable property of the data that in this small-  regime they are well described by a polynomial linear in @xmath11 for every measured -value , @xmath12 possible higher order terms in @xmath11 are statistically not significant and are consequently not considered .",

    "the numerical value of @xmath17 reflects the available @xmath1-range for any given @xmath2 ( see fig .",

    "it is then possible to represent the whole body of data in the restricted phase space region , defined by ( [ eq : acc ] ) , for each measured -value by three numbers , v ( )  , u_0 ( ) u_0 ( )  , u_1 ( ) u_1 ( )  .",

    "hence , @xmath52 will always remain far below the froissart bound .",
    "one may hope to derive a stronger bound on the gluon density based on a complete evaluation of the perturbative cross section @xmath35 .",
    "already the integration over the rapidities of the two final state gluons yields another factor of @xmath53 .",
    "contributions with additional gluons in the final state yield further powers of @xmath54 which eventually build up the full bfkl ladder @xcite .",
    "it is conceivable that these perturbative corrections can be absorbed in a properly defined gluon density for which the bound ( [ gbound ] ) may then apply . a similar analysis",
    "could be carried out for deep - inelastic scattering where one has only one gluon in the initial state . in this way",
    "it may be possible to obtain a true bound on the structure function @xmath6 at small @xmath1 .",
    "this , however , is beyond the scope of our paper . in any case",
    ", it is clear that with a logarithmic growth of the gluon density the perturbative cross section can be extrapolated several orders of magnitude beyond present center - of - mass energies before it possibly reaches the froissart bound .",
    "one can readily evaluate the contribution of photon - gluon fusion to the structure function @xmath6 for a gluon density saturating the bound ( [ gbound ] ) .",

    "the gluon density is large , and the structure function is likely to be dominated by photon - gluon fusion . , with @xmath59 replaced by a small power @xmath60 has been performed in @xcite . ]",
    "( [ fusion ] ) relates the behaviour of @xmath6 at small @xmath1 to a constraint on the gluon density obtained from the total proton - proton cross section .",
    "our discussion has been based on a comparison of cross sections in perturbation theory to leading order , and the effect of higher order corrections is not clear .",
    "it is conceivable that , at fixed @xmath2 , @xmath0 continues to rise like @xmath8 down to asymptotically small values of @xmath1 .",
    "in fact , such a behaviour has been predicted by bjorken .",
    "his starting point is an expression for the photon wave function renormalization constant derived by gribov @xcite , 1-z_3 = 3ds  , where @xmath61 is the hadronic cross section in @xmath62-annihilation normalised to the @xmath42-pair cross section .",
    "based on the aligned - jet picture of deep inelastic scattering he then obtains for the inclusive structure function @xcite [ bjb ] f_2(x , q^2 )  |r  .",
    "this corresponds to a gluon density saturating the bound ( [ gbound ] ) . at present , however , we do not know whether eqs .",
    "( [ bjb ] ) or ( [ fusion ] ) represent the correct behaviour of @xmath0 at asymptotically small values of @xmath1 .",
    "there is neither a proof that such a behaviour will ever be reached nor can it be excluded that it might set in already at moderate values of @xmath1 .",
    "so far we have discussed the regge limit , i.e. @xmath29 with @xmath2 fixed . in this limit the double - logarithmic scaling form ( [ eq : hypo ] ) of the structure function  may be correct .",
    "however , in an appropriate simultaneous limit @xmath63 and @xmath29 ( see below ) , the double - logarithmic scaling form is expected to be incorrect . in this limit , for appropriate boundary conditions , the structure function is given by an asymptotic solution of the standard evolution equations @xcite , which was found more than 20 years ago @xcite , and which has recently been thoroughly studied by ball and forte @xcite .",
    "this solution is known to correspond to a summation of all terms of the form [ series ] ( _ s ) ^n  .",
    "hence , at small @xmath1 , it increases faster than any power of @xmath8 . the double - logarithmic form ( [ eq : hypo ] ) corresponds to the first term in this series .",
    "a comparison of these two expressions with data on @xmath6 therefore tests for the evidence of terms more singular than @xmath8 at small @xmath1 .",
    "the asymptotic solution is conveniently expressed in terms of the variables @xcite = ( ( _ s(q_0)_s(q)))^1/2,= ( /.)^1/2  , where @xmath64 is the two - loop qcd coupling , _ s(q)=4_0(1 - _ 1_0 ^ 2 )  . the first two coefficients of the @xmath65-function and other relevant parameters read @xcite @xmath66 at large values of @xmath67 the structure function @xmath6 can now be written as @xcite @xmath68 here @xmath43 is an unknown normalization constant . for large values of @xmath67 and",
    "@xmath69 the first exponential gives the dominant contribution , f_2(x , q^2 ) c  . in this limit",

    "it is known that a proper choice of these parameters yields a good description of the measured data on @xmath6 in the range of small @xmath1 and large @xmath2 @xcite . using the optimised values of @xcite , the constancy of the ratio between the data and the theoretical prediction ( [ f2bf ] ) is clearly borne out in fig .

    "( [ f2bf ] ) has been used for the number of flavours @xmath73 .",

    "( [ series ] ) .",
