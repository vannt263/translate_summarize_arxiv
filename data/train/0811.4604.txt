    "plasma equilibria are suitable starting points for investigations of , for example , plasma instabilities and plasma waves . for collisionless plasmas ,",
    "the relevant equilibria are self - consistent solutions of the stationary vlasov - maxwell ( vm ) equations ( see e.g. refs . ) .    in the present paper",
    "we focus exclusively on non - relativistic one - dimensional quasi - neutral vm equilibria with translational symmetry , with the distribution functions depending only on the hamiltonian and the two canonical momenta corresponding to the invariant directions ( in this paper chosen to be the @xmath0- and @xmath1-directions ) .",
    "a large amount of work on translationally invariant 1d vm equilibria of this kind has been done before ( e.g. refs . ) , especially on one - dimensional current sheets and plasma boundary layers , which are of fundamental importance for the structure and stability of plasmas as many plasma activity processes , e.g. magnetic reconnection,@xcite happen there preferentially .    in the present paper it is not our aim to add to the plethora of 1d vm solutions existing already , but to use some generic properties of the 1d vm equilibrium problem to investigate the conditions for the existence of force - free 1d vm equilibria ( see e.g. ref . ) .",
    "an obvious property of 1d vm equilibria is that the structure needs to be in force balance . in the quasi - neutral case",
    "this means that the sum of the magnetic pressure and one of the diagonal components of the pressure tensor has to be constant .",
    "the relevant component of the pressure tensor is the one for the single spatial coordinate upon which the equilibria depend . in this paper",
    "we will choose this coordinate to be @xmath2 , so the component of the pressure tensor in the force balance equation will be @xmath3 . in a number of papers it has also been noticed that the translationally invariant 1d vm problem is equivalent to the motion of a pseudo - particle in a conservative pseudo - potential and/or that the force balance for the 1d vm structure is equivalent to pseudo - energy conservation ( see e.g. refs . ; the pseudo - particle analogy has also recently been used for mhd equilibria in ref . ) .",
    "directly connected to the pseudo - particle analogy and the related pseudo - energy conservation law ( equivalent to force balance of the 1d vm equilbrium ) is the special role played by @xmath3 . as was first noticed by grad@xcite for the case of vanishing electric potential and only one non - vanishing magnetic field and vector potential component , but otherwise arbitrary distribution functions , the derivative of @xmath3 with respect to the non - vanishing component of the vector potential equals ( modulo constants ) the current density .",
    "this was generalized by bertotti@xcite who included a non - vanishing electric potential and showed that the partial derivative of @xmath3 with respect to the electric potential is proportional to the charge density ( see also refs . for the same conclusion for 2d vm equilibria ) . lerche@xcite then generalized this to equilibria with two magnetic field , vector potential and current density components , but for a restricted class of distribution functions .",
    "channell@xcite investigated the case of vanishing electric potential and a special class of distribution functions for which he showed that the two components of the current density are , again modulo constant factors , given by the partial derivatives of the particle density with respect to the components of the vector potential .",
    "if investigated carefully one can see that the full expressions including the constant factors are again the partial derivatives of @xmath3 with respect to the components of the vector potential . using the force balance condition ,",
    "mynick et al.@xcite then showed that , independently of the distribution function , the partial derivatives of @xmath3 with respect to the electric potential and the two components of the vector potential are always proportional to the charge density and the components of the current density , respectively .",
    "they also showed that this property is maintained under the assumption of quasi - neutrality .",
    "the authors then use this property to construct 1d vm equilibria with certain defined properties .",
    "the special role of @xmath3 in the context of 1d vm equilibria has also been emphasized by attico and pegoraro@xcite , again for the case of vanishing electric potential .",
    "similarly to channell@xcite , they used this property to construct a number of special distribution functions for 1d vm equilibria .",
    "more recently , mottez@xcite gave a detailed discussion of the role of the full pressure tensor ( not just of one component ) for distribution functions of the same type as discussed by channell@xcite , but including the case of non - vanishing electric potential .",
    "the properties of @xmath3 make it a very useful quantity to start any investigation of 1d vm equilibria , since all other quantities such as particle density , charge density and current density can be derived by differentiation .",
    "@xmath3 is also equivalent to the pseudo - potential of the analogous pseudo - particle problem and can thus be used to study the properties of 1d vm equilibria qualitatively without the need to solve the equilibrium differential equations . in particular , the pseudo - particle analogy can be used to formulate conditions on @xmath3 that it has to satisfy to allow the existence of 1d force - free vm equilibria.@xcite so far only linear force - free 1d vm equilibria are known@xcite and the pseudo - particle analogy can also give some insight into the types of distribution functions permitting a linear force - free solution .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in sect . [",

    "we will , however , not consider this possibility here .    to calculate 1d vm equilibria we have to solve the remaining inhomogeneous steady - state maxwell equations , @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",

    "one motivation for looking for nonlinear force - free 1d vm equilibria is the fact that it is current practice to use pressure balanced vm equilibria with a guide field , mostly the harris sheet@xcite , to mimic force - free vm equilibria in , for example , particle - in - cell simulations of magnetic reconnection ( see e.g. refs . ) .",
