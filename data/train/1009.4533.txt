    "agn feedback on the interstellar and intracluster media ( ism and icm ) is thought to be an important factor regulating gas accretion , star formation , and agn activity in galaxies @xcite .",
    "this may occur through either a sub - relativistic wind in radio - quiet quasars or a relativistic radio jet in the case of radio - loud quasars and radio galaxies . in the latter case ,",
    "the kinetic energy of the jet integrated over its lifetime is typically more than enough to unbind the ism of even the most massive galaxy . while much effort has been devoted to simulating the impact of jets on the hot icm ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , less is known about the jet - ism interaction .",
    "recent simulations have shown that a radio jet may couple strongly to an inhomogeneous , clumpy ism until the radio lobes break free into intergalactic space @xcite . in this process",
    ", the jet drives radiative shocks into dense clumps but does not ablate them , while less dense gas may be ablated and advected to larger radii . while such detailed simulations have been made of the impact of jets on the atomic and ionized components of the ism , the impact on the molecular gas phase has not been considered in any detail .",
    "@xcite found that the mid - ir spectrum of radio galaxy 3c 326 n displays high - luminosity h@xmath0 emission , coupled with weak pah emission indicative of a low star formation rate .",
    "we presented evidence that 3c 326 n belongs to an interacting galaxy pair and suggested that the copious warm h@xmath0 is heated by accretion from the companion 3c 326 s. further investigation revealed the presence of fast neutral gas outflow , possibly driven by the radio jet @xcite .",
    "therefore , a strong interaction between the radio jet and molecular gas , rather than accretion , may power the h@xmath0 emission .",
    "h@xmath0 emission may prove to be a key in understanding how radio jet feedback impacts the molecular gas phase and thereby suppresses star formation in massive galaxies .",

    "we tried both regular and optimal extraction within these regions @xcite , and selected the extraction with higher signal - to - noise for further analysis . for unresolved sources ,",
    "the continuum and emission line fluxes from regular and optimal extractions are in agreement .",
    "the flux uncertainties produced by the _ spitzer _",
    "pipeline are known to be too large for faint sources .",
    "the pipeline ( versions s18.7 and earlier ) does not properly adjust the uncertainties for droop , a systematic , additive effect which is proportional to the total photocurrent incident upon the detector .",
    "we divided flux uncertainties for each spectral order by a constant factor of 0.3 - 2.1 , to better reflect the observed noise characteristics .",
    "the uncertainty scale factor for each order was determined from the ratio of the mean pipeline uncertainties to the observed noise in emission line - free regions .",
    "spectral orders with low flux were adjusted upwards by factors of 1.0 - 2.0 to correct for interorder slit loss differences . such differences may arise from pointing inaccuracies , even for unresolved sources .",
    "the differences in slit widths and wavelength - dependent extraction apertures may also lead to mismatches in continuum or line flux between orders for spatially resolved sources .",
    "our spectral order matching will properly correct for this effect in the case that the extended continuum and line emission are cospatial and have similar spectra , such as might be the case for extended star - forming regions .",
    "however , the emission line equivalent widths and line flux ratios between orders could be off by as much as the interorder correction factor ( @xmath22 ) in the case of extended nebular or h@xmath0 emission . this should not be an issue for any galaxies except per a , 3c 293 , and cen a , the only ones where the emission lines and pah features appear to be spatially extended along the spectrograph slits .",
    "for all other sources , the mid - ir ( mir ) emission ( including the h@xmath0 emission ) is unresolved and resides within the central 2 - 40 kpc of the host galaxies .",
    "we measured the emission line and pah features of all galaxies in a systematic way using the spectral fitting tool pahfit @xcite .",
    "the continuum is modeled with a sum of starlight and thermal ( blackbody ) emission components , absorbed by a uniform dust screen .",
    "this is intended only as an empirical description of the continuum , not a physical model .",

    "the unresolved h@xmath0 and forbidden atomic emission lines are fit by gaussian profiles .",
    "emission line and pah fluxes from the galaxies are presented in tables 4 - 8 .",
    "we also measured narrow - band 24 @xmath5 m fluxes ( 3.7@xmath23-clipped average over 22.5 - 25.5 @xmath5 m rest ; tables 1 - 2 ) from the irs spectra and used them to estimate mid - ir continuum luminosities ( table 9 ) .    in principle , the continuum for each source should be fit with a dust radiative transfer model , but this is outside the scope of the present work .",
    "instead , we tailored the continuum model in two cases where the simple multi - temperature black body plus screen extinction model did not work . for perseus a , we added silicate emission features to the continuum .",
    "we introduced the capability to fit optically thin silicate emission features with pahfit , computing the silicate emission as blackbody emission multiplied by an empirical dust extinction curve . in the cygnus a spectrum , 18 @xmath5 m silicate",
    "absorption is unusually weak or absent relative to the 9 @xmath5 m silicate absorption , perhaps because of radiative transfer effects .",
    "therefore we removed the 18 @xmath5 m silicate absorption feature from the @xcite galactic center extinction curve in order to model the absorption .      in order to test the possibility of h@xmath0 heating by x - rays from agn , we compiled unabsorbed 2 - 10 kev nuclear x - ray luminosities measured by _",

    "few periods of high background were found in any observation , and so we used almost all available data in our analysis .",
    "we extracted the nuclear spectra for each source from a small circle ( typically of radius 5 pixels or 2.5@xmath24 ) , and sampled background from an adjacent region free from point sources . in most cases , the point - like emission from the nucleus was easily separated from any extended emission components , though there may be significant contamination from the surrounding hot cluster gas in the case of the zw3146 bcg .",
    "we do not consider the possibility of h@xmath0 heating by x - ray emission from the extended intracluster medium or x - ray emission from the extended radio source .",
    "we adopted the standard x - ray spectral models for radio - loud agn described by evans et al .",
    "( 2006 ) to fit each spectrum .",
    "in the case of narrow - line radio galaxies ( nlrgs ) , the canonical model takes the form of the combination of a heavily absorbed power law and a soft , unabsorbed power law that @xcite interpreted to originate at the base of an unresolved jet . in table 10",
    "we present an observation log and summarize the best - fitting models for each source .",
    "we detect two or more h@xmath0 emission lines from 17/55 ( 31% ) of the radio galaxies in our sample ( table 4 ) .",
    "we require @xmath25 detection of 2 lines at the systemic redshift .",
    "a typical @xmath26 h@xmath0 s(1 ) detection limit for the sample is @xmath27 erg s@xmath3 @xmath28 ( @xmath29 w m@xmath30 ) , but this may vary with redshift and h@xmath0 line contrast relative to the continuum .",
    "h@xmath0 line and pah fluxes for galaxies with only one or no h@xmath0 lines detected are presented in table 6 .",
    "upper limits to their h@xmath0 luminosities are estimated as @xmath31[h@xmath0 0 - 0 s(1)+ s(3 ) ] , where the correction factor 1.6 accounts for the s(0 ) + s(2 ) line flux and is the mean value of [ h@xmath0 s(0 ) + s(1 ) + s(2 ) + s(3)]/[h@xmath0 s(1 ) + s(3 ) ] for galaxies where all 4 lines were detected .",
    "we use this rather than the sum of 4 upper limits for s(1 ) through s(4 ) , which would be an overestimate .",
    "the _ spitzer _ irs spectra of the h@xmath0 detections are presented in figures 1 - 7 , along with archival hst optical images for most sources .",

    "the mid - ir luminous radio galaxies per a , cyg a , 3c 433 , and 3c 436 , which contain dust - obscured quasars , are presented in figure 4 .",
    "the h@xmath0 emission is difficult to see on top of the continuum emission from the galactic nuclei in some spectra .",
    "however , subtraction of a continuum model clearly reveals the h@xmath0 , pah , and other emission lines ( per a , cyg a , and cen a figs .",
    "in order to compute the mass of warm molecular gas , it is first necessary to know the h@xmath0 excitation mechanism .",
    "the low critical densities ( h@xmath0-h@xmath0 @xmath32 cm @xmath33 at @xmath34 k ) of the h@xmath0 0 - 0 s(0 ) and s(1 ) emission lines @xcite ensure that their upper levels will be collisionally excited in almost any environment where warm h@xmath0 is found .",
    "nonthermal excitation by uv photons or cosmic - ray secondary electrons @xcite may contribute to the higher rotational and ro - vibrational levels , but are inefficient at exciting the lower pure - rotational levels .",
    "therefore the lowest h@xmath0 energy levels , which dominate the warm h@xmath0 mass budget , must be in thermal equilibrium .",
    "assuming thermal equilibrium in gas at a single temperature @xmath35 , the h@xmath0 luminosity is determined by the h@xmath0 mass @xmath36 and @xmath35 according to    @xmath37    where the mean luminosity of a single h@xmath0 molecule , summed over all transitions @xmath38 is    @xmath39    the occupation number @xmath40 of each level is determined by the boltzmann factor and partition function . for example , a molecular gas mass of @xmath41 and a temperature of 200 k gives    @xmath42 erg s@xmath3 @xmath43    for multiple temperature components , the luminosity of each component can be computed separately .",
    "for all radio galaxies with two or more h@xmath0 emission lines detected , we construct excitation diagrams to determine the temperature distribution and mass of h@xmath0 .",
    "for the limiting case of an h@xmath0 source size of 37 @xmath44 37 uniformly filling the width of the sl slit , we plot the column density of the upper level divided by the statistical weight for each transition ( figs . 8 - 10 ) .",
    "we simultaneously fit the data with 3 temperature components ( table 11 ) , the minimum number necessary to fit the emission line fluxes and parameterize what is likely a continuous temperature distribution .",
    "we quote @xmath45 single parameter uncertainties for the h@xmath0 temperatures and masses .",
    "upper limits are included in the fits as 2@xmath23 detections with 1@xmath23 errorbars .",
    "this allows us to give conservative upper limits for the lowest temperature component for sources where the s(0 ) line is not detected , without affecting much the other components .",
    "note that the lowest temperature component , which is constrained by the s(0 ) and s(1 ) lines dominates the total h@xmath0 mass .",
    "we give an upper limit for the warmest temperature component mass in 3c 338 , where the s(6 ) and s(7 ) lines are not detected .",
    "we assume that the h@xmath0 level populations and ratios of ortho / para h@xmath0 are in local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) and adjust the statistical weights of the ortho transitions iteratively to obtain a self - consistent fit . there is no evidence for non - equilibrium ortho / para ratios , which would manifest as suppressed or enhanced emission from odd-@xmath46 relative to even-@xmath46 transitions .",
    "the ortho / para ratios may depend upon the detailed thermal history of the gas , and can take much longer than the gas cooling time ( @xmath47 yr ) to reach their equilibrium values @xcite .",
    "however , for the warm ( @xmath34 k ) h@xmath0 observed by _ spitzer _",
    ", the equilibrium ortho / para ratio takes on a narrow range of values ( 1.6 - 3.0 ) such that the equilibrium assumption has only minor consequences for our model fits .",
    "for example , assuming an ortho / para ratio of 3.0 rather than 2.1 decreases the temperature of the coolest h@xmath0 component in 3c 326 from 110 to 100 k , and raises the mass by only @xmath48 to @xmath49 .    to determine the sensitivity of our model fits to the number of temperature components , we tried both 2-component and 3-component fits to all of the lines in the 3c 326 n excitation diagram .",
    "the 2-component fit gives a mass of @xmath50 at 140 k ( @xmath51 ) , compared to @xmath52 at 110 k ( @xmath53 ) for the 3-component fit .",
    "the 3-component fit has much smaller residuals and is clearly better .",
    "the additonal temperature component increases the estimated h@xmath0 mass by a factor of 2.5 in this case . which lines are detected and used in the fit can also change the estimated h@xmath0 mass . if we throw out the s(5 ) , s(6 ) , and s(7 ) lines and refit the 2 component model , we find @xmath54 at 120 k ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "we measure radio galaxy warm h@xmath0 masses from @xmath56 up to an amazing @xmath4 , the bulk at temperatures of 100 - 200 k ( tables 11 and 12 ) .",
    "such large h@xmath0 masses imply the wholesale heating of an entire galaxy s worth of molecular gas in some cases .",
    "smaller masses ( @xmath57 ) of warmer h@xmath0 at 200 - 1500 k are also found in all galaxies where h@xmath0 is detected .",
    "comparable luminosity is emitted by each temperature component in a given galaxy , though most of the mass resides in the coolest component ( table 11 ) . in all cases where there are several high - level lines detected , the h@xmath0 temperature increases with upper - level excitation temperature .",
    "this produces the characteristic curves in figures 8 - 10 , which have less negative slopes at higher energies .",
    "this behavior is also seen in the excitation diagram for the perseus a filaments @xcite .",
    "this is expected for any astrophysical situation where there is a range of temperatures and densities present @xcite .",
    "the total warm h@xmath0 column densities and column density lower limits range from @xmath58 @xmath28 ( @xmath59 pc@xmath30 ) .",
    "only lower limits can be inferred for spatially unresolved h@xmath0 emission .",

    "the mass of cold ( @xmath60 k ) h@xmath0 estimated assuming the standard galactic co to h@xmath0 conversion factor of 4.6 @xmath61(k km s@xmath3 pc@xmath62 ) ranges from @xmath63 .",
    "however , we caution that the applicability of the galactic conversion factor to the extreme conditions in radio mohegs has not been established .",
    "this caveat notwithstanding , the inferred ratio of warm ( @xmath34 k ) to cold h@xmath0 in these galaxies ranges from @xmath64 - 2.1 .",
    "the galaxies 3c 218 , 272.1 , 326 , 424 , and 433 are particularly remarkable in having warm / cold h@xmath0 ratios of @xmath65 .",
    "a large fraction of the h@xmath0 in these galaxies is disturbed and heated to temperatures @xmath66 k.",
    "the formation and shielding of h@xmath0 requires the presence of dust , which may reveal itself through ir continuum and pah emission features @xcite .",
    "however , there must be a sufficient uv radiation field to heat the very small dust grains ( vsgs ) and excite the pah stretching or bending modes in order to observe mid - ir dust signatures .",
    "a uv photon field may be sustained by 1 ) star formation , 2 ) agn emission , or 3 ) thermal bremsstrahlung and line emission from radiative shocks @xcite .",
    "it must be kept in mind that the h@xmath0 , vsg , and pah emission regions are spatially unresolved and may or may not be coincident . also , different types of sources can contribute in different ratios to each of these spectral features .",
    "first we consider the ratio of h@xmath0 to 24 @xmath5 m dust emission ( fig .",
    "11 ) for star - forming galaxies @xcite . there is a trend ( with large scatter ) for @xmath6(h@xmath0)/@xmath67 to decrease with @xmath67 .",

    "it is debated whether this latter trend is intrinsic to star - forming regions or whether it reflects an increasing agn contribution to the continuum at higher luminosity . in either case , the tendency of h@xmath0 and pah emission to decrease together relative to @xmath68 may suggest that they are both powered by star formation in starbursts and ulirgs . on the other hand",

    "it will be important to test the latter possibility with additional _ chandra _ observations .",
    "several of the radio mohegs that reside in x - ray bright clusters show evidence that the radio lobes have displaced the intracluster medium ( icm ) in x - ray cavities . for these sources ,",
    "it is possible to estimate the @xmath138 energy required to excavate the cavities , and divide by the buoyancy time scale to estimate the average jet power deposited into the icm @xcite .",
    "these jet cavity powers fall in the range @xmath139 erg s@xmath3 and the ratio of h@xmath0 luminosity to jet cavity power falls in the range @xmath140 ( table 14 ) .",
    "this demonstrates that the jet power is more than sufficient to produce the observed h@xmath0 luminosity , modulo an unknown conversion efficiency .",
    "one potential difficulty is efficiently coupling the jet power to the host galaxy ism after the radio lobes have broken out of the host galaxy and are doing most of their work on the intergalactic medium .",
    "@xcite argued that only @xmath141 of the radio jet power in 3c 326 could be dissipated in the host galaxy ism , based on the small ratio of radio core to mpc - scale radio lobe flux .",
    "this in turn could only power @xmath142 of the observed h@xmath0 luminosity , for an estimated jet kinetic luminosity of @xmath143 erg s@xmath3 .",
    "given the uncertainties in estimating jet kinetic luminosity and time variability , the inner radio jet could easily be ten times more powerful than this estimate .",
    "in addition , the radio core power is probably not a reliable tracer of jet kinetic power dissipation and may be strongly affected by doppler boosting or de - boosting , as indicated by the large scatter in figure 18b . turning this problem around , the large h@xmath0 luminosity from the center of 3c 326 n may indicate that a significant fraction of the radio jet power is dissipated inside the host galaxy , even though the radio lobes have long since escaped .    on the other hand , the compact symmetric radio lobes in the radio moheg 3c 293",
    "@xcite appear to be directly interacting with the host ism .",
    "it will be important to measure the pressure in the hot interstellar medium with _",

    "high - velocity neutral and ionized outflows have been observed in the radio moheg 3c 293 , and there is morphological and kinematic evidence that these outflows are driven by the radio jet @xcite .",
    "similar h i and ionized outflows have been found in several other low - redshift compact and extended radio sources @xcite , with outflow speeds of up to 2000 km s@xmath3 and mass - loss rates of up to 50 @xmath144 yr@xmath3 indicating a strong interaction between the radio jet and the host galaxy ism .",
    "@xcite recently discovered a high velocity ( @xmath145 km s@xmath3 ) neutral ( na i ) outflow in 3c 326 , the most extreme radio moheg .",
    "even more spectacular jet driven ionized outflows , which may be responsible for ejecting a large fraction of the host galaxy ism , are observed in high - redshift radio galaxies @xcite .",
    "the connection between jet driven outflows and h@xmath0 emission in radio mohegs is studied in detail by @xcite . since the molecular hydrogen must have high density and a low volume filling factor , it is likely that the cocoon of hot , shocked ism surrounding the jet @xcite serves as an intermediary between the jet and the h@xmath0 .",
    "the radio jet heats the diffuse ism , which expands in a hot fast wind and drives shocks into ambient or entrained molecular clouds , powering the observed warm h@xmath0 emission . for h@xmath0 at densities of @xmath83-@xmath146 cm@xmath33 , the observed range of temperatures",
    "is characteristic of 5 - 20 km s@xmath3 shock velocities @xcite .",
    "the relative velocity and shear between the molecular clouds and hot wind may ultimately power the h@xmath0 emission through turbulent mixing layers @xcite .",
    "the hydrodynamical stability of the h@xmath0 emitting clouds needs to be investigated , as they may be ablated by the hot wind and may eventually dissolve completely .",
    "however , there is evidence that the atomic and h@xmath0 filaments in per a are held together by strong magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "moreover , the fact that h@xmath0 is the primary coolant only in magnetic ( c - type ) shocks strongly suggests that the magnetic field plays an important role in mohegs .",
    "another potentially important source of heating for warm h@xmath0 in radio mohegs may be ionizing particles in the form of relativistic particles from the radio lobes .",
    "@xcite have proposed cosmic rays or thermal particles from the surrounding hot gas as the dominant heat source powering the warm h@xmath0 emission filaments in the perseus a ( 3c 84 ) cool core cluster .",
    "an enhanced cosmic ray density has also been proposed to account for the high temperature of molecular clouds in the milky way nuclear disk @xcite .",
    "we discuss this possibility for h@xmath0 luminous radio galaxies .",

    "the line emission is cooling the gas and must be balanced by gas heating . in our radio moheg sample ,",
    "the mean of total line emission per warm h@xmath0 molecule ( in the lowest temperature component , table 11 ) is observed to be @xmath149 .",
    "the molecular gas heating by cosmic rays is 4  ev per ionization in the meudon gas code @xcite . in cloudy",
    ", the heating efficiency increases with the gas ionization fraction ; the heating per ionization is 7  ev for a ionization fraction of @xmath150 characteristic of the diffuse interstellar medium where carbon is ionized @xcite .",
    "the h@xmath0 line cooling is balanced by cosmic ray heating for an ionization rate per hydrogen @xmath151 , a value @xmath152 times higher than the standard galactic rate @xcite .",
    "for such a value , cosmic rays are the main destruction path of h@xmath0 molecules and the molecular gas fraction depends on the ionization rate to gas density ratio @xmath153 .",
    "model calculations presented by @xcite show that for @xmath151 the gas is molecular for @xmath154 cm@xmath33 ( see their figure 2 ) .",
    "note that for such high densities h@xmath0 rotational states are thermalized up to @xmath155 , and the higher j lines up to at least s(3 ) are also cooling lines .",
    "combining the lower limit on the gas density and the warm h@xmath0 temperature ( @xmath156k ) inferred from the s(1 ) to s(0 ) line ratio we get a warm molecular gas pressure @xmath157 which is a factor 1400 higher than the mean cosmic ray pressure of @xmath158 in the milky way disk @xcite . for a cosmic ray energy density",
    "@xmath152 times the galactic mean value , the cosmic ray pressure would be 25 times larger than the thermal gas pressure ( assuming that the cosmic ray pressure scales linearly with the ionization rate ) .",
    "such a large difference in pressure would seem unsustainable , however it could in principle be supported by magnetic pressure in the compressed magnetic field within molecular clouds @xcite .",
    "therefore , heating by cosmic rays from the radio lobes or hot gas in the radio jet cocoon may present an alternative or additional pathway to heat h@xmath0 by radio - jet feedback .",
    "an important unanswered question is the origin of large quantities of molecular gas in radio mohegs .",
    "copious amounts ( @xmath159 ) of cold molecular gas discovered in @xmath160 of bcgs in x - ray selected cool - core clusters @xcite may be deposited by cooling flows .",
    "h@xmath0 emission from warm molecular gas also appears to be common in cool - core bcgs @xcite . since a large fraction of these bcgs host radio sources , the h@xmath0 emission",
    "could potentially be excited by radio jet feedback .",
    "the gas cooling rates in the radio mohegs that reside in cool core clusters are @xmath161 yr@xmath3 @xcite , enough to supply the observed molecular gas masses in @xmath162 gyr .",
    "gas - rich galaxy collisions or tidal interactions with nearby galaxies may drive gas into the center of radio galaxies in less rich environments @xcite .",
    "this is an attractive possibility , considering that most radio mohegs are mergers or have nearby companions , and several display prominent tidal distortions . in comparison ,",
    "most field elliptical galaxies and 3c radio galaxies in the nearby universe are poor in molecular gas ( @xmath163 , * ? ? ?",

    "galaxy collision driven inflows and jet induced outflows may constitute another , intermittent type of agn feedback loop ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "while cooling flows or galaxy collisions may deliver the molecular gas in radio mohegs , it seems unlikely that gas accretion or galaxy collisions contribute significantly to heating the h@xmath0 . unlike the galaxy - collision powered h@xmath0 emission from stephan s quintet @xcite , the bulk of the h@xmath0 emission",
    "is concentrated inside the central @xmath164 kpc of radio galaxies .",

    "large h@xmath0/pah ratios indicate that the h@xmath0 emission from mohegs is most likely powered by shocks .",
    "we can not completely rule out a contribution from cosmic ray heating , though it would require cosmic ray pressures that exceed the gas pressure by a large factor .",
