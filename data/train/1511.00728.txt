    "it is now widely accepted that the cmd of nearly all the old galactic gcs ( ggcs ) is made of multiple sequences that can be identified along the entire diagram , from the bottom of the ms up to the sub - giant branch ( sgb ) , the red - giant branch ( rgb ) and even the horizontal branch and the asymptotic giant branch ( e.g.milone et al.2012 ; piotto et al.2015 ) .",
    "the multiple sequences correspond to distinct stellar populations with different helium and light - element abundance and their presence has suggested that gcs have experienced a complex star - formation history .",
    "the discovery of either multimodal or extended ms turn - off ( hereafter emsto ) in several intermediate - age star clusters in both mcs ( e.g.bertelli et al.2003 ; mackey & broby nielsen2007 ; glatt et al.2008 ) has suggested that multiple stellar populations could not be a peculiarity of old ggcs . in our survey of mc star clusters",
    ", we have shown that the the emsto is a common feature among @xmath01 - 2-gyr old star clusters and has been detected in at least the 70% of the analyzed objects ( milone et al.2009 ) .",
    "an example of typical cmd of an intermediate - age star cluster is provided in fig .",
    "[ fig : cmd]a , where i have plotted @xmath1 vs.@xmath2 for ngc411 in the smc . as mentioned above",
    ", the most striking feature is the msto , which is widely broadened in color and magnitude . despite some authors",
    "have initially claimed that the emsto is due to photometric errors ( see e.g.mucciarelli et al.2007 for the case of ngc1783 ) , the fact that the other cmd sequences , like the rgb and the lower ms are narrow and well defined , clearly demonstrates that the broadened msto is intrinsic and is not due neither to differential reddening nor to photometric errors .    the distribution of stars along the msto changes from one cluster to another .",
    "some emsto clusters , like ngc411 , exhibit a continuous distribution ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : cmd]b1-b3 ) . in other clusters",
    "there are two main mstos , with the faint msto hosting approximately 30 - 40% of the total number of msto stars ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : cmd]c1-c3 for the case of ngc2173 ) .",
    "another intriguing feature is the rc , which can be either broadened or bimodal ( girardi et al.2009 ) as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : cmd]a for ngc411 .",
    "the dual rc has been interpreted as due to two stellar groups : one of them consisting of massive stars , which avoid e@xmath3 degeneracy settling in their h - exhausted cores when he ignites .",
    "the other group is made of slightly less - massive stars which experience e@xmath3 degeneracy before he ignition .",
    "this phenomenon is thought to be responsible for the higher brightness of the less - massive stars ( girardi et al.2009 , 2013 ) .",

    "the inset is a zoom of the @xmath4 vs.@xmath5 around the rc .",
    "panels b1 and c1 show the @xmath1 vs.@xmath2 cmd for stars around the msto in ngc411 and ngc2173 , respectively .",
    "the verticalized color and magnitude distribution for the msto stars between the two gray lines of panels a1 and b1 are plotted in panels a2 and b2 , while panels a3 and b3 show the histograms of the @xmath6x distribution along the direction , x , of the gray lines for these stars .",
    "the gray lines overimposed on each histogram are the corresponding kernel - density distributions.,width=432 ]      as discussed in the previous section , most ggcs host two or more stellar populations with different chemical composition .",
    "one of them has the same c , n , o , and he abundance as halo - field stars with the same metallicity , while the other population(s ) is enhanced in helium and nitrogen and depleted in carbon and oxygen ( see gratton et al.2012 ; piotto et al.2015 and references therein ) . as a consequence of such a specific chemical pattern ,",
    "most ggcs exhibit either broadened or multiple rgbs , when observed in appropriate cmds involving the u band ( like @xmath7 vs. @xmath8 , marino et al.2008 ) .",
    "recent papers , based on spectroscopy and _ hst _ photometry , have shown that n / he - rich stars of ggcs have larger @xmath9 color than n / he - poor stars with the same luminosity , but smaller @xmath10 color .",
    "the @xmath11(@xmath9)@xmath12(@xmath10 ) index introduced by milone et al.(2013a ) thus maximizes the virtues of both @xmath9 and @xmath10 , and is a powerful tool to identify multiple mss and rgbs .    as an example , the left panel of fig .",

    "ngc6352 hosts two distinct stellar populations with different he , c , n , na , and o , that populate the two distinct sequences detected along the entire cmd by piotto et al.(2015 ) and nardiello et al.(2015 ) .",

    "the rgb width in the @xmath14-index , is consistent with the broadening expected from photometric errors , thus demonstrating that star - to - star variations in light - elements and helium , if present , are small and can not be detected from ultraviolet photometry of rgb stars .",
    "this finding , corroborates the conclusion by mucciarelli et al.(2014 ) who have analyzed spectra of eight bright red giants in the emsto cluster ngc1806 and found homogeneous na and o content .",

    "several authors have interpreted the emsto of intermediate - age mc clusters as due to a prolonged period of star formation with a duration of @xmath0100 - 500 ( see goudfrooij et al.2014 and references therein ) . an alternative interpretation has been provided by bastian & de mink ( 2009 ) who have noticed that rotation significantly affects the stellar structure and the inclination angle between the observer and the star changes the effective temperature . they have thus suggested that a range of stellar rotation in msto stars can mimic an emsto in a cluster where a simple stellar population exists .",
    "unfortunately , as discussed by yang et al.(2013 ) the evolution of rotating stars is strongly dependent on the stellar model and the emsto can be explained or not depending on the adopted models . as a further interpretation of the cmd of intermediate - age mc clusters , interacting binaries with mass transfer and merged binary systems",
    "have been also considered as possible responsible for the emsto ( yang et al.2011 ) .",
    "a lot of effort has been done by several groups to discriminate among the different scenarios .",

    "i refer to papers by goudfrooij et al.(2015 ) , li et al.(2014 ) , bastian et al.(2015 ) niederhofer et al.(2015 ) and references therein for critical discussion about age spread and rotation as responsible of the emsto .",
    "new insight on the emsto phenomenon comes from young clusters . in this context",
    "the @xmath0150-myr old ngc1844 in the lmc is exemplary . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ngc1844 ] the upper ms of this cluster is widely spread in @xmath2 color , with some hints of ms split ( milone et al.2013b ) .",

    "unfortunately , the interpretation of the cmd of ngc1844 is still controversial . the comparison of the observations with basti isochrones ( pietrinferni et al.2004 ) with the same metallicity but different ages reveals that age difference alone can not be responsible for the broadened ms of ngc1844 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ngc1844]b ) .",
    "similarly , on the basis of isochrones from the same database , milone et al.(2013b ) have excluded that the ms of ngc1844 is consistent with a range of stellar rotation , while isochrones with different overall c@xmath19n@xmath19o abundance could provide a better fit with the observed cmd .",

    "however , while metallicity variations have been detected in some ggcs ( see marino et al.2015 and references therein ) , as discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec : rgb ] , there is no evidence for star - to - star light - element variations in intermediate - age mc clusters .    as an alternative , according to geneva stellar models ( georgy et al.2014 ) , the observations of ngc1856 are consistent with a coeval assembly of stars with a range of rotation . in this context , both the bright msto and the red ms of ngc1856 correspond to a population of rapidly - rotating stars , while the blue - ms and the faint msto are made of non - rotating stars ( dantona et al.2015 , see bottom - left panel of fig .",

    "hst _ to illustrate the main cmd features of intermediate - age and young clusters that are not consistent with a single isochrone .",
    "these features include the emsto and the dual rc , which are commonly observed in most gcs with age of @xmath01 - 2 gyr , and the broadened and double ms , recently discovered in the young clusters ngc1844 and ngc1856 .",

    "the presence of multiple generations of stars in intermediate and young mc clusters is still controversial .",
    "if the emsto is due to age difference , these clusters would provide a unique angle to study the multiple - population phenomenon .",
