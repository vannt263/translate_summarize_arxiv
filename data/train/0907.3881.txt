    "for the boundary conditions we are considering it is no more difficult to handle the general case where @xmath78 , and , for technical reasons , it is actually very useful to do so .",
    "the case @xmath79 behaves quite differently , mainly due to the loss of the maximum principle .",
    "it is well known that if @xmath80 , @xmath81 , then any solution of @xmath82 satisfies @xmath83 we call the leading coefficients @xmath84 and @xmath85 the dirichlet and neumann data of @xmath86 , respectively .",
    "if @xmath86 solves the equation formally , i.e.  in the sense of taylor series , we see that if @xmath87 then @xmath88 vanishes to infinite order at @xmath23 ; in particular , if @xmath89 , then @xmath90 . when @xmath91 , the expansion has the slightly different form @xmath92 and we again consider @xmath84 and @xmath85 as the dirichlet and neumann data , so @xmath93 if and only if @xmath89 . if @xmath94 , then there is a regular solution @xmath95 with @xmath84 non - vanishing , and a singular solution , @xmath96 of the form @xmath97 with both @xmath98 and @xmath99 non - zero",
