    "an issue is to get clues on the interior from these informations .",
    "most of the natural satellites of the giant planets are expected to have reached a state of synchronous rotation , known as cassini state .",
    "this is a dynamical equilibrium from which small departures are signatures of the internal structure .",
    "these small departures are longitudinal and latitudinal librations , the latter ones translating into an obliquity .",
    "the main part of the longitudinal librations is a periodic diurnal oscillation , named physical librations . for a rigid body",
    ", they read ( * ? ? ?",
    "5.123 , e.g. )    @xmath0    @xmath1 being the orbital eccentricity of the satellite , @xmath2 its orbital frequency , and @xmath3 the frequency of the small proper oscillations around the equilibrium .",
    "we have :    @xmath4    where the quantities @xmath5 are diagonal elements of the tensor of inertia of the satellite , and @xmath6 is an eccentricity function made popular by @xcite :    @xmath7    this function is also known as the hansen function @xmath8 , and is present in @xcite .",
    "the quantity @xmath9 , sometimes written as @xmath10 , represents the equatorial ellipticity , or the triaxiality , of the distribution of mass inside the satellite .",
    "this formula assumes a rigid shape , i.e. the tensor of inertia is constant .",
    "a seminal paper by @xcite has shown that if the satellite is not strictly rigid , but viscoelastic , then a restoring torque tends to counterbalance the tidal torque of the parent planet , to lower the amplitude of the physical librations .",
    "this has motivated recent studies @xcite , which revisit the theory of the librations in including a tidal parameter , @xmath11 or @xmath12 , which characterizes the amplitude of variation of the gravity field , or of the surface , at the diurnal , or orbital , frequency @xmath2 . in these studies ,",
    "the body is assumed to be at the hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "the theory of the hydrostatic equilibrium tells us that the mass distribution in the body , i.e. its inertia , is shaped by its rotation and the tidal torque of its parent planet , while the inertia rules its rotation .",
    "however , in most of the studies , the inertia is mainly composed of a constant component which has no chance to be shaped by the rotation , while being assumed to correspond to the hydrostatic equilibrium .    in this paper",
    "i go further , in assuming that part of the mass distribution of these bodies is frozen , while part of it is still being shaped by the rotational and tidal deformation . for that ,",
    "i first show from the measured radii that the departures from the hydrostatic equilibrium are ubiquitous in the system of saturn ( sect .",
    "[ sec : nonhydro ] ) .",
    "then i express the tensor of inertia of a satellite orbiting a giant planet , in considering a frozen triaxiality superimposed with elastic deformation ( sect  [ sec : inertia ] ) .",
    "i then deduce the librational dynamics of the satellite ( sect .",
    "[ sec : librations ] ) , which i apply to the specific cases of epimetheus and mimas , for which longitudinal librations have been measured , and which are assumed to have rigid structure .",
    "finally , i introduce the dissipative part of the tides ( sect .  [",

    "usually the shape of such a body is assumed to be the signature of an hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "this means that the mass distribution is an equilibrium between the gravity of the body , and the rotational and tidal deformations it is subjected to . for a natural satellite orbiting a giant planet , it is assumed that the tidal deformation is only due to the planet , and that its spin rate is equal to its orbital rate , i.e. it rotates synchronously .",
    "this gives the following relations @xcite :    @xmath13    @xmath14 being respectively the 3 planet - facing , orbit - facing , and polar radii , @xmath15 and @xmath16 the classical stokes coefficients , and @xmath17 . in this last formula",
    ", @xmath18 is the mass of the satellite , and @xmath19 its mean radius . the relation ( [ eq : hydroshape ] ) holds for the shape , and ( [ eq : hydrograv ] ) for the gravity field .",
    "the synchronous rotation results in a forcing of the triaxiality of the satellite , since it on average always presents the same face to its parent planet .",

    "these departures from the hydrostatic equilibrium may have different origins , such as a fossil shape , internal processes , or impacts  in the following , i consider them as frozen inertia .",
    "i consider a homogeneous , triaxial and synchronous satellite .",
    "its orbital dynamics comes from the oblate two - body problem , i.e. the semimajor axis @xmath20 and the eccentricity @xmath1 are constant , and the mean longitude @xmath21 and longitude of the pericentre @xmath22 have a uniform precessional motion , the associated frequencies being @xmath2 and @xmath23 , respectively .",
    "moreover , its orbit is assumed to lie in the equatorial plane of the planet , as a consequence the satellite has no obliquity .",

    "our assumptions imply @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 , this results in :    @xmath54    @xmath20 being the semimajor axis of the satellite .",
    "the coordinates of the parent planet @xmath55 and @xmath56 can now be expressed with respect to the orbital elements of the satellite and to its orientation .",
    "since it is assumed to have only a longitudinal motion , its orientation is given by an instantaneous rotation angle @xmath57 around @xmath58 such that @xmath59 and its origin @xmath60 corresponds to a state in which the long axis of the satellite points to the barycenter of the parent planet .    in the reference frame @xmath38 , we have    @xmath61    where @xmath62 stands for the true anomaly , and @xmath22 for the longitude of the pericenter .",

    "i will anyway assume that the frequency associated with @xmath68 is null , i.e. i assume @xmath68 to be constant on average , which is consistent with the resonant locking .",
    "the formulae ( [ eq : i11orbit ] ) to ( [ eq : i33orbit ] ) imply that the tidal response of the satellite does not depend on the frequency of the excitation .",

    "however , @xmath74 and @xmath75 are often assumed to be equal and denoted as @xmath11 .",
    "the periods of the deformations associated are respectively the orbital and half the orbital ones , which are also the diurnal and semi - diurnal periods of the satellite .",
    "the gravitational torque of the parent planet , which acts on the satellite , is collinear to the polar axis , since we consider a planar orbit .",

    "i get the differential equation ruling the longitudinal libration of the satellite , i.e.    @xmath84    with    @xmath85      the equation ( [ eq : biglibra ] ) can be simplified for an analytical resolution in neglecting the variations of @xmath68 with respect to the ones of @xmath86 , and @xmath87 .",

    "moreover , the triaxiality is supposed to be entirely due to the rotational and tidal deformations , i.e. there is no frozen component in @xmath93 , and the second degree in the eccentricity has been neglected . in @xcite , @xmath11 stands for @xmath74 , while in @xcite , the topographical love number @xmath12 has been used .",

    "this geometrically means that the parent planet raises two bulges at the surface of the satellite , i.e. a bulge which is aligned with the direction of the planet , and which is responsible for the elastic tide , and a bulge in quadrature , which is responsible for the dissipative tide ( * ? ? ?",

    "the reason for this is that the andrade - maxwell rheology considers a high - frequency effect , i.e. the andrade creep , while the quantities i depict depend on @xmath74 .",
    "so , a difference between these 2 models should appear only when the maxwell time is large with respect to the orbital period .",
    "we also see that the phase shifts should be very small , except for maxwell times that are very short , i.e. a few seconds .",
    "this could explain why neither @xmath165 nor @xmath173 has been detected for epimetheus .    as for epimetheus , the fig .",
    "[ fig : rheomimas ] suggests that the phase shifts should be very small for mimas .",
    "however , @xcite have measured @xmath182 , which suggests @xmath183 s for a rigidity @xmath184 gpa . a rigidity ten times smaller , i.e. @xmath185 gpa ,",
    "would give @xmath186 s ( fig .",
    "[ fig : maxwellmimas ] ) . a smaller @xmath73 would give a maxwell time of the same order of magnitude , since it would be partly counterbalanced by a larger @xmath125 .",
    "for instance , we would have @xmath187 and @xmath188 s for a rigidity @xmath184 gpa and @xmath135 .",
    "these are very small times , if we keep in mind that a maxwell time of the magnitude of the day is to be expected for ice near its melting point ( * ? ? ?",
    "* e.g. ) , and larger times for denser materials .",
    "actually , no realistic rigidity results in a realistic maxwell time .",
    "this result discards a model of solid structure for mimas . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors retained two internal structures which could explain the measured amplitude of libration : a solid body with an excess of triaxiality due to a dense and elongated core , and a global ocean .",
    "the phase shift seems to speak for the global ocean .",
    "in this study i have proposed a novel theory of librations of a synchronous satellite , in which the role of the frozen component of the inertia of a triaxial satellite is differentiated from the one of the secular elastic deformation .",
    "the frozen component should not be addressed as a result of the hydrostatic equilibrium , a recent study by @xcite mentions this issue .",
    "i have shown that the measured physical librations of epimetheus and mimas are consistent with the presence of these two components in the inertia of the bodies .",
    "however , the introduction of the dissipative tides introduces a phase shift in the librations , which is far too small to explain the one which has been measured for mimas .",
    "this strenghtens the assessment of a global ocean .",
    "the detection of the phase shift in the librations of mimas is a key result , which should encourage its investigation for other bodies , because it probably contains information on the ocean .",
    "for that , this study should be extended to a more complex structure , in which a solid crust is partly decoupled from a rigid core by a global fluid layer .",
    "features at the surface of europa have been interpreted as an evidence for supersynchronous rotation @xcite , the present study can not explain it , but an influence of the interior is not to be discarded .",
    "this study took benefit from the financial support of the contract prodex cr90253 from the belgian science policy office ( belspo ) , and is part of the activities of the issi team _ constraining the dynamical timescale and internal processes of the saturn system from astrometry_. i am indebted to rose - marie baland , marie yseboodt , and two anonymous reviewers , for their careful readings and valuable suggestions .",
