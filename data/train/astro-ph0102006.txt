    "in his paper , walborn ( these proceedings ) emphasizes that two prominent emission lines occurring in o - type spectra remain unidentified 37 years after being documented by wolff ( 1963 ) .",
    "in fact , as pointed out by wolff , these lines were reported even earlier by swings & struve ( 1940 ) in a spectrum they have taken of 9  sge , o7.5iaf , hence this problem remains unsolved over 60 years .",
    "walborn furthermore states that despite several contrary suggestions in the literature , these lines are unlikely to be due to cno ions , because they show no preference for on or oc spectral types .",
    "because of their possible role as selective emission lines with potential diagnostic power he concludes that `` we should not sleep well until these lines are identified '' .",
    "the prospect of many sleepless nights , though not too frightening to astronomers , prompted us to attack this problem .",
    "=    = 0.80    =",
    "we calculated plane - parallel static nlte model atmospheres composed of hydrogen , helium , and sulfur .",
    "the code used is based on an accelerated lambda iteration ( ali ) technique and is described in detail by werner & dreizler ( 1999 ) .",
    "the sulfur model atom consists of ionization stages .",
    "figure  1 displays our model atom for , which has 27 nlte levels linked by 70 radiative transitions .",
    "energy levels were obtained from the nist database ( http://www.nist.gov/ ) , oscillator strengths and bound - free cross - sections from the opacity project database ( seaton et al.1994 ) .",
    "line broadening and collisional rates are computed by standard approximate expressions due to the lack of reliable data . in the following we exclusively describe results from a single model calculation ( = 35500k , = 3.7 , solar abundances ) .",
    "systematic investigations covering the o spectral sequence and all luminosity classes are the subject of future work .",
    "figure  2 shows the sulfur ionization structure throughout the atmosphere .",
    "it can be seen that is the dominant stage in the line formation region (= ) , followed by .",
    "this situation favors recombination from into highly excited levels which then de - excite radiatively by photon emission .",
    "in fact this turns out to be the mechanism responsible for the emission lines under discussion .",
    "the observed emission line pair stems from the transition 3s@xmath04d  @xmath0d3s@xmath04f  @xmath0f@xmath1 , which in detail is composed of three lines . in all",
    "observed spectra we have inspected in the literature , the two blue components at 4486  are too close to be resolved because of stellar rotation ( fig.2 ) .",
    ".atomic data for the newly identified emission lines , taken from nist and opacity project databases [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     figure  3 compares the computed model spectrum with observations of 15mon , o7v((f ) ) , and hd105056 , on9.7iae .",
    "the model is convolved with rotation profiles with @xmath2sin@xmath3=67km / s and 68km / s , respectively ( from howarth et al.1997 ) .",
    "it has parameters appropriate for 15mon ( see above ) , being somewhat cooler than the temperature obtained by herrero et al.(1992 , = 39500k ) .",
    "the emission lines match the observation very well , both in wavelength and in strength .",
    "the supergiant hd105056 requires a much cooler model with much lower gravity ( = 31600k , = 3.1 , pauldrach et al.1990 ) , but nevertheless we show the spectrum of this star with the same model in order to emphasize the relative strength of the emissions as compared to the main sequence star 15  mon",
    ". the relative strength of the two emission lines is not matched by the model .",
    "this can be caused by subtle details , like treatment of collisional rates among the levels , and deserves further investigation .",
    "our models also include and lines in the uv and fuv spectral regions .",
    "they show an absorption line at 1502  which supports the identification first suggested by howarth ( 1987 ) .",
    "in addition , the models predict an absorption line of at 1099 .",
    "it is a multiplet with four components between 1098.4  and 1100.05 arising from transitions between the lowest @xmath0d and @xmath0d@xmath1 terms in the grotrian diagram ( fig.1 ) .",
    "a hitherto unidentified line at this wavelength has been observed in copernicus spectra of o - stars ( walborn & bohlin 1996 ) and we suggest the identification with .",
    "finally , sixty years after the first documentation of the 4486,4504emission lines in o - star spectra , their origin has been revealed ; by using model calculations , we have shown that they are attributable to .",
    "since the models are of plane - parallel atmospheres , neither sphericity effects nor stellar winds need to be invoked for this emission line phenomenon .",
    "future work may explain the observed strength of these lines as a function of effective temperature and luminosity class so that , in turn , these selective emission lines may henceforth be used as a diagnostic tool .",
