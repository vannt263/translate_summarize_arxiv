    "physics of spin transport has been a matter of intensive research in recent years .",
    "one of the topics of current interest is the spin hall effect .",
    "this has been originally proposed theoretically @xcite and later followed by various experimental results @xcite .",
    "the research on the spin hall effect opens a new field of hall effects in time - reversal invariant systems .",
    "this has also led us to a new concept of the quantum spin hall effect , which is the natural  spin \" extension of the quantum hall effect @xcite . in the quantum spin hall effect in two dimensions",
    ", the bulk is gapped while there are gapless edge states carrying spin current . in this case , the external magnetic field is zero , while the spin - orbit coupling acts as a  spin - dependent magnetic field \" , giving rise to the effect analogous to the quantum hall effect .",
    "such insulators showing the quantum spin hall effect are characterized by the @xmath0 topological number @xcite . we shall call them as @xmath0 quantum spin hall insulators ( qshi ) .",
    "the simplest system for the two - dimensional ( 2-d ) @xmath0 qshi is realized as a superposition of the wavefunctions of two quantum hall subsystems @xcite , one with spin up and the other with spin down , having opposite chern numbers .",
    "the system respects not only the time - reversal @xmath6 invariance but also the spin - conservation .",
    "such an insulator supports the same numbers of right - moving up - spin edge states and left - moving down - spin edges .",
    "this kramers pair of chiral edge states is often called as the helical edge state . by its construction ,",
    "the number of this kramers pairs of edge states correspond to the chern integer associated with its bulk wavefunction  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath7 symmetry guarantees the double degeneracy between right - moving up - spin and left moving down - spin states .",
    "thus , the stability of _ each _ kramers pair is supported by this @xmath7-symmetry .",
    "spin non - conserving ( but @xmath7 invariant ) perturbations , however , introduce level repulsions between two _ different _ kramers pairs .",
    "namely , they usually let two pairs annihilate with each other , and open a gap . accordingly , in the presence of generic spin - non - conserving perturbations , those wavefunctions having _ even _ numbers of kramers pairs , reduce to _ trivial",
    "_ insulators , which have no gapless edge states  @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , wavefunctions having _ odd _ numbers of pairs still can have one active helical edge mode .",
    "the latter is dubbed as the @xmath0 quantum spin hall ( topological ) insulator .",
    "thus , stability of such a gapless edge state is protected only by the @xmath7-symmetry , while does not require spin - conservations anymore  @xcite .",
    "the three - dimensional ( 3-d ) version @xcite of the @xmath0 qshi carries same characters as that of 2-d does .",
    "the 3-d @xmath0 qshi also allows any spin - nonconservering perturbations , while always requires the @xmath7 symmetry .",
    "simultaneously , however , it is not a mere extension of the 2-d @xmath0 qshi , in a sense that 3-d @xmath0 qshi has _ no @xmath8-analogue _ of qshi .",
    "namely , they support a @xmath9 massless dirac fermion as its surface state  @xcite , instead of a helical edge state . in the 2-d surface brillouin zone , say @xmath10-@xmath11 plane , this massless dirac fermion has a spin which depends on the ( surface ) crystal momentum .",
    "it is clear that such an insulator can not be adiabatically connected into a composite of two spinless wavefunctions . in such @xmath0 qshi , the @xmath7 symmetry therefore guarantees the massless nature of each @xmath9 surface dirac fermion .",
    "@xmath0 qshi always has a quantum critical point at its phase boundary to any ordinary insulators , in both 2-d and 3-d .",
    "for example , from the 3-d tight - binding model proposed by fu , kane and mele @xcite , we can explicitly see this ; when a certain @xmath7 symmetric parameter is varied in their model , 3d @xmath0 qshi is driven into an ordinary insulator , latter of which does not support any surface states ( see fig .",
    "[ t1 ] ) . observing this",
    ", a following question naturally arises ; during this tuning , the @xmath7 symmetry is _ always _ preserved , so that the massless nature of the surface dirac fermion is supposed to be protected by this . at the same time",
    ", however , this @xmath9 surface fermion should have become `` massive '' , when a system enter an ordinary insulator phase .",
    "thus , one might ask how this single surface dirac fermion could acquire a finite mass , with keeping the @xmath7 symmetry ?",
    "qshi and an ordinary insulator .",
    "@xmath2 is a system parameter driving the phase transition . when @xmath5 , the system is in a critical phase . in the fu - kane - mele model",
    ", it corresponds to the relative strength of one out of the four nn transfer integrals emitting from a single site.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the answer is simple ; we have _ two _ sample boundaries , say @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "each boundary supports one @xmath9 surface massless dirac fermion respectively .",
    "they are localized at each boundary , when the bulk gap is sufficiently large .",
    "in such a situation , a mixing between these two @xmath9 surface massless dirac fermions is tiny , i.e. @xmath14 with @xmath15 being the localization length .",
    "however , when a system becomes close to the quantum critical point , a mixing between these two surface states becomes substantial , with increasing @xmath15 .",
    "when a bulk eventually reaches the quantum critical point , two surface massless dirac fermions readily communicate via extended bulk states .",
    "thus , they generally annihilate in pairs , just as in those insulators having even number of @xmath9 surface dirac fermions at one boundary .",
    "this simple picture in the clean limit raises the following non - trivial speculations about the disorder effects on the @xmath0 qshi .",
    "suppose that @xmath7-symmetric random potentials are introduced in the topological insulator phase .",
    "when the corresponding bulk gap is sufficiently large , we could begin with two separate bands . the scaling argument in 3-d  @xcite",
    "tells us that each band should always have two mobility edges , respectively ( see fig .",
    "[ t2](b ) ) .",
    "namely , there is no delocalized bulk - wavefunction near the zero energy .",
    "starting from this phase , let us change some @xmath7-invariant model - parameters , so that a bulk transits from this topological insulator to an ordinary one . from the argument in the clean limit",
    ", one can then expect that _ a delocalized bulk - wavefunction should emerge at the zero - energy region at the quantum critical point _ , i.e. @xmath16 ( see fig .",
    "[ t2](a ) ) .",
    "if it were not , the two surface states localized at the two sample boundaries could not communicate at all and they could not annihilate with each other . as a result ,",
    "the system was unable to smoothly enter an ordinary band insulator , since the latter one does not support any surface state at all .    .",
    "( a ) @xmath5 ; at quantum critical point .",
    "( b ) @xmath17 ; in the topological insulator phase.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    to put this reversely , the existence of the quantum critical point ( qcp ) having extended bulk wavefunctions is always required , whenever this critical point separates an ordinary insulator and the topological insulator .",
    "this is because these two insulating phases support different numbers of kramers pairs of surface states .",
    "moreover , provided that these surface states are stable by itself , this qcp should be also stable , _ however small _ the density of state ( dos ) at the zero energy is and _ however strong _ the disorder strength is .",
    "otherwise , the topological insulator could be adiabatically connected into an ordinary band insulator , which contradicts the different @xmath0 topological numbers for the two phases .    in this paper",
    ", we will uncover several novel features associated with the non - magnetic disorder effects onto this topological quantum critical point .",
    "the organization of this paper is summarized as follows . in the next section",
    ", we will briefly review the effective continuum model for the quantum critical point intervening the @xmath0 topological insulator and an ordinary insulator .",
    "the effective model is known to be described by the @xmath1 dirac fermion , whose mass term brings about the topological quantum phase transition .",
    "namely , when the mass term changed from positive to negative , a system transits from the topological insulator to an ordinary insulator . as such",
    ", we call this mass term especially as the topological mass term . based on this effective model",
    ", we will next introduce various types of the on - site random potentials respecting the @xmath7-symmetry .",
    "note that , in this paper , we restrict ourselves to @xmath7-symmetric cases and exclude magnetic impurities , because , in the absence of the @xmath7 symmetry , the two phases are no longer topologically distinct .",
    "based on the self - consistent born approximation , we first work over the single - particle green function in the section  iii .",
    "the phase diagram spanned by the ( bare ) chemical potential @xmath3 , ( bare ) mass term @xmath2 and strength of the disorder @xmath18 is derived . in particular , at the critical point , i.e. @xmath5 , we found some critical value of the disorder strength , @xmath19 , above which the zero - energy state , i.e. @xmath20 , acquires a finite life - time @xmath21 ;    @xmath22 = 1-\\frac{\\alpha_{c}}{\\alpha } \\label{e1}.   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    since the density of state in our model is always proportional to the inverse of the life - time ( see below ) , non zero @xmath23 simply means that a system is in a compressible phase .",
    "when a finite but small topological mass @xmath2 is introduced for @xmath24 , the life - time @xmath21 and the renormalized mass @xmath25 becomes as follows ; @xmath26 where @xmath27 is given as a function only of @xmath18 via eq .",
    "( [ e1 ] ) .",
    "thus , when the bare topological mass exceeds the critical value @xmath28 , the density of state vanishes , so that a system enters an incompressible phase .",
    "this gapped phase can be adiabatically connected into band insulator phases in the clean limit .",
    "accordingly , we will reach the phase diagram for the zero - energy state as depicted in fig .",
    "[ t3 ] .    .",
    "a blue shaded region corresponds to a compressible phase , which separates two gapped phases , i.e. an ordinary insulator and the topological insulator .",
    "this phase boundary for @xmath24 is given by @xmath29$].,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    in the section  iii , we also describe the behavior of the one - particle green function for a finite @xmath3 ( see below ) , in which we observe that the compressible phase ( not necessarily metallic phase ) always intervenes the topological insulator phase and an ordinary insulator phase as in fig .",
    "[ t3 ] .    focusing on this intervening compressible phase , especially for @xmath30",
    ", we will derive in the section .",
    "iv the diffuson , cooperon and the weak localization correction to the electric conductivity .",
    "we will first observe that the diffuson is composed of two quasi - degenerate low - energy modes ; @xmath31 ( see fig .",
    "( [ t12 - 1 - 0 ] ) or eq .  ( [ identity ] ) for the definition of @xmath32 ) .",
    "the first term participates in usual charge diffuson mode , and therefore always has the diffusion pole , i.e. @xmath33^{-1}$ ] ( @xmath34 and @xmath35 stand for the frequency and momentum of the density fluctuation respectively ) .",
    "the other low - energy mode , however , becomes massless only in the absence of the topological mass @xmath2 .",
    "namely , its low - energy and long wavelength behavior is generally truncated by the infrared cutoff @xmath36 , while this infrared cutoff reduces to zero at @xmath5 ( but generic @xmath3 ) , i.e. @xmath37 .    physically speaking",
    ", this second mode describes the diffusion of the parity density degree of freedom , which becomes a conserved quantity of our effective hamiltonian at @xmath5 .",
    "namely , the parity - density correlation function exhibits the diffusion pole structure at the critical point ( @xmath5 ) , while it becomes massive in the presence of the finite topological mass .",
    "consequently , the diffuson acquires one additional low - energy , i.e. the 2nd term of eq .",
    "( [ punch1 - 0 ] ) , into which the information of this parity - density correlation function is separately encoded .",
    "when the hole - line of the diffuson time - reversed , these two - mode features are transcribed into the cooperon : the cooperon thus obtained is also composed of two quasi - degenerate dominant contributions ; @xmath38 ( see fig .",
    "[ t12 - 1 - 0 ] and its caption for the definition of @xmath39 ) . in section .",
    "iv , we will see that , at the critical point ( @xmath5 ) , these two contributions give rise to the same amplitude of the anti - weak - localization ( awl ) correction to the electric conductivity .",
    "when the finite topological mass is introduced , however , the cooperon associated with the parity mode channel becomes ineffective , since its backward scattering behaviour is truncated by the cutoff @xmath36 .",
    "meanwhile , the cooperon obtained from the charge mode channel remains effective , even in the presence of finite @xmath2 . as a result ,",
    "the awl correction at the critical point becomes precisely halved , on introducing the finite topological mass ( quantum correction doubling ) .    in terms of this novel behaviour of the parity diffusion mode and that of the corresponding awl correction",
    ", we will argue in the section .",
    "v the possible microscopic mechanism of how the delocalized bulk - wavefunction emerges at the critical point , i.e. @xmath4 . to be more specific",
    ", we expect that the parity diffusion mode mentioned above generally becomes massless , when a system transits from the topological insulator side to the ordinary insulator side . assuming that this is the case",
    ", we will attribute the emergence of the extended bulk wavefunction to the awl correction obtained from this parity mode channel , i.e. the second term of eq .",
    "( [ punch2 - 0 ] ) . for the systematic understanding",
    ", however , one generally needs to go beyond the theoretical approach employed in this paper .",
    "several open issues will be also discussed in the section  v.    a number of appendices describe other topics useful in understanding the main text in more detail . for clarity of the explanation , we have presented the results only in the case of chemical - potential type disorder in the text .",
    "the study in the presence of general @xmath7 symmetric disorders becomes more cumbersome .",
    "but the basic feature such as the phase diagram is expected to be same . in the appendix",
    "a , we will describe how the one - particle green function at the zero - energy state behaves in the presence of these general @xmath7-invariant random potentials .",
    "our weak - localization calculation described in the section .",
    "iv is the controlled analysis , when it comes to the weakly disordered region , @xmath40 .",
    "namely , for this parameter region , one can confirm self - consistently the coupling constant @xmath41 to be sufficiently small around @xmath20 ( see eq .",
    "( [ control ] ) ) . for @xmath24",
    ", however , this coupling constant generally diverges toward @xmath20 , only to make the weak localization calculation ( and scb calculation ) an uncontrolled analysis .",
    "thus , as the complementary analysis for this strongly disordered region , @xmath24 , we employed the mode - mode coupling analysis in the appendices .",
    "b - d . by taking into account the quantum interference effect due to the cooperon terms",
    ", this theoretical framework gives us the gap equation for the diffusion constant .",
    "main results in section .",
    "iv such as the quantum correction doubling are also supported by the analysis in the appendices .",
    "we consider a system with both @xmath7-symmetry and the spatial inversion ( @xmath42)-symmetry . under this symmetry requirement ,",

    "it turns out to be always described by the @xmath1 dirac fermion given as follows ; @xmath43 where @xmath2 corresponds to the topological mass term .",
    "without loss of generality , one can regard the topological insulator phase to be @xmath17 and an ordinary insulator phase to be @xmath44 ( see fig .",
    "[ t1 ] ) . to see that `` @xmath2 '' actually endows this dirac fermion with a mass",
    ", we note that following five @xmath45 @xmath46-matrices are anticommuting with one another ; @xmath47 the matrices @xmath48 and @xmath49 are pauli matrices , representing the ( generalized ) sublattice index , and the spin index , respectively . in terms of these pauli matrices , we will take the @xmath7 operator as @xmath50 with @xmath51 being the complex conjugation .",
