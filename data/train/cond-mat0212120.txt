    "scanning tunneling microscopy@xcite ( stm ) has proven to be one of the most useful tools to measure and characterize low energy electron spectroscopy , at least on open surfaces where the microscope tip has a direct access to the physical region under study . in a series of recent works , kondo impurities @xcite on the surface of noble metals",
    "have been studied using the stm.@xcite in the kondo problem there is a characteristic temperature @xmath0 that separates the low temperature from the high temperature regimes . in the low temperature regime ( @xmath1 )",
    ", the spectral density of a kondo impurity develops a resonance at the fermi energy , known as the kondo resonance , and consequently locally changes the low energy spectroscopic properties of the system .",
    "when the microscope tip is placed on top of the impurity , the characteristic conductance vs voltage @xmath2 shows a typical fano - like@xcite structure that is identified as the fingerprint of the kondo effect . in this way",
    ", the kondo behavior of several transition metal impurities on different noble metal surfaces has been identified . in particular ,",
    "the temperature dependence of the kondo effect has been measured and , by studying co impurities on different cu surfaces , the scaling of the kondo temperature with the host electron density has been shown.@xcite    stm has also been used to create nanostructures on noble metal surfaces by manipulation of single atoms .",
    "this allows to positionate impurities at special points of the surface or to engineer the environment of the impurity . in recent experiments",
    "the kondo effect for a @xmath3 impurity inside a quantum corral has been observed.@xcite    the fano like structure of the conductance observed when the stm tip is on top of a kondo impurity , can be explained with a simple phenomenological model which includes an impurity resonant state at the fermi energy .",
    "this resonance , that represents the kondo resonance , has a width @xmath4 . in this model ,",
    "the differential conductance though the tip @xmath5 is given by : @xmath6 here @xmath7 is a background conductance , @xmath8 is a constant , @xmath9 and @xmath10 is the fano parameter that depends on the electronic structure and on the tunneling matrix elements .    for a more quantitative estimation , a many body calculation including the electron - electron interactions leading to the kondo resonance",
    "is needed . moreover ,",
    "if the impurity is placed on a surface that is structured at a nanoscopic scale , the local density of states may strongly depend on energy , an effect that changes the shape of the kondo resonance @xcite and consequently of the voltage dependence of the stm conductance .",
    "a nanostructure with a characteristic length @xmath11 has a characteristic energy scale @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the fermi velocity . in systems with @xmath14 we expect strong effects .",
    "quantum corrals on the @xmath15 @xmath16 surface can be engineered with the desired energy scale @xmath17 , however it is not clear how much the surface states and bulk states contribute to the kondo effect . despite of some notorious effects like the observation , in elliptical corrals , of the so - called mirages,@xcite",
    "some experiments indicate that the surface states play almost no role in the development of the kondo effect.@xcite if so , the kondo screening would not be affected by the corral that confines only surface states .",
    "a detailed analysis of the stm conductance can be used to elucidate this point , however to do that the surface nanostructure and the kondo correlations have to be treated on the same footing .    in what follows we present results for the tip conductance on top of a kondo impurity .",
    "using the numerical renormalization group , we evaluate the finite temperature conductance for an impurity on open and clean surfaces and on structured ones .",
    "in this section we present the model and briefly discuss how the stm conductance is calculated using wilson s renormalization group .",
    "we then present the results for different situations .",
    "our starting point is an extended anderson model for magnetic impurities described with the following hamiltonian:@xcite    @xmath18    where the operator @xmath19 creates an electron with spin @xmath20 at the impurity orbital with energy @xmath21 and coulomb repulsion @xmath22 , @xmath23 creates an electron in an extended state with quantum numbers @xmath24 and @xmath25 and energy @xmath26 .",
    "the last term is a falicov - kimbal like term which takes into account a coulomb repulsion between the electrons at the impurity orbital and the ones at extended states .",
    "the quantum number @xmath24 includes the band index and crystal momentum . in the case of impurities on the cu ( 111 ) surface",
    "there is a surface band that is relevant for determining the stm conductance.@xcite    the stm conductance at low temperatures is given by@xcite @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the voltage drop from the tip to the sample , and @xmath29 is the tip density of states that is assumed to be constant around the fermi energy . in the linear response regime ,",
    "the quantity @xmath30 is given by @xmath31 here @xmath32 is the retarded green function of the operator @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 are matrix elements for tunneling of an electron from the tip to the conduction band states and impurity orbital respectively and @xmath36 is the field operator that creates an electron on the surface at coordinate @xmath37 . in what follows",
    "we consider that the tip is on top of the impurity and take @xmath38to be the impurity coordinate .",
    "the green function is calculated using the numerical renormalization group ( nrg ) . for a general description of the method",
    "we refer to refs . and , here we give only some details that are specific to our calculation .",
    "the starting point of the nrg is to reduce the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) to that of a linear chain    @xmath39    the states described by the operators @xmath40 are wilson s orbitals centered at the impurity with the state @xmath41 associated with @xmath42 being a wannier like orbital centered at the impurity coordinate .",

    "wilson s orbitals are assumed to be a linear combination of surface and bulk states , in particular the wannier state @xmath41 contains a surface and a bulk component determined by the respective hybridization matrix elements @xmath48 .    to calculate the stm conductance when the tip is on top of the impurity",

    "the stm conductance depends on the following parameters : @xmath4 that gives the low energy scale where the local spectroscopic properties are dominated by the impurity , the temperature @xmath58 and the fano parameter @xmath59 that combines the tunneling matrix elements and some aspects of the band structure .",
    "if the kondo resonance is represented by a simple resonant state , the fano parameter is given by @xmath60 where @xmath61 is an effective band propagator.@xcite for a system with electron - hole symmetry the real part of @xmath62 at the fermi energy is zero and the parameter @xmath10 is proportional to the matrix element @xmath35 that describes the direct tunneling into the localized state . in this case ,",
    "@xmath10 accounts for the interference between the two tunneling channels .",
    "in general , real systems have a non zero @xmath63 and there is no need to assume a direct tunneling to the localized state to have an asymmetric ( @xmath64 ) fano resonance . in the nrg approach ,",
    "the use of a symmetric conduction band simplifies the calculation and most of the numerical work on the kondo effect has been done with this symmetry .",

    "[ gv](b ) , by independently varying @xmath44 for @xmath65 we show that in a full nrg many body calculation , the low energy stm conductance is still given by a single parameter @xmath10 as given by equation ( [ q ] ) . as @xmath76 is increased the resonance narrows indicating a lowering of the kondo temperature .",
    "this is due to a decrease in the local density of states at the fermi energy .",
    "the increase of @xmath76 also induces an increase of the fano parameter . for simplicity , in what follows we take symmetric band ( @xmath77 ) where the fano parameter is given by @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is the density of states of the band .",
    "our calculation , that up to now mainly reproduces known results , shows that the nrg gives reliable results when used to evaluate the stm conductance . in what follows we present some results that include the behavior of the conductance when the energy of the localized orbital approaches the fermi energy , the effect of the falicov - kimbal term @xmath80 and the temperature dependence of the conductance .    , and @xmath81 .",

    "is increased and approaches the fermi energy , first the kondo temperature increases and then the impurity enters an intermediate valence regime . in the conductance shown in fig .",
    "[ gve ] these effects are clearly observed .",
    "a notorious effect for intermediate values of @xmath21 is the occurrence of an asymmetry for finite voltages : away from the fermi level the values of @xmath86 are smaller for @xmath87 than for @xmath88 .",
    "this effect is due to the localized orbital resonance that is close to the fermi energy .",
    "as @xmath21 increases even more ( not shown ) the resonance crosses the fermi level , the impurity occupation is reduced and the conductance shows a broad structure with a width that is given by the resonance width @xmath89 rather than by the kondo temperature . as we now show , the effect of a non zero electron - electron interaction @xmath80 is equivalent to a shift in the impurity level .",
    "the parameter @xmath80 is irrelevant , that means that in the kondo regime the zero temperature fixed point does not depend on this parameter and the low temperature thermodynamic behavior is universal as for @xmath72 .",
    "however this interaction may change some details in the low energy spectral structure for energies of the order or larger than @xmath90 .",
    "we have analyzed the effect of @xmath80 on the stm conductance and the results are summarized in fig .",
    "as @xmath80 increases the fano line shape changes and two different effects can be observed : _ i _ )",
    "the width of the conductance minimum increases indicating an increase in the kondo temperature and _ ii _ ) the voltage dependence of the conductance becomes more asymmetric .",
    "these two points are consistent with an effective shift the localized level toward the fermi energy .",

    "2.,width=283 ]    the asymmetry in @xmath86 obtained when the resonant level approaches the fermi level has not been discussed in detail in the literature , however experimental results for @xmath3 on @xmath47 and for @xmath97 on @xmath98 show this type of effect . in ref .",
    "the raw experimental has a marked asymmetriy in the conductance that was attributed to a broad resonance lying just above the fermi energy .",
    "our results may explain the asymmetry as due to the same localized orbital that generates the kondo resonance .",
    "now we present finite temperature results and analyze the temperature dependence of the conductance . to do this",
    "we calculate the finite temperature spectral densities following refs . and and use the finite temperature extension of eq .",

    "the main effect of a nanostructure on the surface is to produce an energy dependence of the local density of states on a scale @xmath110 that may be comparable with @xmath4 . if this happens the kondo effect may be very much affected as discussed in previous works .",
    "possible realizations of this situation may be obtained by placing impurities in quantum corrals , on small islands or in any structure with a characteristic size of the order of the hundred  .",
    "the problem then becomes much more complicated mainly because of two reasons : on the one hand , the nanostructure of the host and the kondo correlations have to be treated on the same footing . on the other hand , a detailed model for the metallic surface and the effect of the nanostructure on the bulk and surface states is needed .",
    "in general , in surfaces like the @xmath47 where there is a surface band , we expect structures like the quantum corrals or small islands to confine surface states keeping the bulk states nearly unaffected .",
    "if so , these structures would change the kondo effect according to the participation of the surface states on the magnetic screening of the impurity .",
    "this point is still controversial : while the observation of quantum mirages seems to indicate that surface modes actively participate in the kondo screening , other experimental results suggest that the kondo effect is due to bulk states .",
    "the stm conductance could be used to clarify this point .",
    "due to the lack of a detailed model suitable to be treated with the renormalization group approach , we resort to a simple and phenomenological model to study the effect of structured local densities of states .",
    "the model reduces the problem to a single effective conduction band . as",
    "before , we assume that wilson s orbitals are built as linear combination of the surface or bulk states .",
    "the surface nanostructure affects mostly the surface component of these states . in order to describe a local density of states with a structure in the desired energy range ,",
    "we resort to the method described in refs . and .",
    "the calculation includes a potential barrier that confines the electrons .",
    "the local density of states so obtained in the absence of impurity has the form of resonant states .",
    "this type of resonances have been observed using the stm in atomic islands or terraces on the @xmath47 surfaces.@xcite if surface states participate actively on the kondo screening , the modulation of the relevant local density of states would be large indicating that the active electrons are confined by the nanostructure ( a large potential barrier ) .",
    "conversely , if the kondo effect is mostly due to the bulk states , the local density of states modulation would be very week . in this case",
    "we use a small effective barrier .",
    "the model is meant to make only qualitative estimations , nevertheless as we show below some important conclusions can be drawn from our analysis .     and @xmath111 ( a ) at - resonance ( b ) off - resonance .",

    "is shown ( thin line).,width=283 ]    as stated above , a nanostructure introduces a new length scale and the corresponding energy scale @xmath114 since the number of microscopic parameters of the model is large , we just distinguish to cases : large structures with @xmath115 and small nanostructures with @xmath116 .",
    "another important aspect of the kondo effect in nanostructures concerns the position of the fermi level relative to the structure of the local density of states . in this respect",
    "we consider the two extreme cases : the fermi energy lying at a resonance ( at - resonance case ) or between two resonances ( off - resonance case ) .",
    "the quantum corrals on @xmath117 with characteristic sizes of the order of @xmath118 correspond to the small nanostructure category .",
    "the elliptical corrals of ref .",
    "have the fermi energy at a resonance .",
    "figure [ gvb ] illustrates the case of a relatively large nanostructure ( @xmath119 ) for the at - resonance and off - resonance cases .",
    "the calculation was done with a small @xmath10 and an intermediate barrier .",
    "the low temperature stm conductance shows a fano like structure modulated by a superstructure of peaks separated approximately by the characteristic energy @xmath17 . for the at - resonance case the central valley slightly broadens while for the off - resonance case narrow structures at low voltages are obtained .",
    "as the barrier height decreases the amplitude of the oscillations in the host local density of states decreases and the conductance continuously approaches the open surface result .",
    "figure [ gvb1 ] shows the results for a small system ( @xmath120 ) . in this case",

    "[ gvb1](b ) ) case and large barriers , the kondo temperature aincreases and the fano structure is broadened .",
    "this is due to an increase of the local density of states at the fermi energy @xmath121 .",

    "we have analyzed the stm conductance @xmath86 for kondo impurities on clean and structured surfaces . starting with an anderson model we used the nrg to calculate the physical properties and voltage dependence of the conductance .",
    "for clean surfaces we showed that the numerical approach gives reliable results and reproduces the fano type stm response . in particular , we have studied in some detail how @xmath86 depends on different microscopic parameters and on temperature . as the impurity level is shifted away from the symmetric case @xmath127 , either by changing its energy or by means of a falicov - kimbal interaction , the fano line is distorted . for a set of physical parameters , both the shape and the temperature dependence of the conductance",
    "are in good agreement with experimental observations .",
    "the temperature dependence is also in good agreement with the low temperature fermi liquid theory .    to discuss the stm conductance of impurities in structured surfaces we used an effective one channel model . in surfaces like the @xmath47 one , where there is a surface band , this effective channel represents a linear combination of surface and bulk sates .",
    "since a surface structure perturbs much more the surface modes than the bulk modes , the sensitivity of the kondo effect to the structure gives an idea of the surface mode participation in the kondo screening .",
    "we have shown that small structures like the quantum corrals , that are quite efficient in confining surface electrons , should produce important changes in the kondo temperature and on the stm response if the surface modes were active in the kondo physics .",
    "the experiments show that the fano line has essentially the same width when the impurity is on a clean surface or inside a corral , only small changes in the parameter @xmath10 are observed.@xcite this fact is a clear indication that the surface modes can sense the kondo effect but are not important in determining it .",
    "this conclusion is in agreement with estimation of the microscopic parameters for surface and bulk states.@xcite"
