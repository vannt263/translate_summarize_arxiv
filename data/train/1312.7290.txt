    "recently , hurtado _ et al _ @xcite have studied the hydrogen ( @xmath1 ) diffusion effects on @xmath2 steels , presently used in conventional supercritical thermal power plants and candidates for future iv generation supercritical water cooled nuclear reactors .",
    "based on the numerical resolution of fick s equations in presence of trapping sites @xcite , and from the fit of electrochemical @xmath1 detection curves , these authors provided quantitative information about the binding energy between @xmath1 and trapping sites during @xmath1 diffusion process @xcite .",
    "permeation tests performed in our laboratory on @xmath2 alloys reveal a permeation coefficient 10 times lower and a diffusion coefficient 200 times lower than in pure , annealed iron . focusing on these experimental results",
    ", we will explore very simple model of new @xmath1 trapping sites and possible migration paths that can explain the experimental observations .",
    "therefore , before dealing with modeling @xmath1 traps , it is important to watch carefully and with special attention the initial microscopic processes that can delay the @xmath1 atoms during diffusion . in this way , we start studying numerically the static and dynamic properties of vacancies and interstitial defects in a @xmath0 matrix . @xmath2 martensitic steel of bct structure , is a complex system to be simulated .",
    "our main difficulty arises in modeling such a system . for this purpose",
    ", we have considered an incremental approach , namely : the effect of the ratio between the bct cell parameters ( @xmath3 ) is not as relevant as the effect of substitutional @xmath4 @xcite , then we start our calculation in @xmath5 bulk in presence of : i ) a vacancy at nearest neighbor sites of a substitutional @xmath4 atom ; followed by the incorporation of ii ) a single interstitial @xmath4 .",
    "both defective systems are studied separately in the present work .",
    "we use a classical molecular statics technique ( cmst ) and dft calculations using the siesta code @xcite coupled to the monomer method @xcite .",
    "the monomer method coupled to cmst simulations is a much less computationally expensive method , that allows us to compute at low cost a bunch of jump frequencies from which we can perform averages in order to obtain more accurate effective frequencies . on the other hand , when the monomer is coupled to dft calculations , the method is akin to the dimer one from the literature @xcite , but roughly employs half the number of force evaluations which is a great advantage in siesta ab - initio calculations .",
    "we proceed as follows : we calculate the full set of frequencies employing the economic monomer method @xcite .",
    "the monomer @xcite is used to compute the saddle points configurations from which we obtain the jumps frequencies defined in the six - frequency model , in the context of a second nearest neighbors binding model developed by okamura and allnatt @xcite .",
    "then , the full set of phenomenological coefficients are obtained in terms of these six - frequencies . in the frame of the non - equilibrium thermodynamics ,",
    "we obtain the flux equations from which we express analytic expressions for diffusion coefficients .",
    "recently , similar approaches than our have been been performed . for bcc structures , although using a first nearest neighbor shell approximation of the binding between vacancies and solute atoms , was performed by choudhury _",
    ". _ @xcite using vasp .",
    "the authors have calculated the self - diffusion and solute diffusion coefficients in diluted @xmath6 and @xmath7 alloys including an extensive analysis of the phenomenological onsager @xmath8-coefficients for describing segregation .    also , in a first shell binding model , but for fcc structures , we have presented studies of impurity diffusion behavior in nickel - aluminium and aluminium - uranium diluted alloys @xcite . there",
    "we show how the cmst is appropriate in order to describe the impurity diffusion behavior mediated by a vacancy mechanism . in ref .",
    "@xcite , our results with cmst show excellent agreement with those from molecular dynamic calculations for the @xmath9 mobility diluted in @xmath10 .",
    "while , in @xcite , cmst calculations performed in diluted @xmath11 and @xmath12 f.c.c . alloys shows excellent agreement with available experimental data for both systems .",
    "also , in @xcite we have reported for the first time the behavior of diffusion coefficients for the solute - vacancy paired specie , predicting that for @xmath11 the solute diffuses through a vacancy interchange mechanism , while for the @xmath12 system , a vacancy drag mechanism occurs .    in the present work , for cmst calculations the inter - atomic interactions",
    "are represented by suitable eam potentials @xcite , while for dft calculations , we employ the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) for exchange and correlation for @xmath13 and @xmath4 . for diffusion process mediated by vacancies we employ the six - frequency model , in the context of a second nearest neighbors binding model developed by okamura and allnatt @xcite .",
    "it must be noted that this is the first time that such a powerful procedure is employed for real systems .",
    "our cmst calculations for vacancies , reveal that @xmath4 in @xmath13 at diluted concentrations migrates as free species , result that is confirmed by our dft calculation using siesta . in this respect",
    "we conclude that a vacancy drag mechanism is unlikely to occur in bcc @xmath0 in accordance with @xcite .    for the case of diffusion process mediated by interstitials in bcc @xmath0 matrix",
    ", we use the full set of onsager @xmath8-coefficient developed by barbe and nastar @xcite .",
    "our results also show that the diffusion coefficients for the intertitial process are several orders of magnitudes lower than those mediated by vacancies .",
    "this last ones are in good agreement with experimental available data .",
    "then , we can conclude that the diffusion processes is mainly mediated by vacancies .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ s1 ] , for diffusion mediated by a vacancy mechanism",
    ", we briefly introduce the full set of the onsager coefficients calculated by okamura and allnatt @xcite in the second - nearest neighbor binding model for bcc lattices .",
    "analytic expressions of the diffusion coefficients in binary alloys and the corresponding one for the paired species , @xmath14 , all of them in terms of onsager coefficients , are presented in section [ s2 ] .",
    "this allows to express the diffusion coefficients in terms of the frequency jumps .",
    "section [ s3 ] , is devoted to present our numerical results for vacancies using the theoretical procedure previously summarized and making a comparison with available experimental data . for interstitials",
    ", we will not not show here , but we use the theoretical procedure developed by barbe and nastar @xcite .",
    "the last section briefly presents some conclusions .",
    "in the framework of linear non - equilibrium thermodynamics , okamura and allnat @xcite using symmetry types by a suitable classification of the vacancy - a - atom exchange , have obtained analytical expressions for the phenomenological @xmath15 coefficients , from which transport phenomena can be described . in particular , atomic diffusion in @xmath0-alloys",
    "is described through the following parameters , namely : @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 phenomenological coefficients , @xmath19 and @xmath20 the self and tracer solute diffusion coefficients for the solvent @xmath13 and solute @xmath4 species . in this context , the flux @xmath21 of the component @xmath22 relative to the local crystal lattice in an isothermal isotropic crystal is given by @xmath23 when there are not forces acting on the system . in ( [ ji0 ] )",
    "@xmath24 is the chemical potential of component @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the phenomenological coefficients . the main idea of present calculations is to focus attention on transport phenomena of diluted binary alloys , specifically on the corresponding solute transport coefficient and how this is related to the diffusion coefficient through the flux equations ( [ ji0 ] ) . in this way ,",
    "okamura and allnatt give compact expressions for the @xmath15coefficients by treating the contribution of the vacancy - impurity exchanges as a perturbation in evaluating the green function by inversion of a certain reduced matrix @xmath27 ( which will be defined below ) .",
    "in the following , we present the okamura and allnat expressions for the @xmath15coefficients in the particular case of bcc lattices @xcite , in terms of the frequency rates in the context of the six frequency model @xcite . in this way , the effect of different vacancy exchange mechanisms on solute diffusion can easily be understood .",
    "we assume that the perturbation of the solute movement by a vacancy @xmath28 , is limited to its immediate vicinity .",
    "established the @xmath29-nearest - neighbor binding model , we identify the frequencies as follows @xcite :    * \\(i ) @xmath30 for exchange with a @xmath4 atom , * \\(ii ) @xmath31 for exchange with a @xmath13 atom when initially the @xmath13 is an @xmath32-n.n .",

    "in summary , in this work the diffusion properties in bcc @xmath0 diluted alloys have been studied .",
    "the diffusion processes here considered can be mediated by vacancies as well as by interstitials .",
    "the flux equations permits to relates the diffusion coefficients with the onsager tensor .",
    "kinetic theory allows to write this onsager coefficients in terms of jump frequencies . in this way",
    "we could write expressions for the diffusion coefficients only in terms of microscopic magnitudes , i.e. the jump frequencies .    in this context , for the case of a diffusion process mediated by vacancies , in this work we use for the first time in a real system , the approach developed by okamura and allnatt @xcite .",
    "this procedure , is known as the six frequencies model and involves a second nearest neighbor binding approach . on the other hand for the case of the diffusion mediated by instestitials ,",
    "the recent procedure developed by barbe and nastar @xcite is here employed .",
    "the needed frequencies involved in the onsager coefficients for both vacancies and interstitial mechanisms have been calculated thanks to the economic technique namely the monomer method coupled to cmst and dft calculations , this last one using siesta .",
    "the results employing either cmst or dft calculations are similar , which confirms the advantage of the lower cost cmst methods that were already reported in @xcite .    the vacancy tracer diffusion coefficient for @xmath0",
    "were also compared with available experimental data obtaining a good agreement with the here described theory .",
    "however in comparison with results obtained within the first coordinated shell approach @xcite the diffusion coefficients here described up to second coordinate neighbor are several orders of magnitudes higher , showing the need for the description of the diffusion process beyond the first shell approximation .",
    "also the present cmst calculations , confirmed by dft results , reveal that @xmath4 in @xmath13 at diluted concentrations migrates as free species which implies that a vacancy drag mechanism is unlikely to occur in bcc @xmath0 within the present approach .    for the case of the diffusion coefficients mediated by interstitial mechanism , although the results obtained here are in accordance with those in @xcite they are four orders of magnitudes lower than the vacancy diffusion coefficients and than experimental data .",
    "hence we can conclude that for the @xmath0 diluted alloys the diffusion process is mainly due to a vacancy mechanism .",
    "recently , garnier _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , have obtained analytic expressions for diffusion coefficients in binary alloys with bcc structure .",
    "the authors have investigated the drag of solute atoms by vacancies at low temperatures , using a self - consistent mean field method .",
    "the method takes into account interactions between the solute atom and a vacancy up to the third nearest neighbor sites .",
    "analytic results have identified the mechanism involved in the solute drag by vacancies .",
