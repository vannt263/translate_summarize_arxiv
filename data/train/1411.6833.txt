    "] attracts much attention nowadays .",
    "a few years ago heinke & ho @xcite have analyzed chandra observation data during 10 years and reported an anomalous steady decline of the surface temperature , @xmath0 .",
    "the authors have interpreted this data as a direct observation of cas a ns cooling , the phenomenon which has never been observed before for any isolated ns .",
    "we shall discuss later the current state of these observations , at the moment we note that although the real cooling rate is under debate one can not exclude that the cas a ns cooling is extraordinarily fast .",
    "even a @xmath1 decline of the cooling curve in 10 years would signal very fast cooling .",
    "such a rapid drop in surface temperature ( if it occurs ) is in conflict with standard cooling scenarios based on the efficient modified urca process . if the ns in cas a underwent standard cooling ( through neutrino emission from the core due to the modified urca process ) its surface temperature decline in 10 years would be @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the rapid decline but relatively high surface temperature ( about @xmath3 k ) require a dramatic change in the neutrino emission properties of the ns . some exotic scenarios of cooling have been suggested that employ nonstandard assumptions on ns physics and evolution , involving softened pion modes @xcite , quarks @xcite , axions @xcite or cooling after an r - mode heating process @xcite .",
    "an existence of softened pions or quarks in the ns core depends mostly on the matter density but not on the temperature .",
    "if this rapid cooling was constant from the birth of the ns , the current temperature would have to be much smaller than is currently measured .",
    "it is reasonable to suggest @xcite that the cooling was initially slow but greatly accelerated later . in this case",
    "the rapid temperature decline could be naturally explainable in a frame of the minimal cooling paradigm @xcite that assumes that rapid cooling of the neutron star is triggered by neutron superfluidity in the core .",
    "this scenario implies that neutrons have recently become superfluid ( in @xmath4p@xmath5 triplet - state ) in the ns core , triggering a huge neutrino flux from pair breaking and formation ( pbf ) processes that accelerates the cooling @xcite , while protons were already in a superconducting @xmath6s@xmath7 singlet - state with a larger critical temperature .",
    "although the above mechanism is consistent with the commonly accepted cooling paradigm , the theoretical simulation has shown @xcite , that the pbf processes in the neutron triplet condensate are not enough effective to explain the rapid temperature decline .",
    "this has stimulated the present work .",
    "it is commonly believed @xcite that the pair condensation in the superdense neutron matter occurs into the @xmath4p@xmath5 state ( with a small admixture of @xmath4f@xmath5 ) with a preferred magnetic quantum number @xmath8 .",
    "this model has been conventionally used for estimates of the pbf neutrino energy losses in the minimal cooling scenarios .",
    "let us remind that , in the case of @xmath4p@xmath9 pairing , the pbf @xmath10 emissivity is evaluated as @xcite ( we use natural units , @xmath11 ) : @xmath12where @xmath13 gev@xmath14 is the fermi coupling constant , @xmath15 is the axial - vector coupling constant of neutrons , @xmath16 is the fermi momentum of neutrons , @xmath17 is the neutron effective mass ; the function @xmath18 is given by @xmath19where @xmath20 , and the superfluid energy gap , @xmath21is anisotropic .",

    "i argue that the enlarged neutrino energy losses can be explained in terms of the conventional minimal cooling paradigm assuming that the enhanced neutrino radiation can be a natural consequence of the phase transition of the @xmath4p@xmath5 condensate into a multicomponent state .",
    "modern calculations @xcite have shown that , besides the one - component state with @xmath23 , there are also multicomponent @xmath4p@xmath24 states involving several magnetic quantum numbers @xmath25 that compete in energy and represent various phases of the condensate in equilibriump@xmath9 condensed neutron superfluid @xcite . these collective excitations represent small angular oscillations of the condensate .",
    "the complete set of the oscillation modes of the @xmath4p@xmath9 condensate in the superfluid neutron liquid is analyzed in @xcite .",

    "@xcite this scenario puts stringent constraints on the temperature for the onset of neutron superfluidity in the cas a ns .",
    "namely , the transition temperature dependence on the density should have a wide peak with maximum @xmath61  k.    in the temperature range which we are interested in , the thermal luminosity of the surface is negligible in comparison to the neutrino luminosity of pbf processes in the ns core . in this case",

    "a thermally relaxed star has an isothermal interior which extends from the center to the heat blanketing envelope .",
    "following @xcite we have assumed that the isothermal region is restricted by the condition @xmath72 @xmath73 .",
