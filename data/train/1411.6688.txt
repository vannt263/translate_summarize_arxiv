    "in particular , since the threshold for percolation in @xmath30 is trivial , their argument can not say anything about percolation in the @xmath9-dimensional poisson graph @xmath31 .",

    "[ question1 ] is it true that percolation in @xmath31 occurs a.s . , if and only if , @xmath4 has support only on the even integers ?    in this paper we prove the following theorem , answering question  [ question1 ] negatively :    [ main ] there exist degree distributions @xmath4 with support on the odd integers , such that the stable multi - matching process a.s",

    "furthermore , we show in remark [ answerquestion2 ] that for any @xmath6 we can construct such a degree distribution @xmath4 with @xmath7 , thus also answering question  [ question2 ] negatively .",
    "we note however that the distribution @xmath4 we construct has unbounded support ; it would be interesting to find an example with bounded support only .",
    "the idea behind the proof of theorem  [ main ] is to set @xmath33 for a sharply increasing sequence of integers @xmath34 .",
    "suppose we are given a vertex @xmath35 with degree @xmath36 . by choosing @xmath37 large enough",
    "we can ensure that with probability close to @xmath9 , there exists some vertex @xmath38 with @xmath39 that is connected to @xmath40 by an edge of @xmath5 .",

    "starting from a vertex @xmath44 of degree @xmath45 , we see that if @xmath46 occurs , then there is an infinite path @xmath47 in @xmath5 . if the events @xmath48 were independent of each other , then @xmath49 , which we could make strictly positive by letting the sequence @xmath34 grow sufficiently quickly , ensuring in turn that percolation occurs a.s .. of course the events @xmath48 as we have loosely defined them above are highly dependent .",
    "we circumvent this problem by working with a sequence of slightly more restricted events , for which we do have full independence . as we have no restrictions on the @xmath37 other than their growth rate , each of them can be chosen to be odd or even as we please .",

    "set @xmath56 and @xmath57 for each @xmath58 .",
    "suppose that we condition on a particular vertex @xmath35 of degree @xmath37 belonging to the point process @xmath1 .",
    "( formally , we consider a palm version of @xmath1 , i.e. a version of @xmath1 conditioned on @xmath59 , with the rest of the process taken as a stationary background .",
    "note that the palm version of a homogeneous poisson process has the same distribution as the unconditioned process itself with an added point ; see  ( * ? ?",

    "we condition further on there being at most @xmath60 points of @xmath1 in the interval of length @xmath61 centered at @xmath35 , and write @xmath62 for the event we are conditioning on . by the standard properties of poisson point processes , conditioning on @xmath62 does not affect the probability of any event defined outside the interval .",
    "let @xmath63 be the event that there is a vertex @xmath64 with degree @xmath65 such that @xmath66 .",
    "viewing @xmath1 as the union of two thinned poisson point processes , one of intensity @xmath67 giving us the vertices of degree @xmath65 and another of intensity @xmath68 giving us the rest of the vertices , we see that @xmath69 .",
    "if @xmath63 occurs , let @xmath38 denote the a.s .",
    "unique vertex of degree @xmath65 which is nearest to @xmath35 among those degree @xmath65 vertices lying at distance at least @xmath70 from @xmath35 .",
    "let @xmath71 be the event that there are at most @xmath60 vertices @xmath72 with @xmath73 .",
    "furthermore , given a point @xmath13 ( not necessarily belonging to our process @xmath1 ) with @xmath74 , we let @xmath75 be the event that there are at most @xmath76 vertices @xmath0 lying at distance at least @xmath77 from @xmath35 and at most @xmath78 from @xmath13 . a quick calculation",

    "finally let @xmath81 .",
    "if @xmath82 occurs , then @xmath35 and @xmath38 are strongly connected , since our initial assumption @xmath62 together with @xmath71 tells us that @xmath83 , while @xmath62 together with @xmath84 yield that @xmath85 ( see figure  1 ) .",
    "this last statement is exactly our initial conditioning @xmath62 with @xmath86 replaced by @xmath87 ; hence @xmath88 .    by the union bound , we have @xmath89 selecting @xmath90 sufficiently large and some arbitrary vertex @xmath91 of degree @xmath92 as a starting point",
    ", we may define events @xmath93 inductively , each conditional on its predecessors , with @xmath94 from any vertex @xmath95 there is , with strictly positive probability , an infinite path in @xmath5 , @xmath96 through vertices of increasing degrees @xmath97 .",
    "it follows that @xmath5 a.s .  contains a strongly connected infinite component .",
    "the pairs @xmath98 remain strongly connected if we increase the degrees .",
    "thus , if a given degree distribution @xmath4 a.s .",
    "results in a strongly connected infinite component in @xmath99 , then any degree distribution @xmath100 that stochastically dominates @xmath4 will also a.s .  yield a strongly connected infinite component in @xmath101 .",

    "percolates , though all vertices have odd degrees .",
    "[ answerquestion2 ] note that our proof of theorem  [ main ] does not use any information about @xmath37 for @xmath105 .",
    "in particular , we could set @xmath106 and @xmath107 for @xmath108 and still have a distribution for which @xmath5 percolates a.s .. choosing @xmath90 sufficiently large , this implies a negative answer to question  [ question2 ] .",
    "[ dim2 ] the existence of degree distributions that a.s .",

    "our proof of theorem  [ main ] for @xmath110 easily adapts to higher dimensions @xmath111 ( with @xmath21-dimensional balls and annuli replacing intervals and punctured intervals , and the sequence @xmath112 being scaled accordingly ) , giving a different approach to the construction of examples in that setting .",
    "the distribution @xmath4 we construct in theorem  [ main ] has unbounded support , and the expected degree of a vertex in @xmath99 is infinite .",
    "we believe however that the answer to questions  [ question2 ] and  [ question1 ] should still remain negative if @xmath4 is required to have bounded support . indeed we conjecture the following :",

    "now , pick @xmath6 and choose @xmath122 .",
    "let @xmath4 be a degree distribution with support on @xmath123 , such that the expected degree satisfies @xmath124",
    ". by definition of @xmath115 this would imply @xmath99 a.s .  does not percolate .",
    "assign degrees independently at random to the vertices of @xmath99 .",
    "perform the first @xmath125 stages of the stable multi - matching process . by then most degree",
    "@xmath9 vertices have been matched ( and in fact matched to other degree @xmath9 vertices ) .",
    "now force the remaining degree @xmath9 vertices to match to their future partners .",
    "consider the vertices that had originally been assigned @xmath126 edge stubs .",
    "a number of these edge stubs will have been used up by the process so far , and the number of edge stubs left at each vertex is not independent ; nevertheless we expect most degree @xmath126 vertices will have at least @xmath127 edge stubs left , and that the number of stubs left will be almost independently distributed .",
    "thus , we believe the stable multi - matching scheme on the remaining edge stubs of the degree @xmath126 vertices will contain as a subgraph the edges of a stable multi - matching scheme on a thinned poisson point process on @xmath2 corresponding to the degree @xmath126 vertices , and with degrees given by some random variable @xmath128 with @xmath129 .",
