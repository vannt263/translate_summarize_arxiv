    "we place a single lithographed shorting strap connecting the two ground planes at the midpoint of each resonator to improve the quality of the grounding .",
    "this point is a voltage node for the fundamental half - wave resonant mode , so that there is minimal additional dielectric loss from the shorting strap s underlying amorphous si insulating film @xcite .    in the circuit layout , the coupling resonator @xmath1 is designed to have a higher resonance frequency than the two state storage resonators @xmath4 and @xmath5",
    "this prevents the qubit frequencies from having to cross the @xmath1 resonator frequency during noon state amplification .",
    "the two storage resonators @xmath4 and @xmath5 are designed with slightly different resonance frequencies , to avoid possible interference between the resonators .",
    "the full frequency span in the design was chosen to be about @xmath84 mhz , within the dynamic range of our custom microwave electronics .",
    "the two superconducting phase qubits and coplanar waveguide resonators are fabricated together , using our standard multi - layer process @xcite .",
    "we use interdigitated coupling capacitors between the qubits and the resonators , calculated to each have a coupling capacitance of 1.9 ff .",

    "these errors are found to be small , in part because the constraints on the analysis filters unrealistic values .",
    "instead we find that slow phase drifts in the electronics , perhaps dominated by ambient temperature fluctuations , give the main phase uncertainties , especially during long measurements . evaluating a single density matrix usually takes a relatively short time during which these drifts are minimal .",
    "however , measuring a series of density matrices such as fig .",

    "we use a synthetic ensemble of mixed states to illustrate the hazards involved in relying purely on coincidence measurements for demonstrating noon - state entanglement .",
    "the ensemble comprises a mixture of 50% @xmath92 and 50% @xmath93 states , i.e. , an ensemble with the same probability of being measured in either of the states forming the @xmath11 noon state , but without any entanglement .",
    "this is done by generating the pure state @xmath92 and measuring the time - dependent joint probabilities @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 , and @xmath97 for this state .",
    "we then generate the other component of the ensemble , the pure state @xmath93 , and repeat the generation and measurement procedure .",

    "we then combine the measurement results with equal weights , creating the joint probabilities for the synthetic ensemble ; these data are shown in the main paper .",

    "the outcome of the ensemble measurements are shown in the main text , with the joint probabilities evolving in a way indistinguishable from the entangled noon states , but the density matrix for the ensemble revealing a complete lack of entanglement , as witnessed by the negligible values for the off - diagonal elements .",
