    "in recent years , developments in the field of ultracold atomic gases have considerably enlarged the possibilities for exploring the physics of strongly correlated systems  @xcite .",
    "for instance , the study of quantum phase transitions , a subject of continuous theoretical interest , has been strongly stimulated by the experimental observation of the superfluid to mott insulator transition using optical lattices  @xcite .",
    "indeed , ultracold atom systems offer us an unprecedented control over the system parameters , which can allow us to ultimately understand the physics of very hard problems such as the phase diagram of the hubbard model in two - dimensions  @xcite .",
    "a particularly interesting and fertile arena is the study of disordered ultra - cold atoms .",
    "random potentials can be introduced in a controlled way by laser beams generating speckle patterns  @xcite , or by loading in an optical lattice a mixture of two kinds of atoms , one heavy and one light . when the heavy atoms become randomly localized in the lattice , they will act as impurities for the lighter atoms  @xcite .",
    "another available technique is to superimpose two optical lattices with incommensurate periodicities , thus generating a quasi - periodic potential  @xcite .",
    "the quasi - periodic lattices as well as the speckle patterns have been recently used in the experimental efforts to observe the effects of anderson localization in dilute bose gases expanding in highly elongated traps  @xcite . since",
    "anderson localization is a single - particle effect , the next logical step is to study the interplay of disorder and interactions in strongly interacting ultra - cold atomic systems  @xcite .",
    "the latter may be accessible by tuning interparticle interactions using feshbach resonances  @xcite , or by loading the atoms in sufficiently deep optical lattices@xcite and/or strongly confining them to low - dimensions in tight traps  @xcite .    in the context of the efforts described above ,",
    "one of the experimental challenges is to observe in ultra - cold gases clear signatures of the theoretically - predicted transition from a superfluid to the bose - glass phase  @xcite .",
    "a pioneering step in this direction was recently taken by the florence group by using lattice modulation spectroscopy  @xcite .",
    "this technique consists in heating an ultra - cold gas loaded in a optical lattice by periodically modulating the depth of the lattice  @xcite . when perturbed in this way , the gas is driven out of equilibrium and absorbs energy . when the perturbation is switched off , and after re - thermalization , the broadening of the momentum distribution around zero momentum is taken as a measure of the energy absorbed by the system during the lattice modulation  @xcite .",
    "on the theory side , for non - disordered lattices , the calculation of the energy absorption rate due to the lattice modulation was first performed analytically within linear response theory by some of the present authors  @xcite .",
    "these results were confirmed and extended beyond linear response using time - dependent density - matrix renormalization group methods , both for the case of bosons  @xcite and fermions  @xcite .",
    "more recently , for disordered optical lattices , the energy absorption rate has been numerically calculated using full diagonalization in small systems  @xcite .",
    "other methods that have also been discussed in the literature for detecting signatures of the effect of disorder ( or quasi - periodicity ) on interacting boson systems in one dimension focus on the momentum distribution  @xcite in disordered systems as well as quasi - periodic systems or the expansion dynamics in quasi - periodic systems  @xcite .",

    "we have repeated the calculations of the absorption spectrum including @xmath214 and the result is shown in fig  [ fig : trap ] . for a system of hard - core bosons in the absence of disorder or quasi - periodic potential , the trap favors the formation of a mott insulator in the center surrounded by a superfluid region at the trap edges .",
    "this gives rise to a finite absorption at low frequency ( see inset in the upper panel ) , which is related to the creation of excitations at the edge of the trap . by contrast , in a uniform system of hard - core bosons , as we have described in sect .",
    "[ sec : sec2 ] the energy absorption vanishes to all orders because the hopping operator @xmath48 commutes with the hamiltonian .",
    "let us next consider the effect of a small amount of disorder or a weak quasi - periodic potential .",
    "clearly the mott insulator at the center of the trap can not absorb energy at low frequency , so the only contribution comes from the outer shell , where the filling factor is less than unity .",
    "in particular the low frequency peak arising from edge excitations fragments in multiple peaks with little spectral weight compared to the response from the bulk discussed in sections  [ sec : random ] and  [ sec : sec4 ] .",
    "we also see in fig .",
    "[ fig : trap ] that the behavior of the absorption spectrum at frequencies close to the bandwidth crucially depends on whether the applied potential is truly random or quasi - periodic .",
    "whereas the disordered case exhibits a smooth behavior in the absorption up to the bandwidth @xmath218 where it falls to zero , the quasi - periodic one shows a sharp peak located at the bandwidth @xmath219 which resembles the divergence found in the corresponding homogeneous case .",
    "note that the position of this peak is almost independent on the number of atoms in the tube and therefore , the peak should be visible in a realistic experimental situation where an average over a multiple tube setup with variable filling is performed .",

    "[ fig : trap ] . for @xmath220 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : trap ] , middle panel ) the peak structure in the quasi - periodic case is more complex , and thus the averaging procedure will produce some rounding off of the peaks .",

    "the inset in the upper panel shows the low frequency absorption in the absence of disorder , which is finite for trapped gases .",
    "as @xmath10 increases , this sharp peak fragments out and is no longer visible on the scale of the bulk contribution . ]",
    "in conclusion we have investigated the energy absorbed by a disordered strongly interacting bose gas in the presence of periodically modulated optical lattices . for filling factor less than one",
    ", the absorption rate has been calculated exactly in the hard - core limit via the bose - fermi mapping . for commensurate filling , corresponding to one boson per lattice site , the gas is a mott insulator and can only absorbs energy at much higher frequency ( of the order of the repulsive interaction @xmath5 ) .",
    "the disorder induced broadening of the absorption spectrum has been calculated by restricting to the subspace of particle - hole excitations .",
    "we have performed extensive calculations comparing two different sources of disorder : a random potential , which is relevant for current experiments based on speckle patterns , and a quasiperiodic potential , which is obtained by superimposing two optical lattices with incommensurate periods .",
