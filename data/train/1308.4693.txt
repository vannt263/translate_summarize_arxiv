    "<S> fret spectroscopy is widely used , e.g. , in studies of protein folding @xcite , live cell protein localization @xcite , biosensing @xcite , and light harvesting @xcite .    during past decade </S>",
    "<S> , significant advances were made in et enhancement and control by placing molecules or qds in microcavities @xcite or near plasmonic materials such as metal films and nanoparticles ( nps ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> while frster transfer is efficient only for relatively short donor - acceptor separations @xmath010 nm @xcite , a plasmon - mediated transfer channel supported by metal nps @xcite , films and waveguides @xcite or doped monolayer graphene @xcite , can significant increase the transition rate at larger distances between donor and acceptor . </S>",
    "<S> at the same time , dissipation in metal and plasmon - enhanced radiation reduce the fraction of donor s energy available for transfer to the acceptor . in a closely related phenomenon of plasmon - enhanced fluorescence from a single fluorophore @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> the interplay between dissipation and radiation channels , which determines fluorophore s quantum efficiency , depends sensitively on its distance to the metal surface @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a nearby acceptor will absorb some of the donor fluorophore energy via three main transfer channels : frster channel , non - radiative plasmon - mediated channel , and plasmon - enhanced radiative channel , the latter being dominant for intermediate distances @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the fraction of the donor energy absorbed by the acceptor is then determined by an interplay between transfer , radiation and dissipation channels , so that an increase of et efficiency implies either increase of the transfer rate or reduction of the dissipation and/or radiation rates .    here </S>",
    "<S> we describe a novel _ cooperative amplification _ </S>",
    "<S> mechanism for et from an _ ensemble _ of donors to acceptors that takes advantage of the subtle balance between energy flow channels in a plasmonic system . in a typical experimental setup , </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : rad20 ] ) . if the donors separation from the metal surface is not so small that dissipation is the dominant channel , then the donors coupling through np plasmons gives rise to new system eigenstates  superradiant and subradiant states @xcite , which , in the presence of a np , are considerably more robust due to a strong plasmonic enhancement of radiative coupling @xcite . in this case , et to an acceptor takes place from these collective states rather than from each of many individual donors . </S>",
    "<S> importantly , the energy flows in a system in the cooperative regime differ dramatically from those in a system of individual donors . </S>",
    "<S> while a few superradiant states carry only a small fraction of donors energy , the large matrix element with external electric fields leads to a huge decay rate that scales with the system size . in a similar manner , </S>",
    "<S> the large coupling of superradiant states with the electric field of an acceptor spatially separated from the donor layer increases the transfer rate and ensures , as we demonstrate below , a much more efficient plasmon - assisted et than from the same number of individual donors .     </S>",

    "<S> importantly , here the reduction of losses does not require continuous pumping to sustain loss compensation by gain medium , but takes place `` naturally '' due to plasmon exchanges by the donors .    to pinpoint the origin of cooperative amplification , consider et from a single donor to an acceptor near a metal nanostructure . </S>",

    "<S> we assume that the donors and acceptor s dipole orientations are all normal to the np surface and their respective emission and absorption bands are lorentzians of width 0.1 ev centered at energies @xmath32 and @xmath33 . </S>",

    "<S> et for each donor - acceptor set is compared to et calculated for individual donors and all curves are normalized per donor . </S>",
    "<S> for relatively thin shells , the individual donor approximation yields significantly higher et for set 1 since it neglects plasmon exchanges between the donors and hence underestimates the dissipation , while et for set 2 is suppressed by very strong dissipation in the high-_l _ plasmon region . with increasing shell thickness , as donors move away from the metal core , the system transitions to the cooperative regime @xcite and et from _ superradiant _ states ( set 1 ) </S>",
    "<S> overtakes et from individual donors due to the much stronger coupling to the acceptor , as discussed above . at the same time , et from _ subradiant _ states emerges ( set 2 ) and , for thicker shells , significantly exceeds et from individual donors due to the much slower decay rates . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , the superradiant and subradiant amplification mechanisms can be utilized independently in different energy domains .    for larger </S>",
    "<S> np , the et amplification sharply increases ( see fig .  [ fig : rad30 ] ) due to a stronger plasmon - enhanced radiative coupling between the donors @xcite that leads to a more robust cooperative regime @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the peak enhancement for both set 1 and set 2 relative to individual donors reaches @xmath38 for the largest np . </S>",
    "<S> the crossover to the cooperative regime is determined by the ratio of shell thickness to core radius ( @xmath39 ) rather than by shell thickness alone , and therefore et for @xmath26 nm core np overtakes et from individual donors at thicker shells ( compare figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : rad20 ] and [ fig : rad30 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> importantly , the evolution of cooperative et and of et from individual donors with increasing shell thickness show opposite trends : the former _ increases _ with thickness while the latter is reduced . </S>",
    "<S> the role of cooperative effects is most pronounced in frequency - integrated et relative to that for individual donors ( amplification factor ) . </S>",
    "<S> this shows a dramatic et increase for larger np at similar values of shell / core ratio ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : ampl ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the onset of the cooperative regime corresponds to amplification factor @xmath40 and takes place at shell / core ratio @xmath40 . with increasing shell thickness </S>",
    "<S> , amplification factor reaches @xmath41 for 20 nm core np and @xmath42 for 30 nm core np .    with further increase of np size , et amplification </S>",
    "<S> should eventually saturate and , as the system size exceeds the radiation wavelength @xmath43 ( @xmath44 nm in our case ) , scale back to @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , as system size approaches @xmath43 , the plasmonic field enhancement weakens due to retardation effects and the cooperative regime is destroyed by the dissipation effects @xcite . the optimal np size for cooperative amplification of et is expected to be similar to that for plasmon - enhanced fluorescence @xcite .    </S>",
