    "the unitary regime is the situation in which the scattering length @xmath0 is much larger than the average inter - particle distance : @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the number density@xcite . at zero temperature , systems in this regime",
    "are widely believed to be superfluid , with a coherence length and an inter - particle distance of comparable magnitude .",
    "such zero temperature problem has been considered by several authors@xcite .",
    "it was shown experimentally in 2002 that these systems are ( meta)stable , and they have been extensively studied ever since@xcite . from the theoretical point of view , the typical treatment is based on an idea put forward by eagles , leggett and others@xcite .",
    "their approach assumes a bcs - like form for the many - body wave function , which is then used for all values of @xmath0 .",
    "the main problem with this treatment is that , close to the unitary regime , the fraction of non - condensed pairs becomes of order one@xcite , and so a mean field description becomes questionable ( even including fluctuations ) .    to determine the thermal properties of fermions in the unitary regime ,",
    "we have placed the system on a 3d cubic spatial lattice , with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "since the system under consideration is dilute , the interaction that captures the physical situation is a zero - range two - body interaction @xmath3 , with a momentum cut - off @xmath4 .",
    "details of the method can be found in ref .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     at resonance , universality allows us to estimate the entropy as @xmath5 , see fig .",
    "the knowledge of @xmath6 allows to establish a temperature scale at unitarity . extending the suggestion of ref .",
    "@xcite , from known @xmath7 in the bcs limit , one determines the corresponding @xmath8 . by",
    "adiabatically tuning the system to the unitary regime one can use @xmath9 to determine @xmath7 in the unitary regime . especially at very low temperature ,",
    "our results show relatively large errors in @xmath10 due to both statistical and finite size effects .",
    "summarizing , we performed a fully non - perturbative calculation of the thermal properties of a system of spin 1/2 fermions at unitarity .",
    "we determined the critical temperature for superfluidity to be @xmath11 .",
    "the thermodynamic behavior of this system presents a number of unexpected features , suggesting that spin 1/2 fermions in the bcs - bec crossover qualify as a new type of superfluid .",
