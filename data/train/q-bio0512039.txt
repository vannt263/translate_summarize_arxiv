    "since lotka and volterra s seminal and pioneering works @xcite , many decades ago , modeling of interacting , competing species has received considerable attention in the fields of biology , ecology , mathematics @xcite , and , more recently , in the physics literature as well @xcite . in their remarkably simple deterministic model , lotka and volterra considered two coupled nonlinear differential equations that mimic the temporal evolution of a two - species system of competing predator and prey populations .",
    "they demonstrated that coexistence of both species was not only possible but inevitable in their model .",
    "moreover , similar to observations in real populations , both predator and prey densities in this deterministic system display regular oscillations in time , with both the amplitude and the period determined by the prescribed initial conditions ( only near the center fixed point associated with the coexistence of the two populations is the oscillation frequency solely given in terms of the intrinsic interaction rates , see sec .",
    "ii.a below ) .",
    "however , despite the undisputed mathematical elegance of these results , and its consequent ubiquity in textbooks @xcite , the original lotka  volterra model ( lvm ) is often severely criticized on the grounds of being biologically too simplistic and therefore unrealistic @xcite , and mathematically unstable with respect to model modifications @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we aim at drawing a comprehensive , detailed picture of the _ stochastic _ dynamics , defined on a @xmath0-dimensional lattice , of two competing populations with lotka  volterra type predation interaction .",
    "the systems under consideration are ` individual - based ' lattice models , where each lattice site can be occupied by a given ( finite ) number of particles .",
    "we shall formulate the _",
    "stochastic lattice lotka  volterra model _ ( sllvm ) in the natural language of a reaction  diffusion lattice gas model , i.e. , in terms of appropriate stochastic particle hopping and creation and annihilation processes defined on a lattice , and will here investigate them by means of various methods of the theory of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics , including mean - field approximations , monte carlo computer simulations , field - theoretic representations and renormalization group arguments . with these techniques , we are thus able to consider and discuss the role of spatial constraints , spatio - temporal fluctuations and correlations , and finite - size effects",
    ". we shall argue that although the criticisms against the classical lvm definitely pertain to the original deterministic rate equations , introducing spatial degrees of freedom and allowing for stochasticity @xcite actually renders the corresponding two - species reaction system considerably richer , definitely more interesting , and perhaps even more realistic .",
    "in addition , in stark contrast with the deterministic lvm , the sllvm scenario turns out to be remarkably robust with respect to model modifications , and thus appears to provide a quite generic picture of two - species predator - prey interactions .    in recent years",
    ", population dynamics has received considerable attention from the statistical physics community . in particular ,",
    "a variety of so - called ` individual - based ' , or stochastic , lattice predator - prey models have been investigated , e.g. , in refs .",

    "@xcite , the authors considered various two - species four - state models ( in the absence of diffusion , each lattice site is either empty , occupied by a single predator or prey , or by both a predator and prey ) and noticed that both extinction and coexistence of the two populations are possible .",
    "they found that there exists a sharp continuous transition between the predator extinction phase and the active predator  prey coexistence phase .",
    "numerical studies of the ( static ) critical properties near the predator extinction threshold ( mainly in one and two dimensions ) revealed that its critical exponents are consistent with those of dp @xcite ( see below ) .",
    "in addition , in refs .",
    "@xcite the oscillatory behavior displayed by the densities of the coexisting populations in some region of the active parameter space was studied as well .",
    "it was reported that in one and two dimensions the population densities showed characteristic erratic oscillations whose amplitude vanishes in the thermodynamic limit ( even in the presence of long - range interactions ) , while it was argued that the oscillation amplitude may remain _ finite _ in three dimensions @xcite .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite considered a non - diffusive three - state model ( each site can be empty , or occupied either by a predator or a prey ) interacting according to a _",
    "cyclic _ scheme .",
    "this system can in fact be mapped onto the so - called ` rock - scissors - paper ' ( or three - state cyclic lotka ",
    "volterra ) model @xcite , well - known in the field of game theory @xcite .",
    "the ( mean - field ) rate equations associated with that model actually admit a constant of motion @xcite which in turn implies cycles in the phase portrait , describing regular oscillations of the densities of predators and prey .",
    "however , numerical simulations of the stochastic version of that model on two - dimensional lattices led to a completely different behavior : the system was shown to display erratic oscillations whose amplitude vanished on a global scale for large lattices , but which were reported to persist on a smaller scale .",
    "these were explained in ref .",
    "@xcite as being associated with ` small oscillators ' ( actually fluctuations ) that are out of phase .",
    "also , the fractal dimension of the patterns developed on the square lattice as result of the spatial fluctuations of the reactants was investigated @xcite .",
    "we also would like to mention that boccara et al .",
    "@xcite studied a two - dimensional automaton network predator - prey model ( a three - state system ) with parallel updating for all the reactions except for ` smart motion ' ( updated sequentially ) of the predators ( prey ) which propagate toward the direction of highest ( lowest ) prey ( predator ) density .",
    "the authors of ref .  @xcite studied the phase portrait , finding a stable coexistence state which may exhibit noisy cyclic behavior associated with complex patterns , and computing critical exponents , which in some regime are in reasonable agreement with the dp values .",
    "later , other authors @xcite considered the two - dimensional lattice - gas ( with sequential updating ) version of the model introduced by boccara et al . and studied numerically its phase diagram and critical properties , finding again results consistent with the dp universality class .",
    "in addition , for the two - dimensional model of refs .",
    "@xcite , rozenfeld and albano argued that , in good agreement with mean - field results , there exists a region of the phase diagram where the densities of species `` exhibit self - sustained oscillations '' , with amplitudes that remain finite in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "as such a result was somewhat surprising , but could stem from the long - range interaction between predators and prey displayed in the model of refs .",
    "@xcite , lipowski , willing also to test the general validity of the scenario outlined in refs .",
    "@xcite , checked that the range of interaction did _ not _ affect the characteristics of the oscillatory behavior displayed in two dimensions by the model of ref .",
    "@xcite : actually , the amplitude of the oscillations was always found to vanish in the thermodynamic limit .    before specifying",
    "further on two - species ( stochastic ) predator  prey models , for the sake of completeness we give a brief overview of some properties of the _ multi - species _ lotka  volterra rate equations .",
    "in general , for @xmath1 particle or population species the latter read ( with @xmath2 ) @xcite : @xmath3 where @xmath4 denotes the species @xmath5 , the @xmath6 are the intrinsic growth ( @xmath7 ) or decay ( @xmath8 ) rates , and @xmath9 represents the _ interaction _ matrix that encodes the competition ` reaction ' between species @xmath5 and @xmath10 . for general @xmath9 and an arbitrary number @xmath11 of species ,",
    "many questions remain wide open .",
    "one of the most intriguing ( and less understood ) features is the fact that the deterministic equations ( [ genlv ] ) may generate _ chaotic _",
    "behavior already for only three species ( @xmath12 ) @xcite . in the case",
    "where @xmath13 , and thus @xmath14 ( which means that there is no nonlinear interaction within the same species ) , it has been shown that eq .",
    "( [ genlv ] ) allows for a constant of motion ( conserved first integral ) @xcite . nonetheless , also in this situation , for an even number of species with @xmath15 it was demonstrated that eq .",
    "( [ genlv ] ) can display chaotic behavior resembling hamiltonian chaos @xcite .",
    "we also mention that when three or more species are in _ cyclic _ competition according to a dynamics described by eqs .",
    "( [ genlv ] ) , i.e. , the rate equations are invariant under cyclic permutations of the species , quite intriguing behavior may emerge : for some time it looks as if one species were bound to become the unique ` survivor ' ; then its density drops and it is replaced with another apparently dominant species , and after some time a third species seems to become dominant , and so on cyclically , involving all @xmath1 species @xcite .    in the case of a food chain with @xmath1 components , where there is interaction ( competition ) among agents of the same species and where the first species serves as the prey for the second , which is the prey of the third and so on , the only nonzero entries of the interaction matrix of eq .",
    "( [ genlv ] ) are @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) , and also @xmath20 , @xmath8 for @xmath21 . in this case , it is known @xcite that the situation with @xmath22 is generic and already captures the features of the multi - species system . in sec .",
    "ii.c we shall discuss in detail the properties of a system [ eqs .",
    "( [ eominter],[eominter1 ] ) ] which can be recast into the above two - species case .",
    "little is known as yet about spatial multi - species lotka  volterra systems defined on lattices , where spatial fluctuations generally invalidate ( at least in low dimensions ) the predictions from the mean - field rate equations ( [ genlv ] ) .",

    "( [ genlv ] ) to the langevin equations for multi - species directed percolation processes , whose critical properties were shown by janssen to be generically described by the dp universality class @xcite .",
    "a remarkable exception is the stochastic cyclic lotka ",
    "volterra model @xcite , mimicking a simple cyclic food chain of length @xmath1 , where the species @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) react according to the scheme @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 .",
    "for this system , frachebourg and krapivsky @xcite showed analytically ( within a so - called kirkwood decoupling scheme ) , and confirmed numerically , that in any dimension there is a critical number of species @xmath28 above which the system reaches a frozen steady state , i.e. , there is _ fixation _",
    "@xcite , characterized by inert , non - fluctuating domains at whose interfaces all dynamics ceases ( for example , in one dimension , @xmath29 ) . in one dimension , the minimal number of species in order to have fixation is five ; for @xmath30 the systems coarsens : a large domain of a single species eventually spans the whole lattice . in two and three dimensions",
    "it was found that @xmath31 and @xmath32 , respectively ; for @xmath33 , the steady state is reactive in @xmath34 .",
    "all the above models are non - diffusive in the sense that there is no explicit mechanism allowing the mixing of the system : the agents are considered as _ immobile _ ( but species may still spread because of the particle production processes , since new offspring have to be put to adjacent sites ) . clearly ,",
    "as noted by other authors @xcite , a more realistic description of the predator ",
    "prey interaction should include the possibility for the agents to move .",
    "in fact , in ecosystems a prey tend to avoid the interaction with an incoming predator , while the predators aim to pursue the prey . in the absence of mixing processes",
    ", one can expect that the stochastic lattice predator  prey model should display features like fixation ( which is interesting but does not seem realistic from an ecological perspective ) .",
    "one approach , followed here , is to allow the system to be mixed via particle ( predators and prey ) _",
    "diffusion_. another approach , considered elsewhere for a model with next - nearest - neighbor interaction @xcite , is to consider a nearest - neighbor exchange process ( among any agents : predators , prey and empty sites ) referred to as ` stirring ' .",
    "interestingly , completely different results are obtained for systems mixed through diffusion or stirring , respectively : while in sec .",
    "iii.c we shall explain that diffusion does not affect the critical and other generic properties of the system under consideration here , the exchange process is in fact capable of completely washing out the subtle correlations induced by long - range interactions .",

    "after this general discussion , let us anticipate the main results of this present work ( of which a partial and brief account has recently been outlined in ref .",
    "@xcite ) :    * we provide a comparison of various mean - field predictions with the results of numerical monte carlo simulations in dimensions @xmath35 , addressing the phase diagram , the structure of the phase portrait , the existence and properties of the predator extinction phase transition , and other issues ( secs .",

    "in particular , we shall show that the mean - field rate equations [ eqs .",

    "iii.d , we present a field - theoretic analysis of the critical properties of the sllvm . section iv is devoted to our conclusions .",
    "following lotka and volterra s original work @xcite , we consider two chemical or biological species , the ` predators ' @xmath37 and ` prey ' @xmath38 , in competition : the predators consume the prey and _ simultaneously _ reproduce with rate @xmath39 . in addition",
    ", the prey may reproduce with rate @xmath40 and the predators are assumed to spontaneously die with rate @xmath41 . neglecting any spatial variations of the concentrations , which we shall denote by @xmath42 and @xmath43 for species @xmath37 and @xmath38 , respectively , the heuristic mean - field rate equations for this reaction model are given by the classical coupled nonlinear lotka  volterra ( lv ) differential equations @xcite : @xmath44 where the dot denotes the time derivative .",
    "note that within this mean - field approximation , we may view the parameters @xmath45 and @xmath46 as the net population growth rates for competing birth / death processes ( @xmath47 and @xmath48 , where @xmath49 denotes an empty ` spot ' ) with rates @xmath50 and @xmath51 , respectively , and similarly for species @xmath38 . for @xmath52 and @xmath53 , clearly both populations will die out exponentially , whereas @xmath54 and @xmath55 leads to unbounded population growth .",
    "therefore , interesting feedback interactions between the ` prey ' @xmath38 and the ` predators ' @xmath37 , which would become extinct in the absence of the prey , occur only if both @xmath41 and @xmath40 ( as well as @xmath56 ) are positive .",
    "the coupled deterministic evolution equations ( [ clotvol ] ) , ( [ blotvol ] ) have as stationary states ( fixed points ) @xmath57 ( extinction ) , @xmath58 ( predators extinct , malthusian prey proliferation ) , and @xmath59 ( species coexistence ) . for positive @xmath41 and @xmath40 , the ` trivial ' steady states with @xmath60 and @xmath61 and @xmath62 are both linearly unstable [ in the absence of predation , @xmath63 ,",
    "@xmath58 is stable ] .",
    "notice , however , that they both constitute _ absorbing _ stationary states , since neither can be left through the involved reactions alone .",

    "initial _ conditions , predicted by the rate equations ( [ clotvol ] ) , ( [ blotvol ] ) , one would more realistically typically expect stable stationary states with fixed concentrations , and/or the possibility of extinction thresholds . indeed , the conservation law for @xmath81 and the related property that the eigenvalues of the linearized kinetics near coexistence are purely imaginary , constitute very special features of the _ deterministic _ model equations  there is in fact no underlying physical background for the conserved quantity ( [ clvcons ] ) . correspondingly , the above center singularity is _ unstable _ with respect to perturbations : namely , either with respect to introducing modifications of the model equations , spatial degrees of freedom , and/or stochasticity . for obviously ,",
    "when the number of predators becomes very low , a chance fluctuation may lead the system into the absorbing state with @xmath60 .",

    "volterra systems still display quite intriguing dynamics : namely , inevitable fluctuations tend to push the system away from the trivial steady state and induce erratic population oscillations that almost resemble the deterministic cycles .",
    "this ` resonant amplification mechanism ' is always present in finite populations and can significantly delay extinction @xcite .",
    "we shall later , in sec .",
    "iii.c , discuss the analog of this mechanism in the spatially extended models .      in the ecological and biological literature , at the rate equation level , population models such as ( [ clotvol ] ) , ( [ blotvol ] ) are rendered more ` realistic ' by introducing _ growth - limiting _ terms that describe a finite ` carrying capacity ' @xcite . in a similar manner ,",
    "in a spatial system one may need to take into account that the _ local _ population densities can not exceed some given , bound value , which typically depends on external factors ; this amounts to introducing _ spatial constraints _",

    "we have indeed found the width of a single predator  hole domain to remain constant upon increasing the system size , which is typical of a coarsening phenomenon , and supports the previous observation that asymptotically , in the thermodynamic limit , one arrives at a steady state with vanishing predator density .",

    "however , the mean - field approximation naturally can not capture the intriguing dynamical spatial structures in the active coexistence phase of the sllvm .",
    "moreover , it does not aptly describe the universal scaling properties near the predator extinction threshold . in the language of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics , and with respect to the predator population , this constitutes a continuous phase transition from an active phase to an inactive , absorbing state . for local interactions , and in the absence of additional conservation laws and quenched disorder , such active to absorbing state phase transitions are known to be generically described by the universality class of directed percolation ( dp ) @xcite ( for recent reviews , see refs .",

    "one then proceeds by adopting a coherent - state path integral representation and by taking the continuum limit .",

    "this possibly has direct implications as it might shed further light on issues of particular ecological and biological relevance , such as the emergence of ( quasi-)oscillatory behavior and spontaneous pattern formation as results of stochastic fluctuations .",
    "typically , in two and three dimensions , when the fixed point is a focus ( at large values of the predation rate @xmath56 ) , the species coexistence phase is characterized by the formation of complex and correlated patterns , as the result of the interaction and the propagation of the traveling wave fronts of predators and prey , which in turn cause the overall population oscillations @xcite .",
    "the spatial structure of these patterns have been studied by computing the correlations functions , whilst their dynamical properties have been investigated through the computation of the functional dependence of the frequency of the resulting oscillations .",
    "we have found that the typical frequency of the stochastic oscillations are markedly reduced by fluctuation effects ( i.e. , compared to the mean - field predictions ) .    near their extinction threshold in the coexistence regime ,",
    "the predators are largely localized in clusters interspersed in a sea of prey , with an active reaction zone at their boundaries @xcite .",
    "we have carefully analyzed the critical properties of the system by computing various critical exponents and have checked that the active to absorbing phase transition belongs to the directed percolation ( dp ) universality class , with upper critical dimension @xmath372 .",
    "field - theoretic arguments support this conclusion : starting from the master equation , we have constructed a field theory representation of the involved stochastic processes , which near the predator extinction threshold can be mapped onto reggeon field theory . by utilizing tools of statistical mechanics ( mean - field treatment together with field - theoretic and renormalization group arguments )",
    "we thus obtain a general qualitative understanding of the properties of the system and also a quantitative predictions of its behavior in the vicinity of the extinction threshold .",
    "in particular , the critical exponents governing the various statistical properties of the populations densities near the threshold are argued to be the same as in directed percolation ( in dimensions @xmath370 ) . also , active to absorbing state phase transitions and dp critical exponents were ( numerically ) reported in studies of other stochastic lattice predator  prey model variants @xcite . thus , our field - theoretic analysis should apply to a broader class of stochastic models than the ones considered here .",
    "we have also discussed the one - dimensional case where , due to its special topology , the site occupation restriction on the lattice imply a ` caging effect ' resulting in species segregation and very slow coarsening of the predator domains in the system , which eventually evolves towards a lattice filled with prey .    finally , we remark that in stark contrast with the deterministic lotka  volterra system , whose mathematical features are well - known to be quite unstable with respect to any model perturbations , the _ stochastic _",
    "spatial version is quite generic , and its overall features are rather robust against model variations . in particular , as noted also in refs .",
    "@xcite , we have checked that the presence or absence of explicit particle diffusion does not qualitatively affect the properties of the system , since in our site - restricted system species proliferation is generated by the offspring production processes .",
    "similarly , we have found that when the predation process is spatially biased , near the extinction threshold only non - universal details change , but the dp critical behavior still applies , and more generally , the overall picture drawn here remains valid in the active coexistence phase as well .",
    "an intriguing situation is obtained when one considers a stochastic lattice predator - prey system with a next - nearest - neighbor ( nnn ) interaction among the competing species , as well as a short - range exchange process @xcite . in this case",
    "a subtle interplay emerges between the nnn interaction and the nearest - neighbor ( nn ) exchange or ` mixing ' : when the latter is ` slow ' , due to the presence of correlations , this system also undergoes a dp - type phase transition ( in dimensions @xmath275 ) , as does the sllvm studied in this work @xcite . however , when the value of the mixing rate is raised , the simple short - range exchange processes ` wash out ' the correlations and the system undergoes a _ first - order phase transition _ as in fact predicted by mean - field theory @xcite . whereas the rate equations predict entirely different behavior of the nnn system , which once more reflects the instability of the classical lotka  volterra model",
    ", it is quite remarkable that in the absence of explicit species mixing through particle exchange , the fluctuations render the properties of the nnn model akin to the simple sllvm with only nearest - neighbor interactions . in marked contrast with its mean - field counterpart , the stochastic lattice lotka  volterra model",
    "is thus quite stable with respect to model modifications . on the other hand , as the mean - field regime",
    "is expected to be reached when the exchange process allows the mixing of _ all _ the particles ( and not only the immediate nearest neighboring ones ) with an infinitely fast rate @xcite , the fact that mean - field like behavior , characterized by a first - order phase transition , already appears unexpectedly even for finite nn exchange rates @xcite is another quite intriguing feature of the nnn model .",

    "<S> we study the general properties of stochastic two - species models for predator - prey competition and coexistence with lotka  volterra type interactions defined on a @xmath0-dimensional lattice . introducing spatial degrees of freedom and allowing for stochastic fluctuations generically invalidates the classical , deterministic mean - field picture . already within mean - field theory , however , spatial constraints , modeling locally limited resources , lead to the emergence of a continuous active - to - absorbing state phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> field - theoretic arguments , supported by monte carlo simulation results , indicate that this transition , which represents an extinction threshold for the predator population , is governed by the directed percolation universality class . in the active state , where predators and prey coexist , the classical center singularities with associated population cycles are replaced by either nodes or foci . in the vicinity of the stable nodes , </S>",
    "<S> the system is characterized by essentially stationary localized clusters of predators in a sea of prey . near the stable foci , however , the stochastic lattice lotka  volterra system displays complex , correlated spatio - temporal patterns of competing activity fronts . </S>",
    "<S> correspondingly , the population densities in our numerical simulations turn out to oscillate irregularly in time , with amplitudes that tend to zero in the thermodynamic limit . yet in finite systems </S>",
    "<S> these oscillatory fluctuations are quite persistent , and their features are determined by the intrinsic interaction rates rather than the initial conditions . </S>",
    "<S> we emphasize the robustness of this scenario with respect to various model perturbations . </S>"
