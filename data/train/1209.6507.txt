    "in a recent paper the bes team has reported an unusually large isospin violation in the decay of the @xmath0 compared to the @xmath1 reaction @xcite .",
    "the @xmath6 being an isospin @xmath11 object can decay naturally to @xmath12 , but the decay into @xmath13 violates isospin .",
    "a mixture of the @xmath2 and @xmath3 is unavoidable because isospin is broken in meson rescattering due to the different masses of the charged and neutral kaons , as was early discussed in @xcite .",
    "more recently the subject has been thoroughly discussed in @xcite suggesting the study of the @xmath14 reaction as a test for it .",
    "this reaction has been done at bes @xcite , where one finds a narrow signal for the @xmath15 of the order of the difference of kaon masses , as predicted @xcite , with and intensity of about half per cent with respect to the one of the @xmath16 in the @xmath2 peak of the @xmath17 mass distribution .",
    "very recently , this reaction has been studied theoretically in @xcite using the chiral unitary approach , as in @xcite , showing that one not only gets the shape of the experiment but also the absolute rate . following the suggestion of @xcite , the same experimental work of @xcite also reports on the @xmath18 in the region of the @xmath2 peak of the @xmath17 mass distribution , and once again finds a narrow signal , with an intensity with respect to @xmath19 in the @xmath3 region of the @xmath20 mass distribution of the order of also half per cent .",
    "these numbers are within expected values for isospin violation and the narrowness of the isospin forbidden signal is tied to the mass difference between charged and neutral kaons , reflecting that the isospin violation is tied to the difference of the loop functions of intermediate kaons in the rescattering of mesons that leads both to the @xmath2 and @xmath3 resonances .",
    "this provides support @xcite to the chiral dynamical picture of these resonances @xcite , which appear as composite states of meson - meson , dynamically generated by the interaction of mesons provided by the chiral lagrangians @xcite .    with this earlier experimental work ,",
    "the recent work on the @xmath21 and @xmath22 reactions @xcite has brought a surprise .",
    "the signal for the isospin violating channel @xmath23 is also very narrow , in agreement with previous findings in analogous reactions , but the reported ratio of the partial decay widths of the two channels is abnormally large , @xmath24 for @xmath25 to @xmath22 , or summing the @xmath26 channel to the @xmath27 , a ratio of @xmath28 for the ratio of rates of @xmath21 to @xmath22 .",
    "one anticipates difficulties in a theoretical description of such a large rate , unless the same @xmath6 state already contains a large mixture of @xmath11 and @xmath29 , in which case the rate of production of the @xmath2 final state would be largely enhanced .",
    "however , in this case , the signal of the @xmath2 would not be due to the difference of the kaon masses and the production of the @xmath2 would proceed unhindered , showing the natural width of the @xmath2 of about 50 mev instead of the 9 mev observed in the bes experiment @xcite .    in @xcite a particular mechanism",
    "was proposed , consisting in the @xmath6 decay into @xmath30 , the posterior @xmath31 decay into @xmath32 and the rescattering of the @xmath33 to produce either the @xmath34 and the @xmath35 resonances .",
    "this leads technically to a triangular loop diagram that has two cuts ( singularities in the integrand ) , which make it different from the standard @xmath36 loop function from @xmath33 , with only the @xmath33 on shell singularity .",
    "this latter @xmath36 function would appear should the @xmath37 vertex be a contact term , or if it was coming from diagrams where an internal propagator is far off shell ( contact like vertex ) .",
    "in the present work we shall make first a thorough discussion of the issue assuming a contact ( or contact like ) @xmath37 vertex . under this assumption one can make a quite model independent study , and the conclusion is that the results obtained are in line with those of other reactions , like the @xmath38 .",
    "a second part is devoted to the explicit study of the triangular mechanism of @xcite which is quite unique to the present reaction . using the chiral unitary approach we shall see that we are able to evaluate the ratio for isospin violation rather reliably , beyond the reach of @xcite where the ratio of widths for @xmath39 and @xmath40 was dependent on an unknown cut off .",
    "we find that this ratio is sizeably increased with respect to the standard approach , in the line of the claims of @xcite .",
    "we also show that the consideration of extra mechanism driven by primary @xmath41 production and rescattering can further increase a bit that ratio such that a good agreement with experiment is found at the end .",
    "we emphasize that the concept of @xmath42 mixing is not very appropriate since the apparent mixing is so different in different reactions .",
    "we rather prefer to talk in terms of isospin violation , magnified due to the proximity of the @xmath43 and @xmath44 resonances , but which is very much tied to different reactions .",
    "the ability of the chiral unitary approach to provide a fair description of all these processes certainly gives support to this method and the underlying consequence in this case , that the @xmath43 and @xmath44 resonances are basically molecular states of meson - meson , mostly @xmath33 in both cases .",
    "in what follows we will assume that we have the @xmath6 decay , while in the bes experiment a mixture if the @xmath6 and @xmath10 is present .",
    "we also evaluate decay rates for the @xmath10 and find that the results are basically the same , independently of whether we have either resonance or a mixture of the two .",
    "the starting point in the following discussion is the acceptance that the @xmath2 and @xmath3 qualify as composite meson - meson states which are dynamically generated by the meson - meson interaction provided by the chiral lagrangians .",
    "the schrdinger equation is solved using the kernel ( potential ) from the chiral lagrangians , which provide a scattering amplitude from where the @xmath2 and @xmath3 emerge as poles in the complex plane . in practice ,",
    "the bethe - salpeter equation in coupled channels is used , accounting for dynamical and relativistic effects .",
    "the basic building blocks are @xmath45 and @xmath33 for the @xmath2 and @xmath46 and @xmath33 for the @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "once this is accepted , the next step is that , consistently with this picture , these resonances do not couple directly to external sources .",
    "it is the constituents , pairs of mesons , that couple directly to these sources and , upon unitarization ( multiple scattering of these mesons ) the resonances are formed . according to this picture ,",
    "a series of reactions where these resonances are formed were studied and , with no extra parameters than those needed in the study of meson - meson scattering , predictions were made for cross sections or other observables in these reactions .",
    "examples of it are the reactions @xmath47 , @xmath48 @xcite , the @xmath49 @xcite , the @xmath50 reaction @xcite or the photoproduction of @xmath2 on nucleons @xcite .",
    "the success in the study of these reactions gives strong support to the basic idea that we adopt here concerning these resonances .",
    "after this introductory discussion , let us begin the first point where we shall assume that the first step consists of @xmath51 ( @xmath52 for pseudoscalar ) well described by contact ( or contact like ) vertices .",
    "we also accept that the @xmath6 is an isospin zero state .",
    "then , the mechanism for production of either @xmath53 or @xmath54 in the final state , together with an extra @xmath55 , is given by fig .",
    "[ fig : diag ] .    , @xmath41 production in the @xmath6 decay . ]",
    "implicit in the picture of fig .",
    "[ fig : diag ] is the fact that the @xmath55 of the upper line has an energy , when the other pair of mesons produce the @xmath2 or @xmath3 , which does not match with the energy of the other mesons ( in the case of @xmath54 production ) to produce the @xmath2 or @xmath3 resonances . in the case of @xmath56 ,",
    "the @xmath55 would not produce either the @xmath2 , that has zero charge , nor the @xmath3 which does not couple to two pions .",
    "but even if it had , it would not play a role in the reaction as we shall discuss below .    the pair of interacting mesons in fig .",
    "[ fig : diag ] will have @xmath29 if we invoke exact @xmath11 for the @xmath6 .",
    "then the @xmath33 pair appears in the @xmath29 combination @xmath57 where we take the convention that @xmath58 of isospin .",
    "should the kaons have the same mass , the loop functions in the figure would be the same for charged and neutral kaons and the relative minus sign in eq .",
    "( [ eq : kk ] ) guarantees that @xmath53 will not be produced , since there is an exact cancellation of the @xmath59 and @xmath60 contributions ( the @xmath61 would also not proceed ) .",
    "however , when the physical masses are considered , the exact cancellation turns into a partial cancellation , leading to an isospin breaking effect that we study in detail below .",
    "so far we have only advocated isospin conservation in the @xmath62 vertex .",
    "now we can go one step further to put some constraints on the @xmath54 primary production using arguments of @xmath63 .    by analogy to the @xmath64 and @xmath65 , which are members of a nonet , with the @xmath64 largely an octet and the @xmath65 basically a singlet , with a small mixing @xcite",
    ", we can also assume that in the next pair of @xmath64 states , the @xmath66 is largely an octet and the @xmath6 is mostly a singlet ( we shall release this constraint later on to quantify uncertainties ) .",
    "in this case we have to place the interacting meson pair into an octet to produce a singlet with the octet of the spectator @xmath55 .",
    "then , up to an undetermined reduced matrix element , the weight of @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath54 is determined by the @xmath63 clebsch - gordan coefficients of the @xmath67 decomposition , and we have up to a global factor , @xmath68    then , the scattering matrix for the production of the final state is given by @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the @xmath71 scattering matrix for the channels @xmath59 ( 1 ) , @xmath60 ( 2 ) , @xmath54 ( 3 ) , @xmath53 ( 4 ) , @xmath72 ( 5 ) and @xmath73 in the same basis is given by @xmath74 with @xmath75 a reduced matrix element .",

    "the g function is the diagonal loop matrix of the propagators of the intermediate particles @xmath80 with @xmath52 the total four - momentum ( @xmath81 ) and @xmath82 the masses of the particles in the considered channel .",
    "upon regularization with a cut off one obtains @xcite @xmath83 where @xmath84 .    by using a cutoff of @xmath85 we obtain a good description of the @xmath2 and @xmath3 resonances , as in @xcite .",
    "note that in eq .",
    "we have two sources of isospin violation .",
    "the one due to the @xmath86 functions , which now are different for @xmath59 and @xmath87 , and the @xmath70 matrix elements , which are evaluated by means of eq . in the charge basis of the states and that also break isospin symmetry because the @xmath86 functions are different for different members of the same isospin multiplets .",
    "now we would like to restrict the assumption of the @xmath6 being an @xmath63 singlet .",
    "let us accept that it would also have a mixture with an octet . in the case of a pure octet for the @xmath6 then the interacting pair can belong to the @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 representations .",
    "defining @xmath91 we have @xmath92 for the octet , @xmath93 for the decuplet and @xmath94 for the @xmath90 .",
    "it is quite unlikely that the @xmath6 would be a pure octet , and that in this case the interacting pair would couple only to the the @xmath90 representation , which leads us to values of @xmath95 preferably positive .",

    "the order of magnitude for @xmath95 is determined with these simple arguments , but we can get help from experiment since we have the ratio @xcite @xmath99 assuming the ratio to hold for the rates to @xmath41 and @xmath100 we obtain @xmath101 where @xmath102 stands for the phase space of each final state , which is obtained integrating @xmath103 of eq .",

    "[ fig : ratio1 ] . about a factor nine bigger . from these spectra",
    "we find that the ratio of integrated decay widths is now @xmath208    this @xmath209 is much closer to the experimental value of @xmath210 , which has a lower limit of @xmath211 .",
    "assuming similar theoretical uncertainties the results are compatible .",
    "we have made some estimates of the errors by changing the cutoff @xmath212 by @xmath213 , which moves the @xmath34 and @xmath35 peak in @xmath45 and @xmath46 scattering by about @xmath214 .",
    "we find that this change induces changes in the ratio of eq . by @xmath215 .",
    "however , an uncertainty of @xmath216 is more indicated to account also for the uncertainties in the background subtraction .",
    "so we would be obtaining @xmath217 for the fraction of decay rates .",
    "this increase by about one order of magnitude with respect to the standard calculation is a consequence of the two neighboring singularities in the triangle diagram which is peculiar to the @xmath6 case .",
    "we can now estimate the effect of having also @xmath41 in the primary production process .",
    "a triangular diagram of the type used for @xmath124 production is not possible now .",
    "indeed , one would have to substitute the @xmath31 by a @xmath218 , but this is dynamically forbidden ( no @xmath219 coupling ) .",
    "then we must rely upon a contact term like assumed in the former section .    by recalling the exercise done in the former section ( eqs .",
    "- ) and the conclusion that positive values of r ( with respect to an equivalent local @xmath220 production mechanism ) were preferred , the inspection of fig . can give us a qualitative estimate of what adding this new primary @xmath221 production vertex can do to the widths , which is a moderate increase of the ratio @xmath9 by about @xmath222 .",
    "this would provide a ratio around @xmath223 with an uncertainty of @xmath224 , or rounding errors , a ratio of @xmath225 , in good agreement with the experimental values .",
    "now we come back to the bes experiment @xcite . in this experiment",
    "the authors can not distinguish whether they have the @xmath6 or the @xmath10 resonance , so we must assume that they have a mixture of both . in order to account for this possibility , we have evaluated the same ratio of rates as before assuming that we have now the @xmath10 resonance .",
    "the result that we obtain is @xmath226 this coincides with the centroid of our result of @xmath225",
    ". we might also think about the possibility to have a contribution from the original @xmath227 channel . however , the same collaboration team reports for the mixture of the resonances in the @xmath228 , @xmath229 a large dominance of the second process by nearly one order of magnitude @xcite , which means we can neglet the primary @xmath227 channel in this case .",
    "hence , assuming the same uncertainties as before , our final results for the @xmath6 , the @xmath10 , or a mixture of both , are given by @xmath230",
    "in this paper we have carried out a calculation of the decay rates of the @xmath231 and @xmath232 reactions with the aim of investigating the isospin violation in the first reaction which is tied to the @xmath2-@xmath3 mixing in the terminology of other works .",
    "we have abstained of talking about a measure of the mixing since in our formalism there is no transition of one to the other resonance but a simultaneous production of both once the problem is tackled with meson states in charge basis with different masses , where a small violation of isospin is immediately obtained .",
    "since the two resonances are produced from the interaction of meson pairs , the process proceeds via a first step in which a @xmath117 and a pair of mesons are produced , and a second step in which the pair of mesons interacts .",
    "isospin violation has then two sources , the first loop after the production , and the scattering matrices of meson - meson interaction .",
    "but in both cases the violation is tied to the difference of masses between the charged and neutral kaons .",
    "this has as a consequence that the shape of the peak obtained for the @xmath27 production in the first reaction has a very narrow width of the size of this mass difference , of the order of 9 mev .",
    "this comes naturally in the approach and is in perfect agreement with the observation in the experiment .",
    "in the first part we avoided making an explicit model for the reaction , but we assumed the primary production of @xmath233 to be given by a contact term and we could see that , invoking general principles and admitting large uncertainties in the input , we obtained a rate of @xmath27 production versus @xmath234 production which was rather small , of the order of one percent , which is in good agreement with the @xmath2 and @xmath3 mixing of the two bes experiments on @xmath235 and @xmath236 , with respect to the isospin allowed counterparts of @xmath16 and @xmath237 @xcite .",
    "the rates obtained are also in agreement with those obtained in theoretical papers of the @xmath235 versus @xmath238 @xcite . however , the rates obtained for the @xmath239 versus @xmath240 are very small compared to those claimed in the experiment @xcite , about one order of magnitude smaller .",
    "we tried to understand the situation by admitting a large admixture of i=1 in the @xmath6 wave function , but it required a very large i=1 component , not easily acceptable , and worse , it gave a signal for @xmath2 production which had a width of the order of 20 mev , which was much larger than the experimental one of the order of 9 mev .",
    "in the second part we followed the approach of @xcite using the dominant primary production mechanism given by @xmath7 followed by @xmath8 .",
    "the first loop now was quite different than for the contact interactions since the new singularity associated to @xmath7 played a very important role in the reaction .",
    "we found that using this new mechanism of production , the ratio of @xmath9 was increased by about one order of magnitude with respect to the results using the contact production vertices , providing results very close to those in the experiment .",
    "these results confirm the claims of @xcite , where , however , a precise determination of that ratio could not be given since it was tied to unknown form factors needed to regularize the divergent loops .",
    "the use of the chiral unitary approach in the present work solved this problem since one could associate the regularizing cutoff in the new loops to the one used in meson - meson scattering to generate the @xmath2 and @xmath3 resonances dynamically . this allowed us to make quantitative predictions for the @xmath241 ratio , with a value @xmath225 , in basic agreement with experiment , of @xmath242 .",
    "we also showed that the results obtained for that ratio were the same if we had the @xmath10 resonance instead of the @xmath6 , or a mixture of the two , as seems to be the case in the bes experiment .",
    "a final conclusion to be drawn is that the concept of @xmath243 mixing is not very appropriate and different apparent ratios are obtained in different reactions .",
    "then , the chiral unitary approach appears as an appropriate and accurate tool to use in order to analyze these reactions , and the present results , together with other results in different reactions on the mixing of these resonances , come to strengthen the support for the @xmath2 and @xmath3 resonances as dynamically generated from the meson - meson interaction .",
