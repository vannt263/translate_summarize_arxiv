    "the complicated dynamics of heavy - ion collisions provides a great challenge for many - particle theory .",
    "in particular at intermediate energies where the elementary ingredients are rather well known  in terms of constituents and their respective interactions  the main problem arises from a sufficient description of the many - particle aspect . to provide single - particle distribution functions",
    "such reactions can be simulated on the basis of kinetic equations as , e.g. , supplied by the boltzmann - uhlenbeck - uhling ( buu ) approach ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) .    however , the formation of light clusters such as deuterons , helium , @xmath0-particles , etc . , is an important phenomenon of heavy - ion collisions at intermediate energies , see , e.g. , ref .",
    "empirical evidence , including recent experimental data on cluster formation  @xcite , indicate that a large fraction of deuterons can be formed in heavy - ion collisions of energies below @xmath1 mev . also , during the expansion of the system the density can drop below the mott - density of deuteron dissociation  @xcite .",
    "the description of the formation of such bound states ( clusters ) during the expansion of hot and dense matter is not as well elaborated as the single - particle distribution .",
    "the main obstacle is that the formation of bound states requires the notion of few - body reactions within the medium .",
    "even the simplest case , i.e. , the abundances of deuterons that are determined by the deuteron formation via @xmath2 ( @xmath3 nucleon , @xmath4 deuteron ) and break - up , @xmath5 , reactions , requires a proper treatment of the effective three - body problem .",
    "previous studies of the kinetics of deuteron production have utilized the impulse approximation to calculate the reaction cross section at energies above 200 mev  @xcite . for lower energies , viz .",
    "@xmath6 mev , the impulse approximation fails badly and a full three - body treatment of the scattering problem is necessary  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a consistent treatment of cluster formation in expanding hot and dense matter requires the inclusion of medium effects into the respective elementary reaction cross sections as has been done in the nucleon nucleon ( nn)-case and proven to be substantial in buu - simulations of heavy - ion reactions  @xcite .",
    "therefore we present an exact treatment of the three - body problem including medium modifications in mean - field approximation .    the cluster formation during the expansion of hot and dense matter is driven by the collision term in the generalized linear boltzmann equation ( see , e.g. , ref.s",

    "mev the deviation of the in - medium cross section from the free cross section in this model is in the order of 10% .",

    "the influence of the medium on the break - up cross section is calculated in the center of mass frame for the three - particle system .",
    "it shows three important features : 1 ) the cross section increases with increasing densities , 2 ) the threshold energy shifts due to the decreasing binding energy of the deuteron at increasing densities , and 3 ) the effect of the medium becomes smaller at higher scattering energies .",
    "the influence of the medium is rather strong . near the maximum and close to the mott density the cross section increases almost one order of magnitude compared to the isolated one .",
    "we argue that this modification is also important in a complete treatment of the heavy ion reaction ( as found for the nn - case  @xcite ) .",
    "an important global quantity that governs the time scale of the deuteron formation is the life - time ( i.e. width ) of the fluctuations in the deuteron distributions in hot and dense nuclear matter .",
    "we have calculated the life - time of the deuteron fluctuations using either isolated or medium dependent cross section in the collision integral .",
    "we find that the life - time strongly depends on the type of cross section included in the evaluation .",
    "the difference between the use of the isolated cross section versus the medium dependent one amounts to almost a factor of three near the mott density .",
    "this is in support of the statement that the medium modifications of the break - up cross section may lead to changes in the final outcome of the deuteron rate in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "therefore the results presented here may be considered an important input for transport equations that are used to describe the dynamics in a heavy - ion collision as done , e.g. , in ref .",
