    "sensor networks have the potential ability to monitor and instrument the real world ( @xcite ) . among many challenges of sensor networks , tracking target by using collaborative information processing and optimal networking",
    "has been an important problem in both theory and application .    in this paper",
    ", we consider single target tracking by using a group of mobile distributed nonlinear sensors such as range and direction sensors in terms of sensor deployment .",
    "if the measurement of the target for each sensor is nonlinear and noisy , nonlinear filtering theory has to be applied to estimate the state of the target . in most cases , the target s dynamics is partially or even completely unknown , which makes the modeling and estimation problem for target tracking more complicated .",
    "subsequently the target s dynamics will be described by a linear gaussian model and the distributed sensors measurements for the target will be nonlinear and noisy .",
    "our aim is to propose a convergent nonlinear filter to estimate the trajectory of the target based on the measurements from the scalar range sensors .",
    "considering the sensors tracking qualities , sensor deployment has to be dealt with by adopting formation control techniques .",
    "this idea has also been adopted in , for example , @xcite , where the authors integrated motion coordination strategies and extended kalman filter to improve the tracking performance of the sensor network . in @xcite collaborative localization algorithms are proposed to reconstruct the position of the target in a noise - free environment .    in many real applications ,",
    "target tracking has to be dealt with in the presence of disturbed target dynamics and nonlinear noisy measurements .",
    "the estimation in nonlinear systems has been an extremely important problem ( @xcite ) .",
    "though there are now many nonlinear filtering algorithms , such as point - based unscented filters , density - based particle filters , the extended kalman filter ( ekf ) has been a popular filter for nonlinear systems , in particular for target tracking problems ( @xcite ) . however , little work has been performed to analyze the stability and convergence of the filter , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "it is well known that the upper ( lower ) bound of the solution of the riccati equation associated with ekf depends on the uniform controllability ( uniform detectability ) of the considered nonlinear systems ( see @xcite , theorem 7 ) . however , with the model used in this paper , even though ekf has a comparative accuracy , it is difficult to show the convergence of ekf since the uniform complete controllability can not be assumed .",
    "in addition , the riccati differential equations associated with the error covariance are very difficult to integrate numerically . then an important problem arises : can we design a convergent nonlinear filter to track the target with unknown dynamics ?",
    "the contribution of this paper is twofold : one is the proposal of a convergent nonlinear filter and the other is for appropriate deployment of the sensors .",
    "sensor deployment concerns the connectivity and coverage of the network , which plays a key role in energy conservation and monitoring quality ( @xcite ) and , at the same time , assures the feasibility of our proposed filter . a fundamental problem , i.e. , @xmath0-coverage problem , facing sensor deployment for target tracking is how to deploy the sensors so that every point in the target region will be monitored by at least @xmath0 sensors . for target tracking with mobile sensors ,",
    "since the deployment algorithm will be integrated with the estimation process , @xmath0-coverage problems become more difficult to solve . in this paper , inspired by a virtual vehicle approach in @xcite , neighbor - based formation control",
    "will be proposed to achieve an equilateral - triangle deployment and solve the @xmath1-coverage problem for mobile sensors .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ formulation ] , we discuss the sensor deployment and formulate the mathematical model in the target tracking problem . in section  [ filter ] , on the basis of equilateral - triangle deployment for mobile sensors , the design and convergence of a nonlinear filter will be given to track the target . in section",
    "[ motion ] , the @xmath1-coverage problem will be solved for mobile sensors by designing a decentralized control to achieve equilateral - triangle formation .    throughout this paper , we will use the following notations : @xmath2 is a real matrix , @xmath3 denotes its matrix transpose , @xmath4 is the trace of @xmath2 , @xmath5 is an eigenvalue of @xmath2",
    ", @xmath6 is the spectral norm ; for vector @xmath7 , @xmath8 is euclidean norm and @xmath9 is maximum norm ; @xmath10 denotes the inner product in euclidean space ; @xmath11 denotes the kronecker product ; @xmath12 $ ] is the expectation operator ; @xmath13 denotes the concatenation ; @xmath14 is the dirac delta operator .",
    "in this section , we will formulate the target tracking problem on sensor deployment strategy and convergent nonlinear filter design .",
    "consider target tracking with @xmath15 mobile sensors .",
    "suppose that each sensor is modeled as two disks with radii @xmath16 and @xmath17 , which indicate the sensing range and the communication range , respectively . in order to improve the target tracking quality , having the target sensed by at least @xmath0 ( no less than @xmath1 ) sensors in a plane is critical .",
    "meanwhile , the sensors should be kept connected to transmit and receive data successfully .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that if @xmath18 , @xmath0-coverage implies connectivity of the network .",
    "for the case the target region is constrained in a space of dimension two , the problem of designing a target tracking filter will be resolved in section  [ filter ] and , the problem of how to make the region be @xmath1-covered by mobile sensors in section  [ motion ] .",
    "let the kinematic equation of sensor @xmath19 be described by a nonlinear system @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the position of sensor @xmath19 and @xmath22 is its input .",
    "the measurement of the target for each scalar sensor is nonlinear and noisy and can be expressed as @xmath23 where @xmath24 is continuously differentiable with respect to @xmath25 and @xmath26 are independent gaussian white noises with covariance matrices @xmath27=\\omega_i { \\rm dirac}(t_1-t_2)$ ] .",
    "the variable @xmath28 denotes the state of the target .",
    "when @xmath29 represents the position or orientation angle of the target , the sensors will be called range sensors .",
    "another kind of sensors is called velocity sensor if @xmath25 contains the velocity vector of the target .",
    "now suppose that the state @xmath29 of the target evolves in a continuous - time linear system with partially unknown input : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the partially unknown input , the initial state @xmath32 is also an unknown constant vector and @xmath33 are constant matrices .",
    "the unknown input is generated by a linear exogenous system @xmath34 where @xmath35 , @xmath36 are known matrices and the system disturbance @xmath37 is a zero - mean gaussian white noise with @xmath38=\\psi{\\rm dirac}(t - s)$ ] .    then the target s dynamics ( [ targ ] ) and the kinematics ( [ senmot ] ) and the measurements ( [ meas ] ) of @xmath15 sensors compose an extended system @xmath39 @xmath40 @xmath41 where @xmath42 @xmath43 and @xmath44    here we can not assume that system @xmath45 is ( uniformly ) controllable",
    "thus , the boundedness of the solution of the riccati equation associated with ekf corresponding to system ( [ exte1 ] ) , ( [ exte3 ] ) can not be guaranteed .",
    "let @xmath46 be the jacobian matrix of @xmath47 with respect to @xmath25 and @xmath48 $ ] .",
    "if there is no confusion , @xmath46 will be abbreviated as @xmath49 in the sequel . when the observability of time - varying system with @xmath49 or @xmath50 is mentioned , @xmath25 and @xmath51 are regarded as constants .",
    "in order to investigate the observability of system @xmath52 , we make an assumption as follows :    [ obstra]the pairs @xmath53 and @xmath54 are observable and no eigenvalue of @xmath55 is a transmission zero of system @xmath56 .    the following result can be checked by hautus test and the proof is omitted here ( the detail can be found in @xcite ) .",
    "[ obs ] under assumption [ obstra ] , the matrix pair @xmath52 is observable .    for system @xmath57 in this paper , we will show in section [ filter ] that , in fact , @xmath58 will be also uniformly detectable by finding a gain matrix @xmath59 such that @xmath60 will have negative real - part eigenvalues for arbitrary time - varying variables @xmath25 and @xmath51 .    in terms of lemma [ obs ] ,",
    "a nonlinear observer - based filter can be proposed for systems ( [ exte1 ] ) and ( [ exte3 ] ) : @xmath61 in this paper , we limit ourselves to nonlinear observers that satisfy the following constraints : 1 ) @xmath62 are gain matrices to be designed such that @xmath63 and @xmath64 are constant matrices ; 2 ) the observer is an asymptotic observer for the given system in the absence of system disturbance @xmath37 and measurement noise @xmath65 .",
    "the motivation for the second constraint is that the observer should be an possible asymptotic observer even when some , or all , components of the system state or the measurements are noise free .",
    "the nonlinear function @xmath66 can be expanded up to first order via @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the remaining nonlinear term .",
    "the estimation errors are defined by @xmath69 .",
    "then we can have the nonlinear error dynamics @xmath70    to examine the error dynamics ( [ obserr ] ) , consider a general ito stochastic differential equation @xmath71 where @xmath72 is a standard brown motion . then a differential generator associated with @xmath73 is defined as follows ( @xcite ) : @xmath74 where @xmath75 denotes the hessian matrix .",
    "now a key lemma to show the stochastic boundedness or stability is given as follows ( @xcite ) :    [ llyap ] if there is a stochastic process @xmath76 and positive numbers @xmath77 such that @xmath78 and @xmath79 are fulfilled , then the stochastic process @xmath73 is exponentially bounded in mean square , i.e. @xmath80 \\leq \\frac{\\lambda_2}{\\lambda_1}\\|e(0)\\|e^{-\\lambda_3 t } + \\frac{\\epsilon}{\\lambda_1\\lambda_3}\\ ] ] for every @xmath81 .",
    "in the subsequent sections , we will firstly give a construction of nonlinear filter ( [ obseq ] ) and analyze its stability .",
    "secondly we will discuss a deployment for mobile sensors in order to ensure the existence of nonlinear filter ( [ obseq ] ) and improve the tracking quality as well .",
    "in this section , a nonlinear filter will be built to track the target by using mobile range sensors .",
    "then the stochastic stability of the filter will be analyzed .",
    "suppose that the target dynamics ( [ targ ] ) is expressed as follows : @xmath82 where @xmath83 denote the position , velocity and acceleration of the target , @xmath84 , @xmath85 additionally , the acceleration @xmath86 is given by the exogenous system ( [ dist ] ) .    in the rest of the paper , we will consider only scalar range sensors whose measurements of target are given by @xmath87 or , @xmath88    to reconstruct the state of the target , an assumption on the rank of jacobian matrix @xmath89 is made :    [ rank ] for continuous differentiable function @xmath90 , there exists a number @xmath15 such that the jacobian matrix @xmath91 is column full rank .",
    "the assumption suggests that when enough number of sensors are placed in a finite dimensional state space , we can always find that the gradients @xmath92 are linearly independent and then the reconstruction of the states of the target will be possible . as @xmath15 turns larger , the assumption on jacobian rank becomes satisfied more easily .",
    "for example , if we take the measurement function as @xmath93 it follows that the jacobian matrix is @xmath94 when three or more sensors are placed in the plane , it is easy to find non - collinear positions relative to the target for the sensors .",
    "this is just the reason why we should consider the @xmath1-coverage problem in mobile sensor network in next section .    in what follows , for the sake of constructing a filter for the extended system @xmath95 and @xmath96 , we investigate the structure of system @xmath97 . from assumption [ obstra ]",
    ", @xmath54 is observable , then there exists a matrix @xmath98 such that @xmath99 is a hurwitz matrix .",
    "then , for an arbitrary positive definite matrix @xmath100 , there is a symmetric positive definite matrix @xmath101 such that @xmath102    the following assumption is given to guarantee the convergence of the proposed nonlinear filter ( [ obseq ] ) associated with the extended system @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "[ gassu]for gain matrix @xmath103 in equation ( [ eq2 - 7 ] ) , we have the following two relations :    1 .",
    "@xmath104 , 2 .",
    "@xmath105 ,    where @xmath106 and @xmath107 are @xmath108-dimensional symmetric positive definite matrices .    now a nonlinear filter is proposed as follows : @xmath109 where @xmath110 and the gain matrix @xmath111 @xmath112 with assumption [ rank ] , the inverse of @xmath113 is well defined .",
    "now we turn to the stability analysis of filter ( [ eq2-obs ] ) .",
    "define @xmath114 then the nonlinear error dynamics ( [ obserr ] ) can be rewritten in a compact form : @xmath115 where @xmath116 and @xmath117 satisfies @xmath118    [ tayb ] there are positive numbers @xmath119 such that the remaining term @xmath117 is bounded by @xmath120 for @xmath121 .",
    "[ jac ] there is a positive number @xmath122 such that the smallest eigenvalue of matrix @xmath113 is satisfied for all @xmath123 : @xmath124    [ jacrem ] if we can resolve the @xmath1-coverage problem in the mobile sensor network , this assumption will be fulfilled since @xmath113 is bounded positive definite when @xmath15 sensors are deployed in the interested area ( compact subset of euclidean space ) with equilateral - triangle formation , which will be considered in section [ motion ] .",
    "[ defn1 ] in equation ( [ eq2 - 8 ] ) , if there exist positive numbers @xmath125 such that @xmath80 \\leq a_{1 } \\|e(0)\\|e^{-a_{2}t}+a_{3}\\ ] ] holds for every @xmath81 , we say that the nonlinear filter ( [ eq2-obs ] ) can track the target .",
    "now a main result will be presented as follows :    [ thmsen]consider a target with disturbed dynamics ( [ eq2 - 1 ] ) , ( [ dist ] ) and @xmath15 mobile sensors with nonlinear measurements ( [ eq2 - 4 ] ) . under assumptions",
    "[ obstra ] , [ gassu ] , [ tayb ] and [ jac ] , the filter defined by ( [ eq2-obs ] ) can track the target .",
    "proof : firstly , for system ( [ eq2 - 8 ] ) , we will show that @xmath126 with given gain matrix @xmath127 will be stabilizable under assumption [ obstra ] .",
    "a variable transform is defined as follows : @xmath128 where @xmath129 then the error dynamics ( [ eq2 - 8 ] ) is transformed to @xmath130 where @xmath131 define @xmath132 where @xmath133 is a symmetric matrix such that @xmath134 and @xmath135 and @xmath136 satisfy assumption [ gassu ] .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath133 is positive definite by _ schur complement formula_. obviously , @xmath137 is bounded by @xmath138 where @xmath139 and @xmath140 are the smallest and largest eigenvalue of @xmath133 , respectively .    for the given stochastic process @xmath137",
    ", the differential generator is given by @xmath141    under assumption [ gassu ] , it is not difficult to obtain that @xmath142 thus we have @xmath143 which is a positive definite matrix due to assumption [ gassu ] and @xmath144 .",
    "thus , the matrices @xmath145 and @xmath146 will be hurwitz stable .",
    "let @xmath147 be the smallest eigenvalue of @xmath148 . by assumptions [ tayb ] , [ jac ] ,",
    "then the generator is @xmath149 since @xmath150 , we have @xmath151 defining @xmath152 @xmath153 and using ( [ genb ] ) one obtains @xmath154 with @xmath155 for @xmath156 . according to lemma [ llyap ] , @xmath157 \\leq \\frac{\\lambda_{\\rm max}(p)}{\\lambda_{\\rm min}(p)}\\|\\tilde e(0)\\|e^{-\\eta t } + \\frac{\\epsilon}{\\lambda_{\\rm min}(p)\\eta},\\ ] ] by definition [ defn1 ] and the transformation ( [ trans ] ) , the conclusion follows .    ' '' ''",
    "in this section , we discuss conditions for deploying the mobile sensors that guarantee assumption [ rank ] and assumption [ jac ] , which play an essential role in the proposed filter design .",
    "we will design neighbor - based control so the mobile sensors move in equilateral - triangle formations .",
    "suppose that the interconnection topology of the sensor network is a tree . for range sensors , the tree interconnection topology means that sensor @xmath19 can measure the position ( i.e. distance and bearing angle with respect to sensor @xmath19 ) of sensor @xmath158 for @xmath159 .",
    "additionally , suppose that all sensor can get the states of the estimated target , which can be regarded as a virtual sensor labeled @xmath160 .",
    "a unicycle model is used to describe the kinematics of sensor @xmath19 for @xmath161 , i.e. @xmath162 where @xmath163 is the position , @xmath164 is the translational velocity , @xmath165 is the orientation angle and @xmath166 is the angular velocity . here , the control to be designed is @xmath164 and @xmath166 .",
    "let @xmath167 denote the actual distance between sensor @xmath19 and @xmath158 ( while @xmath168 is the corresponding desired distance ) , let @xmath169 be the actual bearing angle from the orientation of sensor @xmath19 to edge @xmath170 and @xmath171 the corresponding desired bearing angle ( see fig . [ unicfg ] ) .",
    "here , @xmath172 and @xmath171 are constrained in the radian interval @xmath173 $ ] .",
    "note that the desired formation is defined by @xmath174 and @xmath175 for @xmath176 . finally , define @xmath177 .",
    "then we can rewrite the unicycle model ( [ unic ] ) as @xmath178    inspired by the path - following control presented in @xcite , a virtual sensor approach will be used .",
    "a reference point @xmath179 is chosen on @xmath180 s axis of orientation at a distance @xmath181 with bearing angle @xmath171 .",
    "then we have @xmath182 derivation of equation ( [ refpoi ] ) in combination with unicycle model ( [ unic ] ) gives the following relationship : @xmath183    on the one hand , the initial values of @xmath171 can be taken in @xmath184 @xmath185 $ ] in order to achieve equilateral - triangle formation with tree interconnection topology .",
    "however , once the target changes its orientation very fast , it is both necessary and efficient to decrease response formation time for target tracking in practice .",
    "hence , we need to regulate the desired bearing angles timely .    an appropriate choice for the dynamics of the desired bearing angle @xmath171 is given by : @xmath186 for some threshold @xmath187 and @xmath188 .",
    "on the other hand , if @xmath189 and @xmath190 are chosen as @xmath191 for positive number @xmath192 , the virtual sensor of sensor @xmath19 will be driven to sensor @xmath158 .",
    "note that when @xmath193 , @xmath194 will be the position of virtual sensor @xmath160 .",
    "however , for range sensor @xmath195 , it is difficult to obtain the information of the velocity of its neighbor , i. e. sensor @xmath158 , so we need an assumption on the velocities of all mobile sensors :    [ velassu ] for both sensor @xmath196 and the target , the velocities are bounded , i.e. , @xmath197 and @xmath198 for some positive @xmath199 and @xmath200 .",
    "if the estimation error of the target s velocity is small enough , from assumption [ velassu ] , the virtual sensor @xmath201 will still approach to sensor @xmath158 when the gains @xmath192 are taken large enough and so we can ignore the velocity of sensor @xmath158 in equation ( [ refdyna0 ] ) : @xmath202    from the fact @xmath203 and combining equations ( [ bearag ] ) and ( [ refdyag1 ] ) , the formation control ( [ refchag ] ) for sensor @xmath19 is given by @xmath204    then the result about the equilateral - triangle sensor deployment can be stated as follows :    with the modified unicycle model ( [ unicmd ] ) with control ( [ fmcont ] ) and any initial values @xmath205 @xmath206)$ ] , for all positive constants @xmath207 , there exist positive numbers @xmath208 and @xmath209 such that for every @xmath210 @xmath211    proof : consider system ( [ refdyag1 ] ) .",
    "let @xmath212 , then we have @xmath213 under assumption [ velassu ] we have from that @xmath214 the conclusions follow since @xmath215 and @xmath216    when the sensors achieve the desired formation , assumptions [ rank ] and [ jac ] will be guaranteed .",

    "an equilateral - triangle sensor deployment was proposed for the convergence of the filter by neighbor - based formation control .",
