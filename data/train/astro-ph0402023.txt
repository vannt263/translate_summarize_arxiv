    "hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe and therefore one may often encounter astronomical situations associated with the radiative transfer in a region with a very high neutral hydrogen column density @xmath10 .",
    "the extended atmosphere around a giant star is such an example , where near uv photons can be significantly scattered by atomic hydrogen ( e.g. isliker , nussbaumer & vogel 1989 ) .",
    "another example may be found in searches for the first objects that are responsible for the reionization of the universe .",
    "when the universe is still partially neutral before the completion of the reionization process , radiation should go through regions with a very high neutral hydrogen column density @xmath10 .",
    "in particular , the interactions with low energy electromagnetic waves with angular frequency @xmath2 are simply rayleigh scattering , where the scattering cross section is known to be proportional to @xmath11 in the limiting case where @xmath2 is much smaller than the angular frequency @xmath12 corresponding to the ly@xmath5 transitions .    in quantum mechanics ,",
    "the rayleigh scattering process is described by a second - order time dependent perturbation theory , where the scattering atom suffers level transition twice , one associated with the annihilation of the incident photon and the other associated with the creation of the scattered photon .",
    "the scattering cross section is known as the kramers - heisenberg formula , which is obtained by combining an infinite sum over all the bound @xmath13 states with the energy @xmath14 and an integral over all continuum states @xmath15 with the energy @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the rydberg energy ( e.g. sakurai 1967 ) .",
    "since the wave functions are analytically known for a single electron atom , the kramers - heisenberg formula for hydrogen can be written explicitly in a closed form .",
    "however , the kramers - heisenberg formula is unwieldy due to the presence of the infinitely many atomic levels contributing to the cross section . in the case of a hydrogen atom in the ground state interacting with incident radiation with @xmath2",
    "much less than @xmath12 , this inconvenience can be overcome by expanding the kramers - heisenberg formula in terms of @xmath18 .",
    "devoid of any resonance in the red region of ly@xmath5 , the scattering cross section is a well - behaved monotonic function of @xmath2 , and the leading term is proportional to @xmath11 , which admits an immediate classical interpretation . because @xmath11 dependence is the limiting behaviour of @xmath19 , inclusion of higher order terms will be useful to obtain more accurate cross section values in the red vicinity of ly@xmath5 .",
    "however , very near the ly@xmath5 resonance , the cross section is well approximated by a lorentzian and hence a polynomical approximation becomes poor .",
    "lee ( 2003 ) introduced an expansion of the kramers - heisenberg formula near ly@xmath5 , by computing the deviation from the lorentzian .    in this paper",
    ", we will provide and compute the accuracy of the expansions that provide the rayleigh scattering cross section redward of ly@xmath5 .",
    "the interaction of electromagnetic waves with an atomic electron is described using the kramers - heisenberg formula that is obtained from the fully quantum mechanical second - order time dependent theory ( e.g. sakurai 1969 , merzbacher 1970 ) . in terms of the matrix elements of the dipole operator",
    ", the kramers - heisenberg formula can be written as @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the electron mass , @xmath22 is the classical electron radius , and @xmath23 are polarization vectors of incident and scattered radiation respectively . here",
    ", @xmath24 is the angular frequency between the intermediate state @xmath25 and the ground state @xmath26 .",
    "the intermediate state @xmath25 includes all the bound @xmath13 and free @xmath15 states , and therefore the summation notation should be interpreted as a sum over all bound @xmath13 states plus an integration over all continuum @xmath15 states .",
    "the wigner - eckart theorem allows one to separate the matrix elements of the rank 1 tensor operator @xmath27 into the angular part and the radial part , where the radial part is given by the reduced matrix elements @xmath28 .",
    "( e.g. merzbacher 1970 ) . applying the wigner - eckart theorem , we obtain @xmath29 the dot product of the polarization gives rise to the same dipole type angular distribution as that for thomson scattering or classical rayleigh scattering ( e.g. lee & ahn 1998 , lee & lee 1997 , schmid 1989 ) .",
    "blueward of ly@xmath5 the cross section shows singular behaviours at resonances with bound excited states , which can be avoided introducing damping terms associated with the finite life times of excited states .",
    "however , redward of ly@xmath5 , there is no resonance and the cross section is a well - behaved monotonic function of @xmath30 .",
    "we have @xmath31 for any intermediate state @xmath25 redward of ly@xmath5 , which allows the expansion @xmath32    substituting these relations into eq .",

    ", we also show the result from the fully quantum mechanical computation , which was numerically obtained by performing the summation and integration appearing in the kramers - heisenberg formula .",
    "the exact cross section of rayleigh scattering by atomic hydrogen was presented by gavrila ( 1967 ) , who computed the green function in momentum space and provided the cross section in a tabular form . the crosses in the figure mark",
    "the result from the work of gavrila ( 1967 ) .",
    "it is noted that the cross marks are found on the solid line indicating excellent agreement .    because the ly@xmath5 resonance is located at @xmath61 , the covergence is rather slow for @xmath62 , which requires a large number of terms in the expansion .",
    "this behaviour is natural because the scattering cross section changes too steeply near resonance for any polynomial approximation to be suitable . on the other hand , in the region with @xmath63",
    "the agreement is almost perfect and the two results are not distinguished in the figure .    for comparison purpose",
    ", we make a plot for the polynomial fit to the result of gavrila ( 1967 ) obtained by ferland ( 2001 ) .",
    "he incorporated it in his photoionization code ` cloudy , ' in which the formula is quoted to be useful for radiation with @xmath64 , corresponding to @xmath65 .",
    "he used the lorentzian function instead for @xmath66 , where the resonance of ly@xmath5 dominates .",
    "the polynomial fit to the scattering cross section obtained by ferland ( 2001 ) is @xmath67{\\rm\\ cm^{2}},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which shows the same @xmath11 dependence in the leading term . in fig .  1",
    ", we also show the values obtained from this polynomial fit by a dotted line .    because the coefficients @xmath52 and @xmath59 are all positive , any finite expansion of eq .",
    "( 14 ) gives smaller values than the true ones obtained from the full kramers - heisenberg formula .",
    "therefore , the long dashed line is always located under the solid line .",
    "however , such a behaviour can not be seen in the case of the polynomial fit given by eq .",
    "( 16 ) , for which it crosses the solid line at @xmath68 .",
    "lee ( 2003 ) discussed the deviation of the scattering cross section from the lorentzian near ly@xmath5 resonance .",
    "the deviation is attributed to contributions from infinitely many other states than @xmath69 . according to him , near resonance",
    ", the kramers - heisenberg formula can be expanded in terms of @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the angular frequency corresponding to the ly@xmath5 transition .",
    "explicitly , the expansion can be written as @xmath72 the coefficients up to @xmath73 are given by @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the oscillator strength for the ly@xmath5 transition .    with these coefficients ,",
    "the rayleigh scattering cross section near ly@xmath5 can be written explicitly up to the fifth order @xmath76 where we define @xmath77 .    in fig .",
    "2 we make a plot of this expansion up to the fifth order represented by a dotted line .",
    "we also compare this result with the results from the full kramers - heisenberg formula and approximations with lower order corrections . in this figure ,",
    "the cross marks from the result of gavrila ( 1969 ) fall on the solid line representing the full kramers - heisenberg formula as seen in fig .  1 .",
    "the agreement with the fifth order correction to the lorentzian is excellent .",
    "it is very interesting to note that the approximation of the first order correction to the lorentzian depicted by a dashed line is poorer than just the lorentzian without any correction terms in the region @xmath78 represented by a dot - dash line .",
    "however , the first order approximation is excellent and better than the lorentzian very near the resonance , i.e. , @xmath79 , which is not plotted here ( see lee 2003 ) .",
    "this behaviour is explained by the alternating nature of the series given in eq .",
    "( 19 ) .",
    "as is done in the photoionization code ` cloudy ' by ferland ( 2001 ) , the rayleigh scattering cross section is approximated by the lorentzian near resonance @xmath80 and eq .",

    "( 14 ) up to @xmath60 for @xmath82 and eq .",
    "( 19 ) for @xmath83 is accurate within errors less than 4 % .",
    "in particular , it should be emphasized that significant errors are found only near the boundary region dividing the two expansions .",
    "in this paper , we obtained an expansion in terms of @xmath45 of the rayleigh scattering cross section by atomic hydrogen , which is applied in the low energy regime with @xmath82 . by combining this with another expansion of the kramers - heisenberg formula around the ly@xmath5 resonance in terms of @xmath84",
    ", we may have a wieldy and useful approximate formula for the rayleigh scattering process redward of ly@xmath5 by atomic hydrogen , which can be made arbitrarily accurate by inclusion of higher order terms directly calculated from the kramers - heisenberg formula .",
    "rayleigh scattering by atomic hydrogen is important only in the presence of a scattering region with a very high neutral hydrogen column density @xmath10 .",
    "such high column density media may be found in an extended atmosphere of a giant star where the mass loss process is already very important .",
    "isliker et al .",
    "( 1989 ) considered the effect of rayleigh scattering in binary systems containing a giant star . in these systems , for a given inclination and density distribution , the scattering optical depth is dependent on the wavelength , and therefore light curves differ according to the observed wavelength .",
    "this information may be quite important to investigate the mass loss process from a giant star .    in their analysis , isliker et al .",
    "( 1989 ) presented the rayleigh scattering cross section given by @xmath85 ^ 2,\\ ] ] where @xmath86 is the oscillator strength between @xmath87 and @xmath88 states . in their work",
    ", they neglected the contribution from the continuum states .",
    "however , as is noted in the previous section , the contribution from the continuum states to the low energy regime is not negligible , and hence caution should be exercised .    in more than half of the symbiotic stars , raman scattered o  vi 6827",
    ", 7088 features are seen , which are formed via raman scattering of o  vi 1032 , 1038 resonance doublet by atomic hydrogen .",

    "this process was first identified by schmid ( 1989 ) , where the scattering cross section is of similar order to that for rayleigh scattering ( e.g. lee & lee 1997 , nussbaumer , schmid , & vogel 1989 ) .",
    "a very high column density media may be found in an early universe when the reionization of intergalactic medium initiated by the first objects was not completed . in this partially ionized universe , a significant extinction around ly@xmath5",
    "is expected , which will result in a big absorption trough known as the gunn - peterson effect ( gunn & peterson 1965 , scheuer 1965 ) . thus far",
    "several quasars with redshift @xmath91 have been idenfied with gunn - peterson troughs ( becker et al .",
    "2001 , fan et al .",
    "it appears that the h  i column density that is responsible for these gunn - peterson troughs are not sufficiently high for applications of our current work , but may be high enough to see the deviation from the lorentzian approximation of the scattering cross section ( see lee 2003 , miralda - escud 1998 ) .",
