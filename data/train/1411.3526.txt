    "tauola @xcite is a monte carlo ( mc ) generator dedicated to the generation of @xmath3-lepton decays and it is used in the analysis of experimental data both at b - factories , babar @xcite and belle @xcite collaborations , and lhc @xcite .",
    "the generator simulates more than twenty decay modes , including both leptonic and hadronic modes .",
    "the leptonic decay modes of the @xmath3 lepton allow to test the universality of the lepton couplings to the gauge bosons .",
    "the hadronic decays ( in fact , the @xmath3 lepton due to its high mass is the only one that can decay into hadrons ) give information about the hadronization mechanism and resonance dynamics in the energy region where the methods of perturbative qcd can not be applied .",
    "also hadronic flavour- and cp - violating decays of the @xmath3 lepton allow to search for new physics scenarios .",
    "in addition , the tau lepton decay data allows us to measure the standard model parameters , such as the strong coupling constant , the quark - mixing matrix , the strange quark mass etc .",
    "the main problem in description of the hadronic decay modes of the @xmath3 lepton is the lack of a theory coming from the first principle in the energy region populated by the resonances ( i.e. in the region of 1 - 2 gev ) .",
    "the hadronic currents implemented in the first version of tauola @xcite as well as in the internal versions of the code used by babar and belle are based on vector meson dominance ( vmd ) approach . as shown in @xcite , figs .",
    "20.6.3 and 20.6.4 , the current version of tauola , used by belle collaboration does not give a satisfactory description of the data .",
    "this indicates that the model in the generator code should be updated . in last three years",
    "we have been working on the partial upgrade of the generator tauola by using the results for the hadronic currents calculated within resonance chiral lagrangian ( r@xmath4l ) formalism and fitting the model parameters to the available experimental data from b - factories .",
    "the r@xmath4l approach succeeds in reproducing low energy results , predicted by chiral perturbation theory , at least , at the next - to - leading order and also complies with qcd high energy constraints .",
    "alternative ad - hoc models , as vmd mentioned above , lack a link with qcd and thus can , at most , reproduce the leading order properties . presently the r@xmath4l currents for the main two - meson ( final states with two pion , pion - kaon , two kaons ) and three - pseudoscalar ( three pion , two kaon - one pion ) decay modes have been installed into tauola .",
    "this set covers more than 88@xmath5 of the hadronic @xmath3 decay width . the implementation of the currents , the related technical tests as well as the necessary theoretical concepts are documented in @xcite .",
    "studies of the one - dimensional three - prong decay modes by babar @xcite allowed us to compare r@xmath4l predictions with the measured data .",
    "we started with the @xmath6 mode .",
    "the choice of this channel was motivated by its relatively large branching ratio and the already non - trivial dynamics of three - pion final state .",
    "the first comparison to the babar preliminary data demonstrated satisfactory agreement with the three pion invariant mass spectrum and a mismatch in the low energy tail in two pion invariant distributions @xcite .",
    "this mismatch indicates that the lack of the scalar @xmath7 resonance , so called @xmath8 meson , in the r@xmath4l formalism may be responsible for this discrepency . a modification to the r@xmath4l approach to include",
    "the @xmath8 meson was proposed in @xcite and as a result the agreement with the data was improved by a factor of about eight .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 the theoretical framework for @xmath6 current as well as numerical results of the fit to data from babar",
    "is presented .",
    "section 3 contains the first results of the fit for @xmath2 and @xmath9 to data from babar and belle experiments , correspodningly .",
    "the summary of section 4 closes the paper .",
    "for the final state @xmath6 the following mechanisms of production have been taken into account :    * double resonance mechanism of production @xmath11 * single resonance mechanism of production @xmath12 * a chiral contribution ( a direct decay , without production of any intermediate resonance )",
    ".    the exact form of the hadronic current can be found in @xcite , section ii .    a resonance mechanism for the production of the @xmath13 via the lightest scalar resonance , @xmath7 , not present in the previous version of tauola @xcite , has been included in the simulation .",
    "the nature of the @xmath8 resonance , is still unclear and various descriptions are proposed by different groups : meson - meson molecular , tetraquark etc .",
    "@xcite . as a result of this behavior",
    "the @xmath8 resonance can not be easily included in the r@xmath4l formalism . in view of this",
    "we have decided to incorporate the intermediate @xmath8 meson state in a form that reproduces the r@xmath4l current structure ( i.e. contains single and double resonance contributions , see above ) , and represent the @xmath8 meson by an s - wave breit - wigner function following a phenomelogical approximation .    to obtain the numerical values of the model parameters ( the mass of resonances , vertex couplings etc , for details , see @xcite ) the three one - dimensional distributions , namely @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 ,",
    "have been fitted to the babar preliminary data @xcite .",
    "the partial width of the @xmath10 decay is normalized to that measured by babar @xmath17 gev @xcite .",
    "the first problem related with the fit is the calculation of the width in the @xmath18 propagator .",
    "the @xmath19 width can be written down as the imaginary part of the two - loop axial - vector - axial - vector correlation function with suitable flavour indices and is a double integral of the same hadronic form factors that fill in the hadronic currents ( for details , see @xcite , section 3 ) . calculating this integral at each point in the parameter space",
    "would degrade the performance of the mc generator by a factor of a thousand ( taking into account all decays rejected in the mc process ) . to avoid this ,",
    "tauola uses a 1000-point precalculated table of the resonance width which is later interpolated to obtain precise value for each point in phase space .",
    "our first attempt was to calculate the width only at the starting point of the fitting procedure and not to recalculate it during the fit .",
    "however , the lack of proper recalculation of this resonance turned out to greatly influence the results .",
    "a fitting procedure that relies on the width calculated only once ends up in a minimum completely off the global minimum found when this width is properly recalculated for each point in the parameter space .",
    "another approximation used in the @xmath19 width calculation was based on an estimate of the @xmath20-function , as detailed in @xcite .",
    "finally , after the introduction of the parallelized calculation , we were able to incorporate the precise calculations of the @xmath19 width table into the project .",
    "[ fig : prel2pi ]    to fit the data we used the minuit package through the root framework and the fit result is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : res ] , for the numerical values of the model parameters see table 1 in @xcite .",
    "the goodness of the fit is quantified by @xmath21 . to compare with the previous result @xcite we have estimated the @xmath22 value using the combined statistical and systematic uncertainties since only the total covariance matrix was publicly available at that time . for the present results we obtain @xmath23 , when the total covariance matrix is used and the conditions enabling direct comparisons are fulfilled .",
    "thus is eight times better than the previous result .",
    "the statistical uncertainties were determined using the hesse routine from minuit under the assumption that the correlations between distributions and the correlations related to having two entries per event in the @xmath24 distribution can be neglected .",
    "the fit results with estimated systematical and statistical errors , the statistical and the systematic correlation matrices are collected in tables 3 , 4 and 5 of @xcite , correspondingly .",
    "the following test has been done to check whether the obtained minimum is a global one and does not depend on the starting parameter values .",
    "we start from a random scan of @xmath25 points and select 1000 events with the best @xmath22 , out of which 20 points with maximum distance between then are retained and then these points are used as a start point for the full fit .",
    "we find that more than a half converges to the minimum ( table 1 in @xcite ) , the rest either reach the limits of the parametric range or converge to local minimum with higher @xmath22 .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the obtained result is stable and does not depend on the initial value of the fitting parameters . as an additional cross check we calculated the partial width resulting from the phase space integration of the matrix element @xmath26 gev which agrees with",
    "the one measured by babar @xmath27 gev @xcite .",
    "in addition , based on the fitted values of the r@xmath4l parameters we estimated the @xmath28 partial width : @xmath29 gev that is @xmath30 higher than the central pdg value and within the errors cited by pdg .",
    "the first preliminary results for the @xmath2 and @xmath1 modes are presented in figs .",
    "[ fig : prel2pi ] and [ fig : prelkpik ] . for the former ,",
    "we have fitted the absolute value of the pion form factor calculated within the dispersive representation @xcite and to the belle parametrization for the pion form factor , eqs .",
    "( 11)-(14 ) in @xcite ( at present the experimental errors are not included in the fit ) .",
    "the latter was carried out in the generalized version of the fitting strategy used for the @xmath6 mode presented above . in our approach",
    "we used the @xmath19 width calculated only at the beginning of the fitting and did not change it during the fit .",
    "an improved procedure might require a common fit of both @xmath6 and @xmath1 modes .",
    "[ fig : prelkpik ]",
    "in this paper we have discussed the status of the tauola project .",
    "the main attention was devoted to the results of the one - dimensional fit for the @xmath33 decay mode to the preliminary babar data .",
    "the theoretical approach was based on the resonance chiral lagrangian with an additional modification to the current to include the sigma meson . as a result , we improved agreement with the data by a factor of about eight compared with the previous results @xcite .",
    "we tested that the obtained result corresponds to a global minimum and that the fitting procedure does not depend on the initial values of the model parameters .",
    "nonetheless , the model shows discrepancies in the high energy tail of the three pion invariant mass spectrum , that may be related with missing resonances , e.g. @xmath34 , in the corresponding theoretical approach .",
    "we will come again to this point in future multidimensional analysis .",
    "we presented the first results of the generalization of the fitting strategy to the case of an arbitrary three meson tau decay , specializing to the @xmath1 decay mode .",
    "in addition we fitted the two pion form factor @xcite to the belle parametrization for it .",
    "the technical study of the fit stability and the correlation of the parameters is in progress .",
