    "the existence of the scalar - isoscalar @xmath3 meson as a broad @xmath4 resonance has long been controversial . recently , an increasing number of theoretical and experimental analyzes point toward the existence of this important meson @xcite .",
    "most of these analyzes find a @xmath3-pole position near 500-i250 mev @xcite .",
    "a direct experimental evidence seems to emerge from the d@xmath5 decay channel observed by the fermilab e791 collaboration , where @xmath3 meson is seen as a clear dominant peak with m@xmath6=478 mev and @xmath7=324 mev @xcite .",
    "since @xmath3 meson is a relevant hadronic degree of freedom , it must be incorporated into the analysis of hadronic processes .",
    "although at sufficiently high energies and low momentum transfers electromagnetic production of vector mesons on nucleon targets has been explained by pomeron exchange models , at low energies near threshold scalar and pseudoscalar meson exchange mechanisms become important @xcite . in particular ,",
    "the presently available data on the photoproduction of @xmath8 meson on proton targets near threshold can be described by a simple one - meson exchange model @xcite . in this picture ,",
    "@xmath8 meson photoproduction cross section on protons is given mainly by @xmath3 meson exchange .",
    "an important physical input for these studies is the coupling constant g@xmath0 .",
    "this coupling constant was estimated by calculating the @xmath9-vertex assuming vector meson dominance of the electromagnetic current and then performing a fit to the experimental @xmath2-photoproduction data .",
    "when this result was derived using an effective lagrangian for the @xmath9-vertex the value g@xmath0=2.71 is obtained for this coupling constant @xcite . since it plays an important role in hadronic processes involving @xmath3 meson , it is of interest to study this coupling constant from a different perspective other than vector meson dominance .    in this work ,",
    "we estimate the coupling constant g@xmath0 by employing qcd sum rules which provide an efficient method to study many hadronic observables , such as decay constants and form factors , in terms of nonperturbative contributions proportional to the quark and gluon condensates @xcite . in section 2",
    ", we give a qcd sum rules analysis of scalar current , derive a sum rule for the overlap amplitude @xmath10 of the scalar current to the @xmath3 meson state and estimate this amplitude since it is not available experimentally . in section 3 , we derive a sum rule for the coupling constant g@xmath0 and by utilizing the experimental value of @xmath11 , the calculated value of @xmath10 and the known values of condensates we estimate this coupling constant .",
    "let us here note that the nature of @xmath3 meson , whether it is a @xmath12 state or it is of another quark , gluon structure is still a matter of debate @xcite .",
    "the qcd sum rules approach @xcite is a model independent method to study the properties of hadrons through correlation functions of appropriately chosen currents . in the su(2 ) flavour limit m@xmath13 , we study the scalar - isoscalar mesons by considering the scalar current correlation function @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the interpolating current for @xmath3 meson .",
    "the two - loop expression for the scalar current correlation function @xmath16 in perturbative qcd was calculated @xcite , and it is given by the expression @xmath17\\right\\}~~.\\ ] ] qcd - vacuum condensate contributions to the scalar current correlation function @xmath18 were obtained by the operator product method @xcite , and they were found in the @xmath19=0 limit as @xmath20 we note that the term @xmath21 is not considered in the order m@xmath22 terms , as this condensate s magnitude , which is obtained by making use of gell - mann - oakes - renner relation as @xmath23 , is independent of quark mass @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the correlation function @xmath18 satisfies the standard subtracted dispersion relation @xcite @xmath24 where the spectral density function is given as @xmath25 .",
    "we parameterize the spectral density as a single sharp pole @xmath26 , where the overlap amplitude is defined as @xmath27 , plus a smooth continuum representing the higher states .",
    "the continuum contribution to the spectral density is estimated in the form @xmath28 where s@xmath29 denote the continuum threshold and @xmath30 is given by the expression @xmath31 with @xmath32 obtained from eq .",
    "( 2 ) and eq . ( 3 ) as @xmath33 . after performing the borel transformation",
    "we obtain the following qcd sum rule for the overlap amplitude @xmath34 of the scalar current @xmath35(1+\\frac{\\alpha_{s}(m)}{\\pi}\\frac{17}{3}-    \\frac{\\alpha_{s}(m)}{\\pi}\\int_0^{s_0/m^2 } w\\ln we^{-w}dw\\right\\ }   \\nonumber",

    "we choose s@xmath29=1.1 , 1.2 , 1.3 gev@xmath40 and we study the m@xmath40 dependence between 0.5 gev@xmath40 and 1.4 gev@xmath40 .",
    "the overlap amplitude as a function of m@xmath40 for different values of s@xmath41 is shown in fig . 1",
    "from which by choosing the middle value @xmath42 in its interval of variation we obtain the overlap amplitude as @xmath43 where we include the uncertainty due to the variation of the continuum threshold and the borel parameter @xmath44 .",
    "other sources of uncertainty are the errors attached to the estimated values of condensates as quoted above .",
    "if we take these errors into account in our analysis as well , we then obtain the value @xmath45 for the overlap amplitude .",
    "in order to derive the qcd sum rule for the coupling constant g@xmath0 , we consider the three point correlation function @xmath46 the interpolating current for @xmath47 meson @xcite is @xmath48 , and @xmath49 , @xmath50 are the electromagnetic and scalar currents , respectively .",
    "the theoretical part of the sum rule is obtained by calculating the perturbative contribution and the power corrections from operators of different dimensions to the three point correlation function @xmath51 . for the perturbative contribution",
    "we consider the lowest order bare - loop diagram .",
    "furthermore , we consider the power corrections from the operators of different dimensions , @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "we do not consider the gluon condensate contribution proportional to @xmath55 since it is estimated to be negligible for light quark systems .",
    "we perform the calculations of the power corrections in the fixed point gauge @xcite .",
    "we work in the limit m@xmath22=0 , and in this limit perturbative bare - loop diagram does not make any contribution . moreover , in this limit only operators of dimensions d=3 and d=5 make contributions that are proportional to @xmath52 and @xmath53 , respectively .",
    "the relevant feynman diagrams for the power corrections are shown in fig .",
    "2 .    in order to obtain the phenomenological part , we consider a double dispersion relation for the vertex function @xmath51 , and we saturate this dispersion relation by the lowest lying meson states in the vector and scalar channels .",
    "we obtain this way for the physical part @xmath56 where the contributions from the higher states and the continuum is denoted by dots . in this expression , @xmath57 has been determined in section 2 . the overlap amplitude @xmath58 of rho meson is defined as @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the polarization vector of the @xmath47 meson .",
    "the matrix element of the electromagnetic current is given as @xmath61 where @xmath62 and @xmath63 is a form factor with k(0)=1 .",
    "this expression defines the coupling constant g@xmath0 through the effective lagrangian @xmath64 describing the @xmath9-vertex @xcite .    after performing double borel transform with respect to the variables @xmath65 and @xmath66 , and by considering the gauge - invariant structure ( @xmath67 ) we obtain the sum rule for the coupling constant g@xmath0 @xmath68 where we use the relation @xmath69 . for the numerical evaluation of the sum rule we use the values @xmath70 , @xmath71 @xcite , and @xmath72 , @xmath73 . for the overlap amplitude",
    "@xmath34 we use the value @xmath45 that we have estimated in section 2 and for @xmath58 we use its experimental value @xmath74 as obtained from the measured leptonic width @xmath75 of @xmath47 meson @xcite . in order to analyze the dependence of g@xmath0 on borel parameters @xmath44 and @xmath76 , we study the independent variations of @xmath44 and @xmath76 in the interval @xmath77 as these limits determine the allowed interval for the vector channel @xcite .",
    "the variation of the coupling constant g@xmath0 as a function of borel parameters @xmath44 for different values of @xmath76 is shown in fig .",
    "3 , examination of which indicates that it is quite stable with these reasonable variations of @xmath44 and @xmath76 . we choose the middle value @xmath78 for the borel parameter in its interval of variation and obtain the coupling constant g@xmath0 as g@xmath79 where only the error arising from the numerical analysis of the sum rule is considered . the other sources contributing to the uncertainty in the coupling constant besides those due to variations of @xmath44 and @xmath76 are the uncertainties in the estimated values of the vacuum condensates .",
    "if we take these uncertainties into account , we then obtain the coupling constant g@xmath0 as g@xmath80 .",
    "our estimate of the coupling constant g@xmath0 is in agreement with its value deduced from the analysis using the vector meson dominance of the electromagnetic current for the @xmath9-vertex . on the other hand ,",
    "an independent anaysis @xcite utilizing the experimental value of the decay rate @xmath81 and using the values for the @xmath3 meson parameters @xmath82=478 mev and @xmath83=324 mev that are obtained from the fermilab e791 experiment gives the value g@xmath84 for this coupling constant .",
    "however , we like to note that in the present work we consider @xmath3 meson in the narrow resonance limit and do not take the finite width of @xmath3 meson into account .",
