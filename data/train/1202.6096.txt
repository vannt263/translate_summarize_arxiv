    "quantum information processing seeks to harness quantum mechanics to enhance information processing capabilities .",
    "just as classical communication and computation requires memory buffers , quantum information systems will require memories for quantum states .",

    "+ if , however , we move towards manipulation of the stored information , a new range of possible uses for quantum memories appear .",
    "for instance , the ability to coherently manipulate the spectrum of pulses would prove a key tool for allowing quantum information transfer between systems with different bandwidths .",
    "this ability could also lead to increased bit rates over quantum communication channels @xcite .",

    "multiplexing could be achieved with , for instance , different spatial @xcite , temporal @xcite or frequency modes in a quantum memory .",
    "being able to alter a pulse s shape , as well as its bandwidth , could also lead to increased bit rates due to a decrease in losses caused by pulse aberrations through various media ( i.e. optical fiber @xcite ) . +",
    "various coherent pulse manipulation techniques have already been demonstrated without the aid of a quantum memory .",
    "for instance , three - wave mixing @xcite , quantum pulse gates @xcite , and pulsed frequency up - conversion @xcite have all been shown to be able to coherently alter the temporal , and in some cases spectral , profile of optical pulses .",
    "work has also been carried out with pulse shaping and splitting inside a coherent memory using electromagnetically - induced transparency ( eit ) @xcite .",
    "+ in this paper we will investigate the coherent spectral manipulation abilities of the gradient echo memory ( gem ) scheme @xcite .",
    "gem has been shown to have high efficiencies @xcite and not add noise to the quantum state @xcite , while also being able to store up to 20 pulses simultaneously @xcite , making it a promising candidate as an optical quantum memory . + previous experimental work has shown that gem is capable of manipulating stored light in a number of ways .",

    "this does , however , place limitations on the operations that can be applied .",
    "using many physical memories as one memory network would automatically increase the resolution of the gradients with respect to the length of each sub - memory .",
    "another option for improving the resolution would be to move to an alternate gradient creation technique such as the ac stark effect @xcite .",
    "+ the coupling field - induced scattering was discussed in section [ sec : ff_filtering ] with regards to the extra decay of information that is left in the memory while other information is recalled .",
    "this is a concern as this scattering leads to a decoherence rate almost 10 times larger than other decoherence mechanisms present @xcite and can not be combatted in a single memory .",
    "however , this issue could be addressed with a network of memories if one were to use orthogonal polarizations for the probe and coupling fields and place polarizing beam - splitters between the memories .",
    "in this paper we have presented experimental demonstrations of theoretical spectral manipulation operations originally investigated in ref .",
    "we showed that using the gradient echo memory scheme we can alter the bandwidth ( and therefore temporal profile ) of a pulse , as well as change its centre frequency .",
    "we also demonstrated the ability of gem to act as a spectral filter and , using the frequency - encoding nature of gem , were able to recall a modulated pulse as its fourier transform .",
    "finally we showed that two initially time separated pulses , with the same or different frequencies , could be caused to interfere coherently at the output of the memory .",
    "these abilities could be used to improve qubit rates across quantum communication channels , as well as potential uses in quantum computing applications .",
