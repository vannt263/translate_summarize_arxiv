    "the @xmath0-meson distribution amplitudes ( das ) are key components for collinear factorization of the @xmath0-meson involved processes , such as the semi - leptonic decay @xmath9 and the flavor - changing - neutral - current decays @xmath10 and @xmath11 , which are important for extracting the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix elements and for searching new physics beyond the standard model .",
    "inversely , those processes could provide good test of various @xmath0-meson da models suggested in the literature .",
    "the @xmath0-meson das arouse people s great interest since the initial works of refs.@xcite on the light - meson das .",
    "the vector @xmath0-meson das have more complex structures than the light pseudoscalar das .",
    "there are chiral - even and chiral - odd @xmath0-meson das due to chiral - even and chiral - odd operators in the matrix elements .",
    "the @xmath0-meson thus has two polarization states , either longitudinal ( @xmath12 ) or transverse ( @xmath13 ) , which can be expanded over different twist structures  @xcite . in the paper",
    ", we shall concentrate our attention on the @xmath0-meson longitudinal leading - twist da @xmath1 .",
    "the leading - twist da @xmath14 can be expanded as a gegenbauer polynomial series  @xcite , i.e. @xmath15 where @xmath16 .",
    "the gegenbauer moments @xmath17 at any other scale can be obtained via qcd evolution equation .",
    "the evolution equation up to next - to - leading order ( nlo ) is available in ref.@xcite .",
    "theoretically , the gegenbauer moments have been studied via various approaches  @xcite .",
    "most of their predictions are consistent with each other , but are of large theoretical uncertainties .",
    "it is helpful to provide an accurate prediction for a better comparison with the forthcoming more accurate experimental data .    the conventional shifman - vainshtein - zakharov ( svz ) sum rules  @xcite provides a standard way to deal with the hadron phenomenology . within the framework of svz sum rules ,",
    "hadrons are represented by interpolating quark currents with certain quantum numbers taken at large virtualities .",
    "the correlation function ( correlator ) of those currents is introduced and treated by using the operator product expansion ( ope ) , where short- and long - distance quark - gluon interactions are separated .",
    "the short - distance part is perturbatively calculable , while the non - perturbative long - distance part can be parameterized into the non - perturbative but universal vacuum condensates .",
    "the svz sum rules is then achieved by matching to a sum over hadronic states with the help of dispersion relation .",
    "the introducing of vacuum condensates is the basic assumption of svz sum rules .",
    "those universal vacuum condensates reflect non - perturbative nature of qcd which can be fixed via a global fit of experimental data . as suggested by the background - field theory ( bft ) , the quark and gluon fields",
    "are composed of background fields and quantum fluctuations around them .",
    "this way , the bft provides a self - consistent description for those vacuum condensates and provides a systematic way to derive the svz sum rules  @xcite .",
    "the svz sum rules within the bft has been applied to deal with the pseudoscalar and scalar das  @xcite . in those calculations , because of the complexity of high - dimensional operators and also the contribution of high - dimensional condensates are generally power suppressed , one simply adopts the reduced quark propagators @xmath18 and the vertex operators @xmath19 , which keep only up to dimension - three operators .",
    "such a rough treatment is theoretically incomplete , which may miss some important high - dimensional condensates in the sum rules .",
    "their contribution may be sizable , especially to compare with the nlo qcd corrections to the perturbative part .",
    "thus to compare with the forth - coming more and more accurate data , it is helpful to take those high - dimensional terms into consideration",
    ".    we have deduced the formulas for the quark propagator @xmath18 and the vertex operators @xmath19 within the bft by keeping all terms in the ope up to dimension - six operators  @xcite .",
    "for example , the quark propagator is parameterized as  @xcite @xmath20 where @xmath21 stand for the propagator parts proportional to dimension-@xmath22 operators with type @xmath23 under the same dimension .",
    "those formulas help us to achieve a sound and accurate svz sum rules up to dimension - six condensates such as @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "their first applications for the heavy and light pseudoscalar das have been done in refs.@xcite .",
    "those applications show that the new propagators and vertex operators shall result in new terms proportional to the dimension - six condensates that are missing in previous studies but do have sizable contributions .",
    "we shall adopt those newly derived quark propagator and vertex operators to study the @xmath0-meson longitudinal leading - twist da @xmath1 .",
    "we shall then apply @xmath1 to deal with the @xmath26 transition form factors ( tffs ) within the light - cone sum rules ( lcsr )  @xcite . as a further step",
    ", we shall show their effects to the @xmath27-meson semi - leptonic decay width @xmath7 , which has been measured by the babar collaboration  @xcite .",
    "the remaining parts of the paper are organized as follows . in sec.[section:2 ] , we describe the calculation technology for deriving the moments of the leading - twist da @xmath1 within the svz sum rules . in sec.[section:3 ] , we present the numerical results for the moments @xmath28 , the decay width @xmath29 , and the ckm matrix element @xmath30 . sec.[section:4 ] is reserved for a summary .",
    "within the framework of bft , the gluon field @xmath31 and quark field @xmath32 in qcd lagrangian are replaced by @xmath33 where @xmath31 with @xmath34 and @xmath32 at the right - hand - side are gluon and quark background fields , respectively . @xmath35 and @xmath36 stand for gluon and quark quantum fields , i.e. , the quantum fluctuation on the background fields .",

    "a proper choice of gauge could make the sum rules calculation much more simplified .",
