    "the cosmic dark matter ( dm ) is an unknown matter which does not emit nor absorb any photon .",
    "there are many evidences for dm by various cosmological observations .",
    "the first evidence for dm was addressed by observing the motion of galactic clusters@xcite .",
    "the existence of the invisible mass in our galaxy was also reported @xcite .",
    "the ratio of the kinetic mass of the galaxy to the luminous mass of the galaxy gives an evidence of invisible matter .",
    "the luminous mass is determined by the total luminosity by stars and gas in the galaxy .",
    "the kinetic mass is determined by observing the rotation speed of the galaxy .",
    "the distribution of rotation speed in galaxies are shown in fig.[fg : rotation ] .",
    "the large amount of invisible mass distribution far from the galactic center was concluded by the flat behavior of the rotation speed .",
    "the indirect evidence for invisible mass was given by the observation of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) .",
    "cmb is the afterglow of the big bang which were emitted after 400,000 years after the beginning of the universe .",
    "the initial temperature of the cmb corresponds to the recombination epoch of the universe , about 3000 k. the wavelength of the cmb was stretched by the expansion of the universe to the present temperature which corresponds to 2.726 k.    the small deviation of the wavelength corresponds to the fluctuation of the density of matter in the region of the universe .",
    "the dense regions in the early universe evolved to the structures that we see today ; galaxies , clusters and superclusters .",
    "the angular size of the fluctuation gives the important information on the structure of the universe because the size depends on the curvature of the space between the emission point and the observer .",
    "the planck observed the cmb structure with the high angular resolution @xcite .",
    "the planck data determine the cosmological parameters to high precision from the cmb .",
    "the density parameter @xmath12 of the universe and the hubble constant @xmath13 are listed below .",
    "@xmath14 where @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are density parameters of baryon , cold dark matter ( cdm ) and cosmological constant , respectively .",
    "@xmath18 km / sec / mpc ) is the hubble parameter . the composition of the universe can not be dominated by baryons that we usually observe in the universe .",
    "other component are unknown dark matter and unknown dark energy .",
    "the dark matter is supposed to be unknown elementary particles that are proposed by the theories beyond the standard theory of elementary particles . from the view point of cosmology ,",
    "the main component of dark matter is supposed to be a non - relativistic particle which was decoupled from a cosmic radiation after the universe became cold .",
    "these particle is called the cold dark matter ( cdm ) and plays an important role in creating a large scale structure of the universe .",
    "there is , on the other hand , hot dark matter ( hdm ) which was decoupled from a cosmic radiation during the universe was hot . since the hdm particles travels with relativistic speed , they destroy the large scale structure .",
    "consequently , the hdm can not be a main component of the dark matter .",
    "the candidates for cdm particles are axion and wimps ( weakly interacting massive particles ) .",
    "the kamland - pico project is suitable for the detection of both axion and wimps . in the present paper ,",
    "we focus on the detection of wimps .",
    "wimps are the weakly interacting massive particles whose mass is expected to between 10 gev@xmath19 and 1000 gev@xmath19 where @xmath20 is the speed of light .",
    "the cross section of wimps - nucleus interaction is classified into three types , spin - independent ( si ) , spin - dependent ( sd ) and nuclear excitation ( ex)@xcite . the cross section dependence are briefly given as , @xmath21 where @xmath22 is mass number of the target nucleus . @xmath23 and @xmath24 are spins of the ground state and excited state of the target nucleus , respectively . @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the initial and the final momenta of incident wimp .    the mass density @xmath27 and the mean velocity @xmath28 of the wimps in the vicinity of the solar system has been calculated by observing the stellar motion of the galaxy@xcite .",
    "the obtained value of @xmath27 by various observation ranges from 0.3 to 0.5 gev@xmath29cm@xmath8 .",
    "the mean velocities range from 200 to 230 km / sec . in the present paper , the conservative values @xmath31 gev@xmath19/cm@xmath7 and",
    "@xmath33 km / sec are used for the analysis of wimps sensitivity .",
    "the signal for wimps in a radiation detector is given by a nuclear recoil by elastic or inelastic scattering .",
    "the energy spectrum of recoil nucleus observed in a detector is given by @xcite @xmath34 where , @xmath35 is the total event rate of wimps - nucleus elastic scattering , @xmath36 is the quenhing factor of detector response and @xmath37 is the form factor .",
    "@xmath38 is the mean kinetic energy of wimps and @xmath39 is wimps mass . @xmath40 and @xmath41 is the mass of target nucleus .    the electron equivalent energy @xmath42 is the observed energy which is calibrated by electron scattering .",
    "the nuclear recoil energy @xmath43 is the kinetic energy of recoil nucleus .",
    "the quenching factor for nuclear recoil @xmath36 is the important factor to estimate the energy spectrum of wimps .",
    "the detector response in a scintillator and semiconductor by nuclear recoil is much smaller than the one by electron with the same kinetic energy .",
    "a nuclear recoil gives only a small fraction of its kinetic energy to scintillation and ionization processes .",
    "the quenching factor @xmath36 is determined by the ratio of the scintillation output by nuclear recoil ( @xmath44 ) to the one by electron ( @xmath45 ) with the same kinetic energy@xcite as @xmath46 the values for various detectors were measured by neutron scattering@xcite .",
    "the energy threshold of the detector must be as low as possible to observe the wimps signal efficiently .",
    "many groups in the world are applying various types detector to search for wimps .",
    "the major experimental groups in the world are listed in table [ tb : groups ] .",
    ".dark matter searchers in the world .",
    "there are many other groups in the world . [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the purity of the nai(tl ) developed by this work reached the same level as the one of dama / libra was established .",
    "it should be remarked that the small concentration of @xmath3pb which is comparable to that of dama / libra . the effectiveness of resin to reduce a small density of lead ion was successfully verified .",
    "the expected background was simulated by geant 4.10 @xcite with the known radioactive impurities in the nai(tl ) crystal and the surrounding materials .",
    "the expected rate at 1 kev in electron equivalent energy was as small as 0.5 /day / kev / kg . the expected sensitivity to wimps candidates",
    "is drawn in fig.[fg : furosiki ] .",
    "the red solid line shows the expected sensitivity by 1 ton of our nai(tl ) for one year .",
    "the kamland - pico project using 1 ton of nai(tl ) quickly verify not only the annual modulating signal reported by dama / libra but also the candidates for light wimps signal reported by other groups .",
