    "the teichmller space of a surface admits several natural metrics , starting with the teichmller metric introduced by teichmller in 1939 , followed by the weil - petersson metric introduced by weil in 1958 , and by many others .",
    "it is probable that the third most active subject in the metric theory of teichmller space is now that of the metric introduced by thurston in 1985 and which is called now thurston s metric .",
    "the three metrics w mentioned , along with several others defined on teichmller space are extremely interesting and they were studied from various points of view : the infinitesimal structure ( finsler or riemannian ) , the geodesics , the convexity properties , the boundary structure , etc .",
    "some difficult questions concerning these properties were solved and others remain open and make the subject a living one .    in the present paper ,",
    "when we consider the theory for surfaces with boundary , we mean the non - reduced theory , that is , the homotopies that we consider , in the definition of the equivalence relation defining teichmller spaces , do not fix the boundary of the surface pointwise .",
    "in general , the metrics on teichmller space were defined for closed surfaces or surfaces with punctures ( or distinguished points ) .",
    "some of these metrics , like the teichmller metric , admit a straightforward generalization for surfaces with boundary , but other metrics do not generalize as such for surfaces with boundary , and one has to modify their definition .",
    "one example is thurston s metric , whose modification , the so - called arc metric , was studied in the papers @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "we shall recall the definition of the arc metric below .",
    "several basic questions concerning this metric still resist .",
    "for instance , it is unknown whether it is finsler , its isometry group is still not identified , and it is unknown whether this metric coincides with the lipschitz metric .",
    "( all these results are known for surfaces without boundary . ) in the present paper , we construct new families of geodesics for this metric . in order to state more precisely the results , we start with some notation .",
    "let @xmath0 be a surface of finite type with nonempty boundary .",
    "the hyperbolic structures on @xmath0 that we consider are those for which the boundary components are closed geodesics .",
    "the lengths of the boundary components of the surface are not fixed .",
    "a simple closed curve on @xmath0 is _ essential _ if it is neither homotopic to a point nor to a puncture ( but it can be homotopic to a boundary component ) .",
    "an _ arc _ on @xmath0 is the image of a compact interval of @xmath1 by a proper embedding , that is , the interior of the arc is embedded in the interior of @xmath0 and the images of its endpoints are on the boundary of @xmath0 . in this paper ,",
    "when we deal with homotopies of arcs , we only consider homotopies that are relative to @xmath2 , that is , they keep the endpoints of the arc on the boundary of the surface ( but they do not necessarily fix pointwise the points of that boundary ) .",
    "an arc is _ essential _ if it is not homotopic to an arc contained in @xmath2 .",
    "we shall also use the following notation :    @xmath3 is the set of homotopy classes of essential arcs on @xmath0 .",
    "@xmath4 is the union of the set of homotopy classes of essential arcs on @xmath0 and of the set of homotopy classes of closed curves homotopic to a boundary component of @xmath0 .",
    "@xmath5 is the set of homotopy classes of essential simple closed curves on @xmath0 .",
    "suppose that the surface @xmath0 is equipped with a hyperbolic structure @xmath6 . in any equivalence class @xmath7 , there is a unique geodesic arc whose length is minimal among the arcs in that class relative the boundary .",
    "this geodesic arc makes at its endpoints right angles with the boundary of @xmath0 .",
    "we denote by @xmath8 the length of this geodesic arc , and we call it the _ geodesic length _ of @xmath9 for the hyperbolic metric @xmath6 .",
    "likewise , for any element @xmath9 of @xmath10 , we denote by @xmath8 the length of its unique geodesic representative for the hyperbolic metric @xmath6 .",
    "let @xmath11 be the teichmller space of @xmath0 .",
    "we view @xmath11 as the space of homotopy classes of hyperbolic structures on @xmath0 with geodesic boundary , and where the lengths of the boundary components are not fixed .",
    "the _ arc metric _",
    "@xmath12 on @xmath11 is defined by the formula @xmath13 where @xmath6 and @xmath14 are hyperbolic structures on @xmath0 .",
    "this is an asymmetric metric ( that is , it satisfies all the axioms of a metric except the symmetry axiom ) .",
    "it was introduced in @xcite and it is an analogue for surfaces with boundary of thurston s asymmetric metric on the teichmller space of a surface without boundary ( possibly with cusps ) @xcite .",
    "it was shown in @xcite ( proposition 2.13 ) that one obtains the same metric by using the same formula but taking the supremum there over @xmath4 instead of @xmath15 . in other words",
    ", we also have @xmath16 the arc metric is also studied in the papers @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we now recall the definition of the lipschitz metric on the teichmller space of a surface with boundary .",
    "the definition is the same as the one of the lipschitz metric defined by thurston on teichmller spaces of surfaces without boundary .",
    "one first defines the _ lipschitz constant _ of a homeomorphism @xmath17 between two metric spaces by the formula @xmath18 the homeomorphism @xmath19 is said to be _ lipschitz _ if its lipschitz constant is finite .",
    "given an ordered pair of hyperbolic structures @xmath6 and @xmath14 on @xmath0 , the _ lipschitz distance _ between them ( and between the corresponding points in the teichmller space @xmath11 ) is defined as @xmath20 where the infimum",
    "is taken over all homeomorphisms @xmath21 in the homotopy class of the indentity of @xmath0 .    in the case of surfaces without boundary ,",
    "thurston s metric and the lipschitz metric coincide .",
    "this is a result of thurston in @xcite .",
    "it is unknown whether in the case of surfaces with boundary the lipschitz and the arc metrics coincide .    in thurston s theory for surfaces without boundary developed in @xcite , maps between ideal triangles are the building blocks for the construction of geodesics for thurston s metric on teichmller space .",
    "the geodesics obtained are the so - called  stretch lines , \" and thurston proves that any two points in the teichmller space of @xmath0 are joined by a concatenation of stretch lines .",
    "it is possible to construct a class of geodesics for the @xmath12-metric ( we call them @xmath12-geodesics ) using thurston s method for stretch lines .",
    "for this , a complete maximal geodesic lamination is needed ( in the language of @xcite , this will be the geodesic lamination which is maximally stretched ) ; for instance , we can take a lamination whose leaves spiral along the boundary components of the surface @xmath0 .",
    "we then apply thurston s method decribed in @xcite for the construction of stretch lines using the stretch maps between ideal triangles and gluing them over all the ideal triangles that are the connected components of the complement of the lamination . to see that the one - parameter family of surfaces obtained in this way is a @xmath12-geodesics",
    ", one can double the surface @xmath0 along its boundary components and consider the resulting one - parameter family of hyperbolic structures on the doubled surface @xmath22 .",
    "this is a geodesic for thurston s metric on @xmath22 , and the restriction to @xmath0 of this one - parameter family of deformations of hyperbolic structures is a geodesic for the @xmath12- and the @xmath23-metrics on the teichmller space of the surface with boundary .",
    "the @xmath12-geodesic defined in this way is of a special type ( that is , not all @xmath12-geodesics are obtained ) .",
    "along this geodesic , the lengths of all the geodesic boundary components of @xmath0 are multiplied by the same constant factor , cf .",
    "@xcite .",
    "another construction of @xmath12-geodesics in the setting of surfaces with boundary is obtained by taking as building blocks right angled hexagons instead of ideal triangles .",
    "we shall introduce canonical maps between such hexagons which depend on a parameter @xmath24 , and by varying @xmath24 we obtain geodesics for the arc metric .",
    "each right - angled hexagon belongs to such a family of deformations , and between each pair of hexagons of the same family there is a lipschitz map that realizes the best lipschitz constant in its homotopy class relative to the boundary .",
    "gluing the hexagons along pieces of their boundaries , we obtain deformations of the hyperbolic surfaces that are geodesics for the arc metric .",
    "these lines are geodesics for both the lipschitz metric and the arc metric and the lipschitz metric on the teichmller space of the surface with boundary coincide on these lines . by gluing surfaces with boundary along their boundary components , we obtain geodesics for the thurston metric that are different from the stretch lines .",
    "this generalizes the set of results obtained in the two papers @xcite and @xcite .",
    "for the construction of lipschitz maps between right angled hexagons , we shall divide each such hexagon @xmath25 into three regions ( one such region may possibly be empty ) which carry natural coordinates ; that is , the points in such a region are parametrized by pairs of real numbers . the coordinates in each region",
    "are induced by a pair of orthogonal foliations @xmath26 and @xmath27 on @xmath25 , which we now define .",
    "we consider three pairwise non - consecutive edges @xmath28 of a right angled hexagon @xmath25 , and we call them the _ short edges_. the three lengths @xmath29 of @xmath28 may or may not satisfy the triangle inequality . up to a permutation of the indices , there are three cases :    1 .",
    "type i : @xmath30 satisfy the three triangle inequalities .",
    "type ii : @xmath31 .",
    "type iii : @xmath32 .",
    "we now give another characterization of the three distinct types .    consider three non - intersecting geodesic lines @xmath33 in the hyperbolic plane ,",
    "relatively positioned so that for each geodesic @xmath34 , the other two geodesics @xmath35 are lying on the same side of @xmath34",
    ". then each pair @xmath36 @xmath37 has a common perpendicular geodesic segment @xmath38 @xmath39 .",
    "this common perpendicular segment , which we call a short edge , is unique .",
    "we denote by @xmath40 , the three geodesic lines that contain the edges @xmath28 respectively .",
    "the six geodesic lines @xmath41 enclose a hexagonal region ( figure [ hex ] ) .",
    "in hyperbolic geometry , two geodesics @xmath34 and @xmath42 having a common perpendicular are said to be _ hyper - parallel_. thus , for the time being , we exclude the possibility that some @xmath34 and @xmath42 are asymptotic to each other .",
    "( classically , in the latter case , @xmath34 and @xmath42 are said to be _",
    "parallel_. ) the side opposite to a short edge @xmath43 will be denoted by @xmath44 , and called a _ long edge _",
    "( figure [ hex ] ) .",
    "there exists a unique point @xmath45 which is equidistant from @xmath40 .",
    "the three types listed above correspond respectively to the cases where the point @xmath45 lies inside the right angled hexagon @xmath25 ( type i ) , or on one of the long edges @xmath46 ( type ii ) , or outside @xmath25 ( type iii ) ; cf .",
    "figure [ center ] .",
    "one should be aware of the fact that interchanging the short and long edges of a given right angled hexagon makes the resulting center @xmath45 different from the original center unless the hexagon has a @xmath47-rotational symmetry .    from now on ,",
    "when we refer to a right angled hexagon , it will be understood that a choice of the short and long edges has been made .",
    "the right angled hexagon @xmath25 is naturally equipped with a partial measured foliation ( that is , a measured foliation whose support is a _",
    "subsurface _ of @xmath25 ) which is a union of three foliated regions with disjoint interiors , @xmath48 , where each leaf of each of these foliations is a segment in the locus of equidistant points to one of the three long edges @xmath49 . in the hyperbolic plane ,",
    "equidistant points to geodesics are classically called hypercycles , and we shall use this terminology . note that one of these foliations might be empty .",
    "this occurs in type iii , where the triangle inequality among the lengths @xmath50s of the short edges @xmath43s is not satisfied .",
    "the three types of foliations corresponding to types i , ii and iii are represented in figure [ foliation ] from left to right respectively .",
    "the supports of the foliations @xmath51 by hypercycles have a natural structure of rectangles and these foliations are equipped with transverse measures induced from the lebesgue measure on the boundaries of the supports , whose total masses @xmath52 satisfy the equations @xmath53 with an appropriate and clear meaning when one of the @xmath54s is negative ( see figure [ negative ] ) .",
    "we denote the foot of @xmath45 on the geodesic @xmath55 by @xmath56 .",
    "we then have a tripod @xmath57 whose edges have equal lengths @xmath58 , and where each edge @xmath59 meets @xmath60 perpendicularly .",
    "in type i , corresponding to the case to the left picture of figures [ center ] and [ foliation ] , @xmath56 divides each short edge @xmath43 at an inner point , for each @xmath61 . in this case",
    "@xmath52 are all positive . in type ii ,",
    "two of the @xmath56s , say @xmath62 and @xmath63 , coincide with endpoints of @xmath64 and @xmath65 respectively . in this case",
    ", we have @xmath66 and the foliation @xmath25 is of the type depicted on the middle hexagon of figure [ foliation ] .",
    "finally , type iii corresponds to the case where two of the @xmath56 , say @xmath62 and @xmath63 , divide the short edges @xmath64 and @xmath65 externally . in this case",
    "we have @xmath67 , and the foliation @xmath25 is as depicted in the right hexagon of figure [ foliation ] .    in each case , the non - foliated region in @xmath25 is called the _ central region _ of that hexagon , and it will be denoted by @xmath68 . for type",
    "i , this region is bounded by three pieces of hypercycles distant from @xmath46 by @xmath69 . for types ii and iii , the central region is bounded by two hypercycles and one boundary geodesic segment . for type ii , we have @xmath66 and the geodesic boundary of the central region is the long edge @xmath70 .    in the type",
    "i case , as the distance from a long edge @xmath46 of length @xmath71 increases from zero to @xmath54 , the leaves of @xmath51 move from the long edge @xmath46 to one of the sides of the central region , which is itself a leaf of @xmath51 .",
    "we further extend the foliations of the rectangular pieces to the central regions by adding leaves which are also pieces of hypercycles so that we get a singular foliation of the whole hexagon @xmath25 , as indicated in the left picture of figure [ extend ] . in this picture",
    "the point @xmath45 is as before equidistant to the three lines @xmath40 , and it is joined to the short sides by geodesic segments .    in the cases of type ii and iii , we have singular foliations of the type depicted in the middle and right pictures of figure [ extend ] respectively , where the point @xmath45 is on a long edge in the middle picture , while it lies outside the hexagon in the right picture .",
    "we now look into the type i case more closely using the poincar disc model and taking the point @xmath45 at the center of this disc .",
    "the central region is divided into three pentagons @xmath72 by the geodesic tripod @xmath73 centered at @xmath45 , with the three edges having the same hyperbolic length @xmath12 , each edge meeting one of the short edges perpendicularly .",

    "a type ii and iii hexagon @xmath25 has a similar coordinate system , which is just the restriction of the three pentagons @xmath77s to the hexagon @xmath25 .",
    "first note that a congruent pair of hyperbolic geodesic quadrilaterals with three right angles with opposite orientations form a geodesic pentagon with four right angles ( see figures [ nh1 ] and [ qq ] below ) . with this in mind , we recall a set of classical formulae ( @xcite ) for a hyperbolic quadrilateral with three right angles , relating the side lengths and the non - right angle @xmath121 of the quadrilateral .",

    "<S> we construct one - parameter families of right - angled hexagons in the hyperbolic plane such that each right - angled hexagon belongs to such a family , and between each pair of hexagons in the same family we describe a lipschitz map that realizes the best lipschitz constant in its homotopy class relative to the boundary . </S>",
    "<S> this produces new geodesics for the arc metric on teichmller spaces of hyperbolic surfaces with nonempty boundary and as a by - product , we get new geodesics for thurston s metric on teichmller spaces of hyperbolic surfaces without boundary . </S>",
    "<S> the results generalize results obtained in the two papers @xcite and @xcite .    </S>",
