    "when a small isolated gas bubble , immersed in a liquid , experiences a high amplitude spherical sound field , it grows and contracts non - linearly .",
    "description of the dynamics of such non - linear motion is an old challenging problem .",
    "the complexities of the problem arise from the effects of heat conduction , mass diffusion , compressibility , viscosity , and energy losses involved in damped oscillations of the bubble .",
    "so far , many people have investigated this problem , each concentrating on different aspects of its complexities . however , a rather complete description has not been presented yet .",
    "lord rayleigh @xcite was the first who analytically solved the collapse of an empty bubble in an incompressible liquid .",
    "plesset @xcite subsequently studied the dynamics of a vapor - filled bubble in a time - dependent pressure field .",
    "noltingk and neppiras @xcite were the first people derived a differential equation for the gas bubble motion under the influence of such pressure field .",
    "the extension of this equation to the bubble motion in a compressible liquid has been studied by many authors ; herring @xcite , trilling @xcite , gilmore @xcite , keller and kolodner @xcite , hickling and plesset @xcite , jahsman @xcite , flynn @xcite , lastman and wentzell @xcite , keller and miksis @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "heat conduction effects were presented in the works of hickling @xcite , fujikawa and akumatsu @xcite , and yasui @xcite .",
    "in addition , the works of lfstedt _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , nigmatulin _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , and brujan @xcite are of the subsequent papers addressing this problem .    between all previous works , the most complete description of the bubble dynamics equations was presented by prosperetti and lezzi @xcite .",
    "they used a singular - perturbation method of the bubble - wall mach number and derived the following one - parameter family of equations describing the bubble motion in the first order approximation of compressibility @xcite : @xmath0 where , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 are the bubble radius , liquid sound speed , liquid pressure at infinity , and liquid density , respectively . also , @xmath5 is an arbitrary parameter .",
    "equation ( [ eq1 ] ) must be supplemented by a boundary condition equation at the bubble interface to relate the liquid pressure , @xmath6 , to the gas pressure inside the bubble . like all previous authors , prosperetti and lezzi @xcite used the following incompressible equation for this purpose : @xmath7 where , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 are the gas pressure at the bubble interface , liquid viscosity , and surface tension , respectively .",
    "most of the previously derived equations belong to this single parameter family of equations , corresponding to different values of @xmath11 . moreover , @xmath12 yields results in closest agreement with the numerical simulation of full partial differential equations @xcite .",
    "two specific approximations have been used in the derivation of eqns .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq2 ] ) .",
    "the first approximation is the negligence of the viscosity effects for the liquid motion around the bubble , which has been used in the derivation of eqn .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "in fact , eqn .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) has been derived from the euler equation , in which the viscosity is eliminated .",
    "note that the viscous term of eqn .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) has been resulted from the liquid viscosity at the bubble interface , but not from the bulk of liquid .",
    "the second approximation is the incompressibility assumption of the liquid and the gas at the bubble interface , which has been used in the derivation of eqn .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) .",
    "all of the effects of the liquid compressibility in the work of prosperetti and lezzi , as well as in all other previous works , have been resulted from the liquid motion around the bubble , but not from the bubble boundary condition equation .",
    "in fact , all previous authors , on one hand took into account the compressibility of the liquid motion around the bubble , but on the other hand neglected its consideration at the bubble interface .",
    "although , the two mentioned approximations have been used in the derivations of the existing bubble dynamics equations @xcite , but the applicability of these approximations for all times of the bubble motion needs to be clarified .",
    "especially , at the end of the collapse , when the bubble motion is significantly compressible , these approximations may be inapplicable .    in this paper , by eliminating the above mentioned approximations",
    ", we have originally modified the bubble dynamics equations .",
    "a new set of equations have been derived including all effects of the viscosity and compressibility of both the liquid and the gas .",

    "the influence of the added new terms arisen from the liquid viscosity has been numerically investigated .",
    "the results clearly indicate that the addition of the new terms considerably affects the bubble motion at the collapse time and during the bubble rebounds .",
    "to derive the bubble dynamics equations , we assume that the motion of the bubble interface and the infinitely extended surrounding liquid are always spherically symmetric . under this circumstance , the continuity and the momentum equations are as follows @xcite :    @xmath13 = - \\frac{\\partial \\,u}{\\partial r } - \\frac{2u}{r } = - \\delta , \\ ] ]    @xmath14 & = & - \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial r } + ( \\lambda + \\mu ) \\left [ { \\frac{\\partial } { \\partial r}\\left ( { \\frac{1}{r^2}\\frac{\\partial } { \\partial r}\\left ( { r^2u } \\right ) } \\right ) } \\right ] \\nonumber \\\\   & + & \\mu \\left [ { \\frac{1}{r^2}\\frac{\\partial } { \\partial r}\\left ( { r^2\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial r } } \\right ) - \\frac{2u}{r^2 } } \\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where , @xmath4 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 are density , velocity , pressure , and divergence of the velocity , respectively . also , @xmath9 and @xmath18 are first and second coefficients of viscosity .",

    "<S> non - linear equations of radial motion of a gas bubble in a compressible viscous liquid have been modified considering effects of viscosity and compressibility more complete than all previous works . </S>",
    "<S> a new set of equations has been derived including new terms resulted from consideration of the viscosity and compressibility not only at the bubble interface , but also in the bulk of liquid . </S>",
    "<S> the new equations are two non - linear coupled equations , which can not be merged into one equation unlike all previously derived equations . </S>",
    "<S> numerical calculations have been performed considering effects of heat and mass transfer at the bubble interface . </S>",
    "<S> the results indicate that the new terms exhibit an important damping role at the collapse , so that their consideration dramatically weakens the bubble rebounds after the collapse . </S>",
    "<S> dependence of this new damping mechanism to amplitude and frequency of the deriving pressure has been investigated . </S>"
