    "numerical methods are an important tool for the calculation of approximate solutions of stochastic differential equations ( sdes ) which possess no analytical solution formula .",
    "therefore , many approximation schemes have been developed in recent years and much research has been carried out to develop derivative free stochastic runge  kutta ( srk ) type methods @xcite .",
    "similar to the well understood deterministic setting of ordinary differential equations ( odes ) , one has to pay much attention to the stability properties of the solution as well as of the numerical approximations .",
    "therefore , implicit methods have been proposed for the strong pathwise approximation of solutions of sdes and their stability has been analyzed @xcite",
    ". however , for the approximation of moments of the solution process special numerical methods converging in the weak sense have to be applied ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) and a stability analysis has to be carried out similar to that for strong approximations @xcite . in the present paper , we present families of first and second order diagonally drift  implicit srk ( ddisrk ) methods for the weak approximation of sdes contained in the class of srk methods proposed by rler  @xcite .",
    "further , we analyze their asymptotic stability and mean  square stability for linear test equations with multiplicative noise . finally , the regions of stability of the ddisrk methods are compared to the regions of stability of the linear test equation .",
    "thus , in section  [ sec : sec - ord - srk ] we consider the class of srk methods and coefficients families for weak order one and order two ddisrk methods are presented .",
    "then , we discuss the concepts of stability for solutions of sdes and for numerical approximations in section  [ sec : stab - ana - sde ] and section  [ sec : numer - mean - square - stab ] , respectively . in section  [ sec : num - experiments ] , some numerical experiments are carried out in order to justify our theoretical results .",

    "for the weak approximation of the solution of the it sde  ( [ ito - sde-1 ] ) , we consider the class of srk methods introduced by rler  @xcite .",

    "the random variables of the method are defined by @xmath51 for @xmath52 with independent random variables @xmath53 for @xmath54 and @xmath55 for @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",

    "we choose @xmath53 as a three point distributed random variable with @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "the random variables @xmath55 are defined by a two point distribution with @xmath61 .",
    "the main advantage of this class of srk methods is the significant reduction of complexity compared to present srk methods in recent literature , because the number of stages does not depend on the dimension @xmath10 of the driving wiener process @xcite .",
    "we denote by @xmath62 and @xmath63 for @xmath64 the corresponding vectors of weights and by @xmath65 and @xmath66 for @xmath67 the corresponding coefficients matrices .",
    "then , the coefficients of the srk method  ( [ srk - method - ito - wm - allg01 ] ) can be represented by an extended butcher array : @xmath68 weak order one and two conditions for the srk method ( [ srk - method - ito - wm - allg01 ] ) have been calculated in @xcite by applying the colored rooted tree theory due to rler introduced in  @xcite .",

    "then , we can obtain @xmath103 from some order conditions of weak order two @xcite and from the classification given in @xcite in the case of an explicit srk scheme . on the other hand , since we assume @xmath104 , all conditions for @xmath105 to satisfy are @xmath106 only .",
    "therefore , we can consider arbitrary coefficients @xmath107 as long as @xmath106 is fulfilled for @xmath103 . as a result of this , the weak order two ddisrk schemes ( [ srk - method - ito - wm - allg01 ] ) are given by the infinite coefficients family ( [ srk - ddi - coefficients ] )    @xmath108    with @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "clearly , one has to solve 2 ( in general nonlinear ) systems of equations from the stage values , each of dimension @xmath42 , for the ddisrk method if @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
