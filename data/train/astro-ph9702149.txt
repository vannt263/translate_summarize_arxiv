    "the hot intergalactic medium in low redshift clusters of galaxies has been enriched in iron to @xmath3 solar ( @xcite , @xcite ) by processes that , if understood , are a powerful diagnostic of galaxy formation . since the mass in the x - ray emitting gas exceeds that in the stars in galaxies by factors of 2 - 10 ( assuming @xmath4 km s@xmath5 mpc@xmath5 as we do throughout this paper ; we also assume @xmath6 ) , the igm is the main reservoir of metals in clusters .",
    "moreover , the strong correlation of iron mass with optical light ( @xcite ) implies a coupling of the constraints on the evolution of metals from the x - ray data on high redshift clusters and the optical data on the evolution of elliptical galaxies . if , as many theorists believe , clusters are fair samples of the universe , as well as the only systems likely to have retained all the metals produced by stars , then studies of the evolution of the igm metallicity strongly constrain the star formation history in the universe .",
    "there were few measurements of fe in clusters at @xmath7 before the launch of the _ asca _ satellite ( @xcite ) .",
    "neither early results from _ asca _ ( @xcite , @xcite ) , nor subsequent detailed individual measurements ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , showed evolution in the fe abundance out to @xmath1 . here",
    "we report on a large sample of high signal - to - noise _ asca _ spectra of clusters at @xmath8 , and find no evidence for evolution of the cluster metal abundance .",
    "since recent optical data reveals only passive evolution in cluster ellipticals out to @xmath9 , most of the cluster metals were produced at @xmath2 .",
    "we thus infer much higher star formation rates in the @xmath2 universe than derived from optical / uv surveys .",
    "we extracted and analyzed @xmath10 spectra of clusters at @xmath8 from data in the _ asca _ public archives before 12/96 .",
    "we concentrate on the 21 high signal - to - noise observations with 90% confidence error in fe abundance @xmath11  a moderately large sample upon which simple and unambiguous statistical tests can be made . at @xmath12 kev ,",
    "the product of the flux , @xmath13 , and exposure time must exceed @xmath14 erg @xmath15 to attain this accuracy .",
    "for a typical _ asca _ exposure time of 40 ks ( net exposures for two clusters in our sample , ms1358 and ac118 , were @xmath16 ks ) , a minimum flux @xmath17 erg @xmath15 s@xmath5 is thus required . before the release of the _ rosat _ all - sky survey , such objects were rare : e.g. , in the ipc database only 19 clusters have @xmath8 and @xmath18 .",
    "cross - correlation of the _ rass _ and abell catalogs yields 50 clusters with @xmath19 at @xmath8 ( @xcite ) , but further cross - correlation with the _ asca _ observation log identifies only 19 clusters with @xmath18 .",
    "thus we include most of the high signal - to - noise , high-@xmath20 clusters .",
    "( the flux from one cluster that apparently met our criterion , abell 1774 , turned out to be dominated by an agn . )",
    "this subsample ( table 1 ) spans the bolometric x - ray luminosity ( about twice the 2 - 10 kev luminosity ) range from @xmath21 to @xmath22 erg s@xmath5 , overlapping the low-@xmath20 sample measured by previous satellites .",
    "we applied standard processing to the data ( e.g. , @xcite ) ; and , for both the sis and gis , used a @xmath23 extraction radius , corresponding to 3 mpc at @xmath1  sufficiently extended to include the total flux . at @xmath24 ,",
    "10 - 30% of the flux may fall outside the extraction radius .",
    "we used all - sky backgrounds accumulated during the _ asca _ deep survey pointings for clusters with @xmath25 , and background from the same field for the higher @xmath20 systems .",
    "spectra were fit to an isothermal , collisional equilibrium plasma model at the optical redshift of the source .",
    "the redshifts obtained from _ asca _",
    "data are within 0.013 of the optical values ( e.g. , for the relatively faint ms1358 the fitted redshift is @xmath26 0.323(+.011,-0.022 ) compared to @xmath27 0.327 , while for the brighter zw3146 @xmath26 0.292 ( + 0.004,-0.0061 ) and @xmath27 0.291 ) .",
    "cooling - flow - plus - isothermal - plasma models were used in cases ( zw3146 , a2390 ) where a cooling flow is clearly present in the _ rosat _ image ( cf .",
    "as found by @xcite , the extra component has little effect on the derived abundances of the isothermal plasma .",
    "our fits are in excellent agreement with results for those clusters in table 1 that were previously analyzed : rxj 1347 ( @xcite ) , zw3146 , a1835 and e1455 ( @xcite ) , a1204 ( @xcite ) , and ms0451 ( @xcite ) .",
    "( the results are new for all others . ) the parameters derived from _ asca _ spectra ( figure 1 ) are robust for these high flux objects .",

    "our sample of 21 clusters has nearly identical fe abundance properties to the low-@xmath20 _ ginga _ sample ( @xcite , @xcite ) , _ i.e. _ a mean abundance @xmath28fe@xmath29 and variance 0.076 ( figure 2 ) compared to @xmath28fe@xmath30 and variance 0.062 ( all errors are 90% confidence for one parameter of interest ) .",
    "a k - s test shows no significant difference between the samples .",
    "we find no evidence of systematic abundance variations with luminosity .",
    "the weak abundance - temperature correlation ( figure 3 ) is not significant at 90% confidence .",
    "we conclude that this sample , with @xmath28z@xmath31 , shows no statistical differences in fe abundance from a similar sample of low-@xmath20 objects .",
    "results for the systems with larger abundance errors agree with the above conclusions .",
    "although our sample is not flux- or redshift - limited , it has no obvious selection biases and should be representative of @xmath32 clusters .",
    "its mean luminosity , @xmath28log @xmath33 , and mean temperature , @xmath34 kev , are slightly higher than in the low-@xmath20 sample drawn from a flux limited survey ( @xmath28log @xmath35 , @xmath36 kev ) .",
    "the temperature - luminosity relationships of the @xmath32 and low-@xmath20 samples show no significant differences ( @xcite ) .",
    "in high-@xmath37 hierarchical clustering scenarios ( @xcite ) , the mass of rich clusters grows by @xmath38 from @xmath39 to the present .",
    "moreover , systems at @xmath9 evolve differently from a cluster of the same richness observed today , with high-@xmath20 clusters assembled over a shorter time interval and undergoing more merging in the few gyr prior to the epoch when they are observed .",
    "thus the present and low-@xmath20 samples should differ if the accreted material has distinct properties , and the surprising constancy of both the mean and variance of the fe distribution over this redshift range ( corresponding to a lookback time of @xmath401/4 - 1/3 the age of the universe ) argues for a very homogeneous accretion process or a low-@xmath37 universe where cluster growth is essentially completed at @xmath41 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the substantial spread in cluster metallicity at @xmath42 and @xmath43 is unexpected within purely gravity - driven hierarchical clustering scenarios .",
    "many of these clusters include an excess of blue galaxies compared to low-@xmath20 systems ( the `` butcher - oemler effect '' ) .",
    "none of these have anomalous metallicity : whatever processes converted high-@xmath20 blue spiral galaxies into low-@xmath20 spheroidal systems had no major impact on the igm .",
    "the absence of evolution over the past @xmath44 gyr implies early enrichment of the igm .",
    "thus , ram pressure stripping of infalling galaxies at low-@xmath20 can not dominate the enrichment , but much of the cluster fe could be produced by snia ( @xcite ) : reconciling large fe - mass - to - light ratios with modest present - day snia rates requires the rate to have a short rise time followed by steep negative evolution such that 90% of the fe is produced at @xmath45 .",
    "most of the cluster metals , perhaps including most of the fe , were produced at high @xmath20 by snii ( @xcite ) .",
    "the stars in elliptical galaxies that we see today come from the same population that produced the metals in the igm ( e.g. , @xcite ) ; moreover , the elliptical galaxies in several rich @xmath1 - 0.4 clusters of galaxies show only passive evolution ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the star formation in elliptical galaxies that produced the cluster metals must have stopped @xmath46 gyr before @xmath9 , placing the period of cluster metal formation at @xmath2  in excellent agreement with the lack of evolution inferred from _ asca _ data .",
    "this is in contrast to the history of metal production by disk galaxies , where star formation peaked at @xmath47 and continues through the present epoch ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the containment by the deep cluster potential of the metals synthesized and ejected by supernovae during the epoch when the stars that make up present - day elliptical galaxies formed , enables us to calculate the @xmath2 metal production by ( proto-)ellipticals and estimate their contribution to the total metals produced at @xmath2 and over the hubble time . assuming that relative abundances in clusters are constant",
    ", the mass in metals produced per unit ( present - day ) blue - band elliptical galaxy luminosity is @xmath48 in solar units . if the star formation ( though not necessarily the _ dynamical _ evolution ) in elliptical galaxy precursors proceeded in a similar way in the field and in clusters , then the product of the metal mass - to - light ratio and the early - type galaxy luminosity density ( @xcite ) yields the total mass density of metals from early - type galaxies ,    @xmath49    this is consistent with the value , derived by @xcite , required to account for the increase in stellar mass - to - light ratio with luminosity as due to stellar remnants from primordial star formation with an imf biased towards high mass stars .",
    "the metals ejected by proto - ellipticals , as calculated above , exceed what is estimated to be locked inside the stars in normal massive galaxies today by 2 - 5 ( @xcite ) .",
    "since the latter is consistent with the star formation rate derived from galactic uv light , star formation in proto - ellipticals must have proceeded in an obscuring environment or in sub - luminous fragments ( @xcite ) .",
    "since half the star formation in disks has occurred since @xmath50 but , star formation in ellipticals was completed by @xmath50 ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , proto - spheroids increasingly dominate star formation at early epochs .",
    "if elliptical galaxy star formation predominantly occurred at @xmath51 , the average metal production rate was    @xmath52    compared to averages from high-@xmath20 , uv surveys of galaxies of 0.89 , 0.46 , and 0.17 @xmath53 yr@xmath5 mpc@xmath54 for @xmath2 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 , respectively .",
    "thus , global star formation rates derived from uv surveys are severe underestimates . at @xmath57 , where @xmath58 redshifts out of the ground - based optical band , [ oii]3727 or the uv continuum",
    "are used as star formation indicators .",
    "recent astro-2 uit and hut observations ( @xcite ) show that there is often a shift of a factor 2 in specific star formation rates using the uv continuum instead of @xmath58 ; and furthermore , comparison of iras @xmath59 luminosities with @xmath58 values indicates another factor of 2 offset ( see also , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "since even small amounts of reddening are sufficient to remove objects from the high-@xmath20 galaxy samples and to change their inferred star formation rates , we believe that the cluster data are much more robust indicators of the true metal formation history of the universe .",
    "the fe abundance of the intergalactic medium in rich clusters of galaxies undergoes little if any evolution from @xmath1 to @xmath60 .",
    "this strongly constrains high-@xmath37 hierarchical theories in which clusters rapidly grow during this period .",
    "a real and constant spread in the metallicity at all observed redshifts implies stochasticity , not only in the construction of these massive systems , but also in the efficiency and/or timing of star formation within their constituent galaxies .",
    "a self - consistent history of star formation in disk galaxies has emerged from a synthesis of observations of damped @xmath61 systems , deep ground based and _ hubble space telescope _ surveys of star forming galaxies , and spectral synthesis and chemical evolution modeling . however , this census of star formation in the universe is incomplete , since most of the metals produced at high @xmath20 were expelled from galaxies .",
    "a complementary picture of star formation in proto - spheroids is emerging , driven by the lack of evolution in igm metallicity reported here and optical evidence that together indicate that cluster metals originate from the precursors of elliptical galaxies at @xmath2 .",
    "the @xmath62-dependence of @xmath63 ( @xcite ) and gross and relative igm elemental abundances ( @xcite ) are explained if this star formation produces an imf skewed toward high masses , precipitating a massive outflow of metal - enriched gas .",
    "this star formation must occur in sub - luminous fragments or be dust - enshrouded to avoid detection by uv surveys , but the ir and/or uv background produced is within reach of near - future measurements ( @xcite ) .",
    "the igm of rich clusters are reservoirs for primordial metal - rich galactic outflows driven by this star formation , and their investigation with _",
    "asca _ has enabled us to discover that @xmath64 times more metals were created at @xmath2 than are inferred from high redshift galaxy data .",
