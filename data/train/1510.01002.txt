    "political networks encompass several types of connectivity  based on social ties , voting similarities , and other features  and it is important to analyze them to understand political systems @xcite . in political science ,",
    "the availability of public data ( sometimes aided by various digital media  @xcite ) provides a strong and compelling encouragement for quantitative analyses of politics @xcite .",
    "in addition to legislative bodies , on which we focus in the present study , numerous types of political networks have now been investigated quantitatively .",
    "these include judiciary systems such as the united states ( u.s . )",
    "supreme court  @xcite and the european court of justice  @xcite ; international relations  @xcite ; political communication  @xcite ; lobbying  @xcite ; and political behavior  @xcite .    as with other types of networks ,",
    "it has thus far been most common to examine political networks terms of standard ( i.e. , `` monoplex '' ) networks , which are represented mathematically as ordinary graphs @xcite .",
    "the types of legislative networks that have been studied in this way include ones defined based on committee assignments @xcite , legislation cosponsorship @xcite , party faction  @xcite , and similarity of voting patterns @xcite .",
    "ideas from temporal networks @xcite and multilayer networks @xcite have been incorporated into investigations of some time - dependent @xcite and multiplex networks @xcite in data from politics and international relations .",
    "investigations of the dynamical restructuring of political bodies have yielded insights into the aggregate tendencies of party polarization and realignment @xcite and in the study of politically developing ( or democratizing ) countries  @xcite , and using approaches from temporal and multilayer networks promises to generate further insights in these applications .    in the present paper , we consider the dynamical restructuring of a legislature in a democratizing country by examining a time - dependent network of legislators in the congress of the republic of peru  @xcite . we construct a multilayer temporal network using bill cosponsorship relationships among politicians . in our multilayer representation of these temporal networks , the edge weights in each layer",
    "arise from the similarities in cosponsorship patterns during the time window that is associated with the layer . because cosponsorship relationships are one of the main types of work allocated to the legislative branch of the government in peru , studying them allows us to focus on official activities of politicians instead of either speculative or scandalous ones ( social ties , bribery , etc . ) . to examine how cohesive sets of legislators with cosponsorship relationships change over time , we examine time - dependent community structure  @xcite .",
    "we find a dramatic rearrangement of community structure in the peruvian congress , which we contrast to the relatively stable political bipolarity in the u.s .",
    "senate . for the peruvian congress , considering a cosponsorship relationship alone does a good job of successfully revealing the underlying political power rearrangement , and it also appears to deliver more subtle information than official party membership .",
    "we quantify the rearrangement of political groups by examining changes over time in time - dependent community structure  @xcite .",
    "we then do similar computations for legislation cosponsorship networks in the u.s .",
    "senate and compare our results to our observations for the peruvian congress .",
    "the rest of our paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : method ] , we present the data set of peruvian legislators , discuss how we use it to construct time - dependent networks , and indicate our methodology for analyzing these networks .",
    "we discuss our results for the peruvian congress and u.s .",

    "[ cols= \" < , > , > , > , > , > \" , ]     [ table : geolocation_flex_us ]      motivated by the work in  @xcite , we define the `` flexibility '' @xmath0 of legislator @xmath1 to be the number of times that he / she changes community membership during the observation time in the multilayer network .",
    "that is , @xmath2 \\ , , \\label{eq : flexibility}\\ ] ] where we recall that @xmath3 indicates the community assignment of legislator @xmath1 in layer @xmath4 .",
    "the term `` flexibility '' was used in  @xcite in a study of functional brain networks , and we adopt it for the present paper .",
    "a complementary concept is network `` persistence , '' which was defined in ref .  @xcite as @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the number of entities ( e.g. , legislators ) in a multilayer network .    in fig .",
    "[ lpn_multilayer_results ] , we show the maximum modularity and mean flexibility @xmath7 for the temporal multilayer legislator - projected network from multilayer modularity maximization  @xcite using a variant @xcite of the louvain method  @xcite . the flexibility results in fig .",
    "[ lpn_multilayer_results](b ) suggest that there is a nontrivial relationship between flexibility values and the parameters @xmath8 and @xmath9 , so it is helpful to explore these results further for several values of @xmath10 . in this paper",
    ", we present results for four parameter combinations : @xmath11 , and @xmath12 .",
    "although the two values of the interlayer coupling strength @xmath9 seem large in comparison to those in previous works  @xcite , we wish to use values that are comparable to intralayer coupling strengths ( i.e. , the intralayer edge weights ) , which we take to be the numbers of cosponsored bills . with these computations ,",
    "we are able to illuminate interesting political structures in the peruvian congress and to subsequently contrast them with community structure in the u.s . senate . in figs .",
    "[ paint_drip_plots_g1 ] and [ paint_drip_plots_g1_5 ] , we illustrate time - dependent community structure for several values of @xmath10 .",
    "larger values of @xmath8 capture smaller communities ( and a larger number of communities ) , and larger values of @xmath9 capture more temporally coherent communities ( as expected )  @xcite .",
    "we then perform similar computations for u.s .",
    "senate cosponsorship networks .",
    "we downloaded the u.s .",
    "senate data from  @xcite .",
    "these data start from the 93rd congress ( which covers the dates 3 january 19733 january 1975 ) and go through the 110th congress ( which covers the dates 3 january 20073 january 2009 ) .",
    "we construct a multilayer u.s .",
    "senate cosponsorship network using the same procedure ( see fig .",
    "[ bipartite_procedure ] ) as for the peruvian congress , except that each time window in the former covers an entire 2-year congress ( in contrast to a half - year for peru ) .",
    "we also use the same values of the resolution parameters @xmath8 and @xmath9 .    with our calculations ,",
    "we demonstrate that multilayer modularity maximization can yield insight about time - dependent community structure in real political cosponsorship data , and the adjustable intralayer resolution parameter and interlayer coupling allow one to explore structure at multiple scales .",
    "we now compare results from our two data sets , and we interpret our results on the peruvian congress in more detail in section [ sec : restructuring ] .",
    "we illustrate time - dependent community structure for the u.s .",
    "senate in fig .",
    "[ us_paint_drip_plots_g1 ] ) .",
    "unsurprisingly , we observe a relatively stable bipolar structure ( democrats versus republicans ) in the u.s .",
    "senate , which contrasts sharply with the more intricate temporal community structure in the peruvian congress .",
    "although the observation periods  5 years versus 36 years for the whole duration , and one half - year versus two years for each layer  for the two legislatures are different ( which is a very important issue to consider in our comparison of the two legislatures ) , we stress that it is the _ shorter _ of the two that experiences much more dramatic changes in community structure , further emphasizing the sharp contract in community - structure dynamics in these two countries . for instance , unidad nacional ( un ) , which was composed of four parties , dissolved in 2008  @xcite after eight years of political alliance . this could help explain the restructuring of its year-2007 members that we observe in figs .",
    "[ paint_drip_plots_g1](a ) and [ paint_drip_plots_g1_5](a , b ) .",
    "figures  [ paint_drip_plots_g1 ] and [ paint_drip_plots_g1_5 ] also highlight the loyalty of politicians in the partido aprista peruano ( pap ) and the fujimori group ; none of their members left those groups to join another group .",
    "by contrast , the party unin por el per ( upp ) , which started the 0607_i congress ( in july 2006 ) with a majority of the seats ( 45 seats out of 120 ) , lost members to other groups in congress . by the end of the 1011_ii session in 2011 , upp had only 7 remaining members  @xcite .",
    "figures [ paint_drip_plots_g1_5 ] and ( especially ) figure [ paint_drip_plots_g1 ] illustrate the switching of the upp legislators to other parties .",
    "we discuss such political reorganizations further in section [ sec : restructuring ] .      to discuss time - dependent community structure in the peruvian congress in more detail , we need to give some context about the legislators and the peruvian political system .    *",
    "a legislator must obtain support from at least five other legislators to present a bill proposal .",
    "each legislator represents one region ( similar to a u.s .",
    "state ) in peru , and each region can have one or more legislators from one or more parties .",
    "lima , the capital of peru , has 30% of all seats @xcite .",
    "a legislator needs to be part of a political group that includes at least six legislators to be represented on the congress board . *",
    "the peruvian congress has only one chamber . in 2006",
    ", 25 parties competed for 120 seats , and 7 parties won at least one seat  @xcite .",
    "the party ( pap ) of the president of the executive branch did not obtain a majority ( it won 36 seats ) in congress , and the party ( upp ) of the runner - up for president won the largest number of seats ( 45 seats ) .",
    "pap is a traditional and longstanding party ( almost 90 years old ) and upp was composed primarily of new regional leaders and popular figures ( from outside the political arena ) . at the beginning of the 20062011 congress , it was not clear whether upp would be able to remain cohesive and gain more support from the minority groups to control the congress or if the traditional cohesiveness of pap s legislators would play in pap s favor and allow them to keep control of congress .",
    "the winning party ( pap ) in the executive branch garnered the second - largest number of seats ( with 9 fewer than the majority ) and kept control of the congress .",
    "they presided over every congress board , and they never lost their internal cohesion , as none of their members abandoned the party to join another group .",
    "by contrast , upp and other parties lost legislators to other political groups or founded new groups . among the 45 legislators that upp had in 2006 , only 7 remained in 2011  @xcite",
    "figures  [ paint_drip_plots_g1_5 ] captures reorganizations in the political parties .",
    "for instance , we observe opportunistic behavior of legislators who tend to strengthen ties outside their original community .",
    "this seems to have occurred not only among legislators whose original party had a small share in congress but also to members of the majority party ( upp ) , which included many of the most flexible legislators .",
    "eight legislators were members of at least three different groups ; seven of these legislators were from upp , and one legislator ( wilson michael urtecho medina ) was from the un . by examining time - dependent community structure , one can also see the emergence of new groups ( e.g. , partido demcrata peruano , which included carlos torres caro , gustavo espinoza , and roco gonzlez from the upp ) .",
    "one can also observe the cohesiveness in pap and the fujimori group ( i.e. , alianza por el futuro ) .",
    "legislators from upp were not the only ones who were switching to other groups .",
    "moreover , the switching behavior of legislators may have been reinforced when un , which originally had 17 seats , ceased to be an alliance in 2008 .",
    "the legislators from solidaridad nacional ( sn ) , one of the parties in the un alliance , formed a new group during the second half of the 20062011 congress ( when the 2011 presidential elections were in sight ) . officially , however , upp supported sn in the 2011 election @xcite .",
    "we check for geographical correlations with our observations by comparing individual legislators district location to their flexibility [ see eq .  ] , which indicates how often they change community assignment . in fig .",
    "[ geolocation_flex ] , we plot individual legislators flexibility values on top of their district locations on a map of peru , and we observe that the central part of the country ( including the capital city lima ) tends to have more flexible legislators .",
    "we list some notably flexible legislators in table  [ table : geolocation_flex ] .",
    "our discussions above suggest that peruvian legislators need to be strategic to maximize his / her political opportunities .",
    "for example , they can either take a `` loyalist '' or an `` opportunist '' strategy . in the latter strategy",
    ", a politician moves to what appears to be a more promising group or party for their political future .",
    "moreover , one can examine the loyalty level of parties based on how many legislators remain with them over time .",
    "for example , during the 20062011 congress , pap and the fujimori group kept all of their members .",
    "additionally , as we have seen above , having a significant presence in the peruvian congress is not sufficient to ensure loyalty : upp had the majority but lost several legislators to other groups . such strategic behavior can result from several possible causes :    * the number of legislators that are needed to found a group is six , which can encourage members of parties with fewer than six seats to switch to other groups ( even to ones with a rather different political ` ideology ' or ` identity ' ) .",
    "* there is a current trend of low reelection rates in the peruvian congress , so as an election draws near , legislators may need to develop a strategy to distance themselves from parties that become unpopular and associate more closely with groups that become popular . *",
    "another current trend is for party leaders to invite popular figures to their congressional roster .",
    "this may affect the cohesiveness of a party .    by 2011",
    ", twelve legislators were in a different party than the one to which they were associated during the 2006 elections",
    ". only one of them was reelected in the 2011 election .",
    "nine of the twelve were not from lima , and none of those nine were reelected .",
    "although party switching is considered to be an effective strategy for short - term gain , the very low reelection rate in the last three congressional elections ( 2001 , 2006 , 2011 ) may also suggest that it is not an effective long - term strategy . to investigate such a hypothesis",
    ", it will be important to compare the peruvian congress to congresses in other nations .",
    "in contrast to party switching in the peruvian legislature , u.s .",
    "senators have much firmer community memberships , and their flexibility does not seem to include as many geographic characteristics .",
    "we show their flexibilities on a map of the u.s . in fig .",
    "[ geolocation_flex_us ] , and we again observe a bipolar structure among the u.s . senators .",
    "we list some notably flexible senators in table  [ table : geolocation_flex_us ] .",
    "the list depends sensitively on the value of the intralayer resolution parameter @xmath8 ( e.g. , it consists mostly of republicans for some parameter values but not for democrats for others ) , in contrast to our observations for the peruvian congress .",
    "we also recall that using different values of resolution parameters can be helpful for investigating different structural features ( e.g. , ones with different sizes ) in networks @xcite .",
    "we examined time - dependent community structure to explore dynamical restructuring in the peruvian congress in the 20062011 session by studying networks constructed from ( publicly available ) legislation cosponsorship data .",
    "our computations give a lens with which to view the frequent switches in the political group affiliations of legislators in peru , and our investigation illustrates a dissolution of the majority party at the beginning of 2006 peruvian congress .",
    "we contrasted these peruvian politics with the political climate in the u.s .",
    ", in which there are two highly polarized political parties .    from a more general standpoint ,",
    "our calculations indicate that even cosponsorship data alone is able to reveal political restructuring in legislative bodies . for countries , such as peru , in which democratic institutions are still immature",
    ", it should be very insightful to use quantitative methods such as network analysis to analyze political restructuring during the maturation process of governmental bodies .",
    "as more data become available amidst the modern data deluge , it will be possible to conduct further investigations to elucidate both political and social network structures among legislators .",
    "future research can include focusing on bills rather than politicians , studying change points in the temporal dynamics  @xcite , examining the role of overlapping communities , pursuing case studies in other countries , and more .",
    "it is interesting to examine the relationship between public labels such as party membership and quantities ( such as flexibility ) that one can measure from procedures like time - dependent community detection using ( publicly available ) legislation cosponsorship data .",
    "ideally , one can use dynamic network analysis to reveal insights that complement those from more traditional techniques ( e.g. , statistical analyses ) in quantitative and qualitative political science .",
