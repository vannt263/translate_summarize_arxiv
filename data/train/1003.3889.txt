    "exploring the relation between the gas content and star formation rate ( sfr ) of galaxies is crucial to understanding galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "this is required to understand the nature of sf , the parameters that regulate it , and its possible dependence on local and global galaxy properties ( e.g. , silk 1997 ; elmegreen 2002 ; krumholz & thompson 2007 ; mckee & ostriker 2007 ) .",

    "in fact , the physics associated with the conversion of gas into stars inside galaxies is overwhelmingly complicated , so that theoretical models generally resort to scaling laws that are calibrated using observations of nearby galaxies .    @xcite first suggested the existence of a power law relation between surface densities of sfr and gas masses .",
    "kennicutt ( 1998 ; k98 hereafter ) presented a calibration of the schmidt law with a slope of 1.4 in log space , which has since been the most widely used in the community .",
    "k98 fit the local populations of spiral galaxies and ir - luminous galaxies ( lirgs / ulirgs ) , with the gas mass including both neutral ( hi ) and molecular ( h@xmath0 ) hydrogen for spirals , and molecular gas only for ( u)lirgs ( as their hi content is likely negligible ) .",
    "the molecular gas component is routinely estimated using its most luminous tracer , carbon monoxide ( co ) , that is generally optically thick .",
    "this requires an empirical derivation of the conversion factor to derive molecular gas masses from co luminosities ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "k98 used the galactic value for all objects in his sample .",
    "@xcite showed that @xmath2 is smaller for local ( u)lirgs than for spirals , by about a factor of 6  see a detailed discussion and additional references in the review by @xcite .",
    "@xcite applied such different conversion factors for spirals and ( u)lirgs , resulting in a steeper relation with a slope of about 1.7 .",
    "observations of high redshift submm selected galaxies ( smgs ) can also be fit by the same relation , following @xcite who argued that a ulirg - like @xmath2 is appropriate for smgs .",
    "integrated quantities , @xmath3 and ir luminosities ( @xmath4 ) also appear to follow a correlation with a slope of 1.7 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "[ fig : mgasdyn ] shows a remarkably tight trend : sfr/[m_yr^-1 ] = 1.42 ( m_h2/_dyn)/[m_yr^-1 ] -0.86    with an error in slope of 0.05 and a scatter of 0.25  dex .",
    "[ fig : mgasdyn ] suggests that roughly 1050% of the gas is consumed during each outer disk rotation for local spirals , and some 30100% for bzk , @xmath5 galaxies and local ( u)lirgs .",
    "some smgs / qsos might even consume their gas in less than one rotation .",
    "the bimodal behavior in fig.[fig : mgas_scat][fig : kslaw ] obviously depends on our assumptions for @xmath37 .",
    "even though we have assumed the most accurate values that are available in the literature , one should keep in mind that this factor is still relatively poorly constrained . a possible variation of @xmath37 ,",
    "e.g. , as a function of galaxy properties , may change the simple picture outlined here .",
    "however , based on our current understanding , this is unlikely to greatly affect the overall conclusions . working only with observed quantities ,",
    "the bzk galaxies are already offset from local ulirgs in the @xmath3/@xmath4 diagram by a factor of 3 ( d10 ) .    in summary",
    ", the observations of near - ir selected galaxies at @xmath6 do not fit a single relation of @xmath38 versus @xmath4 , neither in terms of integrated quantities nor of surface densities ( figs .  [",
    "fig : mgas_scat ]  and  [ fig : kslaw ] ) .",
    "there appears to be two main sequences , one for disks and one for starbursts , with the latter having 10 times higher @xmath4 at fixed @xmath38 ( either integrated , or for surface densities ) .",
    "however , all populations define a single sequence when dividing the gas masses or surface densities by the respective dynamical timescales .",
    "[ fig : mgas_scat][fig : kslaw ] can not be interpreted in terms of a single average trend for all populations with a large intrinsic scatter .",
    "significant _ systematic _",
    "shifts are observed between the bzk and @xmath52.3 normal galaxies and other highly star forming galaxies , like local ( u)lirgs and smgs .",
    "it is worth recalling here that major differences exist in the properties of local disk galaxies versus local ( u)lirgs , and the same is observed ( at least on average ) between distant near - ir selected bzk galaxies and smgs ( see d10 , in particular sect .  7.4 , for a detailed discussion ) .",
    "overall , this dichotomy in physical properties of spirals/(u)lirgs and bzks / smgs makes it less surprising that the two classes define separate sequences in the @xmath39/@xmath4 plane and correspond to two distinct sf modes .",
    "previously it was argued that above 100  @xmath11  pc@xmath26 the gas conversion factor would drop by a large factor ( see , e.g. , the discussion and references in * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this does not seem to be the case for bzk galaxies ( d10 ) , that exhibit sf at 10 times higher gas and sfr surface densities than are seen locally .",
    "one could thus wonder how the same sf mode can be maintained at such high gas surface densities .",
    "it appears that the velocity dispersion is high in these systems ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , probably due to high turbulence .",
    "the implication would be that bzks have considerably thicker disks than those of local spirals .",
    "a higher gas filling factor in bzk galaxies might also apply .",
    "we now discuss how the observed differences in the @xmath38 versus @xmath4 plane could be interpreted .",
    "we note that the dichotomy could be altered in the @xmath38 versus sfr plane if stars were formed with different imfs in disks and starbursts .",
    "for example , if the @xmath4 to sfr conversion factor was lower for ( u)lirgs and smgs by a factor of 10 , then if we were to plot sfr instead of @xmath4 in figs .",
    "[ fig : mgas_scat][fig : kslaw ] we would basically end up with a single sf sequence .",
    "it has been claimed that the imf in bursts could be top - heavy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "while the general consensus is that the appropriate imf for local spirals is bottom - light as in chabrier ( 2003 ) or @xcite , very little is known observationally for the case of local ( u)lirgs and even less for high redshift galaxies . in principle , the imf might explain the bimodal behavior at least in part .",
    "on the other hand , we have shown that the ratio of @xmath4 to @xmath38 correlates inversely with the dynamical timescales of the systems .",
    "the systematic differences disappear once the gas masses are divided by @xmath29 , given that ( u)lirgs and smgs have much shorter @xmath29 than disk galaxies at @xmath40 .",
    "this is an important result because , for the first time , we show that global galaxy properties ( that determine @xmath29 ) are related to the regulation of a local ( punctual ) process like sf .",
    "the dynamical time is expected to scale with the gas volume density ( @xmath41 ) as @xmath42 ( e.g. , silk et al .",
    "this suggests that the different @xmath43 ratios are not driven by the imf ( a difference in the imf would break the single relations found using @xmath29 ) but by the fact that in some galaxies the gas can reach high volume densities and the systems can have short dynamical timescales so that the fuel is consumed more rapidly and the resulting sfr per unit of gas mass is higher .",
    "this is consistent with the existence of a unique and approximately linear correlation between @xmath4 and hcn luminosity for spirals and local ( u)lirgs @xcite and qsos ( with the exception of the highest redshift objects ; riechers et al .  2007 ; gao et al.2007 ) .",
    "the hcn luminosity is a measure of _ dense _ gas , requiring h@xmath0 volume densities @xmath44  @xmath45 , while co can be thermally excited for densities @xmath46  @xmath45 .",
    "based on the hcn/@xmath4 relation , the bimodal trends of @xmath4 to @xmath38 in disks versus starbursts can be interpreted in terms of a similarly bimodal behavior for the dense gas fractions , with roughly 10 times higher fraction of dense gas in the starbursts compared to disks at fixed @xmath4 ( but also with about twice higher dense gas fractions in bzks versus local spirals ) . all the observations might thus be explained by a genuine increase of sfr efficiency in some galaxy classes , probably due to the concentration of the gas at high volume densities .",
    "major mergers or other kinds of instabilities appear to be the most natural explanation for the increased efficiencies in the starbursts ( although not all mergers will necessarily produce this effect , di matteo et al .",
    "this is not a new scenario . a higher sf efficiency in merger - driven starbursts than in rotating disks",
    "has often been implemented in semianalytical models of galaxy formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although this has been usually interpreted as the natural outcome of a single sf law with an exponent @xmath47 , as long as mergers make gas lose angular momentum and concentrate in the galaxy center .",
    "however , in such implementations the occurrence of very high sf rates in gas - rich disks is neglected ; they thus have a bimodality in surface density , not in the sf law .",
    "our analysis suggests that the original k98 calibration can account for the properties of disk galaxies at low and high redshifts but would underestimate the sf efficiency of starbursts by a factor of 10 . a sf law with a higher exponent of 1.7 ( bouche et al .",
    "2007 ) would in turn overestimate sf efficiency of gas - rich disks by a similar amount .",
    "an implementation of such a double sf law would surely influence predictions from semianalytical models of galaxy formation .",
    "the difference in @xmath9 for disks and starbursts helps to _ hide _ what we are interpreting here as large differences in the sf efficiency , expressed in terms of @xmath43 , by reducing the observed differences in @xmath48 .",
    "there seems to be a conspiracy at work such that the particular physical conditions that lead to high @xmath43 in starbursts also determine variations in @xmath9 that obscure observationally the differences in sf efficiency .",
    "we emphasize thus that the distinction of starburst ( or merging vs non merging ) systems is important for interpreting co observations , although this may be difficult on a case by case basis .",
    "we caution that blindly applying the same conversion factor to all high - z observations can lead to confusion .",
    "also , care must be taken that sfr / ir - luminosities are accurately derived .",
    "the estimates for bzk galaxies here are based on the cross - comparison of 3 independent sfr indicators that agree within each other very well , and overall on the global assessment by daddi et al .",
    "( 2007ab ) on sfr measuraments of near - ir selected galaxies at @xmath49 . on the other hand , purely radio selected or mid - ir selected populations are likely to produce a mixed bag of merging systems and disk galaxies and can be affected by agns .",
