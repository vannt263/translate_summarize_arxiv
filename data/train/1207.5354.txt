    "several measures have been proposed to characterize and quantify quantum correlations beyond entanglement  @xcite .",
    "one such measure of quantum correlations , that is shown to be useful in dqc1  ( deterministic quantum computation with one quantum bit )  @xcite , grover search  @xcite algorithms and remote state preparation  @xcite , was introduced by ollivier and zurek and is called quantum discord  ( qd )  @xcite .",
    "it is introduced as a mismatch of quantum version of two classically equivalent expressions of mutual information and has attracted a lot of attention , recently  @xcite .",

    "the behavior of correlations under decoherence and/or dissipation have been also an active area of research  @xcite .",
    "since any realistic quantum system inevitably interacts with its environment , the environment - induced - noise may cause the system to lose energy  ( dissipation ) and/or coherence  ( dephasing ) .",
    "it is expected that the quantum correlations would be easily destroyed by such unavoidable noises .",
    "in fact , entanglement is very fragile and can cease to exist in a finite time when the state of the system exceeds a certain level of mixture .",
    "this phenomena is known as entanglement sudden death  ( esd )  @xcite .",
    "contrary to esd , the quantum correlations beyond entanglement , such as qd , are more robust against noise ; they decay exponentially  @xcite or suffer only instant death  @xcite .",
    "since the set of states with only classical correlations contain a tiny volume in the whole hilbert space compared to that of the volume of the set of separable states  @xcite , this , indeed , explains the robustness of qd to sudden death  ( also see ref .",

    "moreover , it was shown by many groups , both experimentally and theoretically , that qd exhibits noise - free - area for a finite time interval contrary to entanglement which dies very quickly  @xcite .",
    "some necessary and sufficient conditions for constant ( geometric ) quantum discord for certain states under local noise have been given  @xcite .",
    "moreover , decoherence free subspaces  ( dfs ) also provide a mechanism to preserve quantum correlations perfectly and are investigated as another avenue for error - free quantum computation  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , local memoryless noise acting on only one party of the two qubit system initially in a fully classical state was found to create a significantly high qd , while entanglement can not be created by such local and memoryless noise .",

    "since entanglement is very fragile under the detrimental environmental effects , qd is hoped to be used as a fundamental resource for the noisy - implementation of quantum information protocols that rely on quantum correlations beyond entanglement  @xcite .",

    "3 shows that bell like initial states , @xmath116 , with @xmath117 or @xmath118 have maximally discordant mixed separable state under both the individual , @xmath31 , and the collective independent noises , @xmath30,@xmath31 . since @xmath105 as shown in eq .",
    "( [ case3ss ] ) , we are also able to suggest a more general class of initial states that includes bell states , the so - called @xmath123-states in the form @xmath124 where the steady state qd is maximal ( @xmath78 ) in the absence of entanglement for every @xmath123 values between @xmath125 .",
    "@xmath123-states are known to form the lower bound for quantum discord for a given entanglement of formation  @xcite .",
    "intriguingly , they provide the upper bound of qd for eof=0 under @xmath90 , @xmath91 case .    noise assisted creation of quantum correlations are sometimes attributed to back - action of the environment and/or memory effects  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the environment modeled as noisy external magnetic field in the present study is both classical and markovian .",
    "classical environments are not able to store quantum correlations , and the considered noises in the present problem is markovian , so there are no memory effects . because of these , there would be no back - action on the system via noisy magnetic fields here .",
    "a natural question that arise in the present case is the source of high steady state qd achieved even from initial product states . to answer this question",
    ", we analyze a problem which is similar to the one outlined above , but the noisy magnetic fields at each qubit act locally , and compare the steady states of this dynamics with that of the global magnetic field case .",
    "the hamiltonian with the local fields can be given as : @xmath126 , with non - zero average noise strengths @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",
    "substituting the considered hamiltonian into liouville master equation and applying the considered stochastic averages yield , @xmath129-\\gamma_{\\omega}/4\\sum_{i = a , b}[\\sigma_x^i,[\\sigma_x^i,\\rho]]$ ] where @xmath130 and @xmath131 .",
    "it is straightforward to show that for an initially x - structured density matrix , the steady state density matrices would not contain coherence components under the individual , @xmath30 , and the collective , @xmath132 , noises .",
    "this means that the steady states contain no qd . on the other hand , under @xmath31-type noise , the steady state populations would be equally weighted  ( i.e. , 1/4 ) , while the coherences are @xmath133 .",
    "in fact , this steady state is fully classically correlated since it is diagonal in the basis resulting from the tensor product of two local orthogonal basis , @xmath134,@xmath135 , where @xmath136 . as a result , under local transverse and/or longitudinal memoryless classical noises , the steady states",
    "are fully quantum uncorrelated as quantified by qd and eof .",
    "mathematically speaking , the cross average noise strength terms , @xmath137 and @xmath138 , that are considered to be non - zero for the global field case , are responsible for the steady states with high qd .",
    "this effect is sometimes regarded as the effect of common environment mediated indirect qubit - qubit interaction  @xcite .",
    "we have investigated the dynamics of quantum  ( such as entanglement and quantum discord ) and classical correlations as well as the steady state properties  ( such as geometric measure of quantum discord and linear entropy ) for two qubits subject to longitudinal and/or transverse noisy magnetic fields .",
    "we have shown that starting from different initial product or correlated states , each of the considered noises alone or both of them acting together can lead to steady states which can carry the maximum possible quantum discord for a separable state .",
    "increase of quantum correlations under noisy conditions is sometimes attributed to the back - action of the environment or the memory effects in the environment - system interaction . in the model studied here ,",
    "there is no back - action or the memory . to better understand the source of the steady state qd creation in the present model , we have also considered a similar model in which noise acts on the individual qubits locally and found that steady states contain no quantum correlations for this case",
    "therefore , the global nature of the noise is found to be responsible for the saturation of the maximally discordant mixed separable steady states .",
    "moreover , two independent noises in the system are found to enhance both the steady state randomness and the relevant quantumness measure , the so - called quantum discord , in the absence of entanglement . on the other hand ,",
    "the geometrically defined version of qd  ( gmqd ) is found to disagree with the rise of steady state qd with randomness for some initial states .",
    "one should note that the model system given by hamiltonian , eq .",
    "( [ hamiltonian ] ) , is an important model and the prototypical example of nuclear magnetic resonance which was also implemented recently in the observation of berry s phase in a solid - state qubit  @xcite .",
    "it would be very desirable to investigate the role of @xmath139 and @xmath140 , which are neglected in the present letter , together with their noisy components on quantum correlations for external fields acting locally or globally on qubits which is left for future investigations .",
