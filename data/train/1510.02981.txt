    "for example it was shown that diffusion and especially the temperature dependence of grain boundary diffusion in ecap - processed ni are quite intricate @xcite .",

    "recently volumetric changes at isochronal annealing of hpt - processed cu were reported @xcite .",
    "the objective of the present investigation is to combine volumetric ( dilatometry ) and energetic ( calorimetry ) studies with microstructure studies to characterize the different defect types and to study the temperature regimes of their annealing in detail .",
    "furthermore , the measurements were extended to specimens with post - deformation annealing , i.e. , pre - annealing with respect to the measurement , as well as to specimens that had been deformed at elevated temperatures ( see tab .  [ table ] ) .",
    "this unique combination of different analysis methods and different specimen conditions allows for a comprehensive estimation and determination of values for basic defect parameters such as : the absolute vacancy concentration , the dislocation density , the grain boundary expansion and the excess of grain boundary expansion , here especially applied to the case of ecap deformed @xmath1  wt% ni . the data are critically discussed with respect to data on kinetic properties of interfaces and defect mobilities along short - circuit paths in the same ni material determined previously @xcite . the microstructure characterization is shown to be essential for rigorous analysis of the volumetric effects .

    "this gives access to absolute changes in free volume fractions down to about @xmath21 .",
    "measurement of the sample / reference pair was performed using a constant , high - purity argon gas ( 5n ) flow inside the sample chamber . for the study of the defect annealing kinetics",

    "it was shown that under certain conditions the percolating porosity with the volume fraction of several ppms may persist the microstructure recrystallization if initial grain size amounts to several hundreds nanometers or less , whereas the dominant fraction of microvoids sinters during annealing @xcite .",

    "[ fig : hot]b ) . on the other hand ,",
    "for the sample deformed at room temperature and annealed at @xmath3  k ( green ) the amount of free volume release is most pronounced above @xmath41  k , whereas the total volume released between @xmath65 and @xmath67  k is almost of the same amount as for the three samples , fig .",
    "[ fig : hot]a .",
    "it suggests that the warm deformation at @xmath36  k introduces dislocations which are removed by annealing at almost the same temperature .",
    "deformation at an even higher temperature , @xmath37  k , results in dislocation configurations for which a higher thermal activation for removal is required and with a small effect of grain growth . on the other hand , grain growth during linear heating is less pronounced in the samples deformed at 473  k ( p6 ) and at 673  k ( p7 ) ( the average grain size amounts to about @xmath58 to @xmath40 m even in the initial , post - deformation state ) , while grain growth is significant in the sample deformed at room temperature and annealed at 480  k ( p5 ) before the dilatometry measurements .",
    "the defect volume release in the sample deformed at 473  k ( p6 ) starts at a temperature about @xmath19  k higher with respect to the sample that was deformed at 293  k ( p3 ) and then the two dilatometry curves run almost parallel up to the temperature of @xmath39  k , fig .",
    "[ fig : hot]a",
    ". this fact indicates a similar amount of dislocation - type defects released in both samples in this temperature interval and a smaller concentration of stored vacancies in the sample deformed at 473  k ( p6 ) .",
    "the difference in the length changes at @xmath45  k between samples p3 and p6 ( i.e. the black and red curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : hot]a , respectively ) is about @xmath144 and it translates into the difference between the corresponding concentration of deformation - introduced vacancies of about @xmath145 .",
    "a vacancy - related peak could hardly be revealed for the length changes of the sample p7 ( i.e. the blue line in fig .",
    "[ fig : hot]a ) and is below the resolution limit of the present experiments .",
    "in the present investigation it is demonstrated for ecap - processed ni that volumetric and stored energy studies as realized by difference dilatometry and differential scanning calorimetry in combination with detailed microstructural characterization are complementary approaches ideally suited for the in - depth analysis of atomic defects . besides the results given in the preceding section the following main aspects are to be highlighted .    *",

    "spd deformation increases the excess volume related to grain boundaries .",
    "the absolute value of such an excess of the grain boundary expansion is small and does not exceed 5 to 10% .    the study has been performed on technically pure ni that allowed qualitative separation of various stages of defect evolution which can be prescribed by specific deformation - induced defects . in the previous research on grain boundary diffusion in the same material @xcite ,",
