    "@xmath11 for all @xmath12 .",
    "the second property is known as the _ parallelogram law_. the global canonical height is of fundamental importance in the arithmetic of elliptic curves , due in part to its functoriality .",
    "the height appears in basic conjectures such as birch - swinnerton - dyer and there is a deep conjecture known as the _ elliptic lehmer problem _ , see @xcite , concerning lower bounds for the height .",
    "besides theoretical considerations however , it sometimes happens that one really wishes to compute the value of the height ( for example , to compute the determinant of the height - regulator matrix in searching for curves of large rank ) .",
    "silverman @xcite described an algorithm for computing the global height , which can be made arbitrarily accurate . in the rational case , this is implemented in pari - gp ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the algorithm in @xcite requires the discriminant of the curve to be completely factorized ; computing the height when the discriminant can not be factorized in reasonable time is considered in @xcite .",
    "silverman s method requires much less than the full factorization of the discriminant but still requires some factorization . in principle",
    ", the method extends to the general algebraic case , though there is currently no implementation of silverman s algorithm in the general case .",
    "when it is implemented , it is likely to enjoy the same high accuracy it does in the rational case .",
    "however there seems to be a small class of curves for which it is vulnerable ( see examples [ silnodo ] and [ stillnodo ] in section [ examples ] ) .",
    "tate s definition of the global height gives a factorization - free approach to computing the global height .",
    "let @xmath13 denote the set of valuations of @xmath0 , each one corresponding to an absolute value @xmath14 ( see @xcite for background ) .",

    "tate s definition of the global canonical height is @xmath22 knowledge of the naive height is essentially equivalent to knowledge of the minimal polynomial .",
    "tate s definition is not usually considered to be a very useful method for actually computing the height . in principle",
    "it is accurate : however , it requires the computation of large integers and this not only slows it down but makes high accuracy impossible in practice . on the other hand",
    ", it does always give an answer because no factorization is needed .",
    "the aim of this note is to exhibit an alternative factorization - free method for computing the global height of an algebraic point on an elliptic curve which stands somewhere between the two algorithms above . like the method in ( [ tatesdefinition ] ) ,",
    "ours is extremely simple , requiring almost no knowledge of the number field or the elliptic curve and it does not require the curve to be in minimal form .",
    "however , our method gives more information than ( [ tatesdefinition ] ) since it also yields the archimedean and non - archimedean parts of the height separately .",
    "( if the factorization of the discriminant is known then it will give a complete decomposition of the global height as a sum of local heights . )",
    "our method can also be made much quicker .",
    "it gives less accuracy than silverman s algorithm but high accuracy is not always required . in certain cases ,",
    "our method can be used in tandem with silverman s algorithm : see example [ tandem ] in section [ examples ] .",
    "an example of a calculation which does not require great accuracy is the search for algebraic points with small height .",
    "this requires an accuracy of only 3 or 4 significant figures together with an easy way of handling algebraic number fields .",
    "calculations such as these would shed light on the elliptic lehmer problem . in the classical lehmer problem and its derivatives ( see @xcite ) there are many numerical examples . up to now , there is very little data for the elliptic lehmer problem outside the rational case . to illustrate our method",
    ", we give a couple of examples of small height points found with an easy search : see examples [ elp-3 ] and [ elp5 ] in section [ examples ] .",
    "our method uses _ elliptic divisibility sequences _ , which are sequences associated to the division points on the curves . at the conclusion of the paper",
    ", we will make the point that our methodology not only gives a simple way of handling elliptic curves over algebraic number fields ; it also throws up the possibility that small height points might be found more efficiently by searching for growth rates of elliptic divisibility sequences .",
    "the essential ingredient in the approach taken here is the sequence of _ elliptic division polynomials_. for background on see @xcite and @xcite .",

    "these elliptic divisibility sequences were studied in an abstract setting by morgan ward in a series of papers ",
    "see @xcite for the details .",
    "shipsey s thesis @xcite contains more recent applications of these sequences , which satisfy the same recursion formul  as the division polynomials . if @xmath9 is not a torsion point then the terms of the sequence @xmath41 are always non - zero .",
    "the single relation ( [ elldivseqrec ] ) gives rise to the two relations @xmath42",
    "@xmath43    for computational purposes , it is useful to notice that the two relations ( [ oddrelation ] ) and ( [ evenrelation ] ) can be subsumed into the single relation @xmath44 where @xmath45 denotes , as usual , the integer part .",
    "write @xmath46 for the discriminant of the curve @xmath2 .",
    "the valuations @xmath47 with @xmath48 are precisely the valuations corresponding to primes at which @xmath2 reduces to a singular curve .",

    "it might appear that a factorization of the discriminant is required but that is not so .",
    "later we discuss the practicalities of implementing the method .",
    "the method extends to rational points provided one knows the valuations at which the @xmath32-coordinate is not integral .",
    "the denominator can be cleared to obtain an integral point on a curve isomorphic to the starting curve , so the height is unchanged .",
    "the proof of theorem [ mainformula ] follows in the next section .",
    "it uses some detailed knowledge of local heights . for readers interested only in the application of the formula",
    ", the next section can be skipped .",
    "the global height is known to be expressible as a sum of local heights , one for each element of @xmath13 .",
    "there is a function , continuous away from infinity , @xmath55 which satisfies the _ local parallelogram law _",
    "@xmath56 let @xmath57/[k:{\\mathbb q}]$ ] denote the usual local normalizing constants , where @xmath47 lies above @xmath58 on @xmath59 .",
    "then @xmath60 the fundamental observation behind our method is the _",
    "elliptic jensen formula _ from @xcite .",
    "if @xmath61 is a compact group containing @xmath9 , with normalized haar measure @xmath62 , then @xmath63 by integrating and canceling three terms in ( [ paralawlocal ] ) .    if it is required that the expression @xmath64 be bounded as @xmath65 , then there is only one such map , the _ canonical local height_. it is important to note that in @xcite , local heights are normalized to make them invariant under isomorphisms .",
    "this involves adding a constant which depends on the discriminant of @xmath2 .",
    "the local heights in @xcite satisfy a different form of ( [ paralawlocal ] ) .",
    "there are explicit formul  for each of the local heights ( see @xcite and @xcite , or @xcite for an alternative approach ) . for non - archimedean valuations @xmath47 where @xmath9 has good reduction , @xmath66 notice in particular that if @xmath67 is integral at @xmath47 and @xmath9 has good reduction at @xmath47 then @xmath68 .",
    "the bad reduction case is more involved but we need to deal only with _ split multiplicative reduction _ ( see @xcite for details on this ) .",
    "this is because we may pass to an extension field where the reduction becomes of this type  the local height is functorial in the sense that it respects this passage . in the split multiplicative case ,",
    "the points on the curve are isomorphic to the points on the tate curve @xmath69 , where @xmath70 has @xmath71 .",
    "the explicit formul  for the @xmath32 and @xmath72 coordinates of a non - identity point are given in terms of the uniformizing parameter @xmath73 by @xmath74 it is clear that @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "suppose @xmath9 corresponds to the point @xmath73 and assume , by invariance under multiplication by @xmath77 , that @xmath78 lies in the fundamental domain @xmath79 .",
    "then ( by @xcite or @xcite ) , writing @xmath80 , @xmath81 notice that for @xmath82 , the local height is non - negative , while if @xmath83 the local height is negative .",
    "[ heightisthelimit ] let @xmath9 denote a non - torsion integral point .",
    "suppose @xmath84 or @xmath47 corresponds to a prime of singular reduction .",
    "in the latter case , assume equation ( [ geneq ] ) is in minimal form .",
    "then there are positive constants @xmath85 and @xmath86 such that @xmath87    if @xmath84 , we claim first that @xmath88 formula ( [ firststepininfinitecase ] ) was proved in the rational case in ( * ? ?",
    "* theorem 6.18 ) ; the proof is sketched here in the general case . the height is functorial in the sense that it respects field extensions .",
    "thus we may assume @xmath47 corresponds to an embedding of @xmath0 into @xmath89 .",
    "take @xmath90 in the elliptic jensen formula ( [ elljenformula ] ) .",
    "the points of @xmath36-torsion are dense and uniformly distributed in @xmath91 as @xmath92 , so the limit sum over the torsion points will tend to the integral when the integrand is continuous . note that the torsion points occur in pairs usually .",
    "working with @xmath37 they only occur with multiplicity 1 , hence the formula differs from the usual elliptic jensen formula in this respect .",
    "the only potential problem arises from torsion points close to @xmath9 : by @xcite , for @xmath93 with @xmath94 , @xmath95 for some @xmath96 which depends on @xmath2 and @xmath9 only .",
    "this inequality is enough to imply that the riemann sum given by the @xmath36-torsion points for @xmath97 converges , which gives ( [ firststepininfinitecase ] ) , and the explicit error term gives the estimate in ( [ localheightisthelimit ] ) .",
    "assume now that @xmath47 is non - archimedean , corresponding to a prime of singular reduction .",
    "let @xmath98 denote any complete , algebraically closed field containing @xmath16 .",
    "assume @xmath9 is integral , @xmath99 .",
    "now use the parametrisation of the curve described before .",
    "the points of order dividing @xmath36 on the tate curve are precisely those of the form @xmath100 , @xmath101 , where @xmath102 denotes a fixed , primitive @xmath36th root of unity in @xmath98 .",
    "we claim that @xmath103 let @xmath61 denote the closure of the torsion points : @xmath61 is not compact , so the @xmath47-adic elliptic jensen formula can not be used .",
    "instead we use a variant of the shnirelman integral : for @xmath104 define the elliptic shnirelman integral to be @xmath105 whenever the limit exists .",
    "we claim firstly that for any @xmath106 , the shnirelman integral @xmath107 first assume that @xmath108 is the identity .",
    "using the explicit formula for the local height gives @xmath109 the first sum is bounded by @xmath110 , which vanishes in the limit ; the second sum converges to @xmath111 .",
    "for the general case , let @xmath108 correspond to the point @xmath78 on the multiplicative tate curve .",
    "if for some large @xmath36 no @xmath112 has @xmath113 then the analogous sum to ( [ playasongforme ] ) is close to @xmath111 by the same argument .",
    "assume therefore that there is a @xmath112 with this property .",
    "then the first sum in ( [ playasongforme ] ) is replaced by @xmath114 where @xmath115 only depends on @xmath78 . by @xmath47-adic elliptic transcendence theory ( see @xcite ) , there is a lower bound for @xmath116 of the form @xmath117 , where @xmath85 depends on @xmath2 and @xmath118 only .",
    "it follows that the first sum vanishes in the limit as before .",
    "the second sum in ( [ playasongforme ] ) is simply rearranged under rotation by @xmath78 , so converges to @xmath111 as before .",
    "this proves ( [ imgoingto ] ) .",
    "the claimed limit ( [ andthereisnoplace ] ) now follows by taking the elliptic shnirelman integral of both sides of the parallelogram law ( [ paralawlocal ] ) and noting that we count torsion points in pairs . equation ( [ imgoingto ] ) shows that three terms cancel to leave the required limit .",
    "the error term in ( [ localheightisthelimit ] ) comes from the lower bound used above .",
    "these estimates are enough to prove the main formula .",
    "( of theorem [ mainformula ] ) it will be convenient to use normalized heights , so define @xmath119 then @xmath120 is invariant under isomorphism ( see @xcite ) . by the product formula , @xmath121",
    "also , by theorem [ heightisthelimit ] , @xmath122 for any @xmath123 , @xmath124 therefore , using the product formula again , @xmath125 the reason for introducing the factor @xmath126 is to take account of the possibility that the equation ( [ geneq ] ) is not in minimal form at some non - archimedean @xmath47 corresponding to a prime of singular reduction .",
    "the change of coordinates to put the equation into minimal form is an isomorphism , so it leaves the local height @xmath127 invariant .",
    "now theorem [ mainformula ] follows directly from theorem [ heightisthelimit ] .",
    "it appears as though we need to factorize @xmath49 in order to apply theorem [ mainformula ]",
    ". however , theorem [ heightisthelimit ] says that for a prime @xmath128 , @xmath129 is approximately @xmath130 where @xmath131 is the total contribution to the height from the valuations which extend @xmath132 .",
    "therefore , asymptotically , it suffices to compute the gcd of @xmath133 with a suitably high power of @xmath51 .",
    "since the local height is @xmath134 for some @xmath135 , the power of @xmath51 can be @xmath34 .",
    "this is likely to be a huge number and there are ways to avoid making this computation . in practice ,",
    "it is often sufficient to find the gcd of @xmath133 and @xmath136 .",
    "in other words : @xmath137 in the last section of the paper , we will discuss other ways to speed up the calculations .",
    "the following examples were calculated using pari - gp , see @xcite , simply applying the basic formula ( [ bogstandard ] ) . in the main",
    "we have only exhibited calculations which were executed within a few seconds at most .",
    "we begin by applying our method to examples in the literature  the first two examples come from @xcite .",

    "the calculation speeds up if we notice that @xmath2 is isomorphic to the curve @xmath157 with @xmath9 mapping to @xmath158 under the isomorphism .",
    "taking @xmath154 gives @xmath159 which is more accurate , and quicker , due to the slower growth rate of the sequence @xmath133 .",
    "the next examples are manufactured to highlight one of the strengths of our approach : it always gives an answer even if a tricky factorization appears to be necessary .",
    "silverman s approach in @xcite computes all the local heights then sums these to give the global height . to compute a local non - archimedean height , the curve needs to be in minimal form for that valuation .",
    "if the factorization of @xmath160 is known then the curve can easily be rendered in minimal form for each valuation corresponding to the prime factors of @xmath160 .",
    "even if the factorization is not known , it is usually possible to proceed . with our earlier notation ,",

    ", a global minimal equation will not always exist .",
    "presumably the same kind of argument would work nonetheless .",

    "we also used a floating point for the archimedean contribution : with @xmath178 we obtained @xmath179 .",
    "the pari - gp routine for computing heights returned a warning that the calculation would take several hours .",

    "secondly , these examples hint at an interesting possibility concerning the search for small height points . perhaps restricting to elliptic divisibility sequences represents an efficiency gain in the sense that small height points will arise from sequences whose first few terms are arithmetically simple .",
