    "this catastrophic release of magnetic energy causes emission from the radio to the x - ray @xcite . on m dwarfs ,",
    "the most distinct observational characteristic is the tremendous increase in the blue and near - ultraviolet continuum emission , up to several magnitudes in a few minutes or less @xcite .",
    "the initial burst , or impulsive phase , is also characterized in the optical spectrum by increases in chromospheric line emission , particularly in the hydrogen balmer lines @xcite . the impulsive phase is followed by a gradual decay phase which can last from tens of minutes to hours for the largest flares @xcite .",
    "the rate at which flares occur is of significant current interest .",
    "recently , numerous planets have been discovered around m dwarfs , including some of only a few earth masses @xcite .",
    "the atmospheres of these planets may be greatly affected by the amount of high - energy radiation incident upon them .",
    "cool , red m dwarfs produce little high - energy radiation during quiescence , so the flaring rate is an important factor in determining planet habitability @xcite .    additionally , characterizing the m dwarf flaring",
    "rate is important for new instruments such as pan - starrs @xcite , the palomar transit factory @xcite and the large synoptic survey telescope @xcite , which will carry out large , all - sky surveys in the time - domain . effectively selecting rare , exotic transients from the large sample of m dwarf",
    "flares that will be observed in these surveys requires reliable knowledge of expected flare characteristics and rates .",
    "traditionally , the frequency of flares on m dwarfs has been determined through time - resolved photometric monitoring of individual stars . @xcite and",
    "@xcite have amassed several hundred hours of optical observations on dozens of the most magnetically active and well - known flare stars and have derived power law relationships between the total energy in the _ u _ band and the frequency of a flare , with less energetic flares occurring more frequently .",
    "studies on individual stars have confirmed the power law form of the frequency distribution , albeit with a range of exponents @xcite . at ultraviolet wavelengths",
    ", @xcite and @xcite found that the euve flare frequency distributions for active stars also had a power law form .",
    "in addition , @xcite demonstrated that large flares occur preferentially on the x - ray brightest stars .",
    "spectroscopic studies of flares have also investigated the flare rate , but with smaller samples and incomplete information on flare energies it is not possible to compute the flare frequency distribution as described above for photometric data . instead the results are usually presented as `` flare duty cycles '' , meaning that during the entire period of observation , flares occur during a certain percentage of the time .",
    "alternatively a `` flare rate '' ( number of flares per hour ) is sometimes given , but without reference to the energy distribution of the flares .",
    "both the flare duty cycle and flare rate are strong functions of the observational sample , since such factors as the individual exposure time ( compared to the typical flare timescale ) , the flare visibility in the line radiation compared to the continuum , and the flare energy will all be important in determining whether a particular observation is counted as flaring .",
    "@xcite estimated a duty cycle of 7% from h@xmath1 observations of the m9.5 dwarf bri 0021 - 0214 , while @xcite observed 14 small flares on ad leonis , none of which produced measurable continuum increase , and determined a flare rate of @xmath3 .",
    "@xcite investigated a sample of 81 m dwarfs , each observed a few times and found a flare duty cycle of @xmath05% , based on h@xmath1 variability .",
    "recently , @xcite reported a duty cycle of @xmath4 5% for h@xmath1 flares",
    "( defined as a brightness increase of a factor of ten ) from time - resolved spectroscopic monitoring ( @xmath01 hour each ) of 43 m dwarfs .",
    "the small numbers of stars in most previous studies ( both photometric and spectroscopic ) did not allow examination of whether the flare rate is a function of stellar or galactic parameters .",
    "however , @xcite used the repeat observations from the sdss stripe 82 photometry ( @xmath060 epochs per object spread over 10 years ) to identify flares and determine flare rates .",
    "they identified 271 flares on more than 50,000 m dwarfs , a sample which is orders of magnitude larger than previous work and the first to contain significant numbers of both magnetically active and inactive stars .",
    "the vast majority of flares ( but not all ) in the @xcite study occurred on active stars , and they found that the flare star spatial distributions reflect the active star distributions as a function of spectral subtype @xcite .    it should be clear that the flare rates , flare duty cycles , and flare frequency distributions described above are distinctly different measurements , and are difficult to compare .",
    "in addition , the criteria used to define a flare differ depending upon the method of observation ( photometry vs spectroscopy ) , the exposure time during which a flare may occur ( resolved vs unresolved ) , the wavelength ( optical vs near - ultraviolet ) , and the emission mechanism ( continuum vs lines ) . the sample selection ( spectral type distribution , galactic height distribution , color selection , etc . ) also has a strong influence on the number of flares found .",
    "additionally , flares themselves are not homogeneous .",
    "flares with the same energy exhibit apparent magnitude variations that depend on the brightness of the star during quiescence ( the so - called `` contrast '' effect ) . on stars with the same quiescent brightness , flares of the same energy exhibit a wide range of light curve shapes , with some flares rising and decaying quickly , giving large changes in apparent magnitude , while others are slower , with smaller peak magnitude .",
    "understanding how often an m dwarf is seen in a flaring state requires knowledge of many stellar , flare , and sample properties .",
    "spectroscopic flare data typically have longer exposure times , may contain unresolved flares , are usually at optical wavelengths , and are more likely to observe flares , especially small ones , through enhanced line emission .",
    "flare rates and frequency distributions are therefore not good descriptions of the data , and we will use the flare duty cycle ( the fraction of epochs classified as flares ) in this work .    here",
    "we present the first large , statistical study of spectroscopic flare duty cycles . the low mass stars in this study are taken from the sloan digital sky survey data release 5 low - mass star spectroscopic sample @xcite , which consists of over 38,000 objects between spectral types m0 and l0 .",
    "all sdss spectra are the result of coadding several ( usually 3 - 5 ) individual exposures , typically ( but not always ) observed on the same night .",
    "the individual component exposure times were generally between 9 and 25 minutes .",
    "the individual spectra were made public as part of the sdss data release 6 @xcite .",
    "the repeated , shorter exposures are used to aid in cosmic ray rejection for the final combined sdss spectrum .",
    "however , these repeat spectra can be used to examine the time variability of spectral features .",
    "we take advantage of the time sampling contained in the individual exposures to identify flares based on the strength and variability of spectral lines .",
    "we have created a unique tool we use to identify flares : the flare line index ( fli ) , which allows us to quantitatively measure spectral line strength in low signal - to - noise ( snr ) spectra , where equivalent width measurements are not possible .",
    "we then used false discovery rate analysis @xcite to identify flares based on exceptionally strong emission line strength .",
    "additionally , we used fli variability criteria to identify flares based on changes in emission line strength over the course of the exposures .    in  [ sec : sample ] we further characterize our sample and describe our quality cuts .",
    "the tools for our analysis are described in detail in ",
    "[ sec : flare_tools ] .",
    "the flare selection criteria are defined in  [ sec : def_flare ] , and the results are presented in  [ sec : results ] .",
    "finally , we conclude in  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "we began with the sdss dr5 low - mass star sample of @xcite , for which low mass stellar candidates were chosen from the sdss dr5 spectroscopic catalog using the photometric color selection @xmath5 and @xmath6 , along with a standard set of sdss processing flags ( saturated , bright , nodeblend , interp_center , bad_counts_error , peakcenter , notchecked , and noprofile were all required to be zero ) .",
    "stars with @xmath7-band extinction @xmath8 0.5 , colors consistent with having a white dwarf companion @xcite , or measured radial velocity @xmath8 500 km s@xmath9 were culled from the sample ( see @xcite for more details ) .",
    "the 38,717 spectra of individual objects in the dr5 sample that meet the above criteria consist of 142,032 individual exposures that were made available in dr6 .",
    "the distribution of number of exposures per object and the exposure times are shown in figure [ fig : exp_time_hist ] .",
    "although most of the spectra for an object were observed consecutively on a single night , 27% of objects have additional exposures separated by two hours or more .",
    "the sdss spectra have wavelength coverage from 3800 to 9200  , and resolution ranging from 1800 to 2200 .",
    "we therefore were able to measure five hydrogen balmer lines ( h8 , h@xmath10,h@xmath11 , h@xmath2 , h@xmath1 ) , as well as ca ii k. ca ii h and h@xmath12 are blended at this resolution and are not considered in our analysis .",
    "the wavelength regions used for the continuum and line regions are given in table 1 ( cf .",

    "we visually inspected many of the flagged pixels and found that the pipeline routines frequently misidentified stellar emission lines as crs .",
    "since flares produce strong and time variable emission that might be misclassified as crs , we developed a separate criterion to identify pixels as crs in the line regions , so as not to reject genuine emission : a pixel within the line region was called a cr if the difference between that pixel and the continuum level was more than ten times the standard deviation of the other pixels in the region .",
    "our criterion identified crs in the h@xmath1 and h@xmath2 line regions in 0.55% and 0.69% of spectra respectively , as compared to 2.7% and 3.5% of the spectra that the sdss pipeline flags identified .",
    "there were no significant variations in the rate of crs detected at different spectral subtypes using either definition .",
    "although this criterion still allows some crs to remain undetected and masquerade as emission lines , we require emission in both h@xmath1 and h@xmath2 to identify an object as in a flaring state ( see  [ sec : def_flare ] ) .",
    "this requirement greatly reduces the contamination by crs , since two independent cr strikes on h lines in the same spectrum happen very rarely . using the sdss cr flags , we found that a `` cr '' is detected in both the h@xmath1 and h@xmath2 regions in 0.3% of the spectra , compared to 0.007% with our cr criterion .",
    "all of the objects that met our flare criteria were inspected by eye , ensuring that no crs led to an incorrect flare classification .",
    "since the continuum regions are much wider than the line regions and are only used as an indicator of the continuum level and signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) , we used the more conservative sdss cr flags to mask any suspect pixels in all calculations involving the continuum regions .",
    "the large sample size allowed us to divide our objects into 3 quality bins based on the snr . because m dwarfs are red and often have low snr in the blue portions of their spectra , our division into three bins identified those spectra that could be analyzed in both the h@xmath1 and h@xmath2 regions .",
    "these divisions were also important for our false discovery rate analysis ( see  [ sec : fdr ] ) .",
    "we made our cuts based on the continuum level in regions near the lines of interest because accurate emission line measurements depend on our ability to define the local continuum .",
    "the high signal - to - noise ( hsn ) sample includes objects where all component spectra have median continuum levels at least three times the standard deviation of the points in the continuum regions for both h@xmath1 and h@xmath2 .",
    "there are 43,788 spectra in the hsn sample , from 12,459 individual stars . because earlier - type stars are both bluer and brighter , the hsn objects are almost entirely spectral types m0 - 4 . the spectral type distribution of hsn spectra is shown in figure [ fig : spt_by_s2n ] .",
    "our medium signal - to - noise ( msn ) sample is defined in a similar way to the hsn sample , except that we only require the median h@xmath1 continuum level to be at least 3 times the standard deviation of the points in the region .",
    "the msn spectra have very noisy continuum flux near h@xmath2 . however , many of these objects exhibited h@xmath2 line emission that can be used in our flare analysis .",
    "like the hsn sample , all of the spectra for each object were required to meet the msn criteria in order to be included in the msn sample .",
    "there are 68,203 spectra from 18,512 individual stars in the msn sample .",
    "the spectral type distribution of the msn spectra is also shown in figure [ fig : spt_by_s2n ] .    for completeness",
    ", we note that for @xmath020% of the stars in the original sample , the individual component spectra have low snr that did not meet the msn cut .",
    "this lsn sample may well contain flares but can not be used in the detailed analysis presented here .",
    "the spectral type of each star was determined by @xcite from the co - added dr5 spectra using the hammer spectral typing facility @xcite .",
    "the hammer uses measurements of molecular bands and line strengths to estimate a spectral type and is accurate to within one subtype .",
    "we adopted the @xcite types for our analysis of the individual component spectra , which have lower snr than the co - added spectra .    the hammer is tuned to identify and classify m dwarfs during quiescence by fitting templates to molecular band depths and overall spectral shape .",
    "large flares produce optical continuum emission that veils the molecular features and makes the spectral shape significantly bluer .",
    "therefore , we verified that the sample does not exclude continuum flares that cause the star to be misidentified by the hammer .",
    "we spectral typed the dm4.5e flare star yz cmi during quiescence and during a giant flare of @xmath13u @xmath0 -6 @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "the quiescent spectral type returned by the hammer was m4 , while during some stages of the flare , types of m2 and m3 were found , still reasonably close to the quiet value . to further establish that the spectral type determination was not biased against flares",
    ", we also searched for flares in all spectroscopic objects whose photometric colors ( taken at a different time than the spectroscopy ) were consistent with m dwarfs @xcite , but were not identified as m dwarfs by the hammer . there were no large , continuum - enhancement flares identified among these objects .",
    "these two tests confirm that we did not select against continuum flares by relying on automatic spectral typing .",
    "the unique sdss data set provides an opportunity to observe the spectroscopic time evolution of a large number of flares .",
    "it does , however , present some challenges .",
    "first , the total length of consecutive observations is generally short ( @xmath045 minutes ) , and if a flare does occur , it may start before or at any time during the individual observations .",
    "second , the time resolution is coarse : the duration of small flares is often less than the exposure time of one observation . both of these factors make determining the time of the flare beginning , peak , or end ambiguous .",
    "additionally , only the largest flares , which are rare , will be evident throughout an entire sequence of spectra . in the case of large flares that last for several hours , the observations may only cover a small fraction of the entire flare light curve .",
    "finally , flares are more likely to be observed during the longer gradual phase , when the continuum enhancement is likely to be significantly diminished . on the other hand , the emission lines will remain enhanced throughout the flare .",
    "given these challenges , we chose to concentrate on identifying flares based on strong and/or variable chromospheric line emission .",
    "h@xmath1 has been studied extensively in low mass stars , and is well known to vary on short timescales @xcite , even outside of flares .",
    "thus , if h@xmath1 is solely used to identify flares , there is no way of distinguishing variability from flaring ( except for the largest h@xmath1 flares ) , given the small number of exposures and the relatively long exposure times in our sample .",
    "although h@xmath2 variability has not been as well - studied on m dwarfs , any flare large enough to be seen in a 15-minute exposure should also show an increase in h@xmath2 emission , as evidenced by studies of individual flares , e.g. @xcite .",
    "therefore we required both the h@xmath1 and h@xmath2 lines to meet our flare criteria for line strength and/or variability ( see  [ sec : def_flare ] for details of the flare criteria ) .",
    "this requirement has the additional benefit of ensuring that cosmic rays are not falsely classified as flares .",
    "a commonly used measurement of emission line strength is the equivalent width ( ew ) .",
    "however , ew measurements are problematic when the continuum flux near the line is weak and has low snr .",
    "figure [ fig : false_ew ] shows the h@xmath1 and h@xmath2 line regions during a sequence of exposures of an m5 dwarf from our msn sample .",
    "the h@xmath2 continuum flux is very close to zero , so division by the continuum to obtain ews gives values of -3 , 106 , and 19 for the three consecutive exposures . while the star in figure [ fig : false_ew ] is clearly not in a flaring state , the ew measurements for h@xmath2 are large and variable , as they might be during a flare .",
    "this issue could be avoided by limiting the sample to objects with high snr in the h@xmath2 continuum ( i.e. , the hsn sample ) . however , including the msn sample greatly increases our sample size .",
    "we therefore developed a new method for measuring line strength that is independent of the continuum strength .",
    "we define the flare line index ( fli ) as : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the mean value of the flux in the line region ( for a specific emission line ) minus the continuum flux ( associated with the emission line ; see table 1 ) and @xmath17 is the standard deviation of the continuum .",
    "the fli measures the line strength in terms of its significance compared to the noise .",
    "the fli allows us to determine whether a line measurement is statistically significant even when the continuum is weak and/or uncertain . for the star in figure",
    "[ fig : false_ew ] , the fli values for h@xmath2 are -0.3 , 1.1 , and 0.2 , respectively . the differences in these values can be attributed to the noise in the spectra .",
    "the fli values are neither as large nor as variable as the ew measurements of the same data .",
    "when the continuum is well - measured , as in the h@xmath1 line , the fli values and ew measurements are similar .",
    "the fli does depend on the snr of the spectra ; stars with higher snr have larger fli values for the same emission line flux .",
    "fli values for both h@xmath1 and h@xmath2 were computed for all spectra in the hsn and msn samples and used in the subsequent analysis .",
    "determining if an object is in a flaring state from a single spectrum is difficult because active stars have a range of nominal , non - flaring levels of h@xmath1 activity . also , there may be little difference between the emission line strengths of an active star in quiescence and those of a flaring star during a small flare or in the gradual phase of a large flare .",
    "we searched for flares based on the strength of the line emission , and on the variability in repeated spectral observations .",
    "we did not require that both criteria be met , since small flares may not have particularly strong lines , while large flares may not show much variability over the timescale of the sdss observations .",
    "we used false discovery rate ( fdr ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) analysis to search for spectra with particularly strong emission lines that were outliers from the typical stellar distribution of fli values .",
    "our sample exhibits a continuous distribution of measured fli values for both h@xmath1 and h@xmath2 , ranging from lines in absorption through emission and into the flare regime .",
    "fdr analysis is a quantitative method for determining a threshold value of a test statistic that separates real sources from a background ( null ) distribution for a given false - discovery rate . in our case",
    ", we sought to determine the fli value above which stars were considered to be in a flaring state .",
    "the analysis uses an adaptive technique that establishes the threshold value based on the desired false positive rate , defined by the parameter @xmath1 .",
    "our fdr method replaces an arbitrarily chosen confidence level ( such as 3@xmath17 ) with a known false positive rate and can select the outliers from our sample ( as compared to the null ) as flares while controlling the rate of false detections through the choice of @xmath1 . for our analysis , we limited the false positive rate to @xmath18 .",
    "the key to using fdr analysis is to assemble a meaningful null distribution . in the case of identifying flares",
    ", the null distribution should be a set of spectra that have similar properties to our candidate flare sample , but contain no flares .",
    "active m dwarf spectra ( that are not flaring ) will provide a good null sample for the flare analysis .",
    "the fraction of stars that are magnetically active increases from a few percent at spectral type m0 to nearly 100% at type m9 @xcite . rather than simply adopting the active sample found by @xcite , we tested the effectiveness of the fli values and fdr analysis tools on our hsn and msn samples by verifying that we could reproduce the @xcite results .",
    "again , we require a null distribution to separate the active stars from the inactive ones . for this case",
    ", we adopted the dr5 composite spectra of inactive stars found by @xcite as the null distribution .",
    "we used the individual component spectra in the hsn and msn samples as the test distribution .",
    "we carried out the analysis separately for each spectral type , although we found that the hsn sample only had sufficient numbers for the m0 - 3 types and the msn sample for the m0 - 7 types ( see figure [ fig : spt_by_s2n ] ) .",
    "an example of the fdr analysis for m3 stars is shown in figure [ fig : fdr_example ] .",
    "the gray line represents the distribution of fli values for the h@xmath1 emission of the m3 dwarfs in the hsn sample ( the test sample , which includes both active and inactive stars ) , while the black line represents the fli distribution of the inactive m3 dwarfs from the dr5 composite spectra ( the null sample , which contains only inactive stars ) .",
    "the distributions have been normalized to have the same peak value centered at fli=0 .",
    "the vertical line ( at a fli of 0.66 ) is the threshold value determined by the fdr analysis that divides active stars from inactive ones , with the false positive rate @xmath1 set to 10% .",
    "the fli emission threshold values we determined for the m0 - 3 spectral types in the hsn sample are shown in figure [ fig : fli_cutoffs ] ( labeled `` emission '' ) .",
    "note that for later types , the m3 value was adopted .",
    "table 2 gives the h@xmath1 fli emission threshold values for both the hsn and msn samples .",
    "using our fli / fdr determination of activity , we found that 2.8% of the m0s are active and this fraction rises to 84% of m7 - 9 stars .",
    "these compare well to the active fractions reported by @xcite , who found 2.6% and 90% , respectively .",
    "although this agreement might be expected because we used the dr5 inactive spectra as our null distribution , we used a different test statistic ( fli instead of ew ) and found our active sample using fdr analysis instead of defining an ew activity threshold of 1 on statistically significant emission lines in high snr spectra ( see * ? ? ? * for more details ) .",
    "the fact that we successfully recovered the same active stars gives us confidence that fli values are a useful measure in cases where the ew is ill - defined , and that the fdr method can be used to distinguish between the distributions .",

    "we used two separate methods to define whether or not an object in our sample contained a flare .",
    "the first was to use fdr analysis to determine which spectra had emission in both h@xmath1 and h@xmath2 that was strong enough to be considered a flare .",
    "the other method was to find objects whose h@xmath1 and h@xmath2 lines were both in emission and showed large variations together with time .",
    "these two methods are not mutually exclusive ; flares that have strong emission lines that vary over the course of several exposures will meet both criteria .",
    "we used the dr5 composite spectra of the active stars ( i.e. those that met the emission threshold criteria determined from  [ sec : emission_sample ] ) as the null distribution for the flare fdr analysis .    although the objects that make up the null distribution ( the composite spectra ) are the same objects that make up the test distribution ( the individual exposures ) , the distributions are distinct in two significant ways .",
    "first , the signature of small flares that are only present in a subset of the exposures is diluted in the composite spectra .",
    "second , outliers were removed from the null distribution by rejecting spectra that were not part of the continuous distribution of fli values .",
    "a few small or diluted flares may still be present in the null distribution .",
    "however , any flares in the null will simply increase the threshold value determined in the analysis and decrease the number of objects classified as flares .",
    "as in the active sample determination described in  [ sec : emission_sample ] , we first normalized the null and test distributions , and then applied the fdr analysis separately to the hsn and msn samples , for each m subtype .",
    "again we found that the hsn sample analysis was limited to m0 - 3 types and the msn sample to m0 - 7 types .",
    "the flare threshold values for both h@xmath1 and h@xmath2 are given in table 2 , and are shown for the hsn sample in figure [ fig : fli_cutoffs ] . to be classified as a flare , we required that an individual spectrum had fli values for both h@xmath1 and h@xmath2 above the respective fdr flare threshold values .",
    "thus , many of the spectra above the flare line in figure [ fig : fli_cutoffs ] were not found to be flares because they did not make the h@xmath2 cut .",
    "this effectively removed cases of h@xmath1 activity that were not strong enough to be classified as flares .",
    "we also identified flares by looking for variation in emission line strength among individual exposures of the same object .",
    "h@xmath1 emission is known to vary outside of flaring ( see discussion in  [ sec : flare_tools ] ) ; @xcite and @xcite found that `` quiescent '' h@xmath1 emission often varies by as much as 30% on short timescales ( minutes - hours ) .",
    "this may well be due to low - level flaring , but it is not possible to classify unequivocally as flare emission due to the relatively poor time resolution of their data ( and ours ) .",
    "we therefore concentrated on variability that exceeds this level ( representing larger , definite flares ) , and developed the following flare criteria based on both the h@xmath1 and h@xmath2 fli values :    1 .",
    "mean fli values @xmath8 3 over all exposures for an object for both h@xmath1 and h@xmath2 ; in these strong emission line spectra , we identified flares if both the h@xmath1 and h@xmath2 fli values for an object differed by more than 30% between the minimum and maximum values measured over the course of the exposures . 2 .",
    "mean fli values @xmath19 3 in both h@xmath1 and h@xmath2 ; we identified flares in these weak emission line data using the criterion that max fli - min fli @xmath8 3 .",
    "we adopted an absolute change criterion because a 30% change is still within the noise when the mean fli value is small .",
    "since fli is defined as @xmath20 , this is essentially a 3@xmath17 requirement ( max fli is 3@xmath17 larger than min fli ) .",
    "3 .   mean fli values @xmath8 3 in h@xmath1 but @xmath19 3 in h@xmath2 ; these objects have moderate emission strength in h@xmath1 but weak emission in h@xmath2 .",

    "flares with quiescent spectrum , as well as rise , decay , and peak phase flares are noted in the final column of table 3 .",
    "the time evolution of the flares we have identified is consistent with the known characteristics of flares .",
    "previous observations using time resolved spectroscopic monitoring have shown that the higher order balmer lines show larger increases in flux during flares than the lower order lines .",
    "this results in the observed balmer decrement ( ratio of individual lines to a fiducial , often h@xmath2 as we adopt here ) becoming flatter , since h@xmath11 and the higher order lines strengthen relative to h@xmath2 ( * ? ? ?",

    "2007 ) this behavior can be explained by a model where flare heating increases the local electron density at chromospheric temperatures .",
    "the higher order balmer lines are less optically thick than the lower order lines , so the increase in electron density causes a relatively larger increase in their emission .",
    "the h@xmath1 line behavior relative to the other lines has previously been more difficult to measure during flares , since observations typically concentrated on the blue part of the spectrum ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "along with their blue spectra , @xcite obtained data with a different instrument at lower time resolution showing that the h@xmath1 line , being already very optically thick , does not respond strongly during a large flare in accord with models @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : balmer_dec ] illustrates the line flux normalized to the bolometric luminosity for several lines ( top ) , as well as balmer decrements for four flares ( bottom ; two rise- and two decay - phase ) .",
    "the balmer lines increase during the rise phase flares , and decrease during the decay phase flares , as expected . in the bottom panels",
    ", we see that for all of the balmer lines except h@xmath1 , the decrements are flat throughout the flares .",
    "as expected , the h@xmath1 decrement decreases during the rise - phase , when h@xmath2 is becoming relatively stronger , and increases during the decay - phase , as the atmosphere gradually returns to its quiescent temperature and density structure .",
    "our observations are in accord with expectations , and actually represent truly simultaneous measurements with the same instrument of the entire balmer decrement ( including h@xmath1 ) during stellar flares .",
    "the ca ii k line responds less strongly , and rises and decays more slowly during flares , than the balmer lines @xcite , as is also evident from our observations .",
    "large flares cause strong blue continuum flux enhancement , with less dramatic effects at redder wavelengths .",
    "only very strong flares caught in the impulsive phase would lead to a significant flux enhancement for the wavelength range and relatively long exposure times ( which dilute the short - lived continuum burst ) of the sdss spectra .",
    "we expected to find only a small number of such flares , since large flares are rare and we are only sensitive to measuring continuum enhancement on hsn stars or very bright msn stars , where we have a good measure of the quiescent continuum .",
    "our sample contained two continuum flares , an example of which is shown in figure [ fig : flare_flux_523 ] .",
    "both flares occurred during the third and final exposure of a series , and both show very strong emission lines .",
    "these are evidently large flares that were caught during the impulsive phase .",
    "we measured the flare - only spectrum by subtracting the quiescent ( first ) exposure obtained for each star from the flare exposure .",
    "we found that the continuum flux represented 88% and 90% of the total flare radiation , respectively , with the remainder of the energy coming from the line radiation .",
    "@xcite found that the continuum emitted 96% of the flare flux during the impulsive phase of their very large flare , and averaged 91% over the course of the flare .",
    "this suggests that our flare exposures may have included the impulsive phase and part of the decay phase of each flare .",

    "later are based on a small number of stars , and although there are many thousands of objects in the m0-m3 bins , there are very few flares . in order to improve the statistics , we binned by spectral type and found the duty cycles to be @xmath21 of m0 - 1 stars ; @xmath22 for m2 - 3 stars ; @xmath23 for m4 - 6 stars ; and @xmath24 of m7 - 9 stars .",
    "@xcite investigated flares in a large sdss photometric sample .",
    "they required near simultaneous photometric enhancements in both the @xmath25 and @xmath26 filters , and employed a threshold of @xmath27 0.7 to define a flare .",
    "figure [ fig : ejh_afk_rates ] compares their flare duty cycle with our results for the binned data .",
    "we find a higher duty cycle , by a factor of @xmath0 4.5 , but the duty cycle as a function of spectral type has a similar trend in both studies .",
    "it is not surprising that the duty cycles are different , since the two studies use such different observations and threshold criteria .",
    "however , we can qualitatively estimate the effect of observing line versus continuum enhancements , and the effect of exposure time .",
    "the line emission remains enhanced for much longer than the continuum emission leading to a higher probability of observing flares in line emission .",
    "longer exposure times increase the chance of a flare occurring during the exposure . both of these factors lead to the observed higher duty cycle seen in our spectroscopic observations .",
    "nearly all flares occur on magnetically active stars , as defined by h@xmath1 in emission @xcite . as discussed in section [ sec : emission_sample ] , the active fraction increases with spectral subtype .",
    "in addition , @xcite found that the active fraction decreases with vertical height from the galactic plane ( denoted by @xmath28z@xmath28 ) for all spectral types , which they attribute to an age effect , where older stars are less likely to be active .",
    "the age at which activity disappears changes with spectral type however , with later type m dwarfs remaining active for a longer time .",
    "we limited our analysis of the vertical distribution of the flaring stars to just the m4 - 6 dwarfs , which show a large number of flares , and have a similar flaring fraction ( see figure [ fig : flares_spt ] ) .",
    "earlier type stars have very few flares , and later type stars are too faint to be observed at large distances .",
    "figure [ fig : zdist ] ( top panel ) shows the distribution of active m4 - 6 dwarfs and the fraction that showed flares as a function of vertical distance from the galactic plane .",
    "we repeated our analysis , adjusting both the bin size and bin positions and verified that the increase in flare fraction as a function of @xmath28z@xmath28 is a real effect and not an artifact of the binning process .",
    "the bottom panel of figure [ fig : zdist ] shows the cumulative distributions of the flare stars ( black line ) , the active stars ( dotted gray line ) and the inactive stars ( dashed line ) . although there are thousands of objects beyond @xmath28z@xmath28=200 pc , none of them showed flares .",
    "@xcite and @xcite also found that all of the flares on m4 dwarfs occur within 200pc of the plane .",
    "our results indicate that flares occur on stars that are preferentially closer to the plane than the inactive stars , and closer even than the active population .",
    "if we interpret this in terms of an age effect , it suggests that flare stars ( which are a subset of the active population ) are younger than the magnetically active stars as a whole .",
    "evidently the frequency of flaring decreases as a star ages , although it still may exhibit quiescent chromospheric emission and therefore be counted as active .",
    "we have presented the first study to systematically search for flares in a sample of tens of thousands of time - resolved spectroscopic observations from the sdss data release 6 .",
    "we developed two new techniques for identifying and analyzing flares in relatively low snr spectra : the flare line index ( fli ) measurement and the application of the false discovery rate to flare spectra .",
    "fli values provide a measure of emission line strength even when the continuum level is not well - measured .",
    "the fdr analysis distinguishes between the overlapping distributions in line strength of strong quiescent emission and genuine flares , providing a threshold fli value for being considered a flare , while controlling the rate of false - positives . using our measured fli values for the h@xmath1 and h@xmath2 lines",
    ", we applied the fdr analysis and a set of variability criteria to find flares .",
    "we identified flares on 63 stars from the 30,971 total stars comprising both the hsn and msn samples .",
    "the flares include examples of rise and decay phases , as well as some sequences of exposures that appear to trace the flare through its entire evolution .",
    "the balmer decrements are consistent with results from time resolved spectroscopic monitoring of individual flares and expectations of models .",
    "we also found two flares that show continuum flux enhancements , which occur during the initial impulsive phase of large flares . because the properties of the flares in our sample are consistent with previous findings , we are confident that our techniques , which we developed specifically to work with coarsely time - resolved spectroscopic observations , successfully identified flares .",
    "we found that the flare duty cycle increases monotonically as a function of m dwarf spectral subtype , from @xmath21 of m0 - 1 stars to @xmath24 of m7 - 9 stars .",
    "the flare distribution as a function of spectral subtype is similar to the distribution of active stars , providing further evidence that most flares occur on active stars .",
    "nearly all of the flares in the sample occur on stars near the galactic plane , a result that is consistent with other studies ( i.e. * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , we have shown that flares occur preferentially on stars closer to the plane than the mean active population , indicating that flare frequency likely decreases with age .",
    "this study represents an important step toward understanding the intrinsic flare frequency distribution as a function of stellar active lifetimes .",
    "surveys that do nt have high time resolution and continuous coverage ( from which the total flare energy can be computed ) require detailed and nuanced monte carlo simulations in order to constrain the physical flare frequency distribution .",
