    "the solar magnetic activity , which is manifested by the emergence of sunspots and active regions and the consequent energy release by flares , undergoes variations over many different time scales .",
    "the main periodicity in number of sunspots occurs on a time scale of 11 years , which is called the solar cycle or schwabe cycle @xcite .",
    "the other time scales that occur , can be divided into longer and shorter time scales .",
    "the longer time scales are of the order of hundreds and even thousands of years @xcite , while the shorter time scales that occur are of the order of months ( 155 - 160 days ) known as the rieger periodicity @xcite .",
    "another variation of the solar activity occurs over @xmath0 2 years , which is known as the quasi - biennial oscillation @xcite .",
    "the short - period variation may appear as a clue to understand the basics of solar activity @xcite .",
    "therefore , these variations need to be studied in detail . in the remaining part of the present paper , we focus on the rieger - type periodicity .",
    "the periodicity of 154 days was first found by @xcite in the @xmath1-ray flares observed by the solar maximum mission ( smm ) near the maximum of solar cycle 21 .",
    "the analysis of different data sets during the past few cycles confirmed the existence of rieger - type periods in different indicators of solar magnetic activity , viz .  in x - ray flares @xcite , in the occurrence rates of solar flare",
    "energetic electrons @xcite , in sunspot group numbers @xcite , in type ii and iv radio bursts @xcite , in type iii radio bursts @xcite , and in microwave @xcite and proton @xcite flares .",
    "@xcite investigated the occurrence of flares inferred from microwave data and found a strong confirmation of a 152 day periodicity .",
    "@xcite reported an analysis of major flares observed with the hard x - ray burst spectrometer ( hxrbs ) aboard smm and conclude that the 152-day periodicity is a global phenomenon .",
    "therefore , the underlying cause of this periodicity must be a mechanism involving the whole sun .",
    "rieger - type periods of 152 - 158 days were found in solar data which are related to strong magnetic fields on the surface @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that the periodicity was present in the sunspot blocking function , in the 10.7 cm radio flux and in sunspot numbers , while it was not significant in the case of the plage index .",
    "this suggests that rieger periodicity is not only a feature of flare activity , but that it is also associated with regions of compact magnetic field structures .",
    "therefore , the periodicity should be connected to the location where the strong magnetic field is generated . in a series of papers",
    ", @xcite detected the rieger periodicity in measurements of the solar diameter variations , the total irradiance , the 10.7 cm radio flux and the 10830 @xmath2 helium line .",

    "many authors have studied the long - term appearance of the rieger - type periodicity .",
    "@xcite examined sunspot area data during the solar cycles 12 - 21 and found that the periodicity usually appears near the cycle maxima .",
    "it was shown that the 155 day periodicity occurs during intervals of 1 to 3 years , and that it may vary from 130 to 185 days .",
    "a similar result was found by @xcite and @xcite through a wavelet analysis of sunspot area . @xcite and",
    "@xcite presented evidence of the 155 days periodicity in records of the sunspot area during the cycles 14 to 20 and 12 to 21 , respectively .",

    "@xcite analyzed the historical records of photospheric magnetic flux and found that the periodicity appeared during cycle 21 , but that it was absent in cycle 22 .",
    "@xcite used a wavelet and fourier analysis to investigate the temporal behavior of the 156 day periodicity for series of daily solar indices : the wolf numbers for 161 years ( from 1849 ) , the solar flux at @xmath3mhz f10.7 for 63 years",
    "( from 1947 ) , the number of x - ray flares for 29 years ( from 1981 ) , and the number of optical flares for 11 years in cycle 21 . hence , all these previous studies showed that the rieger periodicity of 154 day is not a permanent feature of the solar activity , but that it varies from cycle to cycle .",
    "the physical reason for the occurrence of the rieger - type periodicity is not completely clear .",
    "several different mechanisms have been suggested to explain the enigmatic features of the periodicity .",
    "@xcite suggested that the 155-day periodicity may be connected to the timescale of the storage and/or the escape of the magnetic fields in the solar convection zone .",
    "@xcite supposed a clock modelled by an oblique rotator or oscillator with a period of 25.8 days , and suggested that the periodicity of 155 - 160 days is just a subharmonic of that fundamental period .",
    "@xcite and @xcite suggested that the periodicity can be explained in terms of r - mode oscillations ( which are actually hydrodynamic ( hd ) rossby or planetary waves ) of the solar interior .",
    "@xcite suggested that the rieger periodicity can be related to large - scale equatorially trapped hd rossby - type waves in the solar photosphere .",
    "however , the hd rossby wave theory does not take into account the magnetic field , therefore it is unclear how the waves can modulate the solar magnetic activity .",
    "recently , @xcite suggested that the rieger - type periods of 155 - 160 days could be explained by magnetic rossby waves in the solar tachocline , which are unstable owing to the differential rotation and the toroidal magnetic field .",
    "unstable harmonics of magnetic rossby waves lead to the periodic emergence of magnetic flux at the solar surface due to the magnetic buoyancy , which causes the observed periodicity in the magnetic activity .",
    "the dispersion relation of the magnetic rossby waves depends on the unperturbed magnetic field strength @xcite .",
    "therefore , the possible variation of the mean dynamo magnetic field from cycle to cycle may influence the rieger periodicity , which could be correlated with the strength of the solar cycle .",
    "the observed periodicity can then be used to estimate the magnetic field strength in the solar dynamo layer near the base of the convection zone , using the dispersion relation of the magnetic rossby waves .",
    "the strength of the dynamo magnetic field is crucial to know which dynamo model works in the solar interior @xcite .",
    "therefore , probing the dynamo layer by exploiting the rieger periodicity may appear as a very important tool to better understand the solar magnetic activity .    in this paper",
    ", we first analyze the sunspot data of the greenwich royal observatory ( gro ) and royal observatory of belgium ( rob ) for cycles 14 - 24 , using the morlet wavelet tool @xcite , in order to find rieger - type periods during the different cycles and to establish their relation with the cycle strength .",
    "then , we derive the dispersion relation of the magnetic rossby waves in the presence of a toroidal magnetic field and differential rotation . finally , we estimate the strength of the toroidal magnetic field in the solar dynamo layer during the cycles 14 - 24 , using the dispersion relation of the fast magnetic rossby waves .",
    "in order to study the dependence of the rieger - type periodicity on the solar cycle strength , we use two data sets , viz .",
    "1 )  the greenwich royal observatory ( gro ) usaf / noaa sunspot data ( http://solarscience.msfc.nasa.gov/greenwch.shtml ) ; and 2 )  the wdc - silso , royal observatory of belgium ( rob ) new sunspot number data ( http://www.sidc.be/silso/datafiles ) . the gro data sets starts from 1874 ( which corresponds to cycle 12 ) and runs till 2015 , but we here use only data from july 1901 till december 2015 ( which corresponds to the period from the minimum of cycle 14 till the descending phase of cycle 24 ) because of the data gaps that occur in cycles 12 - 13 .",
    "the rob data starts from 1818 and runs till 2015 , and covers the cycles 10 - 24 .",
    "however , we here only use the same interval from 1900 to 2015 , in order to compare with the gro data .",
    "we use a morlet wavelet analysis to search for the rieger periodicity in the solar cycles 14 - 24 in both data sets .",
    "figure  1 shows the power spectra of the sunspot area variations through the different solar cycles using the gro ( middle panel ) and the rob ( lower panel ) daily data . in this figure",
    ", it is clearly seen that oscillations with rieger - type periods are localized near the cycle maxima , as was previously discovered @xcite .",
    "the periodicity changes from cycle to cycle and one can easily see ( even with the naked eye ) that the stronger cycles generally support oscillations with shorter periods .",
    "for example , cycle 21 , during which the rieger - type periodicity was discovered @xcite , was one of the strongest cycles in the 20th century and a periodicity of 155 - 160 days has been found in both data sets .",
    "a similar periodicity appears during the other strong cycles 17 and 18 . on the other hand ,",
    "the weaker cycles ( 14 , 15 , and 24 ) show oscillations with a longer periodicity .",
    "therefore , the rieger periodicity is clearly correlated with the solar cycle strength . to estimate the rieger periods during each cycle",
    ", we performed a morlet wavelet analysis in each cycle separately of both the gro and rob data .",
    "the rieger periods that resulted from the global wavelet spectra during cycles 14 - 24 , which cover an interval of 150 - 200 days , are given in table  1 and shown on fig .",
    "2 . both the gro and rob data display similar periods in each cycle ( with a difference of only a few days ) .",
    "we note that some oscillatory power is located in periodicities longer than 200 days ( it is more clearly seen on upper panel of figure  1 ) , which correspond to the longer period branch like the quasi - annual oscillations found by @xcite .",
    "the goal of this paper , however , is to study the rieger periodicity only .",
    "therefore , we did not show the upper part of the power spectrum ( @xmath4 200 days ) , which has a complex nature and may have a different physical origin .",
    "we will study the complete spectrum of oscillations in the near future .",
    "figure  2 clearly shows that the rieger periodicity is correlated with the long - term variations in the solar cycle strength .",
    "the solar cycle itself is modulated by the so - called gleissberg period of about 100 years @xcite , which is also seen in long term evolution of sunspot data ( e.g.  upper panel of fig .  1 ) .",
    "the rieger periodicity displays a similar long - term evolution : a longer periodicity corresponds to weaker cycles .",
    "the correlation coefficient between the rieger periodicity from the gro ( rob ) data and the sunspot number is estimated as -0.64 ( -0.67 ) , respectively , which is a rather strong correlation @xcite .",
    "this correlation probably indicates a connection of the periodicity to the region in the solar interior , where the dynamo magnetic field is generated .",
    "@xcite explained the occurrence of the rieger periodicity in terms of rossby waves in the tachocline , which are influenced by the large - scale toroidal dynamo magnetic field .",
    "then , the variation of the mean toroidal magnetic field strength through different cycles can be responsible for the observed different periods in sunspot data .",
    "the dispersion relation of spherical magnetic rossby waves was derived by @xcite in the simplest case of rigid rotation and a homogeneous magnetic field .",
    "then , @xcite were able to derive the dispersion relation in the case of a more realistic latitudinal profile of the toroidal magnetic field , which resembles the dynamo magnetic field . in both cases ,",
    "the dispersion relations were obtained for a rigid rotation .",
    "however , observations show that the solar rotation has a latitudinal profile being faster at the equator and slower at poles .",
    "the differential rotation is , however , solar - cycle dependent : the equatorial rotation and the parameters of the differential rotation vary from cycle to cycle @xcite . the differential rotation may influence the spectrum of magnetic rossby waves and , hence , should be taken into account when deriving the dispersion relation",
    ".        the observed profile of the solar differential rotation is given by @xmath5 where @xmath6 denotes the co - latitude , @xmath7 is the equatorial angular velocity , while @xmath8 and @xmath9 are constant parameters .",
    "the last term in the expression above is especially important at high latitudes , but has less influence at lower latitudes .",
    "moreover , the observation of the differential rotation at higher latitudes is uncertain to some extent which may cause significant errors in the estimation of the parameter @xmath9 .",
    "therefore , many authors neglect this term when they construct the differential rotation profile . for simplicity of the further calculations",
    ", we here also neglect the term @xmath10 , and hence the following simplified differential rotation profile is used throughout the remainder of the present paper @xmath11 this expression is more justified at lower latitudes , where the main magnetic activity takes place .    in the next section ,",
    "we derive the dispersion relation for the magnetic rossby waves including the effect of differential rotation .",
    "rossby waves ( or planetary waves ) are large - scale waves , that occur due to the latitudinal variation of the coriolis parameter on rotating spheres @xcite .",
    "the waves determine the large - scale dynamics of the earth atmosphere and oceans @xcite .",
    "the inclusion of the large - scale toroidal magnetic field influences the dynamics of the rossby waves in plasma , leading to the splitting of the hydrodynamic mode into fast and slow magnetic rossby modes @xcite .",
    "therefore , the strength of the magnetic field generally determines the frequency spectrum of the magnetic rossby waves .",
    "we use the spherical coordinate system @xmath12 , where @xmath13 denotes the distance from the solar center , @xmath6 is the co - latitude and @xmath14 is the longitude .",
    "we assume that the unperturbed magnetic field has only a toroidal component @xmath15 the dispersion relation of the rossby waves can be derived from the shallow water mhd equations , which include the radial coordinate as the height of a shallow layer .",
    "the consideration of a shallow layer leads to the appearance of surface gravity or poincar waves in the dispersion relation . for a negligible thickness of the layer , however , the surface gravity waves disappear and only the rossby waves remain @xcite .",
    "hence , the consideration of a spherical surface @xmath16 correctly describes the main properties of rossby waves for a negligible thickness of the layer with regards to the solar radius .",

    "the rieger - type periodicity of 154 - 160 days observed in the solar magnetic activity variation is one of the unsolved problems of solar physics .",
    "it is clear that the periodicity is not a permanent feature : it appears only from time to time , persists during several years and then disappears again .",
    "it was shown in previous studies that the periodicity usually appears during maxima of the solar magnetic cycles @xcite . however , not all cycles show evidence of the periodicity .",
    "several different mechanisms have been suggested , but none of these could explain why the periodicity is seen in one cycle , but not in another one . the only possibility is to suppose that the periodicity strongly depends on the solar cycle strength and , hence , on the dynamo magnetic field .",
    "this hypothesis is strengthened by the fact that the periodicity is also seen in emerging magnetic flux , which clearly indicates to its connection to deeper layers .",
    "@xcite suggested that the rieger periodicity can be explained by magnetic rossby waves in the solar tachocline .",
    "the magnetic rossby waves are related to the hd rossby waves but affected by the toroidal magnetic field .",
    "therefore , the periods of spherical harmonics of the waves depend on the magnetic field strength @xcite .",
    "consequently , the variation of the mean dynamo field ( which actually defines the strength of the solar cycles ) from cycle to cycle may lead to a significant variation of the observed rieger - type periodicity .    in this paper",
    ", we have studied long - term sunspot data sets from the greenwich royal observatory and the royal observatory of belgium for cycles 14 - 24 , using a morlet wavelet method .",
    "our analysis showed that the rieger - type periodicity appears in all cycles , but that the periods are varying from 155 to 200 days from cycle to cycle .",
    "figure  1 clearly showed that the periodicity correlates with the solar magnetic activity : shorter periods generally appear during stronger cycles .",
    "this means that the dilemma of the disappearance of the periodicity in some cycles can be easily solved : the periodicity does not disappear but it changes .",
    "for example , @xcite analysed the cycles 12 - 21 and showed that the periodicity of 155 days was absent in the cycles 12 - 15 , but it was present in cycles 16 - 21",
    ". a careful look at figure  1 of the present paper shows that the periodicity during cycles 16 - 21 is about 155 - 160 days , in complete agreement with @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the periodicity during cycles 14 - 15 is 185 - 190 days in our analysis , while it was absent in the analysis of @xcite as these authors only looked for a periodicity of 155 - 160 days .",
    "we conclude that the cycle strength defines the value of rieger - type periodicity .",
    "this also means that the rieger - type period during individual cycles can give information about the strength of the cycle .",
    "as the cycle strength is probably connected with the dynamo magnetic field , the rieger periodicity may then provide a tool to estimate the field strength in individual cycles .",
    "different dynamo models predict different locations of the layer where the solar magnetic field is amplified .",
    "the traditional approach is that the dynamo layer is located below the convection zone , where the transition between the differentially rotating convection zone and the uniformly rotating radiative envelope takes place .",
    "this thin stable transition layer , called the tachocline @xcite , permits the storage of a strong toroidal magnetic field . this magnetic field",
    "then becomes unstable due to magnetic buoyancy and as a result magnetic flux rises upwards in the form of magnetic flux tubes , which appear as sunspots at the surface @xcite .",
    "the magnetic field strength can be estimated from simulations of rising magnetic flux tubes , which yields values of @xmath81 kg @xcite .",

    "these simulations mostly concern the young sun with faster rotation , but they caused some suspicion regarding the significance of the tachocline in the formation of the current solar cycles .",
    "in particular , @xcite used the current solar parameters and could reproduce the toroidal magnetic field with periodic reversals without the need of a tachocline .",
    "the maximum magnetic field was achieved near the base of the convection zone with a strength of @xmath80 kg ( though the field strength may depend on parameters of solar convection during simulations ) .",
    "hence , the dynamo magnetic field models with a tachocline predict stronger toroidal fields than those without a tachocline .",
    "since the rieger periodicity correlates to the strength of dynamo magnetic field , it may place some constraints on these dynamo models",
    ". however , one still needs a physical mechanism that is responsible for causing the periodicity .    in the present paper",
    ", we suggest that the rieger periodicity is caused by magnetic rossby waves within the dynamo layer .",
    "the rossby waves may occur on a 2d spherical surface and , hence , may work in any dynamo model with or without a tachocline .",
    "we derived the dispersion relation of the magnetic rossby waves modified by the existing latitudinal differential rotation ( eq .  20 ) .",
    "this equation is similar to eq .",
    "( 5 ) in @xcite , but the additional constant @xmath8 appears as a result of taking into account the differential rotation . when @xmath69 , then eq .  ( 20 ) reduces to eq .",
    "( 5 ) of @xcite .",
    "figure  3 shows that the period of the spherical harmonic of the fast magnetic rossby waves with @xmath49 and @xmath50 gives a periodicity of 150 - 190 days for a toroidal magnetic field strength of @xmath78 kg .",
    "therefore , this harmonic can be responsible for the observed rieger periodicity in different solar cycles .",
    "it was shown that the joint action of differential rotation and the toroidal magnetic field may lead to a global mhd instability in the tachocline @xcite .",
    "this is probably the same instability found by @xcite for magnetic rossby waves through the method of legendre polynomial expansion .",
    "@xcite used an inertial frame in the analysis , while @xcite used a rotating frame .",
    "it is well known that the rossby wave spectrum generally appears in the frame co - rotating with a sphere .",
    "therefore , we suggest that global mhd instabilities found by @xcite will show the magnetic rossby wave spectrum if a rotating frame would be used instead of an inertial frame .    using the dispersion relation ( eq .",
    "21 ) of the @xmath49 and @xmath50 spherical harmonic and the observed rieger - type periods from the rgo and the rob sunspot data for cycles 14 - 24 , we then estimated the toroidal magnetic field strength below the solar convection zone during these cycles .",
    "figure  4 shows the resulting magnetic field strength . in most cycles ( 16 - 23 )",
    "the estimated magnetic field strength is @xmath87 kg .",
    "however , in very weak cycles ( such as cycles 14 , 15 and 24 ) the estimated field strength is reduced to @xmath88 kg .",
    "the toroidal magnetic field strength is very important to understand the solar dynamo .",
    "our results show that the estimated strength of the toroidal magnetic field corresponds to the dynamo models with a tachocline rather than to those without a tachocline .",
    "this is because the estimated strength of @xmath89 kg is too high for the dynamo models where the tachocline is absent @xcite .",
    "however , the estimated magnetic field strength is a rather rough approximation as the dispersion relation is obtained analytically for lower latitudes and a small differential rotation .",
    "other more complex methods , for example , a legendre polynomial expansion , may yield a smaller estimate for the strength of the toroidal field @xcite . on the other hand , even dynamo models with a tachocline predict controversial values of the magnetic field strength . as a matter of fact , early estimations of the toroidal field strength inferred from simulations of rising magnetic flux tubes @xcite showed values around @xmath90 kg , which is orders of magnitude larger than the equipartition field strength estimated from the convection . on the other hand , dynamic flux - transport dynamo models that include the feedback of the induced magnetic field on differential rotation and meridional flow estimated the saturated field strength at the base of the convection zone as @xmath91 kg @xcite .",
    "yet , recent 3d numerical simulations of rising flux tubes through a convection zone , which include the coupling between flux tube and surrounding convective flow field , found best agreement with observed active region properties for the field strength of @xmath92 kg @xcite . the results of these 3d simulations are in very good agreement with our estimations for strong cycles 16 - 23 . on the other hand , the weaker cycles ( 14 , 15 and 24 ) with the magnetic field strength of @xmath88 kg may lead to slightly different properties of active regions ( tilt , latitudes , etc . ) .",
    "the idea can be tested by comparison of observations during the weak cycles and 3d simulations using a field strength of @xmath88 kg .",
    "this can be done for the current cycle 24 due to the better possibility to trace the properties of active regions .",
    "a wavelet analysis of the greenwich royal observatory ( usaf / noaa ) and the royal observatory of belgium ( wdc - silso ) sunspot data for solar cycles 14 - 24 showed the existence of a rieger - type periodicity in all cycles .",
    "the sunspot cycles 14 , 15 , 24 and 16 - 23 displayed a periodicity of 185 - 195 and 155 - 165 days , respectively .",
    "it is found that the periodicity correlates with the cycle strength : stronger cycles show shorter periods .",
    "the periodicity is explained in terms of magnetic rossby waves near the base of convection zone .",
    "the periods of the spherical harmonic of fast magnetic rossby waves with @xmath49 and @xmath50 , where @xmath82 ( @xmath83 ) denotes toroidal ( poloidal ) wave number , perfectly fit with the observed periodicity for the cycle - dependent toroidal magnetic field .",
    "the observed rieger - type periodicity is then used to estimate the dynamo magnetic field strength during cycles 14 - 24 .",
    "the estimations predict the magnetic field strengths of @xmath84 kg and @xmath9340 kg for cycles 14 , 15 , 24 and 16 - 23 , respectively , in the dynamo layer , which may correspond to the tachocline or may lie somewhere in the convection zone .",
    "the estimated field strength corresponds to the dynamo models with tachocline rather than to those without tachocline , but more sophisticated methods may change this situation .",
    "the estimated strength is in good agreement with recent 3d numerical simulations of rising flux tubes through a convection zone , which include the coupling between flux tube and surrounding convective flow field @xcite .",
    "a careful analysis of the different data sets using different statistical methods may improve the values of rieger periods in different cycles , while numerical simulations may lead to more precise estimations of dynamo magnetic field strength .",
