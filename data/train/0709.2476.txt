    "synonyms are a well - known and important part of a language . according to a definition by leibniz , two concepts are synonymous if the substitution of one for another never changes the truth value of the sentence in which the substitution occurs .",
    "but such a pure synonymy either does nt exist at all , or is very rare .",
    "instead a weakened version of this definition which considers synonyms as relative to the context in which they are used , applies in general , i.e. two concepts are synonyms in a context if the substitution of one for another does not change the truth value of the context @xcite .",
    "people may use several words to express a certain concept , i.e. a concept can be represented by these several words known as synonyms .",
    "if the set of synonyms of a certain concept is large , we may well say that this concept is important to the people using it .",
    "when a synonym for a concept is created , it is not done simply for fun and is not cost free .",
    "generally , people need to create it and when doing this , some cognitive processing is done by the brain .",
    "if people need to extend the synonym set of a concept , then this means that this specific concept is widely used and important to them .",
    "since each nation has its own language , culture and way of living , the needs for synonyms of a certain concept may differ from one culture to the other according to the importance given to concepts by those cultures .",
    "thinking in this way , it could be possible to capture culture differences as well as similarities by examining synonym networks from different languages . since east and west are considered to be two extremes of culture , it would be interesting and worth studying on different eastern and western languages",
    ". this was our motivation and aim at the start of our work .",
    "there has been some previous work on the topic of linguistic networks .",
    "for example , ferrer & sole made use of the british national corpus in constructing huge word networks in which the words are linked to each other if they are directly neighbors in a sentence @xcite .",
    "they found that the network were scale free and showed small world properties .",
    "motter constructed synonym networks by using an english thesaurus and found small - world characteristics @xcite .",
    "sigman & cecchi used wordnet to analyze english nouns @xcite .",
    "they analyzed the network by using the relationships between concepts , such as hyponymy , meronomy , holonymy , antonymy etc .",
    "they found that the presence of polysemy dramatically changes the compactness of the network .",
    "steyvers & tenenbaum made a study on three types of semantic networks : word associations , wordnet , and roget s thesaurus @xcite .",
    "they showed that these networks have a small - world structure and that the distributions of the number of connections follow power laws .",
    "as far as we are concerned , no prior work has been done in analyzing the synonym graphs of different languages in attempt to find possible culture differences as well as similarities . in this aspect",
    "ours is a novice work .    since the beginning of the work , we aimed at studying on four different languages , two eastern and two western ones , but we had the possibility to work only on english and turkish , each of them being a representative of west and east respectively .",
    "actually we are planning to extend the work to other languages such as : italian , hindu , arabic and hebrew , whose electronic resources we have recently obtained .",
    "one of the most important issues was the choice of the electronic resource .",
    "we decided to make use of wordnet facility whose english and turkish versions were available to us .",
    "the explanation of wordnet and the reason why we chose it will be given in the following section .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : section 2 consists of a brief introduction to wordnet , in section 3 we explain how we constructed the synonym graphs , section 4 consists of the graph analysis results , in section 5 we give the drawn conclusions and at the end , the references used .",
    "wordnet is an on - line lexical reference system whose design is based on psycholinguistic theories of human lexical memory .",
    "english nouns , verbs , and adjectives are organized into synonym sets each representing one underlying lexical concept .",
    "synonym sets are linked by different relations , such as antonymy , meronomy , hyponymy @xcite .",
    "its development began in 1985 at princeton university under the direction of george a. miller .",
    "several versions of it have been made available through the years .",
    "the most recent version for windows is 2.1 , but we used the version 2.0 for windows , because that same version of the turkish wordnet was available to us at the time .",
    "the english 2.0 version contains 125207 words and 99143 synonym sets . on the other hand ,",
    "turkish wordnet was developped at sabanci university under the direction of kemal oflazer .",
    "it is part of the balkanet project and the current version contains 15491 words and 14796 synonym sets @xcite .    at this stage of the work , we were concerned only with synonymy relationship , the one that really characterizes wordnet .",
    "wordnet consists of sets of synonymous words called synsets .",
    "the words inside a synset are synonyms of each other in a symmetric manner , i.e. if word @xmath0 is synonym of word @xmath1 , then @xmath1 is synonym of @xmath0 as well . a concept ( word meaning ) can be represented by the words inside its respective synonym set used to express it .",
    "for example two meanings of _ board _ can be represented unambiguously by these synonym sets : \\{_board _ , _ plank _ } and \\{_board _ , _",
    "comittee_}. in addition each synonym set is accompanied by a definition of the underlying concept , an example of its usage in a sentence or expression , the domain to which it belongs , for example the domain of the concept _ organism _ is biology .",
    "its lexical and computational features make wordnet an efficient and widely used tool for natural language processing .",
    "we made use of wordnet as a lexical resource in order to construct our complex networks in both languages .",
    "the resulting networks showed to be scale free , have a small worlds structure and follow power law @xcite .",
    "first of all , we assigned a unique i d to each word available in wordnet and stored them in the appropriate tables of our database .",
    "we treated each word as a vertex ( node ) of the network and every synonymous relationship between two words as an edge .",
    "for example , if there is a synonymous relationship between the words _ hard _ and _ difficult _ , then there is an edge from _ hard _ to _ difficult _ as well as from _ difficult _ to _",
    "hard_.        consider a synonym set @xmath2 consisting of the words @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , then we construct twelve edges representing the symmetric synonymous relationship between every word pair as shown in figure [ figsinglesynset ] .",
    "the number of edges @xmath7 , resulting from the words in a synonym set could be expressed as :    @xmath8    where @xmath9 is the number of words ( vertices ) of the synonym set . in this way",
    ", our graphs are directed , preserving the symmetric synonymous relationship between any two words .    for every pair of synonymous words",
    "there are two cases : either corresponding meanings ( named as sense in wordnet ) of the words are synonymous or non - corresponding ones are .",
    "consider this example taken from the english wordnet : the first sense ( meaning ) of the word _",
    "barely _ is synonymous to the first sense of the word _ hardly _ , but the third sense of word _",
    "cut _ is synonymous to the fourth sense of the word _",
    "shortened_. we do nt distinguish between corresponding or non corresponding senses of synonymous words when we analyze the networks , i.e. we do nt do any sense filtering during graph analysis at this stage of the work .",
    "we keep the information that a certain sense of a certain word is synonymous to a certain sense of another word in the database but we do nt show this specifically in our network . whenever there is a clique i.e. a fully connected component in the graph , resulting from nodes linked by single edges , then this means that the nodes of this component take place in the same synonym set and share the same concept ( word meaning ) .",
    "often it is possible to go from one word to another one of a different meaning through a path in the network .",
    "consider the graph in figure [ figdoublesynsets ] , which results from two synonym sets .",
    "let synonym set @xmath2 = \\{@xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 } and set @xmath10 = \\{@xmath3 , @xmath5 , @xmath11}. in set @xmath2 the synonymous relationships with respect to the senses of the words are as follows : the first sense of @xmath3 , the third sense of @xmath4 , the second sense of @xmath5 and the fourth sense of @xmath6 are synonymous to each other . on the other hand , the synonymous relationships with respect to the senses of the words in set @xmath10 are : the third sense of @xmath3 , the first sense of @xmath5 and the fifth sense of @xmath11 are synonymous to each other . in figure",
    "[ figdoublesynsets ] set @xmath2 is represented by the fully connected component ( clique ) consisting of the nodes @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and set @xmath10 is represented by the clique consisting of the nodes @xmath3 , @xmath5 , @xmath11 .",
    "the concepts ( word meanings ) expressed by these two synonym sets are different but there exist paths from one set to the other for example : @xmath6-@xmath3-@xmath11 , @xmath11-@xmath5-@xmath4 etc .",
    "after constructing our complex networks , we began to analyze them on basis of graph theory criteria .",
    "we made use of pajek software for network analysis @xcite .",
    "first we looked at some basic network properties , which we briefly show by table [ tblbasicnetwork ] :    .basic network properties [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tblcenterwordtr3 ]    another analysis we performed was that of finding the center words of both networks . to achieve this , we analyzed the largest island of the english network ( the others are very small compared to it ) and the three largest island of the turkish network whose sizes are closed and comparable to each other . in table [ tblcenterworden ] , [ tblcenterwordtr1 ] , [ tblcenterwordtr2 ] , and [ tblcenterwordtr3 ] , we show the first five center words for each island in both networks .",
    "the average distance is calculated by the following formula :    @xmath12    where @xmath13 is the average distance for a node @xmath14 with respect to all of its neighbours , @xmath15 is the the number of hops , @xmath16 is the diameter of island , @xmath17 is the number of nodes at @xmath15_th _ hop , and @xmath18 is the total number of nodes in the island .",
    "as it can be seen from the tables , all of the english center words take place in table [ tbltop20 ] and this is important for us .",
    "center words are important to a network and the fact that they are among the ones with largest synonym number emphasizes the importance of these words from our point of view also . now consider the turkish center words .",
    "in the first island ( table [ tblcenterwordtr1 ] ) , we see that center words are verbs . the verb _ olmak _ which is the most central word of the island appears in table [ tbltop20 ] as well .    in the second island ( table [ tblcenterwordtr2 ] )",
    ", only nouns are present . the word _ i _ is also present in table [ tbltop20 ] .",
    "in the third island ( table [ tblcenterwordtr3 ] ) , we can see that the word _",
    "ilgi _ is also present in table [ tbltop20 ] .            in figure [ figenglishreduction ] and figure [ figturkishreduction ]",
    ", we give the results of another network analysis , graph reduction .",
    "we used pajek to perform this analysis based on the following criteria : for english the words which have more than 48 synonyms and for turkish the ones that have more than 10 synonyms should survive the graph reduction .",
    "the survivor words are the same with those in table [ tbltop20 ] as it is obviously expected .",
    "also , we can notice that the reduced graph for english preserves in great part the connectivity , while the one for turkish does nt .",
    "this happens because of the great difference in network sizes , i.e. english network is huge compared to the turkish one .",
    "in this work we compared the synonym networks of english , a western language , and turkish , an eastern one in an attempt to find possible cultural differences or similarities between the two extremes , east and west .",
    "we made use of a well - known lexical database , wordnet to construct the complex networks for both languages .",
    "as expected , these networks are free - scale , obey to power law and show small world effects .",
    "previous work on linguistic networks in several aspects has been made , but we took the challenge of comparing eastern and western cultures by analyzing the synonym networks of two representative languages .",
    "synonyms are an important part of a language and the need to invent new one(s ) for a certain concept may differ from one culture to another , according to the importance given to that concept by those cultures .",
    "we simulated the networks on different graph theory criteria such as : degree distribution , finding center words , words with the largest degree ( synonym number ) and graph reduction .",
    "we obtained interesting results for both languages , especially with some english verbs and interesting words in turkish ( see analysis results ) .",
    "most of these interesting words were found to be center words a well , emphasizing in this way their importance from both the network and our point of view .",
    "cultural differences is a well - known and wide topic on which several work from psychologists and sociologists has been done ; we approached this matter by a different and new point of view . as future work , we plan to extend our study to four other languages : italian , hindi , arabic and hebrew , the wordnet license of which we have recently obtained . in this way",
    ", the comparison would be done from a wider and more consistent perspective .",
    "we also plan to add meaning filtering to the network analysis and to include also the various relationships between synonym sets in wordnets , such as hyponymy , meronomy , antonomy , etc . in the networks ."
