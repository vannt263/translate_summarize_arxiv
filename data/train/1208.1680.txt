    "gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are extremely bright explosions , with isotropic luminosities exceeding @xmath18 erg / sec , durations in the range @xmath19 sec and energy of peak luminosity in the @xmath20ray regime , @xmath21 mev , hence their name .",
    "they are believed to originate in the collapse of stellar cores or the mergers of neutron stars , processes which result in jet - like relativistic outflows of lorentz factors @xmath22 , whose kinetic energy is converted efficiently into radiation at distances @xmath23 cm at a relativistic blast wave ( rbw ) to produce the observed events ( for a review see piran 2005 ) .",
    "following their most luminous , prompt , @xmath20ray emission , they shift into the afterglow phase with peak luminosity in the x - ray band and duration of @xmath24 s , in which their localization can be refined and optical detection can provide their redshift .",
    "the theory of rbw slow - down indicated a smooth power law decay @xmath25 for the flux of their afterglow x - ray light curves , and indeed the pre-_swift _ sparsely sampled ones appeared consistent with such a behavior .",
    "however , their more densely sampled x - ray light curves with the xrt aboard _ swift _ uncovered significant deviations from this behavior .",
    "so , following the prompt emission in @xmath20rays , the typical xrt afterglow consists @xcite of a much steeper flux decline ( @xmath26 ) , followed by a @xmath27 sec period of nearly constant flux , followed finally at @xmath28 by the more conventional power - law decline @xmath29 .",
    "in addition , _ swift _ follow - ups discovered also occasional flares on top of these light curves , as late as @xmath24 sec since the burst alert telescope ( bat ) trigger .    in their prompt phase grbs exhibit a broad light curve diversity and a large variance in their ( estimated ) rbw lorentz factors ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "these properties , along with the non - thermal character of their spectra , suggest that at least in this phase , grbs are not likely to provide well defined , underlying systematics that would allow a probe of the physics of prompt emission .",
    "however , a number of correlations has been found between observables of the prompt phase @xcite , whose origin remains still largely unaccounted for .",
    "one of the first such correlations , made possible only after the determination of the grb redshifts by their afterglow emission , is that between the burst peak isotropic luminosity , @xmath31 , and the spectral lag , @xmath2 , between different energy bands in the grb spectrum . this relation has been studied in detail by a number of authors @xcite for data sets obtained by different instruments aboard different missions .",
    "the general conclusion of all these studies has been an anti - correlation @xmath32 with a value of @xmath33 .",
    "the spectral lag is defined as the difference in the arrival time of high and low energy photons , and is taken to be positive when the time of arrival of high energy photons precedes that of low energy photons .",
    "normally the spectral lag is extracted between two arbitrary energy bands in the observer frame and then corrected for the time dilatation effect ( @xmath0correction ) by multiplying the lag value in the observer frame by @xmath34 .",
    "moreover the observed energy bands correspond to different energy bands at the grb source frame for different redshifts , and so one needs to take into account this energy dependent factor ( @xmath1correction ) . using the assumption that the spectral lag is proportional to the pulse width which in turn is proportional to the energy ,",
    "@xcite approximately corrected for this effect by multiplying the lag value in the observer frame by @xmath35 .",
    "alternatively the @xmath1correction can be done by extracting the spectral lags in the grb source frame .",
    "this is accomplished by choosing two energy bands in the source frame and then projecting these in the observer frame using the relation @xmath36 , such that the projected energy bands lie in the _ swift _ bat energy range @xmath37 kev .",
    "this alternative method of extracting the spectral lags in the source frame rather than the observer frame , was recently used by @xcite to obtain a similar result for the @xmath38 relation , but with a higher degree of correlation between the variables .",
    "the physical origin of the lag - luminosity relation is still unclear .",
    "some , including @xcite and @xcite , attributed this to a kinematic effect ; @xcite , following an in depth analysis of existing proposals , concludes in favor of the time evolution of the emitting electrons , on the basis of a correlation between the energy of the grb peak emission and the burst instantaneous flux .",
    "however , irrespective of its physical origin , this relation is a useful tool in grb science , not only for its use in distinguishing between long and short bursts [ with long bursts in general exhibiting larger lags than short ones ; although it has been shown @xcite that this may not be necessarily true for every long grb ] , but also for its implementation , together with other relations between grb variables , in extending the hubble diagram to higher redshifts @xcite .",
    "an altogether different correlation , pertaining to the grb afterglow phase , has been reported recently by @xcite .",
    "this work presents a correlation between the x - ray luminosity , @xmath7 , of the plateau ( or shallow decay ) phase and the source frame break time @xmath39 in the xrt light curves of long grbs . using a sample of 62 _ swift _ long grbs a correlation of the form @xmath40 , with @xmath41 and @xmath42",
    "was obtained .",
    "a similar but steeper correlation @xmath43 was also obtained for a small group of grbs which belong to the intermediate class ( ic ) @xcite between short and long ones , indicating that these may behave in a different way than the long grbs .",
    "there have been claims @xcite that the dainotti relation is just a selection effect due to the flux detection limit for _ swift _ s xrt which prevents clear observation of faint light curves from high redshift grbs .",
    "this possibility was later investigated by @xcite who showed that there is no systematic bias against faint plateaus at high @xmath44 , thus confirming the existence of this relation .",
    "moreover @xcite have obtained a number of significant correlations between the afterglow phase x - ray luminosity parameter @xmath45 and prompt emission parameters such as the isotropic energy @xmath46 , peak energy @xmath47 and the variability parameter @xmath48 @xcite .",
    "+ in this work we use a sample of 14 grbs which are common in the @xcite and @xcite studies , to obtain and compare their lag - luminosity and break time - x - ray luminosity relations in the grb source frame after doing the necessary @xmath49- and @xmath44- corrections .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we discuss briefly the correlations and computational procedures involved in the spectral lag - isotropic luminosity relation of @xcite together with the x - ray luminosity of the grb shallow afterglow phase and its break time of @xcite . in section 3 we present our results and then in section 4 we summarize our findings and conclusions .",
    "in their work on the lag - luminosity relation @xcite developed a method for calculating the time - averaged spectral lag using a modification of the cross - correlation function ( ccf ) with delay @xmath50 @xcite given by @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are sets of time - sequenced data over @xmath54 bins , and then defining the spectral lag as the time delay which corresponds to the global maximum of the ccf .",
    "they obtained the uncertainty in the spectral lag using the monte carlo method by simulating 1000 light curves for each real light curve - pair and calculating the ccf values using equation ( [ ccf ] ) for a series of time delays .",
    "then they obtained the uncertainty from the standard deviation of the ccf values per time delay bin of these simulated light curves .",
    "+ to obtain the peak isotropic luminosity , @xmath5 , @xcite fitted grb spectra with the band function @xcite for the photon flux per unit photon energy using @xmath55^{\\alpha-\\beta}\\,e^{(\\beta - \\alpha ) } , & \\mbox{otherwise } , \\end{array } \\right . \\label{band}\\ ] ] where @xmath56 is the amplitude , @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the low - energy and high - energy spectral indices respectively , and @xmath59 is the peak energy of the @xmath60 spectrum . the observed peak flux is expressed in terms of the source frame spectrum @xmath61 between energies @xmath62 kev and @xmath63 kev by @xmath64 this was then used by @xcite to compute the isotropic peak luminosity from @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the grb luminosity distance computed in terms of the redshift @xmath44 by @xmath67 assuming a flat @xmath68 cosmological model with @xmath69 , @xmath70 and a hubble constant @xmath71 of @xmath72 .",
    "the uncertainty in @xmath5 was again determined using monte carlo methods by calculating the luminosity for 1000 variations in the spectral parameters in ( [ band ] ) for each grb , so that the real values and uncertainties are given by the sample means and sample standard deviations respectively .    for the @xmath73 relation @xcite",
    "( see also @xcite ) used the fitting procedure of @xcite to analyze the afterglow xrt light curves of a sample of _ swift _ grbs and derive the source frame parameters @xmath8 and @xmath45 for each afterglow .",
    "the x - ray luminosity @xmath45 at the time @xmath8 , at which the light curve switches from the plateau to the declining phase was calculated by using @xmath74 where @xmath66 is the same luminosity distance given by equation ( [ luminosity ] ) , @xmath75 is the observed flux at time @xmath8 , and @xmath76 is the spectral index obtained for each afterglow @xcite .",
    "then they computed the uncertainties in the two parameters by using a bayesian motivated technique by @xcite .",
    "we collected a sample of 14 long grbs ( i.e. @xmath77 ) detected by _ swift _ bat between 2005 - 2008 with known redshifts ranging from 0.703 ( grb 060904b)to 4.056 ( grb 060206 ) , which are common in the samples of @xcite and @xcite studies .",
    "the prompt and afterglow parameters of each grb , including the spectral lag , peak isotropic luminosity @xmath5 , peak energy @xmath78 , break time @xmath8 , and x - ray luminosity @xmath45 are shown in table [ tbl-1 ] .",
    "the spectral lags are calculated between _ swift _ energy bands @xmath79 kev and @xmath4 kev in the grb source frame , after application of the @xmath44- and @xmath49- corrections , which are obtained by multiplying the observed values by @xmath80 as described in the section above .",
    "two of the grbs ( grb 060206 and grb 080603b ) have negative spectral lags , meaning that the time of arrival of low energy photons precedes that of high energy photons . although negative lags are not necessarily unphysical @xcite , we chose to exclude them due to the logarithmic nature of the lag luminosity relation in our plots .",
    "this was also done in previous studies of this relation by @xcite and @xcite and others .",
    "we find that the @xmath44- and @xmath49- corrected spectral lag @xmath2 and the peak isotropic luminosity @xmath5 are anti - correlated with a correlation coefficient @xmath81 of @xmath82 , which is slightly weaker than the value of @xmath83 obtained by @xcite for the whole sample of 31 grbs .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] is a log - log plot of the isotropic peak luminosity versus the @xmath44- and @xmath49-corrected spectral lag with the following best - fit power - law curve @xmath84 the best - fit power - law index of @xmath85 is consistent with the earlier result @xmath86 obtained by @xcite for the full sample of 31 grbs , with only redshift correction for the spectral lags .",
    "our result also agrees with the -1.14 power - law index obtained by @xcite using spectral lags between the batse energy bands @xmath87 kev and @xmath88 kev , and with those reported by @xcite @xmath89 and @xcite @xmath90 .",
    "we have also obtained an anti - correlation with @xmath91 between the break time @xmath8 at the shallow - to - normal decay transition in the grb afterglow light curve and the x - ray luminosity @xmath45 .",
    "this is surprisingly stronger than the @xmath92 anti - correlation obtained by @xcite for the full sample of 62 long grbs .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows a log - log plot of the break time @xmath8 versus the x - ray luminosity @xmath45 in the grb source frame , with a fitted power - law relation given by @xmath93 this best fit power - law index is consistent with the value @xmath94 obtained by @xcite for the full sample of grbs",
    ". it also agrees with the value obtained by @xcite ( @xmath95 ) for a small sample of 12 long grbs , and the recent study by @xcite who also obtained a power - law index of @xmath96 for a sample of 47 grbs .    noting the similarity of the slopes of the two relations in ( [ lt ] ) and ( [ lxta ] ) , and the fact that the ordinate of both is a luminosity while the abscissa represents a time scale , we present in figure [ fig3 ] a combined plot of the two relations in a single figure .",
    "it is evident , quite unexpectedly on our part , that one extrapolates into the other with the combined relation given by @xmath97 the increased dynamic range provides for a much tighter relation with correlation coefficient @xmath98 , and with slope much closer to -1 than the individual relations .",
    "in the sections above we reviewed correlations between the luminosities and time scales of two different stages in the grb development , namely the prompt emission and the shallow decay stage of their afterglow .",
    "we then reproduced the correlations between @xmath99 for the prompt emission and @xmath100 for the afterglow , for the grbs common in the data sets used by @xcite and @xcite , from the data already present in the literature .",
    "we have shown that although our grb sample is small , both relations are consistent ( in terms of power - law index and correlation coefficient ) with the previous relations obtained using larger samples .",
    "moreover we have shown that these two relations extrapolate very well into each other and give a much tighter relation ( eq .",
    "( 9 ) ) than the individual relations obtained so far .    for the first time we also noted that although the relations in equations ( [ lt ] ) and ( [ lxta ] ) represent different stages in the grb evolution , their power - law indices are surprisingly similar .",
    "yet from our data the source frame corrected spectral time lag and break time @xmath8 do not appear to be correlated .",
    "the fact that their normalizations are such that they extrapolate into each other , suggests that prompt and afterglow properties are interrelated .",
    "this fact could have been actually surmised from the original lag treatment of @xcite and the results of @xcite .",
    "the reader can easily confirm that the relation of @xcite extrapolates into that of @xcite .",
    "a correlation between the prompt and afterglow phases has also been explored by @xcite who obtained a correlation between the spectral lag @xmath2 and rest frame jet - break time @xmath101 given by @xmath102 using a sample of seven batse gamma - ray bursts .",
    "another correlation between prompt and afterglow quantities was recently obtained by @xcite , who obtained a three - parameter correlation between the rest frame isotropic energy in the prompt phase @xmath103 , the peak of the prompt emission energy spectrum @xmath78 , and the x - ray energy emitted in the @xmath104 kev observed energy band @xmath105 given by @xmath106 it was shown that this relation is robust and independent of the definition of @xmath105 .",
    "moreover @xcite and @xcite showed that this three - parameter relation is shared by both long and short gamma ray bursts and also claim that the physical origin of such a relation is related to the outflow lorentz factor .    at this stage",
    "we do not intend to speculate on the possible physics underlying the correlations of ( [ lt ] ) and ( [ lxta ] ) .",
    "instead , we present a brief review of proposed explanations found in the literature .",
    "then we conclude that , if indeed the underlying physics is common , as figure [ fig3 ] suggests , the apparently common origin of the two effects is basically kinematic .",
    "in the case of the spectral lag - luminosity relation one possible explanation for the observed lags involves the spectral evolution during the prompt phase @xcite in which due to cooling effects @xmath78 shifts towards a lower energy band so that the temporal peak of the corresponding light curve will also shift to lower energies , thereby resulting in the observed lag .",
    "another explanation for the spectral lag - luminosity relation is based purely on kinematic effects @xcite , where the peak luminosity @xmath107 and spectral lag @xmath2 depend on a single kinematic variable @xmath108 which represents the doppler factor for ejecta in a jet , moving at an angle @xmath109 from the line of sight with velocity @xmath110 at redshift @xmath44 .",
    "this kinematic variable relates a proper timescale @xmath2 in the grb rest frame to the observed timescale @xmath111 given by @xmath112 so that if the spectral lag is due to some decay time scale @xmath113 in the grb restframe , then this will become @xmath114 in the lab frame . moreover assuming a power - law spectrum with a low end of the form @xmath115 , where @xmath57 is the low energy spectral index , @xcite showed that the peak luminosity varies as @xmath116 with @xmath117 @xcite , so that equations ( [ timescales ] ) and ( [ lpk ] ) lead to the lag luminosity relation .",
    "the same argument was used by @xcite to explain their correlation in equation ( [ salmonson ] ) , where in this case the jet - break time @xmath118 .    in this approach ,",
    "the dependence of luminosities and observed timescales on the single variable @xmath119 leads to the conclusion that the observed variety among grbs has a kinematic origin , brought through variation of the viewing angle @xmath109 or the lorentz factor @xmath120 profile of the jet @xmath120 , or both .",
    "so for example , @xcite showed that the lag - luminosity relation is due only to a variation in the line - of - sight @xmath120 among bursts , with high @xmath120 bursts having smaller spectral lags and low @xmath120 bursts exhibiting longer ones . on the other hand",
    "@xcite showed that the lag - luminosity relation can be explained by variation in the observer angle , @xmath121 , from the axis of the jet , using a simple jet in which @xmath122 for @xmath123 , and zero emission for @xmath124 , where @xmath125 is the opening angle of the jet . in this case",
    "the lags arise due to the path difference between the near and far edges of the emitting region such that bright ( dim ) bursts with short ( long ) spectral lags correspond to small ( large ) viewing angle .",
    "an explanation for the anticorrelation between the duration of the intrinsic plateau phase of the grb light curve and x - ray luminosity has been proposed by @xcite using a model in which energy from a long - lived central engine is continuously injected to balance the radiative losses .",
    "these radiative losses will be stronger for higher luminosity , thus leading to shorter plateaus .",
    "another explanation which is based on the kinematic effect discussed above was proposed by @xcite , who claimed that the flat ( or sometimes slightly rising ) decay phase of the afterglow lightcurve results from the combination of the decaying tail of the prompt emission and early afterglow observed at viewing angles slightly outside the edge of the jet .",
    "for such `` offset '' viewing angles the afterglow flux initially rises at early times when the beaming of radiation away from the line of sight gradually decreases , then rounds off as the beaming cone expands to include the line of sight , and finally joins the familiar decaying light curve .    clearly , the relations given by equations ( [ lt ] ) , ( [ lxta ] ) and ( [ ltott ] ) call for further analysis with larger data sets to determine whether the indices and normalization of these relations are indeed consistent with those presented above .",
    "since the relations in ( [ lt ] ) , ( [ lxta ] ) correspond to the prompt and afterglow phases of the grb evolution , the similarity of their power - law indices and normalizations ( they extrapolate into each other in figure ( [ fig3 ] ) ) is an indication that a common process , probably kinematic , is responsible for the observed spectral lags and the shallow decay phase of the afterglow light curve . as discussed above , both these relations were attributed individually @xcite to the same kinematic process , namely viewing the grb jets at `` off - beam '' lines of sight .",
    "the results presented in this paper are in accordance with this explanation .",

    "<S> this fact suggests that these two relations have a common origin , which we conjecture to be kinematic . </S>",
    "<S> this relation adds to the recently discovered relations between properties of the prompt and afterglow grb phases , indicating a much more intimate relation between these two phases than hitherto considered . </S>"
