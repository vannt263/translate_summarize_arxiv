    "the masses of the central black holes in nearby non - active galaxies have been measured using stellar and gas kinematics of the central regions ( tremaine et al .",
    "2002 and references therein ) . in active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , the technique of reverberation mapping ( blandford & mckee 1982 ; peterson 1993 ;",
    "netzer & peterson 1997 ) has been used to measure the light - travel - time delay over which broad emission line flux responds to continuum luminosity variations , and to thus deduce the characteristic size of the broad - line region ( blr ) around the central , photoionizing source . by assuming the emission lines are broadened primarily by the virial gas motions in the gravitational potential of the central object , the blr size and the line width",

    "( 2000 ) found that the blr size scales with agn optical luminosity as @xmath8 . assuming that this scaling relation is universal to agns of all luminosities and redshifts , several recent studies have used the relation to estimate the central masses in large agn samples using a single - epoch measurement of the luminosity and the line width ( e.g. , wang & lu 2001 ; woo & urry 2002 ; grupe & mathur 2004 ) . since the reverberation studies above were based on the balmer emission lines , generally broad h@xmath4 , and on the optical agn luminosity , single - epoch estimates for objects at redshifts @xmath9 have had to rely either on ir observations ( e.g. , shemmer et al .",
    "2004 ) or on attempts to extend the optically based size - luminosity relation to uv luminosities and uv broad emission lines ( mclure & jarvis 2002 ; vestergaard 2002 ) .",

    "while we do not necessarily expect each of the balmer lines to have the same lag , we find empirically that the precision of the lag measurement for any one line is sufficiently low that averaging the balmer line lags for any particular source reduces the scatter in the radius - luminosity relationship .",

    "the results of table  [ results ] indicate that there is a systematic difference between the two fitting methods .",

    "we could not find what is the main cause for the differences and we attribute them to the different algorithms , strategies , and statistical concepts each of the two methods uses .",
    "the real uncertainty of the slope measurement should be the range between the different methods and not necessarily the formal error given by each method .",
    "furthermore , the regression methods are sensitive also to outlier points . we find that the bces method is much more sensitive to the inclusion or exclusion of the two lower - luminosity points ( ngc3227 and ngc4051 ) compared to fitexy .    in its present implementation",

    "this result is consistent with the one we obtain in our analysis ( table  [ results ] ) .",
    "a theoretical slope for the relation between the blr size and the luminosity , predicted by various early papers , is 0.5 .",
    "this is based on the assumption that , on average , all agns have the same ionization parameter , blr density , column density , and ionizing spectral energy distribution ( sed ) .",
    "a slope of 0.5 is also expected if the blr size is determined by the dust sublimation radius ( netzer & laor 1993 ) .",
    "however , several studies have indicated that the sed is luminosity dependent , and thus at least part of the assumptions above are not justified ( e.g. , mushotzky & wandel 1989 ; zheng & malkan 1993 ; puchnarewicz et al .",
    "1996 ) . here",
    "we use the _ observed relations _ of the blr size with the different luminosity bands to study which band influences the blr size the most .",
    "use of the h@xmath4 and @xmath496(5100 ) luminosities in the blr - size  luminosity relation yields similar slopes of about 0.69 . the slope with the uv luminosity [ both @xmath585(1450 ) and @xmath496(1350 ) ] is lower by about 0.1 than the slopes using the optical bands ( this is manifested both in the fitexy method and the bces method ) .",
    "the uv - based slope is the closest to the theoretical expectation of 0.5 based on the assumptions mentioned above .",
    "the uv band ( i.e. , 12003000  ) is close in wavelength to the ionizing continuum which has a large effect on the responding blr gas .",
    "however , the uv luminosities are based on measurements that are generally not simultaneous with the reverberation measurements , and sometimes greatly separated in time .",
    "the luminosity in the optical band ( i.e. , 40008000  ) might suffer from systematics which skew the blr - size  luminosity relation .",
    "these systematics may be the stellar contribution to the optical luminosity of the seyfert galaxies ( which was not taken into account in this work ) , or a change of the agn sed with luminosity , which translates to different slopes in the blr - size  luminosity relation .",
    "the change in sed is suggested by the fact that brighter agns have flatter optical - uv continua , ranging from an average slope ( @xmath4 in @xmath586 ) of about @xmath587 for seyferts , to about @xmath588 for quasars ( e.g. , neugebauer et al .",
    "1989 ; schmidt & green 1983 ; francis et al . 1991 ) .",
    "this means that quasars have a larger uv / optical flux ratio than seyferts ( a quasar which is 10 times more luminous than a seyfert in the optical band will be more luminous than the same seyfert by a larger factor in the uv band ) .",
    "thus , when using uv , rather than optical luminosities , the ratio of luminosities between quasars and seyferts grows and the slope of the blr size versus luminosity relation becomes shallower as indicated by table  [ results ] .    nonetheless , as already discussed and as we see below , potentially better indicators of the ionizing continuum , such as the h@xmath4 luminosity , seem to contradict the finding that 0.5 is the `` correct '' slope . for comparison",
    "we plot in figure  [ ext5100 ] , showing the relation between mean blr size and optical luminosity , a fitexy fit to 33 data points with a slope fixed to 0.5 . a line with a slope .",
    "the best fit @xmath589 parameter ( see equation  [ eqfit ] ) is 2.23 .",
    "we note in passing , that for individual agns the ratio of the uv luminosity to the optical luminosity is observed to increase as the object becomes brighter ( e.g. , peterson et al .",
    "2002 ; gilbert & peterson 2003 ) .",
    "this can affect the blr - size  luminosity relation for those agn with multiple data sets .",
    "a possible prediction would be that the flattest slopes might result from blr - size  luminosity relations that were derived from the case when including all individual data sets , rather than using the average for each agn .",
    "simple arguments based on recombination theory suggest that , in low - density low - optical depth gas the h@xmath4 emission - line luminosity is a good indicator of the ionizing continuum luminosity as the line luminosity is driven by this continuum .",
    "the physical conditions in the blr are , however , known to be more complex ( netzer 1990 and references therein ) yet we expect a general linear dependence between the ionizing flux and the h@xmath4 luminosity . the slope of the blr - size  h@xmath4 luminosity relation found here is almost identical to the slope found using @xmath496(5100 ) .",
    "this is in accord with studies that show the balmer - line luminosity scales as the optical luminosity between different agns ( e.g. , yee 1980 ; shuder 1981 ) .",
    "however the blr - size  h@xmath4 luminosity relation does not agree with the slope obtained using the uv continuum .",
    "this seems to suggest that the @xmath590 continuum is not the best indicator of the ionizing continuum or , perhaps , that our understanding of the blr physics is incomplete , i.e. , that the h@xmath4 line luminosity may not depend linearly on the ionizing continuum due to optical depth and/or collisional de - excitation effects in hydrogen lines .",
    "it has also been argued that a major line driver , and a possible blr - size regulator , is the very high energy ( x - ray ) continuum .",
    "we do not favor this explanation because the fractional energy in this continuum is small compared with other wavelength bands .",
    "this is all supplemented by the fact that the observed line response reflects changes in ionization over a large volume and is geometry dependent in a way that obscures the local , immediate line response to continuum variations .",
    "for example ,",
    "the covering factor and mean gas density of the blr gas might decrease with distance from the central ionizing source ( e.g. , kaspi & netzer 1999 ) , and the non - linear response in the inner blr thus might contribute more than the response from the outer parts .",
    "evidently , the blr - size ",
    "luminosity relationship is rather complicated and depends on several factors .",
    "the blr size versus x - ray luminosity relation shows a large scatter ( 5060% ) , though a general trend can be found .",
    "the two regression methods give somewhat different results for the slope .",
    "we are not able to explain the reason for this difference though it is likely that it is caused due to the large scatter and the way each method utilize the data .",
    "the slope of the best fit relation is similar in the fitexy method to the slope from using the optical luminosity but in the bces method it is steeper by about 0.10.2 ( the best fit slope is of order @xmath591 ) .",
    "agns are known to have large variability amplitudes in the x - ray band . for most objects in our sample",
    "the x - ray fluxes were determined based on one observation of the object which could well be away from its average flux state .",
    "furthermore , different objects in the sample were observed with different instruments and telescopes having different effective bandpasses , thus enlarging further the scatter between the objects . for most objects ,",
    "the x - ray luminosity measurement is not contemporaneous with the time lag measurement ( also during a monitoring campaign of months and years the x - ray luminosity could change over a large range ) and this can add to the scatter in the relation .",
    "nevertheless , the larger slope for the x - ray luminosity may be real , since it is in accordance with the recent result that @xmath592 in agns ( a measure for the flux ratios between the x - ray and optical bands ) anticorrelates with the luminosity ( e.g. , vignali et al . 2003 ) .",
    "this implies that when the optical luminosity increases the x - ray luminosity increases by a smaller factor , and this can explain the larger slope we see in the relation of the blr size with the x - ray luminosity .",
    "peterson et al . ( 2004 ) recently compiled and analyzed in a uniform and self - consistent way the blr size from all available agn reverberation mapping data obtained over the past 15 years . in this paper , we correlate the blr size with the luminosity @xmath478 , in the x - ray , uv , and optical bands .",
    "we investigate the correlation with two different regression methods as well as using multiple data sets for individual objects versus only one averaged data set for each object . though small systematic differences exist between the different methods of analysis , the results are generally consistent . assuming a power - law relation @xmath0@xmath1",
    ", we find the mean best - fitting @xmath2 is about @xmath3 for the optical continuum and the broad h@xmath4 luminosity , about @xmath5 for the uv continuum luminosity , and about @xmath6 for the x - ray luminosity .",
    "these slopes are a simple average of the slopes found from the different methods using mean balmer - lines time lags and the uncertainties represent the standard deviations of the different results .",
    "we note that for the x - ray luminosity the two methods give somewhat different slopes .",
    "the detailed results for each method are given in table  [ results ] and the preferred choice of slope and normalization should depend on the application it is used for .",
    "simply averaging the measurements obtained from the bces and fitexy methods for the relation between the blr size and the optical luminosity at 5100  , using one data point per object ( sixth line of table  [ results ] ) , we find : @xmath593 when using all individual measurements for each object ( fifth line of table  [ results ] ) the mean slope for the two methods is @xmath594 and the mean normalization is @xmath595 .",
    "we also find that the fits indicate an intrinsic scatter of @xmath596% in these relations .",
    "this is the first time this intrinsic scatter has been quantified .",
    "our results reflect on the naive theoretical predicted slope for the relation between the blr size and the luminosity of @xmath597 which is based on the assumption that all agns have the same ionization parameter , blr density , column density , and ionizing spectral energy distribution ( sed ) . the fact that for most energy bands the slope is different from @xmath597 indicates that at least for some of these characteristics the simple assumption is not valid and they probably show an evolution along the luminosity scale .",
