    "<S> 1 ) . the temporally periodic spatial structure seen shows the unusual occurence of long range spatial correlations . </S>",
    "<S> this phenomenon can be seen in the vicinity of the tangent - period doubling bifurcation whereas all the other bifurcations result in spatio - temporal intermittency . </S>",

    "<S> we show the spatial intermittency present in the vicinity of this point in fig 1(a ) . </S>",
    "<S> the size of lattice chosen was @xmath42 and it was iterated for @xmath43 iterations after discarding @xmath44 transients . </S>",
    "<S> the ordinate is the value of x at the @xmath10th site and abscissa is the site label . </S>",
    "<S> the lattice is plotted at a fixed time . in fig.1(b ) we plot the time evolution of the lattice which shows stable period two oscillations . </S>",
    "<S> thus the intermittency is purely spatial in nature and temporally we have stable periodic behaviour . </S>",
    "<S> the temporally periodic spatial structure seen shows the unusual occurrence of long range spatial correl ations . </S>",
    "<S> this can be seen in the distribution of laminar lengths which we will discuss shortly .    </S>",
    "<S> another tool that can give some insight into the intermittency for this tangent - period - doubling case is the spatial return map plotted in figure 3 . before the bifurcation </S>",
    "<S> , the return map shows only a single point corresponding to the synchronised fixed point solution . after the bifurcation a loop is seen . </S>",
    "<S> this is because intermediate values between the two period doubled points are also possible now . </S>",
    "<S> this loop acts as a relaminarisation mechanism and gives rise to intermittency . </S>",
    "<S> the region in which the intermittency occurs in inhomogeneous lattices is considerably bigger than that seen for homogeneous lattices . </S>",
    "<S> this is because the lattice is no longer symmetric under the `` flip '' . </S>",
    "<S> thus the periodic solutions which were stable for homogeneous lattices bifurcate and give rise to intermittency .    </S>",
    "<S> each type of bifurcation gives rise to intermittency of a distinct type as typified by the distribution of laminar lengths . </S>",
    "<S> the distribution of laminar lengths shows power law behaviour , and the tangent , the period - doubling and the hopf bifurcation are associated with their own distinct power laws . </S>",
    "<S> the distributions for the tangent - hopf and tangent - period - doubling bifurcations scale with the power - laws associated with the hopf and period - doubling bifurcations respectively . </S>",
    "<S> these power - laws are seen in the vicinity of the co - dimension two points listed in table i and also in the neighbourhood of the lines which correspond to the tangent bifurcations . the question of whether spatio - temporal intermittency persists beyond these regions and whether the distribution of laminar lengths in the spatio - temporally intermittent regime crosses over from power - law behaviour to exponential behaviour is presently under investigation .    to distinguish between various kinds of intermittency </S>",
    "<S> , we calculate the distribution of laminar lengths . </S>",
    "<S> the length of the laminar bursts , i.e. the number of consecutive sites which follow periodic behaviour before being interrupted by chaotic bursts is calculated . </S>",
    "<S> the distribution for this length shows a power law behaviour with @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> this shows the presence of long - range spatial correlations in the lattice . </S>",
    "<S> the power law exponent characterises the type of intermittency . </S>",
    "<S> the distribution of laminar lengths for three kinds of intermittency is shown in fig.2 . </S>",
    "<S> the exponent @xmath46 is associated with the tangent bifurcation , the exponent @xmath47 with the tangent - period - doubling bifurcation and period - doubling ( sub - critical ) and the exponent @xmath48 with tangent - hopf and the double hopf bifurcations . </S>",
    "<S> such power - laws have been observed in various experimental studies of spatio - temporal intermittency @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the values of the power - laws are listed in table i. it is interesting to note that the values seen by us are in reasonable agreement with the power - laws seen in several experiments which involve quasi - one dimensional geometries@xcite , @xcite , @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the exponent @xmath49 which takes values between @xmath50 $ ] for our system , is in good agreement with the laminar exponent seen in the case of rayleigh - benard convection in an annulus @xcite , whereas the exponent @xmath51 which takes the values in the range @xmath52 $ ] agrees well with the laminar exponent seen in the case of the roll coating system @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the exponent @xmath53 which takes values in the range @xmath54 $ ] and which is seen in the case of the periodic structure with long range spatial correlations is a lower bound on the laminar exponents seen in the case of the rayleigh - benard convection seen in a channel and in the taylor dean system where spatio - temporal intermittency is seen @xcite , @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our numerical studies show that this is due to the fact that the temporally periodic structure with long - range spatial correlations undergoes a further bifurcation to spatio - temporal intermittency in the neighbourhood of @xmath55 for bifurcations from the synchronised fixed point @xmath56 . </S>",
    "<S> the distribution of laminar lengths in this region shows power - law behaviour with an exponent @xmath57 which is in very good agreement with the laminar exponents observed for convection in a channel and for the taylor - dean system . </S>",
    "<S> this bifurcation does not appear to be local in nature . </S>",
    "<S> details of this bifurcation are being explored further .    </S>",
    "<S> all the results above are obtained for bifurcations from the synchronised fixed points for a lattice where the map parameter takes two distinct values one at each alternate site . </S>",
    "<S> these results can be easily generalised to higher spatial and temporal periods and to lattices where the inhomogeneity has different periodicities . </S>",
    "<S> bifurcations from higher spatial temporal periods can also give rise to spatio - temporal or spatial / temporal intermittency in many additional regions of parameter space . </S>",
    "<S> the question of whether the spatio - temporal intermittency with or without the accompanying power - laws for the distribution of laminar lengths persists in other regions of parameter space is being investigated further@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> thus we have shown that both spatial and spatio - temporal intermittency can arise in a inhomogeneous coupled map lattice . </S>",
    "<S> the phenomenon of intermittency is more widespread in inhomogeneous lattices than in the case of ordered lattices . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of pure spatial intermittency accompanied by temporally periodic behaviour is an interesting feature which arises in the case of the inhomogeneous system . </S>",
    "<S> the intermittency arises as a result of bifurcations of co - dimension 2 . </S>",
    "<S> such bifurcations are also of interest in the case of other spatially extended systems @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the distributions of laminar lengths exhibit three distinct kinds of power laws , each associated with a distinct kind of bifurcation . </S>",
    "<S> the structure associated with the tangent - period - doubling bifurcation undergoes a further bifurcation associated with an additional power - law . </S>",
    "<S> the values obtained for these power - laws are in reasonable and intriguing agreement with those observed in a variety of experiments involving quasi - one dimensional geometries . </S>",
    "<S> we hence hope our analysis will be useful for the understanding of intermittent phenomena arising in other spatially extended systems , and in discussions of their genericity and universality .    </S>",
