    "much experimental effort is being expended in the study of @xmath0 meson decays @xcite and the next decade will see intensive investigation of the @xmath0-meson system at the tevatron , the slac and kek @xmath0-factories , and at the lhc .",
    "the aim is to establish the cabbibo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) parameters to an accuracy that will test the consistency of the standard model ( sm ) description of cp asymmetry , hopefully to a precision comparable to that of other aspects of the standard model . @xmath0",
    "meson decays should have many channels which exhibit cp asymmetry but even with precise data there will be a problem of reliably unravelling the underlying weak decay mechanisms from the distortions caused by the strong interactions .",
    "hard qcd corrections to the underlying @xmath5 quark weak decay amplitudes involve gluon virtualities between the electroweak scale @xmath6 and the scale @xmath7 and are implemented through renormalization of the calculable short distance wilson coefficients @xmath8 in the low energy effective weak hamiltonian@xcite for @xmath9 decays at scale @xmath10 @xmath11    -\\lambda_{t } \\sum_{i=3 , \\ldots , 6}\\;c_{i}(\\mu ) o_{i } \\right\\ }      + { \\rm other\\ ; terms}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is a product of ckm matrix elements , @xmath13 and the local @xmath9 four - quark operators are @xmath14 where @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are colour indices , and we have used the notation , for example , @xmath18    [ \\bar{q}^{\\prime}_{\\beta}\\gamma^{\\mu}(1 \\mp \\gamma_{5})q^{\\prime}_{\\beta}].\\ ] ] the operators in ( [ fact2 ] ) are associated with particular processes ( see @xcite for a detailed discussion ) : @xmath19 are the tree current - current operators and @xmath20 are qcd penguin operators .",
    "the  other terms \" indicated in ( [ fact1 ] ) are small in the sm .",
    "they include magnetic dipole transition operators and electroweak penguin operators .",
    "the most important of these is the electroweak penguin operator @xmath21 where @xmath22 for @xmath23 -type quarks .",
    "the wilson coefficient @xmath24 is larger than the qcd penguin coefficients @xmath25 and @xmath26 and contributes @xmath27 to @xmath28 .",
    "inclusion of strong interaction effects below the scale @xmath29 is a very difficult task involving , for the two - body hadronic decay @xmath30 , the computation of the matrix elements @xmath31 . until recently ,",
    "most theoretical studies of two - body hadronic decay invoked the factorization approximation @xcite in which final state interactions are neglected and @xmath31 is expressed as a product of two hadronic currents : @xmath32 .",
    "the operators @xmath33 and @xmath34 are fierz transformed into a combination of colour singlet - singlet and octet - octet terms and the octet - octet terms then discarded .",
    "the singlet - singlet current matrix elements are then expressed in terms of known decay rates and form factors .",
    "consequently , the hadronic matrix elements are expressed in terms of the combinations @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 is the number of colours .    in the",
    "widely used so - called ",
    "generalized factorization \" approach @xcite , the renormalization scale dependence of the hadronic matrix elements @xmath31 , lost through factorization , is compensated for through the introduction of effective wilson coefficients @xmath38 such that @xmath39 the effective wilson coefficients @xmath40 for the qcd penguins depend upon the gluon momentum @xmath41 and generate strong phases as @xmath41 crosses the @xmath42 and @xmath43 thresholds @xcite .",
    "the neglected octet - octet terms are compensated for by replacing @xmath44 by a universal free parameter @xmath45 .",
    "the assumed universal @xmath46 parameters are then determined by fitting to as much data as possible .",
    "some authors @xcite have allowed the @xmath45 parameter for the @xmath47 and @xmath48 contributions to be different .",
    "recently there has been significant progress in the theoretical understanding of hadronic decay amplitudes in the heavy quark limit @xcite .",
    "these approaches , known as qcd ( improved ) factorization , exploit the fact that @xmath49 is much greater than the qcd scale @xmath50 and show that the hadronic matrix elements have the form @xmath51\\ ] ] provided the spectator quark does not go to a heavy meson .",
    "if the power corrections in @xmath50 and radiative corrections in @xmath1 are neglected , conventional or ",
    "naive \" factorization is recovered .",
    "although naive factorization is broken at higher order in @xmath1 , these non - factorizable contributions can be calculated systematically .    for @xmath52 in which both @xmath53 and @xmath54 are light , and",
    "@xmath54 is the meson that does not pick up the spectator quark , @xcite find that all non - factorizable contributions are real and dominated by hard gluon exchange which can be calculated perturbatively , and all leading order non - perturbative soft and collinear effects are confined to the @xmath55 system and can be absorbed into form factors and light cone distribution amplitudes .",
    "strong rescattering phases are either perturbative or power suppressed in @xmath49 and , at leading order , arise via the bander - silverman - soni mechanism @xcite from the imaginary parts of the hard scattering kernels in @xmath56 .",
    "the contribution from the annihilation diagram ( in which the spectator quark annihilates with one of the @xmath5 decay quarks ) is found to be power suppressed .",
    "in contrast to one of the basic assumptions of generalized factorization , the corrections to naive factorization are process dependent and have a richer structure than merely allowing @xmath45 to be different for the @xmath57 and @xmath58 contributions .",
    "similar in many ways to qcd factorization is the hard scattering or perturbative qcd approach @xcite .",
    "however , here it is argued that all soft contributions to the @xmath55 form factor are negligible if transverse momentum with sudakov resummation is included , so that the form factors can be perturbatively calculated .",
    "also , it is argued that sudakov suppression of long distance effects in the @xmath0 meson is needed to control higher order effects in the beneke _",
    "et al _ @xcite approach .",
    "non - factorizable contributions are now found to be complex but the imaginary parts are much smaller than that of the ( factorizable ) contribution from the annihilation diagram .",
    "several aspects of the perturbative qcd approach have been strongly criticized @xcite .    in summary ,",
    "recent theoretical investigations have provided justification , at least to order @xmath1 , for invoking factorization to evaluate the hadronic matrix elements @xmath59 provided the decay meson containing the spectator quark is not heavy .",
    "unfortunately , the numerical results from the qcd factorization calculations are quite sensitive to the input assumptions on the quark distribution functions @xcite , and the contributions from the logarithmic end point divergences in hard spectator scatterings and weak annihilation @xcite , thus giving rise to significant theoretical uncertainties which currently limit their usefulness .",
    "the success claimed @xcite for qcd improved factorization in fitting the observed branching ratios for @xmath60 and @xmath61 has been queried by ciuchini _",
    "et al _ @xcite who argue that , with the ckm angle @xmath62 constrained by the unitarity triangle analysis of @xcite , non - perturbative @xmath63 corrections , so called  charming penguins \" , are important where the factorized amplitudes are either colour or cabbibo suppressed .",
    "factorization at leading order in @xmath63 can not reproduce the observed @xmath64 and @xmath61 decays and must be supplemented with enhanced @xmath65-loop penguin diagrams .",
    "in this paper we present formulae based on the factorization ansatz for @xmath0 decay into the lowest mass pseudoscalar and vector mesons .",
    "we focus on the heavy meson limit in which combinations of the different parameters that characterize the current matrix elements reduce to just one .",
    "this is a consistent approach within the heavy quark approximation and we believe that the resulting more simple formulae will provide an adequate and more transparent tool with which to confront data for some time to come .",
    "finally we confront these formulae with data on nineteen channels . with @xmath4 as measured by the babar @xcite and belle collaborations @xcite we find a plausible set of soft qcd parameters that , apart from three pseudoscalar vector channels , fit the data well .",
    "the amplitude for charmless hadronic @xmath5 decays for all these factorization schemes can be written as @xmath66\\ ] ] where @xmath67 with @xmath68 and @xmath69 the form of the matrix element @xmath70 is a consequence of a fierz transformation on the @xmath48 term .",
    "an example of a process in which @xmath53 ( and @xmath54 ) can attach itself to either current is for @xmath71 where the matrix element for @xmath72 will have contributions from both terms .",
    "the matrix elements in @xmath70 can be estimated from the matrix elements of the electroweak currents by taking the quarks , at some appropriate mass scale , to be on mass shell .",
    "for the current @xmath73 this yields @xmath74 forming matrix elements of ( [ fact11 ] ) between scalar , pseudoscalar and vector states as appropriate , one of the terms on the right hand side will be identically zero and the other will then be determined by the matrix element of the left hand side .",
    "the @xmath46 coefficients in ( [ fact7 ] ) have the form @xmath75 where the leading order ( lo ) @xmath76 are given by the naive factorization expressions ( [ fact4 ] ) with the wilson coefficients @xmath8 taken at next to leading order ( nlo ) .",
    "detailed expressions for the @xmath77 are given in @xcite for @xmath78 , in @xcite for @xmath79 and in @xcite for @xmath80 , where @xmath81 and @xmath82 denote light pseudoscalar and vector mesons respectively .",
    "note that @xcite claim there are errors in the expressions given by @xcite for @xmath78 .",
    "the beauty of the result ( [ fact12 ] ) is that the difference between the decay rate formulae of naive and generalized factorization as presented in numerous works @xcite and that based upon qcd factorization lies only in the coefficients @xmath46 , the factorization matrix elements @xmath83 are common to all these approaches .",
    "also , if the soft gluon physics is all accounted for in the current matrix elements then , in the heavy quark limit , @xmath44 should be taken to be three .",
    "the corrections to the coefficients @xmath46 so far presented are to first order in @xmath1 .",
    "an encouraging feature is that they are not generally large , which leads one to hope that the precision with which the sm can be tested will be determined by the proximity of the @xmath5 quark mass to the heavy quark limit and the precision of our knowledge of the soft qcd parameters , @xmath0 meson semileptonic transition form factors and meson light cone distribution amplitudes .",
    "an example of the differences in the @xmath46 coefficients for several theoretical approaches is shown in table 1 .",
    "here we compare the @xmath46 coefficients for qcd factorization , generalized factorization and a simple tree plus penguin model at scale @xmath6 . in this simple model , for example , the process @xmath84 produces a @xmath85 pair in a colour octet state so that they do not materialize in a @xmath85 meson ; the @xmath86 must pair with the @xmath87 quark and the @xmath88 quark with the spectator antiquark so that @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "we have estimated these coefficients by assuming a quark parton distribution function @xmath91 in both @xmath53 and @xmath54 and that , for a given @xmath92 and @xmath93 , the @xmath94 pair has , neglecting quark masses , an invariant mass squared @xmath95 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath96 was then calculated by integrating the penguin amplitude given in @xcite .",
    "all estimates of the penguin amplitudes and the associated @xmath46 coefficients are uncertain ; they involve the strong coupling @xmath1 over a distribution in @xmath41 , models of quarks in hadrons and soft qcd parameters , some of which are only poorly known . because of these uncertainties , to be confident of any conclusions drawn about the sm it will be important to have a consistent picture of as many channels of charmless @xmath0 decay as possible .",
    "the factorization matrix elements @xmath83 in ( [ fact8 ] ) involve products of current matrix elements which are evaluated through the introduction of numerous soft qcd parameters such as meson decay constants and transition form factors .",
    "explicit expressions given in the literature @xcite for @xmath78 , @xmath97 and @xmath80 decay amplitudes in the factorization approximation are extremely cumbersome and , consequently , are unlikely in the short term to be of great assistance to experimentalists in analyzing their limited data sets .",
    "we argue that the expressions for these factorized decay amplitudes can be simplified , albeit at some loss of accuracy , such that a wide range of decays can be expressed in terms of a relatively small number of soft qcd parameters which are , or will be , relatively well known .",
    "our approximations consist of ( 1 ) neglect of terms @xmath98 in the decay amplitudes and rates and ( 2 ) use of universal generalized - factorization model @xmath46 coefficients rather than the ( slightly ) process - dependent qcd - factorization model @xmath46 coefficients .",
    "the effect of this latter approximation is considered in section 5 for decays involving @xmath99 and @xmath100 mesons for which the qcd factorization @xmath46 coefficients are well established .",
    "the loss of accuracy incurred in our approach should not be significant until more precise data is available .",
    "our expressions are formally exact in the heavy quark limit .    the @xmath99 and @xmath100 meson decay constants are defined through the matrix elements @xmath101 with similar relations for the @xmath100 meson .",

    "by contrast , for the vector mesons @xmath108 , @xmath109 , @xmath110 and @xmath111 , the axial vector matrix elements are zero .",
    "the vector meson decay constants are defined by @xmath112 where @xmath113 is the meson polarization vector .",
    "isospin symmetry determines the other matrix elements , for example @xmath114 the magnitudes of some vector decay constants can be inferred from measurements of @xmath115 lepton decay , for example @xmath116^{2 } \\left[1",

    "we now consider the @xmath0 transition form factors . for pseudoscalar mesons ,",
    "these are usually expressed in terms of two form factors @xmath123 and @xmath124 : @xmath125   f_{1}(t )     + \\frac{(m_{b}^{2}-m_{p}^{2})}{t } q^{\\mu}\\ ; f_{0}(t).\\ ] ] here @xmath126 and @xmath127 .",

    "for example , from lattice qcd , @xmath134 with @xmath135 .",
    "a virtue of the rather clumsy parameterization in ( [ fact20 ] ) is that when a contraction is taken with the matrix element for the second decay meson then only @xmath128 contributes if the second meson is also a pseudoscalar and only @xmath129 contributes if the second meson is a vector .",

    "the use of two parameters is not consistent with the heavy quark limit .",
    "the magnitudes of some form factors are measurable in principle through semileptonic decays such as @xmath147 , corresponding to @xmath148 , for which , neglecting terms proportional to the lepton mass , @xmath149 at large values of @xmath130 where the pion is moving slowly . various phenomenological forms , such as ( [ fact21 ] ) which interpolate quite well through the calculated values , are then used to extrapolate to the small @xmath130 region .",

    "contraction of the transition matrix element ( [ fact29 ] ) with that for a pseudoscalar factorization partner gives @xmath178 here @xmath179 indicates that the vector meson must have zero helicity . for a vector factorization partner",

    "the @xmath273 channel has its largest theoretical contribution from the @xmath274 penguin and , in particular , from the @xmath275 and @xmath190 terms .",
    "the theoretical branching ratio is small because of the cancellation , evident in tables 1 and 6 , between these terms .",
    "it is difficult for the theory to explain a branching ratio greater than @xmath276 .",
    "the @xmath271 channel is well measured , belle gives a large branching ratio consistent with the babar result @xmath277 shown in table 8 , whereas the cleo value is lower .",
    "it is interesting to compare this channel with @xmath278 , also well measured and with only a marginally larger branching ratio .",
