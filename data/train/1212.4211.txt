    "qbop is closely related to the _ balanced optimization problem _ introduced by martello et al  @xcite . to emphasize the difference between the balanced optimization problem of  @xcite and qbop , we call the former a _ linear balanced optimization problem _ ( lbop ) . special cases of lbop were studied by many authors  @xcite .",
    "optimization problems with objective functions similar to that of lbop have been studied by zeitln  @xcite for resource allocation , by gupta and sen  @xcite , liao and huang  @xcite , and tegez and vlach  @xcite for machine scheduling , by ahuja  @xcite for linear programming , by scutell  @xcite for network flows , and by liang et al .",

    "to the best of our knowledge , qbop has not been studied in literature so far .",
    "most of the applications of lbop discussed in literature translate into applications of qbop by interpreting @xmath5 as the pairwise interaction weight of elements @xmath10 and @xmath11 in @xmath2 . to illustrate this ,",
    "let us consider the following variation of the travel agency example of martello et al .",
    "a north american travel agency is planning to prepare a european tour package .",
    "its clients travel from new york to london by a chartered flight .",
    "the clients have the option to choose a maximum of two tourist locations from an available set @xmath12 of locations . if a client chooses locations @xmath10 and @xmath11 , then @xmath5 is the total tour time .",
    "there are @xmath13 potential locations and the company wishes to choose @xmath14 locations to be included in the package so that the duration of tours for any pair of locations is approximately the same .",
    "this way , one can avoid waiting time of clients in london , after their tour and the whole group can return by the same chartered flight .",
    "the objective of the tour company can be represented as minimizing @xmath15 while satisfying appropriate constraints .",
    "other applications of the model include balanced portfolio selection for managing investment accounts where risk estimates on pairs of investment opportunities are to be considered because of hedging positions and participant selection for psychological experiments where it is important that all the people in the group equally know each other .",
    "the objective function of qbop can be viewed as range of a covariance matrix @xmath16 associated with a combinatorial optimization problem . in this case ,",
    "bqop attempts to minimize a dispersion measure .",
    "minimization of various measures of dispersion such as variance , absolute deviation from the mean etc .  has been studied in the context of combinatorial optimization problems  @xcite . however ,",
    "none of these studies take into consideration information from the covariance matrix which measures impact of pairwise interaction .",
    "this interpretation leads to other potential applications of our model .",
    "in this paper we study qbop and propose several general purpose algorithms .",
    "the polynomial solvability of these algorithms are closely related to that of an associated feasibility problem .",
    "qbop is observed to be np - hard even if the family @xmath1 of feasible solutions has very simple structure .",
    "we also investigate qbop when the cost matrix @xmath16 has a decomposable structure , i.e. , @xmath17 or @xmath18 . in each of these special cases ,",
    "we show that qbop can be solved in polynomial time whenever the corresponding lbop can be solved in polynomial time . as a consequence",
    ", we have @xmath19 and @xmath20 algorithms for qbop when @xmath1 is chosen as spanning trees of a graph on @xmath13 nodes and @xmath3 edges or perfect matchings on a @xmath21 , respectively .",
    "our general purpose exact algorithms can be modified into heuristic algorithms .",
    "some sufficient conditions are derived to speed up these algorithms and their effect is analyzed using extensive experimentation in the context of quadratic balanced knapsack problems .",
    "we also compared the heuristic solutions with exact solutions and the results establish the efficiency of our heuristic algorithms .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we discuss the complexity of the problem and introduce notations and definitions .",
    "section 3 deals with exact and heuristic algorithms . in section 4",
    "we present our polynomially solvable special cases . in section 5",
    "we discuss the special case of the quadratic balanced knapsack problem .",
    "experimental results are presented in section 6 . in section 7 , a generalization qbop where interaction between @xmath22-elements are considered instead of two elements as in the case of qbop .",
    "concluding remarks are presented in section 8 .",
    "without loss of generality , we assume that @xmath23 for otherwise we can add a large constant to all @xmath5 values to get an equivalent problem with non - negative cost values . it may be noted that when @xmath23 for all @xmath4 and @xmath24 for @xmath25 , qbop reduces to the _ quadratic bottleneck problem _ ( qbp )  @xcite .",

    "but we need to take care the constraints in bp(@xmath241 ) associated with the feasibility routine embedded within the threshold algorithm and this can be achieved by solving a minsum problem of the type    minimize & @xmath246 +   subject to & @xmath171 +    the value of @xmath96 in msp depends on @xmath247 and the threshold value used for the feasibility test .",
    "we omit the details of the selection of @xmath96 values which can easily be constructed by an interested reader .",
    "thus if msp can be solved in @xmath248 time , then qbop(@xmath216 ) can be solved in @xmath249 time .",
    "let us now consider a specific case of qbop called the _ quadratic balanced knapsack problem _ ( qbalkp ) which can be defined as follows : @xmath250 by choosing @xmath251 such that @xmath8 implies @xmath252 we can see that qbalkp is an instance qbop . the compact representation of @xmath1 is given by the constraints ( [ k1 ] ) and ( [ k2 ] ) .",
    "qbalkp can be used to model the travel agency example and portfolio selection examples discussed in section 1 . since the quadratic bottleneck knapsack problem ( qbotkp )  @xcite is a special case of qbalkp and qbotkp is strongly np - hard , qbalkp is also strongly np - hard .",
    "( note that the lbop version of qbalkp is solvable in polynomial time . )",
    "qbalkp can be formulated as a mixed integer program :    minimize & @xmath253 +   subject to & @xmath254 +   & @xmath255 +   & @xmath256 +   & @xmath257 +   & @xmath258 +   & @xmath259 +   & @xmath260 +   & @xmath261 +    where @xmath262 . solving the mixed integer programming formulation given above becomes difficult as the problem size increases .",
    "however , we can use the general purpose algorithms developed in the previous section to solve qbalkp . to use the algorithms ib1 , ib2 , and db",
    ", we can make use of the algorithm of zhang and punnen  @xcite as the qbp1 ( qbp2 ) solver .",
    "to apply the bdt and tdt algorithms , we need an algorithm to solve the corresponding quadratic feasibility problem . recall that the _ quadratic feasibility problem _ is : `` given two real numbers @xmath33 and @xmath34 , where @xmath35 , test if @xmath38 and produce an @xmath39 whenever @xmath38 . ''    in section 2 , we indicated that a quadratic feasibility problem can be solved as a combinatorial optimization problem with conflict pair constraints  @xcite .",
    "we now observe that the quadratic feasibility problem for qbkp can be solved by solving the maximum weight independent set problem ( mwip ) on a graph with node set @xmath2 and edge set @xmath263 .",
    "an integer programming representation of this mwip is given below .",
    "maximize & @xmath264 +   subject to & @xmath265 +   & @xmath266 +    let @xmath267 be an optimal solution to the mwip and @xmath268 be its optimal objective function value",
    ". then @xmath38 if and only if @xmath269 .",
    "thus , we can use an mwip solver to implement the algorithms discussed in the previous section for the special case of qbalkp .",
    "the solution of the quadratic feasibility problem discussed above is closely related to the quadratic feasibility problem studied by zhang and punnen  @xcite for the quadratic bottleneck knapsack problem with appropriate differences to handle the qbalkp objective .",
    "in this section we report results of extensive experimental analysis conducted on randomly generated qbalkp instances .",
    "the objective of the experiments is to assess the relative performance of various algorithms developed in section 3 .",
    "we have implemented exact and heuristic versions of these algorithms and compared the outcomes in terms of solution quality and computational time .",
    "our experiments also examined the effectiveness of the conditions provided by theorems [ tth1 ] , [ tth2 ] , [ th3 ] , and [ th4 ] for early detection of optimality and rapid advancement through the search intervals .",
    "all the experiments were conducted on an intel  i7 - 2600 cpu based pc .",
    "the algorithms are implemented in c # , and cplex  12.4 was used to solve the mixed integer programming problems within our implementations .",
    "x86 - 64 instruction set was used and concurrency was not allowed in our the algorithms as well as in cplex .",
    "all the algorithms discussed in this paper ( except the mip formulation of qbalkp ) require a feasibility test procedure and the dominating complexity of these algorithms in each iteration is that of this procedure . recall that a feasibility test answers the question if there exists a feasible solution to the qbalkp and , whenever the answer is ` yes ' , it generates such a solution . in section 5",
    "we observed that this can be achieved by solving a maximum weight independent set problem .",
    "we can also use other variations of this approach to test feasibility and the empirical behavior of different variations could be different . since the feasibility test is carried out several times in the algorithm , the effect of different variations of the feasibility tests could affect the the running time as well as solution quality ( for heuristic algorithms ) . for definiteness and simplicity ,",
    "we have restricted our implementation to three different feasibility test procedures which are summarized below :    1 .",
    "solve the maximum weight independent set problem as described in section  5 and then compare the objective value @xmath270 with @xmath271 . if @xmath272 , the resulting solution @xmath43 is a feasible solution to the qbalkp .",
    "otherwise the answer is ` no ' .",
    "we used cplex  12.4 to solve the resulting integer program .",
    "2 .   consider the maximum weight independent set problem as described in section  5 .",
    "choose the objective function coefficients to be zero and add the new constraint @xmath273 to the formulation .",
    "we used cplex  12.4 to solve the resulting constrained maximum weight independent set problem .",
    "the cplex solver stops as soon as a feasible solution is found . when using this feasibility test procedure ,",
    "we set the ` mip emphasis ' parameter of cplex to ` emphasize feasibility over optimality ' which in our experiments provided the best performance .",
    "3 .   solve the integer program defined in ft2 by providing a time limit for the mixed integer programming solver .",
    "note that if the solver fails to find a feasible solution in the allowed time limit , there is no guarantee that a feasible solution does not exist and , thus , using such a procedure in any of the algorithms turns an exact algorithm into a heuristic .",
    "because of this heuristic decision , the properties ( p1 ) and ( p2 ) may not hold precisely .",
    "nevertheless , we make a heuristic assumption that these properties hold and proceed accordingly .",
    "as indicated earlier , even for these special cases of feasibility tests , the solutions returned by these feasibility tests could be different and , thus , not only the execution time of each feasibility test but also the optimization process itself for a qbalkp algorithm may vary even for the exact feasibility tests ft1 and ft2 .",
    "we use the following notations to represent our algorithms under different parameter settings .",
    "mip stands for the mixed integer programming formulation of the qbalkp solved with cplex ( the parameters of cplex are default ) .",
    "bdt , ib and db denote the bdt , ib1 and db algorithms , respectively , where the effect of theorem  [ tth1 ] is suppressed . by default",
    ", we use feasibility test ft2 .",
    "if ` @xmath274 ' is added to the name of an algorithm ( such as bdt@xmath274 or ib@xmath274 ) , feasibility test ft1 is used .",
    "bdt@xmath275 and ib@xmath275 stand for the variations of bdt and ib , where early optimality detection is guaranteed by theorem  [ tth1 ] is enabled .",
    "bdt@xmath276 denotes the heuristic version of the bdt algorithm , where @xmath277 is the time limit prescribed for each feasibility test ( ft3 ) . ib@xmath276 and",
    "db@xmath276 denote the heuristic version of the corresponding algorithms , where @xmath277 is the time limit prescribed for each feasibility test ( ft3 ) within the qbp1 solving procedure .",
    "since this is the first time when the qbalkp is considered in the literature , we have developed a class of test instances for the problem .",
    "these test instances are random problems constructed as follows . for each test instance",
    ", we are given a triple @xmath278 , where @xmath279 is an integer , @xmath280 and @xmath281 .",
    "we first generate an @xmath282 matrix @xmath283 , where @xmath284 is a normally distributed random integer with mean @xmath285 and standard deviation @xmath286 as given",
    ". then the matrix @xmath7 is generated , where @xmath287 .",
    "this guarantees that @xmath23 .",
    "then , an @xmath3-vector @xmath288 , where @xmath289 a uniformly distributed random integer in the range @xmath290 , is generated .",
    "finally , @xmath271 is selected as a uniformly distributed random integer in the range @xmath291 . observe that @xmath292 = e[b]$ ] if @xmath293 such that @xmath294 , where @xmath295 $ ] is the expected value of @xmath42 .",
    "in other words , by varying the value of @xmath296 , one can control the number of non - zeros in an optimal solution to the qbalkp instance .",
    "it may be noted that the instances we generated are symmetric in the following sense ; replacing @xmath5 with @xmath297 would not , on average , change the properties of the matrix @xmath16 .",
    "hence , the algorithms ib1 and ib2 are expected to show similar average performance .",
    "thus , hereafter , we do not discuss the algorithm ib2 and denote ib1 as ib .",
    "likewise , bdt and tdt algorithms are expected to have similar average performance .",
    "thus , we do not consider the tdt algorithm in our experimental analysis and focus on the bdt algorithm .",
    "figure  [ fig : depend - s ] indicates relative performance of the bdt and ib algorithms as a function of the parameter @xmath296 .",
    "we set @xmath298 and @xmath299 in this experiment .",
    "it appears that the instance with either large or small values of @xmath296 are relatively easy to solve . for small values of @xmath296 , each feasibility test takes only a small amount of time since it is easy to find a feasible solution if @xmath271 is small . for large values of @xmath296 ,",
    "each feasibility test also takes a relatively small time since many such problems become infeasible .",
    "another interesting observation is that the number of iterations of the bdt algorithm almost does not depend on @xmath296 ( indeed , even if the problem is infeasible , the bdt algorithm will make @xmath300 iterations ) while it varies significantly for the ib algorithm making it significantly faster for certain class of instances .",
    "figure  [ fig : depend - sigma ] indicates the performance of the bdt and ib algorithms as a function of the parameter @xmath286 of the instance .",
    "the value of @xmath296 is set in this experiment to @xmath301 and @xmath298 .",
    "one can see that the random instances become harder with increase in the value of @xmath286 .",
    "indeed , a larger @xmath286 leads to a larger number @xmath300 of distinct weights @xmath5 which , in turn , increases the number of iterations of the algorithm .",
    "however , @xmath300 is limited by @xmath302 and , thus , it grows slower than @xmath286 .",
    "in fact , the number of iterations of the bdt algorithm is approximately proportional to @xmath300 . in contrast",
    ", the ib algorithm efficiently handles instances with large @xmath300 .",
    "recall that it needs only @xmath303 feasibility tests to solve each qbotkp subproblem  @xcite .",
    "hence , for instances with large @xmath300 , the ib algorithm appears preferable . also it follows from our experiments that the time needed for the feasibility test is almost independent on the value of @xmath286 .    based on these preliminary observations , we set @xmath301 and @xmath299 for the rest of the experiments to assure that the test problems generated are reasonably hard .",
    "let us first evaluate performance of the basic algorithms proposed in this paper . in table",
    "[ tab : basic ] , we report the results of our experiments with the bdt@xmath274 , bdt , ib@xmath274 , ib , db@xmath274 , db and mip algorithms .",
    "the notations used in various columns of the table are explained below :    * @xmath3 is the size of the test instance ; * ` obj ' is the objective value of the optimal solution to the problem ; * @xmath300 is the number of distinct @xmath5 values in matrix @xmath16 ; * @xmath304 ; * ` running time , sec ' columns report the running time of each of the algorithms ; * ` feasibility tests ' columns report the number of times feasibility tests are carried out within each of the algorithms .",
    "note that in ib , ib@xmath274 , db , and db@xmath274 algorithms , we are not explicitly solving feasibility problems .",
    "however , feasibility problems of similar nature are solved within the qbotkp solver that is used within these algorithms .",
    "thus , the number of feasibility tests include the feasibility tests carried out within the qbotkp solver used , which is a variation of the algorithm by zhang and punnen  @xcite .",
    "the last row of the table reports the average values for corresponding columns .",
    "however , it may be noted that the average running time can not be used to judge the algorithm s performance in general because the running times vary significantly from instance to instance .    the best result ( running time and number of tests ) for each instance is underlined .",
    "feasibility test ft2 provides a better performance than feasibility test ft1 in each case . indeed , according to table  [ tab : basic ] ,",
    "the optimality of a solution to the maximum weight independent set problem does not reduce the number of feasibility tests , while reaching the optimal solution clearly takes more time than finding a feasible solution .",
    "the ib algorithm clearly outperforms all other algorithms for each test instance with regards to both the number of feasibility tests and the running time .",
    "the mip algorithm turns out to be very slow for any practical instances .",
    "[ cols=\"<,>,>,>,^,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,^ , > , > , > , > , > , > \" , ]      in this section we report the results of our experiments that assess the effectiveness of theorem  [ tth1 ] for algorithms bdt and ib . in table",
    "[ tab : omega ] , we compare the results of the corresponding experiments .",
    "the ` @xmath60 ' column reports the objective value of the optimal solution to the qbp2 version of the bottleneck knapsack problem ( qbotkp2 ) : @xmath305    this is used as the value of the parameter @xmath60 in bdt@xmath275 and ib@xmath275 algorithms .",
    "the ` early ' columns report if early detection of optimality happened for the particular algorithm and test instance .",
    "` iterations ' columns report the number of iterations of the algorithms .    in our experiments , early optimality detection happened for every test instance and every algorithm , where such an option was enabled . for the bdt algorithm ,",
    "early detection significantly reduced the number of iterations and improved the overall performance .",
    "however , it reduces the number of iterations of the ib algorithm only by one in each run .",
    "since calculating of @xmath60 is approximately equivalent to one iteration of the ib algorithm , the overall running time of the procedure almost did not change after enabling early detection .",
    "another interesting observation that we can make from table  [ tab : omega ] is that the number of iterations of the ib algorithm almost does not depend on the size of the problem .",
    "since each such iteration needs @xmath306 feasibility tests , the real running time of the ib algorithm per iteration is expected to be much higher than that of the bdt algorithm given large instances .",
    "recall that the value of @xmath60 does not need to correspond to an optimal solution of the qbotkp2 but may be an upper bound to the optimal objective function value of qbotkp2 .",
    "observe that the algorithm used in our experiments to solve the qbotkp2 maintains a search interval which depends on the values of two indices @xmath307 where @xmath308 .",
    "when @xmath309 the algorithm terminates and guarantees an exact optimal solution  @xcite .",
    "this termination condition can be relaxed to @xmath310 to obtain a heuristic bound . in our implementation , we used the termination condition with @xmath311 , where @xmath312 .",
    "then the resulting upper bound @xmath313 can be calculated as @xmath314 .",
    "the results of our experiments with the approximate value of @xmath60 are reported in figure  [ fig : omega ] . when the value of @xmath315 is relatively small , the upper bound @xmath313 is very close to the exact value of @xmath60 . for @xmath316 ,",
    "the upper bound becomes less accurate and the early detection happens in neither dta@xmath317 nor ib@xmath317 algorithm .",
    "thus , the effect of using an upper bound @xmath313 instead of the optimal objective value @xmath60 is relatively small .",
    "recall that , by setting a time limitation to cplex when running a feasibility test , one can speed up the bdt , ib and db algorithms at the cost of loosing optimality guarantee . in figure",
    "[ fig : heuristics ] , we show how the solution quality depends on the running time for each of the bdt@xmath276 , ib@xmath276 and db@xmath276 algorithms .    in our experiments , the running time and",
    "the solution quality of each of the heuristics monotonically depend on the parameter @xmath277 .",
    "thus , the balance between the solution quality and the running time in the proposed heuristics can be efficiently controlled by @xmath277 .",
    "note that the ib@xmath276 algorithm , likewise its exact version , shows the best performance among the proposed heuristics .",
    "we also compared the bdt@xmath276 , ib@xmath276 and db@xmath276 heuristics with the mip algorithm given a time limitation ( in this case , we set the ` mip emphasis ' parameter of cplex to ` emphasize feasibility over optimality ' ) .",
    "however , in our experiments , such a mip heuristic showed very poor performance .",
    "we now discuss a generalization of the quadratic balanced optimization . for any fixed integer @xmath22 ,",
    "a cost @xmath318 for @xmath22-tuple @xmath319 is prescribed .",
    "consider the family @xmath1 of feasible solutions as in the case of qbop .",
    "then the _ multinomial balanced optimization problem _",
    "( mbop)is to find an @xmath8 such that @xmath320 is minimized , where @xmath321 .    in qbop",
    ", @xmath5 is viewed as pairwise interaction cost while in mbop we have ` interaction cost ' for @xmath22-tuples ( i.e. cost for @xmath22 element ordered subsets of the ground set @xmath2 . ) the algorithms discussed in this paper extends in a natural way to the case of mbop with an appropriate definition of the corresponding feasibility problem .",
    "we leave it for an interested reader to verify this claim .",
    "the number of distinct cost elements to be considered is @xmath322 as opposed to @xmath302 for the the case of qbop .",
    "thus , as @xmath22 increases the resulting algorithm could slow down significantly .",
    "we introduced the combinatorial optimization model qbop which can be used to model equitable distribution problems with pairwise interactions .",
    "the problem is strongly np - hard even if the family of feasible solutions has a simple structure such as the collection of all subsets of a finite set with an upper bound on the cardinality of these subsets .",
    "several exact and heuristic algorithms are provided along with detailed experimental analysis in the case of quadratic knapsack problems .",
    "special cases of the problem with decomposable type cost matrices are discussed .",
    "it is shown that the complexity of the resulting qbop depends on that of the corresponding lbop .",
    "it is not difficult to extend our results to the maximization version of the problem . by exploiting special structure of the family of feasible solutions @xmath1 and the structure of @xmath16 ,",
