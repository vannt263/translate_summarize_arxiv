    "several emerging technologies will incorporate fabricated magnets that are small enough to contain only a single magnetic domain .",
    "these nanoscale magnets will be essential for smaller components , lower power consumption , and completely new applications in fields such as information storage , integrated circuits , sensor technology , and microelectromechanical systems .",
    "successful implementation of these technologies requires a fundamental understanding of the dynamics of the internal magnetic structure of the nanoscale magnets on time scales ranging from the nanoseconds associated with gigahertz applications to the years over which magnetic information storage must be stable .",
    "an essential factor in many of these applications , especially in information storage , is the free - energy barrier that separates two antiparallel orientations of the magnetization .",
    "this free - energy barrier can be surmounted using thermal energy momentarily `` borrowed '' from the surroundings , and often device engineers strive for barriers of at least @xmath5 to make this thermal bit - flipping a rare event . here",

    "the smallest field sufficient to do this at zero temperature is called the coercive field @xmath8 fields smaller than the coercive field can not change the magnetization orientation deterministically , but they do cause lower free - energy barriers and make thermal crossing more probable . in fact , hybrid recording @xcite uses lower - than - coercive fields and thermal barrier crossing to write data in high - coercivity magnetic media .",

    ", the magnet stays in the metastable state with end caps of non - uniform magnetization induced by pole avoidance .",
    "eventually thermal fluctuations in the end caps carry the system over the free - energy barrier . after the barrier crossing , the entire magnet changes quickly to the stable equilibrium orientation .",
    "often , nanoscale magnets are assumed to be uniformly magnetized bodies .",
    "for instance , garca - palacios and lzaro @xcite considered the stochastic trajectories of isolated magnetic moments using the landau - lifshitz - gilbert equation subject only to applied fields and a uniaxial anisotropy , which supplied the free - energy barrier .",
    "they measured the susceptibility of the magnetization in small sinusoidal probe fields .",
    "multiple crossing of the free - energy barrier , a frequently noted consequence of the gyromagnetic motion in single - spin models , was also observed for their uniform - magnetization model .",
    "when at least one dimension of the nanomagnet is greater than the exchange length of the material , nonuniform reversal modes become energetically possible . to consider such nonuniform magnetization reversal we use micromagnetic simulation with a large number of points inside the magnet .",

    "as the applied field begins to decrease and then become negative , it is the zeeman energy that changes the most while the exchange and dipole - dipole energies remain nearly constant . near the coercive field",
    ", the exchange energy rapidly increases as regions of reversed magnetization , and the interfaces associated with them , form at the ends of the pillar .",
    "once these reversed regions become large enough , they grow spontaneously and the zeeman energy rapidly decreases , while the exchange energy from the interface between reversed and unreversed regions remains roughly constant",
    ". the growth of the reversed regions does not take long , and the exchange energy quickly dissipates when the regions from the two ends merge at the middle and the reversal is complete .    the information in fig .  [ fig : hystenergy ] can be used for extracting the coercive field of the nanomagnet . for infinitely slow variations in the applied field , @xmath81 is proportional to @xmath82 using the chain rule .",
    "thus portions of the figure with positive slope of the total energy correspond to fields for which the system is trapped behind an energy barrier , while portions with negative slope correspond to fields for which the system responds deterministically by finding a new energy - minimizing magnetization configuration . fields for which the energy has a maximum should then correspond to the coercive field .",
    "dynamic effects cause the field at which this maximum occurs to depend on the frequency .    to estimate the static coercive field we find @xmath83 for fields that vary linearly with time , @xmath84 for @xmath85 , and",

    "the coercive field clearly decreases with @xmath89 extrapolation of a weighted least - squares fit yields a coercive field of @xmath90 at @xmath91 this is a more accurate estimate of the static coercive field than those taken directly from hysteresis - loop simulations .      at finite temperature",
    "the magnetization can reverse , even when the applied field is weaker than the coercive field . in this case ,",

    "@xcite    in classical droplet theory , in which boundaries such as the sides of the magnet are ignored , nucleation of the equilibrium magnetization is governed by the competition between the favorable zeeman energy due to alignment with the applied field and the unfavorable exchange energy due to the interface with the majority volume of the misaligned orientation .",
    "the exchange energy dominates for small droplets , which tend to shrink .",
    "large droplets tend to grow because the zeeman energy dominates .",
    "these two regimes are separated by a critical droplet size , the saddle point associated with the free - energy barrier , where the tendencies toward growth and shrinkage are balanced . in nanoscale magnets the situation is more complicated because the free energy can not be easily separated into surface and volume contributions .",
    "nevertheless , the important aspect remains that a free - energy barrier exists that must be crossed for reversal to begin .",
    "the end caps fluctuate until a succession of highly unlikely fluctuations carries the end - cap configuration past the free - energy barrier .",
    "after that , growth of the reversed region is energetically favorable and occurs rapidly , on the order of @xmath96 to @xmath97  ns for the pillars",
    ".    for long pillars , nucleation events at the two ends occur approximately independently of each other .",
    "in addition , the growth of a supercritical region takes a significant amount of time : enough time for the other end cap to have a reasonable probability to nucleate and begin to grow .",

    "[ fig : switchpicture](b ) it can also be seen that the nucleation of the two end caps is not completely independent .",
    "as one reversed region grows along the pillar , the free - energy barrier at the other end cap decreases .",

    "an algorithm that remains reasonable for large systems is the fast multipole method .",
    "@xcite    we have chosen to calculate the magnetic potential using the fast multipole method ( fmm ) because it has several advantages over the more traditional fast fourier transform ( fft ) approach .",
    "the biggest difference between the two methods is that the fmm makes no assumptions about the underlying lattice , while the fft method assumes a cubic lattice with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "one consequence of this assumption is that numerical models of systems without periodic boundary conditions require empty space around the magnet so that the boundary conditions do not affect the calculation .",

    "the relations for the new factors are @xcite @xmath223 and @xmath224 the construction of the hierarchy terminates when the entire system is enclosed by a single cube .",
    "the partitioning can be generalized to noncubic rectangular prisms , but the restriction that the multipole expansion is only valid at distances larger than twice the diagonal of the rectangle will complicate the algorithm .    a downward pass through the hierarchy involving three types of operations is required to construct @xmath204 as represented by the local expansion coefficients @xmath206 for each cube . the first operation is the translation of the local expansion for the encompassing bigger cube ( if one exists ) that includes all the contributions from its far field , _ i.e. _ , those cubes on its level that are not its neighbors .",
    "this translation is accomplished by the rule @xcite @xmath225 where @xmath221 are the local expansion coefficients of the larger cube , and the spherical coordinates @xmath222 here are for the vector from the origin of the smaller cube to that of the larger cube .",

    "since a regular lattice is used , the point @xmath208 where @xmath204 is being calculated always lies at the corner of the neighboring cube of constant @xmath216 , and the contribution is simply @xmath230 because only one quadrant of the region of constant @xmath216 needs to be considered in this exact manner .",

    "the hboxs for each level of the decomposition hierarchy are held in a container class hlevel , and the entire hierarchy is maintained as a linked list .",
    "our implementation of hlevel is particular to the cubic - lattice decomposition of space , and irregular geometries have to be padded with empty space .",
