    "<S> for a bose - hubbard dimer , we study quenches of the site energy imbalance , taking a highly asymmetric hamiltonian to a fully symmetric one . the ramp is carried out over a finite time that interpolates between the instantaneous and adiabatic limits . </S>",
    "<S> we provide results for the excess energy of the final state compared to the ground state energy of the final hamiltonian , as a function of the quench rate . </S>",
    "<S> this excess energy serves as the analog of the defect density that is considered in the kibble - zurek picture of ramps across phase transitions . </S>",
    "<S> we also examine the fate of quantum ` self - trapping ' when the ramp is not instantaneous . </S>"
