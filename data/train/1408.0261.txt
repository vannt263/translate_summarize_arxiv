    "it is well known that the cfe of c_10 @xmath1consists mostly of coefficients with a reasonably small number of digits , interspersed with coefficients with a very large number of digits .",
    "a coefficient that has a value that is larger than any previous coefficient is called a hwm . as one progresses along the cfe ,",
    "the pattern of relatively small coefficients sprinkled with very large coefficients continues between the hwms , even though the other large coefficients are not themselves hwms .",
    "there are many patterns in the properties of the convergents formed by truncating the cfe of c_10 @xmath1immediately before the hwms for hwm numbers greater than 3 .",
    "these properties and their patterns have been formulated and discussed ( * ? ? ?",

    "the purpose of this paper is to extend the formulations and the conjectures from base 10 to bases 2 through 124 , with exceptions noted and the pertinent formulae provided .",
