    "in the ideal case at asymptotically high baryon density , the color superconductivity with two massless flavors and the color - flavor - locking ( cfl ) phase with three degenerated massless quarks have been widely discussed from first principle qcd calculations@xcite . for physical applications we are more interested in the moderate baryon density region which may be related to the neutron stars and , in very optimistic cases , even to heavy - ion collisions .",
    "usually , four - fermion interaction models such as the instanton , as well as the nambu  jona - lasinio ( njl ) model , are used in the study of color superconductivity phase transition .",
    "it was found that the color superconductivity gap can be of the order of 100 mev@xcite , which is two orders larger than early perturbative qcd estimation@xcite .",
    "the electric and color charge neutrality condition@xcite leads to a new phase of color superconductivity , the gapless color superconductivity@xcite or the breached pairing phase@xcite .",
    "the most probable temperature for this new phase is finite but not zero@xcite .",
    "it is generally accepted that the njl model@xcite applied to quarks@xcite offers a simple but effective scheme to study spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking in the vacuum , chiral restoration at finite temperature and density , and spontaneous color symmetry breaking at high density@xcite . from the study of chiral phase transition without considering color superconductivity , it is well - known that@xcite the mean field approximation to quarks and random phase approximation ( rpa ) to mesons can describe well the thermodynamics of the system , especially the massless goldstone mode in the spontaneous symmetry breaking phase . in this letter",
    "i will determine the diquark mass in rpa , discuss its constraint on the coupling constant in the diquark channel , and investigate the phase structure of color superconductivity and chiral restoration and its dependence on the coupling constant .",
    "the njl lagrange density is defined as @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are coupling constants in color signet channel and color anti - triplet channel , respectively , and @xmath3 is the current quark mass .    the quark - antiquark and diquark condensates which are order parameters of chiral and color superconductivity phase transitions are defined as @xmath4 where it has been regarded that only the first two colors participate in the condensate , while the third one does not .",
    "the condensates are assumed real but are otherwise as yet unspecified .    a usual way to treat systematically",
    "the spontaneous color and chiral symmetry breaking at finite temperature and density is to introduce the nambu - gorkov space@xcite with color and flavor degrees of freedom . after performing the fourier transformation ,",
    "the quark propagator in momentum space at mean field level is diagonal in the @xmath5 dimensional nambu - gorkov space , @xmath6 where @xmath7 with @xmath8 are @xmath9 matrices , @xmath10 in general case , the quark chemical potential @xmath11 depends on color and flavor degrees of freedom , the elements of the @xmath12 matrices @xmath13 are totally different .",
    "however , if we consider only the baryon chemical potential @xmath14 , one has @xmath15 , and some of the elements are identical , @xmath16 with the quark energies @xmath17 , effective quark mass @xmath18 and the energy projectors @xmath19    while the first two colors are involved in the quark - antiquark and diquark condensates , and their dispersion relation @xmath20 are related to @xmath21 and @xmath22 , the third color participates in the chiral condensate only , the non - diagonal elements of the last two matrices @xmath23 and @xmath24 are zero , and its energy @xmath25 is associated with @xmath21 only .    from the definition of the two condensates ( [ condensate ] ) , it is easy to obtain their relation with the elements of the quark propagator ( [ propagator ] ) , @xmath26\\ , \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\delta\\left[1 + 8g_d\\int{d^3{\\bf k}\\over ( 2\\pi)^3}\\left({1\\over e_k^-}\\left(2f(e_k^-)-1\\right)+{1\\over e_k^+}\\left(2f(e_k^+)-1\\right)\\right)\\right ] = 0\\ , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the fermi - dirac distribution function @xmath27 .",
    "the diquark polarization function can be represented in terms of the matrix elements of the quark propagator , @xmath28\\ .\\ ] ] in the mean field approximation to quarks and rpa to mesons and diquarks , the temperature and baryon chemical potential dependence of the diquark mass @xmath29 is controlled by the pole equation @xmath30    we consider now the physical constraints in the vacuum on the coupling constant @xmath2 in the diquark channel .",
    "the diquark mass @xmath31 in the vacuum is determined by @xmath32    in general , temperature effect disorders a system , and any condensate will be suppressed in hot medium .",
    "therefore , the critical chemical potential of color superconductivity goes up monotonously with increasing temperature , and the minimum one @xmath33 at zero temperature satisfies the gap equation @xmath34 from the comparison of the above two equations , we obtain the relation between the diquark mass in the vacuum and the critical chemical potential for diquark condensate at zero temperature , @xmath35    when the diquark is massless in the vacuum , the color superconductivity happens even at @xmath36 , and the vacuum becomes instable . on the other hand ,",
    "when the diquark mass in the vacuum is larger than two times the quark mass , the color superconductivity is far from the vacuum , and a diquark can not be in the bound state , but decay into two quarks .",
    "therefore , the diquark mass @xmath31 should satisfy the constraint @xmath37 from the comparison of the diquark mass equation ( [ dvacuum ] ) and the quark mass equation in the vacuum , @xmath38 the constraint @xmath39 on the diquark mass resulus in the relation between the two coupling constants @xmath2 and",
    "@xmath1 , @xmath40 with the known values of the parameters @xmath41 and @xmath42 in real world , the minimum and maximum coupling constant take the values @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "before making numerical calculations , we first discuss the parameters in the model . there are four independent parameters in the current njl model with both diquark and meson channels , the three - momentum cutoff @xmath45 , the current quark mass @xmath3 , and the coupling constants @xmath1 and @xmath2 . the first three can be fixed by fitting the pion mass @xmath46 gev , the pion decay constant @xmath47 gev , and the quark condensate density @xmath48 gev@xmath49 in the vacuum .",
    "it leads to @xmath50 gev and @xmath51 gev@xmath52 in chiral limit with zero current quark mass @xmath53 , and @xmath54 gev , @xmath55 gev@xmath52 and @xmath56 gev in real world .    in chiral limit",
    "the chiral phase transition is well defined , and the phase transition line determined by @xmath57 is a solution of the gap equations ( [ gap ] ) . the phase diagram in the @xmath58 plane is shown in fig.[fig1 ] for different coupling constant @xmath2 in the diquark channel .    at the minimum coupling constant @xmath59",
    ", the whole @xmath58 plane is separated into three regions , the region with chiral symmetry breaking but color symmetry , @xmath60 and @xmath61 at low density , the region with chiral symmetry but color symmetry breaking , @xmath57 and @xmath62 at low temperature , and the region with both chiral and color symmetries , @xmath63 at high temperature and/or high density .",
    "the critical temperature @xmath64 mev for chiral phase transition at @xmath65 is in good agreement with the lattice calculation@xcite , and the chiral symmetry breaking phase ends at @xmath66 determined by @xmath67 from the comparison with the quark mass equation ( [ mass ] ) in the vacuum , one has @xmath68 .",
    "therefore , from the definition of the minimum coupling constant @xmath59 at which the minimum chemical potential @xmath33 of color superconductivity is equal to the constituent quark mass in the vacuum , the end point of chiral phase transition and the starting point of color superconductivity coincide at @xmath69 .",
    "the order of a phase transition is determined by the behavior of the order parameter across the phase transition line .",
    "it is well known@xcite that the chiral phase transition is of second order at high temperature and of first order at high density .",
    "the critical chemical potential at which the chiral transition goes from first to second order is @xmath70 mev in the njl model@xcite .",
    "one can also determine the critical exponent for the color superconductivity .",
    "since the square bracket of the second gap equation of ( [ gap ] ) depends quadratically on the order parameter @xmath22 , one has a simple zero for @xmath71 as a function of @xmath72 and therefore in the neighborhood of the critical temperature @xmath73 of color superconductivity the order parameter behaviors as @xmath74 this means that the transition between the phase with @xmath75 and the phase with @xmath76 is of second order .    with increasing coupling constant @xmath2 , the critical temperature @xmath73 for melting the diquark condensate increases and the critical chemical potential @xmath33 for forming the color superconductivity decreases . especially , a new phase with both chiral and color symmetry breaking , @xmath60 and @xmath77 , is produced in between the phase with only chiral symmetry breaking and the phase with only color symmetry breaking , as shown in fig.[fig2 ] for @xmath78 .",
    "the left and right borders of this mixed phase are determined by @xmath79 and @xmath80 , respectively . with increasing @xmath2",
    "the chiral breaking phase is swallowed up gradually by the mixed phase . at the maximum coupling",
    "constant @xmath81 the chiral breaking phase disappears and the mixed phase reaches the maximum .",
    "we have analytically derived the simple relation between the diquark mass in the vacuum and the minimum quark chemical potential for diquark condensate , @xmath82 . under the conditions to keep the diquark bound state in the vacuum and to have a stable physical vacuum without diquark condensate in it",
    ", we obtained the constraint on the coupling constant in the diquark channel , @xmath83 , with the relations to the coupling constant in the meson channel @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "there is a strong competition between the color superconductivity and chiral symmetry restoration : with increasing @xmath2 the phase with chiral symmetry breaking but color symmetry is gradually taken over by the phase with both chiral and color symmetry breaking .",
