    "how do e / s0 galaxies acquire their ism ? what are the processes that regulate the evolution of the ism ?",
    "posing such questions , and considering their answers , modifies our traditional view of elliptical galaxies as simple and dull objects while challenging our understanding of the classical hubble classification scheme .",
    "the growing amount of observational data accumulated by recent multi - wavelength surveys implies that there is no simple answer to the longstanding origin question ( de zeeuw et al .",
    "2002 ; rampazzo et al .  2005 ; cappellari et al .",
    "the general picture that emerges from these studies is that both accretion and merger events and internal production could have contributed to some extent to the overall ism content in e / s0 galaxies .",
    "the relative contribution of external versus internal sources does not seem to follow a general rule but probably varies between objects .    to delve into the properties of the ism in e / s0 galaxies much attention has been paid to spectroscopic analysis of the dynamics and chemical abundance of the gas and stars ( sarzi et al .",
    "2006 ; annibali et al .  2010 ; young et al .",
    "although highly informative , the limited spectral coverage of these investigations , together with our current limited knowledge of the interplay between different gas phases , tend to lead to an indecisive conclusion regarding the true nature of the ism .",
    "moreover , although it was found that the motion and orientation of the gas in many systems are decoupled from the stellar rotation , the overall distribution of the kinematical misalignment between stars and gas in e / s0 galaxies is inconsistent with a purely external origin ( sarzi et al .",
    "the detection of unusual optical signatures in such systems could provide more definitive and direct indications to the dominant source of the ism .",
    "this is particularly true for a subclass of galaxies where dust is easily recognized by its light obscuration which produces well - defined dark lanes .",
    "a significant fraction of these galaxies exhibit morphological disturbances , such as shells and tidal features , indicative of recent mergers or accretion events ( van dokkum 2005 ; tal et al .",
    "2009 ; kaviraj et al .",
    "in fact , when a single stellar population evolves the ejected material is expected to spread evenly throughout the galaxy , whereas the spatial distribution and orientation of the optical dust features are frequently misaligned with those of the stars ( van dokkum & franx 1995 ; tran et al .  2001 ; krips et al .  2003 ; martel et al .",
    "2004 ; quillen 2006 ; finkelman et al .",
    "furthermore , the dust content of these galaxies , estimated by measuring total optical extinction , is usually found to be several times larger than expected to be supplied by internal processes , such as stellar mass loss ( patil et al .",
    "2007 ) .    studying the interplay between the various multi - temperature components of the ism in",
    "e / s0 galaxies with dust lanes provides also vital clues to the external origin of the dust .",
    "large - scale dust structures are virtually always accompanied by excited or ionized gas , whose angular momenta are typically relatively high and often orthogonal to those of the stars ( bertola 1987 ; kormendy & djorgovski 1989 ; caon , pastoriza & macchetto 2001 ; krajnovic et al .",
    "2008 ; davis et al .",
    "e / s0 galaxies with dust lanes show also high detection rates of cold molecular gas ( sage & galletta 1993 ; wang , kenney & ishizuki 1992 ; combes , young & bureau 2007 ; krips et al .  2010 ; young et al .",
    "2011 ) , whereas large - scale dust features are also often associated with hi gas in discs rotating at random orientations with respect to the optical major axis ( kormendy & djorgovski 1989 ; oosterloo et al .  2002",
    "; leeuw et al .",
    "perhaps more intriguing is the detection of significant dust reservoirs in x - ray bright e / s0 galaxies , where sputtering by hot particles is expected to erode and destroy the dust grains on short time scales of @xmath0100 myr .    to tie these pieces of information sparks et al .",

    "( 1990 ) independently proposed the ` evaporation flow ' scenario , in which cold dust and gas are externally acquired by an elliptical galaxy during a gravitational interaction with a gas - rich galaxy , and then heated due to the thermal interaction with the ambient hot plasma . as a result",
    ", the interacting hot gas locally cools to its warm ( ionized ) phase , whereas the dust is partially shielded within the gradually evaporating dense molecular clouds .",
    "this scenario accounts also for the tight spatial correlation between dust and ionized gas that is often observed along filaments , or cooling flows , associated with the presence of hot x - ray emitting coronal gas ( macchetto et al .",
    "1996 ; trinchieri & goudfrooij 2002 ; fabian et al .  2003 ; sparks et al .",
    "2004 ) . unlike cold dust and molecular gas , atomic hydrogen",
    "is not expected to survive in the presence of hot x - ray gas , which explains the hi deficiency in the central parts of e / s0 galaxies with dust lanes ( oosterloo et al .",
    "2002 ; leeuw et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "this paper summarizes the results of an ongoing study of a sample of e / s0 galaxies where dust lanes have been reported in the literature .",
    "our results , combined with those from similar studies , are used to demonstrate that the properties of the observed dust strongly support the ` evaporation flow ' scenario sketched above .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section [ s : obs_and_red ] gives a short description of the sample , observations and data reduction ; section [ s : analysis ] discusses the data analysis and results ; the results are discussed in section [ s : discuss ] and our conclusions are summarized in section [ s : conclusions ] .",
    "we shall assume throughout the paper standard cosmology with @xmath1 km s@xmath2 mpc@xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "this is the second paper in our survey of the ism in a distinct morphological subclass of early - type galaxies ( see finkelman et al .",
    "our sample consists primarily of galaxies identified by early photographic catalogues as elliptical stellar bodies crossed by extended dust lanes ( hawarden et al .",
    "1981 , ebneter & balick 1985 ; bertola 1987 ; vron - cetty & vron 1988 ) .",
    "since the dust lanes presumably represent highly - inclined structures , the optically - obscured elliptical galaxies were often confused with lenticular galaxies , although ( almost ) no trace of a stellar disc was later identified in their ccd images .",
    "however , it seems at present , in many aspects , less important whether to call such objects elliptical or lenticular galaxies ; we therefore refer to them as transitional dusty ` e / s0 ' galaxies .",
    "other objects are selected from more recent studies of e / s0 galaxies with dust lanes , including the search for cold gas ( gregorini , messina & vettolani 1989 ; mllenhoff , hummel & bender 1992 ; wang , kenney & ishizuki 1992 ) and the determination of the extragalactic dust extinction law in the dark lanes ( goudfrooij et al .",

    "the sample galaxies are listed in table [ t : obs ] with their coordinates , morphological classification , integrated blue luminosity , heliocentric velocity and optical size taken from ned .    as part of our on - going programme",
    "we observed 20 more e / s0 galaxies with broad - band and h@xmath5 narrow - band filters , adding to the sample discussed in finkelman et al .",

    "the observations were conducted during 2009 and 2010 with the 1.8-m vatican advanced technology telescope at the mt .",

    "optical and near - ir images of ngc 5128 were taken with the ctio 0.9-m telescope in may 2001 and with the infrared survey facility 1.4-m telescope in saao in april 2010 , respectively .",
    "typical exposure times used for the galaxies in our sample were 10 min for the optical and near - ir filters and 20 min for the h@xmath5 narrow - band filters .",
    "detailed descriptions of data reduction steps , flux calibration and error propagation are available in finkelman et al .",
    "( 2010a ) .",
    "below we briefly summarize these steps .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,>,<,>,>,^ , < \" , ]      a large part of our sample galaxies are not listed in catalogues of x - ray sources , probably due to the relatively low sensitivity of large x - ray surveys of hot gas in elliptical galaxies .",
    "while these shallow surveys paid considerable attention to x - ray bright ` giant ' elliptical galaxies , deep chandra and xmm - newton observations revealed substantial amounts of hot gas in ` normal ' elliptical galaxies as well ( see e.g. , mathews & brighenti 2003 ; diehl & statler 2007 ; boroson , kim & fabbiano 2011 ) . as a general rule , less",
    "massive galaxies are expected to be less able to retain the hot gas , which could escape the gravitational potential of the galaxy .",
    "however , the hot gas content probably depends to some extent also on the evolutionary history of a galaxy .",
    "for instance , e / s0 galaxies that have undergone a recent merger have low x - ray luminosities while relaxed e / s0 galaxies are stronger x - ray emitters ( sansom , hibbard & schweizer 2000 ) .",
    "this can be explained if hot gas halos build up through mass loss from stars over a timescale of several gyr after a merger .",
    "+ our sample galaxies lie in diverse environments , cover a wide range of size and have probably experienced different merger histories .",
    "it is therefore reasonable to assume that the hot gas content varies significantly between these objects . on one hand , observations of ionized gas in e / s0 galaxies where x - ray halos were not detected show",
    "that at least some of the ` warm ' ionized gas does stay within the galaxy potential well and is often accompanied by dust ( macchetto et al .",
    "on the other hand , massive , x - ray bright galaxies are able to retain their warm gas content , while the internally produced dust is subject to rapid erosion by sputtering .",
    "therefore , internally - produced ionized gas is expected to anti - correlate with the dust component .    to test this , we plot in fig .",
    "[ f : dustha ] the ionized gas mass versus the dust mass , including also data from previous studies ( goudfrooij et al .  1994a , 1994b ; macchetto et al .  1996 ; martel et al",
    "the two components have comparable masses over about 4 orders of magnitude , spreading over spatial scales from the nuclear regions to extended structures several kpc away from the centre .",
    "the ionized gas spatially correlates not only with the optically obscured regions , but also with the hot dust emission , which suggests that the source of ionization and dust heating is the same ( see figs .  [",
    "f : dustwarm ] and [ f : ncg5128 ] here , and figs .  a1 - 8 in finkelman",
    "these findings , therefore , provide important evidence against an internal origin of these components . in fact , since the observed mass relation seems to be independent of the hot gas content of each galaxy , there must be a mechanism to protect dust grains embedded in hot ambient gas from destruction",
    ".    the dust grain lifetime could be much longer for material acquired via an interaction as part of a cooler medium that is ( partly ) isolated from the hot medium . inside",
    "dense molecular clouds , dust would be self - shielded against the diffuse galactic uv radiation and the hot thermal electrons in the adjacent hot gas ( temi , brighenti & mathews 2007 ) . on the other hand , other ionizing sources , such as agn or star formation activity , could disperse and heat some of the dusty gas . these conditions could possibly explain why dust is heated but not destroyed , even in the presence of hot plasma .",
    "shocks triggered by cloud - cloud interactions during accretion of cold gas could produce also a multiphase dusty gas composed of a dust - free , x - ray emitting plasma and a cold component of mixed dust and molecular gas ( guillard et al .",
    "however , whether shock - heating can account for the observed line - emission characteristics is still unclear ( tang et al .",
    "if the gas and dust in the ionized regions are not the product of ism cooling processes , they could be part of the original warm phase of the accreted ism .",
    "possible evidence for such a process was given by kauffmann , li & hickman ( 2010 ) who suggested that satellite galaxies are likely to trace an underlying reservoir of ionized gas that can be accreted onto the host galaxy .",
    "although e / s0 galaxies were once thought to be almost entirely devoid of cold gas , we know by now that the molecular gas in e / s0 galaxies in invariably associated with dust lanes ( wang et al .  1992 ; sage & galletta 1993 ; combes et al .  2007 ; krips et al .",
    "2010 ; young et al .",
    "a correlation between the cold molecular gas reservoir and the cold dust content was also established for far - ir selected early - type galaxies ( see kaviraj et al .  2011 and references therein )",
    ". however , we caution that a significant part of the far - ir emission originates probably from dust distributed throughout the galaxy and heated by the ambient stellar radiation field ( see section [ s : dust_distribution ] ) . this diffuse dust component is associated with the diffuse atomic gas phase rather than with the dense molecular gas .",
    "the molecular gas in e / s0 galaxies does not correlate with the underlying stellar population implying it was most likely externally accreted ( wiklind , combes & henkel 1995 ) .",
    "several e / s0 galaxies with dust lanes were also found to contain significant amounts of cold neutral hydrogen , generally distributed in an extended disc - like structure of low surface density ( oosterloo et al .",
    "2002 ; serra et al .",
    "while the latter is believed to be a result of an accretion event , the hi - to - dust ratios measured are considerably lower than the gas - to - dust ratio typical of spiral galaxies .",
    "it is therefore possible that much of the gas in these galaxies could be in molecular rather than atomic form .",
    "since molecular gas normally has a higher surface density than atomic gas , it falls deeper in the galaxy potential well and is more difficult to remove by interactions with neighboring galaxies ( young et al .",
    "part of the atomic gas could also be heated by hot plasma and later cool to the cold neutral medium temperatures , condense and become molecular .",
    "consequently , the cold gas in the central regions could be dominated by molecular gas ( oosterloo et al .",
    "2010 ) .",
    "studying ngc 5128 in the far - ir to sub - mm wavelength range leeuw et al .",
    "( 2002 ) derived a total dust mass of @xmath6 within 225 arcsec of the nucleus .",
    "this value is consistent with our estimate of the dust mass from optical extinction .",
    "however , far - ir observations of more distant , less - resolved galaxies indicate that the entire dust mass in e / s0 galaxies is generally at least an order of magnitude higher than estimated by optical extinction , as illustrated in fig .  [",
    "f : colddust ] .",
    "the discrepancy can be explained by the presence of a diffuse , massive dust component which light attenuation is difficult to detect ( goudfrooij & de jong 1995 ) .",
    "significant reservoirs of dust might also be located in the central parts of these galaxies ( temi et al .  2007 ;",
    "leeuw et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "the distribution of the optical dust is difficult to explain purely by internal processes .",
    "if dust is produced by stellar mass loss , it is expected to follow the stellar light distribution , rather than lie in well - organized structures ( see for instance athey et al .  2002 ; bregman & athey 2004 ) .",
    "agn outflows disrupting the dense central dusty structure in the galactic core could generate morphologically chaotic or asymmetric obscuring dust features away from the centre , but not well - settled dust discs ( temi et al .",
    "furthermore , bregman et al .",
    "( 1998 ) argued that the observed mass discrepancy between the two dust components can not be accounted for in hot gas environments if the ism was internally - generated , unless the grain sizes are typically much higher than for the galaxy .",
    "the authors concluded also that the ratio between the masses derived by iras data and optical extinction would appear to grow after a merger .",
    "we note that there seems to be no clear correlation between far - ir emission or dust content and blue luminosity in early - type galaxies ( e.g. , forbes 1991 ; goudfrooij & de jong 1995 ; trinchieri & goudfrooij 2002 ; temi et al .  2007 ;",
    "kaviraj et al .",
    "2011 ; smith et al .",
    "however , since previous far - ir surveys ( e.g. , iras ) were not sensitive to dust colder than @xmath7 k , testing this correlation and the presence of different dust components requires detecting the thermal emission of the very cold dust phase at sub - mm wavelengths . to establish what is the dominant source of dust in e / s0 galaxies requires also mapping its emission for a representative sample of galaxies ( temi et al .  2004 ; xilouris et al .",
    "the details of dust grinding processes that could destroy such a correlation should also be accounted for .    finally , although we showed throughout this paper that the association of gas and dust argues strongly against their internal origin , explaining why externally - acquired dust and ionized gas have comparable masses is far from trivial . considering the various ionization mechanisms in action over different spatial scales",
    "makes it difficult to account for such a relation in any scenario ( see sarzi et al .",
    "2010 ) . moreover , if the ism is acquired from a gas - rich dwarf or through a merger between spiral galaxies , then the overall gas mass is expected to be about 2 - 3 order of magnitude higher than the overall dust content ( e.g. , walter et al .  2007 ; muoz - mateos et al .",
    "2009 ) . where is the rest of the gas and , assuming that the ionization sources should not be confined to the dust lane ,",
    "why do we not see significant amounts of dust - free ionized gas ? solving these issues seems to require making a full inventory of the multiphase ism ingredients , which is beyond the scope of our study .",
    "we present broad - band and narrow - band images to study the content of dust and ionized gas in e / s0 galaxies with dust lanes .",
    "we find that : + ( 1 ) the grain size distribution typically follows that of the galaxy ; + ( 2 ) the dust mass , measured from the optical extinction by ` large ' dust grains , ranges from @xmath8 to @xmath9 ; + ( 3 ) the hot dust mass , measured from the 22@xmath10 m emission from ` small ' dust grains , ranges from 1 to 3000 @xmath11 ; + ( 4 ) the cold dust mass , measured from iras data , is typically much higher than the optical dust mass .",
    "+ ( 5 ) the ionized gas content strongly correlates with that of the optical dust ; + ( 6 ) the ionized gas is morphologically associated with the optical dust structure and the hot dust distribution ;    we argue that these observed relations indicate that the ionized gas and the obscuring material have the same origin , are heated by the same sources and are well mixed .",
    "we conclude that an internal origin of the dust and ionized gas in e / s0 galaxies with dust lanes is highly unlikely ; the hot gas content of e / s0 galaxies is quite heterogeneous and expected to affect differently the grain size distribution , mass content and dust distribution of individual galaxies , whereas our findings are independent of the hot gas content of each galaxy .",
    "we argue also that our results are consistent with the ` evaporation flow ' hypothesis , albeit with some uncertainty as to the exact details of the process . if the dusty gas that we observe in the optical is part of the dense material arriving from outside during an accretion or merger event , than it could survive destruction even in hot and extreme environments .",
    "relaxed gaseous discs and chaotic filamentary structures represent in this picture different states of similar events .",
    "the frequent detection of tidal features , atomic and molecular gas and kinematically decoupled gas components in e / s0 galaxies with dust lanes support this proposed view .",
