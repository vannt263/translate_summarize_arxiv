    "successful models for describing energy spectra , transition strengths and other nuclear phenomena usually work well in one region of a shell but not in others .",
    "for example , the random phase approximation ( rpa ) @xcite is a reasonable theory for describing properties of nuclei near closed shells but fails in mid - shell regions where deformation is the most characteristic feature due to the importance of the quadruple - quadrupole ( @xmath9 ) interaction @xcite in this domain . for near mid - shell nuclei , algebraic models based on @xmath0 @xcite work best since the basis states are then eigenstates of @xmath9 .",
    "applications of a nuclear shell - model theory always involve three considerations @xcite :    * _ step 1 : _ selection of a model space based on a simplified hamiltonian . frequently used approximations include the simple harmonic oscillator hamiltonian for near closed - shell nuclei and a nilsson hamiltonian for deformed systems . *",
    "_ step 2 : _ diagonalization of a realistic hamiltonian in the model space to obtain the energy spectrum and eigenstates of the system under consideration .",
    "important components of a realistic hamiltonian include the @xmath10 and pairing ( @xmath11 ) interactions as well as single - particle @xmath12 and @xmath13 terms . *",
    "_ step 3 : _ evaluation of electromagnetic transition strengths ( e2 , m1 , etc . ) between calculated eigenstates and a comparison with the available experimental data .",
    "if the model hamiltonian includes free parameters , for example , single - particle energies and/or the strength of the @xmath9 and @xmath11 interactions , the procedure is repeated to obtain a best overall fit to the experiment data .",
    "the easiest to use of modern shell - model codes are based on the so - called m - scheme logic , namely , model spaces spanned by many - particle configurations ( slater determinants ) with good projection of the total angular momentum @xcite .",
    "good total angular momentum , which is a conserved symmetry due to the isotropy of space , is obtained by angular momentum projection",
    ". codes of this type normally yield a good description of the single - particle nuclear phenomena ; unfortunately , an equally good description of collective phenomena within the framework of such a theory is very difficult to achieve . on other hand ,",
    "an @xmath0 based shell - model scheme is designed to give a simple interpretation of collective phenomena .",
    "an ideal scenario would incorporate both , allowing the hamiltonian of the system to `` choose '' which one of the two ( or an admixture ) is most appropriate .    a project , code named red stick for baton rouge , is now under development at louisiana state university .",
    "principal authors are jerry draayer , erich ormand , calvin johnson , and vesselin gueorguiev .",
    "the goal of the project is to develop a new m - scheme shell - model code that allows the user to include @xmath0 symmetry - adapted basis states in addition to ( the usual ) single - particle based configurations .    in this paper",
    "we discuss the first stage of the red stick project  a basis generator for @xmath14-scheme @xmath0 shell - model configurations .",
    "we begin with a review of @xmath0 shell - model basics @xcite .",
    "then we introduce an appropriate single - particle level scheme and give matrix elements of the generators of @xmath0 in that representation .",
    "next we consider the structure of the highest weight state ( hws ) of an @xmath0 irrep , and especially the hws of so - called leading @xmath0 irreps .",
    "once a hws is known , we then go on to show how all states of that irrep can be constructed using @xmath0 step operators @xcite .",
    "states with good projection of the total angular momentum @xmath7 are obtained by considering the direct product @xmath15 .",
    "some information about the fortran code that uses these techniques will also be presented .      in this section",
    "we review group theoretical concepts that are important to the development of the theory and introduce @xmath0 conventions adopted in our discussion .",
    "we also consider the physical reduction @xmath16 and the canonical reduction @xmath17 with their respective labels .",
    "first consider the so - called physical reduction @xmath18 , which yields a convenient labeling scheme for the generators of @xmath0 in terms of @xmath19 tensor operators .",
    "the commutation relations for these @xmath20 tensor operators are given in terms of ordinary @xmath19 clebsch - gordan coefficients ( cgc ) @xcite : @xmath21 & = & -\\sqrt{2}(1m,1m^{\\prime } |1m+m^{\\prime } ) l_{m+m^{\\prime } }   \\nonumber \\\\",

    "unfortunately , this scheme has only one additive label , namely @xmath25 , and in addition , there are technical difficulties associated with handling the @xmath27 label .",
    "the labeling scheme for this project is the canonical reduction @xmath28 where @xmath6 is the @xmath29 generator and the @xmath30 generators are proportional to @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 @xcite . under the action of the generators of these @xmath29 and @xmath30 groups , the remaining four generators of @xmath0 transform as two conjugate spin @xmath34 $ ] @xmath30 tensors with @xmath35 values for @xmath6 . for this scheme ,",
    "states of a given @xmath0 irrep @xmath22 have the following labels :    * @xmath23  @xmath0 irrep labels , * @xmath36  quadruple moment ( @xmath6 ) , * @xmath25  projection of the orbital angular momentum ( @xmath31 ) , * @xmath37  related to the second order casimir operator of @xmath38 , which for symmetric @xmath39 irreps is simply the number of oscillator quanta in the @xmath40 plane .",
    "this canonical reduction , @xmath17 , has two additive labels , @xmath36 ( @xmath6 ) and @xmath25 ( @xmath31 ) and the allowed values of these labels for fixed @xmath0 irrep @xmath23 are given by @xcite :    @xmath41    where @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44",
    "the algorithm we use to generate @xmath0 symmetry adapted states with good projection of the total angular momentum is described in this section .",
    "it consists of four basic components : 1 ) definition of the single - particle levels and matrix elements of the @xmath0 generators for a given shell ; 2 ) generation of the hws of @xmath45 for given number of fermions @xmath1 and spin @xmath4 ; 3 ) generation of the other @xmath0 states by applying step operators to the hws ; and 4 ) generation of states of good total angular momentum projection , @xmath7 .",
    "this will be followed by a short discussion of a fortran code that uses the algorithm .",
    "single - particle levels of the @xmath46 @xmath47 harmonic oscillator shell belong to the symmetric @xmath48 irrep of @xmath0 . because @xmath49 , a typical three - dimensional representation of @xmath0 basis states , fig.[3d - view of su(3 ) irrep ] , reduces to a special two - dimensional triangular shape ( @xmath50 and @xmath51 become linearly dependent ) , fig.[single particle levels ] .",
    "also , because @xmath0 is a compact group its irreps are finite dimensional and many - particle ( fermion ) configurations can be conveniently represented as binary strings with a @xmath52 or @xmath53 representing the presence or absence of a particle in the corresponding single - particle level .",
    "( the latter , together with a `` sign rule '' to accommodate fermion statistics , is a convenient computer native implementation of a slater determinant representation of the basis states . )",
    "a convenient ordering scheme ( which tracks the arrows in fig.[single particle levels ] ) is set by requiring a simple representation of many - particle configurations with maximum quadruple deformation .",
    "this objective can be achieved if the states are ordered by @xmath50 ( quadruple moment ) first and then by @xmath25 ( projection of the total angular momentum ) .      to be able to apply the @xmath0 generators on many - particle configurations it suffices to know the action of these generators on the single - particle states .",
    "the eight generators of @xmath0 belong to the self - adjoint @xmath54 irrep of @xmath0 .",
    "the operator structure should be chosen in the most convenient form for the application under consideration .",
    "for the present application , this choice is the same as used for the basis states , namely , the @xmath55 reduction .",
    "the matrix elements of the @xmath0 generators can be obtained either by using an application of the appropriate wigner - eckert theorem or by using explicit expressions @xcite for determining the action of the operators on the basis states . for computational purposes",
    "it is better to adopt a direct solution , one that exploits the fact that the action is on a product of single - particle levels each of which belongs to a symmetric @xmath56 irrep of @xmath0 .",
    "this allows the matrix elements of the @xmath0 generators to be calculated using properties of the @xmath30 only ( fig.[su(3 ) matrix elements ] ) .",
    "a key feature is the fact that the six non - diagonal generators of @xmath0 ( recall that @xmath31 and @xmath6 are diagonal ) are rising or lowering generators of @xmath30 subgroups of @xmath0 .",
    "the three @xmath30 subgroups and their respective actions are shown in fig . [",
    "su(3 ) matrix elements ] .",
    "states that are collinear with one of the sides of the triangular shape shown on the right in the figure form an irrep of the corresponding @xmath30 subgroup .",
    "so far we have constructed single - particle states and evaluated matrix elements of the generators of @xmath0 when they act on these states .",
    "the next step is to construct many - particle hws of @xmath57 . in the chosen scheme",
    "there are seven extreme states which correspond to the vertexes of the three - dimensional diagram ( fig.[3d - view of su(3 ) irrep ] ) of a general @xmath58 irrep .",
    "we are particularly interested in the vertex that has the maximum value for the quadruple moment of the system ( fig.[3d - view of su(3 ) irrep ] ) .",
    "our hws is the state with @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 .",
    "this hws ( maximum value of @xmath25 for maximum @xmath50 ) can be easily constructed by ensuring that the action of the @xmath0 rising generators annihilate it .",
    "indeed , for such a hws the values of @xmath62 and @xmath63 can be determined from its @xmath50 and @xmath25 labels .",
    "selecting the leading @xmath58 irrep ( hws with maximum overall value of @xmath36 ) out of all possible irreps of an @xmath1 fermion system with total system spin @xmath4 is very simple within the chosen scheme .",
    "this is because the number of particles with spin up @xmath64 and spin down @xmath65 is uniquely determined by the solution of two linear equations : @xmath66 where the second equation expresses the fact that we also require the state to be highest weight with respect to @xmath67 .",
    "further , maximizing the value of @xmath6 is achieved by filling the single - particle states of the @xmath56 irrep ( fig.[single particle levels ] ) from bottom to top .",
    "the chosen scheme ensures that this simple procedure gives maximum values for @xmath50 and @xmath25 .",
    "the @xmath0 irrep labels @xmath58 are obtained by evaluating the quadruple moment @xmath6 and projection of the angular momentum @xmath31 , as these are additive quantum numbers .",
    "for example , in the @xmath68shell , there are six single - particle levels corresponding to the @xmath69 irrep of @xmath0 .",
    "the hws of the leading irrep for @xmath70 particles and total system spin @xmath71 is @xmath72 ( fig.[n=6&s=1 ] ) , whereas for @xmath73 the leading @xmath0 irrep is @xmath74 ( fig.[n=6&s=0 ] ) .",
    "these many - particle configurations are hws with respect to @xmath0 as well as @xmath67 .",
    "once we have the hws of @xmath0 @xmath75 @xmath67 , we can generate any other state of the @xmath0 irrep @xmath23 by applying step operators similar to those given by hecht . by using the parameterization ( [ pqm - parametriztion ] ) @xcite",
    ", we can identify the corresponding step operators , fig .",
    "[ su(3 ) step operators ] .",
    "it is important to note that applying @xmath76move or @xmath77move step operators to states on the top surface yields other states ( or zero ) on that same surface .",
    "since the states on the top surface are hws with respect to @xmath30 in the @xmath0 @xmath78 @xmath79 reduction , the @xmath80move step operator is an @xmath30 lowering operator which changes the projection of the angular momentum , @xmath25 .",
    "the @xmath76move and @xmath77move step operators can be obtained by imposing the restriction that they generate only transformations within the @xmath30 hws space . from an algebraic perspective , the @xmath76move and the @xmath80move operators are linear in @xmath0 generators while the @xmath77move operator is quadratic .",
    "nevertheless , the state generation process can be written in such a way that the @xmath77move operator effectively reduces to a linear action .",
    "these step operators can also be obtained by a projection operator technique @xcite .      since the action of @xmath0 commutes with that of the spin , @xmath67 , it is not difficult to achieve the final goal of states with good total angular momentum projection , @xmath7",
    ". recall that we started with the hws of @xmath0 @xmath75 @xmath67 .",
    "we then introduced a procedure to generate other states of the @xmath0 irrep by applying step operators .",
    "each of these states remains a hws of @xmath67 . by applying spin lowering operators to @xmath0 states with @xmath81",
    ", we can generate states with labels : @xmath1 , @xmath4 , @xmath58 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath25 , and @xmath7 .",
    "a fortran code that uses the above algorithm was run on three platforms : macintosh iici , power macintosh 8500 , and sun workstation . here",
    "we give some of the run - time characteristics of the code for shells below the @xmath82shell :    * on a @xmath83 mhz macintosh iici with math co - processor , @xmath84 mb of memory suffices and the longest run time for generating all states of any leading @xmath0 irrep was less than @xmath85 min . * on a @xmath86 mhz power macintosh @xmath87 , @xmath88 mb of memory was sufficient and the longest run time for generating all states of any leading @xmath0 irrep was less than @xmath89 sec .",
    "* on a @xmath86 mhz sun workstation the longest run time for generating all states of any leading @xmath0 irrep was less than @xmath90 sec .",
    "all states with good @xmath7 for any leading irrep of @xmath0 @xmath75 @xmath67 for the @xmath91 and @xmath92 shells can be generated in less than @xmath93 min .    beyond the @xmath92shell ( @xmath94 )",
    ", the number of configurations in a single @xmath0 state may exceed @xmath95 .",
    "the storage requirement must be pushed up accordingly .",
    "more storage is also needed because beyond the @xmath82shell the number of single - particle states exceed @xmath96 ( @xmath97 with the spin degree of freedom ) which means more than a single word is required to represent many - particle configurations .",
    "an @xmath0 basis state generator for producing states with good projection of the total angular momentum , @xmath98 , and therefore one that is suitable for integration into modern @xmath14-scheme shell - model codes , is suggested as a possible way to obtain simultaneously a description of collective and single - particle nuclear phenomena .",
    "indeed , a basis state generator that uses the algorithm described above and generates @xmath0 states as a sum of slater determinants ( many - particle configurations ) with good @xmath7 is available .",
    "the basis state generation procedure consists of four main components as follows :    * symmetric irreps of @xmath0 are chosen as single - particle shell - model states , * many - particle state is constructed as hws of @xmath0 @xmath75 @xmath67 , * @xmath0 step operators are applied to obtain other states within an @xmath0 irrep , * and finally , states with good @xmath7 are then obtained by @xmath67 lowering operators .",
    "there are additional things that need to be done , especially the generation of other then leading irreps of @xmath0 .",
    "this can be achieved by employing an algorithm for generating non - leading hws that is part of an @xmath0 reduced matrix element package @xcite or perhaps by using another more direct approach tailored to the present application .",
    "the generation of other hws is important if one wishes to include states that are not maximally deformed in their intrinsic configuration in a calculation .",
    "for example , these will be important if the non-@xmath9 parts of the interaction play a significant role .",
    "the generation of good proton - neutron @xmath0 and @xmath7 states can be achieved in a variety of ways .",
    "one scheme , the so - called strong coupling limit uses standard @xmath0 coupling procedures to couple the proton and neutron irreps to final irreps : proton states , @xmath99 @xmath100 @xmath101 @xmath102 , are coupled with neutron states , @xmath103 @xmath104 @xmath105 @xmath106 , to final states @xmath107 @xmath4 @xmath23 @xmath108 .",
    "another procedure would be to extend what was done here for @xmath109 to @xmath110 reduced with respect to @xmath109 @xmath111 @xmath112 , the supermultiplet scheme .",
    "the latter is not simple because the @xmath110 hws is not the one of primary interest in nuclear physics and therefore it must be reduced , which requires procedures like those developed here for a non - canonical reduction of @xmath110 .",
    "the underlying goal is to be able to carry out shell - model calculations using @xmath14-scheme techniques with @xmath0 symmetry adapted basis states included in the basis .",
    "the @xmath0 basis state generator described here provides good start in that direction , and therefore the beginning of an symmetry adapted @xmath14-scheme code that is an integral part of our red stick shell - model project ."
