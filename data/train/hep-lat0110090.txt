    "numerous model calculations suggest that the ground state of qcd at high baryonic density is characterized by diquark condensation which spontaneously breaks gauge and/or baryon number symmetry ( see @xcite for recent reviews ) . in @xcite",
    "we presented evidence that two - color qcd with one flavor of adjoint staggered fermions has interesting qcd - like features , in particular the absence of baryonic goldstone modes in the spectrum . here",
    "we extend the study of this model to include possible diquark condensates .",
    "we refer to @xcite for a detailed description of the model and its properties , while we summarize here only the main features : @xmath0 flavors of staggered fermion , in the adjoint representation of the su(2 ) gauge group , have a u(2@xmath0 ) chiral - flavor symmetry ( at zero mass @xmath1 and zero chemical potential @xmath2 ) .",
    "this is explicitly ( spontaneously ) broken by the mass ( the chiral condensate ) to sp(2@xmath0 ) .",
    "ssb gives rise to @xmath3 goldstone modes , of which @xmath4 are baryonically charged .",
    "when @xmath5 and @xmath6 the vacuum starts rotating from the chiral condensate direction to that of a diquark condensate @xcite , which in the case of @xmath7 is ( modulo a baryonic rotation ) : @xmath8,\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is the completely anti - symmetric tensor in flavor space .",
    "if @xmath10 no baryonic goldstone mode is expected , and no local , gauge invariant , lorentz scalar diquark condensate is possible .",
    "therefore no early onset ( @xmath11 ) transition is expected .",
    "one interesting possibility is a gauge non singlet  hence color superconducting  diquark condensate : @xmath12,\\ ] ] where @xmath13 are color generators .",
    "note however that the fermionic determinant of the @xmath10 model ( although real ) does not have a definite sign .",
    "the indication in @xcite was that the effect of the sign is indeed important .",
    "if we ignore the sign , the model is well described by chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath14pt ) @xcite , including the presence of baryonic goldstone modes .",
    "the latter are suppressed only by the inclusion of the sign . here",
    "we want to complement the previous analysis with the study of diquark condensation @xcite .",
    "we studied the @xmath10 model by means of both hmc @xcite and tsmb @xcite algorithms . because of lack of ergodicity , with hmc we could explore only the positive determinant phase .",
    "tsmb is defined by a set of parameters ( degrees of polynomia @xmath15 , the number of heatbath and overrelaxation iterations for the bosonic fields @xmath16 and @xmath17 , the number of metropolis iterations for the gauge fields @xmath18 and the number of noisy corrections @xmath19 ) .",
    "one has to tune such parameters in order to minimize the autocorrelation .",
    "the latter must be expressed in term of matrix multiplications .",
    "the number of matrix multiplications per sweep is roughly given by : @xmath20    .runs at @xmath21 on a @xmath22 lattice . [ cols=\">,>,>,>,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]      + @xmath23 is the effective number of _ independent _ configurations .",
    "@xmath24 is the fraction with a negative determinant and @xmath25 the average reweighting factor including the sign .",
    "in general when the chemical potential increases the lowest eigenvalues ( @xmath26 ) approach zero and the simulations become difficult . in table",
    "[ table : autocorr ] we show how the condition number ( @xmath27 , @xmath28 being the largest eigenvalue ) as well as the plaquette autocorrelation change by increasing @xmath2 .",
    "the autocorrelation of fermionic observables is typically about 10 times shorter . from table  [",
    "table : runparam ] we see that until the point @xmath29 the average sign is still not too small , while points above @xmath30 are already exceedingly difficult .",
    "our model has very interesting features , which distinguish it from other su(2 ) models .",
    "it also has a sign problem .",
    "it is natural and interesting to study the effect of the inclusion of the sign .",
    "we distinguish two models : the one where only positive ( determinant ) configurations are sampled and the one where both positive and negative configurations are included with their sign .",
    "the positive sector turns out to be in very good agreement with @xmath14pt predictions ; i.e. , the positive model behaves effectively like an @xmath7 model .    in order to study possible diquark condensations we introduced a source @xmath31 for @xmath32",
    "this is done in a partially quenched way : by introducing the source only in the measurements .",
    "@xmath14pt predicts also the dependence on @xmath31 of the chiral and the diquark condensate @xcite .",
    "in particular the sum @xmath33 must , to lowest order in @xmath14pt , be a constant independent of both on @xmath2 and @xmath31 ( for nlo see @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , as one can see on fig .  [",
    "fig : sumjmu ] , this relation is very well satisfied in the positive sector .    , dashed ( decreasing ) lines are @xmath34 ( at different values of @xmath2 between 0 and 0.5 ) .",
    "solid lines are the sum in ( [ eq : sum ] ) .",
    "the error bars do not take into account the autocorrelation.,scaledwidth=45.0%,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the validity of the relation ( [ eq : sum ] ) also allows an extrapolation of @xmath35 to zero @xmath31 , which would otherwise be quite difficult .",
    "since the condensate @xmath36 is not gauge invariant we studied its susceptibility @xmath37 @xmath38 this has a finite value even without a source term . in the low density regime @xmath37 shows little variation with @xmath2 .",
    "once we reach the @xmath14pt transition point , @xmath37 drops rapidly in the positive sector .",
    "we interprete this as an effect of pauli blocking or phase space suppression : as the ground state is filled up by fermions there is less phase space left to accommodate the fermion loops that contribute to @xmath37 .",
    "when the sign is properly taken into account this effect disappears and @xmath37 remains stable through the transition ( fig .",
    "[ fig : subpbp ] ) .",
    "the interesting lesson one can learn from this model is that the early onset transition , typical of all other su(2 ) models , is indeed delayed as expected from the analysis of possible diquark condensates .",
    "numerically this is obtained by a delicate balance between configurations with positive and negative determinant .",
    "this makes simulations prohibitively expensive in the region where one would expect a true onset transition at high density .",
    "this work is supported by the tmr network `` finite temperature phase transitions in particle physics '' eu contract erbfmrx - ct97 - 0122 .",
