    "this paper reports about research conducted on the edge between algebraic graph theory ( briefly agt ) and computer algebra .",
    "association schemes are one of the traditional areas of investigation in agt . for a good decade ,",
    "catalogues of small association schemes have been available from the web site @xcite .",
    "it is known that all association schemes of order up to 14 are schurian , that is , they are coming from a suitable transitive permutation group in the standard manner .",
    "first examples of non - schurian association schemes exist on 15 , 16 and 18 vertices .",
    "in particular , there are just two classes of non - schurian association schemes of order 18 .",
    "d. pasechnik explained in evident form in @xcite how the non - schurian rank 3 antisymmetric association scheme on 15 points appears , and determined its full automorphism group .",
    "the famous shrikhande graph generates non - schurian rank 3 association schemes on 16 points .",
    "in fact , there are many other non - schurian schemes of order 16 ( see @xcite )",
    ". their clever computer free explanation might be of definite interest .",
    "surprisingly , such an explanation has not been given for the schemes on 18 points yet .",
    "we are here filling this gap , providing an interpretation in terms of finite geometries .",
    "moreover , we are introducing a possible generalisation of these schemes which is leading to four infinite families of non - schurian association schemes on @xmath3 points , where @xmath4 is a prime .",
    "this paper originated from computer aided experiments , which were fulfilled by the author .gy .  under the guidance of m.k .",
    "the manner in which the computer search helped to reach the presented results is , in our eyes , of independent interest .",
    "the suggested structure of our paper was designed intentionally not only to reflect the obtained scientific results , but also to pursue additional pedagogical , expository and even philosophical goals .",
    "preliminaries and the used computer tools are briefly discussed in sections 2 and 3 , respectively .",
    "our starting geometrical object is a biaffine coherent configuration @xmath5 , which appears via the intransitive permutation group @xmath6 of order @xmath7 and degree @xmath3 having two orbits of length  @xmath8 .",
    "object @xmath5 is considered in sections 48 , along with its four related color graphs  @xmath9 , @xmath10 , which turn out to be association schemes . in particular , an outline of a proof that these association schemes are non - schurian is given in section 8 .",
    "the presentation in sections 48 is of a definite geometric nature , based on a consideration of the classical biaffine plane of order @xmath0 with @xmath8 points and @xmath8 lines .    in section 9 ,",
    "all discussed structures are developed from the scratch with the aid of an independent second model of @xmath5 , which is of a more algebraic nature .",
    "here our starting structure is the finite heisenberg group of order @xmath7 .",
    "sections 10 and 11 are devoted to the use of algebraic groups of coherent configurations . here",
    "we suggest some innovative methodological elements , which might be of an independent interest for experts in agt .",
    "sections 12 and 13 are aimed to extend the scope of our consideration , paying special attention to some extra features of our results , as well as to a number of well known classes of graphs which appear to be relevant to new association schemes discovered by the authors .",
    "some of the considered graphs play a significant role in extremal graph theory .",
    "section 14 serves as a research announcement of another portion of achieved results regarding new non - schurian association schemes of constant rank 6 and 5 , and some of their properties .",
    "the level of rigour here is different from the main body of the text . in particular",
    ", no attempt is made to provide full formulations and outlines of proofs .",
    "finally , the last section 15 is written in a very specific style , quite typical of other publications co - authored by m.k .",
    "it is , in a sense , a mosaic of diverse topics , implicitly or explicitly related to the content of the paper , however not previously touched in evident form .",
    "special attention is paid to the research paradigm `` computer experiment , plausible reasonings , theoretical proof '' , comparing views , experience , and tastes of the authors with modern trends in science , which are correlated with the exploitation of computer tools .",
    "appendices 13 contain some routine data about the investigated schemes .",
    "these data will play an essential role in portions of the theoretical proofs .",
    "below we provide a brief outline of the most significant concepts that will be used throughout the text . we refer to @xcite and @xcite for a more detailed background .    by a _ color graph _",
    "@xmath11 we will mean an ordered pair @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is a set of vertices and  @xmath14 a partition of @xmath15 into binary relations .",
    "the elements of  @xmath14 will be called _",
    "colors _ , and the number of colors will be the _ rank _ of @xmath11 . in other words ,",
    "a color graph is an edge - colored complete directed graph with loops , whose arcs are colored by the same color if and only if they belong to the same binary relation .",
    "a _ coherent configuration _ is a color graph @xmath16 , @xmath17 , such that the following axioms are satisfied :    * the diagonal relation @xmath18 is a union of relations @xmath19 , for a suitable subset @xmath20 .",
    "* for each @xmath21 there exists @xmath22 such that @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the relation transposed to @xmath25 . * for any @xmath26 , the number @xmath27 of elements @xmath28 such that @xmath29 and @xmath30 is a constant depending only on @xmath31 , and independent on the choice of @xmath32 .",
    "the numbers @xmath27 are called _ intersection numbers _ , or sometimes _ structure constants _ of @xmath33 .    assume that @xmath34 , and let us put @xmath35 . to each _ basic graph _",
    "@xmath36 we associate its adjacency matrix @xmath37 .",
    "then the set of _ basic matrices _",
    "@xmath38 may be regarded as a basis of a matrix algebra @xmath39 which contains the identity matrix , the all - ones matrix  @xmath40 , and is closed under transposition and schur - hadamard multiplication of matrices .",
    "such an algebra is called a _ coherent algebra _ , and we refer to the set @xmath38 as its _ standard basis_.    the concepts of coherent configuration and coherent algebra were introduced by d. higman ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "similar concepts were introduced independently by b.ju .",
    "weisfeiler and a.a .",
    "leman , see @xcite and also @xcite for an historical discussion .",
    "a significant source of coherent configurations appears as follows .",
    "assume that @xmath41 is a permutation group acting on the set @xmath42 .",
    "for @xmath43 the set @xmath44 , where @xmath45 , is called a _",
    "2-orbit _ of @xmath46 , specifically the _ 2-orbit _ of @xmath46 _ corresponding to _ @xmath47 .",
    "( note that when @xmath41 is a transitive permutation group , many authors prefer the term _ orbital _ for this set . )    denoting by 2-@xmath48 the set of 2-orbits of a permutation group @xmath49 , it is easy to check that @xmath502-@xmath51 is a coherent configuration .",
    "coherent configurations that arise in this manner are called _ schurian _ , otherwise we call them _ non - schurian_.    an _ association scheme _ @xmath52 ( also called a _ homogeneous coherent configuration _ ) is a coherent configuration in which the diagonal relation @xmath53 belongs to @xmath14 .",
    "thus , schurian association schemes are coming from transitive permutation groups .",
    "a coherent configuration @xmath33 is called _ commutative _ if for all @xmath26 we have @xmath54 .",
    "we call @xmath33 _ symmetric _ if @xmath55 for all @xmath21 .",
    "it is a well known fact that a symmetric coherent configuration is also commutative , but the converse is not true in general .    to each coherent configuration @xmath33",
    "we may assign three groups : @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "the ( combinatorial ) _ group of automorphisms _",
    "@xmath58 consists of the permutations @xmath59 which preserve the relations , i.e. @xmath60 for all @xmath61 .",
    "the _ color automorphisms _ are permitted to permute the relations from @xmath14 , i.e. for @xmath59 we have @xmath62 if and only if for all @xmath21 there exists @xmath63 such that @xmath64 .",
    "algebraic automorphism _ is a bijection @xmath65 that satisfies @xmath66 .",
    "it is easy to verify that @xmath58 is a normal subgroup of @xmath67 , and that the quotient group @xmath68 embeds naturally in @xmath57 .    for each group @xmath69 of algebraic automorphisms of @xmath16 one",
    "can define an _ algebraic merging _ of @xmath14 in the following way .",
    "let @xmath70 denote the set of orbits of @xmath69 on @xmath14 .",
    "for each @xmath71 define @xmath72 to be the union of all relations from @xmath73 .",
    "then the set of relations @xmath74 forms a coherent configuration on @xmath42",
    ". we will call it an _ algebraic merging _ of @xmath14 with respect to @xmath69 . note that if @xmath75 and @xmath33 is schurian , then the resulting merging is schurian as well .",
    "in contrast , a merging with respect to a subgroup of @xmath69 not contained in @xmath68 may lead to a non - schurian coherent configuration .",
    "it is clear from the definitions that an association scheme @xmath33 is schurian if and only if its rank coincides with the rank of its group of automorphisms @xmath58 .",
    "this project heavily depends on the use of computer tools . moreover ,",
    "in a sense it can serve as a pattern for the use of computers in agt .",
    "indeed , we made a lot of fast computations ; investigated and organized the obtained results ; analyzed all relevant data ; made conjectures based on these data ; checked these conjectures for higher values of parameters of the considered series ; transformed these conjectures to a suitable analytical form ; transformed the obtained results from numerical to symbolic mode ; created pictures and tables ; and so on .",
    "here we are mainly working with coherent configurations and association schemes , as well as with the permutation groups related to them .",
    "for this purpose , in 199092 a computer package was created in moscow as a result of the activities of i.a .",
    "faradev and the author m.k .",
    "this package goes by the name coco , and was introduced in @xcite ; see also @xcite for deeper consideration of the used methodology and algorithms .",
    "coco is still very helpful for performing initial computational experiments .",
    "nevertheless , nowadays the mainstream of our computer aided activities is based on the use of the free software gap @xcite ( groups , algorithms and programming ) , in particular its share package grape @xcite which works in conjunction with nauty @xcite .",
    "in addition , we strongly benefitted from the kind permission granted by sven reichard to use his unpublished package coco  iir @xcite ( still under development ) which operates under the gap platform .",
    "the foremost goal of coco  iir is to extend the scope of algorithms from coco , relying on many new developments and fresh ideas adopted from modern computer algebra .",
    "last but not least , we are pleased to acknowledge a package of programs for computing with association schemes , written by hanaki and miyamoto .",
    "it is open - source software that may be freely downloaded from the homepage of the authors @xcite .",
    "this package also works under gap , and contains some tools that have not yet been implemented in coco  iir .",
    "let @xmath0 be an odd prime , and let @xmath76 be the cyclic group of order @xmath0 . throughout this text ,",
    "the set of nonzero elements in @xmath76 will be denoted by @xmath77 .",
    "take two copies @xmath78 and @xmath79 of @xmath80 .",
    "the first copy @xmath78 is none other than the point set of the classical ( desarguesian ) affine plane of order @xmath0 .",
    "each element @xmath81 may be identified uniquely with a pair of coordinates of the form @xmath82 $ ] .",
    "thus , we refer to the elements of @xmath78 as _ points_. let @xmath79 be the set of _ `` non - vertical '' lines _ in the affine plane , i.e. @xmath83 if and only if the equation for @xmath84 may be expressed as @xmath85 for some @xmath86 .",
    "each line @xmath84 is determined uniquely by a pair @xmath87 . in order to distinguish points and lines we will use square brackets for points and parentheses for lines .",
    "this geometry , in which one parallel class of the affine plane has been removed ( in our case , the class of `` vertical '' lines ) goes by the well established name _",
    "biaffine plane_. we denote it by  @xmath88 ( see figure  [ fig.1 ] depicting  @xmath89 ) . for more details about biaffine planes and their relation to other combinatorial structures ,",
    "we recommend @xcite ; see also additional comments at the end of this paper .",
    ".,width=491 ]    given a point @xmath82 $ ] and a line @xmath87 of the biaffine plane , we define a _ quasidistance _ @xmath90 by the formulas : @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "note that @xmath93 does not define a metric ( indeed , it is not symmetric and non - negativity does not make sense in @xmath76 ) .",
    "thus , it is just a vague analogue .",
    "recall that a natural source of coherent configurations is coming from permutation groups .",
    "if we take any permutation group @xmath41 , then @xmath94 2-@xmath95 is its associated ( schurian ) coherent configuration . in particular ,",
    "if @xmath41 is transitive , then @xmath33 is an association scheme .",
    "let us now consider an action of the group @xmath96 on the set @xmath97 , most conveniently described in terms of generators .",
    "to each pair @xmath98 we associate a _ translation _  @xmath99 acting naturally on @xmath78 as @xmath100\\mapsto [ x+a , y+b]$ ] , while the induced action on @xmath79 is @xmath101 .",
    "of course , the set of all translations forms an abelian group of order @xmath8 under composition of permutations ( denoted @xmath102 ) and is isomorphic to @xmath103 .",
    "further , let @xmath104 be defined by @xmath105\\mapsto [ x , y - x]$ ] .",
    "the corresponding permutation on lines is @xmath106 .",
    "clearly , @xmath107 is a permutation of order @xmath0 and it is immediate that @xmath108 .",
    "our group @xmath109 above is generated by all translations together with the permutation @xmath107 .",
    "note that all elements of @xmath109 may be expressed in the form @xmath110 , where @xmath111 are suitable elements of  @xmath76 .",
    "moreover , to distinct triples of @xmath111 correspond distinct elements of @xmath109 .",
    "in other words , @xmath112 and @xmath113 . now set @xmath114 .",
    "then multiplication in @xmath109 is given by @xmath115 .",
    "observe that the action of @xmath109 is intransitive on @xmath42 with two orbits @xmath78 and @xmath79 .    in",
    "what follows , the introduced permutation group @xmath116 will be called the _ heisenberg group modulo @xmath0 _ ; see section 9 for more details .",
    "[ prop1 ] let @xmath0 be an odd prime .",
    "then    * the rank of @xmath116 is @xmath117 , * the @xmath118-orbits of @xmath116 may be divided into six different types of classes @xmath119 and @xmath120 , which are characterized by suitable relations between coordinates of objects in @xmath42",
    ".    * proof .",
    "* let @xmath121 $ ] , @xmath122\\in\\mathcal p$ ] and @xmath123 , @xmath124 .",
    "then the types of classes are the following :    * @xmath125 and @xmath126 , where @xmath127 ( i.e. , those pairs of points whose first coordinates are equal and second coordinates differ by @xmath128 in the given order ; note that @xmath129 is the diagonal relation on @xmath78 ) , * @xmath130 , where @xmath131 ( i.e. , those pairs of points whose first coordinates differ by @xmath128 in the given order ) , * @xmath132 and @xmath133 , where @xmath127 ( i.e. , those pairs of lines whose first coordinates are equal and second coordinates differ by @xmath128 in the given order ; note that @xmath134 is the diagonal relation on @xmath79 ) , * @xmath135 , where @xmath131 ( i.e. , those pairs of lines whose first coordinates differ by @xmath128 in the given order ) , * @xmath136 , where @xmath127 ( i.e. , those point - line pairs whose quasidistance @xmath137 is @xmath128 ) , * @xmath138 , where @xmath127 ( i.e. , those point - line pairs whose quasidistance @xmath139 is @xmath128 ) .    to complete the proof , one must verify two things : that the @xmath117 relations introduced above indeed form a partition of the set @xmath140 , and that each such relation is in fact a 2-orbit of @xmath116 .",
    "* remark 1 .",
    "* one can easily check from its definition that the permutation @xmath107 has exactly @xmath0 fixed points in its action on @xmath78 , as well as @xmath0 fixed points in its action on @xmath79 . relying on the bijection between 2-orbits of a transitive permutation group and orbits ( 1-orbits ) of the stabilizer of an arbitrary point ( see e.g. @xcite ) , the reader can easily deduce that there exists exactly @xmath141 2-orbits of the transitive action @xmath142 , and similarly for the action @xmath143 .",
    "thus , we obtain in this manner @xmath144 2-orbits of @xmath116 . observing that there are @xmath0 2-orbits of type @xmath145 and @xmath0 of type @xmath120",
    ", we arrive at the desired amount of @xmath117 .",
    "* remark 2 . * reflexive 2-orbits @xmath129 and @xmath134 are obviously symmetric , however all remaining 2-orbits are antisymmetric .",
    "namely , we obtain that @xmath146 , @xmath147 , @xmath148 , @xmath149 , @xmath150 and @xmath151 . here and below ,",
    "operations on subscripts are performed as in @xmath76 .",
    "this description provides a quite nice geometrical interpretation of the relations . in the sections to follow",
    ", we will define certain families of color graphs as suitable mergings of these relations .",
    "we will prove that these color graphs are in fact association schemes , and we will investigate them further .    note that at the end of the paper we will once again justify a portion of our obtained results , this time relying on a more purely algebraic approach .",
    "denote by @xmath5 the coherent configuration corresponding to the group @xmath109 in our construction above .",
    "for obvious reasons , we shall refer to @xmath5 as a _ biaffine coherent configuration_.",
    "the biaffine coherent configuration @xmath5 was constructed with the aid of a group , that is , it is schurian . presently , we are interested in the intersection numbers of @xmath5 . in this section",
    "we display these numbers with the aid of tables . in each individual table",
