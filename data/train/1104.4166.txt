    "@xcite it was shown that for a given initial hypersurface @xmath22 to give rise to a soliton solution of the mean curvature flow it is necessary that @xmath23 where @xmath24 denotes the @xmath25-orthogonal projection onto the normal bundle of the hypersurface @xmath13 .",
    "if @xmath3 is killing , then is also sufficient .",
    "soliton solutions have played an important rle in the development of the theory of the m.c.f .",
    "such solutions served , e.g. , as tailor - made comparison solutions to investigate the development of singularities ( e.g.  angenent s self - similarly shrinking doughnut , see  @xcite ) .",
    "actually , soliton solutions appear as blow - up of so called type ii singularities of the flow of plane curves ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , soliton solutions turn out to enjoy certain stability properties and allow some insight into the behaviour of the mean curvature flow viewed as a dynamical system ( see  @xcite , @xcite and  @xcite ) .    in  @xcite the boundary value problem for rotating soliton solutions has been discussed .",
    "the corresponding local existence result has been generalised to arbitrary killing fields in  @xcite . for rotating solitons in the euclidean plane , so called yin - yang curves ,",
    "a quantity was identified that remains invariant along the curve ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "this invariant allowed to show that yin - yang curves share fundamental geometric properties with geodesic curves . in",
    "@xcite the corresponding results have been generalised to arbitrary soliton curves on surfaces ( see figure  [ fig - yinyang ] ) .",
    "in addition , it was observed in  @xcite , that translating solitons in the euclidean plane , the so called grim reaper curves , actually are geodesics with respect to a conformally deformed riemannian metric",
    ". therefore the natural question arose whether soliton curves are ( at least locally ) _ always _ geodesic curves with respect to a modified riemannian metric .",
    "this is not the case . on a surface @xmath0 ,",
    "the solutions of are immersed curves on @xmath16 which may be reparametrised to become geodesics of the weyl connection @xmath26 given by @xmath27 where we have written @xmath28 for the levi - civita connection of @xmath25 .",
    "the equation is parametrisation invariant and thus its solutions are naturally interpreted as the geodesics of a projective structure on @xmath16 .",
    "recall that a projective structure is an equivalence class of affine torsion - free connections , where two such connections are said to be equivalent if they have the same geodesics up to parametrisation . recently in  @xcite ,",
    "bryant , dunajski and eastwood determined the necessary and sufficient local conditions for an affine torsion - free connection to be projectively equivalent to a levi - civita connection . applying their results",
    "it follows that the weyl connection whose geodesics are the yin - yang curves is not projectively equivalent to a levi - civita connection . however jrgen moser conjectured that soliton curves can at least locally be interpreted as geodesics of a finsler metric .",
    "recent results about finsler metrisability of path geometries by lvarez paiva and berck  @xcite show that this is indeed the case .",
    "of course , one can ask analogue questions also for higher dimensional solitons . before we do that ,",
    "we generalise the notion of soliton solutions slightly .",

    "it was observed in  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) that solitons with respect to gradient vector fields correspond to minimal hypersurfaces .",
    "however it was left open if such a correspondence holds when the vector field is not the gradient of a smooth function . in this short article",
    "we provide an answer using the framework of monge - ampre differential systems .",
    "in  2 we will associate to the @xmath3-pseudosoliton hypersurface equation on @xmath0 a monge - ampre system on the unit tangent bundle of @xmath16 whose legendre integral manifolds , which satisfy a natural transversality condition , locally correspond to @xmath3-pseudosoliton hypersurfaces on @xmath16 .",
