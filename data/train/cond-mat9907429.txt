    "in 1952 lee and yang @xcite proved that the zeroes of the partition function of a ferromagnetic ising model ( or equivalently , a lattice gas with single - site hard cores ) as a function of complex magnetic field @xmath0 ( or chemical potential @xmath1 ) are confined to the imaginary @xmath0 axis for real temperatures @xmath2 .",
    "yang and lee argued @xcite that for a system above its critical temperature @xmath3 , the partition function must be nonzero throughout some neighborhood of the real axis in the complex reduced magnetic - field plane , @xmath4 thus for @xmath5 , a gap free of zeros will be found on the imaginary @xmath6 axis with edges at , say , @xmath7 .",
    "equivalently , in fluid - language , for @xmath8 , there will be a gap in the complex activity plane with edges at @xmath9 as illustrated in fig . 1 . here",
    "we define the reduced activity in @xmath10 spatial dimensions by @xmath11 where @xmath12 , while @xmath13 is a microscopic reference volume ( taken as the cell volume for a lattice gas ) and @xmath14 is the thermal de broglie wavelength .",
    "if one defines the density of yang - lee zeros , @xmath15 , so that when @xmath16 , the number of spins ( or lattice sites ) becomes infinite , @xmath17 approaches the number of zeros between @xmath18 and @xmath19 on the imaginary @xmath6 axis , one must have @xmath20 .",
    "kortman and griffiths @xcite pointed out that the density of zeros beyond the gap should be expected to exhibit a power law singularity  the yang - lee edge singularity @xcite  of the form @xmath21 this singularity proves analogous to an ordinary critical point obeying scaling laws and exponent relations although there is only one relevant scaling field [ 3 , 4 ] . thus the basic exponent @xmath22 in ( 4 ) satisfies @xmath23@xcite .    in a general renormalization group analysis , it was shown @xcite that the field theory controlling the yang - lee fixed point is described by a pure imaginary @xmath24 coupling .",
    "this leads to a critical dimension @xmath25 above which the classical , mean - field value @xcite @xmath26 applies .",

    "if the pair interaction potentials are purely repulsive ( i.e. , positive ) , the ( reduced ) cluster integrals , @xmath37 , in the activity or fugacity series for the ( reduced ) pressure , namely , @xmath38 are known @xcite to alternate in sign : this implies a dominant singularity on the _ negative _ @xmath39-axis that determines the radius of convergence , @xmath40 , of the series : see fig .",

    "exponent @xmath45 .",
    "subsequent confirmation came from baram and luban @xcite who investigated further models including dimers on lattices , parallel hypercubes in continuum space and the _ soft_-core single - component gaussian - molecule model .",
    "more recently , lai and fisher @xcite found similar behavior in a _",
    "gaussian - molecule mixture using very long series expansions for @xmath46 . in that case the singularity at @xmath47 was drawn out into a continuous locus ; but the estimates for @xmath48 supported the universality hypothesis .",
    "( precise estimates , for the leading  correction - to - scaling \" exponent @xmath49 , in ( 6 ) for all @xmath10 , including @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 , were also generated @xcite . )",
    "however , lai and fisher @xcite noticed in particular that , when compared with previous knowledge about the yang - lee edge exponent @xmath53 , the exact results for @xmath54 for @xmath55 and @xmath56 @xcite and for @xmath57 @xcite , and the various numerical estimates @xcite for @xmath58 , strongly suggested the identification @xmath59 hence they proposed @xcite that the _ universal repulsive - core singularity belongs to the yang - lee edge critical universality class_.    in analytical support of this identification ( for general @xmath10 ) they appealed to earlier work by kurtze and fisher @xcite who had proved that when @xmath60 the yang - lee edge singularity in ferromagnetic ising models precisely describes the dominant singularity on the negative @xmath39 axis of a fluid of _ hard dimers _ on the same lattice , each dimer occupying one bond and two adjacent lattice sites .",
    "this correspondence with a dimer gas was carried further by shapir @xcite who used field - theoretic arguments to demonstrate the identity generically for all @xmath61 .",
    "however , dimers are rather special objects with orientational degrees of freedom ( although these seem , _ post facto _ , to have no effect on @xmath48 @xcite ) . furthermore , shapir s field - theoretic approach was rather special and did not seem extendable to more general particles with soft repulsive cores , with the additional presence of attractive forces , or to systems also displaying critical behavior for positive @xmath39 @xcite ( as illustrated in fig .",
    "1 ) .    in this article",
    "we repair this gap in the theory . specifically , we consider a general single - component fluid with a pair interaction potential , @xmath62 , which contains both repulsive _ and _ attractive parts : of course , repulsive terms are always essential to ensure thermodynamic stability . to be concrete and explicit we analyze lattice systems in which multiple occupancy of a site is forbidden ; however , it must be stressed that the repulsive interactions we consider are _ not _ confined to such trivial single - site hard cores . on the contrary , essentially we suppose only that the potential @xmath63 is of finite range and may be decomposed according to @xmath64 where the sum runs over lattice sites @xmath65 while the repulsive and attractive parts , @xmath66 and @xmath67 , respectively , are both positive ( if they do not vanish identically ) .",
    "more specifically we will use @xmath68 @xmath69 so that @xmath70 and @xmath71 represent the interaction ranges of the repulsive and attractive components .",
    "the real - space potentials acting between sites @xmath72 and @xmath73 ( @xmath74 ) , namely , @xmath75 and @xmath76 , follow by fourier inversion . for @xmath77",
    "one may imagine yukawa forms : @xmath78 and @xmath79 with @xmath80 ; but that is certainly not essential .",
    "likewise , the leading lattice isotropy assumed for convenience in ( 9 ) and ( 10 ) is not necessary .",
    "our treatment extends straightforwardly to multicomponent fluids @xcite and , at least formally , generalizes readily to continuum systems .    on the basis of ( 8)-(10 )",
    ", we develop a field - theoretic analysis and show that there is , in general , a repulsive - core singularity at some @xmath81 on the negative activity axis ( see fig .",
    "1 ) that is described within an lgw renormalization group framework by a fixed point hamiltonian with a purely imaginary cubic coupling , @xmath82 , and , hence , lies in the same universality class as yang - lee edge criticality .",
    "a more or less novel aspect of our treatment is that _ separate_sine - gordan @xcite and kac - hubbard - stratonovich ( khs ) @xcite  transformations are used for handling the repulsive and attractive parts of the interaction potential : compare with refs .",

    "we remark , first , that following the pioneering study of hubbard and schofield @xcite , all authors interested in ordinary gas - liquid criticality have treated the repulsive interactions in a fluid by use of a _ reference system _ : for a recent example , see brilliantov @xcite .",
    "unless this reference fluid is essentially trivial , as for single - site hard cores on a lattice , this entails increasingly detailed knowledge of the correlation functions of the repulsive - core system @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it will be helpful for us to make contact with this approach by , initially , neglecting the nontrivial repulsive interactions embodied in @xmath113 .",
    "if the attractions are _ also _ neglected the grand partition function ( 11 ) reduces simply to @xmath114 .",
    "this predicts a repulsive - core singularity at @xmath115 ( all @xmath2 ) with an exponent @xmath116(log ) @xcite .",
    "evidently , the actual dimensionality , @xmath10 , plays no role .",
    "now , following traditional treatments ( e.g.,@xcite ) let us introduce attractive terms with @xmath117 . the khs transformation",
    "then leads to the saddle - point equation ( 18 ) in which , now , @xmath118 is negative and we can identify @xmath119 directly with @xmath120 ( since @xmath121 and @xmath122 etc .",

    "fig . 2 then provides a graphical representation of ( 18 ) which can be readily analyzed :",
    "note that the bold curve depicts @xmath123 which has a point of inflection at @xmath124 and a corresponding tangent that intersects the axis at @xmath125 : see the dashed line .    by inspection",
    ", one then sees that when @xmath39 increases from @xmath126 ( along the real axis ) for temperatures such that @xmath127 there is always a single saddle - point solution , @xmath128 , which varies analytically with @xmath2 and @xmath39 : see , e.g. , the lines labelled ( a ) and ( b ) in fig .",

    "the fourth order coefficient , @xmath189 , is positive and approaches @xmath190 when @xmath191 , while the cubic term is purely imaginary with a coefficient approaching @xmath192    at this point we have thus reached the same stage as in the original treatment @xcite of the yang - lee edge singularities .",

    "stability of the saddle point requires that the renormalized repulsive range , @xmath219 , in ( 34 ) be real ( and positive ) .",
    "roughly , we expect @xmath220 : the positivity of this factor then represents a previously unstated restriction on the initial potentials . in practice , however , if this ( or the more precise ) condition fails , it may be sufficient , as explained in the discussion of gas - liquid criticality , to perform further , nonperturbative renormalizations to dampen the attractive interactions for @xmath221 and so expose again a saddle - point representation of the repulsive - core singularity at @xmath81 .",
