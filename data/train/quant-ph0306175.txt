    "entanglement is considered to be a fundamental resource of quantum information processing such as quantum cryptography @xcite , quantum teleportation @xcite , quantum computation @xcite and so on . since bennett _",
    "s seminal work @xcite , there have been intensive works on the field of quantum teleportation in theories and experiments @xcite .",
    "entangled states , which are called quantum channels , make it possible to send an unknown state to a long distance .",
    "quantum teleportation via bipartite pure entangled states can be classified into two types ; standard teleportation ( st ) and conclusive teleportation ( ct ) @xcite .",
    "maximally entangled states , _",
    "i.e. _ bell states , are used as quantum channels in standard quantum teleportation . on the other hand",
    "conclusive teleportation utilizes any pure entangled states . due to the fact that non - maximally pure entangled states are used as quantum channels , the random outcome of sender s measurement determines whether an unknown state is teleported surely or not .",
    "entanglement in three qubits is more complicated than that in two qubits .",
    "recently , the entanglement of three qubits  @xcite was classified by separable , bi - separable , @xmath0 , and greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( ghz ) states  @xcite . the ghz class state can not be transformed to the @xmath0 class by the local operation and classical communication .",
    "although many suggestion has utilized the ghz state in quantum teleportation  @xcite and some proposals have suggested an implementation of the @xmath0 state @xcite , the teleportation using the @xmath0 class state has been studied in a few ways  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we study two schemes of teleportation via a @xmath0 state which are classified by two types of measurements . by calculating the total success probability and the average fidelity for each teleportation scheme",
    ", we can explore the entanglement properties of @xmath0 state .",
    "because of the property of the @xmath0 state @xcite , it is shown to be not always successful in recovering of the unknown state .    in the first scheme",
    ", alice teleports an unknown state to charlie with help of bob .",
    "she performs the bell measurement ( bm ) on the unknown state and her part of a @xmath0 state .",
    "this scheme makes it possible to split and to recover quantum information of the unknown state in the teleportation . after alice s bm",
    ", the quantum information of the unknown state is split between bob and charlie .",
    "depending on bob s measurement on his part of the @xmath0 state , charlie recovers the unknown state with a certain probability of success .    in the second scheme , only alice and charlie",
    "participate in teleportation .",
    "she and he take two particles and one particle of the @xmath0 state , respectively .",
    "alice prepares a basis set of an unbalanced @xmath0 state the positive operator valued measurement ( povm ) @xcite on her three particles including the unknown state in teleportation .",
    "this type of the measurement is called an asymmetic povm because the measurement basis is the @xmath0-type with unequal weights .",
    "the asymmetric povm is fully based on an original ct @xcite where the measurement set is built from an orthogonality between a measurement basis and a channel . from calculation of success probability and average fidelity ,",
    "we obtain the maximum values of the protocol , which can not exceed these of the previous scheme .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : ghz ] , we briefly review quantum teleportation via the ghz state . in sec .",

    "[ sec : remarks ] we make some remarks on our results .",
    "we start with a brief review of quantum teleportation with a ghz state in ref .",
    "it is similar to the st with the bell state , but three parties participate in quantum teleportation .",
    "especially , hillery , bu@xmath1ek , and berthiaume emphasized quantum teleportation with the ghz state as splitting and recovering of quantum information as a quantum secret sharing  @xcite .",
    "suppose alice wishes to teleport an unknown qubit to charlie with assistance of bob .",
    "alice begins with the unknown state @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the outcomes ( @xmath4 or @xmath5 ) in measuring @xmath6 .",
    "alice , bob , and charlie share the ghz state given by @xmath7 with her ghz particle and performs the bm on her two particles . before alice",

    "( [ eq : ghz_tot ] ) .",
    "it is interesting that quantum information of an unknown state is split between bob and charlie at this moment and recovered in charlie s place by bob s measurement and charlie s unitary operation .",
    "bob measures his ghz particle in @xmath11-direction and announces his outcome . with the information of two classical bits from alice and one bit from bob",
    ", charlie can make a suitable unitary operation on his qubit to recover the original unknown state as follows @xmath12   |\\phi_{+}\\rangle_{ua}|x_+ \\rangle_{b } \\rightarrow & \\hat{\\sigma}_{x } ,   & |\\phi_{+}\\rangle_{ua}|x_- \\rangle_{b } \\rightarrow \\hat{\\sigma}_{x}\\hat{\\sigma}_{z } , \\\\[6pt ]   |\\psi_{-}\\rangle_{ua}|x_+ \\rangle_{b } \\rightarrow & \\hat{\\sigma}_{z } ,   & |\\psi_{-}\\rangle_{ua}|x_- \\rangle_{b } \\rightarrow   i ,   \\\\[6pt ]   |\\phi_{-}\\rangle_{ua}|x_+ \\rangle_{b } \\rightarrow & \\hat{\\sigma}_{x } \\hat{\\sigma}_{z } ,    \\hspace{0.75 cm } & |\\phi_{-}\\rangle_{ua}|x_- \\rangle_{b } \\rightarrow \\hat{\\sigma}_{x } .",

    "suppose alice and charlie wish to make teleportation via a ghz state without bob .",
    "alice takes two particles of the ghz state @xmath13 and charlie the other one .",
    "teleportation can be implemented if alice changes her set of measurement from bms to the ghz - type measurement as follows , @xmath14 if we use a notation @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) in the place of @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) , the protocol becomes exactly same as st .",
    "therefore , we are able to perform a perfect teleportation via the ghz state .    furthermore , what about teleportation of a partially entangled ghz state ?",
    "in fact , bandyopadhyay s work implies this problem in ref .",
    "he introduced an assisted qubit , which has an equivalent coefficient to a partially entangled channel and alice measures the unknown qubit with the assisted qubit and her channel qubit .",

    "( [ eq : tot_w ] ) .",
    "unlike the st with maximally entangled bell state or with a ghz state , probabilities of four outcomes depend on the unknown state .",
    "the probability @xmath23 that alice s output state is @xmath24 is given by @xmath25 also , probabilities of alice s outcomes as @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 are @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath30 , respectively .",
    "bob s measurement outcome dicides success or failure of teleportation .",
    "if bob s outcome is @xmath31 , the teleportatioin fails . otherwise , charlie can do the following operation on his @xmath0 qubit to get the unknown state according to alice s information .",

    "in fact , they have suggested two ways of teleportation which have different probabilities , but we have pointed out that two schemes give the same probability as 2/3 , which does not depend on coefficients @xmath33 and @xmath34 of the unknown state @xcite .    when alice has an outcome state @xmath35 , the probability that bob measures an outcome @xmath36 is @xmath37 .",

    "the total success probability of teleportation is 2/3 in the scheme because the probability of @xmath36 outcome of bob is 2/3 @xcite .",
    "in fact , it is a natural conclusion that bob s outcome decides whether the quantum channel between alice and charlie is entangled or not .",
    "let us suppose only alice and charlie participate in quantum teleportation via the @xmath0 state .",
    "alice keeps two qubits of the @xmath0 state and charlie the other one .",
    "although st gives us a perfect teleportation via an epr pair , we would like to compare a feature of teleportation by bm with that by povm .",
    "alice performs three - qubit povms on one qubit of the unknown state and her two qubits of the @xmath0 state .",
    "notice that the protocol of ct of a @xmath50-dimensional state with povms is developed in a way of making a conclusive event  @xcite .",
    "similarly , we are able to perform a way of the povms without any loss of generality",
    ".    the total state of the unknown state and the @xmath0 state can be expressed in terms of the bases as follows @xmath51 where the basis vectors are represented by @xmath52    for alice s povms , we consider unnormalized vectors @xmath53 to satisfy a condition of @xmath54 . generally , there are three parameters in each @xmath55 but the condition reduces to one parameter such as @xmath56 or @xmath57 .",
    "the basis vectors of the asymmetric povm are represented    @xmath58    the proper povm set @xmath59 is defined by @xmath60 where the real parameter @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "the set of this povm also satisfies positivity and completeness for any quantum state @xmath63 as follows @xmath64    for simplicity , let us assume that @xmath56 is real and equal to @xmath57 . since @xmath65 should be a positive operator , @xmath56 and @xmath66 should satisfy one of the following conditions as fig",
    "@xmath67    [ fig : wpovm12 ]    we can easily calculate the probability @xmath68 of each conclusive case and total success probability @xmath69 @xmath70 with total failure probability @xmath71 . since @xmath72 is at most 2/3 in fig .",
    "1 , the optimal success teleportation with an asymmetric povm is 2/3 .    as a result of two cases ,",
    "although we optimize a parameter in alice s part , total success probabilities of each scheme in quantum teleportation has a limit value of 2/3 .",
    "therefore , it can be characterized as a property of a @xmath0 state when it is used in quantum teleportation .",
    "in any protocol of teleportation , it is necessary to average the fidelity over all possible input states .",
    "the average fidelity reflects how much information is transferred to the teleported state .",
    "the teleported pure state of the density operator @xmath73 relies on the outcome @xmath74 .",
    "the average fidelity is defined as @xmath75 where @xmath76 and an unknown pure state @xmath77 is parameterized by a real vector @xmath78 in the parameter space of volume @xmath79 @xcite . in the ct",
    ", we separate the average fidelity into two parts for easy calculation as follows @xmath80 p_{i } ( { \\vec \\omega } )    f_{i } ( { \\vec \\omega } ) , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath81 and @xmath82 are the total numbers of conclusive events and inconclusive events .    to understand protocols clearly",
    ", we make a comparison of average fidelity in each case of quantum teleportation of the bm ( iii a ) and the asymmetric povm ( iii b ) .",
    "although eq .",
    "( [ eq : fedelity1 ] ) contains integration of @xmath78 , probability @xmath83 is independent of @xmath78 and @xmath84 is 1 for conclusive event and 1/2 for inconclusive event .    for the case of the teleportation by the bm , the success probability @xmath68 ( @xmath85 ) in eq .",
    "( [ eq : con ] ) is 1/6 and the sum of the failure probability @xmath68 ( @xmath86 ) in eq .",
    "( [ eq : incon ] ) 1/3 .",
    "then , the average fidelity in the bm is @xmath87    in the teleportation by an asymmetric povm , the success probability of each conclusive event is @xmath88 with fidelity 1 .",
    "the average fidelity is @xmath89 since @xmath72 is smaller than 2/3 , the maximal average fidelity is also 5/6 as a limit of the bm .",
    "therefore , the method of the bm provides the maximum value of average fidelity as well as that of success probability between two types of teleportations via a w state .",
    "we have shown two schemes of quantum teleportation of an unknown qubit via a @xmath0 state taking into account two kinds of alice s measurements . in the first protocol , after alice performs bell measurements on the unknown state and her channel state , the information of the unknown state is split between bob and charlie . but",
    "recovering of the unknown state is not always successful unlike the quantum teleportation with a ghz state .",
    "the second scheme of quantum teleportation is based on povms in alice s part .",
    "we have also calculated the maximal success probability and the optimal average fidelity for each scheme .",
    "the maximum values of success probability and average fidelity are 2/3 and 5/6 .",
    "since average fidelity 5/6 is greater than 2/3 , the @xmath0 state can be used as a channel in quantum teleportation . therefore ,",
    "@xmath0 states are not particularly better for quantum teleportation than ghz states .",
    "even though we can obtain same values of the success probability and the fidelity for each scheme , we would like to comment that the amount of classical communication is different in each case .",
    "the teleportation protocol via the @xmath0 state by the bm needs three classical bits to achieve a successful teleportation , but the schemes by asymmetric povm require three bits with consideration of a failure notice to a receiver .    finally , we note a scheme of teleportation using a @xmath0 state of different amplitudes as follows @xmath90 . following the schemes shown in sec .",
    "[ sec : bellw ] , we can easily guess a protocol of the bm from @xmath91 , charlie also obtains a teleported state with a certain probability . on the other hand ,",
    "if we consider quantum teleportation with the povm , even in a simple case of @xmath92 and @xmath93 , it seems to be difficult to find a povm set .",
