    "the periodic anderson model is the model of choice to describe heavy - fermion materials realized in crystals @xcite or in quantum simulations . @xcite it generically describes a band of light conduction electrons of bandwidth @xmath4 hybridizing , with matrix element @xmath5 , with a narrow band of @xmath1 electrons located at energy @xmath6 .",
    "since the @xmath1 band is narrow , coulomb correlations are important and are taken into account by an on - site hubbard interaction @xmath3 .    the emergent many - body scales depend very much on the choice of bare parameters . in the absence of electronic correlations , hybridization leads to an intrinsic @xmath1-band width @xmath7 which gives an energy scale to assess the impact of the hubbard @xmath3 .",
    "in particular , the formation of a local magnetic moment in a metallic host has been studied in ref .  .",
    "it corresponds to a choice of bare parameters where the lower ( upper ) hubbard band is below ( above ) the fermi energy @xmath8 , namely @xmath9 . for strong @xmath3 in the local - moment regime",
    "the effective low - energy physics can be approximated by the more simple kondo - lattice model:@xcite here , charge fluctuations on the @xmath1 orbitals are completely suppressed , and a super - exchange - like mechanism @xcite yields a magnetic energy scale , namely a local antiferromagnetic exchange @xmath10 between the local and the conduction - electron moments .",
    "the local magnetic moment corresponds to a local kramers doublet and is thereby  in the absence of correlations  protected by time - reversal symmetry .",
    "the residual entropy can be quenched by different and competing mechanisms .",
    "magnetic ordering breaks time - reversal symmetry and is driven by the ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yosida ( rkky)@xcite interaction .",
    "the corresponding energy scale is set by the effective coupling strength @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the conduction - electron spin susceptibility .",
    "it is an indirect interaction which is mediated via magnetic polarization of the conduction electrons .",
    "this energy scale competes with the kondo scale @xcite given by @xmath13 . for temperatures below @xmath14",
    "the local magnetic moment is screened through the formation of a many - body entangled spin - singlet state with the conduction - electron spin degrees of freedom .",
    "the competition between rkky coupling and kondo screening leads to the famous doniach diagram @xcite and to corresponding quantum phase transitions .",
    "@xcite    some heavy - fermion materials , such as cepdal , are synthesized on frustrated geometries .",
    "@xcite this introduces another energy scale in the problem associated with the release of frustration via a mechanism of partial kondo screening ( pks ) .",
    "@xcite here , a site - selective kondo effect alleviates the frustration thus allowing the remnant spins to order magnetically via the rkky interaction .",
    "such site - dependent screening can occur spontaneously or can reflect chemically different environments in compounds with large unit cells .",
    "the mechanism of partial kondo screening has attracted considerable attention in the past .",
    "@xcite the purpose of the present paper is to study the effect in the anderson lattice beyond the static mean - field approximation .",
    "@xcite this is achieved by applying a variant of the dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) @xcite for the anderson model on the triangular lattice where the different correlated orbitals in the unit cell are treated independently , similar to a real - space dmft approach .",
    "@xcite we will show that the competition between rkky coupling and kondo screening , supplemented by lattice frustration leads to a remarkably rich phase diagram including a pks phase emerging in the local - moment regime at the border between paramagnetic heavy - fermion and magnetically ordered phases .",
    "the anderson lattice has richer physics than the kondo - lattice model since it allows for charge fluctuations on the @xmath1 sites . in conjunction with strong spin - orbit coupling , for example",
    ", this naturally leads to the concept of a topological kondo insulator @xcite which has argued to be realized in smb@xmath15 .",
    "@xcite here , we extend our study beyond the local - moment regime and consider magnetic phases in the mixed - valence regime .",
    "this is realized when the lower ( or upper ) hubbard band overlaps with the chemical potential , i.e. , if @xmath16 . in this regime",
    "our numerical calculations indicate a completely different physics and predict ferromagnetic order in particular .",
    "we argue that the latter is reminiscent of itinerant - electron ferromagnetism caused by strong electron correlations in single - band models on frustrated geometries .",
    "@xcite    our study should be understood as a first step only which contributes towards a deeper understanding of the competition between magnetic order and kondo screening on frustrated lattice geometries : while the dynamical mean - field theory treats the local , temporal correlations exactly and correctly accounts for the kondo effect , it also suffers from the simple mean - field - type description of spatial correlations . as concerns",
    "the effective rkky interaction , the dmft does capture its full spatial structure and therewith the corresponding tendencies towards magnetic ordering but the feedback of non - local magnetic correlations on the one - particle green s function is neglected .",
    "we expect that this missing feedback will result in a somewhat biased description which probably overestimates the instabilities against magnetic ordering . despite this and other possible deficiencies that are characteristic to any mean - field approach",
    ", we believe that the non - perturbative and internally consistent physical picture that is provided by the dmft will serve as an important starting point for future studies , such as cluster and other extensions of the dmft concept , @xcite where the effects of short- and long - range correlations are progressively included . even this route can not be expected to provide a final answer , given the complexity of the problem posed by strong correlations in fermionic models on two - dimensional frustrated lattices , and must be supplemented by complementary approaches , such as variational wave functions ( see ref .   for an example ) .",

    "this is clearly present : as mentioned above , the linear response of the @xmath23 moments to a static magnetic field applied to the @xmath1 electron spins is found as antiferromagnetic in paramagnetic phase close to the afm and pks phase .",
    "furthermore , within the symmetry - broken pks phase , the ordered moments @xmath138 and @xmath139 are antiferromagnetically aligned on the b and c sites . on the other hand , the robustness of the pks phase ,",
    "i.e. , its extension in the @xmath140 plane , and also the presence of strong charge fluctuations , see the sizable double occupancy in figs .",
    "[ fig : m25 ] and [ fig : m35 ] , suggest that the physics is non - universal and by no means ruled by a single kondo scale @xmath14 .",
    "it is interesting to note that our data unambiguously show that there is no `` perfect '' partial kondo screening .",
    "namely , a slight polarization @xmath141 and @xmath142 of the local @xmath1 and @xmath23 spins on the a , i.e. , on the kondo site is clearly visible in figs .  [",
    "fig : m25 ] and [ fig : m35 ] .",
    "the proximity to the pair of rkky - like antiferromagnetically coupled moments , which explicitly breaks time - reversal symmetry , implies that there are admixtures of states with non - zero spin quantum number to the kondo `` singlet '' . assuming this admixture to be given by a single spin - triplet state for simplicity",
    ", the antiferromagnetic environment explains a coupling to the @xmath143 component of the triplet . a finite polarization of the kondo singlet , however , rather requires a coupling to the @xmath144 components and thus implies the additional breaking of the z@xmath145 symmetry of the antiferromagnetic state .",
    "this spontaneous symmetry breaking in the pks phase is also visible in the magnitudes of the b- and c - site moments , namely @xmath146 , and is present in the `` @xmath73 '' afm state anyway .",
    "accompanying the ordering of the spin degrees of freedom , there is a also a ( weak ) charge ordering in the afm and the pks phase ( see upper panels of figs .",
    "[ fig : n25 ] and [ fig : n35 ] ) : there are two interesting observations : first , the deviation of the charge density from the average density is much stronger on the @xmath23 orbitals as must be expected in the local - moment regime where charge fluctuations on the correlated @xmath1 orbitals are very effectively suppressed .",
    "this effect is stronger for @xmath101 and compared to @xmath98 .",
    "second , within the pks phase , there is a charge transfer from the `` kondo site '' ( a ) to the `` magnetic sites '' ( b , c ) : @xmath147 and @xmath148 . due the kondo effect",
    ", the local conduction - electron density of states at the a site will develop a dip , and spectral weight must be shifted above or below the fermi energy . in the absence of particle - hole symmetry",
    ", this shift is asymmetric and changes the occupancy .",
    "the sign and the size of the resulting charge transfer , however , depend on the _ details _ of the band structure .",
    "charge disproportionation was also found within the pks ( `` partial disorder '' ) state that is obtained by means of the hf approach .",
    "@xcite opposed to our dmft results , the charge transfer seen in the hf studies is much larger for the @xmath1 as compared to the @xmath23 orbitals .",
    "this must be seen as an artifact of the static mean - field approach which can not account for local - moment formation .    as a function of @xmath3",
    ", the pks phase is located between the ks and the afm phase in the phase diagram .",
    "this can be understood by referring to the famous doniach diagram : @xcite in the ks phase at weaker @xmath3 ( stronger @xmath107 ) the kondo effect dominates while for strong @xmath3 ( weak @xmath107 ) the rkky interaction is dominant and results in magnetic order .",
    "the pks state can be seen as a possible way to avoid geometrical frustration in the antiferromagnetically ordered state which is preferred if the formation of a kondo singlet is less expensive than breaking up two frustrated magnetic bonds and forming a non - frustrated third one . as a compromise between indirect exchange , frustration and the kondo effect",
    ", it appears between the ks and the afm phase .      at lower fillings around @xmath149 , depending slightly on @xmath3 , the system develops homogeneous ferromagnetic order ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : pd ] ) . as can bee seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : m25 ] for @xmath98 , the transition to this state is continuous at the lower as well as at the upper critical density . the ferromagnetic state is metallic with a finite compressibility ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : n25 ] ) and partially polarized with a maximum ordered @xmath1 moment of @xmath150 at @xmath151 . the moment on the conduction - electron orbitals ( @xmath152 ) is more than an order of magnitude smaller and _ ferromagnetically _ aligned to the moment on the @xmath1 orbitals .",
    "generally , there are several mechanisms that may cause metallic ferromagnetism : @xcite the main idea of the rkky concept @xcite consists in a magnetic coupling of well - formed local @xmath1 moments in an effective kondo - lattice model @xcite which is mediated by the conduction electrons and features ferromagnetic order if the effective rkky coupling @xmath153 is peaked at @xmath154 . while the rkky theory is a perturbative approach ( @xmath155 ) , the double - exchange mechanism @xcite applies to the strong-@xmath107 regime of a kondo lattice and predicts that a ferromagnetic ordering of the @xmath1 moments minimizes the kinetic energy of the conduction electrons .",
    "it is questionable , however , if those concepts apply here as there are strong charge fluctuations preventing the formation of well - defined @xmath1 moments in our case .",
    "this is obvious from the sizable deviation of the @xmath1 occupancy from unity ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : n25 ] , @xmath156 in the relevant filling range ) . another clear indication that the system is no longer in a local - moment regime is the ferro- rather than antiferromagnetic coupling between @xmath1 and @xmath23 moments ( see middle and lower panel of fig .  [",
    "fig : m25 ] around @xmath149 ) .",
    "this is incompatible with an effective low - energy kondo model .",
    "it is interesting to note that this implies a filling - dependent crossover from the local - moment regime with a locally antiferromagnetic coupling between @xmath1 and @xmath23 moments ( see @xmath126 and @xmath127 in fig .",
    "[ fig : m25 ] in the pks and afm phases ) to a mixed - valence regime .",
    "this can also be verified easily by studying the linear response in the paramagnetic phase separating the fm and the pks phase in fig .",
    "[ fig : pd ] : by applying a weak magnetic field to the @xmath1 moments , one finds that the local coupling between @xmath1 and @xmath23 moments changes from antiferro- to ferromagnetic with decreasing filling .    at @xmath63",
    "the static off - diagonal @xmath1-@xmath23 magnetic spin susceptibility can be computed easily in the entire filling range . except for low fillings around and below @xmath157 , corresponding to the van hove singularity of the density of states close to the lower band edge ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : dos ] ) , the local response is found as antiferromagnetic for @xmath158 . above half - filling , the response turns to ferromagnetic and is at a maximum for @xmath159 corresponding to the van hove singularity at @xmath160 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : dos ] ) .",
    "we conclude that the ferromagnetic phase can not be understood as an instability of the fermi sea in the weak-@xmath3 regime .",
    "just the opposite , the paramagnetic state from which the ferromagnetic phase evolves should be considered as strongly correlated . already for @xmath98 ,",
    "the double occupancy is strongly suppressed and @xmath121 is in fact at a minimum for @xmath122 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : m25 ] ) .",
    "the importance of a strong asymmetry of the density of states for metallic ferromagnetism at strong and intermediate interaction strengths has been emphasized by dmft studies of the single - band hubbard model .",
    "@xcite the key idea is that in a situation where double occupancies are effectively suppressed , the system does not gain much interaction energy from ferromagnetic ordering .",
    "therefore , the appearance of ferromagnetism must be understood by referring to the ( complicated ) kinetic energy of the correlated paramagnetic state from which it derives . within dmft",
    "this suggests that the _ shape _ of the non - interacting density of states becomes important .",
    "in fact , studying the impact of a shape - controlling parameter , @xcite ferromagnetism was demonstrated to be favored in cases with a highly _ asymmetric _ density of states , in a parameter range where the density of states is _ high _ , and at strong to intermediate interaction strengths .",
    "we propose that a similar line of reasoning applies to the periodic anderson model in the considered parameter region : even at @xmath98 and all the more for stronger @xmath3 , double occupancies are strongly suppressed , and the gain in kinetic energy obtained by ferromagnetic ordering is dictated by a strongly asymmetric partial @xmath1 density of states .",
    "the filling range where ferromagnetism is likely to occur , is then indicated by a corresponding high density of states .",
    "note that @xmath149 corresponds to a non - interacting chemical potential of @xmath161 which is already close to the van hove singularity ( at @xmath162 ) .",
    "substantially higher fillings would be even more favorable for ferromagnetism , but here the crossover to the local - moment regime and the developing antiferromagnetic correlations overwrite the ferromagnetic tendencies .",
    "this picture also explains why the fm phase shifts to lower fillings with increasing @xmath3 in fig .",
    "[ fig : pd ] : stronger interactions favor ferromagnetism and extend the fm phase to a larger filling range as is again well known from the single - band case .",
    "@xcite this explains the decrease of the lower critical filling for the fm phase with increasing @xmath3 . at the same time , however , an increasing @xmath3 favors local - moment formation , and therefore the ks phase with antiferromagnetic correlations extends at the cost of the mixed - valence regime .",
    "this explains the decrease of the upper critical filling with increasing @xmath3 .",
    "previous work @xcite on ferromagnetism in the periodic anderson model has been done using different theoretical approaches and in largely different parameter regimes .",
    "nevertheless , ferromagnetic order away from half - filling appears as a robust result .",
    "as basically all studies have exclusively been performed for bipartite lattices , a direct comparison with our results is not possible .",
    "there are , however , close similarities with the results of a dmft study by meyer and nolting @xcite which , for a bethe lattice with infinite connectivity , demonstrates that ferromagnetism appears in the mixed - valence regime for a finite filling range .",
    "this study also points out a crossover from antiferro- to ferromagnetic coupling between @xmath1 and @xmath23 magnetic moments with decreasing filling , consistent with our findings , and suggests a mechanism based on an effective single - band model with strongly correlated and itinerant electrons ",
    "an idea that was formalized later on by batista et al .",
    "our site - dependent dmft study of the magnetic phase diagram of the periodic anderson model on the triangular lattice has uncovered a surprisingly complex phenomenology which could be traced back to a competition between several physical mechanisms at work .",
    "in particular , the phase diagram is governed by :    \\(i ) the _ formation of local magnetic moments _ on the @xmath1 orbitals . due to the non - bipartite structure of the triangular lattice ,",
    "half - filling of the @xmath1 orbitals is found for total fillings below half - filling , around @xmath82 , weakly depending on @xmath3 . here , the low - energy physics is well captured by an effective kondo lattice although there are sizable @xmath1 charge fluctuations for the weak- to intermediate - coupling regime considered here ( @xmath163 ) . at somewhat lower fillings ,",
    "there are still well - developed local @xmath1 moments , but the charge fluctuations increase since the @xmath1 electrons become itinerant .",
    "\\(ii ) _ mixed - valence physics _ with strong charge fluctuations on the @xmath1 orbitals , even at stronger @xmath3 , replaces the local - moment regime for lower fillings ( roughly below @xmath164 , depending on @xmath3 ) .",
    "the filling - dependent crossover from the local - moment to the mixed - valence regime is accompanied by a reversal of the effective local exchange between the local @xmath1 and @xmath23 spins from antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic .",
    "\\(iii ) an _ rkky - like indirect magnetic exchange _ between the @xmath1 magnetic moments induces antiferromagnetic order for sufficiently strong @xmath3 within the local - moment regime . as we have enforced spin structures to be collinear , this results in an `` @xmath165 '' afm phase on the triangular lattice which possibly mimics `` classical '' 120@xmath166 afm order .",
    "\\(iv ) the _ kondo effect _ competes with the indirect exchange in the spirit of the doniach diagram . at low temperatures ,",
    "besides magnetic ordering , the large entropy carried by the local - moment system can be removed by screening the @xmath1 moment in a kondo singlet with the conduction - electron spin degrees of freedom . with decreasing @xmath3 , and",
    "prior to charge fluctuations becoming dominant , this kondo - singlet ( ks ) phase replaces the antiferromagnetic order .",
    "kondo physics is also dominating for lower fillings around @xmath167 , depending slightly on @xmath3 , as well as for fillings very close to and at half - filling .",
    "the hybridization band gap in the non - interacting density of states results in a band insulator at half - filling for @xmath63 and develops into a correlated kondo insulator with increasing @xmath3 .",
    "\\(v ) _ geometrical frustration _ affects the competition between kondo screening and rkky coupling . at the border between the afm and ks phase ,",
    "it becomes favorable to avoid frustration by partial kondo screening of one @xmath1 moment per unit cell .",
    "this allows the remnant moments to form an unfrustrated rkky - coupled collinear antiferromagnet .",
    "the pks phase is metallic , and it supports a ( weak ) charge - density - wave ordering in addition , mainly on the @xmath23 orbitals .",
    "although it results from a compromise between kondo screening , rkky coupling and frustration , the pks state has turned out to be surprisingly robust .",
    "it appears in an extended parameter range and does not need any anisotropic terms in the hamiltonian .",
    "@xcite due to proximity to the time - reversal - symmetry - breaking rkky - coupled remnant moments , the partial kondo screening is imperfect resulting in a tiny magnetic moment on the @xmath1 and , antiferromagnetically aligned , on the @xmath23 orbital at the `` kondo site '' .",
    "\\(vi ) _ strong correlations among itinerant electrons _ give rise to a metallic and partially polarized ferromagnetic phase in the mixed - valence regime . in this case , the non - bipartite lattice structure favors magnetic order as it produces a highly asymmetric non - interacting density of states which is known to crucially affect the kinetic - energy balance favoring ferromagnetism in a range of fillings with high density of states at the fermi level and where antiferromagnetic correlations are subdominant . as a non - perturbative effect , this itinerant - electron ferromagnetism lacks a clear ( simple ) mechanism  even in a single - band hubbard model .",
    "two main results of our study might be relevant for the understanding of pks in real materials , such as cepdal , @xcite uni@xmath168b @xcite or even artificial geometries of magnetic atoms on metallic surfaces , @xcite and for corresponding electronic - structure models : ( i ) the pks state appears at non - integer fillings .",
    "one might thus speculate that the gain in kinetic energy is essential to stabilize the state and that spin - only models may be questionable .",
    "( ii ) the pks state exclusively shows up at the border between the paramagnetic heavy - fermion and the magnetically ordered phase .",
    "this could be tested experimentally by steering the system through this border , either by controlling the temperature or by means of chemical substitution .",
    "@xcite    there are several lines along which our study could be continued in the future : first , non - collinear phases are in principle accessible by an su(2)-symmetric formulation of the site - dependent dmft .",
    "this may lead to a certain refinement of the magnetic phase diagram , with non - collinear ( or even incommensurate ) afm phases partially replacing the `` @xmath165 '' phase but we do not expect a further qualitative change as the relevant energy scale is still set by the effective rkky - exchange coupling constant .",
    "second , it would be interesting to make contact with the corresponding phase diagram of the kondo model on the triangular lattice , either by applying dmft to the kondo model directly @xcite or by using a solver which allows to resolve the kondo scale , such as the numerical renormalization group .",
    "@xcite    finally , one may address the effect of non - local correlations beyond the single - site dmft .",
    "the kondo effect results from correlations between a single correlated @xmath1 orbital and the conduction - band system and is , therefore , captured correctly by a dynamical mean - field theory which treats those correlations exactly .",
    "dmft also provides an accurate description of the non - local indirect exchange but the feedback of non - local magnetic correlations on the self - energy is missing .",
    "those missing fluctuations must result in mean - field artifacts .",
    "typically , the ( site - dependent ) dmft approach is therefore , to some extent , biased towards the formation of magnetic order and tends to favor a symmetry - broken state @xmath169 at the expense of a non - local singlet @xmath170 .",
    "@xcite one might speculate that , compared to the pks state , the afm phase is overestimated and that both , the pks and the afm phases are overestimated as compared to the ks state .    financial support of this work by the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft within the forschergruppe for 1346 ( projects p1 and p8 ) and within the sonderforschungsbereich sfb 668 ( project a14 ) is gratefully acknowledged .",
