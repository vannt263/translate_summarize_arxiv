    "this review was focused on the geometrical properties of laplacian eigenfunctions in euclidean domains .",
    "we started from the basic properties of the laplace operator and explicit representations of its eigenfunctions in simple domains .",
    "after that , the properties of eigenvalues and their relation to the shape of a domain were briefly summarized , including weyl s asymptotic behavior , isoperimetric inequalities , and kac s inverse spectral problem .",
    "the structure of nodal domains and various estimates for the norms of eigenfunctions were then presented .",
    "the main section [ sec : localization ] was devoted to the spatial structure of eigenfunctions , with a special emphasis on their localization in small subsets of a domain .",
    "one of the major difficulties in the study of localization is that localization is a property of an individual eigenfunction .",
    "for the same domain , two consecutive eigenfunctions with very close eigenvalues may have drastically different geometrical structures ( e.g. , one is localized and the other is extended ) .",
    "one needs therefore fine analytical tools which would differently operate with localized and non - localized eigenfunctions . in the review , we distinguished two types of localization , for low - frequency and high - frequency eigenfunctions .    in the former case ,",
    "an eigenfunction remains localized in a subset because of a geometric constraint that prohibits its extension to other parts of the domain .",
    "a standard example is a dumbbell ( two domains connected by a narrow channel ) , for which an eigenfunction may be localized in one domain if its typical wavelength is larger than the width of the channel ( meaning that an eigenfunction can not `` squeeze '' through the channel )",
    ". such kind of `` expulsion '' from a channel is quite generic , as the analysis is applicable to domains with branches of variable cross - sectional profiles .",
    "it is important to note that a geometric constraint does not need to be strong ( e.g. , two domains may be separated by a cloud of point - like obstacles of zero measure ) .",
    "another example is an elongated triangle , in which there is no `` obstacles '' at all .",
    "low - frequency localization was found numerically in many irregularly - shaped domains , for both dirichlet and neumann boundary conditions . from a practical point of view",
    ", the low - frequency localization may find various applications , e.g. , it is important for the theory of quantum , optical and acoustical waveguides and microelectronic devices , as well as for analysis and engineering of highly reflecting or absorbing materials ( noise protective barriers , anti - radar coatings , etc ) .",
    "the high - frequency localization manifests in quantum billiards when a sequence of eigenfunctions tends to concentrate onto some orbits of the associated classical billiard . in this regime , the asymptotic properties of eigenvalues and eigenfunctions are strongly related to the underlying classical dynamics ( e.g. , regular , integrable or chaotic ) . for instance ,",
    "the ergodic character of the classical system is reflected in the spatial structure of eigenfunctions .",
    "working on simple domains , we illustrated several kinds of localized eigenfunctions which emerge for a large class of domains .",
    "we also provided examples of rectangular domains without localization .",
    "although a number of rigorous and numerical results were obtained ( e.g. , quantum ergodicity theorem for ergodic billiards ) , many questions about the spatial structure of high - frequency eigenfunctions remain open , even for very simple domains ( e.g. , a square ) .",
    "although the review counts more than five hundred citations , it is far from being complete . as already mentioned , we focused on the laplace operator in bounded euclidean domains and mostly omitted technical details , in order to keep the review at a level accessible to scientists from various fields .",
    "many other issues had to be omitted :    \\(i ) many important results for laplacians on riemannian manifolds or weighted graphs could not be included .",
    "in addition , we did not discuss the spectral properties of domains with `` holes '' @xcite , as well as their consequences for diffusion in domains with static traps @xcite .",
    "the behavior of the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions under deformations of a domain was partly considered in sec .",
    "[ sec : first_eigenfunction ] and sec .",
    "[ sec : dumbbell ] , while many significant results were not included ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "\\(ii ) there are important developments of numerical techniques for computing the laplacian eigenbasis .",
    "in fact , standard finite difference or finite element methods rely on a regular or adapted discretization of a domain that reduces the continuous eigenvalue problem to a finite set of linear equations @xcite . since finding the eigenbasis of the resulting matrix is still an expensive computational task , various hints and tricks",
    "are often implemented .",
    "for instance , for planar polygonal domains , one can exploit the behavior of eigenfunctions at corners through radial basis functions in polar coordinates and the integration of related fourier - bessel functions on subdomains @xcite .",
    "another `` trick '' is conformal mapping of planar polygonal domains onto the unit disk , for which the modified eigenvalue problem can be efficiently solved @xcite .",
    "yet another approach , known as the method of particular solutions was suggested by fox and co - workers @xcite and later progressively improved @xcite .",
    "the main idea is to consider various solutions of the eigenvalue equation for a given value of @xmath221 and to vary @xmath221 until a linear combination of such solutions would satisfy the boundary condition at a number of sample points along the boundary .",
    "one can also mention a stochastic method by lejay and maire for computing the principal eigenvalue @xcite .",
    "the eigenvalue problem can also be reformulated in terms of boundary integral equations that reduces the dimensionality and allows for rapid computation of eigenvalues @xcite .",
    "kaufman and co - workers proposed a simple expansion method in which wave functions inside a two - dimensional quantum billiard are expressed in terms of an expansion of a complete set of orthonormal functions defined in a surrounding rectangle for which dirichlet boundary conditions apply , while approximating the billiard boundary by a potential energy step of a sufficiently large size @xcite .",
    "vergini and saraceno proposed a scaling method for computing high - frequency eigenmodes @xcite .",
    "this method was later improved by barnett and hassell @xcite ( this reference is also a good review of numerical methods for high - frequency dirichlet laplacian eigenvalues ) .",
    "\\(iii ) we did not discuss various applications of laplacian eigenfunctions which nowadays range from pure and applied mathematics to physics , chemistry , biology and computer sciences .",
