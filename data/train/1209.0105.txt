    "<S> we reanalyze transfer - matrix and monte carlo results for the critical binder cumulant @xmath0 of an anisotropic two - dimensional ising model on a square lattice in a square geometry with periodic boundary conditions . </S>",
    "<S> spins are coupled between nearest - neighboring sites and between next - nearest - neighboring sites along one of the lattice diagonals . </S>",
    "<S> we find that @xmath0 depends only on the asymptotic critical long - distance features of the anisotropy , irrespective of its realization through ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic next - nearest - neighbor couplings . </S>",
    "<S> we modify an earlier renormalization - group calculation to obtain a quantitative description of the anisotropy dependence of @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> our results support our recent claim towards the validity of universal finite - size scaling for critical phenomena in the presence of a weak anisotropy .    </S>",
    "<S> universality is a key concept in the theory of critical phenomena for bulk and confined systems ; for reviews , see , for example , @xcite . within a given bulk universality class , critical exponents , certain critical amplitude ratios , and the critical behavior of thermodynamic functions </S>",
    "<S> are identical and independent of the specific microscopic realization . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , the bulk correlation length in the asymptotic critical domain , that is , for asymptotically small positive or negative @xmath1 , is , for isotropic systems , described by @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the bulk critical temperature , @xmath4 is a universal critical exponent , @xmath5 are nonuniversal critical amplitudes , and @xmath6 is a universal critical amplitude ratio .    besides critical exponents , the thermodynamic functions describing the asymptotic critical domain are universal if one allows for adjusting of only two amplitudes . </S>",
    "<S> consider , for example , for small @xmath7 and small field @xmath8 conjugate to the order parameter , the part @xmath9 of the bulk free energy density that becomes singular at the critical point @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath9 is asymptotically described by universal scaling functions @xmath11 for @xmath12 according to @xcite @xmath13 with @xmath14 , with universal critical exponents @xmath15 and @xmath16 , and where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are nonuniversal amplitudes , that is , they differ between different systems within the universality class under consideration .    </S>",
    "<S> universality also extends to situations , where the system under consideration is confined on a length scale @xmath19 that is large compared to all microscopic length scales , such as lattice constants . </S>",
    "<S> if the singular part of the free energy density of the system under consideration exhibits scaling , its asymptotic critical form may be written as @xcite @xmath20 where the nonuniversal constants @xmath21 and @xmath22 are universally related to the constants @xmath17 and @xmath18 in ( [ f.bs ] ) . for given shape and boundary conditions , the function @xmath23 is universal .    equations ( [ xi.crit])([f.s ] ) were stated for isotropic critical systems , that is , where the bulk asymptotic near - critical correlation length is isotropic . </S>",
    "<S> here we are interested in the fate of universal finite - size scaling in the presence of a weak anisotropy , that is , where the amplitudes @xmath5 depend on the direction , but @xmath24 does not ( for strong anisotropies , where even @xmath24 depends on the direction , see , for example , @xcite and references therein ) </S>",
    "<S> . representatives of spatially anisotropic systems in the context of critical phenomena are , for example , magnetic materials , alloys , superconductors @xcite , and solids with structural phase transitions @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> most of the literature on critical phenomena has focused on the isotropic case . in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , investigations were carried out on a number of specific anisotropic systems , but no general picture of universality for weakly anisotropic systems in restricted geometries was suggested . </S>",
    "<S> the more recent publications @xcite have attempted to clarify the situation from a more general point of view . </S>",
    "<S> references  @xcite concluded that the dependence of some bulk amplitude ratios , scaling functions , and the critical binder cumulant on the parameters describing the anisotropy indicates a violation of universality . in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , it was suggested that universality should be defined only after relating the system under consideration to an isotropic system by means of a shear transformation ( see @xcite for such a suggestion in the context of the two - dimensional ising model ) .    </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the present author suggested in @xcite that quantities that are universal in the isotropic case remain universal in the presence of a weak anisotropy , if their list of arguments is augmented by the parameters describing the asymptotic critical long - distance features of the anisotropy . </S>",
    "<S> universality then implies that the quantity under consideration should exhibit no dependence on the particular microscopic realization of these features . </S>",
    "<S> rather , it should depend universally on the anisotropy , that is , in a way that is identical for all members of the respective bulk universality class . </S>",
    "<S> explicit support for this claim was provided in @xcite through results for free energy scaling functions of the two - dimensional ising model on infinite strips . </S>",
    "<S> these examples , however , exhibited the simplification that a shear transformation exactly related the anisotropic systems to their isotropic counterparts with identical boundary conditions and geometry . </S>",
    "<S> accordingly , the scaling functions for the anisotropic case could be expressed in terms of the isotropic scaling functions , and the consequences of the anisotropy could be interpreted to be of a mere geometric nature . in this work </S>",
    "<S> , we consider a situation where this simplification is absent .    </S>",
    "<S> consider weakly anisotropic critical bulk systems in @xmath25 dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> their asymptotic long - distance correlations are described by a correlation length ellipsoid that may be represented by a symmetric positive definite matrix @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> this is diagonalized by a rotation matrix @xmath27 , so that @xmath28 the @xmath29 are the asymptotic near - critical bulk correlation lengths along the principal axes of the ellipsoid . </S>",
    "<S> the scale - free matrix @xcite @xmath30 is normalized to have @xmath31 and describes the shape and orientation of the ellipsoid . since @xmath24 is unique by assumption , @xmath32 is independent of @xmath7 within the asymptotic critical domain </S>",
    "<S> . it may be parametrized by @xmath33 correlation length ratios and @xmath34 rotation angles . </S>",
    "<S> according to @xcite , universal quantities may receive an additional dependence on @xmath32 , but are independent of its particular microscopic realization . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that the functions @xmath35 and @xmath36 on the right - hand sides of eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ f.bs ] ) and ( [ f.s ] ) , respectively , have to be replaced by universal functions @xmath37 and @xmath38 , which describe the isotropic situation as a special case @xmath39 .    the use of a normalized matrix @xmath32 to describe the anisotropy of a model was suggested in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , while @xmath32 from ( [ ab ] ) is defined through the physical correlation lengths in the asymptotic critical domain , explicit versions of @xmath32 in @xcite were obtained by expanding the hamiltonian under consideration in small wave numbers @xmath40 through order @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> while , for standard @xmath42 field theory , these definitions coincide due to an exact mapping between anisotropic and isotropic bulk hamiltonians @xcite , this procedure in general does not , for lattice models , lead to the same @xmath32 as defined through the physical correlation lengths . </S>",
    "<S> this will be demonstrated explicitly for the two - dimensional ising model below . </S>",
    "<S> the matrix @xmath32 used in @xcite is thus not universally related to the matrix defined in ( [ ab ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this explains why the author of @xcite arrived at the conclusion that the anisotropy effects exhibit `` a kind of restricted universality '' that only holds for a subclass of systems within a given universality class . </S>",
    "<S> here we give support to our claim from @xcite that the use of the matrix @xmath32 as defined in ( [ ab ] ) leads to unrestricted universality in the traditional sense .    for @xmath43-dimensional models , the ellipsoid reduces to an ellipse @xcite , whose shape may be characterized by the ratio @xmath44 of the smallest and largest correlation lengths ( thus @xmath45 ) and an angle @xmath46 describing its orientation ( we select the convention @xmath47 ) . if @xmath46 is chosen to be the inclination of the direction of the largest correlation length with respect to the `` @xmath48 '' direction , see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ ellipse.lattice](a ) , the explicit form of @xmath32 for @xmath43 is @xcite @xmath49 therefore , universal quantities may receive an additional dependence on the variables @xmath50 and @xmath46 as compared to the isotropic case .    </S>",

    "<S> thus , compared to the isotropic case , universal quantities may receive an additional dependence only on @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> note that for general @xmath66 , a shear transformation to an isotropic system causes the periodicity of the boundary conditions to be no longer in mutually perpendicular directions and therefore no transformation to an isotropic system with identical geometry and boundary conditions to the original system is possible . </S>",
    "<S> thus the consequences of the anisotropy can not be interpreted to be of a mere geometric nature .    </S>",
    "<S> here we test anisotropic universality for the critical binder cumulant . </S>",
    "<S> the binder cumulant @xcite is a measure of the order parameter distribution . </S>",
    "<S> it may be used to locate the phase transition for a given model from the intersection of the cumulant for different system sizes or to determine the critical exponent @xmath24 and therefore the universality class . for our system , </S>",
    "<S> the binder cumulant is defined by @xmath67 with the magnetization per spin @xmath68 and its second and fourth moments @xmath69 and @xmath70 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we are interested in the critical thermodynamic limit @xmath71 . for given universality class , geometric system shape ( taken to the thermodynamic limit ) , and boundary conditions , @xmath0 is believed to be universal , that is , to have a unique value in the isotropic case , independent of the underlying lattice @xcite and the spin value @xcite . according to our considerations above , </S>",
    "<S> we expect @xmath0 to become a universal function @xmath72 for the anisotropic case discussed here , that is , if we switch on @xmath56 .    </S>",
    "<S> the most precise related results were obtained in @xcite by means of a transfer - matrix method and imply [ u.kabl ] @xmath73 using monte carlo techniques , precision results have also been obtained for other values of @xmath56 , notably for both @xmath74 @xcite and @xmath75 @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> note , however , that all data points appear to be described by a single function @xmath72 , irrespective of the sign of @xmath56 , that is , for microscopic realizations of @xmath50 through both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic couplings @xmath56 . </S>",
    "<S> this is the central observation of this work , giving strong support to the conjectured universality of weakly anisotropic critical systems .    </S>",
    "<S> we conclude by discussing the use of the renormalization group ( rg ) to describe the anisotropy dependence of @xmath0 . in @xcite , the rg in three dimensions </S>",
    "<S> was used to describe the anisotropy dependence of @xmath0 in two dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> a two - dimensional anisotropy matrix @xmath85 with @xmath77 from above was incorporated into a block - diagonal @xmath86 matrix @xmath87 to estimate the @xmath77 dependence of @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the result provided a good approximation to the available data from @xcite for @xmath88 . </S>",

    "<S> , it becomes large for negative @xmath56 , unless @xmath56 is small . </S>",
    "<S> using @xmath93 instead , a natural choice for the appropriate three - dimensional matrix is @xmath94 which localizes the anisotropy within the first two dimensions . plugging our choice of @xmath95 into the rg result for @xmath96 , provided in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( 7.8 ) of @xcite , and following ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite in normalizing the resulting function @xmath97 by plotting @xmath98 with @xmath99 from ( [ u.kabl.sq ] ) , we obtain the solid line in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ caniso ] , valid for both signs in ( [ ab2.r ] ) and thus for both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic @xmath56 . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the three - dimensional rg calculation of @xcite results in a good description of the relative anisotropy dependence of the two - dimensional critical binder cumulant , provided the anisotropy is described by the appropriate matrix @xmath93 from ( [ ab2.r ] ) and @xmath93 is naturally embedded into @xmath95 as in ( [ ab3.r ] ) .    in summary , we considered the critical binder cumulant @xmath0 of a two - dimensional ising model on a square lattice in a square geometry with periodic boundary conditions and nearest - neighbor couplings . </S>",
    "<S> additional couplings on one of the lattice diagonals allowed us to adjust a variable diagonal anisotropy of the correlation lengths in the asymptotic critical domain . </S>",
    "<S> we found that @xmath0 depends universally on its argument @xmath50 , defined as the ratio of the smallest and largest bulk correlation length , independently of the particular realization of @xmath50 through ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic diagonal couplings . observing the true physical asymptotic long - distance behavior of the anisotropy , represented by the asymptotic critical correlation length ellipse , we repeated dohm s renormalization group calculation and found good quantitative agreement of the relative anisotropy dependence of @xmath0 with precision transfer - matrix and monte carlo data . </S>",
    "<S> our results support the validity of universal finite - size scaling for critical phenomena in the presence of a weak anisotropy . </S>",
    "<S> the ideas presented here and in @xcite may be used to analyze other quantities in weakly anisotropic systems , for example , those ( besides the binder cumulant ) for which nonuniversality was claimed in @xcite . </S>"
