    "thermodynamic potentials have to be state variables .",
    "it is so if they are thermodynamically homogeneous .",
    "thermodynamic homogeneity means that the densities of thermodynamic potentials depend on the extensive variables only via their densities .",
    "this property is usually expressed as the euler condition @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is an arbitrary positive number and @xmath3 exhaust all extensive variables .",
    "it is straightforward to obtain from the euler condition @xmath4 .",
    "this linear homogeneity condition leads to the existence of the thermodynamic limit independently of boundary conditions and the shape of the volume .",
    "one of the authors recently argued that simple solutions ( replica symmetric ) of the sk model do not obey thermodynamic homogeneity @xcite . using the tap approach a hierarchical solution equivalent to the parisi replica - symmetry breaking ( rsb ) was derived from the demand of homogeneity , or better from minimizing the inhomogeneity of the averaged free energy .    in this paper",
    "we show that the same demand of thermodynamic homogeneity can be implemented into the replica trick for the sk and other mean - field models as scale invariance of the replica index .",
    "the replica trick is used in systems with quenched randomness to overcome averaging of logarithm .",
    "the averaged free energy is defined in the replica trick as @xmath5 . to investigate stability of thermodynamic homogeneity we replicate @xmath2 times the original spin space .",
    "the averaged free energy of such a replicated system is @xmath6^n \\right\\rangle_{av } - 1\\right)/n\\nu $ ] . if the limit @xmath7 leads to a thermodynamically homogeneous solution the resulting free energy  @xmath8 should be independent of the parameter  @xmath2 .",
    "hence thermodynamic homogeneity is equivalent to scale invariance of the replica representation , @xmath9 .",
    "we introduce two types of replica indices in the replica trick applied to a @xmath2 times replicated system .",
    "real replicas we denote @xmath10 while @xmath11 we use for the mathematical ones . after averaging over the random spin - spin interactions in the sk model we obtain at the saddle - point @xmath12\\",
    ".\\ ] ] we denoted @xmath13 .",
    "parameters @xmath14 are determined from saddle point equations @xcite .    to proceed further with thermal averaging we have to determine symmetry of the matrix @xmath15 .",
    "we use the replica symmetric ansatz and distinguish only diagonal and off - diagonal elements .",
    "the super - diagonal elements are fixed , @xmath16 .",
    "since the elements in the matrix of mathematical replicas are @xmath17 matrices , we can choose one parameter for the off - diagonal elements in the real - replica space even if the indices for the mathematical replicas are equal .",
    "we denote @xmath18 . in the spirit of the replica - symmetric ansatz we choose for the off - diagonal matrix elements in the space of mathematical replicas @xmath19 . for convenience",
    "we denote @xmath20 , @xmath21 .",
    "it is now a straightforward task to perform averaging over the spin configurations in eq .   using the above parameters .",
    "we arrive at @xmath22\\right\\}^{\\nu}\\ .\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] we used an abbreviation for the gaussian differential @xmath23 .",
    "the obtained free energy density depends formally on the scaling parameter @xmath2 .",
    "it is clear from the dependence of @xmath24 on @xmath2 in eq .   that it actually depends on  @xmath2 if and only if @xmath25 .",
    "we obtain easily from the saddle - point equations for @xmath26 and  @xmath27 that this happens just below the de almeida - thouless instability line .",
    "hence , the replica - symmetric solution becomes thermodynamically inhomogeneous ( free energy does not obey the euler condition ) in the spin - glass phase .",
    "a thermodynamically inhomogeneous solution is physically inacceptable and has to be amended .",
    "the homogeneous free energy should be independent of @xmath2 .",
    "the dependence on this parameter is minimized in the saddle point where the free energy @xmath24 does not depend on @xmath2 at least locally .",
    "that is , we demand @xmath28 . in the homogeneous state",
    "this equality becomes identity , but when we have an inhomogeneous solution this equation just determines an `` equilibrium '' scaling parameter @xmath29 .    comparing free energy where parameters @xmath30 and @xmath2 are determined from the saddle - point equations with the parisi rsb scheme we find equivalence with @xmath31rsb solution @xcite .",
    "the difference between these two constructions lies in their derivation and motivation . while parisi arrives at 1rsb solution from the demand of maximality of the free energy , here we derived the saddle - point equations from the effort to restore thermodynamic homogeneity ( minimize inhomogeneity ) .",
    "we believe that the latter construction has a more profound physical justification .",
    "the local thermodynamic homogeneity achieved by free energy is not enough to become a thermodynamically consistent solution .",
    "it would be if this newly won solution were independent of a new scaling ( replicating ) of the corresponding spin space . to check whether free energy is homogeneous , i.  e. , independent of global scalings of the phase space",
    ", we write the number of real replicas as a product @xmath32 , whereby e.  g. @xmath33 be determined from stationarity equations resulting from eq .  .",
    "we then have two types of real replicas .",
    "the first one with indices @xmath34 determines the @xmath31rsb solution , while the other with indices @xmath35 serves to a replication of the phase space in which free energy @xmath24 was derived . using again the replica - symmetric ansatz for averaging we",
    "obtain only three parameters that we denote @xmath36 .",
    "it is again a straightforward task to derive an explicit representation for the free energy in the @xmath37-times replicated spin space leading to eq .  .",
    "not surprisingly we find that the resulting free energy formally corresponds to the parisi @xmath38rsb solution",
    ". we can proceed with phase - space scalings in each higher hierarchical state with @xmath39 and @xmath40 as order parameters .",
    "we would end up with the parisi full ( infinite ) rsb scheme .",
    "however , this is not the objective of this construction .",
    "we should produce at the end a solution that is globally thermodynamically homogeneous , the limit @xmath7 is scale independent .",
    "determining all the physical parameters @xmath39 and the geometric ones @xmath40 from the saddle - point equations of the @xmath41rsb free energy , we are left with the number of hierarchies @xmath41 as the only free parameter in this construction .",
    "this number will be fixed by reaching the global thermodynamic homogeneity .",
    "the solution becomes globally homogeneous when the free energy does not decay into a  higher nontrivial hierarchy , i.  e. , when the number of parameters @xmath42 does not increase when the phase space ( replica index ) is scaled .",
    "having the 1rsb free energy we have two possibilities how a 2rsb solution with @xmath43 may arise .",
    "first , @xmath44 and @xmath45 becomes unstable .",
    "it happens if    [ eq : stability-1rsb ] @xmath46 where we denoted @xmath47 $ ] , @xmath48 and @xmath49/\\left\\langle \\cosh^\\nu\\left[\\beta ( \\eta\\sqrt{q } + \\lambda\\sqrt{\\chi } ) \\right]\\right\\rangle_\\lambda$ ] .",
    "notice that condition is formally equivalent to the smallest replicon for 1rsb .",
    "second , @xmath50 and @xmath51 becomes unstable , which is the case if @xmath52 ^ 2\\right\\rangle_\\eta<0\\ .\\ ] ]    hence free energy becomes thermodynamically homogeneous if both numbers @xmath53 and @xmath54 from eqs .",
    "are nonnegative for the equilibrium scaling parameter  @xmath29 .",
    "it is never the case in the sk model but it may happen above the gardner temperature in the @xmath0-spin infinite - range model as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig:1-instab ] . in the p - spin model",
    "the stability parameters are only slightly modified @xmath55 , @xmath56 . for @xmath57",

    "successive scalings of the replica index lead to a formal dependence of the solution on the scaling parameter .",
    "the replica symmetric solution depends on the scaling parameter virtually only in the spin glass phase and hence gets unstable .",
    "the rsb scheme of parisi simultaneously with conditions for the global homogeneity ( scale invariance ) are then derived from successive scalings of the replica index by minimizing the incurred inhomogeneity ( demanding local homogeneity or scale invariance ) .",
