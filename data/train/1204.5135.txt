    "our results will be independent of the choice of orientation in this definition .    in order to obtain the convexification",
    "we must first understand how bad the boundary components of @xmath56 can be .",
    "we quantify how bad the boundary is by how many consecutive bad corners occur along it .",
    "two bad corners never occur consecutively on a boundary component of @xmath56 .",
    "let @xmath62 be a lift of @xmath40 to @xmath22 .",
    "lift every pentagon of @xmath56 to its lift that intersects @xmath63 .",
    "doing so , we have lifted all of @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "we call their lifts @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "now suppose we have a bad corner in @xmath56 formed by three pentagons @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 . we have lifted these three pentagons to @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 in @xmath22 . by construction , @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 intersect @xmath62 and form a bad corner , @xmath72 , on @xmath65 .",
    "translating by an element of @xmath20 , we may assume that @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 form the region in figure  1(a ) below .",
    "if we hit a second consecutive bad corner , @xmath73 , travelling along @xmath65 , then there exists a pentagon @xmath74 , as in figure  1(a ) above , that is one of the pentagons that forms @xmath73 . since @xmath69 , @xmath74 , @xmath62 must intersect both of those pentagons , but @xmath62 can not intersect any of the white pentagons between them .",
    "there is no such geodesic in @xmath22 .",
    "thus , there can never be two consecutive bad corners along a boundary component of @xmath56 .",
    "the result above is independent of the choice of orientation for the boundary component containing @xmath72 , so that two consecutive bad corners can never occur along a boundary component of @xmath56 with respect to either of the two choices of orientation for the boundary component .",
    "to each of the boundary components of @xmath56 we can associate a word , @xmath75 , in the letters @xmath0 and @xmath76 by reading off whether the consecutive corners are good or bad along the boundary component .",
    "for example , if a boundary component contains two bad corners and four good corners the word @xmath75 could be @xmath77 . for long words we will write @xmath78 , by which we mean that we are reading off only a portion of the corners along the boundary component . an immediate consequence of lemma 3.2 is the following .",
    "let @xmath79 be a bad corner of a boundary component of @xmath56 .",
    "then the word @xmath75 associated to that boundary component of @xmath56 must be of the form @xmath80 or @xmath81 .",
    "if @xmath79 is the only corner of that boundary component , then @xmath82 . if the boundary component consists of exactly two corners , lemma 3.2 tells us that @xmath83 where @xmath72 is another bad corner since bad corners never occur consecutively along @xmath57 .",
    "thus , @xmath84 or @xmath85 .",
    "if the boundary component has three or more corners , then again by lemma 3.2 we know that two bad corners never occur consecutively along @xmath57 regardless of the orientation we choose for the boundary component .",
    "thus , @xmath86 and @xmath87 , and @xmath75 must therefore be of the form @xmath88 .",
    "+    now we will attempt to convexify @xmath56 by adding pentagons near the bad corners and show that the number of pentagons needed can be bounded .",
    "so long as we are not in the case where @xmath89 , @xmath90 or @xmath91 ( see the note below ) , the picture at each bad corner looks like figure  2 below . if we extend the far geodesic edges of the good corners and add the pentagons that intersect @xmath56 lying between these two extended geodesic segments , we will have convexified this portion of @xmath56 .",
    "* note : * if @xmath89 , the lift of this component of @xmath57 to @xmath22 will look exactly like the figure above . in this case , the geodesics with the bold extensions will have been identified in @xmath56 and we will have convexified this boundary component .",
    "in fact , this one step is enough to obtain the convexification for the case where @xmath92 or @xmath93 as well .",
    "so in these cases the convexification procedure is complete here .",
    "+   + we follow this procedure for every bad corner of @xmath56 .",
    "as shown earlier , the bad corners of @xmath56 are separated by one or more good corners .",
    "we will see below that it is slightly easier to convexify portions of boundary components where bad corners are separated by two or more good corners so we will handle this case first .",
    "+   + _ case 1 : _",
    "suppose @xmath72 is a bad corner of @xmath56 and that travelling along @xmath57 , the next bad corner we hit , @xmath73 , is separated from @xmath72 by two or more good corners",
    ". then figure  3(a ) below shows that we have convexified the region around @xmath72 and @xmath73 and we need not add any more pentagons between the two bad corners .",
    "_ case 2 : _ suppose that @xmath73 is separated from @xmath72 by only one good corner , that is @xmath94 . then we will need to add one more pentagon of @xmath4 to @xmath56 , which will still have non - empty intersection with @xmath56 .    as seen in figure  3(b ) above , we have created a new bad corner during our attempt to convexify @xmath56 .",
    "however , we can simply add in the one missing pentagon , @xmath95 , which still intersects @xmath57 at one point .    after adding all such pentagons @xmath95",
    ", we have a set @xmath10 containing @xmath56 and obtained by adding pentagons that all intersect @xmath56 .",
    "@xmath10 is locally convex , and by the comments above @xmath10 is therefore the convexification of @xmath56 we were looking for .",
    "our next goal will be to obtain an upper bound on the number of pentagons in @xmath10 , the convex set obtained in the proof of theorem 3.1 .",
    "this bound will play a crucial role in proving our main result , theorem 7.1 .",
