    "most be / x - ray binaries show only temporal x - ray activity , i.e. , regular periodic outbursts at periastron ( type i ) and/or giant outbursts ( type ii ) with no orbital modulation .",
    "x - ray outbursts are considered to be caused by the mass - accretion onto the neutron star through the mass transfer from the be - star disk ( okazaki et al .",
    "recently , hayasaki & okazaki ( 2004 ) ( hereafter , paper  i ) studied the accretion flow around the neutron star in a be / x - ray binary with a short period ( @xmath0 ) and moderate eccentricity ( @xmath1 ) , using a three - dimensional ( 3d ) smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) code .",
    "they showed that a time - dependent accretion disk is formed around the neutron star .",
    "hayasaki & okazaki ( 2005 ) ( hereafter , paper  ii ) further showed that the disk has a one - armed spiral structure induced by a phase - dependent mass transfer from the be disk .",
    "these are , however , the results from simulations run over a period shorter than the viscous time - scale of the disk , and it was not known how the accretion disk evolves over a period longer than the viscous time - scale . in this paper , we study the long - period evolution of accretion disk around the neutron star in be / x - ray binaries , performing the 3d sph simulations .",
    "our simulations were performed by using the same 3d sph code as in paper  i , which was based on a version originally developed by benz ( benz 1990 ; benz et al .",
    "1990 ) and later by bate , bonnell & price ( 1995 ) . for the comparison purpose",
    ", we run the simulations with the same parameters of model  1 in paper  i , except that the number of injected particles per orbit is the three times less than that of model  1 in paper  i. the orbital period @xmath2 is 24.3d , the eccentricity @xmath3 is 0.34 , and the be disc is coplanar with the orbital plane .",
    "the inner radius of the simulation region @xmath4 is @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the semi - major axis of the binary .",
    "the polytropic equation of state with the exponent @xmath7 is adopted .",

    "fig.1 shows the evolution of several non - axisymmetric modes with an improved definition of the mode strength in paper  ii .",
    "the solid - thin , dotted and solid - thick lines denote the strengths of @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 modes , respectively . from fig.1",
    ", we note that the @xmath9 component dominates the other components throughout the run .",
    "the top panel of fig.2 shows the evolution of the mass - accretion rate and the corresponding x - ray luminosity , whereas the bottom and the middle panel shows orbital - phase dependence of the peak of mass - accretion rate and its frequency distribution , respectively .",
    "it is noted from these figures that the mass - accretion rate has double peaks per orbit at an initial developing stage ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "while the first peak is due to the direct accretion of particles with the low specific angular momentum , the second one is mainly caused by an inward propagation of @xmath9 mode . after the disk is fully developed ( @xmath13 ) , the mass accretion rate has a single peak per orbit only due to the wave induced accretion .     in units of @xmath14 ( the top panel ) and orbital - phase dependence of the peak of mass - accretion rate ( the bottom panel ) and its frequency distribution ( the middle panel ) . in the top panel ,",

    "the horizontal dotted line denotes the averaged mass transfer rate from the be disk . in the bottom panel ,",

    "we have performed 3d sph simulations in order to study the long - period evolution of the accretion disk around the neutron star in be / x - ray binaries .",
    "as shown in left panel of fig.2 , the mass - accretion rate gradually increases with the stable material - supply from the be disk .",
    "this strongly suggests the accretion disk finally gets to a quasi - steady state as the third evolutionary stage . on the other hand ,",
    "the right panel of fig.2 have shown that after the disk is fully developed , the peak of mass - accretion rate is distributed distinct from the periastron due to an inward propagation of the one - armed spiral wave .",
    "this indicates that the x - ray maxima distinct from the periastron could provide circumstatial evidence for an persistent disk around the neutron star in be / x - ray binaries .",
