    "in spite of the long history and substantial amount of spectroscopic studies of a - type stars on the upper main sequence , we do not know yet much about their photospheric abundances of sodium .",
    "the primary reason for this paucity may be attributed to the fact that available na lines are quite limited in such comparatively hot early - type stars , because na atoms are easily ionized to make na  i lines quickly fade out as @xmath5 becomes higher ( reflecting the characteristic of alkali elements having one valence electron weakly bound ) while lines of na  ii ( closed shell ) are hopeless to detect .    as a matter of fact , many of the past spectroscopic studies of a dwarfs which reported na abundances have placed emphasis on late a - type or am stars of comparatively lower @xmath5 ( typically at @xmath12  k ) where subordinate na  i lines such as those at 5683/5688 or 6154/6161  @xmath13 are still measurable ( e.g. , lane & lester 1987 ; varenne & monier 1999 ; gebran et al . 2008 ; gebran & monier 2008 ; fossati et al . 2007 , 2008 ) .",
    "meanwhile , early - a stars have been rarely investigated in this respect ; actually , challenges of na abundance determinations were done mostly for very bright stars such as vega ( cf .",
    "takeda 2008 and references therein ) or sirius ( cf .",
    "kohl 1964 ; takeda & takada - hidai 1994 ) , while trials did not turn out successful when improper lines were used ( e.g. , hill & landstreet 1993 ) .",
    "besides , another problem is the bias toward sharp - line stars of slow rotation , since the na  i lines at 5683/5688 or 6154/6161  @xmath13 which have been normally used as mentioned above , tend to be washed out in rapid rotators because of their weakness .",
    "this is especially the case for early a stars , even though nowadays analyses invoking an efficient spectrum synthesis technique have succeeded in establishing the na abundances of rapidly rotating late - a or am stars ( see the literature this decade mentioned above ) .",
    "now , it appears for us necessary to try understanding the nature of photospheric na abundances in `` general '' a - type stars .",
    "for example , a special attention has recently been paid to sodium in relation to a special group of weak - lined a - type stars ( @xmath14  bootis stars ) , which spread in a wide @xmath5 range ( from early to late a - type ) and generally rotate rapidly .",
    "that is , their photospheric abundances of na , showing a large diversity from supersolar to subsolar unlike other metals being generally deficient , appear to correlate with the na composition of the ambient interstellar matter , which indicates that accretion of interstellar gas onto a star may have played some role in building up the photospheric chemical peculiarity ( cf .",
    "kamp & paunzen 2002 ; paunzen et al .",
    "if such an external mechanism is involved , a question naturally arises whether such an effect is limited only to a group of rapid rotators or it can also influence other normal a - type stars . in this respect",
    ", it is important and worthwhile to explore the na abundances of an unbiased sample of early - to - late a - type stars in a large range of @xmath1 , which has never been challenged to our knowledge .",
    "if we are to contend with this task , there is no other way than to invoke the na  i resonance lines at 5890/5896  @xmath13 ( d@xmath15 and d@xmath16 ) in the orange region of stellar spectra , which are so strong as to be visible in spectra of any a - type stars no matter high @xmath5 or @xmath1 is .",
    "however , it is not necessarily easy to use these d lines for na abundance determinations .",
    "apart from the practical complexities in terms of superficial spectrum appearance ( e.g. , necessity of removing nuisance telluric lines of water vapor existing in this wavelength region , need of applying a spectrum synthesis technique in case of rapid rotators where doublet lines are merged with each other ) , an important point is that these lines suffer a strong non - lte effect , which has to be taken into account by all means .",
    "for this reason , several old studies which treated na  i 5890/5896 lines in lte are hardly reliable .    and yet , researches in this field are still insufficient . to our knowledge",
    ", only a few studies on the non - lte effect of neutral na lines applicable to a - type stars have been done so far : +  takeda and takada - hidai ( 1994 ) carried out a non - lte analysis by using published equivalent width ( @xmath17 ) data of various sodium lines for sirius ( a1  v ) as a by - product study of a  f supergiants .",
    "+  based on extensive statistical equilibrium calculations , mashonkina , shimanski , and sakhibullin ( 2000 ) computed non - lte corrections of various na  i spectral lines for a wide range of atmospheric parameters ( 4000  k  @xmath18  k , @xmath19 , and @xmath20  [ x / h ]  @xmath21 ) . +  andrievsky et al . ( 2002 ) determined na abundances of twelve @xmath14  bootis candidates ( including rapid rotators ) from na  i d@xmath15 and d@xmath16 lines by taking into account the non - lte effect .",
    "+  an intensive na abundance study of vega ( a0  v ) , while taking account of the non - lte as well as the gravity - darkening effect , has recently been carried out by takeda ( 2008 ) .    in the latest work of takeda ( 2008 )",
    ", a remarkable consistency was obtained between the na abundances of vega derived from 8 lines ( at 5683/5688 , 5890/5896 , 6154/6161 , 8183/8195  @xmath13 ) showing widely different non - lte corrections .",
    "encouraged by this success of our non - lte calculations , we decided to conduct an extensive na abundance study on a large unbiased sample of a - type main - sequence stars based on non - lte analyses of na  i 5890/5896 lines , with an intention of clarifying the behavior of photospheric sodium abundances as well as their dependence ( if any ) upon stellar parameters such as @xmath5 or @xmath1 , since high - dispersion spectra for @xmath2  120 a dwarfs just suitable for this purpose were timely available to us .",
    "this was the original motivation of the present investigation .",
    "in the course of our study , however , we began to realize that our results appear rather questionable and can not be simply taken at face values , which indicates that the procedure of our analyses needs to be reexamined , especially for late- to mid - a stars where the microturbulent velocity is generally considered to be enhanced . more specifically ,",
    "we have arrived at a conclusion that appropriately choosing the turbulent velocity parameter ( and correctly understanding the atmospheric velocity field ) is essential for establishing reliable na abundances from the strong high - forming na  i resonance lines , which does not seem to be an easy task at all .",
    "thus , the purpose of this paper is to describe this outturn in detail .",

    "to say the least , a @xmath91 value as low as @xmath94  km  s@xmath3 , which is required to raise [ na / h]@xmath4 at @xmath7  k by @xmath95  dex to make it consistent with [ na / h]@xmath4 ( cf .",

    "returning to late - a dwarfs ( @xmath7  k ) of our primary concern , such an empirical study on the depth - dependence of @xmath11 seems to be lacking to our knowledge .",
    "however , we may reasonably assume that the origin of @xmath11 is due to convective overshooting as in f ",
    "g dwarfs , since the reason why @xmath11 attains a maximum value in this temperature range is considered be that the convection zone comes fairly close to the surface atmospheric layer , which means that decreasing @xmath11 with an increase in height would equally apply to this case .",
    "interestingly , freytag and steffen s ( 2004 ; cf .",
    "figure 2 therein ) 3d numerical simulations of convection in the atmosphere of late - a stars ( @xmath101  k ) shows that the r.m.s .",
    "dispersion of the vertical component of the turbulent velocity ( @xmath102 ) steeply declines with height from @xmath2  4  km  s@xmath3 ( at @xmath103  mm ) down to @xmath2  1  km  s@xmath3 ( at @xmath104  mm ) , followed by a small up and down ( between @xmath2  0.5  km  s@xmath3 and @xmath2  2  km  s@xmath3 ) at @xmath105  12  mm .",
    "since the difference of the geometrical height between the optically - thin layer ( e.g. , @xmath106 to @xmath107 ) and the continuum - forming layer ( @xmath108 ) is on the order of @xmath2  0.40.8  mm in the atmosphere of a - type dwarfs , their simulation indicates that @xmath11 quickly decreases from @xmath2  4  km  s@xmath3 to @xmath2  1  km  s@xmath3 over the whole range of the atmosphere relevant for line formation .",
    "such a theoretical prediction , suggesting a progressive attenuation of @xmath11 over the line - forming region with increasing height , favorably lends support for our interpretation .    in order to assess the impact of this effect on the abundance derived from na  i 5890/5896 lines",
    ", we performed a test calculation based on a simple model of depth - dependent @xmath11 , decreasing linearly in terms of @xmath109 from 4  km  s@xmath3 ( at @xmath110 ) to 1  km  s@xmath3 ( at @xmath111 , where @xmath112 is a free parameter controling the gradient of @xmath11 ) ; that is , @xmath11 = 4  km  s@xmath3 ( at @xmath113 ) , @xmath114  km  s@xmath3 ( at @xmath115 ) , and @xmath11 = 1  km  s@xmath3 ( at @xmath116 ) .",
    "as an example , we selected the sharp - line star hd  40932 ( @xmath117  k , @xmath118 , @xmath119  km  s@xmath3 ) , for which [ na / h]@xmath4 (= @xmath120 ) and [ na / h]@xmath10 (= @xmath121 ) show a considerable disagreement ( 0.64  dex ) with each other ( cf .",
    "table 1 ) .",
    "we determined [ na / h]@xmath4 with this microturbulence model for three cases of @xmath112 = @xmath122 , @xmath123 , and @xmath97 , and found that the corresponding abundance changes ( compared to the standard value derived from the constant @xmath11 of 4.0  km  s@xmath3 ) were + 0.47 , + 0.62 , and + 0.81 ( for the 5890 line ) and + 0.35 , + 0.48 , and + 0.66 ( for the 5896 line ) , respectively .",
    "these corrections are sufficient to raise [ na / h]@xmath4 to remove the discrepancy of 0.64  dex between [ na / h]@xmath4 and [ na / h]@xmath10 , since the latter abundance derived from the weak na  i 6154/6161 lines ( @xmath124  m@xmath13 ) are practically unaffected by any change of @xmath11 .",
    "consequently , we would conclude that the decreasing @xmath11 with the atmospheric height is the cause for the erroneous underestimation of [ na / h]@xmath4 .",
    "if we are ever to derive the correct sodium abundance from na  i 5890/5896 lines , a classical uniform ( depth - independent ) microturbulence is hardly applicable any more .",
    "it would be inevitable to take into account the realistic depth - dependent turbulent velocity field ( preferably based on detailed 3d hydrodynamical simulations ) .      finally ,",
    "even though we were thus obliged to conclude that the [ na / h ] results for 122 a - type stars we derived from na  i 5890/5896 lines were considerably underestimated and should not be taken at face values , it would still be meaningful to discuss their apparent dependence on other parameters .",
    "the trend of underabundance in [ na / h ] ( most prominent for late - a stars of @xmath7k ) appears to become progressively insignificant toward higher @xmath5 and eventually ends up with [ na / h ]  @xmath9 at @xmath82  k ( cf .",
    "figure 5c ) , which may be explained by ( 1 ) the lowered sensitivity of [ na / h ] to @xmath11 because of the weakened ( less saturated ) @xmath17 , and ( 2 ) the decreasing tendency of @xmath11 with height may not be manifest any more because of the practical disappearance of the convection zone ( cf .",
    "3rd paragraph in the previous subsection ) .",
    "regarding the dependence of rotation , [ na / h ] appears to show a systematic decrease with an increase in @xmath1 as displayed in figure 7a .",
    "since [ fe / h ] also shows such a tendency ( am - like overabundance exhibited by slowly - rotating stars disappears in rapid rotators ; cf . figure 8e or paper i ) , a positive correlation is apparently seen between [ na / h ] and [ fe / h ] ( figure 7b ) . while this might indicate that an anomaly of na abundance is built - up in a manner similar to that of fe ( i.e. , advent of na excess in slow rotators ) , we are not sure whether this is really the case , since na ( in a marked contrast to fe ) is not considered to show an appreciable abundance peculiarity according to the recent theory of atomic diffusion ( e.g. , richer et al .",
    "rather , we would consider a possibility that the discrepancy of @xmath11 between high and lower layer ( i.e. , decreasing rate of @xmath11 with atmospheric height ) may become more exaggerated ( and the erroneous underabundance due to the use of improper @xmath11 being more prominent ) as a star rotates higher , though whether such an effect is theoretically reasonable is yet to be investigated .",
    "based on the high - dispersion spectrum data obtained with the 1.8  m reflector and boes spectrograph at bohyunsan optical astronomy observatory , we determined the sodium abundances of 122 slowly- as well as rapidly - rotating a - type stars from the na  i 5890/5896 doublet lines , while including the non - lte effect based on detailed statistical - equilibrium calculations , in order to check whether the na abundances in such a dwarfs can be reliably established from such strong resonance lines , and ( if possible ) to investigate the behavior of [ na / h ] for such dwarf stars on the upper main sequence in the @xmath5 range of @xmath2  700010000  k. regarding the important parameter of atmospheric microturbulence dispersion ( @xmath11 ) , we adopted an empirically derived analytical formula as a function of @xmath5 , which presents @xmath11 in the range of @xmath2  24 km  s@xmath3 with a peak at @xmath7  k    we found that the resulting abundances ( [ na / h ] ) relative to the standard star procyon ( equivalent to the sun ) turned out generally negative with a large diversity ( from @xmath8 to @xmath9 ) , while showing a sign of @xmath1-dependence ( decreasing toward higher rotation ) .    however , the credibility of these apparent trends is very questionable , since such abundances derived from strong @xmath11-sensitive na  i  5890/5896 lines are appreciably lower by @xmath2  0.30.6  dex than the abundances based on the weak na  i 6154/6161 lines ( which are much more reliable but usable only for sharp - line stars ) .",
    "we thus concluded that our na abundances from these na  i resonance d lines must have been erroneously underestimated .",
    "we suspect that this failure may be attributed to the possible depth - dependence ( i.e. , a decreasing tendency with height ) of @xmath11 expected for turbulent velocity field of convective overshooting origin , which implies that the conventionally determined @xmath11 values ( e.g. , from the equivalent widths of fe lines ) are improperly too large to apply to such strong high - forming na  i 5890/5896 lines .",
    "although it turned out unfortunately unsuccessful to establish the sodium abundances of a dwarfs from the na  i d lines , in spite of our original intention , one should not consider that these strong lines are practically useless . on the contrary",
    ", they may be used as an important touchstone for any sophisticated theory or 3d hydrodynamical simulation of the complicated velocity field in the atmosphere of a - type stars , possibly with the requirement that [ na / h ] should have a value close to @xmath9 for normal stars .",
    "we would have to wait until we have a clear understanding about this velocity field , before being able to determine reliable na abundances therefrom .",
    "this research has made use of the simbad database , operated by cds , strasbourg , france .",

    "as described in subsection 3.2 , we determined @xmath1 , [ o / h ] , [ si / h ] , [ ca / h ] , [ ba / h ] , and [ fe / h ] for 122 program stars by way of the synthetic spectrum fitting in the 61406170  @xmath13 region as in paper i. since the number of stars has been considerably increased ( compared to the study in paper i ) and the present sample includes 23 a - type stars of the hyades cluster ( which can be used as a desirable probe of `` posteriori '' acquired peculiarity since their initial composition must have been almost uniform ) , it may be worthwhile to reexamine the @xmath1-dependence of [ x / h ] based on the present results .    in figures 8a  e are shown the [ x / h ] values for each 5 elements plotted against @xmath1 . comparing these figures with figures 10b , c , d , f , and g in paper i",
    ", we could confirm that the present results are naturally consistent with what was concluded in paper i , while some trends / problems have become newly apparent thanks to the considerably enlarged sample : +  am - like abundance peculiarities ( i.e. , underabundances of o and ca , overabundances of fe and ba ) depends upon the rotational velocity ( i.e. , decrease with increasing @xmath1 ) at 0  km  s@xmath125  km  s@xmath3 .",
    "+  at @xmath126  km  s@xmath3 , [ o / h ] , [ ca / h ] , and [ fe / h ] are almost constant at @xmath9 .",
    "+  regarding hyades a stars , the behaviors of [ o / h ] and [ fe / h ] ( along with the mutual anti - correlation ) are almost in agreement with the conclusion of takeda and sadakane ( 1997a ) , though the @xmath1-dependence appears to be limited at @xmath127  km  s@xmath3 rather than the wider @xmath1 range of @xmath128  km  s@xmath3 suggested in that paper . +",
    " the large scatter in [ si / h ] ( cf . figure 8) would simply reflect that these results are not sufficiently reliable ( especially for rapid rotators or higher-@xmath5 stars ) because they are based on comparative weak si  i lines .",
    "actually , [ si / h ] could not be determined for a number of stars ( cf .",
    "table 1 ) . +  that [ ba / h ] of high rotators ( @xmath126  km  s@xmath3 ) becomes appreciably subsolar ( figure 8d ; also recognizable in figure 10f of paper i ) is presumably unreal and should not be earnestly taken .",
    "we suspect that this may be the same phenomenon as seen in [ na / h ] of rapid rotators ( figure 7a ) , to which a hypothetical explanation described at the end of subsection 5.4 might apply .",
