    "in recent years several photometric and spectroscopic snapshot surveys of 3c radio galaxies have been carried out using the hubble space telescope , approaching the statistical completeness of the radio catalog .",
    "a ground based spectroscopic survey for the whole sample with the galileo telescope has been completed @xcite and deep ground based infrared images are also available in @xmath1-band .",
    "radio images with arcsecond resolution for the majority of the 3c sources are available from the nrao vla archive survey ( nvas ) and in the archives of the vla and merlin observatories .",
    "a few radio maps were made available to us by our colleagues .",
    "finally , vlba data for several of the 3c objects with @xmath2 have already been obtained ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .    to extend the wavelength coverage , we embarked on a 3c snapshot survey in the x - rays with _",
    "chandra _ , the only x - ray facility with angular resolution comparable to that at optical and radio frequencies .",
    "previous x - ray studies were mostly based on samples of x - ray bright sources or objects with well - known peculiarities instead of carefully selected and complete samples , unbiased with respect to orientation and spectroscopic classification as is the 3c catalog . however , 60 sources in the 3c sample @xcite , at z@xmath00.3 remained unobserved by _ chandra _  before cycle 9 , when we started our snapshot survey . in our first paper @xcite , we reported the data reduction and analysis procedures used to study the first 30 radio sources , while in this work we present a similar investigation of the remaining 27 sources to complete the sample at z@xmath3 .",
    "the main aims of our snapshot survey are to detect x - ray emission from jets and hot spots , to eventually determine their x - ray emission processes on a firm statistical basis , and to study the nuclear emission of the host galaxy .",
    "we also want to obtain the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of an unbiased sample of nuclear and non - nuclear features . in a future paper , the resulting dataset",
    "will be used to test the fanaroff - riley dichotomy in terms of differences in the nature of nuclear absorption in fri and frii sources .",
    "however , it is first necessary to obtain the basic source parameters for the newly acquired data , so this paper consists of these data for the remaining 3c radio galaxies at z@xmath00.3 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : a brief description of the observations and data reduction procedures is given is   [ sec : obs ] ; the general and particular ( i.e. , single source ) results are described in   [ sec : results ] .",
    "the conclusions and a short summary are given in ",
    "[ sec : summary ] .    for our numerical results ,",
    "we use cgs units unless stated otherwise and we assume a flat cosmology with @xmath4 km s@xmath5 mpc@xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "spectral indices , @xmath8 , are defined by flux density , s@xmath9 .",
    "our data reduction and data analysis procedures are described in massaro et al .",
    "( 2009a , 2010 ) , here we provide only an overview .",
    "the sources observed in this project are listed in table  1 together with their salient parameters .",
    "each was observed for a nominal 8 ksec , and the actual livetimes are given in table  [ table2 ] , together with the nuclear fluxes .",
    "we used the acis - s back illuminated chip in very faint mode with standard frame times ( 3.2s ) .",
    "all the observations had 4 chips turned on : i2 , i3 , s2 , and s3 .",
    "the data reduction has been performed following the standard reduction procedure described in the _ chandra _  interactive analysis of observations ( ciao ) threads , using ciao v4.4 and the _ chandra _  calibration database ( caldb ) version 4.4.8 .",
    "level 2 event files were generated using the @xmath10 task .",
    "events were filtered for grades 0,2,3,4,6 .",
    "lightcurves for every dataset were extracted and checked for high background intervals ; none was found .",
    "astrometric registration was achieved by changing the appropriate keywords in the fits header so as to align the nuclear x - ray position with that of the radio .",
    "the celestial coordinates of the x - ray nuclei were measured on displays of the event file which were regridded to a pixel size of 0.0615@xmath11 , energy filtered for 0.5 to 7 kev , and smoothed with a gaussian of fwhm = 0.35@xmath11 or less .",
    "a similar measurement was made on the radio image and the difference in each coordinate provided the amount of the required shift . in most cases ,",
    "the total shift @xmath12 was of order 0.4  or less .",

    "the application of the jdpileup model in sherpa[multiblock footnote omitted ] @xcite and in xspec @xcite for our data is discussed in @xmath60[sec : spectra ] .    as described in @xmath603.2 of harris et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , we have verified that the standard grade filtering that is applied to all acis data in pipeline processing means that a fraction of piled events are rejected in passing from the event 1 files to event 2 .",
    "this is caused by grade migration , an inevitable consequence of pielup @xcite .",
    "thus we choose the ratio of countrates ( evt1/evt2 ) as a robust diagnostic of pileup . in figure",
    "[ fig : pileup ] we demonstrate this for our sources by plotting the ratio against the event 1 counts per frame .",
    "we have also checked weaker sources and verified that their evt1 and evt2 countrates are equal within the errors .",
    "we have used pimms to elucidate what this means in terms of pileup fraction . while pimms does not accommodate grade migration , by using the evt1 countrate , we are able to derive all necessary quantities . for a series of input",
    "c / s to pimms , with a power law spectrum of @xmath29=1 and no absorption , pimms returns the fractional countrate , fp which is the fraction of piled events to total ( i.e. evt1 ) events .",

    "thus the total countrate ( our observed evt1 c / s ) is given by : @xmath61 in judging ` how bad things can get ' , we prefer a new parameter , f@xmath62 , rather than the reported fraction of piled to total events .",
    "we define f@xmath62 as the fraction of incoming _ photons _ which loose their identity to the total number of incoming photons .",
    "so f@xmath62 tells us what fraction of the total photons end up in piled events : @xmath63 where in is the input c / s to pimms , and out is the count rate pimms reports , i.e. the unpiled rate .",
    "f@xmath62 is plotted in figure  [ fig : pileup ] .",
    "the obvious question then is , `` as counts / frame increase , when would we start getting significantly wrong spectral parameters from sherpa ? '' .",
    "the answer to this question is not unique : it depends on the spectral distribution of the source and on the accuracy of our estimates of spectral parameters ( and hence on the number of events available for spectral analysis ) . for our purposes , we subjectively assign 0.2 cnts / frame ( where more than 10% of incoming photons end up in piled events ) as the threshold above which , we should be circumspect of spectral parameters . for our data with 3.2s frame time and an exposure time of 8ks",

    "our results have also been compared with a detailed spectral analysis that has been performed only for the bright nuclei ( see   [ sec : spectra ] ) .",

    "the expected hardness ratio @xmath64 can be computed using the x - ray fluxes in the hard and in the medium band",
    ".    however , we remark that if a generic source is compton thick ( i.e. , n@xmath28 > 10@xmath78 @xmath17 ) or if its x - ray spectrum is inverted ( i.e. @xmath29 <",
    "0 ) the hardness ratios can not provide a good estimate of absorption .",
    "in particular , for compton thick sources , even if they are very rare among radio loud agns , the spectrum could be dominated by a reflection component providing a low estimate of the intrinsic absorption even if the source is heavily absorbed .",
    "this could also occur if the intrinsic spectrum has some features , as for example emission lines , that only a detailed spectral fitting procedure can reveal providing the correct estimate of n@xmath28 .",
    "thus , values of the intrinsic absorption estimated via photometry ( i.e. , hardness ratios ) could be different with respect to those evaluated from spectral analysis and are thus only indicative of the presence of the absorbing material .",
    "on the other hand , due to the relatively short exposure times of our snapshot survey , we often can not recover the parameters of interest ( @xmath29 and n@xmath28 ) from the spectral fits but it is possible to derive a range of intrinsic n@xmath28 column densities corresponding to some chosen range in @xmath29 by using simulated spectra .",
