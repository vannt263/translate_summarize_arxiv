    "embedded protostars are the youngest protostars , emitting most of their light at far - infrared wavelengths .",
    "after collapse begins , the protostar forms and accretes mass from the envelope , and a wind and/or jet is formed , which sweeps up material into a molecular outflow .",
    "the radiation from the protostar encounters a thick and dense envelope on its way out from the center .",
    "therefore , embedded protostars can only be observed at infrared and submillimeter wavelengths unless they are seen face - on .",
    "observationally , protostars are classified by their radiation at infrared wavelengths .",
    "@xcite introduced the @xmath1-index , classifying protostars into class  i , ii , and iii based on the shape of the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) in the near - infrared to mid - infrared .",
    "observations at submillimeter wavelengths suggested that a subset of class  i protostars were especially embedded , based on the ratio of the submillimeter luminosity ( @xmath2350@xmath3 m ) to the bolometric luminosity , @xmath4 .",
    "@xcite defined class  0 protostars as sources that have @xmath5% . @xcite classified protostars by their bolometric temperatures : @xmath6 below 70  k for class 0 ; 70 - 650  k for class i ; 651 - 2880  k for class ii ; and above 2880  k for class iii .",
    "the different methods of classification generally agree , but some sources receive different classifications from different methods .    the distinction between sed classes and physical stages was emphasized by @xcite .",
    "the detailed relation between the classes defined by seds and the theoretical stages of protostellar evolution is still unclear , but recent studies have shown a generally good , though imperfect , correlation between class i sources and stage i sources .",
    "the general path of star formation starts from the collapse of a dense core due to gravitational instability , forming a protostar at the center of the core .",
    "@xcite showed that the collapse of a singular isothermal core follows a similarity solution .",
    "this model begins with an isothermal core near hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "the collapse starts at the center ; once the central region begins collapsing , the shell adjacent to the collapsing region loses pressure support and starts to fall in . a wave of infall propagates outward through the envelope at the sound speed .",
    "( we use the term `` envelope '' to describe the surrounding gas and dust that is not in the star , the disk , or the outflow . ) the original model @xcite simplified the collapse process by neglecting rotation , turbulence , and magnetic fields .",
    "rotational motion has been widely observed in young stellar objects .",
    "the conservation of angular momentum implies a small but non - zero rotational speed for the pre - collapse core .",
    "@xcite ( hereafter tsc ) generalized the shu model by including the effect of rotational motion , making the inner part of envelope flatten toward the equatorial plane .",
    "the angular momentum of a dense core is much larger than that of a main - sequence star , suggesting that angular momentum must be removed from the core by some mechanism , most likely involving magnetic fields .",
    "a large magnetic field can suppress the fragmentation of the envelope @xcite or slow the rotation @xcite . while these effects may be important",
    ", the tsc model used here does not consider the magnetic field .",
    "incorporating a magnetic field and turbulence is beyond the scope of this study .",
    "when material falls inward , the centrifugal barrier becomes important at the centrifugal radius , where the centrifugal force is comparable to the gravitational force .",
    "bipolar outflows , which are widely observed around objects that have accretion activities , remove angular momentum from the system by ejecting material along the rotational axis at high velocity .",
    "the outflow process involves a highly collimated atomic or molecular jet or wind ( @xmath7 ) and a less collimated molecular outflow ( @xmath81 - 30 ) consisting of shells of gas swept up by the high velocity jet @xcite .",
    "the molecular outflow in class 0 protostars sweeps up the envelope and carves out an outflow cavity .",
    "the low density in the outflow cavity makes the cavity wall more exposed to the ultraviolet radiation from the central protostar , producing numerous molecular and atomic fine - structure lines observed by _ herschel _  space observatory .",
    "modeling the energetics of the  and water lines shows that different types of shocks contribute to most of the emission , but a general consensus has not been reached on the detailed structure of shocks among different class 0 objects .",
    "synthetic seds of protostars calculated with 3-d radiative transfer simulations provide a direct comparison with observations to test the models of star formation @xcite .",
    "@xcite modeled protostars with a fully collapsing envelope , a flared disk , an outflow cavity with a constant dust density , and a central luminosity source , and they simulated a grid of seds of the protostars with a wide variety of parameters .",
    "this grid of seds serves as a tool to understand the structure of individual protostars before an in - depth modeling @xcite . @xcite",
    "developed 1-d evolutionary models assuming steady accretion and an inside - out collapse .",
    "@xcite used a more complicated 2-d model setup that included episodic accretion and a rotating , collapsing envelope to obtain better agreement of the evolution of low - mass protostars throughout different stages with the observed population of protostars in different classes .",
    "radiative transfer calculations also play an important role in hydrodynamic simulations of star formation to realize the synthetic images and seds to compare with measured properties in simulations or observations @xcite .",
    "bhr71 is a bok globule , apparently associated with the southern coalsack .",
    "the distance of the coalsack is generally taken to be 200  pc , but some recent studies suggest a closer distance of 150  pc .",
    "we adopt 200  pc as the distance of bhr71 for better comparison with other studies of this source .",
    "emission was found in bhr71 by @xcite .",
    "@xcite ( hereafter b97 ) discovered a strong bipolar molecular outflow , estimated an outflow dynamical age of 10000 years , and concluded that the outflow was almost in the plane of sky , with an inclination angle of @xmath9 .",
    "observations in the _ herschel _  key program , _ dust , ice , and gas in time _",

    "bhr71 was observed by the pacs and spire instruments on _ herschel_. the pacs spectra come from the digit _ herschel _  key program , while the spire spectra come from the _ herschel _ open time program , co in protostars ( cops , pi : j.  green ) .",
    "the pacs instrument is a 5@xmath135 array of 9.4@xmath139.4  spatial pixels ( hereafter `` spaxels '' ) covering wavelengths from 50 to 210  with @xmath14  1000 - 3000 .",
    "the spatial resolution of pacs ranges from @xmath15  9  at 50  to @xmath15  18  at 210 , corresponding to 1800 - 3600  au at the distance of bhr71 .",
    "the regions observed with pacs and spire are indicated in figure  [ fig : footprint ] .",
    "the spire instrument is a fourier - transform spectrometer ( fts ) .",
    "there are two bands on spire covering @xmath16  ( ssw ; spectrograph short wavelengths ) and 303 - 671  ( slw ; spectrograph long wavelengths ) with @xmath14  @xmath17 .",
    "the spatial resolution of spire ranges from 17 - 40 , corresponding to 3400 - 8000  au at the distance of bhr71 .",
    "the on - source exposure times for pacs and spire spectra are 7268 seconds and 3168 seconds respectively , achieving line flux rms values of @xmath18 and @xmath19 respectively .",
    "there are two types of data products used in this study : the datacube product is used for comparing the spatial distribution of emission lines ; the extracted source spectrum , 1-d spectrum , is used for comparing to the radiative transfer simulation .",
    "the datacube products are collected from the herschel science archive , processed with spg v14.0.1 ( pacs ) and spg v14.1.0 ( spire ) .",
    "the calibrations for pacs and spire are version 72 and ` spire_cal_14_2 ` , respectively .",
    "the 1-d spectrum is extracted from the pacs and spire data cubes with two different methods that best represent the nature of the source and instruments .",
    "the size of bhr71 is larger than a single spaxel of pacs and spire , except for the spire long wavelength spectrometer array ( slw ) .",
    "therefore , neither a standard point source calibration nor an extended source calibration is suitable for extracting the entire observation into a single spectrum . for pacs ,",
    "we aim to extract a 1-d spectrum that best matches the spire spectrum .",
    "the 1-d spectrum is calculated from all pacs spaxels ( total 25 spaxels ) weighted by their fraction of pixel area within a circular aperture centered at the central spaxel .",
    "the size of the aperture is chosen to be 31.8 , yielding a flux in a same area as the central 3x3 spaxels , to match the spire spectrum .",
    "for the photometry , we measure the fluxes within the same aperture in three pacs bands ( 70  , 100  , and 160  ) with the aperture correction described in the data analysis guide ( section 4.21.2.4 ) .",
    "the images observed in the open time program led by j. tobin are collected from the herschel science archive without any further reduction .",
    "the spire images are collected in the same fashion as the pacs images .    for spire",
    ", we utilize the semi - extended corrector tool ( sect ) in herschel interactive processing environment ( hipe ) v.14 in the spectral calibration .",
    "the purpose of sect is mitigate the difference between the two modules ( ssw and slw ) due to the beam size dependence on wavelength and the fact that the source is semi - resolved .",
    "the detailed procedures are illustrated in @xcite .",
    "here we highlight the critical steps .",
    "sect fits a source size for a given source model , which we choose to be a 2-d gaussian , and scales the entire spectrum into a wavelength - independent gaussian reference beam .",
    "there are two sect processes in our calibration pipeline .",
    "the first one fits the source size with the default gaussian reference beam ( 40 ) .",
    "the second one runs with the fitted source size without further optimization , and scales the spectrum into a gaussian reference beam with the same size as the fitted source size .",
    "the photometry fluxes at three spire bands ( 250  , 350  , and 500  ) are calculated by performing aperture photometry on the extended source corrected images with beam correction , color correction and aperture correction . the aperture sizes are set to be the convolution of the fitted source size and the mean fwhm of the beam at each band ( see table  [ tbl : phot ] ) .",
    "after the data reduction , we performed a comprehensive and robust line fitting process to the spectrum of each spaxel as well as the 1-d spectrum . to make the fitting process general , we aimed to fit every line that fell into the range of wavelength of the spectra for several molecular and atomic species .",
    "the line information was collected from the leiden atomic and molecular database and the cologne database for molecular spectroscopy ( cdms ; @xcite ) to construct a comprehensive line list including , , , oh ladders and atomic fine - structure emission lines , except for the [ n  ii ] line centroids , which were adopted from the measurement in the cdf archive ( figure  6 in @xcite ) . for each region where a line could be ,",
    "we performed multiple stages of calculations , in which baselines were fitted with second - order polynomials and lines were fitted with single or double gaussian profiles from a continuum - subtracted spectrum .",
    "the core fitting method is mpfit , levenberg - marquardt non - linear least squares minimization @xcite .",
    "the fitting process is described in the next paragraph .    at the wavelength of each possible line ,",
    "the fitting routine first fits the baseline locally , then subtracts the fitted baseline from the spectrum , and finally fits the line with baseline - subtracted spectrum .",
    "this procedure is denoted as `` the first fitting '' .",
    "although the line profile is extracted by `` the first fitting '' , its noise estimation might be contaminated by nearby lines . a line - free spectrum derived from the subtraction of any significant line in `` the first fitting '' serves as the pure noise spectrum in the second fitting which is exactly the same as `` the first fitting '' except for the noise input .",
    "accurate noise estimation around the line centroid can be retrieved by combining the result of second fit and the noise spectrum from the first fit .",
    "the third , final , fitting is performed with this estimated noise as the uncertainty of the spectrum to get the best fit line flux and uncertainty .    in the baseline fitting , we selected a region of @xmath2010 spectral resolution elements around the line centroid .",
    "any wavelength that could possibly have a line is not considered as a valid data point for baseline fitting in order to get the proper baseline without being affected by nearby lines .",
    "most of the emission lines are fitted with a single gaussian profile to the baseline - subtracted spectrum .",
    "but sometimes multiple lines lie too close in wavelength so that a single gaussian profile is insufficient to decouple them .",
    "therefore , we perform a double gaussian profile fitting for a few heavily blended regions .",
    "to reduce the degrees of freedom , the line centroids and widths are fixed to theoretical values and the corresponding spectral resolution .",
    "the line width was allowed to vary within @xmath2030%  of the spectral resolution for fitting of isolated lines in the spire spectra but was fixed for pacs spectra .",
    "one step in the reduction of the spire spectra is apodization , which smooths the sinc function recorded by the fts into a gaussian - like profile , and it may result in a larger line width if some minor features are included in the apodization process . therefore",
    ", we give more flexibility on the line width of the fitting of the spire spectra . the signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n )",
    "is calculated by simply dividing the integrated line strength by the product of the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) and the noise level obtained from the residuals after removal of both lines and continuum times a constant , 1.064 , appropriate for a gaussian line .",
    "the line fitting results are summarized in section [ sec : fitting ] . in the following analysis",
    ", we consider a line as a detection if it has s / n greater than 3 .",
    "this criteria represents a false - positive rate of 0.3% , yielding about 10 false detections over the whole pacs / spire spectra . applying a higher s",
    "/ n criteria will lose too many real detections .",
    "if only the lines with s / n greater than 5 are retained , the total number of detections falls from 645 to 376 . therefore , we further visually inspect the fitting results to avoid the false - positive detections .",
    "in addition to the line fluxes , a line - free spectrum was produced by subtracting all the lines and smoothing the result .",
    "this spectrum was compared to photometric data and the agreement was excellent ( @xmath2110% ) for the photometric fluxes at 70  , 100  , 250  , and 500  and was close ( @xmath22 ) for the fluxes at 160  and 350  .",
    "together with data from other telescopes , we use the line - free spectrum to constrain the models of the sed ( figure  [ fig : bhr71_sed ] ) . a flat spectrum",
    "was then obtained by removing the continuum .",
    "the 1-d continuum - removed spectrum of bhr71 shows abundant molecular lines and the variation of the noise across the pacs and spire modules ( figure  [ fig : bhr71_herschel ] ) .",
    "in addition to the _ herschel _ data , we obtained data from 2mass , _",
    "spitzer_-irac , _ spitzer_-irs , and sest .",
    "we describe these other data sets first , then the results of the _ herschel _ observations .",
    "we acquired the 2mass @xmath0 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 bands and _ spitzer_-irac images from the archives .",

    "the derived gas masses within about 7  of the two sources are different by a factor of 50 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "each infrared source has an associated outflow .",
    "however there is not sufficient evidence to establish the relationship between the two infrared sources .",
    "the bolometric luminosities of irs1 and irs2 are 13.5  and 0.5  , respectively @xcite . in this study , the secondary source , irs2 , is not considered in detailed modeling , but it is discussed in section  [ sec : binary ] .",
    "b97 fitted the outflow observations with an edge - on biconical outflow cavity , and the _ spitzer_-irac image is roughly consistent with that picture .",
    "the center of irs1 locates outside of the tip of the scattered light observed in the 2mass image , while it locates within the tip of scattered light seen in the _ spitzer _  image .",
    "although @xcite deduced an inclination angle of 84@xmath31 from the co outflow , the fact that the center of irs1 locates within the tip of scattered light in the _ spitzer _  image hints that the inclination angle might not be so close to an edge - on view , which would make the center locate outside of the tip of the scattered light .",
    "we later conclude from the simulated images that the inclination angle should be close to 50@xmath31 ( see section  [ sec : incl ] ) . the arc shape in irac 3.6",
