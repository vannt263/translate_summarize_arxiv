    "the grand canonical partition function for the ising model ( which corresponds to the vacuum to vacuum transition amplitude in @xmath1 theory ) in the presence of an external magnetic field @xmath2 is @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the inverse of the boltzmann constant times the temperature , @xmath5 is a coupling constant representing the strength of the intersite interaction ( set to unity in the following ) and @xmath6 represents the total number of sites on the lattice .",
    "the value , @xmath7 , of the spin at site @xmath8 , is restricted to @xmath9 . in its generic form ,",
    "only nearest neighbour interactions are considered and such a link is represented by @xmath10 .",
    "the sum runs over all @xmath11 possible configurations of the spin field , and the normalization ensures @xmath12 when @xmath13 .",
    "the partition function may be expressed as @xmath14 in which @xmath15 is the dimensionality of the system , @xmath16 is the reduced external magnetic field , and @xmath17 are the configuration energy and magnetization . in @xmath18",
    "the sum is over the @xmath19 nearest neighbours or links of a periodic lattice . the spectral density @xmath20 denotes the relative weight of configurations having given values of @xmath18 and @xmath21 . in the absence of an odd external field",
    "a second order phase transition occurs at a critical value @xmath22 of @xmath23 .",
    "the reduced temperature @xmath24 is a measure of the distance away from criticality .",
    "the partition function @xmath25 can be written as an @xmath26 degree polynomial in the fugacity @xmath27 defined by @xmath28 as @xmath29 in which @xmath30 is an integrated density .    that the partition function ( [ polynomial ] ) is analytic for finite @xmath6 establishes that no phase transition can occur in a finite  size system .",
    "however as @xmath6 is allowed to approach infinity , phase transitions which manifest themselves as points of non  analyticity can and do occur . in 1952",
    "lee and yang @xcite showed that the study of the onset of criticality is equivalent to that of the scaling behaviour of the zeroes of the partition function . for a finite system , or in the thermodynamic limit but in the symmetric phase ( @xmath31 ) , the zeroes in @xmath2 are strictly complex and the free energy is analytic in a non  vanishing neighbourhood of the real axis . as criticality is approached ( @xmath32 , @xmath33 ) the lee  yang zeroes pinch the real @xmath2 axis , precipitating a phase transition .",
    "the lee  yang theorem states that for the ising model these zeroes lie on the unit circle in the complex fugacity plane ( the imaginary axis in the complex external field plane ) .",
    "this theorem holds independent of the size , dimension and structure of the lattice .    in the forty years",
    "since the ideas of lee and yang were presented , there has been continual interest in this approach to the problem of phase transitions .",
    "analytical progress has included alternative and modified proofs of the original circle theorem , extensions of the result to other systems , as well as theorems proving that no zeroes can exist in certain regions ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "it has been shown rigorously that for isotropic nearest neighbour interactions , and for @xmath34 sufficiently positive ( the symmetric phase ) , there exists a region around @xmath35 which is free from zeroes @xcite .",
    "this means there exists a gap @xmath36 where the density of zeroes is zero .",
    "the free energy is analytic in @xmath2 in the gap and no phase transition can occur ( as a function of @xmath2 ) .",
    "the point @xmath37 , which is a branch point of the partition function , is called the yang  lee edge @xcite .",
    "one expects that this property ( the existence of a gap ) holds in fact for all @xmath38",
    ".    early numerical work on lee  yang zeroes involved the exact calculation of the density of states @xmath39 and was therefore restricted to very small lattice volumes @xcite . in the 1980 s ,",
    "monte carlo histogram approximations to the density of states @xcite , the invention of cluster algorithms @xcite and multi - histogram methods @xcite all provided boosts to the numerical approach . nonetheless , numerical studies are necessarily limited to finite volume .    it is , however , the infinite volume limit which is of primary interest .",
    "an important analytical breakthrough which related such numerical analyses in finite volume to the thermodynamic limit came when itzykson , pearson and zuber @xcite connected the concept of partition function zeroes to the renormalization group and thereby formulated a finite  size scaling theory for these zeroes . their work applies to dimensions of three or less .",
    "this was later extended to dimensions of five or more in @xcite .",
    "the upper critical dimension of the ising or @xmath1 universality class is @xmath40 . above this the scaling behaviour of the thermodynamic functions",
    "simplifies and the critical exponents are exactly those of the mean field theory . below four dimensions the scaling behaviour is of a power  law type . at @xmath41 the mean field power ",
    "law scaling behaviour is modified by multiplicative logarithmic corrections  a circumstance intimately related to the expected triviality of the theory @xcite .",
    "logarithmic corrections to the finite  size scaling of partition function zeroes in four dimensions have recently been identified from a perturbative renormalization group analysis backed up by a high precision numerical study @xcite .",

    "we would like to add to this body of knowledge by presenting some results on lee  yang zeroes in the symmetric phase ( @xmath31 ) of the four dimensional ising model .",
    "to this end we find an asymptotic form for the density of zeroes in the thermodynamic limit which is sufficient to recover the scaling forms for the specific heat and susceptibility .",
    "the finite  size behaviour of the location and density of the lee  yang zeroes is studied both analytically and numerically .",
    "according to the lee  yang theorem @xcite the zeroes of the partition function all lie on the unit circle in the complex fugacity plane . denoting the ( @xmath34dependent ) position of these zeroes by @xmath43 the partition function",

    "the free energy is @xmath55 the thermodynamic limit is @xmath56 the coefficients @xmath57 of the polynomial ( [ polynomial ] ) are real and hence @xmath58 .",

    "the upper integral limit can be replaced by infinity near criticality .",

    "i.e. , the density of zeroes diverges as the edge is approached .",
    "the ising model in the presence of an external field has not been solved in more than one dimension .",
    "nonetheless the value of @xmath98 in two dimensions has been found to be @xmath101 by dhar @xcite by mapping the two dimensional ising ferromagnet into a solvable model of three dimensional directed animals .",

    "we now compare these fss results with data obtained for the 4d ising model in a high statistics monte carlo calculation .",
    "the simulation was done with the swendsen ",
    "wang cluster updating algorithm @xcite applied to lattices of sizes @xmath138 for lattice sizes with linear extension @xmath139 ( details of the numerics can be found in @xcite ) .",
    "histogram approximations to the spectral density @xmath20 of ( [ gndcanising1 ] ) were determined at zero external field and at various values of @xmath23 close to the pseudocritical value ( the value of @xmath23 at which the zero field specific heat peaks ) . for the histogram in the magnetization",
    "each of the raw histograms in @xmath18 and @xmath21 were firstly binned in a @xmath140 array . for each @xmath21bin",
    "the corresponding @xmath18subhistograms were then combined to multi - histograms according to @xcite . in this way , an optimal histogram in @xmath21 for arbitrary @xmath23 was obtained . from this the partition function may be determined for not too large values of ( complex ) @xmath2 .",
    "the critical value of @xmath23 in four dimensions has been determined to @xmath141 @xcite .",
    "our data yield only three reliable lee  yang zeroes for each lattice size .",
    "the reason for this is demonstrated in fig.1 where the contours along which @xmath142 and @xmath143 ( for @xmath144 and @xmath145 ) are plotted . because of the magnification of statistical errors far away from the simulation point @xmath35 these contours fail to cross the imaginary @xmath146 axis when @xmath147 is large .",
    "thus the zeroes move off the @xmath147 axis and their positions are unreliable .",
    "the remaining lattices give qualitatively similar pictures .",
    "table 1 lists the positions of the first lee  yang zeroes ( the lee ",
    "yang edge ) as obtained from the multihistograms for various @xmath23 values near @xmath22 and for all five lattices analyzed .",
    "as @xmath23 increases one expects the zeroes to approach the real axis in the thermodynamic limit according to ( [ myabe3.9 ] ) .",

    "the errors in the quantities calculated from the multihistograms were estimated by the jackknife method .",
    "the data for each lattice size were cut to produce @xmath149 subsamples leading to @xmath149 different multihistograms .",
    "these @xmath149 different multihistograms give @xmath149 different results for the quantities in question , whence the variance and bias were calculated .",
    "the density of zeroes should behave according to ( [ smllg ] ) or ( equivalently ) ( [ recover ] ) .",
    "the log  log plot of fig.3 gives a slope of @xmath150 .",
    "the deviation from the exponent @xmath151 in ( [ recover ] ) is presumably due to the presence of logarithmic corrections .",
    "this may be seen in fig.4 where we remove the expected leading behaviour : a negative slope is clearly identified .",
    "in fact a best fit to all ten points gives a slope @xmath152 .",
    "the shaded area is bordered by lines of this slope .",
    "we find that both leading power ",
    "law scaling behaviour and multiplicative logarithmic corrections for the density of zeroes ( or equivalently for the distance between zeroes ) are identified in figs . 3 and 4 .",
    "this is complementary to our previous analysis in which the scaling behaviour of the actual positions of these zeroes was analyzed @xcite .",
    "both approaches yield quantitative agreement with the ( perturbative ) theoretical predictions .",
    "the scaling behaviour of the lee  yang zeroes and in particular of the yang ",
    "lee edge in four dimensions and in the thermodynamic limit has been examined .",
    "the asymptotic form for the density of zeroes in the infinite volume limit is sufficient to recover the scaling formulae for the specific heat , the magnetization and the magnetic susceptibility .",
    "this extends the work of abe and suzuki to the case of four dimensions where mean field power  law scaling behaviour is modified by multiplicative logarithmic corrections which are linked to the triviality of the theory .",
    "an analytical fss study of the edge and the density of zeroes is in good quantitative agreement with a numerical analysis in the form of monte carlo simulations on finite size lattices .",
