    "digital signatures aim to certify the provenance and identity of a message as well as the authenticity of a signature .",
    "they are widely applied in e - mails , financial transactions , electronic contracts , software distribution and so on . however , relying on mathematical complexities , classical digital signature schemes become vulnerable to quantum computing attacks . though there are some classical unconditionally secure signature schemes @xcite , a resource - expensive assumption exists therein , namely , the secure classical channels between the participants . quantum digital signature ( qds ) bases on fundamental laws of quantum physics to guarantee its information - theoretic security . since gottesman and chuang proposed the first qds protocol @xcite , a quantum version of lamport s scheme @xcite",
    ", the following problems appear therein : ( @xmath0 ) requiring the authenticated quantum channels , ( @xmath1 ) the preparation and transmission of complex one - way function quantum states , ( @xmath2 ) requiring long - term quantum memory , and ( @xmath3 ) other challenging operations , such as performing swap test on the states .",
    "a novel approach uses linear optics and photon detectors to circumvent the requirement for quantum memory and complex state preparation @xcite and replaces the swap test with an optical multiport @xcite , yet leading to another challenging technology  long - distance stabilization of the mach - zehnder interferometer @xcite .",
    "up to date , an obviously serious problem left for a feasible qds protocol is the impractical assumption of the authenticated quantum channels between participants being available .",
    "the authenticated quantum channels are equivalent to the secure quantum channels that do not allow any eavesdropping .",
    "recall that while quantum key distribution ( qkd ) @xcite requires authenticated classical channels , it does not require authenticated ( secure ) quantum channels because of potential eavesdropping .",
    "actually , guaranteeing secure key distribution without authenticated quantum channels is exactly the goal and definition of qkd .",
    "therefore , the assumption of authenticated quantum channels has to be eliminated in a qds to be of practical value . in this paper , using single - photon qubit state and phase - randomized weak coherent states , we propose the first qds protocol that eliminates the impractical assumption of secure quantum channels .",
    "therefore , in respect to tackling the security problem merely requiring the authentication of classical communication , the basic assumptions underlying our qds protocol are similar to that of qkd @xcite and multiparty quantum communication ( quantum secret sharing ) @xcite .",
    "we say a digital signature protocol is secure if it satisfies @xcite : unforgeability , non - repudiation and transferability .",
    "unforgeability means that a given piece of message indeed comes from the signer and remains intact during transmission , namely , no one can forge a valid signature that can be accepted by other honest recipients .",
    "non - repudiation means that once the signer signs a message , he / she can not deny having signed it .",
    "transferability means that when an honest recipient of the signed message accepts a signature , other honest recipients will accept it as well .",
    "we define a qds scheme to have @xmath4-unforgeability , representing that the probability for an adversary to create a valid signature is not greater than @xmath4 .",
    "similarly , we say a protocol is with @xmath5-non - repudiation when the probability for the signer to repudiate a legitimate signature is not greater than @xmath5 .",
    "thereby , a qds protocol is defined to have @xmath6-security when it satisfies both @xmath4-unforgeability and @xmath5-non - repudiation , with @xmath7 .",
    "considering robustness , @xmath8 is the probability that the protocol will be aborted even with the absence of an adversary .    in this paper",
    ", we consider a simple and most important case with three participants , i.e. , one signer and two recipients .",
    "then the property of transferability becomes equivalent to non - repudiation @xcite .",
    "the qds protocols using two copies of single - photon states and decoy - state method are proposed in sec .",
    "ii and sec .",
    "iv , with the security analyzed in sec . iii .",
    "there are three stages when implementing our three - participant qds protocol , namely , the distribution stage , the estimation stage and the messaging stage .",
    "we introduce a two - photon six - state qds protocol to illustrate our basic idea .",
    "there are six single - photon quantum states , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the six states can be arranged into twelve sets @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , where the first state of each set represents logic 0 and the second logic 1 .    _ the distribution stage _ : for each possible future message @xmath26 and @xmath27 , alice prepares two copies of a sequence of @xmath28 single - photon quantum states . for each quantum state ,",
    "alice randomly chooses one of the twelve sets and generates one of two non - orthogonal states in the set .",
    "afterwards , she sends one copy to bob and the other to charlie through insecure ( unauthenticated ) quantum channels . for each quantum state ,",
    "bob and charlie randomly and independently perform a polarization measurement with one of the three bases @xmath29 , and store the corresponding classical bit .",
    "bob and charlie will announce the result if their detectors have no click , and then alice , bob and charlie will discard all the corresponding data and keep the left @xmath30 bits . for each quantum state",
    ", alice announces from which set she selects the state through the authenticated classical channels .",
    "bob ( charlie ) compares his measurement outcomes with the two states .",
    "if his measurement outcome is orthogonal to one of the states , he concludes that the other state has been sent , which represents a conclusive result .",
    "otherwise , he concludes that it is an inconclusive outcome .",
    "let @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) be the probability that bob ( charlie ) has a conclusive result for each received quantum state ; in the ideal case , @xmath33 .",
    "note that bob and charlie do not announce whether they have a conclusive outcome .    _ the estimation stage _ : the signer alice chooses the desired recipient , for example bob , who will be the authenticator in the messaging stage",
    ". then alice informs the other recipient , charlie , to randomly choose @xmath34 bits as the test bits used to estimate correlation ( if charlie is the authenticator chosen by alice , alice will inform bob to randomly choose test bits as well ) .",
    "charlie announce the location of test bits and alice publicly announces the bit information of those test bits .",
    "bob ( charlie ) calculates the mismatching rate @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) of conclusive results from the test bits .",
    "when @xmath35 or @xmath36 gets too high , they announce to abort the protocol .",
    "besides , when @xmath31 or @xmath32 shows a big deviation from the ideal value @xmath37 , they also announce to abort the protocol .",
    "otherwise , bob and charlie announce the mismatching rate and the probability , @xmath38 and @xmath39 , respectively .",
    "alice , bob and charlie only keep @xmath40 untested bits , denoted by @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 .    _ the messaging stage _ : to sign one - bit message @xmath44 , alice sends the message @xmath44 and the corresponding bit string @xmath41 to the authenticator , bob .",
    "bob checks the mismatching rate @xmath45 between @xmath41 and @xmath42 , where @xmath46 is the mismatching rate of the conclusive results .",
    "the inconclusive outcomes are considered to match alice s announcement bits automatically .",
    "if the mismatching rate @xmath47 ( @xmath48 is the authentication security threshold ) , bob accepts the message .",
    "otherwise , he rejects it and announces to abort the protocol .",
    "after bob accepts the message , he forwards it and the corresponding bit string @xmath41 to the verifier charlie .",
    "charlie checks the mismatching rate @xmath49 between @xmath41 and @xmath43 , where @xmath50 is the mismatching rate of the conclusive results .",
    "if the mismatching rate @xmath51 ( @xmath52 is the verification security threshold ) , charlie accepts the forwarded message , otherwise he rejects it .",
    "note that the distribution stage is a quantum process , while the estimation and messaging stage are classical communication processes .",
    "the time interval between the distribution stage and estimation stage is arbitrary .",
    "the estimation stage is employed to estimate the parameters @xmath48 and @xmath52 , which are used for the messaging stage .",
    "after the distribution stage , once alice wants to sign the message , she will start the estimation stage and the messaging stage .",
    "as alice is the signer , she can identify the one who is the desired recipient ( namely the authenticator ) before the estimation stage .",
    "therefore , the roles of bob and charlie are equivalent , either of them can be the receiver of the message and forwards it to the other .",
    "in the three - participant qds protocol , at most one participant can be an adversary , because the majority vote is usually used to resolve the dispute @xcite .",
    "then , the only potential attack strategy can be either the repudiation of the signer or the forgery of the authenticator .",
    "we are now interested in why our scheme can prevent adversary s attack without authenticated quantum channels . for alice s repudiation attack , authenticated quantum channels can not help her because the quantum states are prepared by herself . during the estimation stage , exploiting the random sampling theorem , one can estimate the correlation strength between bob s and charlie s received quantum states . therefore ,",
    "the swap test and symmetry operation of bob s and charlie s quantum states or classical bits can be removed in our protocol , which are realized by authenticated quantum channels @xcite or secure classical channels @xcite in other protocols . for bob s forgery attack , exploiting the random sampling theorem",
    ", charlie can estimate the correlation strength between the quantum states alice sends and those charlie receives without authenticated quantum channels , whereas in previous protocols , authenticated quantum channels are required to guarantee that one copy of the quantum state charlie receives has not been tampered with .",
    "detailed security analysis are shown in appendix a.    when bob forges , alice and charlie are automatically regarded as honest .",
    "a successful forgery means that the dishonest bob forges ( tampers ) the message bit and charlie accepts it .",
    "bob is unable to discriminate two copies of six - state ( or four - state ) without any error , since an unambiguous discrimination among @xmath53 linearly dependent qubit states is only possible when at least @xmath54 copies of the states are available @xcite .",
    "for this reason , we can restrict bob s forgery attack even when quantum channels are insecure .",
    "we consider the case that bob is restricted to collective forgery attack where his optimal strategy is to acquire the information of each quantum state charlie receives as much as possible ( exploiting quantum de finetti theorem @xcite , we expect that our scheme could guarantee the security against coherent forgery attack , which should be studied in the future ) .",
    "thus , bob s attack strategy in the two - photon six - state qds protocol can be reduced to the eavesdropping attack of eve in the six - state sarg04-qkd protocol @xcite given that the two - photon source is used . with the entanglement distillation techniques @xcite",
    ", we can obtain the upper bound of bob s information @xmath55 about charlie s conclusive - result bits as ( see appendix b ) @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the conditional shannon entropy function ; @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the phase and bit error rates , respectively .",
    "if a bit is flipped , the probability of a phase shift will be @xmath60 . in the qds protocol",
    ", @xmath59 is the expectation value of mismatching rate between alice s bits and charlie s conclusive results in the untested portion .",
    "therefore @xmath61 , @xmath62 is the finite sample size effect which can be quantified by the random sampling without replacement @xcite with the failure probability @xmath63 . in order to optimally implement the forgery attack , bob will attempt to make the mismatching rate between his guessed bits and charlie s conclusive - result bits reach the minimum value @xmath64 . employing the properties of min - entropy and max - entropy @xcite ,",
    "@xmath64 can be given by @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the binary shannon entropy function .",
    "there is no chance for bob to make a successful forgery in the ideal case when charlie s verification threshold satisfies @xmath67 .",
    "however , considering the sampling with finite number of independent bernoulli random values , the observed average value can be less than the expectation value with a probability quantified by the chernoff bound @xcite .",
    "thus , the probability that charlie accepts ( ca ) the message forged by bob is negligible as @xmath68 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath69 is the number of charlie s untested conclusive - result bits .",
    "when alice repudiates , bob and charlie are automatically regarded as honest .",
    "a successful repudiation happens when alice disavows the signature , with the message accepted by bob and rejected by charlie .",
    "alice must treat each quantum state received by both bob and charlie in the same way since the conclusive results of quantum states they acquire are random , which is similar to ref .",
    "conclusive results of partial quantum states can be acquired by bob and charlie simultaneously , which can be used in the estimation stage to estimate the correlation strength between the quantum states they receive .",
