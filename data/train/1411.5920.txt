    "the properties of liquids near solid surfaces are of interest for a wide range of technological and biological issues . wetting or non - wetting properties of solids , notably of structured surfaces , play an important role in applications  such as coating , design of self - cleaning materials and of micro - fluidic devices , as well as tribology @xcite  and also in biology @xcite . in order to modify the wetting properties of solid surfaces ,",
    "various methods can be used in order to tailor their geometrical and chemical topography down to the nanoscale @xcite .",
    "it turns out that even changing this topography only on the _ nanoscale _ leads to strong _ macroscopic _ effects such as a significant variation of the contact angle of sessile drops .",
    "accordingly , in order to understand this peculiar amplification mechanism one has to reveal the structure of liquids near patterned walls .",
    "the geometric surface topographies studied most frequently in experiments are arrays of pillars or lamellae and arrays of pits or grooves carved into a flat and chemically homogeneous surface . between pillars and within pits or grooves the fluid is strongly confined by solid walls .",
    "it is well known that the confinement of fluids as in slits or in cylindrical pores gives rise to effects like capillary condensation or capillary evaporation which can be understood based on thermodynamics , involving surface and interfacial tensions and bulk pressure . in nano - pores",
    "the presence of wetting films may lead to strong deviations from macroscopic predictions . in order to incorporate these effects into a theoretical description one",
    "has to resort to at least a mesoscopic treatment , e.g. , based on an effective interface hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in nanopores packing effects may become noticeable throughout the system , leading to pronounced layering . in order to include these latter effects into a theoretical description one",
    "has to use actual microscopic theories like molecular dynamics , monte - carlo simulations , or classical density functional theories ( dft ) with sufficiently sophisticated functionals .",
    "a review of fluids in nanopores is provided in ref .",
    "@xcite ; for theoretical studies of capillary evaporation , capillary condensation , and wedge filling based on classical dft with a focus on universal behavior see refs .",
    "@xcite . concerning investigations using monte carlo simulations see refs . @xcite and the review in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "here we do not discuss fluids in complete confinement like provided by macroscopically extended slits or cylindrical capillaries as studied in the aforementioned literature . instead , by using classical dft",
    "we investigate one of the typical surface topographies used to manipulate wetting properties .",
    "we study a wall endowed with an array of pits which is in contact with a fluid of prescribed bulk number density .",
    "the fluid is homogeneous sufficiently far away from the wall and thermodynamically deep in the liquid part of the phase diagram , _",
    "i.e. _ , far away from both liquid - vapor and liquid - solid coexistence .",
    "we focus our investigations on narrow and shallow pits with depths and widths in the nano - meter range .",
    "we expect strong confinement effects which , however , are expected to differ from those in narrow but long capillaries .",
    "our emphasis is on the structure of simple liquids in that given environment .",
    "we do not study the cassie - baxter to wenzel transition or capillary filling problems which have been addressed experimentally for wider pits and described in terms of macroscopic thermodynamics @xcite or by using mesoscopic approaches @xcite .",
    "there is also a dft study devoted to wetting and filling transitions at substrates endowed with macroscopically long rectangular grooves @xcite .",
    "the fluids studied there are taken to be close to bulk liquid - vapor coexistence ; accordingly the liquid structure per se is not analyzed .",
    "furthermore molecular dynamics studies have been performed concerning wetting of surfaces textured with nano - sized pillars @xcite .",
    "also in this case the emphasis is on mesoscale structures , without discussing the liquid structure on the microscale .",
    "here we fill this gap by studying specifically the structures of confined liquids on the microscale .",
    "we aim at understanding whether on that scale strongly inhomogeneous liquid density distributions emerge and if so what their characteristics are .",
    "we analyze the dependence of these liquid structures on the pit dimensions and on the bulk packing fraction .",
    "it is particularly interesting to follow the changes of the liquid structure upon choosing the pit dimensions to be commensurate or incommensurate with the length characterizing packing effects of the local density distribution .",
    "we are also interested in the liquid structures above the pit , with a view on how deep into the bulklike liquid traces of the specific structures forming within the pits are still detectable on the outside .",
    "our studies are somewhat related to capillary freezing ; for corresponding experimental and theoretical studies see refs . @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "however , within the parameter range of the systems we are studying no genuine capillary freezing is expected to occur , because in accordance with the aforementioned studies in extended capillaries the freezing temperature is expected to be reduced compared with bulk freezing .",
    "an increase of the freezing temperature is expected to occur only for strongly attractive walls @xcite which is not the case here ( see sec .",
    "many details of capillary freezing also depend in addition on the capillary geometry ( e.g. cylindrical versus slit pores @xcite ) .    in sec .",
    "ii we provide a detailed description of the system studied here , which is characterized by the texture of the surface as well as by the fluid - fluid and fluid - surface interactions . in sec .",
    "iii we describe the theoretical technique we have used for the present investigation . in sec .",

    "we have studied the structure of a fluid , which on one side is in its bulk liquid state and on the other side in contact with a nano - structured wall .",

    "this rescaling of the fluid - fluid interaction strength renders the liquid - vapor phase boundaries independent of @xmath20 within the dft version used here , because for that version the bulk properties of the fluid depend only on the integrated interaction .",
    "the repulsive part of the liquid - wall interaction is modeled by a hard core repulsion , so that the fluid particles can not overlap with the wall , which is treated in this respect as a continuum with piecewise planar interfaces .",

    "the onset of this localization occurs already at packing fractions much lower than those of the liquid at bulk liquid - solid coexistence . for suitably chosen widths and depths of the pits such that they are commensurate with packing requirements ,",
    "the high density spots are spatially compact and form simple cubic lattices or they are at least ordered on square lattices in certain planes .",
    "the number of spots depends on the width and the depth of the pit .",
    "too strong deviations from the commensurate widths lead to a broadening of the density distribution and to the formation of bridges between high density spots .",
    "we have followed the evolution of these structures as the width of the pit is varied from one commensurate value to the next one . above the pits mainly layering is observed in the vertical direction .",
    "the layers are distorted above the pit opening , but these distortions die out within a few molecular diameters .    the degree of localization inside the pit becomes more pronounced as the packing fraction increases .",
    "qualitatively , however , the structures remain to be similar . for packing fractions , which correspond to the liquid phase in the bulk , within the pits",
    "no region with genuine crystalline order has been observed for the fluid - wall interactions , pit geometries , and sizes studied here .",
    "our results also hold for colloidal suspensions with pits comparable in size with that of the colloids . in that case the pit dimensions and the length scale characterizing the structures discussed in the present work are not in the @xmath200 range but may be scaled - up to much larger length scales .",
    "of course the effective interactions among the colloidal particles and between the colloidal particles and the wall have to be tuned such that agglomeration or complete sedimentation are prevented .",
    "in particular for molecular liquids , these structures at the sculptured surface - liquid interface are in situ experimentally accessible by small - angle x - ray scattering @xcite .",
