    "the statistical properties of linear polymers near an impenetrable short  range attractive boundary have been extensively studied for a long time .",
    "the most frequently applied model for a polymer chain has been the self  avoiding walk ( saw ) model ( that is , the walk without self  intersections ) , so that steps of the walk have been identified with monomers that comprise the polymer , while the solvent surrounding has been represented by a lattice .",
    "here we assume that polymer is immersed in a good solvent , and interacts only with an adsorbing surface bounding the polymer container , so that for strong enough monomer - surface interaction the polymer undergoes phase transition from desorbed to adsorbed phase .",
    "since the polymer adsorption is a surface critical phenomenon , it has been possible to describe various polymer quantities in terms of power laws described by concomitant critical exponents .",
    "early investigations of polymer behavior near attractive surfaces dealt with polymer chains immersed in homogeneous spaces with planar adsorbing boundaries ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "these studies have been subsequently extended to polymers immersed in porous ( inhomogeneous ) media , modeled by fractal lattices embedded in two - dimensional @xcite and three - dimensional @xcite space . in these studies , almost exclusively , only two critical exponents have been studied , that is , the end  to ",
    "end distance critical exponent @xmath5 and the crossover exponent @xmath6 ( that governs the number of contacts between the polymer and the surface ) .",
    "however , a complete picture about the adsorption problem requires knowledge of surface critical exponents that describe numbers of polymer configurations grouped according to the different ways of anchoring to the adsorbing boundary . in terms of the self  avoiding random walk ( saw ) model of linear polymers , these exponents are defined by the following formulas for numbers of possible different configurations averaged over the number of sites on the impenetrable surface @xmath7 valid for large number @xmath8 of saw steps .",
    "here @xmath9 , and @xmath10 , are numbers of all possible saws with both , one , and no ends grafted on the boundary respectively , @xmath11 is temperature dependent connectivity constant and @xmath12 , and @xmath3 , are concomitant surface critical exponents that take different values in various polymer phases .",
    "so far , surface critical exponents have been studied mostly for saws near the boundary surfaces of two and tree - dimensional euclidean spaces .",
    "these studies were performed using various techniques including series enumeration @xcite , conformal invariance theory @xcite , coulomb gas method @xcite , field theoretical approach @xcite , and monte carlo simulations @xcite .",
