    "with the increase in miniaturization nanoscale technology is developing rapidly .",
    "however , at such small scales the physics of thermodynamic properties and transport processes will deviate from that at larger scales .",
    "certainly one sees finite size effects and appreciable fluctuations on measurable quantities .",
    "it is likely that new physics exists at the nanoscale .",
    "of course , on large time and length scales transport processes in fluids are well described by hydrodynamics which contain the transport coefficients such as the diffusion constants , viscosity and thermal conductivity @xcite .",
    "kinetic theory can provide low density approximations to these coefficients @xcite while linear response theory yields the green - kubo relations which express the transport coefficients in terms of integrals of time - correlation functions of the appropriate current fluctuations in equilibrium @xcite .",
    "thus once one has determined the transport coefficients by studying the equilibrium time - correlation functions , one can attack a wide range of non - equilibrium transport problems described by hydrodynamics not too far from equilibrium .",
    "in contrast , the description of the non - equilibrium behaviour at shorter times and smaller length scales remains mostly unsolved despite its importance , in principle , to the understanding of nanostructures .",
    "even low density kinetic theories can not describe time scales below the average duration of a collision .",
    "attempts to generalize hydrodynamics stranded at first because a straightforward further expansion in the gradients , i.e.  beyond the linear laws , leads to higher order burnett coefficients which are infinite @xcite .",
    "recently a theory was proposed by prof .",
    "kincaid using green s functions to describe processes at small length and time scales which avoids these divergences @xcite . like hydrodynamics",
    "the green s function approach can also treat the hydrodynamic fields ( density , momentum and energy ) but unlike in hydrodynamics currents need not be linear in the gradients .",
    "another contrast with hydrodynamics is that the green s function approach is not restricted to long times .",
    "thus the green s function approach should be able to attack a wider range of problems than standard hydrodynamics .",
    "indeed the green s function approach has been numerically applied with success to self - diffusion @xcite and heat transport @xcite on nanometreand picosecond scales . in these applications",
    ", the green s functions are resummed into an infinite series that needs to be truncated .",
    "it was shown using computer simulations that if just a few terms from the infinite sum are taken into account , accurate results were obtained for all time scales for those systems @xcite .",
    "also , for long times the numerical results were seen to approach the numerical hydrodynamic results @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we formulate the green s function approach for mixtures , focusing on _ mutual diffusion _ in isotopic and ideal binary mixtures .",
    "apart from adapting the green s function approach for mass transport in mixtures , this paper is mainly dedicated to the question whether the truncated expressions for the green s functions describe the right very short time behaviour and whether they do indeed reduce to hydrodynamics at long time scales and for small gradients ; if the latter is true then the green s function approach can rightfully be called an extension of hydrodynamics . for self - diffusion in a single component fluid the truncation was already shown analytically to give the right hydrodynamic - like behaviour for long times @xcite . mutual diffusion in an isotopic or ideal mixture is the simplest case to consider next ( simplest both in thermodynamic and in hydrodynamic aspects ) ideally one would like to show analytically that the green s functions reproduce not just mutual diffusion but the full hydrodynamic equations in all cases where gradients are small and times are long , but this would be an enormous undertaking",
    ". therefore , as a first step , we restrict ourselves in this paper to the already nontrivial case of diffusion in isotopic and ideal mixtures .",
    "we consider a classical mixture of two components where the particles interact through short - range pair potentials .",
    "the total system consists of @xmath0 particles of which @xmath1 particles are of component @xmath2 and @xmath3 particles are of component @xmath4 .",
    "the system is enclosed in a volume @xmath5 .",
    "we denote the ( three - dimensional ) position of particle @xmath6 of component @xmath7 as @xmath8 and its velocity as @xmath9 , where the index @xmath7 equals 1 or 2 , and @xmath6 is an index which runs from 1 to @xmath10 .",
    "the mass of particles of component @xmath7 will be denoted as @xmath11 .",
    "we restrict ourselves to two related classes of mixtures : isotopic mixtures , for which the pair potentials are the same independent of the components to which the interacting particles belong , and ideal mixtures , whose pair potentials can be neglected as far as thermodynamic properties are concerned .",
    "the system is prepared in a non - equilibrium state described by some given , non - equilibrium initial ensemble in phase space @xmath12 , where @xmath13 @xmath14 @xmath15 . in the initial non - equilibrium ensemble",
    " and consequently also at later times  the particles of each component are indistinguishable .",
    "after the initial preparation in the non - equilibrium state , the system stays isolated , i.e.  the system does not interact with the outside .",
    "the macroscopic ( i.e.  averaged ) local density of component @xmath7 is defined as @xcite @xmath16 where the subscript `` @xmath17 '' on the average indicates its non - equilibrium nature . in this equation",
    "we used the indistinguishability of the particles of the same component to express the densities @xmath18 in terms of the properties of a representative particle of each component i.e.  in terms of @xmath19 .    due to the non - equilibrium nature of @xmath20 , the local densities @xmath18 will in general not be uniform at @xmath21 . in this paper",
    "we are mainly interested in the time evolution of these densities .",
    "this is in principle determined by the microscopic time evolution governed by the hamiltonian @xmath22 where @xmath23 here @xmath24 are the pair potentials and the summation @xmath25 is restricted to exclude self - interaction of the particles , i .. e .  to exclude the cases where both @xmath26 and @xmath27 . for isotopic mixtures , @xmath28 .",
    "the equations of motion are thus given by @xmath29    before proceeding we introduce a few more quantities for later convenience .",
    "the local mass densities are given by @xmath30 . here and below",
    "when the spatial and temporal arguments of a local quantity are not denoted , it is implied that they are taken at position @xmath31 and time @xmath32 .",
    "the local total number and mass densities are , respectively , @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "we furthermore define the local mole fractions as @xmath35 and the mass fraction of component @xmath2 as @xmath36 .",
    "the mass fraction of component @xmath4 is simply @xmath37 .",
    "the local mass currents of the two components in the laboratory frame are given by ( @xmath38 @xmath4 ) @xmath39 using these definitions the local mass velocity of the fluid can be written as @xmath40 finally , we define the diffusive currents of the two components in the local frame ( i.e.  co - moving with the local velocity @xmath41 ) as @xmath42 \\,\\delta\\mathbf ( \\bi r-\\bi r_{\\lambda1}(t )   \\mathbf)\\rangle}_{\\mathrm{ne}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] so that by definition we have @xmath43      for classical isotopic mixtures and ideal mixtures , many thermodynamic equilibrium properties take on a particularly simple form  which is in fact the main reason we consider these systems here . in particular , for the current case of mass transport investigated in this paper , we will need @xmath44 and @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the temperature , @xmath47 is the pressure and @xmath48 and @xmath49 is the chemical potential of component @xmath7 .",
    "these thermodynamic properties can be found from the form of chemical potential for isotopic systems @xcite : @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the chemical potential of the pure isotope @xmath7 at the same temperature @xmath46 and pressure @xmath47 as those for which @xmath49 is evaluated .",

    "using also equation  ( [ mudef ] ) , we get for equations  ( [ firstrelation ] ) and ( [ secondrelation ] ) in terms of @xmath57 and @xmath61 @xmath62 from the fundamental relation for the gibbs free energy @xmath63 @xcite , one can deduce that @xmath64 , whence @xmath65    the quantities in equations  ( [ bmuciso ] ) and ( [ rhociso ] ) will be needed in the treatment of the long time behaviour of the green s functions for mass transport in section  [ long - time - behavior ] .",
    "these are precisely of the form valid for ideal ( `` perfect '' ) mixtures @xcite , which is the reason why our treatment is valid both for ideal mixtures and for isotopic binary mixtures .",
    "because in section  [ long - time - behavior ] the results of the green s function approach for long times will be compared to those of hydrodynamics , we will now review the appropriate hydrodynamic equations and green - kubo formula for mass transport in ideal mixtures and in an isotopic binary mixture .",

    "this definition is also more analogous to the self - diffusion case @xcite because of the appearance of @xmath120 inside the integrals in equation  ( [ 2.1 ] ) instead of a single factor of the average density @xmath121 in front of the integral .",
    "next the green s functions @xmath108 are fourier transformed with respect to @xmath122 , i.e.  one considers @xmath123 using equation  ( [ 2.2 ] ) and expanding in @xmath124 , this gives @xmath125                  \\rangle}_{\\lambda\\bi r ' } \\:=\\ : \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty }   \\frac{(\\mathrm i k)^n}{n ! } \\mu_{\\lambda n}(\\hat{\\bi k } , \\bi r ' , t ) \\label{2.6}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath126 , @xmath127 and the moments are defined as @xmath128^n\\big\\rangle}_{\\lambda\\bi r'}. \\label{momdef}\\ ] ] since divergences would occur if one would directly take the inverse fourier transform term by term in equation  ( [ 2.6 ] ) , an alternative expansion will be used . for given direction @xmath129",

    "note that the cross terms found in equations  ( [ finally ] ) arose from the local equilibrium assumption applied to the drift terms @xmath297 , whereas the self - terms come from the rather simple approximation to the variance @xmath298 .",
    "we can therefore conclude that although the green s functions seem to treat the system as self - diffusion , the sensitivity of the drift terms to local equilibrium restores the true mutual and hydrodynamic character of the binary diffusion .",
