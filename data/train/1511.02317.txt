    "these paradoxes , which are now known as zeno s paradoxes , were unsolved for long , and they fascinated mathematicians , logicians , physicists and other creative minds since their introduction . in the recent past , a quantum analogue of zeno s paradoxes has been studied intensively .",
    "specifically , in the late 50s and early 60s of the 20th century , khalfin studied nonexponential decay of unstable atoms @xcite . later on , in 1977 , misra and sudarshan @xcite showed that under continuous measurement , an unstable particle will never be found to decay , and in analogy with classical zeno s paradox they named this phenomenon as _",
    "zeno s quantum paradox_. quantum zeno effect ( qze ) in the original formulation refers to the inhibition of the temporal evolution of a system on continuous measurement @xcite , while quantum anti - zeno effect ( qaze ) or inverse zeno effect refers the enhancement of the evolution instead of the inhibition ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for the reviews ) . here",
    ", it is important to note that usually quantum zeno effect is viewed as a process , which is associated with the repeated projective measurement .",
    "this is only a specific manifestation of quantum zeno effect .",
    "in fact , it can be manifested in a few equivalent ways @xcite .",
    "one such manifestation of quantum zeno effect is a process in which continuous interaction between the system and probe leads to quantum zeno effect . here",
    ", we aim to study the continuous interaction type manifestation of quantum zeno effect in a symmetric nonlinear optical coupler , which is made of two nonlinear waveguides with @xmath4 nonlinearity , and each of the waveguides is operating under second harmonic generation . as we are describing an optical coupler ,",
    "the waveguides are coupled with each other .",
    "more precisely , these two waveguides interact with each other through the evanescent waves .",
    "we consider one of the waveguides as the probe and the other one as the system . in",
    "what follows , we will show that the beauty of the symmetric nonlinear optical coupler ( @xmath5 coupler ) studied here is that the results obtained for this coupler can be directly reduced to the corresponding results for an asymmetric nonlinear optical coupler where the probe is linear ( @xmath6 and the system is nonlinear ( @xmath7 we have reported quantum zeno and anti - zeno effects in both the symmetric ( @xmath5 ) nonlinear optical coupler and asymmetric ( @xmath8 nonlinear optical coupler . following an earlier work @xcite",
    ", we refer to the zeno effect observed due to the continuous interaction of a nonlinear @xmath9 probe as the nonlinear zeno effect .",
    "similarly , the zeno effect observed due to the continuous interaction of a linear @xmath10 probe is referred to as the linear zeno effect .",
    "optical couplers can be prepared easily and several exciting applications of the optical couplers have been reported in the recent past ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "consequently , it is no wonder that quantum zeno and anti - zeno effects have been investigated in various types of optical couplers @xcite .",
    "specifically , quantum zeno and anti - zeno effects were shown in raman and brillouin scattering using a ( @xmath11 ) asymmetric nonlinear optical coupler @xcite ; their existence was also shown in the @xmath12 optical couplers @xcite , @xmath5 optical couplers @xcite , etc . in all these studies",
    ", it was always considered that one of the mode in the nonlinear waveguide ( this waveguide is considered as the system ) is coupled with the auxiliary mode in a ( non)linear waveguide ( this waveguide is considered as the probe ) . actually , the auxiliary mode acts as the probe since its coupling with the system implements continuous observation on the evolution of the system ( nonlinear waveguide ) and changes the photon statistics of the other modes ( which are not coupled to the probe mode ) of the nonlinear waveguide .",
    "quantum zeno and anti - zeno effects have also been investigated in optical systems other than couplers , such as in parametric down - conversion @xcite , parametric down conversion with losses @xcite , an arrangement of beam splitters @xcite , etc . in these studies on quantum zeno effect in optical systems ,",
    "often the pump mode has been considered strong , and thus the complexity of a completely quantum mechanical treatment has been circumvented . keeping this in mind , here",

    "specifically , in refs .",
    "@xcite , it was established that the quantum zeno effect may be used to increase the resolution of absorption tomography .",
    "a few of the proposed applications have also been experimentally realized .",
    "for example , kwait et al . implemented high - efficiency quantum interrogation measurement using quantum zeno effect @xcite . until recently",
    ", all the investigations related to the quantum zeno effect were restricted to the microscopic world .",
    "recently , in a very interesting work , it has been extended to the macroscopic world by showing the evidence for the existence of quantum zeno effect for large black holes @xcite .",
    "possibility of observing the macroscopic zeno effect was also studied in the context of stationary flows in nonlinear waveguides with localized dissipation @xcite .",
    "the interest in quantum zeno effect has recently been amplified with the advent of various protocols of quantum communication that are based on quantum zeno effect .",
    "specifically , in ref .",
    "@xcite , a counterfactual protocol of direct quantum communication was proposed using chained quantum zeno effect , and in ref .",
    "@xcite , the same effect is used to propose a scheme for counterfactual quantum computation . in the past , a proposal for quantum computing was made using an environment induced quantum zeno effect to confine the dynamics in a decoherence - free subspace @xcite .",
    "recently , quantum zeno effect has also been used to reduce communication complexity @xcite .",
    "these applications of quantum zeno effect and easy production of optical couplers motivated us to systematically investigate the possibility of observing quantum zeno and anti - zeno effects in a symmetric nonlinear coupler which is not studied earlier using a completely quantum description .    to investigate the existence of quantum zeno and anti - zeno effects in the optical coupler of our interest , we have obtained closed form analytic expressions for the spatial evolution of the different field operators using the sen - mandal perturbative approach @xcite , which is known to produce better results compared to the usual short - length approximation method @xcite",
    "actually , in sharp contrast to the short length approximated solutions , the solutions of heisenberg s equations of motion obtained using the sen - mandal approach are not restricted by length .",
    "this is why we use sen - mandal perturbative approach and a completely quantum mechanical description of the coupler for our investigation . in the past",
    ", photon statistics and dynamics of the symmetric coupler of our interest was studied by some of the present authors with an assumption that both the second harmonic modes are strong @xcite .",
    "the assumption circumvented the use of completely quantum mechanical description .",
    "further , the system has also been used to model a beam splitter with second order nonlinearity @xcite .",
    "present investigation , not only revealed the existence of nonlinear quantum zeno and anti - zeno effects it also established the existence of linear zeno and anti - zeno effects .",
    "the study also showed that switching between quantum zeno and anti - zeno effects is possible by varying phase - mismatches .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec :",
    "system - and - solution ] , we briefly describe the momentum operator for the symmetric nonlinear optical coupler and the method used here to obtain the analytic expressions of the spatial evolution of the field operators of various modes . however , the detailed solution obtained here is shown in the appendix a. in section [ sec : linear - and - nonlinear ] , the existence of quantum zeno and anti - zeno effects are systematically investigated .",
    "finally the paper is concluded in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",

    "the momentum operator described above is completely quantum mechanical in the sense that all the modes involved in the process are considered weak and treated quantum mechanically .",

    "can be obtained as the simultaneous solutions of the heisenberg s equations of motion corresponding to each mode . however , for the complex systems , such as considered here , the closed form analytic solutions are possible only by using some perturbative methods . here , we use sen - mandal perturbative method @xcite , which has already been shown to be superior to the frequently used short - length / time method @xcite .",

    "keeping these facts in mind , here we use sen - mandal method to obtain spatial evolution of all the field operators involved in ( [ eq : ham - symmetric ] ) .",

    "for completely quantum description of the primary physical system ( i.e. , symmetric nonlinear optical coupler ) , appropriate use of a perturbative technique which is known to perform better than short - length method , reducibility of the results obtained for symmetric nonlinear optical coupler to that of asymmetric nonlinear optical coupler , easy experimental realizability of the physical systems , etc . , provide an edge to this work over the existing works on zeno effects in optical coupler , where usually the use of complete quantum description is circumvented by considering one or more modes as strong and/or short length method is used to reduce computational difficulty .",
    "the approach adopted here is also very general and can be easily extended to the study of other optical couplers and other quantum optical systems having the similar structure of momentum operators or hamiltonian as is used here .",
