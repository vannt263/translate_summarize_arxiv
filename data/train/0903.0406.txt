    "modulation - doped @xmath0-type ( cd , mn)te/(cd , mg , zn)te quantum wells ( qws ) remain a unique medium allowing to probe carrier - induced ising - like ferromagnetism in the two - dimensional ( 2d ) case,@xcite as in this system the mean free path is longer than the qw width .",
    "the presence of ferromagnetism was revealed by the observation of spontaneous splitting of the photoluminescence ( pl ) spectrum , which indicated that local spin ordering is stable , below the curie temperature @xmath2 , for times longer than the exciton lifetime.@xcite theoretical analyzes have shown that the magnitude of @xmath2 as a function of the mn concentration @xmath4 and the hole areal density @xmath0 can be quantitatively described provided that in addition to carrier - mediated ferromagnetic spin - spin couplings , the presence of competing short - range antiferromagnetic superexchange interactions as well as hole correlation effects are taken into account.@xcite these experiments and their quantitative interpretations were carried out prior to later theoretical studies.@xcite    a surprising result of both optical and magnetic measurements is the absence of hysteresis loops and , hence , of macroscopic spontaneous magnetization below @xmath2.@xcite this finding questions our understanding of the actual ground state of the system .",
    "it has been suggested , in particular , that the formation of spin density waves , driven by the @xmath5-dependent carrier susceptibility , may account for the absence of spontaneous magnetization.@xcite this possibility has recently been considered in the context of theoretical search for carrier - mediated nuclear magnetism in 2d systems.@xcite    in order to determine the importance of various phenomena that control magnetism in such reduced - dimensionality magnetically disordered systems we have carried out time - resolved magneto - optical measurements .",
    "furthermore , with the goal to obtain information on mechanisms controlling spin dynamics , we have extended our previous@xcite monte carlo ( mc ) simulations of magnetization in @xmath6 qw .",
    "the experimental findings provide a dependence of magnetization relaxation on temperature and carrier density . above @xmath2 the relaxation time is found to be shorter than 20  ns , while below @xmath2 magnetization persists up to a few microseconds , a time scale consistent with the absence of spontaneous magnetization in the static measurements .",
    "interestingly , we have obtained a similar relative prolongation of the relaxation time below @xmath2 from mc simulations based on the metropolis algorithm and on the determination of the one - particle hole eigenfunctions at each mc sweep .",
    "the simulations explain also the rate of increase of the relaxation time with the carrier density .",
    "we conclude that the absence of magnetic hysteresis in this 2d ising system can be explained without taking carrier - carrier correlation into account .    at the same time , by analyzing results of our monte carlo simulations , we are able to show that short range spin - spin antiferromagnetic ( afm ) interactions play a crucial role in accelerating magnetization dynamics .",
    "this corroborates the outcome of the previous results showing a narrowing of the hysteresis loop by afm interactions.@xcite however , we realize now , based on much more extensive simulations , that the effect of afm interactions becomes much reduced if the thickness of the layer containing mn spins is taken to be smaller than the extent of the hole wave function .",
    "this finding , from the one hand , substantiates theoretical considerations of boudinet and bastard,@xcite suggesting that magnetization relaxation of bound magnetic polarons in @xmath0-type cdte/(cd , mn)te qws occurs owing to the afm coupling to the mn spins located outside the relevant bohr radius . on the other",
    ", this result implies that macroscopic spontaneous magnetization and magnetic hysteresis should be recovered in quantum wells , in which the thickness of the mn layer would be smaller than the region visited by the holes .",
    "furthermore , we study how a spin - independent part of the potential introduced by mn impurities affects @xmath2 .",
    "our simulations show that alloy disorder tends to reduce @xmath2 .",
    "the effect is particularly dramatic for the attractive alloy potential which , if sufficiently large , leads to a strong hole localization .",

    "the experimental results have been obtained for samples grown in grenoble by molecular beam epitaxy on @xmath7 ( 001 ) substrates.@xcite the modulation - doped @xmath0-type structures contain a single 8  nm wide @xmath1 qw embedded by @xmath8 barriers , in which the mg content ( @xmath9 = 0.25 - 0.28 ) results in a sizable valence band offset , while the presence of zn ( @xmath10 = 0.070.08 ) ensures a good lattice match to the substrate .",
    "the front barrier is doped by nitrogen acceptors .",
    "the distance between the qw and the doping layer is 20  nm , which results in the hole density up to @xmath11.@xcite these holes occupy the ground state subband whose scattering broadening is much smaller than the distance to the next subband , making the system to be truly 2d .    according to the well established procedure ,",
    "magnetic properties of the qw are probed by magnetospectroscopy.@xcite the photoluminescence ( pl ) is excited by a cw laser with the photon energies below the absorption edge of the barrier material . a typical pl spectrum of a paramagnetic @xmath0-type qw consists of a single line related to the radiative recombination of charged excitons ( @xmath12 ) .",

    ", this zeeman shift is giant ( typically over 20  mev in 1  t ) , and its magnitude is proportional to the local magnetization of the mn spins . importantly , a combination of strain , confinement , and spin - orbit interaction makes that the giant shift vanishes virtually entirely for the in - plane magnetic field . below a critical temperature , which we identify as the curie temperature @xmath2",
    ", a spontaneous splitting of the pl line into two components is observed in the absence of an external magnetic field .",
    "the energy distance between these two lines , or the downward shift of the lower line , provides information on an average value of spontaneous magnetization in the regions visited by the holes at given temperature .",
    "surprisingly , the emitted light at the wavelength corresponding to either of these two lines remains unpolarized , even after ramping the field down to zero below @xmath2 .",
    "a magnetic field of the order of 20  mt , much higher than the demagnetization field for this diluted alloy , is necessary to achieve a full circular polarization of the lines at @xmath15.@xcite this indicates the absence of a macroscopic spontaneous magnetization at these low temperatures , the conclusion confirmed by a direct magnetization measurements.@xcite moreover , even focusing detection on the spot with diameter below 1  @xmath3 m does not result in the circularly polarized emission .",
    "this could be explained either by a small size of the relevant magnetic domains or by fast fluctuations of the magnetization direction .",
    "alternatively , a spin - density wave could be considered as the relevant ground state of this reduced dimensionality correlated system .",
    "however , a selective excitation of pl by circularly polarized light leads to circularly polarized pl.@xcite this indicates that local spin ordering is stable for times longer than the exciton lifetime , estimated to be in the 100  ps range .",
    "some of us have recently developed a technique for studies of magnetization dynamics by means of time resolved pl measurements performed after a short pulse of the magnetic field.@xcite pulses of the magnetic field are produced by a magnetic coil mounted at the surface of the sample .",
    "the illumination with a laser beam and the collection of the pl signal are performed along the axis of the coil ( faraday configuration ) .",
    "the coil diameter of 0.5  mm results in a small value of inductance and allows to obtain short rise and fall times of about 10  ns .",
    "a 2  a current produces a magnetic field of about 40  mt .",
    "the time evolution of the pl during and after the pulse is probed with resolution down to 10  ns .",
    "magnetization dynamics is studied by analyzing the difference in pl intensities for two circular polarizations after the pulse of the magnetic field .",

    "it is interesting to note that the decays are not mono - exponential .",
    "the relaxation begins with a rapid decay , faster than 100  ns , but it also contains a slower component , in the microsecond range .",
    "one could expect that regions of higher hole density have higher local magnetization resulting in higher barriers for the magnetization reversal . in order to examine this possibility we carried out relaxation measurements for a constant temperature ( below @xmath2 ) , and different detection wavelength which was tuned over the low energy component of the pl line . as mentioned above",
    ", this line shows a red shift when decreasing temperature below @xmath2 .",
    "this shift is proportional to mn magnetization , whose magnitude is primarily determined by the hole density.@xcite due to spatial fluctuations in the hole density,@xcite the line is significantly broadened .",

    "since we are mainly interested in modulation - doped @xmath0-cd@xmath19mn@xmath20te quantum wells , all our results are obtained using the parameter values characteristic for this system , but the methodology we use may as well be applied to other 2d @xmath0-type ii - vi dms structures .",
    "the antiferromagnetic interactions originate from superexchange , the mechanism specific to undoped charge transfer insulators , such as ( cd , mn)te .",
    "the character and magnitude of these interactions are known from previous extensive experimental studies of magnetic properties of ( cd , mn)te . in order to find out how the presence of holes affects the system we compute , in the spirit of the adiabatic approximation , the total energy of the holes at a given configuration of the mn spins . in this way",
    "our approach encompasses automatically the description of carrier - mediated exchange interactions within either @xmath0-@xmath14 zener model or ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yosida theory .",
    "the carrier total energy is evaluated neglecting hole correlations , the approximation that leads to an underestimation of the ferromagnetic coupling.@xcite accordingly , our computed curie temperatures are expected to be systematically lower than those observed experimentally . furthermore , in accord with the effective mass theory , and owing to a relatively small disorder in our structures , we assume that the in - plane and the perpendicular hole motions can be factorized , i.e. , that the total envelope function assumes the form @xmath21 , where @xmath22 with in - plane and perpendicular positions described by @xmath23 and @xmath10 respectively ; @xmath24 is the wave function of a hole residing in the ground state subband of the qw in question . for the biaxial strain under consideration ,",
    "the relevant subband is of the heavy hole origin , so that the spin - orbit interaction fixes the hole spin in the direction of the growth axis .",
    "furthermore , since the heavy holes penetrate only weakly the barriers , @xmath24 in the form corresponding to an infinite qw is adequate for our computations .    within the above model and in the absence of an external magnetic field , the hamiltonian @xmath25 of our system takes the form ,    @xmath26    this hamiltonian describes noninteracting carriers in the heavy hole parabolic valence subband for which the in - plane effective mass is @xmath27 for the qw in question.@xcite since the coupling between the holes and the mn ions is weak in ( cd , mn)te,@xcite we can consider the @xmath0-@xmath14 interaction in a simple contact form ,    @xmath28    where the hole spin @xmath29 , @xmath30 3/2 , is coupled to the mn ions randomly distributed over the fcc lattice sites @xmath31 . we treat mn spins @xmath32 as classical vectors with @xmath33 . while this approximation is certainly qualitatively valid for the large spin in question , quantitatively ",

    "a next important aspect one must understand in order to interpret properly the experimental findings is the way in which the afm interactions influence the magnetization dynamics .",
    "therefore , we have calculated the magnetization autocorrelation function for the system where all short - range afm interactions are disregarded . in fig .  [",
    "fig : corfun5 ] we compare the obtained magnetic autocorrelation functions for systems with and without afm interactions calculated at @xmath143 ( for each system its own @xmath2 as previously determined by mc simulations@xcite had been used ) .",
    "the results presented in fig .  [ fig : corfun5 ] clearly indicate that short - range afm interactions may strongly accelerate the decay of the ferromagnetic order . in accord with the above observation",
    "one can expect that the effect of afm interactions is considerably reduced when the layer of mn ions is thinner than the extend of the hole wave function , in other words , when mn ions are concentrated close to the maximum ( probability ) density of holes . to check this we repeated our calculations with all mn ions occupying only the four central layers of the investigated qw ( note that it is eight layers thick and that for holes the ground state of the infinite well is taken as the `` perpendicular '' part of their wave function , @xmath24 ) .",
    "the results of our calculations are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : corfun11 ] .",
    "one can clearly see that indeed if mn ions reside only in the central layer , the magnetization dynamics resembles the one for the case when all afm interactions are switched off .",
    "we may as well formulate our conclusion the other way round : more mn spins close to the qw edges , faster relaxation of magnetization .",
    "this finding provides a support for theoretical considerations,@xcite suggesting that magnetization relaxation of bound magnetic polarons in @xmath0-type cdte/(cd , mn)te qws occurs owing to the afm coupling to the mn spins located outside the relevant bohr radius .     of mn ions in a cd@xmath125mn@xmath17te quantum",

    "let us now look at the spatial distribution of magnetization and , in particular , whether the presence of competing short - range antiferromagnetic and long - range ferromagnetic interactions results in the formation of magnetic domains .",
    "one of the standard ways to estimate the typical domain size is to calculate the spin - spin two - point connected correlation function @xmath144 given by@xcite    @xmath145    we have calculated spin - spin correlation functions for both : the localized mn ions and the holes for a number of temperature values and various carrier concentrations .",
    "figure  [ fig : corfun6 ] shows the correlation functions @xmath144 obtained for the hole subsystem .",
    "we observe long - range correlations ( longer than the size of the simulation box ) in the ferromagnetic state . for temperatures below @xmath2",
    "the hole liquid becomes completely spin - polarized .",
    "this has already been predicted in the frame of the mean - field approximation for the 2d hole gas in a qw.@xcite in fig .",
    "[ fig : corfun7 ] and [ fig : corfun8 ] the spin - spin correlation functions for the mn subsystem are shown . in fig .",
    "[ fig : corfun7 ] the scale has been stretched to make visible how the short - range afm interactions influence the spin - spin correlation function at small distances . in this way",
    "we can clearly see that for the nearest neighbor mn spins the afm coupling prevails ( the correlation function becomes negative ) . at long distances , however , below @xmath2 , the long - range ferromagnetic interactions dominate as may be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : corfun8 ] that shows the spin - spin correlation functions on a larger scale . as the distance @xmath146 between",
    "the mn spins becomes large we observe ( small ) positive long - range correlations for temperatures below @xmath2 . at the same time",
    "the correlations decrease to zero when temperature increases towards @xmath2 .",
    "the positive correlations observed in the ferromagnetic phase and the lack of correlations in the paramagnetic phase may indicate that magnetic domains do exist , but their typical size is greater than the simulation box . to verify this conjecture",
    "further massive simulations would be needed .     of valence band holes at various temperatures in a cd@xmath125mn@xmath17te quantum well .",

    "we have examined magnetization dynamics in a p - cd@xmath125mn@xmath17te quantum well by magneto - optical studies and by monte carlo simulations taking into account the presence of competing short - range antiferromagnetic superexchange and long - range carrier - mediated ferromagnetic interactions .",
    "single - particle hole energies and eigenfunctions for particular mn spin configurations have been updated numerically after each monte carlo sweep .",
    "in addition to the @xmath0-@xmath14 exchange interaction , spin - independent alloy disorder has been taken into account and found to be important .",
    "in particular , a sufficiently strong attractive potential introduced by the magnetic ion leads to hole localization and to the corresponding disappearance of a long - range order mediated by the carriers .",
    "also a strong repulsive potential , by reducing the magnitude of the carrier wave function at the magnetic ion , may diminish the magnitude of @xmath2 .",
    "this effect is particularly strong in the case of a quantum well , where the direction of the hole spin is fixed rather by the spin - orbit interaction than by the @xmath0-@xmath14 coupling , so that the repulsive potential may not be compensated by the @xmath0-@xmath14 interaction .",
    "both experimental and theoretical results demonstrate that the transition from the paramagnetic to ferromagnetic phase increases the magnetization relaxation time .",
    "in particular , the relaxation time determined from tracing the time evolution of magnetization after a pulse of the magnetic field is shorter than 20 ns in the paramagnetic state .",
    "lowering temperature below @xmath2 results in an increase of the relaxation time up to only 2 @xmath3s .",
    "our numerical results indicate that antiferromagnetic interactions between mn spins account for this relatively fast magnetization fluctuations and , thus , might be responsible for the absence of spontaneous magnetization below @xmath2 , as found in static measurements .",
    "while our monte carlo simulations of the two - point spin - spin connected correlation function show a huge influence of the short - range antiferromagnetic interactions on the magnetization dynamics , they do not reveal the formation of domains that would be smaller than our simulation cell , @xmath148  nm .    at the same time , our monte carlo results reveal that magnetization relaxation in the ferromagnetic phase proceeds primarily due to antiferromagnetic couplings to mn spins residing at the quantum well boundary , as they are weakly polarized by the carriers .",
    "accordingly , magnetization dynamics would be much slow down if the width of the region containing mn spins were been narrower than the extent of the carrier wave function .",
    "we predict , therefore , that spontaneous magnetization and the associated magnetic hysteresis could be observed in quantum wells containing the mn layer only in its center .    the work in warsaw was supported in part by technology agency , by spintra project of european science foundation ( eras - ct-2003 - 980409 ) , and by",
