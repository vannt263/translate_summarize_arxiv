    "since the pioneering work by armstrong @xcite on the process of second - harmonic generation has occurred , spatio - temporal properties of the nonlinearly interacting classical fields have been studied in detail by many authors both theoretically and experimentally .",
    "a new impulse in these studies has occurred when people understood that this process can give rise to the fields with nonclassical properties ( for a review , see , e.g. @xcite ) . namely light with electric - field amplitude fluctuations suppressed below the limit given by quantum mechanics can be generated both in the pump and second - subharmonic fields . also light with nonclassical photon - number statistics",
    "can be obtained - pairwise character of photon - number statistics @xcite generated in the spontaneous process of second - subharmonic generation has been observed @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the best conditions for squeezed - light generation in homogeneous nonlinear media occur , provided that the nonlinear two - mode interaction is perfectly phase matched . under these conditions ,",
    "the principal squeeze variance of the second - subharmonic field can asymptotically reach zero when the gain of the nonlinear interaction increases . on the other hand ,",
    "the pump - field principal squeeze variance can not be less than 0.5 @xcite .",
    "if large values of the nonlinear phase mismatch are allowed , this limit can be overcome due to a nonlinear phase modulation , as suggested in @xcite .",
    "however , the generated signal is very weak .",
    "the most common method how to compensate for the natural nonlinear phase mismatch that occurs in commonly used nonlinear materials is to introduce an additional periodic modulation of the @xmath0 susceptibility using periodical poling @xcite .",
    "several methods for the additional modulation of the local amplitude of this quasi - phase - matched interaction have been developed @xcite .",
    "these methods allow to reach a spectrally broad - band two - mode interaction and so femtosecond pumping of the nonlinear process is possible @xcite .    in order to effectively increase low values of the nonlinear interaction in real materials , configurations in which a nonlinear medium is put inside a cavity",
    "are usually used to generate squeezed light ( e.g. @xcite ) .    in a waveguiding geometry that profits from a strong spatial confinement of the interacting optical fields in the transverse plane resulting in high values of the effective nonlinearity , another method to reach",
    "a nonlinear phase mismatch is possible .",
    "one of the nonlinearly interacting fields can be coupled through its evanescent waves into another field of the same frequency propagating in a neighbouring waveguide .",
    "an exchange of energy between these two linearly coupled fields introduces a spatial modulation of the nonlinearly interacting field that can be set to compensate for the nonlinear phase mismatch @xcite .",
    "interaction of fields in different waveguides through their evanescent waves can be used in various configurations that modify nonclassical properties of optical fields emerging from nonlinear interactions @xcite .",
    "a waveguiding geometry allows another possibility to tailor the nonlinear process - a linear periodic corrugation of the waveguide surface can be introduced as a distributed feedback that scatters the propagating fields @xcite . under suitable conditions ,",
    "the scattered contributions interfere constructively and increase electric - field amplitudes of the propagating fields .",
    "this then results in higher conversion efficiencies of the nonlinear process @xcite .",
    "also squeezed - light generation is supported in this geometry , as discussed in @xcite where scattering of the second - harmonic field on the corrugation has been neglected .",
    "a waveguiding geometry with a periodic corrugation can also be conveniently used for second - harmonic generation in erenkov configuration @xcite . a general model of squeezed - light generation in nonlinear photonic structures has been developed in @xcite .    in this paper , we show that scattering of the interacting fields caused by a linear periodic corrugation supports the generation of squeezed light in both the pump and second - subharmonic fields provided that an electric - field amplitude of at least one of the interacting fields is increased inside the waveguide as a consequence of scattering .",
    "we note that an increase of electric - field amplitudes in the area of periodic corrugation is small compared with that occurring in layered photonic band - gap structures ( with a deep grating ) @xcite .",
    "the generation of squeezed light has been in the center of attention in quantum optics for more than twenty years .",
    "it has been shown that the squeezed light can be generated also in kerr media , nonlinear process of four - wave mixing , and diode lasers pumped by a sub - poissonian current ( for a review , see @xcite ) .",

    "<S> two - mode nonlinear interaction ( second - harmonic and second - subharmonic generation ) in a planar waveguide with a small periodic corrugation at the surface is studied . </S>",
    "<S> scattering of the interacting fields on the corrugation leads to constructive interference that enhances the nonlinear process provided that all the interactions are phase matched . </S>",
    "<S> conditions for the overall phase matching are found . </S>",
    "<S> compared with a perfectly quasi - phase - matched waveguide , better values of squeezing as well as higher intensities are reached under these conditions . </S>",
    "<S> procedure for finding optimum values of parameters for squeezed - light generation is described . </S>"
