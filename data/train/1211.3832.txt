    "our knowledge of the ( sub-)millimetre luminosity function of galaxies has substantially improved in the last few years . before the launch of the _ herschel _ space observatory ( pilbratt et al .",
    "2010 ) , no blind sub - mm surveys of sufficient area were available , and estimates of the local luminosity functions had to rely on follow - up of samples selected at other wavelengths .",
    "the most notable example is the local @xmath7 m luminosity function derived from the scuba local universe galaxy survey ( slugs ; dunne et al .",
    "2000 ) that provided scuba photometry of 104 galaxies drawn from the iras bright galaxy survey ( soifer et al .",
    "better constraints , particularly on the faint end of the @xmath7 m luminosity function as well as estimates of the luminosity function at many wavelengths in the range @xmath8m@xmath7 m , were obtained by serjeant & harrison ( 2005 ) by modeling the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of all 15,411 _ iras _ psc@xmath9 galaxies ( saunders et al .",
    "the seds were constrained by all available far - infrared and sub - mm colour - colour relations from the slugs and elsewhere .",
    "herschel _ surveys have allowed the first determinations of local luminosity functions at 250 , 350 and @xmath10 m based on complete samples of sub - mm selected galaxies ( dye et al .",
    "2010 , vaccari et al .",
    "2010 , dunne et al .",
    "the results are in generally good agreement with the estimates by serjeant & harrison ( 2005 ) .",
    "the _ planck _ ( planck collaboration i , 2011 ) surveys have allowed the construction of the first all - sky catalogs homogeneously selected at several wavelengths from @xmath11 m to 1 cm , the early release compact source catalog ( ercsc ; planck collaboration vii , 2011 ) . at sub - mm wavelengths the dominant population of extragalactic sources consists of nearby dusty galaxies , mostly at distances @xmath12mpc , all with spectroscopic redshift measurements .",
    "these are almost ideal characteristics for estimating local luminosity functions .",
    "in contrast , because of the much smaller covered areas , to get sufficient statistics with _",
    "herschel _ surveys it is necessary to select galaxies up to @xmath130.2 where evolutionary effects may be non - negligible , requiring model - dependent corrections . in addition , for many relatively distant galaxies only photometric redshifts are available .    on the other hand , very low redshift galaxy samples ( @xmath14 ) , like those provided by _",
    "planck _ surveys , have their own drawbacks that must be dealt with carefully .",
    "first , proper motions can give large contributions to the measured redshifts , hence making them unreliable as distance indicators ; redshift - independent distance indicators need then to be used as far as possible .",
    "second , we live in the outskirts of the virgo super - cluster implying that _ planck _ samples contain strong density inhomogeneities , while the standard method to estimate the luminosity function [ the @xmath15 method ( schmidt 1968 ) ] assumes a uniform distribution of galaxies .",
    "although the effect of inhomogeneities is substantially mitigated by the ( almost ) full sky coverage , it must be taken into account .    in this paper",

    "below 353ghz the detected extragalactic sources are mostly radio loud active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , while at frequencies @xmath19ghz they are mostly dusty galaxies ( planck collaboration xiii 2011 ; planck collaboration vii 2012 ) . since we are interested in the latter objects we focus our analysis on the three highest frequency _ planck _ channels although we could also derive an estimate , over a limited luminosity range , of the luminosity function of dusty galaxies at 217 ghz .",

    "one is that determined by the source detection algorithm ( fluxdet ) ; the others are based on aperture photometry ( flux ) , on fitting the source with the _ planck _ point spread function at the location of the source ( psfflux ) , and on fitting the source with an elliptical gaussian model ( gauflux ) . as stated in the explanatory supplement to the _ planck _",

    "<S> the _ planck _ early release compact source catalog ( ercsc ) has offered the first opportunity to accurately determine the luminosity function of dusty galaxies in the very local universe ( i.e. distances @xmath0mpc ) , at several ( sub-)millimetre wavelengths , using blindly selected samples of low redshift sources , unaffected by cosmological evolution . </S>",
