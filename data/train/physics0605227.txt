    "expressed in mathematical terms , the inverse scattering problem for linear waves in isotropic media has unique solutions @xcite .",
    "therefore , the asymptotic behavior of propagation through empty space , or a uniform medium , is only consistent with the actual propagation through a uniform medium . in theory",
    ", nothing can be hidden . in practice ,",
    "a dielectric invisibility device would perhaps create a slight haze , instead of a perfect image .",
    "the principal distortions of invisibility are due to reflections and time delays .",
    "reflections can be made exponentially small for devices that are large in comparison with the wavelength of light @xcite .",
    "time delays are unavoidable .",
    "unless the phase delays are tuned to be multiples of @xmath2 for some certain frequencies , they will result in wave - front dislocations at boundaries that lead to image distortions due to diffraction @xcite .",
    "wave - front dislocations also pose the risk of detection by sensitive wave - front sensors @xcite . in this paper",
    "we calculate the time delay caused by the scheme @xcite based on optical conformal mapping , assuming two - dimensional light propagation from infinity .",
    "we find that the delay is uniform for all directions and impact parameters , although the refractive - index profiles of invisibility devices are necessarily asymmetric @xcite .",
    "therefore , the distortions of images composed of various spatial fourier components are uniform , which reduces the risk of detection .",
    "our theory is based on geometrical optics @xcite and in particular on fermat s principle @xcite and on hamilton s analogy @xcite between the propagation of light in media and the motion of particles in classical mechanics @xcite .",
    "suppose that the refractive index profile @xmath3 does not vary much over scales comparable with the wavelength of light . in this regime of geometrical optics",
    "both polarization components of light @xmath4 for frequencies @xmath5 obey the helmholtz equation @xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 denotes the speed of light in vacuum .",
    "the helmholtz equation ( [ eq : helmholtz ] ) is equivalent to the stationary schrdinger equation with potential @xmath8 and energy @xmath9 such that @xcite @xmath10 therefore we expect that hamilton s equations for light rays are equivalent to newton s equations of mechanical particles moving in the potential ( [ eq : potential ] ) .",
    "the frequency @xmath5 plays the role of the hamiltonian and the wavevector @xmath11 corresponds to the canonical momentum , @xmath12 indeed , we obtain from hamilton s equations @xcite the relations @xmath13 that result in the equation of motion for light rays @xmath14 we can express this equation as newton s second law @xmath15 with the effective time increment @xmath16 measured in spatial units and defined by @xmath17 equation  ( [ eq : motion ] ) also reveals the connection to fermat s principle @xcite : light in media with refractive index @xmath18 takes the shortest ( or longest ) optical path where the optical path length is defined , in cartesian coordinates , as @xmath19 to see this we use the fact that the modulus of the hamiltonian velocity @xmath20 equals @xmath21 , a simple consequence of hamilton s equations ( [ eq : hamilton ] ) , and write @xmath22 these are the euler - lagrange equations @xcite for the effective lagrangian @xmath23 . hence they minimize or maximize the integral of @xmath23 that is equal to the optical path length ( [ eq : optlength ] ) , which proves fermat s principle .",
    "the phase of a light ray is given by @xcite @xmath24 along a ray trajectory the phase @xmath25 is constant .",
    "consequently , the phase delay @xmath26 corresponds to @xmath27 .",
    "therefore , the hamiltonian time @xmath28 measures the true time delay of light caused by the refractive - index profile , whereas the newtonian time @xmath29 serves as a convenient parameter to characterize the ray trajectories .",
    "another ingredient of our theory is optical conformal mapping @xcite .",
    "consider an effectively two - dimensional case where the medium is uniform in one direction and the light propagates in a plane orthogonal to this axis .",
    "it is convenient to use complex numbers @xmath30 for describing the cartesian coordinates @xmath31 and @xmath32 in this plane",
    ". in complex notation , the helmholtz equation ( [ eq : helmholtz ] ) assumes the form @xmath33 suppose that the complex @xmath34 coordinates are transformed to new coordinates @xmath35 with an analytic function @xmath36 that does not depend on the complex conjugate @xmath37 and hence satisfies the cauchy - riemann differential equations @xcite .",
    "such analytic functions define conformal mappings of the complex plane onto riemann surfaces @xcite , see , for example , fig .",
    "[ fig : sheets ] .    ]    since @xmath38 and @xmath39 we obtain in @xmath35 space the helmholtz equation ( [ eq : helm ] ) with the transformed refractive - index profile @xmath40 that is related to @xmath18 as @xcite @xmath41 on the riemann surface , light thus propagates according to the refractive index profile @xmath40 .",
    "the strategy @xcite for designing an invisibility device is to take advantage of the sheets of the riemann surface .",
    "each sheet corresponds to a distinct region in physical space , see , for example , fig .",
    "[ fig : surface ] .",
    "the branch cuts of the riemann surface represent the boundaries between the various regions .",
    "if one wishes to hide an object , one should hide it on riemann sheets and prevent light from entering these sheets . to do this , light that has ventured across a branch cut into the interior of the device should be guided back to the exterior .",
    "this is done by placing a refractive - index profile on the first interior sheet in which all ray trajectories are closed @xcite .",
    "the device thus consists of two layers , an outer layer that corresponds to the exterior sheet on the riemann surface in @xmath35 space and an inner layer that corresponds to the first interior sheet . for the outer layer",
    "we require that the refractive index approaches unity at @xmath42 , the value for empty space , which implies for the conformal map @xmath43 at the boundary between the exterior and the first interior sheet light is refracted @xcite according to snell s law , unless it is totally reflected @xcite . since refraction is reversible , the light rays are refracted back to the original direction of incidence when they leave the branch cut to the exterior sheet .",
    "seen on the riemann surface , light rays perform loops around a branch point that guide them back to the exterior sheet , the outside layer of the device . seen in physical space , light is guided around the object and leaves the cloaking layers of the device as if nothing were there .    ]",
    "the time delay caused by an invisibility device depends of course on its spatial extension .",
    "imagine that the refractive - index profile @xmath3 is replaced by @xmath44 with the constant scale @xmath45 .",
    "if @xmath46 and @xmath47 are solutions of hamilton s ray equations ( [ eq : hamilton ] ) then @xmath48 and @xmath11 are solutions , too , if @xmath28 is replaced by @xmath49 .",
    "this proves that the time delay is directly proportional to the spatial extension of the refractive - index profile , as one would expect .",
    "since the conformal mapping @xmath36 is simply a coordinate transformation , the time delay between two points in @xmath34 space and the delay between the corresponding points in @xmath35 space are identical .",
    "therefore , the part of the refractive - index profile @xmath18 in physical space that is due to the optical conformal mapping does not influence the time delay at all .",
    "delays are only caused by the index profile in @xmath35 space that serves to guide light around a branch cut on the first interior sheet .",
    "for simplifying the notation , we denote this profile by @xmath18 ( dropping the prime ) .",
    "suppose that the transformed refractive - index profile @xmath18 on the riemann sheet is radially symmetric with respect to one branch point and designed such that all trajectories of light rays are closed curves around that point .",
    "the time delay @xmath50 of the invisibility device is equal to the time light takes to perform a loop around the branch point .",
    "a branch point where @xmath51 sheets meet requires @xmath51 turns ( @xmath51 is the winding number ) .",
    "to calculate the delay , we use polar coordinates @xmath52 and @xmath53 centered at the branch point .",
    "we obtain from the conservation law of energy @xcite for the newtonian dynamics ( [ eq : newton ] ) of light rays @xmath54 as in the standard theory of motion in central potentials @xcite we also use the conservation of the angular momentum , @xmath55 written here in terms of the impact parameter @xmath56 , and obtain from the conservation laws ( [ eq : energy ] ) and ( [ eq : am ] ) the relation @xcite @xmath57 to calculate the time delay , we express the hamiltonian time increment ( [ eq : timeincrement ] ) in terms of @xmath58 , utilizing the conservation of the angular momentum ( [ eq : am ] ) .",
    "then we use the relation ( [ eq : phi ] ) to write the time delay as an integral over the radial range of the trajectory .",
    "the range of @xmath52 is bounded by the radial turning points @xmath59 where @xmath60 vanishes , which implies @xmath61 one trajectory between @xmath62 and @xmath63 corresponds to half a turn around the branch point .",
    "consequently , @xmath64 in general , the time delay depends on the impact parameter .",
    "however , for closed loops , @xmath50 turns out to be independent of @xmath56 . to see this , we differentiate the time delay ( [ eq : t0 ] ) with respect to the impact parameter @xmath56 and obtain from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : phi ] ) and ( [ eq : turn ] ) @xmath65 because , when all loops around the branch point are closed , @xmath53 reaches @xmath66 regardless of the value of @xmath56 .",
    "consequently , the time delay does not depend on the impact parameter at which light has entered the branch cut to the first interior sheet , _ i.e. _ the interior layer of the device .",
    "the invisibility device causes a uniform time delay .",
    "reference @xcite mentions two examples of refractive - index profiles on the interior sheet that can be used to circumnavigate the branch point such that all loops are closed , the harmonic - oscillator profile @xmath67 that is related to a luneburg lens @xcite and the kepler profile @xcite @xmath68 that is related to an eaton lens @xcite . here",
    "@xmath69 and @xmath70 are constants that describe the boundaries of the refractive - index profiles where @xmath18 vanishes .",
    "seen on the riemann surface , light can not penetrate the outside of circles of radii @xmath69 and @xmath70 , respectively , because here the refractive index would be purely imaginary .",
    "the optical conformal mapping turns areas on the first interior sheet inside out @xcite .",
    "therefore , the exterior of these circles corresponds to the invisible interior of the device .",
    "the harmonic - oscillator and the kepler potential are the only spherically symmetric potentials @xmath8 where the trajectories for all bound - state energies @xmath9 are closed @xcite .",
    "however , what matters in the propagation of light rays is the difference ( [ eq : potential ] ) between @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "therefore it is sufficient when for a specific value of @xmath9 the trajectories for all angular - momenta @xmath56 are closed .",
    "a known example where this is the case is maxwell s fish eye @xcite with the refractive - index profile @xmath71 the constant radius @xmath72 characterizes the scale of the index profile , the radial halfpoint , and @xmath73 is a parameter that defines the refractive index at the branch point . if maxwell s fish eye is employed to guide light back to the exterior riemann sheet , the entire interior sheet is reached by the incident light . however ,",
    "when the riemann surface contains more sheets than the exterior and the first interior sheet , all the remaining sheets are hidden .",
    "anything placed there is invisible .",
    "the newtonian equation of motion for rays generated by the harmonic - oscillator profile ( [ eq : hookeforce ] ) describes hooke s law of a force proportional to the distance , whereas the kepler profile ( [ eq : newtonforce ] ) generates newton s inverse - square law . in both cases ,",
    "the trajectories form ellipses for all bound states , a fact that newton found exceptionally remarkable @xcite . however ,",
    "hooke s law and newton s law can be transformed into each other by a transmutation of force according to the arnold - kasner theorem @xcite .      in the case of the harmonic - oscillator profile ( [ eq : hookeforce ] )",
    "the ray trajectories are very simple @xcite : they form a set of ellipses centered at the origin ( the branch point ) , see fig .",
    "[ fig : hooke ] .    , title=\"fig : \" ] , title=\"fig : \" ]    to calculate the time spent along a given ellipse we use cartesian coordinates @xmath31 and @xmath32 rotated such that they match the axes of this ellipse .",
    "we describe the ellipse as @xmath74 with the constants @xmath75 and @xmath56 being the axis lengths .",
    "one easily verifies that the trajectory ( [ eq : ellipse ] ) solves the newtonian equation of motion ( [ eq : newton ] ) .",
    "the ray trajectory corresponds to the newtonian energy @xmath76 , which implies @xmath77 consequently , we obtain for the time delay @xmath78 in agreement with our general results , the time delay caused by the harmonic - oscillator profile depends on the spatial extension @xmath69 and is otherwise uniform .      in order to calculate the time delay caused by the kepler profile ( [ eq : newtonforce ] ) ,",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig : newton ] , we use the transmutation of force @xcite to the harmonic - oscillator profile , _",
    "i.e. _ the transformation of newton s law into hooke s law that is also based on conformal mapping @xcite .",

    "the potentials @xmath8 and @xmath80 are thus related to each other , generating dual forces @xcite . consider @xmath82 the map @xmath36 corresponds to the hooke potential ( [ eq : potential ] ) of the harmonic - oscillator profile ( [ eq : hookeforce ] ) with energy @xmath83 and , in turn , @xmath36 generates the kepler profile ( [ eq : newtonforce ] ) that corresponds to newton s inverse square law with the parameter @xmath84 since conformal mapping does not influence the time delay in light propagation , the delay generated by the kepler profile ( [ eq : newtonforce ] ) corresponds to that of the harmonic - oscillator profile ( [ eq : hookeforce ] ) , apart from one subtlety : already a half - ellipse of the harmonic - oscillator is mapped onto a complete kepler ellipse , because of the square map ( [ eq : map ] ) .",
    "consequently , the time delay is @xmath85 in complete analogy to the result ( [ eq : hookedelay ] ) for the harmonic - oscillator profile .",

    "<S> as a consequence of the wave nature of light , invisibility devices based on isotropic media can not be perfect . </S>",
    "<S> the principal distortions of invisibility are due to reflections and time delays . </S>",
    "<S> reflections can be made exponentially small for devices that are large in comparison with the wavelength of light . </S>",
    "<S> time delays are unavoidable and will result in wave - front dislocations . </S>",
    "<S> this paper considers invisibility devices based on optical conformal mapping . </S>",
    "<S> the paper shows that the time delays do not depend on the directions and impact parameters of incident light rays , although the refractive - index profile of any conformal invisibility device is necessarily asymmetric . </S>",
    "<S> the distortions of images are thus uniform , which reduces the risk of detection . </S>",
    "<S> the paper also shows how the ideas of invisibility devices are connected to the transmutation of force , the stereographic projection and escheresque tilings of the plane . </S>",
