    "it appears that mass accretion onto compact objects through accretion disks is often accompanied by mass outflow from these disks .",
    "for example , disk outflows are observed in active galactic nuclei ; non - magnetic cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) ; and young stellar objects . in the case of cvs ,",
    "key evidence for outflows comes from p - cygni profiles of strong uv lines such as c  iv@xmath01549 .",
    "however , the evidence for the outflows is not limited just to the strong uv lines ( e.g. , long & knigge 2002 and references therein ) .",
    "understanding the outflows in cvs is important because they have been the best observed outflows from compact objects and promise to provide us with insights into all disk outflows . until recently the interpretation of data",
    "was limited to fitting observed profiles to synthetic profiles calculated from kinematic models ( e.g. , mauche & raymond 1987 ; drew 1987 ; shlosman & vitello 1993 ; knigge , woods & drew 1995 ; long & knigge 2002 ) .    the most plausible mechanism for driving the cv outflows is radiation pressure on spectral lines . recently",
    ", numerical hydrodynamic models of 2.5-d , time - dependent radiation driven disk winds have been constructed for application to cv disk winds ( pereyra , kallman & blondin 1997 ; proga , stone & drew 1998 , hereafter psd  98 ; proga , stone & drew 1999 , hereafter psd  99 ) .",
    "these initial studies confirm viability of the radiation driving mechanism .",
    "however , the same studies reveal some difficulties in obtaining line profiles matching the observed profiles ( proga et al . 2002 ,",
    "paper  1 hereafter ) .",
    "the latter is likely true even when we allow for the magnetic field effects ( proga 2003 ) .",
    "we focus here on re - examining pure radiation - driven disk wind models for cvs .",
    "in particular , we examine the size of the region where the line is formed and show that what is required to improve the model predictions is to capture the entire line formation region by increasing the radial range of the models . in section  2 , we summarize the key elements of our calculations .",
    "the results are presented in section  3 . in section  4",
    ", we discuss key aspects of the synthetic line profiles and make comparisons with recent observations .",
    "for this paper , we recalculated dynamical models presented by psd  99 and calculated a few new models .",
    "we refer a reader to psd  99 for details on wind models and to paper  1 for details on line - profile calculations .",
    "the computations of line profiles are exactly as in paper  1 .",
    "we made only two minor modifications to the models : ( i ) we increased the outer radius of the computational domain , @xmath1 , from 10 to 100 white dwarf radii and ( ii ) as in psd  99 , we computed models with the radiation force using the intensity of the radiation integrated over all wavelengths , @xmath0 , but also using the intensity of the radiation integrated over the uv band only ( i.e. , @xmath2 ) .",
    "we call the former @xmath3 and the latter @xmath4 .",
    "we found that the second modification can change the wind solution ( e.g. , there is no outflow originating from large radii on the disk ) but typically this is not much reflected in the predicted line profiles . on the other hand ,",
    "the first modification does not change the wind solution but has a significant effect on the predicted line profiles .",
    "our basic set of line profiles is based on four hydrodynamical models computed on the larger computational domain with the model parameters as in psd  99 s models a , b , c , and d ( see table 1 ) .",
    "we call our models recalculated with the intensity @xmath3 on the larger grid a1 , b1 , c1 , d1 , respectively , while models recalculated with the intensity @xmath4 on the larger grid are labeled a2 , b2 , c2 , d2 . to examine the effect of viewing angle on the line profiles , for each disk wind model we compute line profiles for five inclination angles : @xmath5 , and @xmath6 . examining effects of inclination angle",
    "is important because of the strong inclination angle dependence observed in cv spectra .",
    "figure  1 shows some of the model line profiles obtained after scaling to unit continuum level .    to illustrate the key differences between profiles from paper  1 and our profiles , we present results from the b models and the c models .",
    "we mention however , that the changes in the line profiles for the a models and the d models are qualitatively similar to the changes for the b models and the c models .",
    "table  1 summarizes the main input parameters of the hydrodynamical disk wind models including the mass accretion rate , @xmath7 , total stellar luminosity relative to the disk luminosity , @xmath8 , and resultant total system luminosity , @xmath9 .",
    "additionally , the table lists , the gross properties of the disk winds including the mass - loss rate , @xmath10 , characteristic velocity of the fast stream at 10@xmath11 , @xmath12 for model a , b , c , and d and their counterparts for the models based on the larger grid , @xmath13 , and flow opening angle , @xmath14 .    first , we present our results for a wind for which @xmath15 and the white dwarf ( wd ) is assumed to be dark @xmath16 ( model  b , b1 , and b2 ) .",
    "we note that the b models have similar properties , except for @xmath10 which is lower for b2 than for models b and b1 ( see table  1 ) .",
    "the lower @xmath10 in model b2 is due to the fact that the radiation force in model b2 is lower than for models b and b1 as it is computed using @xmath4 , which is lower than @xmath3 .",
    "the absence of a wind model a2 is caused by the same effect , at a more extreme level .",
    "the a models are for a relatively low luminosity and a reduction of the driving radiation flux resulting from taking into account only the uv photons makes the total radiation force too weak to overcome the gravity and drive a wind .",
    "the five top panels of figure  1 ( figs .",
    "1a-1e ) compare the profiles for model  b as a function of @xmath17 from paper  1 ( thin solid lines ) with the profiles predicted by models b1 and b2 ( dashed and thick solid lines , respectively ) .",
    "the line profiles from paper  1 for @xmath18 and @xmath19 show two maximum absorptions almost equally shifted from the line center to the blue and red .",
    "this effect is due to the fact that the rotation dominates over expansion in shaping the line profile for @xmath20 .",
    "there is little absorption near the line center .",
    "the most obvious change in the profiles caused by taking into account the wind at larger radii is the increase of the absorption near the line center .",
    "our detailed analysis of the line - forming region shows that this central absorption is due to the wind originating at @xmath21 which has optically thick resonance surfaces at @xmath22 to the photons close to the line center .",
    "thus , the ` third ' component of the absorption due to the wind at large radii changes qualitatively the shape of the total line profile for @xmath18 and @xmath19 and resolves the problem of the two maximum absorptions . for @xmath23",
    ", the outer wind significantly contributes the line absorption at all wavelengths .",
    "we note that the red and blue edges of the lines do not change when the wind at larger radii is taken into account ( compare thick solid lines with dashed and thin solid lines in fig .  1 ) .",
    "this reflects the fact that the old and new wind solutions are very similar within @xmath24 and that the old models capture well the acceleration zone of the fastest part of the wind ( e.g. , psd  98 ) .",
    "note that the fastest wind is responsible for the position of the blue edge of the absorption at the lowest inclination .",
    "the line profiles based on our new models have a similar dependence on the inclination angle as the line profiles from paper  1 .",
    "namely , the absorption weakens whereas the scattered emission strengthens as inclination angle increases . additionally , the red edge is at the line center for @xmath25 and moves to the red as @xmath17 increases for @xmath26 .",
    "the five bottom panels of figure  1 ( figs .",
    "1f-1j ) compare the profiles for model  c as a function of @xmath17 ( thin solid lines ) with the profiles predicted by models c1 and c2 ( dashed and thick solid lines , respectively ) .",
    "model  c is an example of a strong steady state wind where @xmath15 and wd radiates at the same rate as the disk , @xmath27 . in analogy with the b models ,",
    "the c models have similar properties except for @xmath10 , which is lower for c2 than for model c and c1 ( see table  1 ) .",
    "the line profiles for model  c ( fig.1f-1j ) are different from those for model  b for @xmath28 . for model  b ,",
    "the line develops a strong , more or less symmetric , double - peaked emission when seen nearly edge - on whereas for model  c , the line develops a typical p  cygni profile with blueshifted absorption and redshifted emission .",
    "additionally , the line is significantly broader for model  c than for model  b. the rotation of the wind does not dominate over expansion in shaping the line . in particular , the shape and strength of the blueshifted absorption is due to expansion . for @xmath29 ,",
    "there is a rotationally broadened redshifted absorption .",
    "the redshifted absorption is weaker and narrower than the expansion - dominated blueshifted absorption .",
    "the contribution from the outer wind causes similar changes to the line profiles for model  c as it does to the profiles for model  b. the line profiles for model  c from paper  1 show a deep narrow absorption at @xmath30 for @xmath31 ( fig .",
    "1i ) and at @xmath32 for @xmath33 ( fig .",
    "the central absorption due to the outer wind broadens and strengthens the absorption for @xmath31 and eliminates the central emission which has a peak at @xmath34 in the line profile from paper  1 .",
    "additionally , the outer wind strengthens the red - shifted emission for @xmath35 . as a result , for @xmath31 , the line profiles predicted by models c1 and c2 does not exhibit the double - humped structure seen in the line profile predicted by model  c. for @xmath36 , the line profiles predicted by models c1 and c2 develop a double - peaked emission without the deep narrow absorption at @xmath30 which is present in the profile from paper  1 .",
    "this narrow absorption disappeared in the profiles for model c1 and c2 , mainly because the blue - shifted absorption is weaker in our new model than in the old model .    for @xmath37 ,",
    "the line profiles for model  b and c are similar in three respects : ( i ) the scattered emission is weak , ( ii ) the contribution from the outer wind is negligible in the red part but it is significant in the blue part of the profiles , and ( iii ) the contribution from the outer wind does not change the position of the red and blue edges of the lines .    in analogy to models",
    "b and c , at @xmath36 , the scattered emission is seen as weaker by the observer for models c1 and c2 than for models b1 and b2 because the background continuum emission is stronger in the c models . at this high inclination ,",
    "the background continuum of the c model is dominated by the wd contribution ( see table  1 in paper  1 ) .",
    "our main result is that the inclusion of a disk wind at larger radii changes qualitatively and quantitatively the line profiles predicted by the pure radiation - driven disk wind model .",
    "the models computed on a small grid  such as those in psd  99 , where the outer radius equals 10 @xmath11  are sufficient to calculate the gross properties of the disk wind .",
    "for example , psd  99 s simulations are sufficient to calculate the wind mass - loss rate and the fast part of the wind , which are both associated with the outflow from the innermost disk .",
    "however , the previous simulations do not capture the entire region where lines are formed . as a result",
    ", they underpredict the line absorption and to a lesser extent the scattered emission .",
    "the previous simulations predicted a double - humped structure near the line center for intermediate inclinations .",
    "this structure is due to a nonnegligible red - shifted absorption that is formed in the slow wind where the rotational velocity dominates over expansion velocity .",
    "we showed here that by taking into account the downstream part of the same slow wind we were able to increase significantly the central absorption . as a result",
    ", the double - humped structure is reshaped to a more typical broad trough .",
    "we emphasize that all improvements in the shape as well as the strength of the absorption were achieved without changing the gross properties of the wind .",
    "in particular , our new models do not predict a higher mass - loss rate than the previous models .",
    "the changes in the line profiles are mainly caused by the fact that the ratio between the rotational and poloidal velocity decreases downstream .    in paper  1",
    ", we showed that the double minimum apparent near line center can be replaced by a more plausible single , blueshifted minimum when we make the slow wind transparent .",
    "we concluded then , that the wind - formed line profiles seen at ultraviolet wavelengths can not originate in a flow where rotation and poloidal expansion are comparable .",
    "the uv lines must trace gas that expands substantially faster than it rotates .",
    "our new results support this reasoning .",
    "our new and old line profiles have many features that are qualitatively consistent with the features of the observed line profiles .",
    "these include the classical p - cygni shape for a range of inclinations , the location of the maximum depth of the absorption component at velocities less than the terminal velocity ( a requirement discussed in drew 1987 ) , and the transition from net absorption to net emission with increasing inclination . however , our new line profiles are also qualitatively consistent with the observations , in particular , the depth and width of the absorption .",
    "the main discrepancy between the predicted line profiles and the observed ones is in the line emission .",
    "specifically , the model can not produce the redshifted emission as strong as that seen , for example , in the civ profile of many systems with intermediate inclinations ( see below ) . however , this shortcoming is not a great surprise  this has been a problem for a while ( see e.g. mauche , lee & kallman 1997 ; ko et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "we are undertaking a systematic comparison between predicted line profiles and observations for many systems .",
    "such a study is needed to support our finding that the pure radiation - driven disk wind model can work for cv winds in the sense that it can reproduce the observed line profiles for model parameters ( e.g. , system luminosities ) suitable to cvs . our preliminary results from limited survey of dynamical models and their predictions are promising . to illustrate this",
    ", we compare our new profiles with spectrally well - resolved uv observations for the brightest nova - like variable , ix  vel ( hartley [ 2002 ] ; in paper  1 , we made a model comparison with the same data ) . in figure 2",
    ", we show a comparison between profiles derived from the model with @xmath15 , @xmath38 ( model e2 ) and observations of the civ  1549  and siiv 1403  transitions . to show how much line emission",
    "is required we plot only the absorption component of the line synthesized for @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "the observed @xmath17 for this system is @xmath40 ( beuermann & thomas 1990 ) .",
    "the choice for the relative luminosity of wd ( i.e. , @xmath38 ) was motivated by the fact that the line profiles predicted by model b2 with @xmath16 and model c2 with @xmath27 bracket the observed profiles .",
    "figure 2 clearly shows that the model profiles well reproduce the blue - shifted absorption .",
    "therefore , we conclude that we have significantly narrowed the gap between the kinematics of the radiation - driven models and reality .",
    "the gap is only narrowed but not bridged yet because the mass fluxes required to match the observed spectra at least of ix  vel are somewhat higher than those observed . in particular , it is believed that the luminosity of the system requires a mass accretion rate of at most @xmath41 , whereas our line profiles require @xmath15 and @xmath38 , yielding a system luminosity higher than the observed one by a factor of @xmath42 . however , our main point is that this discrepancy is much smaller than it used to be ( i.e. , it was more than 1 order of magnitude ) and we believe that it can be reduced still further .",
    "we have computed many models , changing various model parameters such as @xmath7 and the parameters of the force multiplier , @xmath43 and @xmath44 . in general",
    ", we find that there is a degeneracy in the model parameters as far as line profiles are concerned ( psd  98 found an analogous degeneracy for the wind properties ) .",
    "for example , models with slightly different parameters  such as @xmath7 and @xmath43  produce similar line profiles for different @xmath17 .",
    "additionally , a model with the same parameters as model a2 but with @xmath45 instead @xmath46 predicts very similar line profiles to model b2 for the same @xmath17 .",
    "finally , we find that the product @xmath47 , not its individual factors , appears to be a fundamental parameter determining the line profiles ( i.e. , their width and depth ) for the parameter range applicable to cvs .",
    "this has an important implication for our models : to obtain a theoretical fit as good as shown in fig . 2 for a fixed @xmath17",
    ", we need @xmath48 rather than specifically @xmath38 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 as for model e2 .    as in paper  1 , some aspects of our results depend on our assumptions about the disk and microphysics of the wind",
