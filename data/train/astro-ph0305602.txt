    "the kuiper belt is a vast swarm of comets orbiting at the solar system s outer edge .",
    "this belt is comprised of debris that was left over from the epoch of planet formation , and this swarm s distribution of orbit elements preserves a record of events that had occurred when the solar system was still quite young .",
    "a common goal of nearly all dynamical studies of the kuiper belt is to decipher this kuiper belt record .",
    "however this record is still open to some interpretation .    the dots in fig .",
    "[ compare_ei ] give the kuiper belt objects ( kbos ) eccentricities @xmath7 and inclinations @xmath8 versus their semimajor axes @xmath9 .",
    "this figure reveals the kbos three major dynamical classes : the plutinos which inhabit neptune s 3:2 resonance at @xmath10 au , the main belt kbos which are the non  resonant kbos orbiting between @xmath11 au , and the more distant scattered kbos that live in eccentric , nearly neptune  crossing orbits .",
    "the figure also shows that the plutinos and the scattered kbos have inclinations that span @xmath12 , while the main belt kbos appear to have a bimodal distribution of inclinations centered on @xmath13 and @xmath14 @xcite . note that accretion models show that these large @xmath15 km kbos must have first formed from much smaller planetesimal seeds that were initially in nearly circular and coplanar orbits having @xmath7 and @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "however gravitational self  stirring can not account for the kuiper belt s current excited state , so one or more mechanisms must also have stirred up the kuiper belt since the time of formation .",
    "the orbits of the scattered kbos are perhaps the most easily understood .",
    "these objects likely have had one or more close encounters with neptune which lofted these bodies into eccentric , inclined orbits @xcite .",
    "repeated encounters with neptune cause these objects semimajor axes and eccentricities to evolve stochastically along the neptune  crossing curve shown in fig .",
    "[ compare_ei ] , and most of these bodies are ultimately ejected or accreted by the giant planets .",
    "however neptune has numerous weak , high  order mean motion resonances that thread the kuiper belt , and these resonances permit some of these scattered objects to diffuse to lower eccentricities .",
    "this allows a small percentage of the scattered objects to persist over the age of the solar system at eccentricities just below the neptune  crossing curve seen fig .",
    "[ compare_ei ] @xcite .",
    "this diffusion to lower eccentricities may also have been more pronounced had neptune s orbit also migrated outwards . in particular , @xcite shows that during the epoch of planet migration , mean motion and secular resonances act as pathways that allow some scattered kbos to descend _ irreversibly _ into lower  eccentricity orbits that are far from the neptune  crossing curve and hence stable .",
    "since scattered kbos have large inclinations of @xmath17 , this process might also account for the main belt s bimodal inclination distribution , with the @xmath18 component representing the main belt s native population of low ",
    "inclination kbos , and the @xmath19 being due to scattered invaders who were deposited in the main belt by neptune .",
    "however this process is quite inefficient since only @xmath20 of these scattered kbos manage to find orbits that are stable over a solar age @xcite .",
    "the possibility that neptune s orbit had expanded outwards is also supported by the cluster of kbos that inhabit neptune s 3:2 resonance ( see figure [ compare_ei ] ) .",
    "this may have occurred when neptune had first formed and began to vigorously scatter the local planetesimal debris .",
    "this process can drive an exchange of angular momentum between the planets and the planetesimal disk @xcite , so this episode of disk  clearing can result in a rearrangement of all of the giant planets orbits over a timescale of @xmath4 years @xcite .",
    "outward planet migration will also cause neptune s mean  motion resonances to sweep out across the primordial kuiper belt , and these migrating resonances are quite effective at capturing kbos and pumping up their eccentricities @xcite .",
    "models of this process show that if neptune s orbit had in fact smoothly expanded some @xmath21 au over a timescale longer than a few million years , then resonance capture would have deposited numerous kbos in the 3:2 and the 2:1 resonances with eccentricities distributed over @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "although numerous kbos do indeed inhabit neptune s 3:2 resonance , only a handful are known to live near the 2:1 resonance at @xmath23 au , and many of these bodies have eccentricities of @xmath24 which puts them quite near the neptune  crossing curve ( see fig .",
    "[ compare_ei ] ) .",
    "thus it is possible that some or all of the bodies orbiting near @xmath23 au might instead be members of the scattered belt .",
    "thus if planet migration did indeed occur , then the apparent low abundance of kbos at the 2:1 resonance is a mystery that can only be partly due to the observational bias that selects against the discovery of lower eccentricity objects at the 2:1 @xcite .",
    "but of particular interest here is the main belt which preserves additional evidence for another mechanism having stirred up the kuiper belt .",
    "again , if neptune did indeed migrate outwards @xmath21 au , then the entire main belt was swept by the advancing 2:1 resonance .",
    "models of planet migration show that the efficiency of resonance capture is no more than @xmath25 @xcite , so the current members of the main belt evidently avoided permanent capture by slipping through the advancing 2:1 resonance .",
    "however this planet migration scenario is utterly unable to account for the high inclinations of @xmath12 observed in the main belt ( see fig .",
    "[ compare_ei ] ) , since the n ",
    "body simulations show that the advancing 2:1 resonance typically excites main belt inclinations by only a few degrees @xcite . evidently , an additional mechanism is also responsible for exciting the main kbo belt .",
    "it has been shown that sizable kbo excitation can occur if a recently  formed neptune had been scattered outwards by jupiter and/or saturn into a belt  crossing orbit @xcite .",
    "another possible source of kbo excitation is the invasion of the main belt by the scattered belt @xcite .",
    "however this latter process is a very inefficient mechanism having @xmath26 ; an alternate mechanism that is possibly more efficient will be explored below .    it has also been suggested that secular resonance sweeping may have been responsible for exciting the kuiper belt @xcite .",
    "note that the locations of the secular resonances are very sensitive to the solar system s mass distribution .",
    "consequently , the depletion of the solar nebula ( which includes perhaps @xmath27 of the solar system s initial mass content ) could have driven these secular resonances across vast tracts of the solar system .",
    "indeed , the model by @xcite suggests that if the nebula was depleted on a timescale of @xmath28 years , main belt inclinations of @xmath29 can be excited due to the passage of the @xmath30 secular resonance that sweeps outwards to infinity as the nebula is depleted from the ecliptic , then almost no excess excitation results @xcite .",
    "we also note that the nebula models of @xcite as well as @xcite both treat the gas disk as a rigid slab of gas .",
    "however a more realistic treatment would allow the nebula disk to flex and warp in response to the planets secular perturbations .",
    "it is suspected that this additional degree of freedom will substantially alter the secular resonance sweeping ; indeed , it can be argued that the @xmath30 never did sweep across the kuiper belt on account of this flexure ( e.  chiang and w.  ward , 2002 , private communication ) , so perhaps secular resonance sweeping of the kuiper belt is actually a moot issue . ] .",
    "however this model is rather idealized in that it treats the kuiper belt as massless , which is a concern since a primordial kuiper belt having some mass is also susceptible to the propagation of very long  wavelength spiral waves that can be launched at a secular resonance in the disk @xcite .",
    "this issue is worth further examination since wave  action can alter the magnitude of resonant excitation considerably @xcite . but even if there is no resonance in the disk , planets orbiting interior to a particle disk can still launch these spiral waves at the disk s inner edge @xcite .",
    "preliminary results from a model of secular resonance sweeping also reveals that a kuiper belt having only a modest amount of mass is utterly awash in these waves once the nebula is depleted @xcite .",
    "however the purpose of the present study is to first characterize the properties of these waves in the simpler , post  nebula environment , and to explore their cosmogonic implications .",
    "thus the following will consider a suite of models of the secular evolution of the outer solar system for primordial kuiper belts having a variety of masses .",
    "accretion models tell us that the primordial kuiper belt must have had a mass of @xmath31 m@xmath32 in the @xmath33 au interval in order for pluto and its cohort of kbos to have formed and survive over the age of the solar system @xcite .",
    "a similar kuiper belt mass is also needed to drive neptune s orbital migration of @xmath21 au @xcite .",
    "however the current mass is @xmath34 m@xmath32 @xcite , so the kuiper belt appears to have been eroded by a factor of @xmath35 .",
    "this may be due to a dynamical erosion of the belt by neptune or possibly by other perturbers that may once have been roaming about the outer solar system , as well as due to the collisional erosion that has since ground all of the smaller kbos down to dust grains that are then removed from the solar system by radiation forces @xcite .",
    "the following will give results obtained from models of the secular evolution of the outer solar system for kuiper belts having masses in the interval @xmath36 m@xmath32 .",
    "section [ model ] derives the so  called rings model that will be used to study the secular evolution of disk  planet systems ; the reader uninterested in these details might skip ahead to section [ waves ] or [ results ] . since spiral density and bending waves appear prominently in the model results , their properties",
    "are examined in section [ waves ] .",
    "section [ results ] will describe the model s application to the primordial kuiper belt , and a summary of results is then given in section [ summary ] .",
    "the following shall treat the disk as a collection of nested gravitating rings in orbit about the sun .",
    "their mutual perturbations will cause these rings to slowly flex and tilt over time , and this evolution is governed by the lagrange planetary equations",
    ".      begin with the gravitational potential that a single perturbing ring of mass @xmath37 exerts at the point @xmath38 on another ring of mass @xmath39 : @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the gravitation constant , @xmath42 is the mass density of the differential volume element @xmath43 , @xmath44 is the separation between the perturbing mass element @xmath45 at @xmath46 and the field point @xmath38 , and the integration proceeds over the three dimensional extent of ring @xmath37 . in the following , primed quantities will refer to the perturbing ring @xmath37 and unprimed quantities will refer to the perturbed ring @xmath39 .",

    "so these n  body simulations can not be used as a quantitative benchmark for the rings code . nonetheless , it is comforting to find that the rings code does indeed reproduce the density patterns seen in the n  body disks that precess at rates very similar to that reported in @xcite .",
    "section [ results ] will use the preceding rings model to demonstrate that apsidal density waves and nodal bending waves may have once propagated throughout the kuiper belt .",

    "many of the waves properties , such as their wavelength and propagation speed , are readily extracted from the waves dispersion relations .",

    "the spiral wave will also organize the disk s longitude of periapse @xmath47 such that it varies as @xmath219 , where @xmath220 is the wavenumber and @xmath221 is the radial wavelength .",

    "thus we can set @xmath101 in equation ( [ i_wave1 ] ) except where it appears as the combination @xmath227 where @xmath228 . in this case",
    "the softened laplace coefficients that are present in the @xmath112 function can be replaced with the approximate forms that are valid for @xmath228 [ see equation ( [ b_local ] ) ] , so @xmath112 becomes @xmath229 it is also permitted to extend the lower integration limit in equation ( [ i_wave1 ] ) to @xmath230 in the tight  winding limit , so @xmath231 and finally , if the wave is to remain coherent across this disk , this self ",
    "precession must occur at the same constant rate @xmath232 throughout the disk , so @xmath233 .",

    "pulse has already propagated across the disk where it has reflected at the disk s outer edge and just started to return inwards as a long trailing bending wave .",
    "but when that pulse reaches the disk s inner edge , a portion of the wave s angular momentum content will continue to propagate further inwards where it will give a small kick to the giant planets orbit elements , while the remaining wave  pulse reflects again and propagates outwards .",

    "the disk s initial orbits are @xmath343 , except for the @xmath332 system which instead adopts the forced orbit elements appropriate for a massless disk [ e.g. , @xcite ] .",
    "these systems are evolved until their initial density and bending wave pulses have had the opportunity to reflect multiple times and have largely dissolved into standing wave patterns .",
    "the lower  mass disks necessarily have longer run ",
    "times due to their waves slower propagation speeds [ see equation ( [ density c_g ] ) ] ; these run ",
    "times are @xmath344 years , @xmath345 years , @xmath346 years , @xmath347 years , and @xmath348 years , respectively , for the @xmath337 , 0.2 , 2 , 10 , and 30 m@xmath32 systems .",
    "once the standing wave pattern has emerged , the rings instantaneous eccentricities and inclinations range over @xmath349 and @xmath350 .",
    "as figure [ compare_ei ] shows , there are no peaks in the @xmath335 and @xmath336 curves for the higher mass disks having @xmath351 m@xmath32 , indicating that there are no secular resonances in the disk itself ; any such resonances likely lie between the orbits of neptune and the disk s inner edge at 36 au .",
    "the simulations of these higher  mass disks show long trailing density waves and long leading bending waves being launched at the disk s inner edge .",
    "these waves sweep across the disk , reflect at the disk s outer edge , and return as short trailing density waves and long trailing bending waves , similar to the history described in section [ example ] and seen in figure [ m_kb=10 ] .",
    "however secular resonances at @xmath352 au are quite prominent in the lower  mass disks having @xmath337 and 0.2 m@xmath32 .",
    "these are sites that launch long density and bending waves , and as figure [ m_kb=10 ] shows , the density waves are able to propagate out as far as @xmath321 and 49 au , respectively , where they are reflected by a @xmath1barrier and return as short density waves .",
    "these reflection sites occur where @xmath353 and @xmath354 , which shows that equation ( [ hq ] ) is an approximate yet useful indicator of where apsidal wave are allowed to propagate .",
    "note also the large amplitudes of the density waves in these low  mass disks , @xmath355 , which clearly violates the model s assumption of low eccentricities . thus these particular curves should not be taken at face value .",
    "nonetheless , they do indicate that apsidal waves in a low  mass kuiper belt may result in large eccentricities , and figure [ m_kb=10 ] shows that sizable inclinations can also result due to nodal bending waves .",
    "indeed , in the @xmath337 m@xmath32 disk , maximum inclinations are typically @xmath29 , which is comparable to the main belt s high  inclination component .",
    "the larger @xmath7 s and @xmath8 s seen in the lower  mass disk s are a consequence of the giant planets transmitting a small fraction of their initial angular momentum deficit and @xmath179 of equations ( [ lei ] ) . ]",
    "( amd ) into the disk in each simulation . in each simulation , the giant planets deposit @xmath356 and @xmath357 into the disk s inner edge , which waves then transport and smear out across a vast swath of the kuiper belt .",
    "since the amd deposited in the disk is roughly constant in each simulation , the lower  mass disks exhibit larger @xmath7 and @xmath8 excitations .",
    "it should also be noted that computational limitations in dynamical studies of the kuiper belt , particularly n  body simulations , are often require treating the belt as a swarm of massless test particles . however",
    "the comparison of the @xmath332 curve to the @xmath358 curves in figure [ m_kb=10 ] shows that the endstate of a kuiper belt having even just a modest amount of mass can be radically different from one naively treated as massless .",

    "all of these disks have a normalized disk mass @xmath362 , a mean motion @xmath363 radians / year , and a pattern speed that is typically @xmath364 radians / year , so wave  action is shut off when the disk thickness @xmath83 exceeds @xmath365 . in the thinnest disk with @xmath339 ,",
    "the @xmath1barrier lies beyond the disk s outer edge at 70 au , so long and then short apsidal density waves are able to slosh about the disk s full extent . however the @xmath1barrier lies in the disk at @xmath366 au when @xmath367 ( red curve ) , at @xmath368 au when @xmath369 ( green curve ) , and apsidal waves are prohibited in the disks with @xmath370 ( blue and purple curves ) .",
    "figure [ m=10 ] also shows that the nodal bending waves are shut off when the disk thickness @xmath83 exceeds the somewhat more relaxed criterion @xmath371 . note also the peak at @xmath368 au in the @xmath367 disk ( red curve ) and at @xmath372 au in the @xmath369 disk ( green curve ) .",
    "these particular disks admit two spiral patterns , a higher  amplitude spiral that corotates with neptune s dominant eigenmode at the pattern speed of @xmath373 radians / year , and a lower  amplitude mode that corotates with uranus at the faster rate @xmath374 radians / year . since @xmath375 , the faster spiral pattern has @xmath376 , which is why this wave stalls at @xmath377 au in the @xmath378 disks while the slower spiral mode is able to propagate the full breadth of these disks .",
    "the behavior of a lower  mass disk with @xmath340 m@xmath32 is shown in figure [ m=0.2 ] for disks having @xmath379(0.0015 , 0.0037 , 0.0074 , 0.011 ) .",
    "a pair of secular resonances lie near @xmath380 au , and they launch apsidal and nodal waves having pattern speeds @xmath381 radians / year . these disks have @xmath382 and @xmath383 , and as the upper plot shows , further increases in @xmath83 brings the @xmath1barrier inwards until the wave  propagation zone has shrunk down to zero .",
    "the lower plot also shows that nodal waves forever slosh about the model kuiper belt in the @xmath341 disk ( orange curve ) , whereas the peaks in the other curves show that these waves stall at sites ever closer to resonance in progressively thicker disks .",
    "these figures also show that when @xmath384 , the motions of a non  gravitating disk are recovered , namely , the disk s @xmath7 s and @xmath8 s are twice the forced motions seen in the @xmath332 disk ( black curves ) , with the factor of two being a consequence of these disks initial conditions @xmath343 .",
    "the primordial kuiper belt likely had an initial mass of @xmath3 m@xmath32 ( see section [ introduction ] ) , and accretion models show that the initial kbo swarm must have had dispersion velocities less than @xmath385 keplerian @xcite , so @xmath386 , @xmath387 , and thus @xmath388 assuming the spiral waves have pattern speeds of @xmath389 radians / year . since @xmath262 , the primordial kuiper belt readily sustained apsidal and nodal waves . figure [ compare_ei ] shows that in this high  mass environment , these will be rather low ",
    "amplitude waves having @xmath2 .",
    "these waves will quickly propagate across a kuiper belt of width @xmath390 in time @xmath391 , so the wave propagation time is @xmath392 in the friction ",

    "long density waves eventually reflect , either at a @xmath1barrier in the disk ( which might lie downstream where @xmath393 ) or else at the disk s outer edge .",
    "the reflected waves then propagate inwards as short density waves , and such waves are nonlinear in the sense that their surface density variations @xmath316 typically exceed unity . figure [ m_kb=10 ] shows a snapshot of long and short density waves in a @xmath311 m@xmath32 disk .",
    "note that the long waves completely dominate the disk s orbit elements @xmath323 and @xmath324 that vary over a wavelength of @xmath394 au , while the short waves are the tiny variations in @xmath323 and @xmath324 that occur over a @xmath322 au scale at the disk s inner and outer edge .",
    "even though the short waves are almost imperceptible in the orbit  elements plots , the greyscale map shows that these nonlinear short waves completely dominate the disk s surface density structure .",
    "figure [ compare_ei ] also shows that the waves in lower  mass systems have higher amplitudes .",
    "this suggests that wave action may tend to drive disk ",
    "planet systems towards an equipartition of angular momentum deficits , since the angular momentum content of the waves seen in all simulations are @xmath395 and @xmath396 of the planets @xmath178 and @xmath179 .",
    "the large ",
    "amplitude waves seen in the @xmath340 m@xmath32 disk also suggests that apsidal and nodal wave action might account for much of the kuiper belt s excited state ( see figure [ compare_ei ] ) .",
    "however the viability of this scenario depends critically upon the timescales that govern the belt s mass loss as well as the kbos velocity evolution .",
    "first note that accretion models show that as soon as the large @xmath6 km kbos form , further kbo growth is halted as they initiate an episode of more vigorous collisions that steadily grind the belt s smaller members down to dust which radiation forces then transport away @xcite .",
    "accretion models show that the @xmath397 km kbos form at @xmath398 au over a @xmath399 year timescale , and that the belt s subsequent collisional erosion occurs over a @xmath400 year timescale @xcite . and",
    "if neptune s orbit had migrated substantially , the advancing 2:1 resonance would also have swept across the main belt , which further enhances the stirring as well the collisional / dynamical erosion .",
    "the resulting grinding and erosion thus makes it ever more difficult for the belt to sustain waves as the initially massive kuiper belt mass is eroded by a factor of @xmath35 , which also lowers the disk s @xmath401 .",
    "note that the removal of the smaller kbos also turns off the dynamical friction that was once keeping the particle disk quite thin .",
    "the gravitational stirring by the surviving larger kbos is then free to raise their dispersion velocities @xmath49 up to their surface escape velocity @xmath402 @xcite , which results in a thicker disk with @xmath403 where @xmath121 is the kbos characteristic size .",
    "since this is substantially larger than the current belt s @xmath261 , it seems quite likely that this stirring shut off the waves while they were still of low amplitude ( see fig .",
    "[ compare_ei ] ) long before the kuiper belt was ground down to its present mass . consequently , apsidal and nodal waves were likely able to propagate throughout the kuiper belt during a timescale @xmath404 that is bounded by the moment when the large kbos first formed and when the belt eroded away , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath405 .",
    "it should also be noted that this implementation of the rings model does not account for any viscous damping of spiral waves which , as @xcite point out , may be more important as bending waves approach a disk s outer edge . unlike the sharp  edged disks employed here , a more realistic disk likely has a ` fuzzy ' edge where the disk s surface density gently tapers to zero .",
    "@xcite show that bending waves entering such a lower  density zone tend to excite substantially larger inclinations there , and such sites will be considerably more susceptible to the viscous dissipation of these possibly nonlinear waves .",
    "@xcite suggests that disks having a tapered edge might also cause bending waves to stall there since the group velocity @xmath406 as the surface density @xmath407 smoothly goes to zero .",
    "however this assertion was not confirmed by the rings model , which tapered a disk s outer surface density by multiplying it by the factor @xmath408 where @xmath390 is the distance from the outer edge and @xmath63 is the tapering scale  length .",
    "these experiments adopt values of @xmath63 that are smaller , comparable , and larger than the bending wavelength @xmath260 , and in all cases the bending wave reflects at or near the disk edge , with considerably larger inclinations being excited in this tapered zone .",
    "a model that rapidly computes the secular evolution of a gravitating disk ",

    "there are two types of spiral density ( or apsidal ) waves , long waves of wavelength @xmath411 and short waves of wavelength @xmath412 where @xmath413 is the disk s fractional thickness and @xmath232 is the angular rate at which the spiral pattern rotates .",
    "the simulations presented here show that the giant planets launch long waves at either a resonance in the disk or else at the disk s nearest edge , and that these waves propagate away until they reflect at the disk s far edge or else at a @xmath1barrier in the disk which resides where @xmath414 where @xmath415 is the maximum disk thickness that can sustain apsidal waves , with @xmath416 being the normalized disk mass .",
    "of course all of these findings may be derived from the stellar dispersion relation given in @xcite in the limit that the pattern speed @xmath232 is much smaller than the disk s mean motion @xmath51 .",
    "nonetheless , it is satisfying to see that the theory of unforced apsidal waves is readily obtained from the lagrange planetary equations ; with a little more effort the theory for forced apsidal waves [ e.g. , @xcite ] should also be recoverable .",
    "however new results are obtained for the nodal wave problem , which admits only a long  wavelength solution @xmath260 to the planetary equations in the tight  winding limit . in particular",
    ", it is shown that these waves can stall , that is , the waves group velocity plummets to zero as they approach a site in the disk where @xmath417 . if , however , these waves instead encounter a disk edge , they will reflect and return as long waves . in the limit that @xmath287 , the results for nodal waves propagating in a infinitesimally thin disk is recovered @xcite , but note that the wave  stalling phenomenon does not appear in a @xmath118 treatment of the disk .",
    "the rings model is also used to examine the propagation of apsidal and nodal waves that are launched by the giant planets into a variety of kuiper belts having a mass @xmath418 m@xmath32 ( the estimated primordial mass ) down to @xmath337 m@xmath32 ( which is @xmath419 of the belts current mass estimate ) . in each simulation the giant planets deposit roughly the same fraction of their initial angular momentum deficits , @xmath395 and @xmath396 of the planets @xmath178 and @xmath179 , into the disk in the form of spiral waves . and",
    "since the waves angular momentum content is roughly the same in each simulation , the lower  mass kuiper belts thus experience higher  amplitude waves .",
    "indeed , the waves seen in the @xmath420 m@xmath32 simulations are of sufficient amplitude that they could in principle account for much of the dynamical excitation that is observed in the kuiper belt",
    ". however wave  action in a @xmath421 m@xmath32 belt also requires its fractional scale  height to quite thin , namely , @xmath422 .",
    "most likely , apsidal and nodal waves were shut off , due to self  stirring by large kbos as well as by other external perturbations , long before the belt eroded down to its current mass , in which case the excitation by wave  action would have been quite modest .",
    "the rings model developed here has many other applications .",
    "one issue of great interest is to determine whether apsidal and nodal waves may be propagating in saturn s rings .",
    "of particular interest are the short apsidal waves since their detection could yield the ring s dispersion velocity @xmath49 via a measurement of the short wavelength @xmath423 . although the ring particles dispersion velocity is of fundamental importance to ring dynamics , it is less than well constrained at saturn .",
    "of course , the differential precession due to planetary oblateness also needs to be included in the model [ c.f .",
    ", @xcite ] since this effect may actually defeat this form of wave  action .",
    "the rings model can also be used to examine the forced motions of a relatively massless but much thicker circumstellar dust disk like @xmath73 pictoris .",
    "the warps and brightness asymmetries seen in this system are usually attributed to secular perturbations exerted by an unseen planetary system , and the code developed here can be used to very rapidly explore the wide range of planetary parameters .",
    "this rings model will be used to study these and other problems in greater detail in the near future .",
