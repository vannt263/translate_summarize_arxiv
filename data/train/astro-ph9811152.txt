    "the possibility of photon splitting process in strong magnetic field around @xmath0  gauss has been first noted in the early seventies ( @xcite ) . adler ( 1971 )",
    "found that only one type of splitting is allowed , namely @xmath1 , where a perpendicularly polarized photon splits into two parallel polarized photons .",
    "this calculation took into account the vacuum dispersion and also the influence of matter with density that of a pulsar magnetosphere .",
    "the normal modes are polarized linearly in such conditions .",
    "the photon splitting absorption coefficient for this allowed reaction is @xmath2 since then a number of authors have derived the matrix elements , and absorption coefficients for this process using different approaches ( papanyan & ritus 1972 , stoneham 1979 ) and also recently ( baier , milshtein & shaisultanov 1996 , baring & harding 1997 ) .",
    "these papers have settled the controversy sparked by mentzel , berg & wunnner ( 1994 ) who suggested that the photon splitting rate may actually be a few orders of magnitude higher than previously thought .",
    "this exotic process has found a number of astrophysical applications . a natural environment where it may play a role",
    "is provided by neutron stars , since a number of them have magnetic fields in excess of @xmath3  gauss , and about a dozen of radio pulsars has spin down fields larger than @xmath4  gauss . it has been found that photon splitting plays an important role in the formation of the gamma ray spectrum of psr  1509 - 58 , where it inhibits emission above 1  mev ( @xcite ) .",
    "soft gamma - ray repeaters ( sgr ) form another class of objects where photon splitting has been suggested to play an important role .",
    "there were three firmly established sgr s with and the fourth source was recently discovered ( @xcite ) .",
    "all of them are characterized by short durations , below a second , and spectra with cut - offs around @xmath5  kev .",
    "a number of arguments have been presented ( @xcite ) pointing that these sources are actually _ magnetars _ , i.e. neutron stars with magnetic fields reaching @xmath6  gauss , for which the main pool of energy is the magnetic field . baring ( 1995 ) suggested that photon splitting may be responsible for the spectral cutoffs in the spectra of sgrs , invoking a possibility of photon splitting cascades .",
    "thompson and duncan ( 1995 ) showed that even in the absence of cascades photon splitting influences the shape of the spectra of sgrs .    in this work",
    "we investigate the process of photon splitting not only in vacuum but also in the presence of matter with the density like that in a neutron star atmosphere , when the plasma dispersion may be important and for some range of propagation directions the normal modes are polarized circularly .",
    "the relevance of plasma effects can have a very substantial influence on the absorption coefficients .",
    "for example , bulik and miller ( 1997 ) have shown that plasma effects leads to a broad absorption like feature below @xmath7  kev for a large range of sgr emission models . in section 2",
    "we analyze the polarization of the normal modes in the strongly magnetized plasma , in section 3 we calculate the photon splitting matrix elements and absorption coefficients , in section 4 we present the results and we discuss them in section 5 .",

    "we find that @xmath113 vanishes while @xmath114 and @xmath115 for all other transitions .    in the presence of matter",
    "the functions @xmath116 and @xmath111 no longer vanish .",
    "this is due to the fact that , in general , the refraction coefficients differ from unity , polarization vectors are elliptical rather than linear , photons in the process are not exactly collinear , and there exists a small degree of longitudinal polarization .",
    "the polarization related effects are the strongest for high matter density and propagation direction along the field .",
    "the kinematic selection rules arise from the fact that for some transitions the the energy conservation can not be satisfied .",
    "the kinematic selection rules can be discussed analytically using the dispersion relation @xmath117 .",
    "we note that the refraction coefficient is very close to unity , see figures  [ n - of - b ] and [ n - of - om ] , and therefore for a given @xmath10 and one can invert the dispersion relation to obtain @xmath118 we note that for the fixed initial photon the function @xmath119 is monotonically decreasing with @xmath120- the cosine of the angle between the initial and one of the final photons .",
    "thus , it suffices to verify that equation @xmath121 has no solution for the collinear photons , to be sure that there are no solutions for non - collinear photons . using momentum conservation and equation  ( [ om - of - k ] ) ,",
    "one obtains for the collinear photons : @xmath122 the condition for the kinematic selection rules to be satisfied is @xmath123 .    in vacuum in the limit @xmath124",
    "the refraction coefficients are functions of the magnetic field and the dependence on photon energy @xmath125 is weak , see figure  [ n - of - om ] . in this case condition ( [ f - check ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath126 , where @xmath34 is a number between @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",
    "it is clear , that transitions @xmath129 and @xmath130 are not allowed .",
    "since in the first order in @xmath131 the functions @xmath132 increase as a function of @xmath125 transitions @xmath133 and @xmath134 are also forbidden .",
    "thus in vacuum only two transitions are kinematically allowed : @xmath135 and @xmath136 .    combining the polarization selection rules and the kinematic selection rules we conclude , in agreement with adler , that only the transition @xmath136 is allowed vacuum",
    ".    in the presence of matter the discussion of kinematic selection rules becomes more complicated since the refraction indices as a function of energy are rather complicated functions .",
    "the kinematic selection rules become complicated when the field is strong enough so that the electron cyclotron resonance influences refraction significantly . around the resonance refraction coefficients",
    "are non monotonic functions of energy . in this case",
    "there may be a fraction of final state space that becomes kinematically allowed because of the influence of plasma on refraction coefficients .",
    "in the case of propagation in vacuum we ignore dispersion and calculate the integral of equation  ( [ int - general ] ) @xmath137 due to the selection rules discussed above the only non - vanishing photon splitting absorption coefficients is @xmath138 in full agreement with the result obtained by adler ( 1971 ) .",
    "in general , when the polarization modes are not linear and we take into account the dispersion relation equation  ( [ int - general ] ) can be written as @xmath139 where we wrote explicitly the variables in the system u and @xmath125-s are function of @xmath140 and @xmath10 .",
    "defining @xmath141 , we can integrate over @xmath142 and obtain @xmath143 which can be evaluated numerically .",
    "the integrand in equation  ( [ int - final ] ) is understood to vanish whenever there is no solution of equation @xmath121 .",
    "we evaluate equation  ( [ int - final ] ) numerically to obtain the photon splitting absorption coefficient for different polarization channels , and various photon energies , magnetic fields and plasma densities . in the calculation we use the refraction indices of equation  ( [ disp - root ] ) , the polarization vectors given by equation  ( [ vectors ] ) , and calculate the matrix element using equation  ( [ m - element ] ) . at each integration point",
    "we evaluate the function @xmath144 and find whether the energy conservation is satisfied .",
    "we present the results in figures [ rhob1 ] , [ rhob2 ] , [ omb1 ] , and [ omb2 ] .",
    "each figure consists of four panels which show the splitting rates for four angles of propagation with respect to the magnetic field : @xmath145 , @xmath146 , @xmath147 , and @xmath148 .",
    "figures [ rhob1 ] , [ rhob2 ] show the splitting absorption coefficient as a function of matter density of a photon with the energy @xmath149 ; figure [ rhob1 ] for the case @xmath150 and figure [ rhob2 ] for the case @xmath151 .",
    "we present photon splitting absorption coefficients as functions of energy when the plasma density is @xmath152 g  @xmath153 in for @xmath150 in figure [ omb1 ] , and for @xmath150 in figure [ omb2 ] .",
    "we show the photon splitting absorption coeficients for the energies below @xmath154 since above this energy the opacity is dominated by the single photon pair production .",
    "we first consider the effects of matter density on the photon splitting rates . at low densities",
    "the influence of matter is negligible , and we recover the vacuum case when all the polarization vectors are linear , and the kinematic selection rules are determined by the magnetic vacuum refraction . with the increase of density polarization of the normal modes becomes elliptical starting at the photons propagating near to the direction of the field . at small angles this",
    "effects are pronounced already at the density of @xmath155 g  @xmath153 . however comparing figures 4 and 5 we see that the dominant effect is due to the kinematic selection rules and the influence of the electron cyclotron resonance is crucial .",
    "this is also clearly seen in figure 6 , where a number of splitting channels that are forbidden in vacuum suddenly turns on for energies above the cyclotron resonance .    at a low value of the magnetic field",
    "the process rapidly becomes unimportant , since the rate scales @xmath156 . with the increasing value of the magnetic field",
    "the plasma effects start to be important when the electron cyclotron resonance falls right around the electron mass , i.e. the field has a value close to the critical field . in these case",
    "when the matter is sufficiently dense the effects of the electron cyclotron resonance influence the kinematic selection rules significantly thus allowing more photon splitting polarization channels .",
    "when the value of the magnetic field is higher than @xmath157 the electron cyclotron resonance falls above region of integration over the final states and the does not influence the splitting rate .",
    "moreover with the increasing magnetic field refraction becomes dominated by the vacuum terms , and the effects of plasma become less and less important .",
    "figures [ omb1 ] and [ omb2 ] show the effects of photon energy on the splitting absorption coefficient . when the electron cyclotron resonance effects are ignored only small frequencies and small angles of propagation are influenced , since it is there where the refraction coefficients and the polarization of the normal modes are the most influenced by plasma .",
    "however this is also the region where the photon splitting coefficient is the smallest , see equation  ( [ adler ] ) .",
    "in this work we extend the results of adler ( 1971 ) to the case of propagation in the magnetized plasma and concentrate on the case of the density typical for a neutron star atmosphere .",
    "our approach is accurate for the magnetic fields up to approximately the critical field since we use a low field approximation in the calculation of the matrix element .",
    "we calculate the refraction coefficients accurately and thus the kinematic selection rules do not suffer from this limitation .",
    "we have calculated the photon splitting absorption coefficient as a function of magnetic field , plasma density , and the photon energy and direction .",
    "we have found a region of the parameter space ( density @xmath158 g  @xmath153 , the magnetic field @xmath159 , propagation angles @xmath160 ) where the effects of plasma are the most pronounced .",
    "a part of these region is where the photon splitting absorption is small , so the region of importance is limited to photon energies above @xmath161 .",
    "we find that the the photon splitting rate is well described by the vacuum approximation in the remaining part of the parameter space .",
    "photon splitting absorption coefficient is small when compared to other processes that may play a role in plasma , for example the electron scattering opacity is @xmath162 g  @xmath163@xmath164 for the extraordinary mode , a value a few orders of magnitude higher than that for photon splitting .",
    "thus photon splitting can play a significant role only in very special astrophysical cases .",
    "an example of such environment could be in deep layers of a neutron star atmosphere .",
    "therefore the results presented here may apply to soft gamma - ray repeaters , where a large amount of energy is deposited in the crust of a neutron star .",
    "photon splitting in a high density plasma may be a way of producing a large number of soft x - ray photons which later on escape .",
    "our results can also be applied to the high energy radiation from isolated neutron stars provided that we see radiation from the surface and not the magnetopshere",
    ". however , the main conclusion is that surprisingly the effects due to the presence of plasma are important in a rather small fraction of the parameter space and the vacuum approximation can be used in most calculations .    acknowledgements .",
