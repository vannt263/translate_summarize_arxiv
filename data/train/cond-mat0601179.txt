    "a variety of mechanisms have been proposed to describe the separation of particles of two sizes in a mixture of vertically shaken particles .",
    "section ii discusses proposed mechanisms , including void filling , static compressive force , convection , condensation , thermal diffusion , non - equipartition of energy , interstitial gas forcing , friction , and buoyancy .",
    "our aim is to determine which are the important segregation mechanisms for diverse conditions .",
    "we study a mixture of two sizes of brass spheres , using image analysis to count the number of large particles visible at the top and bottom surfaces of the sample after shaking .",
    "these results are then compared with molecular dynamics simulations , which yield quantities unaccessible in experiment .",
    "comparing our results for a range of control parameters with various proposed segregation mechanisms reveals which mechanisms are important in our system .",
    "the control parameters studied are : frequency @xmath0 and amplitude @xmath1 of the sinusoidal shaking , the diameter ratio of the spheres @xmath2 ( the subscripts l and s refer to large and small particles ) , the total layer depth @xmath3 , and @xmath4 , the ratio of the total volume of large to small particles in the container .",
    "the last parameter has not been examined in previous experiments , which were either performed with about equal numbers of particles of each size @xcite , or in the case called the intruder limit , where there is one large sphere in a bed of smaller particles @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : different proposed segregation mechanisms are reviewed in sec .",
    "[ sec : mechanism ] .",
    "section [ sec : theory ] discusses the interplay of these mechanisms in two recent models @xcite .",

    "section [ sec : results_1 ] discusses how the experimental and simulation results depend on the driving parameters , and sec .",

    "we conclude in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "to reduce the number of segregation mechanisms to be considered we use large and small particles of the same material ( brass ) and therefore the same density and mechanical properties .",
    "this excludes segregation effects due to archimedean buoyancy @xcite or due to different frictional properties @xcite .",
    "as the interstitial fluid was also found to have a strong effect on segregation @xcite , we reduced the pressure in our experiment to less than 8 pa , well below the 130 pa where the effect of air on the segregation vanishes @xcite .",
    "this step also assures comparability with our molecular dynamics simulations where the only interactions between particles are collisions .",
    "the remaining seven mechanisms are reviewed below , and their predicted dependence on @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath3 is summarized in table [ tab : mechanism ] . for a recent review see also @xcite .",
    "[ sec : dynamic_tensile ] void filling is a local geometric effect that was first clearly identified in monte carlo simulations @xcite . during the expansion phase of the shaking cycle all particles move upwards , but during the compaction phase a large particle has a smaller probability of finding a suitable void in the layer below it than a small particle .",
    "this leads to the large particles accumulating at the top of the sample .",
    "as pointed out in @xcite , void filling works only for weak excitation ; for strong driving the voids become larger and the probability that they accommodate a large particle becomes similar to that of a small particle . the void filling effect becomes stronger with increasing diameter ratio @xmath5 , as shown by the increase in the rise velocity of an intruder @xcite . for @xmath7",
    "the intruder seems to undergo a transition from intermittent to continuous ascent , which indicates a change in the microscopic details of the mechanism @xcite . comparing in a thought experiment the situation of a single large intruder in a bed of small particles with a mixture which contains predominantly large particle hints that increasing @xmath6 will decrease the strength of void filling .",
    "in contrast , the overall layer height @xmath3 should not influence this mechanism .",
    "there exists no theoretical model for void filling , but trujillo _ et al . _",
    "@xcite identify in their kinetic theory based analysis of the gravitational force a `` dynamic tensile '' force ; for an intruder this upward force increases with @xmath8 .",
    "this term vanishes in the limit of a highly expanded mixture .",
    "they compare the dynamic tensile force with the void filling mechanism .",
    "trujillo _ et al . _",
    "@xcite find that in the presence of gravity , any size disparity will give rise to another term , which they name static compressive force .",
    "the static compressive force will always lead to the rbne ; in the intruder limit it is proportional to @xmath9 .",
    "friction at the container walls can induce convection rolls in vertically shaken mixtures : during the upward acceleration the mixture gets compacted and shear forces induced by the side walls extend through the whole sample . during the subsequent downward motion the mixture is more expanded and consequentially those particles adjacent to the walls experience stronger shear forces than those in the center of the container .",
    "both phases combined give rise to a convection roll going downwards at the sidewalls and upwards in the center .",
    "the relevant geometrical control parameter seems to be the ratio of the size of the downstream layer to the diameter of the large particles . if the large particles are too large to be entrained by the downstream , they become trapped at the top surface and consequently convection leads to bne @xcite . however , if the size of the downward moving regions is big enough to accommodate large particles , these particles perform convective cycles @xcite , which can lead to mixing @xcite .",
    "magnetic resonance imaging indicates that the size of the downward moving layer is independent of total layer depth and shaking acceleration @xcite .",
    "however , increasing @xmath3 might reduce the efficiency of both mechanisms as the strength of the convection roll vanishes at the bottom @xcite . increasing the ratio of large to small particles @xmath6 in a gedanken - experiment",
    "@xcite increases the size of the downstream layer and therefore suppresses the bne and fosters mixing .      for driven granular media",
    "one can define a kinetic granular temperature @xmath10 which corresponds to the average kinetic energy of the random motion of the particles @xcite , @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the particle mass and @xmath13 their velocity .",
    "numerical studies @xcite and experiments @xcite have shown that @xmath10 in a vertically shaken granular sample depends not only on the position in the sample and the phase of the shaking cycle , but also on the shaking acceleration and the number of particles in the container .    in binary granular mixtures",
    "the equipartition of energy breaks down @xcite ; in general the heavier particles have a higher granular temperature than the lighter ones .",
    "non - equipartition increases with decreasing restitution coefficient and increasing mass difference @xcite .",
    "two different types of segregation mechanisms driven by the granular temperature of the sample have been suggested , based either on a phenomenological model of solid - liquid phase transitions @xcite or on analyzing momentum balance equations derived from kinetic theory @xcite .      a mechanism suggested by hong _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite is based on the observation that as the shaking acceleration is increased , a solid - like sample of _ monodisperse _ particles will become vibro - fluidized .",
    "assuming that the granular temperature is spatially homogeneous throughout the sample , they postulate the existence of a critical temperature @xmath14 above which all particles are fluidized .",
    "for @xmath10 smaller than @xmath14 an increasing fraction of the particles should condense at the bottom of the container . by equating the average kinetic energy of the particles with the potential energy of a particle in the top layer , they find @xmath14 to be proportional to @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the material density and @xmath17 is the height of the particular layer .",
    "hong _ et al . _",
    "@xcite argued that in a _",
    "binary _ sample the shaking parameters can be adjusted such that @xmath10 is between the critical temperatures of the two species .",
    "then one kind stays fluidized while the other condenses at the bottom .",
    "assuming equipartition and that the values of @xmath14 are not influenced by the presence of the other species , they identify the ratio of the two @xmath14 s as the control parameter @xmath18 , @xmath19 where the height ratio @xmath20 of the particles filled in separately is equal to @xmath4 in a container of constant width .    for @xmath21 , which corresponds to @xmath22 ,",
    "the small particles are still condensed and sink to the bottom while the large particles are completely fluidized ; the system shows bne . for @xmath23 the large particles will condense at the bottom and the rbne takes place .",
    "however , these effects will only occur in an intermediate driving regime where @xmath10 is in between the two critical temperatures ; otherwise there will be no segregation as a result of condensation .",
    "kinetic theory of binary granular mixtures is an active area of research with competing predictions .",
    "as kinetic theory is limited to a regime where binary collisions prevail , these mechanisms are only applicable for dilute mixtures and hence large shaking amplitudes .",
    "* diffusion in a granular temperature gradient*. it was first shown by hsiau and hunt @xcite that in a gradient of the granular temperature the heavier particles move to places with lower @xmath10 and thereby expel the lighter particles .",
    "strong vertical temperature gradients in vertically shaken samples have been found in simulation @xcite and experiment @xcite . due to the complicated spatio - temporal development of the @xmath10 field , it is not possible to decide a priori what type of segregation this effect will lead .",
    "* segregation due to non - equipartition*. the derivation in @xcite assumes equipartition .",
    "recent simulations by galvin _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite have shown that non - equipartition leads to additional driving forces that are comparable in strength to the forces in the calculations assuming equipartition .",
    "an explicit solution for the thermal diffusion coefficients in the case of a single intruder and non - equipartition was given by brey _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , who found the ratio of mean square velocities , @xmath24 to be the control parameter . for particles with same density ,",
    "they predict @xmath25 , which leads to rbne ; @xmath26 decreases with increasing diameter ratio .",
    "trujillo _ et al . _",
    "@xcite identify in their hydrodynamic model a so - called pseudo - thermal buoyancy force , which is proportional to the ratio of the granular temperatures of the two species .",
    "they calculate this temperature ratio using the kinetic theory results of barrat and trizac @xcite , where @xmath27 is always larger than @xmath28 so that the pseudo - thermal buoyancy leads to bne .",

    "the symbols + , 0 , and - correspond to an increase , constance or decrease of the effect in the second column .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     despite these caveats fig .",
    "[ fig : dr_md ] shows that the bne for a diameter ratio of 3 is due to an increase in convection .",
    "this effect can also be seen in the average particle velocity measured at the sidewall of the container in fig .",
    "[ fig : dr_conv ] . at small shaking amplitudes",
    "the convection is again negligible as in fig .",
    "[ fig : conv_1 ] . for @xmath30",
    "the difference in the downward velocity for small and large particles increases significantly with the diameter ratio .",
    "[ t ]    aside from the effect of convection , the main result in fig .",
    "[ fig : dr_md ] is that the slight rbne in strongly shaken mixtures is relatively independent of the diameter ratio .",
    "yet non - equipartition increases by a factor of six for the diameter ratios studied , as shown in table [ tab : temp_ratio ] , which also shows that @xmath31 is in good agreement with the kinetic theory based predictions of barrat and trizac @xcite .    together",
    "this relative independence of @xmath32 on @xmath33 and the strong dependence of @xmath31 on @xmath33 indicates that non - equipartition has only a weak influence on our results .",
    "this is in contrast to the predictions of trujillo _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , who expect the static compressive force which leads to rbne to be dominant at small diameter ratios . however , non - equipartition grows faster with increasing diameter ratio than the static compressive force , so the system should show a crossover to bne .    for the reasons given above , we were unable to gather meaningful statistics for simulations of a single intruder in a container with periodic boundaries .",
    "therefore , we can not comment on the predictions of brey _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , who found for an intruder that non - equipartition leads to a rbne that increases in strength with increasing diameter ratio .",
    "[ t ]    [ sec : height_ratio ] the dependence of the segregation results on the composition of the sample measured as the ratio between the volumes of the large and small particle @xmath6 is shown in fig .  [ fig:2ml ] . for each volume ratio the same behavior as in fig .",
    "[ fig : amplitude ] can be observed : the probability @xmath32 of a large particle to be at the top of the sample decreases with increasing @xmath1 . for volume ratios in the range from a single intruder up to 20% large particles , @xmath32 depends only weakly on @xmath6 .    at higher volume ratios",
    ", @xmath32 shows a trend from bne towards a mixed state with increasing @xmath6 .",
    "this effect is in agreement with the suggested segregation mechanism : at @xmath0 = 15 hz the size of the convective downstream layer increases and more large particles can get entrained @xcite , while at @xmath0 = 80 hz an increase of @xmath6 results in larger voids in the sample and therefore the void - filling mechanism becomes less effective .",
    "a comparison of the two frequencies shows that convection is more impaired by an increase in @xmath35 than void filling .",
    "an increasing rbne with increasing diameter ratio was not found for any of the combinations of volume ratios and driving parameters in fig .",
    "[ fig:2ml ] .",
    "therefore , a static compressive force is not needed to explain our results .",
    "figure [ fig:2ml ] provides another test of the theory of hong _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite . according to eq .",
    "[ eq : hql_1 ] the condensation mechanism leading to rbne will become stronger than the void filling mechanism for volume ratios larger than 1 . the right - most points in fig .",
    "[ fig:2ml ] have @xmath35 = 1.5 ; therefore , we should see here at some intermediate driving regime a clear drop of from a bne to rbne and back to bne for a further increase in @xmath1 .",
    "while no condensation was found at an intermediate driving range , this leaves open the possibility of condensation at even smaller driving amplitudes .",
    "_ consider a particle as being fluidized if it has the ability to exchange its position with its neighbors .",
    "therefore , the mean square displacement of particles in a condensed phase should show a plateau at a small distance .",
    "figure [ fig : msd ] shows the development of the mean square displacement of large and small particles in simulations with periodic boundary conditions . only at a frequency of 80 hz and an amplitude of 0.07 @xmath36 ( which pushes the limits of our simulation technique as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : comparison ] ) do the large particles seem to be caged by their neighbors , while the small particles are still mobile . according to the condensation mechanism , this should result in a rbne .",
    "however , in experiment we find a clear bne with @xmath32 = 0.67 ( at a @xmath6 of 1.5 ) .",
    "this steady state is reached after approximately 20 minutes ( corresponding to @xmath37 shaking cycles ) and therefore unlikely to be found in simulations .",
    "similar experiments at @xmath0 = 15 hz and shaking amplitudes down to 0.61 @xmath36 do not yield any signature of the condensation mechanism .",
    "the dependence of the segregation on the layer depth @xmath3 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:4ml ] .",
    "for a diameter ratio of 1.5 the number of large particles at the top is mostly independent of @xmath3 while the number at the bottom drops significantly with increasing @xmath3 . at a diameter ratio of 3",
    "there is a slight increase of the number at the top while the number at the bottom stays relatively constant at low levels .",
    "the absence of the rbne in deeper layers was also noted by breu _",
    "et al . _",
    "it is compatible with thermal diffusion as the responsible mechanism for the rbne in shallow layers , assuming that the relative height of the temperature minimum stays constant when @xmath3 is increased .",
    "then in deeper samples the accumulation of large particles would no longer be visible at the bottom .",
    "the condensation mechanism does not explain the vanishing of the rbne in deeper layers as the condensed fraction of large particles is assumed to accumulate at the bottom independent of @xmath3 . at a diameter ratio of 3 , void filling and convection are much stronger contributions to the final result ; therefore , the relative influence of @xmath38 is smaller .",
    "note that the transition from two to four layers increases the relaxation times .",
    "though we increased the initial shaking time from 1 to 3 minutes , experiments with @xmath0 = 80 hz , @xmath1 = 0.13 @xmath36 still had not reached their steady state and were therefore not included .",
    "we have studied the segregation of vertically shaken binary mixtures of brass spheres in experiment and event - driven simulation . by using the same material for small and large particles and evacuating the sample container , we eliminated archimedean buoyancy , friction , and pressure effects from the list of potential segregation mechanisms .",
    "we have found that three mechanisms are sufficient to explain our results :    \\(1 ) at a shaking frequency of 80 hz all samples exhibited a strong _ brazil nut effect _ due to the geometrical mechanism called * void filling*. the strength of the segregation increases with diameter ratio and decreases weakly with the shaking amplitude . increasing the number of large particles from a single intruder up to a mixture of equal volumes of large and small particles results only in a slight decrease of the strength of the effect .",
    "\\(2 ) at a shaking frequency of 15 hz and shaking amplitudes up to 1.5 large particle diameters , a strong _ brazil nut effect _ is induced by * side wall driven convection*. the strength of the effect increases strongly with diameter ratio and decreases with the relative amount of large particles .",
    "\\(3 ) if the shaking amplitude is increased above 1.5 large particle diameters , the sample starts to resemble a granular gas and the * thermal diffusion * mechanism becomes significant .",
    "thermal diffusion describes the tendency of large particles to accumulate in the minimum of the granular temperature profile . in a shallow layer of height two large particle diameters and for diameter ratios",
    "smaller than three , thermal diffusion eventually becomes stronger than convection , which leads to the _ reverse brazil nut effect_. thermal diffusion seems to be only weakly dependent on the diameter ratio . if the total layer height is increased to four large particle diameters , the temperature minimum is within the sample and no increased number of large particles at the bottom is observed .",
    "while we probed the parameter regimes where the * static compressive force * and the * condensation * mechanisms were expected to be relevant , we did not find any signature of these two segregation mechanisms .",
    "the apparent agreement between the condensation - based model in @xcite and the experimental phase diagram separating bne and rbne in @xcite can be explained by the fact that they changed both frequency and amplitude of the driving deliberately .",
    "then both bne and rbne can occur in the same sample , as shown above and also in @xcite .",
    "we also find * non - equipartition * to have no discernible influence on our results .",
    "however , this might be due to either the relatively high coefficient of restitution ( 0.7 ) or to the fact that we are not shaking vigorously enough for those effects to be observed .    the theories presented in @xcite lack two of the important mechanisms ( convection , thermal diffusion ) and at the same time they include mechanisms which are not relevant ( static compressive force , non - equipartition , condensation ) ; hence these theories can not explain our experimental and numerical results .    in the limit of strong shaking ,",
    "we believe that kinetic theory - based approaches have the potential to explain segregation , though the inclusion of convection might prove daunting . a good starting point for",
    "a microscopic theory of void filling might be the  random fluctuating sieve ",
    "theory of inclined chute flow @xcite , as pointed out in @xcite .",
