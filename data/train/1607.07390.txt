    "<S> we study an extension of qed involving a light pseudoscalar ( an axion - like particle ) , together with a very massive fermion which has lorentz - violating interactions with the photon and the pseudoscalar , including a nonminimal lorentz - violating coupling . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the low energy effective action for this model , after integration over the fermion field , and show that interesting results are obtained , such as the generation of a correction to the standard coupling between the axion - like particle and the photon , as well as lorentz - violating effects in the interaction energy involving electromagnetic sources such as pointlike charges , steady line currents and dirac strings .    the standard - model extension ( sme ) </S>",
    "<S> can be understood as an effective field theory derived from a more fundamental theory that lives in some high energy scale , presumably the planck energy @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , it is a natural expectation that the sme should contain minimal ( renormalizable ) lorentz - violating ( lv ) operators , as well as an infinite number of nonminimal , higher derivative , nonminimal operators . on dimensional grounds , </S>",
    "<S> the latter are expected to be suppressed by inverse powers of the high energy scale @xmath0 , so they should not be the most relevant at low energy . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , until recently , most investigations were restricted to the set of minimal lv operators due to these general expectations , apart from the obvious fact that this restriction reduces the infinite set of nonminimal lv operators to a still large but finite set of operators . </S>",
    "<S> this approach proved itself very fruitful , yielding an impressive set of constraints on lv from a wide variety of experiments and observations.@xcite    a natural question is therefore whether nonminimal lv operators@xcite could induce observable effects in low energy physics . </S>",
    "<S> finding specific instances of low energy phenomenology where a nonminimal lv operator could give a contribution not obscured by another minimal lv operator would be particularly interesting . in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> , we studied a particular model that realizes this scenario , where the presence of a very massive fermion field , with specific lv interactions , induces at low energy a correction to the very same coupling between light pseudoscalars and photons that is subject to several experimental investigations . </S>",
    "<S> the qcd axion@xcite is a specific example of this class of light pseudoscalars , but our discussion is valid for general axion - like particles ( alps).@xcite    an alp is represented in qft by a pseudoscalar field @xmath1 and couples to the photon via the interaction @xmath2 which allows for searches for alps in low energy photons experiments . to obtain an lv correction to eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq:1 ] ) , we postulated the existence of a very massive fermion field @xmath3 that couples both to the photon and to the alp , @xmath4\\psi\\,,\\label{eq:2}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 denote the standard free lagrangians for the photon , the alp , and the fermion field , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we notice in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq:2 ] ) the presence of a minimal lv coupling @xmath8 , as well as a non minimal one , @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> integration of the fermion field yields a low energy effective lagrangian which contains the term @xmath10 the coefficient @xmath11 is finite , but regularization dependent . </S>",
    "<S> the feynman integrals contributing to eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq:3 ] ) are actually the same studied some years ago regarding the perturbative generation of the cfj lagrangian.@xcite from the experimental viewpoint , this result means that the alp - photon interaction measured by experimentalist could contain a hidden lv contribution , arising from the specific setting of high energy lv studied by us .    </S>",
    "<S> motivated by these results , we also calculated the complete correction induced in the low energy photon sector of our model , due to the presence of the massive fermion . </S>",
    "<S> disregarding the presence of the pseudocscalar @xmath1 in eq .  </S>",

    "<S> it is evident that the right - hand side of eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : me1 ] ) and ( [ eq : me2 ] ) vanish for the standard maxwell theory . in our case , these terms are not zero ; however they are of second order in @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath9 , so in this approximation we have the surprising result that the lv completely decouples from wave propagation .    </S>",
    "<S> nontrivial lv effects can , however , be found in the interaction between electromagnetic sources . </S>",
    "<S> we singled out from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : seffpronta ] ) one specific lv operator , which allows us to calculate exactly the classical electromagnetic interaction between sources . </S>",
    "<S> the specific lagrangian we considered was @xmath27 by fixing the coulomb gauge and finding the exact photon propagator @xmath28 , we can calculate the interaction energy between different sources , @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the time variable , and the limit @xmath31 is implicit . in ref .   </S>",
    "<S> we considered several situations involving pointlike charges , steady line currents and dirac strings , obtaining new effects arising from the lv . </S>",
    "<S> as an example , a dipole would experience a spontaneous torque depending on the angle between the dipole and the space component of the background vector @xmath9 . these are effects that could possibly lead to experimental signals involving the nonminimal lv coupling @xmath9 . </S>"
