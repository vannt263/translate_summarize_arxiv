    "as is well known , supersymmetric quantum mechanics ( susy qm ) is one of simplest techniques for generating new exactly solvable potentials departing from a given initial one @xcite . in general",
    ", the spectrum of the built hamiltonian differs from the initial one in a finite number of levels . in the past",
    "this procedure has been applied mainly to hermitian hamiltonians , in order to generate either real or complex new potentials @xcite , with an associated spectrum which in the last case could contain a finite number of complex energy levels additional to the initial eigenvalues .",
    "the method has been used also for non - hermitian hamiltonians with the so - called pt - symmetry @xcite .",
    "indeed , in the context of optics it is possible to find families of complex potentials with entirely real spectra with a missing single level , the one associated to an arbitrary initial mode @xcite .",
    "however , up to our knowledge there are not many works employing hamiltonians with purely complex eigenvalues .",
    "+ our aim in this work is to address this subject . in order to do that",
    ", we will take as initial system the so - called complex oscillator @xcite , which has the form of the harmonic oscillator potential but with a frequency @xmath0 which is allowed now to be complex .",
    "we are going to show that some particularly interesting first - order susy transformations , which in the real case would introduce singularities in the generated potential , here will be non - singular and they will generate gaps in the equidistant spectrum of the complex oscillator .",
    "+ let us recall that the susy partners of the harmonic oscillator potential supply explicit realizations of the even - order polynomial heisenberg algebras ( pha ) @xcite . moreover , there are subsets of this general family of susy partner potentials which are ruled simultaneously by second - order pha . as the last are directly linked with the painlev iv ( piv ) equation , then a simple technique is available for generating solutions to this equation departing from the extremal states of the hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "in fact , plenty of real as well as complex solutions associated with real piv parameters have been generated @xcite .",
    "in addition , several complex solutions for complex piv parameters have been built up @xcite , all of them departing from the harmonic oscillator potential , which is real ( for a review see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , since the complex oscillator can be mapped into the harmonic oscillator , thus we can generate complex solutions to the piv equation directly by applying first - order supersymmetric transformations to the complex oscillator , and some special higher - order ones .",
    "+ this paper is organized as follows . in section [ * * sec-2 ] we will sketch the susy qm . then , in section [ * * sec-3 ] we will discuss the pha , with special emphasis placed in those of second - order , which have a direct link with the piv equation . in section [ * *",
    "sec-4 ] we will generate the susy partners of the complex oscillator , while in section [ * * sec-5 ] we will study the corresponding solutions to the piv equation .",

    "it is not clear the way we have to move on the complex energy plane in order to obtain a natural classification of the complex susy transformations , the associated potentials and the corresponding solutions to the piv equation .",
    "in addition , this time we did not obtain any heuristic criterion to link the number of zeros of the piv solution with the order of the susy transformation .",
