    "the structure of the @xmath0 interaction at low energies is strongly constrained by the fact that the pion is the goldstone boson of a spontaneously broken approximate symmetry of qcd.@xcite the scattering amplitude can be calculated in a systematic way in the framework of chiral perturbation theory ( chpt),@xcite by an expansion which converges very rapidly near the center of the mandelstam triangle . however , the convergence becomes slow as one approaches the unitarity cuts , and already at threshold the direct application of chiral expansions is not satisfactory .",
    "the dispersion relations determine the structure of the amplitude in terms of physical region absorptive parts and two subtraction constants , which can be identified with the s - wave scattering lengths , @xmath1 and @xmath2 . by projecting the fixed-@xmath3 dispersion relations onto partial waves and using unitarity , one obtains a set of integral equations for the phase shifts , the roy equations.@xcite    in the early applications of roy equations the subtraction constants were taken from experiment , and had large uncertainties .",
    "an important step forward was to determine them theoretically , by combining chpt inside the convergence region with dispersion relations , which led to a very precise theoretical prediction:@xcite @xmath4 this range is represented by the small red region in fig .",
    "1 , where the black lines define the universal band@xcite imposed by roy equations , the points are the chpt calculations in the tree , one - loop , and two - loop approximation ( see ref.4 for references ) , and the blue dashed lines are obtained by a roy analysis@xcite that does not make use of chiral perturbation theory .",
    "we also show the recent , unquenched lattice result for @xmath5 obtained by nplqcd,@xcite as well as the range for @xmath6 and @xmath5 that corresponds to the values for the lecs given in ref.8 .",
    "the experimental results are from bnl e865,@xcite cern dirac,@xcite and cern na48/2@xcite experiments .",
    "having precise values for the subtraction constants , the threshold parameters , the s and p - wave phase shifts below 0.8 gev , and the coupling constants of the effective chiral su(2)@xmath7su(2 ) lagrangian relevant for @xmath0 scattering could be determined to high accuracy.@xcite@xmath8@xcite below 0.8 gev the influence of the high energies in the roy equations is very small .",
    "this was shown in ref.13 , where we explored the sensitivity of the roy solutions with respect to the high energy input .",
    "we solved roy equations using at high energy , instead of the regge model adopted in ref .",
    "5 , an alternative regge parametrization proposed recently.@xcite our analysis@xcite shows that the predictions for the s - wave scattering lengths and the isoscalar s - wave and p - wave phase shifts are practically unchanged , while the exotic s - wave phase shift is modified by only 1.4@xmath9 at 0.8 gev . for a detailed discussion",
    "see ref . 13 .",
    "the regge parametrization of @xmath0 amplitudes was discussed in the seventies , but afterwards the interest in this subject diminished .",
    "recently , a regge analysis of @xmath0 amplitudes was presented in ref .",
    "we are currently performing a new analysis,@xcite exploiting factorization of regge residua and dispersive sum rules .",
    "the motivation of the study is to have an improved input for solving roy equations above 0.8 gev , in the validity region @xmath10.@xcite below we give only a few results on the regge parametrization of the total cross sections .    using the notations adopted in ref .",
    "15 for @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 scattering , we express the @xmath0 total cross sections as @xmath14 the first two terms are the contribution of the pomeron , the last two the contribution of the @xmath15 and @xmath16 regge poles , respectively . @xmath17 and @xmath18 denote the regge residua supposed to satisfy factorization , and @xmath19 are related to the trajectories intercepts.@xcite    in figs .",
    "2 we present our results for the total cross sections with definite isospin in the t - channel : @xmath20 , which receives contribution from the pomeron and @xmath15 , and @xmath21 , dominated by the @xmath16 regge pole .",
    "the sum of the low partial waves at lower energies is indicated for comparison .",
    "the red bands are obtained by using the fits@xcite of @xmath22 and @xmath23 data above 5 gev and the factorization of regge residua .",
    "the blue and green bands represent the parametrizations considered in ref . 5 and ref .",
    "12 , respectively .",
    "the bands denoted as `` our estimates '' are obtained , for @xmath20 channel , by ascribing an extrapolation error to the parameters derived from factorization above 5 gev and , for @xmath21 channel , by applying olsson sum rule@xcite ( in this case the results given by factorization have large uncertainties ) .",
    "our results show that in ref.5 the @xmath20 contribution was slightly underestimated , while in ref .",
    "12 the authors take too small a value for the @xmath16 residue .",
    "details will be reported elsewhere.@xcite     ( left ) and @xmath21 ( right ) . , title=\"fig:\",width=221 ]   ( left ) and @xmath21 ( right ) . ,",
    "the scalar radius of the pion is an important quantity in chpt , because it is related to an effective coupling constant , @xmath24 , that determines the first nonleading contribution in the chiral expansion of the pion decay constant . a first crude estimate for the scalar radius in chpt reads@xcite : @xmath25 .",
    "an improved result , @xmath26 , was obtained from dispersion theory and two - channel unitarity for the scalar form factor @xmath27 ( see ref . 17 for a recent discussion and references to earlier works ) .",
    "this result was questioned in ref .",
    "18 , where the author used a single channel omns representation of the scalar radius in terms of the phase @xmath28 of the form factor , to advocate a larger value : @xmath29 .",
    "however , as we emphasized in ref .",
    "17 , the estimate@xcite of the phase @xmath28 ignores an ambiguity of @xmath30 in the watson theorem , which can be the resolved only by the explicit inclusion of inelastic channels in the mushkhelishvili - omns formalism .    in ref.19",
    "the author invokes perturbative qcd in favor of a large phase @xmath31 . to leading order in @xmath32 , neglecting quark and pion masses in the propagators ,",
    "one obtains for large spacelike momenta @xmath33 : @xmath34,\\ ] ] where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the twist-2 and twist-3 light - cone distribution amplitudes , respectively.@xcite both terms in eq .",
    "( [ qcd ] ) contain an end - point logarithmic divergence , which is usually replaced by @xmath37.@xcite in ref .",
    "19 the author keeps only the first term in ( [ qcd ] ) and claims that around 1 gev the phase @xmath28 is much larger than its asymptotic limit @xmath38 .",
    "but the first term in ( [ qcd ] ) vanishes faster than the second one for @xmath39 and represents , in comparison , a small correction .",
    "therefore , the arguments put forward in ref .",
    "19 are based on an incomplete calculation .",
    "moreover , the logarithmic singularity makes the specific predictions from qcd doubtful in this case .",
    "a complete discussion will be given elsewhere .",
