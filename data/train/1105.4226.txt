    "major theoretical concern so far , however , is limited to solving stationary states of the linear schrdinger equation , and to obtaining the energy spectra in closed networks and transmission probabilities for open networks with semi - infinite leads @xcite .",
    "only a few studies treats the nonlinear schrdinger equation on simple networks , which are still limited to the analysis of its stationary state@xcite .    with introduction of the nonlinearity to the time - dependent schrdinger equation",
    ", the network becomes to provide a nice playground where one can see interesting soliton propagations and nonlinear dynamics through the network @xcite , namely through an assembly of continuum line segments connected at vertices .",
    "although there exist important analytical studies on the semi - infinite and finite chains @xcite , we find little exact analytical treatment of soliton propagation through networks within a framework of nonlinear schrdinger equation(nlse ) @xcite .",
    "the subject is difficult due to the presence of vertices where the underlying chain should bifurcate or multi - furcate in general .",
    "recently , with a suitable boundary condition at each vertex we developed an exact analytical treatment of soliton propagation through networks within a framework of nlse @xcite . under an appropriate relationship among values of nonlinearity at individual bonds , we found nonlinear dynamics of solitons with no reflection at the vertex .",
    "we also showed that an infinite number of constants of motion are available for nlse on networks , namely the mapping of zakharov - shabat ( zs ) s scheme@xcite to networks was achieved .",
    "the extension of the scenario to the discrete nlse ( dnlse ) is far from being obvious .",
    "the standard dnlse is not integrable and the integrable variant of the continuum nonlinear schrdinger equation is the one proposed by ablowitz and ladik ( al)@xcite .",
    "al equation is the appropriate choice for the zeroth order approximation in studying the soliton dynamics perturbatively in physically motivated models , such as an array of coupled optical waveguides @xcite and proton dynamics in hydrogen - bonded chains @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of intrinsic localized modes in nonlinear lattices can be approximately described by al equation @xcite .",
    "exciton systems with exchange and dipole - dipole interactions also reduce to al equation in some limiting cases@xcite .",
    "the al chain is integrable by means of the inverse scattering transform , and , together with the toda lattice @xcite , constitutes a paradigm of the completely integrable lattice systems .",
    "al equation for a field variable @xmath0 on one - dimensional ( 1-d ) chain is given by @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the strength of nonlinear inter - site interaction and @xmath3 denotes each lattice site on the chain .",
    "this equation can be obtained from the canonical equation of motion with use of the non - standard poisson brackets .",
    "equation ( [ al-0 ] ) has an infinite number of independent constants of motion and is completely integrable @xcite .",
    "however , there is an ambiguity in generalizing the al model to networks : how can we define the inter - site interaction at each vertex in order to see the infinite - number of constants of motion in networks ? to keep the integrability of al equation , should any rule hold for the strength of nonlinearity on bonds joining at each vertex ? we shall resolve these questions in this paper and show how solitons of al equation on networks will be mapped to that of al equation on a 1-d chain .",
    "once this mapping will be found , the integrability properties like the inverse scattering transform , bcklund transformation , etc , are automatically guaranteed , and will not be addressed in this paper .    below we shall show the completely integrable case of the al equation on networks with strength of nonlinearity different from bond to bond . as a relevant issue , with use of reflectionless propagation of al soliton through networks , we shall evaluate the transmission probabilities on the outgoing bonds .",
    "in section ii , using a primary star graph ( psg ) and defining a suitable equation of motion at the vertex , we shall address the norm and energy conservations . in section iii",
    ", we shall show a basic idea of the soliton propagation along the branched chain , finding the connection formula at the vertex and the sum rule among the strengths of nonlinearity on the bonds , which guarantee the infinite number of constants of motions and complete integrability of the system under consideration . in section iv ,",

    "then eq.([eq1 ] ) can be obtained by the equation of motion @xmath25 at @xmath18 , with use of non - standard poisson brackets @xmath26 on the same footing as above , the equation of motions in eq.([net - al ] ) at ( 1,0 ) , ( 2,1 ) and ( 3,1 ) are given , respectively , as @xmath27 @xmath28    the solution is assumed to satisfy the following conditions at infinity : @xmath29 at @xmath30 and @xmath31 at @xmath32 for @xmath12 and 3 .",
    "it is known that the norm conservation is one of the most important physical conditions in conservative systems . since eqs.([eq1]),([v10 ] ) and ( [ vk1 ] ) are available from hamilton s equation of motion with non - standard poisson brackets , the norm and energy conservations seem obvious .",

    "thus , under the sum rule for nonlinearity coefficients in eq.([sumrule - g ] ) , the solution on psg is given by a common ( bond - independent ) soliton solution of eq.([al on line ] ) multiplied by square root of the inverse nonlinearity coefficient .",

    "<S> we elucidate the case in which the ablowitz - ladik ( al ) type discrete nonlinear schrdinger equation ( nlse ) on simple networks ( e.g. , star graphs and tree graphs ) becomes completely integrable just as in the case of a simple 1-dimensional ( 1-d ) discrete chain . the strength of cubic nonlinearity is different from bond to bond , and networks are assumed to have at least two semi - infinite bonds with one of them working as an incoming bond . </S>",

    "<S> we find : ( 1 ) the solution on each bond is a part of the universal ( bond - independent ) al soliton solution on the 1-d discrete chain , but is multiplied by the inverse of square root of bond - dependent nonlinearity ; ( 2 ) nonlinearities at individual bonds around each vertex must satisfy a sum rule ; ( 3 ) under findings ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , there exist an infinite number of constants of motion . as a practical issue , with use of al soliton injected through the incoming bond , we obtain transmission probabilities inversely proportional to the strength of nonlinearity on the outgoing bonds . </S>"
