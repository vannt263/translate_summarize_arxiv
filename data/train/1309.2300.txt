    "our own milky way galaxy is a spiral galaxy composed of stars , gas , dust  and a significant amount of dark matter @xcite . while matter beyond that provided by disk stars and gas is required to stabilize the milky way s disk @xcite , the distribution and density of that additional , apparently dark , matter is poorly known ( see , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "disk systems are not static , and while the literature on the azimuthal and radial dynamics of spiral systems is vast , less attention has been given to studies of disk dynamics in the vertical direction .",
    "the finding of @xcite ( hereafter w12 ) that there appears to be a significant ( peak amplitude of @xmath1 10% ) vertical wave in the number of stars within 1 kpc of the sun is surprising and at odds with a history of models of the disk as symmetrical and static in the vertical direction .",
    "it suggests that the galaxy is not in as close to a state of equilibrium in the vertical direction as is frequently assumed , and there may be events in the galaxy s recent past driving this and similar vertical waves @xcite .",
    "the unexpected nature of this result makes it worth revisiting with a larger sample of stars over a larger range in galactic longitude , while paying special attention to possible systematic effects which could affect the number counts above and below the galactic plane .",
    "the systematics which we explore are largely connected to our use of a photometric parallax relation to determine the distance to a star . in this",
    "the intrinsic luminosity of a main - sequence star is inferred from its color , so that its distance follows once its apparent magnitude is measured .",
    "systematic errors also arise from the confusion of dwarfs with giants , from the existence of unresolved binaries , and from stellar population differences , particularly in age and metallicity .",
    "the stars we consider are well above the galactic plane , but we also consider possible inadequacies in the application of corrections for reddening and extinction due to dust . to these ends",
    "we explore the dereddened colors of distant halo turnoff stars as a function of galactic longitude as well .",
    "finally , the location of the sun from the galactic plane is also a systematic , in that its value impacts the precise shape of the distribution of stars with respect to the galactic plane , though the inclusion of this effect does not reduce the significance of the asymmetry we observe .",
    "indeed , we find that none of these effects can have a significant effect on the large ( @xmath110% ) asymmetry we observe in the stellar number counts north versus south .",
    "this paper provides the background error analysis for the results of w12 and precedes the forthcoming paper ( gardner et al .",
    ", in preparation ) , which simultaneously analyzes north - south and left - right @xcite asymmetries and discusses their dynamical implications .",
    "in anticipation we present here the north - south asymmetry as a function of galactic longitude as well .",
    "we employ photometric and astrometric observations from sdss dr9 , the ninth data release ( dr9 ) of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) @xcite .",
    "dr9 is similar to the eighth data release ( dr8 ) @xcite , in that it has the same photometric imaging footprint , including a significant area of approximately 1000 square degrees over which the same galactic longitude range is covered at moderate galactic latitudes , avoiding the galactic plane , of equal and opposite sign .",
    "dr9 does correct an earlier issue with the astrometry of dr8 , which affected positions and proper motions of a small subset of stars with @xmath2 .",
    "in fact , we have used the measured proper motion of m67 to identify its stars , but that cluster is at sufficiently low @xmath3 that it is unaffected by this change .",
    "the photometry from dr9 is also remeasured separately from earlier sdss data releases , and this has possible effect on the calibration of photometric parallax relations .",
    "we consider this explicitly . one further difference between dr9 and earlier",
    "sdss imaging releases is that the dr9 release does not resolve the centers of dense clusters into individual stars as well as in earlier releases , such as in the seventh data release ( dr7 ) @xcite .",
    "these issues mean that when we test photometric parallax relations on known clusters , we find differences between different sdss data releases .",
    "these differences , however , are demonstrably small , and in fact have negligible impact on the asymmetry .    the same telescope , instrument , and software reduction system have been used to determine both the north and south data sets , and this gives us confidence that most of the systematic effects which could affect an asymmetry in the star counts have largely cancelled out .",
    "nevertheless , issues remain , specifically regarding inadequacies in the reddening corrections , which differ in the north and south , as well as large - scale calibration offset differences , both of which could mimic stellar population differences .",
    "we analyze these in more detail than could be done in the limited space of w12 .    to minimize obfuscation from dust , we consider high galactic latitudes , so that the viewing is well out of the galactic plane .",
    "we thus assume that all of the stars we select are beyond the dust , which is thought to lie at @xmath4 @xcite  this study is for @xmath5 only , but fig .",
    "19 of @xcite reveals that the dust scale height actually increases as one goes to the galactic center , making the assessment of @xcite a conservative one for our analysis . throughout",
    "we convert from the observed apparent magnitudes in the sdss @xmath6 filters to `` dereddened '' ones , denoted by a `` 0 '' subscript , using the extinction maps of @xcite .",
    "the dust maps depend on the galactic longitude @xmath7 and latitude @xmath8 and are rather different in the north and south , though the effects of dust are substantially reduced at the higher latitudes which we employ here .",
    "moreover , for our stars , which are predominately late k and m dwarfs , the vast majority of the region in both the north and south has extinction @xmath9 . specifically , using the @xcite maps , we note that less than 1% and 5.6% of the area in the north and south , respectively , has @xmath10 .",
    "we have recently studied ( w12 ) a data set selected as per the following criteria : namely , stars with galactic coordinates with @xmath11 and @xmath12 that also reside within a perpendicular distance of @xmath13 from the line extending directly up and down from the sun in the vertical coordinate @xmath14 . limiting the @xmath15-band magnitude such that @xmath16 and @xmath17 yields a data set of some 300,000 ( 0.3 m ) stars .",
    "the study of this data set yields a significant north - south asymmetry which has the appearance of a wavelike perturbation . in this paper",
    "we select a similar but non - identical data set , to investigate whether we can confirm the north - south asymmetry observed in our earlier data set . moreover ,",
    "if an asymmetry is present and is indeed the result of a perturbation , it is possible that it is localized to particular galactic longitudes in the neighborhood of the sun . we will pursue this possibility explicitly in gardner et al .",
    "( in preparation ) , and this predicates the use of a data set with broader coverage in @xmath7 .",
    "we thus select the stars of our present study under slightly broader criteria .",
    "the selected stars from sdss dr9 satisfy the constraints @xmath18 and @xmath19 , with @xmath20 brightness but without saturation yielding a sample of some @xmath21 stars .",
    "the selection in @xmath22 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bvsl ] . restricting to @xmath17 as per w12 yields a data set of some @xmath23 stars , comprised of late k and m dwarfs  @xcite .",
    "we select @xmath24 , @xmath15 magnitude , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 colors for each star .",
    "note that there is no cut on the distance from the sun imposed explicitly here as there was in w12 .",
    "for our asymmetry analysis as a function of galactic longitude , we consider a data set with @xmath28 , a sample of some 1.98 m stars , comprised of k and m dwarfs  @xcite .",
    "the covered region in @xmath14 and @xmath29 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : zvsr ] ; note that this range is also manifestly north - south symmetric and extends to @xmath30 kpc . in comparison ,",
    "the fits of w12 extend to @xmath31 kpc .",
    "we use @xmath15 band observations to assess the apparent magnitude of our stars because for the red stars we employ this band offers the greatest signal - to - noise ratio for the range of types of stars , which are k and m dwarfs , in our sample . from these inputs we estimate the distance to each star , albeit with systematic and statistical uncertainties , as we detail in the next section .",
    "the color of a main - sequence star can be used to determine its absolute magnitude through a photometric parallax relation .",
    "although typical random errors for stars at @xmath32 in the sdss catalog are 7% , after averaging together large numbers of measurements we can reduce the color errors for stars as faint as this magnitude to the level of the systematic error of 1.5% @xcite or below . combining statistical and systematic errors in quadrature , the associated colors are thus determined to within 3% for even the faintest objects .",
    "we determine the distance to a star in our sample of stars from dr9 using relations constructed using the stars imaged in sdss dr7 , such as those of @xcite , in @xmath26 color , and of @xcite , in @xmath27 color , respectively . to employ the photometric parallax method we have made a number of implicit assumptions , whose assessment ultimately lead to estimates of systematic errors .",
    "they concern i ) the _ identification _ of the stars in the survey , i.e. , whether they are single , main - sequence stars or not , ii ) the neglect of _ unmeasured properties _ such as stellar metallicity or age on the determined distance , iii ) the role of _ dust _ in the context of our use of the @xcite maps , and iv ) _ large - scale calibration _ issues between non - contiguously connected regions of the sky .",
    "we will consider each of these possibilities , and in each case we provide detailed , observational tests of our procedures .    to begin with , however , we test and calibrate the photometric parallax relations we employ by applying them to the study of stellar clusters at known distance . of these , we choose clusters out of the galactic plane containing stars of comparable color and metallicity to those in our data set .",
    "these criteria severely limit the number of clusters we can employ ; indeed , the clusters m67 ( ngc 2682 ) and ngc 2420 turn out to be the only suitable candidates .",
    "both clusters have been imaged ( once ) by the sdss and were released in both dr7 and dr9 .",
    "the image processing was similar but distinct in the two cases .",
    "the primary difference was that the processing in dr7 ran with a longer timeout , so that it resolved stars appearing deeper towards the centers of these clusters than in dr9 @xcite .",
    "the final photometric calibrations of dr7 and dr9 were performed separately using methods described in @xcite .",
    "we calibrate the photometric parallax relations we use with cluster data from dr7 .",
    "note that the relations used in this paper and in w12 differ in that different procedures to assess cluster membership were employed in the two cases . here",
    "we advocate a more refined procedure , as we shall describe .",
    "we also evaluate the impact of the shift from the use of dr7 to dr9 reductions quantitatively .",
    "we employ photometric parallax relations devised by @xcite in @xmath26 color and by @xcite in @xmath27 color .",
    "the analyses of @xcite and @xcite are based on main sequence fitting to a set of cluster fiducials covering a large range in color . in w12",
    "we used a different zeroth coefficient in each case in order to confront the literature distance to m67 successfully .",
    "we have refined that adjustment in our current work . for @xmath26 color , we begin with the `` bright '' relation of @xcite , valid over the color range @xmath33 , include a correction for the metallicity , and adjust the constant term in order to confront the cluster distances we have noted . in w12",
    "we employed @xmath34 ) + 2.38 + 13.30(r - i)_0 \\nonumber \\\\ & & -11.50(r - i)_0 ^ 2 + 5.40(r - i)_0 ^ 3 - 0.70(r - i)_0 ^ 4 \\ , \\label{pprmi0}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for the absolute magnitude @xmath35 , noting a metallicity correction @xmath36)= -1.11 [ \\hbox{fe / h } ] -   0.18 [ \\hbox{fe / h}]^2 $ ] @xcite , with @xmath37 $ ] in dex characterizing the metallicity .",
    "we assume a universal @xmath37 = -0.3 $ ] in our analysis of k and m dwarf field stars ; however , as we proceed out of the galactic plane in @xmath38 we expect the fraction of stars ( i.e. a thick disk population ) with a metallicity content of @xmath37 \\sim   -0.8 $ ] to increase .",
    "if @xmath37= -0.8 $ ] , the assessed distance would be off by some 200 pc , or some 20% on 1 kpc .",
    "our assessed distance error at any given height is a small fraction of this .",
    "this additional systematic error in distance for low - metal , thick - disk stars could potentially impact the location of the second peak in our asymmetry somewhat .",
    "we note , then , that the final constant term in color for these stars evaluates to some 0.50 mag less than that employed in @xcite .",
    "although this may seem like a large offset it will not turn out to be so .",
    "one reason for this is that the stars used to calibrate @xcite and @xcite were much bluer and essentially disjoint from the red stars used to calibrate our version of their photometric parallax relations .",
    "interested readers can find more sophisticated m - dwarf photometric parallax relations in @xcite . in performing the current analysis",
    ", we realized that the large offset we found was driven by our simple assessment of cluster membership in m67 and ngc 2420 , which we amend here . in the current paper",
    "we employ a constant term of 3.2 in eq .",
    "( [ pprmi0 ] ) , which is just that of @xcite , though we allow for a metallicity correction of @xmath39)$ ] as well , unlike that work .",
    "note that both the current analysis and that of w12 were adjusted to yield the literature distances to the clusters ; the play of some 20% in the distance assessments is a consequence of the manner in which we deduced cluster membership  it is removed once the membership criteria are sharpened .",
    "thus we investigate these issues in careful detail .",
    "the @xmath27 relation of @xcite , for @xmath40 , comes from confronting dr7 sdss globular cluster data with @xmath41 , and the shape of the extension to redder colors was developed from the `` bright '' relation of @xcite , over the color range @xmath33 . for @xmath27 color , we start with the relation of @xcite and adjust the constant term in order to confront the cluster distances we have noted . in w12",
    "we employed @xmath34 ) -1.22 + 14.32(g - i)_0 \\nonumber \\\\ & & -12.97(g - i)_0 ^ 2 + 6.127(g - i)_0 ^ 3 - 1.267(g - i)_0 ^ 4 + 0.0967(g - i)_0 ^ 5 \\ , , \\label{ppgmi0}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we used precisely the same metallicity correction in both color bands .",
    "we note that our constant term for these stars is some 0.66 mag less than that employed in @xcite .",
    "this shift , too , is a consequence of our assessment of cluster membership . in the current paper",
    "we employ a constant of -.50 , which is 0.06 mag greater than the constant in @xcite .",
    "finally , we estimate the distance @xmath42 ( in parsecs ) to a star with intrinsic magnitude @xmath35 and apparent magnitude @xmath15 via the standard relation @xmath43 . the analysis of @xcite has been used to study the stars of the local solar neighborhood , particularly to the end of determining the height of the sun with respect to the galactic plane . in comparing the stars selected for our asymmetry analysis with those of that study ,",
    "our sample is not as red in color so that it does not go as close to the galactic plane .",
    "moreover , our estimated offset of the intrinsic luminosity , as per the reference distance to stars of a more limited color range , also pushes our stars somewhat farther away .    in what follows",
    "we reexamine these photometric parallax relations in detail using the observations of main sequence k and m dwarf stars in our two chosen reference clusters , paying careful attention to cluster membership and other systematic effects .",
    "we calibrate the photometric parallax relations we use with cluster data from dr7 .",
    "we then employ our calibrated relations to study the distance to the stars from the same clusters in the dr9 data set , to examine whether any additional adjustments of the photometric parallax relations are necessary .",
    "we wish to realize the sharpest assessment of the photometric distance possible , making analysis choices driven by data independent of our asymmetry sample in order to realize an accurate assessment of its shape .",
    "we begin with the cluster m67 , for which proper motion information is available ( and which we did not exploit in w12 ) .",
    "figure [ fig : m67pm ] shows the proper motion of stars in and around the field of m67 .",
    "there are two distinct loci , that of stars in m67 itself and that of a somewhat broader set of stars clearly separated from m67 .",
    "these are milky way field stars .",
    "the preliminary membership cut was based on an empirical look at the one - dimensional histograms of @xmath44 in each coordinate ( @xmath45 and @xmath46 ) .",
    "the cut was slightly refined by displaying candidate members in a color - magnitude diagram and finding a reasonably small number of outliers .",
    "we have made the following proper motion cuts : @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "no objects with a proper motion error greater than 5 @xmath49 in either coordinate are included .",
    "a histogram of proper - motion errors shows a modal value of about 2.5 @xmath49 .",
    "figure [ fig : hr_m67 ] shows a ( @xmath50 ) color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) of dr7 stars near the position of the cluster m67 which have proper motions consistent with it .",
    "a cursory glance at fig .  [ fig : m67pm ] shows that the milky way field in this direction has an average proper motion significantly offset from the m67 average proper motion , so that this procedure removes most field stars , but there is some overlap .    while the proper motion cut significantly decreases outliers ,",
    "there remain several field stars which stand out in the cmd .",
    "also , there is a clear sequence of unresolved , roughly equal - mass binaries sitting approximately 0.7 mag above the main sequence .",
    "these , as well as the obvious field stars , are separated with simple diagonal cuts and are indicated with open symbols .",
    "the filled circles represent our `` cleaned '' sample used to calibrate our photometric parallax relations .",
    "roughly half of all stars are in binaries , as borne out by explicit study of the m67 cluster @xcite . however , since the luminosity of a main - sequence star scales as its mass raised to the power @xmath51 , the distance to a sufficiently unequal - mass binary can nevertheless be reasonably evaluated through use of a photometric parallax relation  upon assuming that the heavy companion were alone present .",
    "a star which is 2.5 times brighter than another is approximately 1.0 less than it in magnitude ; thus we see that evaluating the magnitude of a binary of main - sequence stars by replacing it with the heavier star of them yields magnitude shifts of 0.75 , 0.57 , 0.41 , and 0.28 for a binary with stars in a mass ratio of 1.0 , 0.9 , 0.8 , and 0.7 , respectively .",
    "the appearance of binaries smears the locus of points in the connection of color to intrinsic luminosity and thus limits the precision to which we can assess the distance  this will be reflected in the scatter of distances we determine to the stars in the cluster , which we will assess as a statistical , or random , error .",
    "studies of the mass - ratio distribution shows that binaries occur more frequently in relatively close mass pairs , both in the m67 cluster , noting fig .",
    "14 of @xcite , and for solar - like stars in the milky - way field , noting fig .",
    "16 of @xcite .",
    "the presence of such like - mass binaries smear the color - luminosity relation the most and thus , from the perspective of distance assessment , are the most problematic ; however , from visual inspection of fig .",
    "[ fig : hr_m67 ] we see that they are only some 10% of our cluster stars .",
    "we identify 27 of such objects in dr7 , which we presume are binaries with mass ratios of 0.9 or greater ; this number compares closely to the some 30 stars noted in fig .",
    "14 of @xcite .",
    "although equal - mass binaries must also be present in our field stars , possibly with equal probability , we have omitted correcting for a fraction of these objects in our calibration of our photometric parallax relation because we believe it best to sharpen the distance determination of the preponderance of stars in our sample .",
    "we note that this cleaning procedure was not effected in the calibration used in w12 , so that we can test the impact of this choice through the comparison of our results with those of w12 .",
    "let us remark in advance that we observe no changes which would be predicated by this .",
    "figure [ fig : dgmi_m67 ] shows a ( @xmath52 ) diagram after applying the photometric parallax relation of eq .  ( [ ppgmi0 ] ) and employing @xmath53 = 0.0 $ ] @xcite for the cluster .",

    "( [ pprmi0 ] ) . as for the reference distance to this cluster , we note the recent compilation of @xcite ; assuming the results therein are independent , we make an error - weighted average , assuming the errors are independent , to find @xmath55 .",
    "we use this result in what follows , though we note by comparison the distance obtained from the use of empirically calibrated ( theoretical ) isochrone models is @xmath56 kpc @xcite .",
    "ideally the determined photometric distance to a cluster should be independent of the employed color ; the extent to which this is practically so is a test of the photometric parallax relation . in fig .",

    "the third panel shows the result of applying eqs .",
    "( [ ppgmi0 ] ) and ( [ dgmi0tune ] ) to the dr9 ( rather than the dr7 ) sample .",
    "it is apparent that the small correction gives a significantly better fit , and it is also apparent that the sdss calibration of the dr9 sample is close enough to the dr7 sample that the same photometric parallax relations ( with linear slope correction ) may be used for both dr7 and dr9 .",
    "we now proceed to determine how precisely we can assess the cluster distance .    the upper left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : m67gmigauss ] shows the dr7 data for the m67 cluster with only the proper motion cut applied .",

    "the lower panel is the dr9 version of the upper right panel , i.e. , the binaries have been removed via a similar procedure and the same proper motion cut has been applied .",
    "each panel shows both a histogram of the distances to the stars in the cluster as well as the results of a gaussian fit .",
    "the fit parameters are listed in small boxes at the upper right of each panel .",

    "that is , we show the @xmath61 per degree of freedom , as well as the fit parameters , namely , a constant ( @xmath62 ) , mean ( @xmath63 ) , and sigma ( @xmath64 ) .",
    "the two most relevant parameters to compare are the histogram rms with the sigma from the gaussian fit .",
    "these parameters should agree in the limit of a large number of points if the data set is indeed normally distributed . in particular ,",
    "when a data set has many outliers , the histogram rms width may be very different from the gaussian width .",
    "for instance , in the upper left panel , the histogram rms is @xmath65 , whereas @xmath64 is only @xmath66 . after cleaning ,",
    "the histogram rms becomes @xmath67 , whereas @xmath64 becomes @xmath68  the difference has shrunk from a factor of eight to a factor of two .",
    "looking at the dr9 sample , after a similar cleaning procedure has been applied , the rms is @xmath69 , whereas @xmath64 is @xmath70 , yielding a comparison somewhat worse than the fit to the dr7 data .",
    "we are not concerned by this because the dr9 data set has only 65% as many stars as the dr7 sample .",
    "we regard the difference between the histogram rms and the gaussian sigma as an estimate of systematic error , reflective of the presence of non - cluster members , whereas sigma itself provides a statistical error estimate .",

    "consequently , we claim that we can assess the distance to a star in m67 to @xmath74 as well .",

    "we consider each of these possibilities in turn .",
    "our selection @xmath86 is numerically dominated by faint - end - magnitude stars ; this ensures that giants can only play a small role in our sample .",

    "we now turn to the possibility of unresolved , equal - mass binaries in our sample .",

    "16 of that reference shows that 17 of 110 binaries have a mass ratio of 0.9 or greater , which is consistent within statistics with our study of m67 . even though we do not correct for this effect in the field",
    ", there is nothing different about the way these objects affect apparent star magnitudes above or below the plane , and again , as with the contamination by giants , unresolved binaries can not not alter the asymmetry results of w12 significantly .",
    "how do unmeasured properties such as age and metallicity impact the assessed distances to our stars ?",
    "stellar age is a particularly straightforward issue for us , since we are dealing nearly exclusively with stars ( k and m dwarfs ) which have not yet begun to evolve off the main sequence .",
    "a spread in the ages of these stars will not have a significant effect on their colors until they do so . moreover , the impact of very young stars is also not an issue .",
    "the minimum height above the plane for our stars is no less than 300 pc , so that we are also confident that the vast majority of our stars ( @xmath93 ) are already on the main sequence and have standard color - magnitude relations for main sequence k and m stars @xcite .",
    "t tauri stars and other young stars which may still be on their descending hayashi track to the main sequence are restricted to distances much closer to the plane .",
    "in particular , the scale height of molecular gas , where essentially all stars are born is only 74 pc @xcite .",
    "the role of metallicity is a more difficult issue .",
    "attempts to determine metallicity from photometry only @xcite almost invariably rely on the determination of @xmath94-band - connected colors because such colors are the most sensitive ( for sdss filters ) to the presence or absence of the line - blanketing effects of uv atomic metal transitions .",
    "while we have access to the @xmath94-band magnitudes and @xmath95 colors for our stars , we do not have sufficient precision in the @xmath94 band to develop a sufficiently accurate photometric proxy for the metallicity . nevertheless , our fig .",
    "[ fig : giants ] , with its closely overlapping north and south dwarf stellar loci , crudely demonstrates the absence of a strong shift in the average metallicity of the two samples .",
    "although vertical and radial gradients in the metallicity are known @xcite , the existence of possible north - south differences have not been documented .",
    "certainly our fig .",
    "[ fig : giants ] offers a simple probe of this issue and suggests that it is unimportant , allowing us to set it aside .      a remaining systematic effect concerns the possibility of inadequately estimated reddening differences between the north and south .",
    "while the @xcite dust maps have been shown , using photometry and cmd histograms , to be very accurate @xcite , especially for higher latitude ( @xmath96 ) sight - lines , there remains their finding , which is affirmed with a separate analysis using stars with segue spectra @xcite , that the stars in the south , working in @xmath97 color and using a very large scale average , appear to be about 0.02 mag redder than the stars in the north .",
    "this result is based on the average colors of blue turn - off stars .",
    "the difference in @xmath26 color is smaller by a factor of three .",
    "there are three possible explanations for the observed color difference .",
    "first , there may be a global calibration error in the photometry within the sdss dr7 ( and dr8 ) releases , which the study of @xcite supports , though this , noting table 4 of @xcite , does not seem to capture the complete effect .",
    "however , the differences in area in the two studies implies that the conclusions of @xcite need not hold for the photometric study @xcite .",
    "an offset in the @xmath98-band magnitude scale is the most likely because the blue - tip stars in @xmath26 color are relatively unaffected . maintaining absolute calibrations to better than 1% across very large areas , especially those which are only nominally contiguous , as it is here with different regions connected only by narrow strips running through the galactic plane ,",
    "is an extremely difficult task , subject to many subtle problems .",
    "a recent analysis by @xcite re - examines the large scale calibration of the sdss with an effort toward improving type i supernovae ( standard candle ) distances and finds that there are indeed systematic drifts in the sdss calibration of some filters at the level of 1% to 2% over 100@xmath99 scales .",
    "thus we regard it as very possible that such a large - scale calibration drift exists in the @xmath98 band between the north and south .",
    "a second way to explain a global color difference would be a reddening map anomaly .",
    "all our colors and magnitudes are corrected for reddening based on @xcite .",
    "we regard a problem with the reddening maps to be unlikely , as we discuss below , but we can not completely rule out this possibility . a third way to have a global color difference would be through an actual stellar population difference , namely , that the distribution of stellar metallicity is different above and below the galactic plane .",
    "this , too , we think is unlikely , and we discuss it further later . in order to select among the possibilities , we divide the `` blue - tip '' stars ( turn - off stars of spectral type f extending to the halo of the milky way ) , in our survey region into six 20@xmath99 segments in galactic @xmath7 .",
    "we plot the @xmath97 color histograms of these blue - tip stars in three magnitude bins , namely @xmath100 , and @xmath101 , and measure the central color and peak heights of each histogram in the north and south samples separately .",
    "since @xcite uses @xmath102 cmds for their analysis of blue - tip stars , we adopt the same analysis for consistency .",
    "the results of this analysis are reported in table 1 , and the number count studies and color offsets are also summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : bluetip ] .",

    "the numbers in parentheses indicate the total star counts in the central bin .",
    "note that the number counts of blue - tip stars in each bin should roughly match in the north and south ( within poisson errors ) , provided the halo is fairly smooth . within poisson statistics , only two bins ( in boldface ) are markedly discrepant  and we will find that they correspond to the angular location and distance of the turnoff stars in the sagittarius stream .    generally fig .",
    "[ fig : bluetip ] and table 1 show that the number of turn - off stars tends to fall more or less smoothly for a fixed band of @xmath98 as @xmath7 increases , i.e. , as one looks away from the galactic center .",
    "there is one pair of bins in the south , however , with @xmath103 and @xmath104 , which is strikingly inconsistent with that trend . in this case",
    "the difference in the number counts in matching bins north and south are several times the square root of the counts in the corresponding bins  suggesting the presence of a structure .",
    "in fact these bins in the south are contaminated by sagittarius stream stars , as can be seen by an examination of fig .",
    "9 of @xcite , which clearly shows the sagittarius stream passing through this @xmath7 range .",
    "the implied distances to the blue - tip stars , that is , @xmath105 kpc , closely matches that of the distance to the sagittarius stream stars . aside from this particular structure",
    "present in the south , the relative numbers of blue - tip stars in the north and south are fairly closely matched .",
    "we also note that the average colors of the south blue tip stars are systematically a couple of percent redder than the corresponding bins in the north , and these differences persist across four of the 20@xmath99 longitude bins and three different magnitude bins , the latter corresponding to three different distance bins ranging from some 5 to 25 kpc from the sun . this persistent color difference , which is just what @xcite found , argues strongly against the existence of a localized stellar population difference , or a localized `` rogue dust cloud , '' in either just the north or the south , but rather suggests a global calibration difference . in support of this",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : gmirmi ] the comparison of @xmath27 and @xmath26 for stars in our sample . the tight central locus of fig .",
    "[ fig : gmirmi ] which appears without sharp bends , shows that one color may be substituted for the other without large shifts of estimated ( photometric parallax ) distances .",
    "this in itself argues against the possibilities of rogue population or reddening differences .",
    "note that even with this global calibration difference , the star counts made in the north in comparison to those made in the south are not really affected because we see the same asymmetries whether we use the @xmath26 or the @xmath27 photometric parallax relation .",
