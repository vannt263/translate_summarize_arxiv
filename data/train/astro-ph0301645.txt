    "the first stars in the universe almost certainly originated under conditions rather different from those characterizing present - day star formation . because elements heavier than lithium are thought to be produced exclusively through stellar nucleosynthesis , the primordial gas must have been chemically pristine , presumably resulting in stars of unusually low metallicity .",

    "the study of the cooling of primordial gas and the origin of the first baryonic objects has a long history ( e.g. , matsuda , sato & takeda 1969 ; kashlinsky & rees 1983 ; couchman & rees 1986 ; fukugita & kawasaki 1991 ; tegmark et al .",

    "dense , cold clouds of self - gravitating molecular gas develop in the inner regions of small halos and contract into proto - stellar objects with masses in the range @xmath18 .",
    "while these investigations support the notion that the first stars were unusually massive , the simulations to date have either mostly been limited to special cases or ignored the cosmological context of halo formation and collapse . in particular , the question of how the _ population _ of the first luminous objects emerged within a large cosmological volume has not been explored .    planned observational programs will exploit future instruments such as _ jwst _ and _ alma _ to probe the physical processes which shaped the high - redshift universe . among the relevant scientific issues",

    "they are used to test how sample variance of the initial density field affects the final results .",
    "we carried out a simulation with dark matter only , denoted `` run dm '' , to construct halo merger histories to construct the semi - analytic model described in section 8 .",
    "we continued the simulations until about 100 million years after the first bound object formed .",
    "radiation from the first object(s ) should , in principle , be included because it affects the chemical and thermodynamic evolution of the surrounding igm in a large fraction of our simulated regions .",
    "nevertheless , we do not take such radiative effects into account in the first series of our simulations , in order to isolate other dynamical effects on primordial gas cloud formation .",
    "we carry out the same set of simulations with uv radiation in the lyman - werner bands and examine the global effect of photo - dissociation in section 7 .    during the simulations ,",
    "we save 64 snapshots of the particle data spaced logarithmically in cosmic expansion parameter from redshift @xmath38 to @xmath41 .",
    "we use these outputs to identify cold , dense gas clouds , and to construct dark matter halo merger trees .",
    "we locate dark matter halos by running a friends - of - friends ( fof ) groupfinder with linking parameter @xmath42 ( jenkins et al .",
    "2001 ) in units of mean particle separation , and discard the groups which have less than 100 dark matter particles .",
    "we define the virial radius @xmath43 of a halo as the radius of the sphere centered on the most bound particle of the fof group having overdensity 180 with respect to the critical density .",
    "the virial mass @xmath44 is then the enclosed mass ( gas + dark matter ) within @xmath43 .",
    "for the halos identified in the simulations , we measure the mass of gas which is cold ( @xmath45 ) and dense ( @xmath46@xmath47 ) . once the gas starts to cool , clouds of molecular gas grow rapidly at the centers of halos and their masses exceed the characteristic jeans mass @xmath48 for the typical temperature @xmath49 k and density @xmath50@xmath47 of the condensed primordial gas .",
    "hence , they are expected to be sites for active star formation .",
    "hereafter , we refer to such cold , dense gas clumps as `` gas clouds . ''",
    "since a halo can host more than one gas clouds , we run a fof groufinder independently to the gas particles with a very small linking parameter @xmath51 . in this manner",
    "we can separate groups of dense gas particles .",
    "we then discard groups of gas particles that do not satisfy the above criteria of cold , dense gas . by checking the locations of the selected groups in all the outputs , however , we found no halos which host more than one gas clouds in this particular simulation .",
    "figure [ plot1 ] shows the projected gas distribution in the simulation box of run a at @xmath52 .",
    "the bright spots are the primordial gas clouds .",
    "there are 31 gas clouds in the simulated volume .",

    "it approximates the evolution of the minimum mass of the star - forming systems . in the figure",
    ", we also show the evolution of the most massive halo in each run .",
    "the apparent earlier formation epoch of the first bound object in run a is simply due to finite volume effects .",
    "run a simulated a volume 8 times larger than the others , and thus it contained a higher-@xmath53 density fluctuation than runs c1 or c2 .",
    "cosmic variance also explains the difference in the minimum mass between runs c1 and c2 .",
    "the assigned initial power spectrum for run c1 had , by chance , somewhat larger amplitudes than for run c2 on the largest scales .",
    "we checked that the dark halo mass functions are noticeably different at large mass scales between the two runs . on the other hand ,",
    "excellent agreement is found in the minimum mass scale between the high resolution run b ( dot - dashed line ) and low resolution run c1 ( filled circles ) .",
    "our result appears to be converged on mass scales which our simulations probe .",
    "figure [ plot2 ] clearly shows that the minimum collapse mass scale lies at @xmath54 , with only a weak dependence on redshift in the range plotted .",
    "our result agrees reasonably well with that of fuller & couchman ( 2000 ) , who carried out three - dimensional simulations for single high-@xmath53 density peaks .",
    "the weaker redshift dependence found by us reflects the fact that we define the minimum collapse mass using a large sample of halos formed in various places in the simulation volume , rather than for a single or a few objects in high density regions .",
    "our result is also roughly consistent with that of machacek et al .",
    "( 2001 ; 2003 ) , who obtain a smaller value for the minimum mass , @xmath55 .    an important quantity that determines the onset of gas cooling is the fraction of hydrogen molecules , @xmath56 .",
    "in figure [ plot3 ] we plot @xmath56 against the virial temperature for halos     + in run a at @xmath52 .",
    "we compute the virial temperature for the halo mass using @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the mean molecular weight and @xmath59 is the collapse overdensity .",
    "filled circles represent the halos harboring a cold dense gas cloud , while open circles are for the others .",
    "the solid line is an analytical estimate of the h@xmath5 fraction needed to cool the gas , which we compute _ a l _ tegmark et al .",
    "briefly , we compute the characteristic cooling time of a gas with density @xmath60 and temperature @xmath61 as @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the cooling rate due to molecular hydrogen rotational line transitions , and determine the critical molecular hydrogen abundance with which the gas can cool within a hubble time . note that we use the cooling function of galli & palla ( 1998 ) for our simulations and for this estimate .",
    "the dashed line is the asymptotic molecular fraction of a gas in a transition regime when electron depletion makes the production of hydrogen molecules ineffective",
    ". then the molecular fraction scales as @xmath64 ( see eq .",
    "[ 17 ] of tegmark et al .",
    "1997 )    in figure [ plot3 ] , halos appear to be clearly separated into two populations ; those in which the gas has cooled ( top - right ) , and the others ( bottom - left ) .",
    "our analytic estimate indeed agrees very well with the distribution of gas in the @xmath56 - @xmath61 plane .",
    "we emphasize , however , that this apparent agreement should not be interpreted as the model precisely describing the gas evolution .",
    "also , the analytic model itself is expected to be accurate only to within some numerical factor .",
    "although the h@xmath5 fraction primarily determines whether the gas in halos can cool or not , there are some halos within which gas clouds have not formed despite the high gas temperatures ( open circles with @xmath65 ) . at @xmath52 , about 30% of the massive halos are `` deficient '' in this manner .",
    "similar features are also found in the result of the amr simulation of machacek et al .",
    "( 2001 , their fig .",
    "3 ) . in the next section",
    "we further examine what prevents the gas from cooling and collapsing in these halos .",
    "halos in cdm models grow hierarchically through merging and the accretion of smaller objects .",
    "the complex and violent formation processes of dark halos affect the thermal and chemical evolution of the gas within them .",
    "to addess this , we study the dynamical influence of dark matter on gas cloud evolution using halo merger histories .",
    "we identified a total of 635 dark halos in run a at @xmath52 .",
    "for all the halos , we traced their progenitors in earlier outputs to construct merger trees . in figure [ plot4 ]",
    "we plot the mass evolution of a subset of halos that host gas clouds ( top - left panel ) and of another subset of halos that do not host gas clouds ( top - right panel ) . in the top - left panel ,",
    "we mark trajectories by filled circles when they host gas clouds .",
    "the figures show a clear difference between the two subgroups in their mass evolution .",
    "most of the halos in the top - left panel experience a gradual mass increase since the time their masses exceeded @xmath66 , whereas those plotted in the top - right panel have grown rapidly after @xmath67 .",
    "it appears that the gas in halos that accrete mass rapidly ( primarily due to mergers ) is unable to cool efficiently .    rapid mass accretion and mergers dynamically heat the gas when halos form , causing it to become hot and rarefied , rather than allowing it to radiatively cool and condense",
    "this is the situation first considered by white & rees ( 1978 ) in the context of hierarchical galaxy formation .",
    "the simplest model to describe the evolution of radiative gas assumes that the gas cools when the characteristic cooling time is shorter than the dynamical time .",
    "this scenario has been used to estimate the minimum mass scale for galaxies .",
    "the gas cooling rate due to atomic hydrogen and helium associated with galaxy formation has a particular behavior in it decreases sharply below @xmath68 k by many orders of magnitude , which effectively prevents the cooling of gas in systems with low virial temperatures .",
    "hence , the cooling criterion @xmath69 simply sets a definite minimum mass scale ( at a given redshift ) for galaxy formation .",
    "the situation we consider here is clearly different , because molecular hydrogen cooling is a much _ less _ efficient process and has a weaker dependence on temperature .",
    "more important , for this mechanism to be effective , a certain number of hydrogen molecules must first be produced , because the residual h@xmath5 abundance in the early universe is negligible .",
    "figure [ plot4 ] illustrates these features . in the bottom panels , we plot the evolution of the molecular hydrogen fraction and the mean gas mass weighted temperature for the same halos as in the top panels . most of the trajectories in the bottom - right panels show a common feature : the temperature rises with little increase in the molecular hydrogen fraction .",
    "we can understand this as follows .",
    "consider an equal - mass merger where two halos each with a mass @xmath70 merge to form an object of mass @xmath71 at @xmath72 .",
    "the h@xmath14 fraction of the gas in the two halos is     +   +   +     + predicted to be about @xmath73 ( see the dashed line in figure [ plot3 ] ) .",
    "after virialization , the gas temperature becomes @xmath74k , and our estimate for the h@xmath14 fraction needed for the gas to cool is about @xmath75 , about a factor of 2.5 larger than the progenitor gas . in this case , the production of molecular hydrogen , the coolant , must precede cooling .",
    "only when a further temperature increase or an increase in the molecular fraction brings the gas into the region above the critical line in the @xmath76 plane can the gas cool efficiently , unless significant heating occurs during this cooling phase .",
    "the molecular hydrogen formation time scale for this typical halo is estimated to be @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the reaction coefficient of h@xmath1 formation via h + e@xmath1 @xmath79 h@xmath1 + @xmath80 .",
    "the h@xmath14 formation timescale is comparable to the dynamical time for this halo .",
    "it is interesting that the most massive halo plotted in the top - right panel of figure [ plot4 ] has a mass of @xmath81 at @xmath52 .",
    "the mass growth of the halo is so rapid below @xmath82 , when it had a mass of @xmath70 , that the gas within it could not cool to form a dense gas cloud .",
    "it has been instead continuously _ heated _ dynamically .",
    "we can quantify this dynamical effect using our simulations .",
    "we trace the progenitors of the massive ( @xmath83 ) halos in run a identified at @xmath52 , and compute recent mass accretion rates from @xmath84 , where we choose @xmath85 and @xmath86 . in figure [ plot5 ]",
    "we plot the measured mass growth rates against the halo masses .",
    "filled circles represent the halos that host gas clouds at @xmath52 , and open circles are for those that do not .",
    "we derive a critical mass growth rate by equating the heating rate to the     + molecular hydrogen cooling rate from @xmath87 and relate the increase in virial temperature to the mass growth rate by @xmath88 where the coefficient @xmath89 is computed from equation ( 1 ) at a given time . strictly speaking",
    ", the temperature of the gas in a halo could be different from the halo s virial temperature .",
    "we have carried out an additional simulation with non - radiative gas starting from the same initial conditions as run b ( the highest resolution simulation ) and found that the mean gas - mass weighted temperature is indeed close to the halo s virial temperature for almost all the halos , with deviations smaller than a factor of two ( see also figure 2 of machacek et al .",
    "therefore , we may safely assume that the gas temperature is close to the virial temperature before cooling occurs .    in figure [ plot5",
    "] , the solid line is our analytic estimate for the critical mass growth rate . above the solid line ,",
    "the mass growth rate is so large that dynamical heating acts more efficiently than cooling by molecular hydrogen .",
    "thus , in such halos , gas cloud formation is effectively delayed or prevented .",
    "note the steepness of the critical mass growth rate , which reflects the slope of the molecular hydrogen cooling rate @xmath90 in the temperature and density range of interest . for a halo with mass @xmath70 at @xmath91 , even a 20% mass increase per unit redshift results in net heating of the gas .",
    "the critical mass growth rate     +     + therefore sets a natural lower limit for primordial gas cloud formation at a mass scale @xmath92 , in good agreement with the result shown in figure [ plot2 ] .",
    "recent numerical studies by bromm et al .",
    "( 2002 ) show that the initial angular momentum of primordial gas may determine the properties of the first star - forming clouds and possibly of the stars themselves . by pre - assigning the system s initial angular momentum and following its evolution , bromm et al .",
    "( 2002 ) found that a disk - like structure is formed in high spin systems and that the gas subsequently fragments .",
    "it is therefore interesting to ask whether such high spin systems are indeed produced in cosmological simulations .",
    "we measure the spin parameters of the dark matter component and of the gas within them .",
    "we follow the definition of bullock et al .",

    "we also note that the spin vectors of dark matter and the gas are not closely aligned , with a median deviation angle of @xmath99 degrees , in good agreement with the results of van den bosch et al .",
    "( 2001 ) for higher mass halos .    in figure [ plot6 ]",
    ", the spin parameters appear relatively smaller for halos with gas clouds than for the entire halo population , because gas clouds form only in halos at the high - mass end .",
    "bromm et al s result suggests that in systems with a spin parameter as large as 0.06 , gas clouds eventually flatten to form a rotationally supported disc .",
    "we find only two star - forming halos in which either the gas or dark matter spin parameters are greater than 0.06 .",
    "although rare , such objects do form in the cdm model .",
    "it is important to point out , however , that the spin vectors of the gas and dark matter are _ not _ usually aligned .",
    "this confirms the importance of setting up simulations in a proper cosmological context .",
    "intriguingly , vitvitska et al .",
    "( 2002 ) argue that halos which have experienced recent major mergers tend to have high spin parameters .",
    "this may explain the overall trend in figure [ plot6 ] that gas clouds are preferentially found in low - spin halos .",
    "it is still a difficult task to measure the spin parameters of the formed dense gas clouds accurately , because of resolution limitations . to address the question of the exact shape and the size of the final gas clump , we require a substantially higher resolution simulation .",
    "the cooling and condensation of the gas within a dark halo can be qualitatively understood using a spherical collapse model .",

    "photo - dissociation of molecular hydrogen due to radiation in the lyman - werner ( lw ) bands ( 11.18ev - 13.6ev ) is of primary importance , because the lw radiation can easily penetrate into the neutral igm ( dekel & rees 1987 ; haiman , abel & rees 2000 ; omukai & nishi 1999 ; glover & brand 2001 ) .",

    "we adopt the values @xmath120 by noting that the lw radiation with intensities @xmath121 does not significantly affect the abundance of molecular hydrogen in halos , whereas radiation with @xmath122 will quickly dissociate hydrogen molecules .",
    "this can be easily seen by computing the dissociation time scale @xmath123 during run c1 , we turned on the background radiation at @xmath124 , slightly before the formation of the first gas cloud in the simulation box .",
    "although it might seem more consistent to turn on the radiation only after the first object is formed , we start it slightly earlier , in order to study the evolution of the gas in the most massive halo as well .",
    "figure [ plot8 ] shows the distribution of gas particles in the thermodynamic phase plane at @xmath112 .",
    "the dashed lines in figure [ plot8 ] are computed by solving equations ( 7)-(9 ) including the lw radiation with @xmath125 and 0.01 . for these cases",
    "we computed the evolution of the abundance of molecular hydrogen @xmath126 for @xmath127 and 0.01 . and then evaluated the gas cooling rate @xmath128 . for @xmath129 ,",
    "the cooling branch now appears to lie on a shallower line than for the case with no radiation ( figure 7 ) .",
    "the analytic model again describes the feature reasonably well .",
    "it is interesting that under the influence of lw radiation the characteristic temperature of the gas clouds becomes higher than in the case with no radiation .",
    "omukai ( 2001 ) argues that both the density and temperature of gas clouds in the regime before they start to undergo run - away collapse become higher for a stronger radiation field and the characteristic jeans mass becomes _",
    "smaller_. although our simulation does not probe this regime owing to lack of resolution , it is intriguing that the presence of radiation affects the final mass of the collapsing gas clouds .",
    "note also that , in a cosmological context , even a slight delay of gas cooling can make the subsequent evolution very different because of the rapid formation of dark matter halos .",
    "the case with @xmath119=0.1 is noticeably different from the other two ( figure 7 , 8) models .",
    "gas cooling and collapse are almost entirely prevented when the lw radiation dissociates molecular hydrogen .",
    "for this case , we compute the h@xmath14 formation and dissociation timescales to be @xmath130 myrs , @xmath131 myrs , respectively , with the latter being much smaller than the former .",
    "thus , we expect the h@xmath14 abundance to be close to the equilibrium value .",
    "the equilibrium h@xmath14 abundance is then given by     +     + @xmath132 which yields the fraction @xmath133 in the present case .",
    "it is nearly two orders of magnitude smaller than the critical fraction needed to cool the gas ( see figure 2 ) ; obviously , such gas can not cool .",
    "we generalize the above argument using the larger box simulation run a. we turn on a uniform background radiation field with @xmath134 at @xmath124 and continue the run until @xmath52 .",

    "for this plot , we computed the equilibrium h@xmath14 abundance by accounting for the fact that gas densities in small halos are smaller than the universal baryon fraction times the mean matter density within halos , because of gas pressure ( loeb & barkana 2001 ) .",
    "the dashed line in figure [ plot9 ] thus appears to steepen toward the low temperature end .",
    "the agreement with the measured mean molecular fraction is quite good , although the simulated halos show a large scatter at high temperatures .",

    "the mean molecular hydrogen fractions drop by nearly an order of magnitude for a radiation field with @xmath119 = 0.01 .",
    "an order of magnitude higher radiative flux will make the mean molecular fraction even smaller and make primordial gas cooling very inefficient , as we have seen in figure [ plot8 ] .",
    "although our simulation results in the previous section highlighted a negative aspect of radiative feedback , the _ true _ importance of this effect remains somewhat uncertain , because of our oversimplified treatment of the background field .",
    "the optically thin assumption breaks down as dense gas clouds form , requiring that self - shielding be taken into account .",
    "however , the strength of self - shielding is a difficult question to address . for a static gas",
    "it is indeed significant , giving an effective shielding factor @xmath137 for molecular hydrogen column densities @xmath138 @xmath13 ( drain & bertoldi 1996 ) . for a gas with extremely large velocity gradients and disordered motion ,",
    "the gas remains nearly optically thin even for column densities @xmath139@xmath13 ( glover & brand 2001 ) . since the full treatment of three - dimensional radiative transfer for 76 lw lines , even when only the lowest energy level transitions are included , is practically intractable ( see , however , ricotti et al .",
    "2001 for one - dimensional calculations for a stationary gas ) , we adopt the following approximate method to estimate the maximum effect of self - shielding . we consider only shielding by gas in virialized regions and do not consider absorption by the igm in underdense     +      + regions , assuming that the amount of residual intergalactic h@xmath5 is negligible .",
    "although this is not true initially , the intergalactic h@xmath5 fraction quickly decreases after the very first stars appear ( haiman , abel & rees 2000 ) . on the other hand , the so - called  saw - tooth \" modulation of background radiation owing to neutral hydrogen lyman series absorption ( haiman et al .",
    "1997 ) is substantial in the lyman - werner band because neutral hydrogen is abundant at very high redshifts .",
    "nevertheless , we do not consider the evolution and attenuation of radiation and we fix the radiation intensity as an input , rather than computing it consistently from actual star formation .",
    "thus the assigned intensity may be regarded as that after the radiation is attenuated by intergalactic neutral hydrogen .",

    "we use the local molecular hydrogen abundance and     + density to obtain an estimate for the column density around the @xmath141-th gas particle according to @xmath142 where @xmath143 is the position of the @xmath141-th gas particle and @xmath144 is the length scale we choose in evaluating the column density . in practice , we select an arbitrary line - of - sight and sum the contributions from neighboring gas particles within @xmath144 by projecting an sph spline kernel for all the neighboring particles whose volume intersects the sight - line .",
    "we repeat this procedure in six directions along x , y , and z axes centered at the position of the @xmath141-th particle and take the _",

    "it should be emphasized that the above expression for the shielding factor is derived for a stationary gas , and thus the actual effect of self - shielding could be substantially smaller because of gas velocity gradients and disordered motions , as discussed in machacek et al .",

    "we again use run a. similar to the optically thin case , we turn on a background radiation field with @xmath154 at @xmath124 , and compute self - shielding factors for all the over - dense gas particles ( hence for virtually all the gas particles in virialized regions ) .",

    "then , the total emissivity is given by @xmath184 where @xmath185 is the emissivity per star and @xmath186 and @xmath187 are the number of active stars and the number of star - forming gas clouds at redshift @xmath188 , respectively .",
    "our next task is to compute the number of star - forming gas clouds in the simulation box .      using the outputs of run dm",
    ", we locate dark halos in the same manner as described in section 2 and construct a halo merger tree by tracing the formation history of individual halos ( see yoshida et al .",
    "2002 for details ) .",
    "we then employ a simplified , yet physically motivated , prescription for the cooling of primordial gas within dark halos , which is also based on the results presented in the previous sections .",
    "for all the halos at a particular redshift , we judge whether the gas within them can cool by determining if abundant numbers of hydrogen molecules have formed .",
    "specifically , we adopt the following criteria for a halo to be star - forming : ( 1 ) the mean molecular hydrogen fraction is greater than the critical molecular hydrogen fraction , and ( 2 ) the recent mass growth rate of the halo is smaller than the critical mass growth rate",
    ". it might seem that an even simpler criterion @xmath189 suffices for halos at a given mass .",
    "while such a model could work approximately if there is no evolving background radiation , we prefer following the merger history explicitly .",
    "it is important to specify _ when _ the gas in a halo cools , because the coupling of the increasing radiation flux with star formation makes the onset time of gas cooling critical .",
    "the above cooling criteria can be formulated as @xmath190 and @xmath191 where @xmath192 is a function of the background radiation intensity @xmath193 , the virial temperature @xmath164 , and redshift @xmath188 .",
    "we compute @xmath192 using the asymptotic molecular fraction ( equation [ 17 ] in tegmark et al .

    "the critical molecular fraction , @xmath196 , is computed for the virial temperature @xmath164 and the density of the gas within a halo .",
    "we approximate the instantaneous dynamical heating rate of a halo from its mass increase since the previous output time .",
    "the choice of the time interval for measuring the mass increase remains somewhat arbitrary .",
    "obviously , it should not exceed either the characteristic gas cooling time or the dynamical time .",
    "we take a conservative value of 3 myrs for the time interval , which satisfies these requirements for most of the halos .",
    "it should be noted that our model does not trace the accumulation of cold dense gas .",
    "cold gas clouds can gradually grow in mass over a long time scale .",
    "however , describing the evolution requires specifying the gas density profile and local temperatures in a halo at a given time . instead of following such a complicated procedure ,",
    "our model simply specifies the time when an enough amount of cold gas ( @xmath197 ) is accumulated .",
    "we applied this model to our run a by discarding gas particles and using only the dark matter particles with the particle mass scaled appropriately .",
    "we followed the halo formation history and applied the model to it . in figure [ plot14 ]",
    "we plot the computed number of star - forming halos against redshift . we compare it with the number of the gas clouds found in run a. the good agreement is encouraging .",
    "we have also checked that not only do the total numbers of gas clouds agree , but that there is nearly a one - to - one match between the star - forming halos in our sph simulation and those identified by our semi - analytic model . for reference , the number of halos with mass greater than @xmath198 is also shown in figure [ plot14 ] ( dotted line ) .",
    "the simple minimum - mass model over - predicts the number of star - forming clouds by up to a factor of three .",
    "it is worth mentioning that , in some previous works ( e.g. mackey et al . 2003 ) , the critical virial temperature for primordial gas cloud formation was taken to be 400 k. in figure [ plot14 ] we plot the number of halos with virial temperature larger than 400 k. it predicts more than an order of magnitude larger ( nearly two orders of magnitude at @xmath199 ) number of star - forming regions .",
    "this over - estimate of the number of star - forming regions would result in a substantial overestimate for the star - formation rate and associated supernova rate .",
    "we now couple the formation of the first stars to the evolution of the background fuv radiation so that we can predict the global star formation rate .",
    "starting from the earliest output at @xmath200 , we identify star - forming regions in the manner described in section 8.2 , assuming initially that the background radiation intensity is zero . in run",
    "dm the first star - forming region appears at @xmath201 .",
    "we then determine the total emissivity within the simulation box and compute a frequency - dependent radiation flux at the _ next _ timestep according to equation ( [ eq_jevol2 ] ) . at every timestep , we average the radiation intensities over frequency in the lyman - werner band .",
    "then , a constant radiation field with the average intensity is ( assumed to be ) applied .",
    "namely , the mean intensity @xmath202 is used to compute the molecular hydrogen fraction in halos using equations ( [ eq_eq ] ) and ( [ eq_k31 ] ) , and then the cooling criteria described in section 8.2 are checked for all the halos .",
    "figure [ plot15 ] shows the evolution of the background radiation intensity @xmath202 and the spectrum of the processed radiation field @xmath203 in the lyman - werner band at @xmath204 .",
    "the evolution of the radiation intensity is computed for two cases , one in the optically thin limit ( filled circles ) and the other with gas self - shielding ( open squares ) , as described in section 7 .",

    "@xmath13 hz@xmath12 str@xmath12 .",
    "the dissociation time scale for radiation with intensity below this level is @xmath206 myrs , and thus its effect on gas cooling remains quite subtle even in the optically thin case .",
    "when the radiation intensity is above this level , it dissociates hydrogen molecules quickly and suppresses primordial gas cooling .",
    "it indeed acts more efficiently in the optically thin case and quenches star - formation more strongly .",
    "suppressed star - formation makes the evolution of the background radiation slower than in the model with self - shielding , as seen in figure [ plot15 ] .",
    "interestingly , our model predicts that the mean background radiation intensity reaches a value     +     + @xmath116 erg s@xmath12 @xmath13 hz@xmath12 str@xmath12 only at @xmath91 .",
    "this is because , as is clearly seen in the bottom panel of figure [ plot15 ] , the hydrogen lyman - series absorption causes a substantial intensity decrease in the lyman - werner band . without the absorption ,",
    "the mean intensity would have been more than an order of magnitude higher .",
    "as we advance to lower redshifts using our model , some halos grow to have virial temperatures exceeding @xmath207 ( see figure [ plot13 ] ) . in principle , the gas should then cool via atomic hydrogen transitions even if hydrogen molecules are completely photo - dissociated .",
    "it is conceivable that a large halo will be formed through successive mergers in which molecular hydrogen cooling has never become efficient ( hutchings et al .",
    "2001 ) . however , we find that all the massive halos ( @xmath208 ) have a progenitor in which a star has already formed .",
    "our model     + assumes that star formation takes place only once in a halo and in its descendants during the redshift range we consider .",
    "this crudely mimics the strong radiative feedback effect due to photo - dissociation and photo - heating ( omukai & nishi 1999 ; shapiro et al .",
    "1997 ) in the vicinity of the first stars .",
    "since the physical time between @xmath209 and @xmath210 is about 100 million years , the strong radiative feedback likely suppresses subsequent star formation over a significant fraction of this period ( yoshida , abel & hernquist 2003 ) , unless additional processes such as metal dispersal by supernovae are invoked .",
    "finally , we use the number of stars formed to measure the conventional comoving star formation rate ( sfr ) density , @xmath181yr@xmath12mpc@xmath211 .",
    "figure [ plot16 ] shows our model prediction for the comoving pop iii star formation rate .",
    "we compare two cases by setting the mass of a pop iii star to be either @xmath212 ( filled circles , model m100 ) or @xmath213 ( open squares , model m600 ) .",
    "we take a value of @xmath214 for the maximum pop iii star mass from omukai & palla ( 2003 ) . for both cases we included gas self - shielding in the model .",
    "( thus model m100 in figure [ plot16 ] is the result from the same model as in figure [ plot15 ] . )",
    "the star - formation rate density gradually increases from @xmath215 and reaches a value @xmath216yr@xmath12mpc@xmath211 at @xmath72 .",
    "note that in figure [ plot16 ] the predicted sfr can be approximately scaled by the assumed stellar mass @xmath217 because of the straightforward unit conversion we used . in model m600 , the star - formation rate is then about 6 times larger than in model m100 .",
    "the coupling of star - formation to the evolution of the background radiation causes each to be regulated by the other ( wyse & abel 2003 ) . as more stars form ,",
    "the radiation intensity rises , which suppresses primordial gas cooling and hence the global star - formation rate .",
    "then , the evolution of the radiation field slows , maintaining the star formation rate at a moderate level .",
    "the flattening in the sfr for model m600 at @xmath218 is due to this regulation .",
    "it is more prominent in model m600 than in model m100 because the total emissivity per unit volume is larger in model m600 .",
    "we note that a characteristic feature of the population iii star - formation calculated by mackey et al .",
    "( 2003 ) is not seen in our result .",
    "their model assumes a sudden quenching of star - formation , which produces a prominent `` cliff '' in their figure 3 .",
    "the actual regulation of the star - formation due to lyman - werner radiation occurs in a more complex way as we have just described , and thus the suppression of the pop iii star - formation is seen as a flattening of the star - formation rate .",
    "intriguingly , the predicted sfr appears quite similar to the result of the highest resolution simulation for popiii stars by ricotti et al .",
    "( 2002a ) , even though their simulations and model assumptions differ from ours .",
    "ricotti et al .",
    "( 2002b ) presented extensive tests using a series of simulations and examined the effect of various parameters on the global star formation rate .",
    "they showed that an important parameter which influences the sfr at @xmath219 is , indeed , the size of the simulation volume .",
    "therefore , it is worth asking whether the finite box size of our simulation affects the overall results .",
    "while the mass resolution of run dm is enough for our purposes ( see the discussion at the beginning of this section ) , it is not clear if the simulated volume ( a cube of 1600@xmath23 kpc on a side ) contains a fair sample of star - forming regions .",
    "we address this issue using the press - schechter halo mass function .",
    "we have verified that the mass function of the dark matter halos is reasonably well - fitted by the press - schechter mass function in a mass range between @xmath220 , and in a redshift range @xmath221 , in agreement with jang - condell & hernquist ( 2001 ) at slightly lower redshifts .",
    "since our analytical model relies on a one - star - per - halo assumption , we use the total number of halos with mass greater than @xmath222 to test whether the abundance of large halos is consistent with the press - schechter prediction .",
    "figure [ plot17 ] shows the comoving number density of halos with mass greater than @xmath223 computed from the press - schechter mass function , in comparison with that found in run dm .",
    "they agree reasonably well and the incomplete sampling of the halo mass function due to the finite box size is appreciable only at @xmath224 .",
    "+ note also that the small discrepancy remaining at lower redshifts ( @xmath225 ) may be partly due to inaccuracies in the analytic mass function itself .",
    "simulating a larger volume could make the discrepancy smaller at @xmath226 , but it would not significantly alter our results because the star formation rate is not dominated by rare massive halos in our model .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the level of agreement shown in figure [ plot17 ] over the relevant redshift range is satisfactory .",
    "springel & hernquist ( 2003a ) and hernquist & springel ( 2003 ) recently studied the star - formation history of a @xmath0cdm universe using a set of numerical simulations and an analytic model .",
    "they found that the evolution of the star - formation rate can be well described by a simple functional form .",
    "their simulations include only the  normal - mode \" of star - formation in larger mass systems , where gas cooling occurs via atomic hydrogen and helium transitions , and the regulation of star - formation is governed by supernovae rather than radiation ( see springel & hernquist 2003b ) . despite these differences ,",
    "it is interesting to see how the two modes of star - formation compare at high redshift . in figure",
    "[ plot18 ] , we compare the star - formation at very high redshifts ( @xmath225 ) computed from our model and that of hernquist & springel ( 2003 ) for @xmath227 .",
    "we show the sfr for two cases with @xmath212 ( open circles ) and @xmath228 ( open squares ) .",
    "we also provide a simple functional fit in a similar spirit to springel & hernquist ( 2003a ) , @xmath229 in units of @xmath230 .",
    "the solid line in figure [ plot18 ] shows equation ( 23 ) for @xmath231 and the dot - dashed line is for @xmath212 .",
    "this simple fit describes the results of our full semi - analytic model reasonably well , as clearly seen in figure [ plot18 ] .",
    "the sfr of hernquist & springel ( 2003 ) begins just at @xmath232 , where our model prediction for the popiii star formation rate ends .",
    "the overall shapes of the sfr of the two modes appear remarkably similar , although this may be just a coincidence since the physical mechanisms governing star formation and its regulation are very different in these two regimes .",
    "we also note that feedback from the first stars formed at @xmath233 could affect small ( proto-)galaxy formation at @xmath234 by photo - heating , in the same way as we argued in section 8.3 .",
    "therefore it remains unclear how the transition from pop iii to `` ordinary '' star - formation takes place .",
    "this issue clearly merits further study .",
    "we have carried out cosmological simulations of primordial gas cloud formation and determined the basic properties of the first baryonic objects for the standard @xmath0cdm cosmology .",
    "the minimum collapse mass scale is set by the fraction of molecular hydrogen produced in the primordial gas in dark matter halos , which is primarily determined by the virial temperature of the system .",
    "our simulations reveal that the merging process of dark halos disturbs the formation and evolution of primordial gas clouds , and we detailed how such dynamical processes delay the cooling and collapse of the gas .",
    "we have also examined the impact of far ultra - violet radiation in the lyman - werner bands on the formation of primordial gas clouds .",
    "we have followed the cooling and condensation of the gas within the most massive halos in one of our simulations ( run c1 ) for a few cases with a constant intensity radiation in the optically thin limit . due to photo - dissociation of molecular hydrogen , gas cooling",
    "is suppressed for radiation with intensity @xmath235 .",
    "we showed that the evolution of the gas cloud is qualitatively well - understood using a spherical collapse model .",
    "we then implemented a technique to compute molecular hydrogen column densities in and around virialized regions in the simulations and computed the gas self - shielding factor in its maximum limit .",
    "we found that , with the help of self - shielding , primordial gas in large halos cools efficiently even when irradiated by fuv radiation with intensity @xmath236 .",
    "the overall effect of the external fuv radiation is to raise the minimum halo mass scale for efficient gas cooling .",
    "we quantified this effect using a large volume simulation ( run a ) and found that , in the optically thin limit , the influence of fuv radiation can be formulated using an equilibrium h@xmath5 abundance .",
    "furthermore , we found that gas self - shielding can also be described by defining an effective shielding factor in a simple manner .",
    "while our experiments in the two extreme cases , the optically thin limit and with maximal gas self - shielding , should bracket the true effect of gas self - shielding , a more detailed study is needed to obtain an accurate estimate of this process .",
    "a promising approach may be to discard high velocity gas elements in computing molecular hydrogen column densities ( simon glover , private communication ) .",
    "ideally , one would like to perform @xmath15-body hydrodynamic simulations with gas chemistry and radiation using a large number of particles to study the coupling of star formation to the evolution of the radiation field .",
    "unfortunately , to simulate a volume equivalent to our dark matter simulation run dm with the same resolution as our run a , would require at least @xmath237 particles .",
    "as an alternative , we developed a semi - analytic model for primordial gas cooling and gas cloud formation . by comparing our model predictions with the results of sph simulations , we found that the model reproduces the number of primordial gas clouds in the simulated volume very well .",
    "we then successfully applied it to outputs of a large @xmath15-body simulation . assuming a simple star formation - law , we have computed the star formation rate and the evolution of the background radiation at high redshift ( @xmath238 ) .",
    "we believe that our model can be used to reliably estimate the rate of events associated with star formation , such as supernovae and gamma - ray bursts .",
    "while our simulations include the physics needed to study basic properties of the first star - forming clouds , there are still a few additional mechanisms that could be important . an interesting possibility proposed by haiman et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and oh ( 2001 ) is that an early x - ray background could increase the number of free electrons in the igm and promote the production of hydrogen molecules .",
    "analytical estimates ( haiman et al . 2000 ) and numerical simulations ( machacek et al .",
    "2003 ) indicate , however , that the net effect is mild and the positive feedback by an x - ray background does not entirely compensate the negative feedback effect due to photo - dissociating lyman - werner radiation unless unreasonably high x - ray intensities are assumed .",
    "it thus appears that our model prediction for the star - formation rate should be robust , even without additional contributions from x - ray sources .",
    "it is probably more important to include direct radiative transfer effects from the first stars . in the present model ,",
    "we only crudely included the overall effect by quenching further star formation locally after the first star is formed .",
    "in our simulations we find that many gas clouds are located close to one another , with physical separations smaller than 10 kpc .",
    "these star forming clouds at high redshifts are , as we have shown , embedded in dark halos that are strongly clustered ( see figure [ plot1 ] ) .",
    "a single massive population iii star can ionize a large volume of the surrounding igm and thus can have considerable impact on the formation of the nearby gas clouds and stars . in a forthcoming paper",
    "we will study direct radiative transfer effects using ray - tracing simulations .",
