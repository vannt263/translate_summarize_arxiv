    "the recent discovery of the kondo effect in atomic - size contacts of the ferromagnets co , fe , and ni demonstrates how material properties can be changed by reducing the size of the sample . in that specific case",
    "magnetic order was quenched at the junction , enabling the kondo effect to take place @xcite .",
    "kondo scattering also seems to be behind the so - called zero - bias anomalies of point contacts of a wide variety of metals including magnets , nonmagnets , and even superconductors @xcite .",
    "the latter experiments revealed a systematic variation of the zero - bias anomalies as function of contact size .",
    "however , spear - anvil type contacts usually involve interfaces which can be degraded by oxidation or a residual h@xmath1o film , which is avoided by using mechanically controllable break junctions . here",
    "we report break junction experiments on the ferromagnet fe and compare them to those of non - magnetic cu .",
    "similar results were obtained for co , ni , al , and cd .",
    "the resistance @xmath2 of a point contact between two identical normal metals depends on the fermi wave number @xmath3 , the contact radius @xmath4 , and the temperature - dependent specific resistivity @xmath5 @xcite . here",
    "@xmath6 . in the ballistic limit",
    "electrons cross the contact region on straight trajectories and the first term dominates .",
    "the second term provides corrections due to electron scattering in the contact region , the so - called backscattering . according to the drude - sommerfeld theory @xcite",
    "the product of electrical resistivity and electron mean free path @xmath7 is a constant .",
    "therefore the temperature dependence of the contact resistance can be replaced by the energy or bias - voltage dependence at low temperature @xmath8 to extract @xmath9 .",
    "independent scattering processes can be separated if their respective mean free paths have different energy dependencies .",
    "this is the case for electron - phonon scattering , which sets in at energies above @xmath10mev , and kondo scattering at magnetic impurities that is efficient only at small energies .",
    "a kondo impurity polarizes the surrounding electrons , forming a @xmath11 large polarization cloud . here",
    "@xmath12 is the fermi velocity .",
    "the electrical resistivity @xcite @xmath13    \\label{pc - kondo}\\ ] ] due to scattering of electrons at kondo impurities depends on the kondo temperature @xmath14 and the effective spin @xmath15 .",
    "it reaches a maximum ( in the unitary limit ) of @xmath16 at low temperatures proportional to the impurity concentration @xmath17 ( impurities per conduction electron ) .",
    "even a single magnetic impurity can change dramatically the resistance of a point contact .",
    "we investigated mechanically - controllable break junctions at 1k in vacuum .",
    "lower temperatures down to 0.1k or higher ones up to 4.2k did not affect the results .",
    "cu is a non - magnetic normal metal and fe a band - ferromagnet with @xmath18k @xcite .",
    "the samples were made of wires with @xmath19 mm diameter .",
    "the wire was glued onto a flexible bending plate and a groove was cut into the wire with a sharp knife , abrasive paper , or a thin corundum blade to define the break position .",
    "after installation the radii of the unbroken contacts were about @xmath20 m .",
    "they had residual resistance ratios of approximately 25 , thus contacts down to about @xmath21 should be in the ballistic limit .",
    "figure [ kondo - fit ] shows the spectra of a ) a low - resistance and b ) a high - resistance fe contact together with th definition of the various parameters .",
    "differential resistance of two typical fe contacts at 1k .",
    "note the different scales .",
    "the spectra have been symmetrized .",
    "the thick grey lines are fits using equation [ pc - kondo ] with @xmath22 .",
    "the lower figure shows definitions for the contact resistance @xmath23 , the magnitude @xmath24 , and the width @xmath25 of the zero - bias anomaly . ]",
    "figure [ spectra ] displays two series of typical spectra of fe and cu contacts .",
    "low - resistance contacts usually showed the zero - bias anomaly , unless it was hidden in the background noise , together with the typical features of electron - phonon interaction that indicate ballistic transport . when the contact radius was reduced and the resistance increased , the relative magnitude of the zero - bias anomaly grew and , at the same time , the spectroscopic features of electron - phonon interaction became suppressed . in few cases we found an inverted zero - bias anomaly , a minimum , of comparable size as the maximum .",
    "its origin is unclear - possibly it is caused by an accidental fabrication of a tunnel junction - and because it was only rarely observed we could not study it in detail .",
    "very often the zero bias peaks showed multiple sub - structures , like some of the contacts in figure [ spectra ] , that looked like resonances .",
    "typical @xmath26 spectra of fe and cu break junctions at 1k . to obtain the magnitude @xmath24 and width @xmath25 of the zero - bias anomaly the spectra",
    "were usually symmetrized first.,title=\"fig : \" ]   typical @xmath26 spectra of fe and cu break junctions at 1k . to obtain the magnitude @xmath24 and width @xmath25 of the zero - bias anomaly the spectra",
    "were usually symmetrized first.,title=\"fig : \" ]    figure [ magnitude ] summarizes the data . over a wide range of contact resistances the magnitude of the zero - bias anomaly @xmath27 for fe while cu has a systematically weaker @xmath28 dependence .",
    "these dependencies contrast the typical spectroscopic features like the electron - phonon interaction which vary as @xmath29 according to equation [ pc - backscatter ] .",
    "there is no noticeable transition between small and large contacts , indicating that the tiny zero - bias anomalies at small @xmath23 develop directly into the huge anomalies at large @xmath23 .",
    "thus the same mechanism is responsible for those anomalies , independent of the contact size . within the scattering of data points in figure [ magnitude ]",
    ", one can also recognize a trend towards larger widths when the resistance increases .",
    "magnitude @xmath24 as well as width @xmath25 of the zero - bias anomaly as function of resistance @xmath23 of fe and cu break junctions at 1k .",
    "the thick solid lines are @xmath30 and @xmath31 when the kondo length equals @xmath32 as discussed in the text .",
    "the thin solid lines indicate a smaller slope of @xmath33 and a kondo length @xmath34 .",
    "different symbols indicate different series of measurements . ]",
    "a single impurity in the unitary limit contributes @xmath35 to the magnitude of the zero - bias anomaly @xcite - the same as switching of a single conducting channel .",
    "this describes the experimental data for fe in figure [ magnitude ] quite well .",
    "the width of the anomalies varies between 1mv for large contacts and 100mv for small contacts , implying kondo lengths between @xmath36 m and 10 nm .",
    "this is about 100 times larger than the contact radius and supports the idea that a single impurity is responsible for the anomalies @xcite .",
    "kondo phenomena in small - scale devices have been observed , for example , for tunneling into a single magnetic atom on a metallic surface @xcite or in quantum - point contacts and quantum dots in a two - dimensional electron gas , where a single electron sits either in the dot @xcite or in a shallow potential minimum near the center of the point contact @xcite .",
    "transport through the constriction depends then on the spin of this single electron .",
    "we have suggested a similar picture that one or few electrons are trapped near the contact and polarize the conduction electrons in the contact region @xcite .",
    "another scenario has been suggested recently for atomic - size contacts of the ferromagnets fe , co , and ni that had only few conducting channels and resistances near @xmath37 .",
    "there the zero - bias anomalies were attributed to the kondo effect caused by the changed band structure at the contact @xcite . whether this could play a role in our experiments",
    "is unclear .",
    "we have found a reproducible dependence of the magnitude of the zero - bias anomalies as function of contact size for fe as well as for cu . if we accept that the kondo effect is possible at atomic - size fe contacts because ferromagnetism is quenched by the small size , it should also be possible in junctions of cu which is _ per se _ non - magnetic .",
    "making the contacts larger does not suppress the kondo effect , as it survives at least till the radii become larger than about 15 nm .",
    "we thank the jenny and antti wihuri foundation and the magnus ehrnroot foundation for financial support ."
