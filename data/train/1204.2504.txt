    "e. n. lorenz in @xcite demonstrated numerically the existence of certain three - dimensional flows that have a complicated behaviour .",

    "this interval map has a discontinuity at the point of the interval corresponding to @xmath1 , and is commonly called the _ lorenz map_.    we will start by defining what is known as the standard lorenz family .",
    "our work is a continuation of the study started in @xcite , and we will , therefore , make a conscientious effort to use the notation of @xcite so that it would be easier for the reader to compare the approach of this paper with that of @xcite .",
