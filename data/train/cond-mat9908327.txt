    "recently much attention has been focused on one - dimensional reaction - diffusion processes .",
    "these models can describe many physical phenomena such as hopping conductivity , growth processes and traffic flows [ 2 - 4 ] .",
    "they are also of interest from the mathematical point of view due to their relation to integrable quantum chain hamiltonians [ 5,6 ] .",
    "the simplest model of this kind is the asymmetric simple exclusion process ( asep ) with open boundaries [ 7 ] .",
    "this model comprise particles which jump independently to their right with hard core repulsion along a one - dimensional lattice .",
    "the open boundary conditions mean that particles are injected at one end of the lattice and are removed at the opposite end .",
    "this model exhibits a shock structure in the density profile of particles . in periodic boundary conditions",
    "case the microscopic location of the shock can be identified by defining a second class particle ( impurity ) .",
    "the asep in the presence of an impurity on a ring has been studied in the two following cases : + 1 ) in the first case , the single impurity hops in the opposite direction relative to the ordinary particles [ 8,9 ] . in this case",
    "a first - order phase transition between a low - density and a traffic jam phase is observed .",
    "+ 2 ) in the second case , the impurity moves in the same direction as the ordinary particles [ 1,17 ] .",
    "the phase diagram of this model consists of six distinctive phases ( i - vi ) in which two of them are symmetric to other phases under a charge conjugation and reflection symmetry .",
    "the authors have shown that one phase exists in the system in which the impurity causes a shock .",
    "+ another example of such driven diffusive systems is the partially asymmetric simple exclusion process ( pasep ) . in this model the particles",
    "are allowded to jump both to their immediate right ( with rate @xmath1 ) or left ( with rate @xmath0 ) site , if the target site is not already occupied .",
    "this model has been extensively studied both with open boundaries and on a ring [ 10 ] .    in this paper",
    "we will study the effects of the presence of a single impurity on the pasep on a ring . here",
    "the ordinary particles can hop to their immediate right ( left ) site , provided that it is empty , with rate @xmath2 @xmath3 .",
    "the single impurity can only hop to its immediate right site ( if it is not already occupied ) with rate @xmath4@xmath5 and can be exchanged from the left with the ordinary particles with rate @xmath6@xmath5 . for @xmath7",
    "this model reduces to the model ( 2 ) as discussed above . using matrix product ansatz ( mpa ) introduced in",
    "[ 11 ] , we obtain the relevant quadratic algebra which has both finite and infinite dimensional representations . for simplicity , we adopt a finite dimensional representation of the algebra and carry out all the calculations using a grand canonical ensemble in which the population of ordinary particles can fluctuate . by adjusting the fugacities of the ordinary particles and of the holes",
    ", one can produce some fixed densities for them .",
    "although the finite dimensional representation restricts us to the region under the surface @xmath8 in the three - dimensional parameter space , nevertheles we shall find the exact phase structure and calculate precisely the density profile of ordinary particles and the speed of impurity in this region . with this exact results , we will show that three phases exist in this region . in two of them , which are symmetric to each other under a charge conjugation and reflection symmetry",
    ", the density profile of particles has an exponential behavior .",
    "we will determine the relevant correlation lengths in these phases and the critical values of the rates that characterize the divergence of these correlation lengths .",
    "in the third phase the density profile of the ordinary particles is linear which is a signature of a shock .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we will describe the model . in section 3",
    "we will write the weights of the configurations in the stationary state in terms of a trace of @xmath9 non - commuting matrices and obtain the quadratic algebra . in section 4 we will introduce all possible representations of the quadratic algebra and discuss different phases in the accessible region of the phase space . in section 5 using one and two - dimensional representations of the algebra we will obtain some exact results for an infinite system . in the last section we will compare our results with those obtained in [ 1 ] for @xmath7 .",
    "the model proposed here contains two species of particles on a closed ring of @xmath9 sites which are labled from @xmath10 to @xmath9 .",
    "we specify each configuration of the system by an @xmath9-tuple @xmath11 , where @xmath12 if site @xmath13 is occupied with a particle of kind @xmath10 , @xmath14 if it is occupied with a particle of kind @xmath15 , and @xmath16 if site @xmath13 is empty .",
    "there are @xmath17 particles of kind @xmath10 , and only one particle of kind @xmath15 on the ring",
    ". we will refer to them as ordinary particles and impurity respectively .",
    "+ the system evolves under stochastic dynamics .",
    "the possible exchanges between two adjacent sites during a time interval @xmath18 is as follows : + @xmath19    the space of configuration is connected .",
    "each configuration can evolve into any other and therefore , it has a unique stationary state [ 18 ] . as we mentioned above , we will perform all the calculations in the grand canonical ensemble and let the number of ordinary particles fluctuate around a mean value .",
    "we will show that in the large @xmath20 limit the fluctuations in the density of ordinary particles drop to zero so that in this limit , the results of the canonical ensemble agree with those of the grand canonical ensemble . + the above process can be mapped onto the one introduced in [ 12 ] by interchanging the impurity and vacancies ( 2 @xmath21 0 ) .",
    "it can also be considered as a special case of the three - species diffusion problems introduced in [ 13 ] .",
    "according to the matrix product formalism , the stationary probability @xmath22 of any configuration @xmath23 can be written as a trace of a product of non - commuting operators . since",
    "this model is translationally invariant , one can always keep the single impurity at site @xmath9 and write the normalized weight @xmath24 in terms of three operators @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 : + p(\\ { } ) = p(\\ { _ 1 , _",

    ", one must choose the value of the fugacities to fix the density of ordinary particles to be @xmath30 .",
    "although it would be sufficient to introduce only one fugacity ( since the total number of sites `` @xmath9 '' is fixed ) , we use both of them to make the symmetry between ordinary particles and vacancies more apparent .",
    "the normalization factor @xmath31 in the denominator of eq.@xmath32 , which plays a role analogus to the partition function in equilibrium statistical mechanics , is a fundumental quantity and can be calculated using the fact @xmath33 .",
    "thus one finds + z_l = _ all  configurations tr [ _ i=1^l ( x _ i d+y(1-_i)e)a ] = tr(c^la ) + in which @xmath34 . the operators @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 satisfy the following quadratic algebra :    @xmath35    assuming that @xmath36 , eqs.(3 - 5 ) can be written in terms of @xmath37 and @xmath38 as follows    @xmath39    with this assumption , the calculation of @xmath40 in expression ( 2 ) reduces to the calculation of a matrix element    z_l = w c^l v    in the next section we will investigate all possible representations of ( 6 - 8 ) .",
    "in [ 14 ] the fock representation of the most general quadratic algebra has been obtained .",
    "it has been shown that in order to have a finite dimensional representation of certain quadratic algebras , the parameters of the model , say @xmath4 , @xmath6 and @xmath0 in ( 6 - 8 ) , should satisfy a set of constraints .",
    "+ the algebra ( 6 - 8 ) has a one - dimensional representation for @xmath41 , where the operators @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are represented by real numbers . here the vectors @xmath42 and @xmath43 can be discarded and one is dealing with a scalar product state in ( 9 ) .",

    "it can be verified that for @xmath48 , the region of the phase space which is accessible by the totaliy of all finite dimensional @xmath49 representations is    + + q<1    in fig.2 we have plotted ( 16 ) for two values of @xmath44 .",
    "one can see that as the dimension of representation increases from @xmath15 , the two - dimensional surface ( 16 ) begins to approach towards the @xmath0 axis .",
    "therefore the finite dimensional representation of the algebra ( 6 - 8 ) allows us to derive exact results for this model only on some special surfaces given by ( 16 ) . however using the same conjecture proposed in [ 15 ]",
    ", one can introduce a kind of analytical continuation to obtain results valid in the whole accessible region given by ( 17 ) .    in what follows",
    "we show that in the region specified by ( 17 ) , only three phases can exist and this result is independent of @xmath44 ( dimension of the representation ) .",
    "we now find the asymptotic behavior of ( 9 ) for large values of @xmath20 .",
    "note that the fugacity of ordinary particles @xmath28 and vacancies @xmath29 remain constant in this limit . in the thermodynamic limit @xmath50 , the behavior of @xmath31 is governed by the largest eigenvalue of @xmath51 .",

    "by using ( 18 ) one can see that in the regions @xmath67 and @xmath68 , @xmath51 is diagonalizable , so we expect that all correlation functions of form @xmath69 depend exponentially on the distances involved . in the region @xmath70 the eigenvalues of @xmath51 coincide    _",

    "hence it implies an algebraic behavior of all correlation functions ( see discussions in [ 16 ] ) . in the next section",
    "we will show this explicitly for a two - dimensional representation .",
    "+ the algebra ( 6 - 8 ) also has infinite dimensional representations [ 13 ] and by using them one has access to the entire phase space without any constraints on the parameters . since for these representations the calculations seem to be very difficult , we shall adopt one and two - dimensional representations to study the general behavior of some interesting quantities , such as the density profile of ordinary particles and the speed of impurity in different phases .",
    "as mentioned in the previous section , using @xmath44-dimensional representations @xmath49 , only the region @xmath71 is accessible , where three phases exist .",

    "using ( 21 ) , ( 23 ) and ( 26 ) the speed of impurity is found to be    v=-(1-q )    one may also note that for @xmath75 , ( 27 ) becomes negative i.e. the impurity starts moving backward .",
    "this can easily be understood from the fact that whenever an ordinary particle appears behind the impurity , it overtakes the impurity while pushing it backward ( see section 2 ) .",
    "thus , when the density of ordinary particles exceeds a critical value @xmath76 , a macroscopic negative current of impurity evolves in the system .",
