    "our milky way ( mw ) galaxy resides in a small group of galaxies called the local group ( lg ; e.g. , van den bergh 2000 ) .",
    "the three most massive galaxies in the lg are all spirals : the mw , the andromeda galaxy ( m31 ) , and the triangulum galaxy ( m33 ) , with mass ratios of @xmath14 ( e.g. , guo et al .  2010 ;",
    "van der marel et al .",
    "2012 , hereafter paper  ii ) . together",
    ", these galaxies dominate the lg mass .",
    "m33 lies at about the same distance as m31 ( @xmath15 ) , and these two galaxies most likely form a bound pair ( mcconnachie et al .",
    "2009 , hereafter m09 ; paper",
    "ii ) , as do the mw and m31 ( van der marel & guhathakurta 2008 ) .",
    "the orbits and interactions of the mw , m31 and m33 have been examined in several previous studies . for example , dubinski et al .",
    "( 1996 , hereafter d96 ) and cox & loeb ( 2008 , hereafter cl08 ) presented @xmath0-body simulations of the future mw - m31 interaction .",
    "loeb et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and m09 presented @xmath0-body simulations of the past m31-m33 interaction .",
    "innanen & valtonen ( 1977 ) used a newtonion few - body approach to study the future orbits of all three galaxies . and",
    "peebles et al .  ( 2011 ) used a cosmological few - body approach ( action modeling ) to study the past orbits of all three galaxies .",
    "what all previous work has had common is that the relative three - dimensional motion between m31 and either of the other two galaxies was treated as a free parameter .",
    "the line - of - sight velocities of m31 and m33 have long been well - known , and the proper motion of m33 was recently measured through water masers ( brunthaler et al .",
    "however , a proper motion measurement of m31 remained elusive .",
    "as a result , studies addressed and categorized possible past histories and future outcomes , but only for a limited subset of uncertain initial conditions .",
    "the present paper is the third and final paper in a series . in sohn",
    "( 2012 ; hereafter paper i ) we reported the very first proper - motion measurements of m31 stars in three different fields observed with the hubble space telescope ( hst ) . in paper",
    "ii we combined these measurements with other techniques , and with an updated understanding of the solar motion in the mw , to determine the three - dimensional velocity vector of the m31 center of mass ( com ) in the galactocentric rest frame .",
    "we also presented a combined analysis of the masses of the mw , m31 and m33 , based on literature results combined with a new application of the lg timing argument .    with the results from paper",
    "ii , all relevant dynamical quantities for the mw - m31-m33 system are known .",
    "the galaxy distances are known to @xmath16% ( measured as a fraction of the @xmath17 lg radius ) , and the positional uncertainties on the celestial sphere are negligible .",
    "the line - of - sight velocities are known to better than 1% , and the transverse velocities are known to @xmath18% ( measured as a fraction of the @xmath19 lg virial velocity ) .",
    "the galaxy masses are known to @xmath20% , and the radial mass profiles are reasonably well understood from cosmological simulations ( e.g. , klypin et al .",
    "hence , the calculation of the future dynamical evolution of the mw - m31-m33 system is now entirely deterministic .    the goal of the present paper is to determine the future dynamical evolution of the mw - m31-m33 system using @xmath0-body simulations , and to use semi - analytic orbit integrations to assess and quantify the variation in outcomes that is allowed by the observational uncertainties .",
    "this is the first study of this topic based on fully observationally constrained initial conditions .",
    "it is also the first study to include detailed models of m33 in calculations of the @xmath0-body evolution of the mw - m31 system .",
    "this allows us to study several unique features , including the possibility that m33 may collide with the mw before m31 does ( see section  [ ss : orbitclasses ] ) , the possibility that m33 may end up ejected from the lg ( see section  [ ss : orbitclasses ] ; also innanen & valtonen 1977 ) , and the possibility that m33 may accrete tidal debris from the mw - m31 interaction , potentially including the sun ( see section  [ ss : sunfate ] below ) .",
    "the most important result from paper  ii is that the velocity vector of m31 is statistically consistent with a radial ( head - on collision ) orbit towards the mw .",
    "the inferred galactocentric tangential velocity of m31 is @xmath21 , with 1@xmath22 confidence region @xmath23 .",
    "this significantly constrains the future dynamical evolution compared to what was known in the past .",
    "cosmological arguments about tidal torques from the local universe had merely constrained the @xmath24 to be @xmath25 ( e.g. , gott & thuan 1978 ; raychaudhury & lynden - bell 1989 ; peebles et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "no previous study has used an m31 velocity vector that is fully consistent with the currently available observational constraints .",
    "cl08 focused on initial conditions that provide a current m31 tangential velocity of @xmath26 ( their figure  6 ) .",
    "peebles et al .",
    "( 2011 ) proposed a model in which m31 has @xmath27 .",
    "d96 constructed models with low tangential velocities , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , which are consistent with our new observational constraints .",
    "however , they used a radial velocity @xmath30 , similar to cl08 s @xmath31 .",
    "both values yield a faster approach than the value @xmath32 that is implied by our latest understanding of the solar motion in the mw ( see section  4 of paper ii ) .",
    "the mw and m31 mass distributions used in past work are also not fully consistent with the currently available observational constraints .",
    "d96 constructed two sets of models , one in which @xmath33 and one in which @xmath34 , whereas the true mass is likely between these extremes ( see paper  ii ) .",
    "also , they adopted a ratio @xmath35 in all their models , while the actual ratio is likely closer to unity .",
    "for example , the lsr circular velocity @xmath36 km / s ( section  4.1 of paper ii ) is similar to the rotation velocity of hi gas in m31 ( e.g. , chemin et al .  2009 ; corbelli et al .",
    "cl08 used galaxy masses @xmath37 and @xmath38 , but then also added an intra - group medium of @xmath39 for consistency with the lg timing mass .",
    "however , recent insights ( summarized in paper ii ) suggest that the lg timing mass is an overestimate , consistent with cosmic scatter , so there is no need to force the models to match this mass exactly . the calculations we present here without an intra - group medium are likely to be more accurate",
    ".    we do not include in our study the effects of the lmc and smc , the next two most massive galaxies in the lg ( van den bergh 2000 ; grebel , gallagher , & harbeck 2003 ) .",
    "their combined mass is similar to that of m33 , making up @xmath10% of the mw mass .",
    "the orbit of these galaxies is such that they are moving rapidly away from the mw and may not return for many gyr ( besla et al .  2007",
    "; shattow & loeb 2009 ) .",
    "their motion is away from the direction towards m31 , to which they have never been close ( kallivayalil et al .",
    "their impact on the overall future dynamics of the mw - m31-m33 system is therefore likely to be small .",
    "the same is true for other lg dwarf galaxies , which have masses well below those of m33 and the combined lmc / smc .",
    "this includes , e.g. , m32 , another well - known m31 satellite . even though it is the next most luminous galaxy in the lg ,",
    "its luminosity is only about one - tenth of the luminosity of m33 .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows .",
    "section  [ s : methodology ] discusses the computational methodologies used for the @xmath0-body simulations and semi - analytic orbit integrations .",
    "section  [ s : canonical ] uses @xmath0-body simulations to calculate the future of the m31-mw - m33 system , using a canonical set of initial conditions that fall roughly midway in the observationally allowed parameter ranges .",
    "it discusses the structure of the galaxies as the simulation proceeds , and the possible fate of the sun .",
    "section  [ s : semicalc ] uses semi - analytic orbit integrations in a monte - carlo sense to assess how the orbital evolution of the mw - m31-m33 system changes when the initial conditions are varied within their observationally allowed ranges .",
    "it discusses characteristic pericenter and merger times , the fate of m33 ( including whether it collides with the mw before m31 does , or whether it is ejected from the lg ) , and constraints on the m33 orbit around m31 .",
    "section  [ s : conc ] summarizes the main conclusions .",
    "appendix  [ a : coulomb ] discusses the choice of coulomb logarithm in the dynamical friction formula used in the semi - analytic orbit integrations .",
    "we are concerned in this paper with the future dynamical evolution of the system composed of the mw , m31 , and m33 .",
    "we use two complementary methods to study this evolution , namely @xmath0-body simulations and semi - analytic orbit integrations .",
    "the @xmath0-body simulations allow us to study the evolution of each galaxy in detail , but due to computational restrictions , only a small set of possible initial conditions can be explored .",
    "the semi - analytic orbit integrations allow us to study only the approximate motion of the com of each galaxy .",
    "however , due to the speed of the semi - analytic method , it allows a full exploration of the parameter space of initial conditions . in the present section",
    "we describe the respective methodologies used for these calculations .",
    "we ran collisionless @xmath0-body simulations of the mw - m31-m33 system , including only stars and dark matter .",
    "the calculations were performed with the nbody smoothed particle hydrodynamics code , gadget-3 ( springel 2005 ) .",
    "typical numbers of particles used for the simulations are listed in table  [ t : galparam ] .    in each of the galaxies ,",
    "the gas comprises only a small fraction of the total galaxy mass .",
    "we therefore chose not to include the gaseous components of the galaxies in the simulations .",
    "this allowed us to run higher - resolution simulations with larger numbers of particles .",
    "this choice means that the overall dynamics of the interaction can be followed with accuracy , but that issues such as hydrodynamic effects , gas response , formation of gaseous streams , and star formation are not addressed here",
    ". it would not be difficult to include these effects in future numerical studies .",
    "cl08 did include gas and star formation in their simulations of the mw - m31 system .",
    "they found that the features thus induced are similar to what is normally seen in numerical simulations of spiral - galaxy mergers .",
    "initial conditions for the galaxies were set up in the galactocentric frame , defined in section  4 of paper  ii , with the mw starting at rest at the origin . the initial position and velocity vectors @xmath40 and @xmath41 for m31 and m33 , as well as the total virial masses @xmath42 for all galaxies , were chosen to be consistent with the observational results derived and summarized in paper  ii .",
    "different combinations of values were explored to produce different orbital configurations , as discussed in subsequent sections .",
    "the orientations of the galaxies , the scale lengths of their disks and bulges , and the bulge masses @xmath43 , were all chosen based on literature values , as summarized in table  [ t : galparam ] .",
    "disks of mass @xmath44 were set up with exponential profiles with scale length @xmath45 .",
    "warping , especially significant for m33 ( e.g. , corbelli & schneider 1997 ) , was ignored .",
    "bulges with mass @xmath43 were set up with @xmath46 profiles .",
    "the bulge effective radius was taken to be @xmath47 .",
    "m33 was taken to be bulgeless ; its nuclear component ( corbelli 2003 ) was ignored , since it contributes negligibly to the overall galaxy mass .",
    "to each galaxy we also added a massive central black hole of mass @xmath48 .",
    "for a given total galaxy virial mass @xmath42 , the virial mass of the dark halo was taken to be @xmath49 .",
    "the halo concentration @xmath50 for each galaxy was chosen to be consistent with cosmological simulations ( neto et al .  2007 ; klypin et al .",
    "the concentration @xmath50 is defined as @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the scale radius of the navarro , frenk & white ( 1997 ; hereafter nfw ) profile that approximates the dark halo .    in the simulations ,",
    "we represent the dark halo of each galaxy by a hernquist ( 1990 ) density profile , with total mass @xmath53 and scale length @xmath54 , with no adiabatic contraction .",
    "a hernquist profile is similar to an nfw profile , but it drops off more steeply at large radii .",
    "this has the advantage that the total mass is finite ( see discussion in springel et al .",
    "2005 ) , which is not the case for an nfw profile .",
    "for a given @xmath42 and @xmath50 we choose @xmath53 and @xmath54 so that the corresponding hernquist and nfw profiles have the same asymptotic density for @xmath55 , and the same enclosed mass within @xmath56 .",
    "the relevant equations are presented in appendix  a of paper  ii , to which we refer the reader for a discussion of the various density profiles , scale radii , and masses that are often encountered in the literature on dark halos .",
    "for example , if @xmath57 , then @xmath58 , and @xmath59 . the total mass of the hernquist model is larger than @xmath60 , with the excess corresponding to the mass that is contained at radii outside @xmath61 .    for given @xmath42 and @xmath50 ,",
    "the mass of the disk @xmath44 of each galaxy was chosen to optimize the fit to the observed amplitude of the galaxy rotation curve .",
    "for the mw we choose @xmath44 to produce a circular velocity @xmath62 at the solar radius ( mcmillan 2011 ) , consistent with the value used in paper  ii to correct the observed motions of m31 and m33 for the reflex motion of the sun .",
    "for m31 we choose @xmath44 to produce a maximum circular velocity @xmath63 ( corbelli et al .",
    "2010 ) , and for m33 we choose @xmath44 to produce a maximum circular velocity @xmath64 ( corbelli & salucci 2000 ) .",
    "the central black hole mass for each galaxy was taken to be @xmath65 , motivated by the average black hole demographics of galaxies .",
    "this does not yield a particularly accurate fit to the known bh masses for the three galaxies under study here ( @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 ; e.g. , gultekin et al",
    ".  2009 and references therein ) .",
    "however , this does not matter for the present application , since either way , the black holes have too little mass to influence the overall galaxy dynamics during the interactions . the black holes are included here primarily for numerical purposes , since they conveniently trace the com of the mostly tightly bound particles of each galaxy . initially this is the same as the com of the galaxy as a whole .",
    "however , this ceases to be true once the more loosely bound material becomes significantly disturbed .",
    "in the following when we discuss the evolution of the com position of a galaxy , we merely follow the position of its central black hole .",
    "when we discuss the evolution of the com velocity of a galaxy , we actually calculate a weighted average over the luminous particles near the black hole .",
    "our approach starts the @xmath0-body simulations at the present epoch , with initial positions and orientations reproducing the current conditions .",
    "this is similar to the approach of d96 , except that their adopted m31 distance @xmath69 is smaller than the currently favored value d = 770 @xmath70 40 kpc ( see paper  ii ) .",
    "by contrast , cl08 started their mw - m31 simulations 5 gyr ago .",
    "so their models were not tailored to exactly reproduce the observed location and spin orientation of m31 at the present time , and are correct only in a generic sense .",
    "while our calculations were performed in the galactocentric @xmath71 frame , we sometimes use a rotated set of coordinates with the same origin , @xmath72 as defined in section 6.1 of paper ii , to display the results of the orbit calculations .",
    "we refer to this coordinate system as the `` trigalaxy coordinate system '' .",
    "the @xmath73 plane , which we will refer to as the `` trigalaxy plane '' , is defined as the plane that contains all three of the galaxies mw , m31 and m33 at the present epoch .",
    "the @xmath74-axis points from the mw to m31 . as discussed in paper ii , all three galaxies start out in the @xmath73 plane , with velocity vectors that are close to this plane .",
    "this implies that the orbital evolution of the entire mw - m31-m33 system happens close to the trigalaxy plane , with the `` vertical '' @xmath75-component playing only a secondary role .",
    "for this reason , we show many of the three - dimensional orbits calculated in subsequent sections only in their two - dimensional ( @xmath76 projection .",
    "as mentioned , we also developed a semi - analytic method for calculating the future motions of the mw , m31 and m33 due to their mutual gravitational interaction . in this approximate method , each galaxy is represented by a fixed one - component gravitational potential , corresponding to a hernquist density profile .",
    "for given @xmath42 and @xmath50 , the total mass @xmath53 and scale length @xmath54 are calculated as described before .",
    "we write equations of motion that describe the position and velocity of the com of each galaxy ( i.e. , equations for 18 total phase coordinates , 6 each for 3 galaxies ) . to calculate the gravitational attraction in the equations of motion correctly",
    ", one would need to integrate over all particles in the galaxies . to simplify matters , we assume that the acceleration felt by a galaxy is as though all of its mass were concentrated at its com .",
    "thus , the gravitational acceleration felt by galaxy @xmath77 due to the hernquist potential of galaxy @xmath78 at distance @xmath79 equals @xmath80 .",
    "the forces thus implemented are non - symmetric and non - conservative .",
    "we therefore apply a small correction at every time - step to ensure that the net acceleration of the total com of the whole system remains zero .",
    "we also apply a constant density softening of @xmath81 at the center of each galaxy to avoid unphysical divergences .",
    "this softening is not a particularly significant additional simplification , given that the disks and bulges which dominate the gravitational potential at these radii are not explicitly represented by our one - component models either .    to include dynamical friction",
    ", we use the well - known chandrasekhar formula ( binney & tremaine 1987 ) . here too , we assume that the drag felt by a galaxy is as though all of its mass were concentrated at its com .",
    "the chandrasekhar formula is formally valid only for an infinite homogeneous medium of density @xmath82 and velocity distribution @xmath83 . for a galaxy",
    "@xmath77 undergoing friction from galaxy @xmath78 , we substitute the local @xmath82 and @xmath83 in galaxy @xmath78 , evaluated at the position of com@xmath84 . as usual ,",
    "we assume @xmath83 to be a gaussian of dispersion @xmath22 .",
    "the variation @xmath85 with radius in each galaxy was taken from hernquist ( 1990 ) .",
    "the dynamical friction is proportional to the coulomb logarithm @xmath86 , where @xmath87 and @xmath88 are the maximum and minimum impact parameter contributing to the friction .",
    "we choose an expression for the coulomb logarithm that uses and expands the parameterization proposed and tested by hashimoto et al .",
    "we calibrate this expression using a set of new @xmath0-body simulations .",
    "appendix  [ a : coulomb ] discusses the parameterization , the choice of parameters based on the new calibration , and the accuracy of the resulting semi - analytic orbit integrations .",
    "we first study a canonical model for the mw - m31-mw system with main characteristics summarized in table  [ t : norbits ] .",
    "for this model we adopt galaxy masses @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "these values are close to the midpoints of the observationally constrained probability distributions derived in paper  ii . for a given @xmath42",
    ", we calculate @xmath50 from the cosmological simulation correlation presented by klypin et al .",
    "the corresponding hernquist scale lengths , derived as described in section  [ ss : nmethod ] are @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "the disk masses adopted to produce the desired maximum circular velocities are listed in table  [ t : norbits ] .",
    "the resulting rotation curves are shown in figure  [ f : rotcurves ] .",
    "the mw is initially at rest at the origin of the galactocentric rest frame .",
    "the adopted positions @xmath93 and @xmath94 of m31 and m33 in the canonical model , respectively , are the best estimates from paper ii ( sections  4.2 and  6.1 ) , based on the known distances .",
    "the adopted velocity @xmath95 of m33 is the best estimate from paper  ii , based on the known line - of - sight velocity and proper motion .",
    "the adopted velocity @xmath96 of m31 is not exactly the best estimate from paper ii , but it agrees with it to better than @xmath97 in each coordinate direction ( about 1/3 of the observational error bars ) .",
    "the m31 line - of - sight velocity in the canonical model is as observed , while the transverse motion is @xmath98 . for comparison the best estimate from paper  ii is @xmath99 , but all values @xmath100 are consistent with the observational constraints at 68.3% confidence .- body simulations had already been run and analyzed , we decided not to redefine and recalculate a new canonical model . ]",
    "the total orbital angular momentum of the mw - m31 system is @xmath101 , where the sum is over the com properties of two galaxies .",
    "if one ignores for simplicity the roles of m33 and of dynamical friction , then this would be a conserved quantity . in the galactocentric rest frame ,",
    "the mw is initially at rest at the origin .",
    "hence , @xmath102 is simply proportional to the cross product @xmath103 of the initial m31 position and velocity vectors .",
    "we denote with @xmath104 the unit vector in the direction of @xmath102 .",
    "the unit vector in the direction of the mw spin angular momentum equals @xmath105 ( the sun rotates clockwise in the @xmath106 plane ) .",
    "the unit vector in the direction of the m31 spin angular momentum can be calculated from the position and viewing geometry of m31 ( see tables  [ t : galparam ] and  [ t : norbits ] ) , and equals @xmath107 .",
    "an encounter between two galaxies is prograde for a galaxy if its spin angular momentum is aligned with the orbital angular momentum , and it is retrograde if the two are anti - aligned .",
    "prograde encounters produce more distortion and longer tidal tails than retrograde encounters ( e.g. , toomre & toomre 1972 ) .",
    "the angle between the orbital and spin angular momentum for galaxy @xmath78 equals @xmath108 .",
    "an angle @xmath109 corresponds to a situation in which the orbital plane and the galaxy plane are perpendicular .",
    "smaller angles correspond to prograde encounters , and larger angles to retrograde encounters .",
    "an angle @xmath110 corresponds to an in - plane prograde encounter , and an angle @xmath111 corresponds an in - plane retrograde encounter .",
    "table  [ t : norbits ] lists the @xmath112 angles for the canonical model .",
    "they are @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "therefore , both galaxies undergo a prograde encounter in this model .",

    ", the spin axis is almost perpendicular to the mw - m31 orbital plane .      the orbital evolution for the canonical model , following the com of each galaxy , is shown in figures  [ f : canonorb ] , [ f : canonsep ] , and  [ f : canonvel ] .",

    "the m33 orbit decays slowly due to dynamical friction , which should eventually lead to a merger with the m31-mw merger remnant .",

    "the transient disk features decrease as the disk secularly evolves through angular momentum exchange and disk heating .",
    "we wished to minimize the impact of the initial disk instability , given our interest to study the future dynamical evolution of the candidate suns .",
    "we therefore evolved the mw in isolation for @xmath144 before starting the actual simulation , and did the same for m31 and m33.-body simulations discussed in appendices  [ aa : firstm33 ] and  [ aa : retrograde ] below .",
    "those simulations therefore still show the initial disk instabilities .",
    "] nonetheless , some secular evolution continues throughout the simulation .",
    "the snapshot at @xmath141 therefore corresponds to a slightly different equilibrium than the initial mw disk .",
    "it is in principle possible to obtain a more stable initial axisymmetric disk solution by changing the dark halo or bulge properties .",
    "however , the mw does in fact posses a bar ( e.g. , binney et al .",
    "1997 ) , so it is not immediately obvious that this would produce a more realistic mw .",
    "we therefore decided not to explore alternative models with more stable disks .",

    ". the galaxies partially overlap at this time .",
    "the galaxy spins are such that the encounter is prograde for both galaxies .",
    "however , the relative velocity between the galaxies is large , so that the immediate damage they inflict on one another is limited . at this time",

    "the past com orbits of m31 and m33 are indicated with dotted curves .",
    "panel ( c ) shows the situation at the time @xmath146 , when m31 is getting close to its first apocenter with mw . due to the prograde nature of the encounter ,",
    "stars are thrown out of both galaxies along extended tidal tails .",
    "the tails are roughly bisymmetric .",
    "the tails are more prominent for the mw , since its encounter is more prograde than for m31 ( see d96 for a detailed study of the formation of tidal tails in the mw - m31 interaction , and how their development depends on model parameters ) .",
    "m33 has just passed its second pericenter with m31 , the first one having happened when the galaxies were still far from the mw ( at @xmath121 ) .",
    "also , m33 has just passed its first apocenter with the mw , and is now starting to fall back onto it . due to tidal perturbations from both m31 and the mw ,",
    "m33 has developed the pronounced s - shaped structure that is characteristic of tidal stripping of a satellite ( e.g. , odenkirchen et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "panel ( d ) shows the situation at the time @xmath147 when m31 has passed its second pericenter with the mw , and is now at its second apocenter .",
    "the galaxies are separated now by only @xmath148 , and the process of merging has started . at this time m33 , is also approximately at its second apocenter with respect to the mw . however , its separation from the mw is still @xmath149 .",
    "panel ( e ) shows the situation at the time @xmath150 , approximately @xmath151 after the two galaxies have merged .",
    "the structure of the mw - m31 remnant is highly asymmetric and unrelaxed at this time .",

    "panel ( f ) shows the situation at the time @xmath154 , which is when the simulation was stopped .",
    "the mw - m31 remnant has had several gyr to relax dynamically , and its structure has become fairly smooth and symmetric , resembling an elliptical galaxy .",
    "the original mw and m31 stars have mixed throughout the remnant .",
    "m33 still orbits the remnant on an elliptical , precessing , and slowly decaying orbit .",

    "tidally stripped stars from m33 contribute to the halo of the mw - m31 remnant .",
    "however , m33 is still easily recognizable as a separate galaxy , and this has in fact remained the case throughout the entire simulation .",
    "the three panels of figure  [ f : rembygal ] show the distribution of luminous particles at the end of the simulation for the three different galaxies . the mw and m31 particles have become mixed around a common com",
    ". however , the remnant is not yet fully relaxed , since particles originating from the two different galaxies still have a somewhat different spatial distribution .",
    "this is evident both from a difference in ellipticity near the center , and from a difference in the structure of shells and tails at large radii .",
    "the distribution of m33 stars at the end of the simulation is markedly different from that of the mw and m31 stars .",
    "m33 still largely maintains its own identity in a bound core .",
    "however , 23.5% of its luminous particles have been tidally stripped and are now located outside the m33 roche radius ( @xmath156 at the end of the simulation ) .",
    "these stripped particles occupy wrapped streams that populate the halo of the mw - m31 merger remnant .",
    "these streams do not lie along the location of the orbit , primarily due to a combination of two effects .",
    "first , particles continue to be affected by m33 s gravity even after they have been stripped ( choi , weinberg , & katz 2007 ) . and",
    "second , stripped stars have a velocity component out of the orbital plane since the m33 disk is not aligned with that plane .",
    "comparison of figure  [ f : canonsnaps]f to  [ f : canonsnaps]a shows that the mw - m31 merger remnant is significantly more radially extended than its progenitor galaxies .",
    "figure  [ f : remnant ] shows the projected surface density profile of luminous mw and m31 particles in the remnant at the end of the simulation ( @xmath131 ) .",
    "the profile roughly follows an @xmath46 profile at radii @xmath157 , characteristic of elliptical galaxies .",
    "this is consistent with the large literature supporting the assertion that roughly - equal mass mergers of spiral galaxies form remnants that can be classified as elliptical galaxies ( e.g. , barnes 1998 ) .",
    "however , what fraction of ellipticals form this way remains an open question ( e.g. , naab & ostriker 2009 , and references therein ) .",
    "both the mw and m31 are fairly typical spirals in our simulations .",
    "there is therefore no reason to expect the properties of the merger remnant to be very different from what has been found generically for mergers of spiral galaxies .",
    "indeed , cl08 studied the merger remnant in their mw - m31 simulations in some detail , and found its properties to be consistent with those of elliptical galaxies .",
    "while their simulations differ from ours in a number of key areas ( see discussion in section  [ s : intro ] ) , there is no particular reason to expect that this would change the _ generic _ features of the remnant . for these reasons ,",
    "we do not present a detailed analysis of the merger remnant in our simulations .",
    "such an analysis might have included a characterization of triaxiality , ellipticity , boxyness / diskyness , fundamental - plane position , rotation rate , and deviations of velocity distributions from gaussians ( e.g. , naab & burkert 2003 ; naab , jesseit , & burkert 2006 ; cl08 ) .",
    "these characteristics can all be compared to what is observed for samples of ellipticals .",
    "nonetheless , even without such a study , it seems clear that the cl08 conclusion that the mw - m31 merger remnant should resemble an elliptical galaxy still holds .      as in cl08",
    ", it is of interest to address what the future fate of the sun might be as the mw - m31-m33 system evolves .",
    "we do this by identifying `` candidate suns '' in the simulation , and by following their fate as time progresses .",
    "we identify the candidate suns from their phase space properties at time @xmath158 in the simulation , well before m31 and m33 arrive near the mw .",
    "candidate suns are not identified at the start of the simulation in order to minimize the impact of transient initial features in the mw disk .",
    "we probably do not understand the secular evolution of the mw well enough to predict how the phase space coordinates of the real sun will change over the next @xmath159 , so we neglect any such evolution .",
    "also , we can not predict at what azimuth in the @xmath135 plane the sun will be @xmath159 from now .",
    "the sun is at @xmath160 from the galactic center , and the circular velocity at this radius is @xmath161 ( see discussion in paper ii ) .",
    "hence , @xmath162 from now the sun will have made @xmath163 orbital revolutions .",
    "a @xmath164% uncertainty in the circular velocity , which is fairly realistic , therefore produces a @xmath165 uncertainty in azimuth .",
    "based on these considerations , we identify as candidate suns those particles in the simulated mw at @xmath166 that : ( a ) are within @xmath167 from the circle @xmath168 in the equatorial plane ; ( b ) have an in - plane velocity @xmath169 that agrees with @xmath170 at @xmath168 to within @xmath171 ; and ( c ) have an out - of - plane velocity that satisfies @xmath172 .",
    "a total of 8786 luminous particles meet these criteria , i.e. , 1.0% of the total .",
    "our criterion for identification of candidate suns is more strict than that of cl08 , who selected particles at the solar radius irrespective of velocity .",
    "the candidate suns are shown in red in the simulation snapshots of figure  [ f : canonsnaps ] , and also in the movies distributed with this paper ( but only for @xmath173 ) .",
    "they start out as a ring of particles in panel ( a ) . but due to violent relaxation and phase mixing they end up distributed throughout the merger remnant at the end of the simulation in panel ( f ) .",
    "figure  [ f : remnant ] shows the projected surface density profile of the candidate suns in the mw - m31 merger remnant at the end of the simulation .",
    "the profile is somewhat less centrally concentrated than the surface - density profile of all particles in the remnant .",
    "hence , a candidate sun resides on average at a larger radius in the remnant than an average particle .",
    "this is because the sun is initially not particularly tightly bound within the mw .",
    "since the initial and final binding energies of a particle in an interaction are correlated , this also remains true at the end of the simulation in the mw - m31 remnant .",
    "figure  [ f : sunhist ] shows the radial distribution of candidate suns with respect to the center of the mw - m31 remnant , at the end of the @xmath0-body simulation ( @xmath131 ) for the canonical model .",
    "all the candidate suns initially start out at @xmath174 . at the end of the simulation ,",
    "14.6% of the candidate suns reside at @xmath175 and 85.4% at @xmath176 . a fraction 10.4% reside at @xmath177 and a fraction 0.1% at @xmath178 .",
    "therefore , our actual sun will most likely migrate outward during the merger process , compared to its current distance from the galactic center ( consistent with the earlier findings of cl08 ) .",
    "there is a small but significant probability that the sun will migrate out to very large radius .",
    "however , no candidate suns become entirely unbound from the mw - m31 merger remnant in the simulation .",
    "the radial distribution of candidate suns in figure  [ f : sunhist ] pertains to a snapshot at a fixed time .",
    "while this distribution is reasonably stable with time , this does not mean that each individual candidate sun remains at a fixed radius .",
    "each individual candidate sun orbits the mw - m31 merger remnant , so its radial distance from the center is time - dependent .",
    "this is true in particular for candidate suns that move out to large distances , since those tend to be on relatively radial orbits .",
    "so even if a candidate sun resides far from the center of the merger remnant for most of the time , it may find itself plunging rapidly through the central region at regular intervals .",
    "the distributions of orbital pericenters , apocenters , semi - major axis lengths , or time - averaged distances could in principle be calculated for the solar candidates , and those would differ from the distribution in figure  [ f : sunhist ] .",
    "some of the candidate suns migrate out far enough to overlap with the range of radii where m33 orbits the mw ( or the mw - m31 merger remnant ) after @xmath179 ( see figure  [ f : canonsep ] ) .",
    "it is therefore theoretically possible that candidate suns could be accreted by m33 .",
    "however , m33 moves rapidly around the mw ( see figure  [ f : canonvel ] ) , and its orbit is very different from that of typical stars in the mw , even those ejected into tidal tails .",
    "therefore , most candidate suns that pass close to m33 will undergo flyby encounters , and will be not be accreted by m33 ( i.e. , become bound ) . in the canonical model , none of the 8786 candidate suns became bound to m33 .",
    "this sets an upper limit of @xmath180 to the probability of the sun ever becoming bound to m33 .    while the probability of candidate suns becoming bound to m33 is small , the probability is larger that a candidate sun might find itself temporarily inside m33 . for each candidate sun in the simulation we studied whether it ever came within 10 kpc of the m33 com ( despite m33 always being more than @xmath181 from the mw com throughout the simulation",
    "; see figure  [ f : canonsep ] ) .",
    "a total of 1762 candidate suns met this criterion over the @xmath12 of the simulation .",
    "therefore , the probability is 20.1% that the sun will at some time in this future period find itself moving through m33 , although dynamically still being associated with the mw - m31 remnant .",
    "the initial conditions used for the canonical orbital scenario in section  [ s : canonical ] form only one of many possibilities that are consistent with the observational uncertainties on the galaxy masses and phase - space coordinates derived in paper  ii .",
    "we therefore used a monte - carlo scheme to create @xmath182 initial conditions that explore the full parameter space of possibilities .",
    "table  [ t : orbits ] lists the observational and theoretical constraints on the galaxy masses , halo concentrations , and initial phase - space coordinates that were used to generate the initial conditions .",
    "we studied the orbital evolution for each set of initial conditions , and determined the probability @xmath183 with which certain orbital features occur ( e.g. , a direct hit between galaxies ) . if a feature occurs in @xmath184 orbits , then @xmath185 with random uncertainty @xmath186 . for @xmath182 , @xmath187% yields @xmath188% , and @xmath189% yields @xmath190% . for larger",
    "@xmath0 , parameter space would be explored more fully and the random uncertainties @xmath191 would be smaller . however , systematic uncertainties due to the simplifying assumptions that underly the semi - analytic calculations would stay the same . since these likely dominate the random uncertainties , we decided that @xmath182 was sufficient .",
    "the initial masses @xmath42 for the galaxies were drawn as in section  5 of paper ii .",
    "this combines observational constraints on the masses of the individual galaxies , with the timing - argument constraints on the total mass of the mw and m31 ( including cosmic scatter , following li & white 2008 ) . at given @xmath42",
    ", we calculate @xmath50 from the cosmological simulation correlation presented by klypin et al .",
    "we add a random scatter of @xmath192 dex in @xmath193 , consistent with the simulations of neto et al .",
    "( 2007 ) .",
    "the initial phase - space coordinates of m31 and m33 were drawn as in sections  4.2 and  6.1 paper  ii , respectively , based on the observed positions , distances , line - of - sight velocities , and transverse velocities .",
    "thus employed , this scheme propagates all observational distance and velocity uncertainties and their correlations , including those for the sun .    for each set of initial conditions , we calculated the binding energies of the mw - m31 and m33-m31 systems , respectively .",
    "the mw - m31 system was found to be bound in all cases .",
    "this is as expected , since an unbound chance encounter of two galaxies like the mw and m31 would be quite unlikely given the local density of spiral galaxies ( van den bergh 1971 ) .",
    "the m33-m31 system was found to be bound in 95.3% of cases .",
    "there is observational evidence from both hi ( braun & thilker 2004 ) and star count maps ( m09 ) for tidal features indicative of past interactions between these two galaxies .",
    "m09 have argued that m33 and m31 _ must _ be bound for the observed tidal features to have formed .",
    "this is the approach that we will take here .",
    "so as in section 6.3 of paper  ii we remove from consideration the small subset of initial conditions in which m33 and m31 are not bound .",
    "figure  [ f : prograde ] shows the distributions of @xmath194 and @xmath195 for the initial conditions , being the angles between the galaxies initial spin and orbital angular momenta as defined in section  [ ss : prograde ] .",
    "both distributions are quite broad . for the mw , 72.2% of the orbits are prograde , and 27.8% are retrograde . for m31 ,",
    "59.0% of the orbits are prograde , and 41.0% are retrograde .",
    "so for both galaxies , a prograde encounter is the most likely outcome , but not by a large factor . for m31 ,",
    "41.4% of orbits have @xmath196 , so that nearly orthogonal encounters are quite probable . for the mw ,",
    "this fraction is only 28.0% .",
    "based on these considerations , the initial mw - m31 encounter will generally perturb the mw more strongly than m31 , as was the case in the canonical model ( see section  [ ss : canonmerger ] ) .",
    "the reason that both prograde and retrograde encounters are possible is that the m31 velocity is directed almost radially towards the mw .",
    "hence , the orbital angular momentum is small , and its direction is poorly determined .",
    "specifically , one may consider the m31 transverse velocity space @xmath197 , in which one value @xmath198 corresponds to the velocity vector for a radial orbit ( see figure  3 of paper  ii ) .",
    "most of the velocities inside the observational error ellipse lie on one side of @xmath198 , and those yield a prograde encounter for the mw .",
    "however , some of the velocities lie on the other side of @xmath198 , and those yield a retrograde encounter for the mw .      for each of set of monte - carlo generated initial conditions we calculated the future orbital evolution of the mw - m31-m33 system with the semi - analytic orbit - integration method of section  [ ss : semianmethod ] .",
    "all orbits were integrated for a sufficiently long time to be able to quantify and classify the future evolution .",
    "for all orbits we determined the same characteristic quantities ( pericenters , apocenters , merging times , etc . ) as discussed in section  [ ss : canonevol ] .    for all initial conditions",
    ", m33 is moving towards m31 at the present time , albeit with a significant tangential component ( see e.g. top left panel of figure  [ f : canonorb ] , and section  6.1 of paper ii ) .",
    "m31 is moving towards the mw , and is pulling m33 with it .",
    "each pair of galaxies is therefore heading for a pericenter passage .",
    "figure  [ f : thist]a shows histograms of the times of these pericenter passages , and figure  [ f : thist]b shows histograms of the corresponding pericenter distances .",
    "figure  [ f : thist]c shows a histogram of the times at which the mw and m31 merge .    for the mw - m31 system ,",
    "the first - pericenter time and distance are @xmath199 and @xmath200 . here and henceforth ,",
    "values quoted for a quantity refer to the median and surrounding @xmath201% confidence regions in the monte - carlo distribution . in 41.0% of orbits the mw - m31 first - pericenter distance is less than 25 kpc . taking into account the sizes of the galaxy disks , we consider this arbitrary cutoff to denote a `` direct hit . '' ) . hence",
    ", a direct hit does not necessarily mean that the densest central parts of the galaxies are colliding .",
    "however , all three galaxies have disks that extend to many exponential scale lengths .",
    "for example , the stars in the m31 disk can be traced to beyond 20 kpc ( courteau et al .",
    "2011 ) and the hi gas to some 40 kpc ( corbelli et al .",
    "in m33 , the smallest of the three galaxies , the stars in the disk can be traced to at least 4 kpc ( kent 1987 ) and the hi gas to some 15 kpc ( corbelli & schneider 1997 ) .",
    "] this high fraction is no surprise , since the data constrain the relative orbit to be close to radial .",
    "an example @xmath0-body simulation of such a direct hit is discussed in appendix  [ aa : direct ] .",
    "its initial conditions are listed in table  [ t : norbits ] in the column labeled `` direct - hit '' .",
    "a full movie ( figure[f : direct]c.mp4 ) is distributed electronically as part of this paper , with the same projection and layout as the panels of figure  [ f : canonsnaps ] .",
    "appendix  [ a : coulomb ] shows that mw - m31 merger times computed from the semi - analytic orbit integrations are generally in good agreement with those obtained from @xmath0-body simulations . in the semi",
    "- analytic monte - carlo set , the mw and m31 merge in all of the calculated orbits , with merger time @xmath202 . in most of the monte - carlo orbits ,",
    "the generic properties of the evolution of the mw and m31 com are not very different from those in the canonical orbit discussed in section  [ s : canonical ] .",
    "the longest merging time found was @xmath203 , but this is well out in the tail of the distribution . in general , longer merging times tend to be obtained for orbits with lower @xmath204 and/or larger @xmath24 .",
    "as m31 moves towards the mw , m33 orbits around it .",
    "for the m31-m33 system , the first - pericenter time and distance are @xmath205 and @xmath206 .",
    "pericenter will therefore generally happen within the next gyr .",
    "the observed velocities imply that the m31-m33 system has a certain amount of angular momentum , so this rules out a direct hit between these galaxies at the next pericenter .",
    "technically , a fraction 1.8% of orbits meet the definition of `` direct hit '' given above , but these orbits generally have pericenter distances @xmath207 .",
    "moreover , orbits with such small pericenters are ruled out by the argument that on such orbits m33 could not have remained as symmetric as it is to the present epoch ( see section  [ ss : m33m31 ] ) . by the time m31 gets to the mw , m33 is generally near its second pericenter with m31 ( see figure  [ f : canonsep ] ) .",
    "for the mw - m33 system , the first - pericenter time and distance are @xmath208 and @xmath209 .",
    "the large radial range indicates that m33 does not generally get close to the mw at its next pericenter . because of this , m33 on average tends to reach its pericenter with the mw a little sooner than m31 .",
    "however , the distribution of the mw - m33 pericenter distance is extremely broad , and reaches all the way down to zero .",
    "therefore , in some fraction of orbits m33 will make a direct hit with the mw , as discussed in more detail below .",
    "this generally happens before m31 reaches its pericenter with the mw .",
    "we show in appendix  [ a : coulomb ] that our semi - analytic orbit integration method can not reliably predict the time at which m33 will merge with either the mw , m31 , or their merged remnant .",
    "this is due to the approximate nature of our prescription for the dynamical friction experienced by m33 , which ceases to be valid over timescales @xmath210 into the future .",
    "nonetheless , it is possible to draw some general conclusions based on our @xmath0-body simulations .",
    "the merger time for m33 will be longer if it settles onto a wider orbit around the mw - m31 pair .",
    "the size of the orbit onto which m33 settles correlates with the first - pericenter distance between the mw and m33 ( compare figure  [ f : canonsep ] , and figure  [ f : orbits ] to be discussed below ) .",
    "figure  [ f : thist]b shows that this distance is smaller for the canonical model studied in section  [ s : canonical ] , than for 68.1% of monte - carlo simulated orbits .",
    "nonetheless , for the canonical model the m33 merger time was found to be long , since even at the end of the @xmath12 simulation , no merger had occurred .",
    "this was true also in a simulation in which m33 settled onto a more radial orbit around the mw - m31 merger remnant ( see appendix  [ aa : firstm33 ] ) .",
    "this implies that for most orbits the m33 merger time will generally be considerably longer than @xmath12 .",
    "in contrast , figure  [ f : thist]c shows that the mw and m31 have almost always merged by then .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the mw and m31 will generally merge first , with m33 settling onto an orbit around them that may decay towards a merger later .",
    "this result is primarily due to the mass ratios involved , and not the orbital geometry or angular momentum : dynamical friction is more efficient at slowing equal - mass systems than unequal - mass systems .",
    "the values for the canonical orbit discussed in section  [ s : canonical ] are close to the modes of all distributions in figure  [ f : thist ] .",
    "nonetheless , it is clear from the breadth of the distribution of mw - m33 pericenter distances that no single orbit can be a reasonable template for the full variety of possible outcomes .",
    "nevertheless , we have found that the orbits in the monte - carlo simulations can be broadly classified into the three categories discussed below , depending on how the distance between m33 and the mw evolves .",
    "table  [ t : orbits ] lists average properties for these categories .",
    "figure  [ f : orbits ] shows example orbits .",
    "* `` m33-hit orbits '' : * in 9.3% of the orbits , m33 `` hits '' the mw before m31 does . more specifically , these are orbits in which the distance between m33 and the mw at their first pericenter is less than 25 kpc ( which as above , we take as the definition of a direct hit ) , while m31 has its own pericenter with the mw either at a later time or a larger distance . in somewhat less than half of these orbits",
    "( 4.0% of the total ) , m31 subsequently also makes a direct hit with the mw at its first pericenter .",
    "orbits in which m33 makes a direct hit with the mw tend to occur when @xmath211 and @xmath212 have larger - than - average values , and the m31-m33 relative velocity @xmath213 is smaller than average is smaller or larger than average depends primarily on where exactly the m31 and m33 proper motions fall within their observationally allowed error ellipses . ] ( see table  [ t : orbits ] ) .",
    "this produces an m31-m33 pair that is more tightly bound .    * `` generic m33 orbits '' : * in 83.5% of orbits , m33 does not make a direct hit with the mw on its first pericenter , but it also does not move so far from the mw as to ever leave the lg .",
    "the canonical orbit of section  [ s : canonical ] is one example of a generic orbit . to assess whether m33 moves outside the lg , we calculated for each monte - carlo orbit at every time step the distance of m33 from the barycenter of the mw - m31 pair .",
    "if this distance exceeds @xmath214 , the current value of the lg turn - around radius ( e.g. , karachentsev et al .  2002 ) , then m33 was deemed to be outside the ( current bounds of ) the lg ( this does not take into account any future growth of the lg and expansion of its turn - around radius ) .",
    "such an orbit was then considered not to be a generic orbit .",
    "* `` m33-ejection orbits '' : * in 7.2% of orbits m33 leaves the lg , at least temporarily . in this case , m33 can either fall back and merge with the m31-mw merger remnant much later , or it can become entirely unbound from the m31-mw system . the fact that m33 can leave the lg despite being initially bound to m31 ( which merges with the mw ) is primarily due to the dynamical friction from the mw on m31 .",
    "this causes m31 , which is m33 s initial center of attraction , to be dramatically slowed down , while m33 itself keeps moving at the same velocity .",
    "orbits in this category tend to occur when @xmath211 and @xmath212 have smaller - than - average values , and the m31-m33 relative velocity @xmath213 is larger than average ( see table  [ t : orbits ] ) .",

    "it is this difference in curvature that is partly responsible for the different possible merging outcomes .",

    "we adopt a more general parameterization here for several reasons .",
    "first , with @xmath255 , there is no dynamical friction experienced inside @xmath256 .",
    "this leads to very slow decay of the satellite once it gets close to the center of the primary , consistent with what was seen in simulations of hashimoto et al .",
    "however , this is probably not physical . in real galaxies ,",
    "the gravity near the center of the dark halo is dominated by baryons .",
    "the baryons have a higher central density and smaller scale radius than the dark halo , and therefore provide added dynamical friction when @xmath257 . moreover , the dynamical response of the satellite adds to the orbital decay as well .",
    "so it is reasonable to consider @xmath258 .",
    "also , we allow @xmath259 and @xmath260 to differ from the values advocated by hashimoto et al . their values were derived for a satellite model with an arbitrary constant density core .",
    "it is unlikely that the same values would apply to our cosmologically motivated models , which have a central dark matter density cusp .",
    "the exact choice of @xmath249 affects the late - stage evolution of the merger , whereas the early orbital decay ( when the separations are still large ) depends only on @xmath259 and @xmath260 .    in our orbital calculations we encounter dynamical friction in two different regimes : dynamical friction between galaxies of roughly equal mass ( mw and m31 ) and dynamical friction between galaxies of rather unequal mass ( friction on m33 exerted by either the mw or m31 , in both cases corresponding to an @xmath261:10 mass ratio ) ; the dynamical friction of m33 on either mw or m31 is assumed to be zero .",
    "although we always use the same expression ( eq .",
    "[ [ coulomb ] ] ) for the coulomb logarithm , it is not obvious that the same values of the constants @xmath259 , @xmath249 , and @xmath260 should be used for both cases .",
    "we therefore use different coulomb logarithm constants @xmath262 and @xmath263 for the ( roughly ) equal - mass and unequal - mass case , respectively .    to `` calibrate '' the coulomb logarithm constants",

    "we ran many semi - analytic orbit integrations , varying the coulomb logarithm constants manually , to obtain a satisfactory fit to these orbital decays .",

    "we attribute this to the added complexities of our simulation compared to those of hashimoto et al .",
    ", namely multiple galaxy components , cusped halos , and a `` live '' secondary . with these complexities , we find that the long - term satellite decay is not perfectly fit by the simple formula eq .",
    "( [ coulomb ] ) . in particular , the semi - analytically predicted decay is too fast at large times .",
    "the parameter @xmath275 does not help to fix this , since increasing it above @xmath270 only speeds the late - stage decay further .",
    "the fact that the orbital decay of m33 is not perfectly reproduced by the semi - analytical model does not come as a surprise .",
    "the decay in merging and interacting systems is driven to significant extent by _",
    "global _ responses ( e.g. , barnes 1998 ) .",
    "these are not well described by chandrasekhar s _ local _ dynamical friction formula .",
    "figure  [ f : coulomb ] shows that our semi - analytic model is not adequate to predict the exact time it will take before m33 will merge with the mw - m31 remnant . to answer this question would require a suite of @xmath0-body simulations that follow the satellite merger process to completion , as in , e.g. , boylan - kolchin et al .",
    "nonetheless , our semi - analytic approach does reproduce the m33 orbital decay reasonably well for the near - term , @xmath276 .",
    "this is more than sufficient for the purposes of section  [ s : semicalc ] , which deals with the near - term _ distributions _ of orbital time scales and properties , and not the long - term details of individual orbits .",
    "the quantitative results for m33 s pericenters further illustrate the adequacy of the semi - analytic calculations for our purposes . for the first pericenter with m31 , the semi - analytic calculations for the canonical model yield a pericenter distance of @xmath277 at @xmath278 , whereas the actual value from the @xmath0-body simulations is @xmath279 at @xmath280 .",
    "for the first pericenter with the mw , the semi - analytic calculations for the canonical model yield a pericenter distance of @xmath281 at @xmath282 , whereas the actual value from the @xmath0-body simulations is @xmath283 at @xmath284 .",
    "while the implied error in the m33-mw pericenter distance is @xmath285 , this is much smaller than the range of pericenter distances that is obtained by varying the initial conditions of the orbit calculations .",
    "figure  [ f : thist]b shows that this can yield pericenter distances ranging from zero to hundreds of kpc .",
    "hence , _ uncertainties in the mw - m31-m33 initial conditions ( galaxy masses , positions , and velocities ) dominate over uncertainties introduced by our dynamical friction prescription._-body simulations due to the limited number of dark - halo particles at large radii . however , any dynamical friction at large separations is small because of the low densities involved .",
    "so here too , uncertainties in the mw - m31-m33 initial conditions have a much bigger influence on the exact orbital evolution . ]    for the calib-1 simulation , we also show for illustration in figure  [ f : coulomb]b the prediction for a kepler orbit ( dashed curve ) . in this case",
    "the mw and m31 were modeled as point masses of the same total mass as in the @xmath0-body simulation , and without dynamical friction .",
    "this corresponds to the assumptions on which the local group timing argument is built ( see paper  ii ) .",
    "also , van der marel & guhathakurta ( 2008 ; their figure  3 ) used kepler orbits to constrain the observationally allowed distribution of mw - m31 pericenter distances .",
    "figure  [ f : coulomb]b shows that with these assumptions , obviously , the orbit does not decay after its first pericenter .",
    "moreover , the kepler orbit has an earlier pericenter by 0.26 gyr .",
    "this is because the slowing from dynamical friction is ignored , and because the gravitational attraction is overestimated when all the mass is assumed to reside at the com .",
    "so while the semi - analytic predictions obtained in the present paper may not be perfect , they are certainly a lot more sophisticated than other simple approaches that have been explored in the context of local group dynamics .",
    "the initial conditions for the `` first - m33 '' , `` retrograde '' , and `` direct - hit '' models are listed in table  [ t : norbits ] .",
    "the @xmath0-body evolution of the models was calculated as described in section  [ ss : nmethod ] .",
    "movies of this evolution are distributed electronically as part of this paper ( figure[f : rembym33first]a.mp4 , figure[f : retrotails].mp4 , and figure[f : direct]c.mp4 , respectively ) . the same galactocentric cartesian @xmath135 projection centered on the mw com and",
    "the same layout are used as in the panels of figure  [ f : canonsnaps ] .",
    "candidate suns are shown starting at @xmath286 .",
    "the trigalaxy cartesian @xmath73 projection of the orbits centered on the mw - m31-m33 system com , as well as the galaxy separations as function of time , are shown in figure  [ f : orbits ] for the first - m33 and retrograde simulations , and in figure  [ f : direct ] for the direct - hit simulation .",
    "the first - m33 model differs from the canonical model of section  [ s : canonical ] in that m33 passes the mw much more closely on its first pericenter , @xmath287 vs.  @xmath283 .",
    "this causes the subsequent orbit of m33 around the mw - m31 merger remnant to be more radial . for the first - m33 model the apocenter : pericenter ratio is 13:1 at the end of the simulation ( @xmath288 ) , whereas it is 2:1 for the canonical model ( see figure  [ f : orbits ] ) .",
    "the close passage at first pericenter in the first - m33 model , and the more radial subsequent orbit , does not lead to a significantly faster merger of m33 with the mw - m31 remnant than in the canonical model . in the first - m33 model ,",
    "the apocenter distance of the m33 com at the end of the simulation is still @xmath289 .",
    "this is slightly , but not significantly , smaller than the @xmath290 for the canonical model .",
    "figure  [ f : rembym33first ] shows the distribution of luminous particles at the end of the first - m33 simulation .",
    "panel ( a ) shows the distribution of all luminous particles , color - coded similarly as in figure  [ f : canonsnaps]f .",
    "panel ( b ) shows only the luminous particles from m33 , color coded by local surface density .",
    "the latter can be compared to figure  [ f : rembygal]c for the canonical model . in both figures ,",
    "m33 still largely maintains its own identity in a bound core .",
    "however , in the first - m33 model , m33 has shed more particles into tidal streams and shells that now populate the halo of the mw - m31 merger remnant .",
    "a fraction 64.0% of the luminous particles are located further than @xmath156 from the m33 com , compared to 23.5% for the canonical model .",
    "so while the orbit of the most tightly bound m33 particles is not decaying faster in the first - m33 model compared to the canonical model , m33 is in fact dissolving faster .",
    "this could be due to the more radial orbit , but the fact that the galaxy masses in the first - m33 model are higher than in the canonical model ( see table  [ t : norbits ] ) may play a role too .    as in the canonical model , no candidate suns became bound to m33 during the first - m33 simulation .",
    "however , 100% of the candidate suns came within @xmath13 from m33 at some time during the @xmath12 of the simulation .",
    "this is five times higher than in the canonical model .",
    "however , this is a mere consequence of the radial plunging orbit of m33 through the mw - m31 merger remnant .",
    "it therefore does not indicate anything of particular interest .",
    "for the canonical model it was more interesting to find candidate suns within @xmath13 from m33 , since m33 itself never came within @xmath181 from the center of the mw - m31 merger remnant .",
    "m33 stays far from the mw in the retrograde model .",
    "therefore , m33 does not significantly affect the evolution of the mw - m31 system .",
    "however , this evolution is different than in the canonical model , because the orbit is now such that both the mw and m31 undergo a retrograde encounter ( @xmath291 and @xmath292 ) .",
    "for m31 the encounter is still relatively close to orthogonal , as in the canonical model .",
    "however , for the mw the encounter is now close to maximally retrograde , instead of maximally prograde ( see figure  [ f : prograde ] ) .",
    "this impacts the structural evolution of the mw , and in particular , leads to shorter tidal tails .",
    "figure  [ f : retrotails ] shows a snapshot of the simulation at @xmath293 , centered on the mw com , and projected onto the galactocentric @xmath135 plane ( i.e. , the mw disk plane ) .",
    "this is @xmath294 after the first mw - m31 pericenter , and is close to their first apocenter .",
    "this figure can be directly compared to figure  [ f : canonsnaps]c for the canonical model .",
    "any mw tidal tails are less pronounced than in the canonical model .",
    "this is likely due to the retrograde nature of the encounter ( dubinski et al .",
    "1996 ) , but the fact that the galaxy masses in the retrograde model are higher than in the canonical model ( see table  [ t : norbits ] ) may play a role too .",
    "the small mw tidal tails in the retrograde model affect the distribution of mw particles in the final mw - m31 merger remnant , in the sense that fewer particles migrate out to very large radii .",
    "figure  [ f : retrosolar ] shows the radial distribution of candidate suns with respect to the center of the mw - m31 remnant , at the end of the @xmath0-body simulation ( @xmath131 ) .",
    "this can be compared to figure  [ f : sunhist ] for the canonical model . at the end of the simulation ,",
    "18.4% of the candidate suns reside at @xmath295 and 81.6% at @xmath176 .",
    "a fraction 3.3% reside at @xmath296 and a fraction 0.1% at @xmath297 .",
    "the fraction of candidate suns that moves as far out as 50100 kpc from the mw - m31 merger remnant is three times less than in the canonical model .    as in the canonical model ,",
    "no candidate suns became bound to m33 during the retrograde simulation .",
    "moreover , no candidate suns came within @xmath13 from m33 at some time during the @xmath12 of the simulation .",
    "this is not surprising , given that m33 does not get within @xmath298 from the mw during the retrograde simulation ( see figure  [ f : orbits ] ) .",
    "however , it is interesting in that it indicates the large range of possible outcomes that is consistent with the m31 and m33 proper - motion data .",
    "by contrast , in the first - m33 model , _ all _ candidate suns came within @xmath13 of m33 at some time during the @xmath12 of the simulation .",
    "figure  [ f : thist ] shows that the canonical model falls roughly midway in all relevant mw - m31-m33 orbital parameters .",
    "its predictions with respect to the fate of the sun are therefore likely to be close to what one would get upon averaging over all observationally allowed orbits",
    ". it would be computationally prohibitive to calculate such an average , since it would require a very large suite of detailed @xmath0-body simulations .",
    "nonetheless , it seems reasonable to treat the predictions from the canonical model with respect to the fate of the sun as typical for the overall probabilities one might expect .",
    "the initial conditions for the direct - hit @xmath0-body model were chosen identical to those for the canonical model , with only one difference : the initial velocity of the m31 com was adjusted , within the observational error bars , to produce a more direct hit of m31 on the mw .",
    "the adopted initial velocity ( see table  [ t : norbits ] ) corresponds to @xmath299 . ,",
    "because of the perturbing influence of m33 on m31 s orbit . ]",
    "this yields an mw - m31 pericenter separation of only @xmath300 at @xmath301 , which is ten times closer than in the canonical model .",
    "comparison of figures  [ f : direct]a , b to the second row of figure  [ f : orbits ] shows that the orbital evolution is otherwise very similar to that for the canonical model , although m33 settles onto a somewhat wider orbit around the mw in the direct - hit model .",
    "figure  [ f : direct]c shows a snapshot of the simulation at @xmath302 .",
    "this is close to the first apocenter , after the galaxies have already passed through eachother .",
