    "the interplay between disorder and superconductivity has attracted sustained interest over the past few decades . in bcs superconductors , according to anderson s theorem , @xcite the superconducting critical temperature @xmath1 and the energy gap @xmath2 remain unaffected by the presence of weak disorder , although in unconventional superconductors both @xmath1 and @xmath2 are strongly suppressed with weak disorder .",
    "@xcite in the strongly disordered regime , things become interesting even in bcs superconductors : in two - dimensional ( 2d ) systems , strong disorder leads to a universal superconductor - to - insulator transition at a critical sheet resistance of @xmath3 ; @xcite furthermore , it has been found that , as @xmath4 tends to zero , there emerges a broad range of magnetic field where the resistivity remains finite but is much smaller than the normal - state value , which arguably signifies the importance of quantum phase fluctuations .",
    "@xcite in three - dimensional ( 3d ) systems , strong disorder leads to a disruption of the global superconducting coherence through reductions in both the superfluid density @xmath5 and pairing interactions , which results in the superconducting order parameter to spatially fluctuate and gives rise to anomalous electronic states near the superconductor - to - metal transition .",
    "@xcite experimentally , while the 2d systems have been actively studied in the past , @xcite the role of strong disorder in 3d superconductors is just beginning to be addressed with a modern viewpoint , @xcite which naturally calls for explorations of suitable materials for such a study .    in this paper , we report that agsnse@xmath6 , which is a low-@xmath7 conventional superconductor having a cubic structure , offers an ideal playground for studying the effects of strong disorder in 3d superconductors .",
    "we show that one can synthesize high - quality samples of agsnse@xmath6 presenting a very sharp superconducting transition , which indicates that morphologically the system is homogeneous ; nonetheless , strong electron scatterings that are intrinsic to this system lead to an extremely type - ii superconductivity with the ginzburg - landau parameter @xmath8 of as large as 55 .",
    "this causes the emergence of a broad range of magnetic fields where the resistivity remains finite but is much smaller than the normal - state value as @xmath9 , which is very much reminiscent of the behavior observed in disordered 2d superconductors @xcite or in quasi-2d systems like high-@xmath7 cuprates .",
    "@xcite furthermore , such an anomalous metallic state is found in the magnetic field range _ above _ the upper critical field determined thermodynamically from the specific heat .",
    "since this anomalous state can be easily reached with the magnetic field of 3 t and the microscopic mechanism of superconductivity is well understood in conventional superconductors , future studies of agsnse@xmath6 would help elucidate the roles of quantum phase fluctuations which remain controversial to date .",
    "the superconductivity in agsnse@xmath0 was discovered by johnston and adrian @xcite in 1977 as a possible valence - skipping superconductor . in valence - skipping compounds ,",
    "the nominal valence state of a constituent element happens to be the skipped valence for that element .",
    "this characteristic has been of particular interest for superconductivity , since it may provide a means to realize the so - called negative-@xmath11 mechanism to enhance the superconducting transition temperature @xmath7 . @xcite",
    "well - known examples of such valence - skipping superconductors are babi@xmath12pb@xmath13o@xmath14 , @xcite ba@xmath12k@xmath13bio@xmath14 , @xcite and pb@xmath12tl@xmath13te .",
    "@xcite in all these compounds , @xmath7 is relatively high for their low carrier density . at the same time ,",
    "valence fluctuations lead to significant electron scattering , making those superconductors highly disordered even though the matrix is homogeneous .",
    "agsnse@xmath0 adopts the face - centered cubic structure , in which the cation sites are randomly occupied by equal amount of ag and sn atoms .",
    "since the nominal valence of sn is 3 + which coincides with its skipped valence state , the sn ions should be separated into 1:1 mixture of sn@xmath15 and sn@xmath16 and the chemical formula of this material can be more appropriately expressed as ( ag@xmath17)(sn@xmath15)@xmath18(sn@xmath16)@xmath18(se@xmath19)@xmath0 , as evidenced by the measurements of the magnetic susceptibility @xcite and the @xmath20sn mssbauer spectra .",
    "@xcite despite the valence skipping nature and the carrier density of the order of 10@xmath21 @xmath22 , its @xmath7 of 4.7 k is not particularly high , which suggests that the negative-@xmath11 mechanism is not at work here .",
    "therefore , in this compound one can explore manifestations of strong disorder associated with valence fluctuations in the context of conventional superconductivity without being bothered by strong electron interactions .    .",

    "the present observation in agsnse@xmath0 is striking . here",
    "the coherence length is not so short , 12.1 nm , and the system is 3d , both of which work against strong vortex fluctuations .",
    "therefore , our result calls for a reinterpretation of the low - temperature broadening of the magnetic - field - induced resistive transition .      to understand the above results ,",
    "an interesting possibility is the scenario proposed by spivak , oreto and kivelson @xcite that the strong disorder leads to formations of superconducting  puddles \" that are josephson - coupled to each other , and quantum fluctuations of the relative phase between those puddles give rise to a broad range of magnetic fields where the resistivity remains finite and smaller than @xmath112 as @xmath9 .",
    "if this is indeed the case , our data give evidence for the important role of quantum phase fluctuations in disordered 3d conventional superconductors .",
    "since the superconductivity mechanism is well understood here ( as opposed to the case of high - temperature superconductors ) and the required magnetic field to access the quantum fluctuation regime is low ( only @xmath523 t ) , agsnse@xmath0 provides a convenient platform for studying the role of quantum fluctuations in the magnetic - field - induced superconductor - to - metal transition .",
