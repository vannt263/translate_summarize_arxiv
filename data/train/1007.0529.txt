    "since both of superconductivity and ferromagnetism are antagonistic ordered phases of matter , for a few decades after discovery of superconductivity , the interplay between superconductivity and ferromagnetism had not been a subject of intensive research interest .",
    "however , recently the study of interplay between superconductor and ferromagnet has been revived and , in particular , proximity effect and andreev reflection in superconductor - ferromagnet junctions has attracted much attention.@xcite    when a singlet superconductor has placed in proximity to a ferromagnetic layer , one can find triplet pairing correlations in the ferromagnetic layer and this component of pairing provides interesting effects.@xcite on the other hand , spin - triplet superconductor have been extensively investigated due to its anomalous features.@xcite proximity of spin - triplet superconductor and ferromagnet is more interesting than the singlet one in the sense that both of spin - triplet superconductor and ferromagnet have a magnetic nature .    .",
    "]    in refs.@xcite the authors demonstrated presence of both charge and spin currents in the systems consisting of a thin barrier of ferromagnet sandwiched between two triplet superconductors .",
    "they obtained a spin current due to the coupling of the ferromagnetic moment to the spin of triplet cooper pairs . also , they found a 0-@xmath0 transition in the triplet superconductor - ferromagnet - superconductor ( sfs ) josephson junction generated by the misalignment of the @xmath1-vectors of the triplet superconductors with respect to the magnetic moment of the ferromagnet .",
    "in contrast to refs.@xcite where the ferromagnet is modeled as @xmath2 function potential , in this paper we allow for arbitrary length of the ferromagnet , which is a more realistic modeling , based on the quasiclassical eilenberger equation . in this paper , we investigate a triplet sfs structure with arbitrary misalignment between magnetization of the ferromagnet and gap vector of superconductors ( fig.[fig1 ] ) , by changing the exchange field and thickness of ferromagnetic layer .",
    "we find that charge and spin currents show 0-@xmath0 transition except for the case that the two vectors are in nearly perpendicular configuration    the organization of this paper is as follows . in sec.[2 ]",

    "consequently , we believe that non - self - consistent approximation does nt change results qualitatively . therefore , in our calculations , a simple model of the constant order parameter up to the interface is considered to obtain qualitative results .",

    ", we find a tendency towards the 0-@xmath0 transition .",
    "in particular , we see a stronger tendency towards the 0-@xmath0 transition at @xmath47 .    in our formalism , there are in general three components ( @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 ) of spin current due to the presence of the ferromagnetic layer with finite thickness . while charge current is independent of position in ferromagnet , spin current is dependent on position and is not conserved .",
    "in fact , spin current at the left and right interfaces have opposite sign and in the middle of ferromagnetic layer , the spin current vanishes .",
    "we have plotted spin current at the left interface between superconductor and ferromagnetic layer in figs .",
    "[ fig4],[fig5 ] and fig.[fig8 ] . at this point , there are three components of spin current .    for charge",
    "current , we see that by increasing the thickness of ferromagnetic layer the current decreases with oscillation because of decreasing of quantum coherency , but for the spin current the situation is quite different . as a result of the exchange field",
    ", the thicker layer has a greater effect on spin of quasiparticles and thus a larger spin current . as seen in fig.[fig2 ] for @xmath65 ,",
    "the results are independent of the exchange field .",
    "thus , charge current in this case is only dependent on thickness of the ferromagnetic layer and spin current is absent .",
    "regarding spin currents , all components of spin current vanish at @xmath47 and @xmath65 .",
    "as shown in fig.[fig4 ] , spin current is strongly dependent on the exchange field , so for a weak ferromagnet ( for example @xmath66 ) , spin current is negligibly small . for some values of the phase difference , spin current exists in the absence of charge current as seen from figs .",
    "[ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] . also , there is local maximum or minimum in spin current in @xmath67 or @xmath68 .",
    "this can be explained as follows .",
    "charge currents are generally odd function but spin currents are even function of the phase difference , because of the symmetry under the time reversal .",
    "therefore , the slope of the spin current becomes zero at @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "the critical currents as a function of @xmath6 and @xmath10 are shown in fig.[fig6 ] and fig.[fig7 ] for different misorientations @xmath47 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "also , critical charge and spin currents as the function of @xmath7 have been plotted in fig.[fig8 ] . here , the critical charge and spin currents are defined as @xmath71 and @xmath72 , respectively .",
    "the 0-@xmath0 transition as a function of @xmath6 for large @xmath10 and small @xmath7 are shown in fig.[fig6 ] . in ref.@xcite",
    ", it is shown that 0-@xmath0 transition can not occur at @xmath65 for a @xmath2 function type ferromagnetic barrier .",
    "we find that this is the case even in the presence of a ferromagnetic layer with finite thickness instead of a @xmath2 function type barrier .",
    "this is also seen from the dependence of the josephson current on @xmath10 which shows the 0-@xmath0 transition for large @xmath6 and small @xmath7 as seen in fig.[fig7 ] .",
    "as shown in fig.[fig8 ] , for finite thickness of ferromagnetic layer , 0-@xmath0 transition can be found with changing the misorinetation angle .",
    "the 0-@xmath0 transition is accompanied by the jump of the spin current due to the phase jump at the 0-@xmath0 transition.@xcite even when charge current shows a monotonous dependence on @xmath7 , spin current can show non - monotonous @xmath7 dependence .",
    "in this paper , we have investigated transport properties in triplet sfs josephson junction and clarified the effects of the thickness of ferromagnet , the exchange field , and misorientation angle between exchange field of ferromagnet and @xmath1-vector of superconductors on the josephson charge and spin currents . we found that 0-@xmath0 transition can occur except for the case that the exchange field and d - vector are in nearly perpendicular configuration .",
    "also , we showed how spin current flows due to misorientation between the exchange field and @xmath1-vector and found that it is absent when two vectors are parallel or perpendicular to each other .",
