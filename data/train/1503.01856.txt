    "the structures of young circumstellar disks can reveal key insights into the formation and evolution of planetary systems .",
    "complex structures such as gaps , holes , spiral arms , or asymmetric structures have been imaged in a number of protoplanetary disks at near - infrared ( nir ) and millimeter / sub - millimeter wavelengths @xcite and they are predicted in theoretical simulations throughout the literature : a planet embedded in a viscous disk @xcite , photoevaporation @xcite , and grain growth @xcite .",
    "the 710 myr old @xcite pre - main sequence m2 @xcite star tw hydrae ( hereafter tw hya ) shows particularly strong evidence for a disk making a _ transition _ from a pre - planet building morphology to a post - planet building structure ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "tw hya , with 0.55 @xmath1 0.15 @xmath2 in stellar mass @xcite and more than 0.05 @xmath3 in disk mass @xcite , is an ideal example of transitional disks in that it is almost face - on ( @xmath4 = 7 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and because of its close distance of 54 @xmath1 6 pc ( hipparcos ; @xcite ) , is particularly accommodating to investigations of its geometrical structure with high spatial resolution and sensitivity .",
    "previous studies at optical , near - ir , and mm / sub - mm wavelengths show the radial surface brightness extending to @xmath0 150  230 au @xcite .",
    "high contrast direct imaging with the hubble space telescope ( hst ) nicmos coronagraph reveal a disk gap at 80 au , indicating the evolution of dust composition or the presence of an embedded protoplanetary system @xcite .",
    "the inner hole at @xmath0 4 au is observationally predicted from a flux deficit at @xmath0 2  20 @xmath5 in the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) , suggesting a deficit of material left around the central star .",
    "excess at @xmath0 20  60 @xmath5 in the sed is probably due to emission from the truncated inner edge of the outer disk @xcite .",
    "the existence of the inner disk is also supported by interferometric observations and visibility model fitting of the 7 mm continuum @xcite and a recent modeling concludes that the disk does not have a sharp edge at 4 au @xcite .    in this letter",
    ", we present a new @xmath6-band polarized intensity ( _ pi _ ) image of tw hya and the polarized intensity distribution ranging from 02 to 15 ( corresponding to @xmath0 11  81 au ) of the disk , including the region closer to the central star than the region previously observed by hst . a polarized intensity depression at @xmath0 04 ( @xmath0 20 au ) , probably caused by a gap in the disk , was detected . through investigating observed polarized intensity profile , we discuss the disk morphological structure and the origin of the depression .",
    "we carried out @xmath6-band ( @xmath7 m ) linear polarimetric observations of tw hya using the high contrast instrument for the subaru next generation adaptive optics ( hiciao ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with a dual - beam polarimeter at the subaru 8.2 m telescope on march 24th 2011 and january 3rd 2013 .",
    "these observations were part of the strategic explorations of exoplanets and disks with subaru ( seeds ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) project .",
    "both of the observations were conducted in the same instrument setting .",
    "the polarimetric observation mode acquires _ o_-ray and _ e_-ray simultaneously , and images a field of view 10@xmath8 20with a pixel scale of 9.50 mas / pixel .",
    "the exposures were performed at four position angles ( p.a.s ) of the half - wave plate , with a sequence of p.a .",
    "= 0 , 45 , 22.5 , and 67.5 ,  to measure the stokes parameters .",
    "the integration time per wave plate position was set by 10  30 s during observation to optimize instrument according to on - site condition .",
    "three coadd modes were used to save the total overhead time . the adaptive optics system ( ao188 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) provided mostly stable stellar point - spread function ( psf ) with a fwhm of 015 in the _ h_-band .",
    "the adaptive optics corrections in both observation dates functioned well and the qualities of resultant images of both observations were almost the same .",
    "we strictly selected only good quality of data from among of them for producing the best image .",
    "low quality images were removed prior to production of the final image , resulting in 13 good sets with a total integration time , for the _ pi _ image , of 390 s. the data sets were taken with angular differential imaging ( adi ) mode with a net field rotation of 12 degrees .",
    "all unflagged data were corrected for field rotation and integrated .",
    "the standard imaging method @xcite was applied to the polarimetric data , including corrections for distortion and flat - field , using the image reduction and analysis facility ( iraf ) as in previous seeds publications ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "correction for instrumental polarization of the nasmyth hiciao instrument was applied with the mueller - matrices technique , that quantizes polarization characteristics @xcite .",
    "_ pi _ was calculated from @xmath9 , where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are orthogonal linear polarizations , and the final polarized intensity profile was obtained after applying 10 @xmath8 10 pixels smoothing to the entire disk .",
    "the _ pi _ image in @xmath6-band of the transitional disk around tw hya is presented in figure [ fig : fig1 ] .",
    "there is no discernible misalignment in the polarization vector beyond @xmath12 02 ( which will be the subject of later studies in this series ) , and to be conservative , polarization measurements at radii more distant than 02 from the central star are regarded as more accurate .    shown in the _ pi _ image is a ring - like polarized intensity depression at @xmath13 @xmath0 04 . the observed polarized intensity profile shown in figure [ fig : fig2](a ) , revealing a stair - like decline in polarized intensity , with increasing distance from the central star .",
    "we define three major step transitions as : zone 1 ( 02 @xmath14 @xmath13 @xmath14 04 ) , zone 2 ( 04 @xmath14 @xmath13 @xmath14 08 ) , and zone 3 ( 08 @xmath14 @xmath13 @xmath14 15 ) , and the polarized intensity profile is fitted at each zone with a simple power law : @xmath15 @xmath16 .",
    "the fitting results in zones 1 , 2 , and 3 are shown in red , green , and blue , with slopes at each zone of -1.39 , -0.33 , and -2.65 , respectively . the significant change in slope at @xmath0 04 is interpreted as a transition of some physical property in all azimuthal directions and is the subject of the remainder of this letter . the change in slope around 08",
    "has already been discussed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : fig2](b ) displays an azimuthal brightness profile at 02 , 05 , and 08 in radius .",
    "this figure shows the disk is almost axisymmetric , with constant polarized intensity in all azimuthal directions , although rms noise level increases at @xmath17 02 .",
    "one of interesting results in the observation is that the polarized intensity profile has a stair - like shape .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : fig2]a , in zone 1 , the innermost part of the disk , the profile shows a shallow slope of approximately @xmath18 , where the slope is expected to be @xmath19 in the case of a flared disk , or steeper in the case of a flat geometry @xcite . in zone 2 , the profile appears almost flat , perhaps indicating that temperature increases with radius . in zone 3",
    ", the polarized intensity profile has a steep value of approximately @xmath20 , which is darker than expected .",
    "the observed polarized intensity profile reflects a radial distribution of small dust particles and dust property . in this section ,",
    "we discuss three possible explanations for the radial polarized intensity distribution observed in the disk of tw hya .",
    "these include ( a ) an unusual radial distribution on the temperature , ( b ) the presence of a disk gap induced by the presence of a low - mass planet , and ( c ) a change in dust scale height due to grain growth .",
    "it is important to investigate the extent to which the shallow slopes observed in zones 1 and 2 could depend on temperature .",
    "generally , @xcite shows the observed intensity of the scattered light ( @xmath21 ) from a disk with no complex structures , such as gap or cavity , can be expressed by @xmath22 where @xmath23 is a stellar luminosity , @xmath13 is a distance from a central star , and @xmath24 is a product of albedo and polarization ( a phase function including polarization ) , @xmath25 is a scattering angle , and @xmath26 is grazing angle , and expressed by @xmath27 where @xmath28 is scattering surface .",
    "assuming @xmath24 is constant in equation ( [ eq : intensity ] ) and considering @xmath29 , we obtain @xmath30 thus , @xmath28 becomes @xmath31    according to customary practice and precedents in the past works , we assume that @xmath28 is linearly related to @xmath32 by some constant factor a in the case of smoothly extended disk with no gap @xcite , and the relation can be described by @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the speed of sound , @xmath35 is keplerian angular velocity , and @xmath36 is a gas pressure scale height , respectively .",
    "considering radial temperature distribution , @xmath37 , has a form of @xmath37 @xmath15 @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is a power index , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 , we obtain @xmath42    for zone 1 , with radial polarized intensity dropping as @xmath43 , equation ( [ eq : hs / r2 ] ) implies @xmath44 proportional to @xmath45 and @xmath46 . for zone 2 , with radial polarized intensity dropping as @xmath47 , @xmath44 is proportional to @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "these indicate the temperature increases with increasing @xmath13 , which is difficult to explain by considering only stellar radiation or flared structure of the disk .",
    "one of the reasons for the unexpected result is that the gas scale height is not simply related to temperature .",
    "such a result might be able to be explained when a gap exists because the gap generates a sudden change of surface density .",
    "dynamical phenomena such as disk wind or turbulence could be cited as another possible cause , because the disk surface can be lifted by them , resulting in a flat polarized intensity profile and no longer in hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "if this is the case , wind mechanism such as photoevaopration or magneto - rotational instability that suppress the inner region of the disk due to dead zone might occur .",
    "in this section , we consider the possibility that the changing slope of the observed polarized intensity distribution may signal the presence of a planet within the disk .",
    "the slopes at each zone can be explained by a disk surface geometry described by @xcite . in their works , the disk illumination and shadowing are self - consistently calculated considering several disk orientations , using a static @xmath50disk radiative transfer model when a gap exists in the disk .",
    "figure 2 in @xcite shows the surface brightness becomes brighter at the gap wall directly irradiated by a central star , and darker by shadowing and cooling behind the outer gap wall at the edge of gap .",
    "if this is the case , zones 1 , 2 and 3 probably correspond to a gap , an outer gap wall , and a shadowed region behind the outer gap wall , respectively .",
    "they also made radiative transfer calculations at several wavelengths and theoretically derived a radial surface brightness profile of a disk when a gap is formed by a 70 and 200 earth mass planet .",
    "the radial surface brightness profile at a wavelength of 1 @xmath5 shown in figure 6 in @xcite increases just beyond the gap created by a planet , and its slope depends on planet mass , flatter in the case of small mass planet . therefore",
    ", if the origin of the polarized intensity depression attributes to a planet , planet mass seems to be small since our observed polarized intensity profile shows a flat slope at the gap region .",
    "it is beyond the scope of this paper to investigate the detailed effects of planet parameters on the structure of the inner disk of tw hya , but an extensive search of parameter - space ( planet mass and orbital characteristics ) in the future might lead to a suitable model for the observed brightness distribution .",
    "the picture of the disk structure presented in section [ temperature ] and [ surface ] does not necessarily mean that the gas disk has a gap at @xmath51 20 au .",
    "dust grains are also believed to settle to the mid - plane as their size increases .",
    "when the disk gas has a gaussian distribution in the vertical direction with @xmath36 , dust grains also have a gaussian distribution in the vertical direction , with a dust scale height @xmath52 that is determined by the balance between the diffusion by the gas and the coupling efficiency to the gas @xcite . using the stokes number st , which represents the coupling efficiency of grains to gas and",
    "is defined as the stopping time normalized by the orbital timescale , and the diffusion coefficient @xmath53 , which represents the diffusion efficiency of the gas in the vertical direction , the dust scale height can be written as      when st @xmath55 1 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "as a first rough step to quickly quest to see a possibility whether grain growth occurs or not , we introduce the parameter @xmath56 where the radial grain size distribution has a form of @xmath57 . by using @xmath58 in the form of @xmath59 and applying turbulent viscosity @xmath50 model @xcite and the epstein law , then the stokes number has a simple form of @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the density of a dust particle and assumed to be a constant throughout the disk . substituting this into equation ( [ eq : dustscaleheight ] )",
    ", we obtain @xmath62 since @xmath63 , we finally obtain the radial dependence of the dust scale height as @xmath64    our observation suggests that the dust scale height has a radial dependence of @xmath65 in zone 1 and @xmath66 in zone 2 , by utilizing equation ( [ eq : hs / r2 ] ) and assumption that @xmath67 is linearly related to @xmath68 described by equation ( [ eq : scat_surface2 ] ) .",
    "note that @xmath52 and @xmath44 are not identical , however @xmath44 must be about equal to @xmath52 for the small dust grains , which are mainly traced by @xmath6-band scattering light in our observation . from equation ( [ eq : final ] ) , we obtain @xmath69 in zone 1 and @xmath70 in zone 2 in the disk around tw hya , assuming that @xmath71 and @xmath72 @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the dust has a larger size in the inner part of the disk , and the size varies by at least a factor of 10 between 10 au ( @xmath73 ) and 40 au ( @xmath74 ) , where the depression and its vicinity are covered .",
    "it should be noted that since smaller grains have a larger scattering efficiency , the scattering plane has to represent the dust scale height of the smallest grains at the radial position .",
    "the @xmath75 image suggests the possible existence of a small - grain depleted region at @xmath76 , with the depleted range of width more than 10 au wide .",
    "this may suggest that the larger grains are present at inner radii , but there is no sharp transition of the grain size distribution .",
    "we note that gas and large grains can be present in the inner region of the disk . indeed",
    ", mm-/submm - observations give no evidence to date of the depletion of gas or dust continuum emission .",
    "furthermore , the dust sedimentation near the disk mid - plane results in flat polarization intensity profile , that is it further promotes a flared structure in @xmath52 distribution .",
    "estimates of the amount of 10 @xmath5  1 mm sized dust in the disk mid - plane , and up to @xmath0 60 au , are limited by sma and vla data ( see fig . 9 , * ? ? ?",
    "our nir observations trace dust at the disk surface between 10  80 au , and reflect mainly smaller grains 0.1  10 @xmath5 in size .",
    "the observations are complementary to each other , revealing radially and vertically distributed dust at different size scales .",
    "note that the absorption efficiency also depends on grain size , and thus influences on the vertical profile via temperature distribution .",
    "however , the absorption efficiency does not significantly change with dust grain sizes between 0.1  10 @xmath5 in the case of @xmath6-band wavelength @xcite .",
    "the variation of fundamental dust properties may also affect the observed polarized intensity distribution .",
    "for instance , @xmath24 in equation ( [ eq : intensity ] ) may not be constant .",
    "@xcite explored the scattering properties for different grain size , and calculate polarization degree and polarization intensity normalized by the incident stellar light as a function of scattering angle .",
    "they show the polarization degree decreases with increasing grain size when @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is a radius of a dust grain and @xmath79 is wavelength of emission , respectively , resulting in a depolarization of the emission ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . on the other hand ,",
    "when @xmath80 , polarization and polarized intensity decreases less significantly even though @xmath78 becomes larger .",
    "since the dust grain size directly affects the polarized intensity , a variable @xmath24 is consistent with the effect of grain growth .",
    "the minimum grain size depends strongly on the fragmentation efficiency of dust - dust collisions in the disk .",
    "if fragmentation of dust is efficient , the scattering surface of the disk should be dominated by the small fragments .",
    "however , our observational analysis suggests that fragmentation is not so efficient , particularly in the inner part of the disk .",
    "one possible reason for the inefficiency of fragmentation is the icy aggregates have a larger critical velocity before complete disruption , than do rocky aggregates @xcite , although the critical velocity of fragmentation is still under debate . in our study , it is reasonable to assume that the grains are covered by ice , since the locations we have observed are expected to be outside the water snow line .",
    "another possibility is that fragmentation is effective , but the tiny fragments are swept up by larger grains .",
    "@xcite investigated the size distribution as a result of the balance between fragmentation and sweep - up . to sweep up tiny grains , they suggest the diffusion coefficient @xmath50 should be as low as @xmath81 . in our case , the modeling therefore suggests the diffusion is generally inefficient throughout the disk .    in tandem with nir high - resolution observations , high - resolution and multi - band observations at mm - wavelength will aid an investigation into the grain opacity index @xmath26 .",
    "such data will help us to clarify whether the grain growth is occurring at inner radii and understand the effects of any planet formation on dust character within the gap .",
