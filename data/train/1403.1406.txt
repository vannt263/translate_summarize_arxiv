    "it is ( only ) exactly solvable in one dimension at zero temperature or , equivalently , on the two - dimensional square lattice for a vanishing field .",
    "more generally , the @xmath0-dimensional tfim at zero temperature can be mapped to the @xmath1-dimensional ising model at zero field , both displaying a second - order phase transition in the @xmath1 ising universality class which plays an important role for many other classical and quantum many - body systems @xcite , e.  g.  in the duality to the @xmath2 gauge theory @xcite which has been discussed recently in the context of the topologically ordered toric code @xcite in the presence of a magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the ising model with three - spin interactions is an interesting system with multiple spin interactions which was introduced by baxter and wu on the triangular lattice in 1973 to describe ferrimagnetism and critical phase transitions @xcite .",
    "interestingly , this baxter - wu ( bw ) model is exactly solvable .",
    "it displays a second - order thermal phase transition in the 4-state potts model universality class ( without logarithmic corrections ) .",
    "the latter has been confirmed by series expansions @xcite and quantum monte carlo simulations @xcite .",
    "recently , also the baxter - wu model in a transverse magnetic field ( bwtf ) has been studied by series expansions at zero temperature @xcite . here",
    "clear signatures are found for a first - order quantum phase transition separating the ordered phase from the polarized phase present at large magnetic fields . as for the toric code in a field , one can also show a duality mapping between the so - called topological color code ( tcc ) @xcite on the dual honeycomb lattice , a quantum - spin model relevant for topological quantum computation , in a magnetic field and the bwtf @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the physics of the bwtf at finite temperatures is to the best of our knowledge unknown .",
    "the latter is interesting , since thermal and quantum fluctuations are present simultaneously and one may expect tricritical behavior between the first - order phase transition at zero temperature and the second - order phase transition at zero field .",
    "consequently , a detailed study of the finite - temperature phase diagram of the bwtf is the major focus of this paper . to this end",
    "we perform large - scale stochastic series expansion ( sse ) quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) simulations .",
    "furthermore , we discuss the low - energy spectral properties as well as the zero - temperature phase transition of the bwtf by comparing high - order series expansions about the low- and high - field limit using perturbative continuous university transformations ( pcuts ) @xcite with the numerical data obtained by qmc . here",

    "this excitation can be created by the single operator @xmath5 acting on site @xmath6 which flips the eigenvalues of the six face operators sharing this site .",
    "alternatively , the spin flip excitation can also be seen as six excitations centered on triangles which form the dual honeycomb lattice @xmath7.,width=226 ]    in this section , we introduce the bwtf .",
    "additionally , we show a duality between the bwtf and the tcc in a parallel field which has been already discussed in ref ..    let us consider a triangular lattice denoted by @xmath8 as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ triangular_latt ] .",
    "quantum spins 1/2 are located at the vertices of the lattice .",
    "the three spins on each triangle interact with each other by a three - spin interaction of strength @xmath9 such that the baxter - wu model is given by@xcite h_bw =- j_ijk ^z_i^z_j^z_k , [ h_bw ] where @xmath10 is the ordinary @xmath11-pauli matrix and the sum is taken over all triangles of the lattice .",
    "each three - spin interaction ( which we also call a face operator ) in eq .",

    "ground states of the baxter - wu model correspond therefore to states where all these eigenvalues of the face operators are @xmath13 . on a triangular lattice ,",

    "the ground - state energy of the system on a lattice with @xmath19 triangular faces is then given by @xmath20 .",
    "furthermore , excited states are denoted by the total number of @xmath21 eigenvalues of the face operators each of which costs the energy @xmath22 . consequently , the first - excited states are @xmath23-fold degenerate and have the total energy @xmath24 .",
    "the system is therefore gapped with an equidistant energy spectrum .    using a duality transformation @xcite",
    ", one can introduce pseudospin-@xmath25 operators @xmath26 living on the dual honeycomb lattice of the triangular faces .",
    "the energetic properties of the baxter - wu model are then just given by an effective magnetic field h^dual_bw",

    "[ h_bw_map ] here the sum runs over the vertices of the dual honeycomb lattice @xmath7 which corresponds to the centers of triangles in the dual baxter - wu model .",
    "let us stress that this duality is only valid for the spectrum , but any information on degeneracies is clearly lost .",
    "indeed , the effective magnetic field has a unique polarized ground state with pseudo - spins pointing in the field direction and elementary excitations are dressed spin flips .",
    "our major objective is to add quantum fluctuations to the classical baxter - wu model on the triangular lattice by introducing a transverse magnetic field .",
    "we therefore consider the following hamiltonian : h_bwtf =- j_ijk ^z_i^z_j^z_k -h _ i ^x_i , [ h_bwtf ] where the first ( second ) sum runs over the faces ( sites ) of the triangular lattice . in the following we focus on @xmath27 .",
    "a single @xmath28 flips the eigenvalues of the six face operators sharing the site @xmath6 on the triangular lattice as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ triangular_latt ] . in the dual pseudo - spin representation ,",
    "the action of the transverse magnetic field is equivalent to flipping the six pseudo - spins of the corresponding hexagon .",
    "the bwtf after the duality mapping then reads h^dual_bwtf =- j_i ^z_i - h _ p _ p , [ h_bwtf_map ] where @xmath29 denotes a hexagon of the dual lattice @xmath7 and are plaquette operators where the numbers ( @xmath30 ) correspond to the six sites of hexagon @xmath29 ( see also fig .",
    "[ triangular_latt ] ) .",
    "the just derived dual hamiltonian is closely related to the tcc in a single parallel field on the honeycomb lattice @xcite .",
    "the tcc is a topological stabilizer code consisting of two types of plaquette operators which all commute pairwise with each other such that eigenvalues @xmath12 of all these operators are conserved quantities @xcite .",
    "one of the two types of plaquette operators is identical to @xmath31 introduced above . the other type of plaquette operator commutes with a magnetic field in the @xmath11-direction . as a consequence , the low - energy physics of the tcc in a single parallel field",
    "is contained in the sector where all of the remaining conserved plaquette operators are @xmath13 .",
    "therefore , the bwtf is , up to a constant , isospectral to this sector of the tcc in a single parallel field @xcite .",

    "these quantum fluctuations can be calculated in the thermodynamic limit by exploiting the linked - cluster theorem @xcite .",
    "the latter implies that only processes which take place on ( finite ) connected clusters contribute to matrix elements of @xmath43 .",
    "consequently , the pcut method provides exact results up to the computed perturbative order directly in the thermodynamic limit .      in this subsection",
    ", we apply the pcut method to the bwtf about the high - field limit .",

    ".    the three - spin interactions of the baxter - wu model do therefore change the number of qps by @xmath54 .",
    "the pcut then maps hamiltonian ( [ h_hf_tn ] ) to an effective hamiltonian @xmath55 which conserves the number of qps .",
    "this allows the investigation of the low - energy properties of the bwtf in the high - field limit along the lines discussed in ref .  .",

    "( [ h_lf_tn ] ) to an effective hamiltonian @xmath60 in the low - field limit .",
    "the energetics of the bwtf in the low - field limit is then accessed by calculating the ground - state energy per site and the low - energy gap of the qp excitations .",
    "however , one should note that although a single spin flip on one site of the dual honeycomb lattice is the lowest excited state , the 1-qp sub - block is not the most relevant sector close to the phase transition @xcite . in the original bwtf , the transverse field @xmath28 creates ( out of the unperturbed ground state ) six qps on the six neighboring triangles which share site @xmath6 .",
    "this condition implies that this 6-qp excitation having all six spins of a hexagon flipped to be the most relevant low - energy excitation .",
    "we therefore discuss @xmath61 and the corresponding 6-qp gap of the bwtf in the low - field limit in the next section .      as we have already outlined in sec .",
    "[ pcut ] , the pcut method maps the initial problem to a qp conserving hamiltonian which is a sum over virtual fluctuations that are represented by sequences of the @xmath38 operators .",

    "the main idea of the flm was to consider rectangular clusters @xmath71 with @xmath72 sites and their embeddings in the lattice @xmath8 .",
    "then any extensive quantity such as the free energy is calculated on rectangular clusters and the physical quantity in the thermodynmic limit is obtained by proper summation and subtraction rules .",
    "the main benefit of this method is that the total number of clusters is dramatically decreased compared to a full graph expansion .",

    "the series are obtained by acting with @xmath43 on the appropriate hexagonal clusters in different orders of perturbation as explained in ref .  .",
    "working in the standard basis where the ising interaction is diagonal , all non - vanishing off - diagonal elements of the bwtf are negative for @xmath27 : it is therefore amenable to qmc simulations with no sign problem .",
    "however , it is non - trivial to devise an efficient algorithm due to the specific form of the three - body ising interaction .",
    "the sse qmc technique with efficient directed loop updates  @xcite is indeed usually formulated for two - body interactions . for specific models",
    "however , one can construct non - local loop algorithms in a slightly different fashion as first formulated by sandvik  @xcite for the tfim model in the basis where the ising interaction is diagonal .",
    "we refer the reader to ref .   for full details of the algorithm , and just state the key point : for the tfim , the matrix element of an ising ( sse ) vertex is unchanged when both spins ( all sse vertex legs ) are flipped .",
    "unfortunately , this property does no longer hold for the bwtf due to the odd number of sites in the ising interaction .",
    "however , we can use a similar idea : before starting a global loop update in the sse configuration , one can freeze randomly one of the three sublattices a , b or c  @xcite by not allowing the loop to touch any of the spins in this sublattice . then , we use exactly the same rules as for the tfim case  @xcite , and flip all legs of sse vertices _ except _ those on the frozen sublattice , i.e. four legs among six . by doing so , the weight of the configuration is unchanged and the acceptance rate is one . in the limit of vanishing transverse field ,",
    "this algorithm is identical to the cluster algorithm first proposed by evertz and novotny  @xcite for the classical baxter - wu model , exactly as the algorithm proposed by sandvik  @xcite reduces to the swendsen - wang  @xcite algorithm for the ising model .",
    "this remark makes us believe that our qmc algorithm for the quantum baxter - wu model is slightly less efficient than the tfim algorithm , as it was already shown  @xcite for the classical limit @xmath78 that the dynamical critical exponent ( characterizing the algorithm efficiency to decorrelate monte - carlo samples ) was larger than for the swendsen - wang algorithm .",
    "we nevertheless manage to simulate close to criticality large samples of size @xmath79 up to @xmath80 at finite temperature , and up to @xmath81 in the ground - state .",
    "we have checked by comparing with exact diagonalizations ( ed ) on small lattices that our qmc implementation does reproduce all quantities within error bars .    in the qmc simulations , we measure several observables which can be grouped in two types : observables related to the order parameter of the ordered magnetic phase of the bwtf model , and observables related to energy .",
    "the sections below give their definitions and expected scaling close to a phase transition .",
    "to define properly the order parameter , let us first discuss the symmetries of the model eq.([h_bwtf ] ) .",
    "it is clearly invariant when one performs a @xmath82 rotation in spin space ( i.e. spin inversion ) for spins sitting on any two among the three sublattices a , b or c ( this fact is explicitly used in the construction of the qmc algorithm , see sec .",

    "our current simulations close to the putative tricritical point ( in the regime @xmath1952.25j,2.35j[$ ] ) indicate that the correlation length ( effective ) critical exponent @xmath90 varies from @xmath196 at @xmath197 to @xmath198 at @xmath199 and then finally @xmath200 at @xmath150 corresponding to first - order behavior .",
    "we have studied quantum and thermal phase transitions of the baxter - wu model in a transverse magnetic field using large - scale quantum monte carlo simulations and series expansions .",

    "indeed , even the second - order phase transition line exhibits typical signatures of first - order transitions such as negative binder cumulant @xmath141 or double peaked energy histograms , which vanish in the thermodynamic limit but harden the analysis .",
    "given the central role played by tricritical points in potts model physics  @xcite , characterization of this new tricriticality ( critical exponents as well as determination of its conformal field theory ) remains an exciting challenge that we hope to address in the future .",

    "we also point to a recent reference  @xcite where the case of a _ classical _ magnetic field was considered : a classical monte - carlo analysis indicate a different universality class ( @xmath205 , @xmath206 , @xmath207 ) , however the critical exponents violate scaling relations so that further work should clarify this . also , the latter situation breaks the sublattice symmetries that is present in our model so that there is no direct connection .    as stated above",
