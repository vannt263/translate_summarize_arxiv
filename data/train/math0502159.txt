    "[ [ section ] ]    a configuration space of @xmath0 ordered , distinct particles on a variety @xmath1 is @xmath2 over the past decade , there has been an increased interest in the configuration space of @xmath0 labeled particles on the projective line . the focus is on a quotient of this space by @xmath3 , the affine automorphisms on @xmath4 .",
    "the resulting variety is the moduli space of riemann spheres with @xmath0 punctures @xmath5 there is a compactification @xmath6 of this space , a smooth variety of complex dimension @xmath7 , coming from geometric invariant theory @xcite . the space @xmath6 plays a crucial role as a fundamental building block in the theory of gromov - witten invariants , also appearing in symplectic geometry and quantum cohomology @xcite .",
    "our work is motivated by the _",
    "real _ points @xmath8 of this space , the set of points fixed under complex conjugation .",
    "these real moduli spaces have importance in their own right , appearing in areas such as @xmath9-motives of goncharov and manin @xcite and lagrangian floer theory of fukaya @xcite .",
    "indeed , @xmath8 has even emerged in phylogenetic trees @xcite and networks @xcite .",
    "it was kapranov @xcite who first noticed a relationship between @xmath8 and the braid arrangement of hyperplanes , associated to the coxeter group of type @xmath10 : blow - ups of certain cells of the @xmath11 coxeter complex yield a space homeomorphic to a double cover of @xmath12 .",
    "this creates a natural tiling of @xmath8 by associahedra , the combinatorics of which is discussed in @xcite .",
    "davis et .",
    "al have generalized this construction to all coxeter groups , along with studying the fundamental groups of these blown - up spaces @xcite .",
    "carr and devadoss @xcite looked at the inherent tiling of these spaces by the convex polytopes _ graph - associahedra_.    [ [ section-1 ] ]    we begin with elementary results and notation : section  [ s : complexes ] provides the background of coxeter groups and their associated coxeter complexes and section  [ s : config ] constructs the appropriate configuration spaces of particles . section  [ s : bracket ] introduces the bracketing notation in order to visualize collisions in the configuration spaces , leading to viewing the hyperplanes of the coxeter complexes in this new language .",
    "it is this notation that provides a transparent understanding of several results in this paper . in particular",
    ", it allows for a complete classification of the minimal building sets for the coxeter complexes , along with their enumeration , as given in tables  [ t : sphere ] and  [ t : euclid ] .",
    "it is interesting to note that some configuration structures behave quite classically , whereas others ( based on _ thick _ particles ) are atypical .",
    "the heart of the paper begins in section  [ s : compact ] where the fulton - macpherson compactification @xcite of these spaces is discussed and used to define the notion of a _",
    "coxeter operad _ in definition  [ d : coxoperad ] , extending the mosaic operad of @xmath8 @xcite . here , _ nested _",
    "bracketings are used to describe the structure of the compactified spaces , enabling us to describe how the chambers of these spaces glue together .",
    "section  [ s : tiling ] ends with combinatorial results using the theory developed in @xcite .",
    "for instance , the euler characteristics of these coxeter moduli spaces are given , exploiting the tilings by graph - associahedra .",
    "as of writing this paper , the importance of the operadic structure of @xmath8 has been brought further to light .",
    "for instance , etingof et al .",
    "@xcite have used the mosaic operad to compute the cohomology ring of @xmath8 .",
    "recently , the coxeter operad defined below appears in the work of e.  rains in computing the integral homology of these generalized coxeter moduli spaces @xcite .",
    "we express our gratitude to jim stasheff and vic reiner for detailed comments on this work and to alex postnikov for working on the @xmath13-vectors of graph - associahedra .",
    "we also thank the referee for wonderful insight and careful analysis , especially with regards to the operad module structures .",
    "[ [ section-2 ] ]    in order to provide the construction of coxeter moduli space generalizations of @xmath8 , as given in section  [ s : compact ] , we begin with standard facts and definitions about coxeter systems .",
    "most of the material here can be found in bourbaki @xcite .",
    "associated to any coxeter system @xmath20 is its _ coxeter graph _",
    "@xmath21 : each node represents an element of @xmath14 , where two nodes @xmath22 determine an edge if and only if @xmath23 . a coxeter group is _ irreducible _ if its coxeter graph is connected and it is _ locally finite _ if either @xmath15 is finite or each proper subset of @xmath14 generates a finite group .",
    "a coxeter group is _ simplicial _ if it is irreducible and locally finite @xcite .",
    "the classification of simplicial coxeter groups and their graphs is well - known ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 6 ) .",
    "we restrict our attention to infinite families of simplicial coxeter groups which generalize to arbitrary number of generators .",
    "this will mimic configuration spaces of an arbitrary number of particles since our motivation comes from @xmath8 ; it will also allow a well - defined construction of an operad .",
    "there are only seven such types of coxeter groups : three spherical ones and four euclidean ones .",
    "figure  [ f : coxdiags ] shows the coxeter graphs associated to the coxeter groups of interest ; we label the edge with its order for @xmath24 .",
    "the number of nodes of a graph is given by the subscript @xmath0 for the spherical groups , whereas the number of nodes is @xmath25 for the euclidean case .",
    "every spherical coxeter group has an associated finite reflection group realized by reflections across linear hyperplanes on a sphere .",
    "every conjugate of a generator @xmath26 acts on the sphere as a reflection in some hyperplane , dividing the sphere into simplicial chambers . the sphere , along with its cellulation is the _ coxeter complex _ corresponding to @xmath15 , denoted @xmath27 .",
    "the hyperplanes associated to each group given in table  [ t : s ] lie on the @xmath28 sphere .",
    "the @xmath15-action on the chambers of @xmath27 is simply transitive , and thus we may associate an element of @xmath15 to each chamber . the number of chambers of @xmath27 comes from the order of the group ."
