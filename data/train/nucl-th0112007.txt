    "fluctuations of strange , baryonic and electric charges studied on event - by - event basis have been repeatedly argued to provide dynamical information on high - energy heavy - ion collisions .",

    "gavin and pruneau @xcite have found that the baryon number fluctuations are very sensitive to the degree of chemical equilibration of the systems produced in heavy - ion collisions at rhic and lhc .",
    "gavin with collaborators @xcite have also suggested that the extraordinary baryon fluctuations can serve as a signal of the qcd tricritical point @xcite .",
    "jeon and koch @xcite and asakwa , heinz and mller @xcite have observed that the fluctuations of baryonic and electric charge are significantly smaller in the equilibrium quark - gluon plasma than in the hadron gas .",
    "assuming that the fluctuations created in the quark phase survive the hadronization , the charge fluctuations normalized to the entropy , which is also assumed to be conserved , can be exploited as an indicator of the quark - gluon plasma formation in nuclear collisions @xcite .",
    "the idea has been further discussed in @xcite .",
    "the na49 measurement @xcite of the @xmath4 ratio at the sps collision energy is somewhat discouraging .",
    "it suggests that the fluctuations in the central collisions are mostly of trivial statistical character .",
    "the conclusion has been theoretically analyzed in @xcite .",
    "the phenix @xcite and preliminary star @xcite results on charge fluctuations show that statistical noise also dominates at rhic energies .",
    "therefore , one faces a problem how to extract a small contribution of ` dynamical ' fluctuations of interest from the statistical background which , unfortunately , strongly depends on the collision centrality . among other methods , the problem can be solved by means of the so - called @xmath0measure @xcite which has been successfully applied to the @xmath5fluctuations @xcite .",
    "@xmath1 equals zero when inter - particle correlations are absent .",
    "it also eliminates ` geometrical ' fluctuations due to the impact parameter variation .",
    "therefore , @xmath1 is ` deaf ' to the statistical noise and ` blind ' to the collision centrality .",
    "applicability of @xmath1 to the fluctuations of chemical composition of the hadronic system produced in nuclear collisions has been already discussed in @xcite . in this paper",
    "we advocate usefulness of @xmath1 in studies of charge fluctuations which are obviously related to the chemical fluctuations .",
    "advantages of @xmath1 in such studies have been already demonstrated in a very recent paper @xcite . here",

    "however , @xmath6 is sensitive not only to the dynamical fluctuations , as is @xmath1 , but to the statistical fluctuations as well .",
    "we express @xmath1 and @xmath6 through the moments of multiplicity distributions and then we compare them to the fluctuation measures suggested by other authors @xcite .",
    "we also compute the measures for a ` background ' model where the particle production is mostly statistical but constrained by charge conservation .",
    "the model represents the classical hadron gas in equilibrium , where hadron resonances are neglected . after taking into account a finite detector acceptance , which strongly reduces the effect of charge conservation , the model s predictions",
    "are compared to the phenix @xcite and preliminary star @xcite data on the electric fluctuations @xcite . at the end",
    ", we discuss the measures where the background fluctuations , i.e. , those given by the ` background ' model , are eliminated .",
    "the measures are free of trivial effects caused by the charge conservation and finite detector acceptance .",

    "@xmath8 is identified with the particle electric , baryonic or any other charge @xmath9 .",
    "one defines a single - particle variable @xmath10 with the overbar denoting averaging over a single particle inclusive distribution .",
    "one easily observes that @xmath11 .",
    "further , we introduce the event variable @xmath12 , which is a multiparticle analog of @xmath13 , defined as @xmath14 , where the summation runs over particles in a given event . by construction , @xmath15 , where @xmath16 represents averaging over events .",
    "finally , the @xmath0measure is defined in the following way : @xmath17 it is evident that @xmath18 , when no inter - particle correlations are present .",
    "the measure also possesses a less trivial property .",
    "namely , @xmath1 is _ independent _ of the distribution of the number of particle sources if the sources are identical and independent from each other @xcite .",
    "thus , the @xmath0measure is ` blind ' to the impact parameter variation as long as the ` physics ' does not change with the collision centrality .",
    "in particular , the @xmath1 is independent of the impact parameter if the nucleus - nucleus collision is a simple superposition of nucleon - nucleon interactions .    as in the case of chemical fluctuations @xcite",
    ", we are going to express @xmath1 through the moments of multiplicity distribution .",
    "then , @xmath1 can be compared to other fluctuation measures which are usually defined in this way .",
    "we first consider a system of particles with two different values of charge . in principle , the system might be multi - component but only two charged components are taken into account . then , @xmath8 equals either @xmath19 or @xmath20 .",

    "in general , @xmath1 vanishes when particles are independent form each other and the event s charge per particle is independent of the event s multiplicity .    if one studies a system with particles carrying more than two different values of a given charge , eqs .",

    "as seen , it vanishes when the fluctuations are of simple statistical origin .",
    "however , for the theoretical suggestion @xcite the fluctuation _ magnitude _ is the main issue .",
    "it has been observed by the authors of @xcite that the statistical fluctuations generated in the quark - gluon phase are significantly smaller than those in the hadron gas .",
    "therefore , if the quark - gluon plasma fluctuations are frozen due to the fast longitudinal expansion of the system the fluctuations observed at the hadron phase are significantly smaller than the statistical fluctuations characteristic for the hadron gas .",

    "( [ phi ] ) , one cane use @xmath50 , which is , as is @xmath1 , insensitive to the distribution of the independent particle sources .",

    "namely , @xmath71 the measure @xmath72 , which is computed in the poissonian approximation ( [ poisson ] ) , has been called the ` statistical ' contribution and denoted as @xmath73 ; @xmath74 the authors of @xcite has also used the ratio @xmath75 and the difference @xmath76 which they call the ` dynamical ' contribution .    comparing eqs .",

    "we remark that @xmath82 when @xmath65 , @xmath83 and the poissonian approximation ( [ poisson ] ) holds .",
    "@xmath1 and @xmath84 vanish by definition in this case .",
    "in this section we discuss a very simple model of charge fluctuations which takes into account the charge conservation and the fact that one usually observes only a fraction of all charged particles produced in nuclear collisions .",
    "we consider the charges of two values , say @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "the multiplicities of positive ( negative ) particles are denoted here as @xmath87 ( @xmath88 ) . at the beginning",
    "we assume that _ all _ charged particles are observed .",
    "then , @xmath89 , where @xmath56 denotes the electric , baryonic or any other conserved charge which is the same for all events under consideration .",

    "the particle is lost with the probability @xmath100 . in this way",
    ", we model both the effect of tracking inefficiency and inefficiency and inefficiency and incomplete detector acceptance . since the number of observed particles is given by the binomial distribution the multiplicity distribution of observed particles reads @xmath101 where @xmath102 corresponds to the produced while @xmath103 to the observed particles .",
    "substituting the distribution ( [ multi - distri1 ] ) into ( [ multi - distri3 ] ) one gets @xmath104    our further considerations are limited to the poissonian approximation .",
    "namely , one assumes that @xmath105 in ( [ multi - distri1 ] ) is a poisson distribution as in a classical hadron gas in equilibrium .",
    "then , one gets @xmath106 one can see here that the multiplicity distribution of negative particles is poissonian but that of positive ones is not .",
    "substituting the above formulas to eqs .",
    "( [ 222 - 2],[111 - 2 ] ) one gets @xmath107 where @xmath108 .",

    "( [ final2b ] ) for @xmath116 ( @xmath117 ) .",
    "otherwise the multiplicity distributions which are assumed to be poissonian can not be poissonian because they must vanish for @xmath118 .",

    "the @xmath7 and @xmath0measure given by eqs.([final1a ] , [ final2a ] ) are shown in figs . 1 - 4 .",
    "as seen , the fluctuations measured by @xmath6 are suppressed by the charge conservation when @xmath121 . however , the suppression is complete for @xmath109 only .",

    "experimental data are often contaminated by particles coming from secondary interactions in the detector material or , in general , from sources which are different than the interactions under study .",
    "these background particles , which are not influenced by charge conservation discussed above , should be also included in our ` background ' model .",
    "we assume that multiplicity distributions of both positive and negative background particles are poissonian and that their average multiplicities equal to each other .",

    "as noted in the introduction , there are phenix @xcite and star @xcite measurements of the electric charge fluctuations in au - au collisions at @xmath131 gev .",
    "the result reported by phenix collaboration is @xmath132 .",
    "it corresponds to 10% most central collisions but the data show no significant centrality dependence .",
    "the measurements have been performed in the pseudorapidity , transverse momentum and azimuthal angle regions : @xmath133 , @xmath134 and @xmath135 .",
    "the amount of background particles , which come from sources different than the au - au interactions of interest , has been estimated as 20% ( @xmath136 ) .    according to the preliminary star results the ratio @xmath129 is within experimental errors independent of centrality and equals @xmath137 for @xmath138 , @xmath139 and full azimuthal angle coverage .",
    "the background is of order of 1% in the case of star and it is further neglected in our considerations . to compare the experimental results to the ` background '",
    "model predictions one needs to estimate two parameters : @xmath99 and @xmath120 .",
    "the brahms collaboration has found @xcite that on average @xmath140 charged particles ( within @xmath141 ) are produced in the most central au - au collisions with 352 participants . among these particles",
    "@xmath142 i.e. @xmath143 % appears in the interval @xmath138 .",
    "the corresponding number is @xmath144 % for @xmath133 . using the exponential parameterization of the transverse momentum distribution ( @xmath145 ) ,",
    "we have also estimated that about 10% and 26% of particles for star and phenix , respectively , are lost because of the low @xmath146 cut - off @xmath147 and @xmath148 . finally , taking into account the tracking efficiency , which is about 90% for star and @xmath149% for phenix",
    ", we have obtained @xmath150 ( star ) and @xmath151 ( phenix ) . in the case of phenix",
    ", an additional factor 0.25 has been included due to the limited azimuthal coverage .",
    "as already mentioned , according to the brahms data @xcite , there is @xmath140 charged particles produced by 352 participants .",
    "this number corresponds , on average , to 140 protons and 212 neutrons in au - au collisions .",
    "therefore , @xmath152 and @xmath153 .",
    "consequently , @xmath154 .    substituting the estimated values of @xmath99 and @xmath120 into eqs .",
    "( [ final2c],[nu / nu ] ) and using eq .  (",
    "[ gamma - v ] ) one finds @xmath155 for phenix and and @xmath156 for star .",
    "both theoreical estimates are somewhat higher than the experimental values : @xmath157 ( phenix ) and @xmath137 ( star ) .",
    "the small differences are presumably due to the neutral resonances which decay into charge hadrons and effectively reduce the charge fluctuations @xcite . as shown by zaranek @xcite ,",
    "the effect of resonances strongly depends on the rapidity window , where the charge hadrons are observed , and the fluctuations can be even enhanced in sufficiently small windows . in any case , we conclude this section by saying that the model of a classical hadron gas in equilibrium approximately explains the experimentaly observed electric charge fluctuations and there is not much space for dynamical effects .",
    "since the effects of charge conservation and incomplete acceptance are of no real interest , it is desirable to use such measures which are insensitive to both effects .",

    "a similar conclusion has been recently drawn by zaranek @xcite who has studied how @xmath160 behaves in variety of simple fluctuation models .",

    "( [ final1a],[final2a ] ) .    when the electric charge fluctuations are studied , @xmath120 is close to unity at sufficiently high collision energies because the multiplicity of the produced charged hadrons is significantly larger than the number of participating protons .",

    ", @xmath120 significantly differs from 1 .",
    "the ratio is also noticeably smaller than unity when the baryon number fluctuations are studied .",

    "we have established the relationships between @xmath1 , @xmath6 and several charge fluctuation measures proposed by other authors .",
    "the measure @xmath63 @xcite has been shown to be equivalent to @xmath6 but for small fluctuations only .",

    "the ` background ' model s predictions are close to the phenix @xcite and preliminary star @xcite results on electrical charge fluctuations .",
    "thus , there is little space for the dynamical effects such as freezing of the fluctuations generated at the quark - gluon plasma phase @xcite .    at the end",
    "we have considered the measures which are supposed to be free of the effects of charge conservation and incomplete acceptance .",
    "we have shown within our ` background ' model that when @xmath120 is noticeably smaller than unity , as in the case of the baryonic charge fluctuations , the simple corrections proposed by other authors do not work properly .",
    "the data on the charge fluctuations @xcite show that the dynamical phenomena do not contribute significantly to the observed fluctuations .",
    "thus , a proper choice of a statistical tool for data analysis is important to quantify and interpret the small effects of interest .",
    "it is also important to carefully eliminate trivial effects as those caused by the charge conservation and non - vanishing net charge .",
