    "given @xmath1 points in the plane , consider the following equivalence relation defined on the set of ( nondegenerate ) triangles spanned by the points : two triangles are _ equivalent _ if they have the same area .",
    "extremal problems typically ask for the maximum cardinality of an equivalence class , and for the minimum number of distinct equivalence classes , in a variety of cases .",
    "a classical example is when we call two segments spanned by the given points equivalent if they have the same length .",
    "bounding the maximum size of an equivalence class is the famous _ repeated distances _",
    "problem @xcite , and bounding the minimum number of distinct classes is the equally famous _ distinct distances _ problem @xcite . in this paper , we make progress on several old extremal problems on triangle areas in two and in three dimensions .",
    "we also study some new and interesting variants never considered before .",
    "our proof techniques draw from a broad range of combinatorial tools such as the szemerdi - trotter theorem on point - line incidences  @xcite , the crossing lemma  @xcite , incidences between curves and points and tangencies between curves and lines , extremal graph theory  @xcite , quasi - planar graphs  @xcite , minkowski - type constructions , repeated distances on the sphere  @xcite , the partition technique of clarkson  @xcite , various charging schemes , etc .    in 1967 , a.  oppenheim ( see @xcite ) asked the following question : given @xmath1 points in the plane and @xmath15 , how many triangles spanned by the points can have area @xmath16 ? by applying an affine transformation ,",
    "one may assume @xmath17 and count the triangles of _ unit _ area .",
    "erds and purdy  @xcite showed that a @xmath18 section of the integer lattice determines @xmath19 triangles of the same area .",
    "they also showed that the maximum number of such triangles is at most @xmath20 . in 1992 , pach and sharir  @xcite improved the exponent and obtained an @xmath2 upper bound using the szemerdi - trotter theorem  @xcite on the number of point - line incidences .",
    "we further improve the upper bound by estimating the number of incidences between the points and a 4-parameter family of quadratic curves .",
    "we show that @xmath1 points in the plane determine at most @xmath21 unit - area triangles .",
    "we also consider the case of points in convex position , for which we construct @xmath1-element point sets that span @xmath3 triangles of unit area .",
    "bra , rote , and swanepoel  @xcite showed that @xmath1 points in the plane determine at most @xmath22 minimum - area triangles , and they pointed out that this bound is asymptotically tight .",
    "we introduce a simple charging scheme to first bring the upper bound down to @xmath23 and then further to @xmath4 .",
    "our charging scheme is also instrumental in showing that a @xmath24 section of the integer lattice spans @xmath5 triangles of minimum area . in the lower bound constructions ,",
    "there are many collinear triples and most of the minimum - area triangles are obtuse .",
    "we show that there are at most @xmath6 _ acute _ triangles of minimum ( nonzero ) area , for any @xmath1-element point set . also , we show that @xmath1 points in ( strictly ) convex position determine at most @xmath6 minimum - area triangles ",
    "these bounds are best possible apart from the constant factors . if no three points are allowed to be collinear , we construct @xmath1-element point sets that span @xmath25 triangles of minimum area .",
    "next we address analogous questions for triangles in 3-space .",
    "the number of triangles with some extremal property might go up ( significantly ) when one moves up one dimension .",
    "for instance , bra , rote , and swanepoel  @xcite have shown that the number of maximum area triangles in the plane is at most @xmath1 ( which is tight ) . in 3-space",
    "we show that this number is at least @xmath11 in the worst case .",
    "in contrast , for minimum - area triangles , we prove that the quadratic upper bound from the planar case remains in effect for 3-space , with a different constant of proportionality .",
    "as mentioned earlier , erds and purdy  @xcite showed that a suitable @xmath1-element section of the integer lattice determines @xmath19 triangles of the same area .",
    "clearly , this bound is also valid in 3-space . in the same paper , via a forbidden graph argument applied to the incidence graph between points and cylinders whose axes pass through the origin , erds and purdy deduced an @xmath26 upper bound on the number of unit - area triangles incident to a common point , and thereby an @xmath9 upper bound on the number of unit - area triangles determined by @xmath1 points in 3-space . here , applying a careful ( and somewhat involved ) analysis of the structure of point - cylinder incidences in @xmath27 , we prove a new upper bound of @xmath28 , for @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the extremely slowly growing inverse ackermann function .    it is conjectured  @xcite that @xmath1 points in @xmath27 , not all on a line , determine at least @xmath31 distinct triangle areas .",
