    "in the standard model , a large number of @xmath0 leptons is expected from the decay of @xmath2 and @xmath3 bosons with 100 @xmath4 of data .",
    "@xmath0 leptons also play an important role in searches for new phenoma like the standard model higgs boson , mssm higgs bosons and susy with large tan @xmath5 since @xmath0 leptons can differentiate between susy models based on polarization information .",
    "they have a mass of @xmath6 = 1.78 gev and decay @xmath7 65% of the time hadronically .",
    "@xmath0 leptons in atlas typically have a collimated calorimetric cluster , 1 or 3 charged decay products and a displaced secondary vertex in the case of 3-prong decays .",
    "the studies are based on data collected with the atlas detector  @xcite at a center - of - mass energy of @xmath8 = 7 tev and correspond to an integrated luminosity of approximately @xmath9 = 244 @xmath10 .",
    "dedicated cuts on the data , haven been applied to select events with back - to - back jets and to enrich the sample with fake @xmath0 candidates from qcd processes that form the primary background  @xcite in searches with @xmath0 lepton final states .    to compare the distribution of the variables used for the @xmath0 reconstruction and identification we used predictions from qcd jets monte carlo ( mc ) samples , generated with the pythia dw tune  @xcite .",
    "the reconstruction of hadronically decaying @xmath0 leptons starts from either calorimeter or track seeds :    * track - seeded candidates start with a seeding track of @xmath11 6 gev , @xmath12 2.5 , and satisfy quality criteria on the impact parameter with respect to the interaction vertex ( @xmath13 2 mm and @xmath14 sin@xmath15 10 mm ) .",
    "* calorimeter - seeded candidates consist of calorimeter jets reconstructed with the anti - kt algorithm ( using a distance parameter @xmath16 = 0.4 ) starting from topological clusters with a calibrated @xmath17 10 gev and @xmath12 2.5 . *",
    "candidates are labeled double - seeded when a seed track and a seed jet are within a distance of    seven variables are currently used as inputs for the identification algorithms to distinguish @xmath0 leptons from qcd jets .",
    "the variables electromagnetic ( em ) radius and track radius are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : var ] .",
    "to identify @xmath0 leptons after the reconstruction , three independent identification ( i d ) algorithms were studied : simple cuts , boosted decision trees ( bdt ) and a projective likelihood ( ll ) .",
    "the cut - based i d uses three variables : @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "three selections corresponding to signal efficiencies of 30% ( tight ) , 50% ( medium ) , and 60% ( loose ) are optimized to maximize the rejection of qcd jets .",
    "the background efficiency for all three selections is shown in table  [ tab : cut_eff_bkgd ] .",
    "the background efficiency @xmath21 requires @xmath22 = 1 or @xmath22 = 3 .",

[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     two effects contribute to systematic uncertainties :    * * the transverse momentum calibration : * two calibration schemes have been compared , a global cell energy - density weighting ( gcw ) and a simple @xmath24 and @xmath25 dependent calibration ( em+jes ) .",
