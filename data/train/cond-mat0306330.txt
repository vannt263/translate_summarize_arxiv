    "silicon is an indirect gap semiconductor with six minima ( valleys ) in the conduction band . in the case of ( 001)-oriented wafers , the long axes of two of the fermi ellipsoids are perpendicular to the @xmath1 plane of a @xmath2 interface ( with @xmath3 ) , while the long axes of the other four have an in - plane orientation ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "a quantum well is formed at the interface by applying a positive voltage @xmath5 to the gate , and the electron motion in @xmath6 direction is quantized .",
    "the difference in @xmath7 causes a splitting of the energy spectrum of bound states into two independent ladders of levels : the twofold - degenerate ladder of eigenenergies @xmath8 and a fourfold - degenerate ladder @xmath9 . due to the higher effective mass in the @xmath6-direction , the lowest energy level in the potential",
    "well is @xmath10 .",
    "the self - consistent calculations ( see e.g @xcite ) predicts that the excited levels @xmath0 and @xmath11 are very close on energy scale and become occupied ( cross the fermi energy @xmath12 ) at the carrier concentration @xmath13 . while @xmath14 increases linearly with @xmath5 , the fourfold - degenerate @xmath0 stays `` pinned '' to the fermi energy and @xmath15 is almost constant even for the highest possible gate voltages . in both cases",
    "the difference between the fermi energy and the eigenenergies of excited states is at most a few percent of @xmath16 , the difference between the fermi energy and the ground level , for all gate voltages .",
    "in our experiments we have employed the hall bar samples of russian provenance , with 200 nm thick gate oxide and the top mobilities @xmath17 above @xmath18 at liquid helium temperature .",
    "the concentration of electrons in the inversion layer is related to the gate voltage by @xmath19 with the threshold voltage close to @xmath20 .",
    "the samples are 0.25 mm wide and 0.5 mm long with the distance between potential leads 0.625 mm .",
    "the highest concentration of carriers @xmath21 is reached for @xmath22 .",
    "this is well above @xmath23 , the onset voltage of the occupation of excited subbands . according to our numerical modeling of the electronic structure @xcite , @xmath24 while @xmath25 at the highest concentration .",
    "the samples exhibit the previously unreported features , which turned out to be important in experiments with high carrier concentration .",
    "the metallic ( aluminium ) gate of samples overlaps to the thicker oxide outside the lithographically defined hall bar shape .",
    "the thin molybdenium layer separates the aluminum gate and the silicon oxide .",
    "the mo layer can be seen by cross - sectional electron microscopy ( fig .",
    "[ sample ] ) and allows identification of a step in the thickness of oxide layers .    therefore , a parallel channel is formed at the sample edges .",
    "this explains two series of magnetoresistance oscillations at high concentration of carriers we reported in our previous publications ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "an attempt to attribute the second series to the sdh oscillations of electrons from the second subband turned out to be wrong , the ratio of periods of the two series of sdh oscillation was 9 : 2 , i.e. it corresponds to the ratio of the two oxide layers .    to suppress the effect of parallel edge - channels , approximately @xmath26 of the gate metal was lithographically removed on the sample edges .",
    "after this procedure the second series of sdh oscillations , corresponding to the sample edge channels , disappeared .",
    "the high mobility of samples was not reduced by this procedure .",
    "the magnetoresistance of si(001 ) mosfets with high density of electrons in the inversion layer was measured as a function of the magnetic field @xmath27 up to 11   t for a series of fixed gate voltages in the bath of pumped @xmath28he . the standard ac technique was used with a frequency 13   hz .",
    "the measuring current @xmath29 yields the current density @xmath30 .    here",
    "we report results obtained for two samples .",
    "the sample a has a top mobility @xmath31 at 0.45  k. the magnetoresistance and the hall resistance of this sample are presented in figs .",
    "[ resa ] and [ halla ] for a dense set of gate voltages .",
    "the sample b magnetoresistance ( the top mobility @xmath32 is shown in fig .",
    "[ resb ] only for selected gate voltages @xmath5 . for this sample",
    "we also show the current - density and temperature dependence of the magnetoresistance at the maximum gate voltage @xmath33 ( see figs .",
    "[ current ] and [ temperature ] ) .",
    "anomalous behavior was observed for all gate voltages corresponding to occupied excited subbands .",
    "first , a novel series of sdh oscillations appeared , most pronounced at the highest gate voltage 120  v where the amplitude of sdh oscillations of the first subband is very small .",
    "the oscillations are periodic in @xmath34 .",
    "their period is almost independent of @xmath5 and close to  @xmath35 for both samples .",
    "second , a strong negative magnetoresistance and the nonlinear field dependence of the hall resistance accompany the novel oscillations at high carrier concentrations .",
    "both the novel oscillations and the negative magnetoresistance are most pronounced at the lowest temperatures ( @xmath36 0.4  k ) and the smallest density of current ( @xmath37a ) used in our measurements .",
    "the influence of the current density on the observed effect is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ current ] .",
    "the current was first increased by an order of magnitude and then by two orders of magnitude .",
    "both amplitudes of the novel oscillations and the negative magnetoresistance are gradually suppressed , while the amplitude of sdh oscillations from the main series remain unchanged .",
    "an independent measurement , in which the current density was kept low and the bath temperature was increased to 4.2 k , confirmed that the suppression of amplitudes of the novel oscillations and of the negative magnetoresistance is really due to the overheating of 2d electron gas in the inversion layer .",
    "again , the amplitude of oscillations from the main series are unchanged .",
    "we attribute the observed anomalies to the large difference between the electron structure of the ground subband and excited subbands .",
    "the twofold - degenerate ground subband contains many landau levels even for highest magnetic fields .",
    "the electron mobility in this subband quickly decreases with increasing gate voltage .",
    "the roughness of si / sio interface dominates the electron scattering .",
    "the dingle temperature is well above the electron layer temperature as witnessed by the temperature independent amplitude of the sdh oscillations . the quasiclassical picture of the electric conductivity seems to be relevant .",
    "the occupation of excited subbans is very small and only a small number of landau levels should be occupied even at relatively week @xmath27 .",
    "the electrons in the subband attached to the level @xmath11 have an effective mass 0.19 , the same as the electrons in the ground subband . with the difference @xmath38 of a few mev at high concentration limit",
    ", the first landau level can cross the fermi energy at relatively week @xmath39 .",
    "then the subband is emptied and the density of states of electrons belonging to the twofold - degenerate ladder is halved .",
    "this can contribute to reduction of the scattering rate and to the negative magnetoresistance .",
    "on the other hand , we believe that the fourfold - degenerate subband is not emptied by increasing @xmath27 and that the level @xmath0 stays pinned to the fermi energy also in the presence of the magnetic field .",
    "we suggest that it is responsible for the novel oscillations the period of which does not depend on @xmath5 .",
    "the landau level separation in this subband is smaller due to the larger cyclotron effective mass @xmath400.43 .",
    "therefore , the amplitude of oscillations should be more sensitive to the temperature , in agreement with the experimental data .",
    "the experiments also indicate that the dingle temperature of these electrons is rather low . assuming the fourfold degeneracy",
    ", the concentration of electrons corresponding to @xmath41 would be close to @xmath42 .",
    "two very different groups of electrons contribute to the magnetoresistance of a sample with high electron concentrations : the electrons from the ground subband and the more mobile electrons from the excited subbands . while the transport mediated by the ground state electrons should by described quasiclassically ,",
    "the quantization of electron states is important for excited subbands . therefore , the deviations from the standard quasiclassical model of transport by two groups of carries should be anticipated .    with increasing temperature",
    "the energy @xmath43 becomes comparable with the separation between landau levels .",
    "the electron - electron scattering increases , the importance of a small group of electrons from the excited subband decreases and the observed anomalies are suppressed .",
