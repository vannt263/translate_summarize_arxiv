    "the cold dark matter ( @xmath1cdm ) paradigm predicts that stellar halos surrounding large spiral galaxies formed through the accretion and tidal disruption of satellite galaxies , a notion previously postulated @xcite on empirical grounds from the character of stellar populations found in our own milky way halo .",
    "simulations have shown that the fossil records of those merger events may be detected nowadays in the form of coherent stellar structures in the outer regions of the host galaxies .",
    "the most spectacular of these fossil structures are probably the formation of dynamically cold stellar streams , which are similar to long rivers of stars ( and likely dark matter ; @xcite ) tidally stripped from a disrupting dwarf galaxy and wrapped around the host galaxy disk , roughly tracing the orbit of the progenitor satellite .",
    "the now well - studied sagittarius ( sgr ) tidal stream surrounding the milky way @xcite and the giant stream in andromeda galaxy @xcite are archetypes in the local group of these kinds of fossilized satellite galaxy mergers and provide obvious support for the scenario that tidally disrupted dwarf galaxies are an important contributor to the stellar halos of disk galaxies .",
    "unfortunately , while the milky way and even m31 streams are close enough to be resolved into individual stars that can be studied in detail , these nearby streams can also span vast areas of sky , which currently presents particular challenges to their study .",
    "in contrast , tidal streams around more distant systems can be imaged in commensurately smaller fields of view , and  at least for those streams seen in diffuse light  with equal contrast , given the constancy of surface brightness with distance . however , over the past decade , only a few cases of confirmed stellar tidal streams have been detected in disk galaxies outside the local group ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , in contrast with the increasing number of tidal structures detected in the milky way and m31 in recent years .",
    "the presence of a multitude of tidal streams , arcs , shells and other irregular structures possibly related to ancient merger events in the deep panoramic view of the andromeda halo @xcite reveals the level of stellar sub - structure that might be present in the halos of nearby external spiral galaxies .",
    "extragalactic streams also offer a unique perspective to address some interesting questions : is the abundant number of stellar streams exceptional in the local group or are tidal streams as common as has been predicted by current cosmological models ? what can we learn about the dark - matter halos of the host galaxies from these streams ?",
    "can we use these systems to study the star formation history of the disrupting dwarf galaxies ?",
    "the frequency of streams , their stellar population and orbital properties provide important clues to the nature of the stream progenitors , lend insights into the underlying gravitational potential and structure of the massive dark halo they inhabit , and constrain hierarchical models of galaxy formation favored by current cosmological models . in that respect ,",
    "an interesting parameter that may possibly be constrained through the detection of tidal streams in external galaxies is the flattening of the dark matter halos surrounding the host galaxies .",
    "the spatial and kinematic distributions of stream particles are fairly sensitive to this quantity ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) and the shapes and orientations of dark matter halos with respect to the disk axi - symmetry plane reflect the nature of dark matter ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for shape estimates for cold , self - interacting and hot dark matter models , respectively ) . for example , @xmath1cdm models predict that dark matter halos are triaxial , with minor axes perpendicular to the disk plane . on average",
    "the minor - to - major axis ratio near the center is @xmath2 @xcite , although halos may become considerably rounder after the baryonic galactic components have formed @xcite or if dark matter is warm @xcite .",
    "thus , using tidal streams in external galaxies might be an ideal tool to obtain a significant statistical sample of flattening values that can be compared against predictions from cosmological models .",
    "these arguments suggest that a systematic survey for tidal streams around extragalactic systems would provide a new way to explore galaxy structure and evolution , with direct constraints on cosmological models .",
    "undertaking such a tidal stream survey was urged by @xcite in their comprehensive discussion of the appearance and detectability of extragalactic tidal streams .",
    "their analysis suggests that a survey of 100 parent galaxies reaching to a surface brightness of 30 mag arcsec@xmath3 would reveal many tens of tidal features ; a slightly higher estimate of about one per galaxy is obtained in their most recent reanalysis of the problem @xcite .",
    "these authors also point out the advantage of exploring thin , edge - on disk systems because of the favorable orientation for detecting low surface brightness features against light of the parent system and the ability to assess limits on the mass ratio of the satellite and parent galaxy by whether the disk of the parent appears to be disturbed .",
    "@xcite estimated that a search strategy designed to obtain reliable photometry along the stream length would require about ten times longer exposure times that those aimed at detection only .",
    "we adopted this approach of striving for deep images to detect the full path of the tidal stream , which , in the absence of kinematic data , is the main input for comparison with n - body simulations ( see sec.[nbody ] ) . using this strategy",
    ", we started a pilot survey on some nearby galaxies which has proven the concept with the discovery of a giant stellar tidal stream around the spiral galaxy ngc4013 @xcite and the detection of the faintest parts of the extended disk of the nearby spiral galaxy m94 ( trujillo et al .",
    "2008 , in preparation ) .    with the hope of improving our understanding of the known tidal stream in ngc5907 , discovered by @xcite , and to demonstrate the sensitivity of the small aperture telescope used in our survey ( see sec.[data ] ) , we reobserved this system as a commissioning target . in this paper",
    "we present our very deep image of ngc5907 that reveals additional loops of debris in the halo ( see sec.[sec : shape ] ) beyond those reported by @xcite .",
    "n - body simulations , described in sec.[nbody ] show that most of the newly found features can be explained as pieces of a spectacular , multiply - wrapped stream of debris from the tidal disruption of a single companion galaxy .",
    "we also discuss in sec.[discussion ] the applications of such surveys to glean a deeper theoretical understanding of galaxy formation and evolution , beyond placing strong constraints on present cosmological scenarios .",
    "this foray into a more systematic look for tidal streams in the nearby universe has yielded promising results that encourage more aggressive attention to this new way of understanding galaxy structure and evolution as advocated by the above theoretical studies .",

    "we have obtained deep optical images of ngc5907 with the 0.5-meter ritchey - chretien telescope of the blackbird remote observatory ( bbro ) situated in the sacramento mountains ( new mexico , usa ) .",
    "we used a santa barbara instrument group ( sbig ) stl-11100 ccd camera , which yields a large field of view ( 27.7@xmath4 @xmath5 18.2@xmath4 ) at a plate scale of 0.45 arcseconds pixel@xmath6 . the image set consists of multiple deep exposures with a non - infrared , clear luminance ( @xmath7 ) , a red , a green and a blue filter from the sbig custom scientific filter set .",

    "column 3 refers to the total exposure time of the co - added images from each filter obtained with each run .",
    "the science images were reduced using the standard procedures for bias correction and flat - fielding .",
    "a master dark and bias frame was created by combining 10 dark sub - exposures each produced at the same exposure length and camera temperature settings used for the luminance and the filtered images .",
    "a master flat was produced by combining 10 separate sky flat exposures for each filter .",
    "the red , green and blue filtered exposures were separately combined ( using a median procedure ) to produce red , green and blue master images that represented the total exposure time for each color filter .",
    "these color images were obtained to investigate the color of the structures surrounding the galaxy and to extend the overall exposure of the final luminance image .",
    "the master images for each filter were subsequently summed to produce a synthetic luminance image that represented the total exposure time of all the color filter data .",
    "the synthetic luminance image was then combined ( using a median procedure ) with all the clear filtered luminance sub - exposures ( see table 1 ) to increase the contrast of the diffuse light .",
    "the resulting final image thus represents the sum of all available ccd exposures collected for this project , with an accumulated exposure time of 11.35 hours ( including 5.75 hours in the clear luminance filter ) .    to enhance the faint structures around ngc5907 and disentangle their true appearance from image noise effects",
    ", the contrast and detail of the summed image was optimized using two well - known image processing techniques : i)a histogram equalization of the image using a non - linear transfer function ; and ii ) gaussian blur filtering @xcite .",
    "the first method is very effective to reveal very faint features in images that contains a large dynamical range , as it is the case of a spiral galaxy with a very bright , compact stellar disk surrounded by a very faint tidal stream . with the purpose of suppressing the bright portions of the image and intensifying the fainter parts of the stream",
    ", histogram equalization employs a monotonic , non - linear mapping which re - assigns the intensity values of pixels in the input image such that the output image contains an uniform distribution of intensities . in our case",
    ", we used an iterative process that involves several passes of a s - shaped histogram operator to the total image .",
    "while this method was successful in revealing the presence of the surrounding faint structure , it also resulted in the over saturation of contrast and significantly reduced intensity variances within the stellar stream .",
    "once the image was contrasted , a low - pass gaussian filter with a radius of 2 pixels was applied to reduce the low level noise contaminating the image .",
    "the resulting noise - filtered image is shown in fig.[bbroimage ] .    as discussed above",
    ", our search technique was designed to very clearly reveal the position and morphology of faint structures ( for example , by combining all the available images obtained in different filters with the clear luminance deep images ) , but does not permit accurate photometry . therefore ,",
    "follow - up photometric observations are needed to measure accurate surface brightnesses and to estimate the total luminosity of the detected tidal debris ( see sec .",
    "furthermore , the use of an uncalibrated luminance filter prevents us from estimating the surface brightness limit that we reached in our deep probe of the ngc5907 halo in any particular , standard photometric band .",
    "however , the detection of obvious diffuse light structures fainter than those reported in previous studies ( with a surface brightness as faint as @xmath8 27.7 mag arcsec@xmath3 ; see sect .  [ sb ] ) , suggests that our images reach a surface brightness magnitude fainter than the @xmath9 mag arcsec@xmath3 limit of the deep ngc5907 image by @xcite and @xcite , and the @xmath10 mag arcsec@xmath3 limited image by @xcite .",
    "regardless , this result is a striking example of the scientific potential of modest aperture telescopes ( 0.5-meter ) operating under very dark skies for probing the diffuse structure of galaxies .",
    "in this section we focus on the outer , diffuse light properties revealed in figures [ bbroimage ] and [ bbroimageplabel ] , but several comments about the disk are worth pointing out briefly .",
    "our image shows that the disk of ngc5907 extends in diameter well beyond where most previous images have tracked its disk light . the existence of this light challenges previous claims that the disk is _ sharply truncated _ ( in the sense of the galaxy s outer edge ) at a nominal _ cut - off _ radius of about 6  from the center @xcite . from the original radial profiles ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* fig.9 and fig.7 , respectively ) there is clearly a radial break feature visible , however , it should be better described as a sharp change of slope than a complete _ cut - off_. this profile shape , well fitted with a broken exponential function , is a relatively common feature of late - type spiral galaxies @xcite .    figures [ bbroimage ] and [ bbroimageplabel ] clearly show that ngc5907 has a stellar warp , which clearly extends after the nominal cut - off radius .",
    "the observable faint radial extensions of the disk are strongly bent in the same sense as the obvious hi warp found by @xcite , and are most strongly visible on the northwest disk edge .",
    "note , these same extended disk features can also be seen in fig .  2 of @xcite , and just about in the near infrared image of @xcite .",
    "evidence for the warp in optical light was also previously seen in the optical disk at smaller radii by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite and was , of course , pointed out as well by @xcite .",
    "the most striking features , and the primary focus of the present discussion , is the newly revealed network of arcing loops of diffuse light around ngc5907 that are likely the product of the classical satellite tidal disruption process . our deep image ( see fig.[bbroimageplabel ] )",
    "reveals that the ring - shaped feature to the southeast , we refer to this here as the _ se loop _ , discovered by @xcite is only the brighter part of a large - scale complex of stellar debris arcs around ngc5907 .",
    "we count about a half - dozen other additional arc - like features in our image . on the eastern side",
    ", it is possible to detect the full extension of the se loop , turning around and falling toward the disk .",
    "this yields a vertical structure ( labeled e1 in fig.[bbroimageplabel ] ) that crosses the galactic plane and possibly extends to the other side of the galaxy .",
    "in addition , an independent structure ( labeled e2 ) , somewhat parallel to the se - loop , can be seen to be shifted about @xmath11 10 @xmath4 to the northwest of the @xcite structure and sweeping almost 180@xmath12 around the center of ngc5907 .",
    "although the accretion origin of this structure appears a reasonable hypothesis , we must point out its extraordinary complexity  especially on the western side of ngc5907 where we find a faint , long tail extending @xmath11 25 kpc from the disk , labeled _ sw tail _ in fig .",
    "[ bbroimageplabel ] , and previously reported only in some studies ( see fig .",
    "1b in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . from south to north",
    ", three additional arcs are detected on the west side of the disk ( labeled w1 , w2 and w3 , respectively ) .",
    "these features appear to cross each other fairly closely to the disk major axis of ngc5907 , which makes it difficult to discern which of these arcs are the continuation of the features observed on the eastern side , that is , the se loop , e1 , and e2 .",
    "for example , it is obvious that the se loop extends to the western side , but it becomes unclear which path it takes ( e.g. , sw tail or w1 ) . on the other hand",
    ", it is clear that the w3 arc is the westernmost continuation of the e2 loop .",
    "interestingly , this stream piece turns around , crosses the w2 arc and finishes in the main disk again , forming the w1 arc .",
    "it is however more difficult to assess whether the w2 arc ( the most diffuse discernible structure , highly contaminated by the diffuse light of the galaxy disk ) or w1 could be the western extension of the e1 tail .      with the image in fig .",
    "[ bbroimageplabel ] alone it is impossible to conclude whether the smaller features on the western side are the continuation of the loops on the eastern side and so whether the whole set of these identified tidal structures originate from a single or different accretion events . in general , the largest features ( e.g. , the se and e2 loops )",
    "have similar shapes , angular lengths , radius of curvature , and separations from the center of ngc5907 .",
    "in addition , all of the features ( large and small ) share a similar projected width , @xmath11 7 kpc ( consistent with the value reported by * ? ? ?",
    "* see sec.[sb ] ) , as well as a similar , rather bright surface brightness ( see sec.[sb ] ) .",
    "these similarities all provide circumstantial evidence that the various features may all come from a single , old ) and not to the age of its stellar population , that is unknown . ] stellar tidal stream  similar to the multiply - wrapped sgr dwarf galaxy stream around the milky way .",
    "these structures provide a rather unique and spectacular external view of the classical rosette - like , multi - loop patterns expected for tidally disrupting dwarf galaxies seen in n - body simulations ( such as those made of the sgr system  e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "there are further analogies of the ngc5907 structures with the sgr stream in that they have a similar linear cross - sectional width ( suggesting similarly massed progenitors ) , apogalacticon and apparent orbital ellipticity ( suggesting a similar orbit ) , and surface brightness and length ( suggesting a similar mass loss rate and age of interaction ) . in section [ nbody ]",
    "we explore this working hypothesis in detail and provide a comprehensive , illustrative model that further supports the notion that a single , sgr - like system could create a substantial fraction of the newly found diffuse structures .",
    "interestingly , while the surface brightness of these loops does show some modulation , nowhere among these features do we see a bright spot that could be identified with a remaining dwarf satellite _",
    "core_. thus , our image provides no definitive insights on the current position and final fate ( that is , whether or not it is completely disrupted by now ) of the progenitor satellite galaxy ( since it could be hidden behind the disk ) .",
    "however , the full panoramic view of the ngc5907 system in figure [ bbroimage ] provides no evidence for any association of the stellar streams with the dwarf irregular galaxy pgc54419 ( a confirmed satellite of ngc 5907 situated at 36.9 kpc projected distance from its center ) , as proposed by @xcite .",
    "we shall return to this subject in sec.[discussion ] .      as mentioned above ,",
    "there have been a number of deep photometric studies of ngc5907 , and a popular point of discussion is the claimed detection and properties of `` excess '' , non - disk light away from and perpendicular to the disk and commonly attributed to a diffuse luminous halo @xcite .",
    "figure [ bbroimage ] clearly shows how these previous studies may have been affected by the coherent tidal stream structures , especially w1 and w2 , which lie along the southwestern minor axis at distances where such studies have made the  halo \" detections .",
    "indeed , the very shape of the  inner triangle \" of light formed by w1 and w2 can be discerned in the image analyzed by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see , e.g. , their fig .  1 ) , and a similar asymmetry seen in the photometric data by @xcite",
    "may also be explained by these same structures ( e.g. , see the lower right panel of fig .",
    "[ bbroimageplabel ] in * ? ? ?",
    "one wonders if the presence of these structures may also explain the differences in the colors of the  halo \" light found on either side of the disk shown in figure 1 of @xcite .",
    "@xcite have previously suspected that the presence of tidal debris light ( particularly on the western side ) might be significantly contaminating the  halo \" light that was previously reported ; these authors concluded that , when combined with residual scattered light from foreground stars , this debris effectively reduces the need for a faint , extended halo .",
    "we concur that indeed these previous studies were probably strongly affected by the presence of the `` w '' features  but of course this _ is _ actually  halo \" light , it is just in the form of tidal debris in what is obviously the active hierarchical formation of the ngc5907 halo .",
    "however , a low surface brightness halo ( @xmath8 30 - 31 mag arcsec@xmath3 ) similar to m31 one could be present ( fliri et al . 2008 , in preparation ) .      ideally , one would like to use the bbro image to measure the surface brightness of the observed stream .",
    "however , there are some concerns that prevent us from extracting this information directly from this image .",
    "first of all , the image is the result of the combination of multiple images in different filters with those taken using an extremely wide ( luminance ) filter to maximize the photon collection .",
    "this makes a calibration of the stars present in the bbro image using the same stars observed through standard filters non - trivial .",
    "significant color corrections are expected .",
    "in addition , the resulting background on the bbro image is slightly patchy ( see fig .",
    "1 ) , and , more importantly , the field of view is not large enough to allow us to properly estimate the sky level . for the above reasons we have decided to adopt the value reported by @xcite for the mean surface brightness of the stream in the ne loop in the @xmath13-band  i.e. 27.7 mag arcsec@xmath3",
    " and rely on the bbro image only to determine the morphology , position and width of the stream in the sky .    in order to determine the total luminosity of the tidal stream we first calculate the total area covered by the tidal tails",
    "to do so , we estimate the stream width in two different strips a and b located in the bright stream piece detected by sheng et al .",
    "( 1998 ) ( see fig .  [ bbroimageplabel ] ) .",
    "the surface brightness distribution in these two strips is shown in fig .",
    "[ width ] .",
    "the width of the stream in each of these strips is estimated using a gaussian function and the full width half maximum ( fwhm ) of these gaussian fits are used as a measurement of the stream width . to be conservative ,",
    "we take the minimum of the fwhm measured in both regions ( i.e. @xmath11103 arcsec ; see fig .",
    "[ width ] ) as representative of the width of the stream . at the distance of ngc5907 the above value corresponds to @xmath117 kpc .",
    "subsequently , we calculate the length of the stream by placing elliptical annuli at the inner at outer sides of each loop . here",
    "we consider that the stream of fig .",
    "[ bbroimageplabel ] can be described by the loop l1 formed by the sw - se - e1-w2 arcs and the half - loop l2 formed by the w3-e2 arcs .",
    "the area of each loop is then calculated as @xmath14 , where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the semi - major axis of the elliptical annuli and are related as @xmath17 .",
    "the minor - to - major axis ratio of the ellipses has an estimated value of @xmath18 for l1 and l2 .",
    "we find that for l1 @xmath19 arcsec@xmath20 kpc , so that @xmath21 kpc@xmath22 , and for l2 @xmath23 kpc , which implies @xmath24 kpc@xmath22 .",
    "on doing this , the approximate area subtended by these pieces of the stream is @xmath25 kpc@xmath22 .    using this estimate of the area of the se loop and e2 loop",
    ", the reported mean surface brightness of 27.7 mag arcsec@xmath3 by @xcite ( i.e. @xmath110.217 l@xmath26 pc@xmath3 in the @xmath13-band ) implies a total @xmath13-band luminosity for the stream of @xmath112@xmath510@xmath27 l@xmath26 .",
    "this value is one order of magnitude brighter than the luminosity reported for the sgr dwarf galaxy ( @xmath111.9@xmath510@xmath28 , majewski et al .",
    "2003 ) , but it is still consistent with the possibility that this complex structure of debris resulted from the disruption of a single dwarf galaxy during a recent interaction with ngc5907 ( see sec .  [ comparison ] ) .",
    "we have also roughly estimated the total stellar mass of the stream by using the color @xmath290.5@xmath300.3 given in @xcite . using the prescription given by @xcite the above",
    "color implies a ( @xmath31)@xmath32 @xmath33 and consequently a total stellar mass of @xmath113.5@xmath510@xmath27 m@xmath26 .",
    "this value is very uncertain due to the large error in the stream color .",
    "so , the total stellar mass should only be taken as a rough estimate of the stellar mass in the stream within an order of magnitude .",
    "given the large uncertainties of our estimate it is encouraging that the above stellar mass estimate is similar to the one estimated ( @xmath112@xmath510@xmath27 m@xmath34 ) by @xcite using dynamical considerations .    unfortunately , none of the individual color filtered data set were of sufficient exposure length to reveal hints of the faint surrounding structures with enough signal  to  noise to permit detection or surface brightness measurement .",
    "therefore , it is not possible to constrain a stellar population gradients along the stream from this study .",
    "the clear picture of a repeatedly wrapped tidal stream around ngc5907 naturally suggests fitting the system with n - body models .",
    "typically the number of free parameters implemented by n - body models of satellite accretion in external galaxies is vast . in the case of ngc5907 , although the mass within the luminous radius is well constrained by measurements of its circular velocity curve , no information is available on the flattening of its potential on the scales where the tidal remnants are observed ( @xmath3550 kpc in projection ) .",
    "additionally , the present position and velocity vectors of the progenitor system are unknown as well as its mass and luminous profiles .",
    "currently , the only available information on the stream is its surface brightness and projected geometry with respect to the host .",
    "this introduces a new free parameter , which is the projection angle between the line of sight and the orbital plane of the stream progenitor .",
    "fortunately , ngc5907 presents an edge - on disk projection that eliminates a second projection angle between the line - of - sight vector and the axi - symmetry plane of the disk .",
    "kinetically data of bright dynamical tracers ( as planetary nebula and globular clusters)along the stream would help to disentangle the projection effects and to constrain the satellite orbit .",
    "unfortunately , these can not be readily obtained from individual stars with the present observational capabilities owing to the large distance of ngc5907 .",
    "the huge degeneracy of the problem weakens any possible constraint obtained through n - body modeling of the stream and , in fact , it is presently unclear how much information can be gleaned from streams in external galaxies using this technique .",
    "that is an open question that goes beyond the scope of this paper and that will be studied in a future contribution ( pearrubia et al .",
    ", _ in prep _ )",
    ". nevertheless , in this paper our n - body models are only used to answer a more simple question : can the complex stellar structure be the result of a _ single _ merger event ?",
    "this reduces the problem of finding one of the many possible free parameter combinations that yields a reasonably good match to the observations .",
    "we examine several illustrative n - body simulations of dwarf spheroidal systems disrupting in a spiral galaxy having properties similar to ngc5907 .",
    "this galaxy is an sc spiral with a maximum rotational velocity of @xmath36 km s@xmath6 and absolute magnitude @xmath37 @xcite  similar , therefore , to the milky way .",
    "here we assume a static host galaxy potential during the satellite orbit .",
    "as @xcite show , the geometry and kinematics of a tidal stream are independent of the past evolution of the host galaxy potential and solely reflect the present properties of the host .",
    "our satellite galaxy realizations are injected in a host galaxy that has the following components : a @xcite disk , a @xcite bulge and a navarro , frenk & white ( 1996,1997 ) dark matter halo .",
    "the determination of the disk , bulge and dark matter halo mass from the circular velocity curve of ngc 5907 is very uncertain due to the well - known disk - halo degeneracy .",
    "here we adopt values that are similar to those derived by @xcite by fitting the observed rotation curve : the disk and bulge masses are @xmath38 and @xmath39 , respectively .",

    "these values were selected to reproduce the projected width and extent of the stellar tidal stream detected in ngc5907 ( see below ) .    in order to find an illustrative model that provides a reasonable match to the projected distribution of debris",
    ", we run a set of n - body simulations that explore some of the satellite s orbital and structural parameters .",
    "following @xcite , we assume that the orbital apocenter corresponds to the maximum separation of the stream from the center of ngc 5907 ( i.e. that of the se loop ) , so that @xmath61 kpc . to estimate the orbital eccentricity , we vary the peri to apocentric distance ratio ( @xmath62 ) . following the estimates of johnston , sackett & bullock ( 2001 )",
    ", we explore three different progenitor masses ( @xmath63 and @xmath64 ) . to derive the age of the stream",
    "we integrate each n - body realization a maximum time of 9 gyr , recording the positions and velocities of the n - body particles in 70 snap - shots ( i.e. with a time interval of 0.14 gyr ) .",
    "each snap - shot is then visually inspected varying the projection angle ( @xmath65 ) .      in fig .",
    "[ nbodyfig ] we show an illustrative single - accretion model that produces a good overall match to most of the observed structures .",
    "this suggests that most of the tidal loops could have formed from the accretion of a single dwarf satellite with an initial total mass of @xmath66 .",
    "for this particular model , the satellite has lost 60% of its mass due to tidal stripping after 3.6 gyr of evolution .",
    "the progenitor moves on a highly inclined orbit ( orbital inclination @xmath67 with respect to the disk plane ) , with relatively low eccentricity ( the peri and apocenters are , respectively , @xmath68 kpc and @xmath61 kpc , which translates into an intermediate orbital eccentricity of @xmath69 ) and a radial orbital period of @xmath70 gyr .",
    "remarkably , these parameters are fairly similar to those derived for the sgr stream in the milky way ( law et al . 2005 ) . in addition , we find that the projection angle formed by the line - of - sight and the orbital plane vector has a present value of @xmath71 ( an edge - on view of the stream implies @xmath72 ) , which explains the considerable elongation of the stream in the vertical direction",
    ".    in general , our model agrees with the previous model of @xcite , although a few differences must be noticed .",
    "for example , @xcite assume a perfectly polar orbit ( @xmath73 ) , which is therefore not affected by orbital precession , and derive a slightly higher orbital eccentricity ( @xmath74 ) , probably a result of the smaller amount of observational constraints ( only the se loop was known at that time ) .",
    "our model also provides a comprehensive explanation of the relation between the different loops and arcs discussed in   [ sec : shape ] .",
    "in particular , this solution suggests that the leading arm forms the se - loop , bending toward the disk along the e1 loop and giving rise to the arc w2 after it crosses the ngc5907 disk .",
    "the trailing tail of the tidal stream would be visible as the arc w1 in the west , and its continuation bends toward the east direction to form the w3 arc and the e2 loop after it crosses the disk . the longest stream piece that fades away towards the west ( the sw tail ; fig .",
    "2 ) would correspond to the oldest piece of the trailing tail with particles that , according to our model , were stripped around 3.6 gyr ago .",
    "although the shape of our illustrative stream model can reproduce most of the prominent observed features , it also predicts the continuation of the e2 loop that extends between the se loop and e1 arc .",
    "this feature is not obvious in fig.[bbroimage ] , although the presence of an excess of light in the area where this arc would be located ( denoted as ov in fig .",
    "[ bbroimageplabel ] ) is noticeable .",
    "interestingly , the model also successfully reproduces the strong east - west stream asymmetry ( the se loop reaches a projected distance of @xmath75 kpc , whereas the sw tail only extends out to @xmath76 kpc ) , which results from the eccentric orbit of the progenitor system and an inclined line - of - sight projection .",
    "this illustrative model also provides a reasonable explanation for the fate of the progenitor satellite .",
    "it suggests that the dwarf could have survived but that its remnant core ( black points in fig .",
    "[ nbodyfig ] ) might presently be hidden behind the galaxy disk , @xmath77 kpc from the galactic center .",
    "if this hypothesis is correct , it leads us to conclude that the ne ring feature of @xcite corresponds to a young piece of the stream .",
    "in addition , our model suggests that the ngc5907 stellar stream may be relatively old , with the fainter , outer loop material ( sw tail in fig .",
    "2 ) becoming unbound at least 3.6 gyrs ago ( blue points in fig .  [ nbodyfig ] ) .",
    "the new tidal tails presented in this paper are considerably older than the previous stream pieces discovered by shang et al .",

    "the stellar stream around ngc 5907 may represent therefore one of the most ancient wraps of a tidal stream ever reported in the halo of a spiral galaxy .",
    "in this paper we present in detail an extragalactic perspective of a stellar tidal stream surrounding the nearby spiral galaxy ngc5907 .",
    "this ghostly structure is an elegant example of how a single low - mass satellite accretion occurring in the current epoch can produce a very complex , rosette - like structure of debris dispersed in the halo of its host galaxy that may survive for several gigayears , a scenario predicted by n - body simulations of tidally disrupting stellar systems around the milky way ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the external view of the stream wrapping ngc 5907 also offers for the first time a direct observational evidence that the material stripped from disrupting satellite galaxies ( stream stars likely accompanied by dark matter ) may cross the inner regions of galactic disks .",
    "this process will likely induce gravitational effects ( e.g. , creation of spiral arms , star formation triggering , etc ) that are not yet fully understood , a phenomena that has been also suggested for the sgr stream in our galaxy @xcite but that lacks confirmation due to our inner perspective .",
    "in addition , the presence of tidal streams wrapping galaxies with warped disks ( see also martnez - delgado et al .",
    "2008 ) may suggest satellite galaxy perturbations as the origin of those features ( e.g. velzquez & white 1999 , weinberg & blitz 2006 ) .",
    "recent cosmologically - motivated simulations have shown that in a @xmath1cdm paradigm the accretion of several massive ( @xmath800.6@xmath81 ) sub - halos onto the central regions of the host galaxy should be common from @xmath82 to the present ( kazantzidis et al .",
    "such accretion events lead to strong warping , flaring and thickening of an initially cold disk as well as to the formation of long - lived , ring - like stellar features in the outskirts of the disk that may locate several kiloparsecs off the disk plane and have surface brightnesses in the range of 2530 mag arcsec@xmath3 ( see fig .",
    "6 of kazantzidis et al .",
    "2007 ) . given the similarities in shape and mass between ngc 5907 and the milky way , it is interesting to note that our deep images show none of the predicted features besides a classical warped disk . a statistically relevant sample of deep photometric images of nearby , edge - on spiral galaxies might reveal whether the absence of strongly perturbed old disks poses a problem for our theoretical understanding of how disk galaxies form in a @xmath1cdm context .",
    "our survey reveals that the presence of complex structures from ancient streams in the outskirts of spiral galaxies in the local volume ( @xmath83 15 mpc ) must be taken into account to correctly interpret the results of deep , pencil - beam photometric probes designed to constrain the formation and composition of galactic halos .",
    "this concern is justified in the case of ngc5907 , where several authors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have reported the presence of a peculiar , red , luminous , flattened stellar halo that may actually correspond to tidal debris that in projection appears located closely below the disk plane and that may have originated the faint residual light emission reported in these previous studies ( as also suggested by * ? ? ?",
    "what can we learn from the theoretical study of tidal streams in galaxies beyond the local group ?",
    "firstly it must be remarked that theoretical models are severely hampered by the impossibility of measuring the kinematics of individual stars at distances of several mpc with present instrumentation . in the case of ngc 5907 ,",
    "the large degeneracies in the orbital and structural parameters of the stream progenitor force us to consider our n - body model as illustrative only .",
    "however , the model is certainly helpful to interpret most of the observed features of the ngc 5907 tidal stream and proves that such a complex stream - like structure can be explained by the accretion of a _ single _ satellite galaxy .    despite the degeneracy introduced by the observational limitations ,",
    "an advantage of the panoramic perspective in external galaxies is that it simplifies the detection of stream pieces that were lost several gigayears ago , which strongly increases the number and strength of the constraints that can be derived from these systems .",
    "for example , ( i ) the variation of width and surface brightness along tidal streams constrains the number of dark matter sub - halos in the milky way @xcite .",
    "these authors show that the presence of dark matter sub - halos in spiral galaxies would result in a progressive heating of tidal streams as a result of close encounters . as @xcite point out",
    ", the averaged number of dark matter substructures ( and , thus , the likelihood of encounters ) in a milky way - like galaxy decreases monotonically since @xmath84 to the present , which clearly implies that `` old '' stream pieces are more likely to reveal perturbations than recently stripped ones .",
    "( ii ) constraints on the flattening of the host galaxy potential become significantly stronger as the number of stream wraps increase ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "( iii ) finally , detecting old stream pieces will allow us to study possible metallicity gradients within the progenitor galaxy , as it is for example in the case of the sgr tidal stream ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    the detection of an old , complex tidal stream in ngc5907 ( 14 mpc away ) with modest instruments suggests the viability of carrying out extragalactic surveys of substructures in the surroundings of spiral galaxies in the local volume .",
    "it is a relevant question to wonder how many stellar streams should we expect in the local volume .",
    "cosmological n - body simulations predict that the incidence of large satellite galaxy accretion occurring in the current epoch is commonly _",
    "one per spiral galaxy for its inner galactocentric regions _",
    ", @xmath83 50 kpc ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the presence of such a complex stream at 14 mpc from us , easily detectable with present observational capabilities , clearly suggests that deep photometric images may reveal a large number of substructures in the stellar halos of spiral galaxies .",
    "the different stellar streams detected in the milky way @xcite and in m31 @xcite by large photometric surveys supports this expectation .",
    "table  [ streamtable ] gives the confirmed stellar stream features discovered up to date .",
    "interestingly , the first outstanding characteristic of the tidal streams discovered in external galaxies to the present day is there are _ no _ detected tidal streams in the local group with surface brightnesses as high as seen in ngc5907 .",
    "presently , observational limitations impede the resolution of stars in external galaxies , which poses a detection threshold of around @xmath85 29 in unresolved light .",
    "in contrast , star counts can reach a detection level as low as @xmath1133 ( see e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this explains why we can not find the counter - parts of the stellar streams detected in the local group in external galaxies , but it is indeed puzzling that no tidal stream in the milky way or m31 is remotely as bright as the one detected here .",
    "in addition , table  [ streamtable ] also reveals that , with the single exception of the sgr dwarf , the progenitor systems of most of the stellar streams known to the present day remain _ undetected_. the most logical explanation is that the progenitor galaxies have been nearly destroyed by now .",
    "this scenario is supported by the n - body simulations of @xcite , who show that dwarf galaxies undergoing tidal mass stripping have to lose more than 9099% of their initial dark matter halo mass before a stellar tidal stream may start forming .",
    "once the host s tidal field begins to strip stellar material , the central surface brightness ( @xmath86 ) and the total luminosity ( @xmath87 ) of the dwarf galaxy suffers a sharp , monotonic decline so that @xmath88^{0.6}$ ] for @xmath89\\ll 1 $ ] .",
    "therefore , as a tidal stream forms the likelihood to detect its progenitor decreases until , eventually , the present surface brightness falls beyond the detection limits of our instruments . a second possibility that we explore in our illustrative model ( see fig .  [ nbodyfig ] ) is that the progenitor systems might be hidden behind the host disk or bulge .",
    "although this scenario may be applied to some of the systems listed in table  [ streamtable ] , it is fairly unlikely that it explains the absence of progenitor galaxies for all of them .",
    "the study of tidal streams in external galaxies is a relatively young field and provides direct way of addressing some opened questions on galactic formation and evolution .",
    "for example , studying stellar population gradients along tidal streams via deep _",
    "hubble space telescope _ photometry data ( see for example * ? ? ?",
    "* ) will render important constraints on the effect of tides on the stellar formation history of dwarf galaxies .",
    "the panoramic view of tidal streams in external galaxies also offers an excellent opportunity to demonstrate tidal stripping of globular clusters formed in satellite galaxies , which may correspond to an important fraction of the globular cluster population of the host , as earlier proposed by @xcite . searching for",
    "associated globular clusters and planetary nebula may also offer a means by which kinematics in distant streams could be derived ( i.e. from intrinsically bright absorption line sources or sources with emission lines ) , so that kinematical constraints might be placed on theoretical models that aim to reproduce tidal streams in external galaxies .",
    "these models , in turn , may provide reasonable estimates of the flattening of the dark matter halos that surround local volume galaxies . ultimately , the ideal scenario would require resolving stellar populations at a distance of 1020 mpc , which will be feasible in the next one or two decades with large ground - based telescopes like the _ thirty - meter - telescope _ , or spatial missions like the _ james webb space telescope_.",
