    "earthquakes are phenomena exhibiting great complexity and strong intermittency . statistical mechanical approaches",

    "although the source mechanism of earthquakes is still open , statistical properties of earthquakes are well described by some empirical laws , such as , the gutenberg - richter ( gr ) law  @xcite and the omori law for aftershocks  @xcite .",
    "the statistical properties of time intervals between successive earthquakes , hereinafter called the interoccurrence times , have been paid much attention and discussed  @xcite since bak _",

    "it is shown that the interoccurrence time distribution for the earthquakes occurring on a single fault can be described by the weibull distribution , and that the weibull exponent increases with the increase of the magnitude threshold  @xcite .",
    "very recently , in analyzing the japan earthquake data , we have proposed a statistical feature of interoccurrence times , which states that the probability distribution can be definitely written by the superposition of the weibull distribution and the log - weibull distribution  @xcite .",
    "we have reinforced this view that the interoccurrence time statistics show the weibull - log weibull transition , which means that weibull statistics and log - weibull statistics coexist in the interoccurrence time statistics , and the dominant distribution function then changes from the log - weibull distribution to the weibull distribution as the threshold of magnitude is increased .",
    "it was found that the crossover magnitude from the superposition domain to the weibull domain depends on the location on which we focused .",
    "these features are also observed by analyzing the southern california and taiwan earthquake data  @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , the weibull - log weibull transition also appeared in dynamical systems  @xcite .",
    "however , the theoretical background and interpretation of this transition remain to be developed .",
    "many earthquake models have been proposed and simulated to infer the source mechanism of earthquakes and to discuss whether the model reproduces the statistical properties of earthquakes .",
    "the burridge - knopoff ( bk ) model  @xcite is one of the theoretical models of earthquakes .",
    "recent works on this model have been studied by many authors  @xcite .",
    "_ showed that interoccurrence time distributions depended on the stiffness of the system by simulating the one - dimensional ( 1d ) bk model with the static - dynamic friction law  @xcite .",
    "they found that for a small stiffness the interoccurrence time distribution exhibits an exponential distribution , while for a large stiffness the interoccurrence time distribution restricted to system - wide events obeys the weibull distribution .",
    "the system - wide events were defined as the events where all blocks slip during an event . in the 2d bk model",
    ", the present author demonstrated that the cumulative distribution of the interoccurrence time can be described by the power law  @xcite , which reproduces the observed behavior  @xcite . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "a mechanical model which exhibits the weibull - log weibull transition has not been reported .    in this study , we attempt to understand how the weibull - log weibull transition and the crossover magnitude are influenced by a change in the major physical quantities , such as frictional properties and stiffness of a fault . in addition , it is worth discussing whether the bk model shows the weibull - log weibull transition .",
    "thus we study the interoccurrence time statistics produced by the 2d bk model by changing the friction and stiffness parameters and the threshold of magnitude . as a result ,",
