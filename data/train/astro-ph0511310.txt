    "before the launch of bepposax in 1996 , gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) were known only as explosive sources of gamma photons , without an identified counterpart in any other part of the spectrum .",
    "subsequently , progress included the explanation of both temporal and spectral variations of the afterglow .",
    "however , although thousands of grbs have now been discovered and observed , a large fraction remain unobserved at other wavelengths .",
    "the paucity of observations , poor positional accuracy and low photon fluxes have been important limiting factors .",
    "batse - observations of more than 1500 grbs revealed two classes according to duration @xcite .",
    "grb progenitor theory predicts that the class with the longest duration ( @xmath220to100s ) is due to the collapse of massive stars @xcite , @xcite , and are detectable up to very large redshifts . for this class , galamaetal.(1998 )",
    "@xcite provides strong evidence for a physical relation between grbs and supernovae , which can be further classed as faint , low energy supernovae or bright , energetic ones @xcite .",
    "the latter , so called hypernovae , are associated with the death of fast rotating , massive stars @xcite .",
    "consequently , since early generations of stars are expected to be very massive and fast rotators @xcite , @xcite , @xcite,[10 ] , @xcite , grbs are likely to have occurred in significant numbers at early epochs . therefore , they are being increasingly recognized as potentially powerful probes of the very high redshift universe @xcite .",
    "although several space missions have been launched to study grbs ( e.g. hete2 , integral and swift ) , extremely high redshift grbs are likely to remain undetected / unidentified because their afterglow signatures are outside the observational range of current space missions . only grbs up to redshifts of z@xmath26",
    "can be observed by their optical instruments .",
    "however , luminosities of typical bursts render them detectable even as far as z@xmath210to30 @xcite . for this reason ,",
    "we propose a space mission , * _ x - red _ * , dedicated specifically to finding early universe grbs",
    ". such bursts ( z@xmath210to30 ) will be redshifted into the x - ray region , with optical afterglows redshifted into the infrared region .",
    "this work is based on a preliminary mission study conducted by these authors at the esa summer school on the `` birth , life , and death of stars '' at alpbach , austria , in 2004 . *",
    "_ x - red _ * is designed as an esa project , to be launch between 2012  and  2020 , and is planned as a 3 year mission , with the possibility of extension up to 10 years .",
    "in the following , we examine the feasibility of detecting high redshift grbs in terms of both statistical number of detections and also adequate flux levels at x - ray and infrared wavelengths .",
    "the results dictate the demands on instrumentation described in section[instruments ] .",
    "observations described in the literature of the universe at redshifts ( z@xmath20to5 ) allowed us to use three important assumptions : grbs are produced by hypernovae , grbs have the same properties in the early universe as they do today ; and finally , flux extrapolation is possible to high redshifts .",
    "however , we are aware that there are several theories about the early universe ( z@xmath25to30 ) that predict even higher grb frequencies and fluxes .",
    "therefore , it should be noted that our assumptions constitute a worst case scenario .",
    "we can gauge the expected number of detectable grbs from the detection rate of swift @xcite combined with our chosen instrument field of view ( fov ) and sensitivity , section[wfc_fig ] .",
    "the detection rate of * _ x - red _ * is therefore estimated from fig .",
    "3 of hartmann et al .",
    "( 2004 ) @xcite , given the higher sensitivity of * _ x - red _ * compared to swift .",
    "the total number is expected to be on the order of 800 detections over the 3 year mission lifetime . of these detections , around 10% are expected to be from grbs at z@xmath35 ( i.e. at least 80 grbs at a distance beyond which grbs have not yet been observed ) while 2% ( i.e. @xmath215 detections ) are expected to be from grbs at z@xmath310 .    for high redshifted grbs ( z@xmath410 ) the peak energy output of 100kev to 600kev",
    "is shifted into the x - ray regime .",
    "the observed luminosities span a few orders of magnitude , but tend to higher values at higher redshifts @xcite . at z@xmath210 ,",
    "the expected luminosities are a few times 10@xmath5 - 10@xmath6erg@xmath7s@xmath8 .",
    "the expected photon number at a given energy in the grb spectrum by meegan ( 1998 ) @xcite was integrated over the appropriate energy range .",
    "additionally , due to the time dilatation , the grb is extended to z+1 , and so a burst that lasts for @xmath210s will be observable for @xmath2100s .",
    "this provides the time constraint within which the spacecraft must point its follow - up instruments .",
    "unfortunately , however , the time dilatation also causes a decrease in the flux rate of high redshifted grbs .",
    "figure [ fluxboys ] , left panel , takes that into account and shows the calculated flux distribution assuming a luminosity of 10@xmath6erg@xmath7s@xmath8 .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",width=283 ]   , title=\"fig:\",width=207 ]    although the number of photons increases at lower energy bins , so too does the diffuse x - ray background .",
    "therefore , the fov must be limited in order to detect the grb above the background .",
    "the x - ray afterglow is one to two orders of magnitude lower than the actual burst @xcite .",
    "therefore , a _ focussing _ x - ray telescope is needed to study x - ray afterglows , or even late x - ray bursts , taking place several minutes after the prompt emission @xcite .",
    "x - ray focusing telescopes work in an energy range of 0.1 - 12kev . therefore , a possible absorption due to photo - ionization , which is highest at low energies and drops with the third power of energy , is now investigated . in * _ x - red _ * s observation field , near the galactic poles , the hydrogen number density is n@xmath9  =  10@xmath10@xmath11 @xcite . according to wilmsetal.(2000 ) @xcite the absorption at 0.1 kev is 4% and decreases fast with energy .",
    "thus , absorption is negligible .    in the infrared wavelength range ,",
    "the dimming of the afterglow , redshifting , and time dilatation nearly cancel one another out @xcite .",
    "the extinction at high redshifts is likely to be small because of the rapid decrease in metallicity beyond z@xmath23 .",
    "figure[fluxboys ] , right panel , shows the time dependant decrease of afterglow flux .",
    "it can be extrapolated to a short time after the burst ( table[flux_k ] ) and specifies the demands on the infrared telescope .",
    "the main objective of * _ x - red _ * is to detect a reasonable number of high - redshifted grbs with a high positional accuracy . to achieve this objective",
    ", the satellite will be equipt with three types of instrument ( see layout in figure[xred_instruments ] , left panel ) .",
    "four wide field cameras ( wfcs ) operating at x - ray wavelengths will detect high redshift gamma - rays and obtain rough coordinates .",
    "the x - ray focussing telescope ( xft ) will perform imaging observations to improve coordinate accuracy , and will also extract x - ray spectra from which redshifts may be determined .",
    "the infrared telescope ( irt ) will extract near infrared spectra of the high redshift afterglow .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",width=226 ] , title=\"fig:\",width=188 ]      wfcs operating at x - ray wavelengths will detect high redshift gamma - rays and obtain rough coordinates .",
    "the only instruments currently available for observing a large fov in the x - ray region are coded mask detectors .",
    "each wfc consists of a coded mask placed 1.67 m above the detector plane by a rigid composite structure .",
    "the coded masks , e.g. @xcite of @xmath12 mm ( l@xmath13w@xmath13h ) lead pieces , were designed to cover the whole available surface of the service module .",
    "the dimensions of the satellite structure and the sun  shield put engineering constraints on the design and placement of the wfcs .",
    "for this reason , there are two pairs of masks ( see figure[xred_instruments ] , left panel ) .",
    "the two masks closer to the sun are symmetric , have a maximum size of @xmath14 m and have almost 160000 elements each ( with @xmath15% of them transparent to x - rays ) .",
    "the two masks on the further side from the sun , also symmetric , have a maximum size of @xmath16 m and over 161000 elements each .",
    "the two main problems posed by detectors covered by coded masks are the background photon noise level and the lack of collimation in photons reaching the detector itself .",
    "since * _ x - red _ * requires not only a large fov but high sensitivity ( see section[sect : flux ] ) , these difficulties must be overcome .",
    "to overcome the background photon noise , a combination of four wfcs is used , with each wfc surrounded by a shield .",
    "more importantly , it is now possible to avail of the depleted field effect transistor ( depfet ) detector technology , a new ccd technology with hybrid soft and hard x - ray detection and high speed individual pixel readout , currently in development for the xeus mission .",
    "this technology allows considerable improvement in background noise reduction , see below .",
    "( the lack of flux collimation is addressed by the xft design , section[xrt ] . )",
    "each wfc is equipped with two 70@xmath1370 cm detectors , covering an energy range between 0.1kev and 100kev .",
    "a 70@xmath1370 cm depleted field effect transistor ( depfet ) is placed in front of a 70@xmath1370 cm cadmium telluride ( cdte ) detector , such that hard and soft x - ray detection is possible ( see @xcite for a complete explanation of depfet and cdte detectors ) .",
    "the two detectors can be used to trace the photon s path . by knowing the detection position in both detectors , it is possible to eliminate background photons .",
    "hence , the background photon noise can be reduced even further .",
    "high redshifted grbs ( @xmath17 ) are fainter than medium redshifted grbs ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "coded mask instrument sensitivity increases with the size of the detectors . according to the expected fluxes",
    ", all detectors have been designed large enough to be able to detect a typical grb at @xmath19 within their energy range .",
    "the large detector dimensions and the number and size of the pixels ( see table[wfcdettable ] ) may be considered ambitious .",
    "however , it is expected that technological advances are likely to meet this demand by the planned launch date of * _ x - red_*.    overall , with this configuration , the total fov of the four wfcs ( which have coded masks of 50% transparency ) is 0.6steradians ( @xmath20 , figure[xred_instruments ] , right panel ) , and the positional accuracy is @xmath21arcmin ( fwhm@xmath26arcmin ) , as determined by the mask - to - detector distance , the size of the mask elements and the detector pixels .",
    "the second x - ray instrument on - board is the xft , which will perform imaging observations to improve coordinate accuracy , and will also extract x - ray spectra from which redshifts may be determined . with this instrument",
    ", we can overcome the second difficulty posed by the wfc coded mask ( mentioned in section[wfc_fig ] ) , i.e. the lack of collimation in photons reaching the detector .",
    "x - ray grazing incidence mirrors are able to focus x - rays but only under very small reflection angles and , with increasing photon energy , the angle becomes even smaller .",
    "this results in the typically large focal lengths of x - ray telescopes .",
    "meanwhile , the dimensions of the fairing ( section[engineering ] ) and moment of inertia considerations ( section[attitude ] ) impose a limit on the available focal length for the xft of 5.5 m , with corresponding radius 0.28 m ( scaling a xmm - newton type telescope ) .",
    "we must look to new technologies to ensure adequate sensitivity under these focal length and radius restrictions .",
    "silicon high - precision pore optics ( si - hpo , or simply ` pore optics ' ) is another challenging new technology currently in development for the xeus mission ( as is depfet , section[wfc_fig ] ) .",
    "although the constraint on maximum tolerable graze angle for pore optics is the same as for conventional mirrors , pore optics can be made to more efficiently fill the aperture of the telescope .",
    "this means it is possible to obtain a given effective mirror area with a telescope of smaller opening .",
    "this in turn translates to a shorter focal length .",
    "so the use of pore optics will not only have the effect of drastically decreasing the mass of the mirrors since it is very light - weight , but will increase the effective area substantially . with our chosen design , a pore optics telescope will have an effective area of 1400@xmath7@1.5kev , which is 12 times better than swift @xcite , @xcite .",
    "having collimated the photons , we then choose to implement a photon counting intrinsic energy resolution detector .",
    "as with the wfcs , we use depfet detector technology of @xmath21 with @xmath22 pixel .",
    "the detector will be read out every 1ms in window mode ( i.e. only partial detector read - out according to grb location , resulting in increased speed and hence allowing photon energy resolution ) .",
    "the observational data will yield _ both _ x - ray images and spectra . given a fov of 10arcmin",
    "a grb position accuracy of 1arcsec is feasible .",
    "further technical details are listed in table[tab : xptdata ] . from the x - ray spectrum",
    ", we can identify emission and/or absorption lines which allow determination of the redshift .",
    "the irt is intended to extract spectra of the high redshift optical afterglow .",
    "the demands on the irt are dictated by the nature of high redshifted afterglows of grbs .",
    "these events are limited in lifetime ( days to months ) and the flux is continuously decreasing rapidly , so it is crutial to obtain a spectrum as soon as possible .    in the majority of grb afterglows , lyman-@xmath23 is the most distinctive absorption line @xcite and is detectable even with low - resolution spectroscopy and in a noisy spectra .",
    "even though other emission and/or absorption lines are recognized in afterglows , we expect lyman-@xmath23 to be the most prominent line from the first generation of stars , due to their chemical composition . at a redshift of @xmath25to15 or even up to z@xmath220 , lyman-@xmath23 is shifted into the near infrared ( @xmath24@xmath20.73to1.95@xmath25 m , or even )",
    ". however , for clear determination of the redshift , detection of other features is also desirable .",
    "hence , the detector s wavelength range should exceed @xmath26 m .",
    "for an adequate signal - to - noise ratio , our choice of detector must operate at @xmath235k .",
    "the corresponding demand on thermal design puts strong constraints on the telescope , the detector and the whole spacecraft .",
    "active cooling systems have the disadvantage that they limit the lifetime of the mission significantly and increase the spacecraft s mass substantially .",
    "passive cooling to 35k is an engineering challenge but it is absolutely desired , and possible if the complete satellite architecture is designed according to this requirement ( section[thermal_design ] ) .",
    "considering the required spectral range and the feasibility of passive cooling , the near infrared spectrograph ( nirspec ) of the james webb space telescope can serve as a basis for the detector design @xcite .",
    "this operates in the wavelength range of 0.6to5.0@xmath25 m and offers a range of resolutions ( r=100 - 3000 ) .",
    "given that afterglow fluxes decrease rapidly over time , high resolution spectroscopy is not possible since the photon rates are low and space - based mirrors are too small .",
    "however , for determination of redshift , low resolution spectroscopy is sufficient .",
    "therefore , we propose a modified nirspec with a `` low '' resolution mode of r@xmath230 and a `` high '' resolution mode of r@xmath2100 . for a telescope diameter of 0.85 m",
    "the required minimum near infrared fluxes for a 10@xmath27 event corresponds to 8.6(or 28.5)mjy ( by scaling nirspec ) at a given resolution of r@xmath230 ( or r@xmath2100 ) .",
    "the spacecraft orbit was chosen as the lagrangian point , l2 , where gravitational pull and centripetal force between sun and earth are equal",
    ". this location will provide long term uninterrupted observations of grbs and their afterglows with the xft and irt , which would not be achieveable from an earth orbit .",
    "the location will also avoid eclipses , giving a stable thermal environment .",
    "thanks to the advanced light - weight instrument technology ( section[instruments ] ) and choice of light - weight passive cooling ( section[engineering ] ) , the mass loading is minimised and so we can choose the cheaper soyuz launcher , which imposes a lower mass constraint than the more expensive ariane 5 .",
    "this choice also , however , gives some limiting constraints to the total dimensions of the spacecraft .",
    "it will be equipt with the new st fairing ( offering larger dimensions for a bigger payload ) .",
    "the internal dimensions of this fairing are @xmath23.8 m in diameter and @xmath29.5 m in height , but forming a cone at the top which leaves an effective height h@xmath28@xmath26 m for the basic 3.6 m  diameter cylindrical shape . a fregat module , which provides the final injection to l2 , is included in the fairing .",
    "it is expected that the soyuz  fregat spacecraft will be launched from the european spaceport in korou .",
    "the soyuz will bring the spacecraft to an intermediate orbit around earth at which point the fregat module then performs the injection to the transfer orbit , including a fly - by maneuver with the moon , until it finally reaches l2 . upon arrival , the spacecraft will perform a halo  orbit about the instable l2 point , with a total amplitude of @xmath29 m .      in order to correct the flight trajectory to l2 , and to maintain stability about the instable l2 point , a propulsion system will be included in the spacecraft .",
    "additionally , this will serve to offload the momentum wheels ( section[attitude ] ) , which are included in the spacecraft for pointing manoeuvres . required trajectory corrections of 50ms@xmath8 and stability corrections of 2ms@xmath8yr@xmath8",
    "are expected .",
    "estimating an extended maximum lifetime of 10years for the mission , the sum of all corrections is @xmath270ms@xmath8 .    the thruster propellant chosen is hydrazine ( n@xmath30h@xmath31 ) , for its high specific impulse ( i@xmath32@xmath2230s ) compared to a liquid gas like nitrogen ( i@xmath32@xmath270s ) .",
    "electrical thrusters ( i@xmath32@xmath41000s ) do exist but they require a stable high voltage supply and a non - standard power processing unit , the mass of which increases with specific impulse .",
    "also , they offer best performance for long thrust periods , and so are not required for this mission .",
    "furthermore , structure and mass constraints preclude electrical thrusters .",
    "therefore , hydrazine thrusters are favoured , as their high specfic impulse means lower fuel mass rendering them more suitable for longer duration missions .",
    "in addition to the propellant mass , the specifications for the thrusters , pipes and valves have to be considered . for the expected requirements , a system of 16 thrusters each providing a force of 10n is deemed sufficient .",
    "the propellant will be stored in two tanks situated in the service module .",
    "the mass estimated for a total lifetime of 10years is @xmath270 kg , and is broken down as follows : propellant @xmath250 kg ; tanks ( 2@xmath136 kg ) @xmath212 kg ; thrusters ( 16@xmath130.3 kg ) @xmath24.8 kg ; pipes and valves @xmath23 kg .      since using thrusters for the attitude control would add extra propellant mass and exceed the mass limitations of the spacecraft , we choose instead a four momentum wheel system ( for redundancy purposes ) orientied in a tetrahedron to control the rotation of the spacecraft",
    "this attitude control system will include two star trackers , with a positional accuracy of 0.25arcsec ( fwhm@xmath21.0arcsec ) , pointing parallel to the xft ",
    "irt alignment .",
    "the spacecraft is of effective height h@xmath28@xmath26 m ( section[orbit ] ) and of mass m@xmath21500 kg ( section[mass_estimate ] ) . assuming a cylindrical geometry , the satellite s highest possible rotational moment of inertia , @xmath33 , ( i.e. about the x or y axis , see figure[fig : sc_geometry ] ) was estimated by @xmath34 where r is the spacecraft radius and h@xmath35 is the height of the center of mass of the cylinder ( h@xmath35=@xmath36h@xmath28-h@xmath37",
    ", see section[engineering ] ) .",
    "the first term represents a rotation around the center of the cylinder .",
    "the second term is a correction term , using steiner s law , to account for the distance offset between the center of the cylinder and its center of mass , since the center of mass is located between the service module ( sm ) and payload module ( pm ) ( figure[fig : sc_geometry ] , left panel ) .",
    "the resulting moment of inertia is @xmath33@xmath29100kgm@xmath38 .",
    "since the momentum wheels must slew the satellite to any point in the fov of the wfcs within 60 seconds , an angular speed of @xmath20.01rads@xmath8 must be achieved .",
    "therefore , the momentum wheels are required to store an angular momentum of 91nms .",
    "the spacecraft is divided into two parts : the service module ( sm ) and the payload module ( pm ) ( figure[fig : sc_geometry ] , left panel ) .",
    "the pm carries all the scientific instruments , the communication antenna , star trackers , sun shields and passive cooling radiators .",
    "the sm includes all the devices necessary for housekeeping , attitude control , propulsion system , etc .",
    "the solar panels are mounted on the side facing the sun ( chequered areas in figure [ fig : sc_geometry](a ) .",

    "this is done by radiators on the rear face .",
    "given that there is also an instrument in the sm , the xft , an additional radiator panel has to be provided to keep it at the specified temperature ( table  [ tab : thermal_pm ] ) .",
    "simulations confirmed that , within rotations of @xmath69 ( about the x and/or y axis ) , the radiated power always exceeds the sum of the absorbed and dissipated power ( figure  [ fig : sm_thermal_final ] ) .    in summary",
    ", it is shown that the proposed design is feasible in providing the required thermal specifications of all instruments and devices .",
    "the layout allows operation of the irt in the temperature range of 35 - 50 k. calculations reveal the engineering challenge to be insulation of the irt such that the heat transfer does not exceed 1w , in which case it will not be possible to allocate sufficient area for the radiators .",
    "the aim of this section is to estimate the amount of data produced by the various on - board instruments , and to examine the best way to communicate with the ground stations .",
    "the largest amount of data will undoubtedly come from the wfcs .",
    "this is mainly due to the diffuse x - ray background , the intensity of which is estimated as follows , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the number of photons in a given energy range ( @xmath11steradian@xmath8s@xmath8 ) is given by : @xmath70 @xmath71 integrating over the appropriate energy range ( 0.1 - 100  kev ) , and multiplying by the total detector area and fov of the four wfcs , gives a total number of 87000photonss@xmath8 ( assuming coded mask efficiency @xmath250% ) .",
    "the relevant data that needs to be stored for every photon consists of six characterising numbers : the ( x , y ) position on both detectors , the x - ray energy , and the time .",
    "since each of these will be stored on 10bits , it amounts to 60bits per photon .",
    "so we expect the data rate of the 4 wfcs to be @xmath25.3mbs@xmath8 , while the xft and irt require comparatively negligible rates ( i.e. @xmath250kbs@xmath8 ) .",
    "the total comes to @xmath25.5mbs@xmath8 .",
    "the large data rate leaves two alternative .",
    "the preferred scenario involves using a high - gain , steerable antenna ( hga ) in searching for grbs .",
    "in addition to the hga continuously transmitting wfcs data to earth , a medium - gain antenna ( mga ) ensures minimal data transmission for housekeeping and emergency situtations .",
    "also , the spacecraft must be capable of storing data onboard for a limited time .",
    "estimations show the need for a 1.2 m diameter hga and a ground antenna diameter of 30 m .",
    "however , various restrictions have to be considered .",
    "currently , available ground stations can not ensure complete ground coverage , and a steerable hga can constrain the observable region .",
    "however , the data rate is the main concern , even given data compression . for other space missions , data transmission rates of almost 3mbs@xmath8 are under development and will be achievable from l2 when satellite missions like gaia @xcite are launched .",
    "the alternative scenario uses a mga , which inevitably means onboard raw - data processing and storage .",
    "the reduced data are transmitted to ground during a limited time interval ( typically a few hours ) .",
    "the first scenario is much more attractive , mainly because of the higher flexibility and real - time ground - based data processing , but its feasibility depends on future developments mainly in antenna technology .",
    "one of the key points to note about this mission design is the light - weight technology and feasibility of passive cooling ( which does not increase mass through fluid considerations ) .",
    "this allows us to choose a smaller launcher ( section[orbit ] ) , which ultimately leads to a significant reduction in overall mission costs .",
    "the individual masses for the subsystems are roughly broken down as follows : wfc@xmath2160 kg ; xrt @xmath290 kg ; irt @xmath2150 kg ; attitude control system @xmath2114 kg ; power system & telemetry @xmath2130 kg ; structure @xmath2550 kg .",
    "this gives a total mass of the spacecraft within the mass limitations for a soyuz launcher , i.e. 1500 kg .",
    "observing the sky for grbs is the primary objective of the * _ x - red _ * mission .",
    "the mission design accounts for the fact that we can not observe in either the galactic or ecliptic planes , so as to avoid high x - ray background levels and possible x - ray flashes unrelated to grb events .    while the wfcs are monitoring the sky for grbs , the wfcs data ( with positional accuracy of 1 arcmin )",
    "are analyzed by the satellite s software and are continuously transmitted to earth in real time .",
    "the spacecraft then acts automatically on the coordinate information , to take further data with the other instruments .",
    "however , the satellite s grb detection software will have a high detecting threshold , to prevent triggering by false events .",
    "ground stations have the option to analyze the wfcs data , and may choose to override the satellite controls in order to study grbs that failed to reach the detection threshold . in this case , the total time loss would be 20s . whether by automatic instruction or manual override , the satellite will slew to point the xft and irt on the grb position in less than 60s . the xft and irt instruments will then observe the grb and its afterglow .",
    "the xft can improve the positional accuracy to within 1 arcsecond , and immediately transmit this information to earth where ground - based telescopes may choose to begin follow - up observations .",
    "note , however , that thermal and power issues place restrictions on spacecraft orientation and so , following observation of several grbs , the spacecraft must be reorientated to a position that ensures optimal thermal and power conditions .",
    "extremely high redshifted grbs provide unique probes of the first generation of stars and the early universe .",
    "we present * _ x - red _ * , a complete mission design from the science case to the payload and overall mission architecture , the objective of which is to observe these high redshift grbs for the first time .",
    "we have demonstrated the feasibility of detecting high redshift grbs in terms of both statistical number of detections and also adequate flux levels at x - ray and infrared wavelengths .",
    "the results dictated the demands on instrumentation .",
    "we then describe the payload which comprises three instruments , namely wide field x - ray cameras to detect high redshift gamma - rays , an x - ray focussing telescope to determine accurate coordinates and extract spectra , and an infrared spectrograph to observe the high redshift optical afterglow .",
    "we successfully demonstrate that our scientific objectives are achieveable when harnessing new technologies ( i.e. depfet and pore optics ) , and we successfully meet instrument accomodation and environmental demands through our mission architecture .",
    "one of the key points to note about our overall mission design is the light - weight technology and feasibility of passive cooling .",
    "this significant reduction in mass allows us to choose a smaller launcher , which ultimately leads to a significant reduction in overall mission costs _ without _ compromising scientific objectives .    in the planned 3 years mission",
    ", we expect to detect and identify 15 grbs of z@xmath410 .",
    "these will constitute the first observations of high redshift grbs , and are expected to provide valuable constraints on properties of the first generation of stars and on the history of the early universe .",
