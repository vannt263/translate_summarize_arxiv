    "in two long - duration balloon flights over the antarctic continent , the anita experiment has placed the most restictive limits to date on ultra - high energy neutrino flux @xcite , as well as observing a number of ultra - high energy cosmic ray events @xcite .",
    "the trigger systems for these flights are based on dividing incoming antenna signals into frequency bands . to search for broadband signals consistent with an impulsive event , power is measured in various bands , and a trigger is generated when power thresholds are exceeded in multiple bands for multiple adjacent sectors of antennas .",
    "while this trigger has proved sufficient for the first two flights , it does not benefit from the full interferometric potential of the anita instrument .",
    "the proposed upgrade to the trigger system utilizes realtime interferometric techniques to search for correlated signals between antennas which can point back to a source region of interest .",
    "a key component of this technique is the ability to digitize all incoming data so that such interferometry can be performed . in order to limit the power requirements of such a system",
    ", only low - resolution digitization is performed .",
    "this digitized data is then processed through digital logic to generate a system trigger , which results in high resolution digitization of the event .",
    "simulated efficiency curves , shown in figure [ fig : eff_curves ] , have been generated for this triggering technique , and indicate that 50% efficiency could be reached at an snr of 2.3 or below , compared to snrs @xmath2 obtained in the previous flights @xcite .",
    "-sectors ( sets of three antennas arranged vertically on the payload ) , and total power of the beamforming output is combined between sets of three adjacent @xmath3-sectors . ]",
    "we have fabricated an asic , designated the realtime independent three - bit converter , in ibm 0.13  @xmath0 m technology to evaluate the digitization aspect of this proposed trigger system .",
    "the basic ritc architecture is shown in block - diagram form in figure [ fig : ritc_block ] .",
    "it consists of three differential analog input channels , each coupled into an array of 32  sample - and - hold cells .",
    "when an input clock pulse is sent from an external controlling device , such as an fpga , this pulse traverses a delay line , and logic implemented at variaous stages of the delay line dictates the track and hold periods for each sampling cell .",
    "after the hold period is entered , internal logic begins the digitization process , which is conducted in parallel for four sample cells on all three channels simultaneously .",
    "the adc is based on a flash architecture , with seven user - adjustable thresholds that define the digitization levels .",
    "this allows flexibility to adjust for potential nonlinearities in the comparators , change the digitized levels in response to increased input noise levels , or utilize unequally spaced bit intervals , if desired .",
    "the digitization thresholds , as well as biases that set the effective sampling rate , are controlled by a set of internal dacs , which can be set by a serial programming interface .",
    "final digitized outputs are read out in parallel sets of 36 bits ( 3 bits from 4 samples of 3 channels ) .",
    "the outputs are implemented as differential lvds pairs , which must operate at 650  mb / s at the nominal sampling rate of 2.6  gsa / s .",
    "test and monitoring structures are also implemented . a stand - alone comparator is provided to allow characterization of linearity .",
    "analog outputs provide access to the interal dac settings for one of the three ritc channels .",
    "these allow evaluation of the dac performance , as well as override capability in the event of a dac or shift register failure .",
    "a reference clock output is derived from the input clock , combined with the internal sampling logic , to allow monitoring of the internal sampling rate .",
    "this type of monitoring also allows the user to implement feedback controls to compensate for temperature drifts . a simulated output of the ritc response to a sine wave input",
    "is shown in figure [ fig : ritc_sine_sim ] .",
    "ritc has been fabricated in through the mosis multi - project wafer service .",
    "a photograph of the bare die can be seen in figure [ fig : ritc_die ] . though the design is not particularly space intensive , the large demultiplexing required to read out the data results in a pin - limited design of total dimension 9.8  mm@xmath4 .",
    "we have designed a pcb incorporating the ritc to perform evaluation studies of asic performance ( see figure [ fig : ritc_eval ] ) .",
    "this board follows the fmc standard , and is intended for testing with the xilinx ml605 evaluation platform .",
    "this interface will ultimately allow testing of ritc digitization with beamforming implementations on either an fpga or a recently submitted digital asic .",
    "testing is underway now , and we expect shortly to have evaluation results of ritc performance , including analog bandwidth , comparator and dac linearity , timing performance , power consumption , and overall suitability for use in the beamforming trigger system .    3.13  mm@xmath4 . ]",
    "the ritc asic has been designed as a prototype of the analog functionality required for a realtime interferometric trigger for the anita-3 experiment . a separate , fully digital asic consisting of the beamforming trigger logic has also been submitted for fabrication . once available , we will report test results of the ritc and the outlook for the anita-3 trigger upgrade .",
    "although targeted for anita-3 , this type of trigger could enable significant improvements in noise - limited sensitivity for next - generation radio searches for high energy neutrinos and cosmic rays ."
