    "the dynamics of a classical inflaton field is commonly assumed to be governed by a local equation of motion of the form @xmath0 where the friction term @xmath1 represents the dissipative mechanism through which inflaton energy is converted into particles . in particular , in ` warm inflation ' scenarios @xcite , this term is taken to be large enough for a significant fraction of the energy to be dissipated during inflation .",
    "assuming that the classical inflaton @xmath2 is the expectation value of quantum scalar field @xmath3 , its equation of motion can be derived straightforwardly from a suitable quantum field theory , and it is _ not _ of the form ( [ localeom ] ) .",
    "for example , if @xmath2 couples to a scalar quantum field @xmath4 through an interaction @xmath5 , one obtains a term @xmath6 in the equation of motion , and the expectation value depends on @xmath2 through the effective mass of the @xmath4 particles , @xmath7 .",
    "the field @xmath4 here might be the quantum part of @xmath3 ( that is , @xmath8 , with @xmath9 ) or it might be an independent field . in any case",
    ", the expectation value @xmath10 is a highly _ nonlocal _ quantity : it depends in a complicated way on the entire history of @xmath2 , in contrast to the local equation ( [ localeom ] ) , where @xmath2 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are all evaluated at a single time @xmath13 .",
    "this situation is quite generic : a yukawa coupling @xmath14 to a spin-@xmath15 field @xmath16 produces a @xmath2-dependent mass for the @xmath16 particles and a term @xmath17 in the equation of motion , and in general the equation of motion contains a sum of terms of this sort , but no friction term .",
    "the question naturally arises , whether the true equation of motion might be adequately approximated , under suitable circumstances , by a local equation similar to ( [ localeom ] ) .",
    "an apparently rather plausible argument suggests that this is indeed possible when @xmath2 changes sufficiently slowly with time , and supplies an estimate of the friction coefficient @xmath18 . to evaluate @xmath19 at a _ fixed _",
    "time @xmath13 , one expresses @xmath20 at some earlier time @xmath21 as @xmath22 the evolution of @xmath23 is governed by a hamiltonian @xmath24 that depends explicitly on time through @xmath20 . inserting the expansion ( [ phiexpansion ] ) , we have @xmath25 where the first term , say @xmath26 is independent of @xmath21 .",
    "assuming that the state of the @xmath4 field is always close to thermal equilibrium , the time - dependent correction @xmath27 can be treated using the standard methods of linear response theory , which yields the approximation @xmath28\\rangle^{\\mathrm{eq}}\\ ] ] where the expectation values are taken in the equilibrium ensemble associated with @xmath29 .",
    "keeping just the first two terms in ( [ phiexpansion ] ) , we find that @xmath27 is proportional to @xmath30 , and in this way we recover an equation of the form ( [ localeom ] ) . using this or equivalent methods , estimates of the friction coefficient were found in the 1980s for a single self - interacting scalar field @xcite , and more recently ( mainly in the context of warm inflation ) for more complicated models @xcite .",
    "plausible though these calculations seem to be , they rely on an unproven assumption : namely , that the true non - equilibrium dynamics can legitimately be replaced by the linear response of a state of exact thermal equilibrium . it is therefore important to ask whether the same results can be recovered from the slow - evolution limit of the non - equilibrium dynamics .",
    "recently @xcite , we have addressed this question by exhibiting a sequence of approximations through which the exact non - equilibrium dynamics can be reduced to a set of _ local _ , coupled evolution equations for @xmath31 and quantities characterizing the state of the particles into which @xmath2 decays . to recover the local equation of motion ( [ localeom ] ) ,",
    "it is necessary that the solution of these evolution equations should have an adiabatic expansion in powers of derivatives of @xmath31 .",
    "somewhat surprisingly , we found , as reviewed in section [ eveqns ] below , that no such solution exists .",
    "formally , this means that the equation of motion for @xmath31 is intrinsically non - local , and does not have a time - derivative expansion .",
    "in particular , the friction coefficient @xmath18 does not exist .",
    "this formal result indicates that the local equation of motion is never strictly valid , but that does not necessarily mean that it can not serve as a reasonably accurate approximation .",
    "intuitively , one might still expect that ( at least under favourable circumstances ) dissipative effects , which certainly _ are _ a feature of the non - equilibrium evolution , should be fairly well represented by the friction term calculated in linear response theory .",
    "it is this issue that we attempt to address here by numerical methods .",
    "more specifically , one can envisage a further approximation to the non - equilibrium evolution equations in which self - energies are replaced with the values they would have in a state of thermal equilibrium .",
    "then ( see section [ eveqns ] below ) the solution of the resulting equations _ does _ have a time - derivative expansion , and one recovers essentially the friction coefficient obtained from linear response theory . in what follows , we try to assess ( within a particular model ) whether the local equation of motion obtained in this way provides a good approximation to the non - equilibrium dynamics .",
    "section [ eveqns ] describes the non - equilibrium evolution equations and the adiabatic approximation to these equations that we solve numerically . in section [ results ] , we present solutions for the evolution from two different initial states : one is a state in which the adiabatic approximation predicts underdamped motion ( section [ ud ] ) , while in the other it predicts overdamped motion ( section [ od ] ) . in both cases , we find that , although although the non - equilibrium dynamics does yield damping , this damping is not well described by the adiabatic approximation .",
    "a brief account of the numerical methods used to obtain these results is given in section [ numeric ] .",
    "finally , section [ discuss ] is a self - contained summary , during the course of which consider what might account for the failure of the adiabatic approximation in the situation we have studied .",
    "as in @xcite we work with a minkowski - space theory . extending our analysis to a robertson - walker spacetime presents no difficulties of principle , but it introduces complications which seem to have no bearing on the issue we address .",
    "consider , then , a quantum field theory defined by the lagrangian density @xmath32 it should be emphasized at once that we will not attempt to study the exact non - equilibrium dynamics of this model . in fact , we will arbitrarily discard various terms in its equations of motion which , though they may well affect the dynamics significantly , are irrelevant to the question on which we wish to focus .",
    "the first such approximation is to replace the quantum field @xmath33 with its expectation value @xmath31 , where we assume a spatially homogeneous state .",
    "then the equation of motion for @xmath31 is @xmath34 while the dynamics of the remaining quantum field @xmath35 is governed by the lagrangian @xmath36 with @xmath37 .",

    "the approximations that lead to these equations are described in detail in @xcite .",
    "essentially , they arise as a solution to the dyson - schwinger equations for 2-point functions , via a local _ ansatz _ for self - energies , which are evaluated at 2-loop order in perturbation theory . for a free - field theory , with @xmath50 , which also means @xmath51 , the evolution equations are exact ( see , for example @xcite ) and the functions @xmath41 and @xmath42 can be identified in terms of creation and annihilation operators for @xmath4 particles : @xmath52 with interactions included , ( [ dndt ] ) can be interpreted as a boltzmann equation for number densities @xmath41 ; the quantity @xmath53\\label{sdef}\\ ] ] is the standard scattering integral associated with two - body elastic scattering , while the source @xmath54 represents particle creation and absorption due to the time - dependent mass @xmath55 .",
    "although the evolution equations ( [ dndt ] ) and ( [ dnudt ] ) are local , their solution is not .",
    "one can attempt to obtain a solution in the form of a time - derivative expansion , by writing @xmath56 expanding in powers of @xmath48 and finally setting @xmath49 .",
    "however , it turns out that no such solution exists , for the following reason . to find the leading correction @xmath57",
    ", one has to solve the integral equation @xmath58 where @xmath59 .",
    "it is straightforward to show that conservation of energy in two - body scattering implies the sum rule @xmath60 .",
    "the right - hand side of ( [ deltaneqn ] ) does not respect this sum rule , so the equation is not self - consistent and the desired solution does not exist .",
    "( for elastic scattering , there is a second sum rule associated with particle - number conservation , which is also not respected by ( [ deltaneqn ] ) ; however , corrections to the boltzmann equation ( [ dndt ] ) from higher orders of perturbation theory would introduce inelastic scattering terms , destroying this second sum rule . )    to the extent that our approximations afford an adequate description of non - equilibrium evolution ( an important caveat , upon which we comment further in section [ discuss ] ) this shows that the equation of motion ( [ phieom ] ) does not have a time - derivative expansion and can not be represented by a local equation such as ( [ localeom ] ) .",
    "however , we can recover a time - derivative expansion by making a further approximation .",
    "the functions @xmath44 and @xmath45 are related to quasiparticle self - energies @xmath61 ( whose exact meanings are given in @xcite ) by @xmath62\\label{alphapresc}\\\\ \\gamma_k(t)&=&-\\frac{i}{4\\omega_k(t)}\\left[\\sigma^{+}_{k}(t ) -\\sigma^{-}_{k}(t)\\right].\\label{gammapresc}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] let us replace these self - energies with constant equilibrium values . in what follows",
    ", we will call this the _ adiabatic approximation_. using this approximation , the time - derivative expansion can be carried through without difficulty .",
    "in particular , @xmath44 and @xmath45 no longer depend on @xmath63 , and the troublesome equation ( [ deltaneqn ] ) does not arise . since @xmath64 is proportional to @xmath30 , so are @xmath63 and @xmath65 , and these contributions to @xmath10 give rise to a friction coefficient @xmath66.\\label{etaeq}\\ ] ] here , @xmath67 stands for the equilibrium bose - einstein distribution @xmath68 , while @xmath69 is found by substituting this equilibrium distribution in ( [ gammadef ] ) .",
    "this expression agrees , for example , with the result given in @xcite in the limit @xmath70 considered by these authors . roughly speaking",
    ", the second term represents a loss of inflaton energy arising from particle creation , while the first represents a transfer of energy to particles already present .",
    "this agreement is not surprising : the adiabatic approximation we have just introduced is roughly equivalent to the assumptions on which linear response theory is based .",
    "intuitively , it would seem that this should be a fair approximation if @xmath31 does not change too rapidly , and if the state of the @xmath4 particles does not stray too far from an equilibrium distribution .",
    "we now attempt to test this intuition by comparing numerically the non - equilibrium evolution resulting from ( [ dndt ] ) and ( [ dnudt ] ) with that implied by the adiabatic approximation .    to simplify matters a little , we observe that the frictional effect we want to study arises from the last two terms in the expression ( [ chisq ] ) for @xmath10 , and will discard the first term .",

    ", we observe that the evolution equations ( [ phieom2 ] ) , ( [ dndt ] ) and ( [ dnudt ] ) conserve exactly the energy given by @xmath78 we will determine the evolving temperature in the adiabatic approximation by requiring this energy to remain constant .    to avoid confusion , it may be worthwhile to reiterate that our goal is to test whether the expectation value ( [ chisqtr ] ) is adequately represented by the adiabatic expression ( [ chisqadiab ] ) .",
    "we will do this by comparing solutions to the non - equilibrium evolution equations ( [ phieom2 ] ) , ( [ chisqtr ] ) , ( [ dndt ] ) and ( [ dnudt ] ) with the adiabatic approximation _ to these equations _ , which consists of the equation of motion @xmath79 with @xmath18 and @xmath80 given by ( [ etaeq ] ) and ( [ deltavpr ] ) respectively , and @xmath77 determined by energy conservation .",
    "the fact that we have arbitrarily discarded several terms does not affect this comparison , though of course it does mean that we are not in a good position to study the true dynamics of the original model ( [ model ] ) .",
    "equally , our approximations are based in part on perturbation theory but the neglected higher - order terms do not affect the comparison , and we will not be concerned with choosing parameter values so as to make these terms small .",
    "we have obtained numerical solutions of the evolution equations presented in the previous section , taking the simplest available potential , namely @xmath81 this section presents two sets of solutions . in the first , the motion of @xmath2 is an underdamped oscillation ; in the second , the motion is predicted _ by the adiabatic approximation _ to be overdamped . in each case , we solve , on the one hand the non - equilibrium equation of motion ( [ phieom2 ] ) together with ( [ dndt ] ) and ( [ dnudt ] ) , and on the other hand the adiabatic approximation to this equation ( [ eomadiab ] ) , starting from identical initial conditions . at the end of the section",
    ", we comment briefly on the numerical methods used .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows the motion of @xmath2 obtained in the two approximations , starting from a more or less arbitrary initial state . throughout ,",
    "the units are fixed by taking the mass of @xmath4 particles to be @xmath82 . here , we chose the parameter values @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "the initial state for @xmath2 was @xmath86 , @xmath87 and the initial state of the @xmath4 particles was a state of thermal equilibrium with inverse temperature @xmath88 . with these values ,",
    "the energy of the particles is about 86% of the total energy , so one might expect a significant transfer of further energy to these particles as well as a frictional effect from particle creation .",
    "the two superimposed oscillations in figure [ fig1 ] are not easily distinguished , so we have plotted envelopes for the two curves : the solid envelope indicates the solution to the non - equilibrium evolution equations , while the dashed one corresponds to the adiabatic approximation . at first sight",
    ", there seems to be a similar rate of damping in each case , but there are significant differences .",
    "the friction coefficient of the adiabatic approximation given in ( [ etaeq ] ) is a rather complicated function of @xmath2 , but suppose that it can be written as @xmath89 , where @xmath90 varies relatively slowly with @xmath2 .",
    "this suggests that large - amplitude oscillations should be strongly damped , while at small amplitudes damping would be ineffective .",
    "this behaviour is clearly apparent from figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "however , the solution of the full evolution equations shows a different tendency : damping is smaller at large amplitudes than that predicted by the adiabatic approximation , and it does not disappear at small amplitudes .",
    "thus , in this situation , although the non - equilibrium evolution equations do yield a damped motion , the damping is not well represented by the friction term as estimated from the adiabatic approximation .",
    "this is not necessarily unexpected , since both approximations yield fairly rapid oscillations , and the adiabatic approximation might not be expected to work well .",
    "we therefore turn to a different initial state which , according to the adiabatic approximation , ought to result in overdamped motion and slow evolution .",
    "suppose , as above , that the adiabatic friction coefficient can be represented as @xmath91 and also that the adiabatic correction to the effective potential ( [ deltavpr ] ) is @xmath2 times a slowly varying function .",
    "then the adiabatic equation of motion ( [ eomadiab ] ) becomes @xmath92 where @xmath93 and @xmath94 are , at least over some period of time , approximately constant .",
    "if @xmath95 can be neglected , then this equation has the overdamped solution @xmath96^{1/2},\\label{odsolution}\\ ] ] with a `` terminal velocity '' @xmath97 under these circumstances , we have @xmath98 , so overdamped motion should occur if @xmath99 , or @xmath100 intuitively , the adiabatic approximation ought to be good if , in addition to this condition for neglecting @xmath95 , the state of the @xmath4 particles thermalizes rapidly . according to the boltzmann - like equation ( [ dndt ] ) , the mode @xmath67 of the particle distribution relaxes towards equilibrium with a characteristic relaxation time @xmath101 . taking the @xmath102 mode as representative , one can guess at a rough criterion for efficient thermalization , namely that the fractional change in the effective particle mass @xmath103 over a time @xmath104 should be small .",
    "that is , @xmath105 or @xmath106 ideally , we would like to study a state in which both conditions ( [ odcondition ] ) and ( [ thermalization ] ) are well satisfied , but this proves to be quite difficult .",
    "in particular , the second condition seems hard to achieve . using ( [ vterm ] ) , it can be rewritten as @xmath107 and the thermal effects that make @xmath93 and @xmath69 large also tend to produce large values of @xmath108 .",
    "the dependence of @xmath18 ( equation ( [ etaeq ] ) ) on the parameters at our disposal is so complicated as to make a systematic survey of the parameter space impractical . by trial and error ,",
    "we have chosen a set of values which yield @xmath109 this means that _ according to the adiabatic approximation _",
    ", the system is strongly overdamped , but thermalization is only moderately efficient .",
    "a careful , but by no means exhaustive , exploration suggests that this situation can not be much improved within the model studied here .",
    "the parameter values leading to this state are @xmath110 , @xmath111 , @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",
    "the terminal velocity ( [ vterm ] ) turns out to be @xmath114 .    taking these initial conditions",
    ", we find for @xmath31 the motion depicted in figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "motion of @xmath31 as calculated from the non - equilibrium evolution equations and via the adiabatic approximation .",
    "as determined from the adiabatic approximation , the initial conditions should lead to overdamped motion . ]    evidently , the motion obtained from the adiabatic approximation ( the thinner curve ) is indeed overdamped at early times .",
    "in fact the solution agrees well with ( [ odsolution ] ) for times up to about @xmath115 .",
    "but as @xmath2 becomes smaller , the condition ( [ odcondition ] ) for overdamping no longer holds and , as in figure [ fig1 ] , the motion at small amplitudes is essentially undamped .",
    "the solution of the non - equilibrium evolution equations ( the thicker curve in figure [ fig2 ] ) is strikingly different : although there is significant damping , the motion is far from being overdamped .",
    "we observe , though , that the average rate of energy loss is quite similar , as indicated in figure [ fig3 ] , where we plot the energy that exists in the form of particles ( the last term in ( [ energy ] ) ) as a fraction of the conserved total energy . in fact",
    ", this figure shows that the overall conversion of inflaton energy into particles is somewhat more efficient in the non - equilibrium evolution than is suggested by the adiabatic approximation .",
    "energy of particles as a fraction of the conserved total energy . ]    of course , the question arises , what accounts for the large qualitative difference between the non - equilibrium evolution and that obtained from the adiabatic approximation ?",
    "a simple answer is that , as shown in section [ eveqns ] , no adiabatic expansion of the non - equilibrium evolution equations actually exists , and our numerical results merely confirm that the adiabatic approximation is wrong .",
    "this may perhaps be the appropriate answer , but it needs some further discussion , because we also showed in section [ eveqns ] that the adiabatic expansion _ does _",
    "exist if we take the extra step of replacing self - energies with their equilibrium values , and one might think that this step is relatively innocuous if the state is not too far from equilibrium .",
    "consider first the initial state , which was chosen to be a state of exact thermal equilibrium . according to the adiabatic approximation ,",
    "the criterion for neglecting @xmath95 is very well satisfied ( equation ( [ initcriteria ] ) ) , and the motion should be strongly overdamped .",
    "however , we see from figure [ fig2 ] that @xmath116 as calculated from the non - equilibrium evolution equations is very large .",
    "the reason for this is not hard to discover . in a state of exact thermal equilibrium ,",
    "the term @xmath117 in the equation of motion ( [ phieom2 ] ) is precisely the quantity @xmath80 that appears in the adiabatic equation ( [ eomadiab ] ) .",
    "thus , while the original equation of motion asserts that @xmath118 is equal to @xmath119 , the adiabatic approximation asserts that @xmath120 , the value of @xmath95 being very small . clearly , _",
    "the adiabatic approximation gives a wrong answer for a state of exact thermal equilibrium_. in fact , the informal arguments given in @xcite and reviewed in @xcite show that the frictional effects arise precisely from small departures from equilibrium .",
    "weighted particle distribution @xmath121 at time @xmath122 ( solid curve ) and the same quantity calculated from the equilibrium distribution for the same total particle energy ( broken curve ) . ]",
    "figure [ fig4 ] illustrates the departure from thermal equilibrium at times near @xmath123 , corresponding to the first negative peak in figure [ fig2 ] , where about one half - cycle of oscillation has been completed .",
    "the quantity plotted is @xmath121 , whose integral gives the total energy in particles .",
    "the solid curve uses the distribution @xmath41 generated by the non - equilibrium evolution , while the broken curve uses the equilibrium distribution @xmath124 with the temperature @xmath125 adjusted to give the same total energy .",
    "( this is quite independent of the equilibrium distribution @xmath126 generated by the adiabatic evolution . ) clearly , these two distributions are different , but the difference does not greatly affect the time evolution .",
    "for example , we show in figure [ fig5 ] the    the quasiparticle width @xmath69 calculated from the particle distributions of figure [ fig4 ] . ]",
    "quasiparticle width @xmath69 , which appears in the evolution equations ( [ dndt ] ) and ( [ dnudt ] ) , calculated from @xmath41 and @xmath127 , and the difference is seen to be marginal .",
    "we can use the effective value of @xmath77 calculated as above , together with the non - equilibrium values of @xmath67 and @xmath69 in the expressions ( [ etaeq ] ) and ( [ deltavpr ] ) to find an effective , non - equilibrium value for the ratio @xmath128 which , according to ( [ odcondition ] ) , gives a criterion for overdamping at times near @xmath129 .",
    "the result is that @xmath130 . thus , the criterion for overdamping ( as obtained from the adiabatic approximation ) is well satisfied by the non - equilibrium state at @xmath123 , just as it was by the initial equilibrium state .",
    "the main point of the preceding discussion is this . in order to obtain the adiabatic approximation",
    ", we had to replace non - equilibrium self - energies @xmath131 $ ] with the values @xmath132 $ ] associated with a state of thermal equilibrium . in the initial state at @xmath133",
    "these two self energies are identical , and in the state illustrated in figure [ fig5 ] the difference is quite small . clearly ,",
    "this difference does not account for the drastic failure of the adiabatic approximation in the situation we have examined .",
    "the difference between the two evolutions in figure [ fig2 ] ( and , for that matter , those shown in figure [ fig1 ] ) indicates that the expectation value @xmath134 is not well represented as the sum of the two terms in ( [ chisqadiab ] ) , regardless of whether the coefficients @xmath80 and @xmath18 are calculated using the non - equilibrium state or an effective equilibrium state .",
    "thus , although the rate of thermalization may well be an important factor , its importance does not lie in the relatively small effect that inefficient thermalization would have on the values of these coefficients .",
    "having made this point , we defer further discussion to section [ discuss ] , but we observe here that thermalization in the situation we have studied is rather less efficient than one might infer from the value @xmath135 for the ratio in ( [ thermalization ] ) . in the initial state , the relaxation time @xmath136 has values @xmath137 for all the modes used in the calculation , and this is longer than the whole time for which the evolution was studied . from the point of view of the adiabatic approximation ,",
    "this means that although thermalization might have been expected to be moderately efficient by comparison with the initially slow evolution , it is much less efficient by comparison with the more rapid evolution at later times . in the non - equilibrium evolution , there are quite large departures from equilibrium when @xmath2 changes rapidly .",
    "for example , we show in figure [ fig6 ] the particle distribution ( again weighted by @xmath138 ) at the time @xmath139 where @xmath2 first becomes very small .    weighted particle distribution at @xmath140 , compared with the equilibrium distribution for the same energy .",
    "]    this figure illustrates the fact that the particles created by the source ( [ jdef ] ) have a non - thermal spectrum weighted towards high energies : it falls off roughly as @xmath141 compared with the exponential fall - off of the thermal distribution .",
    "it is on account of this difference that the integral equation ( [ deltaneqn ] ) fails to respect the energy sum rule , and thus to be self - consistent . comparing figures [ fig4 ] and [ fig6 ]",
    ", it appears that , although the created particles are not thermalized instantaneously , a significant amount of thermalization has taken place during the quarter - cycle between @xmath140 and @xmath122 .",
    "this appearance is somewhat illusory , however , as we explain in section [ discuss ] .",
    "the calculations reported above were performed using modest computing resources ( a pc ) , and a moderate numerical accuracy seems to be adequate for the issues we seek to address .",
    "the most demanding aspect of the calculations is the solution of the evolution equations ( [ dndt ] ) and ( [ dnudt ] ) . to deal with these , we computed the evolution of @xmath142 modes ( that is , @xmath142 values of the momentum @xmath143 ) for the distribution functions @xmath67 and @xmath144 , with an upper cutoff @xmath145 . of the various integrals that are needed ,",
    "the energy integral ( [ energy ] ) attaches the largest weight to high - momentum modes and the chosen cutoff is large enough to make this integral reasonably accurate , as illustrated by the integrands in figures [ fig4 ] and [ fig6 ] .",
    "since the calculations are quite lengthy ( the data needed to produce figure [ fig2 ] were obtained from 3 weeks continuous running ) we did not attempt to make the entire process converge by increasing @xmath146 and @xmath142 systematically .",
    "however , the results presented here , using @xmath147 , which adequately resolves the structure of the distributions generated , differ negligibly from those obtained using @xmath148 , and seem to be insensitive to the cutoff @xmath146 .",
    "it is apparent from ( [ dnudt ] ) that the functions @xmath42 oscillate with frequencies roughly equal to @xmath149 .",
    "the basic time stepper used was a semi - implicit method , which is stable for these oscillations , with a fixed time step @xmath150 about one - tenth of the period of the fastest oscillation .",
    "however , computation of the scattering integrals ( [ alphadef ] ) and ( [ gammadef ] ) is very time - consuming ( even after analytical reduction to triple integrals ) , so @xmath151 and @xmath69 , which change quite slowly relative to the fast oscillations , were updated at longer time intervals @xmath152 , using a predictor - corrector method that typically converged after two or three iterations .",
    "this larger time interval @xmath152 was assigned values between @xmath153 and @xmath154 , according to the rate of change of @xmath69 ( see figure [ fig7 ] ) .",

    "the quality of the data obtained by these methods is illustrated in figure [ fig7 ] , which shows the variation over a typical cycle of @xmath2 and the @xmath102 modes of @xmath69 and @xmath67 .",
    "the sharp peaks in @xmath69 appear in all modes , and are largely due to the factor @xmath157 in ( [ gammapresc ] ) .",
    "the basic operations of evaluating integrals , and so on , were carried out with a tolerance of @xmath158 or better .",
    "the energy ( [ energy ] ) , which formally is exactly conserved , exhibits small variations , but is constant to within about @xmath159 , which we estimate as the overall accuracy of the calculation .",
    "according to quantum field theory , the equation of motion for the expectation value of a scalar field is a complicated , non - local integro - differential equation . in applications to inflationary cosmology , it is typically assumed that this equation of motion can be replaced by a local equation similar to ( [ localeom ] ) .",
    "if it is further assumed that the state of the quantum system is fairly close to thermal equilibrium , then it seems plausible that one should be able to apply the methods of linear response theory , which yield quantitative estimates of the friction coefficient @xmath18 and the effective potential @xmath160 .",
    "here and in @xcite we have tried to address the question whether the local equation of motion obtained in this way adequately approximates the actual non - equilibrium evolution , at least when this evolution is sufficiently slow .",
    "the indications are that it does not , but the treatment we have given can not be considered as definitive , and we wish to set out clearly the issues that are involved .",
    "the first issue is that we have treated the non - equilibrium evolution on the basis of an _ approximate _ set of local equations ( [ phieom ] ) , ( [ chisq ] ) , ( [ dndt ] ) and ( [ dnudt ] ) . as described in detail in @xcite , they arise from a local _ ansatz _ for quasiparticle self - energies , and it is not easy to assess how good an approximation this is . for the purposes of estimating the non - equilibrium behaviour numerically ,",
    "other approximation schemes have recently become available ( see , for example , @xcite ) which are in some respects superior to this one .",
    "however for the purpose of deriving a local effective equation of motion , approximations more or less equivalent to ours would seem to be inevitable . to be precise , the question we address here is whether the fully local equation of motion ( [ eomadiab ] ) as derived from linear response theory yields a good approximation to the non - equilibrium behaviour as described by our evolution equations . if it does not ( as we seem to find ) , then it is also unlikely to provide a good approximation to the true non - equilibrium dynamics .",
    "the phrase `` fully local '' above means the following .",
    "the evolution equations ( [ phieom ] ) , ( [ dndt ] ) and ( [ dnudt ] ) are local , in the sense that they involve @xmath31 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 together with their time derivatives , all evaluated at the same time @xmath13 : they describe a markovian process . in principle",
    ", one can envisage solving ( [ dndt ] ) and ( [ dnudt ] ) for @xmath41 and @xmath42 as functionals of @xmath31 .",
    "these solutions are non - local : they depend on the entire history of @xmath31 .",
    "so , substituting these solutions into the remaining equation ( [ phieom ] ) , we have a non - local equation of motion for @xmath2 .",
    "this non - local equation might be approximated by the `` fully local '' equation ( [ eomadiab ] ) if the quantity @xmath6 has a time - derivative expansion whose first two terms are @xmath80 and @xmath1 . although we can not find the complete functionals @xmath41 , and @xmath42 , we can attempt to find their time - derivative expansions . as explained in section [ eveqns ] , these expansions do not exist .",
    "however , if we make the further approximation of calculating self - energies from an equilibrium particle distribution rather than the non - equilibrium distribution , we _ can _ obtain a time derivative expansion , which essentially reproduces the results of linear response theory .",
    "this is what we have referred to as the adiabatic approximation . in section [ results ] ,",
    "we compared numerically the non - equilibrium evolution with that resulting from the adiabatic approximation , and found very large differences .",
    "we also saw that , for the model studied here , thermalization is not very fast compared with the motion of @xmath2 .",
    "intuitively , it seems that this poor thermalization might account for the failure of the adiabatic approximation .",
    "the second issue we want to discuss is , therefore , that of thermalization . as indicated in section [ od ] ,",
    "the relaxation time @xmath101 is roughly equal to @xmath161 in the initial state from which figure [ fig2 ] was generated .",
    "on the basis of the adiabatic approximation , which indicates strong overdamping , one would perhaps expect the non - equilibrium evolution to exhibit a period of overdamped motion , albeit with significant corrections due to a modest thermalization rate .",
    "what we actually found was oscillatory motion with a period much shorter than @xmath162 . over one quarter - period of this motion ,",
    "the particle distribution changes from that shown in figure [ fig4 ] to that shown in figure [ fig6 ] . from these figures , it would seem that significant thermalization has taken place over a period of time much shorter than @xmath162",
    ". however , figure [ fig7 ] suggests a different explanation . from that figure",
    ", we see that particles with a non - thermal distribution are radiated over a short period of time as @xmath163 decreases towards 0 , and that these particles , rather than being thermalized , are quickly reabsorbed as @xmath163 subsequently increases .",
    "so thermalization is indeed slow on the time scale of the non - equilibrium motion .",
    "we can not altogether rule out the possibility that it is this slow thermalization that accounts for the failure of the adiabatic approximation in the situation we have studied .",
    "however , we do not think that this is the correct explanation .",
    "one reason is that , as we have just remarked , consideration of the adiabatic approximation alone would suggest that thermalization , while modest , is not so slow as to produce the gross discrepancy apparent in figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "a more compelling reason is that , as discussed in section [ od ] , the non - equilibrium motion is not well represented by the adiabatic equation ( [ eomadiab ] ) even at those times when the state is close to thermal equilibrium .",
    "this strongly indicates that the step of replacing , say , @xmath164 $ ] with @xmath165 $ ] is wrong in principle and not just because of the quantitative discrepancy which , as seen in figure [ fig5 ] , may be quite small . in more detail , suppose that the distributions @xmath41 and @xmath42 are indeed close to thermal equilibrium",
    ". then it should be a good approximation to linearize the evolution equations ( [ dndt ] ) and ( [ dnudt ] ) , using @xmath166 and @xmath167 .",
    "in particular , the linearized version of ( [ dndt ] ) is @xmath168 .",
    "\\label{linearbe}\\ ] ] unlike ( [ deltaneqn ] ) , this equation is self - consistent ; the energy sum rule merely gives an expression for the rate of change of the quantity @xmath169 .",
    "( this equation is not self - contained , however . to solve it , we would need a prescription , such as the conservation of energy , for determining the time - dependent temperature that specifies @xmath170 . as a matter of fact ,",
    "the scattering integral @xmath171 vanishes when @xmath127 has an arbitrary chemical potential . in the adiabatic calculations of section [ results ] ,",
    "we did not allow for the possibility of a non - zero chemical potential because there is no conserved particle number that could be used to determine its value . )",
    "the important point here is that the linearized equation ( [ linearbe ] ) is a _",
    "differential equation_. its solution is again a non - local functional of @xmath2 , which will not reproduce the adiabatic equation ( [ eomadiab ] ) , regardless of how small @xmath57 might be . to do that , we need",
    "not just a linear approximation , but a time - derivative expansion which , as we have emphasized , is not self - consistent .    in summary",
    ", our numerical study indicates that that the non - equilibrium evolution of @xmath2 is not well described by a local equation of motion with the friction term estimated by linear response theory .",
    "it is possible that an adiabatic approximation would work better for a model in which thermalization is more efficient , and we plan to explore this in future work .",
    "however , for the reasons just discussed , we do not think that poor thermalization is the principal cause of the large discrepancies we observed ."
