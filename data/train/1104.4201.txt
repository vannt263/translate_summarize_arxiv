    "much has been written about the process by which double - stranded dna becomes two separated single strands , see , for example , @xcite .",
    "several authors refer to the melting of dna as having the form of a phase transition , in which the opening of one or a few base - pairs is akin to nucleation , and the subsequent growth of open ` bubbles ' is similar to the growth of crystal nucleii .",
    "this two - stage process is relatively well understood in the contexts of crystal growth , and aerosol formation , but less so in kinetics of dna replication .",
    "the aim of this paper is to show that the nucleation event  that is the initial opening of bases  exhibits self - similar , or scale - free , critical behaviour , as one would expect at a phase transition .",
    "whilst other studies have analysed bubble growth and the statistics of bubble length , we choose to focus on the temporal statistics .",
    "our model is more detailed , only focusing on 12 base - pairs and the opening of the first base ; our model is thus significantly smaller than the bubble growth models of @xcite ; however , our models are more accurate in that the amber simulations @xcite ( assisted model building with energy refinement ) include the effect of every atom in the dna and the water molecules in the environment , and our sde models include an accurate fitting of the nonlinear inter - base potential energy as described in our earlier work @xcite .    according to watson @xmath2 crick @xcite ,",
    "the structure of a dna duplex consists of two chains of bases .",
    "these bases are of four types : the purines adenine ( a ) and guanine ( g ) and the pyrimidines cytosine ( c ) and thymine ( t ) . along the chains ,",
    "the bases are linked by covalent bonds , while the opposite bases from the two chains pair together by two or three hydrogen bonds forming base - pairs .",
    "only a - t or c - g pairs are possible .",
    "given this information , we use a lattice representation for our dna sequence , as illustrated in figure [ ladder - fig ] .",
    "the localised separation of complementary bases  takes place on the microsecond timescale in normal dna , which is beyond the range of all - atom molecular dynamics ( md ) packages .",
    "the insertion of a defect , that is , replacing a thymine ( t ) with a difluorotoluene ( f ) base at the lattice site @xmath3 , increases the frequency of breathing due to the weakening of the inter - chain potential .",
    "this makes breathing occur on the nanosecond timescale and hence it becomes accessible to md simulation techniques .",
    "biologically the reason for considering the inclusion of a defect is to study fidelity , and the effects of errors , in dna replication .",
    "the defect f has been considered previously , for example , by cubero _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , who considered such a system without any externally imposed twist .",
    "it is possible that proteins may locally alter the twist of a dna helix in order to ease the process of localised melting .",
    "hence , here , we impose a twist on the dna structure in order to investigate its effect on base - pair breathing .",

    "we consider a range of helicoidal twist angles from 30@xmath21 to 40@xmath21 per base - pair at rest , including the typical twist of 36@xmath21 . in @xcite",
    "we derived a coarse - grained model based on stochastic differential equations with one variable for the displacement of each base from its equilibrium position .",
    "this model includes explicit random forcing terms , which model the interactions of water molecules with the bases , and the whole model has been parameterised to the all - atom md simulations derived using amber .",
    "developed from the models of @xcite , the incorporation of noise and damping terms enables us to investigate the temporal dynamics of breathing .",
    "the model is fitted to amber data using a sophisticated maximum likelihood estimation procedure which is described in @xcite and summarised in section [ sde - sec ] here .",
    "the associated fluctuation - dissipation relation , the dependence of parameters on angle of twist and form of the inter - base potential are also discussed in @xcite .",
    "the dna sequence under study consists of 12 base - pairs and we have taken that the dna sequence is surrounded by a water box .",
    "the analysis of the simulations of a dna molecule obtained using amber and our sde system presented in @xcite revealed that the amplitude of fluctuations is slightly reduced in the sde model , but the breathing length and frequency are similar .",
    "in addition , the derivation of the sde model requires us to modify the fluctuation - dissipation relation in the reduced , or coarse - grained , mesoscopic models .",
    "we also make a distinction between the potential of mean force ( the free energy ) and the various potential energies in our system .",
    "this is supported by an analysis of the importance of the damping term in preserving the system energy ( which , in combination with the forcing noise terms gives rise to the entropic component of the free energy ) and the way in which the along - chain interactions influence the length of a breathing event .",
    "we have also shown in @xcite that breathing events are due not only to inhomogeneities in the inter - strand interactions , but also to a significant change in along - chain interactions and the helical twist of the dna , which potentially influences the interactions between the dna molecule and the surrounding solvent .",
    "a more detailed analysis of our simulations presented below reveals an interesting result : rather than a well - defined breathing frequency that depends on the twist angle _ via _ the energy barrier between open and closed states of the central basepair , we find that at all angles of twist the dna exhibits breathing across a wide range of frequencies and the amplitude - frequency relationship exhibits scale - free behaviour .",
    "most previous results in the literature show that the energy is transferred between nonlinear localized modes with particular frequencies and between such modes and phonons , as discussed by peyrard _",

    "@xcite or as shown by the results of gaeta _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , for example .",
    "in the rest of this section we review some of the relevant theory and applications involving self - organised systems . in section [ model - sec ]",
    "we outline the models we use and the simulation techniques .",
    "section [ res - sec ] contains the results of both approaches , showing the consistency of outcomes .",
    "section [ conc - sec ] concludes the paper with a summary and discussion .",
    "many dynamical systems evolve to a steady state ( or an equilibrium ) solution or to a limit cycle .",
    "more complicated large - time behaviour includes spatio - temporal chaos which is often characterised by strange attractors in phase space @xcite . through the study of cellular automata ,",
    "wolfram @xcite characterised large time behaviour into four classes .",
    "he empirically identified the following qualitative classes : spatially homogeneous systems ( akin to steady - states ) , periodic structures ( limit cycles ) , systems with chaotic aperiodic behaviour ( chaos ) and , most notably , a fourth , that of complicated localised and possibly propagating structures .",
    "we claim that this last category is the most appropriate classification for the behaviour which we observe later in this paper , and , more precisely , this behaviour corresponds to self - organised criticality ( soc ) .    in physics ,",
    "a critical point specifies the conditions , such as temperature , pressure or composition , at which a phase boundary is not valid anymore . here , by ` phase ' we understand a state of a system for which the physical properties of a component are uniform .",
    "as one approaches the critical point , the properties of the different phases approach each other .",
    "in other words , a critical point refers to a system configuration to which the system evolves without ever approaching a fixed equilibrium state .",
    "mathematically , one can define characteristic sizes of behaviour ( lengths or timescales of events ) which describe the system .",
    "when these sizes become infinite the system is classed as critical , that is , fluctuations occur at all length scales .",
    "systems having the soc property present a spatially or temporally scale - invariant behaviour without the need to tune any parameter to a specific value .",
    "this ubiquity of scale - free behaviour @xcite in such models shows that complex behaviour can be stable .",
    "this contrasts with systems where one would generically expect some stable steady behaviour for a wide range of parameter values , and as a parameter changes , one might observe either a smooth change in the system s behaviour or a bifurcation to a qualitatively different steady - state or limit cycle , for example . in the special case when the parameter takes on the threshold value between two states , more complex phenomena may be observed .",
    "this is a typical form of behaviour around a phase transition . in general , the total number of states is finite and the transitions can be characterised using a cellular automaton structure @xcite .",
    "when analysing a large system , we aim to reduce its complexity to a few degrees of freedom , for which the coupling can be defined in a general manner and hence we obtain some averaged , or coarse - grained , behaviour over ignored quantities and includes corresponding averaged interactions within the system and the surrounding environment .",
    "for dynamical systems , such a dimensional reduction can be achieved by the `` slaving principle '' @xcite which leads to the the study of low - dimensional attractors .",
    "this is often a straightforward method . for example",
    ", `` fast modes '' at equilibrium can be slaved to a few slowly - evolving modes .",
    "however , sometimes a system responds on both fast and slow timescales , even at large times , and we require an alternative theory , such as the idea of self - organised systems , whose behaviour can not be explained using the slaving principle or other reductions .",
    "some attracting critical points of dynamical systems can be characterised using the concept of self - organized criticality ( soc ) , which was first introduced by bak _",
    "et al . _",
    "using simple automata , they demonstrated power - law relationships and @xmath1 noise ( also known as `` flicker noise '' ) in spatially extended systems , this behaviour illustrates critical phenomena , and underpins more general scale - invariant behaviour and fractals .",
    "they studied the dynamics of damped pendula and the slope of sandpiles , determining critical points of the systems .",
    "one aspect of self - organised criticality is the separation of timescales : in the most familiar application of sandpiles , grains are continually added on a faster timescale .",
    "the gradient of the pile slowly steepens and there are avalanches ( large - scale reorganisation of the pile ) which take place rapidly but are separated by large time intervals ( relative to the timescale at which grains are added to the pile ) .",
    "et al _ also noted that changing the values of system parameters did not affect the emergence of critical behaviour .",
    "avalanches in a one - dimensional sandpile are also analysed by chapman _",
    "_  ( see , for example , @xcite ) who showed that the distribution of energy discharges due to internal reorganizations have a power - law form and so demonstrate that the system is self - organized .",
    "in general , for a noisy system the power spectrum has the form @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is a constant .",
    "the noise present in the system can be classified in three important categories as follows :    * white noise , for @xmath24 ; * pink noise , for @xmath25 ; * red noise ( also known as brownian noise ) , for @xmath26 .",
    "however , the term `` @xmath1 noise '' is widely used to refer to any noise with a power spectral density @xmath27 , with @xmath28 . for @xmath1 noise that occurs in nature",
    ", @xmath29 is usually close to 1 .",
    "although there is no single well - defined class of systems having the soc property , it is typically observed in complex systems with slowly - driven nonequilibrium behaviour , for which the causes of an event taking place in a system can not be explained simply through some parameter values .",
    "several studies of soc show that scale - invariant phenomena can be determined at critical points , but not necessarily at any critical point .",
    "there are two important categories of such phenomena : fractals @xcite and power laws @xcite .",
    "whilst the first category involves geometric shapes , which can be split into parts that are reduced - size copies of the initial shape , the second deals with frequency - dependent quantities and , hence , is relevant in the analysis of some hamiltonian systems .",
    "we note that self - organised systems are always at criticality , but not all critical systems are self - organised .",
    "the range of systems exhibiting critical properties varies from earthquakes @xcite and forest - fires @xcite to biological systems , such as proteins @xcite , the brain @xcite and even dna .",
    "selvam @xcite , for example , studies the distribution of bases in a human dna sequence and shows that the c - g base - pair frequency distribution exhibits a universal inverse power - law form .",
    "also , harris _ et al . _",
    "@xcite analyse the configurational entropy of a dna molecule based on the entropy estimation for a gaussian configuration given by schlitter @xcite , which helps investigate whether a steady state has been reached during a simulation .",
    "they show that the estimate of the entropy @xmath30 depends on the number of data points @xmath31 and this relation is a power law ( with exponent between zero and minus one ) .",
    "in our system , we also have a separation of timescales : there are rapidly oscillating forcing terms applied to the dna chain illustrated in figure [ ladder - fig ] ( these model the interactions with water molecules and are akin to grains being added to the sandpile ) and the occasional larger - scale restructuring of the chain as the base - pairs open or close at the start and end of breathing events ( which are akin to avalanches in sandpiles ) .",
    "we now discuss in detail the modelling approaches we adopt .      as already mentioned , we obtain data from an all atom simulation of dna using the package amber @xcite . the dna sequence analysed contains 12 base - pairs as follows :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ c  t  t  t  t  g  f  a  t  c  t  t   + g  a  a  a  a  c  a  t  a  g  a  a _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    this sequence is analysed at a constant temperature of @xmath32 , in the presence of a surrounding water box .",
    "the solvent has to be taken into account because it influences the displacement of atoms and through other bonds , affects the hydrogen bonds linking the bases on the dna strands @xcite .",
    "even if the breathing events occur on the nanosecond time - scale and the dna sequence contains only 12 base - pairs , which together with the sugars and phosphate groups represent 763 atoms , the number of degrees of freedom in our system is actually very large ( 16682 ) due to the water box .",
    "this means most of the time is spent computing information about the solvent , even though this information is not used for our analysis , since we focus only on the dna bases and their dynamics .",
    "note that amber considers that the normal twist by default is about 32.5@xmath21 .",
    "in order to avoid this inconvenience , we have constructed the dna sequence by considering the degree of twist at rest .",
    "the degree of twist is preserved by imposing a harmonic restraint on the atoms at the end bases .",
    "more precisely , we have considered a constant energy ( of 1 kcal mol@xmath33 @xmath34 ) and hence a constant force acting on the end bases , in order to keep the dna atoms close to their initial positions . applying this restraint to the end bases",
    "allows the a - f pair to breathe and so explore a larger volume of phase space than the other base - pairs .",
    "the force field used during the amber simulations is also important . for a dna molecule , the predefined ff99sb all - atom force field",
    "moreover , amber provides several water models for residues with name wat  the default is tip3p , which was used in our simulations . after creating the topology and coordinates files using the amber packages _ leap _ and _ nucgen _ ,",
    "we have used _ sander _ for energy minimization .",
    "this process involves a structural relaxation , which is necessary because the coordinates file contains some initial values that do not guarantee a minimum energy configuration , this reduces the possibility of having conflicts or overlapping atoms .",
    "in addition to energy minimization , we have also performed a few equilibration and md simulations in which temperature changes .",
    "finally , our system is simulated using _",
    "sander_. next , _ ptraj _ is used to measure the distance between the a - f base - pair as well as the separations of the other base - pairs and the corresponding velocities .",
    "this data is output every 1 ps or 2 fs depending on which simulation study is being performed .      in dna ,",
    "the rapid external fluctuation events correspond to random collisions of the bases with the water molecules surrounding the biopolymer .",
    "these events correspond to perturbations to the variables @xmath35 , fluctuations in these displacements may propagate along the chain , perturbing neighbouring bases , eventually causing the central base @xmath36 to cross a barrier in the potential @xmath37 , see figure [ e0_fig ] .    , the total potential energy @xmath38 , and the potential of mean force @xmath39 used in ( [ syswnm_3 ] ) , for a 36@xmath40 twisted dna sequence . ]    a second source of data is the reduced model introduced in @xcite which is based on a system of stochastic ordinary differential equations ( sdes ) .",
    "we start from the deterministic system @xmath41 { \\nonumber}\\\\ & & + e_0(y_0 ) - { \\mbox{$\\frac{1}{2}$}}\\gamma ( u_0-v_0)^2 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is illustrated in figure [ ladder - fig ] . here , @xmath42 represent the deviations from equilibrium of the bases on one chain of the dna , and @xmath43 the displacements of the bases on the second chain , with the index @xmath31 determining the position down each chain ( @xmath44 ) . since we are interested in investigating in more detail a system similar to that of guckian _ et al . _",
    "@xcite we place a defect at the centre of the chain , that is , the @xmath45 and @xmath46 bases correspond to the a - f base - pair .",
    "the parameter @xmath6 describes the stiffness of the backbone down each side of the double - helix structure , whist the parameter @xmath4 indicates the strength of interaction between a base on one strand and its complement .",
    "these forces are assumed to be uniform along the dna double helix , except at the defect where they are replaced by the parameter @xmath8 and the nonlinear force @xmath47 respectively .",
    "to these we add noise and damping terms with coefficients @xmath48 and @xmath49 respectively .",
    "the dependence of all these parameters on the twist angle @xmath50 has been determined in an earlier paper @xcite .",
    "we make the transformation @xmath51 so as to obtain equations of motion for the distances between base - pairs @xmath52 the functions @xmath53 are white noise forcing terms .",
    "the quantities @xmath4 , @xmath6 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 are all fitted using a maximum likelihood estimation procedure , as is the interaction potential @xmath37 , a full description of this is given in @xcite .",
    "a typical example of the multiwelled interaction potential , @xmath37 is given in figure [ e0_fig ] .",
    "note that the total potential energy of the central defective base - pair is @xmath59 , and the potential of mean force ( free energy ) is given by @xmath60 , can easily be obtained from simulations by plotting a histogram of binned displacement data .",
    "we measure the distance between the two bases ( a , f ) at the defect over many nanoseconds , that is , we sample @xmath36 at specific intervals . using data from both amber and the sde system we analyse the ( discrete ) fourier transforms of @xmath36 for a range of twist angles from 30@xmath21 to 40@xmath21 per base - pair .",
    "the discrete fourier transform is taken of the data , in the figures displayed later , we use the notation @xmath61 for @xmath62 , and the hypothesis we are testing is that over a wide range of @xmath63 , @xmath64 the highest frequency attainable is @xmath65 , whilst the lowest frequency is given by @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the length of the simulation and @xmath68 is the sampling interval .",
    "our initial results are simulations of length approximately @xmath69 ns sampled every @xmath70 ps ( giving @xmath71 data points ) .",
    "we then perform simulations of @xmath72 ns sampled on a much finer scale of @xmath73 fs ( giving @xmath74 data points ) .",
    "these are performed using both amber and our sde system .",
    "the sde system is then subjected to a longer - time simulation of @xmath75 ns , sampled every @xmath76 ps ( @xmath77 data points ) .",
    "this enables a wide range of frequencies to be sampled : for the initial simulations @xmath78 ps@xmath33 ( @xmath79 ) , for the more frequently sampled simulations @xmath80 ( @xmath81 ) , and for the long simulations @xmath82 ( @xmath83 ) .",
    "other frequencies which might be of relevance in interpreting the results are the upper and lower limits of the phonon band ( which we refer to as @xmath84 and @xmath85 respectively ) , and the frequency of the defect mode . assuming that the defect mode can be approximated by @xmath86 we find @xmath87 and @xmath88 , hence @xmath89 . since @xmath90 and @xmath91 , we have @xmath92 and @xmath93 , implying @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "these all lie well above the range of frequencies that we shall be interested in below .       plotted against @xmath63 on a log - log scale .",
    "data sampled every 1 ps for 10 ns from a simulation of a 38@xmath40 twisted dna sequence from ( a ) amber , and ( b ) the sde system ( [ syswnm_1])([syswnm_4 ] ) . , width=340,height=453 ]    in figure [ ft_fig ] , we present the log - log plot of the discrete fourier transform ( dft ) against the frequency @xmath63 , for @xmath96 data points , that is , @xmath36 sampled every 1 ps for 8 ns , for a 38@xmath40 overtwisted dna sequence .",
    "this figure shows a straight line fit over several orders of magnitude of @xmath63 ( @xmath97 ) , with gradients of 0.70.9 which are close to @xmath0 .",
    "similar results are obtained for a 34@xmath40 twisted dna sequence , for example , as can be seen in figure [ ft_fig_34 ] .",
    "these results suggests that there are breathing events of , and separated by , arbitrarily large times .",
    "thus , if a dna strand was successively observed for increasingly long intervals of time , there would always be breathing events of duration comparable to the total observation time .",
    "the gradients of the @xmath98dft(@xmath63 ) against @xmath99 lines for the full range of twist angles tested are summarised in table  [ betac_val ] and suggest the presence of generalised @xmath1 noise in our data ( that is , @xmath100 with @xmath28 ) .     plotted against @xmath63 on a log - log scale .",
    "data sampled every 1 ps for 10 ns from a simulation of a 34@xmath40 twisted dna sequence from ( a ) amber , and ( b ) the sde system ( [ syswnm_1])([syswnm_4 ] ) . , width=340,height=453 ]    .the gradient @xmath29 of the log - log representation of @xmath101 against @xmath63 , from @xmath102 ns of data , sampled every 1 ps obtained from the amber and sde models . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the analysis of @xmath36 showed that the exponent @xmath29 increased from @xmath103 to @xmath104 when the sampling frequency was decreased from 1ps to 2 fs , suggesting convergence to @xmath25 in the limit of small sampling frequency .",
    "hence , we attempt to find more accurate values for the @xmath29-exponent for the neighbouring bases by decreasing the sampling timestep from 1 ps to 2 fs ( as we reduce the simulation length from 10ns to 2ns ) .",
    "we obtain the gradients given in table [ beta_val_nbr ] .",
    "summarising , we find values just under one half at the nearest neighbour ( @xmath105 ) in both sde and amber . for @xmath106 , in amber , there is then a further slow decay of @xmath107 per base - pair ; whereas in sde there is a more significant drop to 0.2 for @xmath106 and then a slow decrease of @xmath107 per base - pair .",
    "we observe once again that these later results with a decreased sampling timestep of @xmath108 fs increases the measured values of @xmath29 .",
    "hence , we recommend that the even with spatially coarse - grained models of dna , kinetic characteristics should be analysed using as small a timestep as possible , even as small as 2 fs ( as used in amber ) in order to obtain correct results and conclusions .",
    "this extra decrease in the sde system may be due to the reduced number of degrees of freedom ( only one per base - pair in the sde ) , whereas in amber there are @xmath109 degrees of freedom per base - pair ( the bases having 15 atoms moving in 3d space , in addition to the phosphate backbone ) . whilst all base - pairs receive energy in the form of white noise forcing ( in the sde system ) and in the form of random collisions with water molecules ( amber ) , this energy is used and dissipated differently in the defective base from its neighbours . at the defect",
    ", there is a change in temporal behaviour , since white input noise ( @xmath110 ) is converted to pink output ( @xmath111 ) giving @xmath112 , whereas in the neighbouring bases , the output noise ( @xmath113 ) remains significantly closer to white , that is @xmath29 is significantly smaller .",
    "in summary , we have simulated a sequence of 12 base - pairs of dna using two different models for a variety of times up to 100ns .",
    "we have analysed the displacement between the defective base - pair near the centre of the chain .",
    "fourier transforms of the distance trajectory taken from both the amber and the mesoscopic stochastic differential equation simulations exhibit scale - free , or critical , behaviour for all twist angles in the range 30@xmath21 - 40@xmath21 per base - pair . from ( [ loglin ] )",
    ", we have @xmath114 across a considerable range of frequencies , @xmath63 .",
    "furthermore , we find that @xmath25 for all twist angles .",
    "although we have imposed white noise forcing in the system ( [ syswnm_1])([syswnm_4 ] ) , the noise observed in the output @xmath36 is pink ( @xmath115 , figure [ ft_fig ] ) .",
    "this shows that our sde system preserves the soc properties of dna observed in the fully deterministic all - atom amber simulations .",
    "it is suspected that proteins which interact with dna overtwisting or undertwisting the structure in order to ease the release of bases out from the structure .",
    "the fact that @xmath25 for all twist angles appears to suggest that such a strategy will not change the base - pair breathing .",
    "however , the constant @xmath116 in the formula @xmath117 will depend on twist angle , and mean that the fraction of time spent in the breathing state is less for the more stable angles @xmath118 and more for the overtwisted or undertwisted dna structures ( _ i.e _  those in the ranges @xmath119 and @xmath120 respectively ) .",
    "what is surprising about our results is that the critical behaviour is not specific to any one twist angle but occurs at all angles .",
    "one might expect that , at normal twist angles of 35@xmath2136@xmath21 , stable behaviour would be observed , with breathing events having some short characteristic timescale ; at smaller and larger twist angles , a critical point would be found , where the dna exhibited scale - invariant breathing , and that at even more extreme twist angles , the open state would be stable .",
    "however , this is not the case at all , instead , we find @xmath1 behaviour at all twist angles . since the emergence of this critical behaviour is not affected by the variation of the twist angle of the system parameters values , or by the careful tuning of other parameters , we describe this as self - organised criticality .    the scale - free nature of the kinetics of breathing events at all twist angles described herein is strongly reminiscent of the behaviour of fluctuations in systems at criticality .",
    "thus , it appears that _ without any tuning _ of the interaction parameters of the dna strand , it is at a critical point where open bubbles spontaneously nucleate , hence we apply the term ` self - organized criticality ' .",
    "figures  [ ft_fig ] and [ logfft_fct38_long ] suggest that there is an upper frequency ( around @xmath121 ) , above which the amplitude of base - pair separation modes is small but ceases to decay any further , due to the effect of noise in the system .",
    "this cutoff is not due to the start of the phonon band ( which occupies the range @xmath122 ) , and which corresponds to a relatively narrow range of velocities around @xmath123 ( precise values depend on the twist angle ) .",
    "we observe some artifacts of the phonon band in the region of @xmath124 being between two and three and the defect mode near @xmath125 , in that there is a shoulder in the power spectrum in figure [ ft_fig34 ] where the trace is slightly larger than expected ; however , no behaviour should be expected to persist over _ all _ scales , and the figures show good agreement with scale - free kinetic behaviour ( straight - line ) over the considerably large range of @xmath126 .",
    "one might think that the defect site is the cause of the soc breathing behaviour .",
    "however , replacing the thymine ( t ) base with a difluorotoluene ( f ) base lowers the barrier between the closed and open states .",
    "the replacement does not affect the dna structure or other behaviour , as discussed in several papers , for example , @xcite .",
    "lowering the energy barrier allows breathing to occur at lower energies , and so occur with a higher frequency , on a timescale accessible to md simulations ( on the nanosecond timescale as opposed to the microsecond scale for a normal dna sequence ) .",
    "there is no reason to suppose that a change in the frequency of events should cause a more significant change in qualitative behaviour .",
    "hence , we speculate that in pure dna , with no defect , but with multiwelled potentials between all corresponding base - pairs , curves such as that seen in figure [ ft_fig ] , will be repeated but that the crossover frequency ( from @xmath63-independent noise to breathing with amplitude proportional to @xmath127 ) will be shifted to much lower frequencies , namely the microsecond scale , which is beyond current md simulations . here",
    "we only have a double - well potential at the defect , the other inter - base interactions are all governed by harmonic potentials , in reality , all inter - base interactions are double - welled , this will allow an open base - pair to be the nucleus for a bubble of several consecutive open base - pairs to form , as the along - chain interactions would then ease the opening of neighbouring base - pairs .              d.a .",
