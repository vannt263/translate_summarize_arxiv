    "the evolution of pre - main - sequence ( pms ) stars  young contracting stars on their way to the main sequence  is poorly understood although significant progress have been made in recent years ( see * ? ? ?",

    "* for reviews ) .",
    "observationally , these stars are also among the hardest to study because they are usually heavily extincted by their parental molecular cloud and are often seen in projection against bright hii regions",
    ".    the ideal laboratory of pre - main - sequence stellar evolution would then be the youngest possible galactic cluster free from dust extinction and nebula contamination , at a distance that permits detection of low - mass members to at least the hydrogen burning limit .",
    "an investigation of such an ideal cluster would provide robust observables to test pre - main - sequence models ( luminosity functions , color - magnitude , and color - color diagrams ) , free from completeness corrections and scatter due to variable extinction and nebula emission . in turn",
    ", the age of this very young cluster would be well constrained , as would be its star formation history , and its underlying initial mass function ( imf ) .",
    "the age of this cluster would also set an upper limit on the timescale for the disruption of the molecular material that originated the cluster .",
    "finally , observations from x - rays down to the mid - infrared wavelengths would also be able to provide a transparent characterization of an entire pre - main - sequence population down to brown dwarf masses , while shedding new light on the x - ray / uv / h@xmath9/infrared - excess phenomena observed in young stars ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for reviews ) .",
    "in this letter we present a ubvri survey of the stellar cluster ngc 2362 , probably the best proxy to the ideal cluster described above .",
    "the cluster is virtually free from dust extinction and shows no signs of nebular emission .",
    "walter baade suggested more than fifty years ago that ngc 2362 appeared to be almost exclusively made up of b stars with little evidence for low mass stars @xcite . this same population of b stars has been used as the standard observational template to define the upper end of the zero age main sequence . despite the claims for an abnormal mass function , a deep @xmath10band study of the central @xmath11 region of the cluster @xcite uncovered a substantial population of lower mass stars whose mass function appeared to be similar to that of the field @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite presented sensitive jhk observations of ngc 2362 that confirm this finding .",
    "more interesting perhaps , they found virtually no stars with detectable near  infrared excess emission , suggesting that this young cluster largely consists of diskless , post - t tauri stars . in a survey of young clusters at l band ( 3.4 @xmath12 m )",
    ", @xcite confirmed this result and further found ngc 2362 to be the youngest known cluster without a significant population of disk bearing stars .",
    "consequently , ngc 2362 plays a pivotal role in the determination of the overall lifetime of circumstellar disks in clusters and for setting the timescale allowed for planet building within such disks .",
    "unfortunately , the age of this cluster is not well constrained .",
    "the best existing age estimate essentially rests on the position in the hr diagram of a single object , @xmath13cma , the cluster s only post - main sequence star @xcite . an improved age determination for the cluster is urgently needed .",
    "our new deep ubvri survey of ngc 2362 reveals a long , narrow , and well defined pre - main - sequence , spanning about 9 magnitudes , in the @xmath8 band , from a - stars down to about @xmath14m@xmath4 , close to the hydrogen burning limit .",
    "this enables us to provide an improved and independent determination of the cluster s age .",
    "comparison with modern calculations of pms evolution yields an age of @xmath0 5@xmath1 myr which closely agrees with the age we obtain from the cluster s early type stars as derived from post - mais - sequence models .",
    "our observations of the early type stars also yield new estimates for the cluster s distance and extinction which we find to be in good agreement with previous determinations .",
    "the remaining of this letter is organized as follows : we present the observations in section 2 , the results in section 3 , and conclude with a discussion on section 4 .",
    "ccd ubvr and gunn _ i _ optical data were collected with dfosc mounted at the 1.5 m danish telescope in la silla during the nights of 2001 february 2 and 4 .",
    "the field - of - view of dfosc was @xmath15 with a plate - scale of 0.39@xmath16 per pixel . due to severe distortions on the edges ,",
    "the images were trimmed which resulted in an effective field - of - view of @xmath17 .",
    "a total of 36 images for the cluster , 10 images for the control field , and 36 images of standard fields , were obtained .    to overcome the observational difficulties imposed by @xmath13cma ( severe bleeding , scattered light , ghost images ) resulting in significant data corruption at the very center of the cluster (",
    "@xmath18 , @xmath19 ) , a series of exposures of ngc2362 were taken at four positions ( nsew ) as close as possible to @xmath13cma but avoiding it or its scattered light ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : mosaic ] ) . during the same night we acquired short exposures ( 1 sec ) centered on @xmath13cma to get photometry for the bright stars at the center of the cluster and , in particular , those that were in the region ( an area of @xmath20 ) not covered by the nsew mosaic .    a nearby control field ( @xmath21 north of the cluster )",
    "was also observed , with the same exposure times as the cluster field ( @xmath22 and @xmath23s in the @xmath24 and gunn _ i _ bands , respectively ) , during the night of february 4th .",
    "the control field observations covered one field of view of the ccd .",
    "although the integration times for the cluster and control field were the same , the control field data is not as deep due to the proximity of the moon during the control field observations .",
    "calibration into the standard system was achieved by the observation of several @xcite fields . the typical seeing ( fwhm ) throughout the run was @xmath25 .",
    "all ccd frames were processed within iraf .",
    "images were subjected to the the usual bias and flatfield corrections , and cosmic rays were removed .",
    "photometry was performed with the iraf / daophot package .",
    "a @xmath26 ( @xmath27 pixel ) aperture radius was used in standard star photometry .",
    "the photometry , aperture corrections , extinction corrections , transformation to the standard system and construction of the photometric catalog were performed following the procedures thoroughly described in @xcite .",
    "the final catalog contains photometry for approximately 8300 stars ( @xmath7 4500 stars in all ubvri bands ) in the cluster field , plus approximately 2000 stars in the control field .",
    "in fig .  [ fig : hr]a we introduce the @xmath8 vs. @xmath28 diagram of the stars contained in a @xmath29 diameter circle centered on ngc2362 ( hereafter the _ on _ field ) .",
    "the center of the cluster was estimated to be the peak of the stellar density distribution .",
    "the distribution was computed using the stars falling along the cluster sequence delineated in fig .",
    "[ fig : hr]a ( both zams and pms stars ) .",
    "the center is practically coincident with @xmath13cma .",
    "although previous estimates of the cluster s diameter give a diameter of @xmath30 @xcite , we find a significant concentration of stars , above the background , in the inner @xmath29 diameter .",
    "[ fig : hr]b shows the @xmath8 vs. @xmath28 diagram for the control field ( hereafter the _ off _ field ) .",
    "the area covered on the sky is the same as in the left panel .",
    "the distribution of stars in the _ on _ field color - magnitude diagram follows a sequence which splits into two clearly separated branches below about @xmath8 = @xmath31 magnitudes .",
    "the red branch of this sequence extends at least from @xmath32 to @xmath33 and has no counterpart in the _ off _ field color - magnitude diagram .",
    "this red branch is part of a very long pms band of stars which starts at about @xmath34 mag and is clearly visible from @xmath35 to @xmath36 mag .",
    "the reddening towards ngc2362 was determined by fitting the @xcite zams to the b - star sequence in the @xmath37 ) vs. @xmath38 diagram .",
    "we have determined @xmath39 mag , which is in agreement with the previous estimates by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "no evidence of variable extinction was found at a @xmath40 mag level in @xmath41 .",
    "the distance to ngc2362 was determined by fitting the @xcite zams to the b - star sequence in different color - magnitude diagrams . unlike older clusters , where the a type stars are already on the main sequence , the zams stars in ngc2362 are almost exclusively of spectral type b. this makes the distance determination more difficult since the b - star portion of the zams is nearly vertical for most color - magnitude combinations .",
    "the color that provides a b - star sequence with the lowest possible slope is @xmath42 .",
    "therefore , distance was mainly constrained by the fit in the @xmath8 vs. @xmath42 plane .",
    "the apparent distance modulus was found to be @xmath43 mag . using the standard value for the ratio of total - to - selective absorption , @xmath44",
    ", we find the distance to ngc 2362 to be @xmath45 pc ( @xmath46 ) which is virtually the same as the value adopted by @xcite ( @xmath47 .",
    "the age of ngc2362 was determined following two different approaches . in the first case ,",
    "we have derived a turn - off age by fitting solar composition post - main - sequence isochrones of @xcite to color - magnitude diagrams ( using various color - magnitude combinations ) . in the second case ,",
    "the pre - main - sequence isochrones of @xcite ( solar recipe ) were used in deriving an age based on the location of the low - mass pms stars in the @xmath8 vs. @xmath48 plane .",
    "these particular pms models were selected because they are the most consistent with constraints imposed by recently derived dynamical masses of pms binary stars @xcite .",
    "the solar recipe version of the pms models has only been computed for the @xmath49m@xmath4 mass range , which was the region used in estimating the age .",
    "the @xcite models have also been computed for lower masses ( @xmath50m@xmath4 ) using non solar mixing lengths ( which is unimportant at such low masses ) .",
    "however , the predicted optical colors at these cool temperatures are not robust ( indeed we found departures from the observed sequence ) , and therefore have not been used in the age fits .",
    "the youth of ngc2362 poses two problems to the turn - off age determination .",
    "first , the observed b - star sequence does not show any evident evolutionary deviation from the zams ( in fact , ngc2362 has been used in the past to define the upper zams ) .",
    "second , the high - mass end is dominated by poor statistics , which adds extra difficulty to the analysis : the only star that exhibits evolutionary effects is @xmath13cma which , to make things even harder , is found to be a multiple system ( eg . * ? ? ?",
    "[ fig : age ] shows a 5 myr isochrone fit in the @xmath8 vs. @xmath51 and @xmath8 vs. @xmath48 planes .",
    "the filled circle in the bright end is @xmath13cma , which has been plotted using the photometry of @xcite .",
    "a bar reaching 0.75 mag fainter indicates the magnitude it would have if it was a simple ( non - multiple ) system .",
    "the fit has been essentially constrained by the position of @xmath13cma considering that it is a system of two similar - o9ib - stars .",
    "this age determination agrees with the one by @xcite , which was also based on the position of @xmath13cma .",
    "as previously mentioned , we have also determined the cluster s age by fitting pre - main sequence isochrones of @xcite to the low - mass sequence on the @xmath8 vs. @xmath48 diagram ( fig .",
    "[ fig : age ] ) . in this case ,",
    "none of the problems of the turn - off fit arise : the sequence is well populated , and the evolutionary status is quite obvious ( the pms stars are well above the main sequence ) .",
    "furthermore , the luminosity of the pms branch is a sensitive function of age .",
    "also , the absence of variable reddening within the cluster results in an extremely well defined pms which also helps to constrain the age .",
    "the best fit was obtained for a 5 myr isochrone ( lines on the right of fig .",
    "[ fig : age ] ) .",
    "a 0.75 mag brighter pms isochrone was also plotted to account for the presence of binaries .",
    "that the pms is so tight ( well below the binary limit ) is indicative of a very simple star formation history , most probably a single and quick episode of star formation .",
    "the age spread of the pms stars in the cluster is likely less than 3 myr ( see below ) .    to estimate the age uncertainty we have not considered the uncertainties in the models themselves .",
    "taking into account the photometric and fitting errors we estimate an uncertainty of @xmath52 myr .",
    "the low dispersion of the pms , together with the sensitivity of the pms luminosity to age , have allowed us to place tight constraints on the age .",
    "a somewhat higher uncertainty towards a younger age arises from the fact that we fit the pms isochrones to the _ lower / bluer envelope _ of the observed sequence .",
    "although the _ lower / bluer envelope _ fitting is usually performed in order to avoid the effects of binary contamination and rotation , it could lead the pms fit towards slightly older ages if those effects are not important .",
    "we note here that the ages derived from the pre - main sequence and post- main sequence isochrones are in excellent agreement with each other as well as with the previous age determination for the cluster which was based primarily on the position of @xmath13cma in the hr diagram ( balona and laney 1996 ) . moreover these age estimates are also consistent with the dynamical age estimated for the hii region surrounding the cluster and excited by @xmath13cma @xcite .",
    "we report ubvri observations of ngc 2362 , a very young open cluster in cma , and a nearby control field .",
    "the main findings of this letter are :    1 .   we derive the following fundamental parameters for ngc 2362 : age @xmath0 5@xmath1 myr , distance @xmath0 1480 pc , and reddening @xmath53 0.10 mag .",
    "cluster ages were obtained separately from both the high - mass population ( ob - stars on the main sequence ) and the low - mass ( pms ) population of the cluster and found to be in excellent agreement .",
    "2 .   analysis of this cluster s color - magnitude diagram reveals a long , narrow , and well defined cluster pre - main - sequence , spanning about 9 magnitudes ( in @xmath8 ) in the optical color - magnitude diagrams , with a negligible scatter .",
    "this pms extends from early a stars to late type stars near the hydrogen burning limit .",
    "star formation in the cluster was likely characterized by a single quick episode or burst spanning an interval of no more than about 3 million years .",
    "the observed properties of ngc2362 make it an ideal laboratory for testing pre - main sequence models and investigating early stellar evolution .",
