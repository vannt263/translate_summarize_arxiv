    "the magnetocaloric effect ( mce ) , which is characterized by an isothermal change of the entropy or an adiabatic change of the temperature upon magnetic - field variation , enjoys a great scientific interest mainly because of its immense application potential  @xcite . besides a conventional mce observed in regular ferromagnets or paramagnets ,",
    "there may also be detected an inverse mce , namely , in ferrimagnetic or antiferromagnetic materials . in the former case",
    "the system cools down when the magnetic field is removed adiabatically , while in the latter case it heats up .",
    "however , the mce has been so far rigorously studied only in one - dimensional spin systems ( see e.g.  ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) due to a lack of exactly solved spin models in higher dimensions accounting for a non - zero magnetic field .",
    "theoretical description of the conventional and inverse mce in two- and three - dimensional magnetic systems is thus usually based on some approximative method  @xcite .",
    "the main goal of this work is to investigate the mce in the exactly solved spin-1/2 fisher s super - exchange antiferromagnet  @xcite , which allows an exact theoretical description of this phenomenon also in a two - dimensional spin model .",
    "the spin-1/2 fisher s super - exchange antiferromagnet represents the spin-1/2 ising model on a decorated square lattice , in which the antiferromagnetic ( ferromagnetic ) coupling @xmath1 on horizontal ( vertical ) bonds are supposed together with the external magnetic field @xmath2 acting on decorating spins .",
    "the hamiltonian of the model reads @xmath3 in above , @xmath4 labels the decorated ising spin at @xmath5th horizontal ( @xmath6th vertical ) bond and @xmath7 denotes the nodal ising spin at @xmath8th site of the original square lattice . the first ( second ) summation in the hamiltonian  ( [ eq : h ] )",
    "is thus carried out over nearest - neighbour lattice sites on the horizontal ( vertical ) bonds , while the third term represents the zeeman s energy of the decorating spins @xmath9 .    at zero temperature ,",
    "the system passes from the antiferromagnetically ordered ground state to the paramagnetic one when the magnetic field applied on decorating spins exceeds the critical value @xmath10 .",
    "the former ground state is characterized by a perfect antiferromagnetic arrangement of decorating spins placed on horizontal and vertical bonds , while in the latter ground state the system is broken into a set of @xmath11 spins polarized towards the magnetic - field direction due to a frustration of the nodal spins @xmath12 . at finite temperatures , the existence of the antiferromagnetic long - range order terminates at the critical temperature  @xmath13 of the second - order phase transition , which monotonously decreases with increasing the magnetic field until it entirely tends to zero at @xmath10 .",
    "since the fisher s super - exchange model  ( [ eq : h ] ) is exactly solvable within the decoration - iteration mapping transformation ( for more computational details see works  ) , it provides an excellent paradigmatic example of an exactly soluble two - dimensional spin system , which allows an examination of the mce in a vicinity of the continuous ( second - order ) phase transition at non - zero magnetic fields .",
    "actually , the magnetocaloric quantities , such as the isothermal entropy change @xmath14 and the adiabatic temperature change @xmath15 upon the magnetic - field variation @xmath16 can be rigorously calculated by using the formulas : @xmath17 \\label{eq : dt } \\delta t_{ad}(s , \\delta h)&= & t(s , h\\!\\neq0 ) - t(s , h\\!=0).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] recall that the former relation  ( [ eq : ds ] ) is valid if the temperature @xmath18 of the model is constant , while the latter one  ( [ eq : dt ] ) satisfies the adiabatic condition .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] illustrates temperature dependencies of the isothermal entropy change ( @xmath19 ) normalized per site of the original square lattice for various values of the magnetic - field change @xmath16 .",
    "crosses on relevant curves mark weak singularities of the zero - field entropy found at the critical temperature @xmath20 , while open circles denote weak singularities of the entropy located at critical points of second - order phase transitions at finite magnetic fields @xmath21 and @xmath22 . as one can see",
    ", the magnetocaloric potential @xmath19 may be either positive or negative depending on the temperature , which points to both conventional ( @xmath23 ) and inverse ( @xmath24 ) mce for any value of @xmath25 . in the high - temperature region @xmath26 , where only short - range ordering occurs",
    ", @xmath19 slowly increases to the broad maximum with decreasing temperature due to suppression of a spin disorder by the applied magnetic field . at certain temperature , @xmath19 starts to decrease and changes sign from positive to negative as @xmath18 further decreases .",
    "the zero - temperature limits of @xmath19 are consistent with the entropy values @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 of the antiferromagnetically ordered ground state ,",
    "the paramagnetic ground state and the coexistence of both phases at a first - order phase transition , respectively ( for more details see ref .",
    "minima in low - temperature parts of @xmath30 curves observed around the temperature interval for magnetic - field changes @xmath31 clearly indicate a large inverse mce slightly above the second - order phase transition ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1]a ) .",
    "the origin of this phenomenon can be attributed to strong thermal fluctuations of spins leading to an unusual thermally - induced increase of total magnetization in this region ( compare @xmath30 curves plotted in fig .  [ fig1]a with thermal variations of total magnetization shown in fig .",
    "9 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in accordance with this statement ,",
    "the inverse mce gradually increases and shifts to lower temperatures upon the increase of the field change @xmath25 .",
    "it is obvious from fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] that @xmath32 is always satisfied .",
    "thus , one may conclude that the most pronounced inverse mce can be found for @xmath33 , which exactly coincides with the critical field @xmath34 of the first - order phase transition between the magnetically ordered and paramagnetic ground states . if @xmath35 , the inverse mce ( minimum in @xmath30 curves ) is gradually reduced with the increasing @xmath25 due to weakening of thermal excitations from paramagnetic ground state towards the antiferromagnetically ordered excited state ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1]b ) .    to discuss the mce",
    ", one may alternatively investigate the adiabatic temperature change @xmath15 of the system at various magnetic - field changes @xmath16 .",
    "temperature variations of this magnetocaloric potential for the considered spin model are displayed in fig .",
    "all curves plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] were calculated using eq .",
    "( [ eq : dt ] ) by keeping the entropy constant .",
    "crosses and open circles on relevant curves determine positions of critical temperatures for @xmath36 and @xmath37 , respectively .",
    "obviously , the adiabatic temperature change @xmath15 clearly allows to distinguish the conventional mce ( @xmath38 ) from the inverse mce ( @xmath39 ) . in accordance to the previous discussion",
    ", the investigated model heats up faster in a vicinity of the first - order phase boundary between antiferromagnetically ordered ground state and the paramagnetic ground state achieved upon the adiabatic reduction of the magnetic field .",
    "indeed , the magnitude of the negative peak in @xmath40 curves gradually increases with magnetic - field change and shifts towards the zero - field critical temperature @xmath20 as the applied magnetic field approaches the critical value @xmath34 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2]a ) .",
    "in addition , @xmath15 versus temperature plot ends at zero value in the asymptotic limit of zero temperature for any @xmath31 , which can be attributed to a perfect antiferromagnetic order of decorating spins placed on horizontal and vertical bonds of the square lattice at zero temperature .",
    "by contrast , the adiabatic temperature change rapidly drops to the finite values @xmath41 and @xmath42 at the temperatures @xmath43 and @xmath44 for the magnetic - field changes @xmath45 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2]b ) . in this particular case",
    ", the magnetocaloric potential @xmath15 can not be defined below aforementioned temperatures , because there is no temperature end point in the adiabatic process if @xmath45 .",
    "this intriguing behaviour is evidently caused by residual entropies @xmath46 and @xmath29 detected within the paramagnetic ground state and the coexistence point at the first - order phase transition @xmath34 , respectively .",
    "in this paper , we have investigated magnetocaloric properties of the exactly solved spin-1/2 fisher s super - exchange antiferromagnet by using the known exact solution for the magnetic entropy of the model  @xcite .",
    "the temperature dependencies of the isothermal entropy change and the adiabatic temperature change have been particularly examined for various values of the magnetic - field change . this study has enabled us to clarify the magnetic refrigeration efficiency of the model in a vicinity of the critical temperature of the second - order phase transition , which completely destroys the antiferromagnetic long - range order .",
    "the obtained results for both magnetocaloric potentials clearly indicate on the fast heating of investigated spin system during the adiabatic demagnetization process ( on a presence of the enhanced inverse mce ) in this region due to strong thermal spin fluctuations leading to the thermally - induced increase of the total magnetization .",
    "the maximal heating efficiency of the system has been observed for the magnetic - field change @xmath33 , which coincides with the critical field @xmath34 of the first - order phase transition between the antiferromagnetically ordered and paramagnetic phases . + * acknowledgments * : this work was financially supported by ministry of education , science , research and sport of the slovak republic provided under the vega grant no .",
