    "one of the most promising applications of photonics is the development of ultra - compact optical interconnects for chip - to - chip and even intra - chip communications .",
    "the driving forces behind research in this area are the perceived limitations at high frequency of currently used copper interconnects @xcite , combined with a rapidly increasing demand to move huge amounts of data within increasingly more confined yet increasingly intricate communication architectures .",
    "an approach showing great potential towards developing optical interconnects at chip scale is based on high - index contrast optical waveguides , such as silicon photonic waveguides ( si - phwgs ) implemented on the silicon - on - insulator material platform @xcite . among key advantages provided by this platform are the increased potential for device integration facilitated by the enhanced confinement of the optical field achievable in high - index contrast photonic structures , as well as the particularly large optical nonlinearity of silicon , which makes it an ideal material for active photonic devices .",
    "many of the basic device functionalities required in networks - on - chip have in fact already been demonstrated using si - phwgs , including parametric amplification @xcite , optical modulation @xcite , pulse compression @xcite , supercontinuum generation @xcite , pulse self - steepening @xcite , modulational instability @xcite , and four - wave mixing ( fwm ) @xcite ; for a review of optical properties of si - phwgs see @xcite . however , since the parameter space of si - phwgs is rather limited , there is little room to engineer their optical properties .",
    "a promising solution to this problem has its roots in the advent of photonic crystals ( phcs ) in the late 80 s @xcite .",
    "thus , by patterning an optical medium in a periodic manner , with the spatial periods of the pattern being comparable to the operating optical wavelength , the optical properties of the resulting medium can be modified and engineered to a remarkable extent . following this approach ,",
    "a series of photonic devices have been demonstrated using phcs , including optical waveguides and bends @xcite , optical micro - cavities @xcite , and optical filters @xcite .",
    "one of the most effective approaches to affect the optical properties of phcs is to modify the group - velocity ( gv ) , @xmath0 , of the propagating modes . unlike the case of waves propagating in regular optical media ,",
    "whose gv can hardly be altered , by varying the geometrical parameters of phcs one can tune the corresponding gv over many orders of magnitude .",
    "perhaps the most noteworthy implication of the existence of optical modes with significantly reduced gv , the so - called slow - light @xcite , is that both linear and nonlinear optical effects can be dramatically enhanced in the slow - light regime @xcite .",
    "one of the most important nonlinear optical process , as far as nonlinear optics applications are concerned , is fwm . in the generic case , it consists of the combination of two photons with frequencies , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , belonging to two pump continuous - waves ( cws ) or pulses , followed by the generation of a pair of photons with frequencies @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the energy conservation requires that @xmath5 . in practice , however , an easier to implement fwm configuration is usually employed , namely degenerate fwm . in this case one",
    "uses just one pump with frequency , @xmath6 , the generated photons belonging to a signal ( @xmath7 ) and an idler ( @xmath8 ) beam ; in this case the conservation of the optical energy is expressed as : @xmath9 . among the most important applications of degenerate fwm it is noteworthy to mention optical amplification , wavelength generation and conversion , phase conjugation , generation of squeezed states , and supercontinuum generation . while fwm has been investigated theoretically and experimentally in phc waveguides @xcite and long - period bragg waveguides @xcite , a comprehensive theory of fwm in silicon phc waveguides ( si - phcwgs ) , which rigorously incorporates in a unitary way all relevant linear and nonlinear optical effects as well as the influence of photogenerated free - carriers ( fcs ) on the pulse dynamics is not available yet .    in this article",
    "we introduce a rigorous theoretical model that describes fwm in si - phcwgs .",
    "our model captures the influence on the fwm process of linear optical effects , including waveguide loss , fc dispersion ( fcd ) and fc absorption ( fca ) , nonlinear optical effects such as self- and cross - phase modulation ( spm , xpm ) , two - photon absorption ( tpa ) , and cross - absorption modulation ( xam ) , as well as the mutual interaction between fcs and optical field .",
    "we also illustrate how our model can be applied to investigate the characteristics of fwm in the slow- and fast - light regimes , showing among other things that by incorporating the effects of fcs on the optical pulse dynamics new physics emerge . one noteworthy example in this context",
    "is that the well - known linear dependence of fca on @xmath10 is replaced in the slow - light regime by a @xmath11 power - law dependence .",
    "and the radius of the holes is @xmath12 .",
    "the primed coordinate system shows the principal axes of the si crystal with the input facet of the waveguide in the ( 1@xmath130 ) plane of the si crystal lattice .",

    "dark yellow and brown areas correspond to slab leaky and guiding modes , respectively .",
    "the red and blue curves represent the guiding modes of the 1d waveguides.,width=302 ]    the remaining of the paper is organized as follows . in the next section we present the optical properties of the phc waveguide considered in this work .",
    "then , in sec",

    "the results are subsequently used , in sec .",

    "we conclude our paper by summarizing in the last section the main findings of our article and discussing some of their implications to future developments in this research area . finally , an averaged model that can be used in the case of broad optical pulses is presented in an appendix .     of the @xmath14-odd ( @xmath14-even ) mode , calculated in the plane @xmath15 for five different values of the propagation constant , @xmath16 .",

    "in this section we present the geometrical and material properties of the phc waveguide considered in this work , as well as the physical properties of its optical modes .",
    "thus , our si - phcwg consists of a one - dimensional ( 1d ) waveguide formed by introducing a line defect in a two - dimensional ( 2d ) honeycomb - type periodic lattice of air holes in a homogeneous slab made of silicon ( a so - called w1 phc waveguide ) .",
    "the line defect is oriented along the @xmath17-axis , which is chosen to coincide with one of the @xmath18 symmetry axes of the crystal , and is created by filling in a row of holes [ see fig .  [",
    "fig : geom](a ) ] .",
    "the slab height is @xmath19 and the radius of the holes is @xmath12 , where @xmath20 is the lattice constant , whereas the index of refraction of silicon is @xmath21 .",
    "the defect line breaks the discrete translational symmetry of the photonic system along the @xmath14-axis , so that the optical modes of the waveguide are invariant only to discrete translation along the @xmath17-axis @xcite .",
    "moreover , based on experimental considerations , we restrict our analysis to in - plane wave propagation , namely the wave vector , @xmath22 , lies in the @xmath15 plane .",
    "the @xmath16 component , on the other hand , can be restricted to the first brillouin zone , @xmath23 $ ] , which is an immediate consequence of the bloch theorem . under these circumstances",
    ", we determined numerically the photonic band structure of the system and the guiding optical modes of the waveguide using mpb , a freely available code based on the plane - wave expansion ( pwe ) method @xcite . to be more specific , we used a supercell with size of @xmath24 along the @xmath25- , @xmath14- , and @xmath17-axis , respectively , the corresponding step size of the computational grid being @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath26 , respectively .",
    "figure  [ fig : geom](b ) summarizes the results of these calculations .",
    "thus , the waveguide has two fundamental te - like optical guiding modes located in the band - gap of the unperturbed phc , one @xmath14-even and the other one @xmath14-odd .    , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 , respectively , determined for the even and odd modes .",
    "light green , blue , and red shaded regions correspond to slow - light regime , defined as @xmath31 .",
    "the dashed vertical line in panel ( b ) indicates the zero - gvd wavelength.,width=302 ]    in order to better understand the physical properties of the optical guiding modes , we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : modes ] the profile of the magnetic field @xmath32 , which is its only nonzero component in the @xmath15 symmetry plane .",
    "these field profiles , calculated for several values of @xmath16 , show that although the optical field is primarily confined at the location of the defect ( waveguide ) , for some values of @xmath16 it is rather delocalized in the transverse direction .",
    "this field delocalization effect is particularly strong in the spectral domains where the modal dispersion curves are relatively flat , namely in the so - called slow - light regime , and increases when the group index of the mode , defined as @xmath33 , increases .",
    "the dispersion effects upon pulse propagation in the waveguide are characterized by the waveguide dispersion coefficients , defined as @xmath34 . in particular , the first - order dispersion coefficient is related to the pulse gv via @xmath35 , whereas the second - order dispersion coefficient , @xmath28 , quantifies the gv dispersion ( gvd ) as well as pulse broadening effects .",
    "the wavelength dependence of the first four dispersion coefficients , determined for both guided modes , is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : disp ] , the shaded areas indicating the spectral regions of slow - light . for the sake of clarity , we set the corresponding threshold to @xmath36 , that is the slow - light regime is defined by @xmath31 . as it can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : disp ] , the even mode possesses two slow - light regions , one located at the band - edge ( @xmath37 ) and the other one at @xmath38 , i.e. @xmath39 , whereas the odd mode contains only one such spectral domain located at the band - edge ( @xmath40 ) . moreover , the even mode can have both positive and negative gvd , the zero - gvd point being at @xmath41 , whereas the odd mode has normal gvd ( @xmath42 ) throughout .",
    "since usually efficient fwm can only be achieved in the anomalous gvd regime ( @xmath43 ) , we will assume that the interacting pulses propagate in the even mode unless otherwise is specified .",
    "this section is devoted to the derivation of a system of coupled - mode equations describing the co - propagation of a set of mutually interacting optical pulses in a si - phcwg , as well the influence of photogenerated fcs on the pulse evolution .",
    "we will derive these coupled - mode equations in the most general setting , namely the nondegenerate fwm , then show how they can be applied to a particular case most used in practice , the so - called degenerate fwm configuration .",
    "our derivation follows the general approach used to develop a theoretical model for pulse propagation in silicon waveguides with uniform cross - section @xcite and si - phcwgs @xcite .      in the presence of an external perturbation described by the polarization , @xmath44 , the electromagnetic field of guiding modes with frequency , @xmath45 ,",
    "is described by the maxwell equations , which in the frequency domain can be written in the following form :    [ me ] @xmath46,\\label{he}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath47 is the magnetic permeability , which in the case of silicon and other nonmagnetic materials can be set to @xmath48 , @xmath49 is the dielectric constant of the phc , and @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the electric and magnetic fields , respectively . in our case , @xmath52 is the sum of polarizations describing the refraction index change induced by photogenerated fcs and nonlinear ( kerr ) effects .    in order to understand how the modes of the phc waveguide are affected by external perturbations , let us consider first the unperturbed system , that is @xmath53 .",
    "thus , let us assume that , at the frequency @xmath45 , the unperturbed phc waveguide has @xmath54 guiding modes .",
    "it follows then from the bloch theorem that the fields of these modes can be written as :    [ modedef ] @xmath55    where @xmath56 is the @xmath57th mode propagation constant and @xmath58 ( @xmath59 ) denotes forward ( backward ) propagating modes . here , we consider that the harmonic time dependence of the fields was chosen as @xmath60 .",
    "the mode amplitudes @xmath61 and @xmath62 are periodic along the @xmath17-axis , with period @xmath63 .",
    "moreover , the forward and backward propagating modes obey the following symmetry relations :    [ modesymm ] @xmath64    where the symbol `` @xmath65 '' denotes complex conjugation . as such",
    ", one only has to determine either the forward or the backward propagating modes .",
    "the guiding modes can be orthogonalized , the most commonly used normalization convention being @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the power carried by the @xmath57th mode .",
    "this mode power is related to the mode energy contained in one unit cell of the phc waveguide , @xmath68 , via the relation : @xmath69 where    [ energeh ] @xmath70    are the electric and magnetic energy of the mode , respectively , and @xmath71 is the volume of the unit cell . note that in eq .",
    "we used the fact that the mode contains equal amounts of electric and magnetic energy .",
    "it should be stressed that the waveguide modes defined by eqs .",
    "are exact solutions of the maxwell equations with @xmath53 , and thus they should not be confused with the so - called local modes of the waveguide .",
    "the latter modes correspond to waveguides whose optical properties vary adiabatically with @xmath17 , on a scale comparable to the wavelength and have been used to describe , _",

    ", can be divided in two components according to the physical effects they describe : the linear change of the dielectric constant _ via _ generation of fcs and the nonlinearly induced variation of the index of refraction .",
    "assuming an instantaneous response of the medium , the linear contribution to @xmath52 , @xmath73 , is written as : @xmath74\\mathbf{e}(\\mathbf{r},t),\\ ] ] where @xcite :    [ epslin ] @xmath75    here , @xmath76 is the intrinsic loss coefficient of the waveguide and @xmath77 is the characteristic function of the domain where fcs can be generated , namely @xmath78 in the domain occupied by si and @xmath79 otherwise .",

    "note that in this study we neglect the stimulated raman scattering effect as it is assumed that the frequencies of the interacting pulses do not satisfy the condition required for an efficient , resonant raman interaction .    since silicon belongs to the crystallographic point group @xmath96 the susceptibility tensor @xmath97",
    "has 21 nonzero elements , of which only 4 are independent , namely , @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 , and @xmath101 @xcite .",

    "because of fabrication considerations , in many instances the waveguide is not aligned with any of the crystal principal axes and as such these axes are different from the coordinate axes in which the optical modes are calculated . therefore , one has to transform the tensor @xmath95 from the crystal principal axes into the coordinate system in which the optical modes are calculated @xcite , @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the nonlinear susceptibility in the crystal principal axes and @xmath106 is the rotation matrix that transforms one coordinate system into the other . in our case , @xmath106 is the matrix describing a rotation with @xmath107 around the @xmath25-axis ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : geom ] ) .      in order to derive the system of coupled - mode equations describing pulsed fwm in si - phcwgs",

    "we considered two scenarios , namely these energies were calculated by including fwm terms in eqs .   and",
    "eq .   and , in the other case , by setting them to zero , that is @xmath275 . in the former case , the fwm terms are responsible for transferring energy from the pump pulse to the signal and idler .",
    "therefore , a suitable quantity to characterize the efficiency of this energy transfer is what we call the fwm enhancement factor , @xmath276 , which in the case of the signal is defined as @xmath277 $ ] . here ,",
    "@xmath278 and @xmath279 are the signal energies calculated by taking into account , in one case , spm , xpm , and fwm effects , and only spm and xpm terms in the other case ( i.e. fwm terms are neglected in the latter case ) , and @xmath280 is the input energy of the signal .",
    "the results of these calculations are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : gain ] . in particular",
    ", it can be clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : gain](a ) that the fwm enhancement factor is strongly dependent on pulse propagation regime . to be more specific ,",
    "as the signal and idler are shifting in the slow - light regime a smaller amount of energy is transferred from the pump pulse to the signal .",
    "there are two effects whose combined influence leads to this behavior .",
    "first , as we discussed , the pulses experience larger optical losses in the slow - light regime and therefore the signal losses energy at higher rate . equally important , as the pulses are tuned in the slow - light regime the walk - off parameter , @xmath281 , defined as @xmath282 , increases , meaning that the pulses interact for a shorter time and consequently less energy is transferred to the signal .",
    "these conclusions are clearly validated by the results summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : gain](b ) , where we plot the energy of the signal vs. the propagation distance , determined for several values of the walk - off parameter .",
    "in addition , this figure somewhat surprisingly suggests that the fwm process is more efficient in the fast - light regime , which is again due to the fact that the pump and signal overlap over longer time .",
    ", on the propagation distance , @xmath17 , determined for different values of the group - index , @xmath229 .",
    "( b ) dependence of @xmath283 on @xmath229 , determined for different values of @xmath17 .",
    "the slopes of the curves corresponding to @xmath284 and @xmath285 are shown in the inset.,width=302 ]    it is well known that in the slow - light regime linear optical effects are enhanced by a factor of @xmath286 , whereas cubic nonlinear interactions increase by a factor of @xmath287 .",
    "for example , fca and tpa are proportional to @xmath10 and @xmath288 , respectively .",
    "our theoretical model predicts , however , that when the mutual interaction between fcs and the optical field is taken into account these scaling laws can significantly change .",
    "this can be understood as follows : the amount of fcs generated via tpa , @xmath289 , is proportional to @xmath288 and since fca is proportional to the product @xmath290 , it scales with the gv as @xmath11 .    in order to validate this argument",
    "we have determined the optical total loss experienced by a pulse when it propagates in the presence of tpa and fca or , in a different scenario , when only tpa is present [ the latter case is realized by simply setting @xmath291 in eqs .  ] . moreover , to simplify our analysis , we consider the propagation of only one pulse by setting all parameters describing xpm and fwm interactions to zero .",
    "finally , we also reduced the input power to in order to avoid strong spm - induced pulse reshaping . under these conditions , the effect of the fca on the pulse dynamics can be conveniently characterized by introducing a loss factor , @xmath283 , defined as @xmath292 $ ] , where @xmath293 and @xmath294 are the pulse energies in the case when both tpa and fca terms are included in the model and when only tpa is present , respectively , and @xmath295 is the input energy of the pulse .",
    "the results of these calculations are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : loss ] .",
    "the variation of the loss factor , @xmath283 , with the propagation distance , determined for several values of the gv is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : loss](a ) .",
    "as one would have expected , the loss factor increases with the group - index , @xmath229 , which is a reflection of the fact that the fc - induced losses increase with the decrease of the gv .",
    "one can observe , however , that when the propagation distance is larger than about @xmath296 the loss factor begins to decrease when the gv decreases .",
    "this behavior is a direct manifestation of slow - light effects , namely as the frequency is tuned to the slow - light regime the optical losses increase significantly irrespective of the fact that only tpa is considered or both tpa and fca effects are incorporated in the numerical simulations .",
    "this subtle dependence of fc - induced losses on @xmath0 is perhaps better reflected by the plots presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : loss](b ) . thus , for several values of the propagation distance , we have determined the variation of @xmath283 with the group - index , @xmath229 .",
    "then , by calculating the slope of the function @xmath297 represented on a logarithmic scale one can determine how fc - induced losses scale with @xmath0 [ cf .",
    "the inset in fig .",
    "[ fig : loss](b ) ] .",
    "the results of this analysis clearly demonstrate that fc losses are proportional to @xmath11 , which agrees with the predictions of our qualitative evaluation of this dependence .",
    "we stress that for large @xmath229 ( i.e. , small @xmath0 ) the @xmath11 dependence no longer holds at large propagation distance , chiefly because the pulse is strongly reshaped in the slow - light regime due to enhanced nonlinear optical effects , and thus its peak power is no longer exclusively determined by optical losses .",
    "in conclusion , we have derived a rigorous theoretical model , which describes pulsed four - wave - mixing in one - dimensional photonic crystal slab waveguides made of silicon .",
    "our theoretical model rigorously incorporate all key linear and nonlinear optical effects affecting the optical pulse dynamics , including modal dispersion , free - carrier dispersion , free - carrier absorption , self- and cross - phase modulation , two - photon absorption , cross - absorption modulation , and four - wave mixing .",
    "in addition , the mutual interaction between photogenerated free - carriers and optical field is incorporated in our theoretical analysis in a natural way by imposing the conservation the total energy of the optical field and free - carriers .",
    "importantly , our theoretical formalism allows one to derive rigorous formulae for the optical coefficients characterizing the linear and nonlinear optical properties of the photonic crystal waveguides , avoiding thus any of the approximations that are commonly used in the investigation of nonlinear pulse dynamics in semiconductor waveguides based on photonic crystals .    as a practical application of the theoretical results developed in this study ,",
    "we have used our theoretical model to investigate the properties of degenerate four - wave - mixing of optical pulses propagating in photonic crystal waveguides made of silicon , with a special focus being on highlighting the differences between the pulse dynamics in the slow- and fast light regimes .",
    "this analysis has revealed not only that linear and nonlinear effects are enhanced in the slow - light regime by a factor of @xmath229 and @xmath298 , respectively , but also that these scaling laws are markedly affected in the presence of free - carriers . moreover , since our study has been performed in a very general framework , i.e. generic optical properties of the waveguides ( multi - mode waveguides ) and pulse configuration ( multi - frequency optical field ) , our findings can also be used to describe many phenomena not considered in this work .",
    "for example , important nonlinear effects , including stimulated and spontaneous raman scattering , coherent anti - stokes raman scattering , and third - harmonic generation , can be included in our model by simply adding the proper nonlinear polarizations .",

    "the spatial scale over which the envelope of picosecond pulses varies is much larger than the lattice constant of the phc and therefore for such optical pulses one can simplify the system of equations governing the pulse interaction , i.e. eqs .   and eq .  , by taking the average over one lattice constant",

    "thus , we have considered the slow - light pulse dynamics presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : pulsetime ] and determined the pulse evolution using both the full and averaged models .",
    "as it can be seen , both models predict a similar pulse dynamics for the entire propagation length , @xmath315 .",
    "this result is expected as the envelope of picosecond pulses , as are those chosen in our simulations , spans a large number of unit cells and therefore the pulse amplitude is only slightly affected by the local inhomogeneity of the index of refraction .    the fast variation with @xmath17 of the pulse envelope is shown in fig .  [ fig : pulsetimecomp](g ) , where we plot the @xmath17-dependence of the normalized pulse amplitude , @xmath312 , @xmath313 , calculated for the unit cell starting at @xmath314 .",
