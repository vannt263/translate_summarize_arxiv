    "they are emitted when the stress in the focal region reaches a _ critical _",
    "value before the failure@xcite .",
    "this stems from the fact that a stress variation affects the gibbs energy for the defect formation@xcite , migration@xcite and activation@xcite in solids . for eqs with magnitude 6.5 or larger",
    ", ses are accompanied by detectable magnetic field variations@xcite .",
    "a sequence of ses observed within a short time ( e.g. @xmath3h ) is termed ses activity the analysis of which has been shown to obey an @xmath4-behavior@xcite .",
    "recently , a method@xcite has been presented that enables the shortening of the time - window of the impending mainshock from a few hours to a few days only .",
    "it is based on the concept of a new time domain , termed natural time@xcite and investigates the order parameter of seismicity@xcite ( see also below ) that occurs after the ses activity and before the main shock in the area candidate to suffer a strong eq .",
    "the improvement of that method constitutes the basic aim of the present paper in view of the great practical importance in determining the time of an impending catastrophe . along these lines ,",
    "the most recent ses electric field data are also presented .    in a time series consisting of @xmath5 events , the _ natural time _",
    "@xmath6 serves as an index@xcite for the occurrence of the @xmath7-th event .",
    "the evolution of the pair ( @xmath8 ) is studied@xcite , where @xmath9 denotes a quantity proportional to the energy released in the @xmath7-th event . for dichotomous signals , for example , which is frequently the case of ses activities",
    ", @xmath9 can be replaced by the duration of the @xmath7-th pulse . as a second example , we refer to the analysis of seismicity@xcite , where @xmath9 may be considered as the seismic moment @xmath10 of the @xmath7-th event , since @xmath11 is roughly proportional to the energy released during an eq .",
    "the normalized power spectrum is given@xcite by @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is defined as @xmath14 in this definition , @xmath15 stands for @xmath16 , and @xmath17 ; where @xmath18 denotes the _ natural frequency_. the continuous function @xmath13 in eq.([eq3 ] ) should _ not _ be confused with the usual discrete fourier transform because the latter considers only the relevant values at @xmath19 , while in natural time analysis the properties of @xmath20 or @xmath21 are studied@xcite for natural frequencies @xmath18 less than 0.5 .",
    "this is so , because in this range of @xmath18 , @xmath20 or @xmath21 reduces to a _",
    "characteristic function _ for the probability distribution @xmath15 in the context of probability theory .",
    "when the system enters the _ critical _ stage , the following relation holds@xcite : @xmath22 which for @xmath23 , simplifies to@xcite @xmath24 this relation reflects@xcite that the variance @xmath25 of @xmath0 is given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 . note that in the case of seismicity , eq.([fasma ] ) was found@xcite to describe adequately the most probable value of @xmath20 .",
    "furthermore , as shown in ref.@xcite , @xmath20 for @xmath23 ( or @xmath28 ) can be considered as an order parameter for seismicity since its value changes abruptly when a main shock occurs and the statistical properties of its fluctuations resemble those in other nonequilibrium systems ( e.g. , three - dimensional turbulent flow ) as well as in equilibrium critical phenomena ( e.g. , two - dimensional ising model ) .",
    "apart from @xmath20 or @xmath28 , another useful quantity in natural time is the entropy @xmath29 , which is defined as@xcite @xmath30 this quantity depends on the sequential order of events@xcite and exhibits@xcite concavity , positivity and lesche@xcite stability .",
    "the @xmath29 value becomes equal to @xmath31 for a `` uniform '' ( u ) distribution , as it was defined in refs .",
    "@xcite , e.g. when all @xmath15 are equal or @xmath9 are positive independent and identically distributed random variables of finite variance ( in this case , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are designated @xmath32 and @xmath33 , respectively ) .",
    "the same holds for the value of the entropy obtained@xcite upon considering the time reversal @xmath34 , i.e. , @xmath35 , which is labelled by @xmath36 .",
    "the ses activities , when analyzed in natural time , have been found to exhibit _ infinitely _ ranged temporal correlations and -beyond eq.([ex3])- obey the conditions@xcite : @xmath37    the present paper is organized as follows : section [ dyo ] presents a new procedure for the study of the order parameter of seismicity(@xmath28 ) in the area candidate to suffer a main shock during the period after the initiation of the ses activity until the mainshock occurrence . as examples",
    ", we apply this procedure in section [ tria ] to the most recent ses data .",
    "finally , section [ tesera ] presents the conclusions .",
    "earthquakes exhibit complex correlations in space , time and magnitude ( m ) , as shown by many studies , e.g. @xcite .",
    "moreover , it has been repeatedly proposed that the occurrence of earthquakes can be considered as a critical point ( e.g. @xcite , see also ref.@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "natural time reveals , as mentioned in section i , that @xmath20 or @xmath28 can be considered as an order parameter for seismicity@xcite . to obtain @xmath20 or @xmath28 , however , it is necessary to decide the initiation time of seismicity analysis .",
    "we decided to start the analysis immediately after the ses initiation .",
    "this is based on our fundamental premise proposed long ago@xcite that both ses emission and earthquake occurrence are critical phenomenon and , in a sense , the approach to `` electrical '' critical point shortly precedes `` mechanical '' critical point .",
    "once the ses activity has been recorded , an estimation of the area to suffer a mainshock can be obtained on the basis of the so - called selectivity map@xcite of the station at which the ses obsrvation was made .",
    "thus , we have some area , hereafter labelled a , in which we count the small events ( earthquakes ) @xmath38 that occur after the initiation of the ses activity .",
    "each event @xmath38 is characterized by its location @xmath39 , the conventional time of its occurrence @xmath40 , and its magnitude @xmath41 or the equivalent seismic moment @xmath42 .",
    "the index @xmath43 increases by one each time a new earthquake with magnitude @xmath44 larger or equal to some threshold @xmath45 occurs within the area a ( cf .",
    "@xmath46 ) .",
    "thus , a set of events @xmath47 is formed until the mainshock occurs in a at @xmath48 . to be more precise ,",
    "a family of sets @xmath49 should have been formed before the mainshock occurs in a at @xmath48 , where @xmath50 and the number of events in @xmath49 is denoted by @xmath51 .",
    "the set @xmath49 becomes a ( time ) ordered set ( i.e. , the events are written in the sequence of their occurrence time ) by selecting appropriately the indices @xmath52 @xmath52 for its elements @xmath53 , @xmath54 so that @xmath55 . since earthquakes do not occur everywhere within the area a but in some specific locations , we can also define @xmath56 as the minimal rectangular ( in latitude and longitude ) region in which the epicenters of the events of @xmath49 are located .",
    "moreover , for a given ordered set @xmath49 the corresponding values of @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 can be obtained by analyzing in natural time its ordered elements @xmath53 ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "this is made by analyzing in natural time the pairs @xmath61 where @xmath54 .",
    "it has been repeatedly confirmed@xcite that , when an ses activity is observed , one can specify an area a by the selectivity map and ( at least ) one magnitude threshold @xmath45 which satisfy the conditions ( [ ex3 ] ) and ( [ eq2 ] ) , i.e.,@xmath62 and @xmath63 , a few days to a few days before the main shock .",
    "thus , such a study enables , in principle , prediction of the main shock to be made within a few days to a few hours before its occurrence .",
    "the actual procedure was carried out as follows : for seismicity analysis , we set the natural time zero at the initiation of the ses , and then formed time series of seismic events in natural time each time when ( small ) eqs in a occurred , namely the number @xmath52 increased . the normalized power spectrum in natural time for each of the time series was computed from the pairs @xmath64 , and compared with that of eq.([fasma ] ) for @xmath65 $ ] .",
    "it was found that @xmath66 approaches that of eq.([fasma ] ) a few hours to a few days before the main shock .",
    "we also calculated the evolution of the quantities @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath67 to ascertain eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) was also satisfied .",
    "the conditions for a true coincidence of observed time series with that of critical state were adopted as follows @xcite : first , the ` average ' distance @xmath68 between the @xmath69 of the evolving seismicity and that of eq.([fasma ] ) should be smaller than @xmath70 .",
    "this was a practical criterion .",
    "second , the final approach of @xmath28 of the evolving @xmath69 to that of eq.([fasma ] ) , i.e. , 0.07 , must be by descending from above .",
    "this condition was found empirically .",
    "third , both values @xmath29 and @xmath67 should be smaller than @xmath71 at the coincidence . finally and fourth , since the process concerned is self - similar ( _ critical _ dynamics ) , the time of the occurrence of the ( true ) coincidence should _ not _ vary , in principle , upon changing ( within reasonable limits ) the the size of area and the magnitude threshold @xmath45 .",
    "the basic idea behind the new approach suggested in this paper is the following : when area a reaches criticality , one expects in general that all its subareas have also reached criticality _",
    "simultaneously_. each of these subareas corresponds to a certain value of @xmath28 since the events that sequentially occur in that subarea ( after the initiation of the ses activity ) constitute a time - ordered set ( which is a subset of @xmath49 ) , the natural time analysis of which results in a certain @xmath28-value .",
    "thus , we expect that the distribution of these @xmath28-values obtained from the analysis of all subareas should be centered around 0.070 , according to eq.([ex3 ] ) .    in principle , in order to investigate whether criticality has been approached immediately after the occurrence of a new event @xmath74 within the predicted area a",
    ", we should construct all possible subsets that _ necessarily _ include the event @xmath74 .",
    "each of these subsets may be considered as a proper subset ( @xmath72 ) if and only if it includes all eqs that took place inside its corresponding rectangular subarea , i.e. , @xmath75 .",
    "( this is , of course an approximation -followed through out the present paper- because other geometries , e.g. , circular , could be also considered . ) in what follows , we will solely focus on such proper subsets of @xmath49 .",
    "let us now consider an example in which four earthquakes shown in fig.[sx1 ] have occurred in the area a , in a sequence indicated by the numbers 1,2,3 and 4 .",
    "figure [ sx1 ] depicts the proper subsets of @xmath49 just after the occurrence of each earthquake . in these proper subsets ( which form the @xmath73 $ ] ensemble at each time instant )",
    ", one has to compute the corresponding @xmath28 values and then construct their distribution prob(@xmath28 ) .",
    "the latter distribution depicts the state of the ensemble @xmath73 $ ] .",
    "for example , just after the occurrence of the second event a single proper subset can be defined , thus only @xmath76 $ ] is available . just after the occurrence of the third event , three proper subsets of @xmath49 can be defined as shown in fig .",
    "[ sx1 ] . recall that the necessary condition for having a proper subset at a given time instant is that it should include the last event ( the third earthquake in this case ) and for this reason the result corresponding to @xmath77 is not considered for the construction of the distribution prob(@xmath28 ) [ at this time instant ] . by the same token , after the occurrence of the fourth event , seven proper subsets result , that can be visualized in fig .",
    "thus , we can now calculate @xmath28 for each of these 7 subsets and after assuming equipartition of probability among these subsets- we construct the prob(@xmath28 ) versus @xmath28 graph and then examine whether it maximizes at @xmath78 0.070 ( i.e. , obeys eq.([ex3 ] ) ) .    in other words , in the new approach , the @xmath28-values of all these subareas that enclose earthquakes that occurred after the initiation of the ses until a given time instant are included together with the corresponding results of the largest area a , all of them treated on _ equal _ footing .",
    "then by performing an averaging procedure over _ all _ those proper subsets ( which correspond , at a given time instant , to a large number of subareas of a ) , we expect that the average will also satisfy eq.([ex3 ] ) .",
    "we shall demonstrate in the next section by using precise experimental examples , which refer to the most recent ses activities recorded in greece , that the following may also determine the time - window of the impending main shock : the average value @xmath79}$ ] obtained when using the ensemble @xmath73 $ ] satisfies the condition ( [ ex3 ] ) and then the mainshock occurs within a few days at the most .",
    "in fig.[sesact ] , we depict four ses activities that have been recently recorded at the stations pat ( in central greece ) and pir ( western greece ) : ( a ) on november 7 , 2007 , at pat ( b ) on january 10 , 2008 , at pat ( c ) on january 14 , 2008 , at pir and ( d ) on february 9 , 2008 , at pat . these have been classified as ses activities by applying the usual criteria ( i.e. , the conditions [ ex3 ] and [ eq2 ] ) explained in detail in ref.@xcite .",
    "in addition , two long duration ses activities were recorded at pir from january 21 to january 26 , 2008 and from february 29 to march 2 , 2008 that will be described separately in subsection e. we now apply the present procedure to all these cases :      the investigation of the seismicity subsequent to that ses activity was made in the area a:@xmath80 which was already indicated in ref.@xcite . at 05:14 ut on 6th january , 2008 , a major earthquake ( m6.6 ) occurred with epicenter located at 37.1@xmath81n22.8@xmath81e , i.e. , only around 50 km to the south of the area a studied . what happened before that eq can be seen in fig.[leo ] .",
    "an inspection of this figure reveals that the prob(@xmath28 ) maximizes at around @xmath82 and @xmath79}=0.070 $ ] with standard deviation 0.008 upon the occurrence of a small event at 04:32 on january 4 , 2008 , i.e. , almost two days before the main shock .",
    "the investigation of the seismicity was also made@xcite in the area a:@xmath80 .",
    "the results are shown in fig.[pat ] , where we see that prob(@xmath28 ) exhibits bimodal feature with a secondary peak at @xmath83 upon the occurrence of the small events at 12:21 ut and 13:26 ut on february 3 , 2008 ( these two cases are shown with arrows ) .",
    "actually , at 20:25 ut and 22:15 ut on february 4 , 2008 two eqs with magnitudes 5.4 and 5.5 occurred with epicenters around 38.1@xmath81n21.9@xmath81e lying at a small distance ( @xmath8410 km ) from the measuring station pat and inside the area studied .",
    "since this ses activity was recorded at pir , the study of the seismicity was made in the area @xmath85 indicated in ref.@xcite well in advance .",
    "the results of the computation are depicted in fig.[p14 ] , which reveals that the prob(@xmath28 ) also exhibits bimodal feature , one mode of which maximizes at @xmath86 upon the occurrence of a small event at 04:07 ut on february 12 , 2008 .",
    "almost two days later , i.e. , at 10:09 ut on february 14 , 2008 , a major eq of magnitude 6.7 occurred at 36.5@xmath81n21.8@xmath81e .",
    "this eq -according to usgs calatogue ( which reported @xmath876.9)- is the strongest eq that occurred in greece during the last twenty years .",
    "in addition , a few hours later , i.e. , at 12:08 ut , a m6.6 earthquake occurred at 36.2@xmath81n 21.8@xmath81e .",
    "the results until early in the morning on march 19 , 2008 , of the study of the seismicity in the area@xcite @xmath88 can be visualized in fig .",
    "[ oldfig5 ] which shows that prob(@xmath28 ) has not exhibited a maximum at @xmath86 yet .",
    "this investigation is still in progress .",
    "this was a long duration ses activity ( see fig .",
    "[ fig5](c ) ) with polarity opposite to that of another long duration ses activity which was observed also at pir from january 21 , 2008 to january 26 , 2008 ( fig.[fig5](b ) ) .",
    "further , for the sake of comparison , in fig.[fig5](a ) , we present one more long duration ses activity on september 17 , 2005 at pir that was followed by the mw6.7 eq at 36.3@xmath81n23.2@xmath81e on january 8 , 2006 .",
    "the occurrence of the latter two major eqs ( jan.8 , 2006 and feb.14 , 2008 ) , leads to the updated selectivity map of pir as shown by the shaded area in fig.[fig6 ] which lies along the hellenic arc ( marked with a thick solid line ) .",
    "in other words , the impending main shock for the ses activity of february 29 , 2008 to march 2 , 2008 is expected to occur in this shaded area .    a further study of the imminent seismicity is now in progress in order to clarify which region of the shaded area in fig.[fig6 ] , will finally exhibit the expected feature , i.e. , the maximization of prob(@xmath28 ) at @xmath890.07 ( see appendix ) .",
    "upon the recording of an ses activity , one can estimate an area a within which the impending mainshock is expected to occur . following the subsequent seismicity ,",
    "the probability density function of @xmath28 is obtained , which maximizes at @xmath90 a few days at the most before the occurrence of the mainshock .",
    "at 19:16 ut on march 25 , 2008 , the ongoing investigation of the seismicity ( for @xmath91 ) in the area @xmath92 ( see ref.@xcite ) , after the ses activity of february 29 to march 2 , 2008 at pir , showed a maximization of prob(@xmath28 ) at @xmath93 as shown in fig.[figa1 ] .",
    "this was forwarded to various interested institutes in europe , japan and usa at 21:47 ut on march 26 , 2008 . actually , almost one day later , i.e. , at 00:16 ut on march 28 , 2008 , a ms(ath)=5.7 eq ( pde of usgs reported mw=5.6 ) , occurred at 35.0@xmath81n 25.3@xmath81e lying approximately 150 km to the east of the southern part of the pir selectivity map shown by the shaded area in fig.[fig6 ] .    in view of the amplitude of the ses activity in fig .",
    "[ fig5](c ) discussed in the main text ( which is comparable to that of the ses activities depicted in figs.[fig5](a ) and [ fig5](b ) ) , the study of the seismicity still continued to investigate if a more pronounced peak of prob(@xmath28 ) at @xmath780.070 would eventually occur in the near future .",
    "this actually happened at 12:26 ut on may 8 , 2008 and almost two days later , i.e. , at 20:53 ut on may 10 , 2008 a ms(ath)=5.6 eq occurred with an epicenter at 36.4@xmath81n22.3@xmath81e ( see also below ) .      in continuation of the study mentioned in the appendix ,",
    "the ongoing investigation of the seismicity in the shaded area of fig.[fig6 ] reveals the following ( cf . a calculation with @xmath91 similar to the one in the previous cases ,",
    "can not be practically carried out in this case due to the large number of the events , i.e. , more than half a thousand , involved in the calculation ; recall that @xmath45 refer to the ml values reported by the athens observatory ) :          the aforementioned calculations show that , at a first approximation and within reasonable time limits , magnitude threshold invariance seems to hold . the extent to which , this behaviour will conform to the main conclusion of the present paper , it remains to be seen .",
    "at 15:11 ut on may 25 , 2008 a ms(ath)=4.6 eq occurred at 38.2@xmath81n 22.7@xmath81e ( pde of usgs reported mb=4.7 ) .",
    "it is not yet clear whether this eq is associated with the shaded area in fig.[fig6 ] ( in particular with its lobe that almost reaches pat ) or with the rectangular area @xmath88 .",
    "in addition , at 23:26 ut on may 27 , 2008 a ms(ath)=5.1 eq occurred with an epicenter around 35.5@xmath81n 22.4@xmath81e , as expected by the note added on may 19 , 2008 . upon the occurrence of this event , prob(@xmath28 ) exhibits a pronounced maximum at @xmath97 marked by an arrow in fig.[figa2 ] drawn for @xmath98 .",
