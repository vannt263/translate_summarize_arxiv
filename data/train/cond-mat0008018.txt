    "in most areas of condensed - matter research , a few model systems outshine all others by their prototypical significance , which promises to encapsulate the essence of a physical phenomenon with little interference of collateral degrees of freedom . in cooperative magnetism , the ising model , the heisenberg model , and the hubbard model , for example , are theoretical many - body systems that have kept generations of researchers fascinated .",
    "the prominence of such models and the abundance of theoretical predictions for many of their physical properties have at times led to a reversal of the traditional relationship between theory and experiment . instead of theorists proposing and solving models for the purpose of explaining measurements performed on specific materials , we see magneto - chemists and condensed - matter experimentalists at work searching for materials which are physical realizations of the prototypical models .",

    "the magnetic field @xmath3 is a continuous parameter which has a strong impact on most physical properties and which is directly controllable in experiments .",
    "the high degrees of computational and experimental control is what makes this system so attractive to researchers .",
    "physical realizations of heisenberg antiferromagnetic chains have been known for many years in the form of 3d crystalline compounds with quasi-1d exchange coupling between magnetic ions .",
    "the desired properties of the best candidate material include the following : the coupling of the effective electron spins must be highly isotropic in spin space and overwhelmingly predominant between nearest - neighbor magnetic ions along one crystallographic axis . the intra - chain coupling must not be too weak or else it will be hard to study the low - temperature properties , which are of particular interest",
    ". it must not be too strong either or else it will be hard to reach a magnetic field that makes the zeeman energy @xmath4 comparable to the exchange energy @xmath5 .",

    "what happens in a magnetic neutron scattering experiment ?",
    "a beam of monochromatic neutrons , ideally a plane wave with well defined momentum and energy , is scattered inelastically off an array of spin chains via magnetic dipolar interaction between the exchange coupled electron spins and the neutron spin into a superposition of waves with a range of momenta and energies .",
    "each inelastic scattering event causes a transition between two eigenstates of the spin chain .",
    "the difference in energy and wave number of the two eigenstates involved must be matched by the energy and momentum transfer of the scattered neutron .",
    "if the measurement is performed at very low temperature , it is reasonable to assume that the observable scattering events predominantly involve transitions from the ground state @xmath10 to excitations @xmath11 with energies and wave numbers within a window preset by the experimental setup .",
    "the experiment thus enables us to have a direct look at the excitation spectrum of the spin chain .",
    "it probes the spin fluctuations as described by the fluctuation operator @xmath12 for wave numbers @xmath13 . under idealized circumstances ,",
    "the inelastic neutron scattering cross section is proportional to the dynamic spin structure factor at zero temperature:@xcite @xmath14    each scattering event with energy transfer @xmath15 and momentum transfer @xmath16 along the chain induces a transition from @xmath10 to @xmath11 and contributes a spectral line of intensity @xmath17 to @xmath18 .",
    "for a macroscopic system , the spectral lines are arranged in a variety of patterns in @xmath19-space , including branches , continua , and more complicated structures .",
    "the functions @xmath18 thus provide a palette of information about the @xmath20 dynamics of the spin chain .",
    "unlike in a classical dynamical system , where all motion grinds to a halt at @xmath20 , the quantum wheels keep turning  a phenomenon known as zero point motion . for the heisenberg model ( [ eq : hh ] ) in the ground state @xmath10 , the quantum fluctuations of any observable @xmath21 of interest can be described by a time - dependent correlation function of the form @xmath22 if @xmath21 is conserved ( @xmath23=0 $ ] ) , then @xmath24 is a constant .",
    "different dynamical variables @xmath25 yield different correlation functions for the same ground state @xmath10 .",
    "the dynamical variable seen by neutrons during the magnetic scattering is @xmath26 .",
    "fourier transforming ( [ eq : dcf ] ) with @xmath27 yields the dynamic spin structure factor ( [ eq : dssf ] ) ( problem  1 ) .    light scattering , electron scattering , photoemission , and nuclear magnetic resonance are some other experimental techniques used to investigate the dynamics of ( [ eq : hh ] ) .",
    "different measuring techniques view the same excitation spectrum through lenses of different color , i.e. by transition rates specific to particular fluctuation operators . hence each experimental probe filters out a specific aspect of the zero point motion by viewing a particular dynamical variable of one and the same system .",
    "the goal set for this column is to teach the reader how to make detailed predictions based on the bethe ansatz solution of ( [ eq : hh ] ) for the inelastic neutron scattering cross section as can be measured on quasi-1d antiferromagnetic materials .",
