    "recent achievement of bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) in gases of alkali atoms has generated an impressive amount of experimental and theoretical works @xcite . in these systems the condensate is usually described by the so - called gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) , a schrdinger equation with a local cubic non - linear term which represents the interaction among the bosons in a mean field approximation .",
    "gpe effectively reproduces the ground state properties of a condensed boson gas confined by an external potential at zero temperature @xcite . in the framework of linear response theory",
    ", the mean field approximation also allows to evaluate the spectrum of the excitations in presence of an external time - dependent perturbation @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", gpe also appears in the description of other physical systems , like nonlinear optics @xcite , molecular physics @xcite , _",
    "etc._.    in this paper we study general properties of the stationary solutions of gpe both in the case of repulsive and attractive interaction . besides its mathematical interest , this study is relevant in the search of the so - called vortex states and , in general , in understanding the dynamical properties of condensates .",
    "we choose to work in the grand - canonical ensemble , that is we fix the chemical potential @xmath0 of the system , _",
    "i.e. _ the proper frequency for the time evolution , and derive the number of particles corresponding to each stationary solution .",
    "in particular , we study the stationary solutions of gpe that have a linear counterpart , in the sense that they reduce to the eigenstates of the linear schrdinger equation which is the limit of gpe for vanishing interaction . for these states we conjecture an existence condition which depend on the ratio between the chemical potential and the corresponding eigenvalue of the associated schrdinger equation .",
    "we give a proof of this conjecture for the node - less state of a system in presence of a general external potential and verify it for the exactly solvable case of a one - dimensional , infinitely deep , square well .",
    "we also provide numerical evidence of the validity of the conjecture by studying systems with harmonic potentials in different dimensions .    as a consequence of the above conjecture",
    ", we find that in the case of attractive condensates there exists a range of the chemical potential @xmath0 in which the node - less stationary solution does not exist and the lowest - energy state has one or more nodes .",
    "this may be relevant for the observation of stable vortex states .",
    "we also study the limit of strong non - linearity of gpe obtained for large values of the modulus of the chemical potential @xmath0 . in this limit",
    "a thomas - fermi approximation holds for repulsive systems , while for attractive systems the solutions become independent of the external potential . in the one - dimensional case",
    "the corresponding approximate solutions have the form of a chain of dark or bright solitons depending on the sign of the non - linearity .",
    "we use these asymptotically exact expressions to establish that the number of particles in the ground state of an attractive condensate is always bounded for dimensions greater than one in agreement with previous numerical results @xcite .",
