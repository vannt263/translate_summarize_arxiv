    "a population of star - forming galaxies at high redshifts are characterized by their strong lyman-@xmath0 ( ly@xmath0 ) line emission . such ly@xmath0 emitters ( laes )",
    "have been found at various redshifts by narrow - band surveys using 8 - 10  m class telescopes @xcite .",
    "it is generally thought that the strong ly@xmath0 emission physically originates from star - forming regions ( hii regions ) in a young starburst galaxy .",
    "some laes have very large equivalent widths ( @xmath4 ) exceeding @xmath5 , which is difficult to explain with ordinary stellar population synthesis models ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "alternative physical models include cooling radiation from a primordial collapsing gas @xcite , from a galactic wind - driven shell @xcite , and from supernova remnants @xcite .",
    "recent large lae surveys provided an array of statistical properties of laes such as the ly@xmath0 luminosity function , two - point angular correlation function and the evolution of them .",
    "the observations generally suggest that laes are not simply a subset of star - forming galaxies . indeed , theoretical models proposed so far do not fully explain the observed properties .",
    "in particular , reproducing very large equivalent widths of some bright laes appears to be challenging .",
    "ly@xmath0 photons are easily absorbed by dust and thus it is naively expected that lae is a very young and dust - free galaxy . while some observations and theoretical studies actually support the notion @xcite , more recent multi - wavelength observations of laes in optical , infrared and sub - millimeter suggest that there are laes that are indeed old and dusty @xcite .",
    "interestingly , such a population increases with decreasing redshift @xcite",
    ". there is even an evidence that some sub - millimeter galaxies show strong ly@xmath0 emission @xcite .",
    "the existence of a substantial amount of dust appears incompatible with strong ly@xmath0 emission .",
    "there must be a physical mechanism for ly@xmath0 photons to escape from such dusty galaxies .",
    "there have been a number of theoretical studies on the population of laes .",
    "@xcite study a stochastic model where a galaxy goes through lae phase occasionally .",
    "@xcite argue that an old evolved galaxy can become a lae as a consequence of delayed gas accretion .",
    "their model assumes that the delayed starburst occurs at outskirt of a galaxy so that ly@xmath0 photons can escape easier than those emitted from the central region .",
    "@xcite perform cosmological simulations , which reproduce well the uv and ly@xmath0 luminosity functions .",
    "@xcite also calculate the neutral hydrogen fraction at @xmath6 by using a combination of their lae formation model and radiation transfer calculation of hydrogen reionization . in the most recent work of @xcite , absorption of ly@xmath0 photons by dust",
    "is treated in a very simple manner , where a dusty gas is a pure absorber .",
    "it has been suggested that large - scale gas motions in and around galaxies can affect the absorption of ly@xmath0 photons @xcite .",
    "strong galactic winds from ly@xmath0 emitting galaxies are indeed found in the local universe @xcite .",
    "strong winds are also seen in high-@xmath7 lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) with strong ly@xmath0 emission @xcite .",
    "although the large - scale velocity structure is rather important , it is unlikely that all the laes blow strong galactic winds because only a small fraction of high redshift galaxies shows the signature of strong outflow @xcite .",
    "it appears that another physical process is necessary for massive dusty galaxies to be bright laes .",
    "@xcite proposed an important effect for ly@xmath0 transfer . in a clumpy , multi - phase inter - stellar medium ( ism ) , dust",
    "is locked up in small cold clouds .",
    "ly@xmath0 photons can then escape from the clumpy ism _ easier _ than continuum photons because ly@xmath0 photons , having a very large scattering cross - section , are preferentially scattered at the surface of the clouds . on the other hand , uv continuum photons",
    "are easily absorbed by dust .",
    "neufeld s model can explain not only the existence of ly@xmath0 emission from dusty galaxies but also the observed high equivalent widths @xcite .",
    "clearly it is important to incorporate the effect in modelling laes .    in this paper , we study the statistical properties of laes at @xmath1 .",
    "we perform large cosmological hydrodynamic simulations for the standard @xmath8cdm cosmology .",
    "our simulations follow star formation , supernova feedback , and metal enrichment . for galaxies identified in our cosmological simulation , we calculate the spectral evolution and dust extinction .",
    "unlike in semi - analytic methods , we can directly study the internal structure of simulated galaxies as well as their spatial distribution in a cosmological volume .    throughout this paper ,",
    "we adopt the @xmath8cdm cosmology with the matter density @xmath9 , the cosmological constant @xmath10 , the hubble constant @xmath11 in units of @xmath12 , the baryon density @xmath13 , and the matter density fluctuations are normalized by setting @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "all magnitudes are expressed in the ab system , and all ly@xmath0 ew@xmath15 values in this paper are in the rest frame .",
    "our simulation code is based on an early version of the tree - pm smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) code gadget-3 which is a successor of tree - pm sph code gadget-2 @xcite .",
    "we simulate @xmath16 particles in a comoving volume of 100 @xmath17 on a side .",
    "the mass of a dark matter particle and that of a gas particle are @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively .",
    "physical processes such as star formation and feedback are implemented as in @xcite . in particular ,",
    "our simulations employ a new galactic wind model in which the initial velocity of a wind particle is proportional to the local velocity dispersion of the dark matter particles .",
    "this is motivated by observations that suggest large scale outflows have velocities that scale with the circular velocity of their host galaxies @xcite . as a proxy for host halo s circular velocity , which is not easily calculated on - the - fly , we use the local one - dimensional velocity dispersion , determined from neighbouring dark matter particles .",
    "@xcite found that this quantity , @xmath20 , is strongly correlated with the maximum circular velocity of host ( sub- ) halos , @xmath21 , and the relation between these quantities does not evolve with redshift .",
    "this prescription results in a wind speed that increases as a halo grows and hence a wind mass - loading ( wind mass per unit star formation rate ) is highest at early times ( or in small halos ) .",
    "this scaling has been shown to reproduce the physical properties of the local group satellites @xcite .",
    "our simulations include the time - evolving photoionization background @xcite , metallicity - dependent gas cooling and photoheating @xcite , supernovae feedback and chemical enrichment @xcite .",
    "we use metallicity - dependent stellar lifetimes and chemical yields @xcite .",
    "the details of these processes are found in the above references .",
    "here we give a brief description .",
    "each sph particle can spawn a new star particle when the particle satisfies a set of standard criteria for star formation .",
    "a star particle carries its properties such as mass , formation time and metallicity .",
    "we calculate the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of each star particle using the population synthesis code pgase @xcite .",
    "we then sum the individual seds to obtain the total sed of a simulated galaxy .",
    "we run a friends - of - friends group finder @xcite to locate groups of stars , i.e. , galaxies .",
    "we also identify substructures ( subhalos ) in each fof group using subfind algorithm developed by @xcite .",
    "for the identified galaxies , we calculate the intrinsic ly@xmath0 luminosities using pegase. in pegase , two thirds of ionizing photons are converted to ly@xmath0 photons under the assumption of the case b recombination .",
    "finally , we calculate the effect of dust extinction on ultra - violet continuum and ly@xmath0 emission .",
    "this is the key component of our model .",
    "we will describe the details in the next subsection .",
    "we calculate the sed and the ly@xmath0 luminosity for individual galaxies identified in our cosmological simulation . in order to compare our model predictions directly with observational data ,",
    "we need to include the effect of dust absorption .",
    "we first assume that the dust mass to metal mass ratio is a constant of @xmath22 , consistent with the local value .",
    "note that the metallicity of a galaxy is calculated from the metallicities of gas particles .",
    "we further assume that the galaxies are roughly spherical ; we use only one length scale , the effective radius , to evaluate the optical depth .",
    "we calculate the optical depth @xmath23 for uv continuum photons as @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the typical size of dust grains , and the material density of dust grains , respectively .",
    "we adopt the standard choice of @xmath27 and @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "the dust surface mass density @xmath29 is @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the total dust mass ( @xmath33 of metal mass ) and the effective radius of the galaxy , respectively .",
    "the effective radius @xmath32 is a fraction of the virial radius and is given by @xmath34 with @xmath35 .",
    "the escape fraction of uv continuum photons @xmath36 is then calculated as @xmath37 we use the dust optical constant @xmath38 as a function of wavelength given in @xcite .",
    "we also calculate the igm absorption at the blue side of @xmath39 following @xcite .",
    "a crucial quantity in our model is the effective optical depth of ly@xmath0 line , @xmath40 .",
    "we employ two models to calculate the effective optical depth . a simplest assumption would be to set @xmath41 where @xmath42 is a constant parameter .",
    "then , the escape fraction of ly@xmath0 photons @xmath43 is given by @xmath44 we call this model as pure absorption model .",
    "essentially , dust is treated as a pure absorber of ly@xmath0 photons in this model ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "ly@xmath0 photons can not easily escape from dusty galaxies which have a large effective optical depth .",
    "the second model , which we propose in the present paper , is motivated by the multiphase inter - stellar medium ( ism ) model of @xcite . in a clumpy ism ,",
    "ly@xmath0 photons are scattered mostly at the surface of cold clumps before they are absorbed by dust . a large fraction of ly@xmath0 photons",
    "can then escape from a clumpy ism through multiple scatters .",
    "the key quantity here is the overall clumpiness of the ism in a galaxy .",
    "since our cosmological simulation does not resolve the fine structure of the ism , we need to estimate the clumpiness of the ism in some way .",
    "it is probably reasonable to expect that the ism structure is well developed in a massive galaxy which itself has rich substructures .",
    "we make an assumption that the clumpiness of the ism has a correlation with the larger scale internal structure of a galaxy . in practice",
    ", we use the number of subhalos ( satellites ) @xmath45 of the galaxy as a measure of its `` clumpiness '' .",
    "we introduce the clumpiness factor @xmath46 , which depends on @xmath45 , and express the effective optical depth of ly@xmath0 line as @xmath47 where @xmath48 is a normalization constant . for simplicity , we assume the clumpiness factor is expressed as a power - law @xmath49 after some experiments , we find that setting @xmath50 works remarkably well , reproducing nearly all the important observational data , as will be shown in the following sections .",
    "we call this model the substructure model .",
    "the escape fraction of ly@xmath0 photons @xmath51 in this model is given by @xmath52    the combination of equation ( [ eq : sclump ] ) and equation ( [ eq : fesc_sub ] ) effectively yields a larger escape fraction for a dusty but `` clumpy '' galaxy .",
    "finally , we fix the normalization constants in the two models , @xmath42 and @xmath48 , by matching the number density of simulated laes with the observed number density @xmath53 $ ] @xcite .",
    "we identify simulated galaxies which satisfy @xmath54 and @xmath55}$ ] as laes .",
    "fig . [ laes_dist ] shows the projected distribution of the laes at @xmath1 in the simulation volume of 100 comoving @xmath2mpc on a side . the point size represents the ly@xmath0 luminosity of each galaxy .",
    "luminous laes are shown by large and red points .",
    "the overall distribution appears quite similar in the two models , with laes approximately tracing the underlying matter distribution .",
    "the luminous laes are clustered more strongly in the substructure model , although the difference is small .",
    "we quantify the spatial distribution of the simulated laes .",
    "we calculate the two - point angular correlation function ( acf ) and compare it with the observed correlation function .",
    "the acf of laes found in the ssa22 field @xcite is used for the comparison .",
    "[ acf ] shows the acfs for the two models . both of the models reproduce the observational result well .",
    "the laes are hosted by dark halos with mass of @xmath56 .      in fig .",
    "[ lya_lf ] , we compare the ly@xmath0 luminosity functions with the observational data at @xmath57 @xcite .",
    "the pure absorption model ( left panel ) does not reproduce the observational data at the bright end .",
    "it predicts a smaller number of laes by a factor of ten at @xmath58 . in both our models ,",
    "the intrinsic ly@xmath0 luminosity of a galaxy is proportional to its star formation rate ( sfr ) , and thus the _ intrinsically _ bright laes are hosted typically by massive halos .",
    "however , such massive galaxies are also aged and dusty .",
    "because of the strong dust absorption of ly@xmath0 photons ( see equation [ [ eq : tau_abs ] ] ) , dusty star - forming galaxies do not appear as laes in the pure absorption model .",
    "our substructure model , on the other hand , shows a substantially better agreement with the observational data . in the substructure model , dusty , aged and massive galaxies have complex internal structures .",
    "we assume that the evolved galaxies have also a more complex ism structure , where ly@xmath0 photons can escape easily because of the neufeld effect .",
    "thus , even aged and dusty galaxies appear as bright laes and the resulting luminosity function matches the observation very well at the bright - end .",
    "interestingly , the substructure model predicts that the ly@xmath0 escape fraction of massive galaxies is @xmath3 , with a substantial dispersion . in the pure absorption model ,",
    "the ly@xmath0 escape fraction decreases proportionally to the halo mass because of the size effect and also because massive galaxies are more metal - enriched .",
    "[ muv_ew ] shows the distributions of our simulated laes in the @xmath60 plane at @xmath1 . in this plot ,",
    "both models appear similar , with the laes populating the region where the observational data points also lie .",
    "although both the models reproduce the observed trend that the equivalent width decreases with uv luminosity , only the substructure model predicts the existence of uv bright galaxies ( @xmath61 ) with large @xmath62 .",
    "this is again owing to the effect of enhanced ly@xmath0 luminosity in the substructure model .",
    "we also note here that the substantial dispersion of @xmath4 for uv bright laes , as is also found in the observations , is important .",
    "apparently the lyman@xmath0 escape fraction is not a simple function of the galaxy mass only .",
    "we discuss this issue more in detail in the discussion section .      in fig .",
    "[ ew_dist ] , we compare the rest - frame ly@xmath0 equivalent width of simulated laes ( histograms ) with the observational data ( solid line with error bars ) . in the pure absorption model ,",
    "@xmath4 distribution is approximately - constant at @xmath63 whereas the observed distribution decreases toward high @xmath4 .",
    "the substructure model reproduces the observed @xmath4 distribution very well .",
    "it is interesting that the fraction of large @xmath4 galaxies is similar between the two models .",
    "however , the substructure model predicts more laes with @xmath64 . for these laes ,",
    "uv continuum is absorbed by dust significantly but ly@xmath0 photons can escape again by the scattering effect .",
    "finally , we show the age distribution of simulated laes in fig .",
    "we assign the age of a simulated lae by calculating the mass weighted mean of the stellar ages .",
    "the simulated laes shows clearly a bimodal distribution .",
    "recently formed galaxies are young laes , whereas massive , dusty galaxies with @xmath65 years can also appear as bright laes .",
    "the latter population is indeed found recently by @xcite .",
    "we study a number of observed properties of laes using a large cosmological hydrodynamic simulation .",
    "the simulation follows the formation and evolution of star - forming galaxies by employing new feedback models of @xcite .",
    "we develop a novel model in which ly@xmath0 photons can escape from a massive , dusty galaxy if the ism is clumpy .",
    "the idea is motivated by the multiple scattering and escape of ly@xmath0 photons originally proposed by @xcite .",
    "our physical model of laes reproduces not only the ly@xmath0 luminosity function but also @xmath59 distribution , the equivalent width distribution and the angular two - point correlation function at @xmath1 .",
    "it is the first theoretical model that successfully reproduces all these observational results using cosmological hydrodynamic simulations .",
    "interestingly , the model predicts the ly@xmath0 escape fraction is roughly constant for the massive laes .",
    "massive , dusty and aged galaxies can appear as bright laes , as is consistent with recent observations .",
    "contrastingly , the pure absorption model fails in reproducing many of the observational results .",
    "we argue that the kind of effect to enhance ly@xmath0 photon escape from massive dusty galaxies is necessary for modeling laes .",
    "it is interesting to ask if the ly@xmath0 escape fraction can be described as a simpler function of galaxy mass . in our simulation ,",
    "the substructure abundance of simulated galaxies roughly scales with their host halo mass , although with substantial dispersions .",
    "it has turned out that the dispersion is also important to reproduce some observational results . to explicitly test the idea ,",
    "we have employed a simpler model in which the ly@xmath0 escape fraction is a function of host halo mass so that the escape fraction approximately matches to the mean escape fraction of our substructure model for a given halo mass .",
    "we have found that this simple model fails in reproducing the @xmath59 distribution and acf .",
    "the simple model boosts the ly@xmath0 luminosity too much and can not explain the existence of uv - bright laes with low equivalent widths ( see fig .",
    "[ muv_ew ] ) .",
    "furthermore , in the simple model , massive galaxies are identified selectively as laes .",
    "consequently the strength of acf becomes large , although it is still within the upper bound of the current data .",
    "overall , we conclude that the internal structure of a galaxy is an important factor to determine its appearance as a lae .",
    "interestingly , @xcite argue that a large scatter of ly@xmath0 emission versus metallicity correlation might be caused by the structure of the interstellar medium .    in the present paper , we have focused on the physical properties of laes at a particular redshift of @xmath57 where an array of observations of laes are available .",
    "according to very recent observations , the fraction of old population in observed laes increases with decreasing redshift , whereas the escape fraction of ly@xmath0 emission becomes larger at higher redshift @xcite .",
    "it is certainly interesting and important to test whether or not our model can reproduce not only the physical properties of observed laes but also their evolution .",
    "we will present the properties of simulated laes at various redshifts in a forthcoming paper ( shimizu et al .",
    "2011 in prep ) .",
    "we will also study the epoch of hydrogen reionization using our theoretical model .",
    "we are grateful to m. ouchi , y. matsuda and t. hayashino for providing their observational datas .",

    "<S> we use very large cosmological smoothed - particle - hydrodynamics simulations to study the properties of high redshift lyman-@xmath0 emitters ( laes ) . </S>",
    "<S> we identify star - forming galaxies at @xmath1 in a cosmological volume of 100 @xmath2mpc on a side . </S>",
    "<S> we develop a phenomenological model of absorption , scattering and escape of lyman-@xmath0 photons on the assumption that the clumpiness of the inter - stellar medium in a galaxy is correlated with the larger scale substructure richness . the radiative transfer effect proposed by @xcite </S>",
    "<S> allows a large fraction of lyman-@xmath0 photons to escape from a clumpy galaxy even if it contains a substantial amount of dust . </S>",
    "<S> our model reproduces , for the first time , all of the following observed properties of laes at @xmath1 : the angular correlation function , ultra - violet and lyman-@xmath0 luminosity functions , and the equivalent width distribution . a simple model that takes only dust absorption into account fails in matching the observational data , suggesting that the kind of effect we consider is needed . </S>",
    "<S> our model also predicts a bimodal age distribution for laes . </S>",
    "<S> there are old , massive and dusty laes , similar to recently found high redshift laes . </S>",
    "<S> the large laes have escape fractions of lyman-@xmath0 photons of @xmath3 .    </S>",
