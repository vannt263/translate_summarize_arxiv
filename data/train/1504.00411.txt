    "when an assembly of particles are placed in an asymmetric potential , a net dc particle flow can arise due to a ratchet effect that occurs when an ac drive is applied or when the substrate is periodically switched on and off in the presence of a thermal bath @xcite .",
    "ratchet effects on asymmetric substrates have been extensively studied in colloidal systems @xcite , granular matter @xcite , and polymers @xcite .",
    "ratchet effects also appear in ac - driven vortices in type - ii superconductors in the presence of an asymmetric substrate @xcite , such as a quasi - one - dimensional periodic array produced by asymmetrically modulating the sample thickness @xcite , etching funnel - shaped channels for vortex flow @xcite , introducing asymmetry to the sample edges @xcite , or adding periodic pinning arrays in which the individual pinning sites have some form of intrinsic asymmetry @xcite . at lower vortex densities when collective interactions between vortices are weak , the ratchet effect produces a dc flow of vortices in the easy flow direction of the asymmetric substrate ; however , when collective effects are present it is possible to have reversals of the ratchet effect where for one set of parameters the vortices move in the easy direction while for another set of parameters they move in the hard direction @xcite .",

    "@xcite first studied vortex ratchet effects for random gradient array pinning geometries and found that the vortices undergo a net dc flow in the easy direction .",

    "the enhancement results both from the natural density gradient formed by the vortices as they enter the sample from the edges and form a bean state , and from the preservation of local six - fold ordering in the conf array @xcite .",
    "the suppression of easy vortex flow channels which arise in periodic and random arrays by the arching conformal structure also plays a role in the enhancement . only at the integer matching fields do the periodic pinning arrays produce higher critical currents than the conf array @xcite .",
    "subsequent experimental studies confirmed that the conf array produces enhanced pinning over a wide range of fields compared to uniform periodic pinning or uniform random pinning arrangements @xcite .",

    "there have also been studies of hyperbolic - tesselation arrays which have a gradient in the pinning density @xcite .",
    "since conformal pinning arrays have an intrinsic asymmetry , it is natural to ask whether a ratchet effect can occur under application of an ac drive , and if so , whether this ratchet effect would be enhanced compared to other pinning array geometries with density gradients , or whether ratchet reversals could be possible . in fig .

    "the enhanced effectiveness of the conformal ratchet results in part from the fact that the pinning sites in the low density portion of the array are widely spaced not only parallel to but also perpendicular to the net pinning gradient direction , permitting the easy flow of interstitial vortices through the sparse portion of the array .",
    "in contrast , for the square pinning array with a gradient , the perpendicular distance between pinning sites is constant throughout the array , producing the same barrier for interstitial motion in both the sparse and dense portions of the array and reducing the relative magnitude of the ratchet effect for fields at which interstitial vortices are present . for the random pinning array with a gradient , channels of easy vortex flow form for driving in either direction , significantly reducing the effective asymmetry of the array .",
    "we find that the conformal array exhibits a series of vortex ratchet reversals as a function of vortex density , ac drive amplitude , and pinning strength , and we show that the direction of the ratchet is determined by the amount of order present in the vortex lattice at different phases of the ac driving cycle . finally , we demonstrate that the conformal array also produces a larger ratchet effect compared to square and random pinning arrays with a gradient in systems of colloidal particles , suggesting that pronounced ratchet effects should be a general feature of particles moving over conformal arrays .",
