    "in most plasmas , the forces acting on the ions are different from those acting on the electrons , so naively one would expect one species to be transported faster than the other , by diffusion or convection or some other process .",
    "if such differential transport has a divergence , then it will result in a change of the charge density , which will in turn create an electric field that will alter the transport of one or both species in such a way that they become equal . in astrophysics , _ ambipolar diffusion _ refers specifically to the decoupling of neutral particles from plasma .",
    "the neutral particles in this case are mostly hydrogen molecules in a cloud , and the plasma is composed of ions ( mostly protons ) and electrons , which are tied to the interstellar magnetic field .",
    "nejad - asghar ( 2007 ) has recently made the assumption that the molecular cloud is initially an uniform ensemble which then fragments due to thermal instability .",
    "he finds that ambipolar drift heating is inversely proportional to density and its value , in outer parts of the cloud , can be significantly larger than the average heating rates of cosmic rays and turbulent motions .",
    "his results show that the isobaric thermal instability can occur in outer regions of the cloud . the rapid growth of thermal instability results a strong density imbalance between the cloud and the low - density surroundings ; therefore it may produce the cloud fragmentation and formation of the condensations .",
    "many authors have developed computer codes that attempt to model ambipolar diffusion .",
    "black & scott  ( 1982 ) used a two - dimensional , deformable - grid algorithm to follow the collapse of isothermal , non - rotating magnetized cloud .",
    "the three - dimensional work of maclow et al .",
    "( 1995 ) treats the two - fluid model in a version of the zeus magnetohydrodynamic code .",
    "an algorithm capable of using the smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) to implement the ambipolar diffusion in a fully three - dimensional , self - gravitating system was developed by hosking & whitworth ( 2004 ) .",
    "they described the sph implementation of two - fluid technique that was tested by modeling the evolution of a dense core , which is initially thermally supercritical but magnetically subcritical .",
    "nejad - asghar & molteni ( 2007 ) have recently optimized the two - fluid sph implementation to test the pioneer works on the behavior of the ambipolar diffusion in an isothermal self - gravitating molecular layer .    in this paper",
    ", we include the sph equivalent of the energy equation , which follows from the first law of thermodynamics . here , we include the ambipolar drift heating rate in the net cooling function , and we investigate the thermal phases in the self - gravitating magnetized molecular layer . for this purpose ,",
    "the two - fluid sph technique and its algorithm are given in section  2 .",
    "section  3 devotes to the basic equations of the one dimensional molecular layer and its evolution by sph .",
    "the summary and conclusion are presented in section  4 .",
    "in two - fluid sph technique of hosking & whitworth ( 2004 ) , the initial sph particles represent by two sets of _ molecular particles _ : magnetized ion sph particles and non - magnetized neutral sph particles . in this method , for each sph particle we must create two separate neighbor lists : one for neighbors of the same species and another for those of different species .",
    "consequently , each particle has two different smoothing lengths . in the following sections we refer to neutral particles as @xmath0 and @xmath1 , and ion particles as @xmath2 and @xmath3",
    "; the subscripts @xmath4 and @xmath5 refer to both ions and neutral particles .",
    "we adopt the usual smoothing spline - based kernel ( monaghan & lattanzio 1985 ) and apply the symmetrized form proposed by hernquist & katz ( 1989 ) @xmath6 where @xmath7 , @xmath8 are positions of the particles @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively .",
    "@xmath9 is the smoothing length of particle @xmath4 when considering neighbors of kind @xmath5 .",
    "we update the adaptive smoothing length according to the octal - tree based nearest neighbor search algorithm ( nns ) .",
    "the exact fraction of the total fluid that is ionized depends upon many factors ( e.g. the neutral density , the cosmic ray ionization rate , how efficiently ionized metals are depleted on to dust grains ) .",
    "here , we use the expression employed by fiedler & mouschovias ( 1992 ) , which states that for @xmath10 , @xmath11 where in standard ionized equilibrium state , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are valid . in reality , the gas in this case is very weakly ionized , thus , we adopt the approximation @xmath14 in fluid equations . in this case , the molecular cloud is considered as global neutral which consists of a mixture of atomic and molecular hydrogen ( with mass fraction @xmath15 ) , helium ( with mass fraction @xmath16 ) , and traces of @xmath17 and other rare molecules , thus , the mean molecular weight is given by @xmath18 .",
    "the neutral density in place of neutral particles is estimated via usual summation over neighboring neutral particles @xmath19 while in place of ions , @xmath20 , is given by interpolation technique from the values of the nearest neighbors .",
    "the ion density is evaluated via equation ( [ ionden ] ) as follows @xmath21 for both places of ions and neutral particles . according to this new ion density ,",
    "we update the mass of ion @xmath2 as @xmath22 in each time step so that the usual summation law @xmath23 for ions might being appropriate .",
    "the sph form of the drift velocity of ion particle @xmath2 is given by hosking & whitworth ( 2004 ) as @xmath24.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 is the artificial viscosity between ion particles @xmath2 and @xmath3 @xmath26 where @xmath27 is an average density , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the coefficients , @xmath30 is the mean sound speed , and @xmath31 is defined as its usual form @xmath32 with @xmath33 .",
    "nejad - asghar , khesali & soltani ( 2008 ) has recently considered the coefficients in the monaghan s standard artificial viscosity as time variable , and a restriction on them is proposed such that avoiding the undesired effects in the subsonic regions . here",
    ", we use the monaghan s standard artificial viscosity , since the cloud contraction is quasi - hydrostatic and there is not supersonic motions and shock formation during this contraction .",
    "it is better to keep in mind the second golden rule of sph which is to rewrite formulae with the density inside operators ( monaghan  1992 ) . in this case , the drift velocity is interpolated as @xmath34,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where two extra density terms are introduced , one outside and one inside the summation sign .",
    "this comes as a result of the approximation to the volume integral needed to perform function interpolation ( nejad - asghar & molteni  2007 )",
    ".    there is no analytical expression that allows to calculate the value of drift velocity of the neutral particles . here",
    ", we use the interpolation technique that starts at the nearest neighbor , then add a sequence of decreasing corrections , as information from other neighbors is incorporated ( e.g. , press et al .",
    "these drift velocities at neutral places are used to estimate the drag acceleration @xmath35 instead the method of hosking & whitworth ( 2004 ) who used the expression of monaghan & kocharayan  ( 1995 ) . in the usual symmetric form , the self - gravitating sph acceleration equation for neutral particle",
    "@xmath0 is @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the gravitational acceleration of particle @xmath0 .",
    "the ion momentum equation assuming instantaneous velocity update so that we have @xmath38 where the first term on the right - hand side gives the neutral velocity field at the ion particle @xmath2 , calculated using a standard sph approximation .",
    "finally , the magnetic induction equation in sph is @xmath39 where the usual notation is used .    in ambipolar diffusion process , the ion particles are physically diffused through the neutral fluid , thus , the ions will be bared in the boundary regions of the cloud ( i.e. without any neutral particles in their neighbors ) .",
    "we check the position of ions before making a tree and nearest neighbor search , so that we send out the bared ion particles in the boundary regions of the simulation at next time - step . both the cloud and boundary regions contain ion and neutral particles .",
    "we set up boundary particles ( @xmath40 up and down in @xmath41 ) using the linear extrapolation approach ( from the values of the inner particles ) to attribute the appropriate drift velocity , drag acceleration , pressure acceleration , and the magnetic induction rate to the boundary particles .",
    "the algorithm of the two - fluid sph for simulation of thermal phases in a one dimensional molecular cloud is shown in fig .",
    "[ algor ] .",
    "we write the continuity equation of neutral part as its common form @xmath42 while , the relation ( [ ionden ] ) is used to determine the ion density wherever it is required in the two - fluid equations .",
    "the momentum equation of neutral part then becomes @xmath43 where the gravitational acceleration @xmath44 obeys the poisson s equation @xmath45 and the pressure is given by the ideal gas equation of state @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the mass of hydrogen atom and the temperature @xmath48 is approximated the same as for both neutral and ion fluids ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "the thermal energy per unit mass is @xmath50 where the mean internal ( rotation and vibration ) energy of an @xmath51 molecule is included .",
    "the energy equation follows from the first law of thermodynamics , that is @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the net cooling function @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the heating rates due to cosmic rays and ambipolar diffusion , respectively , and @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the parameters for the gas cooling function that here we use the polynomial fitting functions , outlined by nejad - asghar  ( 2007 ) , as follows @xmath59 @xmath60 where @xmath61 .    the magnetic fields are directly evolved by charged fluid component , as follows : @xmath62 where the last term outlines the ambipolar diffusion effect with drift velocity , @xmath63 which is obtained by assumption that the pressure and gravitational force on the charged fluid component are negligible compared to the lorentz force because of the low ionization fraction .",
