    "the galactic rotation curve has been determined for the inner parts of the galactic disk , interior to the solar annulus , from hi - measurements using the tangential point method ( burton & gordon 1978 ) , whereas the outer rotation curve has been determined using radial velocities of objects with individually known distances , e.g.  ob stars ( fich et al .",

    "in the fk5 system the velocities of the stars have a component of rigid rotation due to the motion of the lsr around the galactic centre .",
    "assuming now that the stars move on circular orbits around the galactic centre and that the rotation curve is flat , one may fit a model of the form @xmath18 to the space velocities of the stars . @xmath19 and",
    "@xmath20 correspond to the directions of the @xmath9- and @xmath10-axis of fig.[xyz ] and denote the space velocities of the stars which have been corrected for the solar motion with respect to the lsr ( cf .  section [ solar motion ] ) .",
    "@xmath21 is the distance of the sun from the galactic centre which we assume as 8.5kpc throughout the present study , @xmath22 denotes the galactic azimuthal angle of a star .",
    "since some of the stars are fairly distant from the sun we do not use oort s approximation but adopt rigorous formulae describing a flat rotation curve .",
    "deviations of the stars from the midplane are ignored .    from a @xmath23-fit of eq.([model ] ) to the space velocities of the 197 ob stars we find @xmath24 for the angular velocity of the lsr which corresponds to a circular velocity of 223@xmath2514km / s in good agreement with the iau 1985 value of 220km / s .    from the data of the 144 cepheids we obtain @xmath26 in good agreement with the ob stars .",
    "the estimated error of @xmath27 has been calculated from the errors given individually for the proper motions of each star in the ppm catalogue and the errors of the radial velocities and the distances given in our reference lists .",
    "furthermore we took into account the velocity dispersion of the stars relative to the circular orbits by an additional error of 6.5km / s in both velocity components for the ob stars ( brand & blitz 1993 ) and of 13km / s in the u- and 9km / s in the v - direction for the cepheids ( pont et al .",
    "1994 ) , respectively .",
    "judging from the numerical value of @xmath23 and the statistical distribution of the velocity residuals we found that the error estimates obtained this way were too low and have increased the errors of the proper motions by 30% .",
    "this is apparently due to systematic errors of the proper motions in the ppm catalogue defined in the reference frame of the fk5 system , which are not fully represented by the individual errors given there .",
    "moreover there is a further source of potentially serious errors of the proper motions which is related to non - physical global rotations of the reference system .",
    "there is now a general agreement that the iau ( 1976 ) value of the constant of precession , proposed by fricke ( 1977 ) and used in the construction of the fk5 , has to be corrected by about @xmath28mas / a ( williams et al .  1994 ) .",
    "this corresponds to a rigid rotation with a spin vector pointing to the ecliptical pole .",
    "the immediate effects on our results are illustrated in table [ precession ] .",
    "to each star the correction has been applied and both data sets have been reduced again according to the procedure described above .",
    "@xmath27 is again the angular velocity of the lsr wiht respect to the galactic centre . @xmath29 and @xmath30 are angular velocities of the mean rotation of all stars about axes lying in the galactic plane , pointing towards the galactic centre ( @xmath31 ) and the direction of galactic rotation ( @xmath32 ) , respectively .",
    "as can be seen from table [ precession ] the introduction of the correction of the constant of precession leads to an unacceptably large apparent tilting of the galactic plane . following fricke ( 1977 )",
    "we have therefore considered a simultaneous correction of the motion of the vernal equinox @xmath33 .",
    "this corresponds to a rigid rotation of the reference frame about an axis pointing towards the celestial pole .",
    "table [ precession ] shows that the apparent tilting of the galactic plane can be minimized by adopting a value of @xmath34mas / a for the ob stars or of @xmath35mas / a for the cepheids .",
    "nevertheless the remaining tilting is significantly higher than in the case where no correction at all was applied , i.e.  0.35mas / a for ob stars with distances greater than 800pc and 1.10mas / a for cepheids . in all these cases",
    "@xmath27 agrees within 1mas / a with the values given above .",
    "this discrepancy can not be solved on the basis of the present material .",
    "the corrections @xmath33 of the motion of the equinox suggested here are of the same order of magnitude as those proposed by miyamoto and sma ( 1993 ) and by wielen ( unpublished ) .",
    "they do not agree exactly mainly because of different samples of stars used .",
    "miyamoto and sma derived @xmath36mas / a from k giants .",
    "wielen obtained @xmath37mas / a from 512 fk5 stars which were used by fricke ( 1977 ) for deriving the constant of precession and the motion of the equinox and which were re - investigated by schwan ( 1988 ) after the fk5 was completed .",
    "we conclude that the spurious , non - physical rotations of the fk5 system seem to be in total of the order of @xmath38mas / a in each component of the rotation vector .",
    "this is consistent with the claimed accuracy of the fk5 system with respect to non - physical rotations of about @xmath39mas / a ( fricke 1977 , schwan 1988 ) .",
    "finally we note that the vla measurement of the proper motion of the sgra@xmath6 radio source in the galactic centre of @xmath40mas / a ( backer 1996 ) , implying after substraction of the peculiar velocity of the sun an angular velocity of the lsr of @xmath5mas / a , deviates only insignificantly from the values found here .      before applying eq.([model ] )",
    "the space velocities have to be corrected for the solar motion with respect to the lsr .",
    "the standard values for this motion are @xmath41km / s and @xmath42km / s ( delhaye 1965 ) .",
    "we introduced @xmath43 and @xmath44 as additional free parameters in eq.([model ] ) and checked the goodness of the fit for various combinations of @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "the results are shown in fig.[grid ] .",
    "the @xmath23-fit to the ob star data rejects the standard values of 9 and 12km / s at a 4@xmath45 confidence level , whereas the fit to the cepheid data is in good agreement with the classical values .",
    "the minimum of the numerical value of @xmath23 for the cepheids however is quite flat and the errors are larger than those for the ob stars , so we decided to use values of @xmath46km / s and @xmath47km / s , which correspond within the errors simultaneously to the minima of @xmath23 of both data sets .",
    "note that the value of @xmath44 is closely related to the asymmetric drift of the sample of stars under consideration .",
    "jahrei and wielen ( 1983 ) found @xmath48km / s relative to the youngest stars in the solar neighbourhood in close agreement with the value used here .",
    "the low value of @xmath43 reflects the apparent inward motion of stars relative to the lsr which was noted previously by fich et al .",
    "this effect is usually interpreted as an outward motion of the lsr ( blitz & spergel 1991 ) .",
    "we have determined oort s constants @xmath49 and @xmath50 using stars within a circle of 1kpc around the sun , assuming a constant radial gradient of the rotation curve near the sun . by means of a @xmath23-fit to the circular velocity @xmath51",
    "we find for the ob stars @xmath52km",
    "/ s / kpc and @xmath53km / s / kpc , which agree nicely with the flat shape of the rotation curve over larger distance intervals . the cepheids give @xmath54km / s / kpc and @xmath55km / s / kpc . obviously oort s constants only reflect the local behaviour of the rotation curve . over larger distance intervals",
    "the rotation curves show a flatter shape than one would assume from the above values .",
    "once the velocities have been corrected for the solar motion , it is straightforward to determine the circular velocity @xmath56 for according to the formula @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the distance of the star from the galactic centre",
    ". it is now no longer necessary to assume that the stars move on circular orbits around the galactic centre , because the full space velocities are used .    alternatively , assuming again circular orbits , one may derive rotation curves based solely on radial or tangential velocity components of the stars , @xmath59 where @xmath60 denotes the distance of the star from the sun , @xmath61 the radial velocity , and @xmath62 the proper motion in the direction of galactic longitude @xmath63 . both velocities have to be corrected again for the solar motion .",
    "@xmath60 is the distance of the star from the sun .",
    "the resulting rotation curves determined using either the full space velocities or deprojected radial or tangential velocity components are shown in figs.[ob1 ] to [ cep2 ] .",
    "they agree very closely and are all consistent with a flat shape of the rotation curve @xmath64 .",
    "stars with unsuitable projection angles onto the supposed circular velocities have been excluded . in the case where only radial velocity data are used stars with @xmath65 have been rejected . if only proper motion data are used stars with @xmath66 have been rejected .",
    "therefore the overlap between these two samples is small and we can not correlate directly the rotation curve derived from radial velocities with the rotation curve based on proper motions or both .    instead , we show in fig.[diff ] the deviations of circular velocities derived from the space velocities from circular velocities based solely on deprojected radial velocities of the stars illustrating again that both methods give consistent results .      the orientations of the velocity residuals after subtraction of the systematic velocity components due to a flat rotation curve from the space velocities of the stars are shown in fig.[illu ] projected onto the galactic plane .",
    "the velocity residuals are dominated by the errors of the proper motions .",
    "most of the velocity residuals can be shown to be randomly orientated with the exception of the perseus spiral arm .",
    "there is a trend of coherent motion along the spiral arm with the effect that the ob stars in the spiral arm tend to lag behind the general rotation of the disk .",
    "exactly such a behaviour is predicted by the density wave theory of spiral structure for stars recently born in the shock front of the interstellar gas included by the spiral density wave ( shu et al .",
    "this is not observed for the cepheids .",

    "<S> we present rotation curves of the galaxy based on the space - velocities of 197 ob stars and 144 classical cepheids , respectively , which range over a galactocentric distance interval of about 6 to 12kpc . </S>",
    "<S> no significant differences between these rotation curves and rotation curves based solely on radial velocities assuming circular rotation are found . </S>",
    "<S> we derive an angular velocity of the lsr of @xmath0mas / a ( ob stars ) and @xmath1mas / a ( cepheids ) , which is in agreement with the iau 1985 value of @xmath2mas / a . </S>",
    "<S> if we correct for probable rotations of the fk5 system , the corresponding angular velocities are @xmath3mas / a ( ob stars ) and @xmath4mas / a ( cepheids ) . </S>",
