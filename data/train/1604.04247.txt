    "<S> similar finite - size scaling was found in the model studied in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    to quantify number fluctuations , instead of directly detecting each bacterium ( again a difficult task ) , we binarized our images using the commonly - used otsu s method @xcite and counted , in each square roi centered at the field of view , the number of pixels @xmath34 covered by bacteria at time @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> the binarization process has the advantage of correcting for the slight differences in intensity resulting from variations of the height of bacteria or fluctuations in the overall light intensity . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , it leads to small systematic underestimates in the case of overlapping cells . </S>",
    "<S> we calculated the standard deviation @xmath36 ^ 2 \\rangle}$ ] ( all averages over time ) for square roi of various sizes . in the disordered phase </S>",
    "<S> , we find normal fluctuations @xmath37 , but in the dense , nematically - ordered phase , we estimate @xmath38 with @xmath39 @xcite , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ anomalous , giant fluctuations testifying to the presence of long - range correlations in the system ( fig .  [ fig3]c ) .     of the director fluctuations @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> the global mean director @xmath41 is aligned in the @xmath42-direction . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) log - log plot of the correlation function @xmath43 in the longitudinal direction ( along @xmath41 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the red solid line is a slope with the exponent @xmath44 just to guide the eye . ]    </S>",
    "<S> we also measured correlations of fluctuations in the director @xmath45 of the long - range nematic phase in our experiment . from the structure tensor analysis </S>",
    "<S> , we have the local director field @xmath45 and thus we can calculate the two - point correlation function @xcite of local director deviations from the global order @xmath40 , @xmath46 where @xmath41 is the global director obtained by spatially averaging @xmath45 and @xmath47 is a signed norm of @xmath48 , which is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4]a ( see the supplemental material @xcite for details ) . in the longitudinal direction along @xmath41 </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath43 decays algebraically from the cell length up to the scale where the inhomogeneities of the setup are more pronounced or the constraint @xmath49 makes @xmath43 become negative ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4]b ) . </S>",
    "<S> these algebraic correlations in fluctuations can be associated with the nambu - goldstone mode and gnf @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> a few comments are in order . </S>",
    "<S> our system can be seen as a collection of self - propelled rods without velocity reversals that align nematically . </S>",
    "<S> it should thus be compared _ a priori _ to the vicsek - style model of polar particles with nematic interactions studied in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , this model was shown to have true long - range nematic order over all numerically tested scales , as well as gnf with a scaling exponent of @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> our experimental findings are thus in full qualitative if not quantitative agreement with @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our estimate of @xmath51 is somewhat smaller , but this could be ascribed to both the limited range of accessible statistically - significant scales and/or excluded volume effects , which , after all , rule most if not all interactions in our system .    our findings , like those of ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , challenge existing theoretical works . the linear theory of ramaswamy _ et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ for active nematic phases @xcite predicts quasi long - range order in two dimensions ( _ i.e. _ an algebraic decay of nematic order to zero with increasing system size ) , and gnf with a scaling exponent of @xmath52 . at the nonlinear level </S>",
    "<S> , a perturbative renormalization group treatment has been performed for active nematics without the density field , and concluded that the linear predictions should hold @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> but , as already pointed out in refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , nonlinear effects , especially some involving the density field , could change all this .    </S>",
    "<S> regarding gnf , the value of @xmath51 in the toner - tu - ramaswamy orientationally - ordered phases is still the matter of debate , even in the case of polar flocks . </S>",
    "<S> the value predicted by toner and tu in refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , @xmath53 , may not be exact , as originally claimed @xcite , and it was only approximately confirmed numerically on the original vicsek model in refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . for ` pure ' active nematics ( apolar particles with fast velocity reversals ) , </S>",
    "<S> the latest numerical estimate of @xmath51 is again around @xmath53 @xcite , in contradiction with the linear theory . here and in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite a slightly smaller value was again found .    </S>",
    "<S> in fact , a legitimate question , raised in past works @xcite , is whether self - propelled ` rods ' constitute an entirely different class from polar flocks and active nematics . </S>",
    "<S> their globally nematic phase can be seen as the superposition of two polar systems exchanging particles at some rate . as remarked in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , this rate is low , and it defines a finite but large time / length , over which particles go in one of the two main directions defining the global nematic order . in our experiment , this length scale is certainly larger than our field of view , and thus , like in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , we are unable to probe system sizes much larger than it .    </S>",
    "<S> although the theoretical issues outlined above should still be resolved , our results provide the first unambiguous , large - scale , experimental evidence of the characteristic properties of order and fluctuations in globally - ordered homogeneous active phases predicted by the standard models of aligning self - propelled particles . in this context , </S>",
    "<S> future work will focus on obtaining better control on the density of bacteria so as to be able to study the transition to nematic order . at the biological level </S>",
    "<S> , one could speculate that the long - range correlations put forward here might provide a means to collectively probe scales far beyond the individual cell s capacity .    </S>",
