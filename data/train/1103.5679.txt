    "markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) method has become an essential tool in any study that has a complicated posterior calculation problem .",
    "various new mcmc methods have been developed in the last decades .",
    "this research focuses on an efficiency of those mcmc methods .",
    "one of a useful measure of efficiency is the ergodicity of a transition kernel of a mcmc method .",
    "there are many studies related to sufficient conditions for ergodicity : see reviews @xcite and @xcite and textbooks such as @xcite and @xcite . see @xcite and @xcite for other measure of efficiency . in",
    "a paper @xcite took a different approach to study an efficiency of mcmc methods .",
    "consider a model @xmath1 with prior distribution @xmath2 on @xmath3 .",
    "let @xmath4 be an observation from the model and write @xmath5 for its posterior distribution .",
    "mcmc generates a sequence of markov chain @xmath6 and its empirical mean tends to a posterior mean .",
    "the convergence behavior of the markov chain is important for a practical point of view .",
    "usually , foster - lyapounov type drift condition is established for fixed @xmath7 to show geometric ergodicity of the markov chain .",
    "however the construction of an efficient drift condition is technically difficult since the transition kernel has a complicated structure defined by @xmath5 and related probability measures . on the other hand ,",
    "the behavior of @xmath5 for @xmath8 is well known and it seems possible to construct a general framework to study the behavior of mcmc . therefore in theoretical and practical point of view , it seems more natural to consider asymptotics not only on @xmath6 but also on @xmath7 through @xmath8 . for that purpose ,",
    "it is natural to study the law @xmath9 as a random variable .",
    "then @xmath10 is just a random variable and it is easy to consider a convergence property with suitable metric .",
    "it was the starting point of @xcite . in that paper , we defined consistency and local consistency as a measure of good behavior of mcmc .    unfortunately , sometimes the behavior of mcmc is poor though it is geometrically ergodic .",
    "this phenomena can also be studied by the framework of @xcite . using this framework , degeneracy and local degeneracy",
    "can be defined as a measure of poor behavior of mcmc @xcite . in that paper , for cumulative link model ,",
    "usual data augmentation ( da ) method was shown to be local degenerate and for smaller number of categories , it is shown to improve the behavior by changing latent structure with marginal augmentation .",
    "thus good and bad behavior of mcmc are studied .",
    "one question still unanswered : if a method @xmath11 is local consistent and @xmath12 is local degenerate but @xmath12 requires shorter calculation time- _ which should i choose ? _ in this paper we propose a rate of convergence ( other than ergodicity ) which may be useful for the choice of methods @xmath13 like above .",
    "we define ( local ) weak consistency for mcmc . as an example",
    ", we consider a da for a simple mixture model .",
    "though this model may not be so attractive for application , it is closely related to more general model : for example , da for @xmath14 , |t|\\le t)$ ] under true model @xmath15 behaves similar to our model which is conjectured to have a rate @xmath16 .",
    "moreover , we can observe several convergence rate through the model : from @xmath17 to @xmath16 .",
    "therefore it is useful to know the properties of local weak consistency . for other practical problem",
    "see an application paper @xcite which has one convergence rate @xmath16 .",
    "more precisely , we consider a model @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a probability measure on @xmath20 with uniform prior .",
    "assume we have an i.i.d .",
    "sequence @xmath21 from above .",
    "we can construct a da strategy @xmath22 as follows :    1 .",
    "each @xmath23 , flip a coin with head probability @xmath24 .",
    "2 .   generate @xmath25 from @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the head counts and @xmath28 is the tail counts .",
    "iterate it @xmath29 from @xmath30 for certain length .",
    "the posterior distribution is approximated by @xmath31 where @xmath32 is a dirac measure .",
    "this da works quite poorly if the true proportion @xmath25 is very small .",
    "in fact , da is local degenerate for such situation and moreover , it has the rate @xmath33 : it is local @xmath33-weakly consistent and local @xmath33-strongly degenerate .",
    "this result comes from the fact that the trajectory of da tends to a path of the stochastic process defined by @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 is the fisher information matrix and @xmath37 corresponds to the scaled maximum likelihood estimator ( theorem [ gibbsweak ] ) .",
    "it is probably well recognized that the trajectory of poor behaved mcmc looks like a path of a diffusion process ( see figure [ figure ] ) .",
    "this result is the first validation for this observation .    for comparison",
    ", we will construct a local consistent mcmc in section [ em ] , which is a kind of metropolis - hastings algorithm .",
    "numerical results show that when @xmath38 is apart from @xmath0 and @xmath39 , both methods are comparable .",
    "however , for @xmath38 is close to @xmath0 or @xmath39 , the proposed method works much better than da .",
    "these properties may seem strange for harris recurrence approach , since both mcmc methods are uniformly ergodic , which means that both mcmc have good convergence properties .",
    "this indicates that in some cases , the `` local '' approach ( consistency ) can explain the behavior of the mcmc algorithm better than the `` global '' ( harris recurrence ) approach .",
    "the goal of the paper is the following :    1 .   to provide a set of sufficient conditions for weak consistency .",
    "2 .   to illustrate the difference between consistency and weak consistency . example for the simple mixture model is provided .",
    "3 .   to propose an efficient mh algorithm which uses an approximation of the posterior distribution .",
    "this method may be applicable to general mixture problems .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec2 ] we define ( local ) weak consistency and strong degeneracy with generalization of @xcite to continuous monte carlo procedure .",

    "these results are used in section [ gsm ] to show local weak consistency of da of ( [ compstateq1 ] ) . in section [ em ]",
