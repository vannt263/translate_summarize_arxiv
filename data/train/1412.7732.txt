    "the physics of diffusion and anderson localization is based on the picture that quantum particles scatter on impurities or defects of the underlying lattice structure .",
    "this represents a complex dynamical system which can be treated in practice only by some simplifying assumptions .",
    "first , we consider only independent particle of the system and average over all possible scattering effects .",
    "for the latter we introduce a static distribution by assuming that the relevant scattering processes happen only on time scales that are large in comparison to the tunneling process of the quasiparticle in the lattice",
    ".    for the diffusive regime of such a disordered system exist powerful methods , such as the nonlinear sigma model @xcite and the weak - localization approach @xcite .",
    "the latter is based on a perturbation series in powers of @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the fermi wavector and @xmath2 the mean - free path .",
    "this approach , however , is not directly applicable if @xmath3 , which is , for instance , the case for dirac fermions at the spectral nodes @xcite .",
    "the special transport properties at these nodes have attracted great interest in the context of graphene @xcite and topological insulators @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is important to develop a flexible approach which allows us to study the related physics .",
    "an alternative perturbative approach to the above mentioned methods was suggested recently , based on the idea that @xmath4 is a small parameter ( @xmath5 is the band width , @xmath6 the scattering rate ) @xcite .",
    "the scattering rate is related to the scattering time @xmath7 by @xmath8 and to the mean - free path @xmath2 by @xmath9 ( @xmath10 is the fermi velocity ) .",
    "thus , in contrast to the weak - localization approach the expansion parameter @xmath11 depends on the bandwidth rather than on the fermi wavevector @xmath1 .",
    "this approach enables us to study the regime with short mean - free path @xmath2 , where we expect anderson localization .",
    "the latter phenomenon is connected with a special type of symmetry breaking : while diffusion breaks the time - reversal invariance of the underlying microscopic system , anderson localization breaks the scaling invariance of diffusion by creating a finite scale , the localization length .",
    "this is similar to the kosterlitz - thouless transition in the xy model , where thermal fluctuations create vortex pairs whose correlation decays exponentially @xcite .",
    "this can be understood in a more formal way : in the presence of weak disorder we have diffusion , characterized by the diffusion propagator @xmath12 with diffusion coefficient @xmath13 , which has two poles @xmath14 for the wavevector @xmath15 . for anderson localization , on the other hand",
    ", one would expect the appearence of poles away from the real axis , where the distance from the latter is proportional to the inverse localization length .",
    "however , this would imply that @xmath16 is finite in the limit @xmath17 , which violates the general property @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "it was found within the strong - scattering expansion that there is only one pole that has a distance from the real axis inversely proportional to the localization length , whereas the other pole approaches the real axis with @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "this result shall be used in this paper to study the localization properties of 2d dirac fermions in the presence of strong scattering .",
    "the article is organized as follows .",
    "fundamental quantities and the model are defined in sect .",
    "[ sect : trans_prob ] . then in sect .",
    "[ sect : pert_th ] we briefly summarize the perturbation theory of ref .",
    "the three progagators of the theory are discussed for 2d dirac fermions in sects .",
    "[ sect : props ] and [ sect : g_discussion ] .",
    "these results for the propagators are used in sect .",
    "[ sect : expansion ] to show that the linked cluster expansion of the correlation function is convergent for strong scattering .",
    "finally , the results are summarized in sect .",
    "[ sect : conclusions ] .",
    "at weak scattering we expect diffusion , a behavior known from classical physics , where the mean - square displacement of a particle position grows linearly with time .",
    "this behavior is also valid for quantum systems @xcite .",
    "it provides our basic understanding for a large number of transport phenomena , such as the metallic behavior in electronic systems .",
    "starting point is the transition probability for a particle , governed by the random hamiltonian @xmath20 , to move from the site @xmath21 on a lattice to another lattice site @xmath22 within the time @xmath23 : p_rr(t)=_j , j|r , j|e^-iht|r,j|^2_d  , [ trans_prob ] where @xmath24 is the average with respect to randomly distributed disorder .",
    "the indices @xmath25 refer to different bands of the system . in the following",
    "we will focus on the specific case of the 2d dirac hamiltonian @xmath26 where @xmath27 is a random term with mean zero , and where @xmath10 is the fermi velocity .",
    "the components of the vector @xmath28 are pauli matrices . assuming a cut - off @xmath29 for the momentum",
    ", there is an effective bandwidth @xmath30 . in this case @xmath31",
    "are spinor indices .    with the expression ( [ trans_prob ] )",
    "we obtain , for instance , the mean - square displacement as @xmath32 and the diffusion coefficient as @xmath33 the time integral in the last expression can also be written in terms of the green s function as _ 0^p_rr(t ) e^-tdt = tr_2\\{g_r , r(e+i)}de [ msd1 ]  , where @xmath34 is the trace with respect to the spinor index .",
    "the one - particle green s function is defined as the resolvent @xmath35 of the hamiltonian @xmath20 , and @xmath36 describes the propagation of a particle with energy @xmath37 from the origin to a site @xmath22 .",
    "the correlation function of the green s functions with poles on different half planes is dominant , whereas the correlation function of the green s functions with poles only on one half plane is the derivative of @xmath38 with respect to @xmath37 : @xmath39 = \\sum_{r'}tr_2\\left[g_{r , r'}(e+i\\epsilon)g_{r',r}(e+i\\epsilon)\\right ] \\ .\\ ] ] therefore , more important is the other term in ( [ msd1 ] ) : tr_2  .",
    "a direct application of a perturbation theory for strong scattering would be an expansion of this expression in powers of the off - diagonal terms @xmath40 ( hopping expansion ) .",
    "however , such an expansion fails for small @xmath41 because the expansion terms diverge with @xmath42 .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that we have poles in the upper and in the lower half plane that move to the real axis for @xmath42 .",
    "it has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that this correlation of the green s functions agrees for large distances @xmath43 with the correlation function of a random - phase model , described by the expression k_rr= [ corr00 ] with c_rr= 2_rr-_j , je^i_rjh_rj , rj_j,rh^_rj,rje^-i_rj   .",
    "the brackets @xmath44 mean integration with respect to the angular variables @xmath45 , normalized by @xmath46 .",
    "these angles represent the relevant part of the disorder fluctuations , which are subject to long - range correlations of the green s functions . here",
    "it should be noticed that there is an invariance of @xmath47 with respect to a global phase change @xmath48 .",
    "moreover , we have h_rr=_0_rr+ 2i(v_fp- i|)^-1_rr  with  |=+  , [ def_h ] where @xmath49 is the scattering rate in units of @xmath50 . in the limit @xmath51",
    "the propagator @xmath52 is unitary : hh^=*1 * -4(1-)|(p^2+|^2)^-1  .",
    "[ unitary0 ] it is convenient to introduce the generating functional @xmath53 with the @xmath54 matrix @xmath55 ( @xmath56 is the number of lattice sites )",
    ". then we obtain from ( [ corr00 ] ) k_rr= = ( ( c+a)_a)|_a=0  .",
    "[ corr01 ] in the remainder of this paper we will show that for strong scattering k_rr~ g_r - r  , [ exp_decay ] where @xmath57 decays exponentially , except for a line where it is constant .",
    "we briefly recapitulate the perturbative expansion of ref .",
    "@xcite , which relies on the idea that the expression ( [ corr01 ] ) can be treated within a linked cluster expansion of @xmath58 .",
    "the latter is generated by the expansion of the determinant in eq .",
    "( [ corr00 ] ) ( c+)=e^a  with  a = tr[(*1*+g(-c+ |c ) ) ]  and   g=(*1*+a -)^-1 [ det1 ] in powers of @xmath59 around @xmath60 , where we use c_rr=2_rr-c_rr=_j , je^i_rjh_rj , rj _ r,jh^_rj,r,je^-i_r,j  [ hop1 ] and _ rr=-_j , jh_rj , rje^i(_j-_j )  . for the last expression we have chosen fixed phases @xmath61 which are uniform in @xmath22 .",
    "then a taylor expansion in the exponent of ( [ det1 ] ) yields a = tr[(*1 * -gc)]=-_l1tr  .",
    "[ expansion3 ] this can be used to expand @xmath62 in powers of @xmath63 and perform the angular integration for each expansion term .",
    "the angular integration is easy to perform , since the expansion yields products of the phase factors @xmath64 , whose integration vanishes unless the phases compensate each other in the product .",
    "then the result of the angular integration has a graphical representation in terms of random walks , whose sites are connected pairwise by the propagator @xmath65 .",
    "an equivalent representation consists of random walk whose steps are given by alternating propagators @xmath52 and @xmath65 .",
    "the sites of these walks are connected pairwise by the propagator @xmath66 .",
    "this gives us eventually graphs that consist of three types of propagators , namely @xmath52 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 , and two types of three - vertices ( cf .",
    "[ fig : props ] ) .",
    "moreover , the linked cluster expansion is based on the relation @xmath67 , where @xmath68 consists of those diagrams from the expansion of @xmath69 which are connected ( or linked ) graphs @xcite .",
    "the latter provides an expansion , where the number of terms increases exponentially with the number of propagators .",
    "then we have a convergent expansion when we can make the contribution of each propagator small .",
    "this will be discussed for 2d dirac lattice fermions with finite momentum cut - off @xmath29 in the next section .",
    "now we have to analyze the three propagators of the three - vertex expansion for 2d dirac fermions .",
    "the three - vertices contribute only a factor @xmath70 .",
    "the fourier components of the propagators @xmath52 and @xmath65 are h_k~_0 + 2i ,  h^_k~_0 - 2i  ( = k/ ) [ hs ] for @xmath71 .",
    "these propagators decay exponentially in real space on the scale @xmath6 , as explained in app .",
    "[ app : prop_h ] .",
    "this is important for the perturbation theory , since @xmath63 contributes at least one factor with an off - diagonal element of @xmath52 : c_rr=c_rr-|c_rr= _ j , je^i_rjh_rj , rj_r,jh^_rj,r,je^-i_rj ",

    "this expression contains only an off - diagonal propagator @xmath74 with @xmath75 .",
    "therefore , @xmath76 decays exponentially on the scale @xmath77 .",

    "q= ~  , [ prop_g1 ] where @xmath78 depends on the global phase difference @xmath79 .",
    "this propagator is more subtle than the propagators @xmath52 and @xmath65 .",
    "the propagator @xmath80 is invariant under a global phase shift but it is sensitive to the difference @xmath81 of two uniform phases @xmath82 and @xmath83 . in particular , the position of its poles with respect to @xmath84 depends on @xmath85 , @xmath86 : q_=-ii  . [ poles ] the corresponding poles with respect to @xmath87 are obtained by interchanging @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "it should be noticed that any function of @xmath80 in which we integrate with respect to @xmath15 does not depend on @xmath81 .",
    "this is because @xmath90 appears only as @xmath91 , where @xmath92 is the angle between @xmath93 and @xmath90 .",
    "an example of such a function is @xmath94 . in other words",
    ", the special choice of @xmath81 affects only space - dependent quantities , such as the correlation functions . on the other hand , fixing of @xmath81",
    "was only necessary to define a starting point of our perturbation expansion .",
    "this indicates that @xmath81 should be fixed by a variational procedure to optimize the leading order .",
    "according to the standard procedure in mean - field theories @xcite , this would require a global quantity , such as a free energy .",
    "the corresponding quantity in our case would be @xmath95 , which , however , does not depend on @xmath81 .",
    "therefore , @xmath81 plays a similar role as the phase angle in @xmath96symmetric models , such as the xy model @xcite .",
    "the propagator of the xy model does not depend on the phase angle , though .",
    "thus , our theory , which is defined by the three propagators @xmath52 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 , does not belong to any of the standard classes of field theory .",
    "the dependence of the propagator @xmath66 on the choice of @xmath81 is related to the fact that our system , defined by the determinant @xmath97 , is translational invariant , whereas anderson localization breaks scaling invariance by creating a finite length scale .",

    "( [ prop_g1 ] ) we consider the asymptotic case @xmath98 , where we neglect the quadratic term @xmath99 in the denominator of @xmath80 .",
