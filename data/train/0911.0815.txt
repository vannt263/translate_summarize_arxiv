    "after the experimental realization of bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) and its controlled study under different trapping conditions @xcite , there have been many interesting experiments with a cigar - shaped bec in a quasi one - dimensional ( 1d ) trap with a tight transverse confinement @xcite . along the axial direction several different types of traps have been employed : harmonic @xcite , double - well @xcite , periodic optical - lattice @xcite , and bichromatic optical - lattice @xcite traps .",
    "many novel phenomena have been predicted and observed in such quasi-1d setting . of these",
    ", the ones worth mentioning include the formation of bright @xcite , gap @xcite , and dark @xcite solitons , self - trapping @xcite and josephson oscillation @xcite .",
    "macroscopic dynamical self - trapping and josephson oscillation were predicted theoretically @xcite and observed experimentally @xcite .",
    "josephson effect was observed in super - fluid ( sf ) @xmath2he @xcite and @xmath3he @xcite .",
    "after the experimental observation of bec in a optical - lattice trap @xcite , controlled studies of josephson oscillation and self - trapping in a cigar - shaped bec seems well under control @xcite .",
    "the studies of such phenomena in a cigar - shaped bec usually employ a double - well potential @xcite . in the simplest case of such a symmetric 1d potential with the origin of the axial coordinate @xmath4 set at the trap center , under certain initial conditions ,",
    "when a bec is released with a population imbalance between two sides of @xmath5 , it executes undamped josephson oscillation on both sides of the trap center maintaining a time - averaged population imbalance equal to zero . under different initial conditions , the bec exhibits self - trapping , occupying preferably one side of the trap , thus maintaining a definite non - zero value of time - averaged population imbalance .",
    "the understanding of the transition from josephson oscillation to self - trapping and vice versa has been the topic of many recent investigations @xcite .",
    "a sf fermi gas in a double - well potential is perhaps even more interesting , nevertheless much less studied @xcite .",
    "( there have been studies of josephson oscillation of a fermi gas in a ol potential @xcite ) .",
    "such a trapped sf fermi gas gives us the unique opportunity to study the bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) to bec crossover in a two - component fermi gas under an entirely different set - up .",
    "the bcs - bec crossover can be realized by varying the attraction between the spin - half fermions forming pairs using the feshbach resonance technique . as the attraction",
    "is increased from zero , the simple bcs sf turns into a complex cooper - pair - induced strongly interacting sf and at unitarity ( when the fermi - fermi scattering length @xmath6 tends to infinity ) , it is possible for the cooper pairs to turn spontaneously into fermi dimers ( two - body bound state of fermionic atoms ) and the bcs sf turns into a bec of dimers .",
    "after the experimental realization @xcite of the bcs - bec crossover in a trapped fermi sf by varying the atomic interaction near a feshbach resonance , there have been renewed interests @xcite in the study of a fermi sf at unitarity and beyond in the bec region where we have the bec of dimers .",
    "one can thus recover the bosonic behavior in the bec limit of the crossover ( when the dimer - dimer scattering length @xmath0 tends to zero ) , while expecting new and distinct behavior in the vicinity of the unitarity regime .",
    "moreover , on the experimental front it is easier to realize a controlled bec - unitarity crossover ( bec side of the bcs - bec crossover ) of the fermi sf than the bcs - unitarity crossover ( bcs side of the bcs - bec crossover ) , as the super - fluid transition temperature in the bcs side of the crossover is very low and difficult to achieve .    here",
    "we present a unified galilean - invariant dynamical equation for the study of the bec - unitarity crossover of a cigar - shaped bec of dimers formed of fermi atoms . in the bec limit of small dimer - dimer scattering length @xmath7",
    "the present equation reduces to the usual gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation @xcite for bosons , and in the unitarity limit it yields a density - functional ( df ) equation @xcite for fermions .",
    "hence we call this equation a df gp equation for a fermi sf valid in the bec - unitarity crossover . for the study of a cigar - shaped fermi sf along the bec - unitarity crossover",
    ", we reduce the present df gp equation to a quasi-1d form and use this reduced equation to the study of the self - trapping of fermi sf in a double - well potential .",
    "this analytic development is presented in sec .",
    "this reduced equation also describes an atomic bec with repulsive atomic interaction in the bec - unitarity crossover with different numerical value(s ) of certain parameter(s ) , and hence the results of the present investigation are also applicable to the self - trapping of a repulsive bec in a double - well potential .",
    "the numerical simulation with the time - dependent quasi-1d equation for a cigar - shaped fermi sf in a symmetric double - well potential with an initial population imbalance between two wells reveals interesting features of the josephson oscillation and self - trapping across the bec - unitarity crossover . in the limit of zero nonlinearity",
    "one has ac josephson oscillation . as nonlinearity",
    "is increased by increasing the dimer - dimer scattering length or the number of particle , the josephson oscillation stops and self - trapping emerges for a double - well potential with appropriate parameters . with further increase of nonlinearity self - trapping is destroyed and the population in the two wells executes irregular oscillation . for very large nonlinearity , however , the regular josephson oscillation comes back . nevertheless , for a small number of particles , the critical nonlinearity required for one of these phenomenon may not be attained and that particular phenomenon may not be realized .",
    "( the nonlinearity actually saturates for a large value of @xmath0 and hence can not be arbitrarily increased by increasing @xmath0 as one approaches unitarity for a small number of atoms . )",
    "these features are discussed in detail in sec .",

    "[ f3 ] remain essentially valid in the 3d model .",
    "this assures us of the reliability of the present study in 1d .",
    "to summarize , we have studied the dynamical properties of a fermi sf confined in a double - well potential in the bec - unitary crossover regime . to this purpose , we have developed a nonlinear schdinger equation valid in the whole regime based on a density functional approach and on the equations of state from quantum monte carlo calculations .",
    "this equation is equivalent to the hydrodynamic equations with the quantum pressure term included . in the bec side of the crossover",
    ", it describes accurately the equilibrium and low - energy dynamical properties of the fermi sf .",
    "in particular , josephson effect has been investigated using this method @xcite and the results have been shown to agree with those obtained from the microscopic approach by solving the bogoliubov - de gennes equations @xcite .",
    "compared with the latter , the great advantage of the current approach is its mathematical simplicity .",
    "we have identified three dynamical regimes of the system : the josephson regime , the self - trapping regime and the irregular oscillation regime . for a given initial population imbalance , these regimes are accessed according to the strength of nonlinearity as schematically shown in fig .",
    "the josephson regime is always reached at either sufficiently small or sufficiently large interaction strength . for a small initial population imbalance",
    ", josephson regime may be the only regime that the system can have access to .",
    "note that the strength of nonlinearity can be increased by either increasing the number of dimers @xmath15 or the scattering length @xmath0 .",
    "it saturates as @xmath0 tends to infinity while no saturation occurs for large @xmath15 .    the quasi-1d model @xmath17 eqs .",
    "( [ eq6 ] ) and ( [ eq6x ] ) @xmath17 presented and used in the study of dynamical evolution of a fermi sf in the bec - unitarity crossover in this paper is also valid for an atomic bec with a slightly modified value for the parameter @xmath21 .",
    "hence the present results for self - trapping of a fermi sf in a double - well potential are also applicable for a repulsive atomic bec when the atomic scattering length varies from 0 to @xmath1 . however , in this case there could be practical difficulty with three - body loss in the experimental realization of the system for large scattering length .    we have also developed a simple analytical two - mode model , analogous to the much studied system of a bec in a double - well potential .",
    "we show that the properties of the system can be described by a classical hamiltonian with population imbalance and relative phase as a pair of conjugate variables .",
    "the great advantage of the two - mode model is its simplicity which makes analytical studies possible .",
    "the key parameters that characterize the two - mode model are the strength of nonlinearity and the tunneling energy .",
    "we calculated these parameters using the spatial mode function obtained by numerically solving the full time - independent nonlinear schrdionger equation . from this calculation",
    "we show that the ratio of the interaction strength and the tunneling rate can not increase indefinitely when the interaction strength increases .",
    "this explains the numerical observation that for sufficiently small initial population imbalance , the system may always stay in the josephson regime .",
    "however , care must be taken when making quantitative comparisons with numerical results .",
    "in particular , for strong nonlinearity , the two - mode model can be even qualitative incorrect .",
    "for example , this model predicts the existence of the josephson and the self - trapping regime , but not the irregular oscillation regime found in the numerical calculation , which occurs at relatively large nonlinearity and lies in the regime where the two - mode model is no longer valid .",
