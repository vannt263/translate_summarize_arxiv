    "from a phenomenological point of view , `` high @xmath0 '' superconductors are believed to differ from conventional type ii superconductors primarily because of the dramatically enhanced importance of thermal fluctuations.@xcite in an applied magnetic field @xmath5 , such thermal fluctuations are believed to melt the abrikosov vortex line lattice at a temperature @xmath3 well below the mean field @xmath4 which marks the onset of strong diamagnetism.@xcite in between @xmath3 and @xmath4 is a new vortex line liquid state .",
    "experimentally , this picture has been supported by the observation that , in high @xmath0 materials , the onset of reversible diamagnetism occurs at a temperature well above that where resistance vanishes;@xcite the separation between these temperatures increases with increasing @xmath6 . according to this picture ,",
    "the onset of diamagnetism at @xmath4 is associated with a growth in local superconducting correlations , giving rise on short length scales to a finite superconducting wavefunction @xmath7 in terms of which vortex lines can be defined .",
    "this @xmath4 marks a strong cross - over region , rather than a sharp thermodynamic transition . in the resulting vortex line liquid ,",
    "free diffusion of vortex lines gives rise to `` flux flow '' electrical resistance .",
    "the vanishing of resistance only occurs at a lower temperature when the line liquid freezes into a lattice or glass .    to investigate the effect of thermal fluctuations on phase transitions in type ii superconductors , within a numerical simulation , one of us and y .- h .",
    "li have previously introduced@xcite the three dimensional ( 3d ) uniformly frustrated xy model",
    ". simulations of this model in the isotropic coupling limit , at low vortex line density , gave the surprising result that superconducting coherence parallel to the applied magnetic field appeared to persist above the vortex line lattice melting temperature , into the vortex line liquid phase.@xcite the goal of the present work is to extend these simulations to a model with uniaxial anisotropic couplings , so as to better model the layered structure of the high @xmath0 materials .",
    "we will consider only the case where the applied magnetic field is parallel to the anisotropy axis @xmath8 .",
    "we will map out the phase diagram in the anisotropy  temperature plane , looking for the presence of parallel coherence in the vortex liquid phase and dimensional cross - over as anisotropy increases . the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section [ smodel ]",
    "we describe our model , its limits of validity , and the specific parameters of our simulations . in section [ sresults ]",
    "we give our numerical results , mapping out the phase diagram , and characterizing the nature of vortex line fluctuations . in section [ sdisc ]",
    "we discuss our results and present our conclusions .",
    "our model arises from the familiar ginzburg - landau ( gl ) free energy functional with the following additional approximations : ( @xmath9 ) the continuum is discretized to a periodic grid of sites , ( @xmath10 ) the amplitude of the superconducting wavefunction is taken to be constant outside of a vortex core ( london approximation ) , and ( @xmath11 ) the internal magnetic field @xmath12 is taken to be a spatially uniform fixed constant .",
    "these yield the hamiltonian,@xcite @xmath13=-\\sum_{\\langle ij\\rangle}j_{ij}\\cos    ( \\theta_i-\\theta_j - a_{ij } ) \\enspace , \\label{ehjj}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 is the phase angle of the wavefunction at site @xmath9 of the discrete grid , the sum is over nearest neighbor bonds @xmath15 , @xmath16 is the integral of the magnetic vector potential across the bond ( @xmath17 is the flux quantum ) , and @xmath18 or @xmath19 is the superconducting coupling in the direction of the bond .",
    "we consider here a cubic grid of sites . if we identify the discrete spacing along @xmath8 as the distance @xmath20 between copper - oxide planes , and the discrete spacing in the @xmath21 plane as representing the short length cutoff for a vortex core , given by the coherence length @xmath22 , we have @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the magnetic penetration lengths within and normal to the copper - oxide planes , respectively .",
    "we define an anisotropy parameter @xmath26 as @xmath27 note that if the coherence length along @xmath8 is larger than the interplanar spacing , @xmath28 , then one should replace @xmath20 by @xmath29 in eqs.([ej]-[eta ] ) above . in this case , since the gl free energy with anisotropic masses gives@xcite @xmath30 , we have @xmath31 and hence isotropic couplings .",
    "this isotropic model we have investigated previously.@xcite in the present paper we extend these studies to the anisotropic case @xmath32 .    in the model of eq.([ehjj ] ) spatial variations and fluctuations in the internal magnetic field are ignored , with @xmath33 a uniform constant . this should be valid provided @xmath1 is so large that the magnetic fields associated with each vortex line strongly overlap , i.e. @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the spacing between vortex lines",
    ". however @xmath1 should still be small enough that @xmath36 ( so details of the vortex cores are not important ) .",
    "the anisotropy must also be such that @xmath37 so that the josephson coupling between the planes dominates over the magnetic coupling.@xcite formally , our model corresponds to the limit of @xmath38 , keeping @xmath19 constant .",
    "for our simulations , we take the @xmath39 as fixed constants , chosen to give a particular fractional density , @xmath40 of vortex lines penetrating the @xmath21 plane .    using the model of eq.([ehjj ] ) , which is in terms of the phase angles @xmath14 , we will also study vortex line fluctuations . to locate a vortex line ,",
    "we compute the phase angle difference @xmath41 $ ] across each bond , restricting this angle to the interval @xmath42 $ ] .",
    "the circulation of these angle differences around any plaquette @xmath43 must then be @xmath44 , where @xmath45 or @xmath46 depending on the orientation of the plaquette , and a non - zero integer value of @xmath47 indicates the presence of a vortex line piercing the plaquette .",
    "computing the vorticity of each plaquette in this fashion , we can then trace out the paths of the vortex lines .    to model a particular material ,",
    "we would like to map out the phase diagram as a function of @xmath48 and magnetic field @xmath1 , for a fixed value of anisotropy @xmath26 .",
    "however , due to commensurability difficulties between the triangular vortex lattice preferred in a continuum and the discrete sites permitted by our numerical grid , different vortex line densities would form lattice structures of differing symmetry in the ground state . since we are computationally limited to a fairly coarse grid ,",
    "this would make direct comparison of systems with different @xmath1 difficult .",
    "we therefore choose to map out the phase diagram as a function of @xmath48 and anisotropy @xmath26 , for fixed @xmath1 .",
    "we can see however , using dimensional arguments , that increasing @xmath26 at fixed @xmath1 , is similar to increasing @xmath1 at fixed @xmath26 .",
    "if we measure any transition temperature @xmath0 in units of @xmath19 , then the dimensionless @xmath49 can only depend on the other dimensionless parameters of the hamiltonian ( [ ehjj ] ) , the anisotropy @xmath50 , and the vortex line density @xmath51 . since our london approximation ignores details of the vortex cores ,",
    "if we consider the continuum limit of our model , @xmath36 , we expect that @xmath49 should be at most weakly dependent@xcite on the vortex core radius @xmath22 .",
    "the only combination of @xmath26 and @xmath46 that is independent of @xmath22 is @xmath52 .",
    "thus , the dominant dependence of @xmath49 on @xmath26 and @xmath46 can only be through some function of @xmath53 .",
    "we can further argue how transition temperatures should depend on the quantity @xmath52 . in the limit of extreme anisotropy , @xmath54 , we have completely decoupled planes , and the transition temperature should be independent of @xmath26 ; thus we expect @xmath55 . in the limit of a nearly isotropic system ,",
    "@xmath56 , we expect that @xmath0 should be independent of the spacing between planes @xmath20 ; thus we expect @xmath57 .",
    "these are in fact the predictions for the melting temperature based on lindemann criterion calculations.@xcite    the cross - over from small to large @xmath26 , where the discreteness of the layering along @xmath8 becomes important and one approaches the two dimensional limit , can be estimated by the criterion @xmath58 , or , using @xmath59 , as @xmath60 using an effective elastic medium approximation to describe vortex line fluctuations in the line lattice , one can show@xcite that for @xmath61 , the dominant wavenumber @xmath62 of fluctuations at melting satisfies the condition @xmath63 , and hence the layering of the material is averaged over . for @xmath64",
    "however , the dominant wavenumber is at @xmath65 , and layering is important .",
    "some theoretical models@xcite have predicted that @xmath66 ( or equivalently @xmath67 ) will mark a dramatic change in behavior , reflecting a three dimensional to two dimensional cross - over .",
    "looking for any such cross - over behavior at @xmath66 will be one of the goals of this work .",
    "our simulations consist of standard metropolis monte carlo simulations of the hamiltonian ( [ ehjj ] ) , using periodic boundary conditions in all directions , on grid sizes @xmath68 .",
    "we use a magnetic field @xmath1 which yields a fractional density of vortex lines @xmath69 .",
    "the ground state vortex lattice , shown in fig.[f01 ] , is a nearly triangular vortex line lattice with sides of length @xmath70 in units of @xmath22 . to map out the @xmath71 phase diagram ,",
    "we have done simulations varying @xmath48 at different fixed values of @xmath26 on lattices of size @xmath72 .",
    "we have also carried out simulations of larger system sizes for the specific cases of @xmath73 , and @xmath74 .",
    "our runs are typically @xmath75 sweeps through the grid to equilibrate , followed by 128,000 sweeps to compute averages .",
    "these simulations are about 9 times longer than in our previous work.@xcite errors are estimated by a standard data blocking procedure .",
    "to test for superconducting coherence , we compute the helicity moduli @xmath76 and @xmath77 which measure the stiffness with respect to applying a net gradient ( `` twist '' ) in the phase angle of the wavefunction along directions perpendicular and parallel to the applied magnetic field.@xcite the helicity modulus in direction @xmath78 is given by the phase angle correlation    @xmath79 ^ 2\\right\\rangle , \\label{ehelicity}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath80 is the unit vector from site @xmath9 to @xmath81 .",
    "when @xmath82 is positive , the system can carry a supercurrent , and so possesses superconducting coherence in direction @xmath78 .",
    "when @xmath82 vanishes , superconducting coherence is lost .    to determine the vortex line lattice melting temperature , we compute the density  density correlation function of vortices within the same plane , @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the vorticity at site @xmath85 in the @xmath21 plane at height @xmath86 ( henceforth , we will refer to the vortices in the @xmath21 planes as the `` pancake '' vortices ) .",
    "below melting , we expect to see a periodic array of sharp bragg peaks in the @xmath87 plane . above melting",
    ", we expect to see the broad circular rings characteristic of a liquid .",
    "we also measure the specific heat per site of the system , @xmath88 , using the usual energy fluctuation formula .",
    "a peak in @xmath88 locates the temperature at which , upon cooling , there is a dramatic freezing out of thermal fluctuations and the system looses the bulk of its entropy .",
    "we will take the location of a high temperature peak ( above any phase transitions ) in @xmath88 as indicating the cross - over temperature @xmath4 where the superconducting wavefunction develops on small length scales , vortex lines become well defined objects , and one has the onset of strong diamagnetism .    in fig.[f02 ]",
    "we show our results for @xmath89 and @xmath90 for the case @xmath91 .",
    "we see that @xmath89 vanishes at a @xmath92 significantly lower than the @xmath2 where @xmath90 vanishes .",
    "we show data for heating and cooling , for three different grid sizes , @xmath72 , @xmath93 , and @xmath94 . comparing heating and cooling ,",
    "we see no appreciable hysteresis for @xmath90 .",
    "hysteresis in @xmath89 appears only for the @xmath93 system , where we failed to cool back into a lattice .",
    "there are no obvious shifts in @xmath2 or @xmath92 due to finite size effects as @xmath95 and @xmath96 are varied .",
    "we determine our estimates @xmath97 and @xmath98 by visually extrapolating the curves to zero from the inflection point that marks the onset of the high temperature tails .",
    "we have found that the size of these tails tends to decrease with increasing simulation time , as well as with system size .",
    "it is important to note that the finite @xmath92 in our model is strictly an artifact of the discretizing grid , which acts like an effective periodic pinning potential for the vortex lines . in a continuum model",
    ", one would find @xmath99 at _ all _ temperatures,@xcite as the vortex line lattice is free to slide as a whole , giving `` flux flow resistance . ''",
    "a discretizing grid removes this translational symmetry , resulting in a commensurately pinned vortex line lattice at low temperatures , with @xmath100 . for a high density of vortex lines ,",
    "it is likely that the vortex lattice remains commensurately pinned until it melts . in such a case one expects @xmath101 .",
    "however recent simulations,@xcite with a more dilute vortex line density than studied here , have claimed evidence for a depinning @xmath102 which is lower than @xmath3 , with the intermediate phase a floating vortex line lattice .",
    "it is thus important to determine the melting @xmath3 of our vortex lattice independently from our measurement of @xmath89 .    in fig.[f03 ]",
    "we show intensity plots at various temperatures of @xmath103 in the @xmath87 plane , for the @xmath93 system upon heating .",
    "looking at when the bragg peaks disappear , we estimate the melting temperature to be @xmath104 , somewhat higher than @xmath105 . to try to quantify the location of the melting transition",
    ", we now look at the heights of the bragg peaks at the reciprocal lattice vectors .",
    "we denote by @xmath106 the six , almost equal , smallest non - zero reciprocal lattice vectors . let @xmath107 be the six vectors obtained by reflecting the @xmath106 through the @xmath108 axis .",
    "since the vortex line lattice breaks this reflection symmetry of the square discretizing grid , we will have @xmath109 for the lattice phase .",
    "however , once the lattice has melted , the reflection symmetry of the grid should be restored .",
    "we can therefore define as an order parameter of the melting transition @xmath110 .",
    "normalizing by @xmath111 , and averaging over the six @xmath106 , we plot in fig.[f04 ] @xmath112 versus @xmath48 , for the three system sizes , @xmath72 , @xmath93 , and @xmath94 .",
    "@xmath112 decreases linearly over a large intermediate range of @xmath48 . from the @xmath93 system we estimate @xmath113 .",
    "note that there is a greater finite size effect and more hysteresis for @xmath112 than there is in @xmath114 .",
    "the estimate for @xmath3 tends to decrease as @xmath95 increases .",
    "our result @xmath115 suggests the presence of a floating vortex line lattice .",
    "however it remains possible that @xmath92 and @xmath3 will merge as the system size increases , due either to the finite size dependence observed in @xmath3 , or to the possibility that @xmath92 actually lies farther out in the high temperature tail of @xmath89 than we have estimated .",
    "finally , in fig.[f05 ] we show the specific heat @xmath88 .",
    "the high temperature peak in @xmath88 at @xmath116 we identify with the cross - over @xmath4 , which is thus seen to lie well above @xmath92 , @xmath3 , and @xmath2 .",
    "a suggestion of a smaller peak is seen at the lower temperature @xmath92 .    in fig.[f06 ]",
    "we show @xmath89 and @xmath90 for the case @xmath117 , for system sizes @xmath72 and @xmath93 . here",
    "the data has considerably more scatter than in fig.[f02 ] ( in general , we found it increasingly difficult to achieve good equilibration as @xmath26 increased ) .",
    "nevertheless , there again appears to be two distinct transitions , with @xmath118 .",
    "intensity plots of the structure function @xmath103 are shown in fig.[f07 ] , and the peak height differences @xmath112 in fig.[f08 ] .",
    "these suggest a melting @xmath119 . in fig.[f09 ] we show the specific heat @xmath88 .",
    "the high temperature peak at @xmath116 is again associated with @xmath4 . however , comparing with fig.[f05 ] , there is now a more clearly defined smaller peak at @xmath102 .",
    "carrying out simulations at other values of @xmath26 on a @xmath72 grid , we show in fig.[f10 ] the resulting phase diagram in the @xmath71 plane .",
    "the @xmath2 line denotes the loss of phase coherence parallel to the applied magnetic field , as measured by the vanishing of @xmath90 .",
    "the @xmath3 line denotes the melting of the vortex line lattice , as measured by the vanishing of @xmath112 .",
    "the @xmath92 line denotes the depinning of the vortex line lattice from the discretizing grid , as measured by the vanishing of @xmath120 .",
    "we see that @xmath3 coincides with @xmath92 in the @xmath56 and @xmath121 limits , but is somewhat greater than @xmath92 in the vicinity of the cross - over anisotropy @xmath122 . between @xmath3 and @xmath2",
    "we have a vortex line liquid which retains superconducting coherence in the direction parallel to the applied magnetic field . the dashed line @xmath4 locates the high temperature peak of the specific heat , and marks the cross - over from the the vortex line liquid to the normal metal .",
    "the dotted lines labeled @xmath123 will be explained at the end of the following section .",
    "thus , for @xmath124 we have the resistive normal metal with weak diamagnetism .",
    "for @xmath125 we have a vortex line liquid , with strong diamagnetism but still with resistive behavior in all directions .",
    "for @xmath126 we have a vortex line liquid with superconducting coherence parallel to @xmath12 .",
    "for @xmath127 we have an abrikosov vortex line lattice .",
    "for @xmath128 the vortex line lattice is pinned .    if we fit the lowest five data points ( those for @xmath129 ) to a power law , we find @xmath130 , @xmath131 , and @xmath132 .",
    "the results for @xmath102 and @xmath2 are in good agreement with our dimensional argument that characteristic temperatures at small @xmath26 should scale as @xmath133 .",
    "the agreement of @xmath3 with this form is much poorer . whether this reflects the inclusion of too large values of @xmath26 in the fit , or whether it reflects a poor determination of @xmath3 due to finite size effects or incomplete equilibration , remains unclear . at large @xmath26 ,",
    "all three lines approach the constant value @xmath134 , which we have found from independent simulations to be the melting temperature for an isolated two dimensional plane.@xcite    we see that @xmath4 for @xmath135 becomes independent of @xmath26 , and is located at the same temperature as the specific heat peak in the ordinary ( @xmath136 ) 2d xy model@xcite ( which lies about @xmath137 above the 2d xy kosterlitz - thouless transition at @xmath138 ) .",
    "thus , at these high temperatures , @xmath66 does indeed mark the dimensional cross - over where our three dimensional system is behaving as effectively decoupled 2d layers ; the cross - over @xmath4 is due to the proliferation of vortex - antivortex pairs within these decoupled layers . however , at lower temperatures , we see no dramatic change in behavior for @xmath92 , @xmath3 , and @xmath2 as @xmath139 is crossed .",
    "layers remain coupled , and in particular , while @xmath92 , @xmath3 , and @xmath2 appear to merge as @xmath26 increases , we continue to find @xmath140 for all @xmath135 studied",
    ".    note that in the limit of weak anisotropy , @xmath141 , @xmath2 and @xmath4 become close , as was observed in earlier isotropic simulations.@xcite however , once the anisotropy @xmath26 increases , @xmath2 falls well below @xmath4 .",
    "the transition at @xmath2 is thus clearly distinct from any mean - field - like cross - over phenomena .",
    "we will discuss this point in greater detail in the following section . using the analogy between increasing @xmath26 and increasing @xmath1 as discussed in section [ smodel ]",
    ", the increase in the width of the vortex line liquid region in fig.[f10 ] , as anisotropy increases , is in agreement with the general experimental features discussed in the introduction .",
    "we now discuss several measures of the vortex line fluctuations in our model , in order to try and clarify the nature of the phenomena at @xmath2 and @xmath4 .",
    "the first quantity we consider is @xmath142 , defined as the the total number of vortex line segments due to fluctuations in direction @xmath78 , normalized by the total number of field induced `` pancake '' vortices in the @xmath21 planes , @xmath143 .",
    "note that in computing @xmath142 , line segments are added without regard to the sign of their direction ; oppositely oriented segments do _ not _ cancel out . in figs.[f11]@xmath144 and [ f11]@xmath145",
    "we show our results for @xmath146 and @xmath147 for the two cases of @xmath91 and @xmath117 respectively .",
    "we see that in both cases , @xmath147 is at least two orders of magnitude smaller than @xmath148 in the vicinity of @xmath2 and below .",
    "thus , only transverse vortex fluctuations appear to be important at the phase transitions . only at the higher cross - over @xmath4 ,",
    "does @xmath147 start to become comparable to @xmath148 .",
    "this is consistent with our interpretation of @xmath4 as the temperature at which vortex - anitvortex pairs start to enter the @xmath21 planes .",
    "one possible explanation for the transition at @xmath2 has been proposed by nelson,@xcite in terms of the entanglement of vortex lines . if we assume , as in nelson s picture , that the transverse fluctuation of a vortex line in the liquid phase is like that of a random walk , then since @xmath148 is the net transverse fluctuation per pancake vortex , the total transverse deflection of a line in traveling down the length of the system will be @xmath149 .",
    "geometric entanglement@xcite of lines should occur when @xmath150 , or when @xmath151 .",
    "for our system with @xmath69 , this criterion gives entanglement at values of @xmath152 , @xmath153 , and @xmath154 for thicknesses",
    "@xmath155 , @xmath156 , and @xmath157 respectively . noting that @xmath148 shows no apparent dependence on @xmath96 near the transitions",
    ", we would conclude that geometric entanglement takes place noticeably _ below _",
    "@xmath2 for systems of thickness @xmath158 .",
    "it is interesting to note that in both cases fig.[f11]@xmath144 and [ f11]@xmath145 , @xmath2 appears to coincide with the point where @xmath159 .",
    "we have similarly observed this to be true at other values of @xmath26 .",
    "however we have no explanation for this coincidence .",
    "the above argument assumed that all of the vortex line fluctuations consisted of transverse motions of the magnetic field induced vortex lines .",
    "however , there is additionally the possibility of forming thermally excited closed vortex rings , which for large enough @xmath26 and temperatures low compared to @xmath4 should tend to lie between two adjacent @xmath21 planes .",
    "we now describe our algorithm to trace out the paths of vortex lines , which will allow us to measure both the distribution of such closed rings , as well as the entanglement of the field induced lines .",
    "we start by searching the plaquettes for a penetrating vortex line segment .",
    "we then trace its path into and out of subsequent unit cells of the grid .",
    "such a line can belong either to a field induced vortex line , or to a closed vortex ring .",
    "tracing the line , we measure the net displacement parallel to @xmath8 that is traveled before the line closes back upon itself .",
    "if we have a closed ring , this net displacement is zero , and we measure the perimeter of the ring @xmath160 .",
    "if we have a field induced line , then because of our periodic boundary conditions parallel to @xmath8 , this net displacement must be @xmath161 with integer @xmath162 . if @xmath163 the line closes back upon itself upon traversing the length of the system @xmath96 .",
    "for @xmath164 , the line belongs to a group of @xmath165 lines that are braided with each other .",
    "this is schematically illustrated in fig.[f12 ] .",
    "the distribution of values of @xmath165 is a measure of how geometrically entangled the field induced lines are . with this procedure ,",
    "we search through all plaquettes until all vortex line segments are found , and classified as belonging to either a ring of perimeter @xmath160 , or an entangled braid of order @xmath165 .",
    "the only complication in the above algorithm occurs when two or more vortex lines segments intersect , i.e. go in and out of the same unit cell of the grid . in this case",
    "we randomly choose which segment is connected to which . in practice",
    "this was achieved as follows .",
    "once a line was traced into a unit cell , we searched the remaining five faces in a random order to see which face the line is leaving through .",
    "once we find a line leaving , we take it to be the continuation of the line we are tracing .    in figs.[f13]@xmath144 and",
    "[ f13]@xmath145 we show our results for the distribution @xmath166 of the number of closed rings of perimeter @xmath160 per unit volume @xmath167 , for the two cases @xmath91 and @xmath117 ( we show results for cooling ; no significant hysteresis was observed comparing heating and cooling ) .",
    "plotting the logarithm of @xmath166 versus @xmath168 , we see approximately straight lines at low @xmath48 , indicating thermal activation . these lines have a change in slope in the vicinity of the melting @xmath3 , which is mild for @xmath91 , but more pronounced for @xmath117 . at the higher @xmath4 the curves saturate .",
    "we believe this is consistent with the interpretation of @xmath4 as the cross - over temperature at which , upon heating , vorticity explodes throughout the system , and superconducting order is lost on even small length scales .",
    "the saturation of @xmath166 occurs because , above @xmath4 , the distribution of ring sizes is governed more by the statistics of random intersections among the lines , rather than by energetics .",
    "note that in ref .",
    ", where only the isotropic case was studied , we incorrectly associated this explosion of vorticity , as indicated by the saturation of @xmath166 , with the transition at @xmath2 . from the phase diagram of fig.[f10 ] , we now see that this mistake was due to the proximity of @xmath4 and @xmath2 which occurs only in the isotropic limit . for anisotropic systems",
    ", @xmath2 drops below @xmath4 and lies in the region where @xmath166 is still governed by thermal activation .    from the data of figs.[f11 ] and",
    "[ f13 ] , we can now compare how much of the vortex line fluctuations is contained in the wandering of the field induced vortex lines , versus how much is contained in the thermally excited vortex rings .",
    "we show in figs.[f14]@xmath144 and [ f14]@xmath145 the total length of _ all _ vortex line fluctuations ( per pancake vortex ) , @xmath169 , and the total length contained in closed vortex rings ( per pancake vortex ) , @xmath170 , for the cases @xmath91 and @xmath117 respectively .",
    "we see that at low temperatures , rings constitute a negligible fraction of the total vortex line fluctuations . at the transition",
    "@xmath2 they are only about @xmath171 of the fluctuations for @xmath91 , and @xmath172 for @xmath117 .",
    "it thus seems that as anisotropy increases , the importance of disconnected thermally excited vortex rings decreases .",
    "it is worth noting however that ring excitations which connect to field induced lines , may still play a role in determining the wandering of the magnetic field induced lines between planes .",
    "an example is illustrated in fig.[f15 ] .",
    "such `` connected '' ring excitations , which lie between @xmath21 planes , are degrees of freedom distinct from the pancake vortices which lie within the planes . in figs.[f16]@xmath144 and",
    "[ f16]@xmath145 , we show snapshot views of vortex line configurations , at various temperatures , for the cases @xmath91 and @xmath117 , for a system of size @xmath72 .",
    "the bottom row in each figure is a view of all vortex line segments that lie between a typical pair of adjacent @xmath21 planes .",
    "a `` @xmath173 '' shaped segment in these bottom row views indicates a connected ring excitation .",
    "we see that they are present in the system at virtually all temperatures shown , however it remains unclear how , if at all , they correlate with the transitions .",
    "we turn now to consider the fluctuations of the magnetic field induced vortex lines .",
    "as mentioned in connection with our line tracing algorithm , we can classify each such line as belong to an entangled braid of @xmath165 lines , @xmath174 ( see fig.[f12 ] ) .",
    "we denote by @xmath175 the number of lines which participate in a braid of order @xmath165 , and @xmath176 is the fraction of unentangled lines . in figs.[f17]@xmath144 and [ f17]@xmath145 we plot @xmath177 versus @xmath48 for the cases @xmath91 and @xmath117 respectively .",
    "we see that upon heating , @xmath178 up to @xmath3 , throughout the vortex line lattice phase . above @xmath3 , @xmath177 starts to drop , tending to saturate to its high @xmath48 limit around @xmath2 . upon cooling",
    ", @xmath177 starts to increase at @xmath2 , and in most cases reaches a completely disentangled configuration with @xmath178 at @xmath3 .",
    "these features were found at all values of @xmath26 studied .",
    "for the thickest sample of @xmath179 at @xmath91 , however , we cool into a glassy entangled state with @xmath180 frozen below @xmath92 , as has been seen in previous isotropic simulations.@xcite from figs.[f17 ] it seems clear that the transition at @xmath2 is related to the braiding of lines .    to see this another way , we plot in figs.[f18]@xmath144 and [ f18]@xmath145 , for @xmath91 and @xmath117 respectively , the braid distribution @xmath175 versus @xmath165 , for several different temperatures near @xmath2 .",
    "we use our data for systems of size @xmath93 , which have @xmath181 lines .",
    "we see that for @xmath182 , @xmath175 is strongly peaked at small @xmath165 , decaying rapidly as @xmath165 increases .",
    "however , as @xmath2 is approached , the peak at small @xmath165 decreases and the distribution @xmath175 becomes flat and equal to unity for an increasingly wide range of intermediate @xmath165 .",
    "the transition at @xmath2 therefore seems to be associated with braids involving a macroscopically large number of lines .",
    "when @xmath183 for _ all _ @xmath165 , it indicates that a line @xmath9 which starts out at @xmath184 in the @xmath21 plane at @xmath185 , is equally likely to match onto the starting position of any other line @xmath81 , after traveling down the thickness of the system , i.e. @xmath186 is equally likely for any pair @xmath9 and @xmath81 ( see fig.[f12 ] ) .",
    "we may speculate that precisely this condition is achieved at @xmath2 in the limit of large system sizes , and long simulation times .",
    "an intriguing question concerning behavior in the vortex line liquid is how easily lines can cut through each other .",
    "this has important consequences for line diffusion .",
    "if lines can not cut , they can be effectively pinned by their mutual entanglements.@xcite for our system in particular , with periodic boundary conditions parallel to the magnetic field , the degree of entanglement can only change due to the cutting and reconnecting of lines . to investigate this",
    "we have computed the average number of vortex line intersections , @xmath187 , present in any instantaneous configuration of the system .",
    "an intersection is defined when two vortex lines enter and leave the same unit cell of the grid , and corresponds to vortex lines with overlapping cores .",
    "once two lines intersect , they are free to cut through each other , or even to detach and reconnect different ingoing and outgoing segments .",
    "we define the `` cutting length '' @xmath188 as the average distance ( in units of @xmath20 ) along @xmath8 between cuts of the magnetic field induced vortex lines .",
    "@xmath189 gives a crude measure of the average length over which a vortex line remains a well defined string , or equivalently a measure of the number of planes which remain correlated . in fig.[f19 ] we plot @xmath189 versus @xmath48 for the two cases @xmath91 and @xmath117 . in the phase diagram of fig.[f10 ] we show contours of constant @xmath190 , @xmath191 , @xmath192 , and @xmath193 .",
    "we see that planes are essentially uncorrelated at temperatures above the cross - over @xmath194 .",
    "however correlations grow and get large as one cools below @xmath4 towards @xmath2 .",
    "the picture presented by the contours of @xmath189 in fig.[f10 ] , combined with the behavior of @xmath177 in figs.[f17 ] and @xmath175 in figs.[f18 ] , is that intersections start to freeze out below @xmath4 , with lines becoming well defined on longer and longer length scales .",
    "this presumably will affect the time scales on which lines are able to diffuse about , with a a corresponding signature to be expected in dynamic phenomena .",
    "however the equilibrium degree of entanglement , as measured by @xmath177 and @xmath175 remains largely unchanged down to @xmath2 .",
    "below @xmath2 , the behavior of @xmath177 and @xmath175 shows that the lines start to disentangle , yet cutting is still frequent enough to change the degree of entanglement for all temperatures down to @xmath3 .",
    "below @xmath3 the lines remain either in a disentangled lattice phase , or a metastable state with a frozen degree of entanglement .",
    "we have computed the phase diagram of a fluctuating type ii superconductor in the anisotropy  temperature plane .",
    "our results are consistent with general experimental observations , that vortex lattice melting occurs well below the cross - over @xmath4 associated with the formation of local superconducting order , and that the width of this region increases with increasing magnetic field ( anisotropy ) .",
    "as was found in earlier isotropic simulations , we continue to find as anisotropy increases that there exists a finite region of the vortex line liquid which possesses superconducting behavior parallel to the applied magnetic field .",
    "such a region has not been seen in other simulations@xcite which have used a higher vortex line density , @xmath195 , @xmath196 , and @xmath197 .",
    "the transition at @xmath2 from the superconducting line liquid to the normal line liquid appears to be associated with the braiding of a macroscopically large number of the field induced vortex lines , in qualitative agreement with nelson s picture based on an analogy with the superfluid transition of two dimensional bosons.@xcite however , unlike nelson s picture , @xmath2 does not appear to decrease with increasing @xmath96 .",
    "such a possibility has been proposed by feigelman and co - workers@xcite in terms of an analogy to 2d bosons with long range interactions .",
    "recently , teanovi has proposed@xcite a mechanism for such a transition in terms of a vortex loop unbinding analog of the transition at @xmath136 .",
    "our numerical results indicate that disconnected thermally induced closed vortex rings do not appear to be playing any significant role at @xmath2 , once the anisotropy has increased enough that @xmath2 is significantly below @xmath4 .",
    "however it remains unclear whether or not vortex rings between planes , which are connected to the field induced lines ( see figs.[f15 ] and [ f16 ] ) , are important degrees of freedom .",
    "we have studied behavior as the anisotropy is increased beyond the `` 3d-2d '' cross - over , which simple dimensional analysis gave as @xmath198 .",
    "we found that this did indeed mark the cross - over from @xmath26dependent ( 3d ) behavior to @xmath26independent ( 2d ) behavior , at the high cross - over temperature @xmath4 .",
    "@xmath66 also corresponds to the region where there is the widest relative width for the floating vortex line lattice , @xmath199 .",
    "however we see no qualitative changes in critical behavior as @xmath66 is crossed . as @xmath26 increases above @xmath66 , @xmath92 , @xmath3 , and @xmath200 all",
    "approach each other , but we continue to find @xmath140 .    glazman and koshelev,@xcite by considering the effect of elastic distortions of the vortex line lattice on interplanar phase fluctuations , have argued that @xmath2 should decrease below @xmath3 , with a dependence @xmath201 , when the anisotropy increases above a value @xmath202 .",
    "frey et al.@xcite have argued that when @xmath121 , the proliferation of vortex lattice defects will create a `` supersolid '' phase , leading to @xmath203 , which again falls below @xmath3 for large enough @xmath26 .",
    "similar results were earlier proposed by feigelman et al.@xcite we were unable to equilibrate our system at such high anisotropies so as to more thoroughly check these predictions ( very large values of @xmath26 require relatively large values of @xmath95 , so that the _ total _ interplanar coupling energy remains large compared to @xmath48 ) .",
    "recently , simulations@xcite by nguyen et al .",
    ", of a vortex line model with a finite value of @xmath204 , find evidence for @xmath205 for moderate anisotropies .",
    "they find @xmath206 , scaling with the coupling between planes , in contrast to the above two theoretical predictions .",
    "they attribute the effect as due to the proliferation of closed vortex rings lying between planes , in contrast with our own findings that such rings do not exist in significant numbers .",
    "the point where their @xmath2 crosses below @xmath3 occurs at the value of anisotropy where magnetic coupling between planes starts to dominate over josephson coupling , @xmath207 .",
    "their results thus lie outside the range of validity of our infinite @xmath24 model ( see eq.([emagcoup ] ) ) .",
    "simulations by ik and stroud,@xcite on an anisotropic model in the `` lowest landau level '' approximation ( also a @xmath208 approximation ) , always find @xmath209 for all anisotropies studied .",
    "thus the possibility that parallel coherence can vanish at a _ lower _ temperature than melting , and if so the nature of the mechanism responsible , remain issues yet to be clarified numerically .",
    "finally , we have shown that the effective length over which vortex lines can be considered well defined connected objects , as measured by the distance between intersections @xmath189 , steadily increases once one cools below @xmath4 into the vortex line liquid .",
    "this is consistent with the analysis of `` non - local '' conductivity in flux transformer experiments , which indicate that correlations parallel to @xmath1 start to grow right from the onset of strong diamagnetism.@xcite nevertheless , we find that vortex line cutting remains sufficiently easy over most of the vortex line liquid region .",
    "this is illustrated by the absence of any hysteresis in the measurement of our entanglement parameter @xmath177 , for most of the temperature range @xmath210 ( recall that for our periodic boundary conditions , @xmath177 can only change value due to the cutting and reconnection of lines ) . only for @xmath91 and our thickest @xmath179 ,",
    "did we find freezing into a non - equilibrium state with finite entanglement , that sets in near @xmath3 , and saturates below @xmath92 . in earlier isotropic simulations@xcite , this",
    "freezing out of equilibrium was found to occur at a higher temperature , a little below @xmath2 .",
