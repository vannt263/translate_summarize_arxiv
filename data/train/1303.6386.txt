    "one of the very last works of anatoliy larkin@xcite was devoted to transport through ion channels of biological membranes .",
    "an ion channel may be roughly viewed as a cylindrical water - filled tube surrounded by a lipid membrane .",
    "its typical radius @xmath1 is much smaller than its length @xmath2 .",
    "the important observation with far reaching consequences , made in ref .",
    "[ ] , is that the dielectric constant of water @xmath3 is significantly larger than that of the surrounding lipid membrane @xmath4 .",
    "this defines a new length scale @xmath5 over which the electric field stays inside the channel and does not escape into the surrounding media . since @xmath6 , the ions inside the channel interact essentially through the 1d coulomb potential @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is a discontinuity of the electric field created by a unit charge .",
    "this fact dictates a significant energy barrier @xmath9 for moving a single ion through the channel .",
    "if indeed present , such a barrier would essentially impede ion transport , preventing the channel from performing its biological functions .",
    "nature removes such coulomb blocking by screening .",
    "a moving ion is screened either by mobile ions of dissociated salt@xcite , or by immobilized charged radicals attached to the walls of the channel@xcite .",
    "nevertheless , due to the peculiar nature of the long - range 1d coulomb potential , the transport barrier proportional to the channel length @xmath10 is always present .",
    "its magnitude , though , is typically suppressed@xcite down to about @xmath11 , allowing for a relatively unimpeded transport of ions .",
    "these considerations call for development of a transport theory of 1d coulomb gases . following the celebrated mapping of 1d statistical mechanics onto an effective quantum mechanics , pioneered by edwards and",
    "lenard @xcite and vaks , larkin and pikin@xcite , reference  [ ] mapped the problem onto quantum mechanics of a cosine potential ( we briefly review this mapping in sec . [ background ] ) .",
    "the ground state energy of such quantum mechanics is exactly the equilibrium pressure in the coulomb plasma .",
    "moreover the width of the lowest bloch band is a specific energy barrier for ion transport through the channel .",
    "it is instructive to notice that @xmath12 potential describes a mixture of positive , @xmath13 , and negative , @xmath14 , _ monovalent _ ions with concentration @xmath15 .",
    "one may also consider a situation when the channel is filled with a solution of dissociated _ multivalent _ salt , such as e.g. divalent cacl@xmath16 or trivalent alcl@xmath17 . in these cases",
    "the corresponding 1d statistical mechanics is mapped onto the quantum problem with a _ non - hermitian _ potential such as @xmath18 or @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "the present paper is devoted to efficient mathematical methods of treating non - hermitian quantum mechanics of this sort .",
    "our particular focus here is on a _ semiclassical _ treatment , applicable in the regime of sufficiently large salt concentration @xmath15 . in its framework",
    "the energy spectrum ( thus the pressure ) is determined by the bohr - sommerfeld quantization condition for the action of classical periodic orbits . on the other hand , the bandwidth ( and thus the transport barrier ) is given by the exponentiated action accumulated on the _ instanton _ trajectory , running through the classically forbidden part of the phase space .",
    "the traditional techniques of hermitian quantum mechanics call for finding classical and instanton trajectories by solving equations of motion in real and imaginary time and evaluating corresponding actions .",
    "this route ca nt be straightforwardly applied to non - hermitian quantum problems arising in the context of multi - valent coulomb gases . even leaving aside the technical difficulties of solving complex equations of motion , there are conceptual difficulties with identifying periodic orbits as well as the meaning of classically allowed vs. forbidden regions and with the imaginary time procedure .    in this paper",
    "we borrow from the algebraic topology methods developed in the past decades in the context of the seiberg - witten solution @xcite and its applications to integrable systems@xcite ( and many follow - up contributions ) .",
    "the central idea is to consider both coordinate @xmath20 and corresponding canonical momentum @xmath21 as _ complex _ variables .",
    "this leads to _ four_-dimensional ( 4d ) phase space .",
    "then ( complex ) energy conservation restricts the trajectories to live on 2d riemann surfaces embedded into 4d phase space .",
    "the dynamics of the system are essentially determined by the topology , i.e. genus @xmath22 , of such riemann surfaces .",
    "we show that e.g. mono- and divalent gases are described by tori , while trivalent and 4-valent lead to genus-@xmath23 surfaces , etc .",
    "the cauchy theorem and the resulting freedom to deform the integration contour in the complex space allows to avoid finding specific solutions of the equations of motion .",
    "instead one identifies the homology cycles on the riemann surface and finds the corresponding action integrals , which depend only on the topology of the cycles and not on their specific shape .",
    "for example , the cosine potential of monovalent gas leads to a torus , which obviously has two topologically distinct cycles , fig .  [",
    "fig : degeneratetorus ] . the two turn out to be related to classical and instanton actions correspondingly .",
    "the genus @xmath0 riemann surfaces admit @xmath24 topologically distinct cycles .",
    "below we identify and explain the meaning of the corresponding action integrals .",
    "the shape of the specific riemann surface depends on the parameters of the problem , e.g. salt concentration @xmath15 in our case .",
    "such parameters are called moduli of the riemann surface .",
    "it turns out that the action integrals , being functions of the moduli , satisfy closed ordinary differential equation ( ode ) of the order @xmath24 , known as the picard - fuchs equation .",
    "the actions may be found as solutions of this ode in the moduli space , rather than performing integrations over cycles on the surface .",
    "below we derive and solve picard - fuchs equations for several ( positive , negative ) ionic charge combinations , such as genus @xmath25 cases @xmath26 and genus @xmath27 cases @xmath28 .",
    "we then discuss how to connect the principal classical actions with the spectra of the corresponding quantum problem .",
    "the key observation is that in the moduli space the actions exhibit a few isolated branching points .",
    "going around such a branching point transforms the actions into their linear combinations  the @xmath29 monodromy transformation .",
    "the invariance of quantum observables under monodromy transformations dictates bohr - sommerfeld quantization for one of the principal classical actions .",
    "the remaining actions may be identified with the instanton processes , related to e.g. bloch bandwidth .",
    "statistical mechanics of 1d coulomb gases may seem to be an isolated problem , not worthy of developing an extensive mathematical apparatus .",
    "our goal here is to use it as a test - drive example , grounded into a well - posed physics problem , to develop a machinery applicable in other setups .",
    "recently the so - called @xmath30 symmetric non - hermitian quantum mechanics attracted a lot of attention for its application in active optics@xcite and open quantum systems@xcite , as well as in the description of antiferromagnetic lattices@xcite and calculating energy states in larger molecules@xcite .",
    "our examples also belong to the class of @xmath30 symmetric problems .",
    "it seems likely that the methods developed here may be applied to advance analytical understanding of a broader class of @xmath30 symmetric quantum mechanics .",
    "another context , where complexified quantum mechanics was proven to be extremely useful , is dynamics of large molecular spins@xcite .",
    "indeed functional integral representation of the spin dynamics leads naturally to the hamiltonian formulation , where the projective coordinates @xmath31 on the sphere play the role of the canonical pair@xcite .",
    "it was realized@xcite that to find instanton trajectories one has to consider @xmath32 and @xmath33 as independent complex variables , thus expanding the dynamics into 4d phase space .",
    "the riemann geometry methods seem to be well - suited to advance this subject as well .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section [ background ] we outline the relation between 1d multivalent coulomb gases and non - hermitian quantum mechanics and discuss general symmetries of the latter . in section [ numerics ] we summarize major numerical observations regarding complex spectra and band - structure for the family of hamiltonians considered here . in section [ sec : monovalent ] we illustrate the machinery of algebraic geometry on riemann surfaces for the familiar hermitian cosine potential quantum mechanics , which corresponds to the monovalent @xmath34 gas . here",
    "we introduce complexified phase space and riemann torii of constant energy ; we then derive , solve and analyze solutions of the picard - fuchs equations . in section [ sec : divalent ] we apply the developed methods for the divalent @xmath35 coulomb gas , which is also described by a genus-1 torus . in section [ sec : trivalent ] we extend the method for genus-2 example of trivalent @xmath36 gas , which exhibits some qualitatively new features .",
    "the @xmath37 and @xmath38 gases are briefly tackled in section [ sec:32 - 41 ] . in section [ sec : sw ] we outline connections to seiberg - witten theory .",
    "we conclude with a brief discussion of the results in section [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "consider a 1d gas of cations with charge @xmath39 and anions with charge @xmath40 , where @xmath41 are positive integers . by gauss s theorem , the electric field at a distance @xmath42 larger than the radius of the channel @xmath43 from a unit charge is @xmath8 . at the location of a charge @xmath44 the electric field exhibits a discontinuity @xmath45 .",
    "since all charges are integers the field is conserved modulo @xmath46 along the channel .",
    "this allows us to define the order parameter@xcite @xmath47 , which acts like an effective boundary charge @xmath48 at the two ends of the channel .",
    "the poisson equation in 1d reads @xmath49 , leading to 1d coulomb potential @xmath50 .",
    "the potential energy of the gas is thus @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the charge @xmath53 or @xmath54 of an ion at the position @xmath55 and we omit the @xmath48 boundary charges for brevity . our goal is to evaluate the grand canonical partition function of the gas in the channel of length @xmath10 @xmath56 where @xmath57 are fugacities of the two charge species .",
    "one can now introduce the charge density employing a delta - function @xmath58 $ ] .",
    "the delta - function is elevated in the exponent with the help of the auxiliary field @xmath59 .",
    "this procedure decouples all @xmath55 integrals@xcite , bringing them to the form @xmath60^n / n!=\\exp\\{f \\int\\ !",
    "dx\\ , e^{i\\sigma \\theta(x)}\\}$ ] .",
    "the interaction potential ( [ eq : potential ] ) , being inverse of the 1d laplace operator , leads to @xmath61 . as a result the partition function ( [ eq : partition ] ) is identically written as the feynman path integral , in an `` imaginary time '' @xmath42 , for the quantum mechanics with the hamiltonian @xmath62 where @xmath63 are dimensionless ion concentrations .",
    "such feynman integral is the expectation value of the evolution operator during `` time ''",
    "@xmath10 , leading to @xmath64 where @xmath65 stands for @xmath42-ordered exponent .",
    "here @xmath66 are eigenvalues of the effective hamiltonian @xmath67 and @xmath68 are its eigenvectors in the hilbert space of periodic functions @xmath69 , and finally the matrix elements are @xmath70 . the boundary charge @xmath71 plays the role of the bloch quasi - momentum and the spectrum is obviously periodic in @xmath71 with the unit period ( reflecting the fact that the integer part of the boundary charge may be screened by mobile ions and thus inconsequential ) .",
    "the pressure of the coulomb gas is its free energy per unit length @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the eigenvalue with the smallest real part . in equilibrium",
    "the system minimizes its free energy by choosing an appropriate boundary charge @xmath71 . in all cases considered below",
    "the minimum appears to be a non - polarized state of the channel , i.e. @xmath74 ( see however refs .  [ ] for exceptions to this rule ) .",
    "adiabatic charge transfer through the channel is associated with the boundary charge @xmath71 sweeping through its full period . as a result ,",
    "the ( free ) energy barrier for ion transport is [ eq : barrier ] u_0=ee_0 l _ 0 , where @xmath75 is the width of the lowest bloch band .",
    "therefore the ground state energy and the width of the lowest bloch band of the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) determine thermodynamic and transport properties of the @xmath41 coulomb gas .",
    "the rest of this paper is devoted to a semiclassical theory of the spectral properties of such hamiltonians .",
    "we start by discussing some general symmetries of the non - hermitian hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) .",
    "although the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) is non - hermitian for @xmath76 , it obeys @xmath77-symmetry @xcite . here the parity operator @xmath78 acts as @xmath79 , while the time - reversal operator @xmath80 works as complex conjugation @xmath81 .",
    "clearly the two operations combined leave the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) unchanged",
    ". one may prove @xcite that all eigenvalues of @xmath77-symmetric hamiltonians are either real , or appear in complex conjugated pairs .",
    "as shown below for positive values of concentrations @xmath82 the lowest energy band @xmath73 is entirely real , ensuring the positivity of the partition function .",
    "the higher bands @xmath66 are in general complex .",
    "it is interesting to note that , for unphysical negative concentrations @xmath83 , already the lowest band @xmath73 is complex , making the free energy ill - defined .",
    "the spectrum of the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) is invariant under shift of the coordinate @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is an arbitrary complex number . upon such transformation ( preserving the periodic boundary conditions ) the dimensionless concentrations @xmath86 renormalize as @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "notice that the combination @xmath89 remains invariant .",
    "from here one concludes that the family of hamiltonians ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) with @xmath90 are _ isospectral_@xcite .",
    "thus without loss of generality , one may pick one representative from each isospectral family .",
    "it is convenient to choose such a representative to manifestly enforce charge neutrality in the bulk reservoirs . to this end",

    "the physical reason for this symmetry is that the interior region of the long channel always preserves charge neutrality , allowing the edge regions to screen charge imbalance of the reservoirs .",
    "therefore , irrespective of the relative fugacities of cations and anions in the reservoirs , the thermodynamics of the long channel are equivalent to the one in contact with neutral reservoirs with an appropriate salt concentration @xmath15 . hereafter we restrict ourselves to the neutral hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonianiso ] ) with the single parameter @xmath15 .",
    "in this section we discuss numerical simulation of the spectrum of the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonianiso ] ) .",
    "we focus on unequal charges @xmath76 , since the case of @xmath95 reduces to the well - known hermitian cosine potential@xcite . for unequal charges",
    "the hamiltonian is non - hermitian but @xmath77-symmetric , allowing for complex eigenvalues which appear in conjugated pairs@xcite .    since the hamiltonian @xmath67 acts in the hilbert space of periodic functions , one may choose the complete basis in the form @xmath96 . in this basis",

    "to numerically calculate the energy spectrum @xmath66 we truncate the matrix at a large cutoff , after checking that a further increase in the matrix size does not change the low - energy spectrum .",
    "we left the boundary conditions `` open '' , i.e. did not change the matrix elements near the cutoff , after verifying that different boundary conditions do nt affect the result .",

    "@xmath450 aligns along the cartan generator of @xmath451 as @xmath452 , where the complex expectation value @xmath43 parameterizes the manifold of classical vacua . in the quantum theory",

    "it allows to introduce a canonically conjugated complex variable @xmath458 where one may regard @xmath459 as the coordinate and momentum on @xmath455 .",
    "the underlying supersymmetry allows to argue that @xmath460 and @xmath461 are holomorphic functions on the moduli space , safe possibly for few isolated singular points . in the uv limit @xmath237 ,",
    "one finds a one - loop correction of the form @xmath462 where @xmath463 is a dynamical scale . recall that @xmath464 in this region .",
    "therefore , when the argument of @xmath107 changes by @xmath212 , @xmath43 changes its sign and @xmath465 transforms as @xmath466 .",
    "this rule can be parameterized using the following monodromy matrix in the @xmath467 basis @xmath468    to find the spectrum of the ir theory means to compute masses of particles which are protected by supersymmetry ( so called bps dyons ) .",

    "the above relationship can be understood semiclassically ( at large @xmath107 ) by evaluating the energy functional for the uv theory on the electrically and magnetically charged configurations .",
    "the @xmath472 supersymmetry guarantees that the very same formula works at strong coupling as well .",
    "there are special loci in the @xmath107 plane where the masses vanish .",

    "one may argue that there should be at least one more singularity in addition to @xmath164 and @xmath104 .",
    "it follows from the fact that if a singularity exists at some value of @xmath473 there ought to be another one at @xmath480 .",
    "the @xmath481 symmetry , which flips the sign of @xmath107 , is a result of breaking of the global @xmath482 symmetry ( so - called r - symmetry ) of ir action .",

    "it exists on the classical level , but is broken by quantum corrections ( both perturbative and instanton ) down to the @xmath481 for @xmath483",
    ". therefore , there are at least three singularities in @xmath455 , e.g. at @xmath164 and @xmath221 .",
    "the third singular point @xmath111 corresponds to a massless dyon of unit electric and magnetic charges @xmath484 .",
    "the monodromy matrix around it can be computed employing completeness relation @xmath485 in the complex @xmath107-plane .",
    "the non - trivial realization of the sw construction is that complex variables @xmath486 , with the analytic properties deduced above , may be viewed as periods of algebraic curves ( tori ) @xmath133 , defined over the moduli space @xmath487 , with respect to some meromorphic differential @xmath488 .",
    "the simplest way to parameterize such a curve is @xmath489 where @xmath490 are complex .",
    "the above equation describes a double cover of the @xmath42-plane branched over the four points @xmath491 and @xmath492 .",
    "moreover the cover is singular any time two of these points coalesce , i.e at @xmath493 , as required .",
    "basis in the first ( co)homology of @xmath133 ( two dimensional in this case ) is given by integrals of a one - form over one - cycles .",
    "we pick the homology basis @xmath494 , fig .",
    "[ fig : degeneratetorus ] , and one - form @xmath495 ( sw differential ) such that @xmath496 to pick a proper sw differential @xmath495 , we recall that there are only two linearly independent holomorphic 1-forms on the torus up to an exact form . these two forms may be chosen as @xmath497 and @xmath498 , so @xmath499 , where @xmath500 are functions of @xmath107 only .",
    "the requirement that the period integrals reproduce correct asymptotic behavior of @xmath460 and @xmath461 at @xmath104 and @xmath164 , allows to determine @xmath500 .",
    "finally one obtains @xmath501 from here one can evaluate the periods ( [ eq : abperiods ] ) in terms of elliptic integrals . they in turn yield the entire information about bps mass spectrum ( [ eq : mcentralcharge ] ) and the prepotential ( [ eq : prepotential ] ) .",
    "close parallels to our calculations are apparent .",
    "in fact the sw construction , outlined above , essentially mirrors the @xmath34 gas calculations .",
    "the elliptic curve ( [ eq : swcurvexy ] ) is _ isogenic _ to the torus ( [ eq : riemannsurface ] ) and the two sw periods ( [ eq : abperiods ] ) are directly related to the two action integrals as @xmath502 and @xmath503 .",
    "in fact , they may be shown@xcite to satisfy _ exactly _ the same picard - fuchs equation ( [ eq : pfeq11 ] ) as our actions . therefore the two basis solutions ( [ eq : c ] ) , ( [ eq : c1 ] ) , expressible through the complete elliptic integrals of the first and second kind@xcite , are also a basis for sw periods @xmath504 .",
    "an interesting open question is whether our multivalent examples have analogs in sym theories .",
    "for example , @xmath35 case corresponding to a torus with the residual @xmath505 symmetry in the @xmath107-plane , may be related to @xmath449 theory with several fundamental hypermultiplets added .",
    "other examples , leading to @xmath27 surfaces with @xmath506 and @xmath507 symmetries may be related to certain @xmath508 sym theories with matter .",

    "etc_. these points are marked by the condition @xmath509 , which is reminiscent of wall crossing phenomena in @xmath472 theories@xcite .",
    "it is observed that moduli space @xmath455 has domains separated by walls such that when one `` crosses '' a wall the spectrum of the ir theory changes dramatically .",
    "for instance , for the @xmath449 theory at small @xmath510 there are only two states in the spectrum : monopole @xmath511 and dyon @xmath512 . however ,",
    "at large @xmath510 these particles can form bound states with higher electric charge @xmath513 for any integer @xmath514 .",
    "the wall is given by @xmath515 .",
    "in this paper we developed semiclassical treatment for a family of non - hermitian @xmath30-symmetric hamiltonians .",
    "these hamiltonians appear upon transfer - matrix mapping of 1d classical statistical mechanics of multi - valent coulomb gases onto quantum mechanics .",
    "the low - energy spectra of the hamiltonians directly translate into thermodynamic and adiabatic transport coefficients of the corresponding coulomb gases .",
    "we use methods of algebraic topology , traditionally employed in the context of the seiberg - witten theory .",
    "the main advantage of this strategy is that it allows us to avoid solving equations of motion and finding classical trajectories explicitly .",
    "the latter task is rather non - trivial ( if at all attainable ) in the 4d phase space .",
    "instead , we argue that any surface of constant energy is a 2d riemann surface with genus @xmath0 . the action along any closed trajectory ( not necessarily satisfying equations of motion ) may be written as an integer valued linear combination of @xmath24 basic periods of the surface .",
    "the latter may be found as solutions of picard - fuchs ode in the space of parameters .",
    "finally , relations between basic periods and the quantum spectra are established by considering special points in the parameter space , where the surface degenerates into genus @xmath516 singular surface .",
    "consideration of monodromy transformations in a vicinity of these points allows us to identify classical actions , quantized according to bohr - sommerfeld , as well as the instanton action , which determines the bandwidth .",
    "results obtained this way are in excellent agreement with numerical simulations in a broad range of parameters .",
    "one of the reasons for this success is that the method provides with preexponetial factors on the same footing with the exponent itself .",
    "another appealing feature of the approach is that none of our semiclassical calculations required the concept of imaginary time .",
    "in fact `` time '' ( i.e. 1d coordinate of the coulomb gas ) does not appear at all . in a sense",
    "it is substituted by evolution in the space of parameters of the hamiltonian ( moduli space ) .",
    "we expect the method to be useful in a broad class of problems which require instanton calculations in complex spaces .",

    "note that the integrals that arise at @xmath165-order and higher are divergent near the turning points ; however , they are convergent near 0 and @xmath517 and can be calculated by deforming the contours to run between these points . in writing the gamow formula above , we conjectured the overall preexponential factor of 3 rather than 2 as in the ( 1,1 ) and ( 2,1 ) cases , possibly due to the different structure of the fluctuation determinant .",
