    "platonic solids are understood here as the subset of polytopes whose vertices are generated , starting from a single point in @xmath0 , @xmath9 , by the action of a finite coxeter group .",
    "platonic polytopes are distinguished by the fact that their faces @xmath10 of any dimension @xmath2 are platonic solids of lower dimension , and that they are transformed into each other by the action of the coxeter group , i.e. , they belong to one orbit of the corresponding coxeter group .    it has been known since antiquity that there are five platonic solids in @xmath11  @xcite , namely , the regular tetrahedron , cube , octahedron , icosahedron and dodecahedron ( see fig .",
    "[ plato ] ) .",
    "the underlying coxeter groups , @xmath7 , @xmath8 . ] are @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath7 .",
    "they are the lowest - dimensional cases we consider by our method .",
    "the root systems of finite coxeter groups of any type  @xcite allow one to extend our method to higher dimensions . for @xmath15",
    ", a classification of platonic solids was done more than century ago by schlfi  @xcite . in this case , the coxeter groups are @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath6 and @xmath8 . it is also known that , in any dimension @xmath19 , there are only three such solids generated by groups of types @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , namely the simplex , the hypercube and the cross - polytope .",
    "they correspond to the regular tetrahedron , cube and octahedron in 3-dimensional space .    for every platonic solid there exists its dual , which is also a platonic solid .",
    "we describe both members of each dual pair . for @xmath9 , the dual pair of @xmath3",
    "consists of two identical solids oriented differently in space .",
    "the platonic solids of @xmath4 and @xmath5 form the dual pair . for @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 ,",
    "the dual pairs are formed by different solids .    in this paper",
    ", we derive these results by new rather simple means , using elementary decoration rules for the corresponding connected coxeter - dynkin diagrams  @xcite . we also provide a constructive method for building faces @xmath10 of dimensions @xmath2 .",
    "although we focus on polytopes of dimension @xmath20 , it is also useful to consider @xmath21 platonic solids because they occur as 2-dimensional faces of higher - dimensional polytopes .",
    "the general idea of the diagram decoration method @xcite is to consider the coxeter group @xmath22 of the simple lie algebra @xmath23 , that is , the symmetry group of a given solid , and to identify the subgroup @xmath24 that pointwise stabilizes the given face @xmath10 , and the subgroup @xmath25 , which is the symmetry group of the face @xmath10 .",
    "then we have @xmath26 since both @xmath24 and @xmath25 are generated by reflections defined by some of the simple roots of @xmath23 , it is possible , indeed convenient , to distinguish by different decoration the simple roots of the coxeter - dynkin diagram defining the reflections generating the two subgroups .",
    "the decorated diagrams allow one to identify all of the polytope faces that belong to different orbits of the corresponding coxeter groups , and to count how many times each face occurs on the polytope .",
    "nodes of the coxeter - dynkin diagram we decorate by one of the three symbols , @xmath27 , @xmath28 correspond respectively to @xmath29 , @xmath27 , @xmath30 , in @xcite and to @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath30 in   @xcite . ] , @xmath33 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , according to the rules in subsection  [ rules ] .    decorated coxeter - dynkin diagrams are a powerful method of great generality @xcite , which could be used to solve other problems , but which so far remain underused . in @xcite ,",
    "the method was used to describe voronoi and delone cells in root lattices of all simple lie algebras @xmath23 .",
    "it still has to be used to describe the voronoi and delone cells in weight lattices @xcite , and for other problems as well @xcite ...    in this paper , we use a version @xcite of the method to describe the platonic solids together with all of their faces . in dimension 4",
    ", equivalent results can be found among the entries of table  3 of  @xcite .",
    "decoration rules are recursive . starting from a seed decoration , which provides information about the vertices @xmath34 of the polytope , the procedure consists in modifying the decoration step - by - step . at each step",
    ", the modified decoration provides information about the faces of dimension greater by 1 .",
    "decoration rules are quite general and are particularly simple when applied to platonic polytopes .",
    "the same set of decorations applies to coxeter - dynkin diagrams with the same number of nodes .",
    "as the links between diagram nodes do not affect decoration rules , the links need not be drawn .",
    "only when working with a specific reflection group , the decorated diagram with all links removed is viewed superimposed on the appropriate coxeter - dynkin diagram .",
    "in general , the number of copies of the face @xmath10 , contained in a given polytope , is equal to the ratio of orders of the coxeter groups @xcite , @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the order of the corresponding reflection group .",
    "the subgroups @xmath37 and @xmath38 are read as sub - diagrams of the coxeter - dynkin diagram of @xmath23 .",
    "their nodes are identified by the appropriate decoration for @xmath10 , namely @xmath28 for reflections generating @xmath37 , and @xmath33 for @xmath38 .",
    "the symmetry group of an intersection of two faces , say @xmath39 and @xmath40 of dimensions @xmath41 and @xmath42 , respectively , is the reflection group @xmath43 generated by reflections decorated by black rhombi and appearing in the diagram of either face .",
    "see the motivating example  [ motiv ] .    or , to answer the inverse of this question : given a face , say @xmath39 , of a polytope , how many faces @xmath10 of higher dimension , @xmath44 , have @xmath39 in common ?",
    "frequently , one would want to know the number of edges originating in the same vertex , @xmath45 , or the number of faces @xmath10 meeting in an edge ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "the answer is the size of the orbit of the stabilizer @xmath47 in @xmath22 when it is acting on @xmath10 .",
    "the stabilizer is the reflection group generated by the reflections labeled by rhombi of both colours in the decorated diagram of @xmath39 .",
    "see examples  [ edgmeetver ] ,  [ facemeet ] .",
    "the well - known results of the classification of finite dimensional simple lie algebras of any rank and type @xmath48 are used here only to identify the finite reflection group @xmath22 , called the weyl group , or , equivalently , the crystallographic coxeter group . in addition .",
    "we also consider polytopes with symmetries of finite non - crystallographic coxeter groups denoted by @xmath49 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , together with their simple root diagrams .",
    ".number @xmath50 of non - zero roots of simple lie algebras @xmath23 and the orders @xmath36 of their weyl group .",
    "number of roots and the orders of the three non - crystallographic coxeter groups .

    "reflections generating the coxeter groups act in the @xmath51-dimensional real euclidean space @xmath0 spanned by the simple roots @xmath52 , according to @xmath53 that is , @xmath54 is the reflection in the hyperplane of dimension @xmath55 , containing the origin of @xmath0 , and orthogonal to the simple root @xmath56 , @xmath57 .",
    "instead of @xmath58-basis of simple roots , we use @xmath59-basis .",
    "two bases are linked by the cartan matrix @xmath60 , ( for example  @xcite ) @xmath61    the decorations described in this paper should be viewed superimposed on the appropriate coxeter - dynkin diagram . often , the same decoration applies to several diagrams .",
    "it should therefore be read in the context of that diagram when some specific information about the face of the polytope needs to be deduced from it .",
    "decoration rules for connected coxeter - dynkin diagrams are recursive .",
    "they apply to diagrams of all simple lie algebras and to any polytope generated by the corresponding coxeter group starting from a single point in @xmath0 .",
    "they can therefore be written without reference to platonic solids .    the ` grammar ' for every decoration :    * a node of the diagram can be decorated by @xmath27 , @xmath28 , or by @xmath33 . * in a diagram of @xmath51-nodes , there can be up to @xmath51 squares placed in any node . * any connected pair of nodes must not carry @xmath28 and @xmath33 side by side .",
    "assuming that a starting decoration complies with the grammar rules , the decoration describes a face of dimension equal to the number of @xmath33 in it .",
    "for dual polytopes , the same decoration refers to the face of dimensions equal to the number of @xmath28 .",
    "usually one starts from vertices , faces of 0-dimension , in which case there is no @xmath33 .",

    "2 .   change to @xmath27 each @xmath28 that became adjacent to the new @xmath33 .",
    "3 .   repeat steps ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) as long as there are any @xmath28 .",
    "the following proposition is a direct consequence of the decoration rules .",
    "a polytope has one coxeter group orbit of faces @xmath10 for every dimension @xmath2 , i.e. it is platonic , provided ( i )  the coxeter - dynkin diagram forms a connected line with no branches or loops .",
    "( ii )  the seed decoration has one square placed at either of the extreme nodes of the coxeter - dynkin diagram .",

    "that is , @xmath28 specifies reflections that generate the symmetry group @xmath38 of the dual face , while @xmath33 provides the generating reflections of the subgroup @xmath37 that stabilizes the face pointwise .",
    "the dual polytope of a platonic polytope is also platonic .",
    "specifically , we have dual pairs of platonic polytopes in @xmath0 , @xmath9 ,    @xmath63    a particular decoration that carries information about a face @xmath10 of a polytope in @xmath0 can be read as information about the face of the dual polytope , say @xmath64 .",
    "let us illustrate the decoration method on the transparent example before presenting the general rules . consider the classical platonic solids in @xmath11 .",
    "connected coxeter - dynkin diagrams of the groups , generated by three reflections , are of types @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath7 ( see corollary  [ coxdiag ] ) .",
    "we assume that diagram nodes are numbered 1,2,3 left to right , that each node represents the corresponding reflection @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 acting in @xmath11 .",

    "hence , the numbers of vertices are those of a tetrahedron for @xmath12 , a cube for @xmath13 and @xmath14 , and a icosahedron for @xmath7 .",

    "a seed decoration is often applied to several coxeter diagrams .",
    "see an example in  [ solid4dim ] . the same is true for recursive decorations that follow from the seed .",
