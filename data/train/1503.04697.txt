    "first , heisenberg in his seminal paper  @xcite noted that two non - commuting observables in quantum mechanics could not be measured with arbitrary precision .",
    "the uncertainty principle introduces a sharp distinction between quantum and classical physics .",
    "subsequently , a number of improved uncertainty relations have been provided  @xcite .",
    "the presence of uncertainty relations endows quantum mechanics with significant advantages over classical mechanics for performing different information processing tasks .",
    "various versions of uncertainty relations have been used to detect entanglement  @xcite , to classify mixedness of states  @xcite , to categorize different physical theories according to their strength of nonlocality  @xcite , and to bound information leakage in key distribution  @xcite .",
    "uncertainty relations are linked directly to the ability of quantum states to enable steering .",
    "the phenomenon of quantum steering  @xcite emerges from the epr paradox  @xcite that was first formulated for experimental realization @xcite based on the heisenberg uncertainty relation .",
    "later , steering criteria @xcite have been formulated using entropic uncertainty relations  @xcite , which reveal steering in states possessing higher order correlations @xcite . experimental demonstrations of steering have been performed beginning with the original demonstration of the epr paradox  @xcite , as well as using different settings  @xcite and loophole free arrangements  @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , there exist states such as the n@xmath0n state which fail to display steering using the existing steering criteria for higher values of @xmath1 in spite of violating bell - type inequalities  @xcite .",
    "such a feature calls for further improved steerability conditions since steering lies between entanglement and nonlocality in the hierarchy  @xcite of quantum correlations .",
    "the tightest steering inequality in discrete variable systems is obtained  @xcite through the application of the fine - grained uncertainty relation ( fur )  @xcite .",

    "we formulate a continuous variable fine - grained steering criterion , and show that this criterion is monogamous , i.e. , alice s steerability of bob to a particular state chosen randomly from the eigenstates of two incompatible observables restricts the control of bob s system by any eavesdropper . the security of one - sided device independent quantum key distribution ( 1s - diqkd ) @xcite protocols rely on demonstration of steering . here",

    "a comparison of the steering inequality derived here with the fine - grained steering inequality for discrete variables  @xcite is facilitated by using the wigner function for computing various probabilities associated with continuous variables .",
    "there exists an analogy between the measurement of spin-@xmath2 projectors and the parity operator , since the measurement outcomes for both are dichotomic .",
    "it is well known  @xcite that the wigner function expressed as an expectation value of a product of displaced parity operators can be used to derive bell - chsh inequalities  @xcite for continuous variables .",
    "here we use the wigner function formalism  @xcite to derive a steering inequality for continuous variables .",
    "we show that fine - graining leads to a novel manifestation of higher uncertainty in continuous variable systems , thereby enhancing , in principle , the key rate of a 1s - diqkd protocol .",
    "let us begin with a brief description of epr - steering by considering the following game  @xcite .",

    "he is convinced only when the correlation between his outcome @xmath6 for the measurement chosen randomly from the set @xmath7 and alice s outcome @xmath8 for the measurement chosen randomly from the set @xmath9 can not be explained by a local hidden state ( lhs ) model , _",

    "the bounds remain the same for the spin down outcome ( @xmath28 ) . using the uncertainty relation ( [ fur_dis ] ) , the inequality ( [ st_bound ] ) is bounded by @xmath29 $ ] . hence , in discrete variable systems , the shared state is steerable if the value of @xmath30 $ ] lies outside the above range  @xcite , where alice has prior knowledge of bob s measurement settings .    in continuous variable systems , bell s inequality",
    "is shown to be violated using the wigner function formalism  @xcite .",

    "similar considerations hold true for single particle quantum systems , thus making it possible to construct a fur for single systems using the wigner distribution representing the average of displaced parity measurement .",

    "we will take @xmath34 s to be real displacements in the rest of this work .",
    "the average certainty of the parity measurement outcome @xmath6 over displacements @xmath40 and @xmath34 is given by @xmath41 $ ] .",
    "as in the case of discrete variables , the average certainty here too is bounded by the minimum uncertainty states . in continuous variable systems it is well known that the coherent states @xmath42 correspond to the minimum uncertainty states in phase - space .",
    "therefore , we obtain the fine - grained bounds on @xmath41 $ ] using the coherent states .    for even parity measurement ( @xmath24 ) at the displacement chosen from @xmath43 , the average certainty becomes @xmath44 = \\langle\\gamma |\\frac{\\pi^+(\\alpha)+\\pi^+(\\beta)}{2}|\\gamma\\rangle \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\frac{1}{2 } \\big ( \\exp[-|\\gamma-\\alpha|^2 ] \\cosh[|\\gamma-\\alpha |^2 ] \\nonumber \\\\ & & +   \\exp[-|\\gamma-\\beta|^2 ] \\cosh[|\\gamma-\\beta |^2]\\big),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where , similar to the displacements @xmath34 and @xmath40 , we choose @xmath45 also to be real .",

    "note that the range of certainty in discrete variable systems given by eq.([fur_dis ] ) @xcite is higher than that in continuous variable systems . this feature reflecting",

    "n00n states @xcite are regarded to be of high utility in quantum metrology for making precise interferometric measurements .",

    "steering finds direct applicability in demonstration of security of quantum key distribution ( qkd ) . the goal of any qkd protocol is to generate a key string between two distant parties ( say , alice and bob ) such that it remains secret from an eavesdropper ( say , charlie ) . in the first qkd protocol ( bb84 ) proposed by bennett and brassard  @xcite ,",
    "security is based on the uncertainty of the outcome of incompatible spin measurements chosen randomly along @xmath82- and @xmath83-directions .",
    "the security of standard qkd protocols are based on certain idealistic assumptions @xcite that may be minimized in the so - called device independent qkd ( diqkd ) @xcite where it is no longer required to fully trust the devices used by alice and bob",
    ". however , practical and loophole free implementations of diqkd protocols are difficult since they require demonstration of nonlocality . on the other hand , 1s - diqkd @xcite protocols which are intermediate between standard qkd and diqkd protocols , rely on demonstration of quantum steering for their security .",
    "continuous variable 1s - diqkd protocols have attracted attention in recent times since they are reasonably robust to losses and practically more feasible compared to their discrete variable counterparts  @xcite .",
    "monogamy of non - local correlations certifies the security of qkd  @xcite . to develop a monogamy relation associated with the upper bound of our steering inequality  ( [ st_bound_con ] ) ,",
    "let us consider that three parties alice , bob and charlie share a tripartite state @xmath84 for which the inequality @xmath85 is satisfied , where @xmath86 and @xmath87 , and @xmath88 is charlie s outcome for the measurement chosen from the set @xmath89 .",

    "then , it is possible to find a conditional bob s state for which @xmath94 > 3/2 $ ] , which contradicts the fur given by inequality  ( [ fur_con ] ) .",
    "similarly , using the lower bound of our steering inequality  ( [ st_bound_con ] ) , one can obtain @xmath95 \\geq \\frac{1}{2}$ ] , which together with the relation ( [ mono_1 ] ) gives @xmath96 \\leq \\frac{3}{2}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the monogamy relation  ( [ mono_1 ] ) is used to bound the secret key rate in a 1s - diqkd protocol .",
    "the lower bound of the secret key rate under individual attack is given by  @xcite @xmath97 , where @xmath98 is the mutual information .",
    "suppose that the upper bound of the steering inequality  ( [ st_bound_con ] ) is violated by an amount @xmath99 , i.e. , @xmath100= \\frac{3}{4 } + \\delta$ ] , where @xmath101 .",

    "one may note here that in comparison the lower bound for discrete variables is @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "hence , the use of continuous variable systems in qkd offers more security in principle .",
    "to summarize , in the present work we first derive a fine - grained uncertainty relation ( fur ) for continuous variable systems with the help of an operational interpretation of the wigner function  @xcite .",
    "the fur provides a manifestation of higher uncertainty in continuous variable systems than in discrete variable systems , since in the former the certainty is confined to a lower range bounded by @xmath106 $ ] , compared to @xmath107 $ ] for the latter .",
    "the increment of uncertainty in continuous variable systems restricts the amount of information leakage to the eavesdropper , making them more secure in principle , than discrete variable systems .",
    "our steering inequality is hence also stronger than that of discrete variable systems , as in the latter , bob is convinced of the prepared state being entangled only when the average of the conditional probabilities is larger than @xmath108  @xcite , whereas , in continuous variable systems it is @xmath109 .",
    "further , we show that our steering inequality is capable of detecting maximal steerability by n00n states for @xmath68 , thereby circumventing a drawback of the entropic steering inequality which is not violated by the n00n state for @xmath68  @xcite .    with the help of a derived monogamy relation corresponding to our steering inequality , we bound the key rate in the 1s - diqkd protocol secured under individual attacks .",
    "the relation of the wigner function with displaced parity operators  @xcite facilitates comparison of the key rates in continuous and discrete variables .",
    "the lower bound of the secret key rate is unity for the shared maximally entangled state of continuous variables , which is double that for discrete variables  @xcite even when alice knows bob s set of observables before preparation of the state . knowing bob s set of observables",
    "does not help alice to cheat here , whereas it is indeed helpful in discrete variable systems  @xcite .",
    "the quasi - probability distributions contained in our steering inequality may be reconstructed experimentally by homodyne detection techniques that are currently realizable with high efficiency  @xcite .",
    "recent experiments  @xcite have indeed confirmed bell violation in continuous variable systems using similar techniques .",
    "it should thus be feasible to experimentally verify our steering inequality .",
    "further analysis of more general security attacks , as well as consideration of decoherence effects would be needed to assess the practical viability of such key generation protocols .",
