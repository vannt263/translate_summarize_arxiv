    "in diffractive interactions in hadron - hadron or photon - hadron collisions at least one of the beam particles emerges intact from the collision , having lost only a small fraction of its initial energy , and carrying a small transverse momentum .",
    "therefore no color is exchanged in the @xmath1-channel .",
    "the signature for such processes is the presence of a gap in rapidity between the two hadronic final states . at high energy",
    "this is described by the exchange of an object with the quantum numbers of the vacuum , referred to as the pomeron in the framework of regge phenomenology  @xcite .",
    "note that at low energies similar reactions can also proceed when quantum numbers are exchanged through subleading regge trajectories ( reggeons ) ; however , these contributions are exponentially suppressed as a function of the gap size and are negligible at small values of the longitudinal momentum loss .",
    "the understanding and description of diffractive processes is one of the aims of qcd .",
    "diffractive events are being extensively studied at hera , tevatron , rhic , jlab and cern and there is a growing community planning to continue these studies at the lhc .",
    "updates on the available experimental data and on their theoretical interpretation were given at this workshop ; many discussions also took place on the future plans . in the present summary we focus on the path from hera to the lhc through the tevatron",
    "let us first look at the diffractive reaction @xmath2 at hera , depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : f1]a : a photon of virtuality @xmath3 diffractively dissociates interacting with the proton at a center of mass energy @xmath4 and squared four momentum transfer @xmath1 and produces the hadronic system @xmath5 with mass @xmath6 in the final state .",
    "the fraction of the proton momentum carried by the exchanged object is denoted by @xmath7 , while the fraction of the momentum of the exchanged object carried by the struck quark is denoted by @xmath8 ( note that sometimes @xmath9 is used instead of @xmath8 ) .",
    "the virtual photon emitted from the lepton beam provides a point - like probe to study the structure of the diffractive exchange , similarly to ordinary dis probing proton structure .",
    "the fact that a large fraction ( @xmath10 ) of deep inelastic ( dis ) events at hera is diffractive has thus opened the possibility of investigating the partonic nature of the pomeron and has established a theoretical link between regge theory and qcd .    at the tevatron inclusive diffraction",
    "is mainly studied via the reaction @xmath11 , sketched in fig .",

    "the first is based on the measurement of the scattered proton with a spectrometer installed very close to the beam in a region with acceptance for protons which have lost only a small fraction of their initial longitudinal energy .",
    "a second method requires the presence of a large rapidity gap ( lrg ) in the forward region .",
    "a third method is based on the different shape of the @xmath6 distribution between diffractive and non diffractive events . at the tevatron",
    "diffractive interactions are selected by tagging events by either a rapidity gap or a leading antiproton  @xcite .",
    "the proton tagging method has the advantage of excluding the proton dissociation processes @xmath14 , where the proton also diffractively dissociates into a state @xmath15 of mass @xmath16 that escapes undetected into the beam pipe . in order to ensure that the scattered proton resulted from a diffractive process one requires @xmath17 .",
    "this cut removes contributions coming from reggeon exchanges  @xcite .",
    "the large rapidity gap method selects events which include some proton dissociation processes and some reggeon contributions .",
    "the latter can be removed by the same @xmath7 cut as above .",
    "if the mass @xmath16 of the dissociative system is large enough to be measured in the forward detector the proton dissociation background can be removed , whereas the contribution of low mass proton dissociation can be estimated with a monte carlo simulation ( @xmath18 of background with @xmath19  gev is quoted from the h1 analysis  @xcite ) .     and",

    "h1 and zeus have presented recent precise measurements of the diffractive structure function obtained with all three hera methods and covering a wide kinematic range ( proton tagging method :  @xcite , lrg method :  @xcite , @xmath22 method :  @xcite ) . in fig .",

    "a similar result was obtained by zeus  @xcite .",
    "however , the important uncertainties on the dpdfs discussed in the previous section make the conclusions on the validity of qcd factorization in dis rather weak .",
    "the factorization theorem does not hold in the case of diffractive hadron - hadron scattering  @xcite : indeed it has been known for years that the dpdfs extracted from hera data overestimate the rate of diffractive dijets at the tevatron by one order of magnitude  @xcite .",
    "it was shown in  @xcite that this breakdown of factorization can be explained by screening ( unitarization ) effects .",
    "in the @xmath1-channel reggeon framework , these effects are described by multi - pomeron exchange diagrams . because of the screening , the probability of rapidity gaps in high energy interactions to survive decreases since they may be populated by rescattering processes .",
    "the screening corrections are accounted for by the introduction of a suppression factor , which is often called the _ survival probability of rapidity gaps_. as shown in  @xcite and  @xcite , the current cdf diffractive dijet data , with one or two rapidity gaps , are in good quantitative agreement with the multi - pomeron - exchange model .    in photoproduction at hera ( @xmath40 )",
    ", the exchanged photon , which is real or quasi real , can either interact directly with the proton or first dissolve into partonic constituents which then scatter off the target ( resolved process ) . in the former case dijet photoproduction",
    "is described by a photon gluon fusion process . in the latter case",
    "the photon behaves like a hadron .",
    "factorization should then be valid for direct interactions as in the case of dis with large @xmath3 , whereas for the resolved contribution it is expected to fail due to rescattering corrections . in the ideal theoretical limit",
    ", the suppression factor of 0.34 is evaluated for the resolved process within the multi - pomeron exchange model  @xcite .",
    "however , in reality there is no clear model independent separation between the direct and resolved processes .",
    "in particular , the direct contribution is smeared by the experimental resolution and uncertainties .",
    "moreover , at nlo these contributions are closely related .",
    "recently klasen and kramer  @xcite have performed an analysis of diffractive dijet photoproduction data at nlo where they suppressed the resolved process by a factor  0.34 .",
    "[ fig : f8 ] shows the differential cross section , as measured by h1  @xcite , for the diffractive photoproduction of two jets as a function of @xmath41 ( the fraction of the photon momentum entering the hard scattering ) , where the nlo prediction has been tested in two different weighting schemes : in fig .",

    "the overall message from the data of figs .  [ fig : f8 ] and  [ fig : f9 ] is that , while a suppression of only the resolved contribution at nlo is disfavored by the data , a good agreement is achieved with the global suppression 0.5 , which furthermore yields a good description of all measured cross sections .",
    "the fact that the data , apparently against expectations , support suppression of direct photoproduction , has been addressed by m.  klasen  @xcite and has been related to the critical role of an initial state singularity in the way factorization breaks down and to the need of a modification of the suppression mechanism : separation of direct and resolved photoproduction events is a leading order concept . at nlo",
    "they are closely connected .",
    "the sum of both cross sections is the only physical relevant observable , which is approximately independent of the factorization scale , @xmath44  @xcite . by multiplying the resolved cross section with the suppression factor @xmath45 , the scale dependence of the nlo direct cross section",
    "is compensated against that of the lo resolved part  @xcite .",
    "but at nlo collinear singularities arise from the photon initial state , which are absorbed at the factorization scale into the photon pdfs ; the latter become in turn @xmath44 dependent . an equivalent @xmath44 dependence , just with the opposite sign ,",
    "is then left in the nlo corrections to the direct contribution .",
    "hence , in order to get a physical cross section at nlo , that is the superimposition of the nlo direct and lo resolved cross section , and to restore the scale invariance , one must multiply the @xmath44 dependent term of the nlo correction to the direct contribution with the same suppression factor as the resolved cross section .    .",

    "largely discussed previously are a further ingredient which makes it difficult a clear understanding .",
    "as was emphasized in  @xcite , a possible way to study the effects of factorization breaking due to rescattering in diffractive photoproduction is to measure the ratio of diffractive and inclusive dijet photoproduction as a function of @xmath41 .",
    "for such a quantity ( at least ) some of the theoretical and experimental uncertainties will cancel .",
    "the understanding of factorization breaking in hadron - hadron collisions is of fundamental importance for the diffractive physics at the lhc .",
    "the rapidity gap survival factor is an essential ingredient of the predictions  @xcite on exclusive diffractive higgs production , which will be discussed in the last section .",
    "as discussed in the previous section , factorization is not expected to hold in hadron - hadron collisions .",
    "a strong breakdown of factorization at the tevatron has been known for some time from run - i ( 1992 - 1995 ) results  @xcite : the single - diffractive to non - diffractive ratios for dijets , @xmath4 , @xmath48-quark and @xmath49 production , as well as the ratio of double - diffractive to non - diffractive dijet production are all @xmath50 , a factor 10 less than at hera .",
    "however , the ratio of double- to single - diffractive dijets is found to be about a factor 5 larger than the ratio of single- to non - diffractive dijets , suggesting that there is only a small extra suppression when going from one to two rapidity gaps in the event , as confirmed by predictions  @xcite . in this respect",
    "the tevatron data are being a very powerful tool to shed light on the factorization breaking mechanism .",
    "one of the major challenges of run - ii is the measurement of central exclusive production rates ( dijets , @xmath51 , diphotons ) . by central exclusive ,",
    "we refer to the process @xmath52 , where @xmath53 denotes the absence of hadronic activity ( gap ) between the outgoing hadrons and the decay products of the central system @xmath54 .",
    "as we will discuss in the last section , the exclusive higgs signal is particularly clean and the signal - to - background ratio is especially favorable , in comparison with other proposed selection modes .",
    "however , the expected number of events is low",
    ". therefore it is important to check the predictions for exclusive higgs production by studying processes mediated by the same mechanism , but with rates which are high enough to be observed at the tevatron ( as well as at the lhc )  @xcite .",
    "the cdf search for exclusive dijet production is based on the reconstruction of the dijet mass fraction @xmath55 in double pomeron exchange events .",
    "@xmath55 is defined as the mass of the two leading jets in an event divided by the total mass measured in all calorimeters . at first sight",
    ", we might expect that the exclusive dijets form a narrow peak concentrated at @xmath55 close to 1 . in reality , the peak is smeared out due to hadronization and jet searching procedure as well as due to a radiative tail phenomenon  @xcite .",
    "so it is not so surprising that within the cdf selection cuts no peak has been seen .",

    "the analysis benefits from using dijet events in which at least one of the jets is @xmath48-tagged : presently more data on heavy flavor exclusive dijets are being collected with a special @xmath48-tagged dijet trigger .     in double pomeron exchange events as a function of @xmath57 , the @xmath58 of the lower @xmath58 jet . ]",

    "the dynamics of diffractive interactions can also be studied through exclusive vector meson ( @xmath61 ) and photon production , @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is either an elastically scattered nucleon or a low - mass state dissociative system . at low transverse momentum transfer at the nucleon vertex , the photoproduction of @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath54 mesons is characterized by a `` soft '' dependence of their cross - sections in the @xmath66 center - of - mass energy , @xmath4 .",
    "this can be interpreted in the framework of regge theory as due to the exchange of a `` soft '' pomeron ( @xmath67 ) resulting in an energy dependence of the form @xmath68 , where the pomeron trajectory is parametrised as @xmath69 . however , in the presence of a `` hard '' scale like large values of the photon virtuality @xmath3or of the momentum transfer @xmath70   or of the vector meson mass , perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) is expected to apply .",
    "diffractive vector meson production can then be seen in the nucleon rest frame as a sequence of tree subprocesses well separated in time : the fluctuation of the exchanged photon in a @xmath71  pair , the hard interaction of the @xmath71  pair with the nucleon via the exchange of ( at least ) two gluons in a color singlet state , and the @xmath71  pair recombination into a real vector meson .",

    "several speakers ( albrow , cox , kowalski , piotrzkowski and royon ) discussed the unique physics potential of forward proton tagging at 420 m at the lhc .",
    "the use of forward proton detectors as a means to study standard model ( sm ) and new physics at the lhc has only been fully appreciated within the last few years , ( see e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) . by detecting protons that have lost less than 2 % of their longitudinal momentum ,",
    "a rich qcd , electroweak , higgs and bsm program becomes accessible , with a potential to study phenomena which are unique at the lhc , and difficult even at a future linear collider  @xcite .",
    "it was emphasized by albrow , cox and royon @xcite that the so - called central exclusive production ( cep ) process might provide a particularly clean environment to search for , and identify the nature of , new particles at the lhc .",
    "there is also a potentially rich , more exotic physics menu including ( light ) gluino and squark production , gluinonia , radions , and indeed any object which has @xmath160 or @xmath161 quantum numbers and couples strongly to gluons @xcite .",
    "central exclusive production processes @xmath162 , where @xmath53 denotes the absence of hadronic activity ( gap ) between the outgoing hadrons and the decay products of the central system @xmath54 , are attractive for two main reasons .",
    "firstly , if the outgoing protons remain intact and scatter through small angles , then , to a very good approximation , the central system @xmath54 must be dominantly produced in a spin @xmath163 , cp even state , therefore allowing a clean determination of the quantum numbers of any observed resonance .",
    "secondly , as a result of these quantum number selection rules , coupled with the ( in principle ) excellent mass resolution on the central system achievable if suitable proton detectors are installed , signal to background ratios greater than unity are predicted for sm higgs production @xcite , and significantly larger for the lightest higgs boson in certain regions of the mssm parameter space @xcite",
    ". simply stated , the reason for these large signal to background ratios is that exclusive @xmath48 quark production , the primary background in light higgs searches , is heavily suppressed due to the quantum number selection rules .",
    "another attractive feature is the ability to directly probe the cp structure of the higgs sector by measuring azimuthal asymmetries in the tagged protons @xcite .",
    "another strategy to explore the manifestation of the explicit cp violation in the higgs sector was recently studied by ellis et al .",
    "@xcite .    .",
    "]    the benchmark cep process for new physics searches is sm higgs production , sketched in fig .  [",
    "fig : f17 ] .",
    "the cross section prediction for the production of a 120 gev higgs at 14 tev is 3 fb , falling to 1 fb at 200 gev @xcite .",
    "the simplest channel to observe the sm higgs in the tagged proton approach from the experimental perspective is the @xmath164 decay channel @xcite .",
    "more challenging from a trigger perspective in the @xmath165 channel .",
    "this mode , however , becomes extremely important in the so - called intense coupling regime of the mssm , where the cep is likely to be the discovery channel . in this case",
    "it is expected close to @xmath166 exclusively produced double - tagged higgs bosons in 30fb@xmath159 of delivered luminosity .",
    "about 100 would survive the experimental cuts , with a signal - to - background ratio of order 10 .",
    "furthermore , as was reported in @xcite , forward proton tagging will make possible a unique program of high energy photon interactions physics at the lhc .",
    "for example , the two photon production of @xmath4 pairs will allow a high precision study of the quartic gauge couplings @xcite .",
    "photon interactions are enhanced in heavy ion collisions and studies of such ultra peripheral collisions were discussed in @xcite .",
    "in addition , two photon exclusive production of lepton pairs provides an excellent tool for calibrating both luminosity and the energy scale of the tagged events @xcite .",
    "finally , by tagging both outgoing protons , the lhc is effectively turned into a glue - glue collider .",
    "this will open up a rich , high rate qcd physics menu ( especially in what concerns diffractive phenomena ) , allowing to study the skewed unintegrated gluon densities and the details of rapidity gap survival @xcite .",
    "note that the cep provides a source of practically pure gluon jets ( gluon factory @xcite ) .",
    "this can be an ideal laboratory to study the properties of gluon jets , especially in comparison with the quark jets , and even the way to search for the glueballs .",
    "cox and kowalski @xcite discussed the outline of the fp420 r&d project aimed at assessing whether it is possible to install forward proton detectors with appropriate acceptance at atlas and/or cms , and to fully integrate such detectors within the experimental trigger frameworks @xcite .",
    "a wealth of diffractive data is available over an extended kinematic range from the hera experiments , allowing precise measurements of the diffractive structure function and the extraction of the diffractive parton distribution functions ( dpdfs ) .",
    "the main news here is that , for the first time , several independent next - to - leading - order qcd fits to the data have become available . while all fits suggest that the dpdfs are gluon - dominated , significant differences between the various sets are evident .",
    "the origin of these differences is under investigation ; at the moment they are the only information we have on the dpdfs uncertainties .",
    "a precise and consistent determination of the dpdfs is one of the main aims of the hera community in the near future .",
    "these functions provide an important input for the prediction of inclusive hard diffractive cross sections at the lhc .",
    "they are also essential to test the validity of the qcd factorisation in diffractive processes .",
    "recent results on deeply virtual compton scattering and exclusive meson production from the hera experiments and from compass and clas are especially interesting because of their sensitivity to the generalized parton distributions ( gpds ) .",
    "gpds extend the standard pdfs by including the information on correlations between partons and on their transverse momentum .",
    "gpds would allow , through ji s sum rule , the determination of the contribution of the quark angular momentum to the proton spin .",
    "moreover , they provide a useful input for the prediction of the diffractive exclusive cross sections at the lhc . in this respect ,",
    "the measurements of central exclusive production rates , on the way with run - ii tevatron data , play also an important role .    in the past few years",
    "there has been an increasing interest in the study of diffractive processes at the lhc .",
    "the totem detector , integrated with cms , will allow the study of diffractive physics with the largest acceptance detector ever built at a hadron collider .",
    "the lhc physics programme can be significantly enlarged by equipping a region at 420  m from the atlas and/or cms interaction point , as has been recently proposed by the fp420 r&d project .",
    "this would provide a particularly clean environment to search for , and to identify the nature of , the new particles ( first of all , the higgs boson ) . at the same time this would open a rich qcd menu and allow a unique program of high - energy photon interactions .",
