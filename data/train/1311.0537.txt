    "the baados - silk - west effect ( the bsw effect ) consists in getting arbitrarily large energies @xmath0 in the centre of mass frame of particles colliding near black holes @xcite , i.e. in the strong gravitational field . nonetheless , it turned out that a kinematic nature of the bsw effect outside the event horizon can be revealed in terms of a very simple model of particles colliding in _ flat _ space - time ( see sec .",

    "now , we show the existence of analogy of this kind for collisions inside black holes .",

    "thus for the bsw effect near the inner black hole horizon @xcite - @xcite , there exists its counterpart in the flat space - time .",
    "one observer explains the bsw effect by the proximity to the horizon and a special character of trajectories of colliding particles .",
    "but another observer does not see the horizon at all , so his explanation should be qualitatively different .",
    "moreover , the two - dimensional part of near - horizon geometry is described by the milne metric ( see below ) which is flat , so our consideration relies not on some particular model but has a general character .",
    "it was shown in @xcite , @xcite that one of colliding particles should follow the trajectory that would pass through the bifurcation point where the future and past horizons meet .",
    "as such a point does not show up in realistic black holes , one could think that corresponding scenarios of collision looked somewhat academic . here , we show that , nonetheless , there exists also such a scenario of the bsw effect in which the actual point of collision may be near the horizon far from the bifurcation point .",
    "one can hope that this makes the bsw effect near the inner black hole or cosmological horizon more physical .",
    "one reservation is in order .",
    "the whole space - time of an eternal black hole consists of the `` black hole '' and `` white hole '' parts .",
    "i discuss motion of particles from the inner non - static region to the outer static one that corresponds to the white hole region .",

    "let us consider the metric of a spherically symmetric black hole@xmath2    here , it is assumed that @xmath3 that does not affect the essence of matter but simplifies formulas .",

    "however , locally , in the small vicinity of the horizon from inside , the milne metric can be considered as a good approximation to the black hole metric .",

    "scenario c of collisions tells us that the high energy collision can occur far from the bifurcation point , its very existence is not mandatory at all .",
    "this makes this version of the bsw effect more physical : it can manifest itself any time a particle with the fine - tuned parameters crosses the horizon in the direction from the inner nonstatic region to the outer static one , be it the inner black hole horizon , the cosmological or the isolated one @xcite ."
