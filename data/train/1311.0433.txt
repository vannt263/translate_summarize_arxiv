    "-input - multiple - output ( mimo ) communications @xcite have continued to be one of the key technologies of the next generation wireless systems due to their potential of providing higher data rate and better reliability compared to the conventional single - input - single - output ( siso ) systems .",
    "when the channel state information ( csi ) is available at both the transmitter and receiver , it is well known that the closed - loop gain can be further acquired by jointly designing the precoder and the equalizer . among these closed - loop transceiver design schemes , singular - value - decomposition",
    "( svd)-based linear transceiver decomposes the mimo channel into multiple parallel subchannels and is known to achieve the channel capacity if proper power allocation @xcite is applied .",
    "however , due to the variation of the signal - to - noise - ratio ( snr ) in each subchannel , the bit error rate ( ber ) performance is dominated by the subchannel with the worst snr .",
    "consequently , without sophisticated bit - allocation schemes , fundamental trade - off between the ber and capacity can not be avoided in this type of design @xcite .",
    "in addition to the svd - based linear design , geometric - mean - decomposition ( gmd)-based nonlinear transceiver design has also been proposed @xcite . with the help of gmd @xcite",
    ", the mimo channel is decomposed into multiple subchannels with identical snr , and hence the simple identical bit allocation can be used for all subchannels .",
    "it has also been shown that the gmd - based transceiver under the zero - forcing ( zf ) constraint asymptotically achieves both the optimal ber and capacity simultaneously at sufficiently high snr . due to these nice properties , various extensions and generalizations of gmd - based transceivers",
    "have been reported in the literature @xcite .",
    "as the gmd is the core of many advanced mimo transceiver designs , the associated implementation issues started to draw researchers attention @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "a scaled geometric mean decomposition algorithm was proposed in order to simplify the detection logic . in @xcite",
    ", the authors presented a constant throughput of gmd implementation which also supports hardware sharing between precoding and signal detection modules . in this correspondence ,",
    "a new implementation issue of the gmd algorithm is addressed .",
    "we noticed that all the existing gmd algorithm requires the computation of the geometric mean @xmath0 of all the positive singular values of the matrix to be decomposed in the initialization step .",
    "this requires the capability of computing the @xmath1th root @xmath2{a}$ ] of some positive real number @xmath3 , in which @xmath4 for all @xmath5 . for special cases where @xmath6 with @xmath7 being some positive integer , it is possible to decompose the computation of @xmath0 into successive geometric mean computations of two numbers , @xmath8 where the square root operation can be carried out efficiently using cordic - based computing @xcite .",
    "for @xmath9 , while finding @xmath2{a}$ ] can generally be achieved by using newton s type of @xmath1th - root algorithm @xcite , the difficulty lies in the fact that a good initial guess is often required for the algorithm to converge .",
    "another possible way of computing @xmath2{a}$ ] is to first transform @xmath10 into logarithmic domain and then convert it back after divided by @xmath1 .",
    "cordic - based algorithms can be used to implement algorithmic and exponential functions , but the inherent bounded input range often limits their applications unless extra pre- and post - processing steps are applied .",
    "an alternative method is to use lookup tables and/or a piecewise polynomial ( including linear ) algorithms to realize both the logarithmic and exponential functions .",
    "a mass of memory and extra computations are therefore required to ensure the accuracy for such high dynamic - range computations .    in this correspondence , we propose an iterative gmd ( igmd ) algorithm based on the technique of successive approximation .",
    "the proposed algorithm has a regular structure and is applicable to matrices of any dimension .",
    "it does not require explicit computation of the @xmath1th root , and hence eliminates the hardware difficulties mentioned above .",
    "the convergence proof of proposed iterative gmd algorithm is provided , and numerical results show the performance of the proposed algorithm converges to that of the gmd very quickly within a few iterations .    _",
    "notations : _ throughout this paper , matrices and vectors are set in boldface , with uppercase letters for matrices and lower case letters for vectors .",
    "the superscripts @xmath11 , @xmath12 denote the transpose and conjugate transpose of a matrix , respectively .",

    "the proposed iterative gmd algorithm can be described as follows .",
    "* initialization : * given the matrix @xmath22 of rank @xmath23 , the algorithm starts with some general orthogonal decomposition of @xmath24 @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are both semi - unitary , and @xmath28 is upper - triangular . for general @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath1",
    ", one can always choose the singular value decomposition for initialization .",
    "for special cases where @xmath24 is full column rank with @xmath31 , other orthogonal decompositions such as the qr decomposition @xcite can also be used .",
    "the algorithm then initializes by setting @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and starts with iteration index @xmath35 .",
    "* iteration : * in each iteration , the algorithm performs @xmath36 stages of operations as the stage index @xmath37 ranges from @xmath38 to @xmath36 .    at stage @xmath37",

    "the matrices @xmath40 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 are then updated as @xmath77 it is clear that @xmath40 remains upper - triangular , and @xmath75 and @xmath76 both remain unitary after ( [ eq : update_r])-([eq : update_s ] ) are performed at the end of each stage . if the stage index @xmath37 is smaller than @xmath36 , the algorithm set @xmath78 and performs the procedure ( [ r_tilde_22])-([eq : update_s ] ) .",
