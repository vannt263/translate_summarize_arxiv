    "exponential and gaussian distributions are signatures of the boltzmann - gibbs statistical mechanics .",
    "these distributions are those that maximise the boltzmann - gibbs entropy and ensure the equilibrium state .",
    "the maxwell distribution is an instance of the equilibrium distribution for the velocities of molecules in an ideal gas .",
    "the underlying mathematical reason for this is the existence of the standard central limit theorem ( clt ) @xcite . on the other hand , due to ergodicity",
    "breaking , some systems remain indefinitely trapped into non - exponential and non - gaussian distributions , and thus achieve out - of - equilibrium quasi - stationary states .",
    "the @xmath0-exponential and the @xmath0-gaussian distributions are functions associated with some of these quasi - stationary states and they are the maximising distributions for the non - additive tsallis entropy given by @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "this feature permits to describe these special non - equilibrium states with the same formal framework of the equilibrium thermostatistics , known as tsallis statistics @xcite , and this general picture is reduced to the equilibrium one if the parameter @xmath0 attains a special limiting value ( @xmath2 ) . in this case , the underlying mathematical mechanism is the generalized clt @xcite , which states that the stable limit distributions for a certain class of systems in such quasi - stationary states are @xmath0-gaussians .",
    "therefore , the role of @xmath0-gaussians in tsallis statistics is basically the same as that of gaussians in boltzmann - gibbs statistics . in this work",
    "we show , for the first time , that these two cases coexist in the classical standard map , and discuss the necessary conditions under which one case prevails over the other one .",
    "this neatly illustrates the respective domains of validity of boltzmann - gibbs and of tsallis statistics .",
    "non - gaussian distributions , particularly @xmath0-gaussians , have been observed in nature in several experimental , observational and model systems @xcite .",
    "impressive experimental examples include ( i )  a high dimensional dissipative system where the probability densities of velocity differences measured in a couette - taylor experiment for a fully developed turbulence regime @xcite , ( ii )  transport properties of cold atoms in dissipative optical lattices @xcite and ( iii )  transverse momentum spectra of hadrons at lhc experiments @xcite . as observational works , for small bodies in the solar system , particularly asteroid rotation periods and diameters @xcite and distribution of meteor showers @xcite can be given . at a larger scale ,",
    "the rotation curve for the m33 triangulum galaxy has been successfully analyzed in the same sense @xcite . among model systems , one of the paradigmatic dissipative low dimensional model ,",
    "the logistic map , has been numerically investigated and @xmath0-gaussians have been found as the chaos threshold is approached using the band splitting structure obeying the huberman - rudnick scaling law @xcite .",
    "@xmath0-gaussians have also been recently observed in a conservative high dimensional model @xcite . in the @xmath3-xy model ,",
    "i.e. , a system of @xmath4 classical localized planar rotators with two - body interactions and periodic boundary conditions , the potential is assumed to decay with distance as @xmath5 , and @xmath6 is the parameter that controls the range of the interactions , short - range for @xmath7 , and long - range for @xmath8 ( @xmath9 is the spatial dimensionality of the system ) .",
    "recently a generalization of the conservative one - dimensional fermi - pasta - ulam model , properly modified to account for linear and nonlinear long - range interactions , has been analyzed .",
    "the range of the interactions is controlled in the same way as for the @xmath3-xy model just mentioned .",
    "ordinary gaussians are observed when short - range interactions ( @xmath10 ) are present , and @xmath0-gaussians are observed when long - range interactions ( @xmath11 ) are present @xcite . it has been found that the maximal lyapunov exponent @xmath12 asymptotically decreases as @xmath13 , in a rather similar way of that observed in @xcite for the @xmath3-xy model and the @xmath0-gaussian distributions that emerge are characterized by the parameter @xmath0 that depends on @xmath3 .",
    "all these systems appear to share in common the following scenario : ergodicity in a region is characterized by the largest lyapunov exponent @xmath12 and two regimes shall be distinguished in the thermodynamic limit ( number of particles @xmath14 ) .",
    "( i ) strongly chaotic regime corresponds to a large positive lyapunov exponent , where the system is ergodic .",
    "the dynamics of the system evolves to an equilibrium state described by boltzmann - gibbs statistical mechanics , with exponential or gaussian distributions ( according to the considered dynamical variable ) ; ( ii ) weakly chaotic regime corresponds to a very small positive lyapunov exponent ( @xmath15 ) , where the system behaves for a very long time as non - ergodic .",
    "distributions of the dynamical variables are not exponential or gaussians , and the boltzmann - gibbs framework is not suitable for this case .",
    "@xmath0-gaussian distributions have been observed for this case by proper time and ensemble averages @xcite .",
    "these distributions are obtained by maximisation of the nonadditive entropy @xmath16 @xcite , which is a strong indication that these systems are connected to nonextensive statistical mechanics @xcite .",
    "they may be written as @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the lagrange parameter and the @xmath0-exponential is given by @xmath19^{1/(1-q)}_+$ ] , with @xmath20_+ \\equiv \\max\\{0,a\\}$ ] and its inverse , @xmath0-logarithm , is defined by @xmath21 .",
    "the ordinary gaussian , exponential and logarithm functions are respectively recovered in the limit @xmath22 .    in this paper",
    "we consider the standard map , that is a paradigmatic low dimensional conservative ( area - preserving ) model , and we follow the averaging procedure originally used for the logistic map , as described in @xcite .",
    "as will be discussed in detail below , this paradigmatic model offers an excellent medium for us to analyse both regimes explained above and to establish a connection between these regimes where the system is ergodic and non - ergodic .",
    "the standard map is defined as @xcite @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are taken as modulo @xmath26 .",
    "this map has very rich properties depending on the map parameter @xmath27 . here ,",
    "we will focus on four representative cases whose phase portraits are given in fig .",
    "[ fig : phasediagram ] . the two extreme cases are @xmath28 and @xmath29 , one of which represents the domination of the phase space with the stability islands and the other is clearly an example of the invasion of the full phase space by the chaotic sea . on the other hand ,",
    "the other two cases in between , namely , @xmath30 and @xmath31 , are good examples in order to see how these regions with stability islands and chaotic sea merge in the available phase space .",
    "it is clear that if the system starts from an initial condition located on one of the archipelagos ( given by the same color ) , it will stay forever in the same archipelago , whereas if it starts from somewhere in the chaotic sea , the iterates will cover the whole chaotic region .",

    "calculating the lyapunov exponent by taking an ensemble average would not be exactly correct here since the contributions coming from the initial conditions of stability islands are much smaller than the ones coming from the chaotic sea . therefore , making an ensemble average would not reflect the correct behaviour of the system . in order to reflect the correct behaviour",
    ", we prefer to plot the largest lyapunov exponents as given in fig .",
    "[ fig : lyaphasediagram ] , where we calculate the exponent of each initial condition separately over the whole phase space and the magnitude of the exponents are given by a color map .",
    "as seen in the figure , the case @xmath32 represents a lyapunov spectrum in which all results are extremely close to zero ( black dots ) , whereas the case @xmath29 conversely exhibits a spectrum where all results are largely positive ( yellowish dots ) .",
    "this means that , in the former case ( latter case ) , the whole phase space is dominated by the stability islands ( chaotic sea ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the other two cases , @xmath30 and @xmath31 , are good examples where the phase space consists of both stability islands and chaotic sea .",
    "this way of representing the lyapunov spectrum allows us to see clearly the portions of the whole phase space where the system is ergodic and non - ergodic for a given @xmath27 value .",

    "we define the variable @xmath34 where the average @xmath35 is calculated as time average taken over not only a large number of @xmath36 iterations , but also a large number of @xmath37 randomly chosen initial values , namely , @xmath38 and calculate the probability distribution of @xmath39 , namely @xmath40 , for any given @xmath27 parameter .",
    "let us start with the result of the case @xmath41 , where the probability distribution is expected to be a gaussian since for this case the phase space is totally a chaotic sea , which makes the whole system ergodic .",
    "the result is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : distrib.k.10 ] where a clear gaussian is easily seen as expected .",
    "it should also be noted that the stable limit distribution is obtained quickly .",
    "now we can investigate the case @xmath32 , where the probability distribution is expected to be a non - gaussian due to the change of the phase space from being totally chaotic to totally consists of stability islands , which makes the whole system non - ergodic .",
    "the result is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : distrib.k.02 ] where , instead of a gaussian , now a clear @xmath0-gaussian is observed with @xmath42 . in this case",
    ", the stable limit distribution happens to be achieved slowly but at the level of @xmath43 it has already been reached .",
    "we have checked it with @xmath44 and verified that the distribution does not change in the displayed region .",
    "we also plot the same data as @xmath0-logarithm of the probability distribution in fig .",
    "[ fig : lndistrib.k.02 ] in order to see whether it is a straight line or not . for three different regions ( i.e. , the region including the tails , intermediate region and the central part ) ,",
    "the straight line is well approached .",
    "the fact that we observe straight lines in all scales excludes other distributions that are asymptotic power laws , like lvy distributions .    in order to better illustrate this tendency",
    ", we also perform another test by taking a @xmath27 value where the stability islands and chaotic sea coexist , i.e. , the case @xmath31 . for this case , it is evident from fig .",
    "[ fig : lyaphasediagram ] that the region of chaotic sea with large positive lyapunov exponents and the region of stability islands with lyapunov exponents close to zero can easily be detected .",
    "this means that the system is ergodic within some portion of the phase space , whereas it is indeed non - ergodic within some other portion .",
    "therefore we can check our previous findings using these portions separately .",
    "if we use initial conditions all taken from the portion where the system is ergodic ( non - ergodic ) , we expect to see the same distribution function we have found before , namely the gaussian ( @xmath0-gaussian with @xmath42 ) .",
    "in fact , this is exactly what we see in fig .",
    "[ fig : k2 ] , which nicely corroborates our results given in fig .",

    "finally we will be interested in another interesting question : what happens to the probability distribution if we do not take the portions of the phase space separately where the system is ergodic and non - ergodic but consider initial conditions coming from the whole phase space in the calculation of the probability distribution .",
    "this is really worth analysing since in this case one would expect a competition between initial conditions coming from the regions of the available phase space where the system is ergodic and non - ergodic and therefore between gaussian and @xmath0-gaussian behaviour .",
    "needless to say , as the region in the phase space where the system is non - ergodic diminishes ( like the case @xmath29 ) , gaussian distribution will win , whereas the winner will be @xmath0-gaussian as the region where the system is ergodic shrinks ( like the case @xmath28 ) . we notice that , if these regions coexist together , then this competition between gaussian and @xmath0-gaussian can be modelled as    @xmath45 ^ 2 ) + ( 1-\\alpha )   \\exp(-\\beta [ yp(0)]^2 )   .\\ ] ]    we check this hypothesis using our two appropriate cases , namely , @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",

    "remarkably enough , the distributions originated from initial conditions taken inside the region of islands , instead of over the entire phase space , yield one and the same value @xmath42 , independently on whether we consider one or many of these regions , and independently from @xmath27 .",
