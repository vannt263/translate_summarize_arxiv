    "sequential estimation continues observations until the observed sample satisfies a certain prescribed criterion .",
    "its properties have been shown to be superior on the average to those of nonsequential estimation in which the number of observations is fixed a priori .",
    "specifically the developments of higher - order asymptotic theory have suggested that the information loss due to the exponential curvature of the statistical model might be recovered by a sequential estimation procedure which makes use of the ancillary statistic .",
    "such an estimator is expected to have a uniformly better characteristic on the average ( see e.g. srensen ( 1986 ) ) .",
    "takeuchi and akahira ( 1988 ) formulated this scheme rigorously and analyzed the higher - order efficiency of sequential estimation procedures in the scalar parameter case ( see also akahira and takeuchi ( 1989 ) ) .",
    "they showed that in the sequential case the exponential curvature term in the second - order variance can be eliminated by a second - order efficient estimator , and the maximum likelihood estimator with an appropriate stopping rule gives such a sequential estimator .",
    "this also implies that appropriately designed sequential estimators are superior to nonsequential estimators in the asymptotic sense .",
    "following the work of takeuchi and akahira ( 1988 , 1989 ) , okamoto , amari and takeuchi ( 1991 ) generalized the results to the multiparameter case by using the geometrical method , and studied characteristics of more general sequential estimation procedures . in the nonsequential case ,",
    "a statistical manifold is uniformly enlarged by @xmath0 times when we use @xmath0 observations , keeping the intrinsic features of the manifold unchanged . in a sequential estimation procedure with a certain stopping rule",
    ", the observed sample size @xmath0 is a random variable depending on the position of a statistical manifold .",
    "this causes a nonuniform expansion of the statistical manifold .",
    "such an expansion is called the conformal transformation in geometry , since it changes the scale locally and isotropically but it does not change the shape of a figure ( it does not change the orthogonality ) .",
    "the result of takeuchi and akahira can be interpreted such that it is possible to reduce the exponential curvature of a statistical manifold to zero by a suitable conformal transformation .",
    "the conformal geometry thus is an adequate framework for the analysis of the sequential inferential procedures if we extend the concept of the conformal transformation to the statistical manifold which is the riemannian manifold with a dual couple of affine connections .    as a sequel to okamoto , amari and takeuchi ( 1991 )",
    ", this paper investigates the sequential estimating procedures from the information geometrical viewpoint .",
    "the novelty of this paper is the introduction of the dual conformal weyl - schouten curvature of a statistical manifold , and this quantity will be proved to play a central role when considering the problem of covariance minimization under the sequential estimating procedures .",
    "information geometry was originated with the work of amari ( 1985 ) , and it has been establishing a solid status as a mathematical methodology for a variety of statistical sciences ( see e.g. amari et al ( 1987 ) , amari and nagaoka ( 2000 ) , kumon ( 2009 , 2010 ) ) . in line with these developments , the present paper also intends to provide a starting point for studying the conformal geometry of a statistical manifold itself succeeding to the work of lauritzen ( 1987 ) .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows .",
    "the established known results are cited as propositions , and the results obtained in this paper are stated as theorems . in the next section , we prepare some statistical notations and preliminary results which will be relevant in this paper . in section 3 , we formulate a conformal transformation of a statistical manifold , where a set of dual weyl - schouten curvature tensors is introduced .",
    "then we elucidate their implications in the structures of statistical manifolds . in this connection ,",
    "the meaning of conjugate symmetry is also explained , which is the notion first introduced by lauritzen ( 1987 ) . in section 4",
    ", the general result in the previous section is used to write out the structure of multidimentional exponential family . in section 5 ,",
    "the general result is used to delineate the structure of multidimensional curved exponential family , where the dual euler - schouten curvatures are introduced .",
    "then related notions such as totally exponential umbilic and dual quadric hypersurface are shown to involve key elements in studying statistical submanifolds .",
    "in section 6 , the geometrical results obtained in the previous sections are applied to the sequential estimation in a multidimensional curved exponential family , where we give a concrete procedure for the covariance minimization . in section 7 , the results in section 6 are numerically examined by two typical curved exponential families called the von mises - fisher model and the hyperboloid model .",
    "section 8 is devoted to some additional discussions and a perspective of future work .",
    "let us denote by @xmath1 a @xmath2-dimentional random process defined on the probability space @xmath3 $ ] with values in @xmath4 $ ] , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 is the @xmath7-field of all borel sets in @xmath8 .",

    "sequential statistical procedures are characterized by a random sample size , where stopping times are used to stop the observations of the process .",
    "we denote by @xmath33 an arbitrary stopping time , i.e. , a random variable @xmath33 defined on @xmath34 with values in @xmath35 and possessing the property @xmath36 .",
    "we consider the case to which the sudakov lemma applies , where the stopped process @xmath37 has the densities @xmath38 , and these can be regarded as the same functions in ( [ eq:1 ] ) ( cf .  e.g.  magiera ( 1974 ) ) .",
    "a typical statistical problem is the unbiased estimation of a given @xmath26-dimensional real vector valued function @xmath39 of the parameter @xmath29 by using observations on the @xmath40 .",
    "an estimating procedure for @xmath41 is defined by a pair @xmath42 , where @xmath33 is a stopping variable and @xmath43 is a @xmath18-valued function defined on @xmath44 , which is an unbiased estimator of @xmath41 , i.e. , @xmath45 = h(\\theta)$ ] .",

    "exponential one , either .",
    "hence we can restrict attention to the case ( [ eq:2 ] ) , when considering the attainment of the lower bound given by proposition 1.1 .",
    "however we should remark that it is only a necessary condition for the attainment of the lower bound .",
    "in fact even in the f.r.m .  exponential family , only some restricted cases can exactly attain the lower bound due to the problem of the `` overshooting '' at the efficient stopping times ( see ghosh ( 1987 ) ) .",
