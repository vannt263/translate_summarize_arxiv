    "et al._@xcite have reported a measurement of a wave function of a single electron traveling in a ballistic conductor .",
    "this groundbreaking experiment opens the route to the control and characterization of single- and few- electron states injected on demand into solid state circuits.@xcite    the experiment of ref .",
    "was done with a train of electrons , each prepared in a well - controlled single - electron state called a leviton .",
    "such a train is also appropriate to address another problem important for a few - electron state engineering .",
    "namely , it is important to demonstrate directly that a multi - particle state is not formed in the stream of levitons .",
    "such a multi - particle state should be necessarily formed if the distance between the levitons would become comparable with the width of a leviton , see fig .",
    "so , merely by varying the rate at which the levitons are generated , one can tune the state of a stream from a multi - particle state to ( the product of ) single - particle states .    in quantum",
    "optics@xcite the single- and multi - photon states are distinguished with the help of the intensity - intensity correlation measurement@xcite : the photon flux is divided by a beam splitter and the resulting fluxes are directed to two single - photon detectors .",
    "the absence of coincident detections proves that a multi - photon state is not present in the flux .",
    "this technique is customarily used to characterize single - photon sources.@xcite    in quantum coherent electronics the analogue of an optic beam splitter is a quantum point contact,@xcite which divides an electric current into two beams , the reflected and the transmitted one .",
    "thus the current cross - correlation measurement is expected to be an analogue of a coincidence detection measurement in optics .",
    "however this is not the case .",
    "the reason is that there are no efficient single - electron detectors available at the moment .",
    "therefore , what is measured in electronics is a current noise , the product of fluctuations of reflected and transmitted currents averaged over a long time .",
    "apart of the thermal fluctuations vanishing at low temperatures , the noise contains a part , known as the shot noise , which relies on the quantization of charge and exists due to the fact that an electron can be either transmitted or reflected but not both.@xcite in the absence of electron - electron correlations the shot noise is proportional to the mean number of particles in a stream per unit time,@xcite since each particle is scattered independently .",
    "this fact was used in refs .   to count directly the number of particles emitted in each cycle . another approach to characterize a single - electron emission regime is to measure a finite frequency noise , which also provides information on a short - time dynamics of the source.@xcite        if the distance between particles within a periodic stream would decrease such that different particles start to overlap , see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , the mean number of particles per period would not change while a multi - particle state would emerge .",
    "this results in fluctuations of the number of particles measured during a given period .",
    "the shot noise , however , can not distinguish single- and multi - particle states as long as the mean number of particles per period is the same .",
    "the aim of this work is to demonstrate that another measurable , namely the first - order correlation function , can be used to make the necessary distinction . in refs .",
    "it was shown that the correlation function in time domain is directly accessible via a time resolved interference current , which is measured at the exit of an electronic mach - zehnder interferometer@xcite .",
    "another approach to access a correlation function but in energy domain is a single - electron quantum tomography.@xcite it relies on a zero - frequency noise measurement in the hanbury brown and twiss set - up@xcite , where the source of interest is in one input channel while the other input channel is fed by a weak ac voltage .",
    "such an electronic quantum tomography was realized in ref .  .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",

    "let us consider an electronic one - dimensional chiral ( or ballistic ) waveguide connected to an electronic reservoir in equilibrium , a metallic contact at fermi energy @xmath0 , which serves as a source of electrons .",
    "the first - order correlation function for spinless electrons in a waveguide is defined as follows , @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is an electron field operator in the second quantization evaluated at point @xmath3 and time @xmath4 , @xmath5 .",
    "the quantum - statistical average @xmath6 is taken over the equilibrium state of the electronic reservoir .    if a voltage @xmath7 is applied on the contact , then a non - equilibrium flux of particles is injected from a contact into a waveguide .",
    "the excess first - order correlation function is defined as the difference of correlation functions with the voltage on and off ( the subscripts `` @xmath8 '' and `` @xmath9 '' , respectively ) : @xmath10.@xcite the correlation function @xmath11 characterizes a flux of particles injected from a driven contact into a waveguide on the top of the fermi sea with chemical potential @xmath0 , which plays a role of a fermionic vacuum .",
    "importantly , the contribution of injected particles is completely separated from that of the underlying fermi sea.@xcite    at zero temperatures the disturbance of the vacuum due to the injected flux consists in the appearance of particles with energy larger than @xmath0 and in the disappearance of some particles with energy less than @xmath0 . in the former case",
    "one can speak about injection of ( quasi-)electrons , while in the latter case about injection of holes .",
    "below i will focus on an electron injection .",
    "however the presence of holes can be also taken into account by adding a hole correlation function.@xcite    here i am interested in the case when the amplitude of the voltage is relatively small , @xmath12 , and , therefore , the spectrum of injected electrons in a waveguide can be linearized close to the fermi energy @xmath13 . in this case",
    "the excess correlation function depends on a combined coordinate , @xmath14 with @xmath15 the fermi velocity , rather than on @xmath3 and @xmath4 separately .      the single - particle correlation function for a pure @xmath16-electron state ( with possibly @xmath17 )",

    ", an oscillating potential acting on non - interacting electrons of the fermi sea generates a pure state .",
    "the state emitted by a single - electron source without intrinsic dephasing@xcite is also expected to be pure .",

    "the derivation of the second - order excess correlation function is presented in ref .  .",
    "the higher - order correlation functions can be calculated along the same lines .",
    "remarkably , for a fermionic @xmath16-particle state the correlation functions of order higher than @xmath16 all nullify , ( see appendix [ proof2 ] )    @xmath25     + therefore , for a single - electron state @xmath26 , which is a consequence of the fact that the first - order correlation function is factorizable , that is the sum in eq .",
    "( [ g1 ] ) contains only one term .",
    "this property can be used to demonstrate a single - electron state .",
    "sometimes the energy representation is more convenient than the time representation . especially if both electrons and holes are present.@xcite    in general in the energy representation the two - time quantities like @xmath27 become dependent on two energies .",
    "the energy and time representations are related via a corresponding fourier transformation .",
    "however in the case of a system driven periodically with period @xmath28 , the difference of two energies is not arbitrary but can only be a multiple of the energy quantum @xmath29 .",
    "it is convenient to account this property directly and denote one energy as @xmath30 and the other one as , say , @xmath31 with @xmath32 an integer .",
    "i introduce two correlation functions in the energy representation , @xmath33 and @xmath34 , depending on which time @xmath35 or @xmath36 , respectively , can be viewed as conjugate to @xmath30 .",

    "we arrive at the following relations specific for a pure electronic state ,    @xmath50     + the details of calculations are given in appendix [ fourie - pure ] .",
    "the excess correlation function can be expressed in terms of the floquet scattering amplitude@xcite of a periodically driven source , which depends on two energies .",
    "however in the limit of an adiabatic ( slow ) drive , the source can be characterized by the frozen scattering amplitude , @xmath51 , which depends on one energy and time .",
    "the dependence on energy @xmath30 is the same as for the scattering amplitude of a stationary source .",
    "the dependence on time @xmath52 stems from the fact that some parameters of a source ( and hence of a stationary scattering matrix ) are affected by the drive .",
    "since the drive is periodic in time , the scattering amplitude is also periodic in time , @xmath53 . at zero temperature what matters is the scattering amplitude of a source evaluated for electrons with fermi energy , @xmath54 .",

    "this hinders a direct use of energy - resolved measurements to differentiate single- and multi - particle states in the case of a stream of levitons .",
