    "extremely metal poor ( emp ) stars were presumably among the first stars formed in the galaxy , and hence represent in effect a local high - redshift population .",
    "such stars provide important clues to the chemical history of our galaxy , the role and type of early sn , the mode of star formation in the proto - milky way , and the formation of the galactic halo .",
    "@xcite compiled the small sample of emp stars known as of 2005 .",
    "the goal of our 0z project is to increase this sample substantially .",
    "our sample selection is based on mining the database of the hamburg / eso survey @xcite for candidate emp stars with [ fe / h ] @xmath0  dex @xcite .",
    "our abundance determination procedures are described in @xcite .",
    "the determination of stellar parameters , measurement of equivalent widths , and detailed abundance analyses were all carried out by j.  cohen .    our data in general",
    "follow the well established trends from numerous studies of galactic halo stars between abundance ratios [ x / fe ] and overall metallicity as measured by [ fe / h ] ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the interesting question is whether in the low metallicity regime studied here we can detect the effect of only a small number of sn contributing to a star s chemical inventory or inhomogeneous mixing within the ism at these early stages of formation of the galaxy .",
    "thus the size of the scatter around these trends and whether there are major outliers is of great interest .",
    "after all the abundance analyses were completed , we looked for _ strong _ outliers , either high or low , in plots of [ x / fe ] vs [ fe / h ] .",
    "we checked these in detail .",
    "the ca abundance turned out to be problematical in those very c - rich stars whose spectra were obtained prior to hires detector upgrade in mid-2004 and thus included only a limited wavelength range . in an effort to derive ca abundances from these early hires spectra , we ended up using lines which were crowded / blended , presumably by molecular features .",
    "this was only realized fairly recently when we obtained additional c - star hires spectra extending out to 8000    which covered key isolated ca  i lines in the 6160    region .",
    "we found much lower ca abundances from the additional ca lines in these carbon stars .",
    "our earlier claims in @xcite of high ca / fe for some c - rich stars are not correct .",
    "these abundance analyses were carried out over a period of a decade , and some updates were made in j.  cohen s master list of adopted @xmath5 values during that period .",
    "the next step , completed in dec 2011 after the conference , was to homogenize the @xmath5 values .",
    "fig . 1 shows [ ca / fe ] vs [ fe / h ] for our sample .",
    "linear fits to the abundance ratios vs [ fe / h ] where there is adequate data for the species x were calculated , excluding c - rich stars and a small number of _ strong _ outliers .",
    "an example of these fits is shown for ca in fig  2 , where in the lower panel the included stars are shown together with the fit ( thick solid line ) and the fit @xmath60.15  dex ( dashed lines ) .",
    "note that the fit for [ ca / fe ] vs [ fe / h ] is constant , [ ca / fe ] = 0.26  dex . in the upper panel the histogram of deviations from the linear fit",
    "although a number of very deviant low outliers were excluded , an assymetric distribution of @xmath7([ca / fe ] ) still remains , suggesting the presence of a small tail of stars with low [ ca / fe ] , though not so extreme that the stars were rejected as strong outliers .",
    "this is also apparent in the lower panel , where there are four stars with [ ca / fe ] @xmath8 ; these values were not low enough for them to be rejected as strong outliers .",
    "current work focuses on determining whether the dispersion about these fits is larger than the expected uncertainties .",
    "we are very grateful to the palomar , las campanas , and keck time allocation committees for their long - term support of this effort .",
    "j.  cohen acknowledges partial support from nsf grants ast0507219 and ast0908139",
    ". i.  thompson acknowledges partial support from nsf ast-0507325 .",
    "we are grateful to the many people who have worked to make the keck telescopes and their instruments , and the magellan telescopes and their instruments , a reality and to operate and maintain these observatories ."
