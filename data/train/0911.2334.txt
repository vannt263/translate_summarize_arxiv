    "we study coupled neural systems subject to noise and time - delayed feedback @xcite . in particular we focus upon the question how stochastic synchronization of noise - induced oscillations of two coupled neural populations can be controlled by time - delayed feedback , and how robust this is with respect to different coupling schemes of the control force .",
    "time - delayed feedback control of noise - induced oscillations was demonstrated in a single excitable system @xcite .",
    "the simplest network configuration displaying features of neural interaction consists of two coupled excitable systems .    in order to grasp the complicated interaction between billions of neurons in large neural networks , those are often lumped into groups of neural populations each of which can be represented as an effective excitable element that is mutually coupled to the other elements @xcite . in this sense the simplest model which may reveal features of interacting neurons consists of two coupled neural oscillators .",

    "the variable @xmath23 in the control force can be either the activator @xmath11 or the inhibitor @xmath27 .",
    "also , the control force can either be applied to the activator or the inhibitor differential equation .",
    "these possibilities lead to two self - coupling schemes ( @xmath28 and @xmath29 ) where either the activator is coupled to the activator equation or the inhibitor is coupled to the inhibitor equation , and two cross - coupling schemes ( @xmath30 and @xmath31 ) .",
