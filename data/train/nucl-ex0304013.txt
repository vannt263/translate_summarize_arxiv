    "it is an important issue of modern experiments in hadron physics to provide significant information on manifestations of qcd . as is well known ( see e.g.  @xcite )",
    ", the description of the experimentally observed baryon excitation spectrum in terms of the colorless three - quark ( @xmath4 ) configuration within the various quark models has been quite successful .",
    "moreover , qcd allows for exotic structures like multi - quark configurations , glueballs and hybrids .",
    "such states are mainly expected in the mass region above 1.5 gev / c@xmath2 .",
    "it is one of the irritating facts , however , that already the @xmath4 description predicts far more resonance states than experimentally observed .",
    "thus , the search for missing resonances is one of the major concerns of hadron experiments . on the other hand , the existing low - lying states ( nucleon , @xmath5 , n@xmath6 )",
    "are well accounted for within the three - quark picture and neither qcd - inspired calculations at low momentum and close to the chiral limit ( i.e. chiral perturbation theory ) nor perturbative qcd in the high - momentum regime predict states below or close to pion threshold .",
    "if such low - lying states did exist , configurations beyond the naive @xmath4 picture would be required for an explanation .    since the strong decay via pion emission is energetically forbidden for states below pion threshold , these states would necessarily be narrow ( less than a few kev ) with lifetimes typical for electromagnetic or weak decays .",
    "a precise examination of the low - lying nucleon excitation spectrum with various probes is thus a powerful tool to test qcd .",
    "recently , there have been two experiments reported in the literature , one performed at the saturne synchrotron in saclay and the other at the inr in moscow , which claimed the observation of excited states of the nucleon below pion threshold  @xcite .",
    "utilized the h(p , p@xmath0)x reaction to measure the invariant - mass spectrum of the missing nucleon  @xcite .",
    "they claimed to have found resonance states at @xmath7 , 1044 , and 1094 mev / c@xmath2 , with a statistical significance of up to 17 standard deviations .",
    "however , the missing - mass resolution of this experiment was limited and ranged from 7 to 25 mev / c@xmath2 ( fwhm ) . very recently , tatischeff _ et al . _",
    "reported further the observation of additional states at 1136 , 1173 , 1249 , 1277 , 1384 , and possibly 1339 mev / c@xmath2 using the h(p , p@xmath0)x , the d(p , p@xmath1p)x , and the h(p , p@xmath1p ) reactions  @xcite .",
    "filkov _ et al . _",
    "@xcite found resonance structures in the d(p , p@xmath1p)x reaction in the spectra of the invariant masses @xmath8 as well as @xmath9 and claimed the observation of `` supernarrow '' dibaryons ( snd ) at @xmath10 , 1926 , and 1942 mev / c@xmath2 .",
    "the additionally observed resonance structures at @xmath11 , 986 , and 1003 mev / c@xmath2 differ from those reported in @xmath8 by about one nucleon mass .",
    "they were interpreted to be either genuine , i.e. snd @xmath12 p + x , or to result from the decay snd @xmath12 p + n + @xmath13 under the restrictions of a small phasespace and experimental acceptance .",
    "the significance for the snd peaks was estimated to be 6  to  7 standard deviations , with a moderate missing - mass resolution of about 5 mev / c@xmath2 .",
    "so far , various attempts for an explanation of the narrow resonances  @xcite have been offered .",
    "model assumptions beyond the @xmath4 picture result in mass formula prescriptions based on colored  @xcite and colorless  @xcite quark clusters .",
    "it has been argued however  @xcite , that narrow nucleon resonances should be completely excluded , since they were not observed in real compton scattering experiments  @xcite .",
    "another approach describes the narrow resonances as possible members of the su(6 ) spin - flavor multiplet , where only the two - photon transition channel is allowed  @xcite .",
    "this picture accounts for the fact that narrow resonances were not observed in photon - induced reactions like in real compton scattering experiments .",
    "recently , it was proposed to interpret the narrow states as collective excitations of the quark condensate through the multiple production of `` genuine '' goldstone pions with a light mass of @xmath14 20 mev / c@xmath2  @xcite . in this model , the narrow states are spatially extended structures and thus they are likely inaccessible to the real photon probe .",
    "another theoretical interest in the narrow baryons is their influence on astrophysical objects .",
    "it was pointed out that the existence of narrow nucleon resonances would drastically affect the structure of neutron stars by lowering their possible maximal mass , which would be inconsistent with the observations  @xcite . however , the existence of light pions would still be compatible with the observed masses of neutron stars .    meanwhile , there have been reported experiments in direct response to tatischeff s and filkov s findings . in a pilot study of the h(e , e@xmath0)x reaction at the jefferson laboratory  @xcite ,",
    "the yield ratio h(e , e@xmath0)x / h(e , e@xmath0)n was measured , which excludes narrow nucleon resonances to a level of 10@xmath15 .",
    "the d(p , p@xmath1p)x reaction has been revisited at the rcnp in osaka  @xcite , yielding a null result for the above claimed states .",
    "however , the significance of the result of the latter experiment has been questioned in ref .",
    "in fact , we have also reanalyzed the data of the virtual compton scattering experiments at mami , but we did not find any signal above a significance of three standard deviations . in a photoproduction experiment at mami ,",
    "the reactions and h(@xmath13 , @xmath16n ) have been measured with a high luminosity and results are awaited  @xcite .",
    "the issue of the occurence of resonances below pion threshold is thus unsettled .",
    "the observation of such narrow states is always limited by the achievable resolution .",
    "experiments providing highest resolution are therefore best suited to perform such studies . in this paper , we report the results of two series of high - resolution measurements using the h(e , e@xmath0)x and d(e , e@xmath1p)x reactions . the first reaction has been chosen as the analogous reaction to the h(p , p@xmath0)x process of tatischeff _ et al .",
    "_  @xcite .",
    "the energy transfer corresponds to the excitation region of the @xmath5 resonance . with the detection of the scattered electron in coincidence with the produced pion the missing mass of the reaction",
    "has been reconstructed .",
    "the experiment covered the missing - mass region from the neutron mass up to about 1050 mev / c@xmath2 .",
    "in addition , the second electromagnetic reaction d(e , e@xmath1p)x has been studied as the analog of the strong d(p , p@xmath1p)x experiment by filkov _",
    "et al . _",
    "the energy transfer varied from close to the threshold of the deuteron breakup up to the quasielastic region . with the detection of both the scattered electron and the emitted proton , the missing mass of the reaction has been reconstructed .",
    "the experiment covered the missing - mass region from the neutron mass up to about 1100 mev / c@xmath2 .",
    "the measurements were carried out at the three - spectrometer facility of the a1 collaboration at the mainz microtron mami  @xcite .",
    "the target was a standard liquid hydrogen / deuterium target , which was operated at beam currents of up to 15  @xmath17a .",
    "the target cell has been made of a thin havar foil of 10.2 @xmath17 m thickness ( 8.9 @xmath17 m in case of the deuterium target ) .",
    "the cell geometry is stadion - like with a length of 5 cm along the beam axis and a width of 1 cm in the perpendicular direction .",
    "the beam was swept before entering the scattering chamber to fill a square of 4@xmath184 mm@xmath2 on the target .",
    "the three magnetic spectrometers a , b , and c have been used for the detection of the scattered electrons and of the pions or protons of the respective reactions .",
    "the spectrometers are equipped with vertical drift chambers for tracking , a thin and a thick layer of plastic scintillators for the trigger and for @xmath19/p discrimination , and a large - volume gas erenkov counter for e@xmath20 identification .",
    "the setup allows for very clean and high - resolution ( @xmath21 , @xmath22 mrad ) coincidence measurements yielding missing - mass resolutions of typically 1 mev / c@xmath2 ( fwhm ) .      the first pilot measurement in the h(e , e@xmath0)x reaction based on our proposal to the program advisory committee at mami  @xcite was carried out in july 2000 with a total runtime of 18 h. the missing - mass spectrum showed a resonance - like structure around @xmath23 mev / c@xmath2 , with a width of about 1 mev / c@xmath2 , i.e. with the resolution of the setup .",
    "however , the significance was only @xmath24 standard deviations , not warranting an interpretation of this finding as a positive identification .    a dedicated h(e , e@xmath0)x experiment was thus performed in february and august 2002 with a total runtime of 257 hours .",
