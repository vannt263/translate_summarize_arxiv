    "the proof of theorems [ tm13 ] and [ tm14 ] is based on the _ foster  lyapunov drift criterion _ for recurrence and transience of markov chains ( see @xcite , theorems 8.4.2 and 8.4.3 ) .",

    "now , by proving that @xmath191 in the recurrence case , and @xmath192 in the transience case , since compact sets are petite sets , the proofs of theorems [ tm13 ] and [ tm14 ] are accomplished .",
    "a similar approach , by using similar test functions @xmath178 , can be found in @xcite and @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the author considers a markov chain on the nonnegative real line with uniformly bounded transition jumps , while in @xcite the authors generalize this result to the case of uniformly bounded @xmath193-moments of transition jumps , for some @xmath194 .",
