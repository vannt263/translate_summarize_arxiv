    "berkeley 32 ( @xmath13 ocl 522 , l=207.@xmath1495 , b=4.@xmath144 ) , also known as biurakan 8 , is a small galactic ( open ) star cluster of angular diameter @xmath15 .",
    "it is located in the galactic anticentre direction and has been classified as trumpler class ii2 m ( lyng  1987 ) .",
    "this object was discovered by iskudarjan ( 1960 ) and catalogued by setteducati & weaver ( 1960 ) . on the sky survey maps",
    ", the cluster appears to be rich and likely of old age ( cf .",
    "king 1964 ) .",
    "the first photometric study of the cluster was carried out by kaluzny & mazur ( 1991 ) in the @xmath16 and washington systems by ccd imaging of an area @xmath17 .",
    "they presented the colour - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) and discussed its morphology , derived cluster reddening and distance as @xmath18 mag and 3.1@xmath190.2 kpc respectively , and estimated the metallicity as [ fe / h ] = @xmath20 .",
    "they derived an age of @xmath2 6 gyr . using morphological age parameters ,",
    "janes & phelps ( 1994 ) estimated an age of 7.2 gyr for berkeley 32 .",
    "scott et al . (",
    "1995 ) have determined radial velocities of 7 cluster members and found a mean heliocentric radial velocity of + 101@xmath193 km / sec , which among their cluster sample deviates most from a pure galactic rotation after berkeley 17 .",
    "mass function studies of open star clusters indicated that the slopes of the mass functions of older ( age @xmath21 1 gyr ) clusters differ significantly from each other and also are not uniform over the entire mass range ( cf .",
    "sagar & griffiths 1998b ) .",
    "however , the number of old objects studied so far is small . as such",
    ", a study of the old cluster berkeley 32 can contribute interesting knowledge on the mass function of old , probably highly evolved clusters .",
    "our aim is to re - analyse berkeley 32 with deeper photometry than kaluzny & mazur ( 1991 ) had at their disposal and study its mass function which is lacking .",
    "the observations , data reductions and comparison with earlier photometry are given in the next two sections . the cluster radius ,",
    "other photometric results and mass function of the cluster are described in the subsequent sections of the paper .",
    "the ccd observations have been obtained on 1999 march 22 with the 3.5 m telescope at calar alto observatory , spain , run by the max - planck institute for astronomy , heidelberg .",
    "the focal reducer mosca attached at the rc cassegrain focus provided an effective f/2.7 focal ratio ( * http://www.caha.es/caha/instruments/mosca/manual.html * ) .",
    "the observations have been carried out in the johnson @xmath0 and cousins @xmath1 filters using the site 18b ccd chip .",
    "each pixel ( 24@xmath22 square ) corresponded to @xmath23 on the sky .",
    "the non - vignetted area of the ccd was @xmath24 pixel@xmath25 providing a field of about 13.@xmath2625 @xmath27 13.@xmath28 .",
    "the read - out noise was 5.4 electrons per pixel and the ratio electrons - per - adu was @xmath2 2.7 .",
    "figure 1 shows the finding chart for the imaged cluster region and table 1 lists the log of the observations . for calibration purpose , we observed the standard star field sa 98 ( landolt 1992 ) .",
    "the present observations were carried out as a back - up programme .",
    "we therefore could not observe standard stars during the whole night .",
    "instead , we observed the standard field sa 98 three times : before , between , and after the observations of berkeley 32 ( table 1 ) . the strategy was to observe berkeley 32 at a similar air - mass as the standard fields , so that one can calibrate photometric data of the cluster region with an accuracy of a few percent without a precise determination of the atmospheric extinction coefficients .    * table 1",
    ". *  log of ccd observations of the cluster berkeley 32 and the calibration region sa 98 ( landolt 1992 ) .",
    "the data have been obtained on march 22 , 1999 .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     table 8 also lists the numbers which are relevant for the mf determination .",
    "the transformation from apparent to absolute visual magnitude ( @xmath29 ) has been done using the cluster parameters given in table 7 .",
    "the isochrone log(age ) = 9.8 and @xmath30 provides the following parametrization of mass @xmath31 and @xmath29 : @xmath32 the values of the normalised counts ( @xmath33 ) are in stars / arcmin@xmath25 .",
    "they are corrected for completeness and field star contamination , and divided by the mass interval of the magnitude bin .",
    "the errors of the normalised counts result from error propagation .",
    "this may be incorrect from a puristic viewpoint , as they are no longer small compared to the counts .",
    "however , we do not use them any further beyond a qualitative demonstration that they are large .",
    "a common description of the stellar mass spectrum is a power law @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the number of stars in the mass interval @xmath36 , and @xmath37 is the slope of the mf .",
    "however , a uniform exponent is at best realised within limited mass intervals .",
    "the universality of the slope of the initial mass function ( imf ) is still a matter of discussion ( for a recent review see scalo 1998 ) , but studies of a large number of young clusters in the milky way and the large magellanic clouds do not speak evidently against an universal imf at least above 1 @xmath38 ( e.g. sagar et al .",
    "1986 ; sagar & richtler 1991 ; janes & phelps 1994 ; fischer et al . 1998 ; sagar 2000 ) , with @xmath37 around @xmath39 . below 1 @xmath38 ,",
    "the data for young open clusters are sparse and any secure statement on a possible universal imf is not yet possible .",
    "however , in the case of a very old cluster like berkely 32 , we might anyway not expect the imf to be still realized .",
    "as a cluster evolves dynamically , low mass stars evaporate out of the cluster potential faster than high mass stars . in a cluster",
    "much older than its relaxation time , the dynamical effect therefore can change an originally rising imf into a flat or even declining mf .",
    "6 shows the mf for berkeley 32 .",
    "the logarithm of mass is plotted against the logarithm of the normalised counts .",
    "note that the binning in mass is also logarithmic .",
    "although the errors are too large for any deeper analysis , it is apparent that the mf is much flatter than of most young clusters .",
    "a fit to a power - law indeed returns the value @xmath9 while we expect in this mass domain an exponent around @xmath40 for young clusters ( richtler 1994 ) . here",
    "it must be remarked that we assumed single stars for the applied mass - luminosity relation of the isochrone .",
    "sagar & richtler ( 1991 ) discussed how the presence of binaries flattens a `` true '' imf .",
    "but even if we find a large binary fraction in berkeley 32 , as the cmd suggests , their effect would by far not be sufficient to steepen the observed mf to the level as it is observed for young clusters .",
    "this behaviour , in agreement with theoretical expectations , has been found for other old open clusters as well .",
    "for example , francic ( 1989 ) , among his sample of 8 open clusters , found the old objects ngc 752 ( 2.5 gyr ) and m67 ( 5 gyr ) to show even declining mass functions with @xmath41 .",
    "further well studied open clusters like ngc 6791 ( kaluzny & rucinski 1995 ) , ngc 188 ( von hippel & sarajedini 1998 ) , ngc 2243 ( bergbusch et al . 1991 ) also have flatter mfs .",
    "but one also can find old clusters with mf not distinguishable from a salpeter mass function , e.g. , mass spectrum of berkeley 99 ( age 3.2 gyr ) has @xmath42 ( sagar & griffiths 1998b ) .",
    "this demonstrates that open clusters do have distinctly different dynamical histories , which may depend on their structure , total mass , location , orbit characteristics etc .",
    "new @xmath0 and @xmath1 ccd photometry down to @xmath43 mag is presented for about 3,200 stars in the region of the open cluster berkeley 32 .",
    "the present photometry serves as a data base for determining the cluster properties and to study the stellar mass function for the first time .",
    "the cluster s radial density profile is well represented by a king ( 1962 ) profile . by fitting of theoretical isochrones and using the location of the red clump ,",
    "we confirm earlier results that it is indeed a very old open cluster ( 6.3 gyr ) .",
    "its metallicity is between @xmath44 and @xmath45 , distance is 3.3 kpc and galacto - centric distance is 10.8 kpc .",
    "clusters / objects with these characteristics can play a very valuable role to distinguish between the two models of the metallicity variation in the galactic disk , advocated by friel ( 1995 ) and twarog et al .",
    "( 1997 ) respectively . however , the case of berkeley 32 is ambiguous .",
    "the parameters of berkeley 32 are compatible with both a smooth galactic metallicity gradient as well as with its membership of the cluster population of the inner domain of twarog et al .",
    "( 1997 ) .",
    "we also investigated the mass spectrum of berkeley 32 in the mass range 0.6 - 1.1 @xmath38 .",
    "a power - law fit returns @xmath46 for the slope of the mf , which is much flatter than the slopes found in young open clusters .",
    "berkeley 32 shares this behaviour with other old open clusters which indicates an evaporation of low - mass cluster stars .",
    "the suggestions / comments given by the referee randy l. phelps improved the presentation and readablity of the paper .",
