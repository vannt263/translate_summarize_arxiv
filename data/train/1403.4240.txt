    "interacting supernovae ( sne ) are stellar explosions that collide with dense circumstellar material ( csm ) produced by the progenitor star . these events are raising critical new questions about the final evolutionary phases of massive stars and the mass - loss episodes that ensue before core collapse ( smith & arnett 2014 ) .",
    "type - iin and ibn sne , in particular , are interacting sne that are characterized spectroscopically by the presence of relatively narrow emission lines of h and he in their spectra ( schlegel 1990 ; filippenko 1997 ; pastorello et al .",
    "2008 ) , which arise from dense csm that becomes illuminated by the shock between the fast moving sn ejecta and slower moving csm ( chevalier & fransson 1994 ) . as such , observations of interacting sne probe the stellar progenitor s pre - sn mass - loss history , providing valuable information on its final evolutionary episodes .",
    "various lines of evidence show that interacting sne require eruptive pre - sn mass loss that is reminiscent of luminous blue variable ( lbv ) stars , like @xmath9 car , although observations indicate a wide range of mass - loss properties ( e.g. , see the review by smith 2014 ) .",
    "the eruptions are often detectable as extragalactic transients , commonly referred to as ` sn impostors ' ( van dyk 2000 ; smith et al . 2011a ; kochanek et al .",
    "2012 ) , which can rival the luminosity of a sn and spectroscopically mimic sne  iin .",
    "although the observational distinction between interacting sne and sn impostors is not always clear , a direct link connecting these phenomena has been established for several objects .",
    "the progenitors of sn  2006jc and sn  2011ht were detected undergoing luminous outbursts 12  yr prior to their core - collapse explosions ( foley et al .",
    "2007 ; pastorello et al . 2008 ; fraser et al .",
    "sn  2010mc ( ofek et al .",
    "2013a ) was also detected 12 months before dramatically brightening , although for this case it appears that the precursor event may actually have been the initial phases of the sn caught unusually early ( smith , mauerhan , & prieto 2014 ) .",
    "perhaps the most interesting transient observed to have undergone multiple phases of eruptive mass loss is sn  2009ip .",
    "originally classified as a sn ( maza et al .",
    "2009 ) , this object was actually discovered during an lbv outburst  that is , as a sn  impostor ( smith et al . 2010 ; foley et al . 2011 ) .",
    "several years of continued activity were followed photometrically and spectroscopically , leading up to sn  2009ip s most extreme outburst in 2012 ( mauerhan et al .",
    "2013 ; prieto et al . 2013",
    "; levesque et al . 2014 ; smith et al . 2013b ; smith , mauerhan , & prieto 2014 ; pastorello et al . 2013 ; fraser et al . 2013b ; margutti et al .",
    "2014 ; graham et al .",
    "the 2012 event was comprised of two main components : the  2012a \" phase , marked by an initial peak at @xmath10 mag that lasted for just over 1 month ; and the  2012b \" phase , which began with a fast 10-day rise to a second peak of @xmath11 mag , followed by a bumpy decline down to a slowly declining floor in the light curve near @xmath12 mag .    based on spectral similarities with known core - collapse sne , mauerhan et al .",
    "( 2013a ) suggested that the relatively faint 2012a phase of sn  2009ip marked the initial stages of a core - collapse sn , while the subsequent 2012b brightening was the result of interaction between this sn and dense csm ejected during the earlier lbv outbursts .",
    "levesque et al .",
    "( 2014 ) also shared the view that the 2012b brightening was the result of interaction between the 2012a outflow and existing csm .",
    "however , several authors have suggested potential alternatives to a core collapse explosion  that sn  2009ip s 2012 evolution was possibly the result of one or more nonterminal outbursts ( pastorello et al .",
    "2013 ; fraser et al . 2013b",
    "; margutti et al . 2014 ) , perhaps caused by the pulsational pair - instability mechanism . the motivation for nonterminal scenarios has been based largely on the fact that the total radiated energy of the light curve ( @xmath13 erg ) can be explained by an explosion energy of @xmath14  ergs ( if spherical symmetry is assumed for the csm ) , and also because the late - time data were interpreted as looking different from what is expected for radioactive decay phases .",
    "more recently , smith , mauerhan & prieto ( 2014 ; hereafter smp14 ) showed that the 2012 light curve and spectral evolution are consistent with published models for core - collapse sne , which can be initially faint ( like sn  1987a ) owing to a relatively compact progenitor radius ( i.e. , a blue supergiant , as expected for an lbv , instead of a red supergiant ) , while the late - time characteristics could be explained if the mass of synthesized @xmath15ni was half that of sn  1987a .",
    "smp14 further argued that the radiated energy did not provide an argument against core collapse , since the csm is probably aspherical , leading to an inefficient conversion of kinetic energy into radiation . in line with the spectral modeling results and interpretation of levesque et al .",
    "( 2014 ) , which are consistent with a toroidal distribution of csm , smp14 also proposed a disk - like distribution of csm , but further argued that significant asphericity is required by the fact that broad photospheric lines are still seen at late times , even after strong csm interaction ends .",
    "this requires that a large fraction of the total solid angle of ejecta was able to expand unimpeded by csm .",
    "smp14 also pointed out that the @xmath16100-day persistence of broad photospheric lines requires a large ejecta mass of at least a few m@xmath17 , and is incompatible with a 0.1  m@xmath17 shell , which would become optically thin much more quickly .",
    "a mass of a few m@xmath17 moving at high speeds ( @xmath168000  km  s@xmath18 ) directly implies @xmath19  ergs of kinetic energy .    in the case of sne",
    "iin , the system geometry is critical if the total radiated energy from csm interaction is to be used to infer the kinetic energy of the sn explosion .",
    "fortunately , spectropolarimetry can yield important clues about the geometry of sne , allowing us to stringently test the hypothesis of aspherical csm . here , we report multi - epoch spectropolarimetry of the 2012 evolution of sn  2009ip , from the end of the initial 2012a phase , through the peak of 2012b , and later into its decline .",
    "the results unambiguously demonstrate that the source of bright continuum emission during the 2012b phase ( i.e. , the csm interaction zone ) was aspherical , consistent with a toroidal or disk - like distribution of csm proposed by smp14 and levesque et al .",
    "furthermore , the results indicate that the initial 2012a phase has a separate polarization component having an axis of symmetry that is distinct from 2012b , which implies that the 2012a event did not create the csm responsible for the 2012b brightening .",
    "diminishing polarization at late times , in addition to similarities in wavelength - dependent polarization across lines for sn  2009ip and other sne , provides additional evidence for a persistent underlying sn photosphere .",
    "altogether , the available evidence supports the hypothesis of a sn explosion for sn  2009ip in 2012 , and argues strongly against nonterminal explosion models for this object ( at least those proposed thus far ) .",
    "spectropolarimetric observations were obtained at the following facilities utilised by the university of arizona : the 6.5  m multiple mirror telescope ( mmt ) on mt .",

    "the efficiency of the waveplate as a function of wavelength was measured and corrected at all epochs by inserting a fully polarizing nicol prism into the beam above the slit .",
    "the orientation of the slit on the sky was always set to a position angle of @xmath27 , aligned along north - south . a series of four separate exposures that sample 16 orientations of the waveplate yields two independent , background - subtracted measures of each of the normalised linear stokes parameters , @xmath28 and @xmath29 . on some nights",
    "several such polarization sequences of sn  2009ip were obtained and combined , with the weighting of the individual measurements based on photon statistics .",
    "the instrumental polarization of spol and the kuiper , bok and mmt telescopes is extremely small ( @xmath30% ) , as measurements of unpolarized standard stars over the past two decades have consistently shown .",

    "several factors indicate that the isp in the direction of sn  2009ip must be very small , and should not significantly impact our polarimetry results and the physical interpretation that follows .",
    "first , the high - resolution vlt / fors2 flux spectrum on nov . 7 , shown in figure  [ fig : na ] , reveals the resolved components of galactic interstellar na  i  d absorption lines at 5890.1    and 5896.3   . the equivalent width ( ew ) of each component is a very small @xmath53  m , which implies a galactic @xmath54  mag ( munari & zwitter 1997 ) . according to serkowski et al .",
    "( 1975 ) , the value of @xmath55 can be used to derive an upper limit on galactic isp .",
    "the so - called serkowski relation is given by isp @xmath56 , which implies that isp @xmath30% in the direction of sn  2009ip .",
    "second , earlier photometric estimates of the total reddening toward the host galaxy ngc  7259 and sn  2009ip indicate a low value of @xmath57 mag ( schlegel et al .",
    "1998 ; smith et al . 2010 ; foley et al . 2011 ) , which implies that the host galaxy also does not produce substantial isp along the line of sight .",
    "this is also consistent with the lack of na  d absorption at the redshift of ngc  7259 ; in fact , na  d appears in weak emission , perhaps from a local h  ii region or from gas excited by sn radiation , with no indication of additional absorption components .",
    "the low host extinction is not particularly surprising , given sn  2009ip s large radial distance from the center of this nearly face - on spiral galaxy .",
    "if we were to naively apply the serkowski relation to the total measured reddening , we would obtain isp @xmath58% , still a very low value .",
    "however , as shown by leonard et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , the serkowski relation does not necessarily apply to all galaxies outside the milky way , as different dust properties can result in variable efficiencies for isp . nonetheless , the data strongly suggest a low value of total isp , which justifies our decision to make no attempt to remove it from the data , as its effect should be minor and not significantly impact our results .",

    "examining more closely the temporal evolution of sn  2009ip in the @xmath28@xmath29 plane , shown in figure  [ fig : pol_lc ] ( lower panel ) , the range of possible isp values constrained by the value of @xmath55 ( see  3.1 ) are illustrated by the radius of the black spot centered on the origin .",
    "it seems plausible that the path traced by @xmath28 and @xmath29 during dec .",
    "is the result of a migration back to the point of isp , somewhere near the origin .",
    "indeed , our latest measurement of the continuum polarization yielded @xmath74% from bok / spol for dec .",

    "6 ( @xmath79% , @xmath80 ) , which is consistent with the isp limits we have estimated . an alternative , and less likely possibility , is that @xmath28 and @xmath29 are destined to drift back to the location in quadrant  iv occupied by our earliest mmt / spol measurements in september ( i.e. , that the 2012a phase is intrinsically unpolarized , and instead reflects the location of isp ) . but such a large value of isp ( @xmath811% ) seems implausible given the constraints on isp indicated by the low values of @xmath55 and ew(na  d ) ; the structure in @xmath7 for the september epochs also does not follow a serkowski law , which is inconsistent with the 2012a polarization being the result of isp .",
    "furthermore , it would be a rather remarkable coincidence for the position angle of isp to be orthogonal to the polarization axis of sn  2009ip at peak .",
    "therefore , the evidence is strong that our earliest polarization detections from mmt / spol in september reveal true polarization intrinsic to the source during the 2012a phase , and that the isp is within @xmath58% of the origin , and likely @xmath82% , as indicated by our latest continuum measurement .",
    "as one can see , any value of isp within this allowable range will affect our results only slightly , and will not change the fact that the 2012a and 2012b phases appear to have two separate components of polarization that will remain roughly orthogonal between 2012a and the peak of 2012b , no matter where the isp lies within the range illustrated by figure  [ fig : pol_lc ] ( lower panel ) .",
    "the most natural explanation for linear polarization of a sn is thomson scattering by free electrons , either from the sn photosphere or within the zone of intense csm interaction , which includes the forward shock , the reverse shock , and the cold dense shell ( cds ) in between . for most sne  iin , including sn  2009ip , evidence of electron scattering is also indicated by the broad lorentzian wings typically seen at the bases of the intermediate - width emission - line profiles ( chugai et al .",
    "2001 ; smith et al . 2008 ; dessart et al . 2009 ) .",
    "but in the case of scattered photons emerging from a spherically symmetric distribution of material , the sum of all electric vectors will cancel out and yield zero net polarization .",
    "thus , the detection of net polarization from any sn directly implies aspherical structure , either intrinsic or imposed from partial obscuration of the polarized surface by intervening material ( see wang & wheeler 2008 for a review on sn polarization ) .",
    "core - collapse sne of type ii - p have been observed to be weak sources of polarization while in their plateau phases , which implies that the outer layer of ejecta is roughly spherical in some cases .",
    "however , near the end of their plateaus , sne ii - p can exhibit brief but significant increases in polarization ( leonard et al . 2000 , 2006 ; chornock et al .",
    "2010 ) , because as the ejecta cool and recombine the photosphere recedes from the spherical outer layers of h - rich material into more aspherical he - rich and metal - rich layers deeper inside the ejecta .",
    "thus , to first order , sne ii - p can be characterized by a single component of photospheric polarization that scales inversely with the decreasing luminosity .",
    "sne  iin , on the other hand , appear to exhibit a high degree of polarization while in their brightest phases , at least for the few objects that have been studied in sufficient detail ( e.g. , leonard et al .",
    "2001 ; hoffman et al .",
    "this implies that csm interaction luminosity must be a major source of the net polarization from sne  iin . in this case , since both the sn photosphere and the csm interaction zone are potential sources of polarized photons , changes in the relative luminosities of these components can lead to variations in net polarization , even if the fractional polarization and position angles of each component remain constant with time .",
    "below , we propose this to be the case for sn  2009ip .",
    "sn  2009ip s photospheric component is made evident by its spectropolarimetric similarities with the type iib sn  1993j , shown in figure  [ fig:93j ] . near peak brightness , both sne exhibit a comparable degree of polarization across the optical band , with sn  2009ip being stronger in the continuum , and they both display remarkably similar wavelength - dependent variations across their polarization spectra , particularly evident at wavelengths of 52007000   . in the case of sn  1993j , these variations are associated with the broad p - cygni lines of h@xmath67 and he  i@xmath39na  d , and the same is probably true for sn  2009ip .",
    "the variations are produced by the depolarizing effect of line scattering ( trammell et al .",
    "1993 ; hflich 1995 ; hflich et al .",
    "1996 ; tran et al .",
    "this is not to be confused with the intrinsically unpolarized recombination emission from the outer optically thin csm that we see in sn  2009ip , which dilutes the polarized continuum and results in relatively narrow  absorption \" features of polarization for the h@xmath67 and h@xmath68 lines .",
    "rather , true depolarization is important for the broad emission lines that develop in the ionised ejecta above the electron - scattering photosphere of the sn .",
    "the persistence of these lines in sn  2009ip for @xmath16100 days implies a massive amount of high - velocity material ( a few m@xmath17 ) , consistent with a sn outflow ( see smp14 ) .",
    "csm is also a potential contributor to the polarization properties of sn  1993j ( hflich et al .",
    "1996 ; tran et al .",
    "1997 ) , via electron scattering within a sn / csm interaction zone and/or the scattering of photons by dust .",
    "after all , the continuum polarization of sn  1993j being entirely due to an aspherical ejecta photosphere is somewhat difficult to reconcile with the evolution of a highly spherical radio remnant revealed by vlbi ( bietenholz , bartel , & rupen 2003 ) , although this structure might only trace the morphology of the outermost h - rich layers , not the more asymmetric he - rich layers potentially responsible for the polarized continuum .",
    "still , the source did exhibit evidence for pre - existing csm at early times , in the form of narrow emission - line features exhibiting small velocity widths of @xmath16170  km  s@xmath18 , indicative of an ambient stellar wind ( benetti et al .",
    "1994 ) . however , these features were less pronounced than those of sn  2009ip and lasted for a shorter amount of time , indicating a much less dense csm .",
    "sn  1993j s x - ray properties were also indicative of csm interaction ( leising et al 1994 ) , while its radio evolution indicated a changing pre - sn mass - loss rate in the range @xmath83@xmath84  yr@xmath18 ( van dyk et al .",
    "1994 ) , which , although roughly 100 times weaker than the pre - sn mass - loss rate inferred for sn  2009ip ( ofek et al .",
    "2013b ) , could generate enough csm to influence the object s polarization properties .    therefore , like sn  2009ip , sn  1993j could have two components of polarization  photospheric and csm interaction . in the case of sn  2009ip",
    ", however , it appears rather obvious that csm interaction is the dominant source of polarization near photometric peak .",
    "the opposite could be true for sn  1993j : its polarization could be dominated by an aspherical explosion and only moderately influenced by the csm component . in this regard ,",
    "a noteworthy difference between the two sne is that near peak brightness sn  1993j exhibits more variation than sn  2009ip in @xmath6 as a function of wavelength , suggesting that sn  2009ip has a more highly ordered axis of symmetry in 2012b resulting from its luminous and highly aspherical csm interaction zone . by 5060 days after peak , however , both sne exhibit remarkable similarity in @xmath7 and @xmath6 as a function of wavelength .",
    "it appears that as csm interaction fades after the peak of 2012b and the broad p - cygni lines return by nov .",
    "6 , the polarization characteristics of sn  2009ip begin to look more like a sn photosphere again .",
    "it is thus interesting that the source makes a pronounced shift in position angle on nov .",
    "6 , associated with the obvious bump in the light curve ( see figure  [ fig : pol_lc ] ) , which could represent the temporary brightening of the photospheric component of polarization that dominated the 2012a phase .      taken at face value , sn  2009ip s degree of peak polarization for the 2012a and 2012b phases ( from @xmath1% to @xmath85% ) indicates respective axial ratios of @xmath600.85 and @xmath600.7 for the aspherical source ( @xmath8615% and @xmath8630% asphericity ) , if we assume that polarization translates directly to the apparent geometry via comparison with the oblate electron - scattering atmosphere models of hlfich ( 1995 ) .",
    "however , the true physical axial ratios could be substantially more aspherical than these limits , for two key reasons : ( 1 ) inclination angle , and ( 2 ) partial cancellation between the 2012a and 2012b polarization vector components . if both the 2012a peak and the late decline of the 2012b phase ( from the nov .",
    "67 bump onward ) are dominated by the sn photosphere component , as appears to be the case , then partial cancellation could be particularly important for the 2012b peak .",
    "indeed , the @xmath59 shift in position angle between the earliest 2012a observation and the peak of the 2012b phase implies two separate components of polarization that are roughly orthogonal to one another . since orthogonal polarization vectors cancel , the degree of intrinsic polarization for the 2012b component must be higher than it appears ( i.e. , even more aspherical ) , because the orthogonality of the separate 2012a vector component , if still present during 2012b , will partially cancel the 2012b component .    we can estimate the true intrinsic polarization of the 2012b peak component as follows . if we rotate the @xmath28@xmath29 values from figure  [ fig : pol_lc ] such that they are aligned with the axis of symmetry at maximum polarization ( @xmath87 ) , which roughly traces the average axis of symmetry for the entirety of 2012b , then the majority of polarization during the 2012b phase is shifted onto the positive @xmath28 axis , while the orthogonal 2012a polarization gets shifted onto the negative @xmath28 axis .",
    "figure  [ fig : rsp ] shows the evolution of the resulting rotated stokes parameters .",
    "the @xmath88 curve represents variations along the main axis of symmetry , while @xmath89 traces deviations from the average axis of symmetry .",
    "the result implies that if the 2012a component maintains its orthogonal contribution to the total electric vector during 2012b , then the separation between the 2012a and 2012b components will approximately define the true degree of intrinsic polarization for the 2012b peak , which , therefore , could be as high as @xmath162.6% . in this case ,",
    "comparison with the models of hlfich ( 1991 ) would imply a more highly aspherical axial ratio of @xmath900.6 for the 2012b component ( @xmath8640%50% asphericity ) . considering the additional effect of a @xmath91 inclination angle , hypothetically , it is possible that the intrinsic geometry of the 2012b component is a highly flattened one .",
    "below we discuss a plausible geometric scenario for sn  2009ip s 2012 evolution , facilitated by figures  [ fig : cartoon1 ] and [ fig : cartoon2 ] .    ) .",
    "the plot is meant to illustrate the full possible degree of intrinsic polarization for the 2012b component ( @xmath162.6% ) , after considering the effect of the partial cancellation , roughly orthogonal 2012a vector component ( see  4.1.2).,width=316 ]    for the 2012b component of polarization the situation appears relatively clear . since csm interaction dominates the luminosity during this phase , and since the associated polarization source exhibits a rather steady and well - defined axis of symmetry , the net polarization must reflect the physical structure of the dense csm , which in this case could represent a toroidal geometry ( a disk or ring ) . toroidal geometry for the interacting csm",
    "has already been suggested for sn  2009ip by levesque et al .",
    "( 2014 ) , based on spectral modeling and analysis of the balmer emission lines .",
    "those authors found that the h@xmath67 emission during the peak of 2012b requires a total radiating area of @xmath1620,000  au@xmath92 , while the balmer decrement requires a high csm density of @xmath93  @xmath94 , for case - b recombination ( note that such a high density would naturally explain the absence of forbidden emission lines in sn  2009ip s spectrum ) .",
    "the combination of high density and large area implies a flattened geometry ( i.e. , a disk / ring ) , possibly as thin as 10 au .",
    "alternatively , a lower density csm of @xmath95  @xmath94 in a limb - brightened spherical shell configuration was also proposed by levesque et al .",
    "( 2014 ) as an additional possibility , although less favourably because it requires that the optical depth of h@xmath68 be lower than for h@xmath67 , which would be unusual .",
    "independently , smp14 also favoured disk - like geometry for the csm based on energetic arguments and on the persistence of broad p - cygni lines even after the phase of intense csm interaction had declined , which implies that a large fraction of the ejecta did not decelerate and , thus , must not have participated in strong csm interaction ( toroidal geometry would allow a large fraction of the ejected mass to bypass strong csm interaction in directions orthogonal to the csm plane ) .",
    "our spectropolarimetric results are consistent with toroidal geometry for the csm around sn  2009ip , and contradict models that invoke spherical distributions of csm . in this case , the axial ratio of the polarized emission source at the peak of 2012b ( constrained to @xmath96 , and probably @xmath600.6 ; see  4.1.2 ) is consistent with toroidal geometry tilted at some intermediate inclination angle with respect to our line of sight .",
    "the spectropolarimetric evolution is _ inconsistent _ with some physical scenarios previously proposed as possibilities for sn  2009ip s 2012 evolution . since it is the csm geometry that determines the polarization properties at the peak of the interaction phase , then the earlier eruption that produced such csm should reflect the same geometry .",
    "thus , the orthogonal position angle shift we observe between 2012a and the peak of 2012b is not compatible with the interpretation that these respective phases represent the launching and collision of successive shells of csm ( e.g. , from pair - instability eruptions ) , a possibility suggested by other authors ( pastorello et al .",
    "2013 ; margutti et al .",
    "2014 ) , since such a scenario should result in similar axes of symmetry for the two phases , not orthogonal geometries .",
    "rather , the orthogonality between the 2012a and 2012b events implies a physically distinct origin for each of the associated outflows .",
    "in addition , the large shift in polarization and position angle between the 2012b peak and the subsequent bump in the declining light curve on nov .",
    "67 also suggests that the bump is the result of a polarized luminosity component that is separate from that of the 2012b peak  for example , the sn photospheric component brightening again as the csm interaction component fades away .",
    "this is inconsistent with the interpretation that the bump in the light curve is the result of a fluctuating central source that variably illuminates the csm , such as activity from a central surviving star , as proposed by martin et al .",
    "( 2013 ) .",
    "toroidal csm geometry would not be unique to sn  2009ip ; it has been proposed before for other sne iin , specifically in the cases of sn  1988z ( chugai & danziger 1994 , their model b ) , sn  1998s ( leonard et al . 2000 ) , and sn  1997eg ( hoffman et al .",
    "this type of geometry is also unsurprising in the context of sn  2009ip s stellar progenitor , since rings and tori are common phenomena around lbvs , b[e ] supergiants , and other evolved massive stars ( smith , bally , & walawender 2007 ; smith et al .",
    "not at all clear , however , is the connection of such geometry to the erratic behaviour of sn  2009ip over the last decade .",

    "2001 ) . alternatively ,",
    "net polarization from the 2012a phase could also arise if the near side of the soon - to - be - shocked toroidal csm is partially blocking the waist of the sn photosphere ( figure  [ fig : cartoon1 ] , inset ) , which could result in a polarization axis that is orthogonal to 2012b if the polarized poles of the photosphere remain relatively unobscured .",
    "finally , scattering of the sn photons by dust in the outer csm could provide another source of polarized photons .",
    "after all , infrared data obtained during the 2012a phase show strong evidence for circumstellar dust at a radius of @xmath16120220  au ( smith et al .",
    "we note that the strength of sn  2009ip s blue continuum detected at the same time indicates that the central source is probably not completely enshrouded by the dusty component , which is consistent with the toroidal geometry inferred for the csm .",
    "however , if dust scattering from the dense csm were an important source of polarized flux during 2012a , we would expect the geometric axis during this phase to reflect that of 2012b rather than being orthogonal to it .",
    "thus , electron scattering within the sn photosphere appears to be the most plausible explanation as the dominant source of polarized photons during 2012a , with net polarization either being the result of bipolar geometry for the photosphere or partial blocking of its waist by the toroidal csm .",
    "if strong csm interaction is confined to a toroidal geometry , then large amounts of high - velocity sn ejecta could expand relatively unimpeded .",
    "this is already indicated by the persistence of the broad p - cygni lines ( smp14 ) , but could also explain some of the higher - order effects we see in the spectropolarimetric data .",

    "67 ( figure  [ fig : qu_line1 ] ) is an indication of high - velocity material .",
    "this feature has a blueshifted velocity of 13,000  km  s@xmath18 , while the position angle across the feature approximately follows along the main axis of symmetry of this epoch in the @xmath28@xmath29 plane .",
    "the fact that the peak of the enhanced polarization feature is not coincident with the flux minimum of the absorption line implies that the enhancement can not simply be the result of absorption of unpolarized or less polarized flux ( which would increase the fractional polarization at that wavelength ) .",
    "rather , the net blueshift probably results from an intervening layer of fast he - rich ( or na - rich ) material that lies near the outer edge of the ejecta and is _ partially _ absorbing the inner polarized continuum . from the point of view of the observer , such partial blocking can increase the net polarization over that range of velocities by interfering with the cancellation of orthogonal polarization vectors distributed across the polarized source ( e.g. , also see kasen et al .",
    "the high - velocity he / na  d - rich material was probably launched during the sn in 2012a phase , while the csm responsible for the 2012b phase was likely to have been created by the lbv progenitor eruptions during the years prior ( e.g. , see graham et al .",

    "taking the 2012a explosion time of @xmath100 days , suggested by smp14 , and the fastest ejecta velocity of 13,000  km  s@xmath18 indicated by the blue edge of the h@xmath67 p - cygni line during 2012a , implies a radial distance of @xmath16350 au from the point of explosion to the inner edge of the dense csm ; this is consistent with the limits on the minimum radius of the dust component inferred from infrared measurements during 2012a ( @xmath86120  au ; smith et al .",
    "2013b ) , and with the 300  au radial estimates by levesque et al .",
    "the latter authors showed that the csm need only be @xmath1610  au thick to explain the h@xmath67 luminosity in the toroidal scenario .",
    "for a 10  au toroidal scale height , the 300350 au distance from the explosion would imply a very small subtended angle of @xmath101 for the csm from the point of view of the explosion . such a configuration inclined at an angle of 3545@xmath31 with respect to our line of sight ( from edge - on )",
    "would appear as an ellipse on the sky having an axial ratio that is consistent with the geometric constraints placed by the value of peak polarization during 2012b ( see  4.1.2 ) .",
    "for such a small subtended angle of csm , the fraction of the total explosion solid angle ( @xmath102/4@xmath103 ) intercepted by csm will be only 23% ( @xmath6010% conservatively ) .",
    "this minor amount of interacting area will result in an inefficient conversion of the total kinetic energy of the sn into radiation .",
    "thus , the @xmath104  ergs of kinetic energy inferred from the radiated energy of the explosion by fraser et al .",
    "( 2013 ) and margutti et al .",
    "( 2014 ) , both of whom assume a spherical csm configuration in their calculations , must be a significant underestimate , by 1 dex or more .",
    "a kinetic energy of @xmath19  ergs , as suggested by smp14 , seems more likely , given the demand for aspherical csm by spectropolarimetry .",
    "one must also keep in mind that the shape of the explosion is an influential factor as well . a bipolar explosion , which we have shown is a plausible geometry for the 2012a outflow , will intersect even less area of the toroidal csm .",
    "if the material is clumpy , then the effective intersecting area could be even lower than we have estimated , implying an even lower efficiency conversion of kinetic energy into radiation .",
    "we have presented multi - epoch spectropolarimetry of the 2012 outburst of sn  2009ip , covering the 2012a and 2012b phases .",
    "since the available data imply a very low amount of interstellar absorption and isp @xmath58% , we have not attempted to remove isp in our analysis .",
    "this could potentially lead to some small systematic errors in our results , although we expect any such changes will be minor and will not significantly influence our interpretation .",
    "the degree of polarization at the peak of 2012b implies an approximate axial ratio of @xmath600.7 ( probably @xmath600.6 ) for the polarized csm , which is consistent with the toroidal distribution of material suggested previously ( smp14 ; levesque et al .",
    "2014 ) . in the future ,",
    "modeling of the polarization properties of shocked toroidal csm could reveal how well the comparison to the oblate electron - scattering atmosphere models of hfilch ( 1991 ) can characterise the axial ratio of such geometry .",
    "details aside , the spectropolarimetric results demand substantial asphericity for the source of the 2012b luminosity and are thus inconsistent with models for sn  2009ip s 2012 explosion that invoke a spherical distribution of csm ( fraser et al .",
    "2013 ; margutti et al . 2014 ) .",
    "for the 2012a phase , the detection of significant polarization at a position angle that is nearly orthogonal to 2012b is consistent with a bipolar geometry for the sn outflow or partial obscuration of a potentially more spherical sn photosphere by the toroidal csm . in any case , the orthogonality is inconsistent with the launching and collision of successive shells of csm ( pastorello et al . 2012 ) generated @xmath10540 days apart ( margutti et al .",
    "2014 ) , since such a scenario should produce similar axes of symmetry for the 2012a and 2012b phases , not orthogonal geometries .",
    "furthermore , the geometric parameters constrained by spectropolarimetry imply that only a small fraction of the sn ejecta ( @xmath6010% ) participated in strong interaction with the toroidal csm . therefore , earlier estimates of a @xmath104  ergs explosion that are based on the total radiated energy , which assume spherical symmetry for the csm ( fraser et al .",
    "2013 ; margutti et al . 2014 ) , are likely to be substantially underestimated by an order of magnitude .",
    "the strong similarities between sn  2009ip and sn  1993j , from the time near their peak through their decline , provide another strong line of evidence for the existence of an underlying sn photosphere from high - velocity ejecta ( 50008000  km  s@xmath18 ) that persists throughout sn  2009ip s 2012 evolution ( @xmath16100 days ) .",
    "such a long - lasting optically thick component indicates a mass of at least a few m@xmath17 for the fast outer component of the ejecta , and the associated speeds imply a kinetic energy of @xmath19  ergs for the ejecta , as suggested by smp14 .",
    "after peak polarization , higher - order structure in the @xmath28@xmath29 plane from he - i / na  d indicates the presence of fast metal - rich ejecta that have overrun the dense csm , consistent with a high - velocity flow that bypassed intense csm interaction .",
    "meanwhile , the weakening of polarization with declining continuum flux at late times suggests that the diminishing intensity of electron scattering is responsible for the decline in polarization .",
    "the fact that the flux and polarization drop more rapidly for sn  2009ip relative to other sne  iin , such as sn  1997eg ( hoffman et al .",
    "2008 ) or sn",
    "2010jl ( grant williams , 2014 , private communication ) , also suggests that the csm around sn  2009ip has a compact configuration , compared to these other explosions .",
    "the lines of evidence presented here thus favour a scenario first proposed by mauerhan et al .",
    "( 2013 ) , in which the luminosity of the 2012a phase of sn  2009ip was the result of a @xmath19  ergs explosion ( i.e. , a core - collapse sn ) that subsequently plowed into an aspherical ( probably toroidal ) distribution of csm during 2012b , creating the jump in luminosity and the strong polarization of the source .",
    "nonterminal scenarios are difficult to support in light of the current body of evidence , and we would have to invent a process capable of generating ejecta having @xmath19  ergs of kinetic energy without destroying the star . still , the best evidence of progenitor death is a vanishing of the star at late times .",
    "however , csm interaction can persist for decades or more , and generate enough luminosity to make progenitor disappearance a difficult observable to confirm .",
    "sn  1961v is a particularly controversial example ( filippenko et al . 1995 ; chu et al . 2004 ; smith et al . 2011b ; kochanek et al .",
    "2011 ; van dyk et al .",
    "moreover , it is very plausible that the progenitor of sn  2009ip s 2012 explosion left a massive companion at the explosion site , not only because massive stars are rarely solitary ( sana et al .",
    "2012 ) , but because toroidal or disk - like geometry for the csm is suggestive of binary influence . as discussed by smith  &  arnett ( 2014 ) , repeated brief pre - sn eruptions could result from binary interaction if the primary suddenly increases its radius during late nuclear burning stages , thereby triggering binary interaction and mass ejection . finally , we note that strong net polarization consistently observed from sne iin , as a class , implies that csm interaction is a dominanting influence on their polarization properties , and that an aspherical distribution of csm is a commonplace feature of the stellar progenitors of these explosions .",
