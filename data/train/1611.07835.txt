    "the purpose of this paper is to propose a simple approach for studying the ground state or the thermal state of a quantum system .",
    "it will be argued that it is often convenient to deal with the _ phase - space _ formalism in terms of generalized coordinates and momenta , rather than with the _ bosonic _ formalism using creation / annihilation operators .",
    "the self - consistent harmonic approximation  @xcite ( scha ) , which is based on the frequency renormalization arising from nonlinear interactions and aims at the best harmonic approximation of the density matrix of the nonlinear system , can indeed be well formulated by means of phase - space variables .",
    "the treatment of interacting systems is indeed simpler by working with ( real ) @xmath0-numbers in the place of ( hermitian ) operators , namely using their ` weyl symbols ' .",
    "the main reason why weyl ordering of quantum operators and the corresponding symbols  @xcite have been employed is in that they naturally relate quantum systems to their classical counterparts , which makes them very useful on the ` semiclassical ' side .",
    "a well - known example is the wigner distribution function  @xcite , which is the weyl symbol for the thermal - equilibrium density operator : it has the captivating property that it can be used in familiar classical formulas , e.g. , the averages of observables ( of course , with proper caveats )",
    ". however , weyl symbols can be helpful also on the ` quantum ' side , namely for problems that are usually faced in terms of bosonic operators . since most",
    "often the starting point is a normal - ordered hamiltonian , it is useful to recall  @xcite and derive ( new ) relations connecting normal symbols with weyl symbols .",
    "furthermore , the choice of working in the phase - space formalism is motivated by the observation that bogoliubov transformations , which are ubiquitous when dealing with harmonic approximations , arise more naturally than in the boson - operator formalism .",
    "this is clearly evident even in the simplest implementation for a single degree of freedom , @xmath1 , where the transformation @xmath2 ( canonical , as @xmath3=1 $ ] ) , puts into normal form hamiltonians such as @xmath4 the parameter @xmath5 and the proper frequency @xmath6 are found by replacing   in the last line and finding two equations , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , whose solution eventually yields @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "however , no algebraic calculations are needed in terms of phase - space operators : the proper frequency arises immediately , since @xmath11 is just a harmonic oscillator , which makes also evident why it must be @xmath12 .",
    "when many degrees of freedom are involved , the phase - space formalism allows one to use ordinary linear canonical transformations in the place of multidimensional bogoliubov transformations : the latter involve ` para - unitary ' matrices  @xcite and are definitely more complicated , although equivalent  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the phase - space approach is markedly convenient for nanosystems , since translation symmetry can not be invoked in order to reduce the required transformations within fourier channels with few degrees of freedom , as it is commonly made for the corresponding bulk counterparts .    of course",
    ", if in the hamiltonian momenta and coordinates are separated in a kinetic and a potential part ( _ standard _ hamiltonian ) , working in phase space seems to be obvious , since linear canonical transformations reduce to orthogonal transformations ; nevertheless , for such systems many textbooks and papers use the bosonic approach and reformulate the hamiltonian in terms of creation / annihilation operators .",
    "as remarked above , this makes little difference when translation symmetry holds , as , e.g. , in the study of crystal - lattice vibrations .",
    "however , the category also includes finite and/or disordered assemblies of atoms or molecules , and for them the phase - space scha can be more conveniently used ; a typical example where it constitutes a viable alternative to heavier quantum numerical approaches  @xcite is the task of finding the ground - state of a molecular cluster ( such as a protein model ) : the scha renormalization of classical relative - minimum configurations permits to recognize the quantum energy minimum , namely the true ground state . on the other hand ,",
    "several condensed matter hamiltonians are formulated from the very beginning in terms of creation / annihilation operators . among them , those describing cold atoms in optical lattices , which have become a training ground where the interactions can be engineered to simulate old and new quantum mechanical systems  @xcite ; for bosonic degrees of freedom , many variants of the bose - hubbard model can be realized , whose study can be performed by means of phase - space weyl symbols and scha .",
    "the same approach is particularly useful for magnetic systems , i.e. , assemblies of spins interacting in whatever way  @xcite , from short chains of spins in ring - shaped molecules , to short open magnetic chains that can result from impurities in quasi - one - dimensional magnetic materials .",
    "an antiferromagnetic model is chosen in this paper in order to exemplify the application of the method . extended quantum system often show _ quantum _ phase transitions , corresponding to qualitative ground - state changes that occur while varying a parameter of the hamiltonian .",
    "it is to be remarked that in several cases , as in the paradigmatic transverse - field ising model  @xcite , these changes are related to a transition between different minima of the corresponding classical system , so the quantum phase diagram can be obtained in a semiclassical way  @xcite .",
    "also frustrated systems can be faced ; e.g , in ref .",
    "one finds an example of ` quantum stabilization ' of a classically unstable phase , namely the magnetization plateau in the phase diagram of the 2d @xmath13-@xmath14 frustrated antiferromagnet : the theory follows a creation / annihilation - operator approach on few fourier channels for a bulk system : in the case of a finite sample , the approach proposed here would be equivalent , but more convenient .    in section  [ s.normal-weyl ] the definition of normal and weyl symbols",
    "is recalled , along with some properties and useful formulas .",
    "then , in section  [ s.scha ] , the reduction of a generic quadratic hamiltonian to the normal form introduces the self - consistent harmonic approximation ( scha ) . in order to exemplify how the method applies , in section  [ s.spinflopbulk ] the so - called spin - flop transition in a bulk heisenberg antiferromagnet ( afm )",
    "is studied , reproducing long - known results  @xcite .",
    "the more interesting case of application to a nanosystem is considered in section[s.spinflopfinite ] , namely an antiferromagnetic chain with an _ odd _ number of spins , which displays a peculiar kind of antiferromagnetic phase for low magnetic field , arising from the zeeman energy gain due to one unbalanced spin , and a spin - flop phase at higher field : establishing the robustness of the ordered phase against quantum fluctuations is a nontrivial achievement . a few closing remarks are eventually drawn in section  [ s.conclusions ] .",
    "consider the position and momentum operators @xmath15 and @xmath16 , with @xmath17=i\\hbar$ ] . in the following @xmath18",
    "is not explicitly written , except when significant .",
    "every operator @xmath19 acting on the corresponding hilbert space is a function of @xmath16 and @xmath15 which can be expressed as @xmath20 then , the weyl symbol @xmath21 for @xmath19 is univocally defined  @xcite as the @xmath0-number function in phase - space @xmath22 the fourier transform nature of this definition ensures that it has an inverse , so that there is a one - to - one correspondence between operators and phase - space functions .",
    "in particular , the weyl symbols for @xmath16 and @xmath15 are @xmath23 and @xmath24 . from the baker - hausdoff formula one has @xmath25 , which allows one to find the well - known definition of the weyl symbol in terms of matrix elements , @xmath26 weyl symbols for hermitian operators are real and",
    "their most popular property is the trace formula , @xmath27 if the generic operator @xmath28 is a density matrix , e.g. , at thermal equilibrium , then @xmath29 is the wigner distribution function and eq .",
    "is the classical expression for the expectation value of an observable .",
    "for instance , if @xmath30 then @xmath31 and the expectation value of @xmath19 is @xmath32 .",
    "the trace formula does not generalize to the product of three or more operators ; the weyl symbol for the product of two operators is the product of their weyl symbols only if they commute , otherwise one has to use the ` star product '  @xcite .",
    "several physical hamiltonians are given in normally ordered form , i.e. , with all creation operators on the left side : their normal symbols are simply obtained by replacing @xmath33 and @xmath34 with the holomorphic variables @xmath35 and @xmath36 . in other cases one deals with operators depending on the number operator @xmath37 ,",
    "say @xmath38 , whose normal symbol can be written as  @xcite @xmath39 that s why explicit relations between weyl and normal symbols are generally very useful . the definition of the weyl symbol for an operator @xmath19 through eqs .   and has an equivalent in terms of the holomorphic variables , @xmath36 and @xmath35 , @xmath40 this can be compared with the ` normal symbol ' @xmath41 for @xmath19 , obtained when all creation operators appear on the left side , @xmath42 indeed , since @xmath43 , it follows that @xmath44 inserting this in eq .",
    "one can write a formal identity @xmath45 let us introduce a gaussian distribution @xmath46 for the holomorphic variables @xmath47 ; it is fully defined by the averages @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 . using the identity @xmath51 to express the relation   inside   and  ,",
    "one finds other integral expressions relating the symbols : @xmath52 the identities   and   are very useful for obtaining weyl symbols : let us see two examples .      for @xmath53 , it is @xmath54 and eq .",
    "yields the weyl symbol @xmath55 ; this is trivial in terms of phase - space symbols . let us also derive the weyl symbol for the ( non - normalized ) density matrix @xmath56 at the equilibrium temperature @xmath57 . using eq .",
    "one finds the normal symbol @xmath58 , where @xmath59 and @xmath60 ; then use eq .  :",
    "@xmath61 where @xmath62 .",
    "it is then easy matter to get @xmath63 and the final result @xmath64 the partition function @xmath65 correctly follows .      for an operator @xmath66 , taking the fourier expansion @xmath67 and applying eq .",
    "gives @xmath68 using eq .   and",
    "setting @xmath69 @xmath70 when @xmath71 is smooth , the main contribution comes from small values of @xmath72 , so @xmath73 the above derivation is easily generalized to more general operators , for instance if @xmath74 then @xmath75",
    "as remarked in the introduction , for a linear system with @xmath76 degrees of freedom it is easier to perform canonical phase - space transformations , belonging to the symplectic group @xmath77 , rather than bogoliubov transformations  @xcite on the bosonic operators , which belong to the pseudo - unitary group @xmath78 . of course , the two kinds of transformations are in one - to - one correspondence , as proven in ref .  .",
    "while the classification of the possible normal forms of quadratic hamiltonians is a well - established subject  @xcite , the aim here is at giving a simplified approach for dealing with physical hamiltonians , which have properties such as being bounded from below and being smooth in the neighborhood of their minima , where a quadratic expansion fits the local energy landscape .",
    "therefore , in this section an operative procedure is introduced for deriving the linear canonical transformation that reduces to a typical normal form a sufficiently general quadratic hamiltonian for @xmath79 degrees of freedom . without loss of generality",
    ", one can work in terms of weyl symbols and deal with the classical quadratic form @xmath80 where the vector notation , @xmath81 and @xmath82 , is used , with @xmath83 and @xmath84 symmetric real positive - definite @xmath85 matrices , and @xmath86 a real @xmath85 matrix .",
    "this hamiltonian has to have a lower bound and its normal form can be obtained in a few steps .",
    "first , one calculates the positive square - root @xmath87 of @xmath83 ; operatively , one diagonalizes @xmath83 with an orthogonal matrix @xmath88 , i.e. , @xmath89 where the diagonal matrix @xmath90 contains the positive square - roots of the eigenvalues of @xmath83 ; hence , @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "the transformation @xmath93 is canonical provided that the matrix @xmath94 be symmetric : this is a constraint to be required in order to reduce the hamiltonian to a sum of harmonic oscillators .",
    "@xcite alternatively , one can exchange the role of coordinates and momenta and require ( or check ) the symmetry of @xmath95 .",
    "the hamiltonian takes the form @xmath96 $ ] .",
    "we have then to diagonalize the symmetric real matrix @xmath97 with an orthogonal @xmath98 , @xmath99 eventually , performing the canonical transformation @xmath100 the hamiltonian is expressed in terms of independent harmonic - oscillator modes , @xmath101 the linearity of the transformation   ensures that it also holds for the corresponding operators , @xmath102 and @xmath103 , whose weyl symbols are just @xmath104 and @xmath105 . the inverse of eq .   is @xmath106 where for shortness of notation the new matrices @xmath107 and",
    "@xmath108 are defined such that @xmath109 .",
    "it is now easy to express the correlators of the original variables @xmath110 and @xmath111 in terms of the simple correlators of @xmath104 and @xmath105 . indeed , assuming the system to be in equilibrium at the temperature @xmath112 , one has @xmath113 where @xmath114 the frequencies @xmath115 being the positive square roots of the eigenvalues @xmath116 ; in matrix notation @xmath117 . the same equalities hold for the operators corresponding to the weyl symbols . in the classical limit @xmath118 one",
    "recovers the equipartition theorem , @xmath119 .",
    "conversely , in the ground state ( @xmath120 ) one has @xmath121 , i.e. , the zero - point fluctuations of a harmonic oscillator .    for the original momenta and coordinates , the inverse transformation gives the correlators @xmath122 which can be written as a sum over @xmath72-components , for instance @xmath123 it has to be emphasized that these correlators fully define the density matrix ( of the ground- or thermal - equilibrium state ) or , equivalently , its weyl symbol , which is a gaussian distribution in phase space : @xmath124    this means that all higher - order correlators can be expressed in terms of the above ones .",
    "in the zero - temperature case , @xmath125 , one has the ground - state fluctuations @xmath126 note that for @xmath127 , as @xmath128 , one finds the minumum heisenberg s uncertainty , @xmath129 the transformations considered in this section are easily implemented numerically for systems with few degrees of freedom , as they only involve real matrices and diagonalizations of real symmetric matrices .",
    "this is a well established starting point for implementing a procedure that accounts for the interaction , i.e. , non - quadratic terms in the hamiltonian .",
    "it is easy to explain what underlies the idea of the scha .",
    "take for instance a single classical particle of unit mass in a one - dimensional potential @xmath130 which has its minimum in @xmath131 , say @xmath132 .",
    "for nonzero temperature , the exact ( non normalized ) coordinate distribution is given by @xmath133 .",
    "for very low temperature it makes sense to approximate @xmath134 , yielding a gaussian distribution : this is the harmonic approximation ( ha ) . at higher temperature thermal fluctuations",
    "become larger and it becomes much better to use a ` trial ' harmonic potential @xmath135 with the associated gaussian distribution @xmath136 , such that @xmath137 , where @xmath138 denotes the average with the gaussian distribution @xmath139 .",
    "the parameters @xmath140 , @xmath141 , and @xmath142 can be determined variationally , by minimizing the r.h.s . of the bogoliubov inequality ,",
    "@xmath143 this minimization is equivalent to requiring that @xmath130 and @xmath144 have the same trial averages , together with their first and second derivatives : @xmath145 in this way @xmath146 approximates @xmath147 in a way that accounts for the statistical importance of the coordinate ; for instance the renormalized square frequency @xmath142 accounts for the average curvature of the original potential .",
    "it is obvious , since @xmath138 depends on @xmath142 and @xmath141 , that the last two equations are to be solved self - consistently ( sc ) , e.g. , by iteration : hence the designation scha .",
    "the parameters @xmath141 , and @xmath142 , as well as @xmath140 ( that follows from the first condition ) , depend on @xmath148 ; @xmath149 is usually dubbed ` renormalized ' frequency .",
    "the above framework also holds for quantum systems : one has just to identify @xmath150 with the quantum coordinate distribution for the harmonic potential  , which amounts to set @xmath151 . due to ground - state fluctuations , in the quantum case",
    "one does not recover the ha at zero temperature : the scha accounts for anharmonicity also in the ground state .",
    "it may happen that @xmath152 for some temperature @xmath153 : this signals the impossibility to fit @xmath130 with the trial potential and can be interpreted as the onset of an instability leading towards a different stable state . in the case of many degrees of freedom ,",
    "the vanishing of the spectrum gap often corresponds to a phase transition ; however , such an instability can also appear as a function of the hamiltonian s parameters , e.g. , a magnetic field , which case is commonly referred to as a ` quantum phase transition ' , even when its basic mechanism is essentially classical , as it happens , e.g. , for the ising chain in a transverse field  @xcite , for the kosterlitz - thouless transition in the 2d @xmath154 model  @xcite , and for 2d frustrated antiferromagnets  @xcite .",
    "the scha has had several successful applications in the study of quantum many - body systems , initially in lattice dynamics  @xcite ( often called ` sc phonon theory ' ) , but afterwards in optics , in magnetism ( ` sc spin - wave theory ' ) , and many other fields .",
    "a similar approach has also been exploited within feynman s path integral formalism , and has found an improved extension with plenty of applications in the study of quantum systems  @xcite .",
    "few - body nanostructures are somewhat more subtle than their extended translation - symmetric counterparts : the quantum scha is here derived in terms suitable for a simplified ( possibly numerical ) approach",

    "determine all the parameters .",
    "however , in order to find @xmath164 one has to perform the ( parameter - dependent ) canonical transformation that reduces @xmath158 to the standard normal form , as made in section  [ ss.diagonalh ] .",
    "this requires @xmath94 be symmetric  @xcite : fortunately , in the majority of systems one encounters in matter physics , interaction terms between momenta and coordinates do not appear and the matrix @xmath86 vanishes . a partial exception are",
    "spin hamiltonians in the bosonic representation , where such terms do appear , but the corresponding scha entails @xmath165 .",
    "an important tool when calculating the gaussian averages @xmath138 is the known technique of ` wick decoupling ' , that follows from a property of gaussian distributions : the gaussian average of a nonlinear @xmath166-degree monomial in the stochastic variables ( assumed with vanishing average ) can be obtained by separating it in all possible ways ( considering all variables as different ) as product of quadratic couples , replacing the couples with the corresponding average , and eventually summing up all the @xmath167 terms .",
    "for instance ( when @xmath168 ) one has @xmath169 and @xmath170 .",
    "of course odd - degree terms average to zero .",
    "the next sections show how the scha with weyl symbols applies to the study of two different kinds of transition in heisenberg afms , both with and without translation symmetry .",

    "the ground state for vanishing or sufficiently small field is close to the classical _ nel _ state , with neighboring spins antiparallel ( ap ) along the @xmath178-direction .",
