    "the effect of the heliospheric structure on gcrs propagation can be reproduced by a two dimensional ( radius and helio - colatitude ) stochastic model solving numerically the parkers s equation @xcite .",
    "if we do not take into account the effects of the earth magnetosphere @xcite modulated fluxes depends not only on the level of solar activity but also on particles charge sign and solar magnetic field polarity @xcite .",
    "the study of the modulation of @xmath0 ratios is particularly important , because it includes explicitly the combination of charge sign and polarity dependence .",
    "the local interstellar spectra ( lis ) used as input of the code , both for protons and antiprotons , are taken by the galprop model@xcite .",
    "the present code simulates the interactions of a gcr entering the heliosphere which extends up to a fixed distance of about 100 au from the sun .",
    "one of the main parameters of the model is the diffusion tensor .",
    "the parallel diffusion coefficient is : @xmath1=@xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the particle rigidity ( usually expressed in gv ) , @xmath4 is the diffusion parameter discussed in the next section and @xmath5 .",
    "the perpendicular diffusion coefficient has two components , radial @xmath6 , and polar @xmath7 .",
    "we used the relation : @xmath8 , where @xmath9 .",
    "we also considered @xmath10 in the equatorial region , while we enhanced its value in the polar regions of the heliosphere @xcite : @xmath11 .",
    "we used the tilt angle @xmath12 of the heliospheric current sheet ( hcs ) as a parameter for the level of the solar activity@xcite : the higher the value of @xmath12 the lower the expected gcr flux , for both solar field polarities .",
    "values of the tilt angle are computed using two different models : the usual model uses a line - of - sight boundary condition at the photosphere and includes a significant polar field correction ; an alternative model uses a radial boundary condition at the photosphere , and requires no polar field correction . as suggested by ferreira and potgieter@xcite , the classical model is used for periods of increasing solar activity ( for example 20072012 , ams-01 data , ams-02 data ) , while the new model fits better for periods of decreasing solar activity ( for example 20002007 , bess data ) .",
    "the three drift components do not depend on external parameters , except the solar polarity@xcite ( a@xmath130 for positive periods and a@xmath140 for negative periods@xcite ) .",
    "the general drift expression is locally unlimited for a quasi - isotropic distribution@xcite , therefore we limit all the drift components below @xmath15 , which is the spatially averaged maximum value .",
    "we selected gcr proton and antiproton data from 5 different experiments in order to compare and tune model results : ams-01@xcite , caprice@xcite , bess@xcite , heat and pamela @xcite .",
    "the first two experiments took data in a period of positive solar polarity , bess in both solar polarities , and the last two in a@xmath140 period .",
    "the corresponding periods of measurements are : june 1998 ( ams ) ; may 1998 ( caprice ) ; from july 1997 to december 2004 ( bess ) ; june 2000 ( heat ) ; and from 2007 to 2008 ( pamela ) . solar wind values for these periods",

    "when modulation is small@xcite - i.e. , @xmath36 - , they determined that @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the particle charge and @xmath39 is the so - called modulation strength ( or modulation parameter ) . assuming that @xmath40 ( the solar wind speed ) and @xmath4 are almost constant , @xmath39 - usually expressed in units of gv ( or mv ) - reduces to @xmath41 from which one gets @xmath42 i.e. , @xmath4 is linearly dependent on @xmath43 . in the ffm ,",
    "the diffusion coefficient @xmath44 is scalar quantity and , as a consequence , does not account for effects related to the charge sign of the transported particles .",
    "@xmath45 is independent of the species of gcr particles [ e.g. , see discussion at page 1014 of gleeson and axford ( 1968 ) or equation ( 1 ) of usoskin and collaborators ( 2005 ) ] .",
    "the values of the modulation strengths [ @xmath46 were monthly determined for the time period@xcite from 1951 up to 2004 using measurements of neutron monitors ( i.e. , located at @xmath47au ) ; while those for the solar wind speeds are available on the web@xcite .",
    "it has to be remarked that @xmath4 depends on the value of the solar wind termination located at a radial distance @xmath32 related , in turn , also to the solar wind speed [ e.g. , see chapter 7 of meyer - vernet(2007 ) and section 4.1.2.2 of leroy and rancoita ( 2009 ) ] .",
    "however , because the present simulation code assumes a fixed solar wind termination at 100au to calculate the modulated differential intensities at @xmath48 , one has to derive from the diffusion parameter @xmath4 that ( @xmath49 ) for an effective heliosphere with a radial extension of 100au ( see sect .

    "for each set , the data i ) could be fitted with a relationship - indicated in in fi .",
    "[ fig_sim1 ] - between @xmath17 and smoothed sunspot numbers ssn@xcite values and ii ) exhibited a gaussian distribution of difference of @xmath17 values from the corresponding fitted values .",
    "the rmss of the gaussian distributions were found to be @xmath51 for the phases rising with @xmath52 , declining with @xmath52 , rising with @xmath53 , declining with @xmath53 , respectively . in this way - i.e. , from the relationships found - , we can use the estimated ssn values to obtain the diffusion parameter @xmath17 at times beyond 2004 . in practice , this procedure allows one to extend the @xmath54 years period by exploiting the linear relationship between the fitted @xmath49 values and the ssn values ( one of the main parameters related to the solar activity ) .",
    "thus , we introduced in our code a gaussian random variation of @xmath17 with rmss corresponding to those found for each subset of data .",
    "results of the simulation with and without the gaussian variation are consistent inside the uncertainties of the code @xcite .",
    "our code simulates the interactions of a gcr entering the heliosphere from its outer limit , the helio - pause , located - as already mentioned - approximately at 100 au@xcite , and moving inwards to the earth located at 1 au .",
    "we evaluated the time @xmath55 needed to sw to expand from the outer corona up to the helio - pause . considering an average speed of 400 km",
    "/ s it takes nearly 14 months . while the time interval @xmath56 of the stochastic evolution of a quasi particle inside the heliosphere from 100 au down to 1 au is @xmath16 1 month at 200 mev and few days at 10 gev .",
    "this scenario , where @xmath57 and @xmath58 1 month , indicates that we can not use fixed parameters ( monthly averages ) to describe the conditions of heliosphere in the modulation process .",
    "in fact at 100 au , where particles are injected , the conditions of the solar activity are similar to the conditions present at the earth roughly 14 months before",
    ". therefore we consider @xmath56 negligible with respect to @xmath55 and divide the heliosphere in 14 regions , as a function of the radius .",
    "for each region we evaluated@xcite @xmath17 , @xmath12 and @xmath59 , in relation to the expansion velocity , in a dynamic way . in the future",
    "the time spent by a gcr particle inside the heliosphere , as a function of the stochastic path and of the particle energy , will be also taken into account .",
    "ratio as a function of the kinetic energy in gev at 1 au for ams-02 experiment ( january 2011).,width=336 ]      we performed the simulations using dynamic values of @xmath17 , @xmath12 and @xmath59 .",
    "results are shown in .",
    "simulated fluxes with dynamic values show a very good agreement with measured data , within the quoted error bars .",
    "this happens both in periods with a@xmath130 , in comparison with bess , and in periods with a@xmath140 , in comparison with pamela .",
    "this means that our dynamic description of the heliosphere improves the understanding of the complex processes occurring inside the solar cavity .",
    "the periodic behavior of the heliosphere allows us to predict , with a certain level of precision , the parameters needed for a simulation related to a time in the near future . in order to get these data we considered the prediction of ssn from ips ( ionospheric prediction service ) of the australian bureau of meteorology@xcite",
    "we concentrate our simulations on the ams-02 mission@xcite that will be installed on the iss in february 2011 , and , in particular , at a time approaching the solar maximum : january 2012 .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig_sim4 ] the predictions of gcr modulation for the antiproton / proton ratio .",
    "we built a 2d stochastic monte carlo code for particles propagation across the heliosphere .",
    "present model takes into account drift effects and shows quantitatively a good agreement with measured values , both for positive and negative periods and for different particles and charge sign .",
    "this is relevant because particles with opposite charge sign undergo a different solar modulation@xcite .",
    "we compared our simulations with antiproton / proton ratios measured by bess and pamela .",
    "we used _ dynamic _ parameters values ( @xmath17 , @xmath12 and @xmath59 ) for the related periods , in order to reproduce the propagation of incoming gcr through magnetic disturbances carried by the outgoing solar wind .",
    "the _ dynamic _ description of the heliosphere and the forward approach seem to reproduce better the real physical propagation of gcr in the solar cavity . in order to have a more sophysticated model we need to introduce a dependence on the particle time spent in the heliosphere and a larger statistics of measured data during negative solar field periods , as ams-02 will provide in the next years .",
    "recent measurements@xcite have pointed out the needs to reach a high level of accuracy in the modulation of the fluxes , in relation to the charge sign of the particles and the solar field polarity@xcite .",
