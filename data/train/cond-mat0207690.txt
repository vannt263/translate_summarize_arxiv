    "objects arising from flows , aggregation and so forth often have distinctive shapes .",
    "( think , for example , of snowflakes . ) upon theoretical study , ( the identification of all forces and processes at work , and the determination of all boundary conditions ) , the solution will be that of this particular shape . in other cases , however , the usual form is just one of many possible solutions that can be found .",
    "the question of what then distinguishes and determines only the usual , observed form is termed a problem of  pattern selection \" .",
    "clearly something has been left out of the theoretical treatment , which means that after a careful treatment , something apt to be subtle remains to be dealt with . ",
    "left out \" itself is subtle , since the theoretical considerations , and their solutions , entail approximations , and the  truth \" can have been left out by the approximations .",
    "we consider such a problem here .",
    "perhaps the earliest studied selection problem arose in the 1958 work of saffman- taylor ( s - t ) @xcite . here",
    "the question is the shape of a bubble penetrating into a body of viscous fluid .",
    "loosely , a soda - straw is filled with a thick fluid which is then forcibly blown out .",
    "how has the breath of air propagated down the straw , to drive out what amount of the fluid ? performed carefully , the straw of length @xmath6 is flattened down all along its length into a long rectangle of width @xmath7 and length @xmath6 , where @xmath8 is just about the circumference of the cylindrical straw , and a channel of thickness @xmath9 all that remains of the third dimension of the straw s volume .",
    "the material of the  straw \" is transparent glass for visualization .",
    "that is , there are two @xmath7 by @xmath6 plates of glass , one a gap @xmath10 above the other , and the long edges are sealed .",
    "view the @xmath7 by @xmath6 rectangles from above with the long length horizontal ( the @xmath11-axis ) and the width @xmath7 along the @xmath12-axis .",
    "a controlled source of high pressure air is now applied to the left end ( say , at @xmath11=0 ) , and the driven viscous fluid flows out the right end into atmosphere ( the efflux ) .",
    "the bubble of air advancing from the left into the viscous fluid , the immiscible high - pressure interface between the driving air and viscous fluid , hereafter referred to as @xmath13 , is the object of study .",
    "( see fig.1 , but imagine the viscous fluid to continue beyond @xmath14 . )",
    "= 8.5truecm    invariably , s - t observed the bubble to develop into a very long  finger \" , that is , a rounded nose furthest to the right with long horizontal sides parallel to the long sides of the channel trailing back towards the high pressure end .",
    "this finger is almost perfectly centered within the channel , that is , with center - line symmetry .",
    "moreover , s - t discovered that with higher and higher pressures , and hence increasingly faster bubbles , the width of the horizontal sides of the finger approached @xmath5 the width @xmath7 of the channel .",
    "this is the selected pattern for this problem .",
    "s - t then theoretically determined @xmath13 of finger shape , but of width @xmath15 with @xmath0 anywhere from 0 to 1 , rather than just @xmath5 .",
    "they had no argument as for why only the observed value should occur , and so exposed a problem of pattern selection .",
    "let us be more careful and say more about the experiment .",
    "there is no reason to use just air to drive the viscous fluid .",
    "indeed , any fluid immiscible with the fluid initially filling the channel may be employed to drive it .",
    "the problem is simplest if the driving fluid , like air , has a negligible viscosity , so that pressure is spatially uniform throughout it , and hence all along the interface @xmath13 .",
    "however , there is always some surface tension along @xmath13 , so that when @xmath13 is curved , _ just _ within the viscous fluid along @xmath13 , pressure is _ not _ uniform .",
    "it is straightforward to see ( say on dimensional grounds ) that this surface tension @xmath4 can modify the problem only in the combination @xmath16 with @xmath3 a velocity , say the velocity of the tip of the finger .",
    "it then follows that the selection of @xmath5 , occurring for high velocities , is selection in the limit @xmath17 .",
    "this then sets up the question of how this _ singular _ limit accounts for the observed selection .",
    "it is singular because , as determined in the 1958 paper , with @xmath18 , there is no selection at all .",
    "there is an extensive literature , culminating in the mid-1980s and employing  beyond all orders \" of perturbation methodology to verify this singular limit , and hence the critical role played by even the slightest of surface tensions acting along the boundary of the selected pattern.@xcite it is now",
    "the accepted wisdom that all these indeterminate selection problems achieve their theoretical resolution through additional  constituentive \" relationships ( such as @xmath4 for s - t ) imposed directly upon the shape to be so selected .",
    "let us again be more careful , and say more about the theory .",
    "the gap @xmath10 is viewed as so small , that with a usual limit of the viscous fluid equations , this  film \" of fluid can be treated purely within 2-d .",
    "this is a theoretically compelling circumstance , since the problem then rapidly is noticed to be fully amenable to complex , conformal mathematics .",
    "@xcite apart from some studies as to how finite values of @xmath10 can modify the 2-d solution , the entire literature on s - t flow is 2-d conformal .",
    "the theoretical and experimental literature nevertheless diverge in an obvious way . while discussing surface tension on the bubble interface , the experimental literature is relatively vague about how the viscous fluid emerges from the apparatus at low pressure .",
    "it is not that this is totally unimportant - care has to be paid to terminations , and the reliable reproducibility of fast long fingers emerges only after some adjustment of the efflux termination .",
    "perhaps it is largely undocumented in consequence of an implicit belief that far enough away from the observed interface , these details should significantly have decoupled .",
    "the theoretical literature has gone much further .",
    "literature considers only @xmath19 , namely , an infinitely long channel all filled with the viscous fluid .",
    "this is evidently a very different geometry from that of the experiments that determine selection .",
    "granted that subtleties can potentially lead to selection or its absence , one might wonder that this approximation to very large length has an impact upon selection .",
    "this question has never been asked in the literature .",
    "we do so here , and indeed discover that the limit @xmath20 is also singular .",
    "since conformal mathematics is so powerful , we consider a finite termination of geometrically simplest form .",
    "namely , we allow the channel containing the fluid to be arbitrarily long , while the viscous fluid , always within it , is of a fixed finite volume . abutting the fluid at its low pressure , right end , we again have air ; that is , a fluid with negligible viscosity , as is the high pressure driving fluid . hence , we now have two interfaces ; the high - pressure , experimentally observed one @xmath13 , and the low - pressure , efflux one at the right , which we now term @xmath14 .",
    "both interfaces are dynamically free surfaces , although they are evidently highly coupled , since between them resides the connected body of our incompressible viscous fluid .",
    "( see fig.1 )    in this finite configuration , the pressure drop across the viscous fluid becomes physically finite , whereas it is simply infinite in the usual treatment .",
    "there is also a net flux of fluid . in the infinite treatment",
    "it freely can be set at any value with impunity , and is conventionally set at the constant 1 . in our finite case ,",
    "the impedance of the flow , the ratio of net pressure drop by flux is again finite and large , as opposed to simply infinite in the usual treatment . more importantly",
    ", this impedance generally changes in time , since the closest distance between the two interfaces dynamically changes in time , and generally decreases as the interface @xmath13 grows more bent into a finger . in experiment ref.@xcite ,",
    "the time derivative of impedance is indeed significantly negative . although impedance variations are buried in an infinite value in the usual infinite treatment , it is troublesome that there is no trace of its derivative in that literature .",
    "the reason we have considered a finite body of fluid with definite pressures along its free boundaries is that there is a mathematical clue to anticipate an influence upon shape .",
    "the theoretical works on the infinite fluid all consider periodic boundary conditions for the cross - channel ( @xmath12 ) behavior .",
    "the channel has two long sides a distance @xmath7 apart , one edge at @xmath12=0 and another at @xmath12=@xmath7 .",
    "interface @xmath13 ( the only one for the infinite problem ) has viscous fluid everywhere to its right in the direction of increasing @xmath11 ( and hence decreasing pressure , @xmath21 , with @xmath22 as @xmath23 ) .",
    "the literature takes @xmath21 periodic in @xmath12 with period @xmath7 so the @xmath11-values of @xmath13 at @xmath12=0 and @xmath12=@xmath7 agree .",
    "the edges are impenetrable with no separation of fluid from them , so that the velocity of fluid along them is purely in the @xmath11-direction , and so , @xmath12=0 and @xmath12=@xmath7 are streamlines for the flow .",
    "periodicity of @xmath7 , in synchronizing the flow at both edges is clearly a higher symmetry than required .",
    "it is readily seen that this implies center - line symmetry , with @xmath3 also in the @xmath11-direction along @xmath12=@xmath24 .",
    "this , however , is just the symmetry of the observed finger , and so the symmetry in which to seek a theoretical result .",
    "this then is the choice of the literature .",
    "implicit in this choice of symmetry is , of course , the underlying fact that the flow is along the @xmath11-direction at each wall .",
    "this has a striking consequence not noticed in the previous literature .",
    "the conformal machinery utilizes an invertible analytic mapping @xmath25 from the fluid s spatial plane @xmath26 to a new plane @xmath27 with @xmath21 pressure , and @xmath28 the  stream function \" , where the curves of constant @xmath28 are always orthogonal to those of constant pressure .",
    "the thin limit of the viscous fluid equations is darcy s law : the velocity is the negative gradient of pressure .",
    "thus , fluid flows with a velocity at a point , at each moment of time , in the direction of a curve of constant @xmath28 through that point at that time .",
    "( these curves all evolve in time as then does @xmath29 . ) in particular , with velocity in the @xmath11-direction along the walls , this is to say real in the complex description , since darcy s law reads @xmath30 .",
    "this implies that at each instant of time the part of the strip between @xmath12=0 and @xmath12=@xmath7 all to the right of @xmath13 is mapped by @xmath29 into a strip between @xmath28=0 and @xmath28=@xmath7 all to the right of @xmath21=0 by the obvious choice of the origin of pressure ( only differences matter ) .",
    "but then , the real @xmath31-axis is mapped by @xmath29 to the real @xmath32-axis .",
    "this , in consequence of analytic continuation , implies that @xmath29 is schwarz reflection symmetric , @xmath33 .",
    "( this , together with an identical statement for the upper edge implies periodicity over @xmath8 , the true symmetry of the flow . increasing the symmetry to",
    "@xmath7 periodicity is equivalent to an extra reflection symmetry through @xmath12=@xmath24 . )",
    "the equation of motion for the interface @xmath13 is that it flow into itself under its velocity at each instant as determined by darcy s law .",
    "expressed in the @xmath32-plane , this becomes a relationship along @xmath13 ( which is just re@xmath32=0 ) of both the @xmath32 and time derivatives of @xmath34 and their complex conjugates . with @xmath35 reflection symmetric , these conjugates are then just the functions themselves evaluated at the conjugate of @xmath32 .",
    "but , along @xmath13 , the conjugate of @xmath32 is simply @xmath36 .",
    "thus , along @xmath13 the equation of motion is an analytic partial differential equation in @xmath32 and time .",
    "but then it analytically continues as that same equation as a field equation throughout fluid and its continuation .",
    "@xcite that is , there is a new symmetry of the equations of motion , _ parity _ in @xmath32 .",
    "the symmetry of @xmath37 is the periodicity of the literature .",
    "unnoticed in the literature , but implicitly present , is the symmetry of @xmath38 .",
    "that is , the equations of motion express a relationship between positive and negative values of @xmath21 .",
    "this is extraordinary , since it expresses some connection between the shape of @xmath13 , determined by singularities in @xmath35 at ( positive ) high pressures to behaviors of the fluid at ( negative ) low pressures , _",
    "i.e. _ to its efflux .",
    "this paper explores that connection , and discovers it be replete with consequences .",
    "in particular , for a propagating finger , @xmath0=@xmath5 is uniquely determined for the finite geometry with pressure fixed on each interface just within the viscous fluid , and so with zero surface tension on both @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "this immediately implies that the limit @xmath20 is singular , and s - t pattern selection is unambiguously resolved in finite geometry .",
    "the class of s - t solutions for arbitrary @xmath0 in the infinite problem is particularly simple .",
    "when we consider how they transport fluid particles arbitrarily far downstream , it is easily discovered that only the @xmath0=@xmath5 solution has cross - channel curves of particles all at a fixed value of pressure all flowing into other curves of fixed pressure at later times . with no surface tension",
    ", the fluid may be opened up to atmosphere along any such curve , which then is @xmath14 .",
    "the actual form of the @xmath0=@xmath5 solution came from mathematical simplicity in the infinite problem . in the finite version",
    "it is the _",
    "unique _ solution to the question of a translating finger .",
    "the other s - t solutions for @xmath39 far downstream ( far to the right ) correspond to solutions for the finite problem with @xmath13 still without surface tension , but with @xmath40 on @xmath14 , the curve that can then be opened to atmosphere .",
    "this confirms the significant connection between the shape of @xmath13 and some behavior ( smoothing ) of @xmath14 .",
    "moreover only @xmath39 is physically allowed , but requiring enormous values of @xmath4 to substantially decrease @xmath0 from @xmath5 . for viscosities and high velocities of the experimental literature , this amounts to no more than a several percent reduction in @xmath0 .",
    "reference @xcite found just such an order of magnitude reduction from @xmath5 , which there was interpreted as the absence of any genuine selection , and speculated that it might be in consequence of films of fluid left behind on the glass plates behind the advancing finger .",
    "moreover , it violates the singular limit theory of @xmath41 , which precisely determines just @xmath5 .",
    "finiteness can possibly solve this puzzle in the literature .",
    "next , with @xmath4=0 on @xmath13 for the infinite literature , all the s - t solutions are linearly unstable .",
    "the @xmath41 theory stabilizes its @xmath0=@xmath5 solution .",
    "the finite problem without surface tension , significantly , has its @xmath0=@xmath5 solution stable in a somewhat anomalous sense .",
    "when we consider fluctuations about a given solution , we presume that they can be imposed with an arbitrarily small expenditure of power . in the finite problem the same instabilities , that in the @xmath4=0 infinite geometry grew exponentially , require power exactly proportional to their size in order to be sustained .",
    "if there is no source to provide this power , then the solution is fully stable in finite geometry .",
    "this means that if the pump driving the flow is prevented , say by some feedback control , from engaging in rapid variations in the power requested from it , then the solution is stabilized .",
    "this is so different from the infinite geometry , that we again realize @xmath20 is singular .",
    "the @xmath20 limit of the @xmath41 theory has never been worked out , let alone questioned .",
    "it clearly should be .",
    "the idea that the treatment of an arbitrarily distant efflux can modify the shape of an object has never been experimentally checked .",
    "it is worth bearing in mind that aggregation arises in diffusive processes for which again there is an incompressible fluid with identical dynamics - namely the probability flux of random walkers .",
    "there is enough sufficiently delicate in the considerations to follow in this paper , that one can only go so far as to speculate that quite to the contrary of the accepted wisdom , patterns might more generally depend on details remote from the selected shape itself .",
    "this paper is laid out as follows :    in section 2 .",
    "we erect the conformal field equations suitable to two free interfaces , and notice that they are displacement invariant under a time @xmath42 , the integrated flux up to time @xmath43 . in order to determine exact solutions to perturb about",
    ", we ask the natural questions : are there purely translating solutions , and are there solutions which automatically satisfy the equations of _ both _ interfaces , simply in consequence of this translation invariance ?    in section 3 .",
    "we establish that the only such solutions turn out to be the 1/2 width saffman - taylor fingers , here not guessed at , but uniquely determined .",
    "we determine that saffman - taylor fingers of a narrower width correspond to gathering and smoothing the efflux in a precise way , and no matter how distant that efflux is from the driven interface .",
    "section 4 . develops the machinery to explicitly solve the finite problem in perturbation theory .",
    "a felicitous symmetry of the equations of both interfaces allows us to fully integrate both equations into a purely algebraic problem .",
    "although it is known that the infinite case is fully integrable , that is not known in the finite geometry we discuss .",
    "this symmetry allows one to speculate that this problem too is completely integrable .",
    "a result of this effort is that all unstable modes , and only these , determine ( unstably growing ) external impedances , and this one function , just of time , uniquely encodes the entire unstable spatial flow , thus allowing a pump driving the flow to  hear \" the precise shape of the interface simply by detecting the power requested from it , and so , rendering it capable of completely stabilizing the flow .",
    "no such thing is true in the infinite case , and so we realize that just how the flow is terminated matters , no matter how long the body of fluid .    in section 5 .",
    "we realize that while formal perturbative pole - dynamical solutions @xcite that apparently produce different width fingers exist , these solutions are _ purely _ formal , and ca nt correspond to any actual approximate solutions in the finite problem nearby to the 1/2 finger .",
    "this fully establishes isolated pattern selection .",
    "the discussion section 6 .",
    "more iconically presents what this paper has accomplished after the reader has been armed by the machinery presented .",
    "the paper ends in an appendix that establishes that the pure s - t 1/2 finger is unique , and so totally isolated within pole - dynamics for the finitely terminated problem .",
    "it has been relegated to an appendix in order not to interrupt the main line of exposition .",
    "this section contains some modest new results for pole - dynamics , and is a self - contained extension to paper @xcite . that paper can also assist the reader in gaining familiarity with the workings of our reflection symmetric field equations .",
    "indeed , some of the material of this section was reflected into that paper .    as a final point of information",
    ", in each numbered section , _ e.g. _ 2 . , equation numbers start again from 0 , and are referred to within just that same section without a section number prefix .",
    "references to equations in sections external to a given section are then prefixed by the number of the section they appear in .",

    "@xmath51 here is a function of time alone .",
    "consider the change in @xmath29 along an arbitrary curve @xmath52 @xmath53 since by eq.([2 ] ) @xmath54 , @xmath55 and so @xmath56 thus with @xmath51 the mean velocity of all fluid ( the conserved flux divided by cross - width @xmath57 ) , the original spatial channel is analytically mapped to an identical one in @xmath32 .",
    "( although flux is conserved throughout the incompressible fluid , for a finite system it will generally vary in time . )    assuming the fluid not to stagnate other than in front of added boundaries , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and so @xmath29 is invertible , _ conformally _ mapping one [ 0,@xmath57 ] strip onto another .",
    "we denote its inverse as @xmath35 : @xmath61    the virtue of @xmath35 is that all boundaries are known in @xmath32 : the problem we consider has impenetrable walls at @xmath62 ( along which @xmath3 is real ) and two free interfaces , one at @xmath63 , i.e. , @xmath64 and the other at @xmath65 , or at @xmath66 @xmath67 is the gauge pressure across the body of fluid , and @xmath68 ( the total impedance ) positive and generally time - dependent , because either or both of @xmath69 and @xmath70 are .",
    "( @xmath69 is time dependent if we experimentally modulate the driving pressure . )",
    "thus , in @xmath32 , the fluid is just a rectangle extending from @xmath64 up to a variable right hand edge .    to track a fluid particle through use of the one - parameter ( time ) family of maps , @xmath35 ,",

    "that is , if @xmath79 then @xmath80 for a fluid particle on the interface .",
    "that is , @xmath81 so that ( [ 8 ] ) is @xmath82 on each interface .",
    "the form of ( 10 ) recommends the following definition : @xmath83 immediately yielding @xmath84 on each interface @xmath85 .",

    "that is , @xmath105    this is significant in that purely translating solutions are allowed and a path is also opened for _ both _ @xmath35 and @xmath103 to obey @xmath104 in a way independent of the matching - up of inner details , merely reliant on translation invariance .",
    "pause to notice that reflection symmetry for @xmath35 has determined a new symmetry , parity , @xmath106 , for the equations of motion @xmath104 .",
    "this entails not only a cross - channel symmetry , but also a relation of @xmath21 to @xmath50 .",
    "but then , far upstream singularities which determine the shape of the driven interface become related to far downstream properties , which is to say how the flow is terminated .",
    "this observation is the foundation for the work that follows .    not only is @xmath35 reflection symmetric about the @xmath107-axis , but also about im@xmath108 since the upper horizontal wall there is also impenetrable .",
    "coupled with @xmath35 s reflection symmetry , this is simply the periodicity of @xmath35 : @xmath109    reflection symmetry itself means that both the channel and its @xmath32-image may be mentally reflected through the @xmath11 and @xmath107-axes respectively , so that , in light of the above , both views are periodic in @xmath110 $ ] , although only the upper half is physical .",
    "however , the experimental flow actually _ is _ very close to symmetric about its center line .",

    "left to themselves , these rapidly lead @xmath254 into a nonlinear regime about which we know little , but surmise tip - splitting . on the other hand ,",
    "as they proportionately modify flux , they are controllable .",
    "it is conceivable that a simulation of this flow constrained to prevent rapid flux variations might , near enough to @xmath254 , be stable .",
    "apart from these exponentially growing fluxes , there are no slow modes to modify @xmath463 to @xmath464 .",
    "that is , this flow protects the far downstream behavior of the 1/2 finger without surface tension on the efflux .",
    "the ability of @xmath254 to ward off nearby singularities lies in its ability to satisfy ( 4.[3.34 \" ] ) _ without _ any image singularities present , whereas all putative nearby perturbations with singularities must possess them , and are then inconsistent .",
    "clearly , with surface tension present , a method of images reminiscent of ( 4.[3.34 \" ] ) must exist , and so one can surmise that the appropriate s - t solution is again special . even though surface tension is a perturbation that spoils the critical symmetry of this paper ,",
    "there is now a reinforced reason to surmise that ( 3.[2.36 ] ) , @xmath465 at least for @xmath0 near 1/2 is correct , which i offer as a conjecture .",
    "we have followed a clue laid down by reflection symmetry that the analytically continued equations of motion are symmetric under parity , @xmath106 .",
    "this suggests that far upstream ( @xmath466 ) singularities , which determine the shape of the driven interface at re@xmath119 , are related to and co - determined with far downstream behavior , which is the nature of the efflux in a physical experiment . to see if any such thing holds , it was then mandatory to consider the flow of a finite body of fluid .",
    "the simplest feasible such problem , fully posed within the purview of the analytically continued conformal machinery , consists in replacing the riemann mapping of a disc to an annulus .",
    "the case of the simpler disc embraces all prior studies , and corresponds to fluid going off infinitely far to the right with a simple pole at @xmath467 . in the annular version ,",
    "the available channel is still infinite , but fluid terminates at a downstream interface , the behavior of which constitutes the efflux for this configuration .    requesting a purely translating driven interface receives a unique solution in the finite problem : there is sharp , precise selection for this question . examined in pole - dynamics , even including singularities to the right of the efflux interface , precisely and only this selected solution exists . examining a class of solutions that exist for the problem of the disc , but not here",
    "; namely the usual saffman - taylor solutions , we notice that selection is expressed on the efflux interface , even when asymptotically far downstream , with only the 1/2 solution maintaining it at a fixed pressure .",
    "solutions with @xmath468 also correspond to solutions to the finite problem , but with surface tension now smoothing the efflux interface ( although , of course , with zero surface tension still on the driven interface ) . the explicit relationship , @xmath1 provides the physical interpretation of all the s - t solutions .",
    "moreover , that the infinite fluid version of the disc allows all these possibilities with equanimity , determines that its pole at @xmath467 is truly within physical fluid , so that the problem of the disc is the theory of an unfinished , unterminated experiment , and is not the limit of a very long body of fluid .",
    "that is , the physical limit @xmath469 is singular .",
    "we end up showing that solutions to the finite problem near the selected one all preserve the efflux condition @xmath470 .",
    "although we have not worked out the theory for surface tension on the efflux , considering that the @xmath471 solutions do meet this condition , and that the condition is conserved under perturbations in the @xmath159 case , it is the most natural surmise that the width - efflux condition is generally correct , at least for @xmath0 not too much below 1/2 .",
    "most importantly , we reach the conclusion that while many consequences of the distant efflux are exponentially small , this is false for pattern selection .",
    "this is so different from the generally presumed behavior that for this reason alone , the annular configuration we discuss should be put to the experimental test .",
    "it is important in this regard to note ( private communications from several of the experimenters ) that this selection with beautifully formed fingers is not so easy to experimentally produce , generally requiring fiddling with the efflux to become reliably reproducible .",
    "for example , tabeling _",
    "et al_@xcite succeeded only after fitting an  impedance - matching \" plug to the efflux .",
    "it is regrettable that the experimenters havent carefully observed and calibrated such dependencies .",
    "this is not for any failure of the experimenters , but rather , illuminates an important aspect of the relationship between theory and experiment .",
    "namely , unless one has prior insights - basically theoretical knowledge - then one does nt quite know what is worthy to observe .",
    "necessarily , in order to better observe what one has chosen to , the experimenter exercises his art to control what obfuscates . but",
    "some of these thrown - out details might be at the actual heart of the system being observed .",
    "how is one to know in advance ? and",
    "certainly , until certified by experiment , there is no way to be sure that the theory considered is significantly related to the physical phenomenon .    having determined that at least for the elementary s - t solutions that only @xmath159 has any connection to a physically finite flow with efflux at atmospheric pressure and no surface tension on it , we go on to question if asking for pure translation in a finite problem is perhaps too brittle a request . in the flow of a finite piece of fluid",
    ", there is a finite , definite period of time over which the solution is that of a finger with a large body of fluid still downstream from it .",
    "the driven interface at velocity @xmath472 penetrates into the fluid whose terminating interface , virtually flat , moves with velocity 1 . for @xmath159 , by the time the fluid has translated its resting length @xmath14 under the mean velocity of its flux ( i.e. 1 ) , there remains but a thin layer of fluid still downstream from the driven interface , as the efflux interface begins to curve into a similar finger .",
    "calling this finite period of time when the pure finger is well - formed ( i.e. with long horizontal sides ) but still with a large body of fluid behind it the  finger regime \" ( as opposed to afterwards , the  breakthrough regime \" ) , we can ask if there are solutions that within measurable error appear as perfectly translating , but actually possess deviations exponentially small with @xmath14 , only becoming physically important in the breakthrough regime .",
    "should this be the case , then the strong selection is a misleading artifact of too mathematically posed a question .",
    "since there are no exact solutions we know of ( e.g. all versions of pole - dynamics ) save for the pure 1/2 s - t finger , we regrettably had no choice but to perform a perturbative analysis .",
    "as we erect this machinery , we are immediately led to notice that exceptionally useful new variables , basically @xmath297 , constructed from the old @xmath260 , are guaranteed of invertiblity , since the equation of motion for the driven interface is precisely the statement that the jacobian is the constant 2 .",
    "translating in @xmath32 an identical fact for the equation of motion for the efflux interface , we notice that given the first equation of motion , the second can be fully integrated into the relationship @xmath473 what is crucial here is that @xmath300 depends _ only _ upon the one new variable @xmath298 .",
    "this formula serves as the precise way in which the method of images is to provide a solution compatible with both interfaces .    in these new variables (",
    "more conveniently , their exponentials , @xmath474 ) perturbation theory is especially simple for just one interface . together with @xmath475 expressed perturbatively , we are able to fully integrate the perturbed p.d.e.s for both interfaces , and reduce the problem to a purely algebraic one .",
    "we explicitly did so here for the first two orders of perturbation , and to first order wrote down all possible solutions .",
    "the most striking such solutions are just the usual infinite fluid pole dynamical ones , but decorated with exponentially small image terms , vanishing with @xmath469 . since we already rigorously know that there are no such solutions , we wonder how they perturbatively appear so naturally and fluently . before discussing this conundrum , we notice something central to the heart of the finite problem .",
    "a finite body of viscous fluid has the natural constituentive relationship of impedance , the ratio of the net pressure across the fluid to the flux of its transport .",
    "although impedance is infinite in the usual infinite fluid problem , it is less clear that its time derivative should also exactly vanish , as it does in the theoretical literature , but ostensibly in disagreement with experiment .",
    "this is a signature that the infinite boundary geometry is unphysical , even construed as the limit @xmath469 .",
    "should a deformation of the fluid s flow produce a change in impedance , that is to say a change in the conserved flux through the entire fluid when pressure across it is maintained fixed , then such a deformation requests power from the pump that maintains this pressure difference .",
    "that is , such a deformation is _ driven _ by the pump , is controllable by the pump , and is certainly not spontaneously impressible .",
    "such a circumstance is hardly surprising since a deformation is not just on the driven interface , but throughout the incompressible fluid that must everywhere adjust to accommodate to a distortion of its boundary .",
    "this is very different in the infinite fluid geometry , where the promiscuous pole at infinity simply picks up whatever need be , since for the riemann disc , the disposition of the one interface uniquely determines everything .",
    "performing the perturbative analysis of the finite fluid , we are forced to immediately decide if the perturbation is to modify flux , and so be externally driven .",
    "should this not be allowed , we discover that the unperturbed finger has only purely stable modes , although not enough to allow for the arbitrary independent perturbations of both interfaces .",
    "the residual modes , all instabilities , are all driven by the external pump , and so , in no sense free fluctuations .",
    "these same modes , as @xmath469 , are precisely all the modes of the infinite fluid problem , although in that configuration they are all free .",
    "this now cements the observation that @xmath469 is singular , and the infinite fluid geometry a physically wrong limit .",
    "there is no reason to doubt that these exponentially growing modes are real - they are , however , controllable .",
    "indeed , a record of the flux through , or the power delivered by the pump over the course of time uniquely determines the disposition of this unstable flow throughout the entire body of fluid , and throughout this interval of time .    granting these modes and an experimental control that allows them to grow at most algebraically in time , we now ask about the slow modes produced by summing all these fast modes .",
    "we especially care about summing them into logarithms , which then modifies the linear change of impedance in time , which then modifies the efflux transport from @xmath476 to @xmath477 , hence modifies @xmath0 from 1/2 , and so , with no surface tension on the efflux produces a flow that violates @xmath1 . here , resorting to @xmath475 , we discover that these logarithmic modes are in fact purely formal , where with @xmath256 the strength of perturbation , they fail to be solutions for any finite value of @xmath256 , no matter how small , thus resolving the conundrum that they do nt exist in any correct non - perturbative analysis . with this",
    ", we establish that the solution of @xmath159 is definite and isolated in the neighborhood of the pure unperturbed finger , and that we had not posed too brittle a question in asking for exact translation .",
    "evidently , one would far prefer a purely non - perturbative treatment for a problem with a rather subtle resolution .",
    "nevertheless , this work serves as a tonic against the use of linear response methods in such delicate systems .",
    "the @xmath42-translation invariant solutions of ( 3.[2.50 ] ) , which we shall here refer to as @xmath478 with @xmath155 as in that equation , belong to a certain well - studied class of solutions ( class ( 27 ) of reference @xcite ) we used no properties of that class , but rather deduced ( 3.[2.50 ] ) from dynamical symmetry arguments .",
    "this class has a most important property : its members are exact solutions of @xmath116 .",
    "these particular dynamical solutions are the so - called `` pole dynamics '' .",
    "we shall , to render this paper more self - contained , re - derive these results here , as they are so trivial under reflection - symmetry , but then easily extend them to more complex variants .",
    "most importantly , we shall see that even within this significantly enlarged class of pole dynamics , the _ only _ solutions for both interfaces within the class are precisely the @xmath254 s of ( 3.[2.50 ] ) .",
    "that is , there exist no perturbations to @xmath254 whatsoever in this general class , which is to say that had the dynamics been exhausted by pole dynamics , then @xmath254 is rigidly isolated as _ the _ solution , and hence sharp pattern selection .",
    "we start with the delineation of pole dynamics ( class(27 ) ) : + @xmath479 where @xmath35 must satisfy @xmath116 and be reflection - symmetric ( @xmath480 real ; @xmath481 both present ) . paying attention to @xmath116 ,",

    "it is now natural to ask if there are other class ( 27 ) solutions for both interfaces , since then we could analytically solve the problem of such perturbations to @xmath254 .",
    "it is easy to see that there are none .",
    "first , substitute ( 2.[15 ] ) into @xmath517 to obtain @xmath518 with @xmath68 finite , taking the limit re @xmath519 , where class(27 ) is analytic , the left hand side vanishes , as it is the limit of simultaneous @xmath116 .",

    "thus , @xmath159 is selected .",
    "there is an important simple fact related to why @xmath521 .",
    "there is a unique conformal ( _ i.e. _ invertible ) map @xmath29 from the fluid at time @xmath42 to a rectangle with sides @xmath68 and @xmath112 .",

    "moreover , it enjoys an exact estimate : @xmath524 with @xmath272 the area of the fluid , the constant in time @xmath525 .",
    "unless @xmath526 , the inequality is strict .",
    "thus , with @xmath527 , we have @xmath528 that is , for other than the flat flow @xmath529 is stricly smaller than the resting length of the fluid . in particular , for a solution which was flat in the far past , @xmath521 , since it had the value @xmath170 in the far past , but certainly below it at finite times .    with @xmath35 of ( [ a.53 ] ) , @xmath103 of ( 2.[15 ] ) is g=(+_g)++_k ( 1-e^_k-_g- ) .",

    "it must be remembered that @xmath116 is nonlinear : the only @xmath35 s of class ( 27 ) is precisely of these @xmath478 s any linear combinations whatsoever .",
    "that is , there can be class ( 27 ) perturbations to @xmath254 , so that within this class , @xmath254 is perfectly stable of unique 1/2 width .",
