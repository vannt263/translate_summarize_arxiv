    "the young stars and clusters , as well as hii regions are known to be distributed along the spiral arms of grand design galaxies non - uniformly ; rather often they form groupings with sizes of about 0.3 - 0.7  kpc , rarely a little more .",
    "older objects ( such as cepheids , most of which are ten times older than o stars ) are usually also gathered in the same groups , called star complexes @xcite .",
    "these complexes are the greatest coherent groupings of stars and clusters , which are connected by unity of an origin from the same hi / h@xmath2 supercloud @xcite .    in irregular galaxies",
    ", there is a continuous sequence of star groupings with increasing age ( of the oldest stars ) and size , starting from clusters to associations to complexes @xcite ; in flocculent galaxies the largest complexes transform to short spiral segments @xcite . within the regular spiral arms of grand design galaxies , star complexes",
    "sometimes are located along an arm at rather regular distances .",
    "this is a quite rare phenomenon , which was found by @xcite in 22 galaxies .",
    "they noted the spacing of complexes ( which they called hii regions ) in studied galaxies to be within 14 kpc , and each string to consist , on average , of five hii regions .",
    "the gravitational or magneto - gravitational instability developing along the arm was suggested to explain this regularity @xcite .",
    "the list of @xcite is still the only published result of systematic searches for string of complexes in spiral arms .",
    "note that in 15 of their 22 galaxies the regular strings of complexes are seen in one arm only .",
    "we believe , to study properties of such galaxies is a most perpective way to understand the nature of regular chains formation .",

    "( [ equation : sfrs_arm_a ] ) and ( [ equation : sfrs_arm_b ] ) , we calculated deviations of actual positions of the local maxima of brightness along the spiral arm @xmath11 from the nearest ones with positions @xmath9 ( fig .  [ figure : nfig7 m ] ) .",
    "the figure shows a good spacing regularity of star formation regions in the greater part of arm  a. average deviation @xmath12 for sfrs located on longitudinal displacement @xmath11 from 4 to 16  kpc is @xmath13  pc ( fig .",

    "disposition of star formation regions here is more poorly described by eq .",

    "we will return to that issue in conclusion .",
    "anticorrelation between shock wave signatures and the presence of star complexes chains is suspected in spiral arms of a few galaxies .",
    "the most evident is the m  31 case , where the regular chain of complexes ( noted best in the _ galex _ images ) is seen along the nw arm , whereas the stellar age gradient across the arm ( well established with the cepheid periods ) and signatures of the shock wave are observed in another ( s4 , sw ) arm , which structure is well described by the classical density wave theory @xcite .",
    "the regular wave - like magnetic field is known just in the nw arm @xcite ; therefore the magneto - gravitational instability might lead to formation of star complexes chain along this arm segment .",
    "anticorrelation between the shock wave signature and regular spacing of complexes observed in m  31 may be explained with results of @xcite , who concluded that spiral shocks generate an irregular magnetic field .    amongst nearby galaxies , the most evident ( after m  31 ) case of the above - mentioned anticorrelation",
    "is ngc  628 ( m  74 ) galaxy .",
    "unfortunately , there are no appropriate magnetic field data for the studied part of ngc  628 . the only data concerning the magnetic field were obtained by @xcite who detected polarized emission at 18 and 22  cm wavelengths from the outer part of the galaxy ; their linear beam size was @xmath29  kpc .    nevertheless , we can estimate some properties of interstellar medium based on the dust distribution in ngc  628",
    ". the dust lane along the stellar arm ( but outside it ) can be a signature of the spiral shock wave . in the case of ngc  628 ,",
    "we observe the dust lane running in front of inner edge of arm  b. it is clearly seen in the @xmath30 images of the galaxy ( figs .",
    "[ figure : fig1 ] , [ figure : nfig5a ] ) , but farther from the center there is no dust lane running upstream of the stellar arm  a inner edge .    to study the disposition of the dust lanes along the spiral arms and variation of photometric parameters across the arms , we obtained photometric profiles across arms  a and b. here , in addition to the ultraviolet and optical images , we used @xmath31 m _ spitzer ( mips ) _ image of the galaxy , taken from the ned database @xcite , as a good tracer of dust location .",
    "nine positions for the cross - arm photometry were selected , six in arm  a , and three in arm  b ( fig .",
    "[ figure : nfig5a ] ) .",
    "two profiles were obtained for each position ; the first profile crosses the star formation region , and the second profile crosses the arm in the immediate vicinity of a sfr .",
    "the last set of profiles is marked as 19 ( fig .",
    "[ figure : nfig5a ] ) .",
    "the length of across - arm profiles is from 55 to 80  arcsec , the width is equal to 3  arcsec for every profile .",
    "the fluxes across the p.a . of profile were averaged .",
    "obtained profiles 1 ,  19 ,  9 of @xmath32 surface brightness and @xmath33 colour index , and profiles 19 of @xmath31 m flux are shown in fig .",
    "[ figure : nfig18 ] .",
    "the marks @xmath34  arcsec correspond to positions of the logarithmic spiral in fig .",
    "[ figure : nfig5a ] .",
    "photometric profiles in fig .",
    "[ figure : nfig18 ] clearly illustrate the hypothesis of @xcite . inside arm  b ,",
    "the strong dust lane is located in the profiles 7 ,  7 and 8 ,  8 at @xmath35  arcsec .",
    "ultraviolet surface brightness goes down there to @xmath36  magarcsec@xmath37 , colour index @xmath38 increases to @xmath39  mag , and @xmath31 m flux reaches a maximum ( fig .",
    "[ figure : nfig18 ] ) . smoothed dust lane is also observed in the profiles 9 ,  9 at @xmath40  arcsec .",
    "note that further along arm  b , in its distorted outer part , several large complexes are observed ( fig .",
    "[ figure : nfig5a ] ) .",
    "these complexes are brighter than the regions in the studied inner part of arm  b.    visually in optical images arm  a does not show obvious traces of dust lane , at least in its outer part ( fig .",
    "[ figure : fig1 ] ) .",
    "however , the increase of the colour index @xmath38 at @xmath41  arcsec in profile 1 , @xmath42  arcsec in profiles 2 , 5 and 6 , and @xmath43  arcsec in profile 4 is in accordance with the position of the dust lane inside the stellar arm  a. maxima of @xmath31 m flux in profiles 25 are also consistent with the middle of the stellar arm ( fig .",
    "[ figure : nfig18 ] ) .    as fig .",
    "[ figure : nfig18co ] demonstrates , the 2.6  mm ( co / h@xmath2 ) profiles across spiral arms repeat ultraviolet profiles with a few exceptions . in the beginning of the elmegreens chain of complexes ( profiles 2 ,  2 and 3 ,  3 ) , the maximum of the co flux shifts to the centre with respect to the @xmath44 maximum .",
    "[ figure : nfig18co ] shows that the co lane is rather located along the inner side of stellar arms ( see profiles 1 ,  1 , 4 ,  4 , 5 ,  5 , 7 ,  7 ) .",
    "the overall comparative morphology of spiral arms in ngc  628 is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ figure : efr001f ] for the different wave lengths .",
    "one may see that the co ( 2.6  mm , co / h@xmath2 ) lanes go along the inner sides of both stellar arms , but further on along arm  a , the dust lane goes inside this arm and about here the regular spacing of stellar complexes along arm  a appeared ( fig .  [ figure : efr001f ] ) .",
    "no such a regularity is seen in arm  b , and there is no regular spacing of star complexes as well .",
    "one might think the strong dust lane along the inner side of the stellar arm  b is seen in optics so evidently only due to its bright stellar background , but fig .",
    "[ figure : efr001f ] demonstrates it is not so  the co / h@xmath2 lane along the inner side of arm  b is seen very well , whereas it absents along the arm outer side . as concerns arm",
    "a , the age gradient ( shift between co and uv arms ) is observed to the same distance from the center , at which arm  b becoming quite irregular ( fig .",
    "[ figure : efr001f ] ) .",
    "comparison of @xmath45 , co , and @xmath46 m images in fig .",
    "[ figure : efr001f ] demonstrates , that further from the center in arm  a , the @xmath46 m and stellar arm central lines coincide .",
    "this is exactly the same situation as observed in the nw segment of m  31 spiral arm , where star complexes are seen inside the dust / gas lane .",
    "there was a suspicion that this m  31 situation might be due to the local plane corrugation which might present us the gas lane projected onto the stellar arm ( whereas the former might be in fact closer to the galaxy center in the m  31 plane ) .",
    "face - on orientation of the m  74 plane makes such an explanation untenable .",
    "our results confirms the drastic difference in the inner structures between the spiral arms of ngc  628 , one of which is long and hosts the regular chain of star complexes and another does not .",
    "@xcite in the first study of star complexes strings in the spiral arms found altogether 22 galaxies with such strings , and only in 7 of these the chains were noted along both arms ; the ngc  628 case seems to be typical .",
    "the reasons for such a difference are unknown yet .",
    "moreover , it is unclear until now why only some @xmath47 of galaxies ( all of the grand design type ) searched by these authors for complexes chains were found to host such chains .",
    "this statistics should be enlarged , but one might suggest already that indeed the magneto - gravitational instability  and not just the gravitational only  should be involved in string of complexes formation . magnetic field  and more so regular field along an arm  is surely more rare phenomenon as comparing with the universal law of gravitation .",
    "if so , occurrence of the regular chain in the minority of stringed arms only may imply we do not know yet some essential properties of intergalactic magnetic fields .",
    "the cause of drastic difference in inner structures of otherwise symmetric arms ( in well isolated galaxies ! ) seems to be amongst the greatest unsolved issues in understanding the spiral structures of galaxies .",
    "another our result ( which is to be confirmed still ) may imply existence of a certain minimal distance between young star groups , measured in projection onto the arm central line .",
    "many of these groups are too small to be called  a complex  , but most distances are either this minimal one ( about 400  pc , assuming the galaxy distance is 7.2 mpc  probably it is larger ) or twice and four times this minimal distance .",
    "this distance is seen well within arm  a between complexes a3 and a6 .",
    "we can not exclude the possibility that including of associations from arm  b , which distributed there rather chaotically  and not along the arm  may lead to erroneous ( too short ) estimate of this  fundamental  length .    however , the physical sense of these preferred distances becomes uncertain in the central region of the galaxy and this concerns both the arms . in this region",
    "distances between sfrs , projected onto the central lines of both arms can not be considered as the distance along the arm .",
    "this issue should be considered in more details .",
    "it is quite probable that this central region should be excluded from the consideration of the characteristic distances between sfrs .    at any rate",
    ", we see that both arms of m  74 galaxy are quite different ( though are symmetrical in relation to the galaxy center ) . the longer arm  a contains the chain of star complexes , whereas the shorter arm  b hosts the ( irregular ) chains of ( rather small ) hii regions as well as dust lanes , one quite strong along the inner side of the stellar arm and another lane , much lesser expressed along the outer side .",
    "implications of the later phenomena should be studied yet .",
    "the last unsolved issue we want to mention here is missing of a complex ( i.e. the double distance between adjacent complexes ) in a string , which was noted already in @xcite .",
    "they found that some of their  hii regions  have double mutual distance as comparing with the average expected between two ones along a given arm .",
    "similarly , later @xcite found that some distances between regularly spaced hi superclouds along the carina arm of the galaxy are twice larger than all others .",
    "these facts are hardly possible to explain in other way apart from the gravitational or , rather , magneto - gravitational instability , developing along the arm in the gas tube to form superclouds , the parent bodies for star complexes .",
    "unfortunately , the hst data are not available for the outer part of arm  a , where the regular chain of complexes is observed .",
