    "in 1982 , feynman proposed a novel computation model , named quantum computers which can efficiently solve some problems that are believed to be intractable on classical computers [ 1 ] .",
    "after that , many researchers devote themselves into the research about quantum computers .",
    "the latest research shows that quantum computers are 100 million times faster than classical computers [ 2 ] .",
    "the developing of quantum computer causes people s interest to study quantum image processing ( qip ) which refers to use quantum computers to process images .",
    "many researchers have proposed a number kinds of qip algorithms , such as geometric transformation [ 3 - 6 ] , color transformation [ 7 - 8 ] , image scrambling [ 9 - 11 ] , image segmentation [ 12 - 14 ] , feature extraction [ 15 ] , quantum image watermark [ 16 - 23 ] , quantum image encryption [ 24 - 27 ] , and quantum imaging [ 32 ] .",
    "their efficiency are theoretically higher than their corresponding classical schemes",
    ".    however , most of them do not consider the problem of measurement .",
    "1(a ) gives an example .",
    "no matter the image are the original one or the processed one , its representation method is similar : a superposition state is used to store the image and every pixel has the same probability to be measured . taking the processed image in fig .",
    "1(a ) as an example , its representation is @xmath4    @xmath5 is a superposition state .",
    "if we want to read the image out , it must be measured .",
    "however , once the state is measured , it will collapse to the non - superposition state that has been measured .",
    "that is to say , once a pixel is measured , other pixels will disappear .",
    "like the image @xmath5 , it has 4 pixels and the probabilities of a pixel being measured are all @xmath6 .",
    "if the pixel being measured is @xmath7 , @xmath5 collapses to @xmath7 and the other 3 pixels disappear . how to measure the other pixels ?",
    "the only method is performing the quantum image processing again .",
    "most fortunately , if a different pixel is measured each time , by repeating the whole process 4 times , the 4 pixels values are regained . however ,",
    "if we are not so fortunate , it can not say the exact number of repetitions , maybe 10 times , maybe 100 times , and maybe never get all the 4 values .    hence , in order to read out the result , users must execute the quantum algorithm many times . therefore , whether or not the algorithms are really efficient needs to be reconsidered . in ref .",
    "[ 38 - 39 ] , mario mastriani holds a similar view .    in this paper",
    ", we try to solve the problem of measurement and give a quantum image matching algorithm ( see fig .",
    "this scheme modifies the probability of pixels to make the target pixel to be measured with higher probability and the whole scheme is executed only once .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "2 gives related works about quantum image matching .",
    "3 introduces what image matching is .",
    "our scheme is discussed in sect .",
    "4 including the basic ideas , the scheme steps , and the theoretical analysis . sect .",
    "5 analysis the network complexity .",
    "6 gives the conclusion .",
    "there have been several references that discuss the quantum image matching .",
    "yang and _ etc _ give a quantum gray - scale image matching scheme in ref .",
    "[ 34 ] , in which the quantum template image is directly mapped with quantum reference image , i.e. , the quantum register representing each corresponding pixel of the quantum template image is subtracted from that of the quantum reference image by running a quantum subtracter . according to the quantum measurement results , the difference is saved and sum all the differences . then compare the sum with a tolerance value . if the sum is smaller than the tolerance value , then quantum image matching succeeds .",
    "however , we think that it has 3 shortcomings : ( 1 ) although the title is `` quantum image matching '' , in fact , the paper computes the similarity between two quantum images instead of giving a quantum image matching scheme .",
    "( 2 ) what the quantum part of the scheme does only is subtraction , which can be done more efficiently in classical computers .",
    "( 3 ) it needs to regain all the pixels in the different image , i.e. , it needs to be processed and measured many times .",
    "a chaotic quantum - behaved particle swarm optimization based on lateral inhibition ( li - cqpso ) is proposed in ref . [ 35 ] , which is used to solve complicated image matching problems . in this work",
    ", the proposed li - cqpso combines the techniques of chaos theory , quantum and lateral inhibition .",
    "chaos can guarantee the pso escaping from local best , quantum can make the traditional pso with better searching performance as well as having fewer parameters to control , and lateral inhibition is applied to extract the edge of the images by sharpening the spatial profile of excitation in response to a localized stimulus . however , it is a classical algorithm and all steps are done in classical computers .",
    "quantum - behaved particle swarm optimization ( qpso ) is only motivated by concepts from quantum mechanics , but is not a quantum algorithm .",
    "[ 36 ] proposes to combine the shape context ( sc ) descriptor with quantum genetic algorithms ( qga ) to define a new shape matching and retrieval method .",
    "the sc matching method is based on finding the best correspondence between two point sets .",
    "however , it is suitable for shape matching instead of natural images matching .    the algorithm proposed in ref . [ 37 ] is similar to our work : change the probability of the target pixel . however , as the authors say in this paper , it is not a complete solution because that although the probability of the target pixel is larger than the probability of other pixels , it is still relatively small .    unlike the above works",
    ", we will give a quantum image matching solution which does not compute similarity , is not a classical algorithm based on quantum concepts , and is not for shape matching .",
    "image matching is the process of searching for a small image in a big image .",
    "it is widely used in computer vision , military automatic target recognition , face detection , manufacturing quality control , visual positioning and tracking , and so on .",
    "2 gives an example .",
    "the simplest image matching method is the exhaustive search .",
    "assume that the size of the big image is @xmath8 and the size of the small image is @xmath9 , where @xmath10 .",
    "for each @xmath9 image block in the big image , the method compares all the pixels in the block with the corresponding ones in the small image .",
    "if the block is the same as the small image , the method will finish its work and output the block s location .",
    "hence , the complexity of the exhaustive search is @xmath1 .",
    "it is exponential and too high to bear in most application cases .",
    "therefore , researchers give other schemes to reduce the complexity .",
    "most of them take advantage of the features of images :    1 .   feature - based scheme compares the image features instead of the whole image pixels to match two images [ 28 ] .",
    "color , edge , feature points and so on can all be used as features .",
    "3 gives two examples .",
    "in general , no matter what kind of features , their data volume is obviously smaller than the original image ( the pixels ) , which helps to reduce the complexity .",
    "frequency - domain schemes find the transformation parameters for matching [ 29 ] .",
    "the commonly used transformations include the discrete cosine transform , the discrete fourier transform , the discrete wavelet transform and so on .",
    "this method can not only reduce the complexity by cutting down the data volume to be compared , but also tolerate a certain degree of deformation caused by illumination , angle , distance and _ etc _ ( see fig .",
    "interactive schemes provide tools to match the images manually which reduce user bias by performing certain key operations automatically while still relying on the user to guide the matching [ 29 ] .",
    "although these improved schemes enhance the performance of image matching , it is still a difficult problem in image processing because the efficiency is unsatisfactory yet .    in this paper , by taking advantage of the high computing ability of quantum computers , we give a quantum image matching algorithm to reduce the complexity .",
    "we use the generalized quantum image representation ( gqir ) method [ 6 ] to store quantum images in this paper .",
    "gqir is developed from the novel enhanced quantum representation ( neqr ) [ 7 ] with the difference that gqir can represent arbitrary @xmath11 images instead of only @xmath8 images .",
    "if a quantum image is with size @xmath8 , its gqir representation and neqr representation are the same .",
    "readers please refer ref . [",
    "6 ] about gqir s preparation and analysis . for the sake of simplicity , in this paper",
    ", we only describe gqir briefly .",
    "an images can be seen as a function : @xmath12 .",
    "hence , a gqir image is represented as an entangled state @xmath13 assume that the size of an image is @xmath8 and @xmath14 . due to the equal role of every pixels in an image ,",
    "their probability are equivalent .",
    "hence , @xmath15    in image matching , the inputs are two images : the big image @xmath16 with size @xmath8 and the small image @xmath17 with size @xmath9 , where @xmath10 .",
    "the matching algorithm s output is the location @xmath18 of the upper left pixel of @xmath17 in @xmath16 .",
    "5 gives a sketch map .     in the shaded area in @xmath16",
    ", it will output the upper left location @xmath18.,height=188 ]    in order to get @xmath18 in measurement , the basic idea of our solution is to increase the probability of @xmath18 and reduce the probability of other pixels . as early as 1996 , grover had provided the idea [ 31 ] . in this paper , we use it into quantum image matching .      according to the previous presentation , the two input images @xmath16 and @xmath17 are @xmath19 @xmath20 additionally , two auxiliary qubit @xmath21 and @xmath22 are needed .",
