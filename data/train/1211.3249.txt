    "in ref .   we assessed the sensitivity of void shapes to the nature of dark energy that was pointed out in recent studies @xcite .",
    "we investigated whether or not void shapes are useable as an observational probe in galaxy redshift surveys .",
    "we focused on the evolution of the mean void ellipticity and its underlying physical cause .",
    "to this end , we analysed the morphological properties of voids in five sets of cosmological n - body simulations@xcite , each with a different nature of dark energy , as expressed by the equation of state parameter @xmath0 , that relates the pressure of the dark energy cosmic fluid to its density through @xmath1 ( figure [ fig12].a ) .",
    "comparing voids in the dark matter distribution to those in the halo population , we addressed the question of whether galaxy redshift surveys yield sufficiently accurate void morphologies .    at first , voids are identified using the parameter free watershed void finder ( wvf)@xcite , applied on a density field obtained by means of a delaunay tesselation field estimator ( dtfe)@xcite . secondly , we tried using a different void finder , based on the monge - ampre - kantorovitch ( mak ) reconstruction of ref .  .",
    "this method yields a different type of void that may be sensitive to the underlying cosmology in a different way than the wvf / dtfe method .",
    "the effect of redshift distortions was investigated as well .",
    "the distorting effect of these on the shape measurements are included in the figures as error - bars .",
    "we confirmed the statistically significant sensitivity of voids in the dark matter distribution ( figure [ fig12].b ) .",
    "we further found that using the combination of wvf with dtfe in the halo and/or galaxy distribution it is practically unfeasible to distinguish at a statistically significant level between the various cosmologies due to the sparsity and spatial bias of the sample .",
    "however , using the mak void finder , the ( mock ) galaxy distribution yields excellent results ; the effects of different dark energy models are clearly discernible in the evolution of the mean ellipticity ( figure [ fig34].b ) .",
    "this is a promising result in the light of upcoming galaxy redshift surveys , on which this method may be applied ."
