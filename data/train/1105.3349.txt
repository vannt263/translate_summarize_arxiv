    "at very low temperatures , essentially at @xmath3 , the electrons in a 2d uniform electron fluid ( uef ) occupy momentum states up to the fermi energy @xmath4 . if the electrons were non - interacting they have only kinetic energy , the potential energy being a constant .",
    "the energy bands of the electrons are of the form @xmath5 , where the mass @xmath6 of the non - interacting electrons is unity , even in semi - conductor nanostructures or metals where the material parameters can be subsumed by a suitable re - definition of the effective atomic units  @xcite .",
    "such 2d electron layers have been experimentally realized in semiconductor interfaces , enabling the experimental probing of such systems which are of great fundamental and technical importance .    if the the number of electrons in a unit area ( measured in atomic units ) is @xmath7 , the radius of the disk in real space per electron , _",
    "viz_. @xmath1 , is @xmath8 .",
    "the ratio of the coulomb interaction to the kinetic energy is a measure of the ` strength ' of the interactions in the system . in the limit @xmath9",
    "it is found to be equal to @xmath1 .",
    "thus @xmath1 plays the role of the expansion parameter or coupling constant in the perturbation theories of the electron fluid .",
    "perturbation theories work reliably when the coupling @xmath1 is less than unity .",
    "the range of validity can sometimes be increased by the use of a ` screened interactions ' , at least for some properties .",
    "one of the tenets of fermi liquid theory , originally developed to treat the behaviour of electrons in metals ( where usually @xmath10 ) , is that the low - energy excitations in these interacting systems , known as quasiparticles , are very similar to non - interacting electrons .",
    "however , the mass @xmath6 is replaced by an effective mass @xmath0 which allows for the modification of the energy bands due to many - body interactions . other parameters which describe the electrons , e.g. , the land @xmath11 factor ,",
    "are also modified and these are the ` fermi - liquid parameters ' of landau theory . unfortunately , standard many - body theory which uses perturbation methods can not make a reliable evaluation of @xmath0 for systems where @xmath1 is greater than unity .",
    "physically motivated approximations are needed to truncated the perturbation chain , and these invariably result in the failure to satisfy the sum rules , self - consistency conditions etc . if the results were insensitive to the various possible choices for screening , vertex corrections , selection of graphs , etc .",
    ", then this would not matter .",
    "unfortunately , the evaluation of @xmath0 , usually carried out from a physically motivated approximation to the self energy , turns out to be very sensitive to the model used . thus .",
    "for example , perturbation theories may predict the @xmath0 of electrons at @xmath1=5 to be a fraction of the bare mass , or several times the bare mass , depending on the model used .",
    "these methods even fail to predict positive - definite pair - distribution functions ( pdfs ) , i.e. , @xmath12 for useful values of @xmath1 .    however , significantly more reliable results are available from quantum monte carlo simulations ( qmc ) , especially for pdfs and correlation energies .",
    "unfortunately , the @xmath0 evaluations involve the probing of excited states , and only a few qmc calculations are available for the effective mass of the 2d uef . experimentally too",
    ", the measurements have been very challenging .",
    "nevertheless , currently available results , both experimental and simulational , show that the @xmath0 of the 2d - paramagnetic electron liquid is enhanced above unity as @xmath1 increases , while the @xmath0 of the fully spin - polarized system remains below unity even as @xmath1 is increased .",
    "an alternative approach to the study of the effective mass is to look at quasiparticle excitations in a fluid at a temperature @xmath13 close to @xmath3 .",
    "the thermal excitations occur in a strip of energy of width @xmath13 near @xmath4 .",
    "th excitations in the system are associated with an increase in the helmholtz free energy @xmath14 ( non - interacting case ) , or @xmath15 ( interacting case ) , of the system . the quasiparticle mass enters directly into the specific heat of the system . hence the ratio of the specific heats of the interacting system and the non - interacting system provides a direct and unambiguous measure of the effective mass @xmath0 of the excitations . under certain conditions ,",
    "these can be identified with the landau quasiparticles of the fermi liquid in the limit @xmath9 as discussed by luttinger and others @xcite .",
    "thus a calculation of the interacting free energy @xmath15 as a function of @xmath1 at finite-@xmath13 would provide an estimate of the effective mass @xmath0 , if the finite-@xmath13 free - energy of the system could be calculated .",
    "the calculation of the finite-@xmath13 interacting free energy or the self - energy at the hartree - fock ( hf ) level is well controlled . however , the self - energy is divergent at the fermi energy and it is not possible to define an effective mass . on the other hand , the logarithmic divergencies in the hf - free energy can be separated out and we are able to present a thermal effective mass at the hf level , viz . , @xmath16 , arising entirely from exchange processes . here",
    "we present previously unpublished results for the coefficients of the @xmath17 term of the polarized system .",
    "the hf @xmath16 decreases with @xmath1 and this approximation breaks down for @xmath18 when @xmath19 becomes negative .",
    "thus the inclusion of correlation corrections is imperative to obtain a physically meaningful result .",
    "instead of using diagrammatic methods , in our previous work we used a calculation of @xmath2 at finite-@xmath13 _ via _ a coupling - constant integration of the pdfs of the interacting system .",
    "the finite-@xmath13 @xmath12 needed for the calculations were obtained using the classical - map hyper - netted - chain ( chnc ) method where the 2d electron system at the temperature @xmath3 is replaced by a classical coulomb fluid at the temperature @xmath20 .",
    "given that the interacting chemical potential @xmath21 becomes negative beyond @xmath22 , ( e.g. , at @xmath23 , @xmath24 ) , the distribution functions even at @xmath13 just slightly above @xmath3 are classical boltzmann distributions with little or no occupation at @xmath25 .",
    "hence the study of a classical model which correctly incorporates quantum features via effective potentials is a very reasonable proposition . however , although the chnc can be unambiguously implemented at @xmath3 and at sufficiently elevated temperatures , we are beset with a number of difficulties in dealing with the ` warm - dense ' region close to @xmath3 .",
    "the two main difficulties are ( a ) the elimination of logarithmic - divergent terms which need to exactly cancel with the exchange and correlation contributions , ( b ) the finite-@xmath13 modeling of the bridge function of the classical - fluid which controls the cluster diagrams beyond the hyper - netted - chain sum of diagrams . in this study",
    "we present an alternative approach which partially circumvents these difficulties , and provides a more transparent analysis , leading to a new formulation of the effective mass calculation .",
    "the @xmath26 , i.e. , pdfs of the 2d - electron system ( at @xmath3 ) have been accurately parametrized by giri - giorgi et al . , @xcite and may be considered known .",
    "the @xmath2 at @xmath3 can be written as a coupling - constant integration over @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the coupling constant .",
    "further more , we consider -@xmath29 as the potential of mean force , viz .",
    ", @xmath30 of the equivalent classical interacting coulomb fluid",
    ". then we determine the finite-@xmath13 form of @xmath30 to second order in the temperature and use this to directly evaluate the second - order temperature correction to the exchange - correlation free energy . in the following",
    "we show that the method leads to a transparent , if approximate , calculation of the effective mass @xmath0 at arbitrary polarizations , and in good agreement with the available results in the field .",
    "the thermal effective mass @xmath0 can be expressed as a ratio of the heat capacities of the interacting and non - interacting systems as : @xmath31 } { \\left[\\partial^2 f_0(t)/\\partial t^2\\right]}\\ ] ] here @xmath32 is the specific heat at constant volume .",
    "the interacting free energy @xmath15 is the sum @xmath33 , where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the exchange and correlation contributions , with @xmath36 .",
    "hence the problem of determining @xmath0 reduces to a calculation of exchange - correlation effects at finite temperatures , near @xmath3 .",
    "however , such calculations are in many ways even more demanding than those at zero temperature , as perturbation methods have to now deal with a whole host of new diagrams , their singularities and cancellations .",
    "these difficulties were first addressed in the papers by luttinger , ward , and kohn @xcite .",
    "similarly , qmc methods are also equally difficult , especially for @xmath13 very close to zero .",
    "the hartree - fock self - energy becomes logarithmically divergent near @xmath25 and it is not possible to define an @xmath0 via the self - energy at @xmath3 . in the following",
    "we first examine the exchange - only , i.e. , hartree - fock , approximation to @xmath15 at finite temperature , and calculate a",
    "_ regularized _ effective mass @xmath37 for paramagnetic and ferromagnetic 2d electrons , i.e. , for spin polarizations @xmath38 and 1 .",
    "it is found that @xmath19 , containing the corrections from @xmath34 , is a decreasing linear function of @xmath1 for both polarizations .",
    "the non - interacting free energy @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the entropy , can be evaluated and expressed in terms of the dilogarithm function .",
    "writing @xmath41 , where @xmath21 is the chemical potential , @xmath14 and @xmath42 for the 2d system are given as follows , per unit atomic volume , and in hartree atomic units : @xmath43\\\\ % see code fzero.f",

    "thus @xmath48 .",

    "the first - order ( i.e. , unscreened ) exchange free energy @xmath34 consists of @xmath50 , where @xmath51 runs over the two spin species . at @xmath3",
    "these reduce to the exchange energies : @xmath52 here @xmath53 , and @xmath54 . then the exchange energy per particle at @xmath3 ,",

    "@xmath65 which are @xmath66",

    "[ exf ] requires the removal of the square - root singularity by adding and subtracting , e.g. , @xmath72 for the case where @xmath73 is negative , and @xmath74 , and so on .",

    "these depend on the spin polarization @xmath93 .",
    "the results for the fully polarised case do not seem to be previously available in the literature .",
    "we have obtained the following expansion : @xmath94      the hartree - fock electron fluid is a theoretical construct which does not exist in nature .",
    "however , it is a very useful conceptual model .",
    "the difficulties in this conceptual model are due to the singular behaviour of the single - particle energy , self - energy etc .",

    "<S> the effective mass is calculated from the coefficient of the quadratic temperature dependence of exchange - correlation free energy @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> this is calculated in a physically transparent manner using a new formula for the effective mass . </S>",
    "<S> this uses the @xmath3 pair - distribution functions of gori - giorgi et al . , and the temperature derivative of a quantum analogue of the potential of mean - force well known in the statistical mechanics of classical fluids . </S>",
    "<S> the results are compared with recent quantum monte - carlo simulations at @xmath3 , as well as with other available experimental and theoretical data for the effective mass . </S>"
