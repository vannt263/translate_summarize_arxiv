    "existing theories can be grouped into episodic phenomena , which provide stochastic clearing of icm , and continuous phenomena .",

    "this is not always met in plasma conditions , with particles of a few @xmath25 being scattered to lower and higher energies ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the mean - free path in a plasma is very short , due to the long - range electromagnetic interactions that can happen between ions and electrons . for the icm densities here , it can typically be measured in au or ( at most ) fractions of a parsec : several orders of magnitude smaller than the @xmath26-folding length at the tidal radius .",
    "were a globular cluster isolated , jeans escape would not be possible until many hundreds or thousands of parsecs from its core .",
    "we would naively expect tidal escape to dominate , however we will show that both can be important .",
    "the physics of tidal escape are complex , and an accurate solution requires a full hydrodynamic model , in which the thermally expanding system is augmented by the kinematic and radiative acceleration of icm by sources within the cluster and by processes around the @xmath27 and @xmath28 points .",
    "however , we can simplify the solution by analogy to stellar roche lobe overflow ( rlof ) of an eccentric binary , since the physics of rlof is well studied ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the primary difference in our case is that the thermal timescale is much shorter than the dynamical timescale , the converse of the stellar case .",
    "due to the large mass differential and large separation between the cluster and galaxy , the roche lobe for a globular cluster can be considered to be almost perfectly spherical , corresponding to the tidal radius .",
    "meanwhile , the roche lobe for the galaxy is an almost - perfect plane which touches the cluster at its tidal radius .",

    "the jeans - escape criterion can then be satisfied .",
    "material can then either leave the cluster via jeans escape , or via flow through the @xmath27 and @xmath28 points . in either case , the escape is driven by thermal expansion of the icm , and the response of the density structure to the escaping gas should then occur on the dynamic timescale of the cluster .",
    "we can therefore expect that _ the total icm mass found within a cluster will be approximately equal to the mass lost by its stars over the dynamical timescale_. we examine whether this holds for 47 tuc in section [ finaldensitysect ] .",
    "if it can be shown that the combination of jeans- and tidal - escape rates from the cluster are similar to the mass - injection rate by stars , we can consider the modelled ionizing sources ( post - agb stars and white dwarfs ) as capable of clearing mass from globular clusters through simple thermal expansion of the icm .    in this work ,",

    "this may indicate that the x - ray emission is likely to peak around 50  ( certainly no sources have been found that should have important contributions longward in these wavelengths ) , however the intra - cluster and galactic hydrogen can be expected to become opaque at around these wavelengths .",
    "the _ chandra _ data show that x - ray emission from the cluster is dominated by mass transfer systems : quiescient low - mass x - ray binaries ( qlmxbs ; typically main - sequence + neutron stars ) and cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) , plus a less - significant contribution from x - ray - active binary stars .",

    "the blackbody could be emitted either from the surface of the compact object , the inner edge of the accretion disc , or an accretion disc hot spot , and therefore may include contributions from plasmas of a variety of different temperatures .",
    "typically , the spectrum steepens considerably above @xmath215 kev ( @xmath21 ) , such that negligible emission occurs at higher energies .",
    "this is fortunate , as a gap in spectral coverage exists from 6 kev to 200 mev , directly between the tail of the x - ray emission and the peak of the pulsar @xmath58-ray emission , which we presume is largely devoid of flux .    in terms of photon counting",

    "we can therefore express the x - ray flux as a blackbody , of which a certain fraction of photons ( @xmath21580 per cent ) will be upscattered and experience the lower ( 0.45 @xmath75 g@xmath6 ) mass absorption co - efficient .",

    "the cloudy code allows one to model the photo - ionization of icm for a given density distribution , under certain assumptions .",
    "the most significant of these assumptions is that the environment is static : i.e. , that there is no outflow , and that material is ionized _ in situ_. cloudy also does not fully model kinetic energy input into the gas , hence we assume that particle winds ( e.g.  from main - sequence stars , less - evolved red giants , horizontal branch stars and pulsars ) do not heat the icm . since the effect of both of these limitations is to reduce the energy available and its transport to large radii , they provide a conservative case where all the available energy for ejection is derived from radiation from the white dwarfs .    one outstanding issue is the treatment of cooling by expansion and gravity , which is not accounted for in cloudy",
    ". gravitational cooling may arise as particles flow outward from the cluster , while expansion cooling occurs when material expands as it flows to larger radii where densities are lower .",

    "the closeness of the efficiency to unity is sufficient to state that , without any additional kinematic or heating mechanisms , heating of icm by white dwarfs is sufficient to cause catastrophic ejection of icm from the cluster in our model .",
    "our model therefore provides both a mechanism for clearing globular clusters of icm , and an estimate of the icm mass in 47 tuc ( section [ finaldensitysect ] ) which matches that inferred from observations .      in this section ,",
    "we have presented a scenario whereby the icm is heated by white dwarfs to a sufficient extent that the icm cloud can expand across the tidal radius , after which material is lost by a combination of jeans escape and tidal escape , where the former dominates .",
    "we caution that we do not provide a full hydrodynamic model of the cluster .",
    "several factors which may be physically important in governing the cluster s icm are not included in our simple model and its assumptions .",
    "we detail those we consider most important here .    _ hydrostatic equilibrium and no gravitational or expansion cooling : _ our cloudy model assumes hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "the temperature , density and ionization profiles are therefore calculated under the assumption that the icm is ionized in situ .",
    "the recombination timescale is @xmath0myr in the inner regions of the cluster and increases as density drops .",
    "gravity is only included in our model as a pressure - balancing term and cooling by expansion of gas is not acounted for .",
    "outflowing material will expand as it moves outwards and lose energy as it overcomes the gravitational potential and expands . while we consider this not to be important ( section [ initialdensitysect ] )",
    ", it is unmodelled .",
    "conversely , acoustic transport of energy outwards may also occur , causing heating of material further out , but this should serve to increase the cluster s mass - loss rate .    _",
    "time - varying tidal radius : _ we have assumed that the icm mass can be calculated from the dynamical timescale of the tidal radius , which is likely to be @xmath010@xmath8 myr for a typical globular cluster . near the galactic plane , the tidal radius of a cluster can change appreciably on these timescales , though this is unlikely to affect the particular case of 47 tuc .",
    "_ a point ionization source : _ we model our input ionization as a single , point source lying in the cluster centre . in reality ,",
    "ionizing sources should be distributed roughly according to the plummer mass distribution , with some degree of central concentration due to mass segregation .",
    "known sources have a strong central condensation ( figure [ mapfig ] ) , but this is partly due to survey biases . while this has implications for the ionization conditions in the innermost parts of the cluster , the tidal radius is sufficiently far from the cluster centre that ionizing sources can be treated as a point object .    _ parametric uncertainties : _ our model adopts the best - estimate values on the plummer scale radius , cluster mass , central electron density , and other , less important quantities .",
    "we have also fixed a plummer model as the density distribution .    _",
    "no diffusion : _ we do not consider diffusion of different ionic species within the gas , nor any fractionation of elements this produces , nor any outward thermal energy transport that occurs .",
    "such a treatment requires more detailed study of magnetic properties of the plasma .    _",
    "stellar velocity dispersion : _ we have assumed that mass is injected into the icm by a static , homogeneous population of stars following the plummer potential . in reality , stars have an additional dispersive velocity : @xmath216 km s@xmath6 at the cluster centre , decreasing to @xmath213 km s@xmath6 at the half - mass radius @xcite . an additional velocity component comes from the expansion velocity of the stellar winds ( thought to be @xmath010 km s@xmath6 for most evolved globular cluster giants ; e.g.  @xcite ) . material ejected from these stars has more momentum than modelled .",
    "this momentum will disperse in turbulent motion in a static icm cloud , leading to an additional heating term which will cause the expansion of the cloud , increasing the mass - loss rate from its outer edge .",
    "_ stellar evolution variation : _ we have not accounted for the fact that a variety of evolutionary outcomes are possible for stars , even in the simple stellar population of a globular cluster .",
    "a small percentage of binary stars will merge , becoming blue stragglers .",
    "these will have a higher luminosity and will be able to ionize more icm",
    ". a variety of helium abundances may be present in globular clusters .",
    "helium - rich stars evolve faster , thus helium - rich agb stars are presently of lower mass .",
    "these produce lower - luminosity post - agb stars with less ionizing radiation .",
    "of all the massive globular clusters , 47 tuc has one of the most homogeneous populations , so this should not be a large effect @xcite .",
    "_ other heating mechanisms : _ a variety of additional heating mechanisms are possible , which will have a similar effect .",
    "these include all the previously considered heating sources for icm in globular clusters : blue horizontal branch stars ( though these are not so relevant for 47 tuc ) , main sequence stellar winds , pulsar winds , etc .",
    "_ halo gas shocking : _ we have yet to consider that the material can also be removed from the cluster by bow shocking by interstellar gas .",
    "@xcite show that the bow shock around a 47-tuc - like cluster is expected to approach within a few parsecs from the cluster core . however , this was for an internal temperature of @xmath5210000 k and a density for halo gas which is larger than the value typically assumed in the region of 47 tuc ( @xmath00.007 @xmath37 ; @xcite ) by a factor of around 100 .",
    "the combination of these factors would suggest that the true stand - off radius is likely to be considerably further from the cluster core .",
    "we suggest that another look at the hydrodynamic models would be helpful in understanding the interplay between the intracluster and halo gas .",
    "we have re - run our final cloudy model , changing the cluster parameters in turn , and again iterating until we reach a stable solution . in some cases",
    ", a solution could not be reached when the change in temperature with the tested parameter became too great .",
    "examination of these cases showed that this happens when recombination becomes important . at this point , the icm rapidly collapses into a neutral state , where it has the potential to build up in within cluster , possible forming another generation of stars .    without a prediction of a central icm density or total icm mass",
    ", we can not make more than broad estimates , based on taking our model for 47 tuc and scaling certain parameters .",
    "we therefore caution the reader that these results are not exact predictions of clusters with parameters changed in this way .",
    "figure [ cloudyvfig ] shows that the implied jeans - escape efficiency ( @xmath196 ) is fairly small at small radii within 47 tuc , decreases to a minimum at around @xmath07 pc , then increases to exceed equality at @xmath0100 pc . for a fixed cluster mass",
    ", we can naively predict that tidal escape through the lagrangian points may be more important for clusters with smaller tidal radii , however this is modified by the icm density ( eq .  ( [ densityeq ] ) ) .",
    "the icm sound speed is largely set by the ( largely fixed ) temperature of the ionizing sources , the total icm mass should be related linearly to the tidal radius .",
    "however , the enclosed volume will be @xmath197 , hence the average icm density will vary as @xmath198 . perhaps unsurprisingly , larger",
    ", more - massive clusters can be expected to have denser icm .      to test sensitivity to cluster density , we began with our time - averaged hydrostatic model .",
    "we constructed a series of models with an identical total cluster mass and icm mass , but different plummer radii .",
    "we allowed the system to reach a stable density and temperature structure .",
    "diffuse clusters had correspondingly diffuse icm , with a higher density , higher mass - loss rate but only marginally lower temperature at the tidal radius ( kept constant at 55.4 pc ) .",
    "models for densities a few times that of 47 tuc did not converge , as they became divergent when recombination occurred .",
    "we therefore estimate that clusters a few times denser than 47 tuc ( but of the same mass ) should retain their icm .    though we do not model them here",
    ", changes to the shape of the cluster potential will also impact the retention of icm .",
    "a key factor is the central density of the cluster , as this sets the recombination efficiency . increasing the stellar density corresponds to an increase in central escape velocity as @xmath199 .",
    "the difference between our modelled plummer potential ( @xmath200 km s@xmath6 ) and that calculated by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; 68.8 km s@xmath6 ) corresponds to a density increase by a factor of three .",
    "the velocities at the half - mass radius match more closely ( 38 and 32 km s@xmath6 , respectively ) .",
    "taking the @xcite potential , it would be possible that clusters of similar mass which are only slightly more dense than 47 tuc could retain their icm .      in this test",
    ", we kept a constant cluster density and tidal radius , and scaled the total and icm masses .",
    "we again iterated the density and cloudy models to reach a stable density and temperature structure",
    ".    clusters less massive than 47 tuc had a lower central density , but higher density and temperature beyond @xmath040 pc , leading to faster mass loss . a model with twice the mass of 47 tuc shows @xmath01 per cent neutral hydrogen in the centre , with a lower total mass - loss rate than 47 tuc .",
    "clusters more than three times the mass of 47 tuc did not converge as recombination became important .",
    "we therefore estimate that clusters more than @xmath03@xmath40 the mass of 47 tuc would retain their icm .",
    "additional mesa models were calculated for stellar masses of 1.15 and 2.00 m@xmath1 and synthetic 47-tuc - like clusters calculated . in higher - mass stars ,",
    "the post - agb evolution is faster and the mass - loss rate higher .",
    "hence , the average ionization parameter ( number of uv photons per hydrogen atom ) decreases as stellar mass is increased . from our present - day , 0.899 m@xmath1 model has an average ionization parameter of 2300 .",
    "this dropped to 800 for the 5 gyr , 1.15 m@xmath1 model and 300 for the 1 gyr , 2 m@xmath1 model . in the 2-m@xmath1 model ,",
    "the ionization parameter at times fell to as low as 20 .",
    "depending on the central icm density , stellar density and tidal evaporation of the cluster during the last 10 gyr , we predict that the icm of 47 tuc may have reached neutrality around or shortly before 1 gyr in age",
    ". we can not accurately define this age at present : ionization by main sequence stars is not considered here , but is expected to decline with cluster age , reaching the uv flux in the solar neighbourhood after @xmath0250 myr ( 4 m@xmath1 ; zhukovska et al .",
    ", in prep . ) .",
    "changes in the stellar death rate due to stellar evolution and cluster evaporation have also not been considered .",
    "using these relations , we can qualitatively predict what happens when our model is perturbed . in our model ,",
    "the icm remains permanently ionized and simply expands dynamically to fill the void left by material boiled off its tidal surface .",
    "we can expect this process to happen provided a sufficient density can be maintained at the tidal radius for either jeans or tidal escape to be effective .",
    "this is expected to be true for any ionized system : if material is not lost , then density will increase , recombination will increase , and extra ionizing photons will be absorbed , heating the system , increasing pressure support and expanding the cloud .",
    "however , if icm density is allowed to increase sufficiently that all the ionizing photons are absorbed , the strmgren sphere will contract to within the cluster and the icm will become neutral .",
    "the temperature of the icm will decrease , the escape rate of material will decrease , icm density will increase , boosting the recombination rate .",
    "this results in a situation whereby material can gravitationally sink to the centre of the globular cluster and build up a larger neutral icm .",
    "few ( if any ) present - day clusters should have the required combination of mass and density to maintain and retain a neutral icm , even in small , localized regions .",
    "the strongest candidates are massive , core - collapsed clusters , of which m15 is among the best candidates . in the present day",
    ", this would require a catastrophic increase in localized mass - loss rate from stars , e.g.  through the instantaneous ejection of a substantial part of a star s atmosphere during a stellar encounter or binary merger .",
    "a localized over - density in the icm could allow a cloud of icm to persist over a short period of time .",
    "we put this forward as an explanation for the small icm cloud in m15 @xcite .",
    "we therefore predict that this should be quickly evaporating .      in the past",
    ", increasing icm density to the point where the icm can be retained should have been easier .",
    "no globular clusters currently exist with masses more than the critical @xmath03@xmath40 the mass of 47 tuc .",
    "@xcite find ngc 6388 to be 1.45@xmath40 as massive as 47 tuc , m54 to be 1.73@xmath40 as massive and @xmath201 cen to be 2.2@xmath40 as massive .",
    "m54 is uniquely placed in the heart of the sgr dsph galaxy , thus has a peculiar history ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "both of the other clusters , ngc 6388 and @xmath201 cen , have some of the best examples among galactic globular clusters of multiple populations ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "typically , these are manifest as stars with differing light element abundances ( c , n , o , ... , si ) .",
    "however @xmath201 cen also shows a spread in [ fe / h ] , and is sometimes considered a ` transition object ' : a dwarf galaxy nucleus that has shed its dark matter and stellar halo either through internal mass loss or external tidal disruption @xcite .",
    "such objects blur the line between globular clusters and galaxies , which may be best defined by the presence of dark matter @xcite .",
    "globular cluster systems originally had several times more mass than their modern - day counterparts .",
    "this was subsequently lost as stars were tidally stripped or underwent mass loss in the intervening @xmath01013 gyr .",
    "ejecta from massive stars , which underwent type ii supernovae , had sufficient velocity to escape the proto - cluster , hence did not typically increase [ fe / h ] beyond the cluster s nascent value .",
    "current models explain the differing pattern of light elements pattern by preferentially retaining material from heavier ( @xmath038 m@xmath1 ) agb stars , which lose mass in the few @xmath4010@xmath202 years after the cluster s formation @xcite .",
    "this ejecta can then collect in the centre of the young clusters , forming subsequent generations of stars , interrupted by occasional type ia supernovae , whose ejecta kinematically cleared the clusters ( including @xmath201 cen ; @xcite ) .",
    "our above calculations predict that clusters only need to be a few times more massive , or have stars a few times the mass of the sun , in order for the icm to be retained by the cluster .",
    "the more - massive , present - day galactic globular clusters would therefore appear to have met both of these criteria in their early existences .",
    "we suggest these systems were able to retain their icm , allowing the formation of more than one generation of stars .",
    "more - massive clusters should retain their icm for longer , producing several generations and yielding a larger light - element abundance spread .",
    "these clusters will become ` transition objects ' ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) : objects with broad spreads in [ @xmath203/h ] ( or even [ fe / h ] ) but without necessarily having the dark matter halos of dwarf galaxies .",
    "we therefore present a new mass hierarchy , supplementing that of @xcite to include clusters enrichment history :    1 .",
    "the lowest - mass globular clusters should never have had sufficient mass to retain their icm , forming a single generation of stars ; 2 .",
    "higher - mass globular clusters should have had a sufficiently deep gravitational potential to retain the winds of intermediate - mass agb stars ( @xmath038 m@xmath1 ) , forming multiple - population clusters ; 3 .",
    "the highest - mass globular clusters , principly @xmath201 cen , were massive enough to retain type ii supernovae ejecta , but not massive enough to attain / retain dark matter halos , forming ` transition objects ' ; 4 .   objects more massive than this were also able to retain dark matter halos and probably also type ia supernovae ejecta , forming dwarf galaxies .    comparisons of stellar yield calculations with the spread in light and heavy elemental abundances of stars in clusters can tell us the cut - off point beyond which icm was ionized and able to escape the cluster .",
    "this would help refine this hierarchy in terms of quantitative mass limits , probing the dynamical history and mass evolution of clusters , and the role of dark matter in small bodies .",
    "we therefore strongly encourage further studies of the chemical enrichment of these most - massive clusters , in the context of their icm evolution .",
    "we have shown that uv radiation from hot post - agb stars and cooling white dwarfs can continually ionize the observed icm of 47 tucanae , and that these provide the dominant source of ionizing radiation within the cluster .",
    "we show that individual stars ( e.g. uit-14 ) become sufficiently uv - bright to ionize the icm once they reach @xmath214000 k on their post - agb tracks , and continue to effectively ionize the icm for 24 myr while on the white dwarf cooling track .",
    "this timescale is sufficiently longer than the 80000-year stellar death rate that the cluster is permanently ionized .",
    "the inferred uv flux from observations is @xmath01060@xmath40 greater than that needed to ionize the icm .",
    "however , without imaging near 1000  , it is not currently possible to discern exactly which sources are the major ionizers within the cluster .",
    "we have used stellar population modelling to determine the uv dissociation of icm in a model of 47 tucanae , showing that the ionization is a long - term phenomenon that is likely to be present in other clusters , including ones of lower metallicity and lower total mass .",
    "we use a hydrostatic model to show that a thermalized icm can expand sufficiently that it can overflow the cluster s tidal radius .",
    "however , with the icm cloud truncated at this radius , jeans escape should be more effective than tidal escape .",
    "the icm responds to this lost material on the dynamical timescale , thus the mass of icm present should be equal to the mass lost by cluster stars over a dynamical timescale .",
    "our modelled dynamical timescale and clearing timescale for 47 tuc agree at @xmath04 myr , implying @xmath011 m@xmath1 of ionized icm exists within that cluster .",
    "we estimate that this will allow material to be cleared from all extant globular clusters , but may allow icm to be retained by clusters of @xmath103 @xmath40 10@xmath8 m@xmath1 .",
    "the precise value will depend on the mass and density profile of the cluster , and its interaction with the galactic gravitational field and the surrounding halo gas .",
    "younger clusters are better able to retain their icm : clusters are more massive , the mass - loss rate per star is higher and the post - agb evolution of stars happens faster",
    ". this should encourage the growth of multiple stellar populations in the more massive and denser clusters , as is observed .",
    "we predict the lowest - mass globular clusters should have few second - generation stars , exhibiting little enrichment .",
    "conversely , a mass of little more that of 47 tuc may set lower mass limit for ` transition objects ' , which comprise of multiple stellar populations with varying [ fe / h ] . between the bounds of @xmath010@xmath8 and 10@xmath204 m@xmath1 should lie a region in which some clusters were able to retain their icm but are now longer capable of doing so .",
