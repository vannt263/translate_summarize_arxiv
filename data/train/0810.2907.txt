    "polymer translocation through a nanopore is a challenging problem in polymer physics and it also plays a critical role in numerous biological processes , such as dna and rna translocation across nuclear pores , protein transport through membrane channels , and virus injection .    in a seminal experimental paper , kasianowicz _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite demonstrated that an electric field can drive single - stranded dna and rna molecules through the water - filled @xmath8-hemolysin channel and that the passage of each molecule is signaled by a blockade in the channel current .",
    "these observations can be directly used to characterize the polymer length .",
    "triggered by their experiments and various potential technological applications  @xcite , such as rapid dna sequencing , gene therapy and controlled drug delivery , the polymer translocation has become a subject of intensive experimental  @xcite and theoretical  @xcite studies .",
    "one of the fundamental questions that has been addressed in the community is how the translocation time @xmath9 depends on the system parameters and the polymer characteristics , such as : chain length @xmath5  @xcite , sequence and secondary structure  @xcite , pore length @xmath10 and width @xmath11  @xcite , driving force @xmath12  @xcite , and polymer - pore interactions  @xcite .",
    "a central issue from the point of view of sequencing is whether dna translocation through a nanopore can be used to determine the detailed sequence structure of the molecule  @xcite .",
    "it has been demonstrated experimentally  @xcite that dna translocation dynamics is strongly influenced by _ nucleotide - pore _ interactions .",
    "intuitively , for sufficiently strong attraction , the residence time of each monomer in the pore should increase , resulting in a much longer translocation time . in a recent letter ,",
    "we have investigated the influence of base - pore interaction on the translocation dynamics using ld simulations  @xcite .",
    "the results show that an attractive interaction increases translocation time slowly for weak attraction while an exponential increase is observed for strong attraction in the activated regime  @xcite . under weak driving force and strong attractive",
    "force , the translocation time shows non - monotonic behavior .",
    "our results are in good agreement with experimental findings  @xcite .",
    "while a dna is composed of four different nucleotides  @xcite , to date most of the theoretical treatments have focused on scaling and universal aspects of translocation of a homogeneous polymers , although several experiments  @xcite show that in the real biological systems inhomogeneities in the structure and interactions between polymer and other molecules might have a significant effect on the overall dynamics .",
    "previously , we have considered heteropolymers consisting of two types of monomers labeled @xmath0 and @xmath1 , which are distinguished by the magnitude of the driving force that they experience inside the pore  @xcite .",
    "this model captured some essential features of the heteropolymer translocation .",
    "however , for real biopolymers such as dna and rna , no charge difference between the monomers ( nucleotides ) exists . instead , the nucleotide - pore interactions are base specific  @xcite . thus a more realistic model for studying",
    "the influence of structure on biopolymers translocation should differentiate bases @xmath0 and @xmath1 by different base - pore interactions . in a recent letter  @xcite , we have adopted such a model and investigated hetero - dnas with symmetric blocks using langevin dynamics simulations .",
    "we found that the translocation time depends strongly on the block length as well as on the orientation of which base entering the pore first .    in this paper",
    "we extend our results for the dna composed of symmetric blocks , furnish more general characteristics of the residence time inside the pore , and provide more comprehensive results for the translocation dynamics of various sequences of a two component hetero - dna .",
    "we also provide a simple interpretation for the sequence dependence of the monomer waiting time distribution and the total translocation time .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we briefly describe our model and the simulation technique . in section iii",
    ", we present our results .",
    "finally , the conclusions and discussion are presented in section iv .",
    "in our numerical simulations , the polymer chains are modeled as bead - spring chains . excluded volume interaction between monomers",
    "is modeled by a short range repulsive lj potential : @xmath13+{\\varepsilon}$ ] for @xmath14 and 0 for @xmath15 . here , @xmath16 is the diameter of a monomer , and @xmath17 is the depth of the potential .",
    "the connectivity between neighboring monomers is modeled as a finite extension nonlinear elastic ( fene ) spring with @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the distance between consecutive monomers , @xmath20 is the spring constant and @xmath21 is the maximum allowed separation between connected monomers .",
    "we consider a 2d geometry as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , where the walls along the @xmath22 direction are formed by stationary particles within a distance @xmath16 from each other .",
    "the pore of length @xmath10 and width @xmath11 are formed from two rows of stationary particles represented by black circles in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . between all monomer - wall particle pairs",
    ", there exists the same short range repulsive lj interaction as described above .",
    "the base - pore interaction is modeled by a lj potential with a cutoff of @xmath23 and interaction strength @xmath24 for the base @xmath0 and @xmath25 for the base @xmath1 .",
    "this interaction can be either attractive or repulsive depending on the position of the monomer from the pore particles .    in the langevin dynamics simulation , each monomer",
    "is subjected to conservative , frictional , and random forces , respectively , with  @xcite @xmath26 , where @xmath6 is the monomer s mass , @xmath27 is the friction coefficient , @xmath28 is the monomer s velocity , and @xmath29 is the random force which satisfies the fluctuation - dissipation theorem . the external force is expressed as @xmath30 , where @xmath12 is the external force strength exerted on the monomers in the pore , and @xmath31 is a unit vector in the direction along the pore axis .    the lj parameters @xmath17 , @xmath16 and the bead mass @xmath6 fix the system energy , length and mass units respectively , leading to the corresponding time scale @xmath32 and force scale @xmath33 . in our model , each bead corresponds to a kuhn length of a single - stranded dna containing approximately three nucleotide bases , so the value of @xmath34 nm  @xcite .",
    "the average mass of a base in dna is about 312 amu , so the bead mass @xmath35 amu .",
    "we set @xmath36 , so the interaction strength @xmath17 corresponds to @xmath37 j at a temperature 295 k. this leads to a time scale of 32.1 ps and a force scale of 2.3 pn .",
    "the remaining dimensionless parameters in the model are chosen to be @xmath38 ,",
    "@xmath39 , @xmath40 .",
    "in addition , the driving force for a bead in the pore is set as @xmath41 unless otherwise stated .",
    "this value corresponds to a voltage of about 187.9 mv across the pore ( assuming three unit charges on a bead and the effective charge 0.094e for a unit charge  @xcite ) , within the range of experimental parameters  @xcite .",
    "the pore width @xmath42 .",
    "this ensures that monomers @xmath0 and @xmath1 encounter an attractive force inside the pore  @xcite .",
    "the base - pore interactions @xmath43 and @xmath44 are chosen based on comparison of the theoretical results  @xcite with the experimental data  @xcite for the translocation time distribution histogram of poly(dc)@xmath45 and poly(da)@xmath45 .",
    "it is worthwhile to note that the translocation time depends strongly on the pore length @xmath10 .",
    "we have checked that @xmath46 nm produces average translocation times @xmath47100 @xmath48s in accordance with the experimental data @xcite .",
    "for computational efficiency we present results for @xmath49 ( @xmath50 nm ) here .",
    "the langevin equation is integrated in time by a method described by ermak and buckholz  @xcite in 2d .    to create the initial configuration , the first monomer of the chain is placed in the entrance of the pore .",
    "the polymer is then allowed to relax to obtain an equilibrium configuration .",
    "the translocation time is defined as the time interval between the entrance of the first bead into the pore and the exit of the last bead .",
    "the estimate for the translocation time was obtained by neglecting any failed translocation and then calculating the average duration of the successful translocation .",
    "typically , we average our data over 2000 independent runs with different initial conditions .     and the pore width @xmath42 .",
    "as demonstrated by experiments  @xcite , a nanopore might be used for dna sequencing .",
    "the most fundamental concern has been whether @xmath8-hemolysin or any other natural or synthetic nanopore is capable of recognizing dna with single base resolution . to address this question",
    ", we first investigate the translocation of poly(dc ) with a single position - specific base @xmath0 substitutions . without any loss of generality",
    ", we present here only results for chain length @xmath51 , as many of the main conclusions here are not dependent on the chain length . fig .",
    "2 shows the waiting time distribution for poly(dc@xmath52dadc@xmath53 ) .",
    "the waiting time of the monomer @xmath54 is defined as the average time between the events that monomer @xmath54 and monomer @xmath55 exit the pore  @xcite .",
    "it yields more detailed information for the translocation process than the overall translocation time .",
    "compared with the waiting time distribution for poly(dc@xmath56 ) , the waiting times for @xmath57 are different , where one minimum ( @xmath58 ) and maximum ( @xmath59 ) are observed .",
    "this result can be easily understood through the following consideration .",
    "the pore of length @xmath49 can accommodate @xmath60 monomers on the average .",
    "when the monomer @xmath61 is at the end of the pore ready to exit to the _ trans _ side , the monomer corresponding to base @xmath0 has just entered the pore through the _ cis _ side .",
    "the presence of the @xmath0 monomer at this end of the pore reduces the probability of the backward motion of the polymer and hence the waiting time starts to decrease starting from @xmath62 till it reaches a minimum at @xmath58 when the @xmath0 monomer is about half way inside the pore , after which the waiting time of subsequent monomers leaving the pore starts to increase until it reaches @xmath59 which corresponds to the point where the monomer @xmath0 is at the end of the pore ready to exit to the _ cis _ side .",
    "this maximum in waiting time results from the activated nature of the escape of the monomer @xmath0 from the pore .",
    "after the monomer corresponding to base @xmath0 has translocated , the next few monomers still have longer waiting times compared with those in a homopolymer poly(dc@xmath56 ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that the attraction between the pore and the monomer corresponding to base @xmath0 induces more backward events .",
    "for other position - specific single base @xmath0 substitutions , we observed similar results .",
    "dadc@xmath53 ) .",
    "here @xmath43 , @xmath44 . ]",
    "da@xmath63dc@xmath64 ) .",
    "here @xmath43 , @xmath44 . ]    for longer base @xmath0 sequence substitutions such as poly(dc@xmath52da@xmath63dc@xmath64 ) , the results are shown in fig .",
    "they can be understood following the same reasoning presented above for the single @xmath0 sequence .",
    "we still observe one minimum and one maximum between @xmath57 .",
    "as expected , the beginning of the decrease in waiting time still starts at @xmath62 corresponding to @xmath61 .",
    "the maximum now changes to to @xmath65 when the last monomer of type @xmath0 is at the end of the pore ready to exit to the _ trans _ side . for other sequences such as poly(dc@xmath52da@xmath66dc@xmath67 ) , the start of the downturn at @xmath62 and the minimum at @xmath58 remains the same while the maximum will be shifted to @xmath68 .",
    "thus , we can conclude that if the waiting time distribution can be accurately determined , it allows identification of the sequence @xmath0 in a straightforward manner .      in this section ,",
    "we present results for the translocation dynamics for hetero - dnas with repeat units @xmath2 , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the length of the bases @xmath0 and @xmath1 in a single unit respectively .",
    "we define @xmath69 as the block length of the polymer , and the volume fraction of the @xmath1 component as @xmath70 . in the translocation dynamics of these hetero - dnas",
    ", it turns out that we need to distinguish the two different cases where the base @xmath0 or the base @xmath1 first enters the pore , respectively .",
    "we first examine short repeat units with @xmath71 for the whole range of volume fractions @xmath3 .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "4 . because the attraction between the pore and the base @xmath0 is stronger , the total translocation time @xmath72 for poly(da)@xmath56 ( @xmath73)is longer than the corresponding value @xmath74 for a poly(dc)@xmath56 as found in our previous work  @xcite . the solid curve in fig . 4 represents a simple average of the translocation time for poly(da)@xmath56 and poly(dc)@xmath56 given by @xmath75 .",
    "it can be seen that the actual results for the translocation time of hetero - dnas with short repeat units are always lower than this average , indicating a correlation effect between different monomer blocks .",
    "as expected , the translocation time decreases with increasing @xmath3 . for @xmath76 ( @xmath77 ) ,",
    "the translocation time is almost independent on the orientation of which base enters the pore first .",
    "this is because the pore with length @xmath49 can accommodate more than 3 monomers .",
    "thus , for @xmath76 , the translocation times for the hetero - dnas are determined largely by the configurations where all the @xmath0 monomers are trapped inside the pore , independent of whether the base @xmath0 or @xmath1 enters the pore first . in this regime , the translocation time can be fitted empirically by the formula @xmath78 .     for different values of @xmath6 and @xmath7 as a function of the volume fraction of the base @xmath1 .",
    "here @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and the chain length @xmath51 . ]",
    "for small values of @xmath79 ( @xmath80 ) , the translocation time @xmath9 does depend on the orientation , with @xmath9 being larger for the case where the base @xmath1 enters the pore first .",
    "this asymmetry is due to the fact that the translocation time is now controlled by the last block @xmath0 exiting the pore . when this is not followed by a block @xmath1 , the activation barrier for the exit of the last block is large , leading to a much longer total translocation time . in this regime",
    ", @xmath9 shows faster exponential decay with increasing @xmath3 when the base @xmath0 entering the pore first . to quantify the asymmetry",
    ", we define @xmath19 as the ratio of translocation times for the case where base @xmath1 enters the pore first to the case where @xmath0 enters the pore first .",
    "5 shows @xmath19 for different sequences .",
    "it is clear that the asymmetry increase with the length of the base @xmath0 sequence .",
    "as a function of the different composition for repeat units @xmath2 . here",
    ", we define @xmath19 as the ratio of translocation times for base @xmath1 entering the pore first to base @xmath0 entering the pore first . here , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and the chain length @xmath51 .",
    "]    compared to the total translocation time , the waiting time for individual bases yields more information for the detailed sequence structure as shown in the last section . to show how the waiting time can be used to read a periodic sequence , we show the result for poly(da@xmath63dc@xmath81)@xmath82 in fig .",
    "there are several features worth noting .",
    "first , the waiting time of the last block @xmath0 is much longer than the rest , due to the activated nature of the last block @xmath0 .",
    "this effect is more pronounced for @xmath1 entering the pore first , since it leads to a much larger activation energy for the exit of the last block .",
    "for the orientation in which @xmath0 enters the pore first , both the monomers in the last block @xmath0 and the last block @xmath1 exhibit longer waiting times , but not as strongly as the other orientation as the corresponding activation energies are smaller .",
    "the orientation of dna can thus be differentiated in this case .",
    "second , the sequence lengths @xmath83 for the base @xmath0 and @xmath84 for the base @xmath1 are clearly distinguished in comparison with the waiting time distributions of their homopolymers .    moreover , we find that the waiting times for the ordered dna with repeat units @xmath85 exhibit `` fringes '' reminiscent of optical interference pattern .",
    "this is due to the fact that near the end of exit of any block @xmath0 , the waiting time increases to a maximum because of the increase in the activation energy .",
    "thus the number of peaks is exactly equal to @xmath86 , which is the periodicity of the sequences ( cf .",
    "dc@xmath81)@xmath82 . here , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and the chain length @xmath51 .",
    "]      previously , we observed that the translocation time of homopolymers with pure repulsive interaction with the pore scales as @xmath87 with the chain length for relatively short chains ( @xmath88 )  @xcite , where @xmath89 is the flory exponent in 2d  @xcite . for heteropolymers consisting of two types of monomers that have a pure repulsive interaction with the pore and distinguished only by the magnitude of the driving force that they experience inside the pore",
    ", we find that these scaling properties remain valid with arbitrary repeat unit  @xcite .",
    "this could be easily understood by noting that at a higher level of coarse - graining , the microstructure of the chain is irrelevant as far as universal scaling properties are concerned .    when attractive interaction is introduced between the monomers and the wall of the pore ,",
    "we have found recently that while the scaling @xmath87 is still valid for poly(dc ) with the weaker attraction , the translocation time @xmath9 shows non - monotonic behavior as a function of the chain length for poly(da ) due to the strong attractive force between poly(da ) and the pore  @xcite .",
    "this leads to an interesting question on the translocation time @xmath9 scales with @xmath5 for different sequences @xmath2 in heteropolymers considered in this work . in fig .",
    "7 we plot the results showing how the translocation time scales as a function of chain length @xmath5 for different repeat structures @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 , and @xmath93 . for @xmath92 and @xmath93 , the translocation time @xmath9 depends on the orientation , but the orientation does not affect the qualitative dependence of @xmath9 on @xmath5 .    for @xmath90 , the scaling exponent is @xmath94 which is close to @xmath95 .",
    "however , with increasing block length of the base @xmath0 , the effective scaling exponent decreases . for @xmath91",
    ", it is @xmath96 and it is less than @xmath97 for @xmath92 , @xmath93 .",
    "the novel dependence on the length of dna is due to the change from the non - activated regime for weak attractive or pure repulsive interaction to an activated regime for strong attractive interaction",
    ". it would be desirable to have measurement made over a larger range of composition to critically test our predictions for the effective scaling exponent .    , and @xmath44 ]",
    "in this work , we have investigated the dynamics of dna translocation through a nanopore driven by an external force using 2d langevin dynamics simulations with an aim to understand how various aspects of the translocation dynamics is affected by a specific sequence .",
    "we have we have considered coarse - grained models of hetero - dnas consisting of two types of bases @xmath0 and @xmath1 , which are differentiated by the different base - pore interactions , such as a strong attractive force between the pore and the base @xmath0 and a weaker attractive force between the pore and the base @xmath1 . from a series of studies on polymers with sequences",
    "@xmath2 , we find the exponential dependence of the translocation time on @xmath3 , the volume fraction of the base @xmath1 . for longer sequences with",
    "@xmath4 the translocation time strongly depends on the orientation of dna , namely the condition which base enters the pore first .",
    "these results are interpreted according to the waiting times of the individual bases .",
    "we find that the waiting time displays intriguing fringe patterns that can be understood from the process of emptying the more attractive subblocks from the pore .",
    "this also leads to a very simple qualitative understanding of the orientational dependence of the translocation time depending on which base enters the pore first .",
    "furthermore , based on the waiting time distribution , the sequence lengths @xmath6 , @xmath7 and their periodicity can be distinguished .",
    "one may wonder to what extent our studies are relevant to bringing this observations into practice and to develop a `` fast sequencing machine '' ? among the most important conclusions here",
    "is that the waiting time distribution of individual monomers can be used to identify sequences in heteropolymers .",
    "it is worth noting in this context that the ionization potentials for different polynucleotides are different .",
    "therefore , it is plausible that laser - induced attractive interactions along with fluorescence spectroscopy could be used to make a device that will detect either the waiting time or the number of monomers inside the pore as a function of time .    this work has been supported in part by the academy of finland through its center of excellence comp and transpoly consortium grants .",

    "<S> we investigate the dynamics of dna translocation through a nanopore driven by an external force using langevin dynamics simulations in two dimensions ( 2d ) to study how the translocation dynamics depend on the details of the dna sequences . </S>",
    "<S> we consider a coarse - grained model of dna built from two bases @xmath0 and @xmath1 , having different base - pore interactions , _ e_.g . </S>",
    "<S> , a strong ( weak ) attractive force between the pore and the base @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) inside the pore . from a series of studies on hetero - dnas with repeat units </S>",
    "<S> @xmath2 , we find that the translocation time decreases exponentially as a function of the volume fraction @xmath3 of the base @xmath1 . for longer @xmath0 sequences with @xmath4 , </S>",
    "<S> the translocation time strongly depends on the orientation of dna , namely which base enters the pore first . </S>",
    "<S> our studies clearly demonstrate that for a dna of certain length @xmath5 with repeat units @xmath2 , the pattern exhibited by the waiting times of the individual bases and their periodicity can unambiguously determine the values of @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath5 respectively . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , a prospective experimental realization of this phenomenon may lead to fast and efficient sequence detection technic . </S>"
