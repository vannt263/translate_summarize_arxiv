    "_ isothermic parameterizations _ are synonyms of isothermal curvature line parameterizations @xcite , for surfaces immersed in euclidean spaces . by definition ,",
    "_ isothermic surfaces _ represent immersed surfaces which admit at least one isothermic parameterization .",
    "the initial motivation of this project came forward from solving bonnet problems analytically and numerically , by using cartan s theory of structure equations , and numerical analysis .",
    "the authors also studied dual surfaces , in the sense of christoffel transforms .",
    "such transforms exist exclusively for isothermic coordinate charts .    in a previous work @xcite",
    ", we solved bonnet problems in terms of cartan theory in conformal coordinates in the most general context of regular surfaces .",
    "that is , for any compatible first and second fundamental form , corresponding families of solutions were obtained ( up to roto - translations ) .    due to the high impact of isothermic",
    "coordinates in various areas , it became important to study necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of isothermic coordinates on surfaces ; and whenever such coordinates exist , a practical method of constructing them became imperative .",
    "we provide a method of constructing isothermic coordinate charts on surfaces which admit them , starting from an arbitrary chart ( parameterization ) .",
    "one of the primary applications of this work consists of numerical algorithms for surface visualization .",
    "many of these results can be generalized to immersions of @xmath0-dimensional manifolds in n - dimensional space forms , but our main goal was a construction algorithm with numerical implementation and visualization .",
    "this work exclusively involves immersed ( respectively , embedded ) surfaces in the euclidean @xmath1-dimensional space .",
    "a _ local surface _ is a differentiable mapping from an open , simply connected subset of the euclidean plane , to @xmath2 .",
    "various references use the name of _ patch of a surface _ , or _ local patch _ instead of local surface .",
    "we will call such a local surface a _ surface immersion _ , if the jacobian of the differential mapping has rank two at every point .",
    "this is equivalent to the differential map being 1 - 1 .",
    "remark that such a surface is generally not embedded .",
    "if the local surface ( immersion ) represents an injective mapping in itself , then we will call such a mapping an _ embedding _ , or an _",
    "injective patch_.    in a more global sense , a connected set @xmath3 in @xmath2 is said to be a _ regular 2-dimensional surface _ if for an arbitrary point @xmath4 there exist an open ball @xmath5 in @xmath2 with center at @xmath6 and a homeomorphism @xmath7 which maps @xmath8 onto an open disk on some plane in the space @xmath2 .",
    "such a homeomorphism is frequently called a _ chart _ , or a _ system of local coordinates on a surface_.    it is worth noting that , in the previous definition , the word disk can be replaced by an arbitrary open set of a plane , diffeomorphic to a disk .",
    "let us consider an immersion @xmath9 ( of an open , simply connected set ) in @xmath2 .",
    "note that the property of this map @xmath10 being an immersion is equivalent to the property that the vectors @xmath11 and @xmath12 are linearly independent at every point .",
    "these span a tangent plane at each point , that is , generate a tangent bundle",
    ". we will denote @xmath13 and call it the unit normal vector field , or gauss map ; it represents a map @xmath14 .",
    "recall that the notion of induced metric came from a bilinear map that acts as follows : @xmath16 , where the vectors @xmath17 and @xmath18 represent tangent vectors to the surface at the point @xmath6 . also recall that , locally , every smooth surface can be represented as a graph ( monge chart ) . in general",
    ", we will not work with monge charts , but with generic immersions .",
    "note that , if the actual immersion a surface is unknown and only the first fundamental form is given , then we do not possess much information about the geometric properties of the surface . by a classical result of bonnet , the geometry of surfaces exclusively depends on two quadratic differential forms .",
    "one of them is the metric , and the other is the second fundamental form .          unlike the first fundamental form",
    ", the second fundamental form is not necessarily positive definite .",
    "however , it is a symmetric bilinear form . since all directions in a tangent plane @xmath38 form a compact set homeomorphic to a circle , @xmath39 has at least one minimum and one maximum , i.e. , at least two extremal values . the maximum normal curvature @xmath40 and the minimum normal curvature @xmath41 are called principal curvatures .",
    "they represent the eigenvalues of the shape operator , and the eigenvectors corresponding to them are called principal directions .      in the classical literature ,",
    "surfaces whose mean curvature ( respectively , gaussian curvature ) is a constant have been studied extensively .",
    "constant mean curvature ( cmc ) surfaces represent a special subclass of bonnet surfaces , which in their turn represent an important subclass of isothermic surfaces .",
    "if the induced metric is a ( nonconstant ) multiple of the flat metric , then the immersion is said to be _ conformal _ , or _",
    "isothermal _ , or _ in conformal coordinates _ , i.e. @xmath42 and @xmath43 at every point .      a surface in @xmath2",
    "is said to be parameterized in _ isothermic coordinates _ if the given parameterization is conformal and in curvature line coordinates at the same time , i.e. it is given as an immersion @xmath44 such that @xmath45 and @xmath46        also note that at umbilic points ( i.e. , points where the normal curvature is the same in every direction ) , the actual choice of an orthogonal system of eigenvectors becomes problematic .",
    "therefore , we usually view all the umbilics as singularities .",
    "clearly , this point of view makes the sphere a very special example of isothermic surface !            this characteristic property ( in terms of @xmath52 being real ) is obvious from the definition of an isothermic surface , together with the formula of @xmath52 in terms of @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "let @xmath53 be a conformal immersion of an umbilic - free surface .",
    "the surface is isothermic if and only if there exists a holomorphic non - vanishing differential @xmath54 on @xmath47 and a function @xmath55 from @xmath47 to @xmath56 such that the hopf differential is of the form : @xmath57 it is easy to see that , in this case , @xmath58 is an isothermic coordinate .      _",
    "question : `` starting from a arbitrarily given immersion @xmath59 of an isothermic surface in the euclidean 3-space , is there a simple method of obtaining an isothermic parameterization @xmath60 corresponding to it ? '' _          b ) . multiplying the velocity vectors by a ` non - constant scaling function ' @xmath61 , namely a class @xmath62 non - constant function specific to this chapter ( not to be confused with the gaussian curvature ) .",
    "corresponding to this method , we obtained a condition that this function , @xmath63 , must satisfy , and we constructed isothermic coordinates from an arbitrary immersion , under the above - stated condition .",
    "solving a bonnet problem gives rise to a generic immersion , which is rarely isothermic ; constructing an isothermic parameterization for the same physical surface , whenever possible , presents a great deal of simplification .",
    "* applying geometric methods to mesh discretization which are both homogeneous and orthogonal ; * in structural mechanics , deriving the equation of shells along the principal directions ; * in architecture / industrial design , working with orthogonal meshes is often preferrable , in order to minimize the production cost ; * finding dual surfaces ( christoffel transforms ) .",
    "let @xmath64 be an * arbitrary * immersion , with velocities @xmath65 and @xmath66 , of a regular surface @xmath67 , where @xmath47 represents an open and simply connected domain .",
    "let us define the vector distributions @xmath68 where the function @xmath69 is positive and smooth , and the angle @xmath70 satisfies the following equation ( in terms of coefficients of the first and second fundamental forms corresponding to f ) :        * in these assumptions , the new coordinates @xmath78 are isothermic _ if and only if _ the corresponding smooth function @xmath63 , with respect to the two different charts , will satisfy the following equations : *        a ) .",
    "note that the geometric meaning of @xmath80 is of a rotation angle that changes at every point ( of a pre - orthonormalized frame after gramm - schmitt ) ; and the geometric meaning of @xmath69 is of a non - constant dilating ( scaling ) function of the unit tangent vectors , up to a pair of partial velocity vectors in isothermic coordinates at each point on the surface ( both of magnitude @xmath69 ) .",
    "b ) . consider the fractional expression of @xmath81 . if the initial parameterization would be an isothermic one",
    ", one can easily check that both the numerator and the denominator would become * zero * at umbilic points . for umbilics ,",
    "the expression would then be undetermined , and not undefined . in the following statement",
    "we assume that we are always away from umbilic points .",
    "however , even for the case of isolated umbilic points , the discrete algorithm allows a certain flexibility in choosing the size steps in such a way that the umbilic points can be avoided .          by the definition of * isothermic * coordinates , the vectors @xmath84 and @xmath85 represent the partial velocity vector fields of an isothermic parametrization @xmath78 if and only if they satisfy the following conditions simultaneously :      1 .",
    "it is easy to rewrite the first condition in an equivalent way . specifically , we obtain @xmath90 and @xmath91 + note that the @xmath92 is an immediate consequence of the definition of the initial vector field distribution @xmath93 .",
    "the second condition is also immediately implied by the two vector fields provided @xmath94 3 .",
    "we will show that even the third condition is also implied by the vector construction in the theorem hypothesis .",
    "+ in order to reformulate the third condition , let @xmath95 and @xmath96 , for simplification .",
    "+ therefore , @xmath75 and @xmath76 will become @xmath97 for the last identity , consider @xmath98 since @xmath99 and @xmath100 , then all terms with @xmath101 and @xmath102 will be zero ; replacing the partial derivatives of @xmath103 and @xmath104 into the equation we obtain @xmath105 now , if we rewrite the equation as @xmath106 and plug it into the equation , then we obtain @xmath107 4 .   last but not least , we will analyze the fourth condition in its equivalent forms , and show it is actually equivalent to the pde system satisfied by the function @xmath63 .",
    "again , consider the equations - + @xmath108 @xmath109 the compatibility condition is rewritten as @xmath110 after some simplifications , we get a rephrasing on the compatibility condition @xmath111 in the equivalent form @xmath112 since the compatibility condition above has to be satisfied at every point of the domain and since @xmath103 and @xmath104 are linearly independent , the condition 4 ) is equivalent to the following pde system @xmath113 @xmath114 remark however , that the previous system , in @xmath115 and @xmath116 is compatible and has a unique solution , namely the pde system satisfied by @xmath63 in the statement of the theorem .    on the construction algorithm of the isothermic parameterization @xmath78 starting from the initial , arbitrary parameterization @xmath117 , it becomes natural to write down the actual formulas which describe this transformation of coordinates ( change of chart ) .",
    "the jacobian of this change of chart can be easily computed , and is presented in the following proposition .",
    "the jacobian of the change of chart @xmath118 has the following entries : @xmath119 and @xmath120 moreover , each of the pde systems @xmath117 listed above , namely - and - , has a unique solution , given a choice of initial values @xmath121 .",
    "it is straightforward to verify that the compatibility conditions , @xmath122 and @xmath123 , are verified , because the condition @xmath124 is already fulfilled .",
    "given the initial value @xmath125 and @xmath126 by results from @xcite , the pde system above has an unique solution represented by the chart @xmath117 which corresponds to @xmath127 .    in the previous theorem",
    ", we proved that the existence of a certain scaling function @xmath69 of arbitrarily given coordinates is necessary and sufficient in producing some new , isothermic coordinates .",
    "@xmath63 represents the solution of a system of differential equations , .",
    "moreover , we can provide a condition for such a scaling function @xmath63 to exist and be unique .    as in the statement of the previous theorem ,",
    "let @xmath128 and @xmath129 represent the coefficients of first and second fundamental forms of the arbitrary immersion @xmath130 , and let @xmath70 be given by the same condition as before .",
    "assume the change of chart @xmath131 is introduced in the same way as in the previous theorem .",
    "let us now consider the pde system as defined by .    the following condition @xmath132 assures the existence of a function @xmath69 that satisfies the system of differential equations .",
    "moreover , if the solution @xmath63 exists , then it will be unique , given some appropriate initial value condition .",
    "* roto - translations ( euclidean motions ) - which can be taken care of by setting a base point and an initial moving frame ; * constant multiplications of @xmath63 ( similarity transformations ) ; * four possible values of @xmath70 which all satisfy ( one for each quadrant : meaning that we will have to choose only one , when we perform the construction algorithm for isothermic coordinates ) .",
    "consider the system @xmath133 which , after simplifications , actually becomes equivalent to system - : @xmath134 let @xmath135 in order to simplify the computation . with these simplifications ,",
    "the system - becomes @xmath136 or in its equivalent form @xmath137 since the quantity @xmath63 is always positive , showing compatibility condition @xmath138 is equivalent to showing compatibility condition @xmath139 next , we write the mixed partial derivatives of @xmath140 in the following way @xmath141+w_1(\\alpha),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath142+w_2(\\alpha).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the above computations , we introduced the quantities @xmath143 for simplification .",
    "the expression @xmath144 is evaluated below : @xmath145 .",
    "\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] next , we impose the compatibility condition @xmath146 after dividing the equation by @xmath63 and replacing the expressions of @xmath147 and @xmath148 , we obtain the condition stated in the theorem .        in case @xmath149 , @xmath153 and away from umbilic points ,",
    "the rotation angle @xmath70 is zero and the necessary and sufficient condition reduces to @xmath154_{xy}=0\\nonumber , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] or in its equivalent form @xmath155 for any arbitral smooth functions @xmath156 and @xmath157 .    finally , we are resuming the construction of the isothermic coordinates , based on the algorithm we presented starting from an initial coordinate chart @xmath117 , followed by a well - chosen rotation of angle @xmath80 and a re - scaling @xmath69 , all up to roto - translations and similarity transformations .",
    "how is the actual construction algorithm handled numerically ?",
    "in practice , we integrate along @xmath158 and @xmath159 and draw a virtual mesh to construct the surfaces : @xmath160 we start constructing the surface in a neighborhood of @xmath161 by solving a succession of pde s .",
    "first , we fix @xmath162 and move along @xmath159 , then we fix @xmath159 , and move along @xmath158 . because of the compatibility condition , reversing the order of integration would not change the value @xmath163 .    note that in we integrate along @xmath164 , while the integrands are given in terms of the initial parameters @xmath117 . in order to integrate ,",
    "we need first to solve and keep track of all the quantities @xmath165 and with these solve for @xmath163 in .",
    "thus , the problem is solved in two steps :    1 .",
    "first , constructing the mapping @xmath166 , @xmath167 and the vector fields @xmath75 , @xmath76 by solving numerically , with a fourth - order runge - kutta method , the systems - , and - , respectively .",
    "2 .   then , constructing the surface locally by solving numerically the system with a fourth - order runge - kutta method .",
    "the unduloid is an example of a cmc - delaunay surface which is generated by revolving a curve in arclength @xmath168 , namely @xmath169 in the @xmath170-plane , around the @xmath171-axis .",
