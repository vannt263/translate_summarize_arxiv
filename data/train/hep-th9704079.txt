    "moreover , considering the relations ( [ ba - def ] ) and ( [ ba - com ] ) at the points @xmath160 close to @xmath161 on @xmath84 one finds that the components of @xmath162 share the common set of poles and the positions of @xmath158 , @xmath41 , @xmath159 on @xmath84 do not depend neither on @xmath101 , nor on times @xmath163 .",
