    "the holographic principle conjectured by t hooft  @xcite and susskind  @xcite is one of the most important keys to understand and construct quantum theory of gravity .",
    "this proposal deeply concerns the fundamental principles of spacetime and quantum theory .",
    "the explicit example of holography was realized in string theory with d - branes by maldacena  @xcite and is called the ads / cft correspondence .",
    "the best understood example of the correspondence is supergravity ( typeiib string theory ) on @xmath0 is dual to 4d n=4 super yang - mills theory ( sym ) .",
    "a field on @xmath6 is identified with an operator in cft and the generating functional of correlators in cft is calculated from @xmath6 gravity  @xcite .",
    "many deformations of ads@xmath7/cft@xmath8 have been discussed by compactifying one or more spacetime directions , replacing @xmath6 by asymptotically @xmath6 geometries and so on , and the parameters describing modifications correspond to the temperature or coupling constants which may break some of supersymmetry in cft side ( see  @xcite and also @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the holographic principle has been also conjectured for other spacetime backgrounds which have not been yet realized or well understood in string theory .",
    "strominger discusses the ds / cft correspondence  @xcite , and a minkowski / cft correspondence is also proposed  @xcite .",
    "the holographic interpretation of the randall - sundrum model  @xcite was developed in  @xcite . hawking - maldacena - strominger  @xcite speculate the ads / cft interpretation of the randall - sundrum model with non fine - tuned branes , i.e. @xmath2 space bounded by @xmath1 branes , by deriving the same value of the entropy from @xmath6 gravity and from cft on a @xmath9 space .",
    "alishahiha et al .",
    "@xcite discuss a broader holography between @xmath4 or @xmath3 bulk gravity and cft on @xmath5 which is realized as a slice of bulk geometry , the ( a)ds / ds correspondence ( see also  @xcite for other attempts to realize curved spaces ) .",
    "however since the explicit string realization of these spacetime backgrounds has not been well understood , many of these arguments are limited to be qualitative .",
    "moreover in the last two examples , the holography is in some sense unexpected since the same @xmath6 geometry has different cft dual descriptions depending on how @xmath6 geometry is sliced , a minkowski slice or a de - sitter slice .",
    "a classical configuration of a bulk field in @xmath2 contains the information of correlation function of the corresponding operator in cft .",
    "let us discuss a static configuration along 4d minkowski space .",
    "the configuration is thus a function of normal direction to 4d minkowski space .",
    "there are two independent integration constants in the asymptotic solutions near the @xmath6 boundary .",
    "they correspond to the coupling constant and the vacuum expectation value of the corresponding cft operator .",
    "those are , of course , some numerical numbers .",
    "now let us apply the same logic to a static configuration along @xmath1 space in the ( a)ds / ds correspondence .",
    "( in this paper we only consider @xmath3 bulk and do not consider @xmath4 bulk geometry . )",
    "the static configuration is a function of normal direction to @xmath1 which is not a normal direction to 4d minkowski space , but a combination of that and time direction of 4d minkowski space . using the original ads / cft correspondence ,",
    "we obtain a time dependent coupling constant and a time dependent vacuum expectation value of the same cft operator ( section  5 ) .",
    "although we are studying the same theory , we are looking at a sector where 4d lorentz symmetry is complicatedly broken .",
    "so what is this sector ?",
    "the guide is the symmetry .",
    "since the static configuration is independent of @xmath1 coordinates , the coupling constant and vacuum expectation value are interpreted as those on @xmath1 .",
    "we will explain this idea in section  5 and speculate a conformal transformation relates the ( a)ds / ds correspondence ( @xmath3 bulk ) with the ads / cft correspondence .    without string realization",
    ", the above argument just tells a possibility that a different slice of @xmath6 gives a different result on the dual theory . in this paper",
    "we realize the setup of the ( a)ds / ds correspondence in string theory in a probe limit .",
    "the gravity dual of adding small number of dynamical quarks into n=4 sym has been proposed by karch and katz by introducing a d7-brane as a probe in the d3-brane background @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "we introduce a probe d7-brane in a different way such that the probe d7-brane fills @xmath1 inside @xmath2 and other directions except the @xmath10 inside the @xmath11 ( section  2 ) .",
    "the locus in the @xmath10 is described by a scalar field localized on d7-brane and is a function of the normal direction to @xmath1 surface in @xmath2 . in the cft side",
    "this corresponds to introducing fundamental quarks with supersymmetry breaking mass terms ( see section  5 ) .",
    "we find a stable supergravity configuration and this realizes the setup of the ( a)ds / ds correspondence , since the scalar field is a bulk field in @xmath2 and is a function of the direction normal to @xmath1 .",
    "then applying the ads / cft dictionary  @xcite and holographic renormalization  @xcite , we show the corresponding cft operator is the quark anti - quark composite operator as it is in  @xcite and study the flavor physics which are the chiral condensate ( section  2 ) , meson spectrum ( section  3 ) and quark anti - quark potential ( section  4 ) .",
    "we then discuss whether the flavor physics we obtain is consistently understood as that in cft with flavor on @xmath1 .",
    "the @xmath1 space has a temperature proportional to the inverse of curvature radius .",
    "we expect the finite temperature effects on flavor physics do not severely depend on the detail of large n gauge theory , and are qualitatively same as those in a large n gauge theory with flavor on minkowski space at finite temperature .",
    "in fact many works on flavor physics using the gravity dual of nonsupersymmetric large n gauge theories  @xcite have shown that the qualitative behaviour of flavor physics does not depend on the detail of large n gauge theory .",
    "it has been also known that the finite temperature effects on flavor physics are insensitive to the detail of large n gauge theory  @xcite .",
    "therefore we will thus identify the finite temperature effects on flavor physics in our calculations and see whether they are properly reproduced .",
    "we will show that they are indeed properly reproduced .",
    "thus we believe our results give an support on the holographic understanding of the randall - sundrum model with non fine - tuned @xmath1 brane(s ) and the ( a)ds / ds correspondence .",
    "the effective theory on the supersymmetric d3/d7 system is known to be n=2 sym with charged hypermultiplets which are incorporated from the d3-d7 open strings .",
    "karch and katz proposed the corresponding supergravity solution by treating d7-brane as a probe in @xmath0 geometry  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we instead embed a d7-brane probe in a way that supersymmetry is completely broken .",
    "the @xmath2 space realizes a @xmath1 space as a hypersurface in addition to 4d minkowski space and we embed a probe d7-brane along this @xmath1 space ( thus supersymmetry is completely broken ) and the normal direction to the @xmath1 hypersurface in @xmath2 as well as the @xmath12 inside @xmath11 .",
    "the position of d7-brane in the remaining @xmath10 directions inside @xmath11 is a function of the normal direction to @xmath1 . in the cft side",
    ", introducing d7-brane corresponds to adding fundamental quarks and all the results we will compute suggest that we add fundamental quarks on @xmath1 space .    the d3-brane background is described by @xmath0 ( appendix  [ a ] ) @xmath13 where 4d minkowski space ( 4d de - sitter space ) is apparent in the first ( second ) expression .",
    "@xmath14 is the metric of @xmath15 .",
    "we explicitly write the @xmath2 and @xmath1 curvature radius which are @xmath16 and @xmath17 respectively .",
    "@xmath18 is the distance from d3-brane , @xmath19 where @xmath20 are the rectangular coordinates . as approaching to the @xmath2 boundary , @xmath21 , these two expressions are same at the leading order and this",
    "is understood that the @xmath1 curvature effects are ignored in high energy limit in the gauge theory side .",
    "now we embed a @xmath1 space filling d7-brane as a probe in this geometry . for the computational convenience ,",
    "we change the coordinate @xmath22 into @xmath23 by @xmath24 and the @xmath0 metric becomes @xmath25 we further rewrite @xmath26 and then @xmath27 in this coordinate system , the world volume of @xmath1 space filling d7-brane is embedded with @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "because of the rotational symmetry , we place the brane at @xmath29 and the position along @xmath30 becomes a non trivial function of @xmath31 .",
    "since d7-brane breaks supersymmetry completely , this static configuration may have tachyonic directions gives only one condition for a second order differential equation for @xmath32 , we always have a static solution . ] and we should include the time dependence .",
    "however as long as the energy scale associated with the motion of d7-brane ( the scale of tachyon condensation ) is much smaller than the scales which we are interested in , such as @xmath33 , @xmath34 and the distance between d3 and d7 branes which will be understood as the mass for charged matter fields , we expect that the ads / cft correspondence is still applicable and the instability of d7-brane embedding should be interpreted as an instability in the field theory side .",
    "( actually we will show there are no dynamical tachyonic modes . )    the dirac - born - infield action of d7-brane with the tension @xmath35 and the equation of motion for @xmath32 are @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the determinant of metric and we hereafter use @xmath38 unit .",
    "the d7-brane configuration is given by a regular solution of the equation of motion up to @xmath39 or up to the horizon , otherwise the approximation of using supergravity breaks down and there is no interpretation of gauge theory dual since @xmath23 direction is related with the energy scale .",
    "when we separate one d3 brane from others along @xmath23 direction , the mass @xmath40 of gauge boson associated with symmetry breaking is calculated from the tension of string stretched between the probe d3 brane and the horizon  @xcite , @xmath41 where @xmath23 and @xmath42 are the position of probe d3 brane and horizon in ( [ revmet1 ] ) and @xmath43 is the string tension .",
    "therefore the proper distance from the horizon along @xmath23 direction is related with the energy scale in the dual field theory  @xcite .    in the ads",
    "/ cft correspondence the correlation functions of cft operators are computed from the on - shell supergravity action which is obtained from plugging a solution . the on - shell action is usually divergent and we should regularize and renormalize the action to have a well defined action .",
    "therefore we first study asymptotic solutions and divergences in the on - shell action .",
    "the asymptotic solutions at @xmath44 are @xmath45 though @xmath46 and @xmath47 are integration constants in this order , @xmath46 is determined in terms of @xmath47 to give a regular solution , i.e. @xmath32 and @xmath48 are everywhere finite . plugging the asymptotic solution into the dirac - born - infield action , we obtain @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the volume of @xmath12 and @xmath51 is the @xmath1 metric .",
    "we regularize the action by introducing the cutoff @xmath52 , which will be taken infinity after renormalization and @xmath53 is the finite part .",
    "we notice that when @xmath47 is smaller than roughly @xmath54 ( @xmath55 from numerical analysis , see some regular solutions in fig.[fig7 ] , a regular solution @xmath30 ends at the horizon , and it is easily checked that there is no divergent contributions to the on - shell action from the horizon . the coefficient in front of @xmath56",
    "is understood as the conformal anomaly of cft  @xcite and is same as that calculated in  @xcite . since the @xmath47 dependent term in the potential is unbounded below",
    ", the mode associated with changing @xmath47 is a tachyonic mode .",
    "however the change of potential energy is ( log ) divergent and thus this tachyonic mode is not a dynamical mode ( an infinite energy is needed to turn on this mode ) . after we introduce counter terms and renormalize the action , the finite on - shell action would depend on @xmath47 .",
    "however we can impose the dirichlet type boundary condition for @xmath57 as is done in ads / cft and fix @xmath47 , i.e. we can freeze the instability mode .",
    "we will later study there is no tachyonic mode in local excitations .",
    "thus we apply the ads / cft correspondence up to the low energy limit in the field theory side .",
    "although in this embedding introducing the cutoff at constant @xmath31 seems natural , this is the key .",
    "we do not introduce the cutoff at constant @xmath18 in the metric ( [ met1 ] ) . we just simply follow the ads / cft dictionary  @xcite and holographic renormalization  @xcite with replacing @xmath18 by @xmath31 , and compute correlation functions in the dual theory . then we will check whether the resultant correlation functions are consistently understood as those in cft with flavor on @xmath1 .",
    "since the symmetry of action is useful for determining the possible counter terms , we notice the invariance of metric under the following redefinition parametrized by an arbitrary real parameter @xmath58 @xmath59 therefore although we have two parameters @xmath17 and @xmath47 in the asymptotic solutions ( [ asym ] ) after taking @xmath38 unit , the real free parameter is only the combination @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the temperature of @xmath1 space .",
    "however we treat both @xmath17 and @xmath47 as parameters since it is convenient for discussing the behaviour under the change of @xmath17 and @xmath47 .",
    "following the holographic renormalization  @xcite , we introduce the counter terms which should respect unbroken symmetries and are defined at the cutoff @xmath62 . those are @xmath63 where @xmath64 is",
    "the induced metric at a constant @xmath62 surface in @xmath2 and @xmath30 appears in the combination @xmath65 since @xmath65 is the canonically normalized field in @xmath2 and invariant under ( [ cf ] ) , and so is @xmath66 .",
    "the form of @xmath67 is determined to cancel the divergences in @xmath68 and we obtain @xmath69\\right|_{\\rho=\\rho_\\infty , y = y(\\rho_\\infty ) } .",
    "\\label{abc}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with these coefficients , all the divergences are cancelled out , i.e. @xmath70 is finite .",
    "as is discussed in the literatures  @xcite , we have ambiguities in finite contributions @xmath71 which are numerical constants and do not depend on @xmath17 .",
    "a different choice of finite counter terms corresponds to a different regularization scheme in the field theory side and the correlation functions depend on a choice of scheme .",
    "thus we need to find a proper regularization scheme .",
    "we will show that the finite counter terms are completely fixed from the requirements that the correlation functions should recover those in supersymmetric theories after taking the limit @xmath72 and should also recover physically acceptable ones in the limit where @xmath1 curvature is negligible .",
    "since the metric ( [ met2 ] ) approaches to the metric ( [ met1 ] ) near the @xmath6 boundary , we identify the cft operator @xmath73 for @xmath30 field as the same operator in the supersymmetric case , i.e. the quark anti - quark composite operator @xmath74 where quark is a fermionic field in a hypermultiplet .",
    "according to the ads / cft dictionary  @xcite , @xmath75 is the mass for quark , i.e. @xmath76 , and the one point function @xmath77 , the chiral condensate , is calculated from the renormalized action , @xmath78 ,    \\label{finitect}\\\\   & & \\qquad    a=2(c_1 + 1)\\ln l_4+c_1 + 2c_4,\\hspace{3ex }    b=2c_1,\\hspace{3ex }    c=4c_2 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath64 is the induced metric at a constant @xmath62 as ( [ induced ] ) .",
    "the terms inside the first bracket come from the action @xmath68 and those inside the second bracket come from the counter terms @xmath79 .",
    "the log divergent terms cancel out and finite counter terms do contribute to the one point function . in the supersymmetric case ,",
    "i.e. @xmath80 , @xmath81 survive .",
    "since the regularity of solution is satisfied only for @xmath82 and the total on - shell value of action should be zero because of supersymmetry  @xcite , @xmath83 follows and there is no condensate . when @xmath17 is finite , @xmath46 in a regular solution is a complicated function of @xmath47 .",
    "we expect the chiral condensate @xmath84 goes to zero as quark mass gets large @xmath85 because the @xmath1 curvature effects should be negligible , and thus other coefficients @xmath86 and @xmath87 should be determined such that @xmath84 goes to zero as @xmath88 .",
    "if we can not realize @xmath89 in this limit , it indicates the ads / cft correspondence has to be modified or can not apply for this case .",
    "therefore this gives a nontrivial check of the ads / cft correspondence in our generalized cases .",
    "the ambiguities of finite counter terms exist in the case of other geometries as well .",
    "for example in the case of @xmath6 schwartzschild black hole studied in  @xcite , there is one free parameter labells the finite counter term which corresponds to @xmath90 in  ( [ finitect ] ) .",
    "this free parameter is fixed such that the chiral condensate goes to zero at the supersymmetric limit or a large quark mass @xmath91 ( @xmath61 is the black hole temperature ) limit and @xmath83 is obtained .",
    "thus the chiral condensate in  @xcite is just given by @xmath46 in our notation .",
    "we solve the equation of motion numerically and find regular solutions of @xmath30 by the shooting method .",
    "we set @xmath92 and give the initial conditions read from ( [ asym ] ) at @xmath93 and solve the equation of motion toward @xmath39 with changing @xmath46 and @xmath47 to find regular solutions . by using the rescaling ( [ cf ] ) ,",
    "a set of regular solution ( @xmath47,@xmath46 ) for @xmath92 gives another one for @xmath17 with ( @xmath94 , @xmath95 ) .",

    "@xmath46 is an increasing function of @xmath47 and it is nontrivial if finite counter terms can cancel the increasing behaviour of @xmath46 .",
    "the numerical data is best fit and @xmath100 . ] with @xmath101 which is shown in fig.[fig1 ] as a line , and then we obtain @xmath102 , @xmath103 and @xmath104 in our parameters ( [ abc ] ) .",
    "( the parameter @xmath105 would be fixed similarly from minimising the on - shell action . )",
    "although the line in fig.[fig1 ] fits the data very well , the line does not completely fit them and the small difference between the line and the dotted data becomes our prediction of chiral condensate which is shown in fig.[fig2 ] with the unit @xmath106 .",

    "( the small difference between the line and numerical data in fig.[fig1 ] gives this.),width=340 ]    since @xmath107 is a solution , there is no quark condensate in the chiral limit .",
    "the behaviour of chiral condensate is very similar to that in the large n gauge theory with flavor at finite temperature studied from @xmath2 schwartzschild black hole  @xcite .",
    "therefore we have properly picked up finite temperature effects in our d7-brane embedding .",
    "some comments are in order : 1 ) when a d7-brane ends at the horizon , it is nontrivial whether the horizon is stable under perturbations .",
    "however since this is the @xmath6 horizon , we expect the horizon is stable under perturbations .",
    "in fact we will study perturbations around the solution in the next section and show",
    "there are no tachyonic modes .",
    "2 ) we find multiple solutions in the region @xmath108 ( see fig.[fig8 ] ) as are found in  @xcite .",
    "this might imply a phase transition at @xmath109 as studied in qcd at the finite temperature  @xcite .",
    "3 ) although the final result in fig.[fig2 ] is very similar to that in  @xcite , the geometries in this paper and in  @xcite are different .",
    "we can see this from studying the ricci scalar induced on d7 brane for example .",
    "in both cases , the chiral condensate is zero for the case @xmath110 and the configuration of d7 brane is straight . in this case we can explicitly show that the value of ricci scalar is different with each other .",
    "we have not shown there are no tachyonic modes in local excitations around a regular solution . in the gauge theory side , the fluctuations about a d7-brane configulation correspond to meson fields  @xcite . in this section",
    "we thus aim to study the meson mass spectrum and see if there are tachyonic modes and if the meson spectrum captures finite temperature effects .",
    "we first discuss what are expected from the results in the previous section .",
    "since there is no chiral symmetry breaking in the chiral limit , it is consistent that we have a mass gap in the spectrum contrary to qcd at low temperature .",
    "the spectrum of heavy masses , much heavier than @xmath54 , should be approaching to the mass spectrum in supersymmetric case plus thermal corrections .",
    "with keeping these in mind , we now solve linearlized equations of motion .",
    "the small ( s - mode ) fluctuations along @xmath111 direction direction satisfy the same equations of motion . ]",
    "are included in the induced metric @xmath112 and the action up to the quadratic terms in terms of @xmath111 becomes @xmath113 where @xmath114 and @xmath32 is the regular solution obtained in the previous section .",
    "then it is easily seen that the energy carried by @xmath111 ( s - mode ) fluctuations is positive definite and we do not have tachyonic modes .",
    "notice that the counter terms @xmath79 do not play any rules in this discussion .",
    "since our main object in this section is the meson spectrum , we proceed to solve the equations of motion for @xmath111 .",
    "the linearized equation of motion for a kaluza - klein ( kk ) mode @xmath115 with the four dimensional mass @xmath116 becomes @xmath117 after normalizing properly , this kaluza - klein mode then satisfies @xmath118    the asymptotic solutions near the @xmath6 boundary are same as those for @xmath30 and so @xmath119 should be proportional to @xmath120 near the boundary .",
    "we give this boundary condition at @xmath93 and solve the equation numerically toward @xmath39 . since @xmath121 in the @xmath122 limit , the boundary action @xmath79 does not change the equation of motion and the boundary condition .",
    "this simply means that the mass of meson field is a physical quantity and does not depend on a regularization scheme .",
    "the regular solution is only allowed for discrete mass @xmath116 . for the supersymmetric case , the meson spectrum is calculated @xmath123 .",
    "we have numerically obtained how the masses of the lowest and the second kk modes ( @xmath124 ) change as @xmath47 changes for the case @xmath1 radius @xmath92 .",
    "we show our numerical results by dots in fig.[fig3 ] with @xmath92 . using the rescaling ,",

    "the negative sign of finite temperature effect in this region is consistent with the results of qcd at finite temperature  @xcite .",

    "this figure is an analog of fig.4.4 in  @xcite and as long as qualitatively they behave similarly .",
    "although the field theory in our case is different from qcd , this similarity supports that the dual field theory in our embedding of d7 brane is a field theory on @xmath1 space .",
    "the mass starts deviating from this asymptotic forms when @xmath47 becomes equals to or smaller than @xmath55 where a d7-brane ends at the horizon , and the kk modes degenerate below @xmath128 the degeneracy starts at @xmath129 , but there are numerical errors . ] in our numerical analysis .",
    "this again might signal the same phase transition in qcd at finite temperature studied in  @xcite .",
    "although in this region we have numerical errors @xmath130 in the lowest kk mass square , the mass square never crosses zero .",
    "this is supported from the fact that the @xmath6 horizon is stable .",
    "the flatness of the mass is understood as the large part of mass comes from thermodynamical fluctuations when the temperature @xmath131 becomes larger than the bare quark mass @xmath47 .",
    "this behaviour is clear in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] in which the mass increases linearly as the temperature increases in a high temperature region .",

    "it is known that there is a mass gap in supersymmetric case  @xcite and thus we expect a mass gap in our system at least when @xmath85 .",
    "it is nontrivial whether we have tachyonic modes in vector mesons when @xmath47 becomes smaller .",
    "we leave this question as a future work .",
    "in previous sections , we have studied the chiral condensate and meson spectrum and have obtained consistent results with those of a large n gauge theory with flavor at a finite temperature . in this section",
    "we study wilson loops and the static quark anti - quark potential . in the @xmath6 dual picture ,",
    "the wilson loop is described by a string lying along a geodesic in the @xmath6 bulk with the endpoints on the boundary or a d7-brane  @xcite , which in our situation is the @xmath1 hypersurface .",
    "the end points represent the positions of quark and anti - quark on a d7-brane .",
    "the nambu - goto action becomes @xmath132 where we have used the coordinate system in ( [ met2 ] ) and @xmath22 is a function of @xmath133 , i.e. @xmath134 . @xmath135 and @xmath136 are @xmath137 and @xmath138 components of 4d de - sitter metric .",
    "we assume the time scale @xmath61 is much smaller than @xmath17 and then we approximate @xmath135 and @xmath136 are constant ( @xmath139 ) .",

    "the open string which stretches in the @xmath6 bulk with endpoints at @xmath141 conserves the following quantity @xmath142 , @xmath143 and @xmath144 measures the distance between the horizon @xmath145 and the point @xmath146 until where a string extends from @xmath141 .",
    "thus when @xmath142 goes to zero , the quark and anti - quark are no longer connected by a string and move freely . the distance @xmath147 between two heavy quarks",

    "the quark mass is identified as @xmath163 since a string can extend up to @xmath164 not @xmath165  @xcite .",
    "the difference between @xmath166 and @xmath47 obtained from the ads / cft dictionary  @xcite could be understood as a renormalization group effect since the endpoints are located at @xmath39 on a d7-brane , not at @xmath167 and we should use @xmath47 at a short distance region , i.e. @xmath154 . the @xmath1 curvature correction @xmath168 reduces the binding energy which is consistently understood as the finite temperature effect .",
    "we find discrepancies from n=2 sym when @xmath142 goes to zero ( region ( 3 ) ) .",
    "the distance @xmath147 has the maximal length @xmath169 for @xmath1 case @xmath170 the binding energy goes to zero at @xmath169 ( faster than a coulomb type potential ) from the above ( fig.[fig6 ] ) and they become free particles when @xmath147 is larger than @xmath169 .",
    "a similar result was obtained from @xmath6 black holes at finite temperature  @xcite .",
    "we compute @xmath150 and @xmath147 in the @xmath171 limit ( region ( 1 ) ) and obtain @xmath172 this is the linear potential and the finite temperature effect appears as reducing the string tension as expected .",
    "( here we chose the bare mass @xmath47 as a quark mass , since @xmath171 is the high energy limit . )",
    "with the success of producing finite temperature effects from our d7-brane embedding , we would like to try answering why we have obtained such reasonable results . as briefly discussed in introduction ,",
    "the different slice of @xmath6 space give different results on the cft side .",
    "we study a bulk scalar field with mass @xmath116 .",
    "@xmath173 since the components of two metrics ( [ met1 ] ) and ( [ met2 ] ) are same at the leading order near the @xmath6 boundary , the asymptotic solutions of static configuration along @xmath1 is given @xmath174 where @xmath175 and @xmath176 are integration constants .",
    "here we only discuss the case @xmath177 otherwise the first correction to @xmath178 asymptotic solution is larger than @xmath179 .",
    "( but the essential arguments below are still same for general @xmath116 . ) in terms of 4d minkowski coordinate system , @xmath180 ( appendix  [ a ] ) , @xmath181 using the original ads / cft correspondence , the scaling dimension of corresponding cft operator @xmath182 is read from this solution and is @xmath183 .",
    "we introduce the cutoff at a constant @xmath184 and use the ads / cft dictionary . from straightforward calculations ,",
    "we obtain the time dependent source and vacuum expectation value , @xmath185 where @xmath186 is the cft action on 4d minkowski space , @xmath187 .",
    "( notice that the on - shell action from @xmath188 goes to zero compared to that from the cut @xmath184 as the cut approaches to the @xmath6 boundary . ) from the d3-brane effective theory s point of view on minkowski space , we are considering responses against time dependent sources .",
    "as discussed in section  2 , the scalar field on d7-brane corresponds to the quark anti - quark composite operator .",
    "therefore we were studying a time dependent mass term for quarks ( thus supersymmetry is broken ) and responses to that .",
    "on the other hand , the ( a)ds / ds correspondence claims that introducing the cutoff at constant @xmath189 and applying the ads / cft dictionary .",
    "we then obtain @xmath190 where @xmath191 is the cft action on @xmath1 , @xmath192 ( appendix  [ a ] ) , and the vacuum expectation value is calculated around @xmath1 background .",
    "the operator @xmath73 is same since the asymptotic solution is same .",
    "the cut near the @xmath6 boundary corresponds to the uv cutoff in the cft side .",
    "the above result indicates a different uv regularization induces two different results on correlation functions and the difference does not seem due to just a different scheme .",
    "let us try to give some explanation on this point .",
    "we again study the on - shell value of action .",
    "if we keep @xmath175 nonzero and compute the on - shell action , we obtain in each case @xmath193 ( here we ignored the possible contributions from @xmath194 . )",
    "the leading contribution is divergent and takes a different value except when @xmath195 .",
    "thus they are not related just by a finite renormalization .    because of a time dependent coupling",
    ", we have time dependent divergences ( [ s1 ] ) .",
    "thus we may mix time @xmath196 and the uv cutoff @xmath197 and define a new time @xmath198 , and similarly define a new uv cutoff @xmath199 such that the time dependence disappears .",
    "( this is nothing but a coordinate transformation from @xmath6 point of view ( [ ts ] ) . )",
    "taking the limit @xmath200 , the mixture becomes zero and the new time @xmath198 is still @xmath196 ( and so the metric unchanged ) .",
    "since @xmath1 is conformal to flat , we act the conformal transformation ( and scale transformation to fields ) and change the metric from minkowski to @xmath1 , @xmath201 since n=4 sym , @xmath202 ( @xmath203 represents the fields in the cft ) , is scale invariant , the resultant action @xmath191 becomes @xmath204 and the contraction of lorentz indices is given by @xmath1 metric .",
    "( we do not consider anomaly here . )",
    "the second part is the terms which always include the ( time ) derivative of @xmath205 for a scalar field @xmath206 and @xmath18 is the scalar curvature of the background 4d metric  @xcite .",
    "then the second part is written with a background gravity in a general covariant way . ] . since the scaling dimension of @xmath73 is @xmath183 , @xmath207 part in lagrangian",
    "is transformed into @xmath208 and the vacuum expectation value @xmath209 is also transformed into @xmath210 .",
    "although this argument is quite unsatisfactory , the coupling constant and vacuum expectation value in cft on minkowski is conformally transformed into those in cft on de - sitter space .",
    "the cutoff on minkowski space is also mapped into the cutoff on de - sitter space .",
    "we hope this is touching something behind the ( a)ds / ds correspondence and why we obtained reasonable results .",
    "we have studied a d7-brane probe in @xmath0 geometry .",
    "we identify the normal direction to a @xmath1 hypersurface in @xmath2 as the energy scale in the dual gauge theory and obtain a d7-brane configuration which is static along the @xmath1 directions .",
    "the scalar field on a d7-brane is a bulk field of @xmath2 foliated by @xmath1 and can be treated as a bulk field in the randall sundrum model with non fine - tuned brane(s ) or in the ( a)ds / ds correspondence studied by alishahiha et al .",
    "thus the field theory dual is expected to be a cft with flavor on @xmath1 .",
    "we have checked this expectation is true by identifying the finite temperature effects in the chiral condensate , meson mass spectrum and quark anti - quark potential and showing they are properly reproduced .",
    "therefore we realize the gravity dual of non supersymmetric field theory by breaking supersymmetry by a probe brane .",
    "the regularized on - shell action is log divergent in terms of m , which is the asymptotic locus of the d7-brane , and thus there is an infinite potential barrier between the @xmath9 embedding and supersymmetric embedding .",
    "this might indicate that different uv regularizations induce renormalization flows into different ir physics which are not connected by perturbative modes or finite renormalizations , but might be transformed with each other by a complicated ( conformal ) transformation .",
    "we showed there is no tachyonic mode in the perturbations of scalar fields localized on the d7-brane .",
    "we expect there is no tachyonic mode in the perturbations of gauge fields on the d7-brane as well , since there is a mass gap in the supersymmetric limit .",
    "when we include the back reaction of d7-brane , the gravitational solution is expected to be still similar .",
    "thus this realization of de - sitter space on the d7-brane might be phenomenologically interesting , since the possibility of the localized gravity in d3/d7 system is discussed in  @xcite .",
    "we have little knowledge on the quantum field theory on de - sitter space .",
    "because of numerical error , we did not pay much attention to the high temperature regions",
    ". it might be interesting to study them and phase transitions by improving the accuracy of numerical analysis",
    ". it might be also interesting to study two point or multi point functions in this direction .",
