    "the field of spatial pattern formation in nonlinear systems has grown significantly in the last decades ( see reviews kivshar1989,crosshohenberg1993,aranson2002,etrich , buryak2002,desyatnikov2005 , lectnotesphys2005,malomed2007,barcelona ) . in particular , that growth was significantly contributed to by the interest in self - localized states (  solitons \" ) and their stability in pattern - forming systems , both conservative and dissipative ones .",
    "the motivation of the present work is to achieve a quasi - analytical description of the formation of stable self - localized structures in spatially - extended lasers . to this end",
    ", we consider a complex ginzburg - landau model with the cubic nonlinearity ( cgl3 ) , for which an analytical chirped - sech localized solution is well known in the one - dimensional ( 1d ) setting @xcite .",
    "while this solution is always unstable , it has been shown that an additional , linearly coupled , dissipative linear equation can lead to its stabilization in coupled - waveguide models , keeping the solution in the exact analytical form @xcite .",
    "self - localized states in a wide variety of systems described by such coupled linear and nonlinear equations , in both 1d and 2d , was recently discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the physical system which offers a natural realization of such models is a broad - area vertical - cavity surface - emitting laser ( vcsel ) , coupled to an external frequency - selective feedback ( fsf ) .",
    "this system has been a topic of interest during the last years since it can display a variety of localized structures on top of a non - lasing background tanguy2006,tanguyprl , tanguy2008,radwell2009,radwell2010 . in this system ,",
    "the ( complex ) intra - vcsel field features nonlinear spatiotemporal dynamics due to two - way coupling between the optical field and the inversion of the electronic population ( driven by the injection current ) , while the feedback field obeys a linear equation which is linearly coupled to the main equation for the intra - vcsel field .",
    "previous studies have modeled the vcsel - fsf using various approximations and producing a rich variety of stable and unstable localized modes , including the fundamental soliton @xcite and its complex dynamics @xcite , as well as side - mode solitons supported by an external cavity @xcite , and vortex solitons @xcite .",
    "all the above - mentioned vcsel - fsf models have been numerically investigated including , at various levels of the approximation , physically relevant features , such as the feedback delay and electron - hole dynamics and diffusion . on the other hand ,",
    "the observed phenomena feature strong similarities persisting under progressive simplifications of the model , such as replacing the feedback grating with a lorentzian filter , the adiabatic elimination the electron - hole dynamics , and adopting instantaneous , rather than delayed , feedback @xcite .",
    "this observations suggest that a simpler underlying model may be introduced . in this vein",
    ", it was implied in ref .",
    "@xcite that a simplification towards a simple cubic approximation for the nonlinearity , could provide such a model of the cgl3 type .",
    "it was also noted that such a cubic approximation to the vcsel - fsf would place it in the same class of models as those previously introduced for coupled optical waveguides with active ( pumped ) and passive ( lossy ) cores in refs .",
    "@xcite , and for pulsed fiber lasers  in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in this work",
    "we demonstrate that such a cgl3 system does indeed allow stable and robust fundamental solitons in 1d , and , which is the basic novel finding , fundamental and multi - charge vortex solitons in 2d .",
    "we present the bifurcation diagram for the fundamental 1d solitons in our generalized cgl3 model , and establish their stability properties . going over into 2d ,",
    "we present numerically - generated bifurcation diagrams for the fundamental and vortex solitons , establish their stability ranges , and analyze a relation to the 1d solution . to our knowledge",
    ", the existence of stable 2d solitons and vortices supported by the cubic nonlinearity in the uniform space has not been previously reported in any physical context . as concerns the stabilization of 2d dissipative solitons by means of the feedback , provided by a linearly coupled dissipative equation , this approach was first proposed , in terms of anisotropic equations of the kuramoto - sivashinsky type ( its 2d modification ) , in ref .",
    "the model was suggested by applications to the flow of viscous fluid films , rather than optics .",
    "while our primary motivation is provided by the vcsel - fsf , similar soliton phenomena have been found in systems such as lasers with saturable gain and absorption vladimirov1997,rosanov2005,rosanovprl , rosanov2003,fedorov2003 and with a holding beam @xcite , as well as in vcsel experiments employing coupled cavities @xcite and a built - in saturable absorber @xcite , see also ref .",

    "the results reported in this work may have implications to both applied and fundamental studies . on the one hand ,",
    "the vcsel - soliton systems offer a strategy for the development of devices for all - optical information processing applications . on the other hand ,",
    "the results constitute a new contribution to the great variety of dynamical phenomena described by cgl systems in numerous physical contexts .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in section [ sec_model ]",
    "we present the model previously considered for lasers with the fsf and show how it can be reduced to a cgl3 equation coupled to a linear one . in section sec_zero_stability we consider the stability of the zero solution , which serves both as the background for self - localized modes and the source of pattern - forming instabilities .",
    "we then review the dynamics obtained from direct simulations of the cgl3 reduced model , which reproduces the spontaneous 2d - soliton formation , which was reported , in terms of the full model , in ref .",
    "@xcite , thus justifying the use of the reduction to the cubic nonlinearity . in section [ sec_1dsoliton ]",
    "we discuss the analytical 1d solution of our cgl3 model and produce a bifurcation diagram similar to those found in more complex models paulau2008,paulau2009,paulau2010 . in section [ sec_2dsoliton ] we report the most essential new findings for 2d solitons .",
    "first , we extend the 1d analytic solution into that for the 2d stripe - soliton family and describe this family , with an intention to identify the stripe soliton as a limiting case of vortices . then , using polar coordinates in the 2d plane , we find and characterize a family of vortex solitons , whose radius increases linearly with the topological charge . the stability of the vortex solitons is also analyzed in this section , both for the restricted class of cylindrically - symmetric perturbations and full azimuthal perturbations . while vortex solitons with high values of topological charges @xmath0 are always subject to the azimuthal instability ( in particular , for @xmath2 it goes over into the longitudinal instability of the stripe ) ,",

    "this approximation of the saturable nonlinearity by the cubic expansion is justified by the fact that the higher - order nonlinearity , which usually saturates the growth of the intensity in lasers without the feedback , is no longer the main saturation mechanism in the presence of external frequency - selective feedback . above the threshold ,",
    "the nonlinear term @xmath26 induces a frequency shift that , together with the frequency - dependent feedback , introduces an effective saturation capable of limiting the field amplitude even without nonlinear losses [ although @xmath21 is typically negative for lasers ] .    model ( [ modeleqsgeneralized ] ) is precisely the cgl3 equation coupled to a linear equation . for laser models ,",
    "there are usually specific relations between @xmath27 and @xmath28 ; however , in other physical situations all parameters of model ( [ modeleqsgeneralized ] ) may be independent , providing  for the opportunity to study different behaviors of the solutions .",

    "<S> we use the cubic complex ginzburg - landau equation coupled to a dissipative linear equation as a model of lasers with an external frequency - selective feedback . </S>",
    "<S> it is known that the feedback can stabilize the one - dimensional ( 1d ) self - localized mode . </S>",
    "<S> we aim to extend the analysis to 2d stripe - shaped and vortex solitons . </S>",
    "<S> the radius of the vortices increases linearly with their topological charge , @xmath0 , therefore the flat - stripe soliton may be interpreted as the vortex with @xmath1 , while vortex solitons can be realized as stripes bent into rings . </S>",
    "<S> the results for the vortex solitons are applicable to a broad class of physical systems . </S>",
    "<S> there is a qualitative agreement between our results and those recently reported for models with saturable nonlinearity . </S>"
