    "an essential part of present - day high - precision frequency measurements is related to experiments performed in the presence of some residual electric or magnetic field . to reduce the uncertainty caused by the field , one tries to perform the measurement on those sublevels which are under control , e.g. , for sublevels slightly affected by the perturbing field . here",
    ", we study another possible option to deal with a residual magnetic field .",
    "we show that despite the presence of a perturbing magnetic field shifting the energy levels , there are some special combinations of energies which do not depend on the magnetic field at all . in the case of microwave measurements that may be used , e.g. , to determine the hyperfine separation in the ground state .",
    "there are also some more specific combinations , and in particular ones where the dependence on the magnetic field is linear .    a constant homogenous magnetic field shifts different sublevels of hyperfine - structure ( _ hfs _ ) multiplets differently .",
    "however , as it is well known , a specific combination of energy of the sublevels of any @xmath0 state in the hydrogen atom at presence of the _ dc _ homogenous magnetic field @xmath1 remains field - independent . here : superscript `` @xmath2 '' stands for the energy perturbed by the magnetic field @xmath2 and `` @xmath3 '' is for the unperturbed levels .",
    "we use a simplified notation in which @xmath4 stands for @xmath5 _ etc_. the direction of the magnetic field is along the @xmath6 axis . here",
    "@xmath7 is the complete atomic angular moment @xmath8 .",
    "the electron angular moment @xmath9 in the case of the @xmath10-electron is @xmath11 , and the nuclear magnetic moment @xmath12 for hydrogen is also @xmath11 .",
    "the magnetic quantum number @xmath13 is a well - defined quantum number in presence of both the external magnetic field and the hyperfine interaction of the magnetic moment of the nucleus with the electron angular motion , while @xmath14 is not in the case when the zeeman shifts are comparable with the hyperfine separation .",
    "still we can mark a level with its value of @xmath14 at zero magnetic field .",
    "the other quantum numbers ( such as the principal quantum number @xmath15 and orbital moment @xmath16 in the case of hydrogen ) are not presented , but indeed it is assumed that all energies are related to the same _ hfs _ multiplet",
    ".    the property of the levels in the magnetic field presented in ( [ brabi ] ) has been numerously applied , e.g. , to study the hydrogen @xcite and muonium @xcite hyperfine structure .    here",
    "we discuss different field - independent combinations of the energy levels for arbitrary electron states ( arbitrary @xmath9 ) and nuclear magnetic moments ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "we assume for most of our study here that any effects due to the nuclear quadrupole electric moment can be neglected and consider the magnetic field as a weak one in a sense that the field affects the levels inside the _ hfs _ multiplets but does not mix different multiplets .",
    "we also consider in this paper another kind of specific linear combinations of energy levels , which depend on a value of the magnetic field , but their dependence is linear .",
    "a ratio of two linearly - dependent combinations is indeed field - independent .",
    "such linearly - dependent combinations can be used to determine magnetic moments of the electron shell and the nucleus .",
    "these values related to the nucleus and the electron(s ) in the atom are somewhat different from their free values , being affected by binding effects . comparing various linear combinations , one can determine a dimensionless ratio of these two magnetic moments .",
    "measuring various data in presence of a magnetic field , one can in principle determine a value of the field and thus to introduce corrections and arrive at unperturbed energy levels and eventually find magnetic moments .",
    "there are two main advantages of the sum rules derived in our paper .",
    "* they are derived here for an arbitrary two - spin system without use of any perturbation techniques and hence the zeeman shifts can be of any value compared with the hyperfine splitting . * because of the linearity of the sum rules the combinations can be easily calculated directly from experimental data and broadening of lines due to inhomogeneity of the field , which happens in actual experiments , could be cancelled in part .",
    "the cancellation of the dependence on the magnetic field in ( [ brra ] ) has been known as a specific result for the @xmath0-state which originates from the breit - rabi formula @xcite @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 is the _ hfs _ separation of the states with @xmath20 at zero magnetic field @xmath2 .",
    "the electron magnetic moment @xmath21 depends on the electron state , mainly on values of angular momentum @xmath9 and orbital momentum @xmath22 . a slight dependence on principle quantum number @xmath15 is to appear from perturbation theory due to relativistic and qed effects .",
    "the nuclear magnetic moment @xmath23 also contains a weak dependence on the atomic state via the small relativistic and qed contributions to @xmath24 .",
    "the breit - rabi formula is valid for a single electron atom in an @xmath10 state .",
    "our approach developed further is valid for an atom with any number of electrons . referring to ` electron ' magnetic moment or ` electron ' quantum numbers we will not distinguish between single - electron values and values for the electron shell .",
    "four energy sublevels of an @xmath0 state in the hydrogen atom as a function of the magnetic field are depicted in fig .",
    "[ zeeh ] . a similar behavior of six hyperfine sublevels of an @xmath0 in deuterium is plotted in fig .  [ zeed ] .",
    "let us briefly discuss our notation .",
    "the energy @xmath25 is not the energy of a state with a quantum numbers @xmath14 and @xmath13 because @xmath14 is not a well - defined quantum number in presence of the magnetic field .",
    "we consider the energy of a level as a function of the field strength @xmath26 and mark it with a value of @xmath14 at zero field when @xmath14 is well defined .",
    "we hope this notation is not confusing .",
    "sublevels in hydrogen ( not to scale ) .",
    "dependence of the energy of the @xmath27 triplet levels and the @xmath28 singlet level on the strength of the constant uniform field @xmath26 is plotted.[zeeh],scaledwidth=45.0% ]    one can conclude from ( [ breitrabi ] ) that there is a specific combination of few levels for an electronic @xmath0 state and any nuclear spin @xmath12 which is field - independent . to see that , first we note that @xmath29 and thus @xmath30 next , we find that @xmath31 and @xmath32 similarly , we obtain @xmath33     sublevels in deuterium ( not to scale ) .",

    "for practical application their symmetric combination can be more appropriate @xmath37 \\nonumber\\\\ & -&{1\\over 2}\\biggl\\ { \\bigl[e^{\\bf h}_{\\rm magn } \\bigl(i+ 1/2,\\,+(i- 1/2)\\bigr)+e^{\\bf h}_{\\rm magn } \\bigl(i+ 1/2,\\,-(i- 1/2)\\bigr)\\bigr ] \\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\bigl[e^{\\bf h}_{\\rm magn } \\bigl(i- 1/2,\\,+(i- 1/2)\\bigr)+e^{\\bf h}_{\\rm magn } \\bigl(i- 1/2,\\,-(i- 1/2)\\bigr)\\bigr ] \\biggr\\}\\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    recent progress in optical measurements offers an opportunity to determine _ hfs _ interval of excited states studying optical transitions , like , for example , two - photon excitation @xmath38 in hydrogen and deuterium ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "for such a measurement the observed lines are to be related to transitions which conserve @xmath14 and @xmath13 .",
    "if the measurement is performed with a residual field , the sum rules with vanishing field dependence may be helpful .",
    "it is advantageous for practical applications to express the results in terms of the absolute energy of the levels . on contrary",
    ", the energy in ( [ breitrabi ] ) is a relative energy defined in such a way that @xmath39 at zero magnetic field .",
    "the complete energy is @xmath40 where @xmath41 stands for quantum numbers which describe the energy levels neglecting hyperfine interaction and external magnetic field , i.e. @xmath42 in the case of hydrogen atom . indeed , there is still a possibility for an arbitrary additive constant , but that should be the same for any states .",
    "hopefully , equations ( [ four+ ] ) , ( [ four- ] ) and ( [ six ] ) are organized in such a way that it remains valid after a substitute @xmath43",
    "the field - independent results in ( [ four+ ] ) and ( [ six ] ) have been obtained from an explicit expression for the energy levels ( [ breitrabi ] ) @xcite .",
    "now we are to show that such a kind of expressions can be derived in a more general case for an arbitrary electronic state and any value of the nuclear spin .",
    "the only limitation is a complete neglection of the quadrupole contribution ( if it is present ) , and thus the separations between levels at zero magnetic field are determined by a single parameter , which is the nuclear magnetic moment .",
    "we consider an atom in a constant uniform magnetic field which induces the energy shifts much smaller than the fine structure , so we can study a reduced hamiltonian defined as an operator in a certain spin and angular - momentum space for a particular electron state @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the _ hfs _ constant which depends on the electron state .",
    "@xmath46 is an operator in the space of the spin and angular - momentum degrees of freedom .",
    "there are two natural basic sets to describe all such states .",
    "one , @xmath47 , is appropriate for low magnetic field , while the other , @xmath48 , is a proper one in the case when the zeeman effect dominates over the _ hfs _ separations .",
    "an important point is that @xmath13 is a good quantum number for both sets and @xmath49=0\\;.\\ ] ]    we demonstrate now , that even in the case of arbitrary values of the nuclear spin and the electron angular moment , a derivation similar to that for ( [ four+ ] ) is still possible . it may be constructed in a similar way with four ( six ) energy levels . to show that we remind ,",
    "that , since @xmath13 is a good quantum number , it is unnecessary to diagonalize the hamiltonian @xmath46 for all _ hfs _ states simultaneously .",
    "one can do that sector by sector , with each sector being related to a particular value of @xmath13 .",
    "there is no interference between sectors different values of @xmath13 .",
    "let us return to the previously discussed well - known result for an @xmath0 state ( see ( [ four+ ] ) and ( [ six ] ) ) . technically , it is has been successfully derived because of two basic properties of breit - rabi expression ( [ breitrabi ] ) for energy levels at magnetic field .",
    "* there is only a single state with @xmath50 and its energy has a linear dependence on magnetic field .",
    "the same is for the state with @xmath51 .",
    "the field - dependence of the energy is presented in ( [ maxf ] ) . since",
    ", no re - diagonalization has been involved the dependence remains linear .",
    "* there are two states for each other values of @xmath13 and in particular for @xmath52 . to diagonalize the related hamiltonian one needs to deal with @xmath53 matrices only .",
    "in a basis of @xmath54 states , the diagonal matrix elements are related to the hyperfine interaction , while the off - diagonal elements are results of interaction with the magnetic field .",
    "the same is true for the substates with @xmath55 .",
    "the result of re - diagonalization is given by ( [ sqrt_x ] ) .",
    "returning to an arbitrary state , we note that there is a certain similarity .",
    "the @xmath14 value varies between @xmath56 and @xmath57 with step @xmath58 .",
    "the maximal value of @xmath13 ( @xmath59 ) is possible only for @xmath60 .",
    "the same is correct for @xmath61 . since for these values there is a single hyperfine sublevel for each , the energy dependence is trivial ( cf .",
    "( [ maxf ] ) ) @xmath62 similarly to the states @xmath63 in the previous consideration , the field dependence is linear .",
    "there are two parameters introduced here : @xmath64 is the energy for the levels with maximal angular momentum @xmath65 at zero field , and @xmath66 .    the energy @xmath67 can be in principle defined in an arbitrary way and as matter of fact it actually cancels out in @xmath68 term in ( [ arbitrary1 ] ) , while any additive constant has sense only if we discuss a few levels , not a single one .",
    "we postpone any exact definition of @xmath67 until it will be necessary for further consideration .",
    "considering @xmath69 , we note that there are now two states with @xmath65 and @xmath70 , which are split at zero magnetic field .",
    "the same situation is indeed for @xmath71 that is similar to @xmath72 .",
    "the energy levels are ( cf .",
    "( [ sqrt_x ] ) ) @xmath73 here @xmath74 is the _ hfs _ splitting between levels with @xmath65 and @xmath70 ; @xmath75 and we still do not need to specify @xmath67 .",
    "in other words , it is not important for this part of consideration from what level we count the energy .",
    "we do not specify also constant @xmath76 in the equation above , which depends on @xmath12 and @xmath9 , since that is not necessary for our further evaluations .    limiting our consideration by these six states ( with @xmath77 and @xmath78 ,",
    "we easily derive expressions similar to ( [ four+ ] ) , ( [ four- ] ) and ( [ six ] ) .",
    "firstly , we note that @xmath79 secondly , we choose such a definition of the energy for a moment , that satisfies the condition @xmath80 which is a way to fix an additive constant in definition of energy .",
    "once we do so , the equations ( [ arbitrary1 ] ) and ( [ arbitrary2 ] ) take now the form ( cf .",

    "above we have defined the energy by ( [ defe0 ] ) ; however , we note that ( [ arbitrary6 ] ) ( cf .",
    "( [ six ] ) ) allows a redefinition of energy by introducing an additive constant .",
    "that reads that we are free to change definition of energy with an additive constant if necessary and this constant can depend on any quantum numbers not involved into hyperfine interaction .",
    "above we have taken advantage of similarity in certain expressions for simple previously known case and for a general situation . the similarity is related to sectors determined by a value of @xmath13 which have one or two substates only .",
    "that is the case of two maximal possible values of @xmath13 ( and the opposite values with negative @xmath13 ) .",
    "any other sector with a lower value of @xmath83 involves more than two states and any explicit expression for energy becomes more complicated .",
    "it is even unclear whether it is possible to obtain such expressions .",
    "below we develop an alternative approach to derive various field - independent values as linear combinations of energies in a constant uniform magnetic field .",
    "the approach does not need any explicit expressions for energy levels at magnetic field .",
    "first , we find a trace of the magnetic hamiltonian @xmath84 where the summation is performed over a complete basis set of sublevels , @xmath85 , of the _ hfs _ multiplet .",
    "there are two basis sets useful for calculations : one is related to states with a fixed values of @xmath86 and @xmath13 and the other is for the states with determined values of @xmath87 and @xmath88 . since the summation is over a complete set the result does not depend on the choice between these two sets .",
    "it is obviously that @xmath89    a more general trace of interest is @xmath90 still , the field - dependent part obviously vanishes because @xmath91 the remaining part is field - independent @xmath92\\bigr\\}\\,a\\;.\\ ] ] the _ hfs _ constant @xmath45 determines all energy separations inside the _ hfs _ multiplet and e.g. one can find @xmath93\\,a\\;.\\ ] ]    let us discuss values which can be measured directly .",
    "the complete hamiltonian is of the form @xmath94 where the first term depends on the electronic state and does not depend on magnetic parameters @xmath95 and @xmath96 , while the second term depends on them only , but not on detail of the atomic state .",
    "one can see that @xmath97 where @xmath98 is an average value over all the states @xmath99 after some transformations we arrive to a final field - independent sum rule @xmath100 where the sum is over all spin states .",
    "the equation for @xmath101 in the case of hydrogen reproduces ( [ brra ] ) and in the case of deuterium ( [ six ] ) .",
    "the relation ( [ finals2n ] ) , valid for an arbitrary value of @xmath15 , allows to obtain an infinite number of relationships .",
    "obviously , not all of them are independent .",
    "indeed , they are not independent in a sense that all are eventually expressed in terms of the hyperfine constant @xmath45 . ] of each other .",
    "let us discuss a number of independent identities .",
    "the equation , presented above , combines the values @xmath102 for not - negative @xmath13 .",
    "the number of independent identities , derived in such a way , can not exceed the number of different values of @xmath103 .",
    "the latter is equal to @xmath104 for integer @xmath105 and @xmath106 for semi - integer .",
    "we note that all identities allow free additive normalization of energy .",
    "it means that we , e.g. , should consider @xmath107 rather than @xmath108 , which reduces number of independent sum rules by unity .    comparing with consideration for @xmath0 states",
    ", we note that the field - independent combination is not necessarily a symmetrical sum of the contributions with @xmath13 and @xmath109 ( cf .",
    "( [ four+ ] ) and ( [ four- ] ) ) .",
    "meantime , we derived above only symmetric combinations .",
    "asymmetric field - independent combinations can not be found this way .",
    "nevertheless , we can study odd sum rules related to the properties of @xmath110 in contrast to the even sum rules ( [ s2n ] ) , the part related to the hyperfine interaction of the angular momentum and the nuclear magnetic moment vanishes @xmath111 and the rest depends on the magnetic field .",
    "the dependence is quite simple : @xmath112 it is linear in the magnetic field .    in such a way we have derived not more than @xmath105 values for integer @xmath105 and @xmath106 values of @xmath113 for semi - integer @xmath105 , which are linear in magnetic field .",
    "any ratio of them is indeed a field - independent quantity .",
    "that provides us with another set of values , which can not be affected by the magnetic field .",
    "so , we derived not more than @xmath114 and @xmath115 field - independent values independent from each other .",
    "we note that @xmath116 and thus @xmath117 where we changed the notation and @xmath118 stands for the energy of the levels which for the strong magnetic field is characterized by eigenvalues of @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "in our evaluation above we marked the levels with quantum numbers ( @xmath14 , @xmath13 ) or ( @xmath88 , @xmath87 ) , which both are not good at the presence at the same time of two effects such as the hyperfine interaction and interaction with the magnetic field .",
    "the indeces @xmath14 , @xmath88 and @xmath87 corresponded not to well - defined quantum numbers , but were just indexes related to some limits ( ` weak ' or ` strong ' magnetic field ) . in the case of any formal problem of derivation of our results for @xmath119 and @xmath113",
    "we note that all of them can be presented as a double sum , when the internal sum is a sum of all states , @xmath120 , with a fixed value of @xmath13 @xmath121 while the external sum is over @xmath13 which is a good quantum number .",
    "in such a way we need only somehow to identify levels and know their eigennumbers for @xmath13 .",
    "altogether we derived not more than @xmath122 field - independent values ( as @xmath119 or as ratio of two @xmath113 ) .",
    "the sum rules , derived here , ( for @xmath123 and @xmath124 ) are not covered by the breit - rabi formula .",
    "we also suggested an analog of the breit - rabi formula for six specific levels .",
    "the derivation above is valid for any spin hamiltonian when we can neglect interaction between different multiplets .    in conclusion ,",
    "let us discuss two problems related to possible corrections to the sum rules due to    * effects of the nuclear structure ; * quantum electrodynamics effects and atomic structure .",
    "we note that the nuclear electric quadrupole moment ( or higher order electric and magnetic moments ) affects the identities above but still the field - dependent combinations exist .",
    "since @xmath13 is a good quantum number , the sums @xmath119 are field - independent and calculating all of them one can find contribution of all moments separately .",
    "for instance , the nuclear quadrupole moment contributes to hyperfine structure if @xmath123 and @xmath124 .",
    "the magnetic hamiltonian becomes of the form @xmath125 where the constant @xmath126 is directly related to the quadrupole contribution to the hyperfine structure .",
    "in such a case , the sums @xmath119 remains field - independent , but they are expressed linearly in terms of @xmath45 and @xmath126 ( cf .",
    "( [ sum2na ] ) ) .",
    "it is enough to find two field - independent values , e.g. , @xmath101 and @xmath127 , to determine two contributions to the hyperfine structure separately : one caused by the dipole magnetic moment and the other caused by the electric quadrupole moment , i.e. , by @xmath45 and @xmath126 .",
    "we do not present any explicit relationships but it is clear that they can be presented if it would be really necessary for any particular applications .",
    "the sum rules offer an accurate method to compare the magnetic dipole moment and electric quadrupole moment in the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "it can be also used to compare magnetic moments of the nucleus and an electron by studying a ratio of linear combinations .",
    "if one measures magnetic field , the linear combinations can be helpful as well ( cf . , e.g. , with a high - precision determination of the muonium magnetic moment in ref  @xcite ) .",
    "there is only a source of corrections to the derived sum rules due to other levels .",
    "if the magnetic shift of levels of fine and gross structure is much smaller than the distance between those levels , we can separate the levels in theoretical consideration to study their magnetic structure .",
    "if the shift is big , a number of levels are mixed ( cf . the paschen - back effect ) and",
    "our evaluation is incorrect .",
    "it also leads to a hamiltonian non - linear in the magnetic field .",
    "indeed , in a low field such effects produce certain corrections to the hamiltonian ( [ hmagn ] ) .",
    "additionally , these effects produce a shift of the center of gravity of magnetic multiplet .",
    "however , as long as these effects are small they can be taken into account perturbatively as effects in the second order in the magnetic field .",
    "all other effects , such as effects of quantum electrodynamics , can only affect the values of the electron and nuclear magnetic moments which become slightly different from the free values and thus introduce some corrections to the energy levels in the magnetic field .",
    "however , the structure of the hamiltonian ( [ hmagn ] ) is the same and sum rules for the field - independent contributions are not affected .",
