    "x1908 + 075 is an optically unidentified , highly absorbed , and relatively faint x - ray source that appeared in surveys carried out with instruments on the _ uhuru _ , _ oso 7 _ , _ ariel 5 _ , _ heao-1 _ , and _ exosat _ satellites .",
    "the early detections and position determinations are summarized by ( * ? ? ? * hereafter wrb ) .",
    "they conclude that the position of x1908 + 075 is likely to be within the overlapping region of the error box of a source detected in an _",
    "ipc image and one of an array of _ heao 1 _ a-3 position `` diamonds '' , and is thus known with an accuracy of @xmath9 .",
    "inspection of the poss plates within the source error box reveals no optical counterpart down to magnitude 20 .",
    "this is consistent with the heavy optical extinction implied by the interstellar hydrogen column density of @xmath10 atoms @xmath11 measured on the basis of the low - energy absorption in the x - ray spectrum ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the intensity of x1908 + 075 has been monitored for the past eight years using the all - sky monitor ( asm ) aboard the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( _ rxte _ ) , and has typically been in the range 2 - 12 mcrab in the 2 - 12 kev energy band .",
    "wrb analyzed data from the first three years of operation of the asm , and thereby discovered a 4.4 day periodicity in the x - ray intensity .",
    "the periodic component of the intensity variations is clearly energy dependent in both strength and detailed form . at most orbital phases ,",
    "the variation is roughly sinusoidal while a relatively sharp dip forms the minimum in the 5 - 12 kev band .",
    "these characteristics suggest that the modulation is produced by a varying amount of absorption along the line of sight as the source moves through the stellar wind of a massive companion star .",
    "the hard x - ray spectrum led wrb to also suggest that this source could be an x - ray pulsar .",
    "the possibility that x1908 + 075 might be an x - ray pulsar led us to carry out a set of pointed observations with the pca and hexte instruments on _ rxte _ in late 2000 and early 2001 .",
    "the data revealed the presence of strong x - ray pulsations at a period of 605 seconds .",
    "we were also able to detect doppler delays in the pulse arrival times .",
    "however , because the number of independent high - quality pulse arrival times obtained from this data set was small , it proved difficult to unambiguously disentangle orbital effects from intrinsic changes in the pulse period .",
    "the latter could , in principle , be quite large for a neutron star rotating with a period as long as 600  s ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , we obtained additional observations of the source with _ rxte _ during late 2002 and early 2003 .",
    "in this paper we report the results of our analysis of the _ rxte _ observations of x1908 + 075 .",
    "the pointed observations are described in  2 .",
    "a pulse timing analysis is described in  3 .",
    "we present an accurate pulse period and a determination of the spin - down of the neutron star due to accretion and magnetic torques .",
    "the orbital doppler delay curve is measured , thereby confirming the 4.4-day period found in the asm x - ray light curve .",
    "the resultant mass function is @xmath12 , indicating that the pulsar does indeed orbit a massive companion star .",
    "the results of an orbital - phase - dependent spectral analysis are presented in  4 .",
    "we detect a very pronounced modulation of the low energy attenuation as a function of orbital phase . in  5 we model this modulation by absorption in a spherically symmetric stellar wind ,",
    "whereby we obtain constraints on the orbital inclination , on the properties of the companion star , and on the stellar wind .",
    "we discuss the implications of our results in  6 , including the possibility that this system may be the progenitor of a neutron star  black hole binary .",
    "pointed observations of x1908 + 075 were made with the proportional counter array ( pca ) and high - energy x - ray timing experiment ( hexte ) on _ rxte_. the pca consists of 5 proportional counter units ( pcus ) that are sensitive to x - ray photons in the range 2.560  kev .",
    "each pcu has a collecting area of @xmath13 and a collimator to limit the field of view to @xmath14 in radius @xcite .",
    "some of the pcus are operated with reduced duty cycle in order to avoid problems associated with constant use . only pcus 0 and 2 were used in every observation .",
    "data from the pca observations were telemetered to the ground in the `` goodxenon '' mode , which includes information on each good event with 1 @xmath15s time resolution and the instrument s full energy resolution ( 255 channels ) .",
    "the hexte comprises two clusters , each of which includes 4 nai scintillation detectors sensitive to photons in the range 15250  kev that provide a total collecting area of @xmath16 per cluster .",
    "the detectors in each cluster view a common @xmath14 radius field @xcite .    between 2000",
    "november 19 and 2001 february 22 , we obtained 15 short observations with a typical exposure time in each of @xmath17 s. a total exposure of 35 ks was obtained in these observations , which we refer to collectively as `` epoch 1 '' . over all of the 15 observations",
    "there were , on average , 3.0 pcus in operation .",
    "eight of the observations were made during one orbital cycle of x1908 + 075 ( @xmath18 days ) , while the remaining 7 were performed nearly 3 months later .",
    "fourier transforms of these data clearly exhibited the presence of x - ray pulsations with a period of 605 s.    additional observations with the pca and hexte were carried out on 39 occasions from 2002 december 23 through 2003 january 5 and on 32 occasions from 2003 january 30 through 2003 february 8 ( `` epoch 2 '' ; 196 ks total exposure ) . on average ,",
    "3.5 pcus were in operation .",
    "each of these 71 observations in epoch 2 typically yielded @xmath19 s of net exposure most often in the form of two contiguous time intervals separated by a @xmath17 s gap due to earth occultation of the target .",
    "raw counting rate data from two of these 71 pointed observations are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cnts ] to illustrate the typical appearance of the x - ray pulsations and accompanying source variability .",
    "the x - ray intensity , in addition to exhibiting obvious pulsations , is also quite variable on timescales comparable to the pulse period and longer .    for pulsar timing purposes we used events with energies in the range 3.717 kev ( channels 340 ) from both left and right sections of layer 1 of all operating pcus .",
    "event times were reduced to the solar system barycenter .",
    "the average 3.717 kev background count rate in individual observations done in 2003 - 2003 ranges from 7.3 to 7.8 cts s@xmath5 pcu@xmath5 .",
    "background was not subtracted in our timing analyses .    to determine an appropriate model for spectral analyses , we used data from both the pca and hexte . in the pca analyses we utilize 2.925 kev pulse height range data from all layers of pcu 2 only because that pcu was operational for all of the observations and because its calibration is superior , as judged by the analysis of contemporaneous pca observations of the crab nebula .",
    "spectral extractions and background subtractions for both the pca and hexte were performed using the `` ftools '' package , and spectral models were applied using `` xspec '' .",
    "both of these software packages were provided by nasa / heasarc .",
    "a first estimate of the mean pulse period was obtained by binning the data from all of the epoch 2 ( 2002 - 2003 ) observations in 16-s bins and carrying out an fft analysis of the resultant data train ( @xmath20 points ) .",
    "the fft revealed a highly significant signal at a period of 604.76 s , as well as 5 very prominent higher harmonics of the fundamental .",
    "also evident in the fourier transform were a number of sidebands of the pulsations that were spaced in frequency by multiples of 1/4.4 days@xmath5 .",
    "these sidebands were identified as due to the orbital motion of the neutron star about its companion . from the fundamental and the prominent harmonics and sidebands , we derived an average pulse period during these observations of 604.689 s.    we proceeded to fold the data from each of the 71 pointed observations from 2002 - 2003 modulo this value of the average pulse period . to form a `` pulse template '' ,",
    "the individual pulse profiles were manually aligned to correct for small phase drifts and then averaged ( see fig . [",
    "fig : pulse ] ) .",
    "we then computed the cross correlation function ( ccf ) between the template and the folded profile from each of the individual observations .",
    "the phase difference for which the ccf reaches a maximum value is the best estimate of the pulsar phase relative to the folding ephemeris .",
    "pulse arrival time delays are then simply obtained as the products of the phase differences and the folding period .",
    "pulse arrival times were then computed by adding each time delay to the time of phase zero of a pulse near the middle of the observation interval .",
    "this analysis yielded a total of 69 pulse arrival times after we eliminated the results from 2 of the 71 observations for which the ccfs were possibly ambiguous .",
    "the pulse arrival time delays are listed in table [ tab : pulse ] and plotted in figure [ fig : delay ] .",
    "the doppler delays due to the orbital motion are quite apparent in figure [ fig : delay ] , as is an overall quadratic behavior due to the slowdown in the rotation rate of the neutron star .",
    "we fit the pulse arrival times with a 7-parameter model of the orbit and pulse period behavior .",
    "the arrival time of the @xmath21th pulse is given by @xmath22   \\nonumber \\\\   & & - \\frac{e}{2c } a_x \\sin i \\sin[2\\omega ( t_n-\\tau_{90})-\\omega_p]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 is the pulse period at time @xmath24 , @xmath25 is the pulse period derivative , @xmath26 is the projected semimajor axis of the orbit of the neutron star , @xmath27 is a reference time , which for a circular orbit corresponds to superior conjunction , @xmath28 is the orbital frequency which we fix at a value of @xmath29 radians day@xmath5 , and @xmath30 is the longitude of periastron .",
    "the last term represents the first order term in a taylor series expansion in the eccentricity @xmath31 and is a reasonable approximation for a mildly eccentric orbit .",
    "the curve representing the best - fit orbit and pulse period behavior is shown superposed on the arrival time delays in fig .",
    "[ fig : delay ] .",
    "the rms scatter of the arrival time delays about this best fit curve was found to be @xmath32 s and was used as an empirical estimate of the uncertainty in the individual arrival times .",
    "this was the basis on which we derived formal confidence limits on the individual fitted parameters .",

    "first , the observed spectrum could be formed by both x - rays that propagate directly to the detectors along paths that pass close to the companion star and therefore are heavily attenuated , as well as x - rays that are scattered farther out in the stellar wind and are not attenuated so heavily by photoelectric absorption .",
    "second , if the stellar wind is partially ionized , then the energy dependence of any absorption will not be as strong as that for strictly neutral gas .",

    "of course , the winds of wr stars , which have little or no hydrogen , would have significantly larger x - ray absorption cross sections per unit mass than winds from unevolved stars .",
    "if there is little hydrogen in the wind , we may have _ overestimated _ the wind mass loss rate , but such a composition would nonetheless clearly indicate the wr nature of the companion .",
    "if the companion star is indeed a wr star , then the x1908 + 075 system has potentially important implications , in general , for binary stellar evolution , and for the formation , in particular , of neutron star ",
    "black hole ( ns - bh ) systems .",
    "if it is a wr star , then it is likely the he or co remnant core of a star that was originally much more massive , possibly of mass @xmath287 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in this case we expect the companion to undergo core collapse in @xmath7 to @xmath8 years and leave behind a stellar - mass black hole @xcite .",
    "thus , there is a possibility that the x1908 + 075 system is the progenitor of a neutron star ",
    "black hole binary where the neutron star formed first",
    ". this would be significant in at least two ways .",
    "first , in spite of the fact that six ns - ns binaries have been discovered ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , no ns - bh binaries have yet been found .",
    "there are theoretical arguments @xcite which suggest that the latter binaries should be at least a factor of 10 less populous than their ns - ns cousins ( but see * ? ? ?",
    "an identified progenitor would help theorists better estimate the current population of ns - bh binaries .",
    "second , if ns - bh binaries are formed , the issue of which collapsed star forms first is also important to our understanding of binary stellar evolution .",
    "the most direct way of producing these systems is for the bh to form first ( from the more massive component of the system ; see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but there are also channels where the ns forms first , as discussed above ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "since this paper was originally written , @xcite have reported the results of near - infrared observations of stars in or close to the error box of x1908 + 075 , and have found a star whose jhk magnitudes and colors , and h and k band spectra , suggest an o or b supergiant at @xmath288 kpc .",
    "they believe that this star is likely to be the counterpart of x1908 + 075 .",
    "if confirmed , this identification would rule against a wr companion star .",
    "we expect to obtain observations of x1908 + 075 with the chandra x - ray observatory , and to thereby obtain an x - ray position sufficiently accurate to secure the optical identification .",

    "<S> such a high rate is inconsistent with the allowed masses and radii that we find for a main sequence or modestly evolved star unless the mass loss rate is enhanced in the binary system relative to that of an isolated star . </S>",
