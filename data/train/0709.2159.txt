    "the study of phase transitions via monte carlo simulations has recently regained new interest due to the introduction of the so called `` extended ensemble methods '' , like multicanonical simulations  @xcite , broad histogram thecniques  @xcite , entropic sampling  @xcite , wang - landau method  @xcite , among others .",
    "these new thechniques increased significantly the accuracy of the monte carlo studies in the cases where large free energy barriers separate different wells in the free energy landscape .",
    "this step forward in the developement of the monte carlo method is analog to the already largely used clustering methods  @xcite  @xcite , which help to overcome the critical slowing down observed at second order transitions .    following the arrival of these new methods an avalanche of thechniques were developped to further improve accuracy and performance of the different algorithms .",
    "each one of these has been validated through the application to well known systems , typically those that can be solved exactly like the 2d ising model or those whose numerical or aproximated analytical results are out of discussion like the potts model for @xmath0 ( to test the case of first order transitions ) .",
    "recently , malakis , peratzakis and fytas @xcite introduced an interesting approximation method to allow for an easy extension of a wang - landau ( wl )  @xcite study to large systems .",
    "it is based on the fact that in the thermal averages sums at a given temperature t , only some terms give a relevant contribution : those whose energies correspond to the interval around the maximum of the probability distribution of the energy at the corresponding temperature , @xmath1 . hence an algorithmic procedure to determine a restricted interval @xmath2 centered in the energy @xmath3 of the maximum of @xmath1 , called minimum energy subspace ( mes ) is proposed . in this way",
    "the wl sampling needs to be performed only in this restricted energy interval , improving the efficiency of the algorithm and diminishing the errors introduced when joining together the different parts of the density of states in a multirange simulation  @xcite .    this algorithm is based on the equivalence of thermodynamical ensembles and on the central limit theorem : the energy probability distribution at a given temperature t approaches a gaussian .",
    "moreover , for a continuous transition , it is supposed that this remains the case _ even at _",
    "@xmath4 , the critical temperature of a sample whose linear size is @xmath5 .",
    "then one expects that the width of the critical mes ( crmes ) will be of the same order that the standard deviation of the energy:@xmath6    where volume of the system is given by @xmath7 , with @xmath8 the space dimension , @xmath9 is the temperature and @xmath10 the specific heat .",
    "the crmes is iteratively built , starting from the central value @xmath11 and extending the interval on both sides of it , until the difference between the specific heat calculated using the whole energy interval ( or the exact one , if known ) and the one calculated using the restricted iterated interval becomes less than a given error .",
    "assuming that one imposes the same level of error for all the sizes , a lattice size dependence remains : the center of the crmes @xmath11 and its boundaries are functions of @xmath5 . at the critical temperature , using the scaling law for the specific heat one gets :    @xmath12    in this way , performing a wl simulation over the whole energy range for small lattices and determining the crmes for this small size will be enough to extrapolate the crmes where the wl simulation has to be carried out for larger lattices .",
    "this method has been succesfully applied to the study of the pure 2d and 3d ising model .    in this work",
    "we are interested in the application of this technique to highly disorder systems , as has been proposed in  @xcite for the 3d random field ising model ( 3d - rfim ) with bimodal distribution of the random fields .",
    "the aim of this work is to show , by the study of the 3d - rfim , why the generalization of the crmes method to highly disordered systems is not straightforward .",
    "the article is organised as follows in sec .",
    "ii we describe the method used in this work , in section iii we present our results and in sec.iv we discuss how these results point out to the aspects of the proposed method that have to be handled with extreme care when applying it to the study of highly disordered systems .",
    "the 3d - rfim is one of the simplest disordered systems;its hamiltonian is given by : @xmath13    where @xmath14 are the local fields of intensity @xmath15 which we assume to be distributed as follows :    @xmath16   \\label{prob}\\ ] ]    the nature of the transition of this model is a subject of controversy since long ago . in  @xcite",
    "we have studied it using the multi - range version of the wl simulation on the whole relevant energy range .",
    "our results for high values of the random field intensity show strong first order properties .",
    "the same result had also been found in  @xcite using a completly different calculation method , namely the canonical histogram monte carlo and similar features have also been found in the case of a gaussian distribution of random fields  @xcite    to analyse the method proposed in @xcite we start from the density of states ( dos ) calculated using a multi - range wl simulation on the whole energy space  @xcite and we recalculate thermal averages limiting our dos data only to the energy subintervals corresponding to those indicated in  @xcite .    with this procedure we are able to point out to the different aspects that should be handled with special care in order to apply this technique to highly disordered systems .",
    "the fact that the nature of the transition of the 3d rfim is still a matter of controversy calls for a special attention on the validity of the hypotesis of the methods used to study this model .",
    "let s discuss first the relationship between the nature of the transition and the crmes technique .",
    "the method introduced in  @xcite is based on the assumption that one deals with a second order transition .",
    "this is required for equation  [ scaling ] and the gaussian - like shape of the @xmath17 hypothesis to be valid .    our wl simulation on the whole energy range shows , in agreement with other works  @xcite  @xcite , that for strong disorder , and big enough lattices , the @xmath18 curves may present a multiplicity of peaks .",
    "in order to estimate the transition temperature @xmath19 , we observe that one of the maxima of @xmath18 , located at @xmath19 , is associated to a @xmath20 curve which shows two well separated peaks of equal height . in general , this corresponds to the highest maximum of @xmath18 .",
    "the double peaked @xmath21 curves are an indication of the first order character of the transition , at the transition temperature @xmath22 . in very rare cases",
    "it has been found that the double peak is a finite size effect @xcite .",
    "recently it has been reported that this could be the case for the 3d - rfim @xcite , though further calculations involving sizes beyond @xmath23 are needed .    in any case the energy probability distribution at the transition temperature @xmath22 for a given finite l , can not be approached by a single gaussian .",
    "in fact its central value @xmath11 corresponds then to the _ * minimum * _ of @xmath21 .",
    "moreover , in the case of first order transitions eqs .",
    "[ cmes ] and  [ scaling ] are not valid , and the probability distribution may be approached by a double gaussian  binder .",
    "a modified version of the crmes method adapted to a system undergoing a first order transition has been proposed  in @xcite .",
    "it is worthwhile noticing that this work deals with a system presenting geometrically frustrated interactions but no quenched disorder .",
    "it is clear that when studying systems where the free energy landscape has a complex structure due to the existence of a quenched disorder , the possibility of a crossover to a first order transition must be kept in mind .",
    "moreover finite size effects and sample to sample fluctuations are sensitive points studying highly disordered systems .",
    "as it is often the case , the signatures of a first order transition are observed only for large enough sizes . for",
    "smaller sizes the transition looks continuous , as the correlation lenght may easily reach the size of the system .",
    ", @xmath24 ( a ) specific heat vs. temperature , ( b ) probability density for t=3 , corresponding to the maximum of ( a).,width=377 ]    figure  [ l10 ] illustrates this situation for a field @xmath24 . in ( a ) one",
    "can see the specific heat curve for a sample of linear size@xmath25 and in ( b ) the corresponding @xmath1 .",
    "there is only one peak in @xmath26 at @xmath22 and the corresponding probability distribution shows a single gaussian - like  peak .",
    "the appealing idea of the crmes technique should be considered step by step in this case . in",
    "@xcite it is proposed to carry wl simulations in the whole energy range on lattices of ( preferably small ) size @xmath5 to determine the crmes at this size . then a new crmes corresponding to a lattice of size @xmath27 is calculated via eq .  [ scaling ] in order to perform the wl simulation at this bigger size @xmath28 only in a restricted energy interval .",
    "figure  [ shl16l24 ] shows that when the size increases new peaks which are absent for smaller sizes , may appear in the specific heat curve .",
    "moreover the location of these peaks is strongly sample dependent . in figure",
    "shl16l24 the specific heat curves of two different realisations at the same field are shown for @xmath29 ( a ) and @xmath30 ( b ) .",
    "specific heat vs. temperature , comparison of two different realizations of quenched disorder for two sizes ( a)@xmath29 , ( b ) l=24 , width=377 ]    figure  [ probasl ] shows the energy probability distribution corresponding to the maxima of @xmath26 depicted in figures  [ l10 ] and  [ shl16l24 ] .",
    "it can be seen that for @xmath24 , for @xmath31 , the probability distribution of the energy is double peaked .",
    "this is a signature of a first order transition , which is absent for smaller sizes .",
    "so the procedure proposed in  @xcite would be misleading if the starting sizes are smaller than @xmath29 . for the 3d rfim @xmath29",
    "is big enough so as to render the use of multirange wl scheme necessary . very recently",
    "a variation on the wl method has been proposed that migth improve this point @xcite .    .",
    "double peaks appear in the probability distribution as @xmath32 suggesting a first order transition .",
    "probability distributions of different sizes have very small overlap .",
    "it shows the size of the shift from @xmath33 to @xmath34 .",
    "( b ) probability distribution of the energy for @xmath30 and two different samples .",
    "one can get an estimate of the extended relevant energy interval for this size.,width=377 ]    finite size effects are well known and should be generally taken into account in order to obtain results for infinite systems .",
    "the additional point when considering finite size effects in disordered systems is that changing the size implies a change of quenched disorder , which is obviously not the case in systems without disorder .",
    "this becomes particularily troublesome when large sample to sample fluctuations are observed .    the observed large sample to sample fluctuations are in agreement with other works on disordered systems  @xcite  @xcite  parisi - sourlas  -  @xcite .",
    "as the multiplicity of peaks of the specific heat and their locations are strongly sample dependent ( see figure  [ shl16l24 ] ) , the location of the maxima of @xmath21 , and the resulting crmes depend also on the considered sample .    to take this aspect into account in  @xcite a broadened crmes  for wl simulation is proposed .",
    "this broadened crmes is determined by the union of m crmes each of them calculated for a different quenched random field configuration .",
    "then , using equation  [ scaling ] , the crmes is estimated for a larger size .",
    "it is assumed that for the new @xmath35 , it will be enough to run the wl algorithm only in this new restricted energy interval .",
    "letting aside the fact that equations  [ cmes ] and  [ scaling ] are not valid if the transition is first order , and that in general the critical exponents are not always known in the case of a second order transition , we will now discuss in detail the idea of extending to a larger size @xmath36 the crmes calculated for @xmath5  @xcite .    as pointed out above , in the case of disordered systems the sample of size",
    "@xmath37 is a _ * new , different sample * _ , the corresponding @xmath21 may have its maxima located out of the crmes that has been extrapolated via eq .",
    "[ scaling ] . in figure",
    "probasl(a ) one can see that there is little overlap between the probability distributions , even for samples of slightly different sizes .",
    "in addition figure  [ probasl](b ) shows that this is also true for the probability distributions of two different samples of _ the same size_.    we used the dos obtained in  @xcite for the whole energy range , to recalculate thermal properties restricting the dos to the intervals given in ref  @xcite .",
    "let s consider first the case where a broadened interval is used",
    ". for @xmath30 the broadened interval of  @xcite corresponds to the energy interval @xmath38 $ ] .",
    "we find that , using this broaden restricted interval , it is possible to reproduce our results issued from the complete dos .",
    "unfortunately , though several times smaller than the whole energy range , this interval is located in the hardest region from the convergence point of view  @xcite .",
    "so the multirange scheme is unavoidable and several narrow energy intervals are needed to achieve convergence .    in conclusion , from the efficiency and precision point of view , working with a very large crmes guarantees that all the thermodynamical properties will be correctly reproduced , but the computational effort required is at least comparable to performing wl in the whole energy range .",
    "the authors of  @xcite are aware of this and they have proposed , as an alternative , to work on the crmes of _ each sample_. to study this proposal we use our data calculated in the full energy range for each sample @xmath39 and we identify the relevant part of the energy axis for the transition of the considered sample .",
    "this is noted by analogy with @xcite @xmath40 .",
    "conceptually @xmath41 corresponds to the region where the energy probability distribution at the transition temperature is significative for the sample @xmath42 and , in the case of a double peaked distribution , it contains the two peaks .",
    "hence , we identify @xmath41 as the energy interval where @xmath20 is different from zero .",
    "we then recalculate the thermal averages using only the dos restricted to @xmath43 . for the sample shown here the @xmath18 curve we obtained using the whole dos",
    "has two separated peaks .",
    "each of them determines a @xmath19 and hence a restricted energy interval .",
    "we show that the whole structure of @xmath18 can not be reproduced using the dos restricted to the interval associated with only one of the peaks . when @xmath44 is re - calculated using the dos restricted to the interval @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) corresponding to the temperature @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) of one of the peaks , the other is not reproduced ( see figure  [ int_a_b ] ) .",
    "now let s imagine that we determine the crmes for a lattice size @xmath5 .",
    "_ as a larger size implies a new different quenched disorder _ , it is possible that the extrapolation to @xmath35 gives a @xmath49 which does nt include the highest peak of the new sample @xmath50 of size @xmath28 . in that case",
    "the results calculated for @xmath51 will not correspond to the transition region of this new sample .    .",
    ", for @xmath30 , @xmath52 obtained from thermal averages using the dos restricted to three different energy intervals .",
    "interval @xmath53 corresponds to the levels given in  @xcite for l=24 , this union interval reproduces a multi - peaked @xmath54 curve coincident to the one obtained with the whole dos for the sample @xmath39 . on the other hand the restricted intervals @xmath55 and @xmath56 give the curves @xmath57 and @xmath58 respectively centered around the temperatures @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "these temperatures correspond to the peaks of the complete dos , that gave rise to the restricted intervals , as could be expected , width=340 ]",
    "we show , using the example of the 3d - rfim , that the crmes method has to be applied with extreme care to the study of highly disordered systems , because the existence of strong quenched disorder may lead to first order transition properties and strong sample to sample fluctuations .    to begin with",
    ", it is worthwhile noticing that when dealing with disordered systems , increasing @xmath5 automatically changes the distribution of the quenched disorder . hence , if the interval @xmath33 calculated for a sample of size @xmath5 contains the information to reproduce the highest peak of @xmath26 , due to the large sample to sample fluctuations , there is no warranty that the new , extrapolated interval for @xmath28 will reproduce the corresponding peak of @xmath61 @xmath62 .",
    "then one is forced to broaden the interval at @xmath5 to calculate it at @xmath28 .",
    "it should be noticed , however , that there is no rule to control this ; additionally , if the interval is substantially enlarged , the computational effort is similar to that required when one uses the wl method on the whole energy range .",
    "moreover , performing a wl simulation on the whole energy range for small lattices , in order to determine the nature of the transition before using the crmes method should be considered with some care , because it is a methodology prone to reach incorrect conclusions , as we have shown in figure  [ probasl ] . as the lattice size increases the two peaks of @xmath63 become well separated , and there is a risk using this method , to seize only one of them .",
    "this migth explain the anomalous behaviour observed in fig.5 of  @xcite for the largest sizes studied in that work .",
    "the actual nature of the transition of the 3d - rfim , still under discussion , does not change the source of the problem .",
    "would the transition be found second order  in the thermodynamic limit , the use of  eqs .",
    "[ cmes ] and  [ scaling ] would be justified .",
    "nevertheless this would neither change the problem of sample to sample fluctuations , nor the fact that when working with finite sizes @xmath21 would still be double peaked ."
