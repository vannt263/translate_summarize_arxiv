    "in this section we define the topological objects that we will deal with in the paper and we introduce the combinatorial objects that we will use to encode them .",
    "we then describe our first representation result , for manifolds with generic traversing flows ( that we call _ streams _ ) viewed up to diffeomorphism .",
    "let @xmath2 be a smooth , compact , and oriented @xmath3-manifold with non - empty boundary , and let @xmath4 be a nowhere - vanishing vector field on @xmath2 .",
    "we will always in this paper assume the following genericity of the tangency of @xmath4 to @xmath5 , first discussed by morin  @xcite :    * the field @xmath4 is tangent to @xmath5 only along a union @xmath14 of circles , and @xmath4 is tangent to @xmath14 itself at isolated points only ; moreover , at the two sides on @xmath14 of each of these points , @xmath4 points to opposite sides of @xmath14 on @xmath5 .",
    "to graphically illustrate the situation , we introduce some terminology that we will repeatedly employ in the rest of the paper :    * we call _ in - region _",
    "( respectively , _ out - region _ )",
    "the union of the components of @xmath15 on which @xmath4 points towards the interior ( respectively , the exterior ) of @xmath2 ; * if @xmath16 is a point of @xmath14 we will say that @xmath16 is _ concave _ if at @xmath16 the field @xmath4 points from the out - region to the in - region , and _ convex _ if it points from the in - region to the out - region ; this terminology is borrowed from  @xcite and is motivated by the shape of the orbits of @xmath4 near @xmath16 , see fig .",
    "[ concave / convex : fig ] ; +    * a point @xmath16 of @xmath14 at which @xmath4 is tangent to @xmath14 will be termed _",
    "point ; as one easily sees , there are up to diffeomorphism only @xmath17 local models for the field @xmath4 near @xmath16 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ transition / types : fig ] .",
    "+     the next result records obvious facts and two less obvious ones :    [ trans : fate : prop ] let @xmath16 be a point of @xmath5 . then , depending on where @xmath16 lies , the orbit of @xmath4 through @xmath16 extends as follows :    [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     the result is evident except for orbits through the transition points . to deal with them we first analyze what the orbits would be if @xmath4 were projected to @xmath5 , which we do in fig .",
    "[ transition / orbits / first : fig ] .",
    "the picture shows that at the concave - to - convex transition points the orbit of the projection of @xmath4 lies in the out - region , which implies that the orbit of @xmath4 extends backward but not forward , while at the convex - to - concave transition points the opposite happens .    from now on an orbit of @xmath4 reaching a concave - to - convex transition point or leaving from a convex - to - concave transition point",
    "will be termed _",
    "transition orbit_.      our main aim in this paper is to provide a combinatorial presentation of the set of generic flows on @xmath3-manifolds up to homotopy fixed on the boundary , but to achieve this aim we first need to somewhat restrict the class of flows we consider and the equivalence relation on them .",
    "informally , we call _ stream _ on a @xmath3-manifold @xmath2 a vector field @xmath4 satisfying ( g1 ) such that , in addition , all the orbits of @xmath4 start and end on @xmath5 , and the orbits of @xmath4 tangent to @xmath5 are generic with respect to each other .",
    "more precisely , @xmath4 is a stream on @xmath2 if it satisfies the conditions ( g1)-(g4 ) , with :    * every orbit of @xmath4 is either a single point ( a convex point of @xmath14 ) or a closed arc with both ends on @xmath5 ; * the transition orbits are tangent to @xmath5 at their transition point only .    for the next and last condition we note",
    "that if an arc of an orbit of @xmath4 has ends @xmath16 and @xmath18 contained in the interior of @xmath2 then the parallel transport along @xmath4 defines a linear bijection from the tangent space to @xmath2 at @xmath16 to that at @xmath18 .",
    "we then require the following :    * each orbit of @xmath4 is tangent to @xmath5 at two points at most ; if an orbit of @xmath4 is tangent to @xmath5 at two points @xmath16 and @xmath18 , that necessarily are concave points of @xmath14 by conditions ( g2 ) and ( g3 ) , then the tangent directions to @xmath14 at @xmath16 and at @xmath18 are transverse to each other under the bijection defined by the parallel transport along @xmath4 .",
    "this last condition is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ transverse : fig ] .",
    "we will henceforth denote by @xmath19 the set of pairs @xmath1 with @xmath2 an oriented , compact , connected @xmath3-manifold and @xmath4 a stream on @xmath2 , up to diffeomorphism .",
    "we now introduce the objects that will eventually be shown to be the combinatorial counterparts of streams on smooth oriented @xmath3-manifolds .",
    "as above , stating all the requirements takes some time and involves some new terminology .",
    "we will then stepwise introduce 3 conditions ( s1 ) , ( s2 ) , ( s3 ) for a compact and connected @xmath17-dimensional polyhedron @xmath20 , the combination of which will constitute the definition of a _ stream - spine_. we begin with the following :    * a neighbourhood of each point of @xmath20 is homeomorphic to one of the @xmath21 models of fig .",
    "[ local / stream / spine : fig ] .",
    "+     this condition implies that @xmath20 consists of :    1 .   some open surfaces , called _ regions _ , each having a closure in @xmath20 which is a compact surface with possibly immersed boundary ; 2 .   some _ triple lines _ ,",
    "to which three regions are locally incident ; 3 .   some _ single lines _ , to which only one region is locally incident ; 4 .",
    "a finite number of points , called _ vertices _ , to which six regions are locally incident ; 5 .   a finite number of points , called _ spikes _ , to which both a triple and a single line are incident .",
    "we note that a polyhedron satisfying condition ( s1 ) is simple according to matveev  @xcite , but not almost - special if single lines exist .",
    "our next condition was first introduced in  @xcite ; to state it we define a _ screw - orientation _ along an arc of triple line of @xmath20 as an orientation of the arc together with a cyclic ordering of the three germs of regions of @xmath20 incident to the arc , viewed up simultaneous reversal of both , as in fig .",

    "we take a compact polyhedron @xmath20 satisfying condition ( s1 ) of the definition of stream - spine , namely locally appearing as in fig .  [",
    "local / stream / spine : fig ] .",
    "we will say that an embedding of @xmath20 in a @xmath3-manifold @xmath2 is _ branched _ if the following happens upon identifying @xmath20 with its image in @xmath2 ( see fig .  [",

    "our first task is to show that @xmath20 thickens in a pl sense to a well - defined oriented manifold @xmath2 ( later we will need to describe a smooth structure for @xmath2 and the field @xmath4 ) .",
    "this argument extends that of  @xcite .",
    "let us denote by @xmath25 a regular neighbourhood in @xmath20 of the union of the triple lines .",
    "we observe that @xmath25 can be seen as a union of fragments as in fig .",
    "[ thicken : fig]-top , that we thicken        as shown in the bottom part of the same figure , giving each block the orientation such that the screw - orientations along the portions of triple lines of @xmath20 within each block are positive .",
    "note that on the boundary of each block there are some t - shaped regions and that some rectangles are highlighted . following the way @xmath25 is reassembled from the fragments into which it was decomposed",
    ", we can now assemble the blocks by gluing together the t s on their boundary .",
    "( note that the gluing between two t s need not identify the vertical legs to each other , so each t should actually be thought of as a y : the three legs play symmetric rles . )",
    "since the gluings automatically reverse the orientation , the result is an oriented manifold , on the boundary of which we have some highlighted strips , each having the shape of a rectangle or of an annulus .",
    "now we turn to the closure in @xmath20 of the complement of @xmath25 , that we denote by @xmath26 .",
    "of course @xmath26 is a surface with boundary , and on @xmath27 we can highlight the arcs and circles shared with @xmath25 .",
    "( the rest of @xmath27 consists of arcs lying on single lines of @xmath20 . )",
    "we then take the product @xmath28 this is a crucial choice that will be discussed below and note that the highlighted arcs and circles on @xmath27 give highlighted rectangles and annuli on @xmath29 .",
    "we are only left to glue these rectangles and annuli to those on the boundary of the assembled blocks , respecting the way @xmath26 is glued to @xmath25 and making sure the orientation is reversed .",
    "the result is the required manifold @xmath2 .",
    "we must now explain how to smoothen @xmath2 and how to choose the stream @xmath4 .",
    "away from the triple and single lines of @xmath20 the manifold @xmath2 is the product @xmath28 with @xmath26 a surface , so it is sufficient to smoothen @xmath26 and to define @xmath4 to be parallel to the @xmath30 factor and positively transversal to @xmath26 .",
    "( this justifies our choice of thickening @xmath26 as a trivial rather than some other @xmath30-bundle . ) along the triple and single lines of @xmath20 we extend this construction as suggested in a cross - section in fig .",
    "[ smooth / thick : fig ] .",
    "note that a triple line of @xmath20 gives rise to a concave tangency line of @xmath4 to @xmath5 , and that a single line of @xmath20 gives rise to a convex tangency line . to conclude we must illustrate the extension of the construction of @xmath4 near vertices and near spikes , which we do in two examples in fig .",
    "[ vert / spike / thick : fig ] .        in the figure",
    "we represent @xmath4 by showing some of its orbits .",
    "note that :    * in both cases the local configurations of @xmath4 near @xmath5 are as in condition ( g1 ) of the definition of stream ; * the orbits of @xmath4 are closed arcs or points , as in condition ( g2 ) ; * to a vertex of @xmath20 there corresponds an orbit of @xmath4 that is tangent to @xmath5 at two points , in a concave fashion and respecting the transversality condition ( g4 ) ; * to a spike of @xmath20 there corresponds a transition orbit of @xmath4 satisfying condition ( g3 ) .",
    "this shows that @xmath4 is indeed a stream on @xmath2 .",
    "since che construction of @xmath1 is uniquely determined by @xmath20 , the proof is complete .      in this subsection",
    "we prove that the construction of proposition  [ spine : to : stream : prop ] can be reversed , namely that the map @xmath24 is bijective .",

    "if @xmath20 is a stream - spine and @xmath1 is the associated manifold - stream pair as in proposition  [ spine : to : stream : prop ] , then the in - backward and out - forward polyhedra associated to @xmath1 are isomorphic to @xmath20 .",
    "most of the assertions are easy , so we confine ourselves to the main points .",
    "it is first of all obvious that away from the special orbits of @xmath4 as in conditions ( g3 ) and ( g4 ) the concave tangency lines of @xmath4 to @xmath5 generate triple lines in the in - backward and out - forward polyhedra associated to @xmath1 , while convex tangency lines generate single lines .",
    "moreover , if from a stream - spine @xmath20 we go to @xmath1 and then to the associated in - backward and out - forward polyhedra , away from the vertices and spikes of @xmath20 we see that these polyhedra are naturally isomorphic to @xmath20 , as shown in a cross - section in fig .  [ p / to / m / to / io : fig ] .",
    "the fact that an orbit of @xmath4 as in condition ( g4 ) generates a vertex in the in - backward and out - forward polyhedra associated to @xmath1 was already shown in  @xcite , but we reproduce the argument here for the sake of completeness , showing in fig .  [ g4/to / vertex : fig]-left , top and bottom ,        the in - backward and the out - forward spines near the orbit of fig .",

    "moreover , the concave - to - convex configuration of @xmath4 near @xmath5 is precisely that generated by a spike as in fig .",

    "this concludes the proof .    combining propositions  [ spine : to : stream : prop ] and  [ stream : to : spine : prop ] we get the following main result of this section :    [ stream : homeo : thm ] the map @xmath24 from the set of stream - spines up to isomorphism to the set of streams on @xmath3-manifolds up",

    "we then define @xmath11 as the quotient of @xmath19 under the equivalence relation of stream - homotopy .",
    "the next result shows how to factor this relation into easier ones :    [ catastrophes : prop ] stream - homotopy is generated by isotopy and by the elementary moves shown in figg .",
    "[ 20/catastrophe : fig ] to  [ catastrophe / trans / in : fig ] .",
    "it is evident that taking a generic perturbation of a homotopy one only gets the elementary catastrophes of the statement , plus perhaps finitely many times at which an orbit starts and ends at transition points .",
    "we then only need to show that this type of catastrophe can be generically avoided during a homotopy .",
    "to do so we carefully analyze in fig .",
    "[ near / transition / in : fig ]        the initial portions of the orbits close to an incoming transition orbit . in the type of catastrophe",

    "note that at @xmath16 with the first choice we obviously create a catastrophe as in fig .",
    "[ catastrophe / trans / in : fig ] , but for an outgoing transition orbit , while with the second choice we do not create any catastrophe at @xmath16 . on the other hand at the starting point of orbit @xmath32 in fig .",
    "[ near / transition / in : fig ] we could create a catastrophe as in fig .",
    "[ catastrophe / trans / in : fig ] with one of the two choices and no catastrophe with the other choice , but we can not predict which is which .",
    "this shows that we can always get rid of a doubly transition orbit either at no cost or by inserting one catastrophe as in fig .",
    "[ catastrophe / trans / in : fig ] .      in this subsection",
    "we introduce certain combinatorial moves on stream - spines .",
    "we do so showing pictures and always meaning that the mirror images in @xmath3-space of the moves that we represent are also allowed and named in the same way .",
