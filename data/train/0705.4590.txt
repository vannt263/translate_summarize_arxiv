    "such a geometric locus will be called the _ conchoid of @xmath7 from the focus @xmath2 at distance @xmath0_.    the two classical and most famous conchoids are the _ conchoid of nicomedes _ ( see example [ example-3 ] and fig . [ fig - nicomedes ] ) and the _ limaon of pascal _",

    ", to solve the problems of doubling the cube and of trisecting an angle .",
    "conchoids play an important role in many applications as construction of buildings ( one can already find specific methods for producing limaons in albert drer s _ underweysung der messung _ ) , astronomy ( see @xcite ) , electromagnetic research ( see @xcite ) , physics ( see @xcite ) , optics ( see @xcite ) , engineering in medicine and biology ( see @xcite , @xcite ) , mechanical in fluid processing ( see @xcite ) , etc .",
    "although conchoids have been extensively used and applied in different areas , a deep theoretical analysis of the concept and its main properties is missing ; at least from our point of view . in this paper",
    ", we consider conchoids from the perspective of algebraic geometry , and we study their main algebraic properties , with the aim of building a solid bridge from theory to practice that can be used for further theoretical and applied developments .",
    "more precisely , we introduce the formal definition of conchoid of an algebraic curve , over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero , by means of incidence diagrams . we also introduce the notion of generic conchoid , and we show how elimination theory techniques , as grbner bases , can be applied to compute conchoids .",
    "we prove that , with the exception of a circle centered at the focus and taking @xmath0 as its radius , the conchoid is an algebraic curve having at most two irreducible components .",
    "note that for the particular circle , mentioned above , the conchoid consists in two components : a circle of radius @xmath8 and the zero - dimensional set formed by the focus .",
    "in addition , we introduce the notions of special and simple components of a conchoid .",
    "essentially , a component of a conchoid is special if its points are generated for more than one point of the original curve .",
    "this phenomenon appears when one computes conchoids of conchoids .",
    "moreover we state that , with the exception of lines passing through the focus , the conchoid always has at least one simple component .",
    "furthermore we prove that , for almost every distance and with the exception of lines passing through the focus , all the components of the conchoid are simple .",
    "simple and special components play an important role in the study of conchoids . on one hand ,",
    "simple components are related to the birationality of the maps in the incidence diagram ( for instance , if a conchoid has two components , its simple components are birationally equivalent to the initial curve ) and , on the other hand , special components can be used to decide whether a given algebraic curve is the conchoid of another curve .",
    "a similar behavior of simple components holds for offsets ( see @xcite ) , and have allowed us to provide formulas for the genus ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we plan to investigate this , for the case of conchoids , in our future research .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section [ sec - def - conchoid ] ,",
    "we formally introduce the notion of conchoid of an algebraic curve . in section [ sec - basic - prop - conchoids ] we state the basic algebraic properties of conchoids .",
