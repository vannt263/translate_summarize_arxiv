    "it has long been recognized , however , that using complementary measurements of structure , as described above , significantly reduces the sensitivity of the results to such necessary assumptions ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , it is imperative that any systematic uncertainties affecting the measurements of cosmic structure be properly accounted for in order to obtain robust results .    the amount of structure in the local universe is generally described by the parameter @xmath17 , defined as the present day root - mean - square fluctuation of the linearly evolved matter density field , smoothed by a spherical top - hat window of comoving radius @xmath18 ; here @xmath19 is the normalized hubble parameter . at present , the most robust observation for measuring this quantity is arguably the abundance of massive galaxy clusters ; independent of spectral index of the power spectrum , @xmath20 .",

    "consequently , recent estimates of @xmath17 based on independent analyses of galaxy cluster data ( both optically and x - ray selected clusters ) are in very good agreement [ @xmath21 ; @xcite ( hereafter ) ; @xcite ] . recent analyses of cosmic shear data are also in good agreement @xcite , and provide compatible constraints on the neutrino mass to our own @xcite .",

    "we note that @xcite obtain very similar results to our own by importance sampling 5-year _ wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe _ ( _ wmap _ ) results using a prior based on the analysis of optically selected clusters by @xcite .",
    "the basic cosmology that we consider in this paper is the spatially flat , cosmological constant ( @xmath2cdm ) model parametrized by the mean baryon density , @xmath23 ; the mean total matter density including baryons , neutrinos and cold dark matter ( cdm ) , @xmath24 ; the hubble parameter , @xmath25 ; the normalization of the matter power spectrum , @xmath17 ; the spectral index of the primordial scalar power spectrum , @xmath20 ; and the optical depth to reionization , @xmath26 . here",
    "the mean densities refer to the present day ( redshift @xmath27 ) , since their values at other times are then determined by the friedmann equation , and @xmath28 is the @xmath27 variance in the matter density field at scales of @xmath18 , as defined above .",
    "this simple and commonly used model assumes @xmath29 and @xmath30 , the predicted value for the three weakly interacting neutrinos .",
    "in addition to freeing @xmath0 and @xmath3 , we will consider the effect of marginalizing over other parameters with which they are degenerate .",
    "however , since the flat @xmath2cdm model is known to provide a good fit to currently available cosmological data , we are conservative in incorporating these additional degrees of freedom . in particular , we consider generalizing the description of dark energy , either by allowing global spatial curvature or by varying the dark energy equation of state in a flat universe , and including the effects of primordial tensor perturbations .",
    "the former case is parameterized by the effective curvature energy density , @xmath5 , or the equation of state parameter , @xmath31 , while in the latter case we simultaneously marginalize over the tensor - to - scalar ratio , @xmath6 ( defined with respect to wavenumber @xmath32 , as in , e.g. , @xcite ) , and the tensor power spectral index , @xmath7 .    in our results",
    ", we will consistently quote one - sided limits ( upper bounds ) on @xmath0 and @xmath6 at the 95.4 per cent confidence level and two - sided constraints on all other parameters at 68.3 per cent confidence .",
    "although the purpose of this work is to explore the constraints enabled by the xlf data , it is instructive to begin by considering the cosmological constraints on @xmath0 that have been obtained without using measurements of local cosmic structure . as described by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "cmb observations alone provide a limit that , while weak ( @xmath33 at 95.4 per cent confidence ) , is relatively robust to assumptions about dark energy and primordial tensors .",
    "( tables  [ tab : msdegen ] and [ tab : nhdegen ] ) . ] while we do not review the details here , the constraint arises because the effect of neutrino mass on the cmb temperature anisotropy spectrum is qualitatively different when neutrinos are relativistic compared with non - relativistic during the decoupling epoch . in particular , for @xmath34 , changes in @xmath0 can be easily mimicked by a corresponding change in the hubble parameter , @xmath25 . as a result",
    ", @xmath0 is strongly degenerate with @xmath25 in analyses using only cmb data , which does not itself constrain @xmath25 .",
    "the combination of cmb data with distance measurements in the form of snia and bao data can place a constraint on @xmath25 , improving the limits on @xmath0 by roughly a factor of two ( @xmath35 for a spatially flat @xmath2cdm background ; * ? ? ?",
    "as we will show , the inclusion of a measurement of local cosmic structure in the form of galaxy cluster abundance can improve these limits by another factor of two or greater , and furthermore greatly increase the robustness of the results to assumptions about the nature of dark energy and inflation .",
    "this improvement is possible because the combination of large - scale , high - redshift and intermediate - scale , low - redshift measurements of cosmic structure exploits the defining characteristic of light , weakly interacting particles : they are relativistic during the earliest stages of cosmic structure formation but non - relativistic at the present day . obtained from flavor oscillation measurements",
    "] the imprint of neutrinos on cosmic structure , and in particular on the growth of structure from the surface of last scattering to the present , thus differs from that of the photon background ( relativistic at all times ) and cdm ( assumed to be non - relativistic at all times ) .",
    "in particular , a non - zero mass in neutrinos results in a net suppression of the growth of structure on scales smaller than their free - streaming length ( approximately corresponding to wavenumber @xmath36 today ) relative to an equal mass in cdm @xcite .    in practical terms , the constraint on @xmath0 arising from the combination of cmb and cluster data can be understood as follows .",
    "even when @xmath37 , the cmb data provide a good constraint on the high - redshift amplitude of the power spectrum , since the direct effect of neutrino mass on the observed temperature anisotropies is relatively small . however , the late - time , intermediate - scale power spectrum amplitude ( the value of @xmath17 ) that would be predicted based on that high - redshift constraint is very sensitive to @xmath0 , since neutrino mass suppresses the development of structure on those scales .",
    "this strong degeneracy is apparent in the blue confidence regions in figure  [ fig : mslcdm ] . by constraining @xmath17 independently of @xmath0 ,",
    "clusters ( or other low - redshift structure measurements ) break this degeneracy , improving the constraints on neutrino mass ( gold contours in the figure ) .",
    "even more power is available if the growth of structure can be measured , exploiting the time - dependent nature of the effects of neutrino mass on cosmic structure development ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "however , we show in section  [ sec : mnusimple ] that the growth of structure in current cluster data , while able to constrain models of dark energy (; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and modified gravity ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , are not yet sufficient to contribute to constraints on @xmath0 .    in the case of the effective number of relativistic species , @xmath3 , cmb data alone can provide a lower bound , due to the gravitational effect of their anisotropic stress .",
    "apart from providing this bound , however , the cmb data are hampered by a near - perfect degeneracy between @xmath3 and @xmath38 , the physical matter density @xcite .",
    "this degeneracy arises because cmb observations do not constrain either @xmath3 or @xmath38 directly , only the redshift of matter - radiation equality , @xmath39 , which is a function of both parameters .",
    "again , the addition of cosmic distance measurements can reduce the effect of this degeneracy by placing an independent constraint on @xmath38 ; @xcite obtained @xmath40 ( 68 per cent confidence ) .",
    "measurements of local structure can also contribute to improved constraints on @xmath3 , as we show in section  [ sec : neffresults ] .",
    "the contribution of clusters to this problem is less direct than in the case of @xmath0 : the constraint on @xmath17 and @xmath24 from cluster data improves the constraint on @xmath38 from the cmb+distance measurements ( e.g. figure  1 of ) , indirectly improving the constraint on @xmath3 through the degeneracy described above .",
    "the galaxy cluster data used in this work , as well as their selection and reduction , are discussed in detail in . using three wide - area cluster samples drawn from the _ rosat _ all - sky survey ( rass ; * ? ? ?",

    "the gas mass is used as a proxy for total mass , using the finding of @xcite that the gas mass fraction , @xmath43 , is a constant for hot , massive clusters ( see also section  [ sec : method ] ) .",
    "cluster @xmath22 measurements additionally provide a precise measure of cosmic distance , so we include the full data set and analysis of allen et  al . in this work .",
    "in addition to these cluster data sets , we incorporate cmb , snia and bao data .",

    "our analysis of the union supernova sample of @xcite includes their treatment of systematic uncertainties , which accounts for the effects of malmquist bias and uncertainties in lightcurve fitting and photometry ( among others ) .",
    "the method used to analyze cluster @xmath22 data is described in full by @xcite .",
    "it incorporates generous systematic allowances for instrument calibration ( 10 per cent ) , non - thermal pressure support ( 10 per cent , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the depletion of baryons in clusters with respect to the cosmic mean ( 20 per cent ) , and evolution with redshift of the baryonic and stellar content of clusters ( 10 and 20 per cent ) .",
    "the analysis of the xlf data is detailed in .",
    "the method combines cluster survey data with follow - up observations in an internally consistent way , rigorously accounting for the effects of malmquist and eddington biases and parameter degeneracies .",
    "conservative systematic allowances are included to account for uncertainty in the predicted cluster mass function , the overall cluster survey completeness and purity , and instrument calibration .    as discussed in section  [ sec : background ] and illustrated in sections  [ sec : mnuresults ] and [ sec : neffresults ] , the xlf data contribute to constraints on @xmath0 and @xmath3 through their measurement of @xmath17 .",
    "the posterior uncertainty on this measurement ( from the xlf alone ) is @xmath49 per cent , and is dominated by systematic uncertainty , as described in . specifically , the uncertainty in @xmath17 is determined by the accuracy with which cluster masses can be measured . as detailed in , we do not directly infer cluster masses at @xmath42 by assuming hydrostatic equilibrium of the intracluster medium , a procedure which , when applied to a typical cluster , introduces a large and highly variable bias @xcite .",
    "instead , we use the gas mass at @xmath42 , which can be measured without significant bias , as a proxy for total mass . the proxy relation is calibrated using the @xmath22 data of @xcite , which effectively consist of gas mass and total mass measurements for the subset of clusters where the hydrostatic assumption is applicable ( the most massive , dynamically relaxed clusters ) . of the systematic allowances described above",
    ", the most relevant for this procedure are the allowances for non - thermal support and instrument calibration in the @xmath22 analysis .",
    "in addition , we account for uncertainty in the difference in @xmath22 between @xmath50 ( as measured by allen et  al . ) and @xmath42 , as well as possible scatter in @xmath22 from cluster to cluster ( see ) .",
    "ultimately , both our estimates of individual masses and the mean cluster mass scale include a systematic error budget of @xmath51 per cent .",
    "we first consider the case of a spatially flat @xmath2cdm cosmology with non - zero neutrino mass .",
    "for this model , the joint 68.3 and 95.4 per cent confidence regions in the @xmath0-@xmath17 plane from the combination of cmb , @xmath22 , snia and bao data appear in the left panel of figure  [ fig : mslcdm ] ( blue contours ) .",
    "the 95.4 per cent confidence upper bound on @xmath0 from these data ( including the systematic allowances described in section  [ sec : method ] ) is @xmath52 ( table  [ tab : msdegen ] ) , a marginal improvement over that obtained by @xcite using only _ wmap _ , snia and bao data .",
    "however , it is clear in the figure that a tight constraint on @xmath17 can improve the limits on @xmath0 . the upper limit obtained by including the xlf data , which provide such a constraint , is @xmath53 ( corresponding to the gold contours in figure  [ fig : mslcdm ] ) , nearly a factor of two improvement .",
    "we note that when the results excluding the xlf data are combined with the gaussian prior @xmath54 , based on the xlf results for a flat @xmath2cdm cosmology with @xmath55 ( ) , the limits on @xmath0 obtained are virtually identical to those from the full combination of data , @xmath53 . from this",
    "we conclude that the xlf data currently contribute to the bound on @xmath0 only through their ability to constrain @xmath17 ; the effect of non - zero neutrino mass on the ( time - dependent ) growth of structure is not detected in the present data .          [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : nhdegen ]    the addition of nuisance parameters in the form of curvature , tensors , and non - zero neutrino mass tends to weaken the constraints on @xmath3 and @xmath25 along their primary degeneracy axis , similarly to what was observed in section  [ sec : mnuexten ] .",
    "table  [ tab : nhdegen ] lists the constraints obtained with and without the @xmath25 prior when various nuisance parameters are marginalized over , as well as when the xlf data are included in the fit . as the table shows ,",
    "the inclusion of the prior on @xmath25 effectively eliminates the degeneracies between @xmath3 and the nuisance parameters ; in particular , the constraint on @xmath3 obtained when marginalizing over curvature , tensors and neutrino mass simultaneously , @xmath56 , is very similar to those obtained when the nuisance parameters are fixed , @xmath57 . with so much extra freedom in the model",
    ", the inclusion of the xlf data produces only a small improvement in @xmath3 in that case .",
    "an interesting question is where future improvements in the determination of @xmath0 and @xmath3 from cosmological data will come from .",
    "one simple way of addressing this is to see what other cosmological parameters are most correlated with the parameters of interest in the current results .",
    "we consider the simple cases of a @xmath2cdm model where either @xmath0 or @xmath3 is additionally free , as well as the more general case with both parameters free in addition to curvature and tensor modes .",
    "when only @xmath0 is additionally free , it remains most degenerate with @xmath17 , despite the tight constraints placed on this parameter by current data , with a correlation coefficient of @xmath58 . in the more general model ( with @xmath0 , @xmath3 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 free ) , the degeneracy with @xmath17 is also relatively important ( @xmath59 ) , but degeneracies with @xmath38 ( @xmath60 ) and @xmath5 ( @xmath61 ) appear at approximately the same level .",
    "the situation will change , however , with the availability of improved cmb data from _ planck _",
    ", and ultimately from future high - resolution cmb polarization and lensing observations .",
    "these new data will tighten constraints on a number of parameters that contribute to the width of the degenerate region in the @xmath0-@xmath17 plane , , @xmath26 , @xmath20 and the high - redshift power spectrum amplitude all contribute to the width . ] ( figures  [ fig : mslcdm ] and [ fig : msdegen ] ; @xcite ) resulting in a stronger correlation of @xmath0 with @xmath17 .    using a simulated _ planck _ data",
    "set produced using the futurcmb code of @xcite , we project that such data , combined with a 2  per cent constraint on @xmath17 , will produce a limit @xmath62 for minimal neutrino mass in the normal hierarchy ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "alternatively , @xmath29 would be ruled out at approximately @xmath64 significance for minimal neutrino mass in the inverted hierarchy ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "a constraint on @xmath17 at this level may be possible in the near term from galaxy cluster observations , primarily by better understanding cluster mass measurements ( e.g. @xcite ; von  der  linden et  al .",
    ", in preparation ) , as well as from improved measurements of the cmb power spectrum at multipoles @xmath66 @xcite",
    ".    as growth of structure data become available at higher redshifts , the time - dependent effects of neutrino mass on structure formation will also provide a powerful and more direct constraint on @xmath0 .",
    "future cluster surveys may provide limits an order of magnitude better than current results @xcite .",
    "eventually , other cosmological observables , e.g. the cross - correlation of lyman - alpha absorption with cmb convergence @xcite , may extend measurements of structure formation to even higher redshifts ( @xmath67 ) .      unsurprisingly , the correlation of @xmath3 with @xmath38 is dominant in both the simple ( @xmath2cdm+@xmath3 ) and more general ( @xmath0 , @xmath3 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 free ) models , respectively with @xmath68 and 0.87 , although we note that in the simple case there is also a strong degeneracy with @xmath17 ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "thus , improved measurements of the hubble parameter and/or mean matter density will be very significant for cosmological constraints on @xmath3 .    in particular , we consider the possibility of a direct constraint on @xmath25 at the 2 per cent level .",
    "such a constraint could come from several avenues , including _",
    "( and ultimately the _ james webb space telescope _ ) observations of cepheids and snia @xcite , gravitational lensing time delays ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or the comparison of the compton-@xmath70 parameter inferred from sunyaev - zeldovich and x - ray observations of clusters ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the latter two naturally complement efforts to extend measurements of the growth of structure using clusters to larger samples and higher redshifts .",
    "even with no other improvements in cosmological data , such a measurement ( we take @xmath71 , for concreteness ) would provide a constraint @xmath72 in the simple @xmath2cdm+@xmath3 model , or @xmath73 in the general model ( parameters listed above ; 68.3 per cent confidence ) .",
    "since @xmath3 and @xmath0 are degenerate in this model , the upper limit on @xmath0 would also be improved , from 0.70 to 0.55@xmath74 .",
    "we have applied measurements of the growth of massive galaxy clusters ( detailed in papers  i and ii ) , in combination with other cosmological data , to the problem of constraining the species - summed neutrino mass , @xmath0 , and effective number , @xmath3 .",
    "our results show that a robust measurement of @xmath17 from clusters significantly improves limits on @xmath0 from current data , and reduces their sensitivity to assumptions about the cosmological model . in a simple @xmath2cdm+@xmath0 cosmology ,",
    "the addition of the xlf data improves the 95.4 per cent confidence upper limit on @xmath0 to 0.33@xmath74 , compared with 0.61@xmath74 from the combination of cmb , @xmath22 , snia and bao data . in a more general model ,",
    "marginalized over spatial curvature , primordial tensors and the effective number of neutrinos , and incorporating a prior on the hubble parameter , the xlf data improve the limit from 1.75@xmath74 to 0.7@xmath74 .",
    "the results indicate that this improvement is due entirely to the ability of the cluster data to constrain @xmath17 ( at @xmath27 ) ; while measurements of the ( @xmath75-dependent ) growth of structure in principle contain additional information about @xmath0 , current data are not sufficient to exploit it .",
    "the cluster data additionally improve constraints on the effective number of relativistic species , from @xmath57 to @xmath4 in a simple @xmath2cdm+@xmath3 model ( 68.3 per cent confidence ) .",
    "for the more general model , including curvature , tensors and neutrino mass , only a marginal improvement is observed .",
