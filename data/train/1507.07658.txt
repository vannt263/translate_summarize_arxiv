    "surface resistance is very important in the operation of superconducting cavity @xcite .",
    "as one can see from equation ( 1 ) , surface resistance is the function of a temperature dependent term and a temperature independent one .",
    "temperature dependent resistance simply decreases as temperature goes down in a metal since the number of phonons decreases according to boltzmann factor @xcite .",
    "@xmath0    practically , the operating temperature of a superconducting cavity is usually determined in such a way to achieve possibly low surface resistance as long as an economical issue allows . in other words",
    ", the operating temperature can not be infinitely low since lowering temperature always demands substantial cost .",
    "for the raon accelerator , a quarter wave resonator ( qwr ) cavity will be operated at 4k while the rest cavities will be operated at 2k @xcite .",
    "unlike the temperature dependent resistance , the temperature independent resistance , which is called a residual resistance , is due to various factors .",
    "it has been reported that defects acting scattering centers contribute to the residual resistance such as inclusions , voids , dislocations with a crystal lattice itself @xcite .",
    "thus , lowering residual resistance is essential to achieve low surface resistance .",
    "basically , the more pure material is , the lower residual resistance one can obtain . since the residual resistance ratio ( rrr ) is defined as the ratio of a resistance at 300k to a residual resistance ( resistance at or just above critical temperature , @xmath1 of nb @xmath2 9.2k ) @xcite , one can have high rrr with the more pure material .",
    "fabrication process of superconducting cavities is very complicated since it requires mechanical ( pressing ) , electrical ( electron beam welding ) , and chemical ( polishing ) process @xcite . among these steps ,",
    "the electrical process ( e - beam welding ) is of our interest in this paper .",
    "generally , the rrr degrades during e - beam welding due to the introduction of impurities from surroundings such as oxygen , nitrogen , and hydrogen @xcite . although previous studies reported that a vacuum level of a chamber is the most critical , but still e - beam welding conditions , such as e - beam power and welding speed , are considered important as much as the vacuum level because they make a great effect on the heat affected zone ( haz ) in a welding part @xcite .    in this paper , we report rrr degradation occurred during e - beam welding of niobium samples .",
    "we measured rrr with different conditions ; vacuum level , e - beam power , and welding speed .",
    "not only we compared rrr degradation , but also we analyzed a heat affected zone ( haz ) .",
    "thus , we finally report how rrr degradation and heat affected zone were affected by different e - beam welding conditions .",
    "a rrr 300 grade niobium sheet was from ati , wah chang inc .",
    "( albany , usa . ) with the size of @xmath3 mm@xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "the chemical composition and the grain size of nb sheet satisfies each astm @xmath6 and astm @xmath7 .",
    "samples for experiments were prepared from two different companies ( a & b ) and the sequences are as follows .",
    "first , two companies cut the nb sheet of 3 mm in thickness into two different sets of width and length for butt welding @xcite : two nb pieces of @xmath8 mm@xmath9 by company a and two nb pieces of @xmath10 mm@xmath9 by company b. thus , the company a prepared the welded nb sheet of @xmath11 mm@xmath4 , and the company b prepared the welded nb sheet of @xmath12 mm@xmath9 . then , rrr samples were cut out of these welded nb sheets perpendicular to a welding line .",
    "each nb sample was cut by electrical discharge machining ( edm ) @xcite with the size of @xmath13 mm@xmath4 .",
    "[ p1 ] shows how the pieces of nb sheet were welded , and samples were cut out from the welded nb sheet by the company b. also , fig .",
    "[ p2 ] shows the layout of cut samples , all samples were perpendicular to the welding line , and the distance from the weld seam increased from left to right ( 0 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , and 15 , 20 , 25 mm ) . as shown in fig .",
    "[ p2 ] , in order to compare differences in rrr between the welding part and the bead part , two types of samples were cut from the welding side and the bead side . since nine samples were cut out from each side , eighteen samples in total were prepared from both sides of one welded nb sheet .",
    "welding conditions of two companies are summarized in table   [ t1 ] .    in this study",
    ", we defined the rrr value as the ratio of the nb resistance at 300k to the nb resistance at the temperature just above critical temperature ( @xmath14 @xmath2 9.2k ) where nb still is in the normal conducting state . that temperature ranges from 9.5k to 10k .",
    "the input current was 5 ma , and rrr measurement was performed with no magnetic field application . since the generated power in the sample ( @xmath2 10@xmath15 watt ) due to this level of input current is negligible compared to the cooling power of sample stage in ppms ( @xmath2 10@xmath16 watt ) , the 5ma input current level dose not vary the resistance of the sample while measurement . the time for stabilizing each temperature step was between 100 @xmath2 200 sec",
    "the temperature increments were 0.1k up to 15k , 1k from 16k to 30k , and 5k from 35k to 300k .",
    "rrr experiments were carried out with physical property measurement system ( ppms ) operated by the korea basic science institute ( kbsi ) .",
    "mm@xmath9 was butt - welded by joining two nb sheet of @xmath10 mm@xmath9 .",
    "weld side ( left ) , bead side ( right ) .",
    ", width=604 ]     mm@xmath4 for rrr measurement . ,",
    "width=604 ]        .welding conditions for sample preparation [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ t3 ]            from the fig .",
    "[ p6 ] , rrr degradation of the samples from company a occurred less than company b. this is in good agreement with previous studies @xcite since rrr degradation is greatly affected by a vacuum level .",
    "as shown in table  [ t1 ] , the vacuum levels of two companies each are @xmath17 torr for company a , and @xmath18 torr for company b. therefore , we could confirm that samples from company a showed higher rrr values ( less degradation ) than company b as the average rrr ( 292 vs. 264 ) , and the lowest rrr ( 253 vs. 234 ) .",
    "the worst degradation rates based on the lowest points were each 20% and 44 % corresponding to company a and b. in fact , risp set the minimum rrr value as 275 , so only less than 8% of degradation is allowable in raon project .",
    "although the degradation rate of samples from company a satisfied this criteria as 3% and 8% in the weld side ( these was based on the average rrr ) , the rest degradation rates did not satisfy the criteria .",
    "we might think this was due to the vacuum level , that is to say , the vacuum level gauge did not read precisely the real vacuum level in the e - beam chamber , thus the real vacuum level during the welding did not reach @xmath17 torr .",
    "so we should perform more experiments to confirm this result .",
    "interesting results were that the rrr degradation in the weld side where the e - beam welding directly occurred was less than in the bead side for all samples regardless of companies . according to previous studies @xcite , the part where the e - beam welding directly occurred showed high rrr value since this part experienced purification due to the `` melting '' just like the zone melting method used in such as a nb purification and a semiconductor purification @xcite .",
    "this result can be explained from the fact that a liquid phase can hold more solute atoms ( impurities ) than a solid phase , and the melting the solid into the liquid phase drives impurities from solid to liquid .",
    "then , impurities in the liquid are driven into the solid quickly on cooling since the diffusivity of impurities in the liquid can be assumed evenly faster than in the solid .",
    "thus , it makes adjacent solid part has more impurities @xcite .",
    "therefore , the driven effect of impurities caused the weld side to be more purified than the bead side although these two parts experienced the melting event during the e - beam welding .",
    "another result to be discussed here is a heat affected zone ( haz ) .",
    "the rrr degradation occurs seriously in this region because grains in this region are greatly altered by a heat introduction depending on the e - beam power and the welding speed while rrr recovers as much as bulk material outside this region .",
    "therefore , controlling ( narrowing ) the haz is an important issue for optimizing e - beam welding to keep rrr degradation above the target value . from the w. singer s work @xcite",
    ", the haz was around 10 mm from the weld seam . by looking at fig .",
    "[ p3 ] and fig .",
    "[ p4 ] , the haz was around 15 mm where rrr started to recover as high as bulk s value for both companies .",
    "in particular , the rrr of the bead side from company b was still far lower than the reference sample up to 25 mm , which means the haz expanded into the bulk level . one possible explanation is because too much heat was introduced in the welding part , and this heat did not spread out quickly through the whole sample during e - beam welding . in fact , nb has a low thermal conductivity , for example , the thermal conductivity of copper is larger than that of niobium by one order",
    ". therefore , the welded part of nb did not have enough time to dissipate overheat quickly into the whole sample due to the low thermal conductivity .",
    "consequently , the development of the optimized welding condition including the welding power and the welding speed should be established in order to achieve good haz ( narrow haz ) . as a next step ,",
    "we need more experiments to analyze quantitatively how much heat was generated in the welding zone and how much grains were affected with the function of welding power and speed by using high quality optical microscope or sem .",
    "the rrr measurements with the 300 rrr grade nb samples supplied from two companies of different welding conditions were carried out .",
    "we confirmed that the vacuum level was critical factor to avoid rrr degradation since the degradation rate of company a having @xmath17 torr was lower than that of company b having @xmath18 torr .",
    "also , we found that the degradation of the weld side where the melting directly occurred showed lower degradation than the bead side .",
    "in addition , we found that the haz could be varied by controlling the welding condition , which was the heat introduction .",
    "the haz expanded deeper into the bulk when the heat was introduced too much in the welding zone .",
    "we thank kbsi for performing rrr tests for this study .",
