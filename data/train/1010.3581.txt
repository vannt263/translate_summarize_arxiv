    "the recent discovery of superconductivity in iron - pnictides @xcite has generated an intense research activity , in part because they provide an unexpected and very interesting scenario to study the interplay between magnetism and superconductivity.@xcite the interest for these compounds is enhanced by the fact that they share many properties with the high-@xmath4 cuprates ( htsc ) , as the layered structure , a similar evolution of the superconducting parameters with doping , and the proximity to a magnetic transition.@xcite as it is still the case of the htsc , the pairing mechanism in superconducting iron pnictides is not yet known , making the phenomenological descriptions of their superconducting transition a central issue of the present researches on these compounds . as first established in the pioneering experiments by m. tinkham and coworkers in low-@xmath4 metallic superconductors,@xcite a powerful tool to probe at a phenomenological level the own nature of a superconducting transition is the diamagnetism induced above @xmath4 by thermally activated cooper pairs.@xcite the fluctuation diamagnetism above @xmath4 ( sometimes called _",
    "precursor diamagnetism _ ) was also early used to characterize at a phenomenological level the superconducting transition in both optimally - doped @xcite and underdoped @xcite high-@xmath4 cuprates . however , in spite of its interest the precursor diamagnetism received little attention due to both the relative smallness of the superconducting fluctuation effects above @xmath4 in these compounds and , mainly , to the need of high quality single crystals , with a relatively sharp superconducting transition.@xcite    in this paper we report measurements in superconducting iron - pnictides of the fluctuation - induced diamagnetism above @xmath4 , which were possible by applying high resolution magnetometry to a ba@xmath0k@xmath1fe@xmath2as@xmath2 single crystal with an excellent chemical and structural quality .",
    "these data allow an experimental demonstration that the superconducting transition of these materials may be explained at a phenomenological level in terms of the gaussian ginzburg - landau approach for three - dimensional anisotropic superconductors ( 3d - agl ) .",
    "this conclusion excludes phase incoherent superconductivity above @xmath4 in iron - pnictides , a long standing but still at present debated issue of the htsc physics.@xcite also , it provides a direct check of the fluctuations dimensionality : while bulk low-@xmath4 superconductors ( ltsc ) behave as three - dimensional ( 3d ) and most htsc as two - dimensional ( 2d ) , @xcite it has been recently proposed that iron - pnictides are in an intermediate regime as a consequence of their moderate anisotropy.@xcite in relation with this , another interesting aspect of our work is that the fluctuation diamagnetism is probed with magnetic fields applied along the two main crystallographic directions .",
    "this allows to accede directly to the superconducting anisotropy factor , but also to study an interesting issue recently observed in other moderately anisotropic superconductor ( nbse@xmath2 ) , as it is the anisotropy of non - local electrodynamic effects.@xcite",
    "layers . @xmath4 and its uncertainty were estimated from the maximum of @xmath5 ( solid line ) , and from the high - temperature half - width at half - maximum ( this eludes the possible widening associated to the transit through the mixed state ) . ]",
    "the ba@xmath0k@xmath1fe@xmath2as@xmath2 sample ( with @xmath6 ) used in this work is a @xmath7 mm@xmath8 ( 430  @xmath9 g ) single crystal .",
    "details of its growth procedure and characterization may be seen in ref .  .",
    "we have chosen such a small crystal because it presents a well defined transition temperature which is essential to study critical phenomena .",
    "the measurements were performed with a magnetometer based in the superconducting quantum interference ( quantum design , model mpms - xl ) . to position",
    "the crystal with the magnetic field , @xmath10 , applied parallel to the crystal @xmath3 layers , we used a quartz sample holder ( 0.3 cm in diameter , 22 cm in length ) to which the crystal was glued with ge varnish .",
    "two plastic rods at the sample holder ends ( @xmath11 mm smaller than the sample space diameter ) ensured that its alignment was better than @xmath12 . for the measurements with @xmath13 we made a groove ( @xmath11 mm wide ) in the sample holder into which the crystal was glued also with ge varnish .",
    "the crystal alignment was checked by optical microscopy to be better than @xmath14 .",
    "this allowed to determine the anisotropy factor from the anisotropy of the precursor diamagnetism with a @xmath15% uncertainty.@xcite    as a first magnetic characterization , in fig .  1 it is presented the temperature dependence of the zero - field - cooled zfc and field - cooled fc magnetic susceptibilities , measured with a magnetic field of 0.5 mt perpendicular to the @xmath3 planes .",
    "these measurements were corrected for demagnetizing effects by using as demagnetizing factor @xmath16 , which was obtained by approximating the crystal shape by the inscribed ellipsoid .",
    "a proof of the adequacy of this procedure is that the zfc magnetic susceptibility in the meissner region is close to the ideal value ( -1 ) well below @xmath4 . from these curves we estimated @xmath17  k , which attests the excellent quality of the sample , and allows to study the fluctuation - induced magnetization in almost the whole temperature range above @xmath4 .",
    "such a small transition width is in good agreement with the one determined from the resistive transition of crystals with the same composition and grown following the same procedure.@xcite      to measure the effect of superconducting fluctuations above @xmath4 ( which according to the 3d - agl approach , see below , is about @xmath18-@xmath19 emu ) , we used the _ reciprocating sample option_. it produces sinusoidal oscillations of the sample about the center of the detection system and improves the resolution by about two orders of magnitude with respect to the conventional dc option .",
    "data were taken by waiting @xmath20 min for complete stabilization after the temperature was within 0.5% the target temperature .",
    "for each temperature we averaged six measurements consisting of 15 cycles at 1 hz frequency .",

    "the diamagnetism above @xmath4 is unobservable in this scale . ]",
    "an example of the as measured @xmath23 data above @xmath4 is presented in fig .",
    "as may be clearly seen already in this figure , the @xmath23 curves present a _ rounding _ just above @xmath4 ( a factor @xmath20 larger in amplitude when @xmath24 ) , which extends few degrees above @xmath4 . in view of the sharp low - field diamagnetic transition",
    "1 ) such a rounding can not be attributed to @xmath4 inhomogeneities , and is a first evidence of the presence of an anisotropic precursor diamagnetism in these materials . in the detail around @xmath4 presented in figs .",
    "2(b ) and ( c ) , it is clearly seen that the reversible region extends few degrees below @xmath4 , allowing to study the _",
    "critical _ fluctuation regime , where @xmath23 presents a similar anisotropy .",
    "the fluctuation - induced contribution was determined from the as measured @xmath23 by subtracting the _ background _ magnetic moment , @xmath25 , coming from the crystal normal - state and in a much lesser extent from the sample holder ( this last contribution was estimated to be in the 10@xmath26 emu range ) .",
    "such a background contribution was determined by fitting the function @xmath27 to the raw data in the temperature interval between 37 and 50 k ( @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are free parameters ) .",
    "the lower bound corresponds to a temperature above which the fluctuation - induced magnetic moment is expected to be smaller than the experimental uncertainty ( see below ) .",
    "it is worth noting that the use of other plausible functions for @xmath25 , for instance @xmath31 , leads to imperceptible changes in the scale of fig .",
    "in view of the moderate anisotropy observed , the results of fig .  [ backs ] were analyzed in the framework of the 3d - agl approach .",
    "this theory predicts that the fluctuation - induced magnetization for magnetic fields applied perpendicular or parallel to the crystal @xmath3 layers ( @xmath32 or @xmath33 , respectively ) may be obtained from the result for 3d isotropic materials , @xmath34 , through@xcite @xmath35 and @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the superconducting anisotropy factor .",
    "this transformation was introduced by klemm and clem @xcite and generalized by blatter @xcite and by hao and clem @xcite to different observables and different regions in the @xmath38 phase diagram . in particular ,",
    "it was shown to be also valid for the fluctuation region above @xmath4.@xcite for isotropic materials , the fluctuation magnetization above @xmath4 was calculated in ref .   in the framework of a gaussian gl approach including a _ total - energy _ cutoff in the fluctuation spectrum.@xcite by combining that result with eqs .",

    "these expressions are valid in the low magnetic field limit , i.e. , for @xmath47 and , respectively , @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the upper critical field for @xmath13 extrapolated linearly to @xmath50  k. in absence of any cutoff ( i.e. , when @xmath51 ) eq .",

    "of the temperature dependence of the fluctuation magnetization ( over @xmath10 ) for several magnetic fields applied in the two main crystallographic directions .",

    "in this representation we have only included magnetic fields up to 2 t , which are expected to be in the low magnetic field regime except in a narrow temperature interval close to @xmath4 .",

    "the @xmath42 value is well within the ones in htsc , and @xmath37 is just a few times smaller than in yba@xmath2cu@xmath66o@xmath67 .",
    "these similarities contrast with the differences between their precursor diamagnetism ( allegedly unconventional in the htsc).@xcite finally , @xmath42 is much shorter than in the moderately anisotropic 2h - nbse@xmath2 , which could explain the non observation of non - local electrodynamic effects when @xmath13 in the present case.@xcite       ( a ) and @xmath58 ( b ) .",
