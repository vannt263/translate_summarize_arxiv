    "understanding the relationship between agn , which are powered by accretion onto supermassive black holes , and the stellar mass galactic black hole binary systems ( gbhs ) is currently one of the major research areas in high energy astrophysics .",
    "if we can understand the relationship , then we can predict how agn should behave on cosmological time - scales by observing the brighter , and much faster varying , gbhs .",
    "the comparison is complicated by the fact that ( at the risk of some oversimplification ) , gbhs can exist in a number of states , defined originally in terms of their medium energy ( 210 kev ) x - ray properties , particularly : ( i ) the hard spectrum , low - flux ( ` hard ' ) state , ( ii ) the soft spectrum , high flux ( ` soft ' ) state and ( iii ) the ` very high state ' ( vhs - sometimes also described as the high - intermediate state ) where the flux is very high and the spectrum very soft . in general the accretion rate increases as we go from the hard to soft to vhs states .",
    "see @xcite for a comprehensive description of gbh states and behaviour .",
    "the various states have quite distinct x - ray timing properties which may , in fact , provide a more fundamental state discrimator than the spectral properties .",
    "timing is usually quantified in terms of the power spectral densities ( psds ) of the x - ray lightcurves . where significant variability is observed , ` soft ' state psds are characterised by a power law of slope of -1 at low frequencies ( i.e. the power , @xmath0 with @xmath1 ) , breaking to a slope @xmath2 above a characteristic frequency @xmath3 ( or time - scale @xmath4 ) .",
    "hard state and vhs state gbh psds , which are similar to each other , are more complex .",
    "they are best described by the combination of two or more lorentzian - shaped components ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although at low signal to noise they can be approximated by a power law with a second , lower frequency break , approximately 1.5 to 2 decades lower in frequency than the high frequency break .",
    "so far , almost all well observed agn , which are x - ray bright and have moderately high accretion rates , have soft state psds , as we would expect from comparison with gbhs of similar accretion rate ( measured relative to the eddington accretion rate , @xmath5 ) ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however the comparison for the hard and vhs states is largely unknown . until very recently ,",
    "ngc3783 had been suggested to have two breaks in its psd @xcite and so be a hard state agn , although its accretion rate is similar to that of the well observed soft state agn .",
    "however recent work , based on improved data @xcite , has shown that , in fact , ngc3783 is another soft state agn .",
    "if soft states are linked to the accretion disc extending in to very small radii , then perhaps their much cooler accretion discs compared to gbhs may allow the optically thick disc to survive without evaporation to smaller radii .",
    "thus maybe all agn are soft state objects and the comparison with gbhs does not extend to other states ? such a conclusion would have a fundamental impact on our understanding of the accretion process onto black holes and so it is very important to confirm , from timing properties , a definite non - soft state agn .",
    "the only remaining case where there is at least some evidence for a non - soft state psd is . from observations with , evidence for a low frequency break in the psd was presented by @xcite .",
    "evidence for a second break , at high frequencies , was presented by @xcite from analysis of  observations .",
    "@xcite interpreted the combined  and  psd as a hard state psd but did note that the high frequency break does not scale linearly with mass to the hard state of the archtypal gbh cyg x-1 ; the frequency difference is too small .",
    "however as  is one of the highest accretion rate agn known ( @xmath6 , @xcite ) , a vhs state remains a strong possibility .",
    "unfortunately proper modelling of the combined long and short time - scale psd is hampered by the gaps which occur in the  light curves , and hence in the psd , at the orbital period ( @xmath7s ) .",
    "we therefore made a 100 ks continuous observation with  to fill that gap in the psd .",
    "spectral analysis of this  observation has been presented by @xcite and @xcite and cross - spectral analysis ( i.e. lags between energy bands as a function of fourier frequency or time - scale ) has been presented by @xcite .",
    "here we present a full power spectral analysis of the combined ,  and  data and find firm evidence for two breaks in the combined psd .",
    "we also show that the psd can be parameterised as the sum of two lorentzian components .",
    "we note particularly that the highest frequency lorentzian , for which good spectral information is available from both the  and  observations , is stronger at higher energies , exactly as is found for lorentzian components in gbhs .",
    "in gbhs in the hard and vhs states , changes in the lag between bands occur at approximately the time - scales at which the psd changes from one lorentzian component to another , supporting the model that each lorentzian comes from a separate physical emission region . in this paper",
    "we therefore re - examine the lag spectrum and compare it with the psd , to test whether a two - component emission region may apply in  and also as a further diagnostic of the state of the agn .",
    "the paper is arranged as follows : in sec .",
    "[ data ] , we describe the observational data sets which we used and discuss the individual  and  psds in secs  [ s_ascapsd ] and [ s_xmmpsd ] .",
    "we then discuss the joint  and  power spectrum and its energy dependence in sec .",

    "we downloaded sis data from the tartarus database in 0.62 and 210 kev energy bands and produced background subtracted light curves , with average count rates of 2.7 and 0.6 c / s respectively .",
    "the average photon energies of these two bands are 1.18 and 3.2 kev respectively .",
    "the lightcurves , psd and other variability properties of this data set have been studied by e.g. @xcite .",
    "[ [ section-2 ] ]    was observed by  from 2005 january 5 , 19:47 , to 2005 january 6 , 23:16 .",
    "the european photon imaging cameras ( epic ) pn , mos1 and mos2 cameras were all operated in small window mode using a medium filter , as described by @xcite .",
    "the total exposures for the pn and mos cameras were 98.8 ks and 99.1 ks respectively . for the pn camera , we extracted source photons from a @xmath11 region and the background was selected from a source - free region of equal area on the same chip .",
    "only single and double events , with quality flag=0 were retained .",
    "for the mos1 and mos2 cameras , source photons were extracted from a circular region of @xmath12 in radius and single , double , triple and quadruple events were used .",
    "the pn data was free of pile - up , but both mos cameras suffered significant pile - up in the cores of the target psfs .",
    "therefore we discarded data from the central @xmath13 diameter of each mos exposure . the average pn background - subtracted count rate in the 0.210 kev band was @xmath14 c / s .",
    "the background level was low and almost constant throughout the observation .",
    "we produced light curves in the 0.22 and 210 kev energy bands in 48 s bins , and combined the light curves from the different detectors to produce weighted average light curves .",
    "the 0.210  kev lightcurve is shown in fig  [ fig : xmmlc ] ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "as the variability properties normally depend on energy band , we also constructed  light curves from the pn data alone in the 0.52 and 28.8 kev bands , to match the average energies of the  light curves .",
    "we used these lightcurves in all quantitative analyses .",
    "the superposed psds derived from the  210 kev and 0.62 kev data are shown in fig .  [ fig : ascapsds ] .",
    "data below @xmath15hz result from the light curves binned on the orbital time - scale .",

    "note the frequency gap that these data do not cover .",
    "the poisson noise level has been subtracted . on time - scales",
    "longer than the orbital time - scale , the low and high energy psds have a similar normalisation .",
    "however on shorter time - scales the 210 kev psd lies above the 0.62 kev psd , except perhaps at the very highest frequencies ( @xmath17hz ) where the two psds may be converging .",
    "this frequency dependent excess of the high energy psd over the low energy psd both below and above the high frequency break ( @xmath18hz ) , which is different from the behaviour of other well observed agn , ( e.g. ngc4051 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , will be modelled properly in section  [ s_combinedpsd ] .",
    "the  light curves were almost completely continuous except for 5 small gaps of duration 20 - 30 secs each . following the procedure established in @xcite these gaps were filled by linear interpolation , together with the addition of noise characteristic of the surrounding data points , in order to eliminate spurious high frequency power in the power spectrum .",
    "power spectral densities were derived from these light curves using a standard direct fourier transform . in fig .",
    "[ fig : xmm210psds ] we show the 0.22 and 210 kev psds and we see close agreement with the  psds in the same energy bands . as with the  psds ,",
    "the low and high energy  psds coincide very closely at frequencies below @xmath15hz , but at higher frequencies the 210 kev psd exceeds the lower energy psd .",
    "note that here , for the low energy band , we show the 0.22 kev psd rather than the 0.52 kev psd and note that the bump centred around @xmath19hz is even less pronounced in the 0.22 kev band , strengthening our observation that the excess has a strongly energy - dependent shape .",
    "although not shown , the  0.52 kev psd is almost identical to the  0.62 kev psd .",
    "a simple power law fit to both low and high energy psds is a very poor fit , leaving a large residual bump centred around @xmath19hz .",
    "a bending powerlaw , however , which provides a good fit to the high / soft state of cyg x-1 and to the  psds of ngc4051 @xcite and 6 @xcite , is a good fit ( table  [ tab : brpl ] ) . tying the break frequencies to be the same in both energy band psds , we note ( as can also be seen directly from fig .",
    "[ fig : xmm210psds ] ) , that although the slopes above the break are similar in both energy bands , the slope below the break is noticeably flatter at higher energies .",
    "the  psds , although less well defined because of the gap on the orbital time - scales , are quite consistent with the fit parameters given in table  [ tab : brpl ] .",
    "this behaviour is different from that of ngc4051 and mcg-6 - 30 - 15 ( e.g. see table 6 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) where , although the slopes below the break are not very well determined , there is no evidence for a variation with energy . above the break , however , the slope is flatter at higher energies in ngc4051 and mcg-6 - 30 - 15 .",
    "the psd slope variations seen here in  can be more naturally interpreted in terms of a power law ( which is necessary to explain the power at low frequencies ) together with a lorentzian component which is stronger at higher energies .",
    "such a model , in which the power law slope and normalisation , and lorentzian central frequency are tied , provides an equally good fit to the data . in the case of the latter model",
    ", we note that the lorentzian component is approximately three times stronger in the 2 - 8.8 kev than 0.52 kev band ( table  [ tab : lor ] ) .",
    "an increasing lorentzian amplitude at higher energies is also typically observed in qpos and some broad lorentzian components in gbhs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . as the exact values of the fit parameters depend on proper fitting of the lower frequency data from  and we leave further discussion to section  [ s_combinedpsd ] .",
    "there is a residual to the power law plus lorentzian fit to the psd at @xmath20hz",
    ". this residual can be fitted ( using the unbinned data ) by the addition of a second , narrow ( width @xmath21hz ) , lorentzian with normalisation approximately half that of the broad lorentzian .",
    "the fit is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : xmm2lor ] . the fit is improved but , adjusting the f - test probabilities to take account of the fact that the line could have appeared in any of the available frequency bins , we find that the improvement is significant only at the 90% confidence level .

    "the  data , which covers time - scales from @xmath22 years to 3 hours , has already been analyzed by @xcite and , including further data , by @xcite who both fit a breaking power law model to the psd .",
    "@xcite derive a slope at the lowest frequencies @xmath23 of @xmath24 , a break frequency , @xmath25hz and an intermediate slope above the break of @xmath26 .",
    "the earlier results of @xcite are consistent with these values .",
    "we begin by refitting these data using our standard simulation - based modelling method ( e.g. see * ? ? ?",
    "we fit a simple bending power law model ( e.g. see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we bin the long time - scale  light curve into 4-d bins , and the short time - scale  light curve into 3-h bins .",
    "the resultant best - fitting values are similar to those of @xcite and the errors in the fit parameters are similarly large . as our value of @xmath23",
    "is quite consistent with zero and as , in both their hard and very high states , gbhs have @xmath27 , we fix @xmath27 in subsequent power law fits .",
    "we then fit the combined ,  and  data sets with a doubly bending power law model , including a second , higher frequency break at @xmath28 and slope @xmath29 at the highest frequencies .",
    "we include the  210 kev sis data in 512s bins and the  pn data in 48s bins in the 28.8 kev band to match the average energy of the  band .",
    "the pn bin value was chosen so that the resultant light curve has @xmath30 points so that we can use the fast fourier transform , rather than the slower direct fourier transform , for that part of the simulation , without loss of accuracy .",
    "we obtain a very good fit ( acceptance probability p=75% - see table  [ tab:2lor ] and fig .  [ bendingpsd ] ) with @xmath31 , @xmath32hz and @xmath33 hz .",
    "these break frequencies are in good agreement with the values obtained by @xcite from analysis of  data .    in order to make a combined psd fit of the soft x - ray band , we first compared the low frequency variability power of the  sis data in the 0.62 and 210 kev bands .",
    "the resultant power spectra showed identical amplitudes , so both energy bands can be fit together at low frequencies without needing to rescale their psds .",
    "we assume that the close similarity of the 0.62 and 210 kev lightcurves continues to even lower frequencies , i.e. those sampled by the  long term data .",
    "we therefore fitted the  210 kev long term data together with the sis and 0.62 kev data to cover the same frequency range as above .",
    "the fit is again very good ( p=85% - table  [ tab:2lor ] ) giving parameters @xmath34 , @xmath35 hz and @xmath36 hz . the steeper intermediate slope reflects the lower high - frequency power in the soft band compared to the hard band .",
    "the break frequencies in both bands are consistent within 1 @xmath37 uncertainties , as can be seen from the confidence contours plotted in fig .",
    "[ dbknpo_contour ]      motivated by the strong evidence for a lorentzian component in the  data alone , we have fitted the combined ,  and  data with a model consisting of two lorentzian components ,    @xmath38    where the lorentzian peak frequency @xmath39 is related to the centroid frequency @xmath40 by @xmath41 and the subscripts l and h refer to the low and high frequency components , respectively .",
    "we fitted the combined psd in soft and hard energy bands independently , allowing all parameters to vary .",
    "the low frequency component converged to very low values of the quality factor @xmath42 , i.e. to very wide lorentzians where the lorentizan shape is almost insensitive to the value of @xmath43 .",
    "we therefore fixed this parameter at @xmath44 ( with 90% and 99% upper confidence limits of @xmath45 and 0.5 respectively ) for both energy bands to enable a more detailed parameter grid search for the other parameters , and hence to obtain better constraints on these parameters .",
    "the best - fitting values are listed in table  [ tab:2lor ] .",
    "the lorentzian peak frequencies are similar to , but not exactly the same as , the corresponding break frequencies , with the lorentzian frequencies lying closer to the centre of the band - limited power .    figures  [ hardpsd ] and [ softpsd ] show the best - fitting two - lorentzian models to the hard and soft band respectively . in this interpretation ,",
    "the increase in variability power at high frequencies in the hard band is entirely due to the greater strength of the high frequency lorentzian in this band .",
    "the peak frequencies in both energy bands are consistent within the 90% confidence limits ( see contour plot in fig.[2lor_contour ] ) .",
    "note that figs .",
    "[ hardpsd ] and [ softpsd ] show the psd unfolded through the distortions produced by sampling effects .",
    "these distortions also depend on the underlying psd shape so the resultant unfolded psd depends on the model being fitted .",
    "if the two - lorentzian model is the correct underlying psd , the strong power component around @xmath46hz will lead to spurious apparent power at lower frequencies in a psd which has not been unfolded from the distortions , and where the low frequency part of the psd has been derived from observations which do not sample the @xmath46hz region .",
    "this effect is known as aliasing ( e.g. see * ? ? ? * for more details ) and here particularly affects the long timescale  data ( blue crosses in figs  [ bendingpsd ] ,  [ hardpsd ] and [ softpsd ] ) .",
    "when we unfold the psd we remove this spurious low frequency power .",
    "thus the lowest frequency part of the psds in figs .",
    "[ hardpsd ] and [ softpsd ] lies below the same part in the bending power law model ( fig.[bendingpsd ] ) , where the model did not contain so much power at higher frequencies .",
    "therefore the low break frequency in fig .",
    "[ bendingpsd ] is lower than in figs .",
    "[ hardpsd ] and [ softpsd ] .",
    "since the normalisations of low and high - frequency lorentzians are highly correlated with each other and with the lorentzian frequency , we only treat the ratio of the low and high - frequency lorentzian normalisations , @xmath47 , as a free parameter and do not fit the high and low - frequency normalisations separately . although the 1-dimensional errors quoted in table  3 seem to indicate that the normalisation ratios for the hard and soft band overlap , we show in fig .  [ relnormcon ] that the 90% confidence contours of @xmath48 versus @xmath47 do not overlap .",
    "therefore , for the same @xmath49 , the high - frequency lorentzian is always relatively stronger , compared to the low - frequency lorentzian , in the hard band than in the soft band .",
    "in fact , the low - frequency lorentzian normalisation is similar in both bands and relatively well - constrained . for the best fitting model parameters , the values of fractional rms in the low frequency lorentzian are @xmath50% and @xmath51% in hard and soft bands respectively , and in the high frequency lorentzian the values are @xmath52% and @xmath53% in hard and soft bands .",
    "thus the low frequency lorentzian rms values are consistent with being the same , while the high frequency lorenztian is weaker in the soft band , which explains the different hard and soft band psd shapes at high frequencies .",

    "this extreme case never occurs in the present data , so the coherence can remain over 50 % even if the lorentzians are uncorrelated .",
    "the relative contribution of the lorentzians to each energy bands is most different at frequencies @xmath127 hz , where both lorentzians have similar power in the hard band ( figs.[hardpsd ] and [ softpsd ] ) , but the high - frequency lorentzian is 10 times stronger than the low frequency component in the soft band . in this case",
    ", the coherence is expected to drop to @xmath128 , as measured by @xcite ( their figure 3 ) .",
    "it is possible that the low - frequency variability component that we fit to the psd as a very broad lorentzian actually contains more components .",
    "the available data , however , are not good enough to disentagle extra components in the low frequency psd . unfortunately the lag spectrum can not help in this case as the long term monitoring was performed only by , which has a hard energy response .",
    "we are therefore unable to compute a lag spectrum between hard and soft bands as we have been able to on intermediate and short time - scales .",
    "we have fitted the psd of  over the @xmath129 hz frequency range , combining long term archival  monitoring data , a month - long observation by  covering intermediate frequencies and a new 100 ks observation by  which covers the shortest time - scales .",
    "we confirm the existence of two breaks in the psd , which make this the only agn so far observed to have band - limited variability .    the psd can be fitted either with a double - bending power law , where the variability power drops at low and high frequencies , or with a combination of two distinct variability components , peaking close to the low and high frequency breaks , respectively . using two lorentzian - shaped components",
    ", we obtain a good fit in both the soft 0.52 and hard 210 kev bands , with self - consistent lorentzian parameters between the energy bands .",
    "we note that , when fitting the upper break in the psd , the frequency of the fitted lorentzian is a factor of 4 lower than the fitted bend frequency as , in any band - limited psd , the lorentzian fits will tend to move towards the centre of the band . this difference should be considered when combining values of psd break timescales derived from different fitting methods . in the lorentzian interpretation of the psd , the increase in variability power at high frequencies in the hard band is explained by a strengthening of the high frequency lorentzian , as is seen in gbhs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while the low frequency lorentzian remains approximately at the same level .    the two - component interpretation is strongly supported by the lag spectrum calculated between these energy bands using  and  data ( arvalo et al .",
    "the lag spectrum has a step - like shape , where the time lags are approximately constant at low frequencies and drop sharply to a different constant value at around @xmath15 hz .",
    "the drop in the lag spectrum occurs exactly at the frequency expected if each lorentzian component has a single time lag value associated with it .",
    "this characteristic lag spectral shape therefore provides strong evidence that the different lorentzian components in the psd arise from distinct physical regions , e.g. different radii in the accretion disc .",
    "the lag spectrum of ark  564 has a very similar shape to that of cyg x-1 in its intermediate state ( see figure 8 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although the frequencies are , of course , very different .",
    "however our recent 3d fit @xcite shows that psd break frequencies scale not only inversely with black hole mass , @xmath130 , but also approximately with @xmath5 . if we apply the same scaling to the lag frequencies , then ark  564 and cyg x-1 in its intermediate state coincide almost exactly .",
    "ark  564 was included in our 3d fit , using the value of @xmath4 given by @xcite , and lay close to the best - fitting plane .",
    "the better measured value of @xmath4 which we derive here , on the assumption of a bending power law , is identical to the value of @xmath4 given by @xcite thus ark  564 remains consistent with our previous scaling relationship .",
    "all previous studies of the scaling between agn and gbhs have concentrated on the high frequency part of the psds as the ( scaled ) low frequency part of most agn psds is not well measured .",
    "on the basis of just one agn where we are able to fit a low frequency lorentzian component we are therefore extremely cautious in any comparison , and we also note that intermediate state gbh psds show many and varied shapes where the separation between high and low frequency lorentzians is not constant ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however the separation of approximately 1.5 decades in frequency between the two lorentzians seen here is not wildly different from typical separations seen in intermediate state gbhs .",
    "thus some sort of mass ( and probably also accretion rate ) related scaling probably applies to the lower , as well as to the upper , psd frequencies .",
    "the psd and lag spectrum indicate a vhs / intermediate state , rather than a soft state , with a hard state being ruled out because of the very high accretion rate .",
    "is this state classification consistent with other state measures , e.g. radio luminosity ?",
    "vhs / intermediate state gbhs can be quite luminous , although transient , radio sources ( e.g. grs1915 + 105 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) whilst soft state gbhs are undetected in deep radio observations .",
    "ark  564 ( black hole mass @xmath131 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is considerably more radio luminous than agn with well defined soft - state psds and similar black hole masses , e.g. ngc4051 ( @xmath132 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and mcg-6 - 30 - 15 ( @xmath133 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . both ngc4051 ( et al . in preparation",
    "; see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and @xcite contain flat spectrum vlbi cores for which @xmath134 ( assuming redshift - derived distances ) .",
    "these observations are certainly consistent with a vhs / intermediate state interpretation for ark  564 although the present lack of radio detection of soft state gbhs prevents a more quantitative comparison .",
    "if the same disc - jet coupling applies in ngc4051 and ark  564 and the radio luminosity of the jet scales as @xmath135 ( absolute , not eddington , units ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , then we would expect @xmath136 ( deriving @xmath137 from * ? ? ?",
    "thus it is not yet clear whether the higher radio luminosity of ark  564 relative to ngc4051 is purely due to a higher accretion rate or to some difference in jet structure .",
    "if we take the lorentzian peak frequency ( @xmath138 hz , i.e. 1666s , in the 28.8 kev band ) as being the best measurement of the underlying physical process responsible for the sharp drop in power , we can consider what that timescale might correspond to .",
    "the dynamical time - scale around the ark  564 black hole ( @xmath139 ) is considerably shorter than the lorentzian peak time - scale , unless we assume that the time - scale arises far ( few tens of @xmath140 ) from the black hole .",
    "there is evidence from the broad iron x - ray flourescence lines @xcite that the accretion disc often reaches down to @xmath141 , close to the innermost stable orbit of a maximally spinning black hole black hole .",
    "if the lorentzian peak time - scale arises from the inner edge of such a spinning black hole disc , it may well correspond to the viscous time - scale ( assuming a viscosity parameter , @xmath142 ) . in that case",
    "the ratio of disc scale height to radius , @xmath143 , = 1.2 , which is reasonable given the very high accretion rate .",
    "a possible interpretation of both the psd and lag spectrum is that the variability originates mainly in two distinct regions .",
    "note that by ` variability ' we mean the source of the variations , not the source of the x - rays .",
    "the variability may be related to accretion rate fluctuations in the accretion disc .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that variability time - scales are larger at larger radii ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "once produced , variations would then propagate inwards and , on reaching the x - ray emitting region , would modulate the emission .",
    "it is also reasonable to assume that the emitted energy spectrum becomes harder towards smaller radii so , for example , the bulk of the 0.52 kev emission will be emitted from a larger radius than the bulk of the 210 kev emission .",
    "if the region responsible for most of the variability at low frequencies lies outside all of the x - ray emitting region , then the time lag between the soft and hard bands may represent the time taken for the fluctuations to propagate from the ` soft ' to ` hard ' emission region ( e.g. see @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "if all of the frequencies in the low frequency variability component are produced in the same region , for example a narrow annulus of the disc , then all of those frequencies will have the same soft - hard lag .",
    "if the source of the higher frequency variations lies within the x - ray emission region , e.g. between the soft and hard emission regions , then the high frequency variations will affect only the harder emission region and the resultant x - ray variations will be stronger at higher energies , as we observe . in this scenario",
    "the predominantly softer , outer emission region , which is subject only to the slower variations , may form part , or possibly all , of the so - called ` soft excess ' , i.e. the excess in the energy spectrum below @xmath144kev above an extrapolation of a power law to low energies .",
    "this softer region , although lying outside the harder emitting region is , however , probably still quite close ( ie within @xmath145 rather than @xmath146 ) to the black hole .",
    "this scenario is consistent with the observations of @xcite and @xcite of ark 564 .",
    "@xcite show that , on @xmath147 day time - scales , the soft excess emission from ark  564 varies at least as much as the power law emission .",
    "@xcite show , by fitting a combination of bremsstrahlung ( not necessarily a physical bremsstrahlung component but simply to fit the ` soft excess ' ) and power law components to 500s sections of the  data discussed here , that the ` bremsstrahlung ' component at low energies ( 0.31 kev ) is less variable than the power law component in the same band , and that the power law component at higher energies ( 310 kev ) is more variable still .",
    "however a full understanding of how the soft excess is related to the rest of the x - ray emission , e.g. whether it might actually be caused by absorption @xcite requires detailed frequency - resolved spectroscopy ( e.g. see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for which the present data are insufficient .",
    "we finally comment on the negative phase lag , @xmath148s , at the highest observable frequencies .",
    "as the high frequency x - ray variations at lower energies will also be produced at small radii , e.g. as the low energy tail of the harder emission region , there should be very little lag between the soft and hard emission , as we see .",
    "however the lag is negative , i.e. the hard band leads , in the higher frequency component .",
    "this observation suggests that the high - frequency variability in the soft band might arise from reflection / reprocessing within @xmath149 of the illuminating hard x - ray source , implying the existence of cold gas close to the central x - ray source .",
