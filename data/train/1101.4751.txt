    "the simulation of the strongly correlated many - body systems described by bose - hubbard model has received great advances in optical lattices@xcite and coupled - cavity systems@xcite .",
    "both of them depend on the competition between the local interaction and the nonlocal tunneling , but there are also some differences for this two basic models . in optical lattices ,",
    "the quantum phase transitions ( qpt ) in a gas of ultracold atoms with periodic potentials is described by the bose - hubbard model with on site two atoms interacting and hopping between the adjacent sites . however , in the coupled - cavity systems , two types of particles are involved to study the many - body dynamics and its realization relays on the strong light - matter coupling regime .",
    "therefore , the qpt is due to the transferring of the excitations from polaritonic to photonic rather than purely bosonic or purely fermionic entities .",
    "however , the realization of the strong coupling in experiment is the greatest bottleneck for the qpt manipulated in coupled - cavity system . to be optimistic , with the progress in the realization of strong light - matter coupling regime in both atomic@xcite and solid - state@xcite cavity quantum electrodynamics devices with single two - level emitters in high - q resonators , the qpt for coupled - cavity arrays of jaynes - cummings(jc ) model systems and its variants attracts more and more attentions .",
    "subsequent works that deal with coupled nonlinear cavities arrays have addressed the dynamics in the two coupled cavities for its great freedom and flexibility , which can provides a convenience controllable platform for engineering the transport of quantum states via photonic processes and the exact numerical solutions can be easily found and then some analytical approximations can be used . only very recently the investigation of such systems of two coupled cavities has begun . the quantum states",
    "transfers@xcite , the atomic state transfer@xcite , the quantum phase gates@xcite , the bipartite entanglement entropies@xcite , the one - excitation dynamics@xcite , the photon correlations@xcite , the time evolution of the population imbalance@xcite , the photonic tunneling effect@xcite and the emission characteristics@xcite have been studied .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , most of the previous works focused on this system are limited to the single atom - cavity interactions without consideration of an additional interatomic coupling . with the advances of the technology , the interatomic dipole - dipole interaction may be realized in several solid - state systems , such as an ensemble of quantum dots@xcite and bose - einstein condensates  @xcite . at present , the stationary entanglement@xcite and qpt@xcite for dipole - coupled two - level atoms in single - mode cavity have been investigated theoretically .",
    "then an investigation of the qpt to the system of two coupled cavities with dipole - dipole interaction is also of considerable significance and highly called for .",
    "the previous work@xcite has identified some of the unique features of qpt in the coupled two - site jc model .",
    "the nature of the ground states for the system can be divided into four types corresponding to different parameter values of atom - field detunings and cavity - cavity hopping strengths .",
    "differing from the bose - hubbard model , the insulator state may be either atomic or polaritonic , while the superfluid state may be photonic or polaritonic in nature . in this paper , we extend the work@xcite to each cavity containing two dipole - coupled atoms .",
    "we find that in the presence of weak cavity - cavity coupling , the effective on - site repulsion not only attributes to the atom - photon interaction and the detuning , but also depends on the interatomic dipole - coupled strength .",
    "so the atomic dipole - dipole interaction provides an additional parameter , and more importantly , richer physics for the system .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we first describe the model under consideration and then simplify it to an effective form , with reformed atomic energy and atom - field coupling strength .",
    "we then address the nature of the ground state of the system under a wide range of detuning and dipole coupling strengths .",
    "thirdly , we discuss the quantum phase transitions of the system by choosing three different  order parameters \" .",
    "we finally present our conclusions .",
    "the system under consideration consists of two identical single - mode cavities with each cavity containing two coupled two - level atoms through dipole - dipole interaction .",
    "the two cavities are coupled by hopping strength @xmath0 , therefore the photons may hop between them .",
    "besides , the model is ideal without taking into account the dissipation induced by atomic spontaneous emission and photonic escape from the cavities .",
    "in such a case , the hamiltonian for the coupled two - cavity system is given by @xmath1 @xmath2\\nonumber\\\\ & + & j(\\sigma_{1}^{\\dag}\\sigma_{2}+\\sigma_{1}\\sigma_{2}^{\\dag}),\\nonumber\\\\ h_{2}&=&\\omega_{c}a^{\\dagger}_{2}a_{2}+\\sum_{j=3,4}[\\omega_{a}\\sigma_{j}^{\\dag}\\sigma_{j}+g(a^{\\dagger}_{2}\\sigma_{j}+a_{2}\\sigma_{j}^{\\dag})]\\nonumber\\\\ & + & j(\\sigma_{3}^{\\dag}\\sigma_{4}+\\sigma_{3}\\sigma_{4}^{\\dag}),\\nonumber\\\\ h_{12}&=&a(a^{\\dagger}_{1}a_{2}+a_{1}a^{\\dagger}_{2}),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the resonance frequencies for atoms and cavities , respectively .",
    "supposing the same atom - field coupling strength in the system , it is defined by an uniform parameter @xmath5 .",
    "@xmath6 and @xmath7 are the creation and annihilation operators of the field in cavity @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) . @xmath10 and @xmath11 represent the atomic raising and lowering operators of the atom @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) . for static atoms , the coherent dipole - dipole interaction between them can be given by @xmath14 where , @xmath15=@xmath16 is the distance between the two atoms located at @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "@xmath19 is the angle between @xmath15 and the atomic dipole moment @xmath20 . here",
    ", we assume the dipole moments of the two atoms are parallel to each other and are polarized in the direction perpendicular to the interatomic axis .",
    "then , @xmath21 can be simplified as @xmath22 and its strength can be adjusted by changing the positions of the two atoms in each cavity . @xmath23 and",
    "@xmath24 show the atom - field interaction and the atom - atom coupling in each site , respectively .",
    "the cavity - cavity coupling is depicted by @xmath25 .",
    "the total excitation for the hamiltonian @xmath26 can be defined as @xmath27 .",
    "we assume the total number of excitations @xmath28 is conserved and exactly two excitations in the system .",

    "are denoted by two fictitious atoms .",
    "only one of them couples to the field mode with frequencies @xmath32 , but the other atom freely evolves decoupling from the field .",
    "the effective coupling strength also changes from @xmath5 to @xmath33 . in this paper , we pay our attention to the strong atom - cavity coupling regime which can be put into practice only when @xmath34 . on this condition , the eigenstates of the individual cavity should be expressed by the dressed states latexmath:[\\ ] ]    to illustrate the behavior of the ground state operating in the dipole - dipole interaction , we first pay our attention to the resonant condition @xmath50 , and three cases for @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 will be discussed in the following .    at @xmath56",
    ", there is a large energy gap between @xmath42 and @xmath43 due to the photon blockade effect , for which the presence of one photon in the cavity blocks the entering of the subsequent photons . on this condition ,",
    "the ground state of the system is approximately @xmath59 , as shown in fig.2 .",
    "moreover , @xmath60 is nearly the maximal entanglement state of atom and field . for this state , only one excitation in each cavity with almost equal probabilities for atomic and field excitations .",
    "this can also be confirmed from the inset of fig.2 .",
    "thus the ground state is a polaritonic insulatorlike state , which is analogous to the mott insulator state in the bose - hubbard model .    , the detuning between atom and field is @xmath50 , and the atom - atom coupling strength is @xmath61 . , scaledwidth=50.0% ]     versus dipole coupling strength @xmath21 at @xmath50 .",
    "the hopping strength between the two cavities is weak for @xmath62 .",
    ", scaledwidth=50.0% ]    , @xmath63 and @xmath52 .",
    ", scaledwidth=50.0% ]     and @xmath64 .",
    "other parameter value is @xmath51 .",
    ", scaledwidth=50.0% ]     and @xmath64 .",
    "other parameter value is @xmath61 .",
    ", scaledwidth=50.0% ]    compared to fig.2 , figure 3 indicates a more different behavior for @xmath57 . besides @xmath42 , the subspace @xmath43 is also occupied for the ground state of the system . from its inset",
    ", we find that both the atom and the field are excited , indicating a polaritonic superfluidlike state .    when @xmath58 , the ground state occupies the subspaces @xmath42 and @xmath43 with almost same probabilities , as represented in fig.4 .",
    "however , only the photons are excited in this state .",
    "this is because , in this limit , @xmath65 , so the ground state is a delocalized photon state in nature .",
    "the state of this form is a photonic superfluidlike state .",
    "the results can be understood easily .",
    "similar to the effect of detuning in ref.@xcite , at @xmath50 , the energy gap of @xmath66 is a monotonic decreasing function of @xmath21 , see fig.5 . with the increase of @xmath21 ,",
    "the photon blockade effect is destroyed , leading to an increase of the occupied probability of @xmath43 . when @xmath67 , @xmath66 is almost zero , so the subspaces @xmath42 and @xmath43 nearly degenerate .",
    "oppositely , @xmath68 is a monotonic increasing function of @xmath21 with a large initial value .",
    "thus , the subspace @xmath44 can not be occupied .",
    "next , we discuss the case of large positive detuning . at @xmath50 , the nature of the ground state changes with different values of @xmath21 .",
    "when @xmath69 , no matter what value of @xmath21 , the energy gap of @xmath66 is always zero . while @xmath68 is a monotonic increasing function of @xmath70 .",
    "even @xmath71 , the energy gap @xmath68 is very large .",
    "therefore , the ground state has equal occupation probabilities in the subspaces @xmath42 and @xmath43 , but zero probability in other subspaces .",
    "more interestingly , in the large positive detuning limit , the superposition coefficients of the dressed states in eq.(5 ) have particular values , @xmath72@xmath73 and @xmath74@xmath75 .",
    "then , @xmath76 .",
    "consequently , not only the constitution of the ground state but also its nature is fixed . in fig.6",
    ", the inset shows that the excitation is photonic rather than atomic .",
    "this is because the energy of the atoms is larger than that of the photons when @xmath77 .",
    "analogous to the situation shown in fig.4 , the ground state indicates photonic superfluidlike nature .    at @xmath78 ,",
    "the energy of atoms is smaller than that of photons . in the limit of @xmath79 , we find @xmath80 , the ground state is approximate @xmath59 . in this condition ,",
    "@xmath72@xmath75 and @xmath74@xmath73 .",
    "thus , @xmath81 , the excitation is almost atomic rather than photonic , standing for an atomic insulatorlike state .",
    "the result is illustrated in fig.7 .",
    "however , when @xmath21 approaches to the value of @xmath82 , the value of @xmath83 decreases .",
    "that is , the energy difference between atom and photon is less and less . as a result , the photonic and atomic excitations coexist , as shown in fig.8 , corresponding to the polaritonic insulatorlike state .",
    "the phase diagrams of these states can be distinguished using the corresponding  order parameters \" . in superfluid states ,",
    "the excitations in each cavity is uncertain , resulting in a nonzero variance of the total excitation number @xmath84 .",
    "oppositely , in the insulator state the number of excitations per cavity is constant and thus has zero variance .",
    "however , the insulator state may be either atomic or polaritonic and the superfluid state may be photonic or polaritonic in nature . to determine the allowed types of particles involved in the state , the atomic excitation number variance @xmath85 should be taken as the  order parameter \" .",
    "@xmath86 is corresponding to the atomic insulator state or the photonic superfluid state , while @xmath87 revealing the polaritonic nature .",
    "only when @xmath88 , it shows the polaritonic superfluid characteristic for the ground state of the system .",

    "@xmath90 in fig.9 , @xmath84 is plotted under a wide range values of the atom - cavity detunings @xmath54 and the dipole - dipole interaction strength @xmath21 .",
    "it is apparent that the phase diagram is divided into two sections .",
    "the insulator region is under the boundary where @xmath78 while above the boundary is the superfluid region .",
    "there is also an area which is symmetric to the insulator area , where the @xmath91 with a maximum value 0.5 , indicating a most evident superfluidity .    to find out the polaritonic area",
    ", we should introduce the second  order parameters \" @xmath85 , where @xmath92 in fig.10 , we find that the polaritonic area approximately spreads at both sides of the line @xmath93 .",
    "the more closer to the line the more obvious the polaritonic nature .",
    "when @xmath93 , @xmath94 , it is the conditions for photon blockade effect obviously .",
    "then the ground state only occupies the subspace @xmath42 , with @xmath95 , standing for a maximal entanglement state of the atom and the field .",
    "so the ground state indicates polaritonic insulatorlike nature .",
    "so far we may guess that on the bases of what are embodied in fig.9 and fig.10 , there must be some overlapped areas in the two figures . in fig.11 , the product of @xmath84 and @xmath96 is shown as a contour plot .",
    "we can clearly identify that there is an area not only in the superfluid region in fig.9 , but also in the polaritonic area in fig.10 , representing polaritonic superfluidlike characters .",
    "then it is obvious that the phase space in fig.9 is divided into four sections , from left bottom to top right corner , in order of atomic insulatorlike region , polaritonic insulatorlike region , polaritonic superfluidlike region and photonic superfluidlike region .",
    "in summary , we have investigated the qpt of a system composed of two coupled cavities , each containing a pair of two - level atoms with dipole - dipole interaction . in the conditions of fixed cavity - cavity interaction and atom - cavity coupling strength , the nature of the ground state",
    "is dependent on the constituents of the dressed states in each cavity and the occupation probabilities of the ground state in the five subspaces .",
    "moreover , both of them attribute to the dipole - dipole interaction strength between the localized atoms and the atom - field detuning in each cavity . by choosing three different order parameters",
    ", we found that the ground state of the system represented more richer behaviors than the bose - hubbard model .",
    "four types of states are revealed , which divide the phase space into four regions .",
    "they are the atomic insulatorlike state , the polaritonic insulatorlike state , the polaritonic superfluidlike state and the photonic superfluidlike state . in the scope of parameter values we taken in this paper , the insulator or superfluid phases",
    "is determined by the combinative effect of @xmath54 and @xmath21 , that is the value of @xmath70 .",
    "small negative values of it is in favour of polaritonic insulatorlike states while for small positive value of it embodies polaritonic superfluidlike state .",
    "the more larger negative value of @xmath70 , the more obvious of atomic insulatorlike nature , and oppositely it shows photonic superfluidlike nature .",
