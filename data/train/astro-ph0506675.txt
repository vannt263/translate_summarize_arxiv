    "brown dwarfs are defined as objects that have less than the minimum mass required for stable hydrogen fusion . in the absence of rotation and for solar metallicity",
    "this mass , referred to as the hydrogen - burning limit , is 0.075 m@xmath1 or 79 m@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "young brown dwarfs are fully convective with photospheric temperatures comparable to m stars . in the models of @xcite 2 myr old proto - brown dwarfs of masses 0.020 m@xmath1 up to the hydrogen - burning limit have temperatures between 2500 k and 2900 k , corresponding to spectral types of m8.5 to m6 @xcite .",
    "the presence of a circumstellar disk in combination with the ability of fully convective objects to generate significant magnetic fields should result in young brown dwarfs exhibiting classical t tauri behavior @xcite .",
    "the young brown dwarfs in this paper are found as isolated objects within the orion ob1 star formation region .",
    "distances and inferred ages of the orion ob1a , b , c , and d subassociations are given in table [ tbl - oriob1 ] ( from @xcite ) .",
    "there are two possible scenarios for brown dwarf formation : ( 1 ) individual formation out of isolated low - mass molecular cores , just as stars are presumed to form from higher - massed cores , and ( 2 ) ejection of the lowest massed objects from a cluster though dynamical interactions . in the latter scenario , objects are ejected before accreting enough material to grow into stars , thereby forming brown dwarfs @xcite .",
    "consequences of the ejection process include a broader spatial distribution , increased velocity dispersion for the lower massed objects , and a truncation of the circumstellar disk via tidal forces .",
    "the ejection velocity dispersion is of order 5 km / sec corresponding to a dispersion in proper motion of 2.6 mas / yr at the 400 pc distance of orion .",
    "models of the ejection process @xcite predict that the disk will be truncated to an outer radius of 10 au or less , resulting in disk lifetimes of less than 1 myr . in order to differentiate the star - like and ejection formation scenarios we examine observational signatures , such as classical t tauri behavior , that are due to the presence of a circumstellar disk .",
    "t tauri variables were originally identified by @xcite as a class of irregular variable stars exhibiting marked changes in brightness and color on timescales of hours to days .",
    "these changes are greatest in the blue and ultraviolet @xcite , and are expected to be related to disk accretion .",
    "magnetospheric accretion models @xcite predict that the inner circumstellar disk is truncated by the magnetic field of the star . for accretion to occur",
    "the truncation must be at or within the keplerian co - rotation radius , at which the orbital period of the disk matches that of the star s rotation .",
    "disrupted disk material flows towards the star in accretion columns that follow the magnetic field lines connecting the inner edge of the disk with the high latitude regions of the star . as evidenced by the broad velocity profiles observed in h@xmath3 and other spectral features , much of the permitted line emission arises in these columns .",
    "other emission lines , including he i and the broad component of the ca ii ir triplet , plus the veiling blue and ultraviolet continua arise in the high temperature shock fronts at the base of the accretion columns near the stellar surface @xcite .",
    "the lifetime of the classical t tauri phase is thought to be 1 to 10 myr @xcite .",
    "protostellar magnetospheric accretion is one of a dynamic process characterized by intricate magnetic field topologies and unstable field - disk interactions .",
    "detailed mhd computations by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite indicate that even for the idealized case of a dipole field aligned with the stellar rotation axis the accretion process is fundamentally unstable .",
    "an intensive photometric and spectroscopic campaign targeting the nearly edge - on classical t tauri aa tau by @xcite shows clear evidence for large scale instabilities developing in t tauri magnetospheres as the magnetic field lines are twisted by differential rotation between the star and the inner disk .",
    "observational support of magnetospheric accretion in aa tau includes time delays between the h@xmath3 , h@xmath4 , he ii line emission and the accretion shock generated emission consistent with free - fall from @xmath58 stellar radii and the presence of two rotationally modulated hot spots .",
    "there has been considerable effort over recent years to observe and characterize the formation processes in young very low mass stars and brown stars .",
    "this has included analyses of spectroscopic signatures of accretion , veiling measurements , variability studies , and ir searches for circum(sub)stellar disk emission .",
    "h@xmath3 emission lines with widths in excess of 200 km / s have been detected in young brown dwarfs having masses as low as @xmath5 20 m@xmath2 in many star formation regions including ic 348 , taurus , chamaeleon i , upper scorpius , and @xmath6 oph @xcite . the mass accretion rate appears to scale roughly as @xmath7 which is steeper than the linear relation inferred by @xcite based on studies in taurus - auriga .",
    "in addition , the uncertainties in the determination of stellar parameters ( mass , radius ) from evolutionary models of very low mass objects @xcite during first few myr contribute another source of uncertainty in these relations .",
    "however , @xcite propose that the accretion rate is controlled by accretion from the surrounding gas in the star formation region rather than from the disk evolution .",
    "the resulting bondi - hoyle accretion model yields trends consistent with the @xcite relation although the validity of this hypothesis needs to be checked through detailed observations and simulations .",
    "@xcite find that the mass accretion rate scales exponentially with the width of the h@xmath3 line measured at the 10% intensity level by comparing previous results in the substellar domain ( @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) with observations in chamaeleon i and @xmath6 oph and study of classical t tauri stars@xcite .",
    "the lowest detected accretion rates are on the order of @xmath8 m@xmath1/yr .",

    ".    accretion shock models for very low mass stars @xcite suggest that accretion rates as low as @xmath14 m@xmath1/yr would be detectable in the johnson v band against an m6 photosphere .",
    "we expect a greater sensitivity to accretion rates when working in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) @xmath0 band due to increased brightness contrast between the shock and the photosphere .",
    "optical photometric variability of low mass pre - main sequence stars is the result of four physical effects .",
    "these are rotational modulation of cool spots , rotational modulation of hot spots formed at the base of magnetospheric accretion columns , instabilities in the mass accretion rate , and flaring .",
    "the study by @xcite finds three distinct patterns of variability in weak - lined t tauris ( wtts ) and classical t tauris ( ctts ) .",
    "the type i variables are characterized by low amplitude multi - band fluctuations on timescales of @xmath15 to 18 days .",
    "this behavior is primarily seen in wtts but can been detected in some wtts .",
    "the second type of variation only occurs in the ctts and is marked by ireegular high amplitude brightness changes , especially in the near ultraviolet and the blue , on timescales as short as a few hours .",
    "the type iii variations , like the type ii , are irregular but occur on much longer timescales of days to weeks .",
    "this last category are only seen in pre - main sequence stars having early spectral types ( ao to k1 ) .",
    "type i variations are believed due to rotational modulation of cool spots on the stellar surface .",
    "these spots are a consequence of the magnetic activity and can persist for over 100 rotational periods yielding periodic variations in @xmath16 . flaring is often seen in the @xmath17 and especially @xmath18 bands .",
    "wtts only exhibit type i variations .",
    "when magnetospheric accretion is present , i.e. in the ctts stage , then type ii variations are seen .",
    "these are due to a combination of rotational modulation of the accretion hot spots together with short period fluctuations in the mass accretion rate . in most cases",
    "the variations in the accretion mask the rotation signature . @xcite",
    "also identify a third class ( type iii ) variables such as ry tau and su aur that exhibit large non - periodic variation in the @xmath19 band but do not show significant veiling .",
    "this behavior is thought to be caused by variable obscuration but is also limited to intermediate and high - mass stars ( spectral types a0 to k1 ) ; we do not expect to find type iii variables in our low - mass sample .    in this sample of intermediate and low mass",
    "t tauris @xcite find that the maximum amplitudes seen in type i variables are 0.8 magnitudes in @xmath19 and 0.5 magnitudes in @xmath20 for v410 tau ( spt = k3 ) .",
    "for the type i variables of spectral type m0 and later the @xmath19 band amplitudes are typically less than 0.3 magnitudes .    variability studies of young very low mass stars and brown dwarfs have primarily used the longer wavelength filters , most notably the johnson - cousins @xmath20 . @xcite",
    "utilized an intermediate band filter centered at 815.9 nm to study variability in the orion nebula cluster and found that 46% of the stars with @xmath21 were periodic , where @xmath22 is the standard deviation measured over all observations for a star .",
    "only 24% having @xmath23 were periodic , the majority exhibited the irregular variation characteristic of type ii variables .    in their study of ic 348",
    "@xcite found that the full range of variation for periodic stars of spectral type m0-m4 or later is @xmath24 magnitudes in the @xmath20 band .",
    "no ctts exhibited periodic variability over 5 seasons of monitoring .",
    "@xcite also characterized the variability in their sample by @xmath22 finding that in their @xmath25 subsample the wtts had @xmath21 and the ctts were found to have @xmath26 . only the type ii variables ( ctts ) had @xmath23 .",
    "the survey of the cha i star formation region in @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 by @xcite found that the largest amplitudes in each band were 0.18 , 0.14 , and 0.13 , respectively .",
    "the earliest spectral type in the sample was m5 , corresponding to a maximum mass of 0.12 m@xmath1 .",
    "these objects showed periodic variations , presumably due to spots , whose peak - to - peak amplitudes drop in later spectral types .",

    "they found that periodic variables had amplitudes less than 0.2 magnitudes .",
    "the larger amplitude variables were generally non - periodic .",

    "@xcite find that nine out of 32 young brown dwarf candidates ( spectral types m5.5 to l2 ) exhibit @xmath20 band variability .",
    "the amplitudes of mid - term ( day - to - day ) variations were as high as 0.36 magnitudes while shorter term variations had standard deviations @xmath5 0.05 magnitudes .",

    "the thermal emission from the inner circumstellar disk can be detected in the near - ir @xmath34 and @xmath35 bands @xcite .",
    "for the less massive and cooler young brown dwarfs the reduced contrast between the disk emission and the substellar photosphere motivates disk surveys in @xmath36 band .",
    "an @xmath36 band survey by @xcite finds that for low mass stars and substellar objects in ic 348 and taurus the disk fraction is not dependent on mass or age and that the presence of disk emission is associated with accretion indicators such as h@xmath3 emission .",
    "comparison of disk models with mid - ir photometry shows that the disks surrounding young brown dwarfs can be flared like those around classical t tauri stars @xcite .",
    "the model fits also suggest the presence of inner holes that are a few substellar radii in size .",

    "m dwarfs are 2.5 magnitudes fainter in @xmath68 than in @xmath0 , thus use of the @xmath68 band in orion would not reach young brown dwarfs .",

    "examination of the temperature - surface gravity ( figure [ fig - teff_logg ] ) relations based on the bcah98 models shows for objects at the hydrogen burning limit younger than 10 myr the effective temperature ranges between 2900 k and 3000 k and the surface gravity varies from log(g ) = 3.5 to 4.2 .    when the locations in hertzsprung - russell diagrams of spectroscopically classified and presumably co - eval stars in specific star formation regions are compared against evolutionary models the inferred ages mismatch using the spectral type to @xmath77 scale defined for disk dwarfs .",
    "this has led to the adoption of a semi - empirical temperature scale intermediate between that of the dwarfs and the giants @xcite .",
    "this practice is motivated by the surface gravities expected in pre - main sequence stars and results in effective temperatures several 100 k warmer at a given spectral type .",
    "thus a @xmath77 of 2900 k corresponds to a spectral type of m4.5 for a dwarf @xcite but of m6.5 for a pre - main sequence star .",
    "the photospheric colors of m dwarfs and m giants differ at the later spectral types with the m giants becoming bluer due to surface gravity effects .",
    "this color shift with lower surface gravity is due to the change in the optical depth for the formation of molecules , most importantly tio , that dominate the stellar spectrum .",
    "@xcite notes that for objects of later spectral types , e.g. m8 , the trend is reversed with the lower surface gravity stars becoming redder longward of 8500  . due to these deviations from disk dwarf colors",

    "as described below , understanding the effect of low surface gravity on @xmath85 is crucial for estimating the @xmath0 band veiling from reddening - invariant colors .",
    "the identification of accretion shocks by photometry involves detection of the additional continuum flux generated by the reprocessing of the high temperature shock back along the accretion column .",

    "the errors in these relations are dominated not by photometric uncertainly ( which is typically 1 - 2% ) , but by the intrinsic cosmic scatter of the sample .      due to the non - periodic variations of low mass ctts and the irregular sampling by the sdss we expect the resulting lightcurves to be fairly random .",
    "a truly random sequence has a standard deviation ( @xmath22 ) equal to 1.0/@xmath117 of the peak - to - peak amplitude .",
    "given a finite number of samples and a probability that the true value of @xmath22 exceeds a specific threshold we need to find the corresponding minimum threshold for the observed @xmath22 that indicates significant variability .",
    "we generated a series of monte carlo simulations to determine the maximum @xmath22 in a random sequence given an intrinsic @xmath22 of the parent population and a limited number of observations .",
    "the scaling factors presented in table [ tbl - varthres ] reflect the maximum @xmath22 seen in 99% of the simulated data sets using 10,000 realizations per point . in the limit of large number of observations",
    "the scaling factors tend towards unity .",
    "we identify variable stars on the basis of the @xmath0 band @xmath22 exceeding both a threshold of 0.05 magnitudes ( scaled by the correction factor defined above ) , and three times the photometric error in @xmath0 . of these",
    "we also select a subset that meet the same conditions applied to the @xmath92 band .",
    "this @xmath92 band variability criterion matches the typical boundary between type i and type ii @xmath20 band variations in very low mass stars and young brown dwarfs .      on the basis of these criteria",
    "we identify 507 stars that are significantly variable in the @xmath0 band of which 215 also meet the criteria for @xmath92 band variability . in figures [ fig - ori_rricmd ] and [ fig - ori_iizcmd ]",
    "we see that the majority of the variable stars form a locus parallel to and roughly 2 magnitudes above the main sequence placed at the @xmath118 distance of the orion star formation region .",
    "the spatial distribution of these low mass candidates is concentrated in the orion ob1a and ob1b associations and the ngc 2068/2071 protocluster ( figure [ fig - ori_radec ] ) .",
    "the orion ob1c subassociation members comprise a dispersed population in this region .      in order to assess the possible contamination of our orion sample by variable field stars we apply the criteria defined above to a neighboring equatorial field bounded by @xmath119 and @xmath120 which encompasses three times the area of our survey .",
    "this is a complex region containing at least three populations of young stars which we now describe .",
    "on the basis of rosat all - sky survey @xcite detections @xcite subsequently identified a population of @xmath5 30 myr low mass wtts south of the taurus - auriga cloud .",
    "while we expect to see class i variability in these stars signs of active accretion or the presence of inner circumstellar disks should not be evident due to the typical 10 myr disk lifetime .",
    "we also expect to detect the background 8 myr old gould belt stars @xcite which may include ctts . as the gould belt midplane crosses our equatorial survey area near @xmath121",
    "we suspect some gould belt stars might be found in our orion sample .",
    "the third star formation complex is that associated with the nearby ( 80 @xmath122 20 pc ) translucent cloud mbm 18 @xcite .",
    "this high latitude cloud contains compact regions of co(1 - 0 ) emission with line intensities above 3 k. if mbm 18 is an active star formation region then due to its proximity we expect all but the lowest massed young stars to be too bright for the sdss ,    application of our orion ctts criteria results in 133 @xmath0 band variables of which 19 are also variable in the @xmath92 band . after scaling by the ratio of the survey areas these imply possible contamination fractions of 8.7% and 2.9% for the orion @xmath0 band variables and its @xmath92 band variable subset , respectively",
    "in figure [ fig - ori_delqriz ] we show the reddening - invariant @xmath78 color shift between the faint and the bright states defined by the @xmath0 band brightness against the 2mass @xmath29 magnitude .",
    "the observed trend is for @xmath78 to decrease when the star is brighter in @xmath0 which is consistent with the presence of veiling in the @xmath96 band . in this figure",
    "the horizontal dotted line marks the substellar boundary based on the bcah98 2 myr isochrone placed at m - m = 8.22 .",
    "we convert the bcah98 @xmath123 magnitudes from the cit to the 2mass system following @xcite . the derived effective temperature from @xmath78 changes by approximately 100 k for every 0.1 change in the color ( see figure [ fig - teffqriz ] ) . due to this uncertainty in determination of the photospheric @xmath78 color we will present all color and variability trends against the 2mass @xmath29 magnitude which should be relatively unaffected by both shock emission and disk thermal emission .    in figure [ fig - ori_invarcc ]",
    "we see that the bright state @xmath85 during both faint and bright states slightly decreases in the less massive ( fainter ) objects .",
    "however , when the observed @xmath85 are compared against those predicted from the cooler ( @xmath5 2700 k ) low surface gravity models ( dot - dash line ) it is clear that the bulk of veiling signature is probably due to the shifts in photospheric colors .",
    "thus , at the substellar boundary we only see evidence for weak @xmath0 band veiling which consistent with the results of @xcite who find a deficit of continuum veiling at 5500  for accreting stars of spectral types m5 to m7 .",
    "if the veiling in a specific band @xmath88 ranges from @xmath124 to @xmath125 then the observed magnitude change is @xmath126 this scales montonically , albeit non - linearly , with @xmath125 , if @xmath127 which in the case where @xmath124 scales with @xmath125 , i.e. @xmath128 requires @xmath129 , which is implied by @xmath130 . in general",
    "we then expect the amplitude and rms of the variability to be related to the veiling and hence with the shock flux in that band .    in figure [ fig - ori_sigg ]",
    "we see that the maximum rms of the @xmath0 band variations peaks at @xmath131 and that no high - amplitude ( @xmath132 variables are seen below @xmath133 .",
    "the triangles mark the median @xmath134 values computed in for one - magnitude bins spanning @xmath135 .",
    "we also see that the maximum ratio of the @xmath0 band to @xmath92 band rms ( @xmath136/@xmath137 ) peaks at the same magnitude and then decreases in the fainter stars ( figure [ fig - ori_siggz ] ) .",
    "only five faint ( @xmath138 ) candidate accreting stars have @xmath139.this trend is perhaps indicative of cooling of the accretion shock temperature with diminished mass .    for the intermediate mass classical t tauris studied by @xcite , the balmer jump diminishes as the veiling and shock bolometric luminosity increase .",
    "conversely , for the weakly accreting systems expected in very low mass stars and young brown dwarfs the balmer jump should be relatively large suggesting that the bulk of the shock emission will be in the near - ultraviolet rather than the optical bands .",
    "the shock models of @xcite suggest that shocks with lower energy flux carried by the accreting column emit more at redder wavelengths due to quasi - blackbody emission from the heated photosphere .",
    "the trend we see is consistent with a decrease in the shock energy flux with decreasing mass .",
    "near - infrared ( @xmath123 ) photometry has often been used to detect the presence of excess emission primarily in the @xmath35 band due to thermal emission from the inner circumstellar disk .",
    "@xcite find a classical t tauri locus in @xmath140 based on the dereddened colors of k7/m0 intermediate massed stars in taurus . in figure [ fig - ori_jkj ] we see that the @xmath111 excess indicating either a disk signatures or significant extinction drops for objects having @xmath141 .",
    "for the 2 myr bcah98 isochrone this corresponds to 0.11 m@xmath1 and @xmath77 = 3000 k ( @xmath5 m5.5 ) .",
    "this lack of signature in @xmath123 is expected for substellar objects since they are less luminous and so the inner circumstellar disk will be cooler .",
    "as discussed by @xcite this contrast problem between the disk and the stellar photosphere motivates searching for young brown dwarf disks in the @xmath36 and longer wavelength bands .",
    "analysis of 2mass and multi - epoch sdss photometry of low mass pre - main sequence objects stars within the orion ob1 assocation shows that :    \\1 . @xmath0",
    "band variations having a standard deviation greater than 0.05 magnitudes persist for objects having reddening - invariant colors redder than , and @xmath29 magnitudes fainter than , that expected for the stellar / substellar boundary .",
    "\\2 . while identification of @xmath0 band veiling for spectral types later than m4 is hindered by our uncertain knowledge of surface gravity effects on photospheric colors , we see evidence for accretion signatures even in these very low mass objects .",
    "the general trend is for the veiling signature to diminish with decreasing temperature ( and mass ) .",
    "no disk signatures based on @xmath142 color excess are seen for spectral types later than m4 .",
    "we infer based on variability and weak veiling that the accretion process and hence the disks are present , and that relative contribution to the @xmath35 band flux is weak .",
    "this is consistent with earlier work on young brown dwarf disks .",
    "we have demonstrated that multi - epoch and multi - band imaging surveys enable identification and classification of pre - main sequence objects based on variability and reddening - invariant colors .",
    "while use of the sdss @xmath0 band was mandated by the sensitivity issues and the red - leak in the imager s filter system , inclusion of a broad - band filter that is shortward of the balmer jump such the sdss @xmath68 in the next generation of surveys , i.e. the large synoptic survey telescope or lsst , will increase the sensitivity to the veiling emission from the accretion shock for the later and less massive objects .",
    "we are supplementing this imaging survey with an sdss spectroscopic program targeting low mass stars in orion and the taurus - auriga star formation region .",
    "results from this study in addition to analysis of the veiling trends presented here and their constraints on shock luminosities and mass accretion rates will be discussed in subsequent work .    we thank the anonymous referee for comments that have greatly improved this paper .",
