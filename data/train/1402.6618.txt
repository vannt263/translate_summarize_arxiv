    "the equation of state ( eos ) of cold and dense strongly interacting matter , which determines the inner structure of compact stars @xcite , is encoded in its fundamental theory , quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "a full nonperturbative determination of the pressure of the theory is still out of reach due to the so - called sign problem of lattice qcd @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the methods of chiral effective field theory ( eft ) of nuclear forces @xcite and high - density perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) @xcite have matured enough to provide reliable predictions for the eos in the limits of low density nuclear matter and dense quark matter , respectively . in particular , by now both approaches produce results with reliable error estimates , implying that it is finally possible to quantitatively estimate our understanding of the neutron star matter eos .    during the past couple of years , several articles have addressed the determination of the neutron star eos by combining insights from low - energy chiral eft with the requirement that the resulting eoss support the most massive stars observed ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , the discovery of neutron stars with masses around two solar masses @xcite has recently been seen to lead to strong constraints on the properties of stellar matter @xcite . while otherwise impressive , these analyses have solely concentrated on the low density regime , and have typically applied no microphysical constraints beyond the nuclear saturation density @xmath0 .",
    "this has resulted in eoss that behave very differently from that of deconfined quark matter even at rather high energy densities .    in the present work ,",
    "our aim is to demonstrate that the eos of neutron star matter can be significantly further constrained by requiring it to approach the quark matter one at high density . to do this",
    ", we use the state - of - the - art result of @xcite , where a compact expression for the three - loop pressure of unpaired quark matter , taking into account the nonzero value of the strange quark mass , was derived ( see also @xcite and @xcite for details of the original pqcd calculation ) .",
    "a particularly powerful outcome of the analysis is that the high density constraint significantly reduces the uncertainty band of the stellar matter eos even at low densities , well below a possible phase transition to deconfined quark matter .",
    "this implies that the @xmath1-@xmath2 relations we obtain are more restrictive than previous ones even for pure neutron stars .    in practice",
    ", our calculation proceeds as follows ( see also fig .  [ fig1 ] ) : at densities below @xmath3 , we employ the chiral eft eos of @xcite , assuming the true result to lie within the error band given in this reference . at baryon chemical potentials above 2.6 gev , where the relative uncertainty of the quark matter eos is as large as the nuclear matter one at @xmath4 , we on the other hand use the result of @xcite and its respective error estimate . between these two regions",
    ", we assume that the eos is well approximated by an interpolating polytrope built from two `` monotropes '' of the form @xmath5=@xmath6 .",
    "these functions are first matched together in a smooth way , but later we also consider the scenario of a first - order phase transition , allowing the density to jump at the matching point of the two monotropes .     for pressureless nuclear matter ) , and on the vertical axis the pressure .",
    "the band in the region around the question mark corresponds to the interpolating polytropic eos that will be introduced in this work.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    varying the polytropic parameters and the transition density over ranges limited only by causality , we obtain a band of eoss that can be further constrained by the requirement that the eos support a two solar mass star .",
    "this results in eos and @xmath1-@xmath2 bands that are significantly narrower than ones obtained without the high density constraint ( see fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] ) .",
    "an important check of the robustness of our construction is that the obtained band is largely unaffected by the nature of the assumed phase transition or by the introduction of a third interpolating monotrope .    .",
    "three representative eoss marked with i - iii have crosses denoting the maximal chemical potential reached at the center of the star.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    clearly , both our setup and results bear some resemblance to those of @xcite .",
    "an important difference between these two calculations is , however , that while the authors of the latter paper imposed a set of somewhat _ ad hoc _ constraints on their polytropic parameters , for us this is not necessary , as the high density constraint automatically restricts these numbers . in this vein",
    ", one can in fact argue that our calculation gives an _ a posteriori _",
    "justification for many of the choices made in @xcite . at the same time",
    ", it is also important to note that the ease with which we are able to perform the matching between the low and high density eoss  and the high maximum masses we obtain for the stars  is in stark contrast with many earlier attempts to directly match nuclear and quark matter eoss onto each other ( cf .",
    "e.g.  @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we first explain the details of our calculation , i.e.  introduce the low and high density eoss used as well as the specific parametrization of our interpolating polytropes . after this",
    ", we proceed to display and analyze our results in section 3 , covering both the eoss , @xmath1-@xmath2 relations , and various correlations between the parameters appearing in our calculation . in section 4",
    ", we finally draw our conclusions .",
    "outside the dense inner core of a compact star , one expects to find somewhat more dilute nuclear matter .",
    "the composition of this medium ranges from a gas of nuclei ( inside an electron sea ) in the outer stellar crust to increasingly neutron - rich matter in the inner crust and outer core of the star .",
    "the eos of the latter type of matter has traditionally been estimated through many - body calculations employing phenomenological potentials , typically accounting for two- and three - nucleon interactions ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "more recently , developments in chiral effective theory ( eft ) have , however , significantly systematized this procedure and in particular provided a formal basis for the hierarchy amongst contributions coming from different types of interactions @xcite .",
    "clouds composed of the eoss displayed in fig .  [ fig2 ] .",
    "the color coding is the same as there , as is our notation for the three representative eoss i - iii.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    at the moment , calculations within chiral eft @xcite have reached a state , where uncertainties related to the details of many - body simulations are negligible , and nearly the entire remaining error in the eos originates from the determination of various coupling constants of the eft itself .",
    "the magnitude of these uncertainties grows rapidly with density , such that at nuclear saturation density the pressure of neutron star matter is currently known to roughly @xmath7 accuracy @xcite . in the near future",
    ", it is expected that these uncertainties will further decrease through the emergence of more precise constraints for the low - energy couplings of the chiral eft and the incorporation of higher - order interactions in the theory .",
    "see e.g.  @xcite for a more systematic analysis of these issues .",
    "the current state of the art in the determination of the nuclear matter eos can be found in @xcite , the results of which are heavily based on the earlier work of @xcite . in @xcite , these eoss are given in a tabulated form for densities @xmath8\\,n_0 $ ] , with @xmath0 the nuclear saturation density . in our calculations , we use both the maximally soft and stiff variations of this nuclear eos , corresponding to the lower and upper limit of the pressure at a given number density .",
    "for these two results , also the dependence of the baryon chemical potential on the density is somewhat different . for densities below 0.6@xmath0 ,",
    "we in addition need the crust eos , which can be found e.g.  from @xcite .    .",
    "the energy densities are all continuous due to the smoothness of the matching procedure ( no first order phase transition ) in these cases.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]      the eos of cold quark matter is accessible through perturbative qcd at high densities , and has indeed been determined to order @xmath9 in the strong coupling constant .",
    "this calculation was first carried out at vanishing quark masses in @xcite ( cf .",
    "also  @xcite ) , and later generalized to systematically include the effects of a nonzero strange quark mass at two @xcite and three loops @xcite .",
    "like all perturbative results evaluated to a finite order in the coupling , also the quark matter eos is a function of an unphysical parameter , the scale of the chosen renormalization scheme ( here modified minimal subtraction ) @xmath10 .",
    "this dependence , which diminishes order by order in perturbation theory , offers a convenient way to estimate the contribution of the remaining , undetermined orders , and thus serves as quantitative measure of the inherent uncertainty in the result .    in a recent study of @xcite",
    ", it was demonstrated that the complicated numerical eos derived in @xcite can be cast in the form of a simple fitting function for the pressure in terms of the baryon chemical potential @xmath11 . fixing the strong coupling constant and the strange quark mass at",
    "arbitrary reference scales ( using lattice and experimental data ) , the eos of quark matter in @xmath12-equilibrium assumes the form @xmath13 where we have denoted the pressure of three massless noninteracting quark flavors by @xmath14    the parameters of the above eos can be shown to acquire the optimal values ( see @xcite for details ) @xmath15 while the dependence of the result on the renormalization scale is encoded in the functions @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "they in turn depend on a dimensionless parameter proportional to @xmath10 , @xmath18 , the value of which is let to vary from @xmath19 to @xmath20 .",
    "the resulting expression can be seen to correctly reproduce the full three - loop pressure , quark number density and speed of sound to per cent accuracy for baryon chemical potentials smaller than @xmath21 gev .       as functions of the polytropic indices @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the red bands corresponding to @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 denote the ranges of @xmath27s , for which stars of these masses can be obtained , while the widths of the bands reflect the uncertainties in the low and high density eoss .",
    "the white region in the lower right hand corner is excluded due to superluminality ( which can occur at a density higher than reached at the center of the star ) .",
    "the upper left hand corner would on the other hand require @xmath28 to be larger than 4 , and is thus disallowed by our pqcd eos .",
    "the gray dots finally represent our 3500 randomly generated eoss.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    at a baryon density @xmath29 , the chiral eft prediction for the eos of neutron - rich nuclear matter has an uncertainty of @xmath30  an accuracy matched by the perturbative quark matter pressure at @xmath31 gev . to parameterize the ( unknown ) behavior of the eos between these two limits , a natural choice is to employ one or more monotropes of the form @xmath32 , matched together at a set of intermediate chemical potentials .",
    "as using a single monotrope is seen to lead to an overconstrained system , and the use of more than two monotropes has only a minor effect on the results , in most of our forthcoming analysis our interpolating eos is composed of exactly two monotropes . in the beginning we assume that the matching of the two monotropes is smooth , and that there is no jump in the number density at the matching point .",
    "this assumption is , however , relaxed later , when we study the scenario of a first - order phase transition between the nuclear and quark matter phases .    , standing for the strength of the phase transition : @xmath33 ( blue ) , @xmath34 ( magenta ) , and @xmath35 ( black ) .",

    "if no such value is found , the eos is discarded ; otherwise the corresponding quark matter eos takes over beyond this point .",
    "4 .   finally , we evaluate the speed of sound @xmath56 of our eos over the entire interval from @xmath57 to @xmath52 , and locate its maximum there .",
    "should this value exceed 1 , the eos is again discarded as superluminal .",
    "the outcome of the matching and interpolation procedure explained in the previous section is displayed in fig .  [ fig2 ] for the case of two smoothly matched monotropes . here",

    "the typical structure of the eoss is such that the maximal stiffness ( or @xmath64 ) is reached just below @xmath47 .        in fig .",

    "this falls right in the middle of the interval between the nucleonic and pqcd regions , where the eos is equally constrained by its low and high density limits .",

    "[ fig4 ] additionally displays the internal structure of the maximally massive stars ; here , the softening of the eos when approaching the perturbative densities is seen as a faster growth of the energy density near the center of the star .",

    "[ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] are visible as the dark green areas .",

    "it is also worth noting that within the bitrope approach , we find no configurations with masses above @xmath76 . in comparison with the findings of @xcite ,",
    "our upper and lower limits for the radii are consistently larger by about @xmath19 km , while our most massive configurations are lighter by about @xmath77 .",

    "polytropic eoss with the index @xmath27 larger than 2 become eventually superluminal , implying that the larger @xmath22 is , the smaller the value of @xmath47 has to be in order for the eos to stay subluminal .",
    "the blue bands in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , which stand for constant values of @xmath47 , demonstrate this fact : for @xmath81 , we must require @xmath82 , while for @xmath83 we get @xmath84 gev , and for @xmath85 simply @xmath86 gev . as the second segment of the polytrope",
    "is typically significantly softer than the first , the stars quickly become unstable once their center reaches @xmath47 .",
    "the maximal @xmath11 s are thus typically only slightly larger than the corresponding @xmath47 s , as one can see from fig .",

    "the black curves correspond to a number of individual representative eoss.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    as stiffer eoss produce heavier stars , the maximal speed of sound predicted by a given eos is naturally correlated with the corresponding maximal mass .",
    "we find that in order to be able to fulfill the @xmath88 constraint , this maximal value has to satisfy @xmath89 .",
    "we suspect , however , that this constraint may be overly restrictive , as our interpolating polytropes typically predict a discontinuous @xmath64 that is peaked around @xmath87 .      in deriving the results presented above we made two in principle _ ad hoc _ assumptions ,",
    "whose effect on the obtained eos and @xmath65 relations we now proceed to study .",
    "first , one can naturally extend the number of interpolating monotropes to three ( or more ) , allowing for further freedom in the behavior of the eos between the low and high density regimes .",
    "second , the assumption of a smooth matching of the two monotropes can ( and should ) be relaxed by allowing for a jump in the number density at the matching point , corresponding to a first - order phase transition between the nuclear and quark matter phases .",
    "starting with the number of monotropes , we generated a large set of tritropic eoss with randomly chosen matching points and polytropic indices , which fulfill the smoothness and subluminality constraints .",
    "[ fig7 ] depicts the effect of this extra freedom on the eos : we observe that , as expected , the addition of a third segment somewhat increases the region of allowed eoss , but the effect is small in comparison with the other uncertainties of the calculation . from here , we conclude that using bitropic eoss should suffice for our purposes .",
    "-@xmath2 clouds corresponding to tritropic and first - order phase transition eoss , shown together with our original result from fig .",
    "[ fig3].,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    to investigate the effect of a first - order phase transition at @xmath47 , we next relaxed the smoothness condition in our matching of the two monotropes . keeping the pressure continuous but allowing for a ` latent heat ' @xmath90 of the order of the qcd scale , we first fixed @xmath91 and proceeded to find solutions for @xmath22 and @xmath23 that would lead to a consistent eos .",
    "this led to the rather restricted values @xmath92 $ ] and @xmath93 $ ] , for which the transition point was always found to lie within the interval @xmath94\\,$]gev .",
    "the corresponding region of allowed eoss , depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] , was found to be somewhat smaller than in the case with smooth matching . from this ( as well as similar calculations performed for @xmath95 and @xmath96 ) , we conclude that the assumption of smooth matching made in the previous section was in fact justified when searching for the least restrictive bounds for the eos .    for eoss displaying a phase transition , one can also estimate the amount of quark matter in the cores of the stars .",
    "this is seen from fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , which shows the relation between the maximal chemical potential reached at the center of a maximally massive star @xmath97 and the critical ( matching ) chemical potential @xmath47 .",
    "we see that all eoss that fulfill the mass constraint lie above the @xmath98 line , and are therefore able to support stars with quark matter cores .",
    "however , the stronger the transition is , the smaller the window for quark matter : for @xmath99 , there is practically no quark matter left in the cores of the stars .    in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] , we finally show the effect of the third monotrope and a nonzero latent heat on the obtained @xmath65 clouds . in particular ,",
    "we see from here that allowing for a tritropic interpolation does not have a large impact on the @xmath65 plot : the most important change is simply the shift of the maximal mass star to @xmath100 .",
    "a more complete analysis of the case of a first - order phase transition has been recently performed by @xcite . in this reference",
    ", the authors in particular consider all possible branching cases , including twin star configurations , which we have completely omitted in our work .",
    "in the paper at hand , we have constructed a novel scheme for determining the eos of compact star matter that involves an interpolation between the regimes of low - energy chiral effective theory and high - density perturbative qcd .",
    "these two limiting results are truly robust within their ranges of applicability , as they represent controlled calculations in the fundamental theory of the strong interactions .",
    "our work on the other hand constitutes the first ever attempt to take constraints from both sides on equal footing when determining the eos between these limits .",
    "we have demonstrated that this leads to important new constraints on the properties of compact star matter on a wide density range , and thus even for stars containing only hadronic matter .",
    "the strictness of the constraints placed on the stellar eos by its high - density limit can be understood through the tension between the softness of the perturbative eos and the stiffness required by the confirmed existence of a two solar mass compact star .",
    "for the two interpolating monotropes we employ in our calculation , this translates into a significant difference between the respective polytropic indices : while the first one needs to be rather stiff , with @xmath101 , the latter must be considerably softer , @xmath102 .",
    "although the polytropes themselves of course do not carry information about the underlying microphysics , such a strong shift in the polytropic index might be interpreted as a sign of the effective degrees of freedom of the system changing from hadronic to denconfined ones .",
    "the effect of the high density constraint is perhaps best illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] , which displays our eos band in the form of energy density vs.  pressure , plotted together with the previous prediction of @xcite , dubbed hlps .",
    "the latter work applied the same low - density eos we did and took into account the two solar mass constraint , but did not require the result to approach the pqcd eos at large densities .",
    "as expected , the main difference between the two results is seen in the hlps cloud containing somewhat softer eoss at low density and stiffer ones at high density .",
    "the rather narrow eos band that results from our interpolation naturally corresponds to a well defined region in the mass - radius diagram of compact stars . for a @xmath73 neutron star , the radii we obtain range between 11 and 14.5@xmath103 km , while the radius of a @xmath74 pulsar lies within @xmath104 km .",
    "interestingly , we do not find configurations with masses above @xmath105 ( for bitropic interpolation the maximal mass is @xmath76 ) .",
    "this conclusion is in contrast with what has been found before without the high - density constraint ; see e.g.  @xcite , where stars with masses up to @xmath106 were discovered .    for the convenience of the reader , we finally provide three representative eoss in a tabulated form at the end of this paper .",
    "these eoss are all subluminal , able to sustain a two solar mass star , and maximally different from each other . of them",
    ", eos i gives the minimal radius , eos ii the maximal mass and eos iii the maximal radius for our compact stars .    in conclusion",
    ", we find it remarkable , how the properties of quark matter at asymptotically high densities can be seen to have such a strong impact on the structure of compact stars at much lower energies . as we have highlighted in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , this fact appears to make it possible to largely bridge the gap between the respective eoss of low - density nuclear matter and high - density ( perturbative ) quark matter .",
