    "problem of estimating the parameters of sinusoidal signals from noisy measurements is an important topic in signal processing and several parametric and nonparameteric approaches have been developed for one - dimensional ( 1-d ) signals  @xcite .",
    "recently , this problem has received a renewed interest thanks to the emergence of multidimensional ( @xmath0-d ) applications .",
    "indeed , parameter estimation from @xmath0-d signals is required in numerous applications in signal processing and communications such as nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) spectroscopy , wireless communication channel estimation  @xcite and mimo radar imaging  @xcite . in all these applications",
    ", signals are assumed to be a superposition of @xmath0-d sinusoids or , more generally , of exponentially decaying @xmath0-d complex exponentials ( modal signals ) .",
    "as for the 1-d case , the crucial step is the estimation of the @xmath0-d modes ( including frequencies and damping factors ) because they are nonlinear functions of the data .    in order to achieve high resolution estimates , parametric approaches are often preferred to nonparamatric ones .",
    "several parametric @xmath0-d methods ( @xmath1 ) have been proposed .",
    "they include linear prediction - based methods such as 2-d tls - prony  @xcite , and subspace approaches such as matrix enhancement and matrix pencil ( memp )  @xcite , 2-d esprit  @xcite , multidimensional folding ( mdf )  @xcite , improved multidimensional folding ( imdf )  @xcite , tensor - esprit  @xcite , principal - singular - vector utilization for modal analysis ( puma )  @xcite and the methods proposed in @xcite .",
    "all these methods perform at various degrees but it is generally admitted that they yield accurate estimates at high snr scenarios and/or when the frequencies are well separated .",
    "this is obtained at the expense of computational effort .",
    "for instance , mdf , imdf , 2-d esprit and memp are esprit - type techniques .",
    "they require to build large size matrices and apply the esprit - based method , which make their computational complexity very high particularly in the case of large @xmath0-d signals .",
    "the tensor - esprit algorithm uses the structure inherent in the @xmath0-d data at the expense of a high computational complexity .",
    "recently , tpuma  @xcite was proposed as an accurate and computationally efficient multidimensional harmonic retrieval method , which attains the cramr - rao lower bound ( crlb ) and does not require to build large size matrix or tensor .",
    "however its performance degrades rapidly with the increase of the number of components present in the @xmath0-d signal .",
    "recently , methods based on sparse approximations have been proposed to address the harmonic or modal retrieval problem  @xcite . for time - data spectral estimation ,",
    "the dictionary is formed from a set of ( normalized ) complex exponentials potentially embedded in the data , which allows one to easily include some prior knowledge about the position of certain known modes . more generally , the usual choice is a uniform spectral grid obtained by sampling the frequency and damping factor lines .",
    "clearly , a fine grid will lead to a good resolution but , on the other hand , it will result in a huge dictionary @xcite .",
    "this complexity is further increased in the case of @xmath0-d signals in which we are confronted with @xmath2-d grids .    in order to reduce the computational burden , a multigrid scheme for sparse approximation",
    "was proposed in @xcite to iteratively refine the dictionary starting from a coarse one . at each iteration ,",
    "a sparse approximation is performed and then new grid points ( atoms ) are inserted in the vicinity of active ones leading to a multiresolution - like scheme .",
    "so the multigrid algorithm in @xcite refines jointly @xmath3-d grids .",
    "this algorithm is efficient but has mainly two drawbacks : 1 ) it does not have convergence guarantees , 2 ) the dictionary becomes intractable for large signals when @xmath1 .",
    "the goal of the present paper is to propose a fast multidimensional modal estimation technique able to handle large signals and yielding a good estimation accuracy .    1 .   first",
    ", the proposed approach , as for some parametric methods for modal retrieval , is based on the idea of estimating the parameters independently along each dimension @xmath4 .",
    "it will be shown that the _ simultaneous _ sparse approximation concept  @xcite is well - suited for @xmath0-d modal retrieval ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "the second contribution consists in the proposition of a new multigrid scheme which amounts to consider a two - step refinement of 1-d grids , the first step for frequencies and the second one for damping factors .",
    "one advantage of the two - step multigrid is that it reduces the computational time .",
    "the convergence issue of the proposed multigrid strategy is analyzed firstly for single tone @xmath5 case , and convergence conditions are derived .",
    "condition for convergence are expressed in terms of atom positions in the initial dictionaries .",
    "the extension of this result to the multiple tones case ( @xmath6 ) is not trivial because , not only it depends on the selected sparse approximation algorithm , but also on the coherence of the dictionary  @xcite . indeed , due to the refinement strategy",
    ", the resulting dictionary is far from being uncorrelated which may prevent convergence even in the noiseless case .",
    "consequently , for the multiple tones case , we exploit an alternative representation of the data model enabling the extraction of the @xmath0-d signal tones separately .",
    "therefore , the third contribution of this paper consists in deriving a new algorithm for estimating parameters of @xmath0-d damped signals in which the results of the previous contribution apply .",
    "the effectiveness of the new algorithm for multiple @xmath0-d tones is also analyzed .",
    "one very interesting by - product of this approach is that the pairing of @xmath0-d parameters is achieved for free , without any further association stage .    to assess the performances of an estimation method , the usual way",
    "consists in comparing the variance of the estimates to the crlb . in @xcite",
    "y. hua derived the crlb for 2-d frequencies , i.e. , undamped 2-d exponentials ; no damped signals are considered .",
    "closed - form expressions of the crlb for the general undamped @xmath0-d case are derived in @xcite .",
    "crlb for 2-d damped signals are derived in @xcite .",
    "therefore , to the best of our knowledge , no compact expressions of the crlb s are available for the general @xmath0-d modal ( damped ) signal .",
    "thus , another contribution of this paper is the derivation of the crlb s for the frequency , damping factor , amplitude and phase of the @xmath0-d modal signal .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : problem_statment ] , we introduce notation and present the @xmath0-d modal retrieval problem . in section",
    "[ sec : simultaneous ] , we formulate the @xmath0-d modal estimation problem as @xmath0 simultaneous sparse estimation problems , show how to construct a modal dictionary on a uniform grid and then describe the new fast multigrid strategy . in section  [ sec : singlerd ] , we give sufficient conditions for convergence of the multigrid dictionary refinement scheme in the case of single tone @xmath0-d signals . in light of these new results ,",
    "we propose in section  [ sec : multiplerd ] a new efficient algorithm for multiple tones @xmath0-d modal signals . in section",
    "[ sec : crlb ] , we derive the expressions of the crlb s for the parameters of @xmath0-d damped exponentials in gaussian white noise .",

    "we observe that , for a given @xmath18 , the columns @xmath64 of @xmath65 are linear combinations of the vectors @xmath66 .",

    "this property will be used in the next section to formulate the problem of estimating the mode coordinates in the @xmath18th dimension as a simultaneous sparse approximation problem .      assuming that @xmath68 , it is easy to see from ( [ eq : yr - him ] ) that for a fixed @xmath18 the mode coordinates @xmath69 ( @xmath70 ) in the @xmath18th dimension are identifiable from any column of @xmath65 .",
    "this process can also be repeated on each dimension @xmath4 to get all the modes coordinates . in practice , we have to replace the matrix @xmath65 by its noisy counterpart @xmath71 accounting for the additive white noise . in this case ,",
    "( [ eq : yr - him ] ) holds only approximately .",
    "consequently , for each column @xmath72 , the modal estimation problem can be formulated as a sparse approximation problem corresponding to the following constrained optimization : @xmath73 where @xmath74 , @xmath75 , is a ( known ) modal dictionary , @xmath76 is a ( sparse ) vector containing the coefficients of the activated columns in @xmath77 , and @xmath78 is a small reconstruction error related to the noise variance .",

    ", we restrict our attention to the somp algorithm  @xcite , reported in appendix  [ appendix_somp ] .",

    "<S> in this paper , a sparse - based method for the estimation of the parameters of multidimensional ( @xmath0-d ) modal ( harmonic or damped ) complex signals in noise is presented . </S>",
    "<S> the problem is formulated as @xmath0 simultaneous sparse approximations of multiple 1-d signals . to get a method able to handle large size signals </S>",
    "<S> while maintaining a sufficient resolution , a multigrid dictionary refinement technique is associated with the simultaneous sparse approximation problem . </S>",
    "<S> the refinement procedure is proved to converge in the single @xmath0-d mode case . </S>",
    "<S> then , for the general multiple modes @xmath0-d case , the signal tensor model is decomposed in order to handle each mode separately in an iterative scheme . </S>",
    "<S> the proposed method does not require an association step since the estimated modes are automatically `` paired '' . </S>",
    "<S> we also derive the cramr - rao lower bounds of the parameters of modal @xmath0-d signals . </S>",
    "<S> the expressions are given in compact form in the single @xmath0-d mode case . </S>",
    "<S> finally , numerical simulations are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method .    </S>",
