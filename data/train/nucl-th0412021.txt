    "exact solution of schrdinger equation for central potentials has generated much interes in recent years .",
    "so far , these potentials are the parabolic type potential @xcite , the eckart potential @xcite , the fermi - step potential @xcite , the rosen- morse potential @xcite , the ginocchio barrier @xcite , the scarf barrier @xcite , the morse potential @xcite and a potential which interpolates between morse and eckart barriers @xcite . in addition",
    ", many authors have studied on exponential type potentials @xcite and quasi exactly solvable quadratic potentials @xcite .",
    "the exact solutions for these models have been obtained analytically .",
    "recently , an alternative method known as the nikiforov - uvarov ( nu ) method has been introduced for solving the schrdinger equation ( se ) . there have been several applications of se with some well - known potentials @xcite , dirac , klein - gordon and duffin - kemmer - petiau equations for a coulomb type potential by using this method as well @xcite .    in the present work",
    ", the real - valued bound - state energies of the generalized woods - saxon potential are evaluated through the nu method @xcite by following the framework of quantum mechanics .",
    "this method is based on solving the time - independent schrdinger equation by reduction to a generalized equation of hypergeometric type .",
    "energy eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenfuctions are calculated exactly .",
    "the generalized wood - saxon potential as a shell model is selected .",
    "it can be used for describing metallic clusters in a successful way and for lighting the central part of the interaction neutron with one heavy nucleus @xcite .",
    "this paper is arranged as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we introduce the nu method . in sec .",
    "iii we apply the method to solve the schrdinger equation with the generalized woods - saxon potential .",
    "shapes of the potential and energy are studied in sec .",
    "iv . in sec . v we discuss the results .",
    "the nu method provides us an exact solution of non@xmath0relativistic schrdinger equation for certain kind of potentials @xcite .",
    "the method is based on the solutions of general second order linear differential equation with special orthogonal functions @xcite . for a given real or complex potential , the schrdinger equation in one dimension",
    "is reduced to a generalized equation of hypergeometric type with an appropriate @xmath1 coordinate transformation .",
    "thus it can be written in the following form , @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are polynomials , at most second@xmath0degree , and @xmath5 is a first@xmath0degree polynomial . to find a particular solution of eq.([eq1 ] ) by separation of variables",
    ", we use the following the transformation @xmath6 this reduces schrdinger equation , eq.(1 ) , to an equation of hypergeometric type , @xmath7 where @xmath8 satisfies @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath10 is the hypergeometric type function whose polynomial solutions are given by rodrigues relation @xmath11 , \\ ] ] where @xmath12 is a normalizing constant and the weight function @xmath13 must satisfy the condition @xcite @xmath14 the function@xmath15 and the parameter@xmath16 required for this method are defined as @xmath17 and @xmath18 here , @xmath19 is a polynomial with the parameter @xmath20 and the determination of @xmath21 is the essential point in the calculation of @xmath19 .",
    "thus , in order to find the value of @xmath21 , the expression under the square root must be square of a polynomial .",
    "hence , a new eigenvalue equation for the schrdinger equation becomes @xmath22 where @xmath23 and it will have a negative derivative .",
    "the interactions between nuclei are commonly described by using a potential that consist of the coulomb and the nuclear potentials .",
    "these potentials are usually taken to be of the woods - saxon form .",
    "as an example it can be given as the generalized woods - saxon potential @xcite @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the potential depth , @xmath26 is the width of the potential and @xmath27 is the surface thickness which is usually adjusted to the experimental values of ionization energies . in order to calculate the energy eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenfunctions , the potential function given by eq.([eq10 ] ) is substituted into the radial part of schrdinger equation : @xmath28\\psi(r)=0.\\ ] ] here , some assignments are made in the radial schrdinger equation such as @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "in addition , _ q _ is deformation parameter and an arbitrary real constant within the potential .",
    "now , in order to apply the nu@xmath0method , we rewrite eq.([eq11 ] ) by using a new variable of the form @xmath32 , @xmath33\\psi(s)=0.\\ ] ] by introducing the following dimensional parameters @xmath34 which leads to a hypergeometric type equation defined in eq.([eq1 ] ) : @xmath35\\psi(s)=0.\\ ] ] after the comparison of eq.([eq14 ] ) with eq.([eq1 ] ) , we obtain the corresponding polynomials as @xmath36 substituting these polynomials into eq.([eq6 ] ) , we obtain @xmath37 function as @xmath38 taking @xmath39 .",
    "the discriminant of the upper expression under the square root has to be zero .",
    "hence , the expression becomes the square of a polynomial of first degree ; @xmath40 and @xmath41 ^ 2 - 4\\times4\\left(\\varepsilon-\\beta\\right)\\left(q^2 + 4\\varepsilon q^2 - 4kq\\right)=0.\\ ] ] when the required arrangements are done with respect to the constant @xmath21 , its double roots are derived as @xmath42 .    thus substituting , these values for each _ k _  into eq.([eq16 ] ) following possible solution",
    "is obtained for @xmath43    @xmath44 , & \\hskip 0.5 cm \\mbox{for } \\hskip 0.5 cm k=(\\beta q-\\gamma)+q\\sqrt{(\\varepsilon-\\beta)(1+\\frac{4\\gamma}{q})}\\\\ \\\\ \\left[(2\\sqrt{\\varepsilon-\\beta}+\\sqrt{1+\\frac{4\\gamma}{q}}~)qs-2\\sqrt{\\varepsilon-\\beta}~\\right ] , & \\hskip 0.5 cm \\mbox{for } \\hskip 0.5 cm k=(\\beta q-\\gamma)-q\\sqrt{(\\varepsilon-\\beta)(1+\\frac{4\\gamma}{q})}\\\\ \\end{array}\\right.\\ ] ]    it is clearly seen that the energy eigenvalues are found with a comparison of eq.([eq7 ] ) and eq.([eq8 ] ) . from the four possible forms of the polynomial @xmath45 we select the one for which the function @xmath46 in eq.([eq9 ] ) has a negative derivative .",
    "therefore , the function @xmath46 satisfies these requirements , with @xmath47 hence , the polynomial @xmath45 is computed from eq.([eq16 ] ) as @xmath48.\\ ] ] from eq.([eq8 ] ) we also get @xmath49,\\ ] ] and also @xmath50 it is seen that the parameter @xmath51 has the following form @xmath52 ^ 2+\\frac{\\beta ^2}{\\left [ { \\sqrt { 1+\\frac{4\\gamma } { q } } + ( 1 + 2n ) } \\right]^2}+\\frac{\\beta } { 2}\\ ] ] substituting the values of @xmath51 and @xmath53 into eq.([eq13 ] ) and by using the transformation @xmath54 in eq.([eq22 ] ) , one can immediately determine the energy eigenvalues @xmath55 as @xmath56 ^ 2+\\frac{4\\left ( { \\frac{mv_0 a^2}{\\hbar ^2 } } \\right)^2}{\\left [ { \\sqrt { 1+\\frac{8mca^2}{\\hbar ^2q } } + ( 1 + 2n ) } \\right]^2}+\\frac{mv_0 a^2}{\\hbar ^2 } } \\right\\}.\\ ] ] here , the index @xmath57 is non - negative integers with @xmath58 and the above equation indicates that we deal with a family of the generalized woods@xmath0saxon potential .",
    "of course it is clear that by imposing appropriate changes in the parameters @xmath27 and @xmath25 , the index @xmath57 describes the quantization for the bound states and the energy spectrum .",
    "in addition , if the parameter @xmath59 in eq.([eq25 ] ) is adjusted to zero , solution reduces to the form obtained for the standard woods - saxon potential without regarding the parameter @xmath60 .",
    "let us now find the corresponding wave eigenfunctions .",
    "due to the nu@xmath0method , the polynomial solutions of the hypergeometric function @xmath61 depend on the determination of weight function @xmath62 which is satisfies the differential equation @xmath63^{\\prime } = \\tau ( s)\\rho ( s)$ ] .",
    "thus , @xmath62 is calculated as @xmath64 where @xmath65 .",
    "substituting into the rodrigues relation given in eq.([eq4 ] ) , the eigenfunctions are obtained in the following form @xmath66,\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the normalization constant and its value is @xmath67 .",
    "choosing @xmath68 , the polynomial solutions of @xmath69 are expressed in terms of jacobi polynomials , which is one of the orthogonal polynomials with weight function @xmath70 in the closed interval @xmath71 $ ] , giving [ constant]@xmath72 @xcite . by substituting @xmath19 and @xmath73 into the expression @xmath74 and solving the resulting differential equation , the other part of the wave function in eq.([eq2 ] )",
    "is found as @xmath75 where @xmath76 and again taking @xmath68 . combining the jacobi polynomials and @xmath8 in eq.([eq28 ] ) , the s@xmath0wave functions are constructed as @xmath77 where @xmath78 is a new normalization constant .",
    "for the generalized woods - saxon potential in eq.([eq10 ] ) , the potential shape can be determined by the parameters @xmath25 , @xmath27 and @xmath59 .",
    "therefore , we have adopted a generalized woods@xmath0saxon shape for the real part of the optical@xmath0model potential @xcite and investigated the scattering phenomenon for this potential only .",
    "the empirical values found by perey et al .",
    "@xcite @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 are used . here , @xmath82 is the mass number of target nucleus and @xmath83 .",
    "the shape of the generalized woods@xmath0saxon potential given by eq.(10 ) is illustrated in fig.@xmath84 .",
    "+ fig.2 shows that the energy eigenvalues as a function of the discrete level @xmath57 for different values of the parameter @xmath27 .",
    "of course it is clear that by imposing appropriate changes in the parameters @xmath27 and @xmath25 , the index @xmath57 describes the quantization of the bound states and the energy spectrum .",
    "some of the initial energy levels for @xmath68 value are presented by choosing @xmath85 , @xmath86 which is the geometric average of the target mass number @xmath87 @xcite .",
    "the exact solutions of the radial schrdinger equation for the generalized woods - saxon potential with the zero angular momentum are obtained .",
    "eigenvalues and eigenfunctions obtained from the real form of the potential are computed .",
    "so , the wave functions are physical and energy eigenvalues are in a good agreement with the results obtained by the other methods .",
    "nikiforov - uvarov method is used in the calculations .",
    "we have seen that there were some restriction on the potential parameters for the bound states within the framework of quantum mechanics .",
    "that is , the value of @xmath59 from the potential parameters is increased for the constant value of the parameter @xmath27 , it is seen that the depth of potential increases rapidly .",
    "therefore , if all the parameters of potential remain purely real , it is clear that all bound energies @xmath88 with @xmath89 represent a negative energy spectrum .",
    "we also point out that the exact results obtained for the generalized woods - saxon potential may have some interesting applications in the study of different quantum mechanical and the nuclear scattering systems .",
