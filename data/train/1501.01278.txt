    "the mathematical theory of soliton collisions in the integrable models is a well developed subject . in particular ,",
    "the solitons emerge with their properties completely unchanged after collision between them , except for relevant phase shifts .",
    "however , certain non - linear field theory models possess solitary wave solutions and it is difficult to know _ a priori _ if they are in fact true solitons with analytical multisoliton solutions . regarding this issue the so - called quasi - integrability concept",
    "has recently been put forward related to the deformations of the integrable sine - gordon ( sg ) and non - linear schrdinger ( nls ) models @xcite . according to this new concept certain deformed integrable field theory models share some properties with their truly integrable counterparts for some configurations , for example they possess an infinite number of quasi - conserved charges . for the case of two solitary wave collision",
    "those charges are asymptotically conserved in the scattering process , although the charges vary in time their values in the far past and the far future remain the same .",
    "the both numerical and analytical tools were used to define and describe the concept of quasi - integrability .",
    "our aim is to predict the results of solitary wave collisions in deformed nls models with non - vanishing boundary conditions .",
    "such theories appear in diverse areas of non - linear science , such as condensed matter physics , plasma physics and , in particular , in the study of bose - einstein condensates .",
    "we are also motivated by the above mentioned quasi - integrability property in deformed nls models with non - vanishing boundary conditions in which sufficiently fast solitary waves effectively pass through each other .    in the context of analytical calculations",
    "some results have been obtained only for the cases of small perturbations of the nls model @xcite . for nearly integrable models",
    "it has been implemented a perturbation theory allied to the the inverse scattering transform ( ist ) method @xcite .",
    "these methods have been applied mainly to the nls solitons that decay at infinity , i.e. the bright solitons .",
    "they encompass the above mentioned perturbation theory based on ist and a direct perturbation theory @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the dark solitons are intensity dips on a continuous wave background with a phase change across their intensity minimum .",
    "however , the non - vanishing boundary of dark solitons , which may change when the deformations are present , introduces serious complications when applying the perturbative techniques developed for bright solitons . in the last years",
    ", various improvements have been made to the calculations and methods @xcite based on the so - called complete set of squared jost solution ( eigenvectors of the linearized nls operator ) in order to apply to the non - vanishing boundary conditions and dark soliton perturbations .",
    "the implementation of direct methods , however , consider small perturbations around the nls model @xcite .",
    "moreover , in @xcite it has been argued that the squared jost functions associated with the dark soliton might be an insufficient basis , so rendering problematic the issue of a complete basis for the solution space of the deformed nls equation .    here",
    "we propose a method to study shallow solitary wave collisions in the context of a perturbation theory performed order by order in an expansion parameter related to the both velocity of the incoming soliton and the bogoliubov sound speed .",
    "the expansion parameter has a kinematic origin and does not appear explicitly in the lagrangian of the model . in this way our series expansion is not restricted to small deformations around the integrable nls model .",
    "we will assume that at zeroth order in this parameter the colliding solitary waves effectively pass through each other and provide the leading order contribution to the spatial shift experienced by a stationary soliton after colliding with an incoming soliton .",
    "similar perturbative framework has recently been considered in the study of scattering of ultra - relativistic kink - type solitary waves of the deformed sg model @xcite .",
    "we present the relevant developments in the context of a non - lorentz invariant field theory associated to the nls complex field and show that the absolute value of the spatial shift experienced by a black soliton after collision with an shallow gray soliton decreases as the velocity increases , in this way resembling the behavior of ultra - relativistic kink-(anti)kink collisions .",
    "it has recently been shown that the perturbed dark soliton of the nls model comprises an inner region , containing the core of the soliton and a moving shelf , and an outer region which matches to the boundary at infinity @xcite .",
    "the main features of those results relevant to our discussions here are the appearance of a shelf of finite length around the both sides of the soliton the edge of which propagates with speed determined by the background intensity , and that the difference between the amplitude of the shelf and the outer background is very small compared with the amplitude of the background intensity .",
    "the main characteristics of our perturbative scheme are the following .",
    "we consider a linear superposition of two solitary wave solutions as a good background solution during collision , such that the interaction of the colliding solitons occurs significantly in the overlapping region which is a region contained in the inner region of the perturbed stationary solitary wave .",
    "the continuous wave background will be subtracted on top of the linear superposition in order to maintain the non vanishing boundary condition at infinity .",
    "so , we are interested in investigating the effects of short - range interactions between the dark solitons and the long range contributions arising from the shelves mentioned above will be ignored in the integrals employed to compute the spatial shift . in the rest frame of the stationary solitary wave where",
    "the other approaches with velocity @xmath6 , the space - time integration of the overlapping region becomes proportional to @xmath7 , where @xmath8 , @xmath3 being the bogoliubov sound speed .",
    "this property is systematically used to provide a perturbative framework in order to calculate the spatial shift experienced by the stationary soliton , using the small value of @xmath9 as the parameter of our perturbation expansion .",
    "the perturbation parameter @xmath9 arises after space - time and suitable field space transformations are performed simultaneously . in this regard",
    "the implementation of the perturbative analyses of the non - relativistic deformed nls model is slightly different from the relativistic deformed sg model in which an analogous factor appears directly from a coordinate transformation to the rest frame of the static soliton @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec2 ]",
    "we discuss a deformed nls model with non - vanishing boundary conditions and the relevant equations leading to dark soliton solutions . in section [ sec3 ]",
    "we develop a perturbative scheme in order to compute the spatial shift experienced by a black soliton after colliding with a gray soliton . in section [ sec4 ] we present some examples of application of our formalism . the integrable nls model is considered in some detail in order to check our perturbative scheme . afterwards",
    ", the collision of dark solitons of the cubic - quintic nls model is studied as an example of a non - integrable theory . in section [ sec5 ]",
    "we develop numerical simulations for the both models considered in section [ sec4 ] . in section [ sec6 ] we discuss the main results and possible future directions of research .",
    "finally , in the appendix [ dark ] the properties of dark soliton interaction in the integrable nls model are presented , and in the appendix [ cq1 ] some properties of dark solitons of the cubic - quintic nls model are discussed",
    "various generalizations and deformations of the integrable nls model arise in physical applications .",

    "the qualitative properties of traveling waves of the nls model for general non - linearities and non - vanishing boundary conditions have been studied in @xcite .",

    "we will consider translationally invariant solutions of the form [ dark00 ] ( x , t ) = ( z ) [ i(z)+ i w t],z= x- v t , satisfying the following non - vanishing boundary condition ( _ nvbc _ ) [ bc ] |(z ) | = |_0| , _ z _ ( z ) = 0 , _ z _ ( z ) = 0 .",
