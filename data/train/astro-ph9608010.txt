    "at epochs corresponding to @xmath13 , the intergalactic medium ( igm ) is expected to recombine and remain neutral until sources of radiation develop that are capable of reionizing it .",
    "the application of the gunn - peterson ( 1965 ) constraint on the amount of cosmologically distributed neutral hydrogen to qso absorption spectra requires the universe to have been highly ionized by @xmath14 ( schneider , schmidt , & gunn 1991 ) .",
    "it thus appears that substantial sources of ionization were present at these or earlier epochs , perhaps qsos and young galaxies , or some as yet undiscovered class of objects such as pop iii stars or decaying particles .",
    "establishing the epoch of reionization is crucial for determining the impact of reionization on several key cosmological issues , from the role reionization plays in allowing collapsed objects to cool and make stars , to determining the small - scale structure in the temperature fluctuations of the cosmic background radiation ( cbr ) ( e.g. , sugiyama , silk , & vittorio 1993 ; bond 1995 ; hu & white 1996 ) .",
    "conversely , probing the epoch of reionization may provide a means of detecting the onset of the first generation of stars .",
    "very little is known about the nature of the first bound objects and of the thermal state of the universe at early epochs . in particular",
    ", the history of the transition from a neutral igm to an almost fully ionized one can reveal the character of the ionizing sources .",
    "if these are uniformly distributed , like an abundant population of pregalactic stars or decaying dark matter , the ionization and thermal state of the igm will be the same everywhere at any given epoch , with the neutral fraction decreasing gradually with cosmic time . in a cdm dominated cosmology",
    ", this may be the case since bound objects sufficiently massive ( @xmath15 ) to make stars form at high redshift .",
    "if a sufficient fraction of their ionizing photons are able to escape , the stars in these objects would reionize the universe by @xmath16 ( couchman & rees 1986 ) . in inhomogeneous reionization scenarios instead",
    ", widely separated but very luminous sources of photoionizing radiation such as qsos , present at the time the igm is largely neutral , will generate expanding regions whose size is only limited by the individual source lifetime .",
    "the universe will be divided into an ionized phase whose filling factor @xmath17 increases with time , and an ever shrinking neutral phase ( arons & wingert 1972 ; meiksin & madau 1993 ) . if the ionizing sources are randomly distributed , the regions will be spatially isolated for @xmath18",
    ". the igm will become completely reionized at the breakthrough epoch , when @xmath19 and the igm is fully transparent at the lyman continuum .",
    "current qso counts suggest that the breakthrough epoch may occur as recently as @xmath20 ( meiksin & madau 1993 ) .",
    "it is therefore of great interest , in testing rival reionization scenarios , to seek any evidence of non - uniformity in the ionization structure of the igm by studying the thermal and ionization history of the intergalactic gas surrounding isolated sources of radiation ( see , e.g. , miralda - escud & rees 1994 ) . in this paper",
    "we shall discuss how radio - astronomical measurements of spectral and spatial structures in the 21-cm line emission and absorption from at high redshifts may provide a valuable tool for probing the epoch of the likely heat input at @xmath12 and its nature , e.g. , whether it was limited to small isolated regions or was relatively diffuse .",
    "we will confine our analysis to epochs prior to complete reionization , and address the physical state of the gas which has not yet been engulfed by an ionized region .    for intergalactic to be observable in 21-cm line emission or absorption against the cosmic background radiation , the spin temperature must differ from the cbr temperature .",
    "as the former will in general be a weighted mean between the matter and cbr temperatures , an efficient mechanism for coupling the populations of the hyperfine levels to the kinetic state of the intergalactic gas is needed to unlock the spin state from the cbr .",
    "at the low particle densities characteristic of the igm , the dominant coupling mechanism is level - mixing via photon scattering  the `` wouthuysen - field '' effect .",
    "we present in this paper a new heating mechanism , arising from atomic recoil in response to the scattering of resonant photons .",
    "we demonstrate that because of resonant scattering heating , coupling makes the detection of the igm in absorption against the cbr quite unlikely , since the same photons that pump the hyperfine levels heat the atoms as well .",
    "this is not entirely surprising , as the energetic demand for raising the kinetic temperature above that of the cbr is relatively small , @xmath21ev@xmath22@xmath23 at @xmath24 , hence even a relatively inefficient heating mechanism like resonant scattering may become important .",
    "we find that the heating requirements are quite generally met in a variety of scenarios in which radiation sources turn on at high redshifts .",
    "we show that , in models based on qso photoionization , and well before the region network has fully percolated , the ( mostly ) neutral igm between the bubbles will be photoelectrically heated to temperatures above a few hundred degrees by soft x - ray photons from the qsos . in cold dark matter ( cdm ) models a similar mechanism may efficiently warm the igm at @xmath25 , since galactic mass halos with virial temperatures @xmath26k are significant sources of thermal bremsstrahulung radiation . alternatively ,",
    "if protogalaxies at these early epochs are forming stars at a rate which is only @xmath6 of the global present - day star formation rate , heating by background ly@xmath27  continuum \" photons could drive the kinetic temperature of the still neutral material well above the radiation temperature of the microwave background . as a consequence ,",
    "we conclude that _ most of the neutral igm will be available for detection at 21-cm only in emission .",
    "_    two scenarios serve to illustrate the observability at meter wavelengths of the intergalactic medium during reionization .",
    "an isolated qso turning on in a neutral medium will create an bubble surrounded by an x - ray warmed neutral zone . sufficiently near the qso",
    ", the spin state of the neutral igm will be coupled to its kinetic state by redshifted continuum photons from the qso .",
    "this zone will then emit 21-cm radiation that would be detectable against the cbr as a differential intensity , in angle or frequency .",
    "a stronger signal may be achieved in the presence of a continuum background sufficiently strong to couple the spin temperature of the cold and neutral igm outside the qso `` sphere of influence '' to the kinetic temperature of the igm .",
    "the larger signal results from the enhanced contrast between the 21-cm absorbing medium far from the qso , and the 21-cm emitting gas in the x - ray warmed neutral zone surrounding the qso region .",
    "this phase , however , will be short - lived : through atomic recoil the background photons will soon heat the igm far from the qso to a temperature above that of the cbr , and absorption will cease .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in   2 we discuss sources of radiation at high redshift . in   3 we review the mechanisms that determine the level populations of the hyperfine state of neutral hydrogen . in   4 we treat the preheating of the igm prior to complete reionization , and",
    "show that a 21-cm absorbing igm can exist only as a transitory state . in   5",
    "we argue that the 21-cm line signature from a neutral igm , redshifted to meter wavelengths , will appear as a small feature in the radio extragalactic background on scales of @xmath28 , and may be detectable with the _ giant metrewave radio telescope_. finally , in   6 , we summarize our conclusions .",
    "in the following , we assume that the universe is completely reionized by discrete sources at @xmath29 , and that the igm at such early epochs is uniform on large scales . unless otherwise stated , we shall adopt a flat cosmology with @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "when an isolated point source of ionizing radiation turns on , the ionized volume initially grows in size at a rate fixed by the emission of uv photons , and an ionization front separating the ionized and neutral regions propagates into the neutral gas .",
    "the evolution of an expanding cosmological i - front in a uniform igm is governed by the equation @xmath32 ( shapiro 1986 ) , where @xmath33 is the proper radius of the i - front , @xmath34 is the hydrogen density of the igm , @xmath35 is the hubble constant , @xmath36 is the number of ionizing photons emitted by the central source per unit time , @xmath37  @xmath38  s@xmath39 is the recombination coefficient to the excited states of hydrogen , and @xmath40 is the gas temperature in units of @xmath41k .",
    "a helium to hydrogen cosmic abundance ratio @xmath42 is adopted , with both h and he fully ionized inside the region .",
    "the right hand side of equation  ( [ eq : dridt ] ) is a measure of the net flux of ionizing photons reaching the i - front after subtracting recombinations , and vanishes at the strmgren radius , @xmath43\\}^{1/3}$ ] .",
    "across the i - front the degree of ionization changes sharply on a distance of the order of the mean free path of an ionizing photon .",
    "denoting by @xmath44 the baryonic mass density parameter of the intergalactic medium , the i - front will expand at the speed of light @xmath45 to subsequently slow down because of geometrical dilution . in an expanding igm ,",
    "the ionization front generated by a qso , with @xmath46 , or a star - forming galaxy , with @xmath47 , will fail to grow to even half of its strmgren radius ( shapiro 1986 ; madau & meiksin 1991 ) . in this case",
    "radiative recombinations within the region may be neglected on the right - hand side of equation  ( [ eq : dridt ] ) ( proportional to @xmath48 ) , to obtain at a short time after the turn - on epoch @xmath49 ( corresponding to the redshift interval @xmath50 ) , @xmath51 and @xmath52 for comparison , the radius of the light front around each source is @xmath53      in cdm dominated cosmologies , galactic mass halos will begin to collapse at high redshift ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "the hot gas in these halos will produce a soft x - ray background radiation field via thermal bremsstrahlung .",
    "we estimate the number of halos using the press - schechter formalism ( press & schechter 1974 ) , which should suffice for an order of magnitude estimate for systems on these scales .",

    "there are four possible sources of background photons propagating into the ( mostly ) neutral material which has not yet been engulfed by an region : a ) uv , non - ionizing continuum emitted by the radiating sources and then redshifted by the hubble expansion to the wavelength in the absorbing medium rest - frame ; b ) photons generated by radiative recombinations and escaping from the regions ; c ) produced locally in the warm neutral material surrounding the ionized gas by radiative recombinations ; and d ) by collisional excitations .",

    "we demonstrate in this section that , except at very high redshifts , or in overdense regions , collisions are not effective in coupling the spin temperature to the kinetic temperature .",
    "one can show that , in the general case , the spin temperature may be written in the form ( field 1958 ) @xmath169 where @xmath170 and @xmath171 is the rate of collisional de - excitation of the triplet level ( cf .",

    "while a cold igm may be detected in absorption against the cbr , when the spin and kinetic temperatures are coupled through the wouthuysen - field mechanism , the period for which absorption is possible is short - lived .",
    "the reason is that the photons that couple the spin and kinetic temperatures will quickly heat the igm through atomic recoil to a temperature above that of the cbr . in this section",

    "contrary to the case of radiation scattered by free electrons ( where a systematic shift in frequency due to recoil can produce large cumulative effects ) , in problems of resonance - line transfer a photon on the red side of the line has a heavy bias toward scattering back to the blue .",
    "this bias suppresses the additive effect of recoil : because of doppler redistribution , a photon largely loses memory of its injection energy , and the background intensity develops only a slight asymmetry in frequency at line center ( matching the slope of the planck function in the wien limit , see field 1959b ) even at the large optical depths normally encountered in astrophysical situations .",

    ", we demonstrate here that a sufficient number of halos will collapse to provide the soft x - rays required to heat the igm to a temperature above that of the cosmic background radiation .",
    "we start with equation  ( [ eq : ehalo ] ) , which gives the background emissivity above a minimum photon energy . to specify its value",
    ", we observe that , at sufficiently low energies , the distance a photon travels before being absorbed in the igm will be shorter than the mean separation of the sources , so that only part of the igm will be penetrated by such photons .",

    "the cooling , however , may not be significant for @xmath252 before the gas is reheated by mergers in the next stage of the hierarchy . allowing the halos to provide x - ray photons for 50% of the hubble time",
    ", they will heat the igm to a temperature of @xmath253 by @xmath194 . at higher redshifts ,",
    "halo heating may still be important in overdense environments like protoclusters where the number density of halos may be substantially boosted by statistical bias ( bardeen et al . 1986 ) .",
    "of course once stars start to form , they or , more likely , their remnants may dominate the soft x - ray emission of an individual halo . in this sense , the halo emissivity calculations outlined above present a lower limit to the heating rate of the igm at early epochs .",
    "it is worth noting that while the x - rays are an efficient heating mechanism of the gas , they are an inefficient source of photoionization .",
    "this is because the time required to photoionize the igm by x - ray photons is larger by a factor of @xmath254 , since now it is the number of ionizing photons rather than their energy that counts .",
    "the ionization time thus exceeds the hubble time by a few orders of magnitude , and the igm will remain mostly neutral .      in the discussion above , we have assumed that the energy deposited by the photons is strongly coupled to the hydrogen .",

    "after these two species equilibrate , singly and doubly ionized helium follow shortly through proton scatters .",
    "note that , as the post - photoionization ( by 16 ryd soft x - rays ) temperature of electrons is @xmath26k , the time for protons to thermalize with such high energy electrons by coulomb collisions alone actually exceeds the hubble time . at these energies ,",
    "however , the primary photoelectrons will quickly cool via the production of secondary electrons by the collisional ionization and excitation of neutral hydrogen ( spitzer & scott 1969 ) .",
    "the cooling rates of an electron of energy @xmath187 ryd by these two processes are comparable , and are given by @xmath266 ( shull & van steenberg 1985 ) . for @xmath267 ,",

    "develops before the first quasars form ( if the latter require galactic - mass collapsed structures ) .",
    "this may delay the eventual percolation of regions , and increases the value of @xmath283 needed to balance recombinations and maintain full ionization .",
    "it is unlikely that clumping would change the present discussion by very much .",
    "it leaves unchanged the amount of heating and ionization due to each uv photon , as well as the rate at which the heating and ionization fronts advance around a quasar . even in an overdense region ( unless the overdensity is extreme ) , recombinations are unimportant over the lifetime of a single quasar ( or during the time it takes for the heating front to advance ) .",
    "it is also worth emphasizing that there will unavoidably be nonuniformities in the 21-cm intensity due to density inhomogeneities , but that these are restricted to smaller scales than those due to the patchy heat input ( at least in the qso case ) .",
    "while we confine our discussion to larger scales , it would nonetheless be worthwhile to consider means for their detection .    to illustrate the basic principle of the observations we propose , consider a region of neutral material with spin temperature @xmath284 , having angular size on the sky which is large compared to a beamwidth , and radial velocity extent due to the hubble expansion which is larger than the bandwidth .",
    "its intergalactic optical depth at @xmath285 cm along the line of sight , @xmath286 will typically be much less than unity .",
    "the experiment envisaged consists of two measurements , separated in either angle or frequency , such that one measurement , the fiducial , detects no line feature , either because there is no or because @xmath287 , and the second at @xmath284 .",
    "as the brightness temperature through the igm is @xmath288 , the differential antenna temperature ( which is the relevant quantity since we are considering a detector operating as a comparison system ) , observed at earth between this region and the cbr will be @xmath289 where we have defined a `` 21-cm radiation efficiency '' as @xmath290 here @xmath291 refers to the neutral fraction of the hydrogen in the region for which @xmath284 .",

    "hence the difficulty is to be able to discriminate between the igm around a qso with a brightness temperature of @xmath302 against a small fluctuation in the galactic and extragalactic background .",

    "it is less clear , however , whether or not a sufficient number of ionizing photons will be able to penetrate all of the surrounding neutral gas in the cloud to reach the external intergalactic gas and ionize it .",
    "nonetheless , the stars will still produce a background of uv continuum photons near the frequency which can escape .",
    "it is therefore of interest to consider a case in which qsos turn on in a universe where the scattering rate is @xmath304 everywhere , i.e. , where @xmath305 ( cf .",

    "the 30 antennas of the gmrt will be configured as a y of 16 dishes with a central compact core of 14 dishes . because the gmrt functions as an interferometer , it is insensitive to angular scales exceeding @xmath341 , where @xmath342 is the separation of the dishes . if we wish to measure @xmath224 degree - scale structures at @xmath11mhz ( @xmath343 m ) , the projected separation of antennas is required to be about @xmath344 m .",
    "since the gmrt antennas have a diameter of about 45@xmath22 m , the gmrt interferometric system will not be sensitive to 2 degree - scale structures as the antennas will start shadowing each other for projected spacings less than 45@xmath22 m .",
    "an alternative strategy is to measure the total power by incoherent addition of the outputs of the 30 gmrt antennas , for which the effective collecting area will be @xmath345 that of one antenna . for observations at 150@xmath22mhz the theoretical rms thermal noise of the gmrt output in incoherent mode is @xmath346mjy for the following parameters : @xmath347k , @xmath348m@xmath349 for 1 45-m dish , a bandwidth of @xmath8 ( 5@xmath22mhz ) , and 5-hr integration for each of the 2 frequency bands separated by about 5@xmath22mhz ( swarup & malik 1996 ) .",
    "a comparison with equation  ( [ eq : ds ] ) shows that @xmath350 hours of integration will be required to detect an individual shell at 5@xmath351 .",
    "this time is comparable to that proposed for searches for emission from collapsing clouds at high redshift ( swarup 1991 ; subramanian & padmanabhan 1993 ; swarup 1996 ) .",
    "however , it is not clear whether the above sensitivity can be realized in practice because of the man - made noise and variations of the instrumental gain and the galactic background temperature over 2 bands separated by 5@xmath22mhz .",
    "note that , although the differential antenna temperature will be larger at earlier epochs because of the larger brightness constrast ( i.e. , less time to raise the temperature of the cold phase ) , the smaller radius of the qso sphere of influence more than cancels the increase in emission efficiency .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio improves slightly with increasing bubble size .    to calculate the expected number of emitting shells in a radio survey",
    ", we may estimate their effective covering factor on the sky as @xmath352 where @xmath353 is the ( proper ) number density of quasars , @xmath354 is is the angular - diameter distance , @xmath355 is the field of view of the radio antenna ( about 3.1 degrees at 150 mhz ) , and @xmath336 measures the radial dimension covered by the survey .",
    "if the latter matches the shell thickness @xmath356 , e.g. , for a bandwidth of @xmath339mhz , the covering factor may be rewritten as @xmath357 where @xmath358 is the volume filling factor of the 21-cm emitting bubbles .",
    "as @xmath359 , it follows from equation  ( [ eq : cov ] ) that a shell will be detected after scanning about 20 fields with the gmrt if the filling factor of warm bubbles is @xmath360% .",
    "we shall now analyze the model problem of an individual , isolated qso turning on at epoch @xmath0 in an otherwise unperturbed igm . in this case",
    "the only radiative coupling agent is the continuum uv radiation of the quasar itself , redshifted to . from equations ( [ eq : plpalpha ] ) and ( [ eq : ptherm ] ) , it is useful to define a `` thermalization distance '' from a qso , denoted by @xmath361 , at which @xmath154 .",
    "numerically , this yields @xmath362 for the best case of @xmath150 , the efficiency for 21-cm emission may be expressed , using equations  ( [ eq : ya ] ) , ( [ eq : ftspin ] ) , ( [ eq : ptherm ] ) , and ( [ eq : eff ] ) , as @xmath363 . at @xmath364 , @xmath365 .",
    "comparison with equation  ( [ eq : rieq ] ) shows that the thermalization distance is comparable to the size of the region .",
    "since @xmath366 is required for detection , @xmath367 may be achieved only for a brief redshift interval after the quasar turns on .",
    "this interval is so small for many quasars that their regions will still be in the luminal expansion stage ( cf .",
    "equation  [ [ eq : rcrit ] ] ) , so that they will not be preceded by a warming front and will thus not be visible in 21-cm emission .",
    "the efficiency will therefore generally lie in the range @xmath368 .",
    "larger shells offer a slight advantage for detectability .",
    "this is because the flux of a shell emitting 21-cm radiation depends not only on its efficiency but on its size as well .",
    "the frequency integrated flux is proportional to @xmath369 consider a measurement made at a frequency corresponding to a depth in the emitting zone around the quasar just outside the i - front , and with a bandwidth @xmath370 matched to the light radius @xmath371 . denoting by @xmath372 the angle on the sky subtended by @xmath361 , integrating equation  ( [ eq : oeff ] ) out to @xmath371 , using the expression above for @xmath373 , gives @xmath374 $ ] , when @xmath375 .",
    "while the signal increases initially like the cube of the size of the emitting region , it does so only linearly at later times . since the noise increases like @xmath376 , the signal - to - noise ratio increases asymptotically only like @xmath377 .",
    "allowing for a light radius that subtends an angle @xmath378 on the sky of @xmath379 , the flux is then @xmath380 over a bandwidth of @xmath381^{-1/2 } ( \\theta_c/1^\\circ)$ ] , comparable to the rms noise .",
    "it would thus take a few hundred hours of integration time on the gmrt to detect the shell at @xmath382 .",
    "a quicker strategy may be to search for an excess variance across the sky over the rms noise that these shells would produce in the observed flux per resolution ( beamwidth@xmath383bandwidth ) element .",
    "a next generation facility like the _ square kilometer array interferometer _ ( braun 1996 ) could easily map warm igm bubbles , effectively opening much of the universe to a direct study of the reheating epoch .",
    "the spectral appearance at 21-cm of non - uniform gas at high-@xmath49 had been previously investigated by hogan & rees ( 1979 ) and scott & rees ( 1990 ) .",
    "these earlier papers showed that the 21-cm emission from high-@xmath49 may display angular structure , as well as structure in redshift space ; radio observations could therefore in principle yield `` tomographic '' mapping of protoclusters or other large - scale inhomogeneities at high redshifts , where the gas had not yet been reionized .",
    "the present work discusses how similar techniques may be used to reveal `` patchiness '' in the 21-cm emission due to non - uniformities in the spin temperature , rather than in the density .",
    "such effects could tell us how ( as well as when ) the primordial gas was reheated ; if the reheating were due to ultraluminous but sparsely distributed sources ( e.g. , the first qsos ) , the resultant patches would have a larger scale than any gravitationally - induced inhomogeneities , and would therefore be less difficult to detect . the continuum radiation , redshifted to , from an early generation of stars would couple the spin temperature to the low temperature of the igm for a transitory interval before heating the gas above the cbr temperature .",
    "the result is a `` window of opportunity '' during which it may be possible to detect the igm in absorption against the cbr , and in so doing possibly reveal the first epoch of star formation .",
    "we have assessed three preheating mechanisms at early times : soft x - ray radiation from quasar sources , soft x - rays from virialized @xmath3 halos , and resonant scattering of background continuum photons from an early generation of stars , and argued that radiation sources at high redshifts may prevent collapsing structures that can not cool efficiently from being detected in 21-cm absorption against the microwave background .",
    "we have shown that scattering of continuum radiation can mix the hyperfine levels of intergalactic within @xmath384mpc of an individual qso , and that this will produce an appreciable 21-cm emissivity from the igm in the quasar neighborhood .",
    "while the x - ray - heated bubbles will still survive as fossils , once the quasar has died , the photons will rapidly adiabatically redshift out of resonance so that no emission will occur without an external supply of photons .",
    "if reionization occurred at redshift @xmath12 , these qso spheres of influence might be detectable at meter wavelengths by the gmrt . because of the very large scales involved , there is no difficulty in achieving a sufficiently narrow bandwidth and an adequate angular resolution with the gmrt ; the main limitations are the low flux levels and the radio background subtraction .",
    "it is possible that both the reionization and heating of the igm were due to an early population of stars on subgalactic scales ( rather than quasars ) at redshift @xmath16 , well beyond the reach of the gmrt .",
    "even if they reionized the igm at an epoch accessible to the gmrt , however , these sources would be less thinly spread , and the characteristic structures in the igm generated by them would be smaller and less detectable , so that an alternative observing strategy than the one discussed here would be required .",
    "we acknowledge helpful conversations on the subject of this paper with p. palmer , l. spitzer , m. voit , w. watson , and m. white .",
    "we thank the referee , g. swarup , for valuable comments which helped to clarify the detectability of a neutral igm with the gmrt . p.m. and a.m.",
    "were supported in part by nsf grant phy94 - 07194 to the itp , university of california , santa barbara .",
    "a.m. is also grateful to the w. gaertner fund for its support .",
    "thanks the royal society for support .",
    "we evaluate the flux produced in the neutral outside an ionization front from recombinations within the region itself .",
    "the volume emissivity is given by @xmath385 where @xmath386 is the effective recombination coefficient to the @xmath387 level ( pengelly 1964 ) .",
    "integrating from just outside the ionization front into the region , and averaging over @xmath388 sr , we get @xmath389 ( with @xmath390 , @xmath391 , and including an additional factor of @xmath392 since photons arise only from within the region ) . in evaluating the integral , we relate the distance @xmath393 from the ionization front to the frequency shift @xmath394 from line center ( in units of the thermal width ) due to the hubble expansion , by @xmath395 , where @xmath396 is the doppler parameter .",
    "because emission at line center is quickly redshifted out of the core , only the surface of the region contributes to the flux .",
    "the resulting intensity can be expressed as @xmath397 the recombination photons escaping from an expanding region produce then only a small flux of photons .    for completeness",
    ", we shall also compute the contribution from the local production of photons in the warm ( mostly ) neutral material surrounding the ionized gas .",
    "as photons are redshifted out of the doppler core by the hubble expansion , the local background intensity becomes @xmath398 @xmath399 @xmath400 @xmath401 @xmath402 $ ] , where @xmath403 ( osterbrock 1989 ) is the collisional excitation rate of photons by electron impacts , and the last term accounts for collisional excitations from the nonthermal distribution of electrons generated by the soft x - rays .",
    "the factor @xmath404 ( shull & van steenberg 1985 ) represents the net fraction of photon energy converted to photons . for a temperature of @xmath405 and allowing ( optimistically ) for @xmath406 ,",
    "radiative recombinations dominate , and @xmath407 recombinations and collisional excitations in a warm , largely neutral medium are therefore a negligible source of photons .",
    "we derive the rate of transfer of energy , equation  ( [ eq : edot ] ) , from the radiation field to the atoms through recoil using the equation of radiative transfer . neglecting expansion and source terms ,",
    "the rate of change of the number density of photons in a given frequency band @xmath408 for an isotropic radiation field was shown by basko ( 1981 ) to be given in the diffusion approximation by @xmath409 , \\eqno({\\rm b1})\\ ] ] where @xmath410 is the number density of hydrogen atoms in the ground state , @xmath411 expresses the effect of recoil , and only terms of order @xmath412 have been retained .",
    "this is only correct as long as @xmath413 .",
    "note that , in a steady state , @xmath414 $ ] near the resonant frequency , as was first demonstrated by field ( 1959b ) .",
    "the rate of change of energy in the radiation field due to recoil is then @xmath415 performing the integration by parts , noting that @xmath416 is sharply peaked at the resonant frequency , using @xmath417 , and setting @xmath418 , we recover equation  ( [ eq : edot ] ) of the text .",
    "this result is valid in the presence of expansion and source terms as well , as may be shown from the generalization of equation ( b1 ) by rybicki & dellantonio ( 1994 ) .",
    "we note that , to order @xmath412 , the flow of energy is one - directional , from the radiation field to the atoms . treating the reverse flow",
    "requires the inclusion of terms of order @xmath419 ( including relativistic effects like aberration ) .",
    "we have also neglected stimulated emission .",
    "these effects become particularly important when the matter approaches thermal equilibrium with the radiation field . in this limit",
    ", the radiation field relaxes to a blackbody spectrum , and the net transfer of energy ceases . in the situations relevant to this paper ,",
    "these effects are negligible ."
