    "a fundamental problem in finance , economics and management science is to determine the optimal time to invest in a project in a random environment and to address these types of problems the theory of discretionary stopping has been widely employed following karlin  @xcite .    in order to solve some problems of this type we fix a filtered probability space , @xmath1 , satisfying the usual conditions and carrying a standard one - dimensional @xmath2-brownian motion , @xmath3 .",
    "we assume that the stochastic system we study is driven by the it diffusion given by the stochastic differential equation @xmath4 and the functions @xmath5 satisfy assumptions [ a1][a2 ] .",
    "our objective is to select the @xmath2-stopping - time , @xmath6 , that maximises @xmath7 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is subject to the conditions in assumption [ a4 ] and @xmath9 is a state - dependent discounting factor defined by @xmath10 for some function @xmath0 satisfying the conditions of assumption [ a3 ] .",
    "the majority of financial and economic models in the literature assume that the underlying asset s value dynamics are modelled by a geometric brownian motion , the associated payoff function is affine and the discounting rate is constant .",
    "the approach we employ relaxes all these assumptions .",
    "considering more general payoff functions allows for utility based decision making , which , apart from the work of henderson and hobson  @xcite , and despite its fundamental importance , has not been widely discussed",
    ".    however , the main benefit of accommodating general payoffs in the modelling framework is the ability to incorporate compound payoffs into the payoff function , such as running payoffs or reversible decisions , as in johnson and zervos  @xcite or guo and tomecek  @xcite .",
    "for example , consider the case where a project is initiated at a cost @xmath11 and provides a running payoff given by @xmath12 . in this case",
    "we have that @xmath13 , \\label{init}\\ ] ] for a stopping - time @xmath14 . here , for example , @xmath15 could represent the demand for electricity and @xmath16 is the ` stack ' , a discontinuous function , representing the price of supplying the demand , or @xmath15 could be the value of an asset that is taxed at banded rates , modelled by @xmath17 and @xmath16 . in both these , practically important , cases @xmath8 will not be @xmath18 and the classical approach to solving stopping problems using variational inequalities can not be used .",
    "the framework we present accommodates systems driven by general it diffusions .",
    "this is essential in economics given that not all asset price processes should be modelled by a geometric brownian motion , which , on average , grows exponentially . beyond decisions driven by prices , extending the theory to a wider class of diffusions is important , for example in regime switching models such as in dai , zhang and zhu  @xcite where the driving stochastic process represents a probability that the market is a bull or bear , and @xmath190,1[$ ] .",
    "employing state dependent discounting enables a more realistic modelling framework for investment decisions in the presence of default risk and the events following 2007 have highlighted the importance of including this feature in decision making .",
    "one approach to addressing discretionary stopping problems is through dynamic programming and involves a set of variational inequalities .",
    "this is discussed by , amongst many others , el - karoui  @xcite , krylov  @xcite , bensoussan and lions  @xcite , davis and karatzas  @xcite , and guo and shepp  @xcite .",
    "the technique has become widespread in finance and economics since the introduction of so - called ` real options ' theory by mcdonald and siegel  @xcite , and has been described in merton  @xcite , dixit and pindyck  @xcite and trigorgis  @xcite . however , taking this approach often involves making strong assumptions about the problem data in order to obtain explicit results .",
    "a different approach has been to employ @xmath20-excessive functions , functions that satisfy @xmath21,\\quad\\textrm{for } x\\in{\\mathcal{i}}.\\ ] ] this approach has been adopted by dynkin  @xcite , shiryaev  @xcite , salminen  @xcite , alvarez  @xcite and lempa  @xcite , while dayanik and karatzas  @xcite and dayanik  @xcite use a certain characterisation of @xmath20-excessive functions , as the difference of two convex functions , to solve the stopping problem .",
    "these techniques , while powerful , are technical and are less accessible to a general audience in finance and economics unfamiliar with the details of probability theory .",
    "another approach uses martingale theory to locate the optimal boundaries between the stopping and continuation regions and is taken by , for example , beibel and lerche ( @xcite ,  @xcite ) , lerche and urusov  @xcite , and christensen and irle  @xcite and is described informally in shreve  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* sec 8.3.2 ) .",
    "this approach , while relatively straightforward , is based on assuming the diffusion starts in the continuation region and considers the first time it hits the stopping region .",
    "however , as well as relying on the explicit problem data , this approach depends on the continuation region existing and an intuitive understanding of where it is located .    the approach we adopt is based on the familiar dynamic programming approach while providing the power of the probabilistic techniques .",
    "the connection between the different approaches is provided by johnson and zervos  @xcite , where the it - tanaka - meyer formula is used to analyse the solution to the variational inequality as the difference of two convex functions , rather than as a function in @xmath18 . in using this result , the strong assumptions associated with the dynamic programming framework can be relaxed and explicit solutions that rely , only , on the problem data can be easily obtained .",
    "this approach has been taken in rschendorf and urusov  @xcite , lamberton  @xcite , johnson and zervos  @xcite and has been developed fully in lamberton and zervos  @xcite .",
    "the contribution of this paper is to demonstrate how the general theory , developed in lamberton and zervos  @xcite , can be applied to obtain explicit solutions to a variety of discretionary stopping problems .",
    "this paper is organised as follows .",
    "section [ problem ] is concerned with a formulation of the optimal stopping problem and a set of assumptions for our problem to be well - posed while in section [ implications ] we discuss the practical implications of these assumptions . in section [ soln ]",
    "we present the methodology for identifying the boundaries for six ` elementary ' problems and then , in section [ ex ] , we demonstrate how these ` elementary ' problems can be employed in solving more complex stopping problems . an appendix provides a proof of a key result in solving the problem when a continuation region lies between two stopping regions .",
