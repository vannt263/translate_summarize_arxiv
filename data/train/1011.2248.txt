    "together with other pertinent yet independent diagnostics and constraints , observations of various molecular emission spectral line profiles , especially those with high enough spatial and frequency resolutions and/or different line transitions of the same molecules , make it possible to identify the gross hydrodynamic and thermodynamic structures of star - forming molecular clouds with grossly spherical morphologies .",

    "any of such separate observational diagnostics may be fitted with empirical and parametrized models on an individual basis to various extents as can be found in the literature .",
    "in contrast and in order to remove potential model degeneracies , our strategy is to constrain the underlying cloud model using the hydrodynamics and by all available observational data simultaneously .",
    "we also make model predictions for specific observational tests .",
    "we mainly focus on those molecular clouds which appear grossly spherical as our spherically symmetric hydrodynamics represents a first - order approximation in that direction . for illustration",
    ", we choose the molecular cloud core fest 1 - 457 for specific observational comparisons .",
    "we also summarize the main results of our model comparisons with several observations for another star - forming cloud core l1517b as supporting evidence .",
    "regarding the molecular line diagnostics , there are two major asymmetric double - peak molecular spectral line profiles oft - observed in star - forming clouds , viz . , the so - called ` blue profiles ' with stronger blue - shifted peaks than red - shifted peaks and the so - called ` red profiles ' with stronger red - shifted peaks than blue - shifted peaks .",
    "the level of such spectral line profile asymmetries can change in a gradual manner for spatially - resolved observations . while the observed ` blue profiles ' of molecular spectral lines are modelled and generally interpreted as characteristic signatures of radial infalls in molecular clouds @xcite , the somewhat ignored yet wide presence of unexplained ` red profiles ' ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "for the possible interpretation of ` red profiles ' of molecular spectral lines alone , one may think of several mechanisms , e.g. rotations ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) , bipolar outflows inclined close to the plane of the sky ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) , turbulence ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) and thermal pulsations ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .    for fest 1 - 457 ( see fig .",

    ". a global cloud core rotation of fest 1 - 457 may be excluded by spatially - resolved spectral line observations ; i.e. , the currently data do not show such evidence . at present , these mechanisms just mentioned have not been shown to also account for cloud density profiles and radial profiles of ( sub)millimetre continuum emissions simultaneously within a consistent model framework .",
    "alternatively , it was suggested that ` red profiles ' in certain star - forming sources may be caused by clouds involving eecc @xcite .",
    "it is thus crucial to reproduce the observed ` red profiles ' using our general polytropic eecc shock models via radiative transfer calculations @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , we require the model density profile to be consistent with the observational inference of dust extinctions and further predict other spectral line profiles as well as radial profiles of ( sub)millimetre continuum emissions as future observational tests .",
    "four main contributions of our model analysis in this paper are as follows .",
    "first , for the grossly spherical molecular cloud core fest 1 - 457 , we construct a self - similar general polytropic hydrodynamic eecc shock model @xcite , and radiative transfer calculations are performed to reproduce the observed ` red profiles ' and other spectral profiles of molecular transition lines in the cloud core .",
    "secondly , we advance the conceptual framework of constraining the molecular cloud dynamics using several available diagnostics simultaneously in order to solve this challenging issue in molecular astronomy . for fest 1 - 457 ,",
    "the column density profile of our eecc shock dynamics is also sensibly fitted with the observationally inferred column density profile by the dust extinction data ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "thirdly , while no data for ( sub)millimetre continua are available for fest 1 - 457 at present , for scenario consistency and further observational tests , we predict radio continuum emissions at three wavelengths of 1.2 mm , 0.85 mm and 0.45 mm . for the same reason , the spatially - resolved spectral profiles of molecular line transitions hco@xmath1 ( j@xmath5 ) and cs ( j@xmath5 ) are also predicted for observational tests .",

    "that is why optically thick lines are more sensitive diagnostics of hydrodynamic structures in molecular clouds .",
    "the dust extinction observation of fest 1 - 457 of @xcite represents an important observational constraint to the model description of this molecular cloud core .",
    "we infer from fig . 2 of @xcite that the cloud core fest 1 - 457 appears grossly spherical , yet with slight asymmetry towards the lower right corner .",
    "this asymmetry in the dust extinction observation coincides with the differences shown in spectral line profile model fittings as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : hco ] and [ fig : csfit ] .",
    "all these available observations might imply that there exists some kind of beamed outflows towards the lower right direction in fest 1 - 457 , in addition to an almost spherically symmetric cloud core .",
    "as the deviation of molecular lines in this part of the cloud core is toward red - shifted in the order of @xmath126 ( see figs .",
    "[ fig : hco ] and [ fig : csfit ] ) , we estimate that a beamed slow outflow may recede from us with a typical speed of @xmath126 . as a further consistent model check ,",
    "we compute the radial profile of column density using the same eecc shock dynamic model and compare it with that inferred from the dust extinction data for fest 1 - 457 @xcite .",
    "as the column density data has a spatial resolution of @xmath127 , our computed model profile is derived from the same eecc shock dynamic model with a convolution in @xmath127 and shows a sensibly good fit ( the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : continuum ] ) .",
    "as the radial profile of column density is sensitive to the outer radius @xmath128 of the molecular cloud core and to the cloud number density @xmath129 , this fit identifies a proper outer radius @xmath128 and the molecular hydrogen h@xmath49 number density scale ( see eqn ( [ equ : scale2 ] ) ) .",
    "the outer radius of fest 1 - 457 used in the column density fit is @xmath130  au , which is also used in molecular spectral line profile fits and appears consistent with that from the optical images @xcite at the same time . in short , the inferred variation trend of column density",
    "offers a constraint on a proper eecc shock dynamic phase with a grossly self - consistent radial density profile .    in previous publications ( e.g. * ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) regarding the column density structure of molecular clouds , researchers normally use a power - law radial density distribution or a static bonnor - ebert sphere @xcite etc . to describe density distributions within observed molecular clouds",
    "these empirical / theoretical models also appear to provide reasonable fits to the observationally inferred radial column density distributions , but none of them have been shown to successfully account for the observed molecular spectral line profiles from those molecular clouds , except that additional parameterized conditions are introduced ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in contrast , our theoretical cloud models involving proper hydrodynamic flows and with self - consistent radial temperature variations can give rise to asymmetric molecular line profiles @xcite . according to the bonnor - ebert sphere model fits to a group of cloud cores in @xcite ,",
    "most of those best - fit static spheres are actually unstable bonnor - ebert spheres , implying that these molecular cloud cores are most likely undergoing hydrodynamic evolution in reality .",
    "another data analysis by @xcite on massive quiescent cores in the orion molecular cloud , gives a similar result that most of the cloud cores are unstable , if modelled as static bonnor - ebert spheres .",
    "all these results hint that we do need a theoretical model formulation for the hydrodynamic evolution of cloud cores .",
    "that is , the spectral line profiles and dust emission data fitting are not inconsistent with our eecc dynamic shock model .",
    "essentially similar problems also exist in the model fits of dust continuum emission observations described immediately below . therefore to be consistently constrained by all available observations ,",
    "we explore the polytropic eecc hydrodynamic shock model here for the molecular cloud core fest 1 - 457 .",
    "radial profiles of ( sub)millimetre continua at three wavelengths can be also computed using the ratran code to further check the consistency for the density and temperature radial structures of cloud cores . for these testable observations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for other cloud systems ) , we specifically predict such continuum radial profiles at three wavelengths of 1.2  mm , 0.85  mm and 0.45  mm using the same underlying eecc hydrodynamic shock model for fest 1 - 457 .",
    "modelling such dust continuum emissions as optically thin with a constant dust opacity @xmath131 in @xmath21 at a specified frequency @xmath92 , the observed intensity at an impact parameter @xmath132 is @xcite given by @xmath133 where @xmath134 is the dust temperature taken to be the same as the h@xmath49 gas temperature @xmath135 , @xmath136 is the mass density of h@xmath49 molecules and @xmath137 is the planck function .",
    "the opacity @xmath131 is that of @xcite dust model for bare ice mantles with a growth time of @xmath111 yr .",
    "as usual , a h@xmath49 gas to dust mass ratio 100 to 1 is adopted in our model computations . with the dust temperature and density profiles from the eecc hydrodynamic shock model ,",
    "we obtain radial profiles for 1.2  mm , 0.85  mm and 0.45 mm continuum intensities .",
    "results shown in the bottom panel of fig . [",
    "fig : continuum ] are convolved with a telescope beam size of @xmath138 and a beam efficiency of @xmath139 .",
    "error ranges of millimetre continuum intensities are estimated by the root - mean - square ( rms ) errors in the column density observation ( the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : continuum ] ) , through the relation @xmath140 .",
    "the abrupt ` kink ' at @xmath141 from the centre reveals shock discontinuities of density and temperature in the eecc shock model ( see the middle and bottom panels in fig .",
    "[ fig : dynamics ] ) , and should be detectable with high enough spatial resolutions .",
    "we have presented model results pertinent to three complementary observational aspects towards the dark molecular globule fest 1 - 457 ; fairly reasonable fittings to asymmetric ` red profiles ' and to the column density radial profile derived from dust extinction data indicate that this dark globule most likely involve an early eecc shock phase of dynamic cloud evolution , while our predictions for spatially - resolved grid - maps for hco@xmath124 j@xmath5 and cs j@xmath5 respectively as well as the three predicted millimetre continuum radial profiles can be specifically tested by future observations .",
    "the choice of our model parameter set is determined by an extensive exploration and known quantitative as well as qualitative constraints .",
    "slight adjustment around this chosen model parameter set is allowed for a refined improvement of fitting .",
    "although without a rigorous proof , it would be surprising that a dramatically different model parameter set could reproduce all the available observational data so far .",
    "in addition to the spherical global eecc dynamics , line profile and extinction observations might also suggest a slow beamed outflow receding from us at a typical speed of @xmath142 towards the lower right direction in the grid - maps .",
    "the inferred underlying eecc hydrodynamic shock model provides physical parameters for fest 1 - 457 cloud core .",
    "the central protostellar mass blob and the total mass of the cloud core are @xmath143 and @xmath144 , respectively ; the central protostellar mass accretion rate is @xmath145 ( see eq ( [ equ : massaccretion ] ) ) ; the dynamical timescale of the cloud core fest 1 - 457 is estimated as @xmath82 accordingly ( see expression ( [ equ : scale2 ] ) ) . as",
    "an expanding shock travels through the molecular cloud core , abundance differences of certain tracer molecules ( e.g. ch@xmath87oh and sio ) across the shock front ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) could be detectable .    as a strong supporting evidence to the present case of fest 1 - 457 ,",
    "a parallel theoretical model analysis on another star - forming molecular cloud core l1517b has also been conducted and completed recently @xcite .",
    "several molecular line transitions of l1517b also manifest red asymmetric line profiles . on the basis of a shocked eecc similarity hydrodynamic model , several single point central molecular emission lines of hco@xmath1(@xmath146 ) , hco@xmath1(@xmath147 ) , h@xmath148co@xmath1(@xmath146 ) , dco@xmath1(@xmath147 ) , h@xmath49co(@xmath149 ) , h@xmath49co(@xmath150 ) , cs(@xmath151 ) , cs(@xmath147 ) , so(@xmath152 ) , and so(@xmath153 ) from the source l1517b [ observed by 13.7  m telescope of the five college radio astronomical observatory ( fcrao ) and iram 30  m telescope ]",

    ", we are fairly confident that the cloud core l1517b appears to be another cloud core that evolves in the eecc shock phase . similar to what we have done for fest 1 - 457 here ,",
    "predictions of several other spatially - resolved molecular transition lines , the radial profile of 450  @xmath48 m continuum emission , and visual extinction ( all based on the same eecc hydrodynamic shock model ) are also presented for further observational tests of the model description of l1517b ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "we speculate that other starless cores of grossly spherical molecular clouds with ` red profiles ' might also involve eecc hydrodynamic shock phase in general .",
    "more sources need to be search and established by systematic model analysis and data comparisons .",
