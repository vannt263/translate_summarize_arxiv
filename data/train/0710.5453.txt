    "moreover , the integral groups `` without denominators '' are only meaningful in the presence of a regular model @xmath23 of @xmath22 , not just a regular alteration .",
    "for completeness , let us first recall what happens when @xmath71 . in this case , the localisation sequence of @xmath12-theory shows that @xmath72 and @xmath73 are equal ; this group is @xmath74 , the chow group of codimension @xmath18 cycles on @xmath22 . in this case",

    "since @xmath85 vanishes for @xmath86 , we assume henceforth that @xmath87 .    for the moment suppose that we are in setting ( i ) .",

    "@xcite ) . since by definition",
    "the corresponding identity holds for @xmath10 , the comparison between @xmath63 and @xmath10 is reduced to the local case .",
    "we also recall that both the integrality and the unramified conditions are stable under finite extensions @xmath93 : under the inclusion @xmath94 one has @xmath95 which for @xmath10 is clear from the definition , and for @xmath63 follows from @xcite .    for the rest of the paper we will assume that we are in the local case ( ii ) :",
    "thus @xmath2 is local , with valuation ring @xmath3 and finite residue field @xmath96 , and write @xmath97 as usual .",
    "let @xmath98 be proper and flat , with special fibre @xmath99 and generic fibre @xmath100 .",

    ".    for @xmath22 a product of curves , theorem [ thm : main ] therefore shows that :    * in the region @xmath136 , one has @xmath137 ( for this the compatibility [ prop : compat3 ] is not needed , only the computations on the special fibre at the end of this section ) ; and * along the lines @xmath138 and @xmath139 the integrality conditions ( which are in general non - trivial ) coincide .",

    ". then @xmath161 .",
    "the hypothesis that @xmath150 is injective would be a consequence of jannsen s generalisation of the tate conjecture :    [ conj : gentate ] if @xmath122 is proper over a finite field @xmath96 , of dimension @xmath162 , then frobenius acts semisimply on the @xmath32-adic homology of @xmath163 , and for every @xmath164 and @xmath165 the riemann - roch transformation is an isomorphism @xmath166    as is shown in @xcite , this is equivalent to standard conjectures for @xmath12-theory of nonsingular varieties over finite fields :    [ conj : parshin ] let @xmath122 be proper and smooth over a finite field @xmath96 .    * the action of @xmath167 on @xmath168 is semisimple . *",
