    "when discovering the universe and its properties we are always interested in knowing absolutes . for example , it is of astronomical interest to calculate how many stars are in our galaxy , how many planets are surrounding these stars ( fressin et al . 2013 ) , the total mass density of the universe ( e.g. , fukugita & peebles 2004 ) , amongst other absolutes in the universe s properties .",
    "one of these that has only been answered in a rough way is the total number density evolution of galaxies , and thus also the total number of galaxies in the universe .",
    "this question is not only of passing interest as a curiosity , but is also connected to many other questions in cosmology and astronomy .",
    "the evolution of the number densities of galaxies relates to issues such as galaxy formation / evolution through the number of systems formed , the evolution of the ratio of giant galaxies to dwarf galaxies , the distant supernova and gamma - ray burst rate , the star formation rate of the universe , and how new galaxies are created / destroyed through mergers ( e.g. , bridge et al .",
    "2007 ; lin et al . 2008 ; jogee et al . 2009",
    "; conselice et al . 2011 ; bluck et al . 2012 ; conselice 2014 ; ownsworth et al .",
    "the number of galaxies in the observable universe also divulges information about the mass density of the universe , background light at various wavelengths , as well as insights into olbers paradox .",
    "however , there still does not yet exist a good measurement for this fundamental quantity .",
    "understanding the co - moving number density evolution of galaxies has only been possible in any meaningful way since deep imaging with telescopes began with the advent of ccd cameras .",
    "deep surveys to search for distant galaxies started in the 1990s ( e.g. , koo & kron 1992 ; steidel & hamilton 1992 ; djorgovski et al .",
    "1995 ) , and reached our current depths after deep hubble space telescope imaging campaigns were carried out , especially within the hubble deep field ( williams et al .",
    "this was later expanded to other deep fields such as the hubble deep field south ( williams et al .",
    "2000 ) , the great observatories origins survey ( giavalisco et al . 2004 ) , and the near - infrared candels fields ( grogin et al . 2011 ) , and finally to the hubble ultra deep field ( beckwith et al .",
    "2006 ) which remains the deepest image in the optical and near - infrared of our universe taken to date .",
    "however , despite these surveys it is still uncertain how the total number density of galaxies evolves over time .",
    "this is an interesting question as we know that the star formation rate rises , and then declines at @xmath9 ( e.g. , bouwens et al .",
    "2009 ; duncan et al . 2014",
    "; madau & dickinson 2014 ) , while at the same time galaxies become larger and less peculiar ( e.g. , conselice et al .",
    "2004 ; papovich et al . 2005 ; buitrago et al . 2013 ; mortlock et al . 2013 ; lee et al . 2013 ; conselice 2014 ; boada et al .",
    "however , we do not know how the total number of galaxies at a given epoch evolves , and how this is associated with the general formation of the galaxy population as a whole .",
    "there are a few reasons for why deep imaging programs are not easily able to convert observations to total numbers of galaxies .",
    "one of these issues is that all deep observations are incomplete .",
    "this is due to limitations in exposure times and depth such that certain galaxies will be detected more readily than other galaxies .",
    "the result of this is an incompleteness down to the magnitude limit of even the deepest surveys , which can be corrected for , but which still leaves some uncertainty .",
    "however , the more important issue is that these observations do not reach the faintest galaxies , although from number density fits and theory we know that there should be many more faint galaxies beyond our current observational limits .    it is also important to address what we mean by the total number density of galaxies in the universe .",
    "this is not a simple quantity to define as the total number density which exists now , the total number density which is observable in principle , and the total number density which is observable with current technology , are all different questions with different answers .",
    "there is also the issue that we are limited by the cosmological horizon over what we can observe , and therefore there are galaxies we can not see beyond it .",
    "even the number of galaxies which exist in the universe today , i.e. , if we could view the entire universe as is , and not be limited by light travel time , is a complicated question . galaxies in the distant universe have evolved beyond what we can currently observe due to the finite nature of the speed of light , and presumably would look similar to those in the local universe .",
    "we address these issues in the paper .",
    "our default and ultimate total number density of galaxies we investigate in this paper is how the number density evolves within the current observable universe up to @xmath10 .    for comparison purposes ,",
    "we also carry out an analysis in the appendix of the number of galaxies which are visible to modern telescopes , at all wavelengths , that we can currently observe .",
    "we then compare this to measurements of the total number that actually can be potentially observed in the universe based on measured mass functions .",
    "we also discuss how these results reveal information concerning galaxy evolution and background light .",
    "we also give indications for future surveys and what fraction of galaxies these will observe .",
    "this paper is divided up into several sections .",
    " 2 describes the data we use throughout this analysis , ",
    "3 describes the results of this paper including using fits of galaxy stellar mass functions to derive the total number of galaxies which are in the universe .",
    " 4 describes the implications of these results and  5 is a summary . throughout this paper",
    "we use a standard cosmology of h@xmath11 km s@xmath12 mpc@xmath12 , and @xmath13 = 0.3 .",
    "the data we use for this paper come from many sources , and results from previous papers . in the appendix",
    "we describe how many galaxies we can actually observe at present in the universe , based on the deepest observations yet available . here in the main paper",
    "we address the question of how many galaxies are potentially detectable within the universe if deep imaging , over all wavelengths , could be carried out in every location of the sky without any interference from the galaxy , or other contamination .    to 85 mm        [ sample - figure ]    for the bulk analysis and results of this paper",
    "we utilize mass functions of galaxies from the local universe up until @xmath10 to determine how the number density of galaxies evolves with time and redshift .",
    "these mass and luminosity functions are now just starting to be measured at high redshfits , and our primary data originates from mass functions calculated using deep and wide near - infrared and optical surveys with hubble and ground based telescopes .",
    "as described in the next section , the mass functions we utilize are from perez - gonzalez et al .",

    "( 2014 ) and song et al .",
    "we normalize all of these mass functions for each survey based on the salpeter initial mass function ( imf ) for stars between 0.1 and 100 .",
    "we also use only the co - moving number densities from these mass functions , using co - moving volumes , as opposed to physical volumes .",
    "this tells us how the number of galaxies is evolving in the same effective volume , with the effects of the hubble expansion removed .",
    "these mass functions are shown in figure  1 down to the mass limit in which they are complete based on all of these various surveys , which are also listed in table  1 .",
    "the primary method we use to determine the number densities of galaxies in the universe is to integrate through the fitted mass functions the number of galaxies which are at a given redshift .",
    "this requires extrapolating fitted stellar mass functions to reach down to a low mass limit of the galaxy population .",
    "there are many ways in which this can be done which we discuss below .",
    "one of the most important questions is the lower limit at which we should count galaxies from the mass functions . due to the recent publication of stellar mass functions up to @xmath10 ( e.g. , duncan et al .",
    "2014 ; grazian et al . 2015 ; song et al .",
    "2015 ) we can now make this calculation for the first time . another issue is whether or not the schechter function can be extrapolated below the limit of the data in which it was originally fit . this is a question we investigate in detail .",
    "this is complementary to the directly observed approach presented in the appendix , and is a more accurate way to measure the number of galaxies in the currently observable universe , if the mass functions are properly measured and parameterized accurately .",
    "however this method is potentially fraught with pitfalls that have to be carefully considered and addressed .",
    "not the least of which is that this measurement relies on much more than simple photometry and detection issues , which are also present when simply measuring the number of galaxies .",
    "the situation here involves other uncertainties involving the measurements of stellar masses and redshifts .",
    "nonetheless , if we can account for these uncertainties , the integration of fitted mass functions can tell us the number densities of galaxies within a given redshift interval with some measured uncertainty .",
    "we use this method to calculate the total number density of galaxies which are within the currently observable universe as a function of redshift . to do this",
    "we do not directly integrate the observed mass functions , but use a parameterized fitted form as given by the schechter ( 1976 ) function to determine the total number densities of galaxies as a function of redshift .",
    "the form of this function is given by :    @xmath15^{(1 + \\alpha ) } \\mathrm{exp } [ -10^{b(m - m^{*})}]\\ ] ]    where @xmath16 for the mass function and @xmath17 for the luminosity function , which would be written in terms of absolute magnitudes .",
    "for the mass function , m@xmath18 is the characteristic mass in log units and determines where the mass function changes slope , and m = @xmath19(m@xmath20/ ) , is the mass in log units .",
    "similarly for the luminosity function , m@xmath18 corresponds to the characteristic magnitude .",
    "for both functions @xmath21 is the normalization , and @xmath22 determines the slope for fainter and lower mass galaxies .",
    "our method is to use published values of @xmath21 , @xmath22 and m@xmath18 to calculate the integrated number of galaxies within different redshift bins .",
    "we use the schechter function as a tool to calculate the total number density as overall it does a good job of representing the distribution of galaxy masses at all redshifts in the ranges where we probe .",
    "we do not however know at what lower mass limit it remains valid , which is one uncertainty in our analysis .",
    "we discuss the use of a m@xmath23 limit below and the justification for using this as our lower limit .",
    "we also discuss how our results would change if we were to use a different lower mass cut off limit .",

    "we use these to determine the uv limit corresponding to our default mass limit of m@xmath2 .",
    "this thereby permits us to associate our stellar mass limit with a limit in absolute magnitude in the uv .",
    "we do not use these values in our calculations , but use these luminosity functions to check consistency with our results from the stellar mass functions .",
    "we find a high consistency with the stellar mass functions , including when we use the different variations on the conversion between stellar mass and uv luminosity ( e.g. , duncan et al .",
    "2014 ; song et al .",
    "2015 ) . furthermore , our high - z mass functions all more or less agree at high redshift , with the exception of grazian et al .",
    "( 2015 ) whose results lead to a slightly lower value of @xmath1 .    to 130 mm     and the depth of the data in which the mass function was fit in reference to the value of m@xmath18 ( see text ) .",
    "systems which are more negative in log m@xmath60 - log m@xmath18 have deeper observed mass functions with the deepest data at @xmath61 probing a mass limit which is a factor of 10@xmath62 lower than m@xmath18 .",

    ", width=340 ]    [ sample - figure ]      the major aspect of this paper is that we integrate the fitted schechter function for all of the mass function data below the limit in which the data is obtained .",
    "there are two distinct questions concerning doing this .",
    "one is if we are using fits from mass functions in which the data is not as deep as others , then are we technically able to retrieve the mass function correctly ? as the number density depends strongly upon the value of the faint - end slope @xmath22 (  3.2 ) we can express this question another way : if we have data down to some limit , say m@xmath18 and fit the schechter parameters , will we retrieve the same parameters if we were probing down to a low mass limit ?",
    "the other issue , we address in the next subsection has to do with how low we should integrate these mass functions . here",
    "we discuss the more technical point of whether the schechter function can be extrapolated at all with fits that are based on a variety of mass functions of diverse depths .    to 210 mm     changes as a function of depth relative to the value of m@xmath18 .",
    "in the top panel we show an example using the @xmath65 mass function from duncan et al .",

    "mathematically this is log m@xmath18 = 10.50@xmath67 .",
    "the blue points show the retrieved value of @xmath22 when redoing the entire schechter function fits , but only to the quoted mass depth on the x - axis .",
    "this fitting is done through a full v@xmath68 methodology as outlined in duncan et al .",

    "every mass function we use in this paper is shown here .",
    "the colours denote the redshift range , as in figure  2 .",
    "as can be seen , we are able to retrieve the values of @xmath22 as long as we can reach at least 1/10 the value of m@xmath18 .",
    "the other schechter function parameters are also accurately retrievable in these simulations . , width=340 ]    [ sample - figure ]",
    "we address this issue in a few ways .",
    "we first show in figure  1 the mass functions we use as a function of redshift . the dashed , black lines , show the extrapolation we use down to our m@xmath2 limit .",
    "we show in figure  2 the fitted @xmath22 values for these mass functions as a function of the depth of the data , parameterized by how deep the data is in reference to the fitted m@xmath18 values .",
    "as can be seen , we do not probe as deep at higher redshift .",
    "we also see a trend , well established now in several papers ( e.g. , duncan et al .",
    "2014 ; song et al .",
    "2015 ) that the value of the fitted @xmath22 becomes stepper at higher redshifts .",
    "there is a slight trend such that the fitted value of @xmath22 becomes more steep ( i.e. , more lower mass galaxies ) for deeper data , although this is not present at the highest redshifts .",
    "we also carry out two different simulations to demonstrate that we are able to retrieve the correct value of @xmath22 , and the other schechter function parameters , m@xmath18 and @xmath21 , if we are probing about a factor of ten less massive than m@xmath18 , or deeper .",
    "figure  3 shows the results of these simulations .",
    "the first one on the top panel of figure  3 shows a full refitting of the lowest redshift ( z @xmath72 ) mass functions from duncan et al .",
    "these fits were redone using the emcee mcmc code ( foreman - mackey et al .",
    "the resulting fits thus technically differ from those in duncan et al .",
    "( 2014 ) , most significantly in the marginalized errors which are slightly smaller , but not in a significant way .",
    "the dashed vertical line shows the value of m@xmath18 for this mass function when fit at its deepest level down to the m@xmath73 limit , which is a factor of 100 times less massive than the value of m@xmath18 .",
    "the blue points show the value of the refitted @xmath22 values of the schechter function as a function of depth . as can be seen , within 0.5 dex of m@xmath18 the mass function",
    "is difficult to fit correctly , providing an incorrect @xmath22 or one with a large error bar .",
    "however when the depth of the data is larger than 0.5 dex from m@xmath18 we obtain an accurate measure of @xmath22 .",
    "the bottom plot of figure  3 shows a simulation whereby all of the mass functions we use were resampled to end at 1/10th the value of m@xmath18 ( 1 dex in log space ) and then fit with the resulting faint end slope , @xmath71 .",
    "as shown in figure  2 , all of our mass functions are complete to 1/10 the value of m@xmath18 or deeper .",
    "these simulated mass functions take into account the number of galaxies present in each bin , and therefore also the statistical uncertainty when dealing with smaller numbers of galaxies .",
    "we then compare this simulated value with the full mass range fitted value @xmath69 which probes to the depths shown in figure  2 .",
    "this difference is plotted as a function of the full value @xmath69 in figure  3 .",
    "this shows that as a function of redshift , and shape of the mass function as parameterized by @xmath69 , the value of @xmath22 can be easily retrieved when the depth of the mass function is at least 1/10th the value of m@xmath18 .",
    "this hold as well for the other schechter function parameters .",
    "we therefore use only those mass functions which are at least a factor of ten deeper than their fitted m@xmath18 value ( figure  2 ) .",
    "we must also consider the effects of the covariances between m@xmath18 , @xmath1 , and @xmath22 when these parameters are fit together .",
    "the resulting values of these parameters are correlated , as can be seen in their distributions from various mass function fits ( e.g. , fontana et al .",
    "2006 ; grazian et al .",
    "2015 ; weigel et al .",
    "for example , the best - fitting values of @xmath22 can be strongly affected by a few galaxies at the massive end of the mass function , which should in principal have little effect on the low - mass slope , but when fitting can .",
    "this covariance is such that there is a strong correlation between the values of @xmath22 , @xmath21 and m@xmath18 such that the value of @xmath22 becomes more negative as m@xmath18 increases , and @xmath21 goes up when m@xmath18 does down .",
    "this is such that a higher fitted m@xmath18 increases the resulting value of @xmath1 , and a more negative @xmath22 does so as well , therefore the covariance between these is a potentially serious issue .",
    "however , as there is a corresponding drop in the value of @xmath21 when m@xmath18 increases , this negates to some extent the strong covariance between @xmath22 and m@xmath18 .",
    "the mass function fitting we use does not often provide the covariance between these parameters in the respective results we use .",
    "the error bars on the fits however do represent a good representation of the extent of the range of @xmath1 , when combined together .",
    "that is , the error on @xmath1 is calculated by taking the extent of the error - bar when @xmath22 is at its maximum negative extent , m@xmath18 is at its highest value and @xmath21 is at its lowest value for an upper error limit , and vice - versa for the lower error limit .",
    "we investigate the total effect of this covariance by simulating the covariance for the @xmath74 mass function from grazian et al .",
    "we show the distribution of @xmath1 values when we randomly sample 1000 times across the covariance of the schechter function fitting parameters in figure  4 .",
    "the distribution of @xmath1 is not gaussian , but has a tail at higher values of @xmath1 .",
    "however , the average value of this distribution , @xmath75 , which is just slightly higher than the value calculated with the best fitted schechter values which is @xmath76 .",
    "the error range calculated with our method is also similar to the distribution of these points .",
    "other covariance analyses results in similar conclusions .    to 130 mm     values derived from the sampling of the co - variance between the parameters of @xmath22 , @xmath21 and m@xmath18 for one of the mass functions used at @xmath77 from grazian et al .",
    "the average value of the distribution is @xmath1 = 0.27 which is close to the derived value of @xmath1 = 0.24 which is shown by the vertical blue line .",
    "the range here is also similar to the resulting errors we calculate for @xmath1 .",
    ", width=340 ]    [ sample - figure ]      another main issue with these mass functions is how deep to integrate to obtain the total number density of galaxies at a given redshift .",
    "our choice here is important , as the total number can depend significantly on the limits used in the integration .",
    "our initial and fiducial low - mass limit is m@xmath2 , which is the typical lower limit for dwarf galaxies in the nearby universe .",
    "most systems at masses lower than this are star clusters within galaxies , or debris from galaxy interactions . for example , many of the galaxies in the local group and nearby clusters with masses lower than this are likely either of tidal origin , or are misidentified star clusters ( e.g. , ibata et al .",
    "2013 ; penny & conselice 2008 ) .    while there are certainly some galaxies at lower masses than this in the local universe , by using a m@xmath78 limit we limit our exposure to the risk of extrapolating the mass function too deeply .",
    "because of the use of a limit whereby we are probing beyond the direct observations , we can not be 100% certain that the mass function is necessarily valid to these depths .",
    "also , the exact value of this lower limit will drive the quantitative values of our total number density strongly .",
    "therefore the nominal total number density we calculate is based on the number of galaxies greater than m@xmath2 .",
    "we also assume that the mass functions of high redshift galaxies do not change slope at lower mass limits than we currently probe .",
    "if they do so , then our results would be different .",
    "however , for the reasons given above , and below , this change in slope is unlikely as this change in mass function shape at low masses has not seen at any redshift including at lower redshift where we can probe deeper than at higher redshift .",
    "we also justify using these mass limits , and thus extrapolating our mass functions down to m@xmath2 , in other ways . whilst this paper has nothing directly to say about reionization",
    ", many authors have shown that an extrapolation of the mass function to at least this mass limit is needed to reionize the universe .",
    "as shown in papers such as robertson et al .",
    "( 2015 ) , duncan & conselice ( 2015 ) and dufy et al .",
    "( 2014 ) , the integration of the measured mass function at @xmath79 to at least this m@xmath80 limit is necessary and sufficient to reionize the universe . while this does not imply that these galaxies are reionizing the universe ,",
    "it does show that this limit is required if uv emission from galaxies is the ionization culprit .",
    "this is also consistent with recent determinations of the cosmic background light which show that there are a factor of 10 more galaxies than we can presently observe , per unit area , needed to account for this light ( e.g. , mitchell - wynne et al .",
    "2015 )    furthermore , predictions of cold dark matter show that the luminosity and mass functions of galaxies should be very steep with a mass function slope of @xmath81 ( e.g , jenkins et al .",
    "2001 ) , it is thus reasonable to assume that measured luminosity and mass functions continue to increase past the arbitrary observational limit we can reach with observations today . furthermore these theoretical models show that there are indeed galaxies down to these low masses , both through dark matter halos and through simulated galaxies ( e.g. , jenkins et al .",
    "2001 ; gonzalez - perez et al . 2014 ; henriques et al .",
    "2015 ) .",
    "furthermore , the stellar populations of low mass galaxies in the local universe show that many of the stars in these galaxies were formed at very early times , and thus were present at these high redshifts ( e.g. , grebel , gallagher & harbeck 2003 ) , and that by examining the mass function of local group galaxies we also obtain a high number of low mass systems with a retrieved steep @xmath22 value ( e.g. , graus et al .",
    "we however later test how our results would change if we were to use a different observational limit to constrain this uncertainty .",
    "we integrate the fitted schechter parameters for the various fits to the mass functions given in the papers described in the previous section to obtain a corresponding measurement of the total number densities of galaxies .",
    "we then calculate at a given redshift bin the total number density of galaxies ( @xmath1 ) , given the parameters of the schechter fit to the mass function , @xmath82 :    @xmath83    to 130 mm        [ sample - figure ]    to 120 mm    .",
    "the symbols are the same as figure  5 .",
    "this figure shows that the majority of the galaxies in the currently observable universe are at high redshift .",
    ", width=340 ]    [ sample - figure ]    a good approximation for this integral into a analytical formula can be obtained by taking the approximation for the schechter function when the stellar mass limit is low .",
    "the formula for this is given by :    @xmath84    showing that the number density is a function of all the schechter function parameters , but is especially dependent on the value of @xmath22 , and the lower limit to integration @xmath85 .",
    "however throughout this paper we do not use this approximation , but carry out direct numerical integration of eq .",
    "2 .    when we plot the integrated number density @xmath1 ( figure  5 ) for each data point from our various studies we find some differences between the various surveys for calculating the total number density from m@xmath86 to m@xmath87 .",
    "we find a general increase with redshift in the integrated number density , although some studies , such as perez - gonzalez et al .",
    "( 2008 ) find a slight decline from @xmath88 to @xmath74 . on the other hand , studies that are based on very deep nir imaging , such as kajisawa et al .",

    "( 2011 ) and mortlock et al .",
    "( 2011 , 2015 ) find an increase with redshift in @xmath1 with higher redshift .",
    "this is due to the fact that the fitted @xmath22 values are steeper at higher redshifts in these studies .",
    "more recent results also find a steep @xmath22 at high redshifts , which provides a large value of @xmath1 , including tomczak et al .",
    "( 2014 ) , duncan et al .",
    "( 2014 ) , grazian et al .",
    "( 2015 ) and song et al .",
    "( 2015 ) .",
    "a steep @xmath22 values continues to be found in preliminary mass functions of even deeper studies utilizing lensing from the hubble frontier fields ( laporte et al .",
    "2014 ) and the deepest hst field data , with @xmath22 values approaching or exceeding @xmath89 ( e.g. , bouwens et al . 2015 ; livermore et al .",
    "thus , there are more low mass galaxies per massive galaxy at high redshifts than in the local universe .",
    "we summarize these results and their errors in figure  5 .",
    "note that the integration of the quantity given in eq . 2 and plotted here ,",
    "shows that while there are generally more galaxies at higher redshift , the exact number has some variation . from figure  5",
    "it is however clear that there is a rapid increase in @xmath1 up to @xmath90 with a more mild increase at higher redshifts .",
    "we also show in figure  5 on the left panel the number densities of galaxies down to the limit of integration which matches the completeness of each point in the original data .",
    "this is shown as the small points just below the main data points which have error bars .",
    "this shows that our extrapolations to the lowest mass limits is largest for the highest redshift galaxies by sometimes a factor of 10 or so , and much less at lower redshifts .",
    "when we fit the relation of @xmath1 as a function of time we find that the relationship between the total number density , @xmath1 and time ( @xmath4 ) is such that the increase is slower at lower redshift @xmath61 than at higher redshift .",
    "this shows that there is a rapid increase in the number of galaxies in the universe above our nominal threshold of m@xmath2 .",
    "the formal fit with time is    @xmath91    where @xmath4 is the age of the universe in units of gyr .",
    "this equation shows that the number of galaxies in the universe declines with time , with an overall decrease which goes as @xmath92 .",
    "we find that a fit with time can be parameterized well in this way , although a fit with redshift does not produce a single well fit function .",
    "we also show in figure  6 the change in the number densities of galaxies as function of co - moving volume , showing that the majority of the galaxies in the universe are in the early universe .",
    "this also shows likewise that the average total number density of galaxies declines as time goes on .",
    "we also show in figure  7 the number density evolution at higher mass limits of m@xmath93 , and at m@xmath94 .",
    "what we find when examining these results at different masses is a few things .",
    "first it appears that there is a turn over in the evolution of @xmath1 , such that for massive galaxies there is a step increase in the number density of galaxies above the limit of m@xmath94 .",
    "this is opposite to what we find when we examine the evolution at the limit of m@xmath2 .",
    "this turn over occurs at roughly m@xmath93 , as shown in figure  7 .",
    "this demonstrates that at this limit the evolution of @xmath95 is nearly constant with redshift .",
    "the implication for these results are discussed in the next section .",
    "overall , we are now able to use these results to determine how many galaxies are in the observable universe with our various mass limits , the likely methods by which galaxies are evolving in number density , as well as the implications for background light in the optical and near infrared based on these results .",
    "the major result from this paper is that we now have a scientific measurement of the evolution of the total galaxy number density up to @xmath58 .",
    "we investigate several implications for these results , including the total number of galaxies in the universe , galaxy evolution , extragalactic background light , olbers paradox and future galaxy surveys .",
    "one of the things we can do with this analysis of evolving number densities is to compare our result to those of theory .",
    "recently , the illustris simulation derived the number densities of galaxies as a function of redshift ( torrey et al .",
    "the illustris simulation is a cosmological hydrodynamical simulation designed to probe galaxy formation processes using a periodic box of size l = 106.5 mpc .",
    "the overall set up and code is described in vogelsberger et al .",
    "( 2013 ) , but in summary includes hydrodynamics , gravity , star formation with feedback , and radiative cooling .",
    "it does a reasonable job of matching observations of the galaxy population ( e.g. , genel 2014 ) .",
    "here we compare directly with the predictions for the number of galaxies above a certain mass , or the cumulative number density of galaxies , which is exactly what we have discussed earlier in this paper .",
    "torrey et al . ( 2015 ) provide an analytical formula to compare our values with .",
    "however , up to our redshifts of interest , these are only provided down to m@xmath20 = 10@xmath96 using a chabrier imf .",
    "we thus compare our integration down to this mass limit with these models in figure  7 .",
    "we also convert our number densities to this imf before comparing with the torrey et al .",
    "( 2015 ) results .",
    "we also compare with a higher mass limit of m@xmath20 = 10@xmath97 .",
    "this comparison is shown in figure  7 for these two mass limits .    what can be seen in these figures",
    "is that the cumulative number density observed agrees reasonably well with the predictions for the highest mass galaxies at m@xmath98 , but does not do as well of a job at the lower mass limits .",
    "the reason for this is that the low mass end of the mass function , particularly at lower redshifts does not match the data , with the theory values being too high .",
    "interestingly , this does not seem to be the case at higher redshifts where the theory and data agree better .",
    "the reason for the disagreement at low redshift is likely due to the fact that the data show increasingly shallow values of @xmath22 , the faint end slope , compared to the simulation .",
    "this comparison also shows that our extrapolation down to low mass limit is not excessive as we are still below what is predicted in theory . later in the next section",
    "we discuss the likely cause of this changing @xmath22 value and why the total number of galaxies declines with time .    to 120 mm        [ sample - figure ]      the total number of galaxies in the universe",
    "is an interesting scientific question , although it may not reveal anything fundamental about the cosmology or underlying physics of the universe .",
    "none the less it is an interesting number that should be known and quantified , although expressing it has to be done within certain constraints .",
    "we use the results from  3 to investigate the total number of galaxies in the currently observable universe down to a mass limit of m@xmath2 in two different ways .",
    "we explore other limits that give different answers later .",
    "the first is through simply taking the average total number of galaxies @xmath1 at a given redshift in figure  1 and calculating its scatter .",
    "when multiplied by the volume at that redshift bin this gives us the average total number of galaxies within that volume , which uses all the available data .",
    "then we calculate the total number as simply the sum of these average numbers at each bin .",
    "when we do this calculation we find that the total number of galaxies is given by ,    @xmath99    up to @xmath58 , which is almost a factor of ten larger than what is obtained from direct counts from the deepest optical / nir imaging data , as described in the appendix .    to obtain another estimate of the total number of galaxies in the currently visible universe down to m@xmath2 we integrate equation ( 4 ) from @xmath100 using our best fit relation .",
    "this avoids having to use a single measurement of the mass function to obtain a result , and as such our measurement is based on all the available data . because the mass functions we use are taken from a variety of fields , we are also accounting for cosmic variance within our measurements . to calculate the maximum and minimum limits to our total count",
    ", we take into account the errors assigned to @xmath21 , @xmath22 and m@xmath18 .",
    "we use the fit above to calculate the total number of galaxies within the currently visible universe down to m@xmath2 from @xmath101 to @xmath102 , which is an integral over the number densities @xmath103 and volume :    @xmath104    @xmath105    where the volume is integrated over the entire sky through @xmath106 in steradians and @xmath107 is the angular size distance , @xmath108 and @xmath109 thus knowledge of the redshift and the time since the big - bang are required to perform this integration .",
    "performing this integral to @xmath58 gives us 1.2 trillion individual galaxies , which is again is just less than a factor of ten times higher than the number of galaxies which in principle can be observed today in the universe with present technology ( see appendix ) .",
    "we use the difference between this value of the total number of galaxies and that calculated with the average @xmath1 values above to obtain a most likely value for the average number of galaxies . as both methods are equally valid measurements we take the average between them .",
    "this gives us the ultimate final value of the total number of galaxies within the currently visible universe down to m@xmath110 ( @xmath111 ) ,    @xmath112    this large value implies that there is a a vast number of galaxies that we have yet to discover at magnitudes fainter than @xmath113 as we discuss in section  4.4 .",
    "however , as mentioned , this number depends strongly upon our use of a limit of m@xmath2 , and our redshift limit of @xmath58 .",
    "it is important to explore how the total number would change if these limits were different .",
    "we find that the total number does not depend much upon the redshift limit .",
    "if we extend our study to @xmath114 by using the same number densities we find at @xmath58 , our observational limit , then we find slightly more galaxies with the total number increasing by 65% .",
    "there maybe very few galaxies at redshifts higher than this .    in terms of the mass limit , there is more of a difference when using a lower limit . while we have argued earlier that the mass limit of m@xmath2 is a natural one for galaxies , it is important to discuss how the total number would change if we used a different stellar mass limit .",
    "if we use a factor of ten smaller limit of m@xmath115 , we find roughly a factor of @xmath116 more galaxies than using the 10@xmath117 limit .",
    "thus our limit in equation 7 is actually a lower limit in both terms of the mass limit and redshifts .",
    "the end result of this is that there are at least 2 @xmath118 @xmath119 ( four trillion ) galaxies in the currently visible universe , the vast majority of which can not be observed with present day technology as they are too faint .",
    "one of the major results we find is that the total number density of galaxies in the universe declines with time from from high to low redshift when using a m@xmath2 limit .",
    "in fact , what we find is that measured mass functions down to a limit of m@xmath2 gives a total number density that declines by a factor of 10 within the first 2 gyr of the universe s history , and a further reduction at later times .",
    "this decline may further level off between redshifts of @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",
    "the star formation rate during this time is also very high for all galaxies , which should in principle bring galaxies below our stellar mass limit into our sample at later times .",
    "this would naturally increase the number of galaxies over time , but we see the opposite .",
    "this is likely due to merging and/or accretion of galaxies when they fall into clusters which are later destroyed through tidal effects , as no other method can reduce the number of galaxies above a given mass threshold .",
    "we can use straightforward argument to demonstrate that hierarchical galaxy formation must be occurring in the universe over time at this stellar mass limit . the first way we argue",
    "this is to calculate the number of galaxies in the nearby universe , and then infer the total number we would observe up to @xmath58 if the co - moving number densities of galaxies remained the same .",
    "we then compare this with the total number of galaxies we can observe within the udf - max itself ( see appendix ) .    using the number densities from the gama survey ( baldry et al .",

    "if we use the inferred total number from eq .",
    "( 7 ) then there are @xmath116 times more observable galaxies than what we would predict in the universe if it had the same number density as in the local universe .",
    "there is likely no other way to remove these galaxies except through merging , destruction or accretion with other systems .",
    "we investigate this further with a simple merger destruction model whereby when an individual merger or destruction event occurs the number of galaxies within a volume decreases by one .",
    "thus if there are @xmath123 mergers per unit volume per unit time , then the number density declines by @xmath123 galaxies in that volume , and over that time period .",
    "we parameterize this overall merger rate in units of the number of mergers per unit volume per unit time as as exponentially declining function :    @xmath124    where @xmath125 the merger rate in units of number of mergers per gyr per mpc@xmath126 at @xmath127 , and @xmath128 characterizes the global merger time - scale . in this characterization",
    "the number of mergers per unit volume which occur within a given redshift , or time , interval between time @xmath129 and @xmath130 , which is equivalent to a number density ( @xmath1 ) change , is given by    @xmath131    if we measure this from @xmath132 , then the total integrated decline in the number density @xmath133 is given by :    @xmath134    where @xmath135 is the initial total number densities for galaxies at high redshift .    if we then use the observed data from figure  5 , and set @xmath136 mpc@xmath137 then we find that the best fitting parameters of this merger model are @xmath138 mergers gyr@xmath12 mpc@xmath137 , and @xmath139 gyr .",
    "this model further predicts that at @xmath140 the merger rate is @xmath141 mergers gyr@xmath12 mpc@xmath137 .",
    "this compares well with the directly derived merger rates from conselice ( 2006 ) who find that the merger rate for m@xmath142 galaxies is @xmath143 mergers gyr@xmath12 mpc@xmath137 , while for m@xmath144 galaxies the rate is @xmath145 mergers gyr@xmath12 mpc@xmath137 .",
    "these are also close to the values found by lotz et al .",
    "( 2011 ) for more massive mergers using an independent method , and to bluck et al .",
    "( 2012 ) who look at minor merger pairs .",
    "one caveat of this comparison however is that the merger rate we infer from the decrease in number densities in no way reveals what type of mergers these galaxies were involved with",
    ". they could be in minor mergers with much more massive galaxies , or major mergers with galaxies of similar masses .",
    "the comparison with conselice ( 2006 ) is for a specific type of merger - major mergers with mass ratios of 1:4 or higher .",
    "however , the merger rate we derive from the evolution in number density is higher than the major merger rate from conselice ( 2006 ) , and this is likely due to the increase presence of minor mergers for these systems .",
    "in fact , we find that the merger rate goes up by about a factor of two for minor mergers ( bluck et al .",
    "2012 ) at @xmath14 , suggesting that this is indeed the reason for the difference .",
    "overall however this argument demonstrates that a merger interpretation is tenable given the similarity of merger rates derived using two very different ways to measure the merger history .",
    "also , we find from figure  7 that the number density evolution turns over for higher mass limits and in fact begins to increase with time for limits m@xmath146 .",
    "this implies that the majority of the merging occurs at the lower mass range .",
    "the major conclusion from this is that galaxy merging and accretion / destruction is the likely method in which lower mass galaxies decline in number densities through cosmic time . as discussed in e.g. , conselice ( 2014 ) this is also a major way in which galaxy formation occurs at these epochs .",
    "however , we have a limited amount of information concerning the merging history at @xmath64 ( e.g. , conselice & arnold 2009 ) , yet some results show that the merger history may be even more important at higher redshifts @xmath63 than at lower ( e.g. , ownsworth et al .",
    "2014 ) and this may extend to even higher redshifts .",
    "one of the implications for our results is that there should be a significant number of galaxies in the universe which with current technology we can not observe , even within deep hst images .",
    "this naturally leads to the issue of background light in the universe in the observed optical , as well as other problems such as olbers paradox , or scientifically understanding why the sky is mostly dark at night .    to 130 mm     as a function of magnitude ( blue dashed line )",
    "the two dashed horizontal lines show the observed total number of galaxies we can currently potentially observe with present day technology ( green dot - dashed ) and the predicted total number at @xmath9 based on integrated stellar mass functions ( red dashed ) .",
    ", width=340 ]    [ sample - figure ]    we do not give a detailed scientific discussion of the background light issue , as understanding the contributions of galaxies , as well as an absolute measurement of the background light in the optical is still controversial and difficult to measure ( e.g. , bernstein 2007 ; dominguez et al .",
    "2011 ; mitchell - wynne et al . 2015 ) .",
    "what we can do , using the results of this paper , is discuss how many galaxies there are per unit area of the sky and what this implies about these background light observations .",
    "first , using our final value of n@xmath147 , we calculate that the projected density across all redshifts is on average 10,000 galaxies per arcmin@xmath148 , which corresponds to an average of @xmath149 galaxies per arcsec@xmath148 . using these numbers",
    "we can determine what fraction of the sky should be covered by galaxies .",
    "if we take the hypothesis that these 3 per arcsec@xmath148 galaxies occupy all the area on the sky , this gives an average size for these galaxies of 0.32 arcsec in radius .",
    "this is similar to the effective radii found for the faintest galaxies in deep hst imaging , including the goods fields ( e.g , .",
    "ferguson et al . 2004 ; bouwens et al . 2004 ) , as well as deeper imaging from hst wfc3 ( ono et al . 2013 ) for the highest redshift systems .",
    "if the average galaxy is larger than 0.32 arcsec then it is certain that every part of the sky is occupied by part of a galaxy with stellar masses m@xmath23 at @xmath9 .",
    "thus is appears that there are enough galaxies to nearly cover the entire sky when using a 10@xmath117 limit .",
    "if we were to use a lower integration limit such as 10@xmath150 the number of galaxies in the sky increases by a factor of @xmath116 , making it nearly certain that all parts of the sky would be covered .",
    "this demonstrates that , on average , every point in the sky should contain part of a galaxy in principle .",
    "most of these galaxies are however at higher redshifts , with the majority ( around 2/3 ) at @xmath151 . with the corresponding surface density of galaxies @xmath152 galaxies",
    "arcsec@xmath153 at @xmath154 .",
    "since most galaxies are extremely faint and can not be easily observed with today s technology , we can only detect the presence of these galaxies through the cosmic background light ( e.g. , bernstein 2007 ; dominguez et al .",
    "2011 ) .    using the number of galaxies per magnitude and the magnitude limit that would exist for a total number given in eq .",
    "( 7 ) we calculate the total flux density per steradians in the sky ( figure  8) as a function of magnitude .",
    "we do this by using the results in the appendix , where we calculate the distribution of galaxy magnitudes in the udf . from this we calculate the total flux density by integrating the flux density from each magnitude down to some magnitude limit .",
    "figure  8 shows that at magnitudes around 30 , and fainter , we find an integrated flux value @xmath1555.8@xmath156 .",
    "this value does not increase very much at fainter magnitudes .",
    "this flux compares well with the limits on the optical background from e.g. , bernstein ( 2007 ) who finds an optical background value in the i band of 7@xmath157 .",
    "although the exact value of the background light in the optical is still quite uncertain , this agreement with the best measurements thus far is encouraging .",
    "furthermore , we know that studies of gamma - ray bursts show that the intrinsic star formation rate is a factor of 3 - 5 times higher than that measured from deep imaging surveys ( ishida et al .",
    "2011 ) , demonstrating that there are many faint galaxies yet to be detected at high redshifts .",
    "figure  8 however shows that while the faint galaxies we have not detected dominate the total number in the universe , they however do not contribute substantially to the unresolved background optical light beyond @xmath158 .",
    "we can however use this to address the issue of why the sky is dark at night , a long standing problem known as olbers paradox since bondi ( 1952 ) .",
    "our results reveal perhaps a new solution to this paradox .",
    "there are various proposed solutions to olbers paradox but most solutions can be placed into the one of two categories : ( 1 ) there are missing stars ( and/or galaxies ) , or ( 2 ) the stars are there , but they can not be observed for one reason or another . possible reasons for not detecting distant star light have included scenarios such as : absorption of light , hierarchical clustering , and the removal of energy from light in an expanding universe . the traditional solution to the paradox is generally considered to be the fact that the universe is finite in age and size ( harrison 1987 ) .",
    "the human eye through l cone cells are sensitive out to a wavelength of 700 nm . if we consider which galaxies we would be able to see out to this wavelength , we find that galaxies out to @xmath159 would still be detected in principle .",
    "galaxies at higher redshifts would not be detected as their light is all shifted into wavelengths longer than 700 nm or at the highest redshifts would have their light blue - ward of ly-@xmath22 absorbed by the lyman-@xmath22 forest . at observed wavelengths bluer",
    "than this , all the light which is in principle detectable would originate within the uv continuum .",
    "however all of this light is absorbed by gas , and perhaps dust , within the host galaxies and in the intergalactic medium near the galaxy itself , and along the site line to earth .",
    "thus , it would appear from this that absorption , long discarded as one objection to olbers paradox , is one method for removing objects from optical light detections .",
    "this rest - frame uv light would however ionize hydrogen , which would then recombine , and in the process emit new light in the form of the lyman-@xmath22 line at 121.5 nm , and other lines which are mostly redder than this ( e.g. , bertone & schaye 2012 ) .",
    "however , this emission would be found mostly at observed near infrared wavelengths for systems at @xmath151 , outside the window of visible light detections .",
    "the method of absorption thereby removes uv continuum light at wavelengths lower than the lyman - limit , and does not permit its re - introduction into the same , or bluer , wavelength range whereby it would be detectable within observed optical light .",
    "furthermore , some of this light may also be absorbed by dust , which in the limited time - range available , when the universe was only a few gyr old at most , would then be re - emitted into the far - infrared , again outside the range of optical light .",
    "it would thus appear that the solution to the strict interpretation of olbers paradox , as an optical light detection problem , is a combination of nearly all possible solutions - redshifting effects , the finite age and size of the universe , and through absorption .      in this section",
    "we investigate future surveys and how the results of this study have implications for future studies . in the next 10 years",
    "we will have telescopes that will image deeper than we currently can , with the elts and jwst , and other telescopes and surveys that will cover vastly larger areas such as euclid and lsst .",
    "first , we answer the question of when we would expect to find the observed galaxy number counts to naturally turn over due to ` running out ' of faint galaxies to detect .",
    "while we are far from reaching that limit today , if we assume that the slope of the number counts , as described in the appendix , remains constant at magnitudes fainter than 29 , we can determine at what magnitude limit we will reach the total number of actual galaxies .",
    "we do this by integrating the observed number of galaxies in the udf using eq .",
    "( a3 ) and eq .",
    "( a4 ) as a function of magnitude down to limits ranging from m=20 to m = 40 .",
    "this integration allows us to infer the relationship between the total number of galaxies and the limiting magnitude reached ( figure  5 ) .",
    "this relationship , shown in figure  8 , is given by :    @xmath160    we find that the magnitude limit for the total number of galaxies calculated with the mass functions ( eq .",
    "11 ) is @xmath161 @xmath155 34.9@xmath162 ab mag , taking into account the errors in the total number of galaxies .",
    "if we consider galaxies down to 10@xmath150 this limit becomes 38.9@xmath163 .",
    "based on this calculation we predict that at around magnitude 35 we would find that the observed number counts of galaxies begins to gradually decline at fainter magnitudes .",
    "this depth however will be very difficult to reach with even very deep surveys with jwst , and may require the next generation of large space telescopes to fully probe .",
    "this would also make deep observations of future telescope observations confusion limited if they can reach these faint magnitudes .",
    "if we want to observe all the galaxies in the universe , even with imaging , it will require extensive telescope programmes that are likely several generations away .",
    "the euclid mission planned for launch in 2020 will image 15,000 deg@xmath148 down to ab magnitude of 24.5 in the wide vis filter which mimics in some ways the wide filter we construct in this paper using the udf - max image ( see appendix ) .",
    "the deep component of euclid will be two magnitudes fainter over 40 deg@xmath148 . using our number",
    "counts we predict that euclid will image around 3.7@xmath164 galaxies in total , or @xmath1650.1% of all galaxies in the universe .",
    "this is significantly more than we have imaged at present with the sloan digital sky survey which has imaged roughly @xmath166 galaxies and qsos , or @xmath167 ( 0.05% ) of all galaxies in the universe .",
    "lsst will find a similar number of galaxies .",
    "thus we will have to wait at least several decades before even the majority of galaxies have basic imaging in a single band .",
    "we have investigated the fundamental question of the number density evolution of galaxies in the universe .",
    "we investigate this problem in a number of ways , and discuss the implications for galaxy evolution and cosmology .",
    "we use recently measured mass functions for galaxies up to @xmath10 to determine the number density evolution of galaxies in the universe .",
    "our major finding is that the number densities of galaxies decrease with time such that the number density @xmath168 , where @xmath4 is the age of the universe .",
    "we further discuss the implications for this increase in the galaxy number density with look - back time for a host of astrophysical questions . integrating the number densities ,",
    "@xmath1 we calculation that there are @xmath169 galaxies in the universe up to @xmath58 which in principle could be observed .",
    "this is roughly a factor of ten more than is found through direct counting ( see appendix ) .",
    "this implies that we have yet to detect a large population of faint distant galaxies .    in terms of astrophysical evolution of galaxies",
    ", we show that the increase in the integrated mass functions of all galaxies with redshift can be explained by a merger model .",
    "we show that a simple merger model is able to reproduce the decline in the number of galaxies with a merger time - scale of @xmath139 gyr .",
    "the derived merger rate at @xmath140 is @xmath141 mergers gyr@xmath12 mpc@xmath137 , close to the value found through structural and pair analyses .",
    "most of these merging galaxies are lower mass systems based on the increase in number densities with time seen at lower limit selections , using higher masses , for the total number density calculation .",
    "we finally discuss the implications of our results for future surveys .",
    "we calculate that the number counts of galaxies at magnitudes fainter than @xmath170 will largely probe the lower mass galaxies at higher redshifts and eventually at @xmath171 will turn over and decline due to reaching the limit of the number of galaxies in universe , unless the mass limit for galaxies is much less than m@xmath2 or there are many galaxies at @xmath172 . we also show that this leads to a natural confusion limit in detection and that these galaxies are likely responsible for the optical and near - infrared background and provide a natural explanation for olbers paradox .",
    "this large additional number of galaxies is also consistent with recent measures of the cosmic infrared background light ( e.g. , mitchell - wynne et al .",
    "2015 ) .    in the future ,",
    "as mass functions become better known with better sed modeling and deeper and wider data with jwst and euclid / lsst , we will be able to measure the total number densities of galaxies more precisely and thus obtain a better measure of this fundamental quantity .",

    "in the appendix we discuss how many galaxies can be observed in the universe directly with present - day instrumentation and telescopes using the hubble ultra deep field . by doing this we address how many galaxies can be detected with our present technology using the deepest observations taken to date at all wavelengths from the x - ray to the radio .",
    "we do this to compare with the model results in the main paper on the number density evolution of galaxies through cosmic time .",

    "the original hudf imaging programme used 400 orbits of hubble time for a total exposure time of just under 1 msec .",
    "later additions of data were added over the years by programmes such as bouwens et al .",
    "the field of view of the acs image for the hudf is 11 arcmin@xmath148 .",

    "2006 ) , with increased data driving this depth even fainter .",
    "this makes the hudf easily the deepest optical imaging taken to date .",
    "the result for the number of galaxies that can be observed with current technology which we calculate is largely based on these hudf observations and through using simulations to carry out corrections for incompleteness .",
    "estimates of this number from simply counting in deep fields has been provided in the past ( e.g. , beckwith et al . 2006 ; coe et al .",
    "2006 ) , yet we carry out this analysis in a different and more complete and careful way .    to do this calculation , we create a maximal depth hudf image from which we carry out our counting analysis .",
    "we are also very careful to not only detect the faintest galaxies , but also to ensure that single galaxies are not over separated into separate systems or ` shredded ' by the source extraction .",
    "we supplement these counts with lower redshift counting where the hudf area is not large enough to obtain a representative volume , as well as considerations for galaxies which are not detectable in observed optical wavelengths .",
    "first , we discuss in this section the number of galaxies retrieved through direct detections in a combined maximum depth optical hudf image , where the bulk of galaxies in this field , which can be detected , are found .",
    "to maximize the signal to noise of the hudf imaging we combine the four imaging bands - @xmath180 into one band which we call the `` udf - max '' image .",
    "we add these images together according to their relative weights of signal to noise ( s / n ) from their individual weight maps , and after ensuring that the psf is matched between the bands .",
    "the relative weights are determined from the depth of observations in each band , such that the combination produces the highest possible signal to noise ratio in the resulting combined data .",
    "that is , these are added together according to their depth so as to maximize the signal to noise of the average galaxy .",
    "this will affect galaxies which are only detected in the redder / bluer bands , but we later discuss how we can ensure that these very red galaxies are still detected .",
    "the formula which we use to create this maximum depth image is given by :      where udf - max is the new hdf - max image , and bv@xmath182 are the filters which are combined together .",
    "we then recalibrate this combined image to obtain a new zero point of m@xmath183 = 26.4 in ab magnitude units .",
    "this was done by converting counts per second in each band to a flux and then determining the zero point based on this flux combination .",
    "we then compute magnitudes in our constructed udf - max image as follows :      where @xmath185 is the counts per second on the udf - max image .",
    "these magnitudes are then measured , and later used to calculate the total number of galaxies using the number counts of galaxies at each magnitude .",
    "we furthermore checked that all the objects detected in each individual band are also detected in the combined image .",
    "this is to ensure that , for example , galaxies detected only in the @xmath186-band , as e.g. , high redshift drop out galaxies , are also detected in the udf - max image .",
    "this was indeed the case for all galaxies down to the detection limit in each band .",
    "after creating this optimal maximal deep image , we then detect the galaxies within it .",
    "our method of finding galaxies in the udf - max , as well as for determining our completeness corrections , are done using the sextractor detection package ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) using auto - mag magnitudes .",
    "a simple detection run through on the z - band image finds that there are between 9,000 - 10,000 galaxies within the hubble ultra deep field ( see also beckwith et al .",
    "2006 ) , but this does not take into account incompleteness . to optimize the number of galaxies we detect , and are able to successfully extract and deblend from each other , we adjust the sextractor detection and separation parameters accordingly .",
    "we do this through an iterative process whereby we change the sextractor detection and deblending parameters such that galaxies are sextracted independently from each other .",
    "that is , we repeat our detection methods until the faintest galaxies are detected and deblended .",
    "this is done while at the same time ensuring that noise is not being detected as false positive objects .",
    "ultimately we detect our objects in the udf - max using a threshold of 1.7@xmath179 , and a minimum detection area of 5 pixels .",
    "the deblending parameters responsible for separating nearby objects from each other are set to 32 deblending sub - thresholds with a minimum contrast parameter of 0.05 .",
    "we also combine the weight images from each of the four filter observations as above to remove noise which is otherwise detected as real objects by sextractor .",
    "we find using our methods described above that there are 9,713 galaxies detected in the udf - max . the distribution of the counts of the galaxies in the udf - max at a given magnitude are shown as black circles in figure  a1 . if we slightly tweak this value due to changing the detection parameters we get a variation on the few percent level in the number of galaxies detected .",
    "however , this is just a raw number , and to obtain the total number of galaxies which are observable down to the depth of the udf - max , we must correct this measurement for the incompleteness of our observations .",
    "as such we carry out a series of simulations , matching the properties of high redshift galaxies , to determine the fraction of systems we are missing when carrying out these measurements .      figure  a2 shows the detection completeness from simulating galaxies within our udf - max image .",
    "we compute this by simulating galaxy images at a given angular size , magnitude , and surface brightness profile as fake images , and then randomly placing these into the udf - max image .",
    "we then detect these with the same sextractor method and parameters as we use for the detection of the real galaxies . the completeness",
    "is then defined as the number of simulated galaxies detected divided by the total number put into the image at a given magnitude .",
    "when carrying out these simulation , we ensure that the angular size distribution at a given magnitude of the objects we input into each simulation is the same as the observed distribution from our original sextractor detections . to carry this out we measure the angular sizes of our galaxies through kron radii measured through sextractor , which we then later use in our distribution for the simulated galaxy angular sizes .",
    "we do this by fitting the observed angular size - magnitude relation and then simulating these galaxies such that they follow the same relationship , and to have the same scatter as measured statistically .    at the faintest magnitudes we assume that the size distribution is similar in shape to brighter magnitudes , but with a different average value as suggested by the relationship between magnitude and size , so as to not bias against large but fainter systems which would not be detected in our imaging .",
    "that is , we assume that the slope of the relationship between galaxy magnitude and size remains in place to our faint limit .",
    "thus we are allowing for sizes of systems that would not ordinarily be detected at the highest redshifts due to surface brightness dimming by assuming a similar distribution of sizes as seen at slightly lower redshifts .",
    "we carry out these simulations using different mixtures of surface brightness profile types for the simulated galaxies .",
    "we then place these simulated galaxies in the udf - max after convolving with the psf .",
    "we then measure the completeness of these simulations when we use pure elliptical ( i.e. , vaucouleur ) profiles for all galaxies , pure exponential disk profiles , and a 50/50 split of both .",
    "observations show that most high - z galaxies have flatter profile shapes ( e.g. , ferguson et al .",
    "2004 ; ravindranath et al .",
    "2004 ; buitrago et al .",
    "2013 ) , although we explore this range as a source of error .",
    "each of these simulations is carried out , and the detection and incompleteness is calculated .",
    "this spans the possible range of intrinsic galaxy profiles .",
    "based on this , the completeness of our imaging drops quickly at magnitudes fainter than m@xmath68 = 28 , and by magnitude 30 very few galaxies are still retrieved from our detection methods .",
    "this is similar in pattern to the individual bands of the hudf as shown by beckwith et al .",
    "( 2006 ) .              to account for the incompleteness in our detected galaxies , and thus to obtain a true total number of galaxies in the udf - max",
    ", we divide the completeness into the number of observed galaxies at a given magnitude .",
    "the result of the number counts before and after using this incompleteness correction is shown in figure  a1 .",
    "we also show the best fitting relationship between the number density and magnitude as a green line .",
    "this best fitting relation has a break at @xmath161 = 25 .",
    "the best fitting relation at @xmath187 is          we then use these relations to calculate the total number density down to magnitude 29 , where our detection completeness is @xmath191% . by integrating our magnitude",
    "fits in the udf - max from m@xmath192 to 29 , we calculate that the total number densities of galaxies , based on just the udf - max image is @xmath193 galaxies deg@xmath153 which is equivalent to @xmath194 galaxies arcmin@xmath153 or @xmath195 galaxies arcsec@xmath153 . using just this number density in the udf - max , we calculate the total number of observable galaxies in the universe at optical wavelengths as :      this uncertainty is solely based on number counting statistics , and as such does not account for other sources of error such as nearby and very distant ( @xmath197 ) galaxies , non - optical detections and cosmic variance , which we discuss later in the following sections .",
    "our number also does not differ substantially from what can be derived from the original number counts from the hdf and udf ( e.g. , williams et al .",
    "1996 ; beckwith et al . 2006 ) .",
    "we find a similar result when we simulate our galaxies as systems with purely disk - like profiles .",
    "this is in fact a more accurate description of distant galaxies , as disk - like profiles become increasingly common at higher redshifts , including for the most massive systems ( e.g. , ferguson et al .",
    "2004 ; ravindranath et al .",
    "2004 ; buitrago et al .",
    "2013 ) . to obtain a measurement of our uncertainties",
    "we recalculate this number for simulated profiles which are 100% elliptical like profiles , and for a 50/50 split between disk like systems and elliptical - like ones .",
    "we find using these different simulation corrections that the total number of galaxies is 2.36 and 2.57 @xmath118 10@xmath198 respectively , with very similar number counting errors as found in the pure disk - like simulations .",
    "we therefore take the average of these two and use the difference as another source of error .",
    "this gives us a total number of galaxies of 2.46@xmath199 galaxies .",
    "this is however an underestimate of the number of galaxies potentially observable .",
    "we have also not yet taken into account the fact that the hubble ultra deep field does not include the most distant objects in the universe which are undetected in the optical , as well as the nearest galaxies which are present due to the nearby volume probed being very small in the udf - max .",
    "although these numbers are small and make little difference to the overall total number of galaxies , we include them for completeness .",
    "we include the nearest galaxies in our calculation based on stellar mass functions measured for local galaxies , as well as the deepest hst data in the wfc3 to measure the ultra - high redshift systems which may exist at @xmath197 .",
    "we use one of the latest deepest ultra - high redshift searches from the udf12 project from ellis et al .",
    "this is a medium band survey of the udf done with the wfc3 near infrared camera . by going very deep wfc3",
    "has made it easier to find ultra high redshift galaxies than can be found within the acs imaging .",
    "this deep wfc3 data has allowed ellis et al .",
    "( 2013 ) to identify in total seven galaxies between redshifts @xmath200 which were previously unidentified . assuming this is a representative number density across the sky , the total number of galaxies which are visible to us at this redshift range is 2.2@xmath201 galaxies .",
    "for galaxies in the nearby universe ( @xmath202 ) we use the mass functions calculated in the gama survey by baldry et al .",
    "the effective mid - redshift for the 143 deg@xmath148 covered in this study is @xmath203 which includes 5210 galaxies .",
    "the derived stellar mass function is best fit by a double schechter function . integrating this we calculate the number density within the mass limits of m@xmath204 . doing this calculation",
    "we find that there are @xmath205 galaxies at @xmath206 from conselice et al .",
    "( 2011 ) that are not accounted for in the udf - max imaging .",
    "likewise , we also remove the small number of galaxies in the udf - max imaging at @xmath206 so as to not double count the number of galaxies at these lowest redshifts .",
    "whilst nearly all galaxies in the universe at @xmath207 are detectable within observed optical light , as far as we know , it is possible or even likely that there are galaxies at other wavelengths that can not be detected in the optical and near - infrared .",
    "first we investigate the number of galaxies which are detected at the sub - mm and in the radio , but which are seen neither in the optical nor in the near - infrared .",
    "the latest surveys of sub - mm galaxies from alberts et al .",
    "( 2013 ) find that 85% of all sources have optical or near - infrared counterparts in deep goods imaging .",
    "using the number densities from casey et al .",
    "( 2014 ) , we find that between 0.1 - 1 mjy there are 6.2@xmath208 extra galaxies across the sky not matched to optical or near - infrared detections .",
    "although the goods data is almost as deep as the udf , we can not be sure that these sources would not be found on the slightly deeper data , so we do not include them in our total number .    in terms of ultraviolet detections ,",
    "a recent survey by teplitz et al . ( 2013 ) took very deep uv imaging of the hubble ultra deep field . matching to the deep b - band hudf data teplitz et al .",
    "( 2013 ) find that there are no systems in the ultraviolet which do not have an optical counterpart .",
    "extragalactic x - ray sources are similarly almost always detected in the optical / nir .",
    "the currently deepest x - ray data find that 716 out of 740 ( 96.8% ) of x - ray sources down to @xmath155 3 @xmath209 over 464.5 arcmin@xmath148 at 0.5 - 8 kev are detected in deep optical data as part of the deepest 4 msec chandra imaging of the universe ( xue et al .",
    "2011 ) in the hudf area .",
    "this gives us a total of 7.67@xmath210 x - ray sources in the universe that are not accounted for by an optical and/or near infrared counterparts at the udf - max depth .",
    "this is much smaller than the sub - mm or optical drop out high@xmath211 galaxies , and thus are not likely a major contributor to the number of galaxies in the universe .",
    "therefore , in total we find that there are an additional @xmath212 galaxies that must be accounted for that are not detected in the optical at @xmath213 .",
    "this is however only 1% of the nominal value we obtained for the optical detections .",
    "this implies that around 1% of galaxies that can be seen over all wavelengths are not detectable within deep hubble space telescope imaging to the depth of the hubble ultra deep field .",
    "one of the things we must consider in an analysis such as this is the fact that we are only probing a very small part of the sky when examining the udf - max .",
    "it is certain that we would obtain a different answer if we were to repeat this experiment by investigating galaxy counts in another unrelated part of the sky / universe , obtaining a slightly higher or smaller number of counts .",
    "this is due to the fact that the distribution of galaxies can vary significantly as structure is highly clustered , and thus some regions are more over dense than others .",
    "we can determine the contribution of this unknown random error to our results by considering both the variance due to poisson counting errors , as well as this cosmic variance by using halo models of the universe . to do this we utilize the cosmic variance code written by trenti & stiavelli ( 2008 ) to determine for our observed sample the combined variance due to poisson uncertainty and to cosmic variance .",
    "the total variance changes significantly with the galaxy type and redshift . at the highest redshifts , this relative variance can be as much as 0.31 , while at lower redshifts it is around 0.05 .",
    "the variance tends to decline at lower redshifts as more representative galaxies are being studied , which lowers the amount of cosmic variance . taking this into account in total we calculate that the cosmic variance on our measured counts is 1.53@xmath215 galaxies .",
    "this then gives a combined uncertainty of      which is our final estimate of the number of galaxies we can observe today with current technology at hudf depths in the universe ( ignoring magnification by lensing and extinction ) with uncertainties included for non - optical detections and cosmic variance .",

    "<S> the evolution of the number density of galaxies in the universe , and thus also the total number of galaxies , is a fundamental question with implications for a host of astrophysical problems including galaxy evolution and cosmology . </S>",

    "<S> we show that the increase in the total number density of galaxies ( @xmath1 ) , more massive than m@xmath2 , decreases as @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the age of the universe . </S>",
    "<S> we further show that this evolution turns - over and rather increases with time at higher mass lower limits of m@xmath5 . by using the m@xmath6 lower limit </S>",
    "<S> we further show that the total number of galaxies in the universe up to @xmath7 is @xmath8 ( two trillion ) , almost a factor of ten higher than would be seen in an all sky survey at hubble ultra - deep field depth . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the implications for these results for galaxy evolution , as well as compare our results with the latest models of galaxy formation . </S>",
    "<S> these results also reveal that the cosmic background light in the optical and near - infrared likely arise from these unobserved faint galaxies . </S>",
