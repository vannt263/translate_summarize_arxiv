    "the first evidence that much more than the visible matter should fill the universe dates back to 1933 when f. zwicky measured the dispersion velocity in the coma galaxies @xcite .",
    "this was soon after confirmed by s. smith studying the virgo cluster @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , only about 50 years later the fact that dark matter should be present in large amount in our universe finally reached a wide consensus .",
    "particular contribution was given in the seventies by two groups which systematically analysed the dispersion velocity in many spiral galaxies @xcite : in fact , the velocity curves in the galaxy plane as a function of distance from the galactic center stay flat even outside the luminous disk , crediting the presence of a dark halo .",
    "several other experimental evidences for the dark universe have been pointed out by the progresses  with time passing  in the astronomical observations , such as : i ) the large magellanic cloud spins around our galaxy faster than expected in case only luminous matter would be present ; ii ) the observation of x - ray emitting gases surrounding elliptical galaxies ; iii ) the velocity distribution of hot intergalactic plasma in clusters .",
    "all these observations have further supported that the mass of the universe should be much larger than the luminous one in order to explain the observed gravitational effects .",
    "the existence of the dark universe is supported also by the standard cosmology ( based on the assumption that the universe arose from an initial singularity and went on expanding ) in the inflationary scenario ( proposed to avoid any fine tuning in the big bang initial conditions ) , which requires a flat universe with density equal to the critical one : @xmath3 g @xmath1 @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the newton constant and @xmath6 is the hubble constant equal to @xmath7 kms@xmath8mpc@xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "the uncertainty is due to the measurements of the actual value of the expansion rate of the universe and to the considered models @xcite ; a recent determination from the wmap data gives : @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "in particular , the density parameter @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the average density of the universe ( matter + energy ) , is a key parameter in the interpretation of the data from the measurements on cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) since the global curvature of the universe is related to it .",
    "the experimental results are consistent with a flat geometry of the universe and , therefore , also support @xmath13 @xcite ; the most recent determination from the wmap gives : @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "thus , the scenario is consistent with adiabatic inflationary models and with the presence of acoustic oscillations in the primeval plasma and requires the existence of dark matter in the universe since the average density of the universe as measured by photometric methods is : @xmath15 .",
    "however , the detailed composition of @xmath16 in term of matter , @xmath17 , and of energy , @xmath18 , can not be inferred by cmb data alone ; some information can be derived by introducing some other constraints @xcite .    for the sake of completeness",
    ", we also mention that in last years studies have been performed @xcite on astronomical standard candles as supernovae type ia , that allow to evaluate relations between redshift and distance .",
    "these studies seem to point out an universe whose expansion is accelerating , crediting the possible presence of a dark energy . when these results are combined with cmb data , @xmath18 would account for about 70% of @xmath16@xcite .",
    "this form of energy , with repulsive gravity and possible strong implication on the future evolution of universe , would not be a replacement for dark matter and is still a mysterious task ; dedicated ground and space based experiments are planned in order to confirm this scenario .",
    "finally , as regards our galaxy , from dynamical observations one can derive that it is wrapped in a dark halo , whose density nearby the earth has been estimated to be for example in refs .",
    "@xcite : @xmath19 gev @xmath4 ( see also later ) .",
    "the investigation on the nature of the dark universe has shown that large part of it should be in non - baryonic form .",
    "in fact , as regards baryons , in the past from the theory of big - bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) and from a lower limit to the primordial deuterium abundance a baryon density @xmath20 was set @xcite .",
    "this upper limit has been precised by recent measurements of primordial deuterium abundance , giving @xmath21@xcite , that combined with the present determination of the hubble constant implies : @xmath22 ; the latest determination by cbm experiments : @xmath23@xcite , is also in good agreement .",
    "recently , large efforts have been devoted to the investigation on dark baryonic matter by experiments like eros , macho and ogle , which search for massive compact halo objects as baryonic candidates looking at microlensing effect toward large and small magellanic clouds and toward the milky way bulge . at present , in agreement with the expectations , the obtained results @xcite strongly limit the possible amount of galactic dark matter in this form .",
    "in addition , a further argument , which also supports that the major part of the dark matter in the universe should be in non - baryonic form , is the following : it is very difficult to build a model of galaxy formation without the inclusion of non - baryonic dark matter .",
    "thus , a significant role should be played by non - baryonic relic particles from the big bang .",
    "they must be stable or with a lifetime comparable with the age of the universe to survive up to now in a significant amount .",
    "they must be neutral , undetectable by electromagnetic interactions and their cross section with ordinary matter should be weak ( in fact , if their annihilation rate would be greater than the universe expansion rate , they should disappear ) .",
    "the dark matter candidate particles are usually classified in",
    "_ hot _ dark matter ( particles relativistic at decoupling time with masses @xmath24 30 ev ) and in _ cold _ dark matter ( particles non relativistic at temperatures greater than 10@xmath25 k with masses from few gev to the tev region or axions generated by symmetry breaking during primordial universe ) .",
    "the light neutrinos are the natural candidates for _ hot _ dark matter ; they are strongly constrained by cosmology and a value over the limit @xmath26 gives an unacceptable lacking of small - scale structure@xcite .",
    "in addition , a pure _ hot _ dark matter scenario is also ruled out by the measurements of the cmb radiation , which does not show sufficiently large inhomogeneity .    thus , _ cold _ dark matter candidates , which can be responsible for the initial gravitational collapse , should be present and in large amount , although a pure _ cold _ dark matter scenario seems to be not favoured by the observed power spectrum of the density perturbation . in practice ,",
    "a mixed dark matter scenario is generally favourably considered .",
    "however , other possibilities can be considered such as , for example , the so - called `` tilted dark matter scenario '' that introduces a significant deviation from the zeldovich scale invariance of the power spectrum of the initial fluctuations .",
    "anyhow , in all the possible scenarios a significant fraction of _ cold _ dark matter particles is expected .    as mentioned above , _ cold _ dark matter can be in form of axions or of wimps ( weakly interacting massive particles ) .",
    "the axions are light bosons , hypothesized to solve the cp problem in strong interactions .",
    "direct detection experiments are in progress since time by studying their interactions with strong electromagnetic fields , but no positive evidence has been found so far @xcite . for completeness , we mention that some experiments ( including dama / nai , see fig .",
    "[ fig_axion ] ) have also searched for possible axions produced in the sun ( see e.g. @xcite ) and that some other will be realized in near future . however , these latter experiments can not be classified as experiments for dark matter direct detection since they are not searching for relic axions .    for the sake of completeness",
    ", we remind that also more exotic candidates ( which generally could account for small fraction of dark matter in the galactic halo ) have been considered and searched for , such as e.g. the magnetic monopoles with mass 10@xmath27 - 10@xmath28 gev @xcite , the neutral strongly interacting massive particles ( simps ) and the neutral nuclearities@xcite , the q - balls@xcite , etc . ; experimental searches for such candidates have given always negative results .",
    "some of them have also been investigated by dama / nai @xcite .",
    "the wimps are particles in thermal equilibrium in the early stages of the universe , decoupled at freeze out temperature . considering the wimp particles as stable and with the same initial density for particles and antiparticles",
    ", their annihilation cross section , @xmath29 , should be such that their annihilation rate should be lower than the expansion rate of the universe : @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the relative velocity of the particle - antiparticle pair ; thus , the interaction cross section is of the same order as those known of weak interactions . in case",
    "the particles and antiparticles would not have the same initial density , this relation would represent a lower limit .",
    "the velocity - spatial distribution of the wimps in our galactic halo is not well known .",
    "so far the simplest , non - consistent and approximate isothermal sphere model has generally been considered in direct wimp searches ; under this assumption the wimps form a dissipationless gas trapped in the gravitational field of our galaxy in an equilibrium steady state and have a quasi - maxwellian velocity distribution with a cut - off at the escape velocity from the galactic gravitational field .",
    "more realistic halo models have been proposed by various authors such as evans power - law halos , michie models with an asymmetric velocity distribution , maxwellian halos with bulk rotation , etc . @xcite . in particular , a devoted discussion on a wide ( but still not complete ) number of consistent halo models and their implications on available experimental data has been carried out e.g. in refs .",
    "@xcite ; they will be summarized in ",
    "[ sc : halo ] .    at present , the most widely considered candidate for wimp is the lightest supersymmetric particle named neutralino , @xmath32 . in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) where r - parity is conserved , the lightest susy particle , @xmath32 , must be stable and can interact neither by electromagnetic nor by strong interactions ( otherwise it would condensate and would be detected in the galactic halo with the ordinary matter ) .",
    "the @xmath32 is defined as the lowest - mass linear combination of photino ( @xmath33 ) , zino ( @xmath34 ) and higgsinos ( @xmath35 ) : @xmath36 ( where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are linear combination of u(1 ) and su(2 ) neutral gauginos , @xmath37 and @xmath38 ) and is a majorana particle . under some assumptions , the @xmath32 mass and the @xmath39 coefficients depend on the higgs mass mixing parameter , @xmath40 , on the @xmath37 and @xmath38 masses and on @xmath41 ( the ratio between the v.e.vs which give masses to up and down quarks )",
    ". thus , often the theoretical estimates and sometimes the experimental results are presented in terms of @xmath40 , @xmath41 and wino mass , @xmath42 .",
    "the @xmath32 cross section on ordinary matter is described by three feynman diagrams : i ) exchange between @xmath32 and quarks of the ordinary matter through higgs particles ( spin - independent  si  interaction ) ; ii ) exchange between @xmath32 and quarks of the ordinary matter through z@xmath43 ( spin - dependent  sd  interaction ) ; iii ) exchange between @xmath32 and quarks of the ordinary matter through squark ( mixed  si / sd  interaction ) .",
    "the evaluation of the expected rates for @xmath32 depends on several parameters and procedures , which are affected by significant uncertainties , such as e.g. the considered neutralino composition , the present uncertainties on the measured top quark mass and on certain sectors of the fundamental nuclear cross sections , on some lack of information about physical properties related to higgs bosons and susy particles , on the possible use of constraints from gut schemes and/or from @xmath44 branching ratio , on the used rescaling procedure , etc . ; in conclusion , considering also the large number of involved parameters , the supersymmetric theories have unlikely no practical predictive capability .",
    "other candidates can also be considered as wimps ; in particular , we remind an heavy neutrino of a 4-th family @xcite and the sneutrino in the scenario described in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the heavy neutrino of a 4-th family was one of the first candidate proposed to solve the dark matter problem .",
    "still now it may be considered as a good and realistic candidate , although unable to account for the whole dark matter missing mass .",
    "such a neutrino could contribute  by its pair annihilation in the galactic halo  to positrons , antiprotons and diffused gamma background and these signatures might be better fit to the observed data @xcite ; moreover , it might dominate the higgs decay mode in near future lhc accelerator .",
    "pole are considered . ]",
    "the cosmological relic abundance of heavy neutrinos can be evaluated , as reported in fig .",
    "[ fg : relic_neut ] , taking into account that the couplings are described within the standard model of elementary particles . applying the condition that the density of such heavy neutrinos can not exceed the critical density , a window in their mass",
    "can be evaluated @xcite : 3 gev @xmath45 3 tev . considering the measurements of @xmath46 decay into invisible channels carried out at lep and some implications of the measured cosmic ray flux @xcite ,",
    "a mass range around 50 gev with a reasonable local abundance ( which permits to consider it as a dark matter candidate ) is still open .    in some supersymmetric models",
    "the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) can be the sneutrino , @xmath47 , the spin-0 partner of the neutrino .",
    "in supersymmetric theories with no violation of leptonic number , a sneutrino with mass in the range @xmath48 could have a relevant cosmological abundance ( @xmath49 ) @xcite ; however , because of its large interaction cross sections , the sneutrino can not generally be considered as major component of cold dark matter .",
    "anyhow , a sneutrino as a candidate remains still possible in supersymmetric models with violation of lepton number @xcite . in this framework",
    "the sneutrino can exist in two mass states , @xmath50 , with a @xmath51 mass splitting ( for @xmath52 ) , being @xmath53 a term introduced by the leptonic number violating operator .",
    "the two mass eigenstates have off - diagonal coupling with @xmath46 boson and only couplings between @xmath54 e @xmath55 exist . as a consequence ,",
    "the elastic scattering cross section on nuclei is extremely low @xcite and sneutrinos with mass around 40 - 80 gev and @xmath56 about 5 gev could have cosmological relic abundance in the range 0.1 - 1 @xcite . moreover , whatever scalars would be introduced in the theory , they can mix with sneutrinos and , consequently , the gauge interaction would be reduced through the mixing angle @xcite .",
    "the suppression of this interaction implies a sizeable relic abundance of the sneutrino even for low @xmath56 values ( e.g. around @xmath57 kev ) .",
    "a similar sneutrino has been proposed as a possible wimp candidate providing  through the transition from lower to upper mass eigenstate ",
    "inelastic scattering with nuclei @xcite ( see also later ) .",
    "finally , we remind that  in principle  even whatever massive and weakly interacting particle , not yet foreseen by theories , can be a good candidate as wimp .    in the following we will focus our attention on the wimp direct detection technique in underground laboratory , where the low environmental background allows to reach the highest sensitivity ; this is the process investigated by dama / nai .",
    "we will later mention few arguments on the indirect detection approach , mainly in the light of some recent analyses .",
    "the wimp direct detection approach mainly investigates the wimp elastic scattering on the nuclei of a target - detector ; the recoil energy is the measured quantity .",
    "in fact , the additional possibility to investigate the wimp - nucleus inelastic scattering producing low - lying excited nuclear states ( originating successive de - excitation gamma rays and , thus , presence of characteristic peaks in the measured energy spectrum ) is disfavoured by the very small expected counting rate ; for this reason , only few preliminary efforts have been carried out so far on this subject@xcite .    in the following subsections only few general arguments are addressed on the direct detection approach , while we simply remind that most experienced detection techniques have already been briefly commented in ref .",
    "@xcite , mainly in the light of a possible effective search for a wimp signature .",
    "a direct search for dark matter particles requires : i ) a suitable deep underground site to reduce at most the background contribution from cosmic rays ; ii ) a suitable low background hard shield against electromagnetic and neutron background ; iii ) a deep selection of low background materials and a suitable identification of radio - purification techniques to build a low background set - up ; iv ) severe protocols and rules for building , transporting , handling , installing the detectors ; v ) an effective radon removal system and control on the environment nearby the detectors ; vi ) a good model independent signature ; vii ) an effective monitoring of the running conditions at the level of accuracy required by the investigated wimp signature .    as an example of the suitable performances of a deep underground laboratory we remind those measured at the gran sasso national laboratory of i.n.f.n . where the dama / nai experiment has been carried out : i ) muon flux : 0.6 muons m@xmath58 h@xmath8@xcite ; ii ) thermal neutron flux : 1.08 @xmath59 neutrons cm@xmath58 s@xmath8@xcite ; iii ) epithermal neutron flux : 1.98 @xmath59 neutrons cm@xmath58",

    "the low background technique requires very long and accurate work for the selection of low radioactive materials by sample measurements with hp - ge detectors ( placed deep underground in suitable hard shields ) and/or by mass spectrometer analyses ; thus , these measurements are often difficult experiments themselves , depending on the required level of radiopurity .",
    "in addition , uncertainties due to the sampling procedures and to the subsequent handling of the selected materials to build the apparata also require further time and efforts . as an example of an investigation of materials and detector radiopurity",
    ", one can consider ref .",
    "@xcite , where the residual radioactivity measured in materials and detectors developed for dama / nai is reported .",
    "moreover , some arguments on how to further improve the radiopurity of nai(tl ) detectors ( largely followed e.g. in the developments of the new dama / libra set - up , now in test runs ) can be found e.g. in ref .",
    "an interesting paper on the low background techniques is also e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "main efforts regard the reduction of standard contaminants : @xmath63u and @xmath64th ( because of their rich chains ) and @xmath65k ( because of its large presence in nature ) .",
    "when suitable radiopurity is reached for these components , the possible presence of non - standard contaminants should be also seriously investigated by devoted measurements . as shown e.g. in ref .",
    "@xcite for the case of a ionizing ge experiment , several orders of magnitude of rate reduction can be obtained with time and efforts in improving the experimental conditions .",
    "since often the used statistics in direct experiments is very poor , the simple comparison of the measured energy distribution with an expectation from a given model framework is carried out .",
    "this `` traditional '' approach  the only one which can be pursued by either small scale or very poor duty cycle experiments  allows only to calculate model dependent limits on wimp - nucleus cross section at given c.l .. in fact , although for long time the limits achieved by this approach have been presented as robust reference points , similar results are quite uncertain not only because of possible underestimated systematics when relevant data handling and reduction is performed , but also because the result refers only to a specific model framework .",
    "in fact the model is identified not only by the general astrophysical , nuclear and particle physics assumptions , but also by the needed theoretical and experimental parameters and by the set of values chosen in the calculations for them .",
    "some of these parameters , such as the wimp local velocity , @xmath66 , and other halo parameters , form factors parameters , quenching factor , etc .",
    "are also affected by significant uncertainties .",
    "therefore the calculation of the expected differential rate , which has to be compared with the experimental one in order to evaluate an exclusion plot in the plane wimp cross section versus wimp mass , is strongly model dependent .    as an example , fig .",
    "[ fg : caf94 ] shows how an exclusion plot is modified by changing ( within the intervals allowed by the present determinations ) the values of the astrophysical velocities @xcite .",
    "analogous effects will be obtained when varying  within allowed values  every other of the several needed parameters as well as when varying every one of the general assumptions considered in the calculations .",
    "thus , each exclusion plot should be considered only strictly correlated with the `` cooking list '' of the used experimental / theoretical assumptions and parameters as well as with detailed information on possible data reduction / selection , on efficiencies , calibration procedures , etc . moreover , since wimp - nucleus cross sections on different nuclei can not directly be compared , generally cross sections normalized to the wimp - nucleon one are presented ; this adds further uncertainties in the results and in the comparisons , requiring the assumptions of scaling laws .",
    "thus , comparisons should be very cautious since they have not an universal character .",
    "in addition , different experiments can have e.g. different sensitivity to the different possible wimp couplings .    in conclusion ,",
    "this model dependent approach has no general meaning , no potentiality of discovery and - by its nature - can give only `` negative '' results .",
    "therefore , experiments offering model independent signature for wimp presence in the galactic halo are mandatory .      in order to overcome the long and difficult work of developing very low background set - ups , strategies to reject electromagnetic background from the data",
    "are sometimes pursued .",
    "this can be realized in several scintillators by pulse shape discrimination ( since electrons show a different decay time respect to nuclear recoils , as carried out in nai(tl ) and lxe e.g. by dama / nai in ref .",
    "@xcite and by dama / lxe in ref .",
    "@xcite ) or by comparing , for the same event , two different signals ( when the recoil / electron response ratio is expected to be different , such as heat / ionization in ge or si @xcite and heat / light in cawo@xmath67 @xcite ) . the first case offers a relatively safer approach than the second one since basic quantities ( such as e.g. the sensitive volume ) are well defined , while the second one is more uncertain .",
    "just as an example , in case of heat / ionization read - out the precise knowledge of the effective sensitive volume for each one of the two signals and the related efficiencies as a function of the energy are required .",
    "a further discrimination strategy , which uses a two - phases gas / liquid xenon detector with an applied electric field , has been also suggested for future experiments ; there the light amplitudes of the primary and of the secondary scintillation pulses are compared @xcite .",
    "however , in this case the discrimination critically depends e.g. on the definition of the real sensitive volume , on the dependence of the discrimination power with ionization position , on gas purity , etc .    in every case , whatever strategy is followed , always only a statistical discrimination is possible ( on the contrary of what is often claimed ) because e.g. of tail effects from the two populations , from the noise , etc .",
    "furthermore , the existence of known concurrent processes ( due e.g. to end - range alphas , neutrons , fission fragments or in some case also the so  called surface electrons ) , whose contribution can not be estimated and subtracted in any reliable manner at the needed level of precision , excludes that an unambiguous result on wimp presence can be obtained following a similar approach .",
    "moreover , when using similar procedures , the real reached sensitivity is based e.g. on the proper estimate of the systematic errors , on the accuracy of all the involved procedures and on the proper accounting of all the related efficiencies , on the proper knowledge of the energy scale and energy threshold ( see also  [ sc : qf ] ) and on the verified stability of the running conditions .",
    "consider e.g. the difficulty to manage the efficiency due to the coincidence of the few kev heat / ionization or heat / scintillation signals or , in case of the two - phases lxe detectors , the triggering of the primary and secondary scintillations .",
    "we note also that sometimes in literature some methodologically uncorrect methods are also considered which allow to claim for a larger sensitivity than the correct one .",
    "in conclusion , the possibility to achieve a control of the systematic error in rejection procedures at level of @xmath68 , as it has recently been claimed ( see  [ compdir ] ) , appears unlikely whatever rejection approach would be considered .",
    "finally , it is worth to note that rejection strategies can not safely be applied to the data when a model independent signature based on the correlation of the measured experimental rate with the earth galactic motion is pursued ( see later ) ; in fact , the effect searched for ( which is typically at level of few % ) would be largely affected by the uncertainties associated to the  always statistical  rejection procedure . on the other hand",
    "the signature itself acts as an effective background rejection as pointed out e.g. for the wimp annual modulation signature since ref .",
    "@xcite .      to obtain a reliable signature for wimps",

    "the @xmath103 and @xmath104 are functions of the parameters associated with the wimp interacting particle ( such as e.g. mass and interaction cross sections ) , of the experimental response of the detector , of the considered model framework and of the related parameters ( see later ) .",
    "it is worth to note that the s@xmath105 values can be not only positive , but also negative or zero , due to the expected energy distribution profiles in june and in december within a finite energy window @xcite .",
    "therefore , the highest sensitivity can be obtained when considering the smallest energy bins allowed by the available statistics in the energy region of interest .",
    "although the modulation effect is expected to be relatively small ( the fractional difference between the maximum and the minimum of the rate is of order of @xmath0 7% ) , a suitable large - mass , low - radioactive set - up with an efficient control of the running conditions  such as dama / nai @xcite  would point out its presence .",
    "in fact , a suitable correlation analysis can allow to extract even a small periodic component , superimposed with a time independent signal and a background @xcite . with the present technology ,",
    "the annual modulation remains the main signature of a wimp signal .",
    "in addition , the annual modulation signature is very distinctive since a wimp - induced seasonal effect must simultaneously satisfy all the following requirements : the rate must contain a component modulated according to a cosine function ( 1 ) with one year period ( 2 ) and a phase that peaks roughly around @xmath0 2@xmath87 june ( 3 ) ; this modulation must only be found in a well - defined low energy range , where wimp induced recoils can be present ( 4 ) ; it must apply to those events in which just one detector of many actually `` fires '' , since the wimp multi - scattering probability is negligible ( 5 ) ; the modulation amplitude in the region of maximal sensitivity must be @xmath247@xmath96 ( 6 ) . only systematic effects able to fulfil these 6 requirements could mimic this signature and  as far as we know  no other effect investigated so far in the field of rare processes offers a so stringent and unambiguous signature .",
    "of course , the amount of the measured effect depends e.g. on the sensitivity of the experiment to the coupling of the wimp candidate , on the wimp particle physics features , on the nuclear features of the used target - nucleus and on the quality of the running conditions .",
    "the dama experiment has been worked and works as an observatory for rare processes ( such as wimp direct detection , @xmath106 decay processes , charge - non - conserving processes , pauli exclusion principle violating processes , nucleon instability , solar axions and exotics @xcite ) by developing and using low radioactive scintillators .",

    "the dama / nai set - up @xcite can effectively exploit the wimp annual modulation signature because of its well known technology , of its high intrinsic radiopurity , of its mass , of its suitable control of all the operational parameters and of the deep underground experimental site .    the detailed description of the @xmath0 100 kg nai(tl ) dama set - up , of its radiopurity , of its performance , of the used hardware procedures , of the determination of the experimental quantities and of the data reduction has been given in refs .",

    "here we only recall that the detectors used in the annual modulation studies are nine 9.70 kg highly radiopure nai(tl ) scintillators especially built for this purpose in a joint effort with crismatec company .",
    "the bare nai(tl ) crystals are encapsulated in suitably radiopure cu housings ; 10 cm long tetrasil - b light guides act as optical windows on the two end faces of the crystals and are coupled to specially developed emi9265-b53/fl photomultipliers ( pmt ) , which are supplied by positive voltage with ground cathode .",
    "the two pmts of a detector work in coincidence and their threshold is set at the single photoelectron level ; the measured light response is 5.5  7.5 photoelectrons / kev depending on the detector @xcite .",

    "the detectors are inside a low radioactivity sealed copper box installed in the center of a low radioactivity cu / pb / cd - foils / polyethylene / paraffin shield .",

    "the copper box is maintained in a high purity ( hp ) nitrogen atmosphere in slightly overpressure with respect to the external environment .",
    "furthermore , also the whole shield is sealed and maintained in the hp nitrogen atmosphere .",

    "this is accomplished using fast vxi tektronix four - channel tvs641a digitizers with a sampling frequency of 1 gsample / s and 250 mhz bandwidth .",
    "the digitizers provide a vxi word - serial protocol for commands , while a specific fast data channel ( fdc ) driver developed by @xcite has been used to speed up the data transfer through the gpib bus .",
    "the main trigger part of the electronic schema and the high energy data acquisition are also similar to the ones in the previously used electronic chain @xcite .    for completeness and for template purpose ,",
    "let us briefly describe this new electronic chain .",
    "the signal @xmath108 ( see fig . [",
    "fg : st ] for the definition of the symbols ) from the first pmt is sent to the @xmath109 preamplifier having 0 - 250 mhz bandwidth , a factor 10 gain and a voltage integral linearity @xmath110 .",
    "the signal @xmath111 from the second pmt is divided in two branches : 19/20 of the signal is sent to the input of the @xmath112 preamplifier , while the remaining 1/20  suitably delayed  feeds a charge adc ( @xmath113 ) channel .",
    "this last part processes the pulses with amplitude such to saturate the remaining part of the electronics ( they correspond to high energy events ) .",
    "the preamplified signals  through linear fan - in / fan - out devices  provide the inputs for the charge adcs ( left signals and right signals ) and for the vxi waveform analyzer ( @xmath114 in fig . [ fg : st ] ) ( which processes the signal in a 2 @xmath40s time window ) .",
    "the electronic devices , that provide the trigger of a single detector , are shown in fig .",
    "[ fg : st ] .",
    "in particular , the copies of the pmt signals are the inputs of the timing filter amplifiers ( @xmath115 and @xmath116 ) which amplify and integrate the signal ( integration time 50 ns ) ; their outputs are discriminated ( @xmath117 and @xmath118 ) with single photoelectron trigger level .",
    "the coincidence ( @xmath119 ) between the two logical nim outputs provides the @xmath120 trigger of the detector .",
    "the other inputs of @xmath119 are : the signal @xmath121 given by a gate generator ( @xmath122 ) which allows to reject afterglow and bi - po events in a 500@xmath40s time window after the occurrence of the event ( introducing a systematic error on the measured rate of about 10@xmath123 ) and the signal @xmath124 given by a camac i / o register .",
    "the latter permits to enable or disable the @xmath120 detector trigger during the calibrations .",
    "the outputs of @xmath119 provide : i ) the signal for a camac scaler ( @xmath125 ) to count the events for each detector ; ii ) the @xmath126 and @xmath127 used in the main trigger ( see later ) ; iii ) @xmath128 giving the start to the gate generator ( @xmath122 ) which - in addition to the veto of the coincidence  gives the signal @xmath129 issued to a 16-bit camac i / r pattern recognition which allows to identify the detector or the detectors which have generated the trigger .    the general trigger of the acquisition ",
    "[ fg : st ]  is provided by the logic @xmath130 of all the crystals .",
    "the output of @xmath131 is issued to a scaler , which counts the number of main triggers sent to the coincidence @xmath132 .",
    "the coincidence @xmath132 generates triggers only when the acquisition is ready to manage them .",
    "therefore , the dead time of the acquisition is properly accounted in the estimate of the running time by using the information from the scaler after @xmath131 .",
    "when a general trigger occurs , the following logic signals are issued to : i ) the gate generator ( @xmath133 ) generating the 600 ns gates the charge adcs ; ii ) the delay gate generator which gives the strobe signal to the i / r pattern recognition and generates the lam ( and , therefore , the interrupt to the cpu of the acquisition computer ) in the camac system ; iii ) the delay gate generator which gives the signal to the trigger of the waveform analyzers .",
    "this last condition is verified only if the total energy deposited in the detectors is in an energy window suitably chosen ( 1 to 90 kev ) . for this purpose ,",
    "each line feds a spectroscopy amplifier whose gain is equalized in order to have the same response for each detector .",
    "therefore , a single channel analyzer made by the two discriminators , _ discrim ll _ and _ discrim ul _ , allows to select only events in the chosen energy window .    a devoted electronic circuit @xcite , shown in fig .",
    "[ fg : st ] , allows to trigger only the @xmath107 s which correspond to fired detectors ; it gives a trigger to each @xmath107 when : i ) at least one of its corresponding lines has a trigger ; ii ) the _ main trigger _",
    "is present ; iii ) the total energy of the events is in the chosen energy window .",
    "let us remind that for the events with energy outside this energy window ( e.g. high energy events ) the adc values are acquired in any case .",
    "as regards other aspects , we recall that the linearity and the energy resolution of the detectors have been investigated using several sources @xcite such as , for the low energy region , @xmath134fe ( 5.9 kev x - rays ) , @xmath135cd ( 22 kev x - rays and 88 kev @xmath83 line ) and @xmath136am ( 59.5 kev @xmath83 line ) sources . in particular , in the production runs , the knowledge of the energy scale is assured by periodical calibrations with @xmath136am source and by monitoring ( in the production data themselves summed every @xmath0 7 days ) the position and energy resolution of the 46.5 kev @xmath83 line of the @xmath137pb @xcite .",
    "the latter peak is present  at level of few counts per day per kg ( cpd / kg )  in the measured energy distributions mainly because of a contamination ( by environmental radon ) of the external surface of the crystals cu housings , occurred during the first period of the underground storage of the detectors .",
    "the calibration sources are introduced in the proximity of the detectors by means of the pipes connected  as already described  with the upper `` glove - box '' , which is also continuously maintained in the hp nitrogen atmosphere .    as in every experiment in the field , obvious noise events (",
    "whose number sharply decreases when increasing the number of available photoelectrons ) have to be removed ; the used procedure has been described e.g. in refs .",
    "@xcites veto time ; see above ) induced by high energy events or from any possible @xmath138erenkov pulse in the light guide or in the pmts ; in fact , they also have time decay of order of tens ns as the noise events . ] .",
    "we remind that the noise in this experiment is given by pmt fast single photoelectrons with decay times of the order of tens ns , while the `` physical '' ( scintillation ) pulses have decay times of order of hundreds ns .",
    "thus , the large difference in decay times and the relatively large number of available photoelectrons response assure an effective noise rejection @xcite .",
    "several variables can be built by using the pulse information recorded by the waveform analyzer @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , for each energy bin , we plot the @xmath139 = @xmath140 value versus the @xmath141 = @xmath142 value calculated for every event . in the @xmath143 plane the slow scintillation pulses are grouped roughly around ( @xmath144 , @xmath145 ) well separated from the noise population which is grouped around small @xmath141 and high @xmath139 values ( see e.g. ref .",
    "the scintillation pulses are selected by applying an acceptance window in @xmath143 . since the statistical spread of the two populations in the @xmath143 plane becomes larger when the number of available photoelectrons and the signal / noise ratio decrease , windows with smaller acceptance become necessary to maintain the same noise rejection power . in the dama / nai experiment",
    "they are kept enough stringent to assure also the absence of any possible residual noise tail in the scintillation data to be analysed @xcite . according to standard procedures ,",
    "the acceptance of the considered window for scintillation pulses in the @xmath143 plane is determined by applying the same procedure to the scintillation data induced  in the same energy intervals  by calibration sources @xcite .",
    "in particular , for this purpose , about 10@xmath25 - 10@xmath146 events per kev are typically collected in the low energy region just above the 2 kev software energy threshold during routine calibration runs @xcite .",
    "all the periodical long calibration procedures @xcite and the time specifically allocated for maintenance and/or for improvements are the main components affecting the duty cycle of the experiment .",
    "moreover , in the dama / nai-1 running period the data have been taken only in the two extreme conditions for the annual modulation signature ( see table [ tab : modep ] ) .",
    "the energy threshold , the pmt gain , the electronic line stability are continuously verified and monitored during the data taking by the routine calibrations , by the position and energy resolution of the @xmath137pb line ( see above ) and by the study of the hardware rate behaviours with time .",
    "in particular , the measured low energy distributions of interest for the wimp investigation have been given in refs .",
    "@xcite , where the corrections for efficiencies and acquisition dead time have already been applied . we note that usually in dama / nai the low energy distributions refer to those events where only one detector of many actually fires ( that is , each detector has all the others in the same installation as veto ; this assures a background reduction , which is of course impossible when a single detector is used ) .",
    "the presence of a model independent effect has been firstly pointed out since the taup conference in 1997 @xcite and corollary model dependent quests for a candidate particle have been analysed in some of the many possible model frameworks , improving the quest with time ( see table [ tab : modep ] ) .",
    "cumulatively during four annual cycles a model independent effect ( exposures up to 57986 kg @xmath1 day ; see table [ tab : modep ] ) has been pointed out @xcite .",
    "no systematics or side reactions able to mimic the annual modulation signature has been found @xcite ; this can be well understood when considering the particularly stringent and numerous specific requirements which identify the wimp annual modulation signature itself ( see  [ sc : sign ] ) .",
    ".summary of the first running periods which have already cumulatively shown a 4 @xmath2 c.l .",
    "model independent effect .",
    "the related references are given in the third column .",
    "in the last column the improvements with time in the model - dependent quest for the candidate are summarized .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tb : cli1 ]    as it can be seen , significant differences in the measured values are present also for the same nucleus in the same kind of detectors .",
    "this is generally due to different peculiarities of the detectors themselves , besides possible additional experimental uncertainties .",
    "for example , in doped scintillator it can depend on the dopant concentration , in liquid xenon on the residual trace contaminants due to specific experimental features ( such as the initial purity of the used xenon gas , the inner surface treatment , the level of vacuum reached before filling , the used purification line components and the degassing / release features of all the materials of the inner vessel ) and in ge or si on impurities , etc .",
    "moreover , some dependence of the recoil /electron response ratio on the energy has been quoted in several cases ( see table [ tb : cli1 ] ) .",
    "as far as regards the bolometers , no direct measurement of the recoil energy of the target - nucleus has been reported up to now by any of the groups involved in this activity , although several bolometers have been irradiated with neutrons along the past decade . for the sake of completeness",
    ", we remind that a measurement of the response of a teo@xmath147 bolometer to surface @xmath148ra recoiling nuclei has been reported in ref . @xcite ; this measurement , although its importance , does not represent a determination of the quenching factor of the target- ( either te or o ) nuclei of the teo@xmath147 bolometer .",
    "in fact , the recoiling nuclei are not the te and o ones and the `` external '' recoils are generated on the detector surface where the sensors are located and , thus , do not involve the response of the whole bulk of the target - detector .",
    "anyhow , these values can not of course be extended to whatever kind of bolometer .",
    "besides the uncertainties already discussed , there exist a large number of experimental details that have to be considered in the calculations of the signal expectations .",
    "for example , it must be suitably studied , checked , monitored and discussed the role played by the stability of the energy scale , by its right evaluation ( see also  [ sc : qf ] ) , by a reliable identification of the energy threshold and of the residual noise above it ( as it can be effectively done in nai(tl ) detectors with adequate number of photoelectrons / kev , see e.g. @xcite ) , by external veto ( especially when `` high '' rate anticoincidences are used ) and by the rejection procedures used in some experiments to filter the data , etc .. in the case of dama / nai details have been given along the last about ten years and published ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "finally , let us remind that  when results obtained by using different target nuclei are considered  also the effect of the uncertainty on the scaling laws of the nuclear cross sections to the _ reference _ ones ( e.g. , generally , on nucleon ) must be taken into account .",
    "in fact , it is common practice to use the wimp - nucleon cross sections @xmath149 and @xmath150 and the scaling laws reported in  [ sc : rate1 ] ; but  in principle  other scaling laws can not be excluded at the present knowledge of the real nature of a wimp candidate .",
    "this can be an additional uncertainty in quests for a candidate and in comparisons among experiments using different target nuclei .",
    "it is common practice in extracting physical information from the data to account for related priors .    in particular , in the quest for the candidate particle two main priors",
    "have been considered in the dama / nai first quests for a candidate @xcite .",
    "the first prior , which has been properly included in ref .",
    "@xcite and also considered in the following , accounts for the upper limits measured on the recoil fractions in the data of the dama / nai-0 running period @xcite , which was carefully and especially devoted to such an investigation .",
    "the second prior regards the mass limit for supersymmetric candidates , achieved  within some assumed model frameworks  by experiments at accelerators .",
    "in particular , because of this prior , wimp masses above 30 gev ( 25 gev in ref .",
    "@xcite ) have been investigated in refs .",
    "@xcite for few ( of the many possible ) model frameworks . specifically , it accounted for the lower bound on the neutralino mass as derived from the lep data in the adopted supersymmetric schemes based on gut assumptions @xcite . however , other model assumptions are possible and would imply significant variations of some accelerators bounds . as an example , we mention the recent ref .",
    "@xcite where the assumption on the gaugino - mass unification at gut scale has been released .",
    "6 gev are possible , this lower bound being determined by current upper limit on relic abundance for cold dark matter ( somewhat higher values of 15 - 18 gev are obtained for the neutralino mass lower bound , if higgs masses are assumed large (   1 tev ) @xcite . ]",
    "the development of these schemes is very interesting since  as well known ",
    "dama / nai is intrinsically sensitive both to low and high wimp mass having both a light ( the @xmath151na ) and a heavy ( the @xmath152i ) target - nucleus .",
    "however , still following the present model dependent results quoted by lep in the supersymmetric schemes based on gut assumptions the considered lower bound is at present 37 gev @xcite .",
    "it worth to note that this mass limit selects the wimp - iodine elastic scattering as dominant because of the adopted scaling laws and of kinematical arguments .      just as a corollary of the model independent result given in ",

    "in fact , often the spin - independent interaction with ordinary matter is assumed to be dominant since e.g. most of the used target - nuclei are practically not sensitive to sd interactions ( as on the contrary @xmath151na and @xmath152i are ) and the theoretical calculations are even much more complex and uncertain .",
    "thus , following an analogous procedure as for the previous case , we have exploited for the same model frameworks the purely si scenario alone . in this case",
    "the free parameters are two : @xmath159 and @xmath160 .    in fig .",
    "[ fg : fig_puresi ] the region allowed in the plane @xmath159 and @xmath175 for the considered model frameworks is reported .",
    "the vertical dotted line represents the model dependent prior discussed in ",
    "[ sc : pri ] , that is the present lower bound on supersymmetric candidate as derived from the lep data in supersymmetric scheme with gaugino - mass unification at gut ( see  [ sc : pri ] ) .",
    "the configurations below the vertical line can be of interest for neutralino when other schemes are considered ( see  [ sc : pri ] ) and for generic wimp candidate . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fg : fig_puresi ] , also wimp masses above 200 gev are allowed , in particular , for every set of parameters values when considering low local velocity and : i ) the evans logarithmic @xmath176 and @xmath177 co - rotating halo models ; ii ) the triaxial @xmath178 and @xmath179 non - rotating halo models ; iii ) the evans power - law @xmath180 model , but only with parameters as in set a ) .",
    "of course , best fit values of cross section and wimp mass span over a large range depending on the model framework . just as an example , in the triaxial d2 halo model with maximal @xmath181 , @xmath182 km / s and parameters as in the case @xmath157 , the best fit values are @xmath183 gev and @xmath184 pb .    _ * effect of a sd component different from zero on allowed si regions * _    let us now point out , in addition , that configurations with @xmath160 even much lower than those shown in fig .",
    "[ fg : fig_puresi ] would be accessible also if an even small sd contribution would be present in the interaction as described in  [ sc : sisd ] .",
    "this possibility is clearly pointed out in fig .",
    "[ fg : fig_sifsd ] where an example of regions in the plane ( @xmath159 , @xmath160 ) corresponding to different sd contributions are reported for the case @xmath185 . in this example the evans logarithmic axisymmetric @xmath177 halo model with @xmath182 km / s , @xmath181 equal to the maximum value for this model ( see table [ tb : rho ] ) and the set of parameters @xmath153 have been considered .",
    "the values of @xmath186 range there from 0 to 0.08 pb .",
    "as it can be seen , increasing the sd contribution the regions allowed in the ( @xmath159 , @xmath160 ) plane involve si cross sections much lower than @xmath187 pb .",
    "it can be noted that for @xmath188 pb the annual modulation effect observed is also compatible  for @xmath189 gev  with a wimp candidate with no si interaction at all in this particular model framework .",
    "these arguments clearly show that also a relatively small sd contribution can drastically change the allowed region in the ( @xmath159 , @xmath160 ) plane ; therefore , e.g. there is not meaning in the bare comparison between regions allowed in experiments that are also sensitive to sd coupling and exclusion plots achieved by experiments that are not .",
    "the same is when comparing regions allowed by experiments whose target - nuclei have unpaired proton with exclusion plots quoted by experiments using target - nuclei with unpaired neutron when the sd component of the wimp interaction would correspond either to @xmath190 or @xmath191      let us now focus on the case of a candidate with purely spin - dependent    coupling to which dama / nai is  as mentioned  fully sensitive .",
    "when the sd component is different from zero , a very large number of possible configurations is available ( see  [ sc : rate1 ] ) .",
    "in fact , in this scenario the space of free parameters is a 3-dimensional volume defined by @xmath159 , @xmath161 and @xmath72 ( which can vary from 0 to @xmath86 ) . here , for simplicity as already done in ",
    "[ sc : sisd ] , we show the results obtained only for 4 particular couplings , which correspond to the following values of the mixing angle @xmath72 : i ) @xmath72 = 0 ( @xmath162 = 0 and @xmath163 0 or @xmath164 ; ii ) @xmath165 ( @xmath166 ) ; iii ) @xmath72 = @xmath167 ( @xmath168 0 and @xmath169 = 0 or @xmath170 ; iv ) @xmath72 = 2.435 rad ( @xmath171 = -0.85 ) .    fig .",
    "[ fg : fig_puresd ] shows the regions allowed in the plane ( @xmath159 , @xmath186 ) for the same model frameworks quoted above ; other configurations are possible varying the @xmath72 value .",
    "the area at wimp masses above 200 gev is allowed for low local velocity ",
    "@xmath66=170km / s  and all considered sets of parameters by the evans logarithmic @xmath177 co - rotating halo model .    moreover ,",
    "the accounting for the uncertainties e.g. on the spin factors as well as different possible formulations of the sd form factors would extend the allowed regions , e.g. towards lower @xmath186 values .",
    "finally , @xmath161 lower than those corresponding to the regions shown in fig .",
    "[ fg : fig_puresd ] are possible also e.g. in case of an even small si contribution , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fg : fig_puresd2 ] .",
    "an analysis considering the same model frameworks has been carried out for the case of wimps with _ preferred",
    "_ inelastic interaction ( see  [ sc : inel ] ) .    in this inelastic dark matter scenario",
    "an allowed volume in the space ( @xmath192,@xmath159,@xmath56 ) is obtained . for simplicity ,",
    "[ fg : fig_inel ] shows slices of such an allowed volume at some given wimp masses .",
    "there the superpositions of the allowed regions obtained , when varying the model framework within the considered set , are shown for each @xmath159 . as a consequence",
    ", the cross section value at given @xmath56 can span over several orders of magnitude .",
    "the upper border of each region is reached when @xmath193 approximates the maximum wimp velocity in the earth frame for each considered model framework .",
    "it can also be noted that when @xmath194 , the expected differential energy spectrum is trivially dependent on @xmath159 and , in particular , it is proportional to the ratio between @xmath192 and @xmath159 ; therefore for very high mass the allowed region can be obtained straightforward . we remind that in these calculations @xmath195 has been assumed at fixed value , while its present uncertainties can play a significant role in the scenario of wimp with _ preferred inelastic _ scattering as mentioned in  [ sc : inel ] .",
    "note that each set of values ( within those allowed by the associated uncertainties ) for the previously mentioned parameters gives rise to a different expectation , thus to a different best fit values .",
    "as an example we mention the best fit values for @xmath159 = 70 gev in the nfw b5 halo model with @xmath66 = 170 km / s , maximal @xmath181 in this model and parameters as in case b ) : @xmath196 kev and @xmath197 pb .      in this section the possible nature of a candidate , which could account for the observed model independent evidence , has been investigated by exploring  as already done on the partial statistics @xcite  various kinds of possible couplings and some ( of the many ) possible model frameworks .",
    "we stress that , although several scenarios have been investigated , the analyses are not exhaustive at all of the existing possibilities because of the poor present knowledge on many astrophysical , nuclear and particle physics assumptions and related parameters as well as of the existing uncertainties in the determination of some experimental parameters which are necessary in the calculations . for example , other parameters values can be considered for the investigated halo models as well as other different halo models too , other form factors and related parameters , other spin factors etc .. we remind that analogous uncertainties are present in every model dependent result ( such as e.g. exclusion plots and wimp parameters from indirect searches ) ; thus , intrinsically , bare comparisons have always only a very relative meaning .    the discussion , carried out in this section , has also allowed to introduce the main general arguments related to the model dependent calculations in wimp direct searches .",
    "in this paper general aspects of the dark matter direct search have been reviewed in the light of the activity and results achieved by the dama / nai experiment at the gran sasso national laboratory of i.n.f.n .. dama / nai has been a pioneer experiment running at lngs for several years and investigating as first the wimp annual modulation signature with suitable sensitivity and control of the running parameters . during seven independent experiments of one year each one , it has pointed out the presence of a modulation satisfying the many peculiarities of a wimp induced effect , reaching a significant evidence . as a corollary result , it has also pointed out the complexity of the quest for a wimp candidate because of the present poor knowledge on the many astrophysical , nuclear and particle physics aspects .    as regards other experiments  to have a realistic comparison  experiments investigating with the same sensitivity and control of the running condition the annual modulation signature are necessary .",
    "of course , the target nuclei also play a crucial role , since they can offer significantly different sensitivities depending e.g. on the nature of the wimp particle and on their nuclear properties .",
    "the growing in the field of serious and independent efforts searching for wimp model independent signatures will certainly contribute to increase the knowledge in the field as well as efforts to more deeply investigate models and parameters .",
    "some of the most competitive activities for the near future , exposing a significantly large target - mass , are starting at the gran sasso national laboratory : cuoricino , genius  tf ( which will also be devoted to the investigation of double beta decay processes ) and our new experiment dama / libra .",
    "in fact , on our behalf , after the completion of the data taking of the @xmath198 kg nai(tl ) set - up ( on july 2002 ) , as a result of our continuous efforts toward the creation of ultimate radiopure set - ups , the new dama / libra has been installed ( see ref .",
    "the libra set - up is made by 25 nai(tl ) detectors , 9.70 kg each one .",
    "the new detectors have been realised thanks to a second generation r&d with crismatec / saintgobain company , by exploiting in particular new radiopurification techniques of the nai and tli selected powders . in the framework of this",
    "r&d new materials have been selected , prototypes have been built and devoted protocols have been fixed and used .",
    "the whole installation has largely been modified .",
    "this new dama / libra set - up , having a larger exposed mass and an higher overall radiopurity , will offer a significantly increased sensitivity to contribute to further efforts in improving the understanding of this field .",
