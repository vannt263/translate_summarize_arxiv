    "transmission spectra acquired during primary transits , where light from the host star is filtered through the upper layers of an exoplanetary atmosphere , have been measured in the near- , mid- and far - infrared ( nir , mir and fir , respectively ) by both the @xmath3 @xmath4 @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) @xcite and @xmath7 telescope @xcite .",

    "the retrieval problem is ill - posed ( i.e. the number of unknowns is greater than the number of measurements ) and ill - conditioned ( i.e. small changes in the measurements can potentially have a disproportionately large effect on the solution ) so there is no single unique solution . instead , physically - realistic solutions and a range of uncertainty must be defined for the family of possibilities .",
    "following @xcite , we derive the optimal atmospheric state ( @xmath15 ) via the inclusion of additional _ a priori _ constraints , in the form of an @xmath10 @xmath16 state vector , @xmath17 , with error covariance matrix , @xmath18 . thus successive iterations are used to minimise the cost function , @xmath19 @xcite : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the forward model",

    "we compared spectra computed by line - by - line and correlated-@xmath14 models , and found that the mean difference between the two techniques is less than 5 per cent , which is considerably smaller than the range of uncertainties on available exoplanet measurements .    in the @xmath14-distribution method ,",

    "the @xmath14-coefficients are calculated from line data for a range of temperatures and pressures expected in the atmosphere in advance of the retrieval to enable rapid calculation of the transmission during each iteration .",
    "the molecular line lists used in this study were taken from hitemp2010 @xcite for h@xmath0o , the carbon dioxide spectroscopic databank ( cdsd-1000 ) @xcite ( also used for hitemp2010 ) for co@xmath0 , hitemp1995 @xcite for co , and the spherical top data system ( stds ) @xcite for ch@xmath1 .",

    "furthermore , nemesis calculates the matrix of the partial derivatives of radiances at each wavelength with respect to each retrieved variable , which are called the @xmath34 @xmath35 ( or @xmath36 ) , in order that the contribution of different atmospheric parameters at each wavelength can be easily interpreted by comparing the elements of this matrix .",

    "modelling we assumed that all species were well - mixed throughout the atmosphere and the molecular abundance was defined in terms of a single scaling parameter .",
    "this is because the retrieval of a continuous profile of composition would be under - constrained considering the small number of data points and the low spectral resolutions available , leading to non - physical oscillations in the retrieved profile .",
    "the @xmath10 @xmath16 estimate for the abundance scaling parameter is assumed to have a large uncertainty so that retrieved values are not weighted by initial guesses since a simple scaling parameter already includes vertical smoothing .",

    "we consider , however , that the inclusion of scattering clouds and hazes in our retrieval model is beyond the scope of the present study for a number of reasons : ( i ) the scattering properties of possible clouds and hazes is insufficiently known ; ( ii ) adding such particles would greatly enlarge an already large and poorly constrained parameter space and ; ( iii ) modelling scattering processes will significantly increase the computation time . in summary , the addition of scattering would increase the complexity of the model and does not appear to be warranted by the dayside emission spectra studied here .",

    "is taken from the kurucz grid model .    despite the substantial efforts towards finding and reducing the errors from the data , uncertainties on the given datasets still remain and are widely distributed over the wavelengths due to various error sources .",
    "first of all , techniques to decorrelate a transit light curve from the combined light of a planetary system are not consistent each other [ e.g. @xcite vs. @xcite ] .",
    "we will discuss the effects of underestimated errors on the dayside spectra in section 4.1 . also , systematic errors inherent in the observations themselves could be a strong error source .",
    "these two facts may cause the planet - star flux ratio to be dependent on the data reduction process .",
    "non concurrent observations for different wavelengths could cause large variations in the measured flux between observations if there is any significant temporal variability in the atmosphere of hd 189733b .",
    "therefore , all these sources of potential error could lead to substantial inconsistencies between the datasets taken from different studies , instruments , and observation times .",
    "although we do not intend to revisit the decorrelation procedures with this analysis , we aim to show the limitations of the spectra available at the present epoch under the assumption that the measurements are an accurate representation of the mean planetary flux .",

    "the @xmath40test indicates that an atmospheric composition for hd 189733b containing h@xmath0o and co@xmath0 are highly plausible at the @xmath4299.98% confidence level .",
    "the presence of these two molecules is required to obtain a reasonable fit to the available data .",
    "in addition , we find insignificant confidence levels ( i.e. @xmath4395% ) when we increase the complexity of the model by adding co , ch@xmath44 or a combination of the two to the simple model containing h@xmath0 , he , h@xmath0o and co@xmath0 .",
    "in other words , co and ch@xmath1 provide negligible enhancements to the fitting quality and are not required to fit the dayside emission measurements to within the stated error bars ( although upper limits on these species can certainly be derived ) .",
    "additionally , we consider the implications of @xcite , who claimed larger uncertainties on the @xmath6/nicmos data by re - processing its transmission spectrum @xcite .",
    "if the same conclusions are applicable to the secondary eclipse emission spectrum , then we must similarly increase the measurement error on the nicmos data by a factor of five .",
    "this leads to even smaller confidence levels on the more complex models , and the solutions are found to be even more degenerate . in this case , evaluating the @xmath40test significance using a variety of models still suggests that both h@xmath0o and co@xmath0 are required to reproduce the dayside emission spectra ( @xmath4299.29% confidence ) , but makes the presence of co and ch@xmath44 even more uncertain .",
    "we therefore conclude that , irrespective of the uncertainties on the @xmath6/nicmos data , current datasets are unable to provide detections of co and ch@xmath44 on the dayside of hd 189733b with any sort of statistical certainty .",

    "this discrepancy is not yet fully resolved , but , as @xcite stated , this may come from the difference in the forward models used for each study . in our spectrum ,",

    "its absence from the measured exoplanet spectrum is yet to be understood but may be related to the limited number of gases ( h@xmath0o , co@xmath0 , co , and ch@xmath1 ) and the absence of absorbing aerosols considered in our modelling .",

    "the retrieved profile shows that the constraints in the nir and mir lead to an adiabatically decreasing temperature between 0.11 bar .",
    "in addition , strong constraints from the @xmath7 irs measurements in the 916 @xmath2 m range suggest that the temperature structure in the mid and upper atmosphere ( 1100 mbar ) seems to be isothermal with a uniform temperature ( @xmath391100 k ) .",
    "one explanation for the isothermal layer is that super - rotating jets blowing from the night- to dayside play an critical role of an efficient energy re - distribution over the whole planet and may be responsible for maintaining the high temperature in the upper atmosphere @xcite .",
    "secondly , the functional derivatives for the molecules show that the measurements at nir ( 1.61.7 and 1.92.2 @xmath2 m ) , mir ( 4.5 @xmath2 m ) , and fir ( 916 @xmath2 m ) spectral ranges constrain the co@xmath0 abundance at @xmath39100 mbar but not in the upper atmosphere .",
    "its abundance in the lower atmosphere is responsible for the spectral flatness at 916 @xmath2 m , where previous studies assumed h@xmath0o to be the dominant constituent .",
    "we determine the vertical sensitivity of co@xmath0 abundance by comparing the retrievals with abundant ( 2.0@xmath4510@xmath61 ) and scarce co@xmath0 ( 10@xmath47 ) , and height - dependant co@xmath0 profile .",
    "the functional derivatives for co@xmath0 show low sensitivity at 0.11 mbar , which implies that the abundance of co@xmath0 in the upper atmosphere remains underconstrained by existing data .",
    "thirdly , we have quantified the degeneracies between the atmospheric properties using the cross - correlation functions .",
    "the correlations between molecular abundances and temperature exhibit substantial degeneracies , in particular , between temperature and h@xmath0o abundance at 300 mbar .",
    "we determine the temperature uncertainty at different pressure levels by calculating the statistics of the retrievals with the variation of each molecular mixing ratio . in the same way ,",
    "the molecular abundances are also constrained by demonstrating that the uncertainty on retrieved parameters , based on the available measurements and the degeneracy with the temperature profile is considerably larger than previous studies have suggested .",
    "therefore , additional data is clearly required to break the degeneracy between temperature and composition , particularly h@xmath0o . as long as the number of retrieval variables for the molecular abundance are kept to a small number ,",
    "the cross - correlation functions are not significant between molecules .",
    "if we were forced to use a more detailed representation of the vertical distributions of the gases and scattering properties , then the degeneracies would become more substantial .",
    "this study has shown the benefit of considering a wide spectral range for breaking the degeneracy between different atmospheric parameters . by constraining the overall shape of the infrared spectrum ,",
    "the @xmath6 and @xmath7 secondary eclipse data allow us to evaluate the vertical temperature structure and to place crude estimates on the molecular abundances in this hot jupiter .",
    "studies that focus on smaller wavelength ranges or fewer data points are subject to broader uncertainties than are currently being presented in the literature .",

    "<S> recent spectroscopic observations of transiting hot jupiters have permitted the derivation of the thermal structure and molecular abundances of h@xmath0o , co@xmath0 , co , and ch@xmath1 in these extreme atmospheres . here , </S>",
    "<S> for the first time , we apply the technique of optimal estimation to determine the thermal structure and composition of an exoplanet by solving the inverse problem . </S>",
    "<S> the development of a suite of radiative transfer and retrieval tools for exoplanet atmospheres is described , building upon a retrieval algorithm which is extensively used in the study of our own solar system . </S>",
    "<S> first , we discuss the plausibility of detection of different molecules in the dayside atmosphere of hd 189733b and the best - fitting spectrum retrieved from all publicly available sets of secondary eclipse observations between 1.45 and 24 @xmath2 m . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , we use contribution functions to assess the vertical sensitivity of the emission spectrum to temperatures and molecular composition . over the altitudes probed by the contribution functions , </S>",
    "<S> the retrieved thermal structure shows an isothermal upper atmosphere overlying a deeper adiabatic layer ( temperature decreasing with altitude ) , which is consistent with previously - reported dynamical and observational results . </S>",
    "<S> the formal uncertainties on retrieved parameters are estimated conservatively using an analysis of the cross - correlation functions and the degeneracy between different atmospheric properties . </S>",
    "<S> the formal solution of the inverse problem suggests that the uncertainties on retrieved parameters are larger than suggested in previous studies , and that the presence of co and ch@xmath1 is only marginally supported by the available data . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , by including as broad a wavelength range as possible in the retrieval , we demonstrate that available spectra of hd 189733b can constrain a family of potential solutions for the atmospheric structure .    </S>",
