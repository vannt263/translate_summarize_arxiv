    "the cluster containing a bright `` giant arc '' , which is an appropriate target for high - resolution spectroscopic studies .",
    "in addition , the cluster , which has a considerable einstein radius of probably @xmath14 , contains a large number of additional arcs and lensed galaxies .",
    "this cluster is probably as rich as the abell 1689 lensing cluster ( broadhurst et al . 2005 ) , and therefore it is an excellent target for detailed strong lensing and weak lensing modeling ( e.g. , bradac et al .",

    "2000 ) photometrically selected quasars .",
    "this search will be described elsewhere .",
    "our search uncovered a previously unknown cluster of galaxies in an sdss image .",
    "in addition to the cluster , a giant arc was clearly visible near the cluster , in the relatively shallow sdss images .    on utc 2008 jan 04 , we obtained @xmath15s @xmath16-band and @xmath17s @xmath18-band images of the cluster environment using the low resolution imaging spectrograph ( lris ; oke et al .",
    "1995 ) on the keck - i telescope , under seeing of @xmath19 .",

    "[ tab - pos ] we give the positions and photometry of the main arcs detected in the images .",
    "we have measured the magnitude of each arc , by combining all the light within a polygon defined by the sextractor segmentation ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) . in case sextractor broke an arc to several segments , we combined the light within these segments .",
    "the sextractor detection threshold was set to about 2-@xmath21 above background .",
    "on the same night , using lris ",
    "atmospheric dispersion compensator we also obtained a 1300s spectrum of the bright giant arc , labeled a1 ... a4 in fig .",

    "we used a @xmath22 slit with the 5600  dichroic ; the 400/3400 grism on the blue side ; and the 400/8500 grating , centered on @xmath23 , on the red arm . the slit position angle was set to @xmath24deg , in order to include also the blue ( sdss @xmath25 ) galaxy labeled cg2 in fig .",

    "the spectra of the galaxies cg2 and cg3 are shown in fig .",

    "the keck @xmath18-band image of the cluster is presented in fig .",
    "[ sdss1209r ] . in this figure , it is possible to identify many arc candidates , most of which are labeled ( a to k ) .",
    "we list the properties of these arcs and arc candidates in table  [ tab - pos ] . the most prominent arc in this system , labeled as a1a4 in fig .",
    "[ sdss1209r ] , is very large and bright .",
    "this arc is located about @xmath26 east of the brightest cluster galaxy , and its length is @xmath3 .",
    "the spectrum of the arc , presented in fig .",
    "[ giantarcspec ] , shows a single strong emission line and several absorption features , at a probable redshift of @xmath5 .",
    "we note that there is also an indication for a balmer decrement around 7700  ( observed wavelength ) .",
    "the redshift is based on the detection of a single emission line . therefore , we attempted to look for other possible explanations for this emission line , and we did  not find any other reasonable redshift solution .",
    "moreover , the einstein radius increases with source redshift",
    ". therefore , the relatively small einstein radius of arc - a implies that it is at relatively low redshift .",
    "its redshift , which places it in the background of the cluster , along with its unique appearance , confirms the nature of this arc as a lensed galaxy .",
    "the  einstein  radius of a system scales like @xmath27^{1/2}$ ] , where @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the angular diameter distances between the lens and source , observer and lens , and observer and source , respectively ( e.g. , narayan & bartelmann 1996 ) .",
    "therefore , for the system discussed here , we expect that the einstein radius for a @xmath31 system to be about @xmath32 larger than for a @xmath33 system , @xmath34 , h@xmath35kms@xmath36mpc@xmath36 ; spergel et al .",
    "( 2007 ) . ] .",
    "this suggest that at least some of the arclets further away from the center of the cluster are most probably strongly lensed background galaxies at higher redshifts .",
    "the brightest cluster galaxy , cg1 ( sdssj120923.69@xmath0264046.7 ) in fig .  [ sdss1209r ] , was observed spectroscopically by the sdss , and we find it to be at a redshift of 0.558 . as mentioned before , we also obtained a spectrum of the blue galaxies marked cg2 ( sdssj120924.41@xmath0264057.8 ) and cg3 ( sdssj120923.60@xmath0264059.9 ) in fig .",
    "[ sdss1209r ] .",
    "we measured a redshift of 0.542 to these galaxies using the h@xmath37 ( 4862.7 ) and [ oiii ] ( 5008.2 ) emission lines present in their spectra .",
    "given the redshift of the brightest cluster galaxy , we suggest that the cluster redshift is 0.558",
    ". however , confirmation of this redshift requires a redshift measurement for additional galaxies in this region .",
    ".positions and approximate magnitudes of most of the arc candidates detected in the keck @xmath18-band image ( fig .  [ sdss1209r ] ) .",
    "the magnitudes are approximate , and have typical uncertainties of 0.3mag .",

    "strong and weak lensing are being used to trace the mass distribution of galaxy clusters .",
    "however , detailed modeling of the mass distribution of the cores of galaxy clusters requires the identification of multiple images of lensed sources .",
    "such an identification needs good multi - band color information , or / and good spatial resolution ( e.g. , broadhusrt et al . 2005 ; sharon et al .",
    "indeed we are planing additional multi - band observations of this cluster , which will enable a detailed modeling of the cluster gravitational potential .    to confirm the presence of the cluster , in fig .",
    "[ fig : sdss1209_redsequence ] we show the color magnitude diagram for sdss galaxies found with @xmath38 from the cluster bright galaxy ( black circles ) . for comparison",
    ", we also show all the sdss galaxies found between @xmath39 and @xmath40 from the cluster bright galaxy ( gray dots ) . the solid ( dashed ) red - lines display the locus of elliptical ( sb ) galaxies as a function of redshift .",
    "these lines take into account the galactic extinction ( @xmath41mag ) in the direction of the cluster ( schlegel et al .",
    "1998 ; cardelli et al .",
    "it is evident , that in the cluster direction there is an excess of high - redshift galaxies , relative to the field .    at the approximate position of the bright cluster galaxy , we find a known rosat source ( voges et al . 2000 ) . using the pimms webtool , we converted the rosat / pspc count rate to an unabsorbed flux of @xmath42erg@xmath43s@xmath36 , assuming a galactic neutral hydrogen column density of @xmath44@xmath43 ( dickey & lockman 1990 ; kalberla et al .",
    "2005 ) and a power - law spectrum with a photon index of @xmath45 ( assuming thermal optically thin bremsstrahlung ) . given the luminosity distance to the cluster , this flux implies a luminosity of @xmath46ergs@xmath36 in the 0.12.4kev band . using the x - ray luminosity - mass relation given by reiprich & bhringer ( 2002 )",
    ", we estimate that the @xmath47 mass is the mass enclosed within @xmath48 , which is the radius in which the mean density equals 200 times the mean density of the universe ( e.g. , navarro , frenk , & white 1997 ) .",

    "we can also estimate the mass of the cluster from its einstein radius : @xmath51^{1/2}. \\label{er}\\ ] ] the einstein radius is a robust measure of the lens mass within this radius .",
    "although we did  not identify the counter - image(s ) of arc - a we can estimate the einstein radius based on the distance of the arc from the cluster bright galaxy ( @xmath52 ) . using eq .",
    "[ er ] we estimate that the total mass enclosed within 90  kpc ( i.e. , the einstein radius , @xmath26 , at @xmath53 ) is @xmath54m@xmath50 .",

    "the cluster hosts many prominent arcs , including a giant arc with @xmath18-band magnitude of 20.0 , at @xmath5 .",
