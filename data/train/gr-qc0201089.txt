    "it is well known that all the attempts to apply standard perturbative quantum field theory techniques to general relativity yield results which are inconsistent .",
    "ultraviolet divergencies can not be cancelled via renormalization .",
    "there are two possible ways to treat this situation .",
    "one of them is to accept that general relativity can not be quantized as it is and should be considered as a low energy limit of another theory which would have better ultraviolet behavior while quantized in the usual way .",
    "another possibility is to admit that the problem is not with general relativity but with the application of standard quantization techniques to it .",
    "one then hopes that if we developed an appropriate quantization procedure which would take into account the main features of general relativity such as diffeomorphism invariance there would be no ultraviolet problem at all .",
    "the later has been proved to be the case in the approach called loop quantum gravity ( for review see @xcite ) , a mathematically well defined explicitly background independent framework for the description of quantum space time .",
    "loop quantum gravity is defined as a representation of the poisson algebra of wilson loop observables @xcite .",
    "this algebra is well suited to a diffeomorphism invariant theory as wilson loop observables can be defined without using a background metric .    the choice of the loop algebra as the basis for the quantization makes the resulting theory drastically different from usual quantum field theory based on the fock representation . by requiring that wilson loops be well defined operators on the hilbert space of the theory we assume that certain states concentrated on lower dimensional ( in the present case one dimensional ) structures such as loops and graphs have finite norm .",
    "in particular this makes such an approach not applicable to background dependent ( non diffeomorphism invariant ) field theory .",
    "the loop states in this case would span a non - separable state space which can not be made sense of in quantum theory .",
    "it is diffeomorphism invariance that reduce non - separable loop space to separable knot space .",
    "a natural question then arises : how to relate the loop space representation and fock representation generally used in low energy physics .",
    "the answer to this question is probably necessary to understand low energy limit of loop quantum gravity which is presumably described by perturbative field theory in background minkowskian space - time .",
    "however the very perturbation theory for quantum gravity is inconsistent and need to be modified we do nt know ahead how . therefore in the case of gravity we do nt have a consistent low energy quantum field theory at hand to relate the loop space quantization with .",
    "it would therefore be useful to consider a model to which both loop space and fock space quantization could be applied .",
    "it is not however straightforward to find such a model .",
    "fock space quantization can be applied to a linear theory or to a theory which has a consistent perturbative expansion around the linear approximation .",
    "loop space quantization can be applied to a diffeomorphism invariant theory .",
    "it is however possible in some cases to construct hilbert space in a background independent way for a background dependent theory .",
    "this possibility initiated some research on relation between loop space and fock space for maxwell theory @xcite . however",
    "the fock space in maxwell theory is background dependent and therefore the relation between it and loop space has to be looked for at the kinematical , non diffeomorphism invariant level . in this case",
    "one needs to relate fock space with non - separable loop space .    in the present paper",
    "we consider a quantization of the free bosonic string .",
    "the string has the property that it is both linear and diffeomorphism invariant .",
    "fock space quantization of the string is well developed .",
    "contrary to background dependent theories the physical hilbert space of the string does not depend on a parameterization of the string world - sheet .",
    "therefore one can try to relate this fock space to an analog of loop space of the string at the diffeomorphism invariant level .",
    "it can be shown that a suitable generalization of loop space quantization can also be applied to the string .",
    "this should provide a good stage on which fock space and loop space quantization can be compared to each other .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 the basics of the kinematics of loop quantum gravity",
    "are reviewed .",
    "the scheme is cast in a generalized form which can be applied to a theory the basic configuration variables of which are not necessary connections . on the other hand",
    "all the details related to gauge symmetry are skipped . in section 3 this scheme",
    "is applied to the string .",
    "the kinematical hilbert space is constructed and the kernel of the diffeomorphism constraint operator is found . in section 4 a regularization of the hamiltonian constraint",
    "is suggested and the its action on kinematical states is defined . in section 5 an analog of spin foam model based on the expansion of the projector operator on the kernel of the given hamiltonian constraint",
    "is constructed .",
    "this model turns out to be very similar to the two - dimensional @xmath0 model . in section 6 an alternative version of the hamiltonian constraint",
    "is proposed .",
    "this version gives rise to a model with @xmath1 interaction .",
    "it is argued that this model has more chances to reproduce the ordinary string theory based on the fock space quantization . in section 7",

    "such point can be thought of as  empty point  ,",

    "the momentum of the original particle is changed at the same time so that the total momentum of three resulting particles be equal to the original momentum of the initial particle fig.[fig2]b .    for neighboring points of non - zero momenta not to affect the action of the hamiltonian constraint at the point @xmath144 @xmath137 and @xmath138 should be chosen so that for any @xmath151 @xmath152.this condition can not be satisfied for fixed @xmath137 and @xmath138 as the constraint can be applied at a point which is arbitrary close to a point with a particles having non - zero momentum .",
    "but if @xmath137 and @xmath138 very with @xmath144 the condition @xmath153 can be satisfied . of course using a position dependent regularization is something unusual but this is the only possible regularization which is consistent with diffeomorphism invariance .",

    "note that after applying the hamiltonian constraint at @xmath32 we will then project the resulting state on @xmath39 .",
    "this makes the precise positions of the tree particles added irrelevant to the final result . only relative order of these three points matters .",

    "it is desirable here that the regularized hamiltonian constraint of the string have the same property , i.e. annihilate the state while acting at a point with no particles .",
    "there is a possibility of achieving this .",
    "one can note that the momenta at the three new points are arbitrary , any choice of them will reproduce the original classical expression after removing the regulator .",
    "one therefore can make use of this arbitrariness and impose an additional constraint on momenta at the three new points .",
    "the following three possible types of such constraints result in annihilating of the empty points by the hamiltonian constraint : @xmath158 @xmath159 @xmath160 this can be seen by imposing any of these constraints on linear combination of the terms depicted at fig.[fig2]a . then by diffeomorphism transformation the first and the second terms in this linear combination can be turned into the third and the fourth and they all cancel each other .",

    "this is the first problem we encounter .",
    "now one can try to solve the constraint equation defined .",
    "first of all one can note that the vacuum ( the state with no particles ) is a solution of both constraints .",
    "the first non - trivial solution is a state with a single particle located at a closed string : @xmath191 it is easy to see that the four terms resulting from the potential term of the hamiltonian constraint and depicted at fig.[fig2]b cancel each other if we connect the free ends of the string together thereby forming a closed string .",
    "the kinetic term in the hamiltonian constraint disappears provided that the momentum @xmath192 entering ( [ tacsol ] ) is null , @xmath193 .",
    "this state should be identified with the well known tachionic mode of the string .",
    "this is because the particle is a scalar and also in string theory the tachionic state is produced by the insertion of vertex operator of the form ( [ tacsol ] ) into string world - sheet .",
    "generally due to the anomaly in string theory the states of the string should be taken to be solutions of a shifted hamiltonian constraint @xmath194 .",
    "the constant would play the role of the squared mass of the mode and being negative would make the mode tachionic .",
    "however the present regularization of the hamiltonian constraint produces an anomaly - free constraint algebra and therefore the scalar string mode have to be massless .",
    "another problem is that the solution ( [ tacsol ] ) exists only for the closed string , this can not be generalized to the case of the open string .",
    "the following non - trivial solutions to all the constraints are expected to be higher modes of the string . because we do nt have the higher modes vertex operators at our disposal they are to be constructed from tachionic vertex operators .",
    "the solution to all the constraints can be sought in a form of an infinite linear combination of terms with various numbers of tachionic vertex operators inserted .",
    "this can be derived via an expansion of the projector on the physical states .",
    "this is what the next section is devoted to .",
    "the construction of projector on the physical hilbert space of the string and its interpretation will closely followed to those introduced in @xcite .",

    "they are comprised by four - valent vertices and lines connected them .",
    "there is however a certain difference between them .",
    "first , no integration over the momenta in closed loops is required .",
    "the momentum flowing around a closed loop is a free parameter which appears in regularization .",
    "@xmath0-model can however be recovered by taking a sum over all the possible regularization parameters .",
    "another feature of @xmath0 which is lacking in the present model is the possibility of @xmath203 move .",
    "the later probably reflects the general difficulty with application of canonical quantization to a generally covariant theory .",
    "space - time covariance get lost in canonical approach and to recover it a resulting theory should be modified e.g. by adding some extra moves @xcite , @xcite . finally , an additional constraint ( [ const1 ] ) or ( [ const2 ] ) or ( [ const3 ] ) on momenta meeting at a vertices needs to be imposed . to recover @xmath0-model",
    "one should make the resulting theory free of this constraints .",
    "one can easily see that the constraints ( [ const2 ] ) and ( [ const3 ] ) are not invariant with respect to renormalization of the tension which in the present case plays the role of coupling constant . by applying block transformation to four valent vertices subject to these constraint one can recover the general vertex of @xmath0-model with the only constraint being the conservation of momentum .",
    "the vertices with constraint ( [ const1 ] ) remain unchanged under renormalization , but this is not an interesting case because such vertices do not convey momenta from one point to another .",
    "therefore , one can conclude that in any case we should end up with the two - dimensional @xmath0-model .",
    "the only freedom remained is the domain of integration over the momenta flowing around closed loops .",
    "the suggested version of the hamiltonian constraint leave us with a theory which is considerably different from ordinary string theory .",
    "there are several indications that string theory in its usual form can probably not be recovered from the model obtained .",
    "firstly , in conformal field theory the expectation value of a product of three vertex operators is not equal to zero . on the other hand",
    "the model we obtained is similar to @xmath0-model which does not contain a transition involving three vertex operators . nor can three valent vertices be recovered via block transformation . besides , the model for representing a discretized string is generally taken to be @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "another difference between them is that as it was mentioned in section [ hc ] the first version of hamiltonian constraint is anomaly - free and the same is true of the diffeomorphism constraint .",
    "alternatively , in ordinary string theory quantum constraint algebra contains an anomaly which is absent only in critical dimension of target space @xmath204 .",
    "there is however another regularization of the hamiltonian constraint which results in a model having much more similarity with ordinary quantization of the string .",
    "by making use of regularization ambiguity one can get a theory which resemble @xmath1-model and contains an anomaly which can be cancelled by tuning the parameters of the theory .",
    "given most general regularization of @xmath205 ( [ h0reg ] ) one can first set @xmath206 , momenta at coinciding points being added to each other .",
    "then one can require that the action of the hamiltonian constraint cancel the momenta at the points where it acts , i.e. @xmath207 .",
    "this is another piece of position dependence in the regularization ( recall that @xmath208 is also position dependent ) .",
    "the resulting hamiltonian constraint can be written as follows , @xmath209 where @xmath210 and @xmath211 \\vert \\ { \\sigma \\ } , \\ { p \\ } \\rangle \\nonumber \\\\ & -&t^2\\sum\\limits_{ij}v_{ij}[u_{\\sigma , -p}u_{\\sigma+\\epsilon , p}-u_{\\sigma , -p}u_{\\sigma-\\epsilon , p } ] \\vert \\ { \\sigma \\ } , \\",

    "it is easy to see that as @xmath213 @xmath214 is the identity operator and @xmath215/\\epsilon$ ] is a diffeomorphism .",
    "the identity operator will introduce a constant term into the hamiltonian constraint , which is similar to the appearance of a central term in the virasoro algebra in string theory in the fock representation from commutator between the creation and annihilation operators .",
    "thus , this version of the hamiltonian constraint contains moves @xmath216 , @xmath217 , @xmath218 , and @xmath219 , fig.[fig4 ] .    ) on a kinematical state .",
    "a ) at an empty point .",
    "b ) at a point with a particle having a nonzero momentum , width=377 ]    moves @xmath220 and @xmath221 correspond to an additive constant @xmath222 in the hamiltonian constraint .",
    "this term results in an anomaly in the constraint algebra as the commutator between the hamiltonian and the diffeomorphism constraints should close on the hamiltonian constraint but the additive constant commutes with constraint and therefore the hamiltonian constraint will not be reproduced .",
    "it is natural to suggest that this is analogous to the well known conformal anomaly in string theory , @xmath223 playing the role of the central charge . in string theory",
    "conformal anomaly can be cancelled by tuning the dimension of space , @xmath204 . in our treatment @xmath223",
    "can be thought of as a vacuum energy of the string and ( when the hamiltonian constraint acts at a point with no particles ) or when the hamiltonian constraint acts at a point where there is a particle it can be interpreted as a squared mass of this particle ( in this case the massless klein - gordon operator @xmath224 acting on this particle is replaced by @xmath225 ) .",
    "a natural question then arises : is there a possibility to cancel this anomaly by tuning parameters of the theory ?",
    "if so , will it constraint the dimension of space to be equal to 26 ?",
    "the answer on this question would require a more detailed consideration .",
    "for the present , one can give an argument that the central charge can be changed by changing the parameters of the theory .",
    "as in ordinary interacting quantum field theory , the transition amplitude between two states can be represented as a sum over feynmann diagrams .",
    "the contributions from some of these diagrams can be taken into account by a redefinition of the constants of the theory .",
    "the same can be done here .",
    "first , the moves @xmath226 give rise to vacuum loops in feynmann diagrams .",
    "all these diagrams contribute to the vacuum energy of the theory which was initially equal to @xmath223 .        therefore if the sum over all vacuum loops is equal to @xmath223 as it is shown on fig.[fig5]a , the vacuum energy of the string is equal to zero .",
    "similarly , diagrams shown on fig.[fig5]b contribute to the mass of the particle and can cancel it under certain conditions .",
    "it is important to note that the condition of setting the vacuum energy to zero is consistent with the condition of setting the masses of the particles to zero .",
    "this is due to the apparent one to one correspondence between the set of diagrams shown on fig.[fig5]a and that shown on fig.[fig5]b .",
    "this consistency allow one in principle to cancel the anomaly by setting the vacuum energy and masses of the particles to zero .",
    "the main issue the proposed model is intended to address is the problem of continuum limit in loop quantum gravity .",
    "ordinary string theory based on fock space quantization have the right continuum limit .",
    "therefore in the present context this problem reduces to that of finding a relation between the resulting model we obtained and the ordinary quantum string .",
    "there is another indication that the right way of looking for continuum limit of this model is through the relation between it and ordinary string theory .",
    "let us recall that the problem of continuum limit in loop quantum gravity consists of two parts .",
    "first part is the problem of the existence of moves which would convey interaction between neighboring vertices of spin network .",
    "this problem has no analog in the present model : both versions of the hamiltonian constraint proposed allow a creation of a particle by one particle in an initial state and its subsequent absorbtion by a neighboring particle .",
    "if the first part of the problem is solved there appears another one : in continuum limit perturbations of a state of the theory should propagate arbitrary far , while in a general discrete model with interaction between nearest neighbors perturbations decay at a certain distance .",
    "the later can be interpreted as that the particles which are responsible for mediating the interaction acquire a mass .",
    "this problem is generally solved by tuning parameters of a model so that the mass of these particles is set to zero .",
    "it is interesting to note in this connection that by requiring that the resulting theory be anomaly - free we set the masses of the particles associated with vertex operators to zero .",
    "however it is still unclear whether these particles can be identified with those responsible for mediating perturbations of a state of the string .",
    "the easiest way to establish the equivalence between this model and ordinary string theory would be to show that the partition function of three vertex operators , which is a well known quantity in string theory , coincides with the amplitude of the move @xmath227 given by the hamiltonian constraint with renormalized parameters .",
    "this is not straightforward to do because to find the renormalized values of parameters one should perform a summation over all the diagrams in the series .",
    "therefore , it will be necessary to find a natural small parameter in which the expansion is made .    in qft models such as @xmath1",
    "the only such parameter is the coupling constant . in our treatment",
    "the role of coupling constant is played by string tension .",
    "the model in the limit @xmath228 corresponds to kinematical picture , the only difference being that the particles should now obey klein - gordon equation @xmath229 .",
    "the hamiltonian constraint of the model can therefore be divided into two parts : a free hamiltonian and an interaction term .",
    "one can then construct  interaction representation  for this model by associating an exact solution of the free hamiltonian to each line in the diagrams and an interaction term to each vertex . in this case",
    "feynmann diagrams can be understood as an expansion in powers of string tension .",
    "therefore this model should work well in the limit of small tension .",
    "it is interesting to consider the role played by t - duality in this model .",
    "the critical radius of compactification below which string modes become redundant is proportional to the inverse tension of the string .",
    "the kinematics of this model corresponds to zero tension and therefore the critical radius of compactification is equal to infinity .",
    "this means that we are always below the critical radius and there is a certain redundancy in the description of kinematical state .",
    "this redundancy manifest itself in the fact that e.g. a state with two particles having momenta @xmath230 and @xmath231 is kinematically equivalent with a state with one particle having a momentum @xmath232 .",
    "therefore all the kinematical states of the string can be made of  elementary  particles having the smallest possible momentum .",
    "this picture has a close similarity with string bit models @xcite .",
    "how to extend this picture on dynamics is still unclear .",
    "string bit models describe string theory in light cone frame @xmath233 . in this connection it is interesting to note that in light cone frame the considerations of this paper would undergo a considerable simplification .",
    "recall that there was a problem with making the hamiltonian constraint `` combinatorial '' , i.e. acting only on a finite set of points .",
    "in light cone frame this is satisfied automatically and therefore neither an additional constraint on the regularization parameters ( like in section [ hc ] ) nor renormalization of the vacuum energy ( like in section [ hc2 ] ) is required .",
    "this is because in this frame the longitudinal momentum is always positive @xmath234 .",
    "this property together with conservation of momenta @xmath235 results in setting all the longitudinal momenta created by an action of hamiltonian constraint to zero @xmath236 . in quantum field theory in light cone frame the point @xmath237 is called `` zero mode '' .",
    "it is a singular point of the theory and a regularization is required here .",
    "one generally introduces a regularization condition @xmath238 and therefore zero mode can be neglected . in the present case",
    "there is a singularity in the hamiltonian constraint for small added momentum @xmath35 .",
    "it can be seen from the equation ( [ gexp ] ) that as @xmath239 , @xmath240 .",
    "therefore the infrared cutoff will be necessary in this theory anyway and this in particular should rule the zero mode out .",
