    "string breaking , the flattening of the static potential , has been observed by computing on the lattice the static ( fundamental ) potential in the three- and four - dimensional su(2 ) higgs model and the static adjoint potential in the three - dimensional su(2 ) yang - mills theory . in qcd",
    ", recent attempts with two flavors of dynamical quarks failed to observe string breaking @xcite .",
    "the problems in the extraction of the static potential in qcd arise from the poor overlap of the `` string states '' , described by wilson loops , with the ground state at large separations of the static quarks .",
    "the latter is better described in terms of two static - light mesons , which are bound states of a static quark and the light dynamical quark field . to overcome this problem one has to extract the static potential from a matrix correlation function in which `` string '' and",
    "`` two - meson states '' enter .",
    "this basic point was already noted in @xcite .",
    "we compute the potential between static charges in the fundamental representation of the gauge group ( static quarks ) in the four - dimensional su(2 ) higgs model in the confinement `` phase '' , where it resembles qcd .",
    "we improve our first study @xcite with a better lattice resolution and also determine the first excited state static potential .",
    "furthermore , we address the question of finding lines of constant physics in order to study the scaling behavior . for a detailed exposition of our results , we refer to @xcite .",
    "we construct a matrix correlation function @xmath0 @xcite using a basis of states @xmath1 that contains string - type states , described by ( smeared ) wilson lines , and meson - type states , described by ( smeared ) higgs fields .",
    "the static potentials @xmath2 are extracted from @xmath0 using the variational method proposed in @xcite . because of divergent ( like @xmath3 ) self - energy contributions of the static charges , the static potentials @xmath4 need to be renormalised .",
    "this can be done by considering [ renpot ] [ v_(r)-2 ] .",
    "the energy @xmath5 is the mass of a static - light meson , bound state of a static charge and the dynamical higgs field .",
    "the multiplication with the reference scale @xmath6 @xcite makes the physical quantity dimensionless . in ( circles ) , we show the ground state and first excited state static potentials ( [ renpot ] ) as functions of the distance @xmath7 for the bare parameter set @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 ( we adopt the conventional notation of @xcite ) .",
    "the ground state potential shows an approximate linear rise at small distances : around distance [ rb ] & & 1.9the potential flattens .",
    "the string breaks .",
    "as expected , for large distances the potential approaches the asymptotic value @xmath11 .",
    "the first excited potential comes very close to the ground state potential around @xmath12 and rises linearly at larger distances .",
    "we would like to get an insight into the interplay between string - type and meson - type states .",
    "we consider the diagonal sub - blocks of the matrix correlation function corresponding to string - type and to meson - type states separately and determine approximate ground state wave functions @xmath13 for the string - type states and @xmath14 for the meson - type states .",
    "we then construct a projected matrix correlation function [ projcorrwm ] _",
    "kl(t ) & = & v_0,i^kc_ij(t)v_0,j^l ( k , l= , ) + & = & _ _ l()_k ( ) ^-tv_(r ) , where @xmath15 labels the true eigenstates of the hamiltonian and the real coefficients @xmath16 are the overlaps of the string - type ( @xmath17 ) and meson - type ( @xmath18 ) states with the eigenstates of the hamiltonian . the overlaps with the ground state are shown in and with the first excited eigenstate in ( we choose the sign conventions @xmath19 and @xmath20 ) . in the string breaking region around @xmath21 ,",
    "the overlaps of the string - type and meson - type states have similar magnitude , both in and .",
    "the scenario of string breaking as a level crossing phenomenon @xcite is confirmed .",
    "we would like to point out that the overlaps represented in and are not quantities which have a continuum limit .",
    "in order to investigate the presence of lattice artifacts in dimensionless physical quantities such as ( [ renpot ] ) , we must vary the lattice spacing @xmath22 ( by changing @xmath23 ) and tune the bare parameters @xmath24 and @xmath25 to keep two dimensionless physical quantities @xmath26 and @xmath27 constant .",
    "this procedure corresponds to the renormalisation of @xmath24 and @xmath25 and defines in the parameter space a so called line of constant physics .",
    "a sensible choice would be to find @xmath26 strongly dependent on @xmath24 and @xmath27 strongly dependent on @xmath25 .",
    "we consider the quantity @xmath28 $ ] : it mainly depends on the value of the mass of the dynamical higgs field which is in turn determined by the choice of @xmath24 . at @xmath8 we find [ matching1 ] f_1 = [ 2-v_0 ( ) ] = f_1^*1.26 . for different values of @xmath25",
    ", we match the parameter @xmath24 at @xmath29 using the condition .",
    "the results are shown in . as a by - product of these simulations",
    "we obtain that [ aratio ] a(=2.2 ) a(=2.4 ) & & 1.9 .",
    "we studied several candidates @xcite for a quantity @xmath27 which is sensitive to a variation of the parameter @xmath25 once the parameter @xmath24 is matched using the condition .",
    "we can not draw a definitive conclusion yet .",
    "our results support earlier observations @xcite that the physics in the confinement `` phase '' of the su(2 ) higgs model is weakly dependent on the parameter @xmath25 .",
    "we use this as an assumption and study the scaling behavior of the static potentials between @xmath29 and @xmath8 by using only the matching condition for @xmath26 .    in",
    ", we compare the results for the ground state and first excited state static potentials .",
    "they show compatibility with scaling within minute errors ! we have also computed the static potentials at @xmath29 for other values of @xmath25 in the range @xmath30 .",
    "no dependence on @xmath25 is seen .",
    "these results are a strong indication for a continuum - like behavior of the static potentials already at the small @xmath23 values that we use .",
    "we clearly observe string breaking as level crossing phenomenon in the confinement `` phase '' of the su(2 ) higgs model .",
    "the static potentials show a remarkable scaling behavior under variation of the lattice spacing by almost a factor two .",
    "the search for a method of defining lines of constant physics in the confinement `` phase '' of the su(2 ) higgs model has only partially been solved ( ) . finding a renormalised observable sensitive to @xmath25 is still an open and interesting question ."
