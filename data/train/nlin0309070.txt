    "pattern - forming instabilities lead to an astonishing variety of spatial and spatio - temporal structures , ranging from simple , periodic stripes ( rolls ) to spatially localized structures and spatio - temporally chaotic patterns . even within the restricted class of steady , spatially ordered patterns a wide range of patterns _ have _ been identified and investigated beyond simple square or hexagonal planforms including patterns exhibiting multiple length scales : superlattice patterns , in which the length scales involved are rationally related rendering the pattern periodic albeit on an unexpectedly large length scale , and quasipatterns , which are characterized by incommensurate length scales and which are therefore not periodic in space .",
    "these more complex two - dimensional patterns have been observed in particular in the form of faraday waves on a fluid layer that is vertically shaken with a two - frequency periodic acceleration function @xcite , and to some extent also in vertically vibrated rayleigh - bnard convection @xcite and in nonlinear optical systems @xcite .",
    "the faraday system is especially suitable for experimental investigation of pattern formation in systems with two competing spatial modes of instability since such codimension - two points are easily accessible by simply adjusting the frequency content of the periodic forcing function  @xcite .",
    "the observation of both superlattices and quasipatterns in this physical system raises an intriguing question concerning the selection of these kinds of patterns : what determines whether , for given physical parameters , a periodic or a quasi - periodic pattern is obtained ?",
    "this provides the main motivation for the present paper in which we address certain aspects of the selection problem within the somewhat simple framework of mode competition in one spatial dimension .    to capture the competition between commensurate / incommensurate length scales we focus on the interaction between two modes with a wavelength ratio that is close to , but not necessarily equal to , the ratio of two small integers",
    "we are thus led to consider a _ near - resonant _ mode interaction .",
    "we focus on the case in which both modes arise in a steady bifurcation .",
    "while at first sight it may seem that an analysis of steady - state modes would not be applicable to two - frequency forced faraday waves , for which most of the patterns of interest in the present context have been observed , it should be noted that very close to onset the amplitude equations for these waves can be reduced to the standing - wave subspace , in which the waves satisfy equations that have the same form as those for modes arising from a steady bifurcation ( see , for example ,  @xcite ) .",
    "the competition between commensurate and incommensurate steady structures has been addressed previously in the context of a spatially - periodic forcing of patterns @xcite . using a one - dimensional , _ external _ forcing of two - dimensional patterns in electroconvection of nematic liquid crystals , localized domain walls in the local phase of the patterns",
    "were observed if the forcing wavenumber was sufficiently incommensurate with the preferred wavenumber of the pattern @xcite .",
    "theoretically , the domain walls were described using a one - dimensional ginzburg - landau equation that included a near - resonant forcing term , which reflects the small mismatch between the forcing wavenumber and the wavenumber of the spontaneously forming pattern @xcite .",
    "the situation we have in mind in the present paper is similar to these studies in so far as the competing modes we investigate also provide a periodic forcing for each other .",
    "the case of external forcing is recovered if one of the two modes is much stronger than the other and consequently the feedback from the forced mode on the forcing mode can be ignored .",
    "we do not restrict ourselves to this case , however , and thus both modes are active degrees of freedom and the interaction between them is mutual .    the analysis of the interaction of two exactly resonating modes near a co - dimension - two point at which both modes bifurcate off the basic , unpatterned state has revealed a wide variety of patterns and dynamical phenomena .",
    "rich behavior has been found in small systems in which the interacting modes are determined by the symmetry and shape of the physical domain ( e.g. @xcite ) . more relevant for our goal",
    "are the studies of mode - interaction in the presence of translation symmetry , since they allow the extension to systems with large aspect ratio , which are required to address the difference between commensurate and incommensurate structures .",
    "therefore our investigation builds on a comprehensive analysis , performed by dangelmayr @xcite , of the interaction between two resonant spatial modes in @xmath0-symmetric systems with wavenumbers in the ratio @xmath1 , @xmath2 ( here the @xmath0-symmetry is a consequence of restricting to spatially periodic patterns in a translation - invariant system . ) . for @xmath3",
    "there are two primary bifurcations off the trivial state to pure modes followed by secondary bifurcations to mixed modes .",
    "these mixed modes can in turn undergo a hopf bifurcation to generate standing wave solutions and a parity - breaking bifurcation that produces traveling waves . for @xmath4 similar results",
    "are found except that there is only one pure - mode state , the one with the higher wavenumber ; the other primary bifurcation leads directly to a branch of mixed modes .",
    "further analyses of this system have revealed structurally and asymptotically stable heteroclinic cycles near the mode interaction point when @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "more recently , complex dynamics organized around a sequence of transitions between distinct heteroclinic cycles has been discovered in resonances of the form @xmath6 @xcite , in particular , in the cases @xmath7 and @xmath8 .    although previous work on resonant mode interactions considered only strictly periodic solutions it provided insight into various phenomena that were observed experimentally in large - aspect ratio systems involving large - scale modulations of the patterns .",
    "for example , in steady taylor vortex flow it was found experimentally that not too far from threshold the band of experimentally accessible wavenumbers is substantially reduced compared to the stability limit obtained by the standard analysis of side - band instabilities in the weakly nonlinear regime @xcite .",
    "the origin of this strong deviation was identified to be a saddle - node bifurcation associated with the @xmath9 mode interaction @xcite . in directional solidification @xcite localized drift waves",
    "have been observed , which arise from the parity - breaking bifurcation @xcite that is associated with the resonant mode interaction with wavenumber ratio @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "subsequently such waves have also been obtained in a variety of other systems including directional viscous fingering @xcite , taylor vortex flow @xcite , and premixed flames @xcite . in our treatment",
    "of the near - resonant case the mode amplitudes are allowed to vary slowly in space .",
    "it therefore naturally incorporates phenomena like the localized drift waves and the modification of side - band instabilities by the resonance .    in this paper",
    "we study the interaction of two nearly - resonant modes in a spatially extended , driven , dissipative system . near onset",
    "we model the slow dynamics of such systems by two amplitude equations of ginzburg - landau type , one for each mode .",
    "we focus on the weak resonances ( @xmath10 ) in order to avoid some of the specific features of the strong - resonance cases ( for example , the structurally stable heteroclinic cycles in the case @xmath11 ) .",
    "our primary goal is to investigate the transitions between periodic and quasi - periodic states that take place as the result of side - band instabilities , with an eye on how the detuning from exact spatial resonance influences this process .",
    "we find that the detuning can play an important role in the selection of the final wavenumbers of the modes involved .",
    "for example , it can favor a periodic to quasi - periodic transition that would otherwise ( i.e. , in the case of exact resonance ) result in a second periodic state . among the various quasi - periodic states that we find in numerical simulations",
    "are several that consist of drifting localized structures with alternating locked ( periodic ) and unlocked ( quasi - periodic ) domains .",
    "it should be noted that at present there is no rigorous justification for the description of quasi - periodic patterns using low - order amplitude expansions .",
    "in fact , the lack of straightforward convergence of such an expansion has been investigated recently for two - dimensional quasi - patterns @xcite .",
    "we will not discuss these issues ; instead we use the coupled ginzburg - landau equations as model equations that are known to be the appropriate equations for periodic patterns and at the same time also allow quasi - periodic solutions .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows .",
    "in section 2 we set up the coupled ginzburg - landau equations that are based on the truncated normal form equations for the @xmath1-resonance . in section 3",
    "we utilize and build upon on the detailed results of dangelmayr @xcite to describe the stability properties of steady spatially periodic states ( i.e , pure and mixed modes ) with respect to perturbations that preserve the periodicity of the pattern . in section 4",
    "we turn to the question of stability of the steady periodic solutions with respect to side - band instabilities . here",
    "we also determine how these instabilities are affected by the detuning from perfect resonance .",
    "numerical simulations of the system are carried out in section 5 to investigate the nonlinear evolution of the system subsequent to the side - band instability discussed in the previous section .",
    "our concluding remarks are given in section 6 .",
    "it should be pointed out that a very recent preprint by dawes _",
    "presents a complementary investigation near the @xmath9 resonance @xcite .",
    "[ sec : amplitudequations ]    we consider driven , dissipative systems in one spatial dimension that are invariant under spatial translations and reflections .",
    "we further assume that in the system of interest there are two distinct spatial modes that destabilize the basic homogeneous state nearly simultaneously .",
    "the wavenumbers of these two modes , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , correspond to minima of the neutral curves and are assumed to be in approximate spatial resonance , i.e. , @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are positive co - prime integers and the term @xmath17 measures the deviation from perfect resonance .",
    "physical fields , near onset , may then be expanded in terms of these two spatial modes : @xmath18+\\cdots { \\label{1a } }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the two modes are allowed to vary on slow spatial and temporal scales @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively . note that in the expansion  ( [ 1a ] ) we do not expand about about the minima @xmath21 of the neutral stability curves , which for @xmath22 are not in spatial resonance , but take instead a mode @xmath23 which _ is _ in exact spatial resonance with @xmath24 .",
    "this choice of @xmath23 and @xmath24 simplifies the equations , avoiding any explicit dependence on the spatial variable in the resulting amplitude equations .",
    "furthermore , we allow for a small offset between the critical values of the forcing amplitudes @xmath25 of the two modes ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : critic - modes ] ) .",
    "[ fig : critic - modes ]    the equations governing the evolution of @xmath23 and @xmath24 must be equivariant under the symmetry operations generated by spatial translations ( @xmath26 ) and spatial reflections ( @xmath27 ) , which act on @xmath28 as follows : @xmath29 where the bar denotes the complex conjugate .",
    "consistent with this equivariance requirement the slow evolution of @xmath23 and @xmath24 can be approximated , after rescaling , by the ginzburg - landau equations    @xmath30    the subscripts indicate partial derivatives with respect to @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "the main control parameter @xmath33 measures the magnitude of the overall forcing .",
    "in addition , we keep track of the offset in the two critical forcing amplitudes with @xmath34 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : critic - modes ] ) , and capture the detuning between @xmath12 and @xmath35 with @xmath36 .",
    "the local curvature of the neutral stability curves near @xmath12 and @xmath13 is measured by @xmath37 and @xmath38 , respectively .",
    "we further assume that the nonlinear self- and cross- interaction coefficients satisfy the non - degeneracy conditions @xmath39 and @xmath40 and perform a simple rescaling such that @xmath41 , @xmath42 .",
    "one goal of this paper is to gain insight into the difference between periodic and quasi - periodic patterns in systems with two unstable wavenumbers .",
    "if the two wavenumbers are not rationally related and their irrational ratio is kept fixed as the onset for the two modes is approached , then only terms of the form @xmath43 , @xmath44 , appear in the equation for @xmath45 . for a rational ratio , however , additional nonlinear terms arise , which couple the otherwise uncoupled phases of the two modes @xmath45 . for the @xmath1-resonance",
    "the leading - order resonance terms are given by @xmath46 and @xmath47 in the equations for @xmath23 and @xmath24 , respectively . in order to explore the connection between the rational and the irrational case we consider a wavenumber ratio which may be irrational , but its deviation from the ratio @xmath1 is of @xmath48 .",
    "this allows the mismatch between the two wavenumbers to be captured by the slow spatial variable @xmath31 and to describe periodic and quasi - periodic patterns with the same set of equations ( [ 2],[3 ] ) .",
    "equivalently , we could have expanded in the irrationally related wavenumbers @xmath12 and @xmath13 associated with the minima of the neutral curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : critic - modes ] . then the resonance terms would introduce space - periodic coefficients with a period that is related to the mismatch of the wavenumbers . our choice of the expansion wavenumbers ( cf .",
    "( [ 1b ] ) ) removes this space - dependence and introduces the first - order derivative @xmath49 in its place .",
    "we focus on the weak resonances , @xmath50 , in which the resonant terms are of higher order .",
    "we neglect , however , non - resonant terms of the form @xmath51 ( @xmath52 and @xmath53 ) which may arise at lower order .",
    "this is motivated by the observation that such terms do not contribute any qualitatively new effects for small amplitudes .",
    "the resonant terms , in contrast , remove the unphysical degeneracy that arises when the phases are left uncoupled and can therefore influence dynamics in a significant way despite appearing at higher order .",
    "note , however , that near onset the resonant terms are typically small and the phase coupling between @xmath23 and @xmath24 occurs on a very slow time scale .",
    "the coupling becomes stronger further above onset where the weakly nonlinear analysis may no longer be valid .",
    "it is often useful to recast eqs .",

    "dangelmayr s bifurcation analysis produced expressions for the location of primary bifurcations to pure mode solutions , secondary bifurcations to mixed mode solutions , and , in some instances , tertiary bifurcations to standing - wave and traveling - wave solutions .",

    "the solutions persist over a large interval of the forcing giving rise to bi - stability between periodic and quasi - periodic states .",

    "in this paper we have investigated a near - resonant steady @xmath1 mode interaction in one - dimensional dissipative systems with reflection and translation symmetry using coupled ginzburg - landau equations that describe the slow evolution of the two relevant mode envelopes .",
    "one of the goals was to shed some light on the competition between periodic and quasi - periodic patterns by addressing in detail the stability of the periodic solutions , emphasizing particular instabilities that can lead to quasi - periodic patterns .",
    "the simplest stationary solutions of this system are reflection - symmetric periodic patterns : the pure modes @xmath68 and the mixed modes @xmath77 . building on the results of dangelmayr",
    "@xcite we established the stability properties of these solutions with respect to perturbations that preserve the periodicity of the solution . among the many possible choices of parameters we restricted our attention to sets of values that produced two supercritical primary bifurcations to pure modes followed by secondary bifurcations to mixed modes - these mixed modes , in turn , suffered symmetry - breaking bifurcations to traveling waves",
    "side - band instabilities modify the stability regions of the pure and mixed modes .",
    "in particular , we find that these steady periodic patterns can undergo longwave as well as shortwave instabilities . for the pure modes the side - band instabilities are always of steady - state type .",
    "the destabilizing longwave perturbations correspond to the well - known eckhaus instability and depend only on the linear coefficients of eqs .",
    "( [ 2],[3 ] ) .",

    "in particular , we find :    \\1 .",
    "if @xmath120 and a pure mode , @xmath72 say , loses stability in a shortwave steady - state bifurcation , the wavenumber of the growing perturbation lies at the band center of the other mode ( i.e. of @xmath73 ) ) ; this instability is affected by the detuning parameter @xmath336 , which measures the mismatch between the two critical wavenumbers .",
    "\\2 . for wavenumber ratios of the form @xmath139",
    "one of the resonant terms enters into the stability calculation for the pure mode @xmath72 .",
    "away from the band center this pure mode can experience shortwave instabilities while close to the band center it can lose stability only to homogeneous or longwave perturbations . in the short - wave case , due to the resonant terms the wavenumber selected by the instability is shifted with respect to the band center of the other pure mode , @xmath73 .",
    "as the band center is approached the perturbation wavenumber of the short - wave instability can go to 0 .",
    "close to their bifurcation from the pure modes , the mixed modes inherit the stability properties of the pure modes with respect to short - wave perturbations .",
    "in addition , they may undergo an oscillatory instability .",
    "it results from the interaction of the translation and the symmetry - breaking modes and can be strongly affected by the wavenumber mismatch .",
    "the nonlinear evolution ensuing from the instabilities was investigated through direct numerical simulation of eqs .",
    "( [ 2],[3 ] ) with periodic boundary conditions for the slowly varying envelopes .",
    "it was found that the transition from the pure modes to the mixed mode can depend strongly on the wavenumber mismatch .",
    "we have identified cases in which without a wavenumber mismatch the instability of the pure mode leads to a periodic mixed mode , while in the non - resonant case the instability of the pure mode is determined by a side - band instability resulting in a quasi - periodic pattern .",
    "side - band instabilities of the mixed modes generically destroy the spatial periodicity of the stationary , reflection - symmetric states and produce quasi - periodic patterns .",
    "they are typically characterized by a spatial modulation of the local wavenumber with a wavelength that is determined by the detuning parameter ( in a manner predicted by the linear analysis ) and the resonant terms ( as indicated in eq.([19 ] ) ) .",
    "the size of the modulation depends strongly on the strength of the resonance terms . for the weakly nonlinear 2:5 resonance discussed here",
    "the effect is only noticeable for @xmath124 ( cf .",
    "fig.[fig : spacetime3 ] ) ; for @xmath123 the resonant terms are too small ( cf .",
    "fig.[fig : spacetime2 ] ) .",
    "the oscillatory instability tends to lead to the formation of propagating fronts separating reflection symmetric patterns from drift waves with broken reflection symmetry .",
    "the fronts may interact to form stable localized drift waves .",
    "these may subsequently collide with each other , destroying the initial periodic pattern completely in some cases and only partially in others .",
    "in the latter case the system relaxes to a very interesting pattern composed of alternating localized stationary domains of periodic and quasi - periodic states .",
    "we find other cases where all the fronts travel in the same direction , eventually achieving the same velocity and producing stable localized propagating domains of drift waves .",
    "the wavenumbers in these traveling domains are selected by the resonance condition ( i.e. , they are in the ratio @xmath283 ) , whereas the wavenumbers associated with the surrounding steady periodic pattern are no longer resonant .",
    "thus , the resulting patterns can be described as localized periodic traveling wave structures propagating through a stationary quasi - periodic background .    in this paper",
    "we have focused on the periodic solutions and their stability .",
    "complementary to this analysis would be a study of the quasi - periodic solutions .",
    "of course , the set of solutions in which the two modes have non - resonant wavenumbers is considerably larger than that of the periodic solutions and such an analysis is beyond the scope of the present work . in preliminary numerical simulations",
    "we have considered the stability of certain quasi - periodic solutions and found that the range in the wavenumber mismatch over which they are stable is smaller than that of periodic solutions with nearby wavenumbers @xcite .",
    "thus , at least in the regime considered , the resonant terms enhance the stability of the periodic solutions . another promising line of investigation would be the reduction of the coupled ginzburg - landau equations ( [ 2],[3 ] ) to two coupled phase equations .",
    "this should be possible for long - wave perturbations of the mixed - mode solution if the smallness of the resonant terms is exploited and it is assumed that such terms are of the same order as the gradients in the magnitude of the amplitudes ( cf .",
    "( [ 6a],[7a ] ) ) .",
    "we gratefully acknowledge discussions with j. porter and p. umbanhowar .",

    "note that for @xmath343 the perturbation amplitudes @xmath344 and @xmath345 decouple and the destabilizing mode is composed of just one wave of the form @xmath346 or @xmath347 .",
    "in contrast , due to the resonant term when @xmath116 , the eigevectors have ( in principle ) components in both directions and the destabilizing mode is composed of two waves with different wavenumbers .    for the pure mode @xmath73 we have @xmath348 where @xmath338 and @xmath339 satisfy @xmath349 the stability of @xmath73",
