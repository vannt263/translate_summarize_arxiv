    "in the last decade , higher - dimensional black holes have been studied in a broad range of research , highly motivated by superstring theories  ( see , for example ,  @xcite ) .",
    "one of the most important black hole solutions in higher - dimensions is the myers - perry black hole solutions  @xcite , which are generalization of the four - dimensional kerr solutions to higher dimensions .",
    "there also exist the black hole solutions that have ring horizon topology in five dimensions , called the black ring solutions  @xcite .",
    "many efforts are devoted to understanding physics of these black hole solutions .",
    "one of the most important step to comprehend black holes is analysis of geodesics .",
    "geodesics have been extensively studied in various black holes  @xcite , which provide new insights into not only background geometries but physical phenomena related to test particles in such backgrounds .",
    "for example , the geodesic system in the kerr geometry was studied by carter  @xcite , and the hamilton - jacobi equation of its system was shown to occur the separation of variables by finding the non - trivial constant called carter s constant .",
    "the discovery of carter s constant led to the understanding of non - trivial hidden symmetries in the kerr geometry such as killing tensors  @xcite .    in the case",
    "that the geodesic equation occurs the separation of variables in a black hole spacetime , it is possible to study various particle orbits around the black hole analytically . among several special orbits in the kerr black hole , stable bound orbits of massive particles",
    "are one of the most important characteristics  @xcite .",
    "the stable bound orbits mean that a particle ranges over a finite interval of radius , neither being captured by the black hole nor escaping to infinity .",
    "basically , such orbits as earth goes around the sun are formed by a balance between newtonian gravitational monopole force and centrifugal force in four dimensions .",
    "stable bound orbits play important role in the astrophysical context .",
    "for example , in a black hole and disk system , the innermost stable circular orbit are thought to be the inner edge of the accretion disk .    in @xmath0-dimensional black holes in the case @xmath1",
    ", there exist no stable bound orbit balanced by newtonian gravitational monopole force and centrifugal force .",
    "more precisely , newtonian gravitational monopole potential term and centrifugal potential term in radial motion can not form a potential well because the centrifugal potential proportional to @xmath2 in any dimensions is dominant in the region far from a black hole than the newtonian gravitational monopole potential proportional to @xmath3 in general . in five - dimensional black rings , however , there exist potential wells , which are formed in different mechanism  @xcite by contrast to the case in four dimensions , and then a particle can be bounded in such a potential well stably .",
    "this physics is led by having ring horizon topology completely different from round sphere .    in higher - dimensional myers - perry black holes",
    ", horizon shape is deformed by the effect of black hole spin angular momenta .",
    "although a horizon takes the shape of almost round sphere for small values of spin parameters , in general , its shape becomes non - trivial for large values of spin parameters .",
    "one of the most interesting limit for myers - perry black holes is the ultra - spinning limit in more than six dimensions  @xcite .",
    "since the horizon is flattened in this limit , gravitational field that particles feel changes drastically , and the existence of stable bound orbits is expected to be non - trivial as in the case of five - dimensional black rings .    in @xmath0-dimensional singly rotating myers - perry black holes ,",
    "unstable circular particle orbits was studied in  @xcite .",
    "althought particle motion has been extensively studied in five - dimensional myers - perry black holes  @xcite , no stable bound orbit has found yet . the purpose of this paper is to show that there exist stable bound orbits of particles even in higher - dimensional myers - perry black holes .",
    "note that the mechanism of taking stable bound orbits is physically non - trivial as mentioned above . in this paper , the existence of stable bound orbits",
    "is demonstrated in six dimensional singly spinning myers - perry black holes .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the following section",
    ", the geometry of the singly rotating myers - perry solution in six dimensions is reviewed . in sec .",
    "[ sec:3 ] , particle motion orbiting around a six - dimensional singly spinning myers - perry black hole is analyzed , and the existence of stable bound orbits is demonstrated by the analysis of an effective potential . in sec .",

    "in this section , the geometry of singly rotating myers - perry black holes in six dimensions is briefly reviewed .",
    "its metric in the boyer - lindquist coordinates is given by @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 are the mass and two spin parameters of the family .",
    "the event horizon is located at the largest real @xmath9-coordinate value that @xmath10 . in the case",
    "@xmath11 , reduces to the schwarzschild - tangherlini geometry .",
    "figure  [ fig : a - b ] shows the allowed region of spin parameters that @xmath10 has the real positive roots .",

    ", width=245 ]    note that , in the case of a single rotation , i.e. , @xmath13 or @xmath14 , the allowed region is not bounded along the axes in the figure . indeed , as will be discussed below , the spin parameter in the singly rotating case may take arbitrarily large value , which is called the ultra - spinning regime .    in order to focus on singly spinning myers - perry black holes ,",
    "one of the spin parameters is eliminated , @xmath14 , in what follows . in terms of the following angular coordinates satisfying  , @xmath15 the metric of the singly rotating myers - perry geometry in six dimensions",
    "is given by @xmath16 where @xmath17 note that and reduce to @xmath18 hence , for arbitrary value of @xmath7 , there exists at least one real positive root to @xmath10 .",
    "as discussed in  @xcite , the boundlessness of the spin parameter allows us to take the limit of large @xmath7 compared to @xmath6 , which is called ultra - spinning limit .",
    "then near the axis , @xmath19 , goes to @xmath20 where @xmath21 kept finite , and the new coordinates @xmath22 is introduced by @xmath23 note that @xmath22 also is kept finite to obtain the regular metric .",
    "hence , the six - dimensional ultra - spinning myers - perry black hole geometry near the rotational axis can be regarded as a direct product space of a four - dimensional schwarzschild black hole and a two - dimensional flat space , i.e. , a schwarzschild black brane .",
    "in this section , massive particle motion around a six - dimensional singly spinning myers - perry black hole is analyzed .",
    "our attention is focused on stable bound orbits , which mean that a particle ranges over a finite interval of radius outside the horizon , neither being captured by the black hole nor escaping to infinity . in the method of analyzing an effective potential , the existence of stable bound orbits is demonstrated by showing explicit shape of effective potentials including a local minimum point .",
    "furthermore , the region that stable bound orbits can exist in is also found by the analysis of the extremal potential problem .    to reduce the problem of finding stable bound orbits of a particle to the extremal problem of an effective potential in six - dimensional singly rotating myers - perry black holes ,",

    "note that @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 are constants of motion because @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 are the cyclic coordinates due to the spacetime symmetries . since the relativistic particle system has the reparameterization invariance ,",

    "the allowed range of @xmath39 must be @xmath44 outside the horizon because the kinetic term , the first term in , is non - negative .",
    "the region that satisfies this inequality shows the allowed region for particle motion .",
