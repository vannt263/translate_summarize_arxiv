    "of the gauge field theories , the self - dual theories deserve special attention .",
    "self - duality refers to theories in which the interactions have particular forms and special strengths such that the equations of motion reduce from second- to first - order differential equations ; these configurations minimize a functional , often the energy @xcite .",
    "for example the abelian - higgs model admits topological solitons of the vortex type @xcite . in this model",
    "the scalar potential is of the form @xmath1 and the vortices satisfy a set of bogomolnyi or self - dual equations when the vector and scalar masses are chosen to be equal @xcite .",
    "the self- dual point corresponds to the boundary between type - i and type - ii superconductors . in this point",
    "the vortices become non - interacting and static multisoliton solutions may be expected @xcite .",
    "we also notice that the self - dual structure of the gauge theories is related at a fundamental level to the existence of an extended supersymmetry @xcite .",
    "recently considerable interest has been paid to the study of vortex solutions in @xmath2 dimensional chern - simons ( cs ) gauge theories .",
    "one common feature of the chern - simons solitons is that they carry electric charge as well as magnetic flux @xcite , in contrast with the electrically neutral nielsen - olesen vortices .",
    "in addition they possess fractional spin ; a property that is fundamental to consider them as candidates for anyon like objects in quasiplanar systems .",
    "self - dual chern - simons theories are known to exist if one considers pure cs theories . in these theories",
    "the maxwell term in the lagrangian is absent and the dynamics for the gauge field is solely provided by the chern - simons term @xcite .",
    "the self - dual chern - simons theories enable a realization with either relativistic @xcite or nonrelativistic @xcite dynamics for the matter degrees of freedom . in the case of the relativistic theory self - dual topological and nontopological vortex solutions",
    "have been found with a particular sixth - order potential of the form @xmath3 when the vector and scalar masses are equal @xcite .",
    "the question can be posed as to whether there are self - dual models in which the gauge field lagrangian includes both the maxwell and the chern - simons term . a self - dual maxwell - chern - simons gauge theory can be constructed if a magnetic moment interaction is added between the scalar and the gauge fields @xcite . if the interest is pursuit in a low energy effective theory containing at most second - order derivative terms , such a magnetic moment interaction has to be included .",
    "two steps are followed to obtain the self - dual limit .",
    "first a particular relation between the cs mass and the anomalous magnetic coupling is stablished whereby the equations for the gauge fields reduce from second- to first - order differential equations similar to those of the pure cs theory .",
    "second , if the scalar potential is selected as a simple @xmath4 potential and the scalar mass is made equal to the topological mass , the energy obeys a bogomolnyi - type lower bound , which is saturated by fields satisfying self - duality equations .",
    "the potential possesses a unique minimum at @xmath5 and topological solitons certainly do not exist , yet the theory allows nontopological vortex configurations . in this paper",
    "we examine the theory and the properties of these nontopological vortices in more detail .",
    "in addition we find that the model admits one - dimensional soliton solutions of the domain wall type .",
    "the domain wall carries both magnetic flux and electric charge per unit length .",
    "furthermore we find that the domain wall configurations provide an approximate solution to the self - dual vortices in the large flux limit .",
    "it must be emphasized that the existence of domain wall solutions is unexpected , because the scalar potential has a unique nondegenerate minimum .    as mentioned above",
    "there are several aspects of the @xmath4 maxwell - chern - simons gauge theory which justify further consideration . in section [ model ]",
    "we introduce the model in which a charged scalar field is coupled via a generalized covariant derivative to the gauge field whose dynamics includes both the maxwell and the chern - simons term .",
    "initially we consider an arbitrary renormalizable scalar potential in @xmath6 dimensions in order to discuss properties of the theory both in the symmetric and in the spontaneously broken phase .",
    "as first pointed out in reference @xcite , the nonminimal term in the covariant derivative combined with the spontaneous symmetry mechanism induce a kind of chern - simons term .",
    "however we demonstrate that the induced cs term behaves in the same way as the explicit cs term only in the topological trivial sector of the theory .",
    "the properties of the two terms are different in the topological non - trivial sector , in particular the induced cs term does not contribute to the fundamental relation between charge and magnetic flux .",
    "rather , the magnetic moment induces a contribution to the magnetization of the vortex that is proportional to the charge of the configuration . in section [ smass ]",
    "we study the propagating modes for the vector field , which consist of two longielliptic waves with different values for the masses .",
    "then in section [ pure ] we discuss the conditions required to reduce the original gauge field equations to equations of the pure chern - simons type .",
    "section [ nontopo ] is devoted to the derivation of the self - duality equations , and to the detailed analytical and numerical study of the cylindrically symmetric vortex solutions . in section [ domwa ]",
    "we discuss domain wall solutions with finite energy per unit length and use these to further examine the properties of the vortex solutions in the large flux limit .",
    "concluding remarks comprise the final section .",
    "our model possesses a local @xmath7 symmetry and is described by the following effective lagrangian    @xmath8    where @xmath9 is the topological mass , @xmath10 .",
    "we use natural units @xmath11 and the minkowski - space metric is @xmath12 .",
    "the covariant derivative is generalized as    @xmath13    where we have defined the dual field    @xmath14    in terms of the dual field the cs term takes the simpler form @xmath15 .",
    "the introduction of an anomalous magnetic term in the covariant derivative is consistent with the lorentz and the gauge invariance of the theory ; however it breaks the @xmath16 and @xmath17 symmetries .",
    "an specific feature of a @xmath6 dimensional world is that a pauli - type coupling ( @xmath18 a magnetic coupling ) can be incorporated into the covariant derivative , even for spinless particles @xcite .",
    "in fact , in reference @xcite it was demonstrated that radiative corrections can induce a magnetic coupling for anyons , proportional to the fractional spin .",
    "the electromagnetic interactions of charged anyons , in particular its magnetic moment , have also been discussed for point - particles in @xmath19 dimensions using the appropriate representations of the poincar group @xcite .",
    "the most general renormalizable potential in @xmath20 dimensions is of the form    @xmath21    as we shall see later , the particular second - order form of the scalar potential together with its overall strength are fixed by self - duality condition . for the time",
    "being we leave the parameter in ( [ pot ] ) free in order to discuss both the broken and the unbroken phases of the theory .    as paul and khare @xcite point out",
    "a cs term can be generated by spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "however , the properties of this cs term are not the same as those of the explicit cs term appearing in eq .",
    "( [ lag ] ) ; we would like to understand the origin of these differences .",
    "suppose the potential is selected to have symmetry breaking minimum at @xmath22",
    ". then in terms of the gauge invariant potential    @xmath23    the contribution of the covariant derivative to the lagrangian evaluated in the vacuum configurations ( @xmath22 ) can be written as    @xmath24\\ , .\\ ] ]    the first term in this expression is the usual gauge field mass ( @xmath25 ) generated by the spontanous symmetry breaking .",
    "the second term modifies the coefficient of the maxwell term in the lagrangian . finally , the last term is a kind of cs type term generated by the spontaneous symmetry breaking with topological mass @xmath26 .",
    "however the explicit cs term is of the form @xmath15 . instead , in the induced cs term @xmath27 couples to @xmath28 rather than to @xmath29 .",
    "the gauge field @xmath28 is massive so it has a finite correlation length .",
    "this does not imply that @xmath29 should also fall off exponentially ; it can remain a pure gauge .",
    "indeed this is the case around a vortex where the long range contribution , which is locally pure gauge , is globally non - trivial giving rise to a non - vanishing magnetic flux .",
    "one of the effects of the explicit cs term is that a vortex with magnetic flux @xmath30 must also carry electric charge @xmath31 , with the two quantities related as @xmath32 .",
    "the induced cs mass term @xmath26 does not contribute to this relation because of the finite correlation length of @xmath28 .",
    "consequently , we conclude that in topologically non - trivial sector the induced term @xmath33 in ( [ dermin ] ) has not the same properties as those of the cs term ; so it can not be considered a genuine cs term . only in the topologically trivial sector",
    "does the induced term have the same properties as those of the explicit cs term .",
    "the equations of motion for the lagrangian in ( [ lag ] ) are    @xmath34    @xmath35          =   j_\\nu - \\kappa f_\\nu    \\ ,   , \\ ] ]    where the conserved noether current is given as    @xmath36\\ , .\\ ] ]    from the equation of motion ( [ eqm2 ] ) it is clear that we can define a current @xmath37 that is also conserved .",
    "@xmath37 is defined by    @xmath38    if the current @xmath39 is bounded or vanishes faster than @xmath40 at spatial infinity , then the charges calculated from @xmath41 and @xmath42 coincide @xcite .",
    "let us further examine the gauge field equations of motion ( [ eqm2 ] ) expressed in terms of the electric and magnetic fields @xmath43 and @xmath44 respectively ; they read    @xmath45    these equations can be identified as the modified gauss and ampere laws respectively .",
    "one of the most important consequences of the cs term is the fact that any object with magnetic flux @xmath46 also carries electric charge @xmath47 , with the two quantities related as    @xmath48    indeed integrating the gauss law ( [ gauss ] ) over all space we find that the contribution of @xmath49 is zero , because of the long - distance damping produced by the `` photon '' mass .",
    "similarly the integral of the last term also vanishes ; this is true even if the symmetry is spontaneously broken .",
    "the reason , as explained earlier , is that in the higgs vacuum the current @xmath39 makes use of the massive field @xmath50 instead of @xmath29 .",
    "hence , we obtain the desired result in ( [ funda ] ) .    while the magnetic moment @xmath51 does not have a direct effect on the fundamental relation ( [ funda ] ) , it does produce interesting effects , one of which can be found in the magnetization of the excitations of the system .",
    "the magnetization is found by coupling an external magnetic field and extracting the linear coupling from the lagrangian ( [ lag ] ) .",
    "it is given by    @xmath52    where @xmath53 is the matter current in ( [ cur1 ] ) .",
    "utilizing the modified ampere law in ( [ gauss ] ) we find for a static configuration    @xmath54    in the absence of parity breaking terms the magnetization is equal to the magnetic flux , a result known for the neutral nielsen - olesen vortices @xcite . here",
    "@xmath55 has two extra pieces : the magnetic moment @xmath51 which induces a contribution proportional to the charge of the configuration ; and the term proportional to @xmath9 which , unlike the two first contributions , depends on the structure factor of the vortex configuration so can not be explicitly integrated .    finally , the energy momentum tensor is obtained by varying the curved - space form of the action with respect to the metric    @xmath56 + h. c. \\right )       \\ , ,    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath57 only includes the gauge potential contribution .",
    "the chern - simons and linear terms in @xmath51 do not appear explicitly in @xmath58 .",
    "this is consequence of the fact that these terms do not make use of the space - time metric tensor @xmath59 , thus when @xmath59 is varied to produce @xmath58 no contributions arise from these terms @xcite .",
    "the expression ( [ tmunu ] ) can be considered as the energy momentum tensors of an abelian higgs model in which the maxwell term is multiplied by a particular dielectric function of the form @xmath60 @xcite .",
    "the model described in the previous section has in general three propagating modes in the vacuum state , one of which corresponds to the scalar field . in order to describe the particle content of the gauge field degrees of freedom , we consider the broken phase in which the potential has a symmetry breaking minimum at @xmath22 .",
    "the plane wave solutions to the linearized maxwell equation ( [ gauss ] ) with @xmath61 and @xmath62 lead to the dispersion relation @xmath63 , where the photon masses are given by    @xmath64    the two values for the photon mass are related with two different polarizations of the electromagnetic wave . from the plane wave solution for @xmath65 and assuming that the wave propagates along the @xmath66axis we find that the the electric field can be written as    @xmath67    hence the waves are neither transverse nor longitudinal ; instead the solutions correspond to right - handed and left - handed longielliptic waves .",
    "we notice that the two masses in ( [ mass ] ) may also be deduced from the gauge propagator , or by the explicit analysis of the corresponding maxwell - proca equation .    from the work of pisarski and rao",
    "@xcite it is known that the combined effect of the cs term with the mass induced by the higgs mechanism produces two gauge modes with different masses . from ( [ mass ] ) it follows that to have two distinct masses it is required that both spontaneous symmetry breaking and at least one of the @xmath16 and @xmath17 violating terms exist .",
    "the induced term @xmath68 simply adds to the cs mass @xmath9 , as we are considering here the topologically trivial sector of the theory .",
    "our result in ( [ mass ] ) reduces to well known cases when the corresponding limits are considered : @xmath69 if the parity violating terms vanish @xmath70 we obtain the usual gauge mass @xmath71 produced by the spontaneous symmetry breaking ; @xmath72 in the symmetric phase @xmath73 there is only one propagating mode with mass @xmath9 . the existence of massive gauge invariant theories in @xmath2 dimension , without the higgs mechanism , is known from the topological massive gauge theories @xcite ; @xmath74 if we cancel the magnetic moment @xmath75 we recover the result of paul and khare @xcite .",
    "the stability of the model is a genuine concern , we now address this point . in terms of the electric and magnetic fields",
    "the energy density @xmath76 can be written as @xmath77 hence one may think that the magnetic moment contribution will in general spoil the positive definiteness of the hamiltonian .    to investigate the conditions required to have an stable model consider small scalar and gauge field fluctuations around the vacuum solution , in such a way that only quadratic terms on the fluctuation fields are retained .",
    "first , it is straightforward to check that the model is stable for small fluctuations of the scalar field",
    ". this fact would not be true in the presence of a constant external magnetic field ; however we recall that , because of the topological mass term , a constant magnetic field is not a solution of the equations of motion .",
    "the next step is to consider gauge field fluctuations , whereas the scalar field remains at the minimum of the potential , @xmath18 @xmath22 .",
    "clearly the energy remains positive definite if the following relation holds    @xmath78    if the previous relation is not satisfied then the model is no longer positive definite . in this case",
    "any gauge field fluctuation with wave vector @xmath79 , such that @xmath80 ) holds , thus expect the theory to be stable both for classical and quantum fluctuations of the fields .",
    "in particular , for a @xmath4 potential where @xmath73 condition ( [ condi1 ] ) is satisfied .",
    "the analysis above considered the stability of the model under the assumption of small field fluctuations .",
    "the analysis of the stability under large field fluctuations is a matter of further work . in this section",
    "we have analysed the propagating modes and the stablity of these solutions in the topological trivial sector ot the theory ; the stability of the soliton vortex configuration will be discussed at the end of section [ rota ] .",
    "a theory in which the maxwell kinetic term is dropped and the dynamics is solely provided by the cs term has been frequently considered @xcite . as mentioned in the introduction , charged vortex solutions",
    "are possible in these models . in the maxwell - chern - simons theory without magnetic moment interactions the pure cs limit can be formally obtained by taking the limit @xmath81 , @xmath9 @xmath82 keeping @xmath83 fixed and rescaling the gauge field by @xmath84 @xcite .",
    "this limit is shown to be equivalent to simply neglecting the @xmath85 term in the lagrangian . in the model described by ( [ lag ] )",
    "there is a particular relation between the cs mass and the anomalous magnetic moment for which the equations([eqm2 ] ) for the gauge fields reduce from second- to first - order differential equations @xcite , similar to those of the pure cs type . to obtain this limit",
    "we notice that if we set    @xmath86    then any solution to the equation ( [ eqm2 ] ) can be written as    @xmath87    where @xmath88 is an arbitrary constant and @xmath89 is solution of the homogeneous field equation    @xmath90    in the vacuum the original theory possesses two gauge propagating modes with different masses . in the limit",
    "@xmath91 the gauge field masses in ( [ mass ] ) reduce to @xmath92 and @xmath93 respectively .",
    "clearly the excitations described by the field @xmath89 carry a mass @xmath93 .",
    "however if the nonperturbative sector with vortex solutions is considered , it is easy to see that any solution to the homogeneous equation ( [ eqm3 ] ) gives an infinite contribution to the energy of the configuration . consequently for the solitons to have finite energy the constant @xmath88 in ( [ eqcs1 ] ) should be set to zero .",
    "hence when the relation ( [ kappag ] ) between the coupling constant holds , the gauge field equation of motion reduces to    @xmath94    this is a first order differential equation that automatically satisfies the second order equation ( [ eqm2 ] ) when @xmath91 .",
    "this equation has the same structure as that of the pure cs theory @xcite .",
    "so we shall refer to eqs .",
    "( [ kappag ] ) and ( [ eqcs2 ] ) as the pure cs limit .",
    "however we should notice that the explicit expression for @xmath39 differs from that of the usual pure cs theory , because according to eq .",
    "( [ dercov ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ cur1 ] ) @xmath39 receives contributions from the anomalous magnetic moment .",
    "the gauge field equation ( [ eqcs2 ] ) represents a first order differential equation , so its propagating modes should be characterized by only one mass .",
    "it is straightforward to check that this mass is given by @xmath95 .",
    "the other mass @xmath96 decouples in the non - trivial topological sector due to the finite energy condition .",
    "henceforth we work on the limit in which eqs .",
    "( [ kappag ] ) and ( [ eqcs2 ] ) are valid .",
    "consequently we shall consider eq .",
    "( [ eqcs2 ] ) instead of the eq .",
    "( [ eqm2 ] ) as the equation of motion for the gauge fields .    in terms of the gauge invariant potential in ( [ ainv ] )",
    "the pure cs equation ( [ eqcs2 ] ) reads    @xmath97",
    "in the bogolmolnyi limit all equations of motion are known to become first - order differential equations @xcite ; furthermore it is possible to recast the equations of motion as self - duality equations . in the pure cs limit ( [ kappag ] )",
    "the gauge field equations have been already reduced to the first - order equations in ( [ eqcs2 ] ) ; however the scalar field is still governed by the second - order equations ( [ eqm1 ] ) . here",
    "we outline the necessary steps to derive the self - duality limit .",
    "the self - duality equations for the @xmath4 model have been reported previously @xcite but are mentioned here for completeness and also to be used in the discussion of domain wall solutions .",
    "we can exploit the pure cs equation ( [ eqcs3 ] ) to eliminate @xmath98 and @xmath99 from the expression of the energy density in ( [ t00 ] ) .",

    "the energy written in the previous form is similar to the expression that appears in the nielsen - olesen model .",
    "thus , starting from eq .",
    "( [ ener1 ] ) we can follow the usual bogomolnyi - type arguments in order to obtain the self - dual limit . the energy may then be rewritten , after an integration by parts , as    @xmath103               \\cr                & + & \\int d^2 x   \\left [ v(\\phi ) - { 1 \\over 2 } \\kappa^2 |\\phi|^2    \\right ] \\ ,   +   \\ , { \\kappa^2 \\over e } |\\phi|    \\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath104 , @xmath105 and @xmath30 denotes the magnetic flux . from the previous equation we observe that the energy is bounded below ; for a fixed value of the magnetic flux the lower bound is given by @xmath106 , provided that the potential is chosen as @xmath107 with the critical value @xmath108 , @xmath18 when the scalar and the topological masses are equal . therefore in this limit",
    "we are necessarily within the symmetric phase of the theory . from eq .",
    "( [ ener2 ] ) we see that the lower bound for the energy    @xmath109    is saturated when the following self - duality equations are satisfied    @xmath110^{1/2 } }    \\ ,   , \\ ] ]    @xmath111^{1/2 }   } \\ ,",

    "we should remark that the present model in the self - duality limit corresponds to the bosonic part of a theory with an @xmath112 extended supersymmetry @xcite .",
    "equation ( [ sd1 ] ) implies that the magnetic field vanishes whenever @xmath113 does .",
    "the finiteness energy condition forces the scalar field to vanish both at the center of the vortex ( except for the nontopological solitons , see next section ) and also at spatial infinity ; consequently the magnetic flux of the vortices lies in a ring .",

    "indeed once that the boundary conditions are known , the `` quantum '' numbers of the soliton can be explicitly computed . with the ansatz ( [ ansatz ] )",
    "the magnetic field is @xmath136 , and so using the boundary conditions the magnetic flux and electric charge are    @xmath137    we shall later see that for every value of the vorticity @xmath118 the allowed values for @xmath138 are restricted according to eq .",

    "this indicates that the vortices are at the threshold of stability against decay to the elementary excitations because the ratio @xmath231 is equal to one at the critical point @xmath232 .",
    "in fact it is possible to consider a perturbative method away from the self - dual point @xcite to prove that the soliton is stable against dissociation into free scalar particles when the scalar mass is bigger than the topological mass ( @xmath18 @xmath233 ) .",
    "instead for @xmath234 the soliton becomes unstable .",
    "the self - dual point also corresponds to a point in which the vortices become noninteracting . again",
    "this property ensues from the fundamental relation ( [ ener3 ] ) . consider two solitons of charges @xmath235 and @xmath236 of the same sign that are far apart . according to ( [ ener3 ] )",
    "their total energy is @xmath237 .",
    "if the two vortices are superimposed at the same point , due to charge conservation the resulting configuration will represent a vortex solution of charge @xmath238 . then according to ( [ ener3 ] )",
    "the total energy will again be @xmath237 .",
    "we therefore conclude that the vortices are noninteracting .",
    "the perturbative analysis of reference @xcite shows that the vortex - vortex interaction is repulsive if @xmath233 and attractive if @xmath239 . the self - dual point @xmath108 represents a transition between a phase in which vortices attract and a phase in which they repel each other , similar to the transition between type i and type ii superconductors .",
    "in fact , what we demonstrate in the @xmath4 model is that the attraction between vortices due to the interaction through the scalar field has the same strength as the repulsion due to the interaction through the vector field .",
    "therefore when the range of the two interactions is the same ( @xmath108 ) the vortices become noninteracting . on the other hand if the range of the scalar interaction is smaller than the range of the vector interaction ( @xmath240 ) the inter - vortex potential is repulsive ; while for @xmath241 the potential is attractive .",
    "domain walls appear in theories where the scalar potential possesses two or more disconnected but degenerate minima .",
    "the field configuration interpolates between two adjacent minima of the potential ; the infinitely long boundary separating these two vacua states is precisely the domain wall . in @xmath242 dimensions the domain walls are planar structures , instead in @xmath243 dimensions they correspond to one dimensional structures with finite energy per unit length .",

    "the magnetic field is given by @xmath275 notice that for @xmath276 the magnetic field is concentrated near @xmath277 and falls off rapidly away from the wall .",
    "instead for @xmath278 the magnetic field vanishes at @xmath269 and the profile of @xmath175 is doubled peaked with maximums at @xmath279 .",
    "the method presented in this section resembles the one used to derive the self - duality equations , so it could be questioned wheter the two methods are equivalent . in general",
    "it is not so : the self - dual limit is valid when @xmath108 , whereas for the domain wall solution there is no such restriction .",

    "indeed , the vortex configurations simplify in the large @xmath118 limit and it is possible to utilize the domain wall as an approximated solution to the self - dual vortices .",
