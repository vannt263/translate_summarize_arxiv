    "\\label{iperp1}\\end{aligned}\\]]as we have already noted , the radiation intensity for the perpendicular polarization vanishes in the case of the normal incidence and this is explicitly seen from ( [ iperp1 ] ) . the radiation intensity for the parallel polarization",
    "is found from the relation@xmath76 with the total intensity given by ( [ intentotalgeneral ] ) .",
    "the radiation intensities for both polarizations have peaks corresponding to the zeros of the function @xmath77 .",
    "the angular location of the peaks is determined from the equation @xmath78note that the location of the peaks does not depend on the amplitude of the acoustic oscillations ( within the framework of the approximation used ) .",
    "the amplitude will determine the heights of the peaks .",
    "the last term in the right - hand side of ( [ peaks ] ) is induced by the acoustic waves .",
    "this term is of the order @xmath79 , with @xmath80 being the velocity for the acoustic waves . in the presence of acoustic waves we have a set of peaks specified by @xmath81 .",
    "the angular location of the peak with @xmath82 coincides with that for the peak in the absence of acoustic waves .",
    "the angular distance between the peaks induced by the acoustic waves is of the order @xmath79 .",
    "the condition ( [ peaks ] ) can be written in a physically more transparent form if , in addition to ( [ photk ] ) , we introduce the wave vector @xmath83 for the photon inside the plate ( in the absence of the acoustic wave ) , with the components @xmath84where @xmath85 ( note that the azimuthal angle @xmath57 is the same inside and outside the plate ) .",
    "now it can be seen that , with the help of this vector , the condition for the peaks is written in the form@xmath86with @xmath87 .",
    "the latter is the cherenkov condition for the medium of the plate .",
    "hence , we conclude that the peaks in the region @xmath88 , determined by the condition ( [ peaks ] ) , correspond to the cherenkov radiation emitted inside the plate and refracted from the boundary .",
    "we can have a situation where the cherenkov radiation emitted inside the plate is completely reflected from the boundary and in the exterior region we have no peaks . in this case",
    "the equation ( [ peaks ] ) has no solutions .",
    "we can also have cases then the cherenkov radiation is confined inside the plate in the absence of the acoustic excitations and the peaks defined by ( [ peaks ] ) appear as a result of the influence of the acoustic waves .",
    "note that the location of the peaks can also be controlled by choosing the incidence angle @xmath8 .",
    "various special cases of formulas ( [ intentotalgeneral ] ) and ( [ iperp1 ] ) can be considered . in the case of the normal incidence",
    "the radiation intensity for the perpendicular polarization vanishes and for the parallel polarization we recover the results of refs . @xcite and @xcite for the x - ray and optical transition radiations respectively . in the absence of the acoustic wave we have @xmath89 and in formulas ( intentotalgeneral ) and ( [ iperp1 ] ) the @xmath82 term contributes only . in this case",
    "we obtain the quasi - classical approximation for the radiation intensity for oblique incidence . the corresponding exact expression for the radiation intensity in this problem is well known from the literature pafo69 ( see also refs .",
    "@xcite-@xcite ) .",
    "the features of the optical transition radiation in a finite thickness plate for an oblique incidence have been discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite on the base of pafomov s formulas . for a transparent material in the over - threshold case and under the condition @xmath90 , the dominant contribution comes from the term in the exact formula with the resonant factor @xmath91 , with @xmath92 given by the argument of the sin function in ( intentotalgeneral ) with @xmath82 .",
    "now , for simplicity considering the case of the radiation into the vacuum , it can be seen that for a relativistic particle with @xmath93 , the radiation intensity near the cherenkov peaks is well approximated by the formulas obtained from ( [ intentotalgeneral ] ) and ( [ iperp1 ] ) in the limit @xmath89 .",
    "for given values of @xmath8 and @xmath57 , the equation ( [ peaks ] ) determines the location of the peaks with respect to the polar angle @xmath94 .",
    "we will denote the corresponding values by @xmath95 . at the peaks",
    "the total radiation intensity is given by the expressions@xmath96for the relative contribution of the component with the perpendicular polarization one gets @xmath97 in the absence of the ultrasonic vibrations the location of the peak is given by @xmath98 .",
    "the ultrasound reduces the height of this peak by the factor @xmath99 . in particular , for a given radiation frequency , the frequency or the amplitude of the ultrasound can be tuned to eliminate this peak ( see the numerical example below ) .    in the limit @xmath100 , by using the formula @xmath101 , with @xmath102 being the dirac delta function , for the spectral - angular density of the total radiation energy per unit length we find@xmath103   \\notag \\\\ & & \\qquad \\times \\mathbf{q}^{2}(\\theta , \\varphi , \\alpha ) \\sum_{m=-\\infty } ^{+\\infty } j_{m}^{2}\\left ( \\frac{\\omega \\delta \\varepsilon /(2ck_{s})}{\\sqrt{% \\varepsilon _ { 0}-\\varepsilon _ { 1}\\sin ^{2}\\theta } } \\right ) ,   \\label{iominf}\\end{aligned}\\]]where @xmath104",
    ". a similar formula is obtained from ( [ iperp1 ] ) for the perpendicular polarization . in this case",
    "the radiation along a given direction has discrete spectrum @xmath105 , determined by the relation @xmath106 , or explicitly@xmath107the spectral distribution of the radiation intensity is obtained from ( iominf ) by the integration over @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "having the general analysis for the radiation intensity , we turn to numerical examples",
    ". we will be interested in the optical transition radiation .",
