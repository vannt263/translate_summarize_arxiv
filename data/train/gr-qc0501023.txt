    "students often see special relativity as having an inherent elegance , but see no overlap with the problems they study in an introductory physics course . to tie the two student experiences",
    "closer together , this paper presents a relativistic treatment of two of the simpler problems studied in elementary mechanics courses : ballistic motion and the simple pendulum .",
    "these familiar examples share an important feature : in both problems , the driving force is the weight of gravity .",
    "this feature opens the possibility of treating these problems relativistically by elementary means .",
    "this possibility arises due to the equivalence principle .",
    "all objects have the same acceleration in a gravitational field ; a rock and a feather fall at the same rate in a gravitational field .",
    "consequently , objects in a freely falling frame ( like a falling elevator ) have no apparent weight .    in relativistic gravitation theories , like einstein s general relativity",
    ", the interpretation of the equivalence principle goes in the opposite direction . in these theories",
    "it is the freely falling frame that is the inertial frame . in a frame that is not freely falling",
    ", an apparent weight force arises .",
    "but it is a pseudoforce , a fictitious force like the centrifugal force , and is an artifact of the noninertial reference frame.@xcite thus a downward apparent weight force is perceived on the surface of the earth because the surface of the earth is accelerating upward at 9.81m / s@xmath0 with respect to a freely falling frame .    here",
    "we exploit this point of view . to study ballistic motion and pendula",
    ", we do not need a complete relativistic theory of gravity ; we need only to account for the weight force ( or pseudoforce ) .",
    "we work completely in gravity - free special relativity , and we introduce weight by working in an upward accelerating special relativistic reference frame .    this article is intended for students who have had only the beginnings of relativity . all that is required is the simple ( one - dimensional ) lorentz transform , the concept of proper time along a worldline , the acceleration four - vector , and the fact that its components in different reference frames are related by the lorentz transformation . for more advanced students , the results may still be of interest , and are more easily derived with techniques like covariant differentiation . for such students , a more compact presentation , using more advanced techniques ,",
    "is given in appendix  [ sec : appendixb ] . in order to give a more accessible description ,",
    "some details are relegated to the endnotes .",
    "we may take the relativistic point of view in introductory newtonian physics by invoking a freely falling @xmath1 reference frame near the surface of a flat earth , and by considering this reference frame to be an inertial frame . in this inertial frame ,",
    "the @xmath2 spatial coordinates constitute a cartesian spatial grid , and @xmath3 is the universal time of newtonian physics .",
    "we then imagine a swarm of tiny rocket ships accelerating upward with respect to the inertial frame . at @xmath4",
    "each of the rockets is ( momentarily ) at rest .",
    "we assign labels @xmath5 to the rockets , such that at @xmath4 we have @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 . because the rockets move in the @xmath9 direction , they maintain @xmath7 and @xmath8 , but @xmath9 for each rocket is a function of time and it is this time dependence that make our rocket - borne reference frame an accelerated , and therefore noninertial , frame with a weight force like that of the earth s surface",
    ".    we clearly want to have our rocket - borne reference frame to be accelerating upward . in newtonian mechanics",
    "this acceleration would be done by choosing @xmath10 with this choice each rocket moves in the same way and the spatial @xmath5 grid is always a cartesian system for measuring distances .",
    "newton s second law can be used in this noninertial system if every mass element @xmath11 is taken to have a gravitational ( pseudo)force @xmath12 acting on it in the negative @xmath13 direction .",
    "we can do mechanics either in the freely falling inertial frame with no gravity or in the noninertial frame with gravity .",
    "in special relativity the equivalent construction has some new subtleties .",
    "our primary reference frame @xmath1 is now a minkowski coordinate system , with no gravity . as in the newtonian case",
    ", we again invoke the swarm of rockets that are momentarily at rest in the @xmath1 frame at @xmath4 .",
    "again we assign labels to the rockets such that @xmath7 and @xmath8 for all @xmath3 .",
    "we must now choose how the rockets are to accelerate , that is , we must specify @xmath14 for each rocket .",
    "it turns out that the @xmath14 in eq .",
    "( [ newtxoft ] ) is not ideal in special relativity .",
    "the reference frame created by that @xmath14 would have undesirable features .",
    "for example , a rocketeer might want to measure the distance from her rocket to another nearby rocket .",
    "this measurement would be done in her momentarily comoving frame .",
    "the distance measured in this way will change in time .",
    "the rocket frame , then , would not be an unchanging frame like the reference frame used in introductory newtonian mechanics .",
    "the choice of @xmath14 that is close to ideal turns out to be@xcite @xmath15 where @xmath16 is a constant .",
    "the reason for favoring this choice is not at all obvious , but at least one of its features is comforting . for @xmath17 , eq .",
    "( [ x2minusc2t2 ] ) becomes @xmath18 thus , when a rocket is moving at nonrelativistic velocity ( @xmath19 ) , this relativistic choice of @xmath14 takes the newtonian form in eq .",
    "( [ newtxoft ] ) if we take the acceleration to be to be @xmath20 .",
    "the constant @xmath16 in eq .  ( [ x2minusc2t2 ] ) can be different for each rocket , as in eq .",
    "( [ newtxoft ] ) , so that this constant can be used to assign an @xmath13 coordinate to each rocket . as we shall demonstrate",
    ", it is best to do this by choosing@xcite @xmath21 the meaning of @xmath13 is potentially confusing .",
    "it is a constant along the world line of any particular rocket .",
    "but we will also use it as a spatial label in the @xmath13 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 system . a particle  like a ballistic projectile or a pendulum bob",
    " moving from one rocket location to another would have a time varying value of @xmath13 , and it is meaningful to consider @xmath24 for such a particle",
    ".    the @xmath5 system will be our our earth - like system .",
    "it is to be considered a spatial reference frame only and is not part of a minkowski system . to help avoid confusion",
    "we will not ( except in appendix  [ sec : appendixb ] ) endow this reference frame with an associated time coordinate .",
    "rather , we will discuss the dynamics of particles ( ballistic projectiles and pendulum bobs ) with the proper time @xmath25 for those particles , the time measured by clocks carried on the particles .",
    "the real justification for eq .",
    "( [ srtxoft ] ) is that with this choice , the rocket - borne @xmath5 reference frame has three important properties that qualify it as an earth - like spatial reference frame .",
    "these properties are best understood with a spacetime diagram like that in fig .",
    "[ fig : spacetime ] .",
    "the diagram shows worldlines for two arbitrary rockets , labeled 1 and 2 . according to eq .",

    "is an event on the worldline of rocket 1 , and @xmath29 is a minkowski coordinate system instantaneously comoving with rocket 1 at event @xmath27 .",
    "event @xmath30 ( coordinates @xmath31 ) is the event on the worldline of rocket 2 that is simultaneous , in the instantaneously comoving frame , with @xmath27 .",
    "that is , events @xmath27 and @xmath30 have the same value of @xmath32 , and are simultaneous as seen in the reference frame of @xmath27 .",
    "the three special properties of the earth - like system include the following .",
    "( i ) in a frame that is instantaneously comoving with one rocket , all rockets are instantaneously at rest .",
    "( in other words , the velocity @xmath33 of rocket 2 at @xmath30 is the same as that of rocket 1 at @xmath27 . )",
    "( ii ) the acceleration of each rocket is a constant in time .",
    "( iii ) the distance between any two rockets , as measured in an instantaneously comoving frame , is time independent .",
    "these properties , proved in appendix  [ sec : appendixa ] , establish that the rocket - borne @xmath5 system is a `` rigid '' framework for spatial measurements .",
    "although it is not part of an inertial reference frame , it is , in a sense , the same at all times .",
    "a ballistic projectile has only the weight force acting on it .",
    "this means that its worldline will be straight in a minkowski coordinate system.@xcite with little loss in generality we choose the projectile to be moving in the @xmath34 plane , with @xmath9 having the fixed value @xmath35 , so that the projectile starts off with @xmath36 at @xmath4 . in the freely falling @xmath1 frame ,",
    "the projectile is moving only in the @xmath37 direction , and we specify its motion by @xmath38 .",
    "a moment of proper time @xmath39 and of coordinate time @xmath40 are related , as usual , by @xmath41 .",
    "we choose @xmath25 to be zero when @xmath3 is zero , and the complete description of the projectile motion in the freely falling frame becomes @xmath42 with eq .",

    "it is of interest that the trajectory ends at the point @xmath49 ,   @xmath50 , corresponding to the proper time @xmath51 .",
    "this sudden end is not an indication of a dramatic physical event .",
    "rather , it signals the limit of the ability of the @xmath13 @xmath52 @xmath53 coordinates to cover the spacetime.@xcite",
    "the key idea in understanding the pendulum is the requirement that the motion is determined by constraining forces in the @xmath5 frame . in the specific case of pendulum motion ,",
    "the constraint is that the pendulum bob move in a circular arc .",
    "we will , however , not immediately confine ourselves to the case of a circular - motion pendulum , but will keep the description as general as possible for as long as possible .",
    "initially we will suppose only that the motion can be described by two functions @xmath54 , @xmath55.@xcite the constraint on the motion ( for example , that the particle move in an arc of radius @xmath56 ) can be thought of a curve in the @xmath13-@xmath22 plane .",
    "we are faced now with the task of combining a description of a constrained path in the earth - like @xmath5 frame , with an understanding of gravity ( there is no gravity ) in an inertial frame . to do this",
    ", we consider a single moment for the pendulum bob , and invoke the @xmath29 minkowski system that is instantaneously comoving with the earth - like frame.@xcite because the earth - like frame and the instantaneously comoving frame are momentarily at rest with respect to each other , the spatial directions at that moment are the same in the two frames . then in the instantaneously comoving frame , we can describe both the constraining path and the ( nonexistent ) nature of gravity .",
    "we now let @xmath57 be the primed - frame components of the 4-velocity of the particle , so that the components of the acceleration 4-vector are @xmath58 the requirement that there is no acceleration in the direction of motion means that @xmath59 for any motion,@xcite the 4-acceleration and the 4-velocity satisfy @xmath60 equations ( [ notangent ] ) and ( [ adotu ] ) tell us that @xmath61 must be zero , and hence that @xmath62 must be zero .",
