    "nearly thirty years after its discovery by lynds ( 1971 ) , the ly@xmath0forest continues to provide fertile ground for observational and theoretical studies .",
    "new echelle spectrographs on large telescopes , most notably the high resolution spectrograph ( hires , @xcite ) on keck i , have provided spectra of exceptional quality and detail .",
    "this has permitted extensive study of many important properties of the ly@xmath0  forest as comprehensively reviewed by rauch ( 1998 ) .",
    "complementary to this quality observational data , cosmological simulations which utilize gas hydrodynamics have improved our understanding of the nature of the forest clouds .",
    "these simulations have shown that the formation of the ly@xmath0  forest is a natural consequence of the growth of structure in the universe through hierarchical clustering in the presence of a uv ionizing background ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . in this class of models , low column density h  iclouds ( log  @xmath1(h  i)@xmath1114 , where @xmath1(h  i )",
    "is measured in @xmath12 ) are found preferentially in voids whilst stronger lines are associated with higher density clouds which arise in filamentary structures around collapsed objects .",
    "important clues to the origin of ly@xmath0  clouds can be gleaned from their clustering properties and chemical composition .",
    "early investigations of the ly@xmath0  forest found no evidence of metals associated with the h  i clouds , suggesting that they consisted of pristine material ( @xcite ) .",
    "more concerted efforts however , did provide some evidence for metals in the forest either individually ( meyer & york 1987 ) or in a stacked spectrum ( lu 1991 ) .",
    "the realization that metal enrichment is in fact widespread in high column density ly@xmath0  clouds has come relatively recently with the availability of hires on the keck i telescope .",
    "a number of studies ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) have found that c  iv absorption is seen in approximately 50% of forest clouds with log  @xmath1(h  i)@xmath1314.5 and in about 90% of clouds with log  @xmath1(h  i)@xmath1315 . evidently the intergalactic medium ( igm ) has been enriched by the products of stellar nucleosynthesis even at redshifts as high as @xmath14 .",
    "photoionization models ( e.g. @xcite ) can reproduce the observed c  iv / h  i  ratio at @xmath15 for a typical carbon abundance = \\log \\left ( { n(x ) \\over n(h ) } \\right ) - \\log \\left ( { n(x ) \\over n(h ) } \\right ) _ { \\odot}$ ] ] [ c / h ] = @xmath16 .",
    "rauch , haehnelt , & steinmetz ( 1997 ) predict an order of magnitude scatter in [ c / h ] in models where random sight - lines are cast through protogalactic clumps , a prediction corroborated by the data .",
    "two scenarios have been suggested to explain the presence of metals in the ly@xmath0  forest ; early pre - enrichment by a widespread episode of star formation , possibly associated with pop iii stars , or _ in - situ _ enrichment whereby the h  i  cloud is enriched locally either by contamination from a nearby galaxy or by star formation within the cloud itself ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "cosmological simulations of a two phase ism recently performed by gnedin ( 1998 ) confirm the results of gnedin & ostriker ( 1997 ) that the dominant process for transportation of heavy elements into the igm is mergers of protogalaxies in dark matter halos .",
    "one may expect that for the scenario of _ in - situ _ enrichment , where metals are synthesized relatively close to the ly@xmath0  clouds being observed , the metallicities would be highly inhomogeneous depending on the proximity of a given ly@xmath0  cloud to a star - forming region and its past merger history .",
    "if , however , the bulk of the metals is formed by an episode of pop iii star formation at sufficiently high redshift ( @xmath17 in the models of ostriker & gnedin 1996 ) , a more uniform [ c / h ] may have been established by @xmath15 , if the mixing mechanism is efficient .",
    "discrimination between these two enrichment scenarios is probably best addressed in the low column density regime .",
    "since the optical depth of ly@xmath0  clouds is roughly indicative of the baryon overdensity , studying low column density lines will give us an insight into the low mass systems .",
    "in the simulations of gnedin & ostriker ( 1997 ) , for example , a sudden drop in metallicity is predicted for ly@xmath0  clouds with log  @xmath1(h  i)@xmath1114 where the star formation rate is expected to be much lower than in higher density clouds .",
    "however , determining the [ c / h ] abundance in weak ly@xmath0 clouds has been observationally challenging due to the extreme weakness of c  iv absorption when log  n(h  i ) @xmath18 . in order to overcome the difficulty of a direct c  iv detection ,",
    "this problem has recently been tackled with two different approaches which have produced apparently conflicting results .",
    "lu et al . ( 1998 ) tackled the problem by stacking almost 300 c  iv  regions to produce a composite spectrum , a method first applied to qso spectra by norris , peterson & hartwick ( 1983 ) . having found no c  iv  in their summed spectrum ( which had a final s / n ratio of 1860 ) lu et al .",
    "used monte carlo simulations to place an upper limit on the carbon abundance in clouds with log  @xmath1(h  i)@xmath19 of [ c / h]@xmath20 .",
    "a different conclusion was reached by cowie & songaila ( 1998 ) who used distributions of ly@xmath0 optical depths , @xmath21 , to build distributions of corresponding @xmath22(c  iv ) on a pixel - by - pixel basis .",
    "a comparison between the @xmath22(c  iv ) distribution and a reference ` blank ' distribution showed a residual signal sufficiently strong to be consistent with [ c / h]@xmath23 for ly@xmath0  clouds with log  @xmath1(h  i ) as low as 13.5 .",
    "thus , whilst lu et al . interpreted their results as evidence against a uniform enrichment of the igm at @xmath15 , cowie & songaila proposed that transportation / ejection mechanisms from early sites of star formation are much more efficient than anticipated , in order to pollute ly@xmath0  clouds uniformly over a range of n(h  i ) of nearly 4 orders of magnitude .",
    "in this paper we aim to address the contradiction between these two earlier analyses by taking another look at the metallicity in the ly@xmath0  forest using new data which are among the best ever obtained for this purpose ; almost 9 hours of hires observations ( described in  2 ) of the ultra - luminous qso apm 08279 + 5255 . in ",
    "3 we define the redshift interval over which we search for c  iv  absorption ; the very high s / n of the spectrum in the c  ivregion allows us to refine earlier estimates of the typical c  iv / h  i  ratio in ly@xmath0  lines with log  @xmath1(h  i)@xmath24 (  4 ) . in  5",
    "we investigate whether this high quality , independent data set can help resolve the current discrepancy between the results of lu et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and cowie & songaila ( 1998 ) , thus shedding some light on the origin of the metals observed in low column density ly@xmath0  clouds .",
    "we summarize our main results in  6 .",
    "the target for these observations is apm 08279 + 5255 , an ultra - luminous broad absorption line ( bal ) quasar discovered by irwin et al .",
    "( 1998 ) during a survey of galactic halo carbon stars .",
    "the emission redshift @xmath25 measured by irwin et al . from the c  iv  @xmath26 and n  v @xmath27 emission lines has recently been refined to @xmath28 by downes et al .",
    "( 1999 ) who detected co emission .",
    "given the difficulty in measuring a precise redshift from the uv emission lines which are affected by the bal phemomenon , the difference is probably not significant ; in the following analysis we adopt @xmath29 as the systemic redshift of the qso .",
    "positionally coincident with an iras faint source catalog object with a 60 micron flux of 0.51jy , apm 08279 + 5255 has an optical r magnitude=15.2 and an inferred bolometric luminosity of @xmath30l@xmath31 making it the most luminous object currently known .",
    "adaptive optics imaging with the cfht ( @xcite ) has resolved apm 08279 + 5255 into two images separated by 0.35 arcsec in the ne ",
    "sw direction with an intensity ratio @xmath32/@xmath33 in the @xmath34-band .    for our purposes ,",
    "apm 08279 + 5255 is a nearly ideal background source for investigating the ly@xmath0  forest and associated metal absorption lines at high s / n ratio and resolution .",
    "the data presented here were obtained with hires on the keck i telescope on three runs in april and may 1998 .",
    "details of the observations are presented in table 1 .",
    "apm 08279 + 5255 is unresolved in these observations .",
    "the cross disperser and echelle angles were used in a variety of settings to give almost complete wavelength coverage between 4400 and 9250  .",
    "the emission spectrum of a th - ar hollow cathode lamp provided a wavelength reference and a continuum source internal to the spectrograph was used for a first order correction of the echelle blaze function .",
    "the data were reduced using barlow s ( 1999 , in preparation ) customized hires reduction package ( har ) .",
    "the individual , sky - subtracted spectra were mapped onto a linear wavelength scale with a dispersion of 0.04   per wavelength bin and then co - added with a weight proportional to their s / n . finally , this co - added spectrum was normalized by fitting a cubic spline function with starlink software to continuum regions deemed to be free of absorption . even in the dense forest of ly@xmath0  lines at wavelengths below that of ly@xmath0  emission ,",
    "continuum windows can be identified at the high resolution of our data .    the final co - added spectrum has a resolution of 6 km s@xmath35 , sampled with @xmath36 3.5 wavelength bins , and s / n between 30 and 150 . over the range of interest for c  iv  absorption ( see  3 below ) the typical signal - to - noise ratio is s / n @xmath37 .",
    "at the mean @xmath38 the @xmath39 detection limit for the rest - frame equivalent width of c  iv absorption line with the typical fwhm = 22  km  s@xmath35 ( see later ) is @xmath40(1548)@xmath41  m , which corresponds to a column density log  @xmath1(c  iv ) = 11.88 .",
    "thus these data are comparable to those obtained by songaila & cowie ( 1996 ) for q0014 + 813 and q1422 + 231 , their best observed qsos .",
    "the full spectrum is described elsewhere ( ellison et al .",
    "1999 ) and is available via anonymous ftp from ftp.ast.cam.ac.uk ( pub / sara / apm0827 ) .",
    "apm 08279 + 5255 belongs to a class of objects whose spectra are known to exhibit broad , high velocity , intrinsic absorption lines . before proceeding we",
    "must therefore define a working wavelength interval over which we can study c  iv  and ly@xmath0  lines in our spectrum and be confident that we are not confusing them with absorption from ejected material .",
    "the upper limit of this interval ( for c  iv ) is 7280     ( @xmath42 ) , at the blue edge of the broad c  iv absorption trough which corresponds to an ejection velocity @xmath43  km  s@xmath35 relative to the systemic redshift .",
    "the lower limit for the c iv interval is 6365    ( @xmath44 ) , the wavelength of ly@xmath45  emission .",
    "we excluded the region of the spectrum blueward of this wavelength in order to avoid confusion of ly@xmath0with ly@xmath45  lines .",
    "we further excluded a small region between 6860 and 6950    which is contaminated by the atmospheric b band .    in principle , some of the c  iv doublets in our sample could still be related to the bal phenomenon and be intrinsic to the qso rather than intervening absorbers , since ejecta have been observed at velocities as large as 60,000 km s@xmath35 .",
    "however , we found no evidence of this in apm 08279 + 5255 .",
    "for example , none of the c  iv systems at @xmath46 show any indication of partial coverage of the qso ( one of the signatures of intrinsic absorption ) , whereas we do see such an effect for systems at @xmath47 .",
    "most importantly , as we will discuss below , the density of c  iv  absorbers per unit redshift between @xmath48 and @xmath49 is entirely compatible with that measured towards non - bal qsos ",
    "there is no excess of c  iv  absorbers within our working wavelength interval .",
    "before addressing the question of civ absorption in ly@xmath0  clouds with 13.5@xmath51 log n(h  i ) @xmath52 , the first stage of our analysis is to determine the typical @xmath1(c  iv)/@xmath1(h  i ) ratio in ly@xmath0  clouds with log @xmath1(h  i ) @xmath50 .",
    "the aim is to provide an independent measure of this quantity , and therefore of the metallicity of ly@xmath0  clouds , for comparison with the results of cowie et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and songaila & cowie ( 1996 ) .",
    "these authors found that at a detection limit log  @xmath1(c  iv ) @xmath53 approximately half of the ly@xmath0  lines with log  @xmath1(h  i)@xmath50 have associated c  iv absorption .",
    "ly@xmath0lines above this column density cut - off are saturated and therefore not on the linear part of the curve of growth .",
    "therefore , an accurate @xmath1(h  i ) can not normally be measured without higher - order lyman lines such as ly@xmath45  or ly@xmath54  that are not saturated .",
    "cowie et al . (",
    "1995 ) circumvented this difficulty by assuming that at log  @xmath1(h  i)@xmath50 the residual flux in the core of a ly@xmath0  absorption line is @xmath55 for the mean value of the doppler parameter of @xmath56  km s@xmath35   determined by carswell et al .",
    "( 1991 ) , where @xmath57 is the one - dimensional velocity dispersion of the absorbers projected along the line of sight ] .",
    "this approach is of course critically sensitive to a precise determination of the zero level .",
    "figure 1 shows the ly@xmath0  forest in apm  08279 + 5525 between @xmath58 and 3.701 ; in this redshift interval there are 58 ly@xmath0  lines with @xmath55 .",
    "however a search for corresponding c  ivabsorption yielded only 22 c  iv  systems ( 38% ) at a significance level of @xmath59 .",
    "this apparent discrepancy led us to examine how accurately the @xmath60 cut actually selects ly@xmath0  clouds with log  @xmath1(h  i)@xmath61 . to this end",
    "we used the profile fitting package vpfit ( @xcite ) to determine the column density , redshift and @xmath62 parameter of ly@xmath0  lines with @xmath63 .",
    "we found that although these lines are saturated , in most cases there is sufficient information in the absorption profiles for vpfit to converge to a reliable solution .",
    "fitting all lines which do not have a flat core at zero residual intensity , showed that 22 out of 58 ly@xmath0  lines with @xmath63 do in fact have log  @xmath1(h  i)@xmath64 .",
    "we have reproduced some examples in figure 2 and table 3 .",
    "the revised sample then consists of 36 ly@xmath0  lines with _ measured _ log  @xmath1(h  i)@xmath65 ; 20 of these ( 56% ) have associated c  iv systems .",
    "this fraction is in good agreement , although somewhat fortuitously , with the value of @xmath66% reported by songaila & cowie ( 1996 ) .",
    "all of the c  iv systems found within our redshift interval were fitted with voigt profiles using vpfit ( all c  ivlines were unsaturated , thus allowing accurate determinations of their column densities ) and the model parameter fits for @xmath67 , @xmath1(c  iv ) , and @xmath62 are listed in table 2 .",

    "] a maximum likelihood ( e.g. schechter & press 1976 ) fit to the total ( unbinned ) sample of 20 c  iv  systems yielded @xmath83 for column densities in the range @xmath84log",
    "@xmath1(c  iv ) @xmath85 .",
    "this value of @xmath0 , which is shown as a solid line in figure 4 , would indicate a flatter power law distribution than the value @xmath86 ( dashed line in figure 4 ) deduced by songaila ( 1997 ) from her analysis of a larger sample of 81 c  iv absorbers towards seven qsos .",
    "formally , the difference is significant . a kolmogorov - smirnov ( k - s ) test returns a 76% probability that our data points are drawn from a distribution with @xmath87 , but only a @xmath88% probability that they arise by chance from a distribution with @xmath86",
    "however , there are significant variations in the statistics of c  iv absorbers between different sight - lines in songaila s sample and the integral of our power - law distribution , @xmath89  @xmath12 , is the same as that reported by songaila for one of the sight - lines in her study , towards q0956 + 122 .",
    "thus the difference between our best fitting value of @xmath0 and that determined by songaila ( 1997 ) may just be due to the limited statistics of the current samples .",
    "we now turn to the question of whether ly@xmath0  clouds with log  @xmath1(h  i)@xmath90 have a significantly lower metallicity than those with log  @xmath1(h  i)@xmath68 .",
    "( 1998 ) tackled this problem by stacking together the c  iv regions corresponding to @xmath91 ly@xmath0  lines towards nine qsos ; no significant signal was found in the final composite spectrum . in constructing their sample ,",
    "lu et al . targeted column densities in the range @xmath92 log@xmath93 and , for expediency , assumed that this range corresponds to values of residual flux @xmath94 .",
    "although our statistics are more limited , we can improve on previous analyses by constructing our sample more carefully and by simulating the results of the stacking process for our _ observed _ distributions of column densities and @xmath62-values , as we now discuss .",
    "we started by using vpfit to fit all unsaturated ly@xmath0  lines in the spectrum of apm  08279 + 5525 between @xmath95 and 3.701 .",
    "this produced a sample of 86 lines with @xmath92log @xmath96 .",
    "had we selected on the basis of @xmath97 rather than @xmath1(h  i ) , approximately 30% of lines in the desired column density range would have been missed , and 35% of lines outside the range would have been erroneously included .",
    "the lines missed are mainly lines with large values of @xmath62 , and lines which are partially blended but for which vpfit can still satisfactorily recover the individual values of @xmath1(h  i ) . in the next step we visually inspected the c  iv region corresponding to each ly@xmath0  line to assess whether it is suitable for stacking ;",
    "regions contaminated by atmospheric features or blended with other lines were excluded .",
    "this produced a final list of 51 c  iv@xmath7 regions and 40 c  iv  @xmath98 regions each 7    wide , which could be stacked .",
    "after reducing each portion of the spectrum to the rest frame using the values of @xmath99 appropriate to each ly@xmath0  line ( as measured with vpfit ) , the regions were summed and renormalized .",
    "the final co - added spectrum has s / n = 580 and is reproduced in figure 5a .",
    "it is clear from figure 5a that no absorption is detected in the stacked spectrum . in order to assess the significance of this non - detection , we compare the stacked spectrum with that obtained by adding together the same number of c  iv  lines with strengths predicted for different values of @xmath1(c  iv)/@xmath1(h  i ) . in performing these simulations",
    "we again made use of the available information on the distribution of column densities and @xmath62-values appropriate to each line , rather than assuming representative values of these quantities , as was done in earlier analyses .",
    "specifically , we simulated the absorption profiles of 51 c  iv@xmath7 lines assigning to each a column density @xmath1(c  iv)@xmath100 = @xmath1(h  i)@xmath101 , where @xmath1(h  i)@xmath100 is the neutral hydrogen column density returned by vpfit for the @xmath102th ly@xmath0  line , and @xmath103 is the adopted ratio @xmath1(c  iv)/@xmath1(h  i ) .",
    "we repeated the simulations for three values of @xmath104 ( cowie & songaila 1998 ) , @xmath105 , the median value deduced here for clouds with log  @xmath1(h  i)@xmath2 , and @xmath106 , a factor of two lower than our median .",
    "concerning the value of @xmath62 to be assigned to each c  iv line in the simulations , we could in principle consider two possibilities . if @xmath62 reflected primarily large - scale motions of the absorbing gas , @xmath107 . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath62 has mainly a thermal origin , the @xmath62-values would scale as the square root of the atomic mass and @xmath108 .",
    "the real situation will be somewhere between these two extremes .",
    "rauch et al .",
    "( 1996 ) found mean and median values of @xmath109 near 10  km s@xmath35  from their analysis of 208 c  iv absorption components , and concluded that both thermal motions and bulk motions contribute to the line broadening .",
    "our distribution of @xmath109 for ly@xmath0  clouds with log  @xmath1(h  i)@xmath110 has a median value @xmath111  km s@xmath35 whereas for @xmath112 log  @xmath1(h  i)@xmath113 we find a median @xmath114 . in the simulations we therefore adopted @xmath115 , with the implicit assumption that there is no significant change in the distribution of @xmath62-values with column density .",
    "theoretical c  iv@xmath7 absorption line profiles were computed in this manner for the 51 ly@xmath0  lines in our sample , convolved with the instrumental resolution , and then co - added .",
    "the resulting composite profiles , degraded with random noise corresponding to the s / n = 580 of the real stacked data , are shown in figures 5b , c , and d. also shown in these panels is the corresponding theoretical absorption profile for the mean @xmath1(c  iv ) .",
    "the case @xmath116 ( figure 5b ) produces a composite absorption feature which is significant at the @xmath117 level ; such a high value of the @xmath1(c  iv)/@xmath1(h  i ) ratio would therefore appear to be excluded by our observations . at these low optical depths the equivalent width of the co - added c  iv@xmath7 line scales linearly with @xmath103 .",
    "thus , if the median @xmath118 found above for ly@xmath0  clouds with log  @xmath1(h  i ) @xmath50 also applied at log  @xmath1(h  i ) @xmath119 , we may also expect a detectable signal ( @xmath120 , figure 5c ) , whereas no composite absorption would be recognized if @xmath121 ( figure 5d ) .    in the above simulations we have assumed that @xmath122 .",
    "however , in reality there is likely to be a dispersion of values of @xmath123 .",
    "we have already seen that @xmath115 , indicative of the fact that ly@xmath0  absorption takes place over a wider velocity range than c  iv .",
    "if we compare the _ measured _ values of @xmath124 and @xmath125 in the 20 ly@xmath0  clouds with log  @xmath1(h  i ) @xmath50 which show c  iv absorption (  4 above ) , we find a distribution of values of @xmath126 with @xmath127 which corresponds to a velocity dispersion of 27  km s@xmath35 .",
    "we therefore repeated the simulations above assuming that the c  iv@xmath7 lines to be stacked are drawn at random from a gaussian distribution of @xmath126 with this value of @xmath57 ; the results are reproduced in figures 6b , c , and d.    clearly , once this redshift dispersion is introduced in the sample , the signal in the stacked spectrum is blurred to the point where it is questionable whether it would be detected even if @xmath1(c  iv)/@xmath1(h  i ) @xmath128 .",
    "although the average residual intensity in figure 6b is less than one , the absorption is so diffuse that it becomes difficult to distinguish it from small fluctuations of the continuum level .",
    "we thus seem to have identified a fundamental limitation of the stacking method for the detection of very weak absorption features .",
    "unless it can be shown that @xmath129 decreases with log  @xmath1(h  i ) , it would appear that the uncertainty in the exact redshift of the metal lines relative to ly@xmath0  casts serious doubt on the interpretation of non - detections in composite spectra , even at a signal - to - noise ratio well in excess of that of the observations reported here . in any case , this probably explains why the first attempts at stacking qso spectra to search for weak c  iv lines ( e.g. lu 1991 ) underestimated the typical @xmath1(c  iv)/@xmath1(h  i ) ratio subsequently measured with hires spectroscopy .",
    "it is interesting to note in this context that the only case where the stacking method has produced an incontrovertible detection is when barlow & tytler ( 1998 ) co - added _ hst _ fos spectra to detect c  iv associated with ly@xmath0  clouds at low redshift ( @xmath130 ) . at the coarse resolution of the fos spectra  a factor of @xmath131 worse than that of hires data ",
    "the velocity difference between c  iv and ly@xmath0  becomes a secondary effect .",
    "cowie & songaila ( 1998 ) have recently proposed a novel way to look for weak absorption features associated with ly@xmath0  forest lines .",
    "the method involves constructing cumulative distributions of optical depths for all the pixels in a spectrum where ( in this case ) c  iv  @xmath7 absorption may be found , that is all pixels at wavelengths    @xmath132    where @xmath133 is the wavelength of the @xmath102th pixel in the ly@xmath0  forest .",
    "since no c  iv absorption is expected for ly@xmath0  pixels with optical depth @xmath134 , the distribution of corresponding values of @xmath135 provides a reference ` blank ' sample .",
    "one can then examine the _ difference _ between the distribution of @xmath135 for a particular range of @xmath21 values and the blank sample to determine whether a residual signal is present and indeed cowie and songaila ( 1998 ) reported excess c  iv absorption for all ly@xmath0  optical depths , from @xmath136 to 0.5 .",
    "we followed closely the procedure outlined by cowie & songaila ( 1998 ) in applying their method the spectrum of apm  08279 + 5525 .",
    "the results are reproduced in figure 7 , where the left - hand panel shows the distributions of @xmath135 for the same three ranges of @xmath21 considered by cowie & songaila .",
    "the differential distributions relative to the blank sample are shown in the right - hand panel ; here the deficit of pixels with negative values of @xmath135 and the excess of pixels with positive @xmath135 give an ` s wave ' pattern which is indicative of c  iv absorption associated with ly@xmath0  forest lines .",
    "as can be seen from the figure , we confirm the finding by cowie & songaila of a c  iv signal in all three intervals of @xmath21 considered .",
    "it is of interest , of course , to ask how changes in the @xmath1(c  iv)/@xmath1(h  i ) ratio would be reflected in the optical depth distributions shown in figure 7 .",
    "we are in a good position to explore this question having quantified the absorption parameters of the entire ly@xmath0  forest in apm  08279 + 5525 .",
    "to this end , we simulated the c  iv absorption associated with 375 ly@xmath0  lines for which vpfit returned values of @xmath1(h  i ) , @xmath67 , and @xmath62 , and applied cowie and songaila s technique to determine the distributions of @xmath21 and @xmath135 . since the aim is to test whether there is a sudden change in the metallicity of ly@xmath0  clouds at low optical depths , we considered two possibilities :    \\(1 ) @xmath1(c  iv)/@xmath1(h  i)@xmath128 for all values of @xmath1(h",
    "i ) ; and    \\(2 ) a drop in @xmath1(c  iv)/@xmath1(h  i ) by a factor of 10 for @xmath1(h  i)@xmath90 .",
    "we carried out the simulations for two cases which we term ` ideal ' and ` realistic ' . in the ideal case",
    ", we did not include the effects of noise ( that is , we assumed infinitely high s / n ) and we adopted @xmath107 and @xmath137 . in the realistic case , we introduced random noise in the simulations to reproduce the s / n = 80 typical of our hires data . we also assumed @xmath138 and a dispersion of values @xmath139 with @xmath127 as found for ly@xmath0  lines with log  @xmath140 (  5.1 ) .",
    "the results of these simulations are reproduced in figure 8 . since the assumed drop in the @xmath1(c  iv)/@xmath1(h  i ) ratio at @xmath1(h  i)@xmath90 ( case 2 ) would affect primarily pixels with @xmath22(ly@xmath0 )",
    "@xmath141 , for clarity we show the results at low optical depths in two subsets : @xmath142(ly@xmath0 ) @xmath88 and @xmath143(ly@xmath0 ) @xmath144 .",
    "the top panel in figure 8 shows that in the ` ideal ' case the optical depth method developed by cowie and songaila ( 1998 ) would indeed be sensitive to changes in the carbon abundance of ly@xmath0  clouds ( open squares ) . under more realistic conditions ( bottom panel ) , however , the break below @xmath22(ly@xmath0)@xmath145 is softened , primarily by the effect of noise which moves pixels with @xmath143(ly@xmath0 ) @xmath144 into the lower optical depth interval and _ vice versa_. furthermore , at the typical s / n of the present data , the error associated with the lowest @xmath22(c  iv ) bin is so large that the two cases considered ( filled dot and open square ) can no longer be distinguished with confidence . although the data ( open star ) apparently favour a constant @xmath1(c  iv)/@xmath1(h  i )",
    ", we feel that the existence of a break below @xmath22(ly@xmath0)@xmath146 can only be tested reliably with higher s / n observations .",
    "we have presented a high resolution ( @xmath36 6 km s@xmath35 ) and high s / n ( @xmath147 ) spectrum of the ultraluminous bal qso apm  08279 + 5255 obtained with hires on the keck i telescope .",
    "these data , which have a sensitivity to c  iv @xmath148 lines with rest frame equivalent widths as low as @xmath363  m(@xmath149 ) , have been analyzed with a view to reassessing the metallicity of the ly@xmath0  forest at @xmath150 .",
    "our principal results are as follows .    in agreement with previous analyses , we find that approximately 50% of ly@xmath0  clouds with log  @xmath1(h  i)@xmath110 have associated c  iv systems with log  @xmath1(c  iv)@xmath151 ; we deduce a median @xmath1(c  iv)/@xmath1(h  i)@xmath152 .",
    "however , we point out that the criterion previously adopted to identify such ly@xmath0  clouds  a residual flux in the line core @xmath55is an inadequate approximation which can miss a significant proportion of the lines . even though the absorptions are close to saturation , profile fitting methods which simultaneously determine the column density and velocity dispersion of the absorbers are preferable for a clean definition of the sample ( for data of sufficiently high s / n and resolution , such as those presented here ) .    we have stacked the c  iv@xmath7 regions corresponding to 51 ly@xmath0  lines with @xmath112 log  @xmath1(h  i ) @xmath52 but find no detectable signal in the composite spectrum . in order to understand the significance of this null result",
    ", we have performed simulations in which we stack 51 synthetic c  iv@xmath7 lines with absorption parameters resembling as closely as possible those of the lines we are trying to detect .",
    "specifically , each c  ivline to be stacked was assigned values of column density and velocity dispersion scaled directly from those of the corresponding ly@xmath0  line .",
    "these simulations show that we should be able to detect a marginally significant ( @xmath120 ) absorption feature in the co - added spectrum if @xmath1(c  iv)/@xmath1(h  i)@xmath8 , as in clouds with log  @xmath1(h  i ) @xmath50 , _ provided that there is no random difference @xmath129 between the redshifts of c  iv and ly@xmath0 . _    however , when such a difference is introduced in the simulations the co - added signal is effectively washed out to the point where it can no longer be recognized .",
    "this is the case even for a relatively small dispersion of values of @xmath129 ( @xmath153  km s@xmath35 ) which is entirely plausible given the _",
    "observed _ distribution of @xmath129 in the higher column density clouds where c  ivis detected .",
    "we propose that this uncertainty in the exact registration of weak signals is a serious problem which ultimately limits the usefulness of stacking procedures .",
    "we also analysed our data with the pixel - by - pixel optical depth method recently developed by cowie & songaila ( 1998 ) and , in agreement with these authors , we do find a signal indicative of c  iv absorption in ly@xmath0  clouds with optical depths as low as @xmath9 .",
    "however , our simulations show that a higher s / n than achieved up to now is required to detect with confidence even a marked break in the @xmath1(c  iv)/@xmath1(h  i ) ratio below log  @xmath1(h  i)@xmath154 .    we conclude that the question of whether the abundance of carbon in the ly@xmath0  forest is uniform at all column densities has yet to be fully answered .",
    "probably this question is best addressed by pushing the detection limit for c  iv  absorption lines below the limits reached so far .",
    "thanks to the extraordinary luminosity of apm  0827 + 5255 this approach is now feasible with a concerted effort of hires observations .",
    "the authors would like to express their gratitude to both craig foltz and michael rauch for obtaining some of the observations presented in this paper .",
