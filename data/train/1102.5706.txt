    "the cold classical kuiper belt , hereafter cold ckb , is a population of trans - neptunian bodies dynamically defined as having orbits with semimajor axis @xmath10 - 48 au , perihelion distances that are large enough to avoid close encounters to neptune , and low inclinations ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "cold ckb objects ( cold ckbos ) show several properties that distinguish them from other populations in the trans - neptunian region .",
    "specifically , cold ckbos have distinctly red colors ( tegler & romanishin 2000 ) that may have resulted from space weathering of surface ices , such as methanol ( e.g. , schaller 2010 ) , that are stable beyond 30  au .",
    "a large fraction of 100-km - class cold ckbos are binaries with wide separations and similar size components ( noll et al .",
    "2008a , b ) .",
    "these binaries are practically absent in the dynamically hot , resonant and scattered populations .",
    "the albedos of cold ckbos are generally higher than those of the dynamically hot ckbos ( brucker et al .",
    "2009 ) . and finally , the magnitude distribution of cold ckbos is markedly different from those of the hot and scattered populations , in that it shows a steep slope for the large objects : @xmath12 with @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the number of objects per square degree with r magnitude @xmath15 ( fraser et al .",
    "2010 ) .",
    "the magnitude distribution of ckbos shows a roll - over to a shallower slope at magnitudes @xmath16 ( bernstein et al . 2004 , see petit et al .",
    "2008 for a review ) .",
    "this feature is thought to occur due to a genuine change in the slope of the size frequency distribution ( sfd ) , because extreme albedo variations would need to be invoked if the sfd slope were constant over @xmath17 .",
    "using albedo @xmath18 for the cold ckbos ( brucker et al .",
    "2009 ) and @xmath19 ( fuentes et al . 2009 ) , the roll - over radius is @xmath20 km . allowing for uncertainties in @xmath21 and @xmath17 , it is probably safe to assume that @xmath22 km .    for @xmath23 ,",
    "@xmath13 from fraser et al .",
    "( 2010 ) implies @xmath24 with @xmath25 for @xmath0 ( @xmath26 ) . for @xmath27 , @xmath28 - 0.3 from fuentes & holman ( 2008 ) and",
    "fuentes et al .",
    "( 2009 ) implies that @xmath29 - 3 for @xmath1 .",
    "these sfd slope estimates will be used to constrain our model (  3 ) .",
    "note that the shallow sfd slope for @xmath27 is an empirical approximation that fits observations only up to the limiting magnitude @xmath30 ( fuentes et al .",
    "2009 ) or equivalently down to @xmath31 - 20 km , depending on albedo .",
    "the actual sfd can be wavy , just like the sfd of the asteroid belt at these radii ( e.g. , bottke et al . 2005 ) .",
    "indeed , the occultation data from schlichting et al .",
    "( 2009 ) may indicate that the number of @xmath32 m kbos is significantly larger than what would be expected from extrapolating the sfd with @xmath33 from @xmath3 down to @xmath34 m.    the sfd roll - over at @xmath3 may be telling us something important about the formation and evolution of cold ckb .",
    "as first suggested by pan & sari ( 2005 , hereafter ps05 ) , the shallow sfd slope for @xmath1 can be the result of extensive collisional grinding in the cold ckb .",
    "indeed , the sfd slope index below @xmath3 , @xmath35 - 3 , is similar to the slope index expected for a collisionally evolved population that reaches the equilibrium slope ( dohnanyi 1969 , obrien & greenberg 2003 ) .",
    "( dohnanyi 1969 ) applies to a situation in which the object s strength is independent of its size . in the gravity regime of impacts ,",
    "applicable the size range relevant here , the strength increases with size and @xmath36 ( obrien & greenberg 2003 ) . ]",
    "ps05 carried out order - of - magnitude analytic calculations to support their argument .",
    "they used an idealized two - slope sfd with @xmath37 and @xmath38 , and estimated @xmath3 by postulating that bodies of radii @xmath39 are disrupted over 4.5  gy . as presented , their results were meant to apply to the case in which the number of bodies with @xmath0 has not changed over 4.5  gy , and was equal to the number of bodies in the present kb ( but see below ) .",
    "they found that @xmath40 - 50 km , in agreement with observations , with the exact value of @xmath3 mainly depending on the assumed disruption law .",
    "we were unable to reproduce these analytical results with the numerical code described in  2 .",
    "specifically , using ps05 s assumptions , we always obtained the break well below 10  km ( see  3.1 ) . since our code was thoroughly tested , and gives results that are essentially identical to those of other numerical codes ( weidenschilling et al .",
    "1997 , stern & colwell 1997 , kenyon & bromley 2001 , bottke et al .",
    "2005 , fraser 2009 ) , one might wonder why it fails so badly in reproducing the ps05 results . while some unspecified numerical problems , common to all tested codes , can be responsible ,",
    "there are also a few issues with the ps05 calculations that need to be clarified .",
    "ps05 claim that they normalize the population at @xmath3 to be equivalent to kb with @xmath41 bodies larger than 100 km . a thorough reading of the description of their normalization procedure reveals , however , that they mean @xmath42  km rather than diameter @xmath43 km . using this normalization ,",
    "they therefore have @xmath41 bodies with @xmath42 km , which implies @xmath8@xmath44 bodies with @xmath45  km , if @xmath46 km and @xmath38 . for comparison , observations indicate that there should only be 30,000 to 50,000 kbos with @xmath45 km ( jewitt & luu 1995 , trujillo et al .",
    "2001 , fuentes & holman 2008 ) .",
    "ps05 therefore effectively assume a population of @xmath0 bodies that is a factor of @xmath816 larger than the one existing in the kb today .",
    "since , according to ps05 s eq .",
    "( 8) , @xmath3 scales with @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the augmentation factor , we find that @xmath3 should be about a factor of 2.5 lower than what was claimed in ps05 , or @xmath49 - 20 km , if @xmath50 .",
    "the second issue is related to the ps05 s disruption laws . to obtain large values of @xmath3",
    ", they assumed extremely weak disruption laws ( @xmath51 in the notation of their eq .",
    "5 ) , where the specific impact energy needed to catastrophically disrupt and disperse an object of size @xmath5 , @xmath52 , was up to @xmath53 times lower than the one estimated for water ice by benz & asphaug ( 1999 ) ( fig .",
    "[ qstar ] ) .",
    "such extremely weak disruption laws are probably unrealistic . more realistic disruption laws , such as those advocated by stewart & leinhardt ( 2009 ) and leinhardt & stewart ( 2009 ) , are similar to the strongest disruption law considered by ps05 ( @xmath54 in their eq .",
    "5 ) . with these laws , @xmath55 km according to ps05 ( for @xmath50 ) , which is more in line with the results of our numerical code .",
    "we therefore find that either the number of large objects was much larger than the one in the present kb , implying faster initial grinding , or the observed roll - over at @xmath56 - 50 km must be due to something else .",
    "the sfd roll - over can be a signature of the accretional processes that were active during the kbo formation ( see kenyon et al .",
    "2008 and chiang & youdin 2010 for reviews ) .",
    "interestingly , the asteroid belt , thought to have formed by similar processes , also shows a roll - over at @xmath57 km .",
    "given better constraints that we have on the fragmentation processes in the asteroid belt ( e.g. , survival of the vesta s crust , number of asteroid families , etc . )",
    ", it has been established that the roll - over was _ not _ produced by collisional grinding ( bottke et al . 2005 ) . instead",
    ", the asteroid sfd roll - over was likely created by accretional processes , and constrains them in important ways ( morbidelli et al .",
    "the distinction between fragmentation and accretion signatures is more difficult to make in the kuiper belt , where we are lacking good constraints .",
    "the binary kbos can provide an interesting constraint on the amount of collisional grinding in the kuiper belt .",
    "recent observations indicate that @xmath830% of 100-km - class cold ckbos are binaries ( noll et al . 2008a , b ; @xmath580.06 arcsec separation , @xmath592 mag magnitude contrast ) .",
    "the properties of known binary kbos differ markedly from those of the main - belt and near - earth asteroid binaries ( merline et al .",
    "2002 , noll et al .",
    "the 100-km - class binary kbos identified so far are widely separated and their components are similar in size .",
    "these properties defy standard ideas about processes of binary formation involving collisional and rotational disruption , debris re - accretion , and tidal evolution of satellite orbits ( stevenson et al .",
    "they suggest that most binary kbos are remnants from the earliest days of the solar system .",
    "indeed , all models developed so far postulate that binary formation was contemporary to the formation of kbos themselves ( weidenschilling 2002 , goldreich et al .",
    "2002 , funato et al .",
    "2004 , astakhov et al .",
    "2005 , nesvorn et al .",
    "2010 ) .",
    "the survival of binary kbos after their formation is an open problem .",
    "petit & mousis ( 2004 ) estimated that several known binary kbos , such as 1998 ww@xmath60 , 2001 qw@xmath61 and 2000 cf@xmath62 , have lifetimes against collisional unbinding that are much shorter than the age of the solar system .",
    "these estimates were based on the steep sfd adopted by petit & mousis that was extended down to @xmath63 km .",
    "this assumption favors binary disruption , because of the large number of available impactors .",
    "when we update petit & mousis work with the more recent estimates of the sfd in the kuiper belt ( e.g. , @xmath56 - 50 km for cold ckbos ; see discussion above ) , we find that a typical 100-km - class wide binary ckbo is unlikely to be disrupted over the age of the solar system ( @xmath64% probability ) , except if the kb ( or its source population ) was more massive / erosive in the past .    here",
    "we use the observed binary fraction in the cold ckb to determine how it limits the amount of collisional grinding in the kuiper belt .",
    "we make different assumptions on the initial state and history of the cold ckb , and the related populations , and identify cases that lead to the sfd break of cold ckbos at @xmath56 - 50 km .",
    "we then evaluate the survival of binary ckbos in each of these scenarios . if the roll - over at @xmath56 - 50 km was produced by collisional grinding , we find that the binary fraction should show a strong gradient with radius and binary separation , because it is generally easier to dissolve binaries with small components or those with very wide orbits (  3 ) .",
    "the absence of such a gradient would indicate that the roll - over is accretional .",
    "our collisional modeling simulations employ _ boulder _ , a new code capable of simulating the collisional fragmentation of multiple planetesimal populations using a statistical particle - in - the - box approach .",
    "it was constructed along the lines of other published codes ( weidenschilling et al .",

    "petit & mousis ( 2004 ) identified three main processes that can dissolve kbo binaries : ( 1 ) one of the component is hit by a small impactor . while the component survives essentially intact , except for a new crater on its surface , the linear momentum transferred from the impactor imparts a ` kick ' on the velocity vector of the binary orbit .",
    "if the kick is large enough , the component becomes unbound from its companion .",
    "( 2 ) one of the components can be shattered by a large impactor .",
    "the fragments produced the object s breakup are expected to escape on unbound trajectories because the ejection speeds ( @xmath8100 m s@xmath79 ) largely exceed that of the binary orbit ( @xmath81 m s@xmath79 ) .",
    "( 3 ) the binary system has a close gravitational encounter with another kbo .",
    "the tidal gravity of that object can unbind the binary provided that the object is massive enough ( e.g. , stern et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "petit & mousis ( 2004 ) found that mechanism ( 1 ) is by far the most efficient way to dissolve binaries in the present kb .",
    "thus , we focus on modeling ( 1 ) in this work .",
    "mechanism ( 2 ) is also considered , but we find that its effects are negligible compared to ( 1 ) , except if extremely weak ( and probably unrealistic ) disruption laws are adopted .",
    "this result stems from the fact that it is generally easier to dissolve a wide kbo binary orbit by an impact than to physically disrupt a 100-km object .",
    "mechanism ( 3 ) could have been important during the early phases of the kuiper belt evolution provided that the cold ckb overlapped with a population of numerous , very massive kbos .",
    "we do not model ( 3 ) in this work because we do not yet have a detailed understanding of these early stages .",
    "we will assume in the following that small impacts with @xmath88 can be treated as inelastic collisions .",
    "thus , we will ignore any linear momentum that can be potentially carried away by ejected fragments .",
    "in this approximation , and assuming that @xmath89 , where @xmath90 and @xmath91 are the impactor and binary component masses , the velocity vector of the binary orbit , @xmath92 , will change by @xmath93 see delloro & cellino ( 2007 ) for a discussion of the linear momentum transfer for different impact angles , and in the case where the escaping ejecta affect the linear momentum budget .    the binary components are assumed to have equal mass , which should be a good approximation for the real binaries in the cold ckb ( see  1 ) .",
    "this assumption is conservative in the sense that it is generally harder to disrupt a binary with equal - size components than the one in which the secondary is smaller than the primary ( if other parameters are the same ) . by using equal - size binaries we may",

    "the in - situ formation of cold ckbos is also supported by the results of parker & kavelaars ( 2010 ) who showed that some of the widest binaries observed in the cold ckb today would probably not survive scattering encounters with neptune .    to understand the collisional history of cold ckb",

    "on the other hand , kbos can only form if @xmath99 and @xmath125 were much lower ( e.g. , kenyon et al . 2008 and the references therein ) .",
    "this implies that some dynamical processes must have excited @xmath99 and @xmath125 to their present values .",
    "two main possibilities exist . either ( 1 ) the cold ckb was dynamically excited by some primordial process that dates back to kbo formation , or ( 2 ) the excitation was produced by the lhb itself ( see morbidelli et al .",

    "nevertheless , we use fraser s initial sfds as a starting point and consider other options in  3.6 .",
    "figure [ fraser ] illustrates the fraser s case with @xmath162 km , @xmath163 km , @xmath157 , @xmath164 and @xmath161 . as in fraser ( 2009 )",

    "the sfd roll - over occurred at radii that were either too small and too large , respectively , compared to observations .",

    "in addition , slightly larger roll - over radii can be produced with @xmath149 .",
    "we therefore find , in agreement with fraser ( 2009 ) , that a reasonably conservative lower limit on the initial disk s mass is @xmath81 @xmath134 .",
    "the model sfds discussed here share a common trait .",
    "while they bend to a shallow slope at @xmath3 , the slope below @xmath3 is never shallower than @xmath170 and , even in the best cases such as the one shown in fig .",
    "[ fraser]a , just barely matches the observational constraint .",
    "moreover , the shallow sfd segment below @xmath3 generally only extends down to @xmath171 - 20 km , and steepens back to @xmath172 for @xmath173 km ( fig . [ fraser]a ) .",
    "this does not contradict the existing observations because very little is known about kbos with @xmath173 km .",
    "we were unable obtain a case where the final sfd would be uniformly shallow below @xmath3 down to @xmath143 km , except for very large and probably implausible initial masses .",
    "this is therefore clearly not the idealized case considered in ps05 , where it was assumed that the slope below @xmath3 can be approximated by @xmath170 to some very small ( indefinite ) @xmath5 .",
    "our simulations show that the disk mass is reduced by a factor of @xmath810 by collisional grinding .",
    "thus , starting with @xmath81 @xmath134 , the remnant mass just before lhb would be @xmath80.1  @xmath134 .",
    "this is plausible because the lhb modeling in morbidelli et al .",
    "( 2008 ) showed that the population at 40 - 50 au becomes dynamically depleted by a factor of @xmath810 .",
    "the expected final mass of cold ckbos from these order of magnitude considerations is therefore @xmath80.01  @xmath134 , which is in the right ballpark when compared to observations ( e.g. , fuentes & holman 2008 , brucker et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "the initial masses smaller than @xmath81 @xmath134 would imply @xmath174 km , and indicate that the observed break at @xmath175 km was essentially in place before fragmentation processes had begun .",
    "the initial masses larger than @xmath810 @xmath134 are probably implausible , because these large masses would imply @xmath1761 @xmath134 mass before lhb and would require a dynamical depletion factor at lhb in excess of @xmath8100 .",
    "such a large depletion factor is difficult to explain by lhb processes if the cold ckbos formed in situ at 40 - 50 au ( morbidelli et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "we now consider the binary survival .",
    "figure [ fraser]b shows the fraction of binaries surviving the pre - lhb epoch for @xmath177 and fraser s initial sfd shape .",
    "there is a clear trend with the physical size of binary components .",
    "specifically , more than 50% of binaries with radii @xmath45 km survive , while the survival rate for @xmath171 - 20 km is only @xmath80.5% .",
    "this trend is easy to understand because , according to eqs .",
    "( [ a])([i ] ) , smaller binary mass @xmath91 implies larger orbital change .",
    "the trend is reversed for @xmath143 km because of the lack of small impactors with @xmath178  km that could unbind binaries with @xmath179 km ( see fig . [ fraser]a ) .",
    "the behavior of the surviving binary fraction for @xmath143 km is sensitive to the initial sfd .",
    "for example , if @xmath180  km , in which case the dohnanyi s slope is directly attached to the steep sfd slope at large sizes , the survival rate of @xmath143 km binaries more monotonically drops with decreasing @xmath5 ( see  3.6 ) .",
    "we will concentrate on binaries with @xmath181 km in the following discussion , because that s where things can be constrained by the existing observational data .",
    "figure [ corel]a shows the physical parameters of known binaries in the cold ckb ( noll et al .",
    "2008a , grundy et al . 2009 ) .",
    "the radii of primary components range from @xmath830 to @xmath8100 km .",
    "the separations are between @xmath8@xmath182 to @xmath80.2 hill sphere . from eq .",
    "( [ dv ] ) , the survival rate should decrease with separation because @xmath183 , which is larger for larger @xmath98 .",

    "[ corel]a , we therefore consider cases with @xmath184 , 0.01 and 0.1 @xmath185 .",
    "these initial values should cover the interesting range of separations .",
    "considering these cases separately , rather than using some continuous initial distribution of @xmath98 , is the right thing to do , because the real distribution of @xmath98 produced by the formation process is not well understood .",
    "figure [ corel]b shows the surviving binary fraction for these semimajor axis values .",
    "as expected , the wider binaries have lower survival rates than the tighter ones . for example",
    ", @xmath9 km binaries with @xmath186 @xmath185 would be reduced by a factor of @xmath8100 in the fraser s pre - lhb collisional model illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fraser]a , while @xmath9  km binaries with @xmath187 @xmath185 would be reduced by a factor of @xmath810 .",
    "these considerations provide an interesting test on the level of collisional grinding in the cold ckb , because the binary fraction could have been strongly reduced by collisions , especially for @xmath188 km . to pass this test",
    ", any plausible collisional scenario needs to match not only the sfd of cold ckbos , including the roll - over at @xmath56 - 50 km , but also explain how the large fraction of cold ckbos binaries survived , as indicated by observations ( see  4 ) .",
    "before we compare our results to observational data , we test the sensitivity of the binary survival to different assumptions . figures [ endm1 ] and [ endm2 ] illustrate the dependence on the initial sfd . in fig .",
    "[ endm1 ] , we choose to extend the steep slope ( @xmath189 ) from large sizes down to @xmath190  km , and assume that there are no bodies initially with @xmath191 km ( case a ) . in fig .",
    "[ endm2 ] , we impose a break from @xmath189 to @xmath192 at @xmath190 km ( case b ) . in each case , @xmath130 , or equivalently the total initial mass , is set so that the collisional grinding leads to the sfd roll - over at @xmath193 - 50 km .",
    "the population is evolved over @xmath165 my .",
    "the best results were obtained with @xmath194 ( 4 @xmath134 initial mass ) for case a and @xmath177 ( 26 @xmath134 ) for case b. these initial masses grind down to 0.6 and 1 @xmath134 , respectively . while the final distribution obtained in case a matches constraints reasonably well ( fig . [ endm1]a , but see discussion in  3.4 ) , the distribution for @xmath195 km in case b is always steeper than @xmath192 .",
    "interestingly , it is difficult to produce a shallower slope in case b unless we use the initial masses in excess of 100 @xmath134 , which is clearly implausible , or @xmath196 , which would conflict with the published results of impact simulations ( see  3.1 ) .",
    "it thus appears that a rather abrupt change in the _ initial _ sfd slope is needed to produce a shallow slope with @xmath197 - 3 below @xmath3 .",
    "this can be easily understood .",
    "the objects with @xmath5 near the initial slope change are long - lived , because they see a small number of impactors , if the transition is sharp .",
    "thus , they can break larger bodies and create a sharp sfd roll - over at about ten times their radius .",
    "we find that it is easier to fit constraints if the initial break is placed at @xmath179 km , rather than at @xmath198 km , because @xmath179 km objects are long - lived in that case and can disrupt kbos near @xmath3 with our disruption laws ( @xmath199 - 10 ) .",
    "additional dependencies exist on the assumed sfds of fragments produced by the cratering and catastrophic impacts .",
    "we find that catastrophic impacts tend to produce a sharp transition from steep to shallow slope near the largest object in the population that can be disrupted by them .",
    "the cratering impacts , on the other hand , tend to smooth this transition and produce more gentle waves in the sfd .",
    "this may explain some of the subtle differences between our simulations , which tend to produce gentle sfd waves , and those of fraser ( 2009 ) , which show stronger variations of slope for @xmath200 ( e.g. , @xmath201 below the break ) .",
    "the fraction of binaries surviving in case a is within a factor of @xmath82 to that we obtained with the fraser s initial distribution .",
    "interestingly , the binary survival rate is slightly larger in case b , which has larger mass than case a , and should thus lead to more perturbations on binary orbits .",
    "the larger binary survival rate in case b is related to the shorter lifetime of intermediate - size impactors ( @xmath179 km ) in case b , which are disrupted by smaller impactors from the dohnanyi s tail .",
    "these small impactors are nearly absent in case a.      so far we described tests with @xmath114 km s@xmath79 .",
    "it is uncertain whether these assumed impact speeds should apply to the pre - lhb collisions , because the dynamical state of the kuiper belt region at 40 - 50 au could have been very different .",
    "specifically , the dynamical effects during lhb such as , e.g. , passing resonances , could have excited the orbits of cold ckbos . if so , the cold ckbos could have had smaller eccentricities and inclinations than they have now , implying lower collision speeds before the lhb . here",
    "we test cases with @xmath202  km  s@xmath79 .",
    "the results need to be considered with caution , because it is not clear whether our disruption laws (  2.1 ) are applicable with low impact speeds .",
    "figure [ low1 ] illustrates the case with @xmath203 m s@xmath79 . to create the roll - over at @xmath3 with this low collisional speed",
    ", we needed to assume @xmath204 , giving the initial mass of 88 @xmath134 for the case - a initial sfd .",

    "collision speeds @xmath205 m s@xmath79 would require even larger initial masses and dynamical depletion factors that are clearly implausible .",
    "we therefore find that it is difficult to produce the sfd roll - over by collisional grinding with low collisional speeds ( @xmath206 m s@xmath79 ) .",
    "the surviving binary fraction for @xmath203 m s@xmath79 ( fig . [ low1]b ) shows the usual trend with @xmath5 in that the binaries with physically smaller components survive at lower rate than the larger ones . below @xmath171 - 20",
    "km , the surviving binary fraction drops to @xmath59@xmath207",
    ". the results for @xmath208 km are similar to those obtained with @xmath114 km s@xmath79 indicating that the survival of larger binaries is not overly sensitive to the assumption on @xmath76 .",
    "additional tests show that it might be more plausible to create the roll - over at @xmath3 with low @xmath76 , if @xmath209 km ( initial 20 @xmath134 grinds to 5 @xmath134 ) and/or for @xmath149 ( 20 @xmath134 grinds to 2 @xmath134 ) .",
    "the results for binary survival are similar in these two cases . while @xmath210 km generates a slightly stronger gradient with @xmath5 and minimum survivability for @xmath211 km , @xmath149 produces a slightly softer gradient that is similar to that in fig .",

[ fraser ] ) .    while the binaries with @xmath217 km tend to retain the shape of their original distribution , the binary orbits for @xmath188 km become significantly modified .",
    "for example , fig .",
    "[ dsema]a shows that binaries with @xmath218 km and @xmath187 @xmath185 become tighter or looser , producing a wide range of separations with a tail extending to @xmath186 @xmath185 .",

    "[ dsema]a only represents a very small fraction .",
    "figure [ dsema]b shows how the initial gradient of binary fraction with @xmath98 can be modified by collisions . for example , the initial gradient @xmath220 for @xmath212 km binaries , becomes @xmath221 .",

    "on the other hand , the semimajor axis distribution of binaries with @xmath217 km should not have changed much since their formation .",
    "all simulations that we conducted so far showed the following result .",
    "if the parameters were set up so that collisional grinding produced the sfd roll - over of cold ckb at @xmath56 - 50 km , the final binary fraction showed a strong gradient with radius .",
    "therefore , such a gradient , if identified by observations of binary kbos , would be a direct evidence for the extensive collisional grinding in the kuiper belt .",
    "the absence of such a gradient , on the other hand , would indicate that the roll - over is more likely accretional .",
    "figure [ noll ] shows the fraction of binaries in the cold ckb that can be inferred from the existing observations ( noll et al .",
    "2008a , b ) .",
    "the fraction shown here was roughly corrected for the main observational biases .",
    "for example , the secondaries can be more difficult to detect near small primaries due to their intrinsic faintness , and also because physically smaller components are expected to have smaller separations .",
    "we normalized each binary to @xmath222 by scaling its component radii and separation by a factor .",
    "the binaries with normalized separations smaller than 0.032 arcsec , which was the smallest separation detected in the dataset , were removed . in total , only 5 out of 33 binaries were removed by this procedure indicating that the observational bias is not overly important .",
    "the statistical errors shown in fig .",
    "[ noll ] are large , making it difficult to reach definitive conclusions .",
    "still , some interesting features can be pointed out from data .",
    "first of all , the binary fraction for @xmath223 ( @xmath217 km ) seems to be lower than the one for @xmath224 .",
    "since these large binaries would be relatively resistant to collisions during the solar system history , they paucity probably tells us something about the binary formation process .",
    "the fraction of binaries with @xmath224 ( @xmath225 km ) does not show any strong gradient with @xmath226 ( or @xmath5 ) .",
    "instead , the binary fraction is relatively constant and large down to the smallest surveyed objects ( @xmath227 km ) .",
    "in contrast , we found in  3 that the effects of collisional grinding should deplete binaries with @xmath227 km , relative to those with @xmath228 km , by a factor of @xmath810 .",
    "we therefore believe that the existing data are not suggestive of the kind of trends that we would expect to see in a population that experienced strong collisional grinding .",
    "this may indicate that the sfd roll - over in the cold ckb at @xmath56 - 50 km was not produced by disruptive collisions , but was instead already in place when kbos were forming .",
    "better observational statistics will be needed , especially for @xmath229 km , to test this preliminary conclusion .",
    "additional caution needs to be exercised when comparing our collisional model results with observations , if the formation mechanism was capable of producing the binary fraction that strongly varied with @xmath5 .",
    "for example , a relatively constant binary fraction could result from a combination of the formation and evolution effects , if the initial fraction was larger for smaller @xmath5 and was modified by the collisional removal of small binaries . on the other hand ,",
    "it is unlikely that the initial binary fraction was exactly 100% , as assumed here .",
    "if it were lower , our results could be used to place even harder limits on the extent of collisional grinding in kb .    another interesting feature in fig .",
    "[ noll ] is the dip at @xmath230 ( @xmath231 - 70 km ) , where only 2 out of 31 surveyed cold ckbos ( @xmath2326% ) turned out to be binary .",
