    "it is now agreed that , as initially proposed by argon  @xcite , the macroscopic plastic deformation of amorphous solids is the net result of an accumulation of elementary events which are local rearrangements ( `` shear transformations '' or `` flips '' ) of small clusters ( `` zones '' ) of atoms , molecules , or particles .",
    "such a flip should be viewed as an eshelby transformation : since the core cluster is embedded in an elastic medium , its transformation produces a long - ranged elastic field with quadrupolar symmetry .",
    "this has been directly observed in numerical simulations  @xcite and experiments  @xcite .",
    "a flip occurs when a zone ( of size @xmath4 ) reaches instability at some ( local ) strain threshold  @xcite .",
    "it then starts rearranging into a new stable configuration of lower energy ; as described in  @xcite the released energy is evacuated by acoustic radiation into the embedding medium , so that ( i ) the duration of the event is of order @xmath5 , with @xmath6 the shear wave speed ; ( ii ) at a distant point @xmath7 away from a source at the origin , the long - ranged elastic eshelby field  @xcite is established after the acoustic delay @xmath8 .",
    "this perturbation of the strain field may trigger secondary events , hence may lead to flip - flip correlations and avalanche behavior . as",
    "plastic flow progresses , the strain in a given region ( zone ) in the system is therefore ( i ) advected by external loading at the imposed strain rate @xmath2 ; ( ii ) subjected to a set of shifts due to elastic signals sent by ongoing flips occurring at random locations in the rest of the system .",
    "these elastic signals constitute a self - generated _ dynamical noise _ , which carries information about flips and controls the nature of the dynamics .",
    "avalanches were initially evidenced in athermal quasi - static ( aqs ) simulations . in this limit ,",
    "thermal fluctuations vanish and the drive is infinitely slow compared to the duration of plastic events , which hence show up as discontinuous drops on the stress - strain curve . on average ,",
    "each flip releases a macroscopic stress @xmath9 , with @xmath10 the space dimension , @xmath11 the linear size of the system , @xmath12 the shear modulus , and @xmath13 a typical strain scale .",
    "the amplitude of stress drops in aqs simulations is thus a measure of the avalanche size and was found to be strongly system size - dependent  @xcite .",
    "this permits to conclude that under aqs conditions , flips correlate into avalanches .    but",
    "the question then is : to which extent do these correlations survive at finite strain - rates ( @xmath2 ) and temperatures ( @xmath1 ) ? indeed , as soon as @xmath2 is finite , the unfolding of an irreversible event of duration @xmath14 spreads over a finite strain interval @xmath15 .",
    "hence , plastic events can no longer be identified as discontinuities on the stress - strain curve and , more generally , can not be isolated .",
    "information about flip correlations and avalanches can no longer be accessed directly .",
    "numerical simulations performed in the aqs regime , where avalanches have been identified , have also revealed  @xcite a strong ( quasi - linear ) system - size dependence of the transverse diffusion coefficient .",
    "this motivated a further study  @xcite , where two of us showed that this observable could be used to characterize the correlations between relaxation events .",
    "namely , we measured the transverse diffusion coefficient @xmath16 in a 2d system driven at finite strain rate in athermal conditions .",
    "we then proposed a tentative model leading to a prediction of the @xmath2 dependence of the average avalanche size and to a scaling expression for @xmath17 . comparing this prediction with extensive simulations data obtained over a broad range of strain rates and systems sizes",
    ", we concluded to the validity of the model s predictions , namely to the existence , at finite strain rates , of avalanches of average size @xmath18 .",
    "obviously , the next question to be addressed is that of the effect on avalanche dynamics of a finite temperature  @xcite . it has been shown that each flip corresponds to the crossing of a saddle - node bifurcation  @xcite , which occurs after a zone has gradually softened under increasing external loading  @xcite .",
    "thus , near instability , the potential energy landscape ( pel ) presents , along one direction corresponding to the shear transformation pathway , a small , gradually decreasing barrier , which vanishes at threshold .",
    "when thermal activation is at work , a flip can thus occur `` prematurely ''",
    ", i.e. before the zone reaches mechanical instability .",
    "in reference  @xcite , a detailed analysis of the competition between loading and thermal activation led us to propose that , at low temperature , the effect of thermal noise amounts to a rigid downward shift of instability thresholds , while the avalanche dynamics remains unchanged .",
    "this yields a prediction for the macroscopic stress @xmath19 which fits quite nicely numerical results over a broad parameter range , thus bringing indirect evidence for the robustness of avalanche dynamics up to a sizeable fraction of the glass transition temperature @xmath0 .    in the present paper ,",
    "we bring further evidence for this conclusion on the basis of a finite - size analysis of transverse diffusion in a 2-dimensional system sheared at finite temperatures and strain - rates .",
    "we first expound , in the following section , the method already used in  @xcite to relate the transverse diffusion coefficient to correlations between plastic events . our numerical results , reported in section  [ sec : results ] ,",
    "are discussed and interpreted in section  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "in the following we specialize to the case of two - dimensional systems , and assume for simplicity that : ( i ) all flips are identical and characterized by a unique zone size @xmath4 and a typical scale of strain release @xmath13 ; ( ii ) the elastic field associated with any rearrangement can be estimated as the solution of the eshelby problem  @xcite in a homogeneous and isotropic elastic continuum .",
    "we consider the case of a @xmath20 periodic ( lees - edwards ) system submitted to simple shear at an imposed strain rate @xmath2 .",
    "the flow is aligned with the @xmath21 direction . in view of computing a diffusion coefficient resulting from the plastic activity ,",
    "we focus on steady state .",
    "the condition of stationarity imposes that the total plastic strain release compensates on average the elastic strain increase due to external loading : when the system is strained by @xmath22 , since each flip releases a macroscopic strain @xmath23 , the average number of flips occurring in a volume of size @xmath24 is , @xmath25 this relation translates into an average flip rate : @xmath26    in order to qualify self - diffusion , we must characterize the long - time behavior of the displacement fluctuations due to the accumulation of eshelby flips .",
    "the transverse displacement of a particle @xmath27 between times @xmath28 and @xmath29 reads : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the displacement field generated by an eshelby source .",
    "the sum runs over the set of all flips , occurring at points @xmath32 , whose signals are received at point @xmath33 between times @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "we introduce the source density : @xmath34    with the above definitions , we write : @xmath35 thanks to the lees - edwards boundary conditions , the system is translationally invariant . in steady flow , the spatial correlation function of the accumulated sources reduces to a function of @xmath36 , and @xmath37 only : @xmath38 .",
    "whence : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the autocorrelation function of the @xmath41 component of the eshelby displacement field .",
    "athermal simulations on this  @xcite and similar systems  @xcite have systematically shown convergence towards normal diffusive behavior , @xmath42 .",
    "we will see that the same holds at finite temperature . in view of equation  ( [ eqn : convolution ] )",
    ", it implies that at long times , that is for @xmath37 much larger that some @xmath14 characterizing the temporal decorrelation of plastic activity : @xmath43 avalanches are by definition series of correlated flips occurring at distant points .",
    "therefore :    * the smallest @xmath14 for which the above relation holds is the average avalanche duration * the range of @xmath44 is the average avalanche size @xmath45 .",
    "the diffusion coefficient @xmath16 is , finally : @xmath46 the diffusion coefficient is thus determined by flip - flip correlations , but in some intricate way , which does not grant direct access to @xmath47 and @xmath14 . to make further progress",
    ", we must therefore introduce assumptions about how correlated sources are organized in space . in the following we consider two situations : ( i ) completely independent zone flips ; ( ii ) linear avalanches of identical spatial extent @xmath45 , composed of flips of uniform density .",
    "if flips are independent , from  ( [ eqn : deltai ] ) we can directly write : @xmath48 with the space average : @xmath49 .",
    "in this case , the sources are delta correlated , whence ( with the help of  ( [ eqn : convolution ] ) ,  ( [ eqn : cong ] ) , and  ( [ eqn : diffusion : independent ] ) ) : @xmath50    as proposed by  @xcite , we compute the eshelby fields as the far - field response to four point - like forces such as depicted on figure  [ fig : forces ] .",
    "the derivation of relevant formulas is detailed in appendix a.     ( see appendix).,scaledwidth=20.0% ]    the displacement field in an infinite medium produced by a source at the origin is : @xmath51 for @xmath52 the transverse displacement fluctuation due to a single flip can be computed at leading order as : @xmath53 from  ( [ eqn : diffusion : independent ] ) and  ( [ eqn : fluctuation ] ) we then obtain for the diffusion coefficient : @xmath54      numerical observations in 2d systems provide various pieces of information about avalanche topology , via maps of either relative displacements  @xcite or the vorticity field  @xcite in aqs conditions , or the shear strain field in systems sheared at finite strain rate , both at 0  @xcite and finite  @xcite temperature .",
    "they concur to indicate that avalanches form quasi - linear patterns , oriented close to the @xmath21 and @xmath41 axes in the simple shear geometry , i.e. at @xmath55 of the principal axes of the strain tensor .",
    "this is consistent with the quadrupolar structure of the eshelby strain field , which reads , in polar coordinates : @xmath56 that is , the strain shift following a flip at the origin is maximum for target zones located along the @xmath21 and @xmath41 axes .",
    "this motivates us to model avalanches as linear structures of identical extent @xmath45 , composed of flips of uniform linear density @xmath57 , and aligned with equal probabilities along the @xmath21 and @xmath41 axes .",
    "since each avalanche involves @xmath58 flips , the average number of avalanches occurring over an strain interval @xmath59 is : @xmath60 while the avalanche rate is : @xmath61 the particle displacement ( see eq .",
    "( [ eqn : deltai ] ) ) can now be rewritten as a sum over independent avalanches , leading to : @xmath62 where e.g. @xmath63 is the sum of the eshelby fields of the flips composing an avalanche along o@xmath21 : @xmath64\\ ] ] with @xmath65 the unit vector in the @xmath21 direction .",
    "a similar expression holds for @xmath41-avalanches .",
    "we show in the appendix that : @xmath66 where , @xmath67 with @xmath68 the bessel functions .",

    "we are therefore led to attribute the growth of @xmath147 with @xmath1 below cross - over to thermally activated processes which do not contribute , on average , to the relaxation of the shear stress .    in our view , each plastic event strongly reshuffles atoms in its close vicinity , thus bringing the system into a new region of the pel , with a finite density of small energy barriers  @xcite . as thermal relaxation from these `` rejuvenated '' configurations",
    "is constantly reinitialized by steady plastic deformation , it yields a finite contribution to particle diffusion .",
    "our observation that macroscopic stress is insensitive to the occurrence of such extra relaxation events entails that these events are enslaved to the plastic dynamics , i.e. do not feed - back into it .",
    "it also indicates that the small - amplitude ruggedness of the pel is essentially unbiased by the macroscopic stress .    at temperatures such that the diffusion coefficient is non - vanishing in the absence of stress ,",
    "i.e. when thermal noise allows the system to fully explore its pel , thermally activated events are likely to feed back into the flips dynamics itself .",
    "this is when a splay develops on the scaling plot ( see @xmath98 data on fig .",
    "[ fig : collapse ] ) .",
    "+ in summary , the primary outcome of this study is that in a two - dimensional lj sheared system at finite temperatures and strain rates , correlations between elementary plastic events do persist up to the vicinity of the glass transition : they show up as a stronger - than - log size dependence of the diffusion coefficient .",
    "moreover , the collapse of rescaled diffusion data above the cross - over @xmath148 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : collapse ] ) , valid up to the glass transition , leads us to conclude that avalanches are unaffected by temperature in the shear - controlled regime @xmath149 ( see insert of fig .  [",

    "this brings further support to our previous conclusion , based on the analysis of macroscopic rheology , that up to @xmath3 the average avalanche size remains essentially unaffected by temperature .",

    "it is only upon approaching @xmath0 , and for @xmath151@xmath122 , that the effects of mechanical and thermal noise can no longer be unraveled .",
    "it is then likely that , in this regime , thermal noise gradually destroys correlations .",
    "finally , the thermal enhancement of diffusion found at the lower strain rates ( below cross - over on fig .  [ fig : collapse ] ) , can reasonably be assigned to rejuvenation of local configurations due to the plastic activity , which permanently feeds additional thermal relaxation .",
