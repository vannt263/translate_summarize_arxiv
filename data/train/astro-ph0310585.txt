    "active galactic nuclei ( agn ) and nuclear starbursts may severely disrupt the gas phase of galaxies through deposition of a large amount of mechanical energy in the centers of galaxies . as a result , a large - scale galactic wind that encompasses much of the central regions of these galaxies may be created ( e.g. , chevalier & clegg 1985 ; schiano 1985 ) . depending upon the extent of the gaseous halo and its density and upon the wind s mechanical luminosity and duration , the wind may ultimately blow out through the halo and into the intergalactic medium .",
    "the effects of these winds may be far - reaching .",
    "bregman ( 1978 ) has suggested that the hubble sequence can be understood in terms of a galaxy s greater ability to sustain winds with increasing bulge - to - disk ratio .",

    "this widespread circulation of matter and energy between the disks and halos of galaxies may be responsible for the mass - metallicity relation between galaxies .",
    "this paper reviews the observed properties (  2 ) and impact (  3 ) of starburst- and agn - driven winds in both the local and distant universe ; the discussion on starburst - driven winds is largely borrowed from veilleux ( 2003 ) , while new elements on agn outflows are also included .",

    "the impact of galactic winds on the host galaxies and the environment depends sensitively on the size of the `` zone of influence '' of these winds , i.e. the region affected either directly ( e.g. , heating , metals ) or indirectly ( e.g. , ionizing radiation ) by these winds .",
    "but the true extent of galactic winds is often difficult to determine in practice due to the steeply declining density profile of both the wind material and the host ism .",
    "the zone of influence of galactic winds is therefore often estimated using indirect means which rely on a number of assumptions .",

    "another method is to rely on the expected terminal velocity of an adiabatic wind at the measured x - ray temperature @xmath33 [ @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the mean mass per particle ] to provide a lower limit to the velocity of the wind fluid ( this is a lower limit because it only takes into account the thermal energy of this gas and neglects any bulk motion ; e.g. , chevalier & clegg 1985 ; martin 1999 ; heckman et al .",
