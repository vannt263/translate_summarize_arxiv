    "among many other fascinating features , titan , the largest satellite of saturn , hosts lakes and seas @xcite likely filled by liquid hydrocarbons containing some amount of dissolved atmospheric nitrogen and various organic compounds @xcite .",
    "+ in @xcite ( hereafter pap1 ) , the authors only derived a chemical composition for the external surface of titan s putative evaporites .",
    "butane and acetylene were found to be the most likely main components of these external layers , but this result has several restrictions , the most obvious being the lack of information concerning the spatial structure of the evaporitic deposits . indeed , in pap1 , neither vertical stratification nor horizontal variations of composition were considered ; consequently the model can be labelled `` 0-d '' .",
    "the 1-d or 2-d models of evaporitic deposition are of interest as the subsequent structure is potentially observable at the margins of these geological units .",
    "moreover , a future lander could drill into these layers and perform detailed analysis or a titan boat could directly measure dissolved solids with a mass spectrometer @xcite .    in a laboratory study",
    ", @xcite obtained interesting and illustrative result on the evaporitic crystallization process with exotic materials .",
    "after full evaporation of their working fluid ( heptane at room temperature in replacement of methane and/or ethane in cryogenic conditions ) , a `` playa '' composed of the sequence of the four organic compounds initially dissolved in the liquid was left behind .",
    "it should be noticed that some species used as analogs in this experimental approach do not follow the expected behavior based on their respective solubilities .",
    "this could be explained by the specific conditions of the laboratory simulation .",
    "already in both vims and radar data , chemical composition gradients appear to surround lakebeds @xcite .",
    "@xcite observed several separate _",
    "annuli _ following the contour of the partially evaporated lake ontario lacus at titan s south pole .",
    "@xcite tentatively detected organics and nitriles in a ramp along the shore of the same lake , suggesting that sediments and evaporites could coexist around this object .",
    "a model of evaporite layer structure may also shed light on the possible cause of the relatively high radar reflectivity observed in dry lakebeds .",
    "indeed , as noticed by @xcite , this high reflectivity remains unexplained and could be caused by volume scattering if the evaporite layer is at least several centimeter thick or contains subsurface horizons ( see also sect .",
    "[ poss1dstruc ] ) . + as a first step in pap1 , the regular solution theory ( hereafter rst ) was employed to mimic the non - ideal effect in cryogenic solutions .",
    "unfortunately , this approach is clearly limited @xcite .",
    "thus , the model of dissolution has been subtantially improved in this work by the use of the perturbed - chain statistical associating fluid theory ( hereafter pc - saft ) equation of state @xcite which is widely employed in the chemical engineering community .",
    "the pc - saft has been successfully introduced to the study of titan by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "another improvement on the rst approach from pap1 is the derivation of molar volumes of the relevant molecular solids from the properties of their crystal structure .",
    "the influence of the pressure on these volumes is moreover studied using state of the art quantum chemical calculations .",
    "we emphasize that the modified van laar ( mlv ) model developed by @xcite belongs to the rst family and relies , as does our model , on parameters regressed on empirical data .",
    "for the only solid organic considered by @xcite , _",
    "i.e. _ acetylene , we have used the same experimental measurements , namely those published by @xcite .",
    "+ our paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ solubilitymodel ] , we describe our new pc - saft based model , and we give details concerning the properties of the different molecular solids involved .",
    "we also specify the atmospheric model taken into consideration .",
    "[ 1dmodel ] is devoted to results obtained with our 1-d model : for a given initial state ( _ i.e. _ depth of liquid , assumed composition of solutes and solvents ) a possible vertical structure is proposed .",
    "the question of the maximum thickness of evaporite deposited is also addressed . adopting a plausible topography , in sec .",
    "[ 2dmodel ] we compute what could be the species segregation across a lakebed shore .",
    "finally , we discuss our results and conclude in sec .",
    "[ discuss ] and [ concl ] .",
    "although other possible sources are available in the literature , we have chosen to keep the list of studied solutes from the work of @xcite .",
    "this has the advantage of facilitating the comparisons with previous work ( pap1 ) and limits the potential sources of uncertainties which are inevitably multiplied by introducing more species .",
    "however , in the last section of the paper we will discuss the occurrence and the possible role of the compounds not included in our `` standard '' mixture .",
    "although theoretical models @xcite argue in favor of their presence , we are aware that acetylene has not yet been firmly detected at the surface @xcite and that butane has not been observed in the atmosphere . + beside the solvents , considered as a ternary mixture of n@xmath0 , ch@xmath1 and c@xmath0h@xmath2",
    ", we therefore consider a set of six species , listed in table  [ solids ] , which are assumed to be deposited to the surface of titan or extracted from the `` soil '' by cryogenic solvents ( after being previously produced in the atmosphere ) . in photochemical models",
    "@xcite , they reach their temperature of solidification ; therefore it can be hypothetized that they form exotic organic snows .",
    "once they fall to the surface of titan , these six species ( _ i.e. _ hcn , c@xmath3h@xmath4 , c@xmath5h@xmath5 , ch@xmath6cn , co@xmath5 , c@xmath7h@xmath7 ) either remain in the solid state due to local conditions or will be dissolved in cryogenic solvents .",
    "species that have been detected by observations or produced in photochemical models but are never found at temperatures below their freezing point are not considered as potential lake solutes this is the case for ethylene .",
    "the microphysics of the formation of organic snows is ignored , although it could be the subject of interesting research in the future .",
    ".solids assumed to be dissolved in the lake and some of their properties . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ shoreslopes ]",
    "@xcite and @xcite observed evaporite deposits along the periphery of lakebeds .",
    "the signal at 5 @xmath8 m shows a gradient that could be explained by changes in chemical composition and/or thickness of the deposited organic material . on earth",
    ", the combination of drought and increased water demand has produced significant drops in water levels of the well - known reservoirs lake mead and lake powell .",
    "consequently , `` bathtub rings '' have appeared along the shores of these lakes .",
    "these structures , mainly made of calcium carbonate , are observable in pictures taken from space ( see for instance * ? ? ?",
    "* fig . 7 ) . similarly - formed ``",
    "bathtub rings '' around lakes on titan are probably more complex due to the variety and different properties of the organic compounds involved .",
    "consequently , these particular formations could be unique through the solar system .",
    "thus , a better understanding of evaporite formation is desirable . for the sake of simplicity",
    ", we have adopted axisymmetric topography , as sketched out in fig .",
    "[ lakebedscheme ] .",
    "the bottom of the lakebed is represented     schematic cross - section of our idealized lakebed .",
    "we denote @xmath9 the initial liquid depth , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are defined in the text.,width=8 ]    by a disk - shaped flat terrain of radius @xmath10 .",
    "this zone is surrounded by sloping ground that extends between the radii @xmath10 and @xmath12 .",
    "the value @xmath11 corresponds to the area covered by a volume with initial liquid depth @xmath9 .",
    "@xcite have performed bathymetric measurements along a radar track acquired during a nadir - looking altimetry flyby above ligeia mare .",
    "this sea is much larger than the class of lakes we are interested in .",
    "we note , however , that the shallow slope of the seabed revealed by the global bathymetric profile ( see fig . 4 of * ?",
    "* ) generally agrees with the slope scheme we adopt here .",
    "moreover , our results do not depend on the precise slope but rather on the exact shape of the shore terrain . in our baseline scenario ,",
    "continuous evaporation removes liquid from the system while solid compounds are deposited in the bed .",
    "parts of the lakebed deposits that are no longer immersed maintain their structure and composition until the end of the process .",
    "it is implicitly assumed that the kinetics of both precipitation and sedimentation are much faster than the kinetics of evaporation .",
    "parts of the lakebed that are still submerged get covered by a growing layer of solid organics that stratifies gradually . +",
    "the properties and global characteristics of liquids mixing in titan s lakes remain relatively unknown .",
    "different physical processes can contribute to this mixing : vertical convection @xcite , tidal effects or global circulation @xcite . in our approach , we chose to ignore the possible details of this mixing and instead consider two extreme cases : ( 1 ) only an efficient vertical mixing occurs and ( 2 ) a combined horizontal - vertical mixing scheme that ensures chemical homogeneity of the entire lake ( see fig .",
    "[ lakebedscheme ] ) .",
    "+ in case ( 1 ) , the whole quantity of dissolved solutes contained in the initial column of liquid above a given point of the lake is precipitated on the bed following the behavior reported in our 1d model study ( see sec .  [ 1dmodel ] ) .",
    "in such a case , the resulting composition of the evaporite deposition will show an uniform surface composition : only the depth will vary from one point to another .",
    "locally the thickness of evaporite layers scales to the initial height of the local liquid column .",
    "no bathtub ring structures are expected in case ( 1 ) .",
    "thus , observations of a titan lakebed lacking evaporite rings could be understood as the mark of a weakly efficient horizontal mixing in the lake and/or evidence for an unsaturated solution .",
    "+ in case ( 2 ) , the time - dependent compositions and thickness of the deposits are easily computed by fixing the sizes of the lake to typical values , _ i.e. _ @xmath13 km , @xmath14 km ( see for instance fig",
    ". 1 panel c of * ? ? ? * ) and an initial depth of @xmath15 m. this implies a shore slope of @xmath16 , similar to those reported in table  [ shoreslopes ] .",
    "the computation algorithm is divided in two main steps .",
    "first , for the corresponding total volume @xmath17 , our thermodynamic model is employed to estimate the quantities of precipitated matter during each time step .",
    "the resulting outputs are then applied to the chosen particular geometry such that at each timestep , the total amount of over - saturated species is uniformly distributed over the immersed part of the bed .",
    "these operations are repeated until the solvent is exhausted . +",
    "the results are summarized in fig .",
    "[ surfacecompo ] .",
    "the mixture types used for the 1d model are also used here .",
    "the solvents are pure methane ( fig .",
    "[ surfacecompo ] panels ( a ) and ( b ) ) and pure ethane ( fig .  [ surfacecompo ] panels ( c ) and ( d ) ) . for each solvent ,",
    "two initial solutes compositions are considered : either the abundances are scaled to atmospheric precipitation rates ( fig .",
    "[ surfacecompo ] panels ( a ) and ( c ) ) , or the initial mole fractions are all fixed to the smallest saturation value ( fig .",
    "[ surfacecompo ] panels ( b ) and ( d ) ) . unsurprisingly , the surface of the central part of the evaporite deposits , _",
    "i.e. _ that which covers the flat bottom of the basin , has a composition dominated by butane and acetylene .",
    "this behavior is explained , as in the 1d results , by the large solubilities of these two species , which are thus able to remain dissolved until the very late stages of the liquid evaporation . during this last episode",
    ", the liquid stagnates above the bed bottom and the species , that are still dissolved , finally precipitate out .",
    "clearly , this composition is consistent with the abundances of the top layers exhibited by the 1d model ( see fig .",
    "[ struct1d ] ) , although a slight difference is evident in the ethane solvent ( fig .",
    "[ struct1d].c ) where an almost pure butane region is surrounded by an acetylene rich crown . +",
    "the most external parts of the lacustrine basin are covered by a surface made of solid hcn when the solutes initial abundances are scaled to the atmospheric precipitation composition ( see fig .",
    "[ surfacecompo ] panels ( a ) and ( c ) ) . in this scenario ,",
    "the most plausible for an average lake , hydrogen cyanide is the most abundant dissolved compound though it is very poorly soluble . when the initial composition of solutes is uniform ( fig .",
    "[ surfacecompo ] panels ( b ) and ( d ) ) , an external ring is made of either benzene ( when ch@xmath1 is the solvent , fig .",
    "[ surfacecompo].b ) or carbon dioxide ( when c@xmath0h@xmath2 is the solvent , fig .",
    "[ surfacecompo].d ) .",
    "these results indicate that the occurrence of an external hcn - rich ring would likely be caused by large initial content of the solution rather than a pure solubility effect .",
    "we emphasize that although hcn is clearly detected in the atmosphere ( see for instance * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , its solubility in cryogenic solvents remains not well known , and values provided in this work are less reliable than those concerning other species , especially when the model outputs are compared to experimental works ( see sect .",
    "[ modsolub ] ) .",
    "laboratory experiments are needed in order to determine the interaction parameters @xmath18s related to hcn .",
    "+ finally , between the outer portion ( _ i.e. _ @xmath19 km ) and the central area ( _ i.e. _ @xmath20 km ) there lies a transitional zone that exhibits a chemically complex surface .",
    "whatever the initial assumed composition , the resulting surface composition of evaporites appears to be  trimodal \" : a c@xmath1h@xmath4-c@xmath0h@xmath0 central region is bordered by a chemically complex narrow ring which is itself surrounded by an extended region where hcn is the dominant species ( if the adopted atmospheric precipitations are representative of the actual weather conditions in titan s troposphere ) .",
    "these conditions could either bring solutes to the lake directly from atmospheric fallout or wash the surrounding terrains and dissolve pre - existent solids that could cover these areas .",
    "+ we underline that this chemically `` trimodal '' surface composition does not depend on the actual slope of the lacustrine basin shore . indeed , a shore with a more gentle slope will be covered by thinner depositions , but will show more extended `` bathtub rings '' , the aspect ratio being preserved .",
    "narrower rings will be caused by steeper shores , again maintaining the aspect ratio . in terms of deposit thickness",
    ", low slopes correspond to shallow evaporite layers , whereas steep shores will exhibit thick strata .",
    "+ the spectroscopic observation of all species involved in this study , is beyond the capabilities of an instrument like vims .",
    "however , the predicted `` trimodal '' surface composition of evaporite layers could be tentatively detected by vims if the spatial resolution is high enough ( for instance @xmath21 km / pixel ) .",
    "the data spanning ontario lacus evaporite - covered shorelines , analyzed by @xcite , have a high spatial resolution , as good as @xmath22 m / pixel .",
    "these coastal features seem to be  bimodal \" with two distinct zones ( see * ? ? ?",
    "4 ) . after excluding several hypotheses ( freezing , continental shelf , etc . ) , @xcite proposed that the inner ring could be an intertidal zone showing exposed lake - bottom sediments .",
    "the external ring appears to have a low water - ice content , leading @xcite to propose that it consists of fine - grained condensate , resulting of the evaporation of the liquid .",
    "these observations are consistent with our  trimodal \" evaporation deposition . indeed , in the case of ontario lacus",
    ", the liquid could still contain a large amount of solutes since it seems to be rich in ethane @xcite , a much more efficient solvent than methane . in our simulations , the central part of the deposit ( see fig ;  [ surfacecompo ] ) is built up during the last stages of the evaporation , when butane and/or acetylene crystallize .",
    "hence , the distinct two zones observed by @xcite could correspond to two chemically different evaporite deposits :  unit 3 \" ( the most external in barnes _ et al_. denomination ) is perhaps composed of hcn while `` unit 2 '' could be a `` chemically complex '' deposit .",
    "this interpretation is not mutually exclusive with that of an intertidal zone .",
    "+ also using vims data , @xcite have tentatively detected organic species within the rings observed around ontario lacus .",
    "they used the spectral angle mapper technique to compare pixel spectra to the reference spectra of compounds of interest ( c@xmath0h@xmath2 , ch@xmath1 , c@xmath1h@xmath4 , hcn , c@xmath23h@xmath24 , c@xmath0h@xmath0 and c@xmath2h@xmath2 ) .",
    "however , the definitive identification of surface compounds on titan remains a matter of debate given the few opportunities left to see the surface with a reduced atmospheric contribution and an increased signal - to - noise ratio with vims .",
    "+ nonetheless , the infrared data analyzed by @xcite appear to be compatible with the presence of c@xmath1h@xmath4 , c@xmath0h@xmath0 and hcn within the area called `` the ridge '' by the authors ( equivalent to unit 3 of the study of barnes _",
    "et al_. , 2009 ) .",
    "the possible detection of species in liquid state under titan s ground conditions , _",
    "i.e. _ c@xmath0h@xmath2 , ch@xmath1 and c@xmath23h@xmath24 , can be explained by either sediments still soaked in the corresponding liquid or an altimetric profile not as simple as that depicted in fig .",
    "[ lakebedscheme ] . indeed , citing @xcite",
    "; @xcite noted that the `` ridge '' could have a non - uniform elevation ( see also fig . 6 in * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "a lake shore altimetric profile with a changing slope could lead to a solid crystallization sequence within sporadic pools that could exist in the zone .",
    "globally , the findings of @xcite are in agreements with our predictions where c@xmath1h@xmath4 , c@xmath5h@xmath5 and hcn appears to be the most abundant species at evaporites surface . fig .",
    "[ surfacecompo ] shows that c@xmath2h@xmath2 has a very discrete presence in scenarios where the initial compositions are scaled to atmospheric abundances ( panels ( a ) and ( c ) in fig .",
    "[ surfacecompo ] ) .",
    "therefore , the non - detection of benzene can be interpreted as evidence that the composition of the atmospheric precipitation is similar to that computed by @xcite , as proposed in the interpretation of @xcite . however , in their surface mapping of a @xmath25 m spectral feature on titan s surface , @xcite shown that benzene could be present in a circular geological pattern ( see fig .",
    "17.b of their study ) , which they interpreted as a dry lakebed .",
    "unfortunately , this feature has not been imaged by the radar in order to confirm its exact geological nature , and mainly whether it pertains to the class of possible lakebeds or not .",
    "+ our model also predicts evaporite layer thickness . in fig .",
    "[ evaporitedepth ] , we have plotted the total thickness of the evaporite deposition in the scenario where solute abundances are scaled to production rate of solids ( see fig .  [ surfacecompo ] ) and using an ethane solvent . the central plateau is explained by the final deposition of c@xmath1h@xmath4 , in agreement with the results of our 1d models ( fig .",
    "[ struct1d].c ) .",
    "the change in slope observed between @xmath26 km and @xmath27 km is a consequence of the sudden saturation of acetylene ( see fig .",
    "[ surfacecompo].c ) .",
    "[ evaporitedepth ] is typical of the thickness distribution of evaporite deposits after one sequence of dissolution - evaporation . in titan weather conditions ,",
    "successive evaporation and flooding episodes can occur and thus drive thicker deposits via redissolution / precipitation mechanisms similar to those already discussed in sec .",
    "[ maxdepth ] .",
    "throughout this article we have assumed that the main process that removes a solvent is evaporation .",
    "several authors have discussed the possibility of fluids percolation within some porous regolith or terrain @xcite . this process could be efficient only in the case where solid particles would not fill the regolith pores .",
    "a situation where the compounds belonging to the solvent could percolate , leaving behind initially dissolved species , seems particularly unrealistic since the pores would have very specific ( and still unknown ) properties ; in addition , deposited layers at the lake bed would have to remain permeable to solutes , irrespective of its thickness .",
    "nevertheless , we could wonder whether even in case of liquid percolation , the formation of evaporitic deposition could take place .",
    "hence , if the bulk of the liquid , initially lying in a lacustrine depression , flows into a porous geologic formation instead of evaporate ; at the end it will still remain a thin layer of liquid .",
    "the depth of this former layer depends on the wetting properties of the system solid substrate - liquid , namely the surface tensions liquid - vapor and liquid - solid @xcite , which are essentially unknown , although they do exist .",
    "a crude estimation of the possibly resulting depth of the coat of evaporite can be made .",
    "for that purpose , we assume a wetting film of a thickness around @xmath28 mm . table  [ saturationsolub ] provides the thickness equivalent to an initial depth of @xmath29 m of saturated liquid . from these numbers",
    ", one can easily derive the possible thickness of the evaporite layer left after the evaporation of a final wetting film .",
    "one finds a thickness around a few microns , mainly due to butane .",
    "thus , even if the geological substrate is porous , the formation of a fine evaporite layer remains possible .",
    "+ all of our solubilities have been computed assuming a solvent that contains three major species : ch@xmath1 , c@xmath0h@xmath2 and n@xmath0 .",
    "this was clearly a reasonable assumption ; however , it does not account for the potential role of a less abundant player like propane .",
    "although photochemical models predict a relative precipitation rate of c@xmath23h@xmath24 one order of magnitude smaller than that of ethane @xcite , propane could play a role in regions where it would be overabundant compared to its global average concentration .",
    "@xcite , in their analysis of the @xmath30-@xmath8 m window , were not able to exclude the existence for a small amount of propane , butane and high - order alkanes in ontario lacus .",
    "thus , we have calculated the mole fraction at saturation of considered solutes in pure c@xmath23h@xmath24 . unfortunately , among the pc - saft interaction parameters @xmath18 relevant for propane , the only one available is that of the couple ( c@xmath23h@xmath24,c@xmath0h@xmath0 ) ( taken from * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , for others we used @xmath31 ( like in most cases involving c@xmath0h@xmath2 as a solvent ) . in general , for a solute x , adopting @xmath32 for both ( c@xmath0h@xmath2,x ) and ( c@xmath23h@xmath24,x ) , we got a maximum solubility in propane roughtly a factor of @xmath33 higher than in ethane .",
    "this tendency is also found in the case of c@xmath0h@xmath0 where @xmath18 is known .",
    "the only noticeable exception is for co@xmath0 ; for this compound we use the @xmath34 determined for ( c@xmath0h@xmath2,co@xmath0 ) ( see sect .  [ solubilitymodel ] ) , but we have not been able to draw any satisfactory conclusions . in short , the possible presence of some amount of propane could somewhat enhance the solubility of solid organics without changing essentially the formation scheme of evaporites . +",
    "it is difficult to compare our solubility estimations with previous works since the theoretical background ( equilibrium with the atmosphere or not , the use of rst or pc - saft , ... ) , the thermodynamical conditions ( pressure and temperature ) and the exact composition of the solvent and the solutes taken into account vary from one publication to another . for instance @xcite and",
    "@xcite consider simultaneous equilibria of the liquid with solid organics , and the vapor phase of the atmosphere .",
    "@xcite consider a temperature of @xmath35 k while we take @xmath36 k , which is probably more realistic .",
    "in addition @xcite used a version of eq .",
    "( [ eqbase ] ) that is slightly differ from our version , but the term introduced in their equation is questionable ( see our discussion in the [ append ] )",
    ". a summary of solubilities found in previous works can be found in @xcite ( see their table b.5 ) . making a detailed list of the explicit differences in the theoretical assumptions of each published model would not reveal any physical insight great enough to justify such an undertaking .",
    "however , one can notice that they have a significant dependence on free parameters in common .",
    "the values of these parameters are directly determined by adjustement on experimental data , as these are the best numbers currently available .",
    "there is never , however , a guarantee of their validity in the context of titan .",
    "sometimes the values are crudely estimated , like the @xmath37 in the case of the rst , or a default value is adopted as is the case in @xcite and in this work for nitrogen compounds ( the @xmath18 s are taken equal to zero for the nitrogen species ) . in this work , we made a subtantial effort to get an agreement with available experimental data by adjusting free parameters .",
    "this could explain the differences between some previous works @xcite and our results for c@xmath0h@xmath0 , co@xmath0 , and c@xmath2h@xmath2 .",
    "we determined that a disagreement of the order of about a factor of ten remains acceptable .",
    "recently @xcite concentrated their experimental efforts on nitrogen compounds .",
    "as a general trend , they found hcn and ch@xmath23cn less soluble than what we found . nonetheless , the solubility of ch@xmath23cn in pure methane at @xmath35 k ( see their table 4 ) is close to our determination : both are around @xmath38 .",
    "other models provide higher values , _",
    "e.g. _ cosmo - rs estimates around @xmath39 . in the case of hcn , the output of the stevenson _",
    "et al_. s cosmo - rs model is not too far from our value with solubilities of the order of @xmath39@xmath38 .",
    "the implementation of pc - saft by @xcite yields values significantly smaller , with solubilities in the range of @xmath40@xmath41 .",
    "we recall that this could be explained by parameters that are dissimilar between the two models : @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 were directly determined with laboratory data in our work ( see our figure  [ paramhcn ] ) while @xcite used other sources .",
    "more importantly , together with @xcite , we did not find data which allow the determination of the @xmath18 s for hcn and ch@xmath23cn .",
    "as emphasized by @xcite ( see their tables 11 and 12 ) results depend drastically on @xmath18 s ; this problem could only be solved by future theoretical chemistry simulations or experimental measurements . finally ,",
    "the `` global picture '' of the evaporite structure does not seem to depend on the chosen model : very soluble species ( like c@xmath0h@xmath0 and c@xmath1h@xmath4 , which are among the most soluble with an rst or pc - saft approach ) should be predominant at the surface of the central region of the deposit , whereas less solubles like hcn ( all models seem to indicate that nitrogen bearing molecules are poorly soluble ) should lay along the former shoreline .",
    "for instance , estimates of hcn solubility much smaller than ours must reenforce the tendency we found .",
    "+ `` tholins '' , generated in laboratory experiments , have long been proposed as titan s aerosol analogs @xcite .",
    "numerous experimental works show that they are complex combinations of c - n - h molecules , with a molecular weight ranging between @xmath45 to @xmath46 daltons @xcite .",
    "in addition , they have been found to be very poorly soluble in nonpolar solvents @xcite .",
    "tholins are macromalocules much larger than those considered in this study . in the frame of the pc - saft theory ,",
    "the segment number @xmath42 increases with the molecular size , whereas the hard - core segment diameter @xmath43 and the segment - segment interaction energy parameter @xmath47 remain approximately constant .",
    "this behavior can be easily understood : @xmath42 represents the number of `` hard spheres '' that are assumed to compose the molecule in question .",
    "one can check this tendency in table  6 of @xcite , where the ratio @xmath48 ( @xmath49 stands for the molecular weight ) stays around @xmath50 for a collection of polymers . at the same time ,",
    "@xmath43 and @xmath47 keep values around @xmath51  and @xmath52 k respectively . + for a sensivity analysis , we tried increasing progressively the segment number of butane , from its standard value @xmath53 to @xmath54 ( @xmath55 has lead to a non - convergence of pc - saft , due to an unphysical situation ) , leaving @xmath43 and @xmath47 unchanged .",
    "the solubility of butane has been computed in ethane at @xmath36 k , under @xmath56 bar .",
    "we found that the concentration of butane would fall from @xmath57 ( in mole fraction ) to @xmath58 ( in our hypothetical @xmath59 case ) .",
    "in other words the solubility is very sensitive to the value of @xmath42 and decreases by several order of magnitude when @xmath42 is increased by only a few units .",
    "more sophisticated numerical experiments ( _ e.g_. in which @xmath42 is estimated using a group - contribution approach for a complex macromolecule , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) yield a similar conclusion . + as already emphasized in pap1 , the enthalpy of melting that appears in eq .",
    "( [ eqbase ] ) has a strong influence of the resulting solubility .",
    "this enthalpy can be estimated using a group - contribution method ( see for instance * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; the relevant equation proposed in appendix c of @xcite has the following form @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the number of groups ( -ch@xmath23 , -oh , ... ) of type @xmath62 , and the @xmath63 s represent the corresponding contributions to the enthalpy ; they are provided by dedicated tables . for the majority of these groups",
    " first of all ch@xmath23 , ch@xmath0 and ch  the @xmath63 s are positive .",

    ", the authors discussed the case of the most simple molecule of the hydrazine family ; ( identified by * ? ? ? * to be one of the possible components of tholins ) ch@xmath23ch@xmath23n - ch@xmath0 ; and also cyanoacetylene hc@xmath23n .",
    "unfortunately , for both molecules , we were not be able to find in the literature values of even estimations for their pc - saft parameters .",
    "then , we can not , for this moment , improve the solubility estimations computed in pap1 for this particular species .",
    "+ however , titan s atmospheric aerosols that fall on its surface @xcite and that could be similar to tholins have probably a very low solubility .",
    "therefore , a layer of these aerosols may compose the lakebed , and most likely below the layers of butane and acetylene and those of hcn and ch@xmath23cn .",
    "the `` tholins '' might be buried at the bottom of the evaporitic deposition or compose the external part of the bathtub .",
    "+ present knowledge of the titan s surface chemical composition suffers from a lack of data .",
    "@xcite published clues in favor of the presence of the ethane in ontario lacus . in their work ,",
    "@xcite identified benzene but they could not disentangle spectral signature of hc@xmath23n and co@xmath0 while c@xmath0h@xmath0 has not been detected and ch@xmath23cn could explain some spectral features . beyond this , we have to keep in mind that _ in situ _ exploration could bring some surprises : for instance , in their experimental work , @xcite and @xcite have explored the formation of benzene - ethane co - crystals .",
    "moreover , even if the low temperature of the surface disfavors the kinetics of chemical reactions , cosmics - ray particles could penetrate down to the surface @xcite and their energy deposition ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) could speed - up some simple organics processes that could lead to the emergence of unexpected species over geological timescales . in short , molecules taken into account in this work as evaporites are supported by photochemical models , but we can not exclude that future investigations or possible _ in situ _ exploration will reveal chemical surprises . +",
    "as emphasized in pap1 , possible turbidity is a major issue in our context .",
    "the presence of impurities may play a role in the nucleation of precipitating organics providing favorable nucleation sites , and they may also contribute to the deposits left on the ground after evaporation of the liquid .",
    "the authors of pap1 have recalled that the laws of thermodynamics favour the heterogeneous nucleation since the cost in energy is lower in the case of a heterogeneous process compared to a homogeneous one , but @xcite observed , in their experiments , volume precipitation of benzene ( m. malaska , private communication ) suggesting homogeneous precipitation .",
    "this unexpected phenomenon could be explained either by the presence of impurities in the liquid or by a very smooth internal surface of the experimental cell . among our few observational constraints , @xcite , using observation through the @xmath30-@xmath8 m window ,",
    "have noticed that ontario lacus appears to be filled with a liquid free of particles larger than a few micrometers .",
    "in addition , in their study of ligeia mare @xcite have also pointed out that the low attenuation of the radar signal is compatible with a ternary mixture of nitrogen , methane and ethane , excluding , after discussion , the possibility of significant turbidity caused by suspended scatterers . despite this",
    ", the question of turbidity remains an open issue that could be answered by future space missions .",
    "+ in their study of the geographical distribution of evaporite candidates , @xcite noticed a clear lack of @xmath30-@xmath8m - bright material in the south pole district .",
    "this observation can not be explained by water snow falling from the atmosphere since titan s atmosphere is particularly poor in water @xcite .",
    "therefore , @xcite have proposed three possible explanations to this observation : ( 1 ) the evaporites layers could have been buried ; being covered by a cap of aerosols , ( 2 ) the liquid could have percolated to a subsurface reservoir through a porous regolith , or ( 3 ) that there just havent ever been deep , long - lived liquids at the south pole .",
    "however , the explanation offered by aerosols settling appears much more unlikely than percolation , since that implies a probable disappearance of difference between south zones which seems to be water - ice rich , and those consistent with water - ice in vims data . +",
    "two alternative origins of this lack of southward evaporites can be proposed .",
    "first , if organic solutes are mainly produced in the atmosphere , one can imagine the existence of a low production rate above the south polar regions , phenomenon caused by the photochemistry itself and/or by properties of the atmospheric circulation that could disfavor the south pole .",
    "this hypothesis is supported by the asymmetrical distribution of lakes , which could be explained by the insolation asymmetry caused by saturn s system orbital properties @xcite .",
    "second , due to the high concentrations at saturation of potential solutes into ethane ( see table  [ saturationsolub ] ) , this solvent , by running off over the surface , could dissolve and trap almost the entire amount of solid organics that have been fallen from the atmosphere over the south polar region .",
    "the fact that ontario lacus is recognized to be enriched in ethane @xcite strengthens this interpretation .",
    "moreover , the radar very low loss tangent observed in ligeia mare by @xcite , contrasts with the much stronger absorption estimated at ontario lacus @xcite ; this fact could be interpreted as the consequence of the solvation of more absorbing compounds like long chain hydrocarbons , aromatics and nitriles @xcite .",
    "order of magnitude evaluations can be also invoked . for that purpose",
    ", we employed the least - square fit , established by @xcite , that provides the average depth of the earth s @xmath65 largest lakes , as a function of their size .",
    "( _ i.e. _ the square root of their surface area ) . applied to ontario lacus",
    ", this law suggests an average depth of @xmath66 m , for an adopted surface area of @xmath67 km@xmath68 ; finally leading to an approximate total volume of @xmath69 m@xmath70 .",
    "if we assume a content made of pure ethane , this volume corresponds to @xmath71 mol , mole fractions at saturation gathered in table  [ saturationsolub ] allow estimations of maximum quantities of solutes that can be contained in ontario . on another side ,",
    "we have estimated the total quantities of organic solids settled to the regions further south than ontario lacus , which represent a total area of about @xmath72 m@xmath68 ; this , during a period equal to a titan s year .",
    "to do so , we simply have multiplied the rates coming from @xcite , by both the considered area and the chosen period of time .",
    "the results show that the maximum dissolved quantities , allowed by our model , exceed by a factor of @xmath73 the amounts of potential solutes that are assumed to fall from the atmosphere according to photochemistry models .",
    "thanks to cassini radar data , @xcite derived a more realistic average depth for ontario lacus , around ten times lower than our crude estimation .",
    "obviously , even a much shallower lake does not alter our conclusion .",
    "therefore , our scenario , postulating that the south polar regions are currently dominated by liquid ethane that could host the major part of soluble species , appears plausible .",
    "we have developed a new model of dissolution based on the up - to - date theory called pc - saft .",
    "this model takes into account recent laboratory measurements . as a by - product",
    ", we have determined the pc - saft parameters for hcn .",
    "the absence of available interaction parameters @xmath18 for some species , among them hcn , encourages further experimental work on the solubility determinations in cryogenic solvents .",
    "+ with our model , we have also computed the possible vertical structure of evaporite deposits .",
    "these 1-d simulations confirm the result already published in pap1 : butane and acetylene are good candidates for species that could compose the surface of evaporite .",
    "in addition , we found that a couple of compounds could form a thick external layer ; and due to the combination of the existence of two crystallographic phases and of the rather thick layer , this external c@xmath1h@xmath4-c@xmath0h@xmath0 enriched layer could explain the radar brightness of evaporites , if the scale of the produced heterogeneities is similar or larger than the radar wavelength .",
    "we have also shown that the seasonal cycle may offer a mechanism which leads to a growth of evaporite thickness only limited by atmospheric production of organics .",
    "thanks to our solubility calculation , we also suggest that ethane - enriched south pole lake ontario lacus could have trapped a large quantity of solutes , and this would explain at least partially the lack of evaporite in the south polar regions .",
    "+ under realistic conditions , with our 2-d model we confirm the possibility of the formation of `` bathtub rings '' , showing a complex chemical composition . however our model suggests the possible existence of  trimodal bathtub ring compositions when the entire evaporation is completed .",
    "our predictions are in agreement with past observations of ontario lacus by @xcite and @xcite and suggest the need of a future titan s space mission involving a lander , partly focused on the exploration of the lakes shores , where the chemical diversity is clearly high @xcite .",

    "the agreement was not good enough to allow a firm validation of the method .",

    "+ on one hand , measured molar volumes @xmath79 of solids are available ( see table  [ table_molvol ] ) ; on the other hand the molar volume @xmath80 of subcooled liquids can be computed by pc - saft because it is not required to know the helmholtz energy of the corresponding ideal gas .",
    "the vapor pressures @xmath81 are clearly negligible compared to the ambient pressure of @xmath82 bar , in addition solids and liquids have in general a very low compressibility , that way term ( 2 ) in eq .",
    "( [ rigourouseq ] ) is not significantly different from @xmath83 .",
    "then , for the solid species involved in this work , the term ( 1 ) ranges between @xmath84 and @xmath85 , while @xmath86 has values of the order of @xmath87 .",
