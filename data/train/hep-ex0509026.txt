    "e835 has measured the cross section of antiproton - proton annihilation into two pseudoscalar mesons ( @xmath9 ) in the energy region of the @xmath10 .",
    "the final states studied are : @xmath11 a total integrated luminosity of 33  pb@xmath12 has been collected at 17 energy points from 3340  mev to 3470  mev .",
    "the mesons were detected through their decay into two photons .",
    "the cross sections reported here have been corrected for the respective branching ratios  @xcite : @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 .",
    "the analysis of reaction  ( 1 ) has been published in letter format  @xcite . in the present work ,",
    "processes ( 2)-(5 ) are reported for the first time and a more extensive discussion is given of process  ( 1 ) .",
    "more details on the analyses ( 1)-(3 ) can be found in a dissertation  @xcite .",
    "the expression for the angular distribution of @xmath16 , in the vicinity of the @xmath10 resonance , is given in equations  ( [ eq : withampres_aandb ] ) ,  ( [ eq : interferingamp ] )  and  ( [ eq : noninterferingamp ] ) .",
    "the subsequent isotropic decay of each meson into two photons need only to be considered for acceptance determination .",
    "@xmath17 @xmath18 @xmath19 the variable @xmath20 is defined as @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the production polar angle of the two mesons in the center of mass ( cm ) , while @xmath23 is defined as @xmath24 the term @xmath25 is generated from the @xmath26  state with helicity @xmath27 ( helicity-0 ) , where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the proton and antiproton helicities , respectively .",
    "the helicity-0 coefficients and phases of the expansion are @xmath30 and @xmath31 , respectively , while @xmath32 are legendre polynomials .     the first legendre polynomials @xmath33 ( left ) and associated functions @xmath34 ( right ) . ]",
    "the term @xmath35 is generated from the @xmath26  state with helicity @xmath36 ( helicity-1 ) .",
    "the helicity-1 coefficients and phases are @xmath37 and @xmath38 , respectively , while @xmath39 are legendre associate functions @xmath40 with @xmath41 .",
    "the @xmath10 ( @xmath42 ) resonance , parameterized by a breit - wigner amplitude @xmath43 , has been extracted from the @xmath44 term .",
    "both nonresonant terms , @xmath25 and @xmath35 , have a slowly varying ( on the scale of the @xmath10 width , @xmath45  mev ) dependence on @xmath23 and an angular dependence on @xmath20 described by the legendre polynomials . the amplitudes @xmath43 and @xmath25 , from the same helicity-0 initial state add coherently and interfere with each other . the amplitude @xmath46 is added incoherently because it is generated from the helicity-1 initial state and does not interfere with the helicity-0 terms .    equation  ( [ eq : withampres_aandb ] ) can also be written as @xmath47 given the moderate energy dependence of @xmath25 and @xmath46 , equation  ( [ eq : interfterm ] ) shows that at a fixed value of @xmath20 , as @xmath48 varies across the resonance , even a small resonant contribution can generate a significant interference signal superimposed on the continuum . as an example , for a resonant amplitude @xmath49 that is one tenth of the helicity-0 continuum amplitude @xmath50 , the peak contribution to the cross section from the breit - wigner term @xmath51 is only 1% of @xmath52 , while the factor @xmath53 of the interference term of equation  ( [ eq : interfterm ] ) is 20% of @xmath52 .",
    "the factor @xmath54 determines the shape of the interference pattern . a small resonance and a large continuum is a typical experimental condition found when studying charmonium in the process @xmath55 .",
    "the term @xmath56 provides an additional contribution to the cross section , and if @xmath56 is too large compared to the interference term , it may mask the presence of the resonance .",
    "it is quite helpful that the associated legendre functions with @xmath41 , which are the constituents of the amplitude @xmath46 , share a common multiplicative factor @xmath20 which causes them to vanish at @xmath57 ( see figure  [ fig : legendre_p0246 ] ) .",
    "since the polynomials @xmath58 are either squared or multiplied by each other , @xmath56 is suppressed with respect to @xmath52 by @xmath59 at small @xmath20 . to measure the value of the resonant amplitude @xmath49 , it is critical to know the size of both the helicity-0 continuum , with which the resonance is coherent , and the helicity-1 continuum , which is incoherent with the resonance .",
    "the region at small @xmath20 ( i.e. @xmath60 is therefore the natural place to concentrate for the determination of @xmath49 .",
    ".[tab : quantumnumbers ] how the orbital angular momentum @xmath61 and the spin @xmath62 of the @xmath26 in the initial state combine to make different @xmath63 values and the corresponding charmonium resonances .",
    "a @xmath64 indicates whether a pseudoscalar - pseudoscalar ( @xmath65 ) state is accessible .",
    "spectroscopic notation is given for @xmath26 ( @xmath66 ) and @xmath67 ( @xmath68 ) .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the value of the phase @xmath69 between the helicity-0 nonresonant and resonant amplitudes is determined in a restricted angular region at small @xmath20 ( @xmath70 for @xmath6 , @xmath71 for @xmath7 and @xmath72 for @xmath2 ) .",
    "no appreciable energy dependence is seen within the considered regions of @xmath20 .",
    "the phase @xmath69 is responsible for the shape of the interference pattern seen in the cross section and is reasonably well measured .",
    "its specific value is determined by the local combination of several partial waves ( see equation  [ eq : interferingamp ] ) , which largely cancel each other .    in the ratio between @xmath73 of two analyzed channels , the common @xmath74 and",
    "some systematics cancel out .",
    "we obtain @xmath75 the bes experiment has reported the measurement of @xmath76 , which agrees with the 1985 measurement from crystal ball  @xcite .",
    "however , a consistent and more precise determination of this quantity may be computed by using isospin symmetry : @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is taken from @xcite .",
    "this and equation  [ eq : b2pi0_b2eta ] provide @xmath79 where the subscript pdg labels the uncertainty derived from errors listed in  @xcite .",
    "this is in agreement with a measurement @xmath80 reported by bes @xcite , again in agreement with a 1985 measurement from crystal ball @xcite .",
    "in addition to the charmonium results , this work provides fits to the cross sections for three pseudoscalar - pseudoscalar meson states in antiproton - proton annihilations in the energy range @xmath4  mev  @xmath81  mev ( see table  [ tab : coefficients_alt ] ) .",
    "the differential cross section provides insights on the dynamics of these processes at the examined energies .",
    "the differential cross sections as a function of the production angle of the meson pair are shown in figures  [ fig:2pspaper_2pi0_diffcsfit_3stacks ] , [ fig:2pspaper_pi0eta_diffcsfit_3stacks ] and [ fig:2pspaper_2eta_diffcsfit_3groups ] for @xmath6 , @xmath8 and @xmath7 , respectively , and in figure  [ fig:2pspaper_etap_angdis ] for @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "tables with the numerical values for @xmath6 , @xmath8 and @xmath7 can be found in @xcite .",
    "the partial - wave expansion fits described in sections  [ sec:2pi0_cross_section ] ( @xmath6 ) , [ sec : pi0eta_cross_section ] ( @xmath8 ) and [ sec:2eta_cross_section ] ( @xmath7 ) indicate that the size of the angular - momentum contribution decreases rapidly with @xmath82 and only @xmath83  and  @xmath84 are necessary to describe the angular distributions . the statistical resolution for @xmath1 and @xmath2",
    "is limited .",
    "however , their angular distributions are well fitted by an even - power expansion up to @xmath85 , hence are consistent with @xmath86 .    applying the semi - classical relation @xmath87 ( where @xmath88 is the orbital angular momentum of the @xmath26 system , @xmath89 is the impact parameter , and @xmath90 is the initial state center - of - mass momentum ) , it can be inferred that a larger number of partial waves would participate .",
    "this is probably true for other reactions and is known to be true for elastic @xmath26 scattering .",
    "however , the pseudoscalar - pseudoscalar meson states selected here are unlikely to be produced in peripheral impacts , since they require the annihilation of one , two or three valence @xmath91 pairs of the @xmath26 initial state . if only one @xmath91 pair annihilates , the remaining valence quarks of the proton ( @xmath92 ) and antiproton ( @xmath93 ) must separate and rearrange themselves into @xmath94 .",
    "this is unlikely to happen at large impact parameters , where the partons tend to retain their original large longitudinal components of momentum .",
    "an indirect observation of a sharply decreasing trend in the relative contribution of increasing @xmath95 is provided by the exclusive process @xmath96 , which necessarily requires total valence - quark annihilation .",
    "the ratios @xmath97 for the charmonium states that couple to @xmath98 ( @xmath99 , @xmath100 and @xmath101 ) are 5 - 10 times larger than for those that couple to @xmath102 ( the @xmath103 s ) @xcite .",
    "table  [ tab : quantumnumbers ] indicates that only odd values of @xmath95 can produce the @xmath104 of a pseudoscalar meson pair , and each @xmath95 feeds both @xmath105 .",
    "it is then reasonable to expect larger contributions from the partial waves with @xmath44  and  2 as compared to @xmath106 as observed in table  [ tab : coefficients_alt ] .",
    "it may also be noticed that the estimated differences of phase between amplitudes with the same helicity are relatively small .",
    "e835 has studied the formation of the @xmath10 state of charmonium in antiproton - proton annihilation and its subsequent decay into pseudoscalar - pseudoscalar mesons . in the @xmath6 and @xmath7 channels ,",
    "an interference - enhanced pattern is evident in a cross section dominated by the nonresonant production of pairs of pseudoscalar mesons .",
    "the choice of performing this study on the @xmath10  resonance is a consequence of the @xmath107 quantum numbers of the @xmath10 , which allows it to decay into a pseudoscalar meson pair .",
    "the primary goal of e835 was the determination of the resonance parameters through the study of the process @xmath108",
    ", @xmath109 to complete the program of studying the @xmath103 triplet initiated by e760 .",
    "thanks to the antiproton source developments mentioned in the introduction , a large integratged luminosity was collected in the @xmath10  region in the year 2000 run of e835 .",
    "the presence of a large nonresonant continuum cross section for the final @xmath6 and @xmath7 states , as compared to the resonant production through a charmonium intermediary state , was known at the outset . however , the awareness that the interference mechanism would produce an enhanced interference pattern in the cross section , hopefully large enough to be detected , was a strong motivation to pursue the analysis .",
    "of course , the physics behind the interference mechanism was well known prior to this work .",
    "what is innovative is the exploitation of such a mechanism to detect and measure a resonant signal that would , if the interference could be turned off , be almost two orders of magnitude smaller than the nonresonant cross section .",
    "several other measurements of interference patterns exist in particle physics and many in nuclear physics , but the usual experience is with a larger resonance amplitude and a smaller interfering continuum .",
    "this specific analysis requires the correct separation of the two different continuum components , one interfering and the other not interfering with the resonance .",
    "the effectiveness of this analysis has been demonstrated .",
    "a reason for pursuing this study was the search for alternative means of discovering and measuring charmonium states and possible hadromolecular states .",
    "now that confidence has been gained that measurements of resonances can be accomplished in hadronic decay channels where the nonresonant production of the final state dominates , new strategies can be considered .",
    "for example , other than the above mentioned search for hadromolecules , the study of the poorly known charmonium singlet states could be performed by investigating hadronic final states , relying on the enhancement provided by the interference .",
