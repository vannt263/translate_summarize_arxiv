    "hoag - type galaxies are typically characterized by a red core surrounded by a nearly perfect ring of blue stars .",
    "this class of peculiar objects are named after the prototype `` hoag s object '' first reported by hoag ( 1950 ) . however , most of these objects differ in some distinct way from hoag s object and none has a perfectly round core in its centre ( schweizer et al .",
    "1987 ; wakamatsu 1990 ) .",
    "the mechanism that formed the ring in hoag s object was debated in the past ( brosch 1985 , schweizer et al .",
    "1987 ) , and is not yet fully understood .",
    "an exhaustive discussion of galactic rings that includes a variety of ringed objects , also of hoag - type galaxies , was presented by buta & combes ( 1996 ) .",
    "the authors argued that most rings are not the results of galaxy interactions or of gas accretion , but are produced by resonances in the discs .",
    "they showed that due to long - term secular evolution bars or oval perturbations can rearrange gas into rings near resonances and induce repeated episodes of star formation .",
    "the hypothesis that the ring in hoag s object was formed in a disc at a time when a bar was present and later dissolved was first put forward by brosch ( 1985 ) . indeed",
    ", most hoag - type galaxies show elongated cores with discy features , and probably represent an evolved phase of barred early - type galaxies where the bar has almost completely dissolved ( e.g. , ngc 6028 in wakamatsu 1990 )",
    ". however , hoag s object itself appears as a pure round spheroid with no trace of a disc .",
    "this argues against an interpretation of the ring as a formerly barred disc and in favour of an externally generated secondary feature .",
    "rings can be formed by a small galaxy passing through a larger one as a `` collisional ring galaxy '' such as the well - known cartwheel galaxy ( lynds & toomre 1976 ; appleton & struck - marcell 1996 ) .",
    "however , the central spheroid and the ring of hoag s object are at rest relative to each other and seem to form one single object ( schweizer et al .",
    "1987 ) . a small fraction of ring galaxies are believed to be formed by more gentle interactions such as matter accretion from a gas - rich companion or minor mergers ( buta & combes 1996 ; reshetnikov & sotnikova 1997 ) .",
    "in such a scenario a polar ring galaxy ( prg ) might be formed if the host galaxy , typically an s0 , exhibits an outer ring of stars and interstellar matter that rotates in a plane highly inclined to the central stellar body ( whitmore et al .",
    "an extensive catalog of prgs compiled by whitmore et al .",
    "( 1990 ) includes hoag s object as a likely prg candidate .",
    "alternatively , theoretical simulations showed that accretion of cold gas infalling along filamentary structures in the intergalactic medium ( igm ) can produce rings around galaxies ( macci , moore & stadel 2006 ) .    in this paper",

    "; schaye 2004 ) , an analysis of very large telescope ( vla ) data shows that the column density of the hi gas is higher where the luminous ring lies , reaching a maximum of @xmath186.8@xmath24 pc@xmath23 ( dowell 2010 ; dowell et al .",

    "the hi disc appears to be well - organized and does not show any significant signs of an interaction such as tidal tails .",

    "the fraction of all galaxies that resemble hoag s object was estimated by schweizer et al .",
    "( 1987 ) as @xmath17 10@xmath27 .",
    "wakamatsu ( 1990 ) examined a list of 12 hoag - type objects , including those reported by schweizer et al .",
    "( 1987 ) , and found that their cores are elongated at least as much as e1 galaxies , in contrast with the perfectly round core in the centre of hoag s object .",
    "the author therefore concluded that at least most of these objects could be better classified as early - type barred galaxies with outer rings . in particular , wakamatsu focused on ngc 6028 ( @xmath28 km s@xmath8 ) as `` the best object for a detailed study of its structure '' and concluded that the core probably consists of a weak bar embedded in the lens system . unfortunately , the figures presented by wakamatsu do not allow a detailed comparison of the cores of ugc 4599 and ngc 6028 .",
    "based on archival sdss images and following the technique described in section [ s : photometry ] we produce a residual image of ngc 6028 and present it in fig .",
    "[ fig : ngc6028 ] along with its derived geometrical properties . unlike ugc 4599",
    ", the residual image of ngc 6028 clearly illustrates the presence of an inner structure .",
    "a comparison of the photometric properties and nuclear spectra of hoag s object with those of ugc 4599 based on sdss data is presented in tables [ t : colours_ugc4599 ] and [ t : spectra ] .",
    "the light profiles of the cores in ugc 4599 and hoag s object follow very well the `` @xmath4 '' law with minor deviations of @xmath170.1 mag and with similar half - light radius . however , the blue absolute magnitude of the core and surrounding ring in ugc 4599 are fainter by more than 2 mag than the values derived for hoag s object .    although ugc 4599 is not part of the wakamatsu ( 1990 ) compilation and it is significantly fainter than hoag s object and other hoag - type objects , it bears an amazing resemblance to hoag s object , at least in its morphological appearance .",
    "a close examination of the sdss images reveals that the rings of hoag s object and ugc 4599 do not form perfect circles and do not seem to match the structure of outer rings in barred galaxies ( athanassoula & bosma 1985 ) .",
    "this singles out ugc 4599 as the closest known hoags - type galaxy , which emphasizes the importance of its study .",
    "a kinematical follow - up study of early - type galaxies surrounded by inclined rings or discs reveals that the stellar and kinematic axes are frequently decoupled . while our data can not verify that ugc 4599 has two perpendicular kinematical subsystems , the detection of an extended hi component and the presence of a luminous ring make ugc 4599 a good prg candidate .",
    "however , there are only few known prgs which resemble ugc 4599 . in fact , face - on polar rings with a hoag - like structure were rarely discovered , despite a dedicated search ( see taniguchi , shibata and wakamatsu 1986 ) , implying that ellipticals having by definition round bulges and almost circular rings as hoag s object are exceedingly rare .    known ellipticals with polar rings ( e.g. , am 2020 - 504 , ic 2006 and ngc 5266 ) also follow well the `` @xmath4 '' for a large range of magnitudes and contain a massive hi component ( arnaboldi et al .",
    "1993 ; iodice et al .",
    "the central core typically consists of an old stellar population and appears as a pure spheroidal , in contrast with the younger cores in most other prgs which show some discy structure ( e.g. , iodice et al .",
    "2002 ) . however , the elliptical host galaxies are somewhat brighter than the core of ugc 4599 , and their surrounding stellar rings show considerably different intrinsic properties .",
    "the variation of the pa along the core implies that the axes of the isophotal contours rotate .",
    "inner isophotal twists are common in elliptical galaxies and are often discussed in the context of their intrinsic shape ( merritt 1992 ) .",
    "triaxial structures with varying ellipticity and no intrinsic variation of isophotal pa can produce a twist if observed at an oblique view .",
    "similarly , hidden triaxial sub - structure such as bars or lenses can explain the isophotal twisting in galaxies mis - classified as ellipticals ( galletta 1980 ; nieto et al .",
    "the presence of disc - like sub - structures can also explain the deviation from the `` @xmath4 '' law luminosity profile observed in ellipticals with strong isophotal twists ( fasano & bonoli 1989 ) .",
    "strong isophote twists in bulges due to the presence of bars are typically followed by a local maximum in ellipticity as demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : ngc6028 ] for the case of ngc 6028 ( see also rest et al .",
    "2001 ) . in ugc 4599",
    "the ellipticity drops to zero where the sharp transition in pa occurs which , together with our failure to detect a bar in the sdss images of ugc 4599 , imply that the presumed inner sub - structure has a discy shape .",
    "isophotal twisting often correlates with a minima in ellipticity in merger remnants ( see fig . 1 in rothberg & joseph 2004 ) .",
    "this behaviour is believed to be related to the presence of a stellar disc which formed in a post - starburst after the interaction .",
    "this scenario is supported by the observational evidence that the photometric central sub - structures in some ellipticals are kinematically decoupled ( nieto et al .",
    "note , however , that angularly large isophotal twists alone can not argue for a particular formation mechanism ( lauer et al .",
    "2005 ) and that kinematical decoupling is not preferentially associated with large isophotal twists ( bournaud et al .",
    "measuring the stellar kinematics along the photometric axes is therefore required to accurately determine the shape of the core .",
    "this will help examine whether the smooth contour rotation along the core is due to an intrinsic misalignment or is merely a projection effect , and might provide important clues for the formation of the object .",
    "the significant hi content of ugc 4599 is not unusual for early - type galaxies ( sadler , oosterloo & morganti 2002 ; emonts et al .  2006 ; morganti et al .",
    "2006 ; serra et al .",
    "in particular , the structure of the hi disc relates ugc 4599 to a subclass of hi - rich early - type galaxies which show very large regular discs ( up to 200 kpc ) of low column density hi with masses up to @xmath29 ( barnes et al .",
    "2001 ; oosterloo et al .  2007 ) .",
    "considering the stability of the hi discs and the suppression of star formation activity these systems are expected to evolve very slowly for a very long period of time ( oosterloo et al .",
    "these physical conditions might be related with the relatively large specific angular momentum characterizing this class of galaxies ( dalcanton et al .",
    "1997 ; jimenez et al .  1997 ; berta et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "the morphology and the velocity structure of the gaseous discs can further constrain the age of such systems .",
    "the light profile of ugc 4599 shows that the ellipticity and pa of the isophotes vary slowly with radius at the faintest measurable level between the core and the ring as they tend smoothly toward the values observed in the outer tilted ring .",
    "this suggests that the body and ring of ugc 4599 have nearly reached an equilibrium configuration .",
    "furthermore , the regularity of the entire hi disc suggests that the gas completed at least 1 - 2 orbits all the way to the outer regions .",
    "ugc 4599 is a nearly round object viewed almost face - on and it is therefore difficult to determine the rotational velocity based on the measured radial velocity of the gaseous component . adopting a flat curve with rotational velocity of @xmath18250 km s@xmath8",
    ", we calculate a rotational period of @xmath182.5 gyr at 100 kpc radius .",
    "it is therefore reasonable to assume that the hi disc is well over 5 gyr and could not have formed long after the host galaxy .",
    "in this section we attempt to derive the origin and evolution of ugc 4599 in light of the data presented above .",
    "we present and discuss different scenarios for the formation of the peculiar structure of the galaxy .",
    "following brosch ( 1985 ) we consider the hypothesis that ugc 4599 is a barred early - type galaxy whose disc went through an extreme bar instability in the last few gyr ago .",
    "slow galaxy evolution can account for the presence of true detached axisymmetric outer rings in early - type galaxies ( buta & combes 1996 ) .",
    "early galaxy evolution , secular evolution and bar development can also give rise quite easily to a bulge - like or pseudo - bulge structure in any galaxy environment ( combes et al .",
    "1990 ; raha et al .",
    "1991 ; norman , sellwood & hasan 1996 ; combes 2009 ) , although reproducing round pseudo - bulges inside low - inclination galaxies might be problematic ( debattista et al .",
    "if bars weaken and are destroyed , then the hoag - type ngc 6028 galaxy should represent an intermediate phase between barred early - type galaxies and the most evolved phase where the bar has completely dissolved , as might be the case also for ugc 4599 and hoag s object .",
    "pseudo - bulges are expected to retain a memory of their discy origin , which should help differentiate them from classical bulges ( kormendy & kennicutt 2004 ) .",
    "they have disc - like features and are typically relatively flattened , as suggested by their low srsic index of @xmath30 ( laurikainen et al .",
    "2007 ; fisher & drori 2008 ) .",
    "the core of ugc 4599 shows no inner bar nor spiral structure and is well - fitted by an `` @xmath31''-law with a srsic index of @xmath32 , which justifies the `` @xmath4''-law approximation adopted in section [ s : analysis ] .",
    "this supports the morphological classification of ugc 4599 as a true spheroid surrounded by a detached ring .",
    "the above discussion is based on the widely - accepted notion that bars are produced by a global instability in rotationally - supported stellar discs , while in many barred s0 galaxies the bulges are significantly more massive than the discs .",
    "it is therefore worthwhile to consider an alternative scenario in which bars are formed without discs .",
    "such a scenario implies that hoag - type objects with oval cores and outer rings would be a distinct type of barred early - type galaxies with no apparent discs ( see also gadotti & de souze 2003 ) .",
    "transient `` cartwheel''-like rings are known to form in high - speed head - on collisions between disc galaxies ( see appleton & struck - marcell 1996 for a review ; bekki 1997 ) . in this collisional ring scenario , a density wave propagates outward from the centre while locally compressing the gas and inducing subsequent starbursts that form a luminous ring .",
    "if ugc 4599 collided with a small companion @xmath335 gyr ago , the density wave have to be moving at @xmath181 km s@xmath8 to trigger the star formation taking place in the ring today .",
    "this is well below the @xmath18100 km s@xmath8 value found for the well - known cartwheel galaxy ( vorobyov & bizyaev 2003 ) .",
    "furthermore , the spiral - like structure of the ring is difficult to explain if stars formed as a result of a circular density wave propagating through the hi disc . as in hoag",
    "s object , the systematic velocity of the ring of ugc 4599 , determined from the hi profile , agrees well with that of the core .",
    "if the core is part of the colliding system , then we must be observing it exactly at its furthest distance from the target where it has zero velocity relative to the collisional ring ( appleton & struck - marcell 1996 ) .",
    "this configuration can be ruled out since the photometric properties of the core and ring strongly indicate that the system has nearly settled in equilibrium .",
    "we therefore conclude that the collisional ring scenario is highly unlikely for genuine hoag - type galaxies ( see also schweizer et al .",
    "1987 ) .",
    "schweizer et al .  ( 1987 ) proposed that the formation of hoag s object involved a mass transfer or minor merger which they referred to as a `` major accretion event '' .",
    "the blue colours of the ring and the absence of merging signatures led the authors to conclude that the accretion event took place at least 2 - 3 gyr ago .",
    "the hoag - like structure of ugc 4599 , together with our failure to detect any tidal tail , shells or ripple signature brighter than @xmath3425 mag arcsec@xmath23 , imply that this galaxy could have undergone a similar evolution .",
    "such a `` secondary event '' in the evolution of a galaxy is related with the formation of highly inclined rings around prgs ( bekki 1997 , 1998 ; bournaud & combes 2003 ) .",
    "however , since a dynamical study is required to test whether ugc 4599 is indeed a prg , the discussion below will make no assumption on the relative orientation of the rotation axes of the core and the ring .",
    "the presence of the hi disc in low - luminosity early - type galaxies is generally associated with the presence of an intermediate ( @xmath182 gyr ) population of stars , optical fine structures and/or kinematical features which fit well the picture of a recent or on - going accretion ( sadler , oosterloo & morganti 2002 ) . in such encounters the total amount of gas transferred to the early - type object",
    "is roughly 10% of the gas in the accreted spiral , i.e. , up to @xmath35 ( reshetnikov & sotnikova 1997 ) .",
    "however , the high hi content ( @xmath1810@xmath36 ) detected in ugc 4599 is comparable with the entire gas content of a large spiral galaxy , and is one order of magnitude larger than the typical hi content of dwarf irregular galaxies ( matthews , galagher & littleton 1993 ; matthews & gallagher 1996 ) .",
    "if an accreted galaxy actually collided with the pre - existing early - type galaxy in forming ugc 4599 , some material should have fallen into the central part of the main galaxy , generated stars and formed a central structure .",
    "this can account for the low - level nuclear activity and the inner sharp isophotal twist in ugc 4599 .",
    "deep optical observations might reveal also low - luminosity tidal features indicative of a recent merger event in the outskirts of ugc 4599 ( see e.g. , tal et al .",
    "2009 ; finkelman et al .",
    "however , given the colours of the core and the structure and size of the hi disc , ugc 4599 formed more than 5 gyr ago and is not related to a recent accretion or minor merger event but to a much earlier formation phase ( see section [ extended_hi ] ; oosterloo et al .",
    "the growth of the hi disc by multiple minor mergers is also not likely to occur .",
    "although repeated minor mergers can gradually transform a disc into an elliptical - like galaxy ( bournaud , jog & combes 2007 ) , the low - density environment of ugc 4599 and the appearance of the hi disc are not consistent with this picture .",
    "simulations demonstrate that disc galaxies mergers can form early - type systems ( e.g. , toomre & toomre 1972 ; toomre 1977 ; barnes & hernquist 1996 , barnes 2002 ; bournaud , jog & combes 2005 ; di matteo et al .",
    "hi - poor systems are believed to be formed when most of the gas loses its angular momentum , subsequently falling towards the centre of the merging system and triggering massive star formation .",
    "on the other hand , extended hi components observed in early - type galaxies can result from a late - infall of high - angular - momentum gas into a dilute disc in a gas - rich merging system ( barnes 2002 , oosterloo et al .  2007 ; serra et al .  2008 and",
    "references therein ) .",
    "a merger of two hi - rich disc galaxies in the past could have led to the formation of an elliptical galaxy with a massive and regularly extended hi component such as ugc 4599 ( see emonts et al .",
    "2006 ; serra et al .",
    "the blue colours of the ring can then be explained by low - level star formation occurring along the hi disc since it settled into its relaxed structure . to form ugc 4599",
    "the original galaxies must have been unusually gas - rich , but with low optical luminosity considering the high mass - to - light ratio of ugc 4599 and taking into account that some of the gas was presumably dispersed or converted into stars during the collision ( sparke & cox 2000 ; barnes 2002 ) .",
    "such an event is plausible considering that the environment of ugc 4599 is relatively hi - rich ; all ugc 4599 neighbours are low - luminosity disc galaxies currently forming stars that contain @xmath37 of hi per galaxy .",
    "an alternative hypothesis suggests that `` cold '' accretion from the igm might play a major role in the formation of extended hi structures around early - type galaxies ( schneider et al .",
    "1989 ; binney 2004 ; kere et al .",
    "2005 ; oosterloo et al .  2007 ) .",
    "although lacking a solid observational ground ( e.g. , serra et al .  2008 ; steidel et al .",
    "2010 ; heald et al .",
    "2010 and references therein ) , such a mechanism could provide the supply of atomic gas necessary to build the hi disc in ugc 4599 without requiring galaxy - galaxy interactions , and can also form polar rings ( macci et al .",
    "in this view , the host galaxy formed first and accreted material from its hi - rich surrounding over time during its evolution .",
    "the host galaxy could be formed either by a relatively dry major merger or in a single , short and highly efficient star formation burst ( eggen et al .",
    "1962 ; larson 1974 ) .",
    "the amount of cold gas accreted depends on the halo mass of the galaxy , which can be estimated from its velocity curve . adopting a rotational velocity of @xmath18250 km s@xmath8 for the hi disc ,",
    "we obtain a halo mass @xmath38 for ugc 4599 .",
    "serra et al .  ( 2006 ) used the kere et al .",
    "( 2005 ) model to estimate the time for accreting @xmath1810@xmath36 of hi from the igm on a halo mass of @xmath39 .",
    "the authors concluded that such a halo would accumulate most of the gas at high redshifts , implying that most of it has been in place for the last @xmath186 gyr .",
    "this result is consistent with the age estimation of the central core and the hi disc in ugc 4599 and implies that no major encounters more recent than this time could have occurred .",
    "gas accretion onto a bulge or spheroidal is more likely to produce an s0 galaxy , rather than an elliptical - like galaxy such as ugc 4599 ( macci",
    "et al .  2006 ) .",
    "however , we note that several early - type galaxies with extended hi discs show a very faint optical disc which might be related with giant low surface brightness galaxies such as malin 1 ( impey & bothum 1989 )",
    ". the sdss images of ugc 4599 are probably too faint to detect the presence of an outer disc , although the aalp presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : ugc4599_light_profile ] might be interpreted otherwise .",
    "such a scenario would also have to explain how ugc 4599 , which is clearly not isolated , has significantly larger amounts of hi than its close neighbours within a 2 mpc distance .    to conclude",
    ", we can not determine with confidence which scenario , major merger or gas accretion from the igm , is more likely responsible for forming the hi disc in ugc 4599 based on the data presented in this paper .",
    "we can not also entirely rule out that at least some of the gas was accreted on ugc 4599 from gas - rich dwarf galaxies .",
    "evidence for that is given by the detection of hi emission in the region connecting ugc 4599 and the small companion cgcg 061 - 011 .",
    "a more detailed stellar population analysis can help to distinguish between the different formation scenarios by searching for variations or differences in the metallicity and age of the stellar population along the core and the ring ( see e.g.  oosterloo et al .",
    "an intrinsic metallicity gradient , as implied by the @xmath15 blue gradient along the core of ugc 4599 , is expected to be relatively shallow in galaxies which undergone a major merger , while the classical formation models of monolithic collapse predict very steep metallicity gradients ( snchez - blzquez et al .",
    "2006 ; spolaor et al .",
    "2009 and references therein ) .",
    "furthermore , quiescent gas accretion onto an elliptical galaxy is also expected to produce steep colour gradients ( kobayashi 2004 ) .",
    "measuring high metallicity would imply that the stellar population of the core formed from gas that belonged to the interstellar medium of a disc galaxy rather than accreted from the igm ( serra et al .",
    "testing the presence of kinematically decoupled components in ugc 4599 would provide further clues on the formation and evolution of this galaxy .",
    "the delayed infall of primordial or intergalactic gas could have dissipated energy through collisions and lost angular momentum until eventually settling into stable orbits and forming an outer disc , rather than flowing rapidly into the central body ( schwarz 1981 ; pearce & thomas 1991 ) .",
    "if the oval core of ugc 4599 is not the remnant of a dissolved bar , it might be linked with a weakly non - spherical potential which can continuously generate spiral waves in the extended disc , depending on the mass and the kinematical properties of the dark matter halo ( buta & combes 1996 ; rautiainen & salo 2000 ; bekki & freeman 2002 ; tutukov & fedorova 2006 ) .",
    "a ring might then form due the twisting of the spiral arms by the differential rotation of the galaxy and sustain for long time scales provided that the star formation is not too intense ( tutukov & fedorova 2006 ) .",
    "this scenario would imply that the stellar ring must have formed after the gas settled into its current configuration and could account for the gap in the light distribution between the core and the ring ( schwarz 1981 ; pearce & thomas 1991 ) .",
    "a close passage of a nearby galaxy or a tidal action of a bound companion can also set up a non - axisymmetric potential that generates spiral structures and rings in non - barred galaxies ( elmegreen & elmegreen 1983 ; tutukov & fedorova 2006 ) .",
    "in fact , recent star formation detected in uv - bright outer discs of spirals is believed to be triggered in most cases by an interacting galaxy ( thilker et al .",
    "the extended discs are generally very faint , thus the low - level star formation is easier to detect through their uv emission .",
    "the uv - bright , optically - faint emission of the outer ring of ugc 4599 implies its relation with this class of disc galaxies . in this view , ugc 4599 represents an extreme case where almost no inner star formation is taking place ( see also donovan et al .",
    "an orbiting small companion , possibly cgcg 061 - 011 , could have initiated a burst of star formation by creating a new ring in the pre - existing hi disc or by breaking an existing ring into a pseudo - ring structure .",
    "however , such an external perturbation could also destroy a ring or prevent its formation depending on the initial conditions ( buta & combes 1996 ) .    while density waves act as pattern - organizing structures , whether they substantially enhance the star formation in galaxies is still in question ( e.g. , elmegreen & elmegreen 1986 ) .",
    "for instance , observational and theoretical evidence show that the gravitational instability - driven star formation picture might not fully account for star formation in the outskirts of extended discs ( ferguson 2002 ; donovan et al .",
    "2009 ; bush et al .",
    "in fact , the low level star formation detected in ugc 4599 seems to be inconsistent with the physical relation published by kennicutt ( 1989 ) . assuming a flat rotation curve , the threshold hi surface density for star formation at the location of the ring of ugc 4599 is roughly 15 @xmath40 pc@xmath23 ( kennicutt 1989 ) .",
    "the observed gas density in the densest locations according to the vla maps is therefore lower by a factor of @xmath182 than the calculated threshold .",
    "however , note that the actual gas density might be higher when accounting for heavier elements and molecular gas in the gaseous disc ( kennicutt 1989 ) and considering that the highest gas column density is probably underestimated due to the spatial resolution of the observing beam .    alternative mechanisms , such as energy dissipation in shocks , might play also a significant role in stimulating extended star formation in galaxies .",
    "numerical simulations demonstrate that the spatial distribution of starbursts induced by shocks during galaxy interactions can extend over large scales of @xmath1810 - 20 kpc until relatively late in a merger ( schweizer 2005 ) .",
    "however , note that the role of shocks in unperturbated normal discs or around existing elliptical galaxies is not yet established ( wakamatsu 1993 ; barnes 2004 ) .",
    "we presented here a photometric study of ugc 4599 , the closest among ring galaxies of which hoag s object is the prototype .",
    "we showed that ugc 4599 has a nearly round e0/1 core which follows closely the de vaucouleurs light profile .",
    "this indicates that ugc 4599 is an elliptical - like galaxy surrounded by an outer ring .",
    "the ring itself was shown to harbor a few hii regions , indicating that star formation took place in the last myr .",
    "an isophotal study of the core shows a strong twisting of isophotes , including a @xmath5 jump in the pa at @xmath41 arcsec , which should be further investigated by detailed kinematical means .",
    "the pa and ellipticity smooth variation at the outer regions implies that the face - on ring is in equilibrium with the host galaxy and that the system had settled to its current configuration long time ago . a massive and extremely extended hi component regularly distributed in a disc - like structure",
    "further supports this conclusion .    considering the age of the host galaxy and the regular structure of the hi disc we date the age of the system at more than @xmath185 gyr ago . based on the morphology of the core in ugc 4599 we rejected the hypothesis that ugc 4599 is a barred early - type galaxy where bar dissolved over time .",
    "we suggested several ways to create this peculiar object , and concluded that both a merger between two hi - rich galaxies and the cold accretion of gas from the igm can account for the observed properties of this galaxy , as well as the huge amount of hi detected .",
    "we can not rule out the possibility that part of the gas was accreted from a close companion during the evolution of the galaxy .",

    "we are grateful to the alfalfa team , especially jayce dowell , marco grossi and oded spector , for providing the hi data .",
