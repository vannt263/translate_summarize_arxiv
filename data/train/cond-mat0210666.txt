    "the search for alternative gate dielectric materials to replace silica ( sio@xmath2 ) in microelectronic devices is one of the grand challenges that the materials science community and the si - based semiconductor industry are facing at the current time  @xcite .",
    "the rapid scaling of the physical gate lengths of metal - oxide - semiconductor field - effect - transistors ( mosfet ) requires a concomitant rapid reduction of the gate dielectric thickness in order to preserve a high gate oxide capacitance .",
    "this can no more be accomplished by lowering the size of the sio@xmath2 layer because , together with problems in the thickness control , the leakage current would become inacceptably high .",
    "indeed , the leakage current from the channel to the gate is due to the direct tunneling of carriers and increases exponentially with the decrease of both the thickness of the gate dielectric and the height of the electrostatic barrier for the electrons through the gate stack .",
    "the current roadmap projection ( assessed by the the international technology roadmap for semiconductors , itrs  @xcite ) imposes the choice of an alternative gate dielectric with a good capacitance for a thick - enough layer and its full implementation into the production line by 2005 .",
    "the properties that the new dielectric should meet are well established and have been reviewed recently by wilk and wallace  @xcite .",
    "they can be divided into _ fundamental material properties _ , and _ device processing and performance properties_. amongst the material properties , we can enumerate @xmath3 a higher dielectric constant than amorphous silica ( @xmath4 ) in order to increase the capacitance without decreasing the thickness , @xmath5 large band gaps and band offsets with si to prevent tunneling currents , @xmath6 a good thermodynamic stability in contact with the si substrate , @xmath7 a good quality of the interface with the si channel , which means a small number of electrical defects and a low midgap interface state density , and @xmath8 film morphology avoiding the formation of polycristalline films and grain boundaries . amongst the device properties , we can cite @xmath9 a good compatibility with metallic gate electrodes , @xmath10 a compatiblity with the deposition mechanism during the fabrication process , @xmath11 reliability .",
    "many materials satisfy some subset of the previous criteria , but the identification of a dielectric that addresses _ simultaneously _ all of the requirements is a real challenge .",
    "investigations on oxides like al@xmath2o@xmath0 , zro@xmath2 , hfo@xmath2 , ta@xmath2o@xmath12 , y@xmath2o@xmath0 , gd@xmath2o@xmath0 , and tio@xmath2 , have thrown encouraging results in the last few years  @xcite . amongst the most promising candidates , abo@xmath0 perovskite oxides ( where a stands for ba or sr and b stands for ti ) appear in good position .",
    "the abo@xmath0 compounds have a dielectric constant above 300 , one order of magnitude higher than the other candidates .",
    "although they are thermodynamically unstable in direct contact with si ( they react to form titanium silicide and alkaline - earth silicate  @xcite ) , they can be grown in perfect registry with the si substrate by means of molecular beam epitaxy ( mbe ) when including a silicon - compatible buffer layer .",
    "on one hand , this layer must be sufficiently thick to ensure the physical separation between the substrate and the perovskite . on the other hand",
    ", it must remain thin enough to keep the benefit of the high dielectric constant of the abo@xmath1 compound ( the capacitance of the lower-@xmath13 buffer layer being in series with that of the perovskite ) .    in the mckee - walker process",
    "@xcite , the buffer consists in few atomic layers of ao alkaline - earth oxide that can eventually be alloyed during the growth in order to accomodate the lattice mismatch with si .",
    "the growth of ao on si includes the presence , at the interface , of a ( sub)monolayer of asi@xmath14 silicide so that the final structure corresponds to the sequence si / asi@xmath14/ao / abo@xmath1 .",
    "the epitaxy is such that @xmath15 , and @xmath16 , i. e. the abo@xmath0 atomic planes are rotated 45@xmath17 around the @xmath18 ao direction  @xcite . the epitaxial crystalline growth at the oxide / semiconductor interface avoids the formation of defects and ensures the continuity of the dielectric displacement  @xcite .",
    "mbe techniques allow the control of the growing sequence at the submonolayer level preventing grain - boundaries and providing a good quality interface and extremly smooth surface morphology .",
    "first attempts to make mosfets including perovskite oxides have been reported recently . using a 110  - thick srtio@xmath0 layer as the gate dielectric , eisenbeiser _",
    "et al _  @xcite have fabricated a transistor that behaves comparably to a 8  - thick sio@xmath2/si mosfet .",
    "the improvement in transistor performance was very satisfactory , and the leakage currents was two order of magnitudes smaller than in a similar sio@xmath2-based device .    as it was pointed out before , the barrier height of the dielectric with respect to the si substrate should be large enough to minimize carrier injection into the conduction band states .",
    "a large value of the conduction band offset , cbo , between si and the gate dielectric is required , and typically materials with cbo smaller than 1.0 ev are rejected for further applications .",
    "robertson and chen  @xcite , aligning the charge neutrality levels ( cnl )  @xcite of both semiconductors , have estimated the cbo for a si / srtio@xmath0 interface to -0.14 ev ( srtio@xmath0 below , that is no barrier at all for the electrons ) in very good agreement with experimental results  @xcite .",
    "this prevents , in principle , the use of the titanate as the gate dielectric in electronic devices .",
    "however , the presence of the buffer alkaline - earth oxide in the heterostructure was missing in their approach .",
    "in this paper , we will show that in addition to providing a physical separation between si and the perovskite , the presence of the alkaline - earth oxide also allows to monitor efficiently the band offset .",
    "we report a study of the properties of bao / batio@xmath0 ( from now on , we will refer to this heterostructure as the ba - interface ) , and sro / srtio@xmath0 ( sr - interface ) structures from first - principles .",
    "the method on which the simulations are based is described in section  [ section : technicalities ] . in section  [ section : structure ] , we discuss the details of the atomic structure at the interfaces . the electronic structure is presented in sections [ section : electronicstructure ] , where we analyze the density of states at the junctions . in section [ section : bandoffset ]",
    "we study the band - offset at the interface .",
    "finally , in section  [ section : whole ] , an estimate of the band alignment of the whole whole si / sro / srtio@xmath0/pt and si / bao / batio@xmath0/srruo@xmath0 structures will be given .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ table : bandofflatcon2 ]    to what extent do these discontinuities change with the in - plane lattice constant ?",
    "this is an important question because a dependence with strain would allow us to tune the band offsets ( for example , replacing the si substrate by ge  @xcite in order to impose a different lattice parameter throughout the interface ) depending on the required values for a given device .",
    "in order to check this point , we have carried out calculations at different in - plane lattice constants . in table",
    "[ table : bandofflatcon2 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : strain ] we summarize the results for both , ba and sr - heterostructures . in both cases a variation by about 0.1 ev in vbo with the in - plane lattice constant is observed , mainly due to the band - structure term ( consequence of the strain - induced splittings of the top valence - band manifold ) , as it happens for other lattice - mismatched , isovalent , common anion interfaces  @xcite .",
    "the change is almost linear , and tends to lower the energy of the valence bands of the abo@xmath0 perovskite with respect to the ao alkaline - earth oxide .",
    "the band - structure term displays a linear behaviour with strain for the sr - interface ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : strain]-panel a ) .",
    "the anomalous behaviour of @xmath19 for the ba - interface is due to a modification in the character of the top of the valence band of bao under strain .",
    "it changes from @xmath20 when bao is compressed to @xmath21 when it is expanded .",
    "this transformation occurs for a lattice constant around 5.43 @xmath22 ( theoretical lattice parameter of bao ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : strain](a ) we plot the difference between the top of the valence band of batio@xmath0 and the highest occupied state at @xmath20 and @xmath21 of bao .",
    "the crossing point is clearly identified in the figure .",
    "no extra changes in the linear beaviour of @xmath19 are expected for longer lattice constants .",
    "the almost - linear change in the lineup term can be explained according to an analytic scaling law proposed in ref .  .",
    "once @xmath23 is known for a reference configuration with an in - plane lattice constant @xmath24 , then , supposing an uniform strain throughout the structure , @xmath25 for any other strained configuration @xmath26 can be extrapolated from :    @xmath27    where @xmath28 . fig .",

    "as it was pointed out in the introduction , ao / abo@xmath0 interface is only a part of the gate stack of technological interest for the semiconductor industry .",
    "ao acts as a buffer layer between the si substrate and the high-@xmath13 perovskite .",
    "the whole heterostructure epitaxially grown following the mckee - walker process  @xcite is made of si / asi@xmath2/ao / abo@xmath0  @xcite . as it will be emphasized in this section , the role of the buffer layer is not only the passivation of the si substrate , but also the efficient tuning of the offsets between the perovskite and the channel .        combining our results with various data available in the literature , we can estimate the band discontinuities along the whole heterostructures of technological interest as summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : wholehet ] .",
    "previous theoretical calculations of the band offsets between the alkaline - earth oxide ao and si have been reported recently ( si / bao  @xcite , si / sro  @xcite . in addition , we can find in the literature theoretical estimations for the schottky barriers between perovskites and prototypical metallic electrodes ( srtio@xmath0/pt  @xcite , or batio@xmath0/srruo@xmath0",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "we must notice that , altough most of the previous works ( except ref .  ) have been done using the same basic approaches ( dft , pseudopotentials , @xmath29-point samplings , supercells , etc ) , they differ in the details of the calculations ( for example , they have been carried out at different in - plane lattice constant , and the size of the supercells , or the parameters used to generate the pseudopotentials might change from one to the other ) .",

    "@xcite investigated the structural and electronic properties of the si / srsi@xmath2/sro interface .",
    "they predicted a vbo between si and sro of -1.91 ev for the most stable interface configuration . using the experimental gaps to locate the conduction bands",
    ", it translates in a cbo of 2.69 ev . the schottky barrier @xmath30 ( difference between the fermi level and the bottom of the conduction band ) between srtio@xmath0 and pt has been evaluated  @xcite to -0.89 ev , which implies a barrier height @xmath31 ( difference between the fermi level and the top of the valence band ) of 2.41 ev .",
    "these results are summarized in the first panel of figure  [ fig : wholehet ] .    through first - principles",
    "gradient - density - functional calculations gulleri _ et al . _",
    "@xcite focused on the structure , energetic and band offsets of the si / bao interface . for the favoured geometry",

    "some of us evaluated the schottky barriers between batio@xmath0 and srruo@xmath0 ( a typical metallic electrode in ferroelectric devices  @xcite ) to be equal to @xmath31 = + 1.44 ev and @xmath32 = -1.76 ev .",
    "these results are summarized in the second panel of figure  [ fig : wholehet ] .    for both stacks",
    ", we can clearly see how the problem of the large carrier injection ( expected for the perovskite in direct contact with si  @xcite ) is overcome by the use of the ao layer .",
    "the electrostatic barriers for both the electrons and holes , between the gate electrode and the channel are large enough to prevent carrier injections and to push the use of abo@xmath0 perovskites to a prominent position to replace silica as the gate dielectric oxide in mosfets .",
    "we have studied structural and electronic properties of bao / batio@xmath0 and sro / srtio@xmath0 interfaces from first - principles .",

    "interface dipoles , induced by atomic relaxations , have a strong effect on the band alignments at the interface . a nearly linear variation of the vbo with in - plane strain is observed .",
