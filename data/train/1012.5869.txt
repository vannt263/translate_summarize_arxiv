    "among the theories of gravity with higher derivative corrections , the gauss - bonnet ( gb ) gravity is quite special .",
    "indeed , in order to have a ghost - free action , the quadratic curvature corrections to the einstein - hilbert action should not contain derivatives of metrics of order higher than second , and should be proportional to the gb term @xcite .",
    "this combination also appear naturally in the next - to - leading order term of the heterotic string effective action , and plays a fundamental role in some gravitational theories @xcite .",
    "generally , in recent years , gb gravity has been studied by many authors ( see @xcite and references therein ) .    in the conventional , straightforward generalization of the maxwell field to higher dimensions one essential property of the electromagnetic field",
    "is lost , namely , conformal invariance . the first black hole solution derived for which the matter source is conformally invariant is the reissner - nordstrm solution in four dimensions .",
    "indeed , in this case the source is given by the maxwell action which enjoys the conformal invariance in four dimensions .",
    "maxwell theory can be studied in a gauge which is invariant under conformal rescalings of the metric , and firstly , has been proposed by eastwood and singer @xcite .",
    "recently , there exists a nonlinear extension of the maxwell lagrangian in higher dimensions , if one uses the lagrangian of the @xmath3 gauge field in the form @xcite @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the maxwell invariant , @xmath6 is the maxwell tensor and @xmath7  is the vector potential . in what follows , we consider this lagrangian as the matter source coupled to the einstein - gb gravity . the first motivation is to take advantage of the conformal symmetry to construct the analogues of the four - dimensional reissner - nordstrm black hole solutions in higher dimensions , and",
    "the second motivation comes from the generalization of maxwell field and investigation of their effects on the energy - momentum tensor .    in this paper",
    "we want to restrict ourself at most to the first three terms of lovelock gravity .",
    "the first two terms are the einstein - hilbert term with cosmological constant , while the third term is known as the gauss - bonnet term . because of the nonlinearity of the field equations , it is very difficult to find out nontrivial exact analytical solutions of einstein s equation with higher curvature terms . in most cases",
    ", one has to adopt some approximation methods or find solutions numerically .",
    "these facts provide a strong motivation for considering new exact solutions of the einstein - gauss - bonnet gravity with nonlinear source .",
    "the main goal of this work is to present analytical solutions for a typical class of magnetic horizonless of gb - nonlinear maxwell source and investigate their properties .",
    "these kinds of work have been investigated in many papers of einstein gravity .",
    "static uncharged cylindrically symmetric solutions of einstein gravity in four dimensions were considered in @xcite .",
    "similar static solutions in the context of cosmic string theory were found in @xcite .",
    "all of these solutions @xcite are horizonless and have a conical geometry , which are everywhere flat except at the location of the line source . an extension to include the electromagnetic field",
    "has also been done @xcite .",
    "the generalization of the four - dimensional solution found in @xcite to the case of @xmath8-dimensional solution with all rotation and boost parameters has been done in @xcite .",
    "the outline of our paper is as follows . in next section",
    ", we briefly present the basic field equations of the gb gravity and nonlinear maxwell source . in section [ long ] , we present a new class of static magnetic solutions and consider the properties of the solutions as well as the energy condition . in section [ rot ] , we endow these spacetime with global rotations and then apply the counterterm method to compute the conserved quantities of these solutions .",
    "finally , we finish our paper with some closing remarks .",
    "the gravitational and electromagnetic field equations of the einstein - gb gravity in the presence of power of maxwell invariant field may be written as @xmath9 = 2\\kappa \\left ( sf_{\\mu \\rho } f_{\\nu } ^{~\\rho } f^{s-1}-\\frac{1}{4}g_{\\mu \\nu } f^{s}\\right ) , \\label{geq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath10where @xmath11 is the einstein tensor , @xmath12 is the negative cosmological constant , @xmath13 is the gb coefficient with dimension @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17  are ricci scalar , ricci and riemann tensors . in addition , @xmath18 is a constant in which we set @xmath19 without loss of generality and consequently the energy density ( the @xmath20 component of the energy - momentum tensor in the orthonormal frame ) is positive . in the limit @xmath21",
    ", the nonlinear electromagnetic field reduces to the standard maxwell form , as it should be .",
    "it is easy to show that for @xmath22 , the equation ( [ geq ] ) reduces to the einstein gravity coupled with power maxwell invariant source .",
    "here we want to obtain the @xmath8-dimensional solutions of eqs .",
    "( [ geq ] ) and ( [ maxeq ] ) which produce longitudinal magnetic fields in the euclidean submanifold spans by @xmath23  coordinates ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "we will work with the following ansatz for the metric @xcite : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the euclidean metric on the @xmath27-dimensional submanifold .",
    "the angular coordinates @xmath28 is dimensionless as usual and ranges in @xmath29 $ ] , while @xmath23 s range in @xmath30 . the motivation",
    "for this metric gauge @xmath31 and @xmath32 $ ] instead of the usual schwarzschild gauge @xmath33 and @xmath34 $ ] comes from the fact that we are looking for a horizonless magnetic solution instead of electrical one .",
    "also , one can obtain the presented metric ( [ met1a ] ) with local transformations @xmath35 and @xmath36 in the horizon flat schwarzschild - like metric , @xmath37 .",
