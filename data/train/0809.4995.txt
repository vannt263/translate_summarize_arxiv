    "discrete quantum systems were studied originally by weyl@xcite and schwinger,@xcite and later by many authors.@xcite however , many concepts that appear sharp for continuous systems become fuzzy when one tries to apply them to discrete ones .",
    "the reason is that the in the continuum we have only one harmonic oscillator , while for finite systems , there are a number of candidates for that role , each one with its own virtues and drawbacks.@xcite    coherent states constitute an archetypical example of the situation : for the standard harmonic oscillator they are well understood , and sensible generalizations have been devised to deal with systems with more general dynamical groups.@xcite however , in spite of interesting advances,@xcite the discrete counterparts are still under heated discussion .",
    "number states are eigenstates of the fourier transform , but they are not the only ones : coherent states , with their associated gaussian wave functions , also are . in our opinion , this subtle , yet obvious , observation has not been taken in due consideration in this field . from this perspective , a decisive step was given by mehta,@xcite who obtained the eigenstates of the finite fourier transform .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to further explore this path , showing how we can define physically feasible coherent states for @xmath0 qubits that are also fourier eigenstates .",
    "since the natural arena of these discrete coherent states is the phase space , we use the discrete wigner function to picture the corresponding results .",
    "the problem of generalizing the wigner function to finite systems has a long story . using the notions presented in the comprehensive review",
    ", we construct a wigner function for these coherent states and discuss some of their properties .",
    "we consider @xmath0 identical qubits ( i.e. , @xmath0 noninteracting spin 1/2 systems ) .",
    "we recall that the dicke states , belonging to the symmetric subspace of the representation of su(2)@xmath1 , are given by @xmath2 where @xmath3 denotes the complete set of all the possible permutations of the qubits .",
    "these states can be expressed in terms of the elements of the galois field @xmath4 using the standard decomposition in the self - dual basis ( a short review of the concepts of finite fields needed in this paper is presented in the appendix ) @xmath5 now , consider a su(2 ) coherent state@xcite @xmath6 where the complex number @xmath7 is related with the angular coordinates @xmath8 on the bloch sphere by @xmath9 using the previous correspondence , @xmath10 can be recast as @xmath11 where the function @xmath12 , when applied to the field element @xmath13 indicates the number of nonzero coefficients @xmath14 .    in this case , the fourier operator is @xmath15 @xmath16 being an additive character defined in ( [ eq : addchardef ] ) . as it is well known , @xmath17 , so if we impose that the states @xmath10 are also eigenstates of @xmath18 we are lead to @xmath19 this immediately implies ( all the spins are pointing in the same direction ) that there are two su(2 ) coherent states ( with @xmath20 ) that simultaneously are eigenstates of the fourier operator : they are precisely our candidates to be coherent states for @xmath0 qubits . in particular , @xmath21 satisfy the following condition @xmath22 or , equivalently , @xmath23 and the minus sign may appear only for odd number of qubits",
    ".    equation ( [ gen_eq ] ) is the abstract form of the su(2 ) coherent state .",
    "it factorizes in a product of single - qubit states when represented in the self - dual basis , i.e. , @xmath24 @xmath25 being the expansion coefficients of @xmath26 in that basis . the operator transforming from the arbitrary basis @xmath27 into a factorized form is always a permutation given by @xmath28 where @xmath29    let us examine the simple yet illustrative example of a two - qubit coherent state . in its abstract form it reads as @xmath30 in the self - dual basis ( @xmath31 ) we have the representation @xmath32 in such a way that @xmath33 in a non self - dual basis ( @xmath34 ) we have @xmath35 and @xmath36 which can not be factorized . the transition operator for this case is @xmath37 and it is nothing but a cnot gate performing the operation @xmath38",
    "to gain further insights into the coherent states @xmath39 we proceed to picture them in phase space . to this end",
    ", we first note that , while in the continuous case it is possible to translate a state by an infinite distance , this is clearly not possible if the space is finite .",
    "to `` prevent '' a state from `` escaping '' the finite phase space it is natural and convenient to use the field @xmath40 in the representation of the states .    in consequence ,",
    "we denote by @xmath41 , with @xmath42 , an orthonormal basis in the hilbert space of the system .",
    "operationally , the elements of the basis can be labeled by powers of a primitive element , and the basis reads @xmath43 these vectors are eigenvectors of the operators @xmath44 belonging to the generalized pauli group , whose generators are now defined as @xmath45 so that @xmath46    the operators ( [ xzgf ] ) can be factorized into tensor products of powers of single - particle pauli operators @xmath47 and @xmath48 , whose expression in the standard basis of the two - dimensional hilbert space is @xmath49 this factorization can be carried out by mapping each element of @xmath40 onto an ordered set of natural numbers . as we have already seen , a convenient choice for this is the self - dual basis , since the finite fourier transform factorizes then into a product of single - particle fourier operators , which leads to @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the expansion coefficients of @xmath53 and @xmath54 , respectively , in the self - dual basis .",
    "it was shown that the operators @xmath55 where @xmath56 is a phase , form an operational basis in the discrete phase space.@xcite the unitarity condition imposes the condition @xmath57 . these displacement operators ( or phase - point operators in the notation of wootters@xcite ) allows us to introduce a hermitian kernel @xmath58 in terms of which we can define a well - behaved wigner function as @xmath59 \\ ,   ,      \\label{ws}\\ ] ] where @xmath60 is the density matrix of the system .",
    "after some calculations , the wigner function for our coherent states turns out to be @xmath61 a plot of this function for the case of three qubits is shown in fig .  1",
    ". we also note that the marginal distributions take a very simple form : @xmath62    to conclude we wish to mention that it is also possible to introduce the notion of squeezing for these states@xcite . in the basis of the eigenstates of @xmath63 , such an operator has the following form @xmath64 the following relations hold @xmath65 so that @xmath66",
    "in summary , we have formulated a new sensible approach to deal with coherent states for a system of @xmath0 qubits .",
    "the associated discrete wigner function has also been worked out .",
    "some related problems , as the behavior under time evolution or the extension to systems of qudits , will be addressed elsewhere .",
    "we briefly recall the minimum background of finite fields needed to proceed through this paper .",
    "the reader interested in more mathematical details is referred , e.g. , to the excellent monograph by lidl and niederreiter.@xcite    a commutative ring is a set @xmath67 equipped with two binary operations , called addition and multiplication , such that it is an abelian group with respect the addition , and the multiplication is associative . perhaps , the motivating example is the ring of integers @xmath68 with the standard sum and multiplication . on the other hand ,",
    "the simplest example of a finite ring is the set @xmath69 of integers modulo @xmath0 , which has exactly @xmath0 elements .",
    "a field @xmath18 is a commutative ring with division , that is , such that 0 does not equal 1 and all elements of @xmath18 except 0 have a multiplicative inverse ( note that 0 and 1 here stand for the identity elements for the addition and multiplication , respectively , which may differ from the familiar real numbers 0 and 1 ) . elements of a field form abelian groups with respect to addition and multiplication ( in this latter case , the zero element is excluded ) .",
    "the characteristic of a finite field is the smallest integer @xmath70 such that @xmath71 and it is always a prime number .",
    "any finite field contains a prime subfield @xmath72 and has @xmath73 elements , where @xmath0 is a natural number .",
    "moreover , the finite field containing @xmath74 elements is unique and is called the galois field @xmath75 .",
    "let us denote as @xmath76 $ ] the ring of polynomials with coefficients in @xmath72 .",
    "let @xmath77 be an irreducible polynomial of degree @xmath0 ( i.e. , one that can not be factorized over @xmath72 ) .",
    "then , the quotient space @xmath78/p(x)$ ] provides an adequate representation of @xmath75 .",
    "its elements can be written as polynomials that are defined modulo the irreducible polynomial @xmath77 .",
    "the multiplicative group of @xmath75 is cyclic and its generator is called a primitive element of the field .    as a simple example of a nonprime field",
    ", we consider the polynomial @xmath79 , which is irreducible in @xmath80 . if @xmath81 is a root of this polynomial , the elements @xmath82 form the finite field @xmath83 and @xmath81 is a primitive element .",
    "a basic map is the trace @xmath84 which satisfies @xmath85 and leaves the prime field invariant . in terms of it",
    "we define the additive characters as @xmath86 , \\ ] ] and posses two important properties : @xmath87    any finite field @xmath75 can be also considered as an @xmath0-dimensional linear vector space . given a basis @xmath88 , ( @xmath89 ) in this vector space",
    ", any field element can be represented as @xmath90 with @xmath91 . in this way , we map each element of @xmath75 onto an ordered set of natural numbers @xmath92 .      there are several natural bases in @xmath75 .",
    "one is the polynomial basis , defined as @xmath96 where @xmath81 is a primitive element .",
    "an alternative is the normal basis , constituted of @xmath97 the choice of the appropriate basis depends on the specific problem at hand . for example , in @xmath83 the elements @xmath98 are both roots of the irreducible polynomial .",
