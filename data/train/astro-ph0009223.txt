    "as described elsewhere in these proceedings , the zone of avoidance ( zoa ) provides a formidable obstacle to the study of galaxies and to the completion of our picture of large - scale structure in the local universe .",
    "the southern zoa obscures dynamically important structures in the puppis , vela , norma and ophiuchus regions ( lahav 1994 , kraan - korteweg & woudt 1994 , kraan - korteweg et al .",
    "1996 , wakamatsu et al .",
    "density fields inferred from complete redshift surveys such as pscz ( saunders et al .",
    ", these proceedings ) and peculiar velocity reconstructions ( kolatt , dekel , & lahav 1995 ) indicate that the most massive structure , usually dubbed the ` great attractor ' ( ga ) , probably lies near the galactic equator close to @xmath6 .",
    "surveys of galaxies down to moderately low latitudes are possible with some difficulty at optical and infrared wavelengths .",
    "however , quantitative studies which involve measurements of luminosity or size are very hard to make with any precision because of the obscuration problem . the blind 21-cm approach as pioneered by kerr & henning ( 1987 ) offers a neat solution to the problem , in that flux densities are unaffected by dust . moreover , with the hi  parkes all - sky survey ( hipass ) now complete , measurements of galaxy overdensity in previously obscured regions can be compared with very large control samples .",
    "this paper describes some preliminary results from a deep survey with the multibeam receiver on the parkes telescope .",
    "over 300 galaxies were detected in this survey , which is an extension of the survey begun by juraszek et al .",
    "the survey is dense enough to recognise several coherent structures and to begin to measure actual overdensities in order to quantify excess mass in this region .",
    "the hi  survey presented here is part of the ongoing parkes zoa survey ( staveley - smith et al .",
    "1998 , juraszek et al . 2000 , henning et al .",
    "the aim is to cover the southern zoa to deeper levels than afforded by hipass alone .",
    "the data presented here comprises the full - sensitivity data for the region @xmath7 and @xmath0 , or nearly a fifth of the southern zoa .",
    "the total integration time is 230 hrs , with the final sensitivity being 5 mjy beam@xmath3 .",
    "the angular and velocity resolutions are 155 and 18 km s@xmath3 , respectively .",
    "the velocity coverage is @xmath8 to 12700 km s@xmath3 .",
    "a total of 305 galaxies were found by visual inspection of the data cubes from two independent searches ( sj and rkk ) .",
    "the cubes have some residual baseline ripple near continuum sources , which it is planned to correct for at a later stage . the limiting flux density for inclusion in the catalogue was dependent on the velocity width of the hi  profile approximately according to @xmath9 .",
    "in other words , a galaxy with a profile width @xmath10 km s@xmath3 will be included if its flux integral exceeds 1.7 jy km s@xmath3 .",
    "the distribution of the 305 galaxies on the sky and in redshift is shown in fig .  1 .",
    "there is clear structure in the galaxy distribution , with several coherent features visible .",
    "there appear to be at least two voids both of which ( circinus and crux ) are identified by fairall ( 1998 ) from existing galaxy redshift surveys above and beneath the plane . at @xmath11 ,",
    "@xmath12 km s@xmath3 there is a large overdensity of galaxies .",
    "this redshift coincides closely with the aco 3627 cluster , and its spiral - rich subcluster ( woudt 1998 ) , suggesting that the structure is part of an extended supercluster or cloud of galaxies around the main cluster .",
    "this whole structure appears to be the low - redshift boundary of the circinus void and to extend at least @xmath13 mpc to @xmath14 .    extending between @xmath15 and @xmath16 at @xmath17 km s@xmath3 ( local group frame ) , and",
    "forming the high redshift side of the crux void is a coherent structure which may be associated with pks b1343 - 601 , a radio galaxy with a local group redshift of 3641 km s@xmath3 ( west & tarenghi 1989 ) .",
    "the existence of a coherent structure at this redshift would tend to confirm the existence of a cluster around pks b1343 - 601 as suggested by kraan - korteweg & woudt ( 1999 ) .",
    "we see no direct evidence for the actual cluster , though it may be spiral - poor .",
    "figure  2 shows the distribution of the same galaxies in latitude - velocity and longitude - velocity wedges , similar to those presented by juraszek et al .",
    "the plots on the right include galaxies in the lyon / meudon extragalactic database and together with the multibeam galaxies give the most complete census of nearby galaxies in the range @xmath15 to @xmath18 , @xmath19 .",
    "the ability to measure hi  fluxes and masses without uncertain extinction corrections means that , assuming neutral gas traces total mass on a large scale , we can measure densities and masses . a straightforward way of doing this is to measure and integrate the hi  mass function using the selection function noted above .    in fig .  3",
    ", we calculate the volume density for galaxies in a given hi   mass interval ( 0.25 dex bins ) using the @xmath20 method .",
    "the resultant mass function is fitted with a schechter function , and compared with the results from the shallow zoa survey of henning et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and the arecibo hi  strip survey ( ahiss ) of zwaan et al .",
    "the present ` deep ga ' survey shows a mass excess compared with both other surveys .",
    "this is particularly true at low hi  masses where there is an almost order of magnitude disagreement between the present results and zwaan et al .",
    "( 1997 ) method is sensitive to local overdensities . ] . integrating the data points in fig .  3 yields a total hi  density of @xmath21 m@xmath22 mpc@xmath23 , compared with @xmath24 m@xmath22 mpc@xmath23 for the shallow zoa survey and @xmath25 m@xmath22 mpc@xmath23 for the summation @xmath26 ( h@xmath27 km s@xmath3 mpc@xmath3 ) over the ahiss galaxies .    the shallow zoa and ahiss control samples are not ideal .",
    "the shallow zoa survey itself includes the ga region as well as the local void and is smaller than the present survey .",
    "the ahiss sample is smaller still .",
    "the errors in calculating overdensity are therefore dominated by the control samples . until hipass solves this particular problem",
    ", we will use a value for the ga overdensity of @xmath28 .",
    "this is less than the overdensity of @xmath29 predicted by potent at 4000 km s@xmath3 ( kolatt et al .",
    "around half the hi  mass lies between @xmath30 and @xmath31 m@xmath22 . at this mass ,",
    "the average maximum distance is @xmath32 mpc , and the weighted sample volume ( @xmath33 ) is @xmath34 mpc@xmath35 .",
    "therefore , the excess hi  mass in this region is @xmath36 m@xmath22 .",
    "assuming hi  traces total mass , the excess total mass is @xmath37 m@xmath22 .",
    "although the hi  in the ga region appears to trace significant excess mass , the amount involved is no more than is likely to be present in the aco 3627 cluster , which has a mass of @xmath38 m@xmath5 ( woudt 1998 ; bhringer et al .",
    "the combination is well short of the @xmath39 m@xmath5 invoked to explain local galaxy dynamics ( lynden - bell et al .",
    "we now consider alternative hiding places and alternative hypotheses to the ga :    first , galaxy clusters tend to be deficient in neutral gas , so hi   surveys are not efficient cluster detectors .",
    "could the ga consist of 10 - 50 clusters hidden within this region ?",
    "unfortunately , fig .",
    "1 shows that the massive superclusters around rich clusters such as aco 3627 are difficult to hide , and that only a few such superclusters can be present in this region .",
    "second , the sensitivity of the current survey is lowered near the plane due to increased noise and baseline curvature due to galactic continuum sources .",
    "how wide is this region and would it be able to hide significant mass ?",
    "figure 4 shows the distribution , in galactic latitude , of the 305 galaxies .",
    "although galaxies are present at @xmath40 , there appears to be a real deficit ( by a factor of @xmath41 ) at @xmath42 .",
    "this deficit is accounted for in the mass function , but there is nevertheless some room for hiding a compact cluster . at a distance of @xmath43 mpc",
    ", the remaining hidden zone corresponds to a projected diameter of @xmath44 mpc .",
    "as already mentioned , further suppression of continuum is planned in order to reduce the remaining zoa . at this stage",
    ", however , there seems little chance that important structures have been entirely missed .",
    "third , could the ga be located outside the present area , or be more extensive than the region surveyed so far ?",
    "there is certainly room for hiding massive structures near the plane at @xmath45 and @xmath46 , which have not yet been completely observed by the parkes telescope .",
    "a ga of around @xmath47 the extent of the present volume , or lying beyond the redshift of maximum sensitivity would also help .",
    "however , regions away from the plane are adequately mapped by iras redshift surveys ( saunders et al . , these proceedings ) which already fail to completely explain the degree of overdensity predicted by potent .    finally , there remains the possibility that properties such as bias parameter and galactic mass - to - light ratios vary on a large - scale in such a way as to mimic dynamical effects .",
    "comparison of a number of different distance indicators tends to suggest this is not the case , and that the issue may be errors and biases .",
    "it is notable that the most accurate distance indicator in the redshift range considered here , the surface brightness fluctuation method , appears to favour low values for large - scale bulk flow and a low value for the great attractor mass ( @xmath48 m@xmath5 , tonry et al .",
    "2000 ) , which is much more in accord with the results presented here .",
    "an ongoing deep survey with the parkes telescope has so far found 305 galaxies deep in the zone of avoidance at galactic latitudes @xmath0 , longitudes @xmath7 .",
    "these galaxies fill in the main missing gap in our knowledge of structure in the local universe out to @xmath2 km s@xmath3 in the ` great attractor ' region .",
    "the excess mass found , @xmath37 m@xmath22 , is significant but much less than that predicted by some reconstructions of the non - hubble velocity field ( kolatt et al .",
    "1995 ) . several structures ( filaments , voids and superclusters ) are identified .",
