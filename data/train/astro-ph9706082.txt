    "low - mass protostars spend the earliest stages of their evolution embedded in large amounts of gas and dust .",
    "these envelopes are dispersed over the course of a few times  @xmath13 yr , after which the pre  main - sequence object , possibly surrounded by an accretion disk or its remnant , is revealed at near - infrared and optical wavelengths . even though the general characteristics of this evolution are well understood ( see shu et  al .",
    "1993 for a recent overview ) , many details remain uncertain . during the early embedded phase ,",
    "various physical processes occur simultaneously within a few thousand au of the forming star .",
    "these include the formation and evolution of a circumstellar disk , accretion of matter onto the protostar , the onset of an outflow , and the dissipation of the envelope .",
    "the evolution of these phenomena is best studied by observing a well - defined sample of low - mass young stellar objects ( ysos ) , and by probing all components of their environment on the relevant spatial scales .",
    "several surveys of the ( sub- )  millimeter continuum emission of various classes of ysos have been undertaken in recent years using single - dish telescopes ( e.g. , beckwith et  al .",
    "1990 , barsony & kenyon 1992 , moriarty - schieven et  al.1994 , andr & montmerle 1994 , osterloh & beckwith 1995 ) .",
    "these studies have established that @xmath14 of t  tauri stars ( class  ii objects ; lada 1987 ) have circumstellar disks , and that the mass of these disks decreases over a period of a few times @xmath15  yr . the interpretation of such data in the earlier embedded phase ( class  i ) is much more ambiguous , since , in addition to the disks , the envelopes also contribute to the observed single - dish flux . during the embedded phase , matter is transferred from the envelope to the ( growing ) disk .",
    "since the latter is likely to be optically thick even at millimeter wavelengths the spectral slope of its emission is determined by geometry and orientation , and only lower limits of its mass can be inferred .",
    "the high spatial resolution offered by interferometer observations is essential to separate the relative contributions of disk and envelope , as demonstrated by keene & masson ( 1990 ) , terebey , chandler & andr ( 1993 ) and butner , natta & evans ( 1994 ) .",
    "circumstellar disks have been tentatively resolved for only a few embedded objects , with typical semi - major axes of 6080  au ( l1551  irs  5 , hl  tau : lay et  al .",
    "1994 ; t  tau : van  langevelde , van  dishoeck & blake 1995 ; l1551  irs  5 : mundy et  al .  1996 ) .",
    "caution in the interpretation of these limited interferometry data is urged , since the recent results of looney et  al .",
    "( 1996 ) show that the allegedly resolved disk around l1551  irs  5 is in fact a binary , with each component surrounded by an unresolved disk .",
    "an alternative approach for studying circumstellar envelopes is to use spectral line observations to test models of cloud collapse such as those developed by shu ( 1977 ) , terebey , shu & cassen ( 1984 ) , galli & shu ( 1993 ) , fiedler & mouschovias ( 1992 ) , ( 1993 ) , boss ( 1993 ) , and foster & chevalier ( 1993 ) .",
    "whereas the continuum data are only sensitive to the total mass in the beam , line observations also test the density and velocity structure .",
    "detailed calculations of the molecular excitation and radiative line transfer in model envelopes have been performed by zhou ( 1992 , 1995 ) , zhou et  al .",
    "( 1993 ) , walker , narayanan & boss ( 1994 ) , and choi et  al .",
    "( 1995 ) , but comparison with observations has been limited to a few specific , very young class  0 objects such as b335 and iras  16293@xmath162422 . although the results seem to be consistent with the simple inside - out collapse models of shu ( 1977 ) and terebey et  al.(1984 ) , the models have not yet been tested over the entire time span of the embedded phase .",
    "ohashi et al.(1991 , 1996 ) and moriarty - schieven et  al .",
    "( 1992 , 1995 ) have surveyed a large sample of embedded objects using various transitions of the cs molecule to probe a range of excitation conditions .",
    "this molecular approach works best if the abundance of the adopted species does not change with time through , e.g. , depletion , and if it uniquely traces the envelope but none of the other components .",
    "as will be shown in this work , the hco@xmath0 ion may be better suited for this purpose than cs .",
    "there are several observational developments which make the detailed study of a larger sample timely .",
    "first , millimeter interferometers have expanded in size over the last few years , increasing both the sensitivity and mapping speed by large factors .",
    "second , single - dish submillimeter telescopes have been equipped with low - noise sis detectors at high frequencies , which makes observations of the less massive , presumably more evolved , envelopes feasible .",
    "third , powerful bolometer arrays to trace the continuum emission from dust are just coming on line .",
    "stimulated by the availability of these new techniques , we have carried out a detailed study of nine embedded low - mass ysos in the nearby ( 140  pc ) taurus  auriga star - forming region , using both single dish and interferometric techniques .",
    "these objects span a large range in luminosity and outflow activity , presumably reflecting variations in age and mass . both continuum emission and a variety of molecular transitions",
    "have been observed , tracing densities from @xmath17 to @xmath18  @xmath19 , temperatures between 10 and 150  k , and angular scales of @xmath20 to 2@xmath21 ( @xmath22  au to 15,000  au at 140  pc ) , independent of orientation .",
    "this large range in probed physical conditions and scales , achieved through the combination of single - dish and interferometer observations , distinguishes our work from most studies mentioned above .",
    "the aim of this paper , the first in a series , is to investigate the evolution of the mass and density structure of the envelope using both continuum and line observations .",
    "the results will be tested against one of the simplest models of protostellar collapse ( shu 1977 ) , and closely related power - law density distributions . a second objective is to investigate whether even the most embedded ysos are already surrounded by circumstellar disks .",
    "ohashi et  al .",
    "( 1996 ) found that only a small fraction , @xmath23 , of the embedded objects shows compact 98  ghz emission in the nobeyama interferometer .",
    "compared to the number of t  tauri stars with disks , this detection rate is low , and has been interpreted as an indication of disk growth during the embedded phase . a final objective is to study the usefulness of certain molecules , especially hco@xmath0 , as reliable tracers of the circumstellar environment .",
    "this is important not only for constraining the physical structure , but also for establishing a baseline for future studies of the chemical evolution .",
    "the choice of the taurus ",

    "are minimized .",

    "observations of the continuum emission at 3.4  mm and 2.7  mm were obtained with the owens valley radio observatory ( ovro ) millimeter array between 1992 and 1997 , simultaneously with the hco@xmath0 10 , and the @xmath2co and c@xmath34o 10 transitions , respectively . during the 3.4  mm observations the array consisted of five antennas ; the 2.7  mm observations were made with a six - element array .",
    "two sources were observed per track .",
    "data taken in the low - resolution and equatorial configurations were combined , resulting in a @xmath35  coverage with spacings between 4 and 40 k@xmath36 at 3.4  mm and between 4 and 80 k@xmath36 at 2.7  mm .",
    "this corresponds to naturally weighted , synthesized beams of @xmath37 and @xmath20  fwhm , respectively .",
    "the observations of t  tau were made in five different array configurations ( van  langevelde , van  dishoeck & blake 1994a ) .",
    "the lower and upper - sideband continuum signals were recorded separately over the full instantaneous 1  ghz if - bandwidth .",
    "the data were calibrated using the mma package , developed specifically for ovro ( scoville et  al .",
    "the quasars pks  0333 + 321 and 0528 + 134 served as phase calibrators ( 0420@xmath16014 for the observations of t  tau ) ; the amplitudes were calibrated on 3c  454.3 and 3c  273 , whose fluxes at the time were determined from observations of the planets .",
    "the interferometer data were edited in the usual manner by flagging data points with clearly deviating amplitudes and phases .",
    "editing was especially necessary for day - time observations at 2.7  mm , when the phase stability of the atmosphere can be low .",
    "the final @xmath38 rms noise value of the visibilities is approximately 4  mjy when vector averaged over 10  k@xmath36 wide @xmath35  intervals ( see  4.1 ) .",
    "the naturally weighted , cleaned images have a typical @xmath38 noise level of 2  mjybm@xmath39 . reduction and analysis of the visibility data was carried out within the miriad software package .",
    "maps of hco@xmath0 @xmath40  10 ( 89.18852  ghz ) emission were obtained with the iram  30 m telescope , covering regions between @xmath41 and @xmath42 ( approximately 16,00024,000  au in diameter ; see fig .  4 ) .",
    "the maps were sampled at intervals between @xmath43 and @xmath44 depending on the source , with a beam size of @xmath44 .",

    "the observations were obtained in position - switched mode , with a typical switch of 15@xmath2130@xmath21 in right  ascension , again to ensure that the spectra are not contaminated by hco@xmath0 emission at the off position .",

    "the spectra were recorded with the digital autocorrelation spectrometer ( das ) backend with a typical resolution of 156  khz ( 0.150.18  kms@xmath39 ) .",
    "since the local oscillator of the 267  ghz receiver at the jcmt has no phase - lock loop , the hco@xmath0 32 spectra have a minimum effective line width of @xmath54  0.51.0  kms@xmath39 .",
    "the spectra have been converted to the main - beam antenna temperature scale using @xmath55 ( 267  ghz ) and @xmath56 ( 356  ghz ) , obtained from measurements of jupiter and mars by the jcmt staff .",
    "typical resulting rms noise levels are 0.20.4  k per channel on the main - beam temperature scale .",
    "observations of hco@xmath0 32 toward all 24 sources of tgww were obtained with the jcmt in 1993 august . during these observations",
    "the effective calibration was ill determined because of technical difficulties . from comparison with spectra obtained in 1995 , main beam efficiencies between @xmath57 and 0.31 were obtained , resulting in a calibration uncertainty of at least 30% .",
    "observations of h@xmath2co@xmath0 32 ( 260.25548  ghz ) and 43 ( 346.99854  ghz ) were also obtained at the jcmt toward the source positions . instead of a position switch , a beam switch of @xmath58 was used in 1996 may .",
    "typical rms noise levels are 60100  mk on the main - beam temperature scale at 0.14  kms@xmath39 resolution .",
    "nobeyama  45 m telescope maps in h@xmath2co@xmath0 10 of five of our sources have been presented by mizuno et  al.(1994 ) .",
    "the single - dish observations were further reduced and analyzed with the class software package .",
    "in order to study the evolution of the circumstellar disks and envelopes around ysos , it is necessary to accurately separate their respective contributions to the millimeter - continuum emission . for this purpose ,",
    "the interferometer observations are best represented in the @xmath35  plane .",
    "since visibilities are complex quantities , only combinations of the real and imaginary parts can be plotted .",
    "the vector average of the amplitudes with respect to a given phase center corresponds to the fourier transform of those components of the sky - brightness distribution which are symmetric around that position .",
    "it is important to use the correct source position as the phase center , because an offset of the order of the synthesized beam ( 3@xmath316@xmath31 ) or more creates an artificial decrease of flux with @xmath35  distance .",
    "since amplitudes are never negative , random noise in the complex visibilities translates to a non - zero expectation value for the vector - averages even in the absence of emission .    in fig .  2 the vector - averaged and @xmath35-binned visibilities of our sources are shown as functions of @xmath35  distance , with their @xmath38 error bars and zero - signal expectation values .",
    "the positions of the unresolved point sources were adopted as phase centers ( see below and table  1 ) . as a reference , the naturally weighted , cleaned images are also presented .",
    "all nine sources are detected in 3.4 and 2.7  mm continuum emission , with total fluxes ranging between 4 and 200  mjy .",
    "three sources , l1489  irs , l1535  irs and tmc  1 , are detected above the zero - signal expectation value in only one or two @xmath35  bins .",
    "however , the continuum positions listed in table  1 agree well with the 2  @xmath27 m positions , and the objects can be clearly discerned in the cleaned images .",
    "it is therefore concluded that these are true detections .",
    "the other six sources are confidently detected above the noise level in all @xmath35  bins .",
    "because the vector - averaged fluxes form the fourier transform of the sky brightness , the signal of a point source is constant with @xmath35  distance in the absence of noise , while that of an extended structure is a decreasing function of @xmath35  separation .",
    "emission on scales larger than @xmath59 ( corresponding to the shortest spacing of @xmath60  k@xmath36 ) is resolved out altogether by the array ; on intermediate scales only part of the flux is recovered , depending on the @xmath35  coverage .",
    "such resolved emission is detected on top of unresolved emission toward five sources : t  tau , haro  610 , l1551  irs  5 , tmr  1 and l1527  irs .",
    "the uncertain @xmath35  dependence of the visibilities of the weaker sources l1489  irs , l1535  irs , and tmc  1 precludes any statement about the spatial distribution of their continuum emission .",
    "the observed visibilities , and not just their vector averages , were fit with a source model consisting of a point source plus an extended gaussian component whenever necessary .",
    "this method has been applied previously to the millimeter - continuum emission of ysos by , e.g. , keene & masson ( 1990 ) , terebey et  al.(1993 ) , and butner et  al.(1994 ) .",

    "obviously , intrinsically less massive objects appear to be more evolved if judged by the absolute mass of their envelope alone",
    ". bontemps et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and saraceno et  al.(1996 ) used the envelope mass , as traced by the 1.1  mm flux , together with the bolometric luminosity to obtain an evolutionary ordering of an extended sample of ysos .",

    "this ratio corresponds to the relative distance traveled along the evolutionary tracks .",
    "based on the results of the previous section , the hco@xmath0 32 line strength can be used to trace the envelope mass uncontaminated by any contribution from a disk , which may be a problem with the 1.1  mm flux . in fig .",

    "this difference is based on the strict upper limits acquired on their hco@xmath0 32 line strengths ; it also shows , however , that they do not have the low bolometric luminosity expected from young , but intrinsically low - mass objects .",
    "it can therefore be concluded that these sources form a group of more evolved objects than the ysos selected in  2 .",

    "firstly , the accretion rate may gradually change over time , and probably decrease ( cf .",
    "foster & chevalier 1993 ) .",

    "since a clear range in @xmath177 is observed , its use as an evolutionary marker is not precluded by this type monotonic of change in @xmath175 .",
    "secondly , long periods of relatively low accretion rates may be separated by short bursts of high accretion ( fu  orionis effect , cf .",
    "hartmann et  al .",
    "protostars are expected to spend @xmath91 of their lifetime in a fu  ori phase , which means that only two or three sources of the tgww sample may be in this phase , and only one of our nine sources .",
    "indeed , l1551  irs  5 is sometimes referred to as undergoing a fu  ori outburst ( mundt et  al .",
    "the effect of the sudden increase in @xmath167 is that an object is shifted temporarily to lower @xmath176 ; i.e. , it appears more evolved and more massive than it really is .",
    "the short period spend in a fu  ori phase , as inferred from the very small number of known fu  ori objects , ensures that for the 24  objects studied here the statistical distribution of @xmath176 is not seriously affected by an individual object undergoing a fu  ori outburst .",
    "a difficulty in using @xmath178 to trace evolution is the opacity of the hco@xmath0 32 line . in fig .",
    "9 the cumulative distribution of our sources is shown after taking into account the known 32 line opacity ( see table  6 ) .",
    "this correction is small for most sources .",

    "the position of our objects is indicated , giving a relative evolutionary ordering of our sample .",
    "note that no absolute timescale can be assigned , and that the ordering only reflects how evolved an object is along its route from cloud core to star .",
    "objects of different mass may proceed at different speeds along this track .",
    "no correlation is found between either the point - source flux or the ratio of the point - source flux over the total 1.1  mm flux , and the evolutionary phase @xmath178 of our nine sources .",
    "this suggests that the mass of the disks does not change significantly during the embedded phase .",
    "there is a trend , however , between the point - source flux , the envelope flux , and the luminosity , indicating that the disk flux primarily depends on the mass or activity of the central object .",

    "the emission can be described by an unresolved ( @xmath3 ) point source and , in about half of the objects , emission from an extended , partially resolved envelope .",
    "the point - source emission is attributed to thermal dust emission from a circumstellar disk , and its high detection rate suggests that such disks are established already early in the formation and evolution of protostars .",

    "( 1994 ) are estimated .",
    "the point sources typically contribute 3075% to the single - dish flux .",
    "the inferred envelope masses within the @xmath4 jcmt beam are 0.0010.26 @xmath33 , assuming an average dust temperature of 30  k.    3 .",
    "@xmath8=10 emission maps reveal extended cores ( @xmath182 ) superposed on emission from the surrounding cloud . in the 32 and 43 lines",
    "the emission is concentrated toward the source positions and marginally resolved ( @xmath183 ) , as is expected for a power - law density distribution .",

    "typical densities at @xmath187  au of @xmath188 to @xmath142  @xmath19 are inferred .",
    "the fact that the models agree well with the observations indicates that hco@xmath0 32 and 43 can be used as envelope tracers , and that no significant depletion of molecules takes place over @xmath183 scales .",
    "however , more detailed comparison with line - profile calculations are required before further constraints can be placed on possible collapse models .",

    "<S> all nine sources are detected at 3.4 and 2.7  mm in the interferometer beam , with total fluxes between 4 and 200  mjy . </S>",
    "<S> the visibilities can be fit with an unresolved ( @xmath3 ) point source , and , in about half of the sources , with an extended envelope . </S>",
    "<S> the point sources , presumably thermal dust emission from circumstellar disks , typically contribute 3075% of the continuum flux observed at 1.1  mm in a @xmath4 beam , assuming a spectral slope of  2.5 . </S>",
    "<S> the fact that at least two - thirds of our sources show point - source emission indicates that circumstellar disks are established early in the embedded phase . </S>",
    "<S> the remainder of the 1.1  mm single dish flux is attributed to an extended envelope , with a mass of @xmath5@xmath6  @xmath7 within a @xmath4 beam . in hco@xmath0 , </S>",

    "<S> all sources look marginally resolved in these lines , indicative of a power - law brightness distribution . </S>",
    "<S> a beam - averaged hco@xmath0 abundance of  @xmath9 with respect to h@xmath10 is derived .    </S>",
    "<S> the 1.1  mm continuum fluxes and hco@xmath0 line intensities of the envelopes correlate well , and are modeled with the simple inside - out collapse model of shu ( 1977 ) and with power - law density distributions of slopes @xmath11  13 . </S>",
    "<S> all models provide satisfactory fits to the observations , indicating that hco@xmath0 is an excellent tracer of the envelopes . </S>",
    "<S> of the 15 sources of the original sample that were either undetected in hco@xmath0 32 or too weak to be selected , seven show 1.1  mm single - dish fluxes comparable to our objects . </S>",
    "<S> it is proposed that all of the 1.1  mm flux of the former sources should be attributed to compact circumstellar disks . </S>",
    "<S> the relative evolutionary phase of a yso , defined as the current ratio of stellar mass over envelope mass , is traced by the quantity @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> sources which are undetected in hco@xmath0 are found to to have significantly lower values in this tracer than do the objects of our subsample , indicating that the former objects are more evolved . </S>",
    "<S> the sources which are weak in hco@xmath0 32 are indistinguishable from our subsample in this tracer , and have intrinsically low masses . </S>",
