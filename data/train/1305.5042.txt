    "the detailed understanding of the properties of hot and cold nuclear matter is one of the topical problems of qcd , in particular in connection with high energy heavy - ion experiments at rhic , lhc and the future eic .",
    "initial / final state multiple parton re - scattering in a large nucleus plays an important role in revealing the properties of cold nuclear matter , as it leads to various physical effects , such as transverse momentum broadening of the propagating parton , parton energy loss due to induced gluon bremsstrahlung , and nuclear dependence of azimuthal asymmetries .",
    "much efforts have been devoted to the study of transverse momentum broadening in ea and pa collisions .",
    "a number of different approaches developed to describe this phenomenon were formulated within different theoretical frameworks , such as the eikonal approximation  @xcite , twist-4 collinear factorization  @xcite and the resummation of higher twist contributions  @xcite , dipole approach  @xcite , the bdmps formalism  @xcite , diagrammatic glauber multiple scattering  @xcite , color glass condensate(cgc ) effective theory  @xcite , transverse momentum dependent factorization(tmd )  @xcite , and soft collinear effective theory(scet )  @xcite .",
    "the energy dependence of nuclear @xmath0 broadening has also been investigated in refs .",
    "@xcite .    within the tmd factorization approach  @xcite",
    ", we identified the gauge link appearing in the matrix element definition for nuclear tmds as the main source of leading nuclear effects  @xcite .",
    "the formalism we developed in  @xcite was used to study @xmath0 broadening as well as the nuclear dependence of azimuthal asymmetries  @xcite in semi - inclusive dis(sidis ) off a large nucleus",
    ". in sidis nuclear tmds contain a future pointing gauge link describing the final state interactions , while a past pointing gauge link shows up in the nuclear tmds associated with the drell - yan process in pa collisions due to initial state interactions .",
    "the contributions to @xmath0 broadening from the future pointing and the past pointing gauge links are identical as this is a t - even observable . in the processes involving more complicated color flow , parton transverse momentum distributions",
    "can be affected by both initial and final state interactions , and thus could significantly differ from these in sidis and dy processes .",
    "the initial / final state interactions leading to @xmath0 broadening in ea and pa collisions can be encoded in the various process dependent gauge links  @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to investigate the process dependent nuclear tmds at intermediate or large @xmath1 following our general method described in  @xcite . as a byproduct",
    ", one can readily deduce @xmath0 broadening simply by computing the @xmath2 moment of nuclear tmds .    as a matter of fact ,",
    "the process dependent nuclear tmds at small @xmath1 have been studied in both the unpolarized  @xcite and polarized cases  @xcite . in general ,",
    "small @xmath1 nuclear tmds associated with different hard scattering processes recover the same well known perturbative tail @xmath3 in the dilute medium limit , while they could differ significantly in the dense medium case where initial / final multiple re - scattering plays a more important role for parton transverse momentum spectra .",
    "one remarkable example is the difference between two widely used small x gluon tmds in saturation physics : the weizscker - williams(ww ) gluon distributions and the dipole gluon distribution .",
    "as pointed out in  @xcite , the ww gluon distribution contains a future pointing or past pointing gauge link in the adjoint representation while the dipole distribution contains a closed loop gauge link .",
    "both gluon distributions can be probed in different hard scattering processes  @xcite .    in the present paper",
    ", we are aiming to extend the analyses  @xcite to the intermediate or large @xmath1 region . at small @xmath1 , tmds are perturbatively calculable due to the presence of a semi - hard scale ( the so called saturation scale ) ,",
    "generated dynamically in high energy scattering .",
    "in contrast , nuclear tmds at intermediate or large x can not be computed perturbatively . however , for the same reason , one can calculate contributions from initial / final state interactions encoded in process dependent gauge links in the mv model . by doing so , we are able to express nuclear tmds as the convolution of the corresponding nucleon ones and process dependent small @xmath1 gluon distributions .",
    "@xmath0 broadening is obtained as byproduct from the relation between the nuclear tmd and the nucleon tmd in a specific hard scattering process .    at this point",
    ", we would like to briefly comment on the factorization properties of the relevant processes .",
    "factorization in terms of tmds containing process dependent gauge links is often referred to as generalized transverse momentum dependent(gtmd ) factorization  @xcite . in the framework of gtmd factorization ,",
    "the modified gauge links are obtained by resumming longitudinally polarized gluons into parton correlation functions on each nucleon side separately .",
    "however , recent work has shown that it is impossible to do so for di - jet production in pp collisions because the initial / final state interaction will not allow a separation of gauge links into the matrix elements of the various tmds associated with each incoming proton .",
    "this has been explicitly illustrated by a concrete counter - example in ref .",
    "@xcite . in pa collisions , if one only takes into account the interaction between the active partons and the background gluon field inside a large nucleus while neglecting the longitudinal gluons attached to the proton side , the type of graph ( for example fig.11 in  @xcite ) which can produce a violation of generalized tmd - factorization disappears . after neglecting the extra gluon attachment on the proton side ,",
    "multiple gluon re - scattering between the hard part and the nucleus can be resummed to all orders in the form of a process dependent gauge link . as a result",
    ", the predictive power of the theory is partly restored in pa collisions .",
    "we also noticed that the process dependent @xmath0 broadening effect has been studied within the twist-4 collinear factorization approach  @xcite .",
    "the fact that the twist-4 collinear approach can be applied in the intermediate and large x region allows us to directly compare our formalism with the high - twist approach .",
    "it is shown that two approaches yield identical physical results for @xmath0 broadening in different processes provided that the saturation scale and the twist - four quark gluon correlation functions are parameterized in a similar manner .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "2 , we review our general method developed in  @xcite and apply a modified version to compute the nuclear enhancement of the transverse momentum imbalance for quark pair production in ea collisions , and drell - yan di - lepton production in pa collisions . in addition , we establish relations between nuclear quark boer - mulders distributions and nucleon ones in sidis and drell - yan using the same approach . in sec . 3",
    ", we study nuclear @xmath0 broadening for photon - jet production and quark pair production in pa collisions , respectively . in sec . 4 , we compare our results with those obtained in the collinear twist-4 approach and discuss the phenomenology implications .",
    "we conclude the paper and summarize our work in sec .",
    "in our original work  @xcite , multiple gluon correlations from the gauge link appearing in the definition of nuclear quark tmds are reduced to products of nucleon small x gluon distribution in the so - called maximal two - gluon correlation approximation . from such expression",
    ", we obtained nuclear tmd as a convolution of a gaussian distribution and a nucleon quark tmd .",
    "the width of the gaussian is given by the gluon distribution density in the nuclear medium .",
    "however , the evaluation of wilson lines in the mv model  @xcite has already reached a rather sophisticated level . in the present work",
    ", we will , therefore , compute the contribution from gauge links using the mv model instead of the maximal two - gluon correlation approximation .",
    "both the unpolarized nuclear tmds and the polarized tmds ( quark or gluon boer - mulders distributions ) can be treated in the same framework .",
    "the resulting expression of the gauge link contribution in sidis computed in the mv model no longer has a gaussian form once the finite nuclear matter size effect are taken into account .",
    "we start our derivation with the nuclear tmds containing a simple future pointing or past pointing gauge link .      in this sub - section ,",
    "we investigate how the out - going quark transverse momentum spectrum is affected by final state interactions encoded in the future pointing gauge link in the sidis process .",

    "one might expect that the contribution to @xmath0 broadening from gluons with large ( or intermediate ) longitudinal momentum fraction is suppressed as compared to that from small x gluons because of the high gluon number density at small x and the larger transverse momentum carried by these gluons .    following a standard procedure ( see , e.g. , ref.@xcite for an overview ) , one first solves the classical yang - mills equation and obtains , @xmath16 where @xmath17 is color index .",

    "for the drell - yan process one can fix the saturation scale in the same way .",
    "unfortunately , we are not able to unambiguously determine the saturation scale for other processes .",
    "now we compare our result with that obtained from the higher twist collinear approach .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the process dependent @xmath0 broadening effect was also investigated within the higher twist collinear factorization framework  @xcite which can be applied in the intermediate or large @xmath1 region . in this formalism , the effect of initial / final state multiple scattering generating @xmath0 broadening is encoded in the collinear twist-4 quark - gluon correlation functions @xmath180 and @xmath181 .",
    "these functions are parameterized as follows , @xmath182 where @xmath183 represents a characteristic scale of parton multiple scattering , and @xmath184 is the standard leading - twist parton distribution function for quarks and gluons , respectively .",

    "the nuclear quark boer - mulders function can give rise to @xmath189 azimuthal asymmetries by coupling with the collins fragmentation function and the anti - quark boer - mulders function from the proton side@xcite , respectively .",
    "according to our calculation , in the semi - hard region , the transverse momentum dependence of the asymmetry is unambiguously determined by the ratio , @xmath190 such observables can in principle be measured in unpolarized @xmath191 collisions at eic and unpolarized pa collisions at rhic .",
    "we leave detailed phenomenological studies for a future work .",
    "we have established relations between nuclear tmds and the corresponding nucleon ones by computing contributions from the process dependent gauge links in the mv model . in particular , in the semi - hard region where quark transverse momenta are of the order of the saturation scale , unpolarized nuclear tmds are determined by the process dependent small @xmath1 gluon distributions , while nuclear quark boer - mulders distributions are expressed as products of @xmath61 and the differential of the same gluon distributions with respect to gluon transverse momentum .",
    "we stress again that the formalism developed in this paper applies only for nuclear tmds at intermediate or large @xmath1 .",
    "two phenomenological applications of our work are nuclear @xmath0 broadening and the @xmath0 dependence of the asymmetries generated by the quark boer - mulders function in ea and pa collisions .",
    "to be more specific , we calculated nuclear @xmath0 broadening for jet and di - jet production in ea collisions , and the nuclear enhancement of the transverse momentum imbalance for drell - yan lepton pair production , photon - jet production , and quark antiquark pair production in pa collisions . to investigate how the quark boer - mulders function are affected by the surrounding cold nuclear matter , we also proposed to measure @xmath125 azimuthal asymmetries in sidis off a large nucleus and drell - yan pairs in pa collisions .",
