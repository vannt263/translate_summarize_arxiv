    "during the spectroscopic follow - up of proper motion stars in the caln - eso catalog ( @xcite 2001 ) , the star ce-315 ( @xmath2 ) was found to have a spectrum consisting of a blue continuum with strong emission lines of he i and he ii ( weaker ) .",
    "the line profiles were clearly variable in time scales shorter than 5 minutes , with multiple components evident even in a low resolution discovery spectrum .",
    "the spectrum of ce-315 is strikingly similar to that of the unique object gp com (= g61 - 29 ) , discovered by @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that gp com has an orbital period of 46.5 minutes , and suggested that it is a double degenerate system in which the lower mass star transfers he through an accretion disk onto the higher mass component .",
    "evidence for cno processed material in the accretion disk of gp com was found by @xcite , who detected emission in lines of n i , n ii , o i , ne i and possibly mg ii .",
    "the relative strength of these lines indicate that nitrogen is highly over - abundant with respect to carbon and oxygen compared to solar values , thus providing evidence for the action of cno cycle in gp com .",
    "the enhanced abundance of c , n , o , mg , may have its origin in the thermal pulse stage of the primary star which later on transferred this processed material to the secondary during a common envelope phase .",
    "more recently @xcite published a detailed study of the kinematics of gp com based on time - resolved spectroscopy .",
    "he found a radial velocity of the narrow component at the center of the triple peak he lines of @xmath3  in phase relative to the `` s''-wave ( @xcite 1981 ) , consistent with an accreting white dwarf if the mass ratio of the system @xmath4 is @xmath5 .",
    "the understanding of the evolutionary path of a binary system leading to a double - degenerate ( dd ) system , such as gp com , is a matter of considerable theoretical interest ( @xcite 1984 ; @xcite 1989 ; @xcite 1995 ) .",
    "however , in spite of extensive search efforts ( robinson & shafter 1987 ; bragaglia et al . 1990 ) , there are only a handful of interacting binary white dwarfs known so far , and thus little is known observationally about this class of objects . here",
    "we report the discovery of an accreting dd system with a period of 65.1 minutes , which makes it the longest period member of the am cvn group .",
    "ce-315 was discovered during the spectroscopic follow - up of high proper motion stars from the caln - eso catalog ( ce ) .",
    "the discovery spectrum was obtained march 22 , 1998 , using the eso 3.6 m telescope at la silla equipped with efosc2 and the b300b grism .",
    "this combination produces spectra with a @xmath6   resolution , covering the spectral range from 3860   to 8070  . a first inspection of the spectrum , taken with 1800s integration time , showed no sign of any other lines , except for the hei and heii ( weak ) emission lines .",
    "shortly after the discovery , during april 3 and 4 of 1998 , a series of spectra were obtained with the ctio blanco 4 m telescope with the rc spectrograph , the loral 3k ccd and grating kpgl # 2 .",
    "the nights were not photometric .",
    "however , what became clear from this series of observations was the variable nature of the spectrum of ce-315 , with line profile changing in shape and strength in time scales of less than 300 s.    during the nights of march 19 and 20 , 1999 , spectra of ce-315 were obtained , under photometric conditions , with the blanco 4 m telescope at ctio . in this opportunity",
    "we used the rc spectrograph with the loral 3k ccd detector and grating kpgl # 3 , covering the spectral range between 3750   and 7000   with a resolution of @xmath7  .",
    "the slit was 1.5  wide oriented according to the parallactic angle .",
    "the seeing during the first night was @xmath0 1.3 while during the second night was 1.5 . during the first night ( 3/19/99 ) , 25 consecutive spectra of 360 s integration time",
    "each were obtained .",
    "taking into account the reading time , the time difference between each spectrum is about 510 s. similarly , during the second night ( 3/20/99 ) , 30 consecutive spectra of 360 s integration time were obtained .    during march 23 , 1999 , using the eso 3.6 m telescope at la silla equipped with efosc2 and grism # 16 , we obtained a sequence of 27 spectra ( 360 s integration each ) with a 60 s r image taken between each spectrum .",
    "the spectral coverage was from 4700   to 6755   at a resolution of 13  .",
    "the slit was 1  wide oriented according to the parallactic angle .    in all spectroscopic runs described above , we observed spectrophotometric standards and obtained he - ar frames in order to flux and wavelength calibrate the data using iraf packages .",
    "photometry of ce-315 was obtained in april 12 , 1999 , at the ctio 0.9 m telescope using a ccd ( tek 2k # 3 ) , under photometric conditions .",
    "the following magnitudes were obtained :   b=17.23 , v=17.67 , r=17.47 , and i=17.27 ( kron - coussins ) .",
    "the series of r images taken with the 3.6 m telescope , described above , clearly showed that the object is photometrically variable in time scales of minutes , therefore , given that the integration times used for obtaining the photometry with the 0.9 m were 1200 s in b , 900 s in v , and 660 s in r and i , the above magnitudes are only an average .",
    "the observed variations in r occurred in time scales of two to three minutes and with amplitudes up to 0.2 mag .    in march 21 , 1999",
    "using eso 3.6 m telescope and efosc2 a direct he i ( 6678    ) image of ce-315 was obtained , with an integration time of 1200 s. the psf shape and size of ce-315 was similar to the rest of the stars in the frame indicating that , as in gp com ( stover , 1983 ) , there is no resolved he emission surrounding ce-315 that could be attributed to mass ejections during previous evolutionary phases .",
    "figure 1 presents the average of all the individual spectra taken in a given observing run . the upper panels show the average spectrum obtained from the ctio observations made during april 4 , 1998 , covering the spectral range from 3750   to 8830  .",
    "the lower panels show the average spectra obtained from the observations made in march 1999 at ctio and eso , respectively .",
    "most of the detected lines can be identified with either he i or he ii lines in emission , with a handful of faint lines of n i. notable is the complete absence of hydrogen emission lines .",
    "he i lines from ce-315 show triple - peaked profiles , although in a few cases the emission from the central component almost completely dominates the spectrum .",
    "this is illustrated in figure 2 , which shows the profile of the @xmath84471.5 , @xmath85875.6 , and @xmath86678.1 lines of he i. the relative intensities of the outer and central components differ from line to line , implying that the line profiles are made up of emission that originates from two independent sources .",
    "we suggest that the emission from the outer components of the line profiles arises from an accreting disk ( double - peaked profiles are characteristics of disk emission ) , whereas the central component has a different origin .",
    "the profiles of the he i emission are remarkably broad , covering a velocity range of about 2000  ( fwzp ) .",
    "fwhm line widths , determined by simultaneously fitting 3 gaussian components to the observed profiles , are typically 500  for the blue disk feature , 580  for the red disk feature , and 345  for the central feature .",
    "the above characteristics suggest that ce-315 is a binary system with the lower mass star transferring mass by way of an accretion disk . in what follows we present the determination of observed parameters of this system .      for the determination of the orbital period of the system we followed the method devised by @xcite , in which the profile of each line is divided in a blue wing region and a red wing region , and the difference between the integrated intensity in the two bands",
    "is analyzed for periodicity .",
    "figure 3 shows the difference in red and blue integrated intensities ( r - b ) versus time for three of the most intense lines within the observed spectral range and for three different nights .",
    "these non - uniformly spaced time series were investigated using the periodogram analysis for unevenly spaced data devised by scargle ( 1982 ) , and developed in @xcite .",
    "the resulting power spectrum are also shown in figure 3 .",
    "the periods determined using the data taken on march 19 , march 20 , and march 24 of 1999 are , respectively , @xmath9 minutes , @xmath10 minutes , and @xmath11 minutes . in what follows",
    "we adopt a period for the system of 65.1 minutes .",
    "an inspection of the line profiles shows that the dominant form of the modulation is due to changes in intensity of the line profiles . to study this modulation in more detail",
    "we subtracted from each individual spectrum an average spectrum and analyzed the resulting spectra as a function of phase .",
    "figure 4 presents trailed spectra , using the data obtained during march of 1999 at ctio , showing that most of the modulation is due to an emission feature that wanders in velocity between the blue and red velocity of the disk component . due to its appearance on single trailed spectra , this feature is usually labeled as the `` s '' wave .",
    "the `` s '' feature is thought to mark a bright region of enhanced emission where the gas stream from the donor hits the accretion disk . in the reference frame rotating with the binary system",
    "the bright spot is fixed in position , but the velocity of the gas in the spot is similar to the velocity of the disk at that position . the velocity variation shown in figure 4",
    "is well fitted by a sinusoidal function , with a semiamplitude of @xmath12 .",
    "this suggests that the hot spot is located at a radius of about 0.7 times the radius of the outer edge of the disk and that it is undergoing circular orbital motions .",
    "similar to what is observed in gp com , in ce-315 the intensity of the `` s '' wave is noticeably weaker when moving from blueshifted to redshifted velocities , which is probably due to effects of the inclination of the system .",
    "the projected rotational disk velocity , @xmath13 , can be determined from the half - separation of the outer peaks . from the profiles in the @xmath85875.6 and @xmath86678.1 lines observed with the ctio telescope during march 1999 , which are the lines with the largest velocity resolution",
    ", we derive a half - separation of @xmath14 .    assuming",
    "a simple model of a keplerian disk rotating around the primary component of a binary system , the radial velocities of the red and blue components of the disk profiles , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively , should vary with phase , @xmath17 , as ( e.g. , @xcite 1976 ) @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the systemic velocity and @xmath20 is the amplitude of the radial velocity of the primary component . for each line we computed @xmath21 from the observed profile using the expression @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the observed intensity at velocity @xmath24 , and @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the initial and final velocities of the range of red and blue disk velocities , respectively .",
    "figure 5 shows the dependence of the blue disk velocity with phase derived using the data taken during the night of march 20 of 1999 .",
    "the blue disk velocity corresponds to an average of the individual @xmath27 determined for the @xmath85875.6 and @xmath86678.1 lines .",
    "a least squares fit to the observed trend gives @xmath28  and @xmath29 .",
    "the first order velocity moment used by us as representative of the left hand side of eqn.(1 ) , should be less sensitive than other estimates to the presence of perturbations such as the `` s '' wave .",
    "given the short period of ce-315 ( 65.1 minutes ) , two candidates for the donor star are possible ( see @xcite 1972 )  :   i ) a helium zams of @xmath30 , and  ii ) a degenerate helium low - mass white dwarf with m@xmath31 @xmath32  ( @xcite 1995 ) .",
    "the first alternative can be easily dismissed , since in that case the light of the zams star would dominate the spectrum .",
    "we therefore conclude that the donor is a low - mass helium degenerate .",
    "in addition , the large rotational velocities of the accretion disk , of the order of 510 , require that the accreting star be also a collapsed star . since ce-315 is not known to be a strong x - ray source , the accreting star is unlikely to be a neutron star or a black hole , and therefore we conclude it must be a white dwarf .    from the observed projected rotational velocity of the disk and the orbital velocity of the primary component , it is possible to compute the mass ratio of the binary system , @xmath33 , using the expression ( @xcite 1976 ) @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the separation of the system and @xmath36 the disk radius . using @xmath13= 510 , @xmath20=8 , and assuming @xmath37",
    ", we obtain @xmath38 .",
    "the last assumption is based on the computations of @xcite , who found that the accretion disk is comparable in size to the roche lobe of the primary .",
    "assuming m@xmath31 = 0.017 , the derived mass ratio implies that the accretor mass is @xmath39 .",
    "the emission from the central component of ce-315 is barely resolved , exhibiting a line width of @xmath0350 , broader than that of the central feature in gp com which is @xmath0 120  ( @xcite 1999 ) .",
    "the ratio of intensities of the central to the disk component differ from line to line , increasing for higher excitation lines .",
    "in particular , in the he ii 4686 line the emission from the central component completely dominates over that of the disk ( see table 1 ) .",
    "these results suggest that the emission from the central component arises from a region with a temperature higher than that in the disk , high enough to ionize helium .",
    "our direct he i ( @xmath40 ) image of ce-315 shows that the helium emission is unresolved , thus it is unlikely that the emission from the central component arises in a nebular shell , produced by mass ejections during a previous evolutionary phase .",
    "further , the small radial velocity variation of the central feature makes it unlikely that it arises in the mass donor .",
    "thus , we suggest that the central emission originates near the accreting white dwarf .",
    "possible sites are : i ) the inner boundary layer produced by accretion onto the white dwarf , and ii ) the region of inflow from the alfven surface to the star for a magnetized white dwarf ( see @xcite 1992 ) . in the first case",
    "the temperature of the boundary layer is about 6 times larger than that of the disk , and implies that ce-315 should be a soft x - ray source .",
    "an interesting difference between ce-315 and gp com is that in ce-315 the radial velocity of the central component is similar to the mean radial velocity of the double peaks , whereas in gp com the central component is significantly redshifted with respect to the later .",
    "following the same line of argument that lead @xcite to conclude that gp com is an evolutionary descendant of a system like am cvn , we propose that ce-315 , having an almost pure he emission line spectrum and a longer period , is also a descendant of an am cvn system but at a slightly more evolved stage than gp com .    the number of double degenerate ( dd ) systems detected in different systematic searches ( see @xcite 1987 , @xcite 1991 , @xcite 1990 ) have turned out to be very small . in an effort to explain this observational fact , @xcite estimated the expected population of dd systems in the solar neighborhood taking into account the scale height of these objects and the white dwarf s cooling time . as a result",
    "they find that the predictions from the models are in agreement with the observed scarcity of dd systems .",
    "in particular , they predict a number density of dd systems with a period of 65 minutes ( like ce-315 ) between @xmath41 and @xmath42 pc@xmath43 depending on whether the stellar formation rate is compatible with the models of chemical evolution of the galaxy or with the white dwarf s luminosity function .",
    "unfortunately the distance to ce-315 is not known , which prevents us from deriving a density to compare with model predictions .",
    "an accurate determination of the distance to ce-315 ( and gp com ) through trigonometric parallaxes , would allow us to calculate the number density of dd systems in the ce survey , with well defined limits in @xmath44 and @xmath45 yr@xmath46 , which would be crucial to test model predictions , thus making an important contribution to a better understanding of the evolutionary phase of this class of objects .",
