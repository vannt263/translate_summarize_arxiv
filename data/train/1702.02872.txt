    "despite the fact that the expressions for the cross sections , corresponding to the interactions of the neutrini and antineutrini ( henceforth , ( anti)neutrini for short ) with the ingredients of the plasma of the early universe , are straightforward to obtain , the information retrieved from several sources in the literature , be they books , scientific publications , or presentations in conferences , is frequently incorrect . to the best of my knowledge , there is no place in the literature where the correct formulae , pertaining to these scattering processes , are listed in a manner which is not subject to misinterpretation and misunderstanding .",
    "such interactions are interesting not only in the context of simulations of the early universe , but also in terms of the physical processes taking place in the collapsing cores of supernovae . in fact , the early papers on this subject had been stimulated by studies of the physics of supernova explosions .",
    "the neutrino - antineutrino annihilation to electron - positron pairs has been investigated for one additional reason , namely in terms of the possibility that it provides a driving mechanism for the creation of gamma - ray bursts in compact stars , i.e. , in white dwarves , neutron stars , and black holes .",
    "the goal in this paper is to create a reliable source of information with respect to these interactions , as well as to discuss a number of relevant discrepancies in the literature .",
    "one additional reason for writing this paper is that only convenient high - energy approximations are quoted in most cases for the interactions of the ( anti)neutrini with the electrons and the positrons of the plasma , i.e. , results obtained from calculations ignoring the rest mass of these particles ; both the exact formulae and their approximated expressions at high energy are given in this work .",
