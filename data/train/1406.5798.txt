    "consider a box of volume @xmath0 . in this box",
    "we put an energy @xmath2 .",
    "what is the entropy s = s(e , v ) in the limit when the energy density @xmath7 becomes large ?    for low values of the @xmath2 , we expect the phase of matter to be radiation .",
    "this phase has entropy @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the number of space dimensions ( fig.[ftwo](a ) ) . at larger @xmath2",
    ", we can get more entropy by forming a black hole , whose entropy is given by the expression @xmath10 .",
    "as we increase @xmath2 , we reach a critical value @xmath5 , where the radius of the hole @xmath11 becomes order the size @xmath12 of the box ( fig.[ftwo](b ) ) .",
    "we are interested in @xmath1 in the domain @xmath13 ( fig.[ftwo](c ) ) . to see how this question makes sense , consider a flat cosmology as we follow it backwards towards the initial singularity . in fig.[fone ]",
    "we depict a box - shaped region of physical volume @xmath14 , at different times during the evolution ( @xmath15 is the planck length ) .",
    "the energy @xmath2 in the box will reach @xmath5 when the density @xmath16 in the box is still much below planck density @xmath17 _ bh _ p if we push back further in time , we find @xmath13 in our box .",
    "einstein s equations do not constrain the value of @xmath2 ; they simply tell us that the box will be expanding at a rate given by the friedmann equation ( a a)^2=16gd(d-1 ) [ oneq ] we will let our box be in the shape of a torus @xmath18 ; for string theory , we have @xmath19 .",
    "we will assume that the box size is evolving in the fashion ( [ oneq ] ) .",
    "we further assume that in spite of this expansion , it makes sense to define an entropy @xmath1 .",
    "( a similar assumption is made in the standard treatment of the big bang in the radiation phase ; one assumes thermal equilibrium for most computations even though the system is not , strictly speaking , in equilibrium . )",
    "( a ) at a small value of the energy @xmath2 , the phase with maximal entropy is radiation .",
    "( b ) at larger @xmath2 , a black hole has more entropy ; this phase continues till the size of the hole becomes of order the size of the box .",
    "( c ) we are interested in the phase where @xmath2 is taken to yet higher values . ]",
    "several approaches have suggested the answer s = c [ one ] here @xmath20 is a constant of order unity .",
    "we will summarize these approaches below , but in the present paper our focus will be on using the duality properties of string theory . in @xcite",
    "it was noted that the expression ( [ one ] ) was invariant under the t and s dualities .",
    "we will investigate the allowed expression for @xmath6 by requiring such duality invariance , and asking what possible expressions for @xmath6 can have these invariances .",
    "more explicitly , we will require that @xmath1 satisfy the following requirements :    \\(i ) @xmath6 should be invariant under t - duality in any cycle of the torus .",
    "\\(ii ) @xmath6 should be invariant under s - duality .",
    "\\(iii ) we should get @xmath21 when the box size and shape is such that @xmath5 for that box .    with these requirements",
    ", we argue that we are led to the expression ( [ one ] ) , in the domain _ bh_p [ two ] at the lower end of this range ( @xmath22 ) we will find that the expression ( [ one ] ) matches onto the area entropy of the black hole @xmath23 . at the upper end @xmath24 we will find that ( [ one ] ) gives an entropy of one bit per unit planck volume . thus ( [ one ] ) extrapolates the bekenstein ` area entropy ' @xcite to the domain ( [ two ] ) . since @xmath25",
    ", we will say that matter is ` hyper - compressed ' ; i.e. , compressed beyond the density of the largest black hole that can fit in the box .     a box of the same physical size at different times in an expanding cosmology .",
    "at an early enough time , the box will contain more mass than required to make a black hole with size equal to the size of the box . ]    at this point we recall that the expression ( [ one ] ) has been obtained earlier , by using quite a different line of argument .",
    "since our box is expanding in the fashion ( [ oneq ] ) , the spacetime has a _ cosmological _ horizon radius @xmath26 .",
    "it has been suggested several times in the past that that in the very early universe the entropy in a region of radius @xmath27 should be given by the entropy of a black hole with radius @xmath28 ; see for example @xcite .",
    "interestingly , this requirement gives the _ same _ expression ( [ one ] ) for the entropy of a box of volume @xmath0 .",
    "note that ( [ one ] ) can be written as s = c = c   v so that the entropy density is s~ [ density ] from the friedmann equation we have the radius of the cosmological horizon h^-1~(g)^- the entropy of a black hole of radius @xmath28 is @xmath29 .",
    "if this is the entropy in a cosmological horizon region , then the entropy density would be s~sh^-d~hg ~ in agreement with ( [ density ] ) .    the expression ( [ one ] )",
    "was obtained in @xcite by arguing for a ` spacetime uncertainty relation ' .",
    "the ideas like those of @xcite were explored further in @xcite , where it was noted that the entropy ( [ one ] ) corresponds to an equation of state @xmath30 .",
    "a general picture was developed where horizon sized black holes coalesce as the universe expands , so that the entropy in a region of size @xmath31 remains of order the entropy of a black hole of radius @xmath31 . in @xcite",
    "the notion of a causal connection scale was used to arrive at the same equation of state ( [ one ] ) . in @xcite a similar relation was argued to correspond to the cardy formula for the density of states .",
    "can we find a set of matter states which would lead to the entropy density ( [ density ] ) ?",
    "when @xmath32 is of order the string scale , it was argued in @xcite that such an entropy density would be obtained for a closely packed gas of string states which are at the ` horowitz - polchinski correspondence point ' @xcite ( i.e. , at the point where the string is large enough to be at the threshold of collapsing into a black hole ) .",
    "we will try to flesh out this picture somewhat , by noting that states of black holes in string theory appear to be generated by sets of intersecting branes , and thus modeling the state at general @xmath32 by closely packed sets of intersecting branes .    we have noted that an energy density @xmath32 leads to an expansion ( [ oneq ] ) if we use the classical einstein equations .",
    "but in black holes it has been found that the semiclassical dynamics expected from einstein s equations can be altered by an ` entropy - enhanced ' tunneling .",
    "one finds that the very large value of the bekenstein entropy implies a very large measure term in the path integral .",
    "this measure term can compete with the classical einstein action to prevent standard gravitational collapse through the horizon @xcite .",
    "we will ask if a similar violation of semiclassical evolution is possible in the cosmological situation . note that the entropy ( [ one ] ) is large ; as in the case of the black hole , the largeness of this entropy stems from the appearance of @xmath33 which brings in the planck scale .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in section [ sectwo ]",
    "we check that the expression ( [ one ] ) satisfies the above requirements ( i)-(iii ) . in section [ secthree ]",
    "we examine these requirements in more detail . in section [ secfour ]",
    "we use the equation of state @xmath34 to write down other thermodynamic quantities for our state . in section [ secfive ]",
    "we present a heuristic picture of how the expression ( [ one ] ) can arise from intersecting brane states ; in the limit @xmath5 this picture reduces to the standard intersecting brane picture for black holes in string theory . in section [ secsix ]",
    "we examine the possibility of quantum effects dominating the expansion rate of the phase ( [ one ] ) .",
    "section [ secseven ] is a discussion .",
    "in this section we check that the expression ( [ one ] ) satisfies the requitements ( i)-(iii ) listed in section [ secone ] .",
    "the check of t and s dualities was performed earlier in @xcite .",
    "we work with 9 + 1 dimensional string theory .",
    "thus the number of space dimensions is @xmath19 , and the newton constant is @xmath35 .",
    "we set @xmath36 throughout this paper .",
    "we take a toroidal box with sides @xmath37 .",
    "consider the expression x we can see that @xmath38 is dimensionless ; thus any function of @xmath38 has the correct units to be an entropy @xmath6 .",
    "we now examine the properties of @xmath38 .",
    "\\(i ) the string tension is @xmath39 .",
    "let us define the string length as l_s= under t - duality in the direction @xmath40 we get e l_s&&e l_s & & 2l_sl_1 & & l_il_s ,  i=2 ,  9 g & & g2l_sl_1 [ tduality ] here @xmath41 is the string coupling , and we note that newton s constant is given by @xmath42 .",
    "we thus find x = el_1 l_2  l_98 ^ 6 g^2l_s^8   e ( ( 2l_s)^2l_1)l_2  l_98 ^ 6 g^2 ( ( 2l_s)^2l_1 ^ 2 ) l_s^8=x so that @xmath38 is invariant under t - duality on any cycle of the torus .",
    "\\(ii ) under s - duality , any quantity remains invariant if it is expressed in planck units .",
    "we define the planck length as @xmath43 , and the planck mass as @xmath44 .",
    "we see that we can write @xmath38 entirely in planck units x = evg=(el_p)(v l_p^-9 ) so that @xmath45 under s - duality .",
    "\\(iii ) let all sides of the torus be equal : @xmath46 .",
    "consider the energy @xmath47 for which the radius of the black hole would be @xmath48 . in 9 + 1 dimensions , the metric of the schwarzschild hole has the form ds^2=-(1-g",
    "mr^7)dt^2+dr^2(1-gmr^7)+r^2 d_8 ^ 2 where @xmath49 is a constant of order unity .",
    "thus the horizon radius is @xmath50 . setting @xmath48",
    ", we get e_bh~l^7 g [ three ] at this energy x = e_bhvg~l^16g^2 but the black hole entropy is s_bh~ag~l^8 g thus at the energy ( [ three ] ) we find x^~s_bh    to summarize , if we take s~x^= then this entropy would be invariant under t and s dualities , and would agree with the entropy of the black hole at the lower end of the domain ( [ two ] ) .",
    "in this section we examine the above derivation of ( [ one ] ) in more detail .",
    "first we explain in more detail what we mean by requiring that our expression for @xmath6 be invariant under t and s dualities .",
    "then we explore the constraints our requirements impose of different possible expressions for the entropy .",
    "string theory is characterized by a ` string length ' @xmath51 .",
    "one of the models of the early universe is the ` string gas ' @xcite .",
    "the entropy of the string gas has the form s_sg = c_1 ( e l_s ) + c_2 ( v l_s^-9 ) [ ssg ] where @xmath52 are dimensionless constants . thus the string scale @xmath53 appears explicitly in this expression .",
    "for this reason , @xmath54 is not ` manifestly ' invariant under s - duality . under s - duality ,",
    "the elementary string is replaced by the d - string , whose tension is @xmath55 .",
    "we may define the ` d - string length ' @xmath56 analogous to how we defined the string length @xmath53 t_d=1g12 ,   l_d = g^ l_s under s - duality we get @xmath57 , and we see that the expression ( [ ssg ] ) for @xmath54 is not invariant .",
    "let us clarify here what we mean by the phrase ",
    "@xmath54 is not manifestly s - duality invariant \" .",
    "suppose the string coupling is weak : @xmath58 .",
    "let us place an energy @xmath2 in our box , with the value of @xmath2 being such that the phase we get is the string gas . for small @xmath41 ,",
    "the states of the elementary string are lighter than the states of the d - string .",
    "thus we expect that the excitations in our box would consist predominantly of string states , and not of d - string states .",
    "counting these string states , would lead to the expression @xmath54 , which would be a correct result in string theory ( for this avlue of @xmath2 ) .",
    "but s - duality is an exact symmetry of string theory .",
    "so should the result ( [ ssg ] ) for the entropy not be automatically s - duality invariant ?",
    "the situation is as follows .",
    "if we perform an s - duality , the coupling @xmath41 gets replaced by @xmath59 , and the d - string becomes lighter than the elementary string .",
    "the string length @xmath53 in ( [ ssg ] ) then gets replaced by the d - string length @xmath56 , and with this replacement the expression @xmath54 again gives the correct entropy ( in our chosen energy range ) .",
    "thus s - duality is indeed respected by the theory , but the _ expression _",
    "@xmath54 is not left invariant under this duality .",
    "thus we say that @xmath54 is not ` manifestly invariant ' under s - duality . in the present paper , on the other hand",
    ", we are looking for an expression @xmath1 that _ would _ be left invariant under the dualities .",
    "the motivation for this requirement comes from black holes .",
    "the entropy of a black hole @xmath60 is given in terms of the planck length @xmath61 , which is invariant under s - duality ; there is no explicit appearance of the string length @xmath53 in the expression for @xmath60 . in @xcite",
    "the black hole was made from sets of d - branes .",
    "the tensions of these branes involved @xmath53 and the coupling @xmath41 , but in the overall expression for the entropy these variables appeared in a particular combination which can be written in terms of the planck length alone . in our present approach we are conjecturing that as we push deeper into the domain @xmath13 the expression for @xmath1 will retain the property that it be manifestly invariant under s , t dualities .    to begin our discussion ,",
    "let us assume that @xmath6 depends on @xmath53 and @xmath41 only through the combination @xmath15 .",
    "suppose we assume further that @xmath6 depends on the volume @xmath0 of our torus , and not on its shape .",
    "then we would have @xmath62 .",
    "let us also assume for the moment that @xmath6 was in the form of monomial ( we will consider more complicated forms a little later . ) since @xmath6 has no units , we must have -a+9b-8c=0 [ five ] the t - duality rules ( [ tduality ] ) give b - c=0 [ six ] equations ( [ five ] ) and ( [ six ] ) give a = b = c so we are forced to the form s~(evg)^q for some power @xmath63 . matching onto @xmath60 at @xmath47 as",
    "before , we find @xmath64 .",
    "thus under the above assumptions , we see that ( [ one ] ) is the only expression that satisfies our requirements .      in the above discussion",
    "we have assumed that the parameters of the torus enter into the expression of @xmath6 only through the overall volume @xmath0 .",
    "but it is possible in principle that the expression for @xmath6 depends on the ratios of the sides @xmath65 . to examine this possibility",
    ", we let @xmath9 of the space directions have a length @xmath66 while the remaining @xmath67 directions have a length @xmath12 . we take ll [ shape ] and ask if our criteria imposed on @xmath6 suggest an answer different from ( [ one ] ) .",
    "the requirements ( i ) of t - duality and ( ii ) of s - duality remain the same as before , and thus imply no change to ( [ one ] ) . the requirement ( iii ) that @xmath21 at @xmath5 needs",
    "to be re - examined however , because the black hole at energy @xmath3 will be forced to a different shape . under the condition ( [ shape ] )",
    ", we should treat the @xmath9 small directions as compact internal directions , so that we really get a hole in @xmath67 noncompact space dimensions .",
    "( in other words , the black hole becomes a ` black string ' extending along the @xmath9 small directions , so that the horizon now has a topology @xmath68 . )",
    "the metric for such hole has the form ds^2=-(1-_d g_10-d mr^7-d)dt^2+dr^2(1-_d g_10-dmr^7-d)+r^2 d_8-d^2 where @xmath69 is a constant of order unity and g_10-d = gl^d the schwarzschild radius is now @xmath70 . setting @xmath48 we get e_bh~l^7-dg_10-d = l^7-dl^dg [ threeq ] and s_bh~l^8-dg_10-d~l^8-d l^dg",
    "we see that ~ ( l^7-d l^dg ) ( l^9-d l^d ) 1g= ( l^16 - 2d l^2dg^2 ) and thus at @xmath47 s~~s_bh thus we find that the expression ( [ one ] ) does not need to be modified for very asymmetrical shapes of the torus , and we conjecture that the parameters of the torus enter only through the volume @xmath0 and not through the moduli @xmath65 .      we have used 9 + 1 dimensional string theory for our analysis , since this choice makes it easy to see the effect of t and s dualities .",
    "it is known however that the full structure of string theory is best seen through m - theory , which lives in 10 + 1 dimensions .",
    "the extra space direction , usually called @xmath71 , has a length @xmath72 that depends on the coupling constant @xmath41 of string theory . since @xmath41 does not appear explicitly in ( [ one ] )",
    ", one may wonder if this expression for entropy is indeed symmetrical in all 10 space dimensions of m - theory .",
    "the 10-dimensional newton constant @xmath33 is related to the 11-dimensional newton constant @xmath73 by g = g_11l_11 thus = = [ eld ] where @xmath74 is the volume of the 10-dimensional spatial box which now includes the direction @xmath71 .",
    "thus our expression ( [ one ] ) is indeed unchanged when viewed as an expression in m - theory .",
    "similarly , we may regard @xmath9 of our space dimensions as ` internal ' directions on which we dimensionally reduce .",
    "let the volume of these directions be @xmath75 .",
    "then the newton constant for the remaining directions is g_10-d = gv_c and we can write the expression for the entropy in terms of the non - internal quantities only = = we again see that the expression ( [ one ] ) remains valid for the dimensionally reduced theory .",
    "put another way , the expression ( [ density ] ) for the entropy density has the property that even if we regard some of the directions as small ` internal ' directions , we can write s = c [ eqstate ] where @xmath76 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 are quantities that are defined using the non - internal directions alone .      in section [ secmono ]",
    "we have seen that if we take the ansatz for @xmath6 to be a single monomial in @xmath77 , then we are led to ( [ one ] ) as the only possibility .",
    "but one might imagine a more complicated expression which involves terms with different powers of these variables , such that the overall sum is invariant under t and s dualities .",
    "based on the discussion above in section [ secshape ] , we assume that the @xmath78 appear in our expression only through the volume @xmath0 .",
    "let us first write @xmath6 as a sum of terms with different powers of our variables s= _ , , c _",
    "( el_p)^ ( vl_p^-9)^g^ [ series ] where we have used the planck length to make dimensionless quantities . under s - duality",
    "we have ( el_p)^ ( vl_p^-9)^g^(el_p)^ ( vl_p^-9)^g^- so that we need c_=c_,- [ equality ] to see the effect of t - duality we write our terms using the string scale @xmath79 ( el_p)^ ( vl_p^-9)^g^~(el_s g^1/4)^ ( vl_s^-9 g^-9/4)^g^ under a t - duality in the direction @xmath40 , we get & & ( el_s g^14)^ ( vl_s^-9 g^-94)^g^ & & & & = ( el_s g^14)^ ( vl_s^-9 g^-94)^g^(l_sl_1)^-4 + we have assumed that the lengths @xmath78 appear in our expression only through the overall volume @xmath80 , so we need + = 0 [ abg ] for each term in ( [ series ] ) . but from ( [ equality ] ) we see that this is possible only if all the terms in the series have @xmath81 .",
    "then ( [ abg ] ) gives @xmath82 , and we see that @xmath6 is a function of @xmath83",
    ".    note that in our physical problem have @xmath84 . matching onto @xmath85 at @xmath47 then gives ( [ one ] ) at leading order .",
    "but we are still allowed to add lower powers of @xmath86 ; for example we could have s = c[1+_1 ( evg ) + _ 2 ( evg)^-+  ] we are interested only in the leading order expression for the entropy , so we will work with ( [ one ] ) .",
    "let us compute the values of different thermodynamic quantities that follow from the equation of state s = c [ oneqq ] the first law of thermodynamics gives tds = de+pdv thus t= ( se ) _",
    "v^-1=2c p = t ( sv ) _ e = ev= [ eos ] writing @xmath87 we see that w=1 [ weo ] this fact was noted earlier in @xcite , and a detailed dynamics was conjectured for such an equation of state in @xcite .",
    "note that the speed of sound is given by v= ( p ) _",
    "s^=1 thus compression waves in this phase travel at the speed of light , mimicking a massless scalar .",
    "the entropy ( [ one ] ) was obtained in @xcite from a model where the universe was filled with a closely spaced gas of black holes .",
    "we first reproduce this estimate",
    ". then we conjecture that the black holes could be replaced by sets of intersecting branes , extending the model of @xcite where the black holes were replaced by states of the elementary string for the case when @xmath32 was string scale .",
    "consider a gas of black holes , where the holes are ` closely spaced ' ; i.e. , the separation between holes not much more than the size of the holes . we work in 9 + 1 dimensional string theory , and let the spacelike directions be a toroidal box @xmath88 .",
    "let the torus @xmath88 have volume @xmath0 .",
    "let each black hole have radius @xmath11 .",
    "the number of holes is then n_hole~ ( vr_s^9 ) the entropy of each hole is s_hole~r_s^8 g thus the total entropy is s~n_hole s_hole~vr_s g [ entropylattice ] we see that we can make @xmath6 as big as we want by making @xmath11 small enough . in particular , the entropy of such configurations can exceed the entropy given by the surface area of the box .",
    "the energy of each hole is e_hole~r_s^7 g thus the total energy is e~n_hole e_hole~vr_s^2 g [ elattice ] from this expression we have r_s~ ( veg)^substituting this in ( [ entropylattice ] ) we find s~1r_s vg~ ( veg)^-vg ~ which agrees with ( [ one ] ) .",
    "the expression ( [ elattice ] ) for the energy @xmath2 in our box increases as we take @xmath11 to smaller values .",
    "it appears reasonable however to require r_sl_p since we do not expect black holes with size smaller than planck scale . the highest entropy and energy",
    "are then obtained for @xmath89 , with values s_max~vl_p g~vl_p^9 and e_max~vl_p^2 g~vl_p^9 m_p we see that @xmath90 corresponds to planck density ( order planck mass per unit planck volume ) , while @xmath91 corresponds to an entropy of order one bit per unit planck volume .",
    "recall that the lowest energy @xmath5 that we have considered corresponds to having just one black hole with radius of the order of our box size .",
    "as we increase @xmath2 above this value , the configuration splits into many black holes , till at the value @xmath90 we have planck energy density and planck entropy density .",
    "thus as we traverse the range _",
    "bh_p [ twoq ] the entropy expression @xmath92 goes from an entropy given by the surface area in planck units to an entropy given by the volume in planck units .",
    "we have noted that the entropy density ( [ density ] ) was obtained in @xcite from a model where space was filled by a set of closely spaced black holes , with the size of each hole being of order the hubble radius . in @xcite",
    "a model was proposed where string states would give the required entropy .",
    "the idea was to consider highly excited states of the elementary string , at the coupling where they are about to collapse into a black hole under their own gravity .",
    "this coupling is called the horowitz - polchinski correspondence point @xcite , and at this point the mass and entropy can be matched , upto factors of order unity , to the mass and entropy of small black holes .",
    "it was noted in @xcite that if we take a closely spaced lattice of such string states , then the energy density @xmath32 is string scale , and the entropy density of this lattice agrees with ( [ density ] ) for this particular value of @xmath32 .",
    "such states of the elementary string correspond to what are called ` small black holes ' in string theory , where the title ` small ' refers to the fact that the radius of the hole is of order the string length @xmath53 .",
    "to understand the states of black holes with larger radii in string theory , one has to use other elementary objects of the theory like branes .",
    "black holes are somewhat esoteric objects , possessing a horizon and a singularity .",
    "we are interested in see if we can replace the black holes in the description of @xcite by objects that we can understand in more traditional terms .",
    "in string theory we have learnt that there is a useful ` approximate ' picture of black hole microstates that is obtained in terms of intersecting branes .",
    "more precisely , we can count the number of configurations of such intersecting branes , and thereby reproduce the black hole entropy .",
    "we will review the relevant results below .",
    "we will see in the next section that the gravitational solution corresponding to these intersecting branes is a ` fuzzball ' , which has no horizon or singularity .",
    "but for the purposes of this section , we can just regard the intersecting branes as a generalization of the string states considered in @xcite which allows us to obtain the entropy density ( [ density ] ) at any energy density @xmath32 .",
    "consider radiation in @xmath9 space dimensions , in a fixed volume @xmath0 , with energy @xmath2 .",
    "the entropy increases with @xmath2 as @xmath93 , where = dd+1<1 we have @xmath94 , and the specific heat is c_v=(dedt)~11- e^note that to get @xmath95 we need @xmath96 . in string gas , we have @xmath97 , and @xmath98 .",
    "schwarzschild black holes on the other hand have @xmath93 with @xmath99 ; for example in 3 + 1 dimensions we have @xmath100 .",
    "the specific heat is this situation is _ negative_. it is a challenge for any microscopic model to reproduce this behavior of @xmath6 , since any system described by a canonical ensemble partition function @xmath101 has a _ positive _ specific heat . to describe the black hole",
    "we need a non - equilibrium system  one with a large number of metastable states , and the number of such states should grow rapidly with energy .",
    "let us first consider extremal holes .",
    "these holes have positive specific heat , but still manifest the behavior @xmath93 with @xmath99 .",
    "to get a hole in 3 + 1 noncompact directions we can compactify 6 directions @xmath102 on a torus @xmath103 .",
    "we wrap @xmath104 d3 branes on the cycle @xmath105 , @xmath106 d3 branes on the cycle @xmath107 , @xmath108 d3 branes on @xmath109 and @xmath110 d3 branes on @xmath111 . the number of points where branes of all 4 types intersect is @xmath112 ( fig.[fthree](a ) ) .",

    "the set up in @xcite was similar to the one here : we take a box of volume @xmath0 , put an energy @xmath2 in it , and ask for @xmath1 .",
    "the conjecture for the entropy , however , was derived by a direct extrapolation of the expressions for black hole entropy in terms of branes and anti - branes .",

    "we can put the equation of state ( [ eos ] ) in einstein s equations and find the evolution of the metric of our torus .",
    "note however that 9 + 1 dimensional string theory contains a dilaton field @xmath131 , and the value of this dilation would typically change as the torus size evolves . to avoid this complication",

    "in fact the rate of tunneling is set by the height and width of the barrier , and not by the length @xmath12 which determines the density of allowed final states .",

    "let us now ask how it may be possible to violate the classical evolution ( [ evolution ] ) because of the large entropy ( [ one ] ) .",
    "a scenario for this violation was discussed in @xcite .",

    "such an effect would of course be present in many quantum systems , but the circumstance which makes it interesting in our present cosmological problem is that the number of states involved is very large ; as we had noted above , this largeness stems from the appearance of @xmath33 in the denominator of ( [ one ] ) which brings in the planck scale . for every state available at one scale factor ,",
    "there is a densely spaced band of states into which it can evolve if the scale factor were larger .",
    "the quantum mechanical problem describing this situation is pictured in fig.[fsix ] .",
    "we consider a sequence of volumes for a spatial box , starting at a volume @xmath145 , and moving through progressively larger volumes @xmath175 .",
    "the state in the box of volume @xmath145 can be absorbed into a band of states in the volume @xmath176 .",
    "but each state in this band can itself be absorbed into a band of states in the larger volume @xmath177 and so on .    for our cosmological situation",
    "we do not know the amplitudes for the transitions between levels , but we make a toy model by seting all amplitudes for transition per unit time to be equal to the same number @xmath178 .",
    "we also let the energy spacing in each band be the same , @xmath179 .",
    "as the system evolves , the wavefunction moves from the state at volume @xmath145 to the band of states in the volume @xmath176 , then to the states at @xmath177 and so on .",
    "we can compute the probability to be at volume @xmath180 aftertime @xmath181 .",
    "in particular , we can ask for the value of @xmath182 where this probability peaks at any given time @xmath181 .",
    "one finds that the location of this peak is given by @xcite k_peak(t)t note that this expansion @xmath183 is in _ addition _ to any expansion rate obtained from the classical gravity equations , since it is generated by the phase space measure describing the degeneracy of states .",
    "this measure factor is small in typical laboratory systems , but can be very large if the entropy has a gravitational origin involving the newton constant @xmath33 .     can transition with amplitude @xmath178 to a band of states in volume @xmath184 , with band spacing @xmath179 ; thus we get a series of ` fermi golden rule absorptions ' taking us to larger volumes . ]",
    "this evolution to larger volumes @xmath180 may be quite rapid , and may give a kind of ` inflation ' without the need for an inflaton field with a slow roll potential .",
    "initial density fluctuations are likely to arise from an effective action derived from the free energy , just as was found for the string gas @xcite .",
    "these fluctuations are also likely to stay frozen in amplitude as the volume evolves through the steps in fig.[fsix ] , for the following reason .",
    "suppose the local energy density at a point is a little higher than the average ( @xmath185 ) .",
    "then this higher value of the local energy stays fixed as the system moves through the steps of fig.[fsix ] ; it does not dissipate away to neighbouring lower density points because the evolution of fig.[fsix ] does not have a kinetic term that moves energy from one point to neighboring points . fluctuations .",
    "if we do get a rapid expansion with perturbations that are frozen in amplitude , then we mimic the results of an inflationary scenario .",
    "when the branes of fig.[ffour ] finally annihilate to radiation , we would get these perturbations imprinted onto that radiation .",
    "it is interesting that one can reach the entropy expression ( [ one ] ) from very different arguments . in @xcite",
    "this expression was obtained from a ` spacetime uncertainty relation ' . in @xcite",
    "one considers the expansion caused by the matter density @xmath32 , and assumes that the entropy in a cosmological horizon region would be of order the bekenstein entropy for the largest hole that would fit in this region .",
    "the third line of argument ( noted in @xcite and analyzed in detail in the present paper ) requires that the expression for entropy be invariant under the t and s dualities of string theory .",
    "this requirement limits the possible functional dependences for @xmath1 .",
    "in @xcite it was argued that we get ( [ one ] ) if we further require that @xmath6 be proportional to @xmath0 . in our analysis",
    "we did not imposed this requirement , but requiring agreement with the bekenstein entropy for @xmath5 gave the expression ( [ one ] ) .",
    "we have noted that while t and s dualities are exact symmetries of string theory , it does not follow that the expression for the entropy @xmath6 must be invariant under these dualities .",
    "the _ value _ of the entropy @xmath6 will necessarily be invariant , since the dualities are a symmetry .",
    "but the _ expression _ for @xmath6 need not be invariant ; it will in general only be covariant , changing form as we change duality frames .",
    "thus the requirement that the expression for @xmath6 be invariant is an additional assumption , and it is this assumption , coupled with the requirement that @xmath186 at @xmath5 that gave us the entropy expression ( [ one ] ) . the requirement that the expression for @xmath6 be invariant under dualities is suggested by the invariances found in the expressions for the entropy of black holes in string theory .    in @xcite it had been observed that an entropy like ( [ one ] ) can be obtained by taking a densely spaced set of black holes , with the radius of the holes being of order the hubble radius .",
    "black holes might appear to be esoteric objects , but we have learnt in string theory that their entropy can be reproduced by counting the states of intersecting branes . in @xcite it was noted that when the energy density @xmath32 is string scale , a dense gas of string states at the ` horowitz - polchinski correspondence point ' reproduces the entropy ( [ one ] ) .",
    "we have noted that at any density @xmath32 we can replace the black holes by sets of intersecting branes , so an entropy like ( [ one ] ) can be realized by states in string theory .",
    "these intersecting brane states do not collapse into black holes ; instead they generate ` fuzzball states ' which are complicated states of string theory without horizons or singularities .",
    "finally , we explored the idea that the evolution of such a high entropy state may not satisfy the traditional einstein equations .",
    "the entropy ( [ one ] ) matches onto the black hole entropy when @xmath5 . in black holes",
    "we get a traditional horizon if we assume that einstein s equations are satisfied by a shell as it collapses through its horizon .",
    "but the horizon so generated leads to the black hole information paradox , which is a serious obstruction to the unitarity of the underlying quantum theory .",
    "in string theory the semiclassical approximation can be violated at the horizon because the collapsing shell can tunnel into a densely spaced band of fuzzball states .",
    "we can therefore ask if similar effects can come into play in our cosmological situation .",
    "we have noted that the number of states increases rapidly with the volume @xmath0 ; this rapid increase can be traced to the appearance of @xmath187 in the denominator of ( [ one ] ) which makes @xmath6 very large .",
    "if the density of state rises very rapidly with the volume @xmath0 , then the toy model constructed in section [ secsc ] suggests that there may be a rapid ` push ' towards larger @xmath0 .",
    "this push would arise from the measure in the path integral ( which tracks the number of available states ) and would therefore be in addition to any expansion arising from the classical einstein equations .",
    "this argument is certainly speculative , but it would be interesting to study it further .",
