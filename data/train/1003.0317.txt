    "grs 1915 + 105  is the brightest microquasar in our galaxy , providing us with a unique opportunity to study the accretion flow onto a black hole at high fractions of eddington ratio ( for a review , see * ? ? ?",
    "this source , discovered in 1992 with the watch instrument on granat @xcite , has been persistently active up to now unlike usual soft x - ray transients .",
    "grs 1915 + 105  was recognized to be a superluminal source by vlba observations of radio outbursts @xcite , making it a target of great importance for studying the formation mechanism of relativistic jets . from the kinetics of the radio jets , their intrinsic speed and inclination",
    "are determined to be @xmath4 ( @xmath5 is the light speed ) and @xmath6 , respectively @xcite .",
    "the near infrared observations have revealed that the system consists of a black hole with a mass of @xmath7  and a k  iii type companion star with an orbital period of 33.5 days @xcite .",
    "this indicates a huge size of the accretion disk with a continuously high mass transfer rate from the companion , which may account for many unique features of this source compared with normal black hole binary systems .",
    "the source has been intensively studied at high energies by many observatories on different occasions .",
    "_ rxte_/pca observations revealed that grs 1915 + 105  often exhibits dramatic temporal and spectral variations , so - called limit - cycle oscillations , unique features in accreting stellar mass black holes in our galaxy ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "@xcite found the instantaneous spectral state of grs 1915 + 105  can be divided into states , states  a , b , and c , where the source undergoes frequent transition or stays stable .",
    "based on these transition patterns , they classified them into 12 classes , including 2 `` stable '' classes ( class  @xmath0 and @xmath8 ) with little variability on a time scale longer than @xmath9 sec .",
    "this behavior is quite different from normal black holes observed in canonical states , the low / hard , intermediate ( or very high ) , and high / soft states ( @xcite ; see also @xcite and @xcite for more recent classification ) .",
    "the correspondence of states  a , b , and c of grs 1915 + 105  to these states is not completely understood , however @xcite .",
    "theoretically , the limit - cycle oscillation can be explained by thermal instability in the inner part of the accretion disk under high mass accretion rate , triggering limit - cycle transitions between two stable branches in the surface density vs @xmath10 plane : the standard disk and optically - thick advection dominated accretion flow , so - called the slim disk @xcite . in fact , two - dimensional hydrodynamic simulations are successful to reproduce the limit cycle behaviors of grs 1915 + 105  qualitatively @xcite .",
    "however , direct observations that trace the evolution of the disk structure both in the oscillation and stable state are still insufficient to be compared with model predictions , and their interpretations may be subject to large uncertainties since understanding of the origin of the x - ray emission is not fully established .",
    "many early works relied on the spectral modelling by a multi - color disk ( mcd ; @xcite ) model plus a power law , as applied to other black hole binaries .",
    "there is no guarantee that this model always holds to grs 1915 + 105 , in particular when the power law component dominates the entire flux .",
    "later observational works @xcite have suggested that the x - ray spectra of grs 1915 + 105  at least in some states are dominated by an optically - thick comptonization of the disk photons off low energy electrons , by applying physically more realistic models than the canonical mcd + power law model .",
    "@xcite analyzed broad band spectra observed with _",
    "rxte_/pca , hexte , and _",
    "cgro_/osse , and found that they can be described by comptonization from thermal / non - thermal hybrid plasmas . such low temperature , optically - thick comptonization may be common characteristics in accretion flows at high eddington fractions , which may apply to those onto supermassive black holes @xcite .",
    "observations of local spectral features such as iron - k emission line and absorption lines give key information to reveal the structure of accretion disks . from high resolution spectra ( ccd or the hetgs instrument on _ chandra _ ) of grs 1915 + 105 , absorption lines from highly ionized ions",
    "have been clearly detected @xcite .",
    "this indicates the presence of strong disk wind most probably occurring at @xmath11 ( @xmath12 is the gravitational radius where @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath5 being the gravitational constant , mass of the black hole , and light velocity , respectively ) , which carries a huge amount of accreting gas outward the system @xcite . on the other hand , the emission line profile gives constraints on the geometry between the continuum emitting region and reflector , most probably the accretion disk .",
    "an iron - k emission line has been detected from grs 1915 + 105 , whose shape and intensity seem to depend on the states @xcite . since its equivalent width is not large ( @xmath15 ev ) in grs 1915 + 105 , we need both good spectral resolution and large effective area to accurately measure the profile , in particular to trace the change during oscillations .",

    "the large effective area with good energy resolution in the 0.212 kev band , together with the simultaneous coverage of the 10600 kev band with unprecedented sensitivities , give us the best opportunities to reveal the origins of the x - ray emission and disk structure of grs 1915 + 105  both in stable and oscillation states . in our work , we refer to the latest results on the metal abundances of interstellar ( plus circumstellar ) gas toward grs 1915 + 105  as determined by _",

    "the xis , pin , and gso simultaneously covers the energy band of 0.212 kev , 1060 kev , and 40600 kev , respectively .",
    "the target was observed at the so - called xis - nominal position .",
    "the xiss were operated in the normal clock mode with the @xmath23 editing mode for xis-0 , 2 , and 3 , and @xmath24 for xis-1 . to minimize pile - up ( double photon events ) due to the brightness of this source ,",
    "the 1/8 window option was adopted for xis-0 , xis-2 , and xis-3 , which reduced the exposure time per frame from 8 sec to 1 sec .",
    "xis-1 was operated with the 0.1 sec burst plus 1/8 window option , although the 1/8 window option was turned off for xis-1 before oct 18 00:26 , due to an accidental error in the satellite operation .",
    "we utilize xis data taken with different modes according to the purpose of an analysis .",
    "the xis-1 events are used to derive ( 1 ) unsaturated light curves with a resolution of 1 sec ( after oct 18 00:26 ) and 8 sec ( before then ) and ( 2 ) continuum spectra with little effects from pile - up , while we use xis-0 , 2 and 3 data to make the spectra with high photon statistics in the 510 kev band for detailed study of the iron - k features .",
    "we analyze the data using the heasoft version 6.4.1 package , utilizing the products version 2.0.6.13 processed by the pipeline processing team and calibration database ( caldb ) released on 2008 dec .  3 .",
    "for the analysis of the xis data , we exclude events suffering from telemetry saturation , based on the gti filters provided by the xis team .",
    "we do not subtract the non x - ray background nor the cosmic x - ray background , which are negligible compared with the bright source counts .",
    "for the spectral analysis of the xis-1 data taken with the full window mode before oct 18 00:26 , we subtract out - of - time events as background by utilizing events in an outer region in the same ccd chip . in the extraction of the spectra of xis-0 , 2 , and 3 ( i.e. , without burst options )",
    ", we exclude a circular region with a radius of 120 pixels around the target position to reduce the effects of pile - up events .",
    "it is known that the attitude of the _ suzaku _  satellite exhibits an orbital variation by @xmath250.5 arcmin , causing periodic shifts of the target position in the focal plane .",
    "hence , we check the central position of the source and define an event extraction region every 200 seconds .    for the hxd ,",
    "we use the best modelled background files provided by the hxd team .",
    "the reproductivity of the nxb spectra with a 10 ksec exposure is known to be 1.4% and 0.6% for the pin ( 1540 kev ) and gso ( 50100 kev ) , respectively @xcite .",
    "then , an estimated cxb spectrum is added to the nxb spectrum of the pin with the angular transmission function for a uniformly extended emission .",
    "the cxb is neglected in analysis of the gso data .",
    "figure  1 shows the light curves of grs 1915 + 105  obtained with xis-1 in the 110 kev band and with the hxd / pin in the 1060 kev during the whole observation epoch .",
    "all photons observed in the xis-1 chip are utilized here , but the xis-1 count rates before oct 18 00:26 are artificially reduced by a factor of 0.51 to correct for the difference of the integration area from the data taken with the 1/8 window option . for convenience , hereafter we define @xmath26 as the time since 2005 october 16.0 in units of hours . it is seen that at @xmath27 grs 1915 + 105  was in an x - ray stable state , except for a possible flare - like event seen at @xmath28 . from @xmath29 ,",
    "the x - ray flux increased rapidly and entered into `` oscillation '' that lasted till @xmath30 . from @xmath31 , grs 1915 + 105  exhibits a similar x - ray flare , followed by oscillation whose variability pattern is different from the previous one ( see @xcite and @xcite for x - ray light curves observed with other satellites ) . throughout the observation ,",
    "the source was very bright in soft x rays , @xmath32 erg @xmath33 s@xmath34 in the 210 kev band .    for comparison with previous studies of grs 1915 + 105 we first identify the `` class '' and `` state '' of grs 1915 + 105  in our observations , according to the model - independent classification scheme by @xcite .",
    "as seen from figure  1 , grs 1915 + 105  continuously stayed in the `` stable state '' in the period of @xmath35 , which is similar to the plateau state  @xcite , before entering into the oscillation phase .",
    "timing and spectral analyses of the data taken with the proportional counter arrays ( pca ) on _ rxte _  at the epoch of @xmath36 reveal that our `` stable state '' corresponds to class  @xmath0 ( stable state  c ) having an extremely soft spectrum , accompanied with a quasi periodic oscillation ( qpo ) at @xmath186 hz @xcite .",
    "figure  2 shows representative x - ray light curves ( @xmath37 ) in the oscillation phase taken with the _ suzaku _  xis-1 and pin in the 110 kev and 1060 kev band , respectively , together with their hardness ratio .",
    "we identify the x - ray variability pattern as class  @xmath1 in @xcite , where the transition occurs between state  c and state  a ( soft dip ) on a time scale of @xmath2510 minutes .",
    "it is seen that during oscillations the spectral colors significantly softens in the dip phase , as expected according to previous studies with _ rxte _  @xcite .",
    "for spectral analysis , we define four different states ( a ) `` stable state '' ( stable ) , ( b ) `` oscillation high state '' ( osc - h ) , ( c)``oscillation medium state '' ( osc - m ) , and ( d)``oscillation low state '' ( osc - l ) , according to time variability pattern and intensity level .",
    "the stable and oscillation - high states consist of state  c data defined by @xcite , while oscillation - med and low corresponds to state  a. the time region is taken between @xmath38 for ( a ) , when the source flux was almost constant ( class  @xmath0 ) , and @xmath39 for the rest ( class  @xmath1 ) .",
    "the oscillation high , med , low states are defined as when the 1060 kev pin count rate is above 24 c s@xmath34 , between 1224 c s@xmath34 , and between 112 c s@xmath34 , respectively , within the above time region .",
    "the count rate thresholds for the oscillation states are illustrated by two lines in the middle panel of figure  2 .",
    "table  1 summarizes the definition of the states .",
    "we make final good time intervals ( gtis ) by combining the xis , pin , and gso , to cover exactly simultaneous time regions in each state .",

    "as mentioned above , different xis sensors are used for each purpose . for the former step",
    ", we use xis-0 , 2 , and 3 ( fi - xiss ) , which were operated without the burst options , by excluding the central core of the point spread functions ; this makes us achieve good photon statistics by avoiding extreme pile - up effects .",
    "the spectra of the three sensors are summed together with the energy responses .",
    "for the latter step , we make a simultaneous spectral fit to the spectra of xis-1 ( bi - xis ) , pin , and gso , covering the 2120 kev band , for the stable and oscillation - high states , while we only use the xis and pin spectra in the 250 kev band for the oscillation - med and low states , since the gso data in these states have limited statistics due to the low flux and short exposure .",
    "the data of xis-1 , operated with the 0.1 s burst option , is almost free from pile - up effects and we can utilize all photons in the point spread function . thanks to this fact , we can best estimate the continuum below 10 kev with least uncertainties in the calibration of the energy response of the xis+xrt system , although the photon statistics is poorer than the data of the three fi - xiss .",
    "the observed spectra of the xis-1 and hxd in the stable and oscillation state are plotted in figure  3 ( a ) and ( b ) , respectively .",
    "since the determination of the local features affects that of the continuum and vice versa , the above two steps are repeated in an iterative way .",
    "firstly , we roughly determine the continuum shape from the bi - xis and hxd spectra .",
    "secondly , using the fi - xiss spectra in the 510 kev band , we determine local iron - k features , including absorption lines and an iron - k emission line , which is modelled by a feature from a reflection component . in this stage",
    ", we fix the parameters of the continuum at the best - fit obtained above except for its normalization . to take into account a remaining component of pile - up events ,",
    "we add a power law component having a positive photon index in the model , whose parameters are set free .",
    "thirdly , we again perform the continuum fit of the bi - xis and hxd spectra , but including the reflection component and absorption line features , whose parameters are fixed at the best - fit values as determined in the previous fit of the fi - xiss spectra .",
    "detailed description of the continuum model and local features is given in the following subsections .",
    "in our study , special care is paid on two important effects that could affect the modelling of the continuum , ( 1 ) interstellar absorption and ( 2 ) dust scattering .",
    "it is well known that the elemental abundances in interstellar medium in our galaxy are different by location , and are not `` solar '' , as often assumed in spectral analyses of galactic sources . to model the total photo - electric absorption toward grs 1915 + 105",
    ", we refer to the results by @xcite obtained from the _",
    "chandra_/hetgs spectrum , in terms of `` equivalent '' hydrogen column densities ( converted from the solar abundances by @xcite ) of @xmath41 @xmath33 for h , he , c , n , and o , @xmath42 @xmath33 for ne , na , mg , and al , @xmath43 @xmath33 for si , @xmath44 @xmath33 for s , cl , ar , and ca , and @xmath45 @xmath33 for cr , fe , co , and ni .",
    "the absorption cross section by @xcite is adopted , which is available as _ tbvarabs _ model in xspec .",
    "we also take into account the effects by dust scattering , which are more significant in soft x - rays particularly below @xmath46 kev .",
    "a part of direct emission from a heavy absorbed source is scattered out by interstellar dust in the line - of - sight , while photons emitted with slightly different angles are scattered in , thus making dust - scattering halo around the target . at first order approximation",
    "the scattered - in and scattered - out lights cancel each other , although there is time delay before scattered - in components reach an observer following the direct component .",
    "hence , we do need to correct for this effect as far as the source spectrum is constant _ and _ one can integrate all the emission including both direct and halo components .",
    "this is not the case for grs 1915 + 105  observed with",
    ", however , because ( 1 ) the halo components can not be fully collected in a limited field of view of the xis and ( 2 ) the source is highly variable in the oscillation states . assuming the same image profile of the dust scattered halo as gx 13 + 1 @xcite , which has a similar absorption column density to grs 1915 + 105",
    ", we find that the effective area of the xis-1 ( full window ) for the halo component is @xmath1860% of that for the direct ( i.e. , point source ) one , and thus the scattering effect is not canceled out even when the spectrum is constant . when it is variable , the situation becomes more complex ; the total spectrum observed in a given time interval is contaminated by halo components emitted in earlier epochs due to their time delay .",
    "the time scale of the delay is estimated to be @xmath47 , where @xmath1 and @xmath48 is the halo size and distance to the source , respectively .",
    "taking @xmath49 according to the halo profile of gx 13 + 1 , we estimate the delay to be @xmath25100 hours , much longer than the time scale of the oscillations .",
    "this means that we approximately observe the spectrum of _ variable _ direct emission plus _ constant _ dust - scattered component in the oscillation states .",
    "according to the light curve of all sky monitor on _ rxte _",
    "@xcite , the averaged flux level was almost constant for @xmath2515 days before our observation epoch , and thus we can reasonably assume that the shape of the direct spectrum producing the observed halo component is the same as that of the stable state .    to make the best estimate of the continuum spectra including low energies below @xmath253 kev , we derive the spectrum of the halo component in the stable state , by taking into account the fact that 60% of the scattered - in component is contained in the observed spectrum . here",
    "we refer to the cross section of dust scattering given by @xcite , which is fine - tuned to reproduce the observed halo intensity of gx 13 + 1 @xcite at its hydrogen column density @xcite . for the oscillation states",
    ", we subtract this component from the observed spectra and fit them by considering the opacity of both dust - scattering and photo - electric absorption .",
    "we assume that the halo component is the same as in the stable state and is constant during the oscillation .",
    "the dust - scattered component is plotted in figure 3 ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "its fraction in the direct ( unscattered ) component is found to be 6% , 7% , and 15% at 3 kev in the oscillation - high , med and low state , respectively , which increases toward lower energies approximately as @xmath50 .",
    "the spectra of the fi - xiss with rich photon statistics reveal that the iron - k features are different between the four states .",
    "figure  4 shows the summed fi - xiss spectra in the 510 kev band from which the estimated pile - up components ( see above ) are subtracted .",
    "the overlaid model is the best - fit continuum model with its reflection component , described below , from which both iron - k emission and absorption lines are excluded to show their significance ; the ratio of the data to the model is plotted in the lower panel .",
    "in addition to a deep absorption - edge at 7.11 kev due to the overabundance of iron in the interstellar or circumstellar medium toward grs 1915 + 105 , we detect an emission line centered at 6.56.6 kev in both stable and oscillation low states , whereas it is very weak in the oscillation high and medium states .",
    "we also find a strong absorption line feature from he - like and h - like iron ions at @xmath51 and @xmath52 kev in the oscillation low state , which is weaker in the other states ; in particular , no significant absorption lines are detected in the stable state .",
    "we model the iron - k emission line by utilizing the _ pexriv _ reflection code @xcite , which calculates both reflection continuum and fluorescence line .",
    "the line profile is further blurred with the _ diskline _ kernel @xcite , by assuming that it originates from the accretion disk between the radii @xmath53 and @xmath54 with an emissivity law of @xmath55 .",
    "the free parameters are ( 1 ) the solid angle of the reflector @xmath56 , which basically determines the equivalent width ( ew ) of the emission line , ( 2 ) ionization parameter @xmath57 @xcite ( where @xmath58 , @xmath20 , and @xmath59 is the luminosity , density of the reflector , and distance from the emitter , respectively ) , and ( 3 ) innermost radius @xmath53 .",
    "we fix an iron abundance at the same value as in the interstellar absorption , an inclination of 70@xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 .",
    "note that the _ pexriv _ model does not properly calculate the additional broadening by comptonization in the emission line profile ( see * ? ? ?",
    "thus , we may slightly underestimate the true equivalent width , and hence the reflection strength in the stable state , where the ionization parameter is found to be log @xmath63 = 23 . in the oscillation states ,",
    "the effects are expected to be negligible due to the low ionization parameter ( log @xmath64 2 ) .",

    "we first apply a canonical model consisting of a mcd component and a power law , which turns out to not acceptable ( @xmath125/dof = 559/354 ) ; moreover , the best - fit results are quite unphysical because ( 1 ) the innermost temperature of the mcd model is high ( @xmath253 kev ) with an extreme small radius ( @xmath254 km ) and ( 2 ) the power law component dominates the flux over the entire band .",
    "this confirms that the spectral state is very different from the canonical high / soft state of black hole binaries .",
    "similar fitting results are reported by @xcite from _ rxte_/pca data of grs 1915 + 105  when the 0.510 hz qpos are observed .",
    "next , we apply a thermal comptonization model by @xcite with seed photons from a mcd component , as adopted by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . by considering that a part of the mcd photons can escape without being comptonized",
    ", the model is expressed as _",
    "thcomp + diskbb _ in the xspec terminology .",
    "the innermost temperature of seed photons input to the _ thcomp _ model and that of the mcd component is tied each other .",
    "we find that , while it gives a reasonable fit to the data below @xmath2550 kev , a significant excess remains above this energy , indicating the presence of a non - thermal tail as discovered with osse @xcite and _ integral _ @xcite .",
    "accordingly , by adding a power law component ( and its reflection ) to the above model , we obtain an acceptable fit ( @xmath125/dof = 344/350 ) from the broad band spectra in the stable state .",
    "this result indicates that the spectrum can basically be represented with comptonization of disk photons both by thermal and non - thermal electrons .",
    "the power - law description of non - thermal comptonization is unphysical , however , since it must breaks at energies of seed photons in reality .    as a more physically self - consistent model of comptonization",
    ", we finally adopt the _ eqpair _ model developed by @xcite , instead of _ thcomp_. it was adopted by @xcite and @xcite to fit the _ rxte _  and osse spectra of grs 1915 + 105  in classes  @xmath0 , @xmath127 , and @xmath128 successfully .",
    "this model computes comptonization from a hybrid plasma consisting of thermal and non - thermal electrons , where the physical processes are self - consistently solved with an energy input of accelerated electrons in a background thermal plasma .",
    "the model parameters are ( 1 ) the optical depth for scattering @xmath83 , ( 2 ) compactness parameters , defined as @xmath129 , where @xmath130 is a power supplied to the plasma and that in seed photons , @xmath131 thomson cross section , @xmath132 the plasma size , @xmath133 the electron mass , and ( 3 ) its ratio between non - thermal and thermal electrons , @xmath134 , where @xmath135 .",
    "the injected non - thermal electrons have a power law energy distribution between the lorentz factors @xmath136 and @xmath137 with an index of @xmath88 . in the spectral",
    "fitting , we fix @xmath138 , @xmath139 , @xmath140 . in this model",
    ", the energy balance between compton and coulomb interactions determines the temperature of thermal electrons , which is automatically calculated from the given parameters .",
    "we find the _ eqpair + diskbb _ model , with the reflection of the former component , provides an excellent description of the continuum in all four states .",
    "the direct mcd component is required in the stable and oscillation - high states with the f - test probability of @xmath141 and @xmath142 , respectively .",
    "although it is not significant in the oscillation - med and low states , we include this component for consistency .",
    "figure  5 plot the unfolded spectra in units of @xmath143 , where @xmath144 is the energy flux . the comptonized component , mcd model , and the reflection component including the iron - k emission line , are separately plotted .",
    "the best - fit continuum parameters are summarized in table  2 , together with the observed 210 kev and 1050 kev fluxes and absorption - corrected 0.01100 kev luminosities for the comptonization and mcd component , where a spherical and disk geometry is assumed , respectively . for the oscillation med and low states , we fix @xmath145 , the best - fit value obtained in the oscillation high state , since it is difficult to constrain the slope without the coverage above 50 kev in these states .",
    "with _ suzaku _ , we obtained high quality broad band x - ray spectra of grs 1915 + 105  over the 2120 kev band both in the stable ( class  @xmath0 ) and oscillation states ( class  @xmath1 ) , covered with ccd energy resolution ( fwhm @xmath25120 ev at 6 kev ) below 10 kev .",
    "the best estimated interstellar absorption and dust scattering effects are taken into account in the spectral fitting , which have been ignored in most of previous studies of grs 1915 + 105 .",
    "in particular , we caution that without correct modeling of the absorption with over iron abundances , one can easily reach wrong conclusions on the iron - k emission line profile that requires very careful analysis of the continuum shape .",
    "the best - fit models in units of @xmath143 _ corrected for the interstellar absorption and scattering _ are plotted in figure  6 for the four states .",
    "below , we interpret our results based on the iron - k features and continuum model .",
    "we find that the iron - k features in the oscillation low state are very similar to those in the `` soft state '' ( steady state  a ) of grs 1915 + 105  detected by @xcite using _ chandra_/hetgs .",
    "this may be expected , since our oscillation low state mostly corresponds to state  a , though not in a steady state .",
    "corrected for the interstellar absorption and dust - scattering in the four states . from upper",
    "to lower ( at 20 kev ) , oscillation - high ( red ) , stable ( cyan ) , oscillation - med ( green ) , and oscillation - low state ( blue ) . ]",
    "we detect significant iron - k emission lines , direct evidence for the reflection , in the stable , oscillation - med , and oscillation - low states .",
    "the line profiles indicate that the reflector is moderately ionized ( log @xmath146 ) and is located far away from the black hole as constrained by its `` narrow '' line width ; it is most probably the outer parts of the accretion disk , whose inner radius is estimated to be @xmath147 by assuming an emissivity law of @xmath148 .",
    "this does not mean that the disk must be truncated at that location .",
    "if the scale height of the central source is smaller compared with that of the outer disk , then the emissivity law is better expressed with an index lower than 3 , which would yield a much smaller inner radius .",
    "the absence of a relativistic broad iron - k line is consistent with the picture that the innermost part of the disk is covered by an optically thick hot plasma , smearing out any emission features due to strong comptonization .    during the limit - cycle oscillation ,",
    "the ew of the iron - k emission line ( see table  2 ) is the largest in the oscillation low state .",
    "it decreases with x - ray flux , and the line _ disappears _ in the oscillation high state .",
    "the change of the ionization parameter , determined by the x - ray luminosity , is expected to be within a factor of 3 during the oscillation .",
    "hence , we must attribute this change mainly to the variability in the solid angle of the reflector as seen by the central source . in the stable state ,",
    "the solid angle is small @xmath149 as well , similar to that found in the oscillation med state .",
    "we interpret that this is the first observational evidence for `` self - shielding '' effects of the inner part of the accretion disk .",
    "the dynamical structure of outer parts of the accretion disk , @xmath150 , can not be changed on a time scale of the limit - cycle , @xmath251000 sec , much shorter than that of viscosity @xcite .",
    "therefore , the only possible mechanism that can dramatically reduce the observed reflection strength in the oscillation - high state must be related to the geometry in the central source ; most of the continuum x - ray emission seen by an observer ( i.e. , with @xmath17 ) does not reach the outer parts of the disk in this state .",
    "as we describe later , the inner accretion disk is covered by hot corona responsible for comptonization .",
    "our observations imply that the inner part of the disk becomes geometrically thick in the oscillation high state , and comptonized photons are shielded by the surrounding cool region of the expanded disk when viewed at a very high inclination angle from the outer disk .",
    "the evolution of the disk geometry is in accordance with theoretical prediction of the slim disk @xcite and numerical simulation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "as have been revealed by previous studies @xcite , absorption lines of highly ionized ions indicate the presence of a disk wind in the line - of - sight between the continuum emitter and the observer .",
    "the disk wind has a velocity of @xmath151 km @xmath152 and is most likely launched at outer parts of the disk , @xmath153 @xcite , by irradiation from the central source . during the limit cycle ,",
    "the absorption lines are the deepest in the oscillation - low state and become weaker as the hard x - ray flux increases .",
    "this strongly supports the photoionization of the wind ; the corresponding ionization parameters estimated from the population ratio between and are consistent with the change of the luminosity ( based on an xstar simulation ; @xcite ) .",
    "the self - shielding is not relevant for photo - ionization , as the wind we observe is located 20@xmath60 above the disk plane .",
    "the wind is most probably developed by the strong x - ray irradiation in the oscillation - low state , as indicated by its strong iron - k emission line .",
    "once a disk wind is launched , it will travel over a time scale of @xmath154 sec , and hence we can approximate that the same disk wind steadily exists during the limit cycles .    in the stable state , we do not detect any iron - k absorption lines .",
    "this suggests three possibilities ; ( 1 ) the wind is not developed , ( 2 ) the wind is fully ionized , or ( 3 ) the scale height of the disk wind is too low to be observed .",
    "we consider the first possibility unlikely because the absorption lines have been detected in the same class  @xmath0 state even when the hard x - ray flux is lower than in our observation @xcite . indeed",
    ", the presence of iron - k emission line suggests that illumination of the outer parts of the disk does occur , which can trigger the launch of the wind .",
    "the second possibility can not be ruled out , if the density of the wind is much smaller than that develops in the oscillation states .",
    "then , the ionization parameter may become sufficiently large to be fully ionized , even if the luminosity is smaller than that in the oscillation - high state .",
    "the third possibility is also plausible .",
    "we have shown that the broad band spectra in all the four states can be commonly explained by comptonization of seed disk photons off optically - thick ( @xmath155 ) , low temperature ( @xmath15623 kev ) , non - thermal hybrid plasmas .",
    "similar results are obtained by @xcite in another state of grs 1915 + 105  ( class  @xmath127 or state  b ) .",
    "these findings indicate that the optically thick and low temperature comptonization are common features in accretion flows at high eddington fractions , as suggested by @xcite and @xcite . in the stable and oscillation - high states , we find that the fractional power supplied to non - thermal electrons is quite large ( @xmath157 ) and the slope of the electron energy distribution is steep ( @xmath15834 ) compared with the results reported from other data of grs 1915 + 105  @xcite .",
    "this may be related to the high luminosities in those states ( @xmath159 erg s@xmath34 ) .",
    "figure  7 plots the absorption - corrected @xmath143 spectrum in the stable state with the separate contribution from the mcd , reflection , and purely `` thermal '' comptonization component that would be observed without non - thermal electrons .",
    "this illustrates the importance of non - thermal processes in these data .",
    "spectrum in the stable state corrected for the interstellar absorption and dust - scattering .",
    "the thick solid curve ( red ) represents the total , the dashed curve ( cyan ) the direct mcd component , the dot - dashed curve ( black ) the reflection component , and the thin solid curve ( blue ) thermal comptonization component that would be observed without non - thermal electrons . ]    with the _ eqpair _ modeling , we find that a direct mcd component is necessary in addition to the comptonized emission in the stable and oscillation - high states , assuming the same temperature for the seed photons and mcd component .",
    "this implies that ( case i ) the comptonizing plasmas are patchy over the disk , or ( case ii ) they are located inside a `` truncation radius '' of the standard disk . in reality , such truncation would be smooth ; the disk may gradually change into the `` disk+corona '' region , as suggested for the very high state of canonical black hole binaries ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in case",
    "ii , the assumption of the same spectrum for the direct mcd and seed photons do not hold , and a disk radius derived from such a simple model may be largely overestimated from the true disk size if the energetics coupling between the disk and corona is taken into account@xcite .    from the observed flux and innermost temperature obtained from the fit",
    ", we can estimate the innermost radius of the accretion disk both for the direct mcd component ( @xmath90 ) and that of the seed photons for the comptonized component ( @xmath160 ) .",
    "we calculate @xmath161 by assuming the conservation of photon numbers in the comptonization process , according to the formula ( a1 ) of @xcite with the left - hand term increased by a factor of two for the optically thick case .",
    "the resultant values of @xmath90 and @xmath162 are listed in table  2 , without any corrections for the boundary condition and color / effective temperature , which would increase the radius by a factor of @xmath181.2 @xcite . in case i",
    ", @xmath163 corresponds to the true innermost radius corrected for the partial coverage by comptonizing clouds .",
    "we find evidence for the evolution of @xmath95 during the oscillation , which increases from @xmath18210 km in the oscillation - high state to @xmath25400 km in the oscillation - med / low states , although the significance of the change is marginal due to the large uncertainties in the latter states .",
    "they correspond to @xmath164 and @xmath165 , respectively , by assuming the black hole mass of 14 .",
    "this implies that an inner disk forms as accumulated matter rapidly accretes onto the black hole in the flare phase .",
    "such variation of the disk radius during limit - cycle oscillations has been reported based on simple mcd + power law fitting ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although we obtain larger radii than these studies that refer only to the mcd component by ignoring comptonized photons .",
    "in the stable state , the radius ( @xmath166420 km ) is significantly larger than that in the oscillation - high state .",
    "thus , if case  i is true , our results suggest that the standard disk does not extend down to the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) regardless of the black hole spin in all our states , unlike in some cases of the `` soft state '' of grs 1915 + 105@xcite .",
    "such low - temperature / high - luminosity disk emission that leads to an apparently large disk radius is observed in the very high state of other black hole binaries @xcite , when the eddington ratio is higher than that in the high / soft state . at even higher eddington fractions that trigger limit cycles , as in our case",
    ", the situation may be the same as in the canonical very high state .",
    "the comptonization parameters also show significant change during the limit - cycle oscillation , besides the disk radius ( and disk temperature ) as discussed above . in the oscillation high state ,",
    "the fractional power supplied to non - thermal electrons becomes the largest ( @xmath167 ) and the electron temperature highest ( @xmath168 kev ) , which decreases to @xmath169 and @xmath170 kev in the oscillation - low state , respectively .",
    "thus , in the flare phase , very efficient particle acceleration must occur by converting the gravitational energy of accreting mass .",
    "this may increase the temperature of thermal electrons and expand the size of the corona . as the corona becomes geometrically thick ,",
    "the `` self - shielding '' effect starts to work , preventing the comptonized photons from irradiating the outer part of the accretion disk ( i.e. , little reflection signals ) .",
    "a similar situation ( geometrically thick corona ) may be realized in the stable state as well , where the reflection strength is weaker compared with the oscillation low states .    to summarize , with the simple spectra model presented above , we show that the dramatic change of x - ray flux and spectra during the limit - cycle oscillation can be explained mainly by ( 1 ) the evolution of the disk geometry and ( 2 ) that of physical parameters of comptonizing corona , particularly the fractional power supplied to non - thermal electrons .",
    "we note , however , that the assumption of the mcd model ( i.e. , standard disk ) in all states and that of the same temperature for the seed photons of comptonization would be oversimplification .",
    "for instance , disk instability theories predict that a slim disk appears in the oscillation high state @xcite , which predicts different spectra from the mcd model .",
    "this is not ruled out from the current simple analysis .",
    "nevertheless , we stress that the role of comptonization becomes very important in determining the whole dynamics and energy spectra of black hole accretion disks at high mass accretion rates , which must be taken into account in any theoretical studies .",
    "1 .   we find that the _ suzaku _  broad band spectra of grs 1915 + 105  band both in the stable ( class  @xmath0 ) and oscillation states ( class  @xmath1 ) are commonly represented with a model consisting of a mcd model and its comptonization with a reflection component , over which the opacity of the disk wind ( including iron - k absorption lines ) is applied .",
    "the comptonized component dominates the flux above @xmath253 kev .",
    "the comptonization is made by optically - thick ( @xmath2 710 ) , non - thermal / thermal ( @xmath171 23 kev ) hybrid plasmas .",
    "the non - thermal electrons are produced with 1060% of the total energy input to the plasma with a power law index of @xmath1834 , which account for the hard x - ray tail above @xmath2550 kev .",
    "3 .   during the limit - cycle oscillation ,",
    "the reflection strength , estimated by the iron - k emission line , is the largest during the dip phase but disappears in the flare phase .",
    "we interpret this as evidence for self - shielding effects that comptonized photons are obscured by the surrounding cool region of the expanded disk when viewed at a very high inclination angle from the outer disk .",
    "the evolution of the disk geometry is in accordance with theoretical predictions .",
    "the disk wind , traced by iron - k absorption lines of and , always exists during the oscillation and its ionization well correlates with the x - ray flux .",
    "this supports the photoionization origin . in the stable state ,",
    "the iron - k absorption lines are not detected probably because it is highly ionized and/or the scale height is small .",
    "the disk parameters suggest that the inner disk structure is similar to that in the very high state of black hole binaries .",
    "the spectral variability in the oscillation state is explained by the change of the disk geometry and of physical parameters of comptonizing corona , particularly the fractional power supplied to the acceleration of non - thermal particles .",
