    "<S> this is consistent with the fact that the holon is not localized in the one - dimensional case . </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to notice that even without the phase string effect , @xmath89 and @xmath101 behave distinctly for the @xmath104-@xmath5 model . </S>",
    "<S> the former @xmath102 , while the latter @xmath105 , also indicating a spin - charge separation although the distinction is much less dramatic as compared to the @xmath11-@xmath5 model .    </S>",
    "<S> the presence of spin - charge separation enriches substantially the behavior of the hole localized states in the @xmath11-@xmath5 ladder systems . </S>",
    "<S> due to the residual spin - charge interaction , the degenerate charge localized states are superposed to form a more extended  distribution to minimize the spinon energy . </S>",
    "<S> it has been shown @xcite that generally the dmrg method tends to pick up a _ minimally entangled _ </S>",
    "<S> state among quasi - degenerate states . </S>",
    "<S> thus , spatially localized ones such as those in  fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eg ] are naturally obtained because a further spinon energy gain for a bigger fwhm would be too tiny to be detected with a given small dmrg truncation error . </S>",
    "<S> it also explains why the fwhm of charge distribution shown in  figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eg ] and [ scseparation ] is usually bigger than the intrinsic localization length @xmath106 as exhibited by @xmath101 . </S>",
    "<S> but the former is still valid to characterize the general trend of the localization , say , as a function of the leg number in  fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eg ] . on the other hand , by adding some weak local chemical potentials , the quasi - degeneracy of the hole states can be lifted such that the hole density profile is truly localized around the impurities at different locations [ as indicated by different colored curves in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ scseparation](d ) for a @xmath107 ladder ] . here </S>",
    "<S> the increase of the total energy of the original @xmath11-@xmath5 hamiltonian is weak ( about @xmath108 ) , presumably from the spinon part as the fwhm is still larger than @xmath106 .    _ </S>",
    "<S> discussions. _ phase string , charge localization , and spin - charge separation are striking results of a single - hole - doped mott insulator . </S>",
    "<S> they are truly incompatible with a quasiparticle description . however , for their novel effects to get fully unveiled , a large sample is needed . </S>",
    "<S> instead of tackling directly a two - dimensional square lattice , in this work , we have chosen ladders that dmrg can access . </S>",
    "<S> as it turns out , very surprising consequences do show up so long as the ladders are long enough , _ and _ , there are more than one paths to realize quantum interference , e.g. , in a two - leg system .    </S>",
    "<S> the most essential physics underlying the observed exotic phenomena is that the motion of the single hole acquires a sequence of signs that precisely and permanently record each microscopic _ hole - hopping - spin - backflow _ event in the quantum spin background . </S>",
    "<S> these irreparable phase strings cause singular and destructive interference of quantum waves of the charge . </S>",
    "<S> the longer the paths are , the stronger the destructive interference is . </S>",
    "<S> the present results show unequivocally that the self - localization of the charge is a combined effect of quantum interference and multiple scattering between the doped charge and spin background , in analogy to anderson localization @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> contrary to this , the charge remains delocalized in the single chain case due to the lack of quantum interference involving _ different _ paths .    </S>",
    "<S> the charge localization is further found to be concomitant with spin - charge separation for the two and more - leg ladders . </S>",
    "<S> whereas the phase string renders kinetic energy suppression of the charge , the spin associated with the doped hole remains unfrustrated and thus maintains a coherent motion as a spinon . </S>",
    "<S> this has been clearly demonstrated by the distinct finite - size effects of the charge and spin degrees of freedom . in this sense , </S>",
    "<S> the electron fractionalization found in the single hole case can be attributed to the energetic reason . </S>",
    "<S> note that the cause for charge localization , i.e. , the nontrivial phase string effect , requires an uncertainty of the spin quantum associated with the spin backflow ( leading to the @xmath109 signs ) . </S>",
    "<S> if _ each _ spin backflow could maintain a definite spin polarization direction , the phase string effect would become trivial . </S>",
    "<S> simultaneously the hole would also carry a definite spin as a quasiparticle . </S>",
    "<S> but such a spin - charge recombination , being extremely tight in space , would cost too much kinetic energy .    </S>",
    "<S> this is fundamentally different from the premise for a spin polaron picture  a conventional wisdom in which the disturbance of the hole hopping to the spin background is described by virtual spin excitations that eventually relax back after the hole moves away . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the spin - polaron or quasiparticle behavior has been shown to be recovered once the phase string is switched off  in the so - called @xmath30-@xmath5 model , where everything seems normal  in a conventional sense . here a spin - charge recombination ( not too tight spatially ) with a good kinetic energy for the quasiparticle can be realized since there is no more singular phase string effect to strongly suppress the kinetic energy of the charge .    </S>",
    "<S> our results have far - reaching consequences . </S>",
    "<S> first of all , they suggest that a new state of quantum matter may naturally emerge in sufficiently low doping . </S>",
    "<S> such a state is insulating because of the self - localization of doped charges , not because of a charge gap like in the undoped case . </S>",
    "<S> this is a novel non - anderson - type localization phenomenon since external disorders are absent . </S>",
    "<S> secondly , the strong suppression of the kinetic energy results in a large quasi - degeneracy in the low - energy states . </S>",
    "<S> it is expected to lead to a glassy  behavior in the presence of weak external impurities and a competing - order  phenomenon in the presence of additional weak interactions . </S>",
    "<S> it also provides a possible explanation for the strongly localized state induced by a surface defect observed in the scanning tunneling microscope experiment on @xmath110 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thirdly , the spin background remains essentially the same as at half - filling , but the spinons fractionalized from the doped holes will play an important role to determine the low - energy , long - wavelength sector of spin dynamics in the lightly doping . finally , given that phase strings have been proved @xcite rigorously as the sole sign structure in the @xmath11-@xmath5 model on bipartite lattices , regardless of doping concentration , temperature , and dimensions </S>",
