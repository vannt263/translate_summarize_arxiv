    "more than 50 years ago , t.  h.  r.  skyrme proposed his pioneering idea that one may identify a certain nontrivial topological field configuration ( soliton ) in mesonic theory with the baryon  @xcite .",
    "since then , this idea has been extensively applied in particle physics , nuclear physics , and also condensed matter physics  @xcite .",
    "the originally proposed skyrme model include only the degree of freedom of the pion .",
    "motivated by the essential roles of meson resonances such as the rho meson , omega meson , and light scalar mesons in nuclear physics , researchers extended the skyrme model to skyrme - type models to include such resonances  @xcite .",
    "recently , especially after the appearance of holographic models of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , the effects of some resonances on the skyrmion properties were widely explored .",
    "some key points related to the present work are summarized as follows : ( i ) by dimensionally deconstructing a yang - mills theory in a flat four - dimensional space in the large @xmath1 limit , it was found that as more isovector vector resonances are included , the soliton becomes lighter  @xcite ; ( ii ) by using a chiral effective theory of vector mesons based on the hidden local symmetry ( hls ) approach written up to the next - to - leading order , the omega meson that enters the chiral effective theory through the homogeneous wess - zumino term was found to provide a strong repulsive force  @xcite ; ( iii ) a scalar meson that is regarded as the nambu - goldstone boson associated with spontaneous breaking of the scale symmetry , i.e. , the dilaton , was introduced to investigate its attractive effect  @xcite .",
    "it was found that the dilaton can provide an attractive force of about @xmath2mev in the model , which can reproduce chiral restoration in matter .    in this paper",
    ", we explore the effect of scalar mesons made of two quarks and four quarks on the mass and size of the skyrmion by first constructing a chiral effective model including the pion , the rho meson , the omega meson , and two - quark and four - quark scalar mesons .",
    "then , determining the parameters of the model through meson dynamics , we study the effects of the masses and constituents of the scalar mesons , as well as the strength of an interaction among the vector and scalar mesons , on the mass and size of the skyrmion .",
    "our findings can be summarized as follows :    1 .   when we switch off mixing between the two - quark and four - quark states in the model , the four - quark scalar state decouples from the model .",
    "the light scalar meson is a pure two - quark state .",
    "in such a case , we find that : 1 .",
    "the soliton mass and size decrease with increasing mass of the light scalar meson .",
    "the soliton mass depends on the coupling strength between the light scalar meson and the vector mesons .",
    "the result shows that the soliton mass and the size of the baryon number density increase when the coupling strength increases .",
    "when we switch on mixing between the two - quark and four - quark states in the model , we find that , when the two - quark component of the lighter scalar meson is increased , the soliton mass becomes small and its size becomes large .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the next section describes how we construct the chiral effective model that we use in this paper and explains its typical features in relation to this work . in sec .",
    "3 , we calculate the skyrmion properties numerically and analyze the effects of scalar mesons on them . the last section discusses the results we obtained and presents our conclusions . in the appendixes , we give some details of the calculation .",
    "we start by constructing a chiral effective model including two - quark and four - quark scalar states . here , we limit our discussion to the mesons , including up and down quarks . in our model , we introduce a two - quark field @xmath3 that is schematically written at the quark level as @xmath4 where @xmath5 are the flavor indices .",

    "therefore , the hadron field @xmath3 transforms as @xmath18 we introduce a four - quark field that is schematically written at the quark level as @xmath19 in this work , we regard @xmath20 as a real field by considering only the real part of eq .",

    "we require that the number of fields in each vertex derived from the potential @xmath23 is less than or equal to four , and the number of quarks included in each vertex is less than or equal to eight  @xcite .",
