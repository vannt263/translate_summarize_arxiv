    "direct numerical simulations of turbulent skin friction drag reduction are necessarily done at moderate reynolds numbers ( @xmath1 ) . until recently , the hope that theories justified by comparisons with such calculations can be extrapolated to much larger @xmath1 typical for flight regime , was based on the idea of the universality of near - wall turbulence , where the skin friction is primarily generated .",
    "this hope suffered a serious blow with the discovery of the emergence , at sufficiently large @xmath2 of a secondary peak in the pre - multiplied energy spectra map of the streamwise velocity component , namely the `` outer - peak ''  ( see for example * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "empirical fits based on the latest data ( @xcite ) suggest that at high @xmath1 more turbulence kinetic energy is contained in large - scale structures than in the near - wall region where the inner - peak is located . in the past decade or so , the large - scale structures and their interaction with near - wall turbulence have attracted much attention ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite , and even this list is far from complete ) . in particular , it has been shown that the large - scale structures associated with the log - layer significantly affect the near - wall turbulence . @xcite and @xcite have observed that these large - scale motions impose a substantial `` footprint '' all the way down to the wall , and this has been confirmed in recent direct numerical simulations ( dns ) of evolving boundary layers ( rl & schlatter 2011 ) . this footprint is seen as a long - wavelength component superimposed onto the small - scale near - wall fluctuations .",
    "further , @xcite and @xcite demonstrated that the large - scale motions are not merely superimposed near the wall , but also amplitude modulate the small - scale motions , and developed a tool to quantify the degree of modulation . based on the above observations , marusic and colleagues developed a simple quantitative model of the effect of large - scale structures onto the near - wall turbulence ( marusic _ et al . _",
    "2010 ; mathis _ et al . _",
    "2011 ) , and from here on we refer to these papers as mhm . in this model the effect of the large - scale structures is expressed as a combination of an amplitude modulation and superposition of the large - scales onto the near - wall small - scales .",
    "the amplitude modulation factor and the superimposed additive term were approximated as linear functions of the low - pass - filtered velocity in the logarithmic layer .",
    "the model was shown to reconstruct a statistical representation of the near - wall fluctuating streamwise velocity component , as well as the fluctuating skin - friction , with good accuracy over a large range of @xmath3    in the present paper we demonstrate that the modulation effect as observed in an experiment can be derived from a simple hypothesis .",
    "the classical view on the universality of near - wall turbulence consists in the statement that all the flow variables , if expressed in wall units , are independent of the reynolds number . for skin friction",
    "@xmath4 this means that @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a universal function of its arguments in the sense that all its statistics are independent of @xmath2 @xmath7 is the mean skin friction , @xmath8 @xmath9 is the kinematic viscosity , @xmath10 is the density , and @xmath11 @xmath12 and @xmath13 are time and coordinates in the plane of the wall .",
    "note that all the quantities here are the total values : in this paper fluctuations will always be explicitly marked with prime or tilde .",
    "note that the time average of @xmath14 equals one : @xmath15    the experimentally observed effect of large - scale structures on the near wall turbulence is in contradiction with ( [ eqn : universalityoftau ] ) .",
    "we propose therefore to replace ( [ eqn : universalityoftau ] ) with a formula recognising the dependence of the skin friction on the large scale effects . our proposal might be reminiscent of the transition from the famous kolmogorov-41 theory to kolmogorov-62 theory in the isotropic turbulence , but we will not further comment on this similarity .",
    "the proposed hypothesis consists in the statement that the effect of large scale structures on the near - wall turbulence is limited to replacing @xmath7 ( and , correspondingly , @xmath16 ) in ( [ eqn : universalityoftau ] ) with slowly - varying @xmath17 ( and @xmath18 ) : @xmath19 the slowly - varying component of the wall skin friction can be extracted from the full skin friction by a suitable filtering procedure . a quasi - steady effect described by ( [ eqn : taumodulated ] ) can naturally be called a modulation of near - wall turbulence by large - scale structures .",
    "we will now try to verify the hypothesis ( [ eqn : taumodulated ] ) by comparing it with the available experimental data .",
    "note that in marusic _ et al .",
    "_  ( 2011 ) the modulation was understood somewhat differently , and it was described in terms of fluctuations . to compare ,",
    "we rewrite ( [ eqn : taumodulated ] ) in terms of fluctuations , with @xmath20 ( for brevity we will omit arguments of @xmath14 ) . assuming that @xmath21 and @xmath14 are not correlated , we also have @xmath22 .",
    "then @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "substituting these formulae into ( [ eqn : taumodulated ] ) and rearranging gives @xmath25    compare this with equation ( 1 ) in marusic _ et al .",
    "_  ( 2011 ) , which has the form @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the fluctuating large - scale signal from the log region , and we added primes to fluctuation quantities , to bring it closer to our notation ( subscript `` @xmath28 '' describing a predicted quantity ) .",
    "one can see that if our explanation of the modulation is true , then @xmath29 and @xmath30 that is @xmath31 and @xmath32 should be equal .",
    "in marusic _ et al . _  ( 2011 ) these quantities were found independently from experiment using very different procedures , and it was obtained that @xmath33 and @xmath34 the small difference between these values gives the first confirmation of our interpretation of the modulation effect .",
    "the classical view on the universality of velocity distribution gives : @xmath35 the idea of modulation can now be expressed again as a statement that the effect of large scale structures on the near - wall velocity distribution is limited to introducing into the above formula a dependence of @xmath7 or , more conveniently in this case , the corresponding dependence of @xmath16 on time , with the related assumption that the variation of these quantities is much slower than the variation of @xmath36    @xmath37    accordingly , this means that the large scale structure effect amounts to the amplitude modulation of the universal total ( not fluctuating ) velocity @xmath38 via the factor @xmath39 a frequency modulation due to what in fact is the time - dependence of the wall units in the expression @xmath40 and a scale modulation due to the time - dependence of the wall units in @xmath41 @xmath42 and @xmath43 in treating the skin friction in section  [ sec : skinfriction ] , as far as the random mean square of the skin friction fluctuation was concerned , the frequency and scale modulation could be ignored because the skin friction random mean square is actually independent of time and spatial coordinates . in the present case , this is true only for the frequency and scale modulation in the wall - parallel directions .",
    "when , as a result of the variation of @xmath44 the wall - normal non - dimensional distance @xmath45 varies , so does the random mean square .",
    "for this reason in what follows we will frequently omit the @xmath40 @xmath41 and @xmath46 arguments of @xmath47 but we will often keep @xmath43    it is also convenient to introduce new variables reflecting the frequency and scale modulation , namely @xmath48 note the difference between @xmath49 and @xmath50 and the variables in wall units , defined similarly but with the time - averaged value of the friction velocity @xmath51 @xmath52    our goal is to rewrite ( [ universaltotalvelocity ] ) in fluctuations and to compare it with the formula given in mhm .    let us introduce the universal mean profile as @xmath53 and the universal velocity fluctuation function @xmath54 note that both the average and the fluctuation are introduced here with @xmath55 held constant as time varies . where the velocity at a fixed distance @xmath56 to the wall will be considered , the argument of @xmath38 will be @xmath50 , which is varying in time , and not @xmath57 this is why a tilde and not a prime is used to mark a fluctuation in ( [ eqn : universalfluctuation ] ) .",
    "note now the due to the separation of time scales of near - wall turbulence and large scale structures @xmath58 the assumption of the separation of time scales can be formalised and then the above statement can be proved formally , but in this paper we will focus at the level of relating to the physical understanding .",
    "introducing the fluctuation of the friction velocity @xmath59 one can write @xmath60 due to the separation of scales @xmath61 hence the velocity average is @xmath62 and its fluctuation , expressed in wall units , is @xmath63    the corresponding formula in mhm has the form @xmath64 in which we include primes where appropriate , and have added the subscript @xmath65 to @xmath31 and @xmath32 to distinguish them from @xmath31 and @xmath32 of section  [ sec : skinfriction ] .",
    "both these formulae represent the velocity fluctuation as a fast varying term multiplied by a slowly varying ( depending only on large scale structure ) amplitude modulation term plus a slowly varying superposition term .",
    "we might now try to associate @xmath66 with @xmath27 similar to section  [ sec : skinfriction ]",
    ". however , there are two difficulties here .",
    "first , in mhm @xmath67 was chosen in such a way that @xmath68 is not amplitude - modulated by the large scale structures .",
    "more precisely , @xmath67 is chosen in such a way as to minimize the effect of large scale structures on the random mean square of the fast - varying term .",
    "this can be reproduced in our formula by introducing the mean square of @xmath69 as @xmath70 and assuming that @xmath71 note that the right hand - side of ( [ eqn : ustarmhm ] ) is frequency modulated via @xmath72 while mhm did not mention frequency modulation .",
    "the same is true for scale modulation via @xmath73 and @xmath74 this would make a difference where , for example , the spectra are concerned . however , for random mean square this difference does not matter . then ( [ eqn : fulluprimemodulationa ] ) takes the form @xmath75    the second difficulty is that if we now try to relate the modulation factor and the superposition term to @xmath27 , at least one of them will have to depend on @xmath27 nonlinearly , while in ( [ eqn : mathiseqtwopointone ] ) these relations are both linear . noting that @xmath76 and linearizing under the assumption that @xmath77 gives @xmath78 +   \\left(u^*(z^+)+z^+\\frac{du^*(z^+)}{dz^+}\\right ) \\frac{u_{\\tau_l}'(t)}{\\bar u_\\tau}\\ ] ]    from the relationship between @xmath4 and @xmath79 after linearization one gets @xmath80 from section  [ sec : skinfriction ] we also have @xmath81 hence",
    ", @xmath82 with this substitution , comparing ( [ eqn : mathiseqtwopointone ] ) and ( [ eqn : lineariseduprimemodulation ] ) gives @xmath83 and @xmath84    [ bc][][1][-90]@xmath85 [ br]theory [ br]experiment   @xmath85 , and @xmath86 @xmath67 , respectively from equations  ( [ eqn : alphau ] ) and  ( [ eqn : betau ] ) with values found experimentally in mathis _",

    "so far , the skin friction superposition coefficient @xmath31 was considered as a constant measured in experiment independently of all other quantities .",
    "given its value , our theory established the relationship between the universal mean velocity profile and universal random - mean - square velocity fluctuation profile and the functions @xmath94 and @xmath95 for the purposes of comparisons in figures  [ fig : alpha]@xmath93 and  [ fig : alpha]@xmath86 the experimentally measured value of @xmath31 was used .",
    "one further step can be made if , in the spirit of the classical method of matched asymptotic expansions , one recognises that the logarithmic layer is , in fact , a part of the inner distinguished limit . because of that , the relationship ( [ eqn : lineariseduprimemodulation ] ) , which is valid in the inner limit should also be valid in the logarithmic layer . in mhm the large scale signal @xmath96",
    "was chosen to be the low - pass filtered velocity @xmath97 at a position in the logarithmic layer at @xmath98 . applying the low - pass filter to ( [ eqn : lineariseduprimemodulation ] )",
    "removes the fast - varying term .",
    "substituting @xmath99 and using ( [ eqn : utaualphauolrel ] ) gives ,    @xmath100 cancelling out @xmath96 one obtains    @xmath101    since @xmath102 is inside the logarithmic layer , one can take @xmath103 with @xmath104 and @xmath105 ( @xcite ) .",
    "this gives @xmath106    [ bc][][1][-90]@xmath85 [ br]@xmath107 [ br]experiment [ br]dns   with the wall - normal location of @xmath102.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=75.0% ]    figure  [ fig : alphatrend ] shows the comparison for @xmath31 calculated from ( [ eqn : alpha ] ) along with values obtained from experiments and dns data .",
    "it is seen that the value of @xmath31 derived here depends on the choice of the wall - normal location @xmath102 at which the large - scales signal is taken .",
    "this result is consistent with mhm since the coefficient @xmath31 is proportional to the coefficient correlation @xmath108 , and is thus known to depend on the location of the outer - probe ( brown & thomas ; marusic & heuer 2007 ) .",
    "in this paper we have investigated the simplest theoretical description of the phenomenon of modulation of near - wall turbulence by large scale structures associated with the logarithmic layer . in this description",
    "the effect of large scale structures is limited to a quasi - steady response of the near - wall turbulence to slow large - scale fluctuations of the skin friction .",
    "the most natural and compact form of expressing this mechanism is given by ( [ eqn : taumodulated ] ) and ( [ universaltotalvelocity ] ) , which are simply the usual reynolds - number - independent representation of total skin friction and velocity in wall variables but with mean skin friction replaced by large - scale low - pass - filtered fluctuating skin friction .",
    "this mechanism manifests itself both in amplitude modulation and superposition , introduced in previous works , and frequency and wavenumber modulation which has not been considered before .",
    "when rewritten in terms of fluctuations and linearised with an assumption that the large - scale fluctuation of the skin friction is small as compared to the mean skin friction , our formulae coincide with the formulae proposed by mhm . however , an additional feature here is that in the proposed theory the skin friction superposition and modulation constants @xmath31 and @xmath32 and the analogous functions @xmath94 and @xmath109 for the velocity distributions are expressed explicitly via the universal mean velocity profile , and the universal random mean square fluctuation velocity profile . in mhm these",
    "were obtained purely from experiments .",
    "the predicted values of @xmath31 and @xmath32 agree reasonably well with the values obtained experimentally .",
    "the agreement for @xmath94 and @xmath109 is also encouraging , especially if one takes into account the error introduced by the linearization .",
    "the linearization was needed , of course , only in order to be able to make the comparisons .",
    "it is more appropriate and might be easier to use the exact theoretical formulae .",
    "as far as the comparisons are concerned , one should also note that the theory is applicable only in the inner layer , including the log layer , and that the theoretical results expressed in wall units are independent of the reynolds number .",
    "the way @xmath67 was defined in experiments ( mhm ) was such that @xmath110 that is @xmath67 is dependent on the reynolds number at least near the largest values of its argument , which , therefore , is outside the region of applicability of the theory .",
    "overall , the comparisons strongly support the theory .",
    "it is of interest to note the simple physical mechanism that leads to the reduction , and even possible change of sign , of the amplitude modulation of the turbulence kinetic energy of small - scale fluctuations as the distance from the wall increases .",
    "an increase in the large - scale velocity has two effects .",
    "first , it increases the skin friction , and that leads to an increase in the turbulence kinetic energy of small - scale fluctuations .",
    "hence , the first effect creates a positive correlation between the large - scale velocity and small - scale turbulence intensity .",
    "second , an increase in the skin friction leads to a decrease in the thickness of the inner region . as a result , at a fixed physical distance from the wall the value of @xmath55 increases .",
    "if this point happens to be in the region where the turbulence kinetic energy of small - scale fluctuations decreases with @xmath55 , this second effect will decrease the degree of amplitude modulation , thus contributing negatively to the correlation .",
    "more accurate information on the universal distribution of the turbulence kinetic energy of small - scale fluctuations would be needed in order to confirm if this mechanism can indeed lead to negative modulation at some distances from the wall .",
    "the modulation theory makes it possible to extrapolate the results of observations at moderate reynolds numbers to much higher values of reynolds number .",
    "for example , it is well known that riblets reduce turbulent skin friction .",
    "the drag - reducing effect is strongest when riblet dimensions expressed in wall units attain an optimal value . at high reynolds number ,",
    "however , the large - scale structures will result in slow variations of the skin friction , and , hence , this implies that the effective riblet dimension in wall units can not remain optimal at all times , thus leading to the decrease of the effectiveness of riblets at higher reynolds numbers . by predicting the magnitude of the large - scale structures , say , using the experimental fit of @xcite , and then using the known dependence of the drag reduction effect on riblet geometry for moderate reynolds number ( @xcite ) and the formulae derived in the present study , it is possible to estimate quantitatively the change in the drag reduction due to an increase in reynolds number . the same idea applies to drag reduction by wall oscillations .",
    "of course , this implies that the modulation effect , confirmed by comparisons in the present work only for the flow past a flat solid wall , will also remain the only effect of reynolds number in flows with drag reduction .",
    "these considerations show , however , the importance of further studies of the modulation effect .",
