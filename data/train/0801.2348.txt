    "the discovery of the phenomenon of cosmic acceleration @xcite has stimulated a study of a huge variety of cosmological models , based on perfect fluids , scalar fields , tachyons etc @xcite .",
    "the cosmological models based on scalar fields have a long history , being used for exploration of possible inflationary scenarios @xcite and for description of dark energy @xcite .",
    "this has attracted a special attention to the technique of reconstruction of scalar potentials reproducing a given cosmological evolution @xcite .    on the other hand",
    "this development of model - designing art has revealed cosmological evolutions possessing various types of singularities , sometimes very different from the traditional big bang and big crunch .",
    "the most popular between them is , perhaps , the big rip cosmological singularity @xcite arising in superaccelerating models driven by some kind of phantom matter @xcite . other types of singularities",
    "are sudden singularities @xcite , big brake @xcite , and so on @xcite . here",
    "we would like to study the singularities which are close to the known big bang , big crunch and big rip singularities , but arising at finite values of the cosmological factor ( different from zero and infinity as well ) .",
    "similar singularities were recently considered in @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we construct potentials which can drive the cosmological evolution towards ( or from ) such singularities . combining qualitative and numerical methods we study the set of possible cosmological histories in the suggested models to show that the presence of such singularities in a cosmological model under consideration depends essentially on initial conditions and that the same model can accomodate qualitatively different cosmological scenarios .",
    "the structure of the paper is the following : in sec .",
    "2 we construct some potentials corresponding to evolutions with `` soft '' singularities . in the third section",
    "we analyze their dynamics .",
    "the conclusion is devoted to an interpretation of the obtained results .",
    "we shall consider flat friedmann models with the metric @xmath0 the hubble parameter @xmath1 satisfies the friedmann equation @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the energy density and a convenient normalization of the newton constant is chosen .",
    "differentiating equation ( [ fried1 ] ) and using the energy conservation equation @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the pressure , one comes to @xmath6 if the matter is represented by a spatially homogeneous minimally coupled scalar field , then the energy density and the pressure are given by the formulae @xmath7 @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a scalar field potential . combining equations ( [ fried1 ] ) , ( [ h - dot ] ) , ( [ energy ] ) , ( [ pressure ] ) we have @xmath10 and @xmath11 equation ( [ poten ] ) represents the potential as a function of time @xmath12 .",
    "integrating equation ( [ phi - dot ] ) one can find the scalar field as a function of time .",
    "inverting this dependence we can obtain the time parameter as a function of @xmath13 and substituting the corresponding formula into equation ( [ poten ] ) one arrives to the uniquely reconstructed potential @xmath9 .",
    "it is necessary to stress that this potential reproduces a given cosmological evolution only for some special choice of initial conditions on the scalar field and its time derivative .",
    "it is known that the power - law cosmological evolution is given by the hubble parameter @xmath14 .",
    "we shall look for a `` softer '' version of the cosmological evolution given by the law @xmath15 where @xmath16 is a positive constant and @xmath17 . at @xmath18",
    "a singularity is present , but it is different from the traditional big bang singularity . indeed , integrating we obtain @xmath19 if @xmath20 the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ soft1 ] ) is finite and hence one can not have @xmath21 in the left - hand side of this equation , because it would imply a contradiction , making @xmath22 divergent .",
    "hence @xmath23 , while @xmath24{}\\infty .",
    "\\label{soft2}\\ ] ] this type of singularity can be called soft bing bang singularity because the cosmological radius is finite ( and non - zero ) while its time derivative , the hubble variable and the scalar curvature are singular .",
    "it is interesting to note that when @xmath25 both @xmath26 and @xmath27 tend to infinity , but they do not encounter any cosmological singularity because the hubble variable and its derivatives tend to zero .",
    "let us reconstruct the potential of the scalar field model , producing the cosmological evolution ( [ soft ] ) using the technique described above .",
    "( [ phi - dot ] ) gives @xmath28 we shall choose the positive sign , without loosing generality .",
    "integrating , we get @xmath29 up to an arbitrary constant . inverting the last relation we find @xmath30 hence , using eq .",
    "( [ poten ] ) we obtain @xmath31 this potential provides the cosmological evolution ( [ soft ] ) if initial conditions compatible with eqs .",
    "( [ phi - dot1 ] ) and ( [ phi ] ) are chosen .",
    "naturally , there are also other cosmological evolutions , generated by other initial conditions , which will be studied in the next section .",
    "in order to achieve some simplification of calculations we shall consider a particular model , namely the one with the choice @xmath32 . in this case @xmath33 and @xmath34 the klein - gordon equation reads @xmath35 this equation is equivalent to the dynamical system    @xmath36    the qualitative analysis of dynamical systems in cosmology was presented in detail in @xcite .",
    "first of all , let us notice that the system has two critical points : we consider the linearized system around the point with the positive value of @xmath13 : @xmath37 where @xmath38 .",
    "the lyapunov indices for this system are ( for @xmath39 ) @xmath40 @xmath41 for negative @xmath42 , corresponding to the cosmological contraction , the signs of @xmath43 and @xmath44 are changed .",
    "the eigenvalues are real and have opposite signs , hence both the critical points are saddles .",
    "the universe being in one of these two saddle points means that it undergoes a de  sitter expansion or contraction , according to the sign of @xmath42 , with the value of @xmath45 given by @xmath46 for each saddle point there are four separatrices which separate four classes of trajectories in the phase plane @xmath47 corresponding to four types of cosmological evolutions .    in order to simplify the study of the dynamics",
    "let us note that the potential is an even function of the scalar field @xmath13 and that the saddle points are also symmetrical with respect to the @xmath48 axis .",
    "thus , it is sufficient to consider only one of this saddle points .",
    "we shall carry out our qualitative analysis taking into account both fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , giving the form of the potential , and fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , representing the phase portrait in the plane @xmath49 .",
    "first let us consider trajectories which begin at the moment @xmath18 , when the initial value of the scalar field is infinite , its potential is equal to zero and the time derivative of the scalar field is infinite and negative . in terms of the fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] it means that we consider the motion of the point beginning at the far right on the slope of the potential hill and moving towards the left ( i.e. towards the top of the hill ) with an infinite initial velocity .",
    "such a motion for @xmath39 describes a universe born from the standard big bang singularity .",
    "further details of this evolution depend on the asymptotic ratio between absolute values of @xmath50 and @xmath13 at @xmath51 .",
    "if this ratio is smaller than some critical value then the scalar field does not reach the top of the hill and at some moment it begins to roll down back to the right . during",
    "this process of rolling down the scalar field increases , the potential is decreasing and the velocity @xmath52 becomes positive and increasing .",
    "however the universe expansion works as a friction and at some moment its influence becomes dominant causing an asymptotic damping to zero of the velocity .",
    "the universe expands infinitely with @xmath53 . in the phase portrait ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) such trajectories populate the region @xmath54 .",
    "this region is limited by the separatrices @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "the first one corresponds to the positive ( for @xmath39 ) eigenvalue @xmath44 , while @xmath56 corresponds to @xmath43 .",
    "if the ratio @xmath57 has the critical value , then the scalar field reaches asymptotically the top of the hill of the potential , meaning that the universe becomes asymptotically de  sitter : in the phase portrait it is nothing but the curve @xmath56 .    when the ratio introduced above is larger than the critical one we encounter a different regime . in this case the scalar field passes with non - vanishing velocity the top of the hill and begins to roll down in the abyss on the left .",
    "the absolute value of the negative velocity @xmath52 is growing , while the potential becomes negative and at some moment the total energy density of the scalar field vanishes together with the hubble parameter @xmath42 : this means that the universe starts contracting .",
    "this contraction provides the growing of the absolute value of the velocity of the scalar field and the kinetic term again becomes larger then the potential one . moreover , both the terms in the klein - gordon equation increase the absolute value of @xmath58 .",
    "one can easily show that the regime in which the time derivative @xmath52 becomes equal to @xmath59 at some _ finite _ value of @xmath13 is impossible , because it implies a contradiction between the asymptotic behaviour of different terms in eq .",
    "( [ klein - gordon ] ) .",
    "thus , the universe tends to the singularity squeezing to the state with the value of @xmath13 equal to zero and an infinite time derivative @xmath52 . to understand which kind of singularity the universe encounters",
    ", we need some detail about the behaviour of the scalar field .",
    "let us suppose that , approaching the singularity at some moment @xmath60 , the scalar field behaves as @xmath61 where @xmath62 .",
    "then the first and second time derivatives are @xmath63 the potential behaves as @xmath64 to have the hubble variable well defined we require that the kinetic term is larger than the absolute value of the negative potential term ( [ appr - pot ] ) , i.e. @xmath65 or @xmath66 . now",
    "two opposite cases may hold : ( i ) the friction term in the klein - gordon equation could dominate the potential term or ( ii ) the opposite situation . for ( i ) to be the right case , one should require @xmath67 or @xmath68 . in this situation the asymptotic behaviour of the second time derivative of @xmath13 should be equal to that of the friction term , or , in other words @xmath69 , that is @xmath70 , which obviously is not relevant .",
    "thus we have to consider the range @xmath71 . in this case",
    "the potential term should be equal to the second time derivative of @xmath13 , which implies : @xmath72 and @xmath73 substituting the values of @xmath74 and @xmath75 into the expression for @xmath76 , we obtain @xmath77 thus , we see that the singularity we are approaching is of the soft big crunch type .    in the phase portrait ( fig .  [ fig2 ] ) these trajectories occupy the region @xmath78 limited by the separatrices @xmath56 and @xmath79 .",
    "the cosmological evolutions run from the big bang singularity to the soft big crunch one .",
    "however , the fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] is not sufficient to describe the complete behaviour of the universe under consideration , because at some moment the hubble variable changes sign and we should turn to the fig .  [ fig3 ] , giving the phase portrait for the contracting universe @xmath80 .",
    "note that increasing the velocity @xmath52 with which the scalar field overcomes the top of the hill , implies delaying the time when the point of maximal expansion of the universe is reached .",
    "the third regime begins from the soft big bang singularity , when the scalar field is equal to zero and its time derivative is infinite and positive . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] that situation is represented by the point climbing from the abyss to the top of the hill . if the velocity term is not high enough , at some moment the field stops climbing and rolls back down . during this fall",
    "the hubble variable changes sign and the universe ends its evolution in the soft big crunch singularity .",
    "the corresponding trajectories belong to the region @xmath81 of our phase plane , bounded by the separatrices @xmath79 and @xmath82 .",
    "the universe has its finite life time between the soft big bang and the soft big crunch singularities .",
    "the situation when the scalar field arrives exactly to the top of the hill and stops corresponds to the separatrix @xmath82 .",
    "the fourth set of cosmological trajectories is generated by the scalar field climbing from the abyss and overcoming the top of the hill with the subsequent infinite expansion : the scalar field is infinitely growing and the hubble parameter tends to zero .",
    "these trajectories occupy the region @xmath83 and our original cosmological evolution ( [ soft ] ) belongs to this family .",
    "let us sum up our results .",
    "wishing to describe a cosmological evolution beginning from ( or ending in ) a singularity characterized by a nonvanishing initial ( or final ) cosmological radius and an infinite value of the scalar curvature due to the infinite value of the hubble parameter , we have constructed a scalar field potential , providing such an evolution .",
    "then , using the methods of qualitative analysis of the differential equations , we have shown that the proposed model accomodates four different classes of cosmological evolutions , depending on initial conditions .",
    "numerical simulations have confirmed our predictions .",
    "the main results of this work are : ( i ) the realization of a concrete cosmological model with a scalar field , where finite cosmological radius singularities are present and ( ii ) the complete description of all the possible evolutions of this model depending on the initial conditions .",
    "it is important to remark that , given the fixed scalar field potential , one has different types of evolutions encountering different kinds of singularities .",
    "the trajectories , belonging to the regions @xmath83 and @xmath54 have an infinite time of expansion , while the trajectories belonging to the regions @xmath78 and @xmath81 begin and end their histories in the singularities and have a finite lifetime .",
    "let us note , that there are some studies @xcite devoted to the general analysis of various kinds of new cosmological singularities .",
    "in this work we were not looking for an exhaustive classification of different possible cosmological models possessing singularities , but rather we wanted to study in a complete way a particular cosmological model , having some interesting properties .",
