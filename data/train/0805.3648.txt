    "ngc 1097 was originally identified as a liner @xcite , but over the past two decades has shown seyfert 1 activity as evidenced by the presence of broad double - peaked balmer emission lines ( fwhm @xmath6 7500 km s@xmath7 ; * ? ? ?",

    "the interferometric @xmath0co(j = 1  0 ) map also revealed a relatively weak central concentration coincident with the nucleus .",
    "their hcn(j = 1  0 ) map shows similar knots in the starburst ring , but in contrast to their @xmath0co(j = 1  0 ) map a relatively bright central concentration of the hcn emission coincides with the nucleus .",
    "this implies that the molecular gas associated with the nucleus is relatively dense ( @xmath12 @xmath13 ) .",
    "similar dense central gas concentrations have been reported in ngc 1068 @xcite , m51 @xcite , and ngc 6951 @xcite , all of which are type 2 seyferts . in all these cases ,",
    "the dense central gas concentrations have been attributed to a highly inclined circumnuclear molecular torus invoked by agn unification models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "this is the first time , however , that such a dense central gas concentration has been seen in a seyfert 1 galaxy , warranting observations at higher angular resolutions to determine whether it is a good candidate for the hypothesized circumnuclear molecular torus .    in this paper",

[ sect - r21 ] ) including uncertainties of the flux in both observations .",
    "we show the @xmath0co(j = 2  1 ) integrated intensity map in figure  [ fig - intmap](a ) . a relatively strong molecular concentration ( hereafter , central component )",

    "the molecular ring is composed of several knots that closely resembles the 1.5 ghz continuum map of @xcite .",
    "in addition , we detected weak molecular emission extending from the ne and sw of the molecular ring , coinciding with dust lanes along the large stellar bar ( indicated by the two straight lines in fig .",

    ", we show the @xmath0co(j = 1  0 ) map made by @xcite with the nma . as can be seen , the molecular ring is more clearly discernible and also more clearly separated in our @xmath0co(j = 2  1 ) map than in the @xmath0co(j = 1  0 ) map .",
    "the intensity peak in the @xmath0co(j = 2  1 ) map is located at the nucleus , whereas that in the @xmath0co(j = 1  0 ) map is located at the ne part of the ring .",

    "both of the molecular gas peaks at the ne and sw sides of the ring are located at the regions where the dust lanes connect with the ring , and these molecular gas peaks are often seen in barred spiral galaxies , which are known as the twin - peak morphology ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .      in figure  [ fig - pvmom1](a",
    ") , we show the intensity - weighted @xmath0co(j = 2  1 ) mean - velocity map .",
    "both the central component and molecular ring show an overall velocity gradient in the ne to se direction along a p.a .  of @xmath40 ,",
    "that is similar to the major kinematic axis of the large - scale galactic disk @xcite .",
    "the emission is blueshifted on the northwestern side of center , and redshifted on the southeastern side of center with respect to the systemic velocity of 1254 km s@xmath7 for ngc 1097 @xcite .",
    "the gas motion in the molecular ring appears to be dominated by circular motion ( i.e. , isovelocity contours perpendicular to major axis ) , whereas in the @xmath0co(j = 1  0 ) velocity map of @xcite the isovelocity contours have a symmetric s - shape with the end of the s - shape nearly parallel to the dust lanes along the large stellar bar .",
    "this non - circular motion is not as prominent in our @xmath0co(j = 2  1 ) map perhaps because the aforementioned dust lanes are not as strongly detected in @xmath0co(j = 2  1 ) , along with the fact that they are closer to the edge of our primary beam than in the @xmath0co(j = 1  0 ) observations of @xcite .    a position - velocity diagram ( hereafter p - v diagram ) of the @xmath0co(j = 2  1 ) emission along its major kinematical axis ( p.a .",

    "positive and negative velocities correspond to redshifted and blueshifted velocities , respectively , relative to the systemic velocity .",
    "the rapidly rising part of the rotation curve corresponds to the central component , and the flat part to the molecular ring .",
    "the rotation curve is symmetric on both sides of the center , rising steeply to @xmath41 km s@xmath7 at @xmath42 ( @xmath43  pc ) and flattening outside @xmath42 .",
    "this indicates that the size of the central component is about 350  pc in diameter . as can be seen in figure  [ fig - pvmom1](b ) , the emission from the central component is stronger on the redshifted southeastern part , causing the centroid of the emission to be shifted by @xmath447 towards the southeast as mention in section  [ sect - dist ] ( and shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - intmap]a ) .",
    "the velocity gradient of the central component is @xmath45 km s@xmath7 pc@xmath7 ( fig .",

    "our @xmath0co(j = 2  1 ) map detected about @xmath46 of the flux measured with the jcmt @xcite .",
    "the shortest projected baseline in our sma observations is 4.8  k@xmath47 ( @xmath48",
    "m ) , and so the largest structure we can detect is @xmath1452@xmath49 , comparable in size to the sma primary beam .",
    "we therefore assume that the molecular gas resolved out in our map is uniformly distributed in space and in velocity over the entire line width , and have corrected for @xmath50 of the missing flux .",
    "we applied a primary beam correction to both the @xmath0co(j = 2  1 ) and @xmath0co(j = 1  0 ) maps , and convolved the derived moment maps to the same angular resolution of @xmath51 with p.a .  of @xmath52 .",

    "we re - calculated the gas mass inside 20@xmath49 in radius derived by @xcite using the conversion factor mentioned above , and it is calculated as @xmath69 .",
    "we then subtract the gas mass of the center from this gas mass .",
    "the gas mass of the center is calculated as @xmath70 using the central position data with a @xmath71 of @xmath1432 k",
    "km s@xmath7 ( fig .  3 of @xcite ) .",
    "the gas mass of the ring is therefore calculated as @xmath14@xmath72 .",
    "this value is somewhat larger than ours , and this may be due to their larger radius of 20@xmath49 , and therefore their results may be detecting emission outside the ring .    to determine the temperature and density of the molecular gas , we use the lvg method @xcite .",
    "we assume a one zone model , which assumes that both the @xmath0co(j = 2  1 ) and @xmath0co(j = 1  0 ) emissions originate from the same region .",
    "the collision rates for co are taken from @xcite for the temperature regime t = @xmath73  k , and @xcite for t = @xmath74  k. we first assume a standard @xmath75co)/(d@xmath76/d@xmath77 ) of @xmath78 ( km s@xmath7 pc@xmath7)@xmath7 , where @xmath75co ) = [ @xmath0co]/[h@xmath79 is the abundance ratio and d@xmath76/d@xmath77 is the velocity gradient of the molecular gas .",

    "note that the estimated kinetic temperature is highly dependent on the assumed @xmath75co)/(d@xmath76/d@xmath77 ) , namely highly dependent on the [ @xmath0co]/[h@xmath79 relative abundance , on the velocity gradient , or on both .",
    "fixing @xmath87  @xmath85 , we plot @xmath88 as a function of @xmath81 and @xmath75co)/(d@xmath76/d@xmath77 ) in figure  [ fig - tknh2](b ) .",
    "as can be seen , @xmath1 increases roughly linearly with @xmath75co)/(d@xmath76/d@xmath77 ) , and around the standard @xmath75co)/(d@xmath76/d@xmath77 ) of @xmath8910@xmath90 ( km s@xmath7 pc@xmath7)@xmath7 , we find that a kinetic temperature of at least 100  k is required to reach @xmath88 of @xmath54 . if on the other hand @xmath75co)/(d@xmath76/d@xmath77 ) is an order of magnitude lower than the standard value ( i.e. , order of 10@xmath91 ) , the kinetic temperature would be in the range of @xmath81 @xmath89 @xmath92  k , which is comparable with the temperature range normally found in molecular clouds .    for the molecular ring , which has an average @xmath93 , @xmath94  k and @xmath95  @xmath85 assuming the standard @xmath75co)/(d@xmath76/d@xmath77 ) .",
    "again , these values are sensitive to the assumed @xmath75co)/(d@xmath76/d@xmath77 ) , and if this value decreases , @xmath81 and @xmath80 also decrease .",
    "the average @xmath1 of about unity in the molecular ring suggests that the overall properties of the molecular gas in the starburst ring is optically thick and thermalized . as mentioned in section  [ sect - r21 ] , this value is similar to that of the global @xmath1 of other spiral galaxies or that in the active star forming gmcs .",
    "similarity of the molecular gas ratios between the molecular gas in the ring and the molecular clouds at active star forming regions indicates that the molecular gas in the ring is closely related to the starburst activities occurring in the ring .",
    "this is also supported by the high hcn(j = 1  0)/@xmath0co(j = 1  0 ) of 0.16 @xcite .",
    "since stars form from molecular gas , we believe that this molecular gas is actually fueling the starburst activities in the ring .",
    "the gas mass content in the starburst ring is , on the other hand , not as high as star forming galaxies , about @xmath96 of the dynamical mass ; the dynamical mass within the radius of @xmath64  @xmath65 ( 560  840  pc ; roughly corresponds to the width of the molecular ring ) can be estimated as @xmath97 , using the rotational velocity of 235 km s@xmath7 ( sect .",
    "[ sect - kin ] ) and assuming the inclination of the molecular ring is the same as that of the host galaxy of @xmath98 @xcite .",
    "the molecular gas mass in the ring is @xmath99 ( sect .",
    "[ sect - phys ] ) , so that the molecular gas mass to dynamical mass ratio is calculated as @xmath100 .",
    "this value is a bit lower than the threshold to have star formation activities at nuclei of @xmath101 suggested by @xcite .",
    "one reason for the discrepancy between high @xmath1 and hcn(j = 1  0)/@xmath0co(j = 1  0 ) ratios and low molecular gas mass to dynamical mass ratio may be that @xcite are taking mass ratios within 500  pc in radius , but we are taking the mass ratio in a certain range of radius .",
    "another possibilities is that the gas in the staburst ring is highly affected by shock induced by the gas infall along the bar , so that the high intensity ratios may not tracing the star formation activities , but tracing shocked gas .",
    "the upper limit of the mass of newly formed ( 1.5  gyr old ) stars in the star - forming ring is @xmath102 @xcite , which is roughly comparable to or somewhat larger than the mass of molecular gas ( @xmath99 ) .",
    "this implies that a large fraction of the molecular gas has already turned into stars within a timescale of 1.5  gyr .",
    "we can estimate the molecular gas consumption timescale with considering the star formation rate ( sfr ) and the molecular gas mass of the ring .",
    "the sfr in the molecular ring is about 5  m@xmath103 yr@xmath7 @xcite . without further replenishment ,",
    "the molecular gas in the ring can last for only about @xmath104 years assuming a constant sfr and a perfect conversion of gas to stars .",
    "this value is roughly an order of magnitude lower than the value derived by @xcite , which is due to their somewhat larger molecular gas mass , inclusion of atomic hydrogen gas mass assuming it has the same amount as the molecular gas mass , and using lower sfr of @xmath105  m@xmath103 yr@xmath7 .",
    "in addition to the gas consumption by star formation , the amount of molecular gas in the ring also decreases by the infall toward the nucleus . as mentioned in section  [ sect - intro ] , the gas infalling motion has been observed from the ring to the nucleus .",
    "the value for the mass infall rate is not known , but this effect obviously decreases the lifetime of the molecular ring . on the other hand ,",
    "gas replenishment by the infall along the large scale bar from the outer part of the galaxy to the molecular ring increases the lifetime .",
    "the value for the mass infall rate is again not known , so the lifetime of the molecular ring is decided by the balance between these effects .",
    "our @xmath0co(j = 2  1 ) results show that the molecular gas located at the center is spatially coincident with the agn , which is consistent with the previous interferometric maps of the @xmath0co(j = 1  0 ) and hcn(j = 1  0 ) lines @xcite .",
    "in addition , the central component is kinematically symmetric at the center with steep velocity gradient , suggesting that the molecular gas is rotating around the agn .",
    "here we discuss the relation between the central component and the agn activities based on the line ratios of the central component and its physical conditions , which were derived using the lvg analysis results presented in the previous section",

    "[ sect - r21 ] ) .",
    "these results suggest that the high @xmath1 in molecular gas can be related to irradiation of uv photons from star forming regions , shock caused by interaction between molecular gas and outflowing or expanding materials , but not to the global galactic characteristics or activities",
    ". hence similar activities can be the cause of high @xmath1 in the central region of ngc 1097 .",
    "however , other activities that can not be seen in star forming galaxies or in our galaxy can also be the cause of high @xmath1 , such as strong x - ray radiation from the seyfert 1 nucleus ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "such high density and high temperature conditions for molecular gas around seyfert nuclei are also derived in other galaxies , such as the seyfert 2 nucleus of m51 @xcite or ngc 1068 @xcite , but not for the molecular gas in non - active galaxies such as ic 342 or our galaxy @xcite .",
    "these physical values are , however , sensitive to @xmath75co)/(d@xmath76/d@xmath77 ) , namely to the @xmath0co abundances , to the velocity gradient , or to both .",
    "as shown in section  [ sect - phys ] , lower @xmath75co)/(d@xmath76/d@xmath77 ) makes the derived temperature lower .",
    "this is because the opacity is linearly related to @xmath75co)/(d@xmath76/d@xmath77 ) , and it will decrease if @xmath75co)/(d@xmath76/d@xmath77 ) decreases . under low @xmath75co)/(d@xmath76/d@xmath77 ) conditions , if the temperature rises , the @xmath0co(j = 1  0 ) line can easily be optically thin , and easier to have high @xmath1 at lower temperature than the normal @xmath75co)/(d@xmath76/d@xmath77 ) condition . in either case",
    ", the molecular gas around seyfert nuclei seems to have different properties from other normal environment , which seems to be largely related to the seyfert activities .",
    "combined with the spatial and kinematical information , we suggest that the central component is kinematically and physically related to the seyfert nucleus .      given that the central component is closely related to the agn , is this then the circumnuclear molecular torus predicted by agn unified models ? since ngc 1097 hosts a seyfert 1 agn , we expect that the rotating circumnuclear gas is in a nearly face - on configuration to provide an essentially unobscured view to the broad - line region ( blr ) , if we apply the general unified model for agns ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "kinematics of the central component we observed are , however , similar to what is usually observed in other seyfert 2 galaxies , such as ngc 1068 @xcite or m51 @xcite ; the central component shows steep velocity gradient that can be explained by edge - on disk or torus rotating around the seyfert nucleus .",
    "in addition , we derived a molecular hydrogen column density ( @xmath111 ) toward the nucleus of @xmath62 @xmath13 ( sect .",
    "[ sect - phys ] ) , or @xmath112 @xmath13 in atomic hydrogen column density ( @xmath113 ) , which is about two orders of magnitudes larger than @xmath113 derived from x - ray spectra of @xmath114 @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "from these `` inconsistent '' results between our molecular gas observations and other observations at different wavelengths / frequencies , the structure of the central component can have two basic configurations ; one is a nearly face - on disk- , ring- , or torus - like structure with a very fast rotation velocity , and another is a nearly edge - on disk- , ring- , or torus - like structure with a thin or clumpy structure . due to our large synthesized beam size",
    ", we could not distinguish these two possibilities observationally , and also could not evaluate the thickness of the structure .",
    "here we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of both possibilities .",
    "the former molecular gas configuration has a nearly face - on structure , so the direct view to the blr is secured .",
    "but since the observed rotational velocity width has 470 km s@xmath7 , the inclination corrected rotational velocity width for this configuration has to be @xmath115 , where @xmath116 is the inclination ( @xmath52 corresponds to a face - on configuration ) .",
    "the nearly face - on configuration therefore leads to a high rotational velocity ( e.g. , 940 km s@xmath7 even for the inclination angle of @xmath117 ) .",
    "note that this rotation is rigid rotation , and it is rare to see rigid rotation velocity of @xmath118 km s@xmath7 in other galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , assuming the inclination angles as @xmath117 , @xmath119 , and @xmath120 , the dynamical mass within the central gas , namely within the radius of 2@xmath1215 ( 175  pc ) , can be estimated to be @xmath122@xmath123 , @xmath124@xmath123 , and @xmath125 , respectively . the total dynamical mass of ngc 1097 within a radius of 7@xmath1265 ( 31.5  kpc ) estimated from the large - scale atomic hydrogen observations is @xmath127 @xcite .",
    "a disk with the inclination angle of @xmath120 is impossible , since the dynamical mass of the central gas is almost the same with the mass of the whole galaxies .",
    "a disk with the inclination angle of @xmath119 is still too large , since more than one tenth of the total mass is concentrated within a thousandth of radius .",
    "a disk with the inclination angle of @xmath117 can be possible .",
    "we therefore think that this face - on configuration can be possible , only if the inclination angle is @xmath128 or larger .",
    "the latter molecular gas configuration has an edge - on structure , so the structure should have thin disk- or ring - like structure , or it can be torus - like structure but has to have a clumpy internal structure to expose the blr at the center .",
    "such clumpy structure is suggested theoretically @xcite , and with their model , the column density of @xmath129 @xmath13 is possible even with the inclination angle of @xmath130 . under this model , the difference of the column density derived from our co data and from the x - ray data can be explained ; the spatial resolution of our observation is about 250  pc , which smears all the internal clumpy structures , and therefore the derived column density will be the average value and higher than that derived from x - ray observations , which only trace very narrow column densities due to the very small size scale of the x - ray emitting region ( @xmath131  pc ) . under these nearly edge - on configurations ,",
    "the rotational velocity is in the typical values for other galaxies ( @xmath132 km s@xmath7 ) , and therefore we do not need to invoke any special conditions .    of course , there is another possibility that the central component is nothing related to the hypothetical torus , namely the central component we observed is just a part of the galactic disk gas . this is supported by the similar trend and the smooth connection of the molecular gas kinematics at the nucleus and the ring . since the infalling motion exists from the ring to the nucleus along the nuclear bar or spiral @xcite , it is natural to pile up the gas around the nucleus with similar kinematics as that of the ring . in this case",
    ", gas will rotate around the nucleus with similar inclination as the outer disk or the ring , and it is natural not to cover the line - of - sight toward the agn , namely the gas configuration will be similar to the seyfert 1 nucleus .",
    "in addition , if the molecular gas piles up at the diameter smaller than our beam size of 200300  pc , the discrepancy of the column density estimated from our data and the x - ray data can also be explained .",
    "here we briefly estimate the necessary gas infall rate to create the central component with gas infall from the molecular ring .",
    "the h@xmath108 masses of the central component is @xmath133 , so that the mass infall rate of 0.5 m@xmath103 yr@xmath7 is required to create this component within the molecular ring gas consumption timescale of @xmath2 years ( sect .",
    "[ sect - dis - ring ] ) .",
    "note that the line ratio of the central component is obviously different from that in other regions or other galaxies , and this can be explained either by the shock caused by the gas inflow along the nuclear bar or nuclear spiral , or by agn activities , such as irradiation of strong x - ray emission to the central component .    in summary , the central component can be the hypothetical circumnuclear disk or torus with nearly edge - on ( @xmath134 ) clumpy structure , or less likely nearly face - on ( @xmath135 ) disk / torus .",
    "the central component can also be nothing related to the hypothetical disk / torus , and possibly created by the gas inflow from the molecular ring .",
    "the physical conditions of the central component are different from that of molecular gas in other regions , so that even it is not the hypothetical disk / torus , it should be highly related to the agn activities or gas inflow toward the nucleus .",
    "we successfully imaged the central component and the molecular ring , which is spatially coincident with the agn and the starburst ring , toward the central region of the seyfert 1 galaxy ngc 1097 using the sma in the @xmath0co(j = 2  1 ) line . here",
    "are the summary for the nature of the central component we observed :    1 .",
    "we found that the @xmath0co(j = 2  1 ) map shows an intensity peak at the central component , and different from the @xmath0co(j = 1  0 ) map , which shows the intensity peak at the molecular ring .",
    "the @xmath0co(j = 2  1)/@xmath0co(j = 1  0 ) line intensity ratio for the central component is @xmath54 , which is different from the global values in gmcs or in spiral galaxies of about unity or less . from the lvg analysis",
    ", we estimated that the central component is warmer ( @xmath136  k ) and denser ( @xmath137  @xmath85 ) than that of the normal molecular clouds assuming a normal @xmath75co)/(d@xmath76/d@xmath77 ) .",
    "these values depend highly on the @xmath75co)/(d@xmath76/d@xmath77 ) , and lower @xmath75co)/(d@xmath76/d@xmath77 ) for about an order of magnitude decreases the temperature and density of about an order of magnitude",
    ". the effect of intense star formation and/or agn activities , such as shocks induced by numerous supernova explosions or strong x - ray radiation from agn are presumably the causes of the unusual line ratio .",
    "faster rotation feature of the central gas is observed in ngc 1097 , which is similar results as observed in other seyfert 2 galaxies .",
    "we interpret this feature as a highly - inclined clumpy disk / torus or thin disk to explain the fast rotation and the difference between the column density derived from co and x - ray observations .",
    "a low - inclined ( @xmath138 ) thick disk is possible , but lower inclination than this value is less likely since it is rare to see a velocity @xmath139 in nearby galaxies , and the total mass of central disk turns to be too large compared with the total mass of the galaxy . on the other hand ,",
    "the central component can also be interpret as just an inner extention of the galactic disk , possibly created by the gas inflow from the molecular ring .",
    "4 .   combining kinematical and spatial information with the physical conditions",
    ", we suggest that the central gas is related to the seyfert activities or gas inflow .      1 .",
    "the @xmath1 of the molecular ring is @xmath140 , which shows a similar properties to the star forming gmcs in our galaxy or nearby starburst galaxies .",
    "in addition , since the molecular ring shows a good spatial coincident with the starburst ring , so we expect that the molecular ring is actually fueling the starburst activities .",
    "the molecular gas mass content with respective to the dynamical mass , on the other hand , shows somewhat low value , so that high @xmath1 may not be related to star formation activities , but to other activities , such as shock induced by gas infall along the bar . without further replenishment , it can last for only about 1.2@xmath141 years , but since there seems to have gas flows from the dust lane along the large - scale bar toward the molecular ring , and from the molecular ring toward the nucleus , this timescale is highly uncertain .",
