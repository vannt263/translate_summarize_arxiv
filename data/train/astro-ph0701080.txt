    "massive searches for gravitational microlensing events have been and are being carried out by monitoring a large number of stars located in the galactic bulge and magellanic clouds @xcite .",
    "current lensing surveys are detecting events with a rate of @xmath3 events per year , most of them toward the galactic bulge field , and the total number of detected events now exceeds 2000 . among them , a significant fraction of the events are caused by binaries .",
    "although a sizable number of binary lensing events have been detected , there have been few investigations about the properties of binaries like the binary fraction and the distributions of the binary separation and mass ratio based on the binary event sample .",
    "there are several reasons for this .",
    "first , current lensing detection is strongly biased for binaries with separations equivalent to the einstein radius of the combined mass of the binary , and thus the range of binary separation covered by lensing is very narrow .",
    "second , for events detected through this _ resonant _ channel , it is difficult to quantify the detection efficiency due to the non - linear lensing behavior .",
    "third , interpreting the lightcurve of these events suffers from degeneracy of parameters and thus accurate determinations of the separation and mass ratio are difficult @xcite . as a result",
    ", there has been no meaningful result about the statistical properties of binaries although there have been several reports of binary event samples @xcite .    besides the resonant channel",
    ", binaries can be detected through another channel of repeating events @xcite .",
    "binary detection through this channel is possible if an event is produced by a widely separated binary lens and the source trajectory approaches both lens components .",
    "the resulting lightcurve is approximated by the superposition of the single lensing events caused by the individual binary components .",
    "using the sample of binaries detected through this channel has various advantages in the studies of binary properties .",
    "first , being able to detect wide separation binaries , the separation range of binaries that can be studied with microlensing can be greatly expanded .",
    "second , the detection efficiency is estimated in a straightforward manner and thus can be easily quantified .",
    "third , determinations of the binary lens parameters do not suffer from degeneracy and thus the parameters can be accurately determined .",
    "despite these advantages , current lensing surveys are very inefficient in detecting binary events through the repeating channel .",
    "this is because repeating events require special lens - source geometry and thus they are very rare .",
    "@xcite pointed out that the detection rate of repeating binary lensing events could be increased by conducting follow - up observations of events . however , these follow - ups require long - term observations of the individual events . considering",
    "that there are limited resources of follow - up observations and the main purpose of the follow - up observations currently being conducted is searching for extrasolar planets @xcite , implementing the proposed follow - up observations for the detections of wide binaries is practically very difficult .",
    "recently , serious discussions are going on about future lensing surveys with the prime goal of searching for a large sample of extrasolar planets including earth - mass planets .",
    "the _ microlensing planet finder _ ( _ mpf _ ) , which succeeded the original concept of the _ galactic exoplanet survey telescope _",
    "( _ gest _ ) @xcite , is a space mission exclusive for microlensing and it will be equipped with a 1.1 m aperture telescope , which images a 1.3 @xmath4 field of view .",
    "the ` earth - hunter ' project is a ground - based survey that plans to achieve @xmath5 minute sampling by using a network of three 2 m class wide field ( @xmath6 ) telescopes scattered over the southern hemisphere ( a.  gould , private communication ) .",
    "these next - generation surveys will have the capability of continuously monitoring stars at high cadence by using very large format imaging cameras and thus dispense with the need of follow - up observations .    in this paper",
    ", we point out the usefulness of the future lensing surveys in the study of binary properties .",
    "we demonstrate that a large number of binary events are expected to be detected in the future lensing surveys through the channel of repeating events thanks to the greatly improved sensitivity to events associated with faint source stars and low - magnification events .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in   2 , we briefly describe the basics of repeating binary lensing events . in   3 , we estimate the detection rate of repeating binary events expected from future lensing surveys based on standard models of the physical and dynamical distributions of galactic matter combined with models of binary separation and mass function under realistic observational conditions .",
    "we also investigate the characteristics of the events . in   4 , we discuss about the advantages of using the repeating binary event sample in the studies of binary properties . in   5 , we summarize the results and conclude .",
    "if a lensing event is caused by a binary with a projected separation between the lens components significantly larger than the einstein radius of the combined mass of the binary , the individual binary components behave as if they are independent single lenses .",
    "then , the resulting lightcurve is well represented by the superposition of the single lensing events , i.e. , @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the magnifications of the single lensing events caused by the individual binary components .",
    "we use the subscripts ` 1 ' and ` 2 ' to designate the events caused by the individual binary components according to the time of the source s approach and refer the individual single lensing events as the _ first _ and _ second _ events , respectively .",
    "the einstein radius is related to the mass of the lens , @xmath10 , and distance to the lens , @xmath11 , and source , @xmath12 , by @xmath13 for each single lens event , the magnification is related to the lensing parameters by @xmath14^{1/2 } , \\label{eq3}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is the lens - source separation normalized by the einstein radius of each lens component , @xmath16 is the timescale required for the source to transit the einstein ring radius ( einstein timescale ) , @xmath17 is the time of the source star s closest approaches to the lens , and @xmath18 is the lens - source separations at that moment ( impact parameters ) normalized by the einstein radius .",
    "the einstein radius of each binary component is related to that of the combined mass by @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the mass fraction of the binary component .",
    "the condition for a wide separation binary to cause a repeating event is that the source trajectory closely approaches both lens components .",
    "if @xmath21 is the angular separation between the lens components and @xmath22 and @xmath23 represent the impact parameters ( also in angular units ) of the source trajectory to the individual lens components , then this condition is represented by @xmath24 where @xmath25 denotes the orientation angle of the source trajectory with respect to the binary axis and @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the maximum values of the impact parameters for the detection of the single - lensing events involved with the individual binary components . by normalizing the binary separation in terms of the einstein radius of the combined mass of the binary , @xmath28 , and the impact parameters in terms of the einstein radii of the individual lens components , @xmath29 , equation  ( [ eq4 ] )",
    "is expressed as @xmath30",
    "in this section , we estimate the rate of repeating binary lensing events expected to be detected by future lensing surveys and compare the rate to that of current surveys . for this",
    ", we conduct simulations of repeating events .      with the standard models of dynamical and physical distributions of galactic matter combined with models of binary separation and mass function , we produce repeating events toward the galactic bulge field as follows .",
    "first , survey is assumed to be conducted toward the galactic bulge field and the locations of the source and lens are allocated based on the mass distribution model of @xcite . in the model , the physical distribution of bulge matter",
    "is based on the deprojected infrared light density profile of @xcite , specifically model g2 with @xmath31 kpc from their table 2 .",
    "the disk matter distribution is modeled by a double - exponential disk , which is expressed as @xmath32 ,   \\label{eq6}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 is the galactocentric cylindrical coordinates , @xmath34 kpc is the distance of the sun from the galactic center , @xmath35 is the mass density in the solar neighborhood , and @xmath36 kpc and @xmath37 pc are the radial and vertical scale heights , respectively .",
    "second , the velocity distribution of the bulge is deduced from the tensor virial theorem , while the disk velocity distribution is assumed to have a flat rotation speed of @xmath38 and velocity dispersions along and normal to the disk plane of @xmath39 and @xmath40 , respectively .",
    "the resulting distribution of the lens - source transverse velocity from the combinations of the bulge and disk velocities is listed in table 1 of @xcite , specifically non - rotating barred bulge model .",
    "third , the absolute brightnesses of the galactic bulge source stars are assigned on the basis of the luminosity function of @xcite , that was constructed from _",
    "hubble space telescope _",
    "once the absolute magnitude is assigned , the apparent magnitude is determined considering the distance to the source star and extinction .",
    "the extinction is determined such that the source star flux decreases exponentially with the increase of the dust column density .",
    "the dust column density is computed on the basis of an exponential dust distribution model with a scale height of @xmath41 , i.e.   @xmath42 .",
    "based on the extinction determination of @xmath43 by @xcite and the mean ratio of extinction to color excess of @xmath44 determined by @xcite , we normalize the amount of @xmath45-band extinction so that @xmath46 toward the baade s window .",
    "fourth , the mass of the lens is assigned based on the model mass function of @xcite , which is composed of stars , brown dwarfs ( bds ) , and stellar remnants of white dwarfs ( wds ) , neutron stars ( nss ) , and black holes ( bhs ) .",
    "the model is constructed under the assumption that bulge stars formed initially according to a double power - law distribution of the form @xmath47 where @xmath48 for @xmath49 and @xmath50 for @xmath51 .",
    "based on this initial mass function , remnants are modeled by assuming that the stars with initial masses @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 have evolved into wds ( with a mean mass @xmath55 ) , nss ( with @xmath56 ) , and bhs ( with @xmath57 ) , respectively . then , the resulting mass fractions of the individual lens components are @xmath58 .",
    "once the first event is produced , we then introduce a second event .",
    "following @xcite , we model the binary separation is uniformly distributed in @xmath59 , i.e.  @xmath60 . to ensure that the part of the lightcurve induced by each of the individual lenses can be well approximated by a single lens lightcurve",
    ", the binary separation is restricted to be larger than three times of the combined einstein ring radius , i.e.  @xmath61 . for the mass function of the binary , we test three models . in the first model",
    ", we assume that the two masses of the binary components are drawn independently from the same mass function as that of single stars . this model is natural results of binary formation where binaries are formed through interactions between protostellar disks @xcite or some other forms of capture .",
    "we refer this model as the ` capture ' model",
    ". other possible mechanisms of binary formation are fission of a single star and fragmentation of a collapsing objects .",
    "numerical calculations suggest that the former process results in a mass ratio distribution peaking at around @xmath62 @xcite , while the latter results in more equal masses @xcite .",
    "we refer these models as the ` fission ' and ` fragmentation ' models , respectively . in the fission model ,",
    "we model the mass ratio distribution as @xmath63 while the distribution of the fragmentation model is modeled as @xmath64 in the fission model , we set the total mass of the binary to be the same as that of a single star because a single star is split into two components of a binary in this model .",
    "then , the total mass of the binary is drawn from the mass function of single stars and the masses of the individual binary components are deduced from the mass ratio . in the fragmentation model , on the other hand , the mass of the primary is drawn from the single star mass function and the mass of the companion is determined from the mass ratio . as a result , the average mass of the binaries in this model is heavier than that of single stars .",
    "lll platform & ground based & space mission + center of field & @xmath65 & @xmath66 + field of view & @xmath67 & @xmath68 + photometric precision & @xmath69 at @xmath70 & @xmath71 at @xmath72 + sampling frequency & 1 time / night & 96 times / night + fraction of clear nights & @xmath73 & 100% + observation duration per year & 7 months & 9 months +      event rate is not an absolute quantity but is subject to the conditions of observation and detection criteria .",
    "we estimate the rate of repeating events by assuming the following observational conditions of the current and future lensing surveys .",
    "we note that these conditions are based on those of the ogle and _ mpf _ surveys , respectively .",
    "the details of the observational conditions are as follows .    1 .   for the observation fields",
    ", we assume that the current lensing survey is monitoring toward a bulge field of @xmath74 with a field of view of @xmath75 . the future survey will monitor toward a denser field of @xmath76 but with a narrower field of view of @xmath77 .",
    "2 .   for the sampling frequency , we assume that the current survey is monitoring the same field with a sampling interval of 1 day , but the observation is interrupted by sporadic bad weather .",
    "the nights of bad weather comprise @xmath78 of a total 7-month period of the bulge season .",
    "the future lensing survey will continuously observe the target field with a sampling interval of 15 minutes except a 3-month period to avoid the sun .",
    "3 .   despite that a star is observed by telescopes with similar apertures , the photometric precisions from ground and space - based observations are substantially different .",
    "this is because the bulge field is very crowded and thus ground - based observations suffer from severe blending that contributes to the photometric noise . to account for blending",
    ", we set the photometric precisions as @xmath69 at @xmath70 for the current survey and @xmath71 at @xmath72 for the future survey .",
    "we summarize the observational conditions in table  [ table : one ] .",
    "we judge the detectability of an event based on the uncertainties of the lensing parameters recovered from the lightcurves .",
    "the uncertainties are estimated by computing the curvature matrix of @xmath79 surface .",
    "for the case of a lensing lightcurve , the curvature matrix is defined as @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the number of observations , @xmath82 is the observed flux , @xmath83 and @xmath84 are fluxes of the unmagnified source and blended light , @xmath85 is the photometric precision of each measurement , and @xmath86 are the five lensing parameters required to fit the lightcurve of a standard point - source single - lens event .",
    "then , the uncertainties of the individual lensing parameters correspond to the diagonal components of the inverse curvature matrix ( covariance matrix ) , i.e. @xmath87 among the lensing parameters , the einstein timescale is of interest because it is the only lensing parameter related to the physical quantities of the lens system .",
    "the timescale is also important because the mass ratio between the binary lens components of a repeating event is determined by @xmath88 . with the uncertainty of the timescale @xmath89",
    ", we set the criteria of event detection as @xmath90 where @xmath89 is determined from the lightcurve measured during the time of @xmath91 .",
    "we note that the same detection criteria are imposed on both the first and second events because determinations of the binary parameters such as the mass ratio requires not just simple detections of the companion signature but equally well - determined timescales of both events .",
    "we also note that the criteria imposed on the current and future surveys are the same for impartial comparison of the event rate . in figure",
    "[ fig : one ] , we present an example lightcurve of an event that barely passes the imposed detection criteria",
    ".      for each event passed the detection criteria , its contribution to the total event rate is computed such that @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the matter density along the line of sight , the factor @xmath94 is included to account for the increase of the number of source stars with the increase of @xmath12 , @xmath95 is the lens - source transverse speed , and @xmath96 represents the lensing cross - section .",
    "the lensing cross - section is proportional to to the physical size of the einstein radius , i.e.  @xmath97 .",
    "since events can be detected even when the source does not enter the einstein ring , we set the upper limit of the impact parameter large enough to account for the contribution of these events to the event rate . although our estimation of the event rate is based on numerical calculation to consider detectability depending on the observational conditions , we note that a general analytic expression for the rate is found in @xcite .",
    "lll capture & @xmath98 ( @xmath99 ) & @xmath100 ( @xmath101 ) + fission & @xmath102 ( @xmath103 ) & @xmath104 ( @xmath105 ) + fragmentation & @xmath106 ( @xmath107 ) & @xmath108 ( @xmath109 ) +    in table  [ table : two ] , we summarize the resulting rate of repeating binary lensing events expected from the current and next - generation microlensing surveys under various binary mass function models .",
    "the values in the parentheses are the fractions of repeating events out of the total single lensing events expected when there is no binary lens .",
    "we find that the rate of total single lensing events is @xmath110 events / yr for current surveys and @xmath111 events / yr for future surveys . from the table ,",
    "one finds that the rate of repeating events from the future survey is @xmath11247 times higher than that of the current survey depending on the adopted models of the binary mass function , reaching @xmath113@xmath114 per year .",
    "considering 3.7-year lifetime of the _ mpf _ mission and assuming a binary fraction of @xmath115 @xcite , the total number of binary events expected to be detected via the repeating channel would be @xmath116350 events , which is large enough for the statistical investigation of the binary properties .",
    "then , why is the rate of repeating events much higher in future lensing surveys .",
    "we find two reasons for this .",
    "the first is the greatly enhanced sensitivity of the future survey to events associated with faint source stars .",
    "this can be seen in figure  [ fig : two ] , where we present the distributions of source brightness of the second part of the repeating events detectable by the current and future surveys under the capture model of the binary mass function . from the distributions",
    ", one finds that while the current survey is sensitive only to stars brighter than @xmath117 , the future survey would be sensitive to stars up to @xmath118 .",
    "lensing observation by the current ground - based survey is limited by crowding . on the other hand ,",
    "the space - based _ mpf _ mission can resolve stars deeper down the luminosity function , where there exist much more numerous stars . as a result",
    ", the event rate of the future survey would be much higher than the rate of the current survey despite the coverage of substantially smaller field of view .",
    "another factor that contributes to the higher detection rate of repeating events is the elevated sensitivity to low - magnification events .",
    "to demonstrate this , we plot the distributions of the impact parameters in figure  [ fig : three ] . from the comparison of the distributions",
    ", one finds that the average impact parameter of the events detectable by the future survey is substantially larger than the average value of the events detectable by the current survey , implying that the future survey will be sensitive to lower - magnification events . with the increase of the threshold impact parameter",
    ", the detection efficiency of repeating events also increases .",
    "then , what are the separation range of binaries to be detected through the channel of repeating events ?",
    "another important quantity related to the observational side is the wait times between the two separate parts of repeating events , @xmath119 . in figure",
    "[ fig : four ] , we present the distributions of the binary separations and wait times .",
    "we find that the separation distribution peaks at @xmath120 au , but it extends considerable separations up to 100 au .",
    "therefore , the repeating channel would provide sample of binaries with a wide range of separations .",
    "the most typical wait time is @xmath121 days and extends up to 1000 days .",
    "binaries can be detected and characterized by various other methods including photometric , spectroscopic , and imaging observations of eclipsing , spectroscopic , and visual binaries , respectively .",
    "studies of binaries with microlensing have the following advantages over these other methods .",
    "first , while other methods require long - term observations , especially for wide - separation binaries , microlensing method can detect and characterize binaries from much shorter - term observations .",
    "second , unlike other methods , microlensing method has no bias against dark or faint binary components .",
    "third , while most other methods can be applicable only to binaries located relatively at small distances from the earth , binaries to be detected by lensing surveys will be located at galactic - scale distances .",
    "fourth , next - generation lensing surveys will be able to produce a homogeneous sample of large binaries .",
    "therefore , microlensing technique will be able to provide better statistics of galactic population of binaries .",
    "we explored the usefulness of future lensing surveys in the study of binary properties by using the binary sample detectable through a channel of repeating events . to demonstrate this",
    ", we estimated the rate of repeating events based on standard models of mass function and dynamical and physical distributions of galactic matter combined with models of binary separation and companion mass function . from this",
    ", we found that the total number of repeating events expected to be detected from @xmath0-year space - based survey would be @xmath1400 , which is @xmath250 times higher than the rate of current surveys , and the range of binary separations to be covered by lensing extends to up to 100 au .",
    "we found that the high detection rate is due to the greatly improved sensitivity of the future survey to events associated with faint source stars and low - magnification events .",
    "therefore , the future lensing surveys will provide a homogeneous binary sample that will allow to investigate the statistical properties of galactic binaries unbiased by the brightness of the binary components ."
