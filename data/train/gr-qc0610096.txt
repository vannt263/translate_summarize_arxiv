    "<S> we use results by kirilin to show that in general relativity the nonleading terms in the energy - momentum tensor of a particle depends on the parameterization of the gravitational field . while the classical metric that is calculated from this source , used to define the leading long - distance corrections to the metric , also has a parameteriztion dependence , it can be removed by a coordinate change . </S>",
    "<S> thus the classical observables are parameterization independent . </S>",
    "<S> the quantum effects that emerge within the same calculation of the metric also depend on the parameterization and a full quantum calculation requires the inclusion of further diagrams . </S>",
    "<S> however , within a given parameterization the quantum effects calculated by us in a previous paper are well defined . </S>",
    "<S> flaws of kirilin s proposed alternate metric definition are described and we explain why the diagrams that we calculated are the appropriate ones .    in @xcite , we calculated the long distance one loop corrections to the energy momentum tensor of spin zero and spin one - half particles due to graviton loops and used this result to derive the long distance corrections to the metric . </S>",
    "<S> the diagrams are shown in figure 1 . </S>",
    "<S> this procedure reproduces the leading classical nonlinearities in the schwarzschild and kerr metrics - in harmonic gauge - and produces novel quantum corrections linear in @xmath0 .    as noted in our paper , </S>",
    "<S> this calculation is not a full quantum calculation . </S>",
    "<S> the metric is not a fully quantum concept and further diagrams are needed in order to produce a proper quantum amplitude . indeed , in the companion paper @xcite , we completed the calculation of the classical and quantum corrections to the gravitational scattering amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> the full set of diagrams is shown in figure 2 . </S>",
    "<S> this result has also been calculated by khriplovich and kirilin @xcite and our results agree .    in the preceding comment @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , kirilin criticizes our choice of diagrams to include in the definition of the metric , and proposes a metric derived from the work on the scattering amplitude @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this criticism is based on a calculation which shows that the metric derived from fig 1 is not invariant under the reparameterization of the graviton field . </S>",
    "<S> this is interesting and appears to be correct - we will comment further below . </S>",
    "<S> it implies that when discussing the quantum corrections to the metric one must specify not only the gauge but also the field parameterization . </S>",
    "<S> however , we will argue that our definition of the metric is still to be preferred and that the one proposed by kirilin has a number of flaws .      </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting that the energy - momentum tensor depends on the gravitational field parameterization . in non - gravitational theories , the energy and momentum are well defined quantities and </S>",
    "<S> such a matrix element suffers no ambiguities . </S>",
    "<S> however , in general relativity , noether s theorem does not produce a well defined energy because the action is invariant under general coordinate transformations . </S>",
    "<S> this feature is manifest in the one loop corrections to the particle s energy , and also in the shift of the gravitational vertices . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the @xmath2-dependent modification of the classical component arises from the energy and momentum contained in the classical gravitational field surrounding a particle , which in the loop expansion is described by fig 1a @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the energy - momentum tensor for the gravitational field is a pseudo - tensor that depends on the field parameterization ( i.e. on @xmath2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the variation in that tensor means that the amount of energy and momentum that is carried in the classical field also varies with the parameterization . </S>",
    "<S> the variation in the quantum component comes from this effect , plus an additional change which results from a shift in the two graviton ( @xmath10 ) coupling , which is involved in figs . </S>",
    "<S> 1b .    using the energy momentum tensor as the source , we calculated in @xcite the change in the metric by inverting the linear gravitational field equations in harmonic gauge , @xmath11 and this result then also depends on the parameterization .    </S>",
    "<S> let us here comment particularly on the classical component , for which this procedure is very well defined . </S>",
    "<S> the result for the classical fields @xmath12 are found to be @xmath13 \\nonumber\\\\ h_{ij } & = & -\\frac{2gm}{r}\\left[\\delta_{ij } + \\frac{gm}{2r}\\left ( ( \\delta_{ij } + \\frac{r_ir_j}{r^2})- a(3\\delta_{ij } -4\\frac{r_ir_j}{r^2})\\right)+ ... \\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since classical observables can not depend on the field parameterization , it is interesting to see how the parameterization dependence disappears . </S>",
    "<S> let us form the total metric from @xmath12 through the use of eq 1 . </S>",
    "<S> we find @xmath14 \\nonumber\\\\ g_{ij } & = & -\\delta_{ij } -\\frac{2gm}{r}\\left[\\delta_{ij } + \\frac{gm}{2r}\\left ( ( \\delta_{ij } + \\frac{r_ir_j}{r^2})- 2 a(\\delta_{ij } -2\\frac{r_ir_j}{r^2})\\right)+ ... \\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as noted in @xcite , the iterated paramterization dependence from eq 1 cancels the other @xmath2 dependence in @xmath15 , leaving a parameterization independent result . </S>",
    "<S> however , the same does not occur in @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> this correction is interesting . in the first place , it shifts the metric away from the harmonic gauge . </S>",
    "<S> the correct form of the harmonic gauge metric , i.e. satisfying @xmath17 , is recovered in the @xmath18 limit . for a general parameterization </S>",
    "<S> we find @xmath19 so we see that the parameterization change is also associated with a change of gauge . </S>",
    "<S> however , because it is simply a gauge change , a change of coordinates of the form @xmath20 can be used to bring convert the metric back to harmonic gauge form . thus classical observables are invariant under the parameterization change .    </S>",
    "<S> the quantum parameterization dependence can not be removed by a change in coordinates . </S>",
    "<S> the consequence of this residual dependence is that , when performing the calculation of a full quantum amplitude , one must take care to use the same field paramaterization for the entire calculation . </S>",
    "<S> this aspect is not unique to gravity . </S>",
    "<S> for example , in the internucleon potential , a reparameterization of the pion field modifies the central nuclear potential @xcite , although the sum of pionic exchanges and the central potential is invariant . in both cases , </S>",
    "<S> a consistent calculation of intermediate results must involve a full specification of the field variables , which in the gravitational case means both the gauge and the field definition .    </S>",
    "<S> kirilin @xcite proposes instead to use a different definition of the metric , based on the full set of diagrams shown in fig 2 . </S>",
    "<S> we do not feel that this alternative definition is acceptable . </S>",
    "<S> flaws of this set of diagrams include :    \\1 ) these diagrams do not reproduce the classical corrections to the metric . </S>",
    "<S> instead they reproduce the classical terms in the post - newtonian potential . </S>",
    "<S> these are _ not _ the same . </S>",
    "<S> as discussed above , our diagrams capture the correct classical metric corrections . </S>",
    "<S> there are additional classical corrections are found in diagrams 2.f - j , shifting the result to the post - newtonian potential rather than the metric . </S>",
    "<S> kirilin s set of diagrams does not give the correct classical metric .    </S>",
    "<S> \\2 ) the diagrams of fig . 2 form a gauge - invariant set . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the metric depends very explicitly on the gauge for the gravitational field . in @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> the authors correct for this deficiency by hand , but the correct gauge dependence is not a feature of either the classical or quantum components of these diagrams .    </S>",
    "<S> \\3 ) the diagrams proposed by kirilin depend on the existence of a second non - relativistic particle in the diagrams . </S>",
    "<S> for example , it includes the vertex correction to the gravitational vertex of the _ other _ particle , fig 2b . </S>",
    "<S> the classical corrections depend on the mass of the other particle , and there exist terms in the interaction that depend on the spin of the other particle . </S>",
    "<S> there is also no indication that the same result would be obtained if the other particle were an ultra - relativistic particle such as a photon . of course </S>",
    "<S> , one can deal with these features in an ad - hoc way by taking one mass much larger than the other and excising the spin dependence by hand . </S>",
    "<S> however , the basic feature of a metric is that it is the property of a single object independent of the existence of a second body . </S>",
    "<S> these diagrams do not have that property .    </S>",
    "<S> \\4 ) the mechanism that is required in order to obtain the invariance of the classical observables , described above and in @xcite , does not work with the classical part of the diagrams of fig . 2 but does if one uses those of fig . 1 .    </S>",
    "<S> \\5 ) in the case of electromagnetic corrections to the metric , there is no ambiguity due to reparameterization of the gravitational field , because gravity in this case is purely classical . here </S>",
    "<S> , both the diagrams corresponding to fig 1 and fig 2 have been calculated @xcite , and it has been demonstrated that the diagrams of figure 1 give the correct metric . </S>",
    "<S> kirilin s procedure in this case would be incorrect . </S>",
    "<S> the above comments 1 - 4 also apply to the photonic calculation .    </S>",
    "<S> our definition of the metric includes the full set of one - loop diagrams for the gravitational field around a single body . </S>",
    "<S> it reproduces correctly the classical terms in the metric , and displays the correct gauge dependence . </S>",
    "<S> it parallels the well - defined corrections due to photonic loops . </S>",
    "<S> because of the parameterization dependence of the energy - momentum matrix element , the metric also displays a parameterization dependence . </S>",
    "<S> however , the classical dependence within these diagrams is exactly what is required in order that classical observables be parameterization independent . </S>",
    "<S> kirilin s alternate definition is shown to be inappropriate for the classical components . </S>",
    "<S> while the metric is not a full quantum calculation , within a given parameterization our definition can be completed to give the calculation of the full quantum amplitude . in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we stand by our choice of diagrams describing the classical and quantum corrections to the metric . </S>"
