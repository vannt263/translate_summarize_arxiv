    "the quantum measurement postulate is often viewed as the most intriguing assumption of quantum physics .",
    "much of it has been demystified by the study of the physics of quantum measurements .",
    "the dynamics of the measurement process can be described by a coupled many - body hamiltonian , consisting of the system to be measured and the detector with a heat bath component @xcite .",
    "thus , the measurement process can be investigated using the established tools of quantum mechanics of open systems @xcite .",
    "most interest has been focused on the physics of weak measurements , where the system - observer coupling can be treated within perturbation theory .",
    "famously , this research has shown that only a certain class of measurements satisfy von neumann s quantum measurement postulate @xcite and indeed project the system wavefunction onto an eigenstate of the measured observable .",
    "measurements of this type are termed quantum nondemolition ( qnd ) measurements . within the weak measurement paradigm ,",
    "the qnd regime is achieved when the measured observable is a constant of the free motion and commutes with the system - detector coupling hamiltonian .",
    "weak qnd measurements have been investigated in various systems , ranging from spins to oscillators and even photons @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of the weak measurement process has practical relevance in the context of quantum computing .",
    "specifically , superconducting qubits have been proposed as building blocks of a scalable quantum computer @xcite , and a fast measurement with a high resolution and visibility is important for readout and also for error correction .",
    "there are a variety of different measurement techniques used in superconducting qubits .",
    "weak measurements can be performed using single - electron transistors @xcite .",
    "a different approach is the switching measurement , where the detector switches out of a metastable state depending on the state of the qubit @xcite .",
    "such switching measurements have been a quite successful readout scheme for many superconducting qubit experiments to date",
    ". however , the dissipative nature of the switching process imposes limitations on the measurement speed and perturbs the qubit state .",
    "a qnd measurement could be achieved by using a pointer system , and measuring one of its observables influenced by the state of the qubit @xcite .",
    "recent developments of such detection schemes , using an oscillator as the pointer , have led to vast improvements @xcite over previous measurement protocols .",
    "it has previously been shown @xcite that infinitesimally short interaction between a qubit and an oscillator is sufficient to imprint information about the state of the oscillator onto the qubit .",
    "the similar idea of using a short interaction to transfer information about the qubit into the oscillator has been used @xcite in a dispersive readout scheme . in this case , after a short interaction , the state of the oscillator contains information about the qubit which can be extracted by further measuring one of its observables , for example , momentum .",
    "however , this scheme did not take possible bit flip errors into account .",
    "these errors may occur in the short yet finite time when the qubit is in contact with its environment .",
    "thus , the full power of a quasi - instantaneous measurement has not yet been explored .    in this paper",
    "we describe the effect of an ideally extremely short and arbitrarily strong interaction of a qubit with its environment ( consisting of a weakly damped harmonic oscillator ) .",
    "we investigate the back - action on the qubit when the measured observable does not commute with the hamiltonian describing the interaction with the environment , and study how close this result approximates the qnd measurement .",
    "we study a setup consisting of a flux qubit inductively coupled to a dc - squid magnetometer .",
    "the flux qubit consists of a superconducting loop with three josephson junctions @xcite . for flux bias near odd half - integer multiple of @xmath0 , the qubit",
    "is represented by two circulating current states with opposite directions . during the entire measurement process",
    "the squid is coupled to measurement circuitry , with associated dissipative elements .",
    "however , it never switches out of the zero dc - voltage state .",
    "the qubit - squid interaction of arbitrary strength is turned on only for a short time by applying a very short bias current pulse to the latter . during this time",
    ", information about the qubit is imprinted onto the squid and can later be extracted from it during the post - interaction phase by monitoring voltage oscillations across the device . when the current pulse is switched off ,",
    "the qubit - squid interaction ideally vanishes and the environment no longer perturbs the qubit .",
    "thus , one can afford a long time to measure the squid and determine the state of the qubit .",

    "@xcite , we model the qubit - squid system by a two - level system linearly coupled to a dissipative oscillator .",
    "we describe the evolution of this system by means of a master equation in the born - markov approximation @xcite , valid for the underdamped squid . in section [ results ]",
    "we discuss the qubit - oscillator evolution during both interaction and post - interaction phases .",
    "we study the qubit dephasing and relaxation during the interaction phase .",
    "we show that , at the end of this phase , the qubit appears completely dephased .",
    "in other words , the qubit has been measured and its information has been transferred in the form of a classical probability to the oscillator . during the same time interval , we find that qubit relaxation has remained negligible .",
    "for the post - interaction phase we describe the evolution of the oscillator under the influence of the environment , starting from the state prepared by the interaction with the qubit . technically , extracting the qubit information amounts to measuring the amplitude of the ringdown of the oscillator momentum . in section [ implementation ]",

    "the small oscillations in these two directions can have vastly different characteristic frequencies .",
    "in particular , a small geometric inductance and a low critical current can make the flux mode frequency large while a shunt capacitor can lower the bias current mode frequency substantially . in the limit of very different frequencies , one can approximate the squid dynamics as that of a one - dimensional oscillator in the bias current direction , with the position of the oscillator minimum dependent on both @xmath6 and the total flux coupled to the squid which , for example , could vary depending on the state of the qubit .    the setup of fig .",

    "we focus on the regime where the qubit - squid interaction displaces the state by more than its zero - point fluctuation but does not yet explore the classical nonlinearity . the first consequence of the nonlinear component may be to add more phase shift to the ringdown oscillations . in the measurement protocol proposed here we assume a symmetric squid .",
