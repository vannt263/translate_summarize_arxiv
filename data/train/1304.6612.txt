    "the hybrid coherent coupling@xcite between electromagnetic and mechanical degrees of freedom is at the heart of cavity optomechanics@xcite . in general",
    ", optomechanical couplings can be classified into two categories : linear or quadratic couplings .",
    "namely , the coupling term is proportional to either @xmath0 or @xmath1 ( @xmath0 being the mechanical displacement ) . for a mechanical resonator",
    ", a linear coupling corresponds to a force acting upon the mechanical resonator and this leads to a displacement of its equilibrium position .",
    "however , for a quadratic coupling , it will change the resonant frequency of the mechanical resonator ( in the new representation , rather than in the original representation ) .",
    "this is because the quadratic - coupling term can be integrated into the potential energy of the harmonic oscillator ( changing the effective stiffness of a spring ) , and hence the frequency of the mechanical resonator is renormalized .",
    "this renormalized harmonic oscillator is related to the original one by a squeezing transformation .    to better understand and exploit optomechanical couplings ,",
    "it is highly desirable to realize these couplings in the single - photon strong - coupling regime , in which the couplings involving a single photon can produce observable effects on both mechanical and electromagnetic signals .",
    "such a regime is important to test the fundamentals of quantum theory@xcite and to explore possible applications of optomechanical devices to future quantum technology@xcite . in the past several years",
    ", much attention has been paid to the single - photon strong - coupling regime of linear coupling@xcite .",
    "considerable theoretical studies , such as photon statistics@xcite and mechanical - state engineering@xcite , have been carried out in this regime .",
    "two theoretical proposals@xcite have recently been suggested to reach this regime using superconducting circuits with josephson junctions .",
    "in addition , experimental advances in linear optomechanics are being made towards the single - photon strong - coupling regime@xcite .",
    "however , for the quadratic coupling , though much attention has been paid to this area@xcite , not much work has been devoted to the single - photon strong - coupling regime because the currently attainable coupling strength is weak .",
    "recently , some methods have been proposed to increase the quadratic optomechanical coupling strength or to seek other possible realization of quadratic optomechanics .",
    "for example , an experiment@xcite demonstrated that the quadratic coupling strength can be increased significantly using a fiber cavity with a smaller mode size , and a smaller and lighter membrane .",
    "a measurement - based method has also been proposed to obtain an effective quadratic optomechanics@xcite .",
    "in addition , some other systems , such as trapped cold atoms or a dielectric nano- or microparticle , have been suggested to simulate an effective quadratic optomechanical coupling@xcite .",
    "these works provide a possibility of studying the quantum nonlinearity in quadratic optomechanics .",
    "motivated by these advances , it is of interest to study the quadratic optomechanical coupling in the single - photon strong - coupling regime .",
    "when a quadratic optomechanical cavity works in the single - photon strong - coupling regime , the frequency change of the mechanical resonator induced by a single photon will , in turn , significantly affect the cavity field , causing some observable features in the cavity photon spectrum .",
    "thus , a natural question arises : how the spectrum may characterize the single - photon strong - coupling regime ? in this paper",
    ", we answer this question by calculating analytically the spectrum of single - photon emission and scattering .",
    "in particular , we build a connection between the spectral features and the system s inherent parameters .",
    "we also clarify the condition for observing the phonon sidebands in the spectra .",
    "it should be pointed out that below we assume that the mechanical resonator has been pre - cooled to a low - phonon - number regime . moreover ,",
    "in typical optomechanical systems , the optical decay rate @xmath2 is much larger than the mechanical decay rate @xmath3 . under these two conditions",
    ", we will only consider the optical dissipation and neglect the mechanical dissipation .",
    "this is because the emission and scattering processes will be completed in a time interval @xmath4 . during this period",
    "the mechanical dissipation is negligible . in this issue , the emission and pulse - scattering cases are different from the continuous - wave driving case . when the system is driven by a continuous - wave field , the mechanical dissipation should be included for the steady - state solution@xcite .",
    "accompanying the processes of single - photon absorbtion and emission , the total system experiences transitions involving phonon sidebands , and hence the frequency of the emitted photon will be related to the states of the phonon sidebands due to energy conservation .",
    "this relation leads to the generation of photon - phonon entanglement . since the emitted photon exists in the continuous modes of the outside fields , this entangled state involves a single mode of phonons and a set of continuous modes of a single photon . in general",
    ", it is hard to characterize such type of entanglement .",
    "however , from the point of view of a single photon rather than photon modes , we could treat this entanglement as a bipartite one between a single photon and the phonon mode .",
    "for a pure initial state , the linear entropy can be employed to describe this entanglement .",
    "we consider a quadratic optomechanical system with a  membrane - in - the - middle \" configuration [ see fig .",
    "[ setup](a ) ] , where a thin dielectric membrane is placed inside a fabry - prot cavity . we model the moving membrane as a harmonic oscillator and focus on a single - mode field in the cavity . when the membrane is placed at a node ( or antinode ) of the intracavity standing wave",
    ", the cavity field will quadratically couple to the mechanical motion of the membrane .",
    "let us denote the position and momentum operators of the membrane as @xmath0 and @xmath5 , then the hamiltonian of the system is ( with @xmath6 ) @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the creation and annihilation operators of the single - mode cavity field , respectively . in the quadratic coupling case",

    "( [ hameq1 ] ) are the mass and frequency of the mechanical mode . by reorganizing the coupling term between the zero - point energy of the optical mode and the mechanical motion into the mechanical potential energy , we have @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the renormalized frequency of the membrane .",
    "we note that it is justified to work in the representation of the mechanical frequency @xmath17 , because the coupling term @xmath18 always exists . by introducing the mechanical creation and annihilation operators @xmath19 and @xmath20 , by @xmath21 and @xmath22 , the hamiltonian , up to a constant term @xmath23 , becomes@xcite @xmath24 where @xmath25 . the third term in eq .",
    "( [ hameq3 ] ) describes a quadratic optomechanical coupling with a strength @xmath26 between the cavity field and the membrane .",
    "we point out that since the reorganized frequency @xmath17 of the mechanical mode also depends on the coupling strength @xmath26 by @xmath27 , the ratio of the coupling strength @xmath26 over the mechanical frequency @xmath17 is bounded by @xmath28 .",
    "however , below we also consider parameters by extending the scope of the ratio beyond this bound .",
    "this is because the bound can be exceeded in some other quadratical optomechanical systems , such as trapped cold atoms .",
    "when there are @xmath29 photons in the cavity , the last two terms in hamiltonian  ( [ hameq3 ] ) can be renormalized as a harmonic - oscillator hamiltonian with the resonant frequency @xmath30 . to keep the stability of the membrane ( i.e. , the frequency should be a positive number ) , the strength @xmath26 should satisfy the condition @xmath31 .",
