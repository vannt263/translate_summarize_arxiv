    "the supernova responsible for the vela supernova remnant ( snr ) exploded about 11000 years ago ( reichley , downs & morris 1970 ) . within the vela snr lies a pulsar at a distance of 287@xmath119 pc , as measured by its vlbi parallax ( dodson et al .",
    "this distance is consistent with that determined from a search for high - velocity components in high - resolution caii and nai interstellar absorption line profiles towards ob stars with _ hipparcos _ and spectroscopic parallaxes .",
    "these high - velocity components discovered by wallerstein & silk ( 1971 ) which are attributed to interactions between the local interstellar medium and the snr were assigned the distance of 290@xmath130 pc ( sushch , hnatyk & neronov 2011 ; cha , sembach & danks 1999 ) .",
    "various studies have expanded observations of the interstellar components seen in stars in the direction of the vela remnant with some studies emphasizing searches for variability of high and low velocity components with efforts concentrated on the caii k and nai d lines .",
    "this paper reports on a campaign mainly in 2011 - 2012 to obtain high - resolution profiles of the na d lines towards many ob stars in the direction of the vela snr and to compare profiles with similar data obtained in 1993 - 1996 by cha & sembach ( 2000 ) of caii k and nai d lines . as appropriate",
    ", we comment on the relationship between our nai d line profiles and other published observations towards stars behind the vela snr .",
    "nai d lines are important in several respects .",
    "they represent the behaviour of neutral gas .",
    "it is now clear that the vela snr s expansion proceeded in a cloudy interstellar medium .",
    "earlier studies of the absorption lines towards various stars suggested that the high velocity ( @xmath2 km s@xmath3 ) components , mainly present in caii lines , represent the shocked gas that had interacted with the snr ( wallerstein , silk & jenkins 1980 ; jenkins , silk & wallerstein 1984 ) .",
    "however , as pointed out by sushch , hnatyk & neronov ( 2011 ) , although the distance to the snr is 290 @xmath1 20 pc , the high velocity absorption components are present only in stars more distant than 500 pc and stars with distances smaller than 350 pc do not show evidence of 100 km s@xmath3 absorption components .",
    "stars at or immediately behind the snr show components of intermediate velocity , which are well represented by nai lines along with the caii k lines .",
    "thus , the nai components might be from the neutral ism that is interacting with the snr and surroundings .",
    "the vela snr has a diameter of about 7.3 degrees on the sky ( aschenbach 1993 ; aschenbach , egger & trumper 1995 ) .",
    "figure 1 shows the remnant and the locations of most of the stars observed in our na d survey .",
    "the optical image covering a field of 9.3@xmath4 x 8.5@xmath4 from davide de martin ( www.skyfactory.org ) is compiled from aao , uk schmidt and digital sky survey images .",
    "cha & sembach s ( 2000 ) multi - star survey was based on a target list of 68 ob stars observed at high spectral resolution in 1993 , 1994 and 1996 .",
    "a selection of the target list was observed more than once and slightly more than half of the 68 stars observed for caii were observed also at nai . of the 13 stars observed twice , seven proved to have variable absorption line profiles .",
    "our survey principally from 2011 and 2012 provides only nai profiles for the majority of cha & sembach s 68 stars and expands their baseline of three years to 15 to 18 years .",
    "whenever possible , other high - resolution profiles in the literature are included in the discussion of variability .",

    "our extension of their analysis uses the full dataset provided by cha & sembach ( 2000 ) with new information on the na d profiles for stars observed by them at the k line but not the na d line .",
    "additional information on high - velocity gas is modest because high - velocity components are rarely observed in the na d profiles .",
    "our evaluation of @xmath32(ca , na ) is made for about 40 stars for which equivalent widths are available for both the caii k and the nai d lines .",
    "all of the k line profiles are taken from cha & sembach ( 2000 ) .",
    "for those k line profiles for which cha & sembach did not provide a d line profile that profile is taken from the vbt observations with the assumption that the profile has not changed in the 15 - 18 year interval .",
    "we limit the study to components with lsr peculiar velocities greater than @xmath120 km s@xmath3 to avoid the strong ( saturated ) foreground clouds , a limit close to that suggested by cha et al .",
    "( 1999 ) as a representative ( minimum ) velocity for clouds shocked by the snr .",
    "for the stronger na d lines ( equivalent width greater than 100 m ) we used the doublet method to derive column densities .",
    "almost all the k line equivalent widths are less than 100 m  and were assumed to be optically thin , the same assumption was adopted by cha & sembach ( 2000 ) .",
    "the plot of @xmath32(ca , na ) versus @xmath34 from 20 to 200 km s@xmath3 not surprisingly is similar to that ( their figure 3 ) provided by danks & sembach ( 1995 ) .    at the ` low ' velocities from @xmath34 of 20 to about 50 km s@xmath3 , @xmath32(ca , na ) increases steeply from about unity to about 20 with a large scatter all velocities . at higher velocities , @xmath32(ca , na ) appears to attain an approximately constant value of 10 with a large scatter and with many lower limits arising from the non - detection of the na d lines . the observed scatter at low and high velocities most probably exceeds the measurement errors . with the possible exception of the @xmath32(ca , na ) values at the lowest considered velocities , all values are greater than values reported by sembach & danks ( 1994 ) for diffuse interstellar clouds for which @xmath32(ca , na ) does not attain a value of 10 until peculiar velocities exceed about 50 km s@xmath3 .",
    "danks & sembach ( 1995 ) suggest that although ( incomplete ) dust destruction in shocked gas may explain high @xmath32(ca , na ) values , clouds with low @xmath32(ca , na ) values may be found in gas which is in process of being compressed and accelerated .",
    "testing this suggestion will require high - resolution ultraviolet spectra and thus access to more diagnostic lines .",
    "interstellar absorption line studies towards a few other snrs have been reported in the literature but no study approaches the richness achieved for the vela snr and , in particular , no other snr has been exposed to precision spectroscopy at more than a single epoch .",

    "the na d@xmath17 profile in 2011 closely resembles that from 1993 ( figure 5 ) . in 1993 and 1996 , the only evidence for high - velocity interstellar gas was a weak ( 5 m ) k line component at @xmath76 km s@xmath3 . this did not then or in 2011 appear in the d line profiles .    *",
    "hd 74194 : * this star was observed at the vbt in 2008 april .",
    "the star showed several high - velocity blue - shifted components in the 1993 and 1996 k line spectra obtained by cha & sembach .",

    "the equivalent width is reported as 34@xmath84 m  for 1994 and 25@xmath84 for 1996 , a decreases of 26% but apparently insufficient for cha & sembach to deem it a variable component .",
    "this blue - shifted component was not detectable in the d lines in 1994 and it was similarly absent in our 2011 spectrum ( figure 5 ) .    *",
    "hd 75129 : * the 1996 k line profile showed high - velocity components at @xmath85 and @xmath86 km s@xmath3 flanking stronger low - velocity absorption near 0 km s@xmath3 .",
    "a na d profile was not obtained by cha & sembach .",
    "our 2011 march d line profile shows no high - velocity components but this can not be taken as an evolutionary trend because high - velocity components generally appear weaker in the d than the k line .    *",
    "hd 75309 : * this line of sight has , perhaps , the most interesting k line profile of those presented by cha & sembach from their 1993 and 1996 observations .",

    "the 1993 d line profile shows none of these high - velocity components and their absence and the absence of all high - velocity absorption in the d lines is confirmed by our 2011 observation ( figure 6 ) . of especial interest",

    "these observations confirm the presence in 2008 of the @xmath87 and @xmath91 km s@xmath3 k line components .",
    "pakhomov et al .",
    "combine the 1993 , 1996 , and 2008 profiles to claim that the blue- and red - shifted high - velocity components are increasing their velocity separation at about 0.7 km s@xmath3 yr@xmath3 as though the centre of expansion were between their locations .",
    "the d line in 2008 was devoid of high - velocity absorption .    *",
    "hd 75821 : * this star provides the rare example of a line of sight in which high - velocity components are seen in both the k and the d lines .",
    "hd 75821 was one of the stars for which cha & sembach identified variable i high - velocity absorption among a complex of k and d lines at velocities of @xmath93 and @xmath94 km s@xmath3 .",
    "these d line components are detected in vbt spectra from 2007 , 2011 and 2012 .",
    "the trends seen from 1993 to 1996 continue ; the @xmath94 km s@xmath3 line almost disappears by 2007 while @xmath93 km s@xmath3 line gets stronger and is apparently accelerated by 2007 .",
    "figures 16 and 17 show the high - velocity component for the d@xmath17 line from 1993 , 1996 , 2007 and 2012 with figure 17 showing that this component is being accelerated from @xmath86 km s@xmath3 in 1993 to @xmath95 km s@xmath3 in 2012 .",
    "a weak feature at @xmath96 km s@xmath3 seems to be present in the d@xmath17 line from 1993 to 2012 and to move to more negative velocities with time .",
    "thus , not only high velocity features but even low velocity features are accelerated .    *",
    "hd 76534 : * this line of sight provided a component at @xmath97 km s@xmath3 in a 1994 k line observation with nothing detectable at this velocity in the d lines .",
    "our d line profile ( figure 6 ) confirms the absence of absorption at around @xmath97 km s@xmath3",
    ". however , there may be a weak component about -150 km s@xmath3 in both the cha & sembach s and vbt profiles .    in a simple interpretation ,",
    "high - velocity components are associated with the rim of the expanding snr with blue - shifted lines originating from the nearside and red - shifted lines from the far side . combining the snr distance of 287 pc with the 7.3 degree angular size ,",
    "one obtains a snr radius of about 18 pc .",
    "figure 18 shows the velocities of high and low velocity components seen in stars of different distances . the striking feature of figure 18 is the absence of high - velocity components in stars at about the distance of the snr , as indicated by the location of the pulsar , and their first appearance in stars at distances of about 600 pc , an observation made earlier by sushch et al .",
    "the nearly 300 pc difference between the location of the pulsar and closest stars showing high velocity components is an unexplained puzzle .",
    "the spectral region covered at the vbt includes other possible interstellar lines including the lii 6707  resonance doublet and the ki resonance lines at 7685 and 7698 .",
    "the lithium lines are of interest because energetic particles in the snr might produce li - both @xmath98li and @xmath99li - by spallation reactions .",
    "lithium isotopic ratios indicative of spallation have been reported for lines of sight near the snr ic 348 and ic 343 ( knauth et al .",
    "2000 , 2003 ; taylor et al .",
    "the resolving power and s / n ratio of the vbt spectra are inadequate for useful determinations of the lithium isotopic ratio",
    ". visual inspection of the spectra does not indicate lines of sight with lii absorption of unusual strength . in light of the fact that regions within and near the snr may have greater than average ionization rates for neutral lithium , analysis of the 6707",
    "should be made relative to the strength of a ki line .    regarding the ki lines at 7665 and 7698  , pakhomov et al .",
    "( 2012 ) suggested that interstellar ki lines in the direction of the vela snr are not detected for stars with distances d @xmath25 600 pc and then become sharply stronger for stars with distances d @xmath24 600 pc .",
    "they interpret this as due to an underpopulation of dense interstellar clouds until a distance of 600 pc .",
    "they go on to say that this ` hollow ' in the distribution of ki clouds might be due to the dynamical evolution of gum nebula .",
    "apparently , the gum supershell is known to be depopulated by neutral gas clouds between 350 - 570 pc ( woermann , gaylard & otrucek 2001 ) .",
    "this assertion is contradicted by our observations , for example , the hipparcos distance to hd 76838 is 336@xmath1 59 pc yet the sight line shows fairly strong ki lines ( figure 19 ) .",
    "the distance to the star is about that of the vela pulsar and our observation suggests cold dense clouds are not uncommon at distances of less than 600 pc .",
    "we have detected the ki 7698   line in eight stars out off 31 that are within a hipparcos distance of 600 pc in our survey and in two out of 21 below 500 pc .",
    "we plan to discuss our observations of the ki and lii lines and diffuse interstellar bands ( dibs ) in a later paper . for the present ,",
    "existence of cold dense clouds in the vela snr region is shown to be a reality .",
    "interstellar lines seen in spectra of stars lying behind the vela snr differ in two principal respects from interstellar lines produced by the diffuse interstellar gas along the typical of line of sight through the milky way .",
    "these two differences , which are exhibited by the na d lines whose evolution over nearly two decades was the focus of this paper , suggest that the key to understanding the two differences is to be found in interactions between the snr remnant and the gas now embedded in the remnant",
    ". such gas may be part of the remnant , circumstellar gas earlier ejected by the star or interstellar gas swept up by the expanding remnant .        the first difference between na d absorption along sight lines through the vela snr and typical sight lines in the milky way concerns the presence of high - velocity components .",
    "many of the observed lines of sight crossing the vela snr show high - velocity absorption components . when multiple observations are available , such components prove to be variable on a timescale of a few years ( cha & sembach 2000 ) .",
    "high - velocity absorption is particularly well seen in ions such as siiv and civ through their ultraviolet resonance lines ( jenkins , silk & wallerstein 1976 ; jenkins et al .",
    "1981 ; jenkins , wallerstein & silk 1984 ) . as jenkins et al .",
    "( 1984 ) remark  the velocity distribution of the triply ionized gas is probably representative of the kinematics of the vela remnant since gas at such a high ionization is not commonly seen in the general interstellar medium . \"",
    "unfortunately , a general lack of repeat observations of high resolution ultraviolet spectra means that reports of the variability of the high velocity absorption are limited to scarce repeat observations of the caii k line ( cha & sembach 2000 ) and of the na d line but the latter almost never shows strong components at high velocity ( cha & sembach 2000 ; this paper ) .",
    "the high velocity components are considered to arise from the passage of the supernova s blast wave through an inhomogeneous medium- see jenkins et al .",
    "( 1984 ) , jenkins & wallerstein ( 1995 ) and sushch et al .",
    "destruction of grains by the blast wave likely accounts for the lower depletion of nonvolatile elements and , hence , the high ratio of n ( caii ) to ( nai ) .",
    "however , it is still unclear why high velocity components ( in caii k ) occur only in stars more distant than 600 pc when the snr is at a distance of 290 @xmath100 pc ( figure 18 ) .",
    "the second example of a distinct characteristic of interstellar lines , specifically na d lines , through and near the vela snr is that four of the sightlines observed both with the vbt and by cha & sembach show dramatic changes in the na d profiles at low velocity . across the extensive literature on interstellar na d lines there are no reports of such large changes in na d profiles from the quiescent diffuse interstellar medium .",
    "the closest example may be the sightline to the halo star hd 219188 ( galactic latitude of @xmath101 degrees ) which showed a factor of three growth in na d column density of the high - velocity gas from 1997 to 2000 but no detectable change in several low velocity na d components ( welty & fitzpatrick 2001 ; welty 2007 ) .",
    "in addition to the few examples of sightlines near the vela snr with large changes in na d equivalent widths , some sightlines show small changes in equivalent widths of low velocity components . a clear example is hd 72127a ( hobbs et al . 1982 ; welty et al . 2008 ) .",
    "there are a few examples of ( small ) profile changes involving the general interstellar medium - see , for example @xmath102 leo ( lauroesch & meyer 2003 ) .",
    "such changes are generally attributed to the line of sight to the star changing as star and interstellar cloud move and different portions of an inhomogeneous cloud are sampled .",
    "little attention has been given to time dependent changes of the physical conditions in the clouds .",
    "for the four examples identified here of dramatic changes in the na d profiles , time dependent changes may be competing with geometric changes .    in three of the four cases of large changes of equivalent width associated with the vela snr ",
    "hd 63578 , hd 68217 and hd 76161  the low velocity blend observed in 1993 - 1996 was very much weaker by 2011 - 2012 . in the fourth case ",
    "hd 68243  the vbt spectra from 2011 and 2012 showed a strengthening relative to the 1994 profile obtained by cha & sembach .",
    "sight lines , as shown in figure 20 , to three of these stars ",
    "hd 68217 , hd 76161 and hd 68243  pass close to the edge of the rosat 0.1 - 2.4 kev image ( aschenbach et al .",
    "hd 68217 may located behind a vela snr x - ray bullet , the extension e as shown in figure 20 .",
    "the hipparcos distances of 383@xmath130 , 318@xmath150 , and 240 pc respectively of this trio suggests a physical connection with the snr ( distance of 290 @xmath130 pc ) .",
    "the strong na d lines present in 1993 - 94 period imply large column densities : n(nai ) of about @xmath1031.6x10@xmath104 @xmath105 for hd 76161 ( welsh et al .",
    "2010 ) and a n(hi ) column density of @xmath1031.5x10@xmath106 @xmath105 , assuming the relation between n(nai ) and n(hi ) for an average ism cloud ( welty 2007 ) . for the size of a neutral cloud , as estimated by pakhomov et al .",
    "( 2012 ) in the vicinity of hd 76161 in vela of 0.85 pc would suggest a density of n(h ) of 580 @xmath107 .",
    "destruction of such a cloud by supernova blast wave as pictured in vela snr by bocchino , maggio & sciortino ( 1999 ) and pakhomov et al .",
    "( 2012 ) seem to require several thousands of years .",
    "the time scale of 17 to 18 years , as observed , for the disappearance of the clouds appears to be too short for a supernova shock .",
    "some other rapid cloud destruction mechanisms seem to be operative .",
    "however , one is tempted to argue that physical conditions in these particular low velocity clouds were affected by the snr remnant : increased photoionization of na by x rays or removal of neutral na atoms ?",
    "the sightline to hd 63578 , the fourth star with a large change in na d strength , does not pass near the snr and its x ray emission . at the distance of 481 pc , hd 63578",
    "is located behind the wind swept bubble of @xmath0 vel .",
    "it is well known that high velocity winds from wolf - rayet stars and , in particular , @xmath0 vel are clumpy ( lepine , eversberg & moffat 1999 ) and strong with wind velocities of 1500 km s@xmath3 ( de marco , schmutz & crowther 2000 ) .",
    "perhaps , a clump was crossing the line of sight at the time of the vbt observations",
    ".    continued pursuit of variations in the interstellar lines along sightlines through and near the vela snr is to be encouraged . to expand the insights into the principal variations described here",
    "it will be helpful to obtain high - resolution optical spectra over a broad wavelength range such that caii k and na d lines are both recorded along with a host of weaker atomic and molecular lines . these spectra will serve to follow up the principal discovery of this paper , namely large variations  increases and decreases  in low velocity components of na d lines and , in particular , provide the first opportunity to map out long term changes in the caii k line profiles relative to the 1993 - 1996 baseline established by cha & sembach ( 2000 ) .",
    "more difficult to obtain but more insightful about the high velocity components and their variations will be high - resolution ultraviolet spectra . in this case",
    ", the start of the baseline would appear to be the series of iue spectra obtained in 1979 - 1981 and discussed by jenkins et al .",
