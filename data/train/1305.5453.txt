    "in the ionization region of conventional magnetrons the electron pressure is negligibly small compared to the confining magnetic pressure . under the extreme conditions of a hipims discharge ,",
    "however , this may not be the case .",
    "we calculate the pressure of the highly energetic ( or _ hot _ ) electrons localized in the spoke and argue that they possess enough free energy to trigger an anomalous diffusion process . to that end",
    ", we construct an effective kinetic equation for the spoke - averaged hot electron distribution function @xmath4 .",
    "the spoke volume is @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the area ( seen from the top ) , and @xmath7 is the height ( seen from the side ) .",
    "further dynamic quantities are the cold electron density @xmath8 , with temperature @xmath9 , and the ion density @xmath10.quasineutrality holds and reads @xmath11 we assume that the hot electrons enter the spoke region with energy @xmath12 at a rate @xmath13 . here , @xmath14 is the secondary electron emission coefficient and @xmath15 is the ion flux that reaches the target with the characteristic bohm velocity @xmath16 .",
    "moreover , we have introduced the ion lifetime @xmath17 . confined by the magnetic field and the target potential ,",
    "the electrons undergo a bouncing motion until they have lost all their energy by interaction with the gas and metal neutrals ( and emerge as _",
    "cold_),or until they have diffused out of the ionization region .",
    "with respect to the ionization channel , we assume that the newly generated electrons are cold , and introduce an effective collision frequency @xmath18 and an effective ionization energy @xmath19 , i.e. the frequency at which electron - ion pairs are generated , and the average dissipated energy respectively.for argon , @xmath20 at high electron energies @xcite.we set @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the average lifetime of the hot electrons with respect to the volume losses , i.e. inelastic collision processes.for the diffusion losses , we define a loss frequency @xmath23.these considerations allow us to formulate the kinetic equation for the hot electrons as @xmath24 the boundary condition at @xmath25 expresses the assumption that the total influx @xmath26 of hot electrons is distributed over the spoke volume @xmath27 : @xmath28 the balance equation for the ions accounts for volume generation by ionization and surface losses by diffusion to the wall , @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the minimal hot electron energy , i.e. about 10@xmath31 . + thus , we obtain a set of coupled differential equations , governed by the three time constants @xmath32 , @xmath22 , and @xmath33.the system can be reduced by observing that the pde ( [ kineq ] ) is solved by any function of the type @xmath34 ; the boundary condition ( [ bbc ] ) then gives the distribution @xmath35 inserting this into the ion balance equation ( [ iondyn ] ) yields a single integro - differential equation for the ion density @xmath36 this equation is linear and homogeneous , and its most natural solution is an exponential . employing the ansatz @xmath37 and defining the effective multiplication factor @xmath38 , we obtain a nonlinearequation for the time constant @xmath39 : @xmath40 figure [ fig3 ] shows that the ion current exhibits an exponential growth before the occurrence of a pronounced electron transport , and a steady state as the anomalous transport occurs .",
    "we examine the case before the occurrence of the anomalous transport , setting the diffusion constant @xmath41 , and the steady state case for the ion density , setting @xmath42 . in the latter case ,",
    "the diffusion term ( or hot electron transport ) is taken into account . setting @xmath43 cm , @xmath44 , @xmath45 ev and @xmath46 v",
    ", we estimate the volume loss constant to be @xmath47 , and the ion time constant to be @xmath48 .",
    "+ during the early phase , when no hot electron diffusion takes place , we indeed obtain a fast exponential growth , with @xmath49 . + during the second phase",
    "we obtain a diffusion loss constant @xmath50 , representing the time scale for locally generated hot electrons to diffuse out of the closed magnetic field region , which corresponds the time scale of the `` jet '' reported by ni et al . @xcite .",
    "the calculated density of hot electrons is @xmath51 , and the average energy of hot electrons calculated as @xmath52 results @xmath53 ev .",
    "therefore , in order to estimate the hot electrons pressure , it is necessary to estimate the ion density .",
    "we set @xmath54 @xmath3 , @xmath55 a , and we assume that half of the discharge current is driven through the spoke . given the two - species nature of the sheath in this late phase , the bohm velocity is defined by employing the average energy of the hot electrons . under these assumptions , the ion density results @xmath56 m@xmath57 , which is a reasonable value at this gas pressure .",
    "+ finally , the hot electron pressure can be estimated as @xmath58 kpa .",
    "on the other hand , the average magnetic pressure in the ionization region , with @xmath59 mt , results @xmath60 kpa .",
    "+ these rough estimates lead us to the conclusion that in the high emissivity region , where most of the secondary electrons are produced and most of the inelastic collision processes take place , @xmath61 exceeds @xmath62 .",
    "therefore _ locally _ the high hot electron pressure represents a reservoir of free energy , that the magnetic pressure can not balance . if we postulate this free energy to give rise to local electron deconfinement and enhanced cross field diffusion , then the streak camera images reported by ni et al .",
    "@xcite can be explained : hot electrons generated at the target , diffusing across the magnetic field lines and leaving the magnetic confinement region ( still obeying quasineutrality ) excite the atoms and ions on their path causing the observed trail of emission .",
    "we postulate the sharp emission cutoff to be a consequence of gas rarefaction and suppressed secondary electrons production .",
    "localized sputtering processes will yield a large number of target atoms .",
    "these atoms are ionized and accelerated back to the target , sputtering the target material and generating additional secondary electrons .",
    "the transit time over a point on the racetrack of a spoke is about one @xmath63s , as shown in figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "the time needed to an ar or al ion to be accelerated from distance of 1 mm to the target by an electric field of @xmath64 104 v / m @xcite is around 250 ns .",
    "therefore , several sputtering cycles can be expected to take place within a single spoke .",
    "assuming half of the discharge current to be distributed only in the spoke , it is reasonable to expect that abundant sputtering would result in the depletion of ar neutrals in the target vicinity , i.e. ar gas rarefaction by sputtering wind @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the gas rarefaction will locally change the composition of the impinging flux from an ar dominated to an al dominated flux , which in turn will hinder the secondary electron production .",
    "energy conservation principles prevent singly charged al ions from generating secondary electrons : the ionization energy of an al atom ( 5.98 ev ) should be bigger than two times the electron work function of the sputtering target ( 4.16 ev ) , which is not the case @xcite .",
    "this means that only secondary electrons generated during the ar dominated impinging flux at the beginning of the spoke contribute to ionization and excitation of particles in that same spoke .",
    "excitation and resulting emission will diminish once the energetic electrons reach the open magnetic field lines .",
    "transition to the open magnetic field lines and lack of additional energetic electrons due to an al dominated impinging flux results in the sharp edge observed in the emission contour ( figure [ fig2]d ) .",
    "the already mentioned results with the streak camera reported in ref .",
    "@xcite agree well with the postulate that localized gas rarefaction , and inability of singly charged metal ions to generate secondary electrons , result in a sharp emission edge .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows different shapes of the spoke .",
    "we argue that this characteristics can be explained based on the different ionization potentials .",
    "even though singly charged metal ions can not generate secondary electrons , doubly charged ions have sufficiently high ionization energy to generate secondary electrons .",
    "if the doubly charged ionization potential is low enough , then there is a good probability to generate a sufficient amount of doubly charged ions that will contribute in production of secondary electrons .",
    "however , the secondary electron generation would continue during the transit of the ionization region with reduced efficiency : indeed the energy required to produce a double charged ion is the sum of the first and the second ionization potentials , and these double charged ions present a reduced secondary electron yield . for instance , @xmath14 is 0.08 for ti@xmath65 impinging on a ti target , compared to 0.12 for ar@xmath66 . these secondary electrons will excite and ionize the species resulting in a continuous emission ( i.e. without forming a sharp edge ) , but with diminishing intensity due to the already mentioned reduced secondary electron generation efficiency . to address this hypothesis , we measured the plasma emission in a single spoke condition , using a fast iccd camera for 6 elements with different second ionization potentials as shown in figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "the results show that the emission of elements having lower ionization potential then ar has a diffuse shape , while the emission of elements having higher ionization potential then ar have a triangular shape with a sharp edge .",
    "these results agree reasonably with the hypothesis that low second ionization potential would result in a diffusely shaped emission , due to the prolonged secondary electron production .",
    "+ in this contribution we postulate a model to describe the observed light inhomogeneities in the hipims discharge , based on the localization of the discharge current .",
    "this results in a localized secondary electron generation , which in turn leads to an anomalous diffusion across the magnetic field lines .",
    "the anomalous cross field diffusion results from the electron deconfinement due to the pressure of energetic electrons exceeding the magnetic pressure .",
    "the localization of the ion production and the anomalous electron diffusion has been detected using a double flat probe correlated with a light emission signal .",
    "consequences of the current localization are gas rarefaction and anomalous electron diffusion .",
    "these in turn result in a triangular shaped light emission with sharp cut off , for elements with second ionization potential higher than the ar ionization potential ; and in a diffuse shaped light emission , for elements with second ionization potential lower than the ar ionization potential . +",
