    "tunneling in a magnetic field is a matter of investigation for many years .",
    "the magnetic field can influence tunneling across a potential barrier in two different ways .",
    "first , the magnetic field can modify an underbarrier motion related to a classically forbidden region .",
    "studies of this phenomenon are presented in the literature . in refs .  @xcite it was pointed out that an underbarrier fall of the wave function can be less rapid in an inhomogeneous sample .",
    "see also refs .",
    "@xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite a transmission coefficient through a quadratic barrier was found .",
    "a decay of a metastable state was considered in ref .",
    "the certain peculiarities of an underbarrier wave function were discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "second , the magnetic field can influence a state of an electron at a classically allowed region after an exits from under the barrier .",
    "a typical example is the wigner resonance when the electron tunnels into a potential well with a level aligned to its energy @xcite .",
    "see experimental measurements , for instance , in refs .",
    "another example relates to a specific density of states in the classical region after the tunneling barrier .",
    "a state of an electron , influenced by the magnetic field , may fit better that density of states and this results in increase of tunneling rate @xcite .",
    "the goal of the paper is to study tunneling decay rate of a metastable state in a magnetic field ( the electron after tunneling goes to infinity ) .",
    "the question to be answered : can a magnetic field increase the decay rate ? it is clear that the above effect of density of states at the region after the barrier can , in principle , increase the rate . but this effect , related to a prefactor , can not be very large . according to ref .",
    "@xcite , there is approximately @xmath0 enhamcement of the effect",
    ".    it would be much more amazing to increase the main exponential part of the decay rate by the magnetic field .",
    "the references @xcite say that it is impossible . indeed , when an electron enters under the barrier its velocity deviates , due to the cyclotron effect , from a tunneling path with no magnetic field .",
    "this leads to a reduction of the tunneling probability by the magnetic field .",
    "the reduction can be also explained in terms of increasing of the total barrier .",
    "the additional barrier is proportional to a squared velocity of the electron in the magnetic field @xcite .",
    "but there is a situation when the electron tunnels from a quantum wire or another object extended in the direction perpendicular to tunneling . in this case a state prior to tunneling can have a finite velocity perpendicular to the tunneling direction . according to the cyclotron effect ,",
    "this velocity rotates under the barrier and becomes more aligned with the tunneling direction .",
    "this leads to enhancement of the tunneling rate by the magnetic field ( cyclotron enhancement ) .    formally , cyclotron enhancement of tunneling results from a reduction of the main tunneling exponent which reminds one of wentzel , kramers , and brillouin ( wkb ) .",
    "the exponent can be reduced in a few times .",
    "suppose that at zero magnetic field the tunneling rate is proportional to @xmath1 .",
    "the magnetic field can turn it into , say , @xmath2 .",
    "we consider in the paper tunneling from a straight quantum wire , directed in the @xmath3 axis , embedded into a two - dimensional electron system in the @xmath4 plane .",
    "the potential barrier is created by the electric field @xmath5 directed along the @xmath6 axis ( the direction of tunneling ) .",
    "the magnetic field @xmath7 is aligned along @xmath8 . according to electrodynamics , after tunneling a motion of the electron in perpendicular magnetic and electric fields is restricted by a finite interval in the @xmath6 direction @xcite . to get the electron passed to the infinite @xmath6 one should put some potential wall(s ) along the @xmath6 direction restricting the @xmath3 motion .",
    "due to multiple reflections from the restricting wall in the magnetic field the electron goes to the infinite @xmath6 .",
    "we model the walls by the potential proportional to @xmath9 .",
    "the theory presented relates also to tunneling from a flat @xmath10 film with quantized electron motion in the @xmath6 direction . the electron tunnels into a three - dimensional reservoir .",

    "it is sufficient to track @xmath37 along a classical trajectory @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is imaginary time since an underbarrier classical motion is impossible .",

    "a common point of view is that due to intrinsic underbarrier mechanisms a magnetic field always reduces a probability of tunneling decay of a metastable state . in other words",
    ", it never chances to get tunneling rate enhanced by a magnetic field for many orders of magnitude .",
    "this point of view is supported by a general arguments that in the classical electrodynamics a motion ahead is prevented by cyclotron rotation and the same happens in quantum mechanics .",
    "the famous example is landau states .",
    "the increased localization of a wave function in a magnetic field can also be explained by an additional potential , proportional to squared velocity , created by the magnetic field .",
    "any hand waving explanation leads to a conclusion of tunneling reduction .",
    "we propose a mechanism which contrasts to that point of view .",
    "cyclotron enhancement of tunneling is clear for understanding .",
    "it occurs due to a rotation under the barrier of a velocity vector of the electron . under the cyclotron rotation",
    "it becomes more aligned with the tunneling direction , which increases the tunneling rate .",
    "a necessary condition for the phenomenon is a finite velocity ( [ 36e ] ) in the decayed state of the quantum wire .",
    "the velocity should be directed along the vector @xmath168 , which is parallel to the wire . in the case of the opposite direction the magnetic field",
    "reduces the tunneling rate . for cyclotron enhancement of tunneling",
    "it is important that a sample , from where tunneling occurs , should be extended in the direction perpendicular to tunneling .",
    "the effect is absent in tunneling from a small quantum dot .",
    "the scenario of decay of the metastable state in the magnetic field consists of two parts .",
    "first , the electron moves under the barrier rotating its velocity . on this step ,",
    "a role of reflections from the restricting walls is minor .",
    "second , after exit from under the barrier the electron goes to infinity performing multiple reflections from the restricting walls .",
    "the semiclassical approach used is confirmed by two different numerical methods .",
    "a domain of parameters for the phenomenon can be roughly estimated from the condition that the lorentz force , caused by the velocity in the wire , is of the order of the potential force @xmath5 .",
    "the parameter @xmath22 is @xmath169 since we are interested in @xmath170 and the semiclassical parameter @xmath35 is large , the landau splitting @xmath171 is always less then @xmath172 which defines a scale of the energy levels in the quantum wire .    to be specific ,",
