    "the discovery of the narrow @xmath14 particles by babar @xcite and cleo @xcite and soon confirmed by belle @xcite immediately reminded people an effective theory approach proposed by nowak et al . and",
    "others @xcite .",
    "they constructed an effective lagrangian for heavy mesons from the nambu - jona - lasinio type four - fermi interactions and combined it with the chiral multiplets so that the mass of heavy mesons can be related to the higgs scalars of chiral lagrangian , and they found that two spin multiplets , @xmath15 and @xmath5 , are degenerate in the limit in which the chiral symmetry is an exact symmetry of the vacuum and the heavy quark symmetry is exactly realized . from this effective theory ,",
    "they derived the goldberger - treiman relation for the mass gap between chiral partners @xmath16 and @xmath17 instead of the heavy meson mass itself and predicted the mass gap between chiral partners of heavy mesons to be around @xmath18 mev , where @xmath19 is the coupling constant for @xmath20 and @xmath21 is the pion decay constant .",
    "finding that the mass gap between chiral partners @xmath16 and @xmath17 in the case of @xmath1 agrees well with the experiments ( around 350 mev ) , people thought that underling physics may be explained by their @xmath22 effective lagrangian @xcite .",
    "however , when @xmath5 for @xmath0 meson were found by belle and focus , and later reanalyzed by cleo , their explanation needs to be modified even though some people still study in this direction ; in fact , the effective lagrangian approach @xcite predicts about 94 mev smaller mass gap for @xmath0 mesons than that for @xmath1 mesons , while the experimental mass gap for @xmath0 mesons is about @xmath23 mev larger than that for @xmath1 mesons @xcite .",
    "furthermore , what they originally predicted could not be identified as any of heavy meson multiplets for @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 .",
    "in other words , the forumula can be applied equally for any of these heavy meson multiplets .",
    "thus , it is required to find the mass gap formula , if it exists , which agrees well with the experiments and explains the physical ground of its formula .    in this paper ,",
    "using our semirelativistic potential model , we first give our formula for the mass gap between chiral partners @xmath16 and @xmath17 for _ any _ heavy meson , @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 , among which the known mass gaps , i.e. , the ones for @xmath0 and @xmath1 , agree well with the experiments although there is some ambiguities for @xmath0 meson data .",
    "next we show how this mass gap depends on a light quark mass @xmath12 for @xmath24 , and @xmath25 , where we neglect the difference between @xmath26 and @xmath27 quarks .",
    "our formula naturally explain that the mass gap for @xmath0 is larger than that for @xmath1 and predict the mass gaps for @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "mass for the heavy meson @xmath28 with the spin and parity , @xmath29 , is expressed in our formulation as @xcite @xmath30 where the quantum number @xmath31 is related to the total angular momentum @xmath32 and the parity @xmath33 for a heavy meson as @xcite @xmath34 to begin with , we study the heavy meson mass without @xmath9 corrections so that we can see the essence of the mass gap",
    ". states with the same @xmath35 value are degenerate in a pure chiral limit and without confining scalar potential , which is defined as @xmath36 and @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "we consider the scenario that a chiral symmetry breaking and a confinement take place in two steps .",
    "first the degeneracy is broken due to gluon fields when @xmath38 is turned on and confines quarks into heavy mesons but keeping vanishing light quark mass intact .",
    "in fact , in this limit our model gives the mass gap between two spin multiplets @xmath39 mev as follows ; @xmath40 this gap is mainly due to gluon fields which confines quarks into heavy mesons .",
    "it is interesting that obtained values are close to @xmath41 .",
    "next , turning on a light quark mass which explicitly breaks a chiral symmetry , we have @xmath22 flavor breaking pattern of the mass levels , i.e. , mass of @xmath0 becomes different from that of @xmath1 with the same value of @xmath29 .",
    "since we assume @xmath42 , there still remains @xmath43 iso - spin symmetry .",
    "note that even after chiral symmetry is broken , there is still degeneracy between members of a spin multiplet due to the heavy quark symmetry , i.e. , @xmath44 symmetry , with @xmath45 rotational flavor symmetry and @xmath46 rotational spin symmetry . by using the optimal values of parameters in ref .",
    "@xcite , which is listed in table [ parameter ] , degenerate masses without @xmath9 corrections for @xmath47 and @xmath48 mesons are calculated and presented in table [ degmassgap ] . furthermore , by changing @xmath12 from 0 to 0.2 gev , we have calculated the @xmath12 dependence of @xmath49 and have obtained fig .",
    "[ fig - deltam ] , in which @xmath49 is linearly decreasing with @xmath12 . from fig .",
    "[ fig - deltam ] , we find that the mass gap between two spin multiplets for a heavy meson @xmath28 can be written as @xmath50 where the values of @xmath51 , and @xmath52 are estimated by fitting the optimal line with fig .",
    "[ fig - deltam ] .",
    "since both @xmath51 and @xmath52 are very close to 1 , we conclude that the mass gap is essentially given by @xmath53 though the physical ground of this result is out of scope at present , eq .",
    "( [ massgap ] ) is serious , since it is very different from the one of an effective theory approach as mentioned later .",
    "this result is exact when @xmath54 terms are neglected . as we will see later , since @xmath9 corrections are nearly equal to each other for two spin doublets , the above equation ( [ massgap ] ) between two spin multiplets holds approximately even with @xmath9 corrections .         _ mass gap of heavy baryons  _ [ baryon ] when we apply our formula to the heavy - light baryons which include two heavy quarks , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 , mass gaps between two pairs of baryons , like @xmath55 and @xmath56 , will be given by eq .",
    "( [ massgap ] ) in the heavy quark symmetric limit and by eq .",
    "( [ dm ] ) with @xmath9 corrections where we have to replace @xmath13 with @xmath61 . here",
    "the isospin symmetry is respected since in our model @xmath42 .",
    "this speculation is legitimized since @xmath62 pair can be considered to be @xmath63 expression in the color @xmath22 space so that the baryon like @xmath64 can be regarded as a heavy - light meson and our arguments expanded in this paper can be applied @xcite .      00 babar collaboration , b. aubert , .",
