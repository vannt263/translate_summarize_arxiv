    "chemically selective spectroscopies , like extended x - ray absorption fine structure ( exafs ) , have provided evidence that diffraction studies of solid solutions give only an average vision of the microscopic states and that vegard s law is limited.@xcite indeed , a major result concerns the existence of a structural relaxation of the host lattice around the substitutional cation .",
    "this implies the absence of modification of the site occupied by a doping cation , when decreasing its amount in a solid solution .",

    "@xcite a good agreement with the one calculated from the ab initio relaxed structure is obtained , particularly in the edge region : the position , intensity and shape of the strong absorption peak ( peak c ) is well reproduced by the calculation . the small features ( peaks a and b ) exhibited at lower energy are also in good agreement with the experimental ones . in our calculation , the pre - edge features ( visible at 5985 ev on the experimental data ) can not be reproduced , since we only considered the electric dipole contribution to the x - ray absorption cross - section : indeed , as it has been said previously , the cr - site is centrosymmetric in the relaxed structure , which implies that the pre - edge features are due to pure electric quadrupole transitions .",
    "the sensitivity of the xanes calculation to the relaxation is evaluated by computing the xanes spectrum for the non - relaxed supercell , in which one cr atom substitutes an al atom in its exact position .",
    "the result is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : xanes ] : the edge region ( peaks a , b and c ) is clearly not as well reproduced as in the relaxed model , and peak e is not visible at all .",
    "therefore , we can conclude that the structural model obtained from our ab initio relaxation is reliable .",
    "the cr - o distance is larger than the al - o distance in mgal@xmath1o@xmath2 , but is similar to the cr - o distance in mgcr@xmath1o@xmath2 ( table ii ) .",
    "this demonstrates the existence of an important structural relaxation around the substitutional cr@xmath0 ion , which is expected since cr@xmath0 has a larger ionic radius than al@xmath0 ( 0.615    vs 0.535  ).@xcite the size mismatch generates indeed a local strain , which locally expands the host structure . as a result ,",
    "the o atoms relax outward the cr defect .",
    "this radial relaxation is accompanied with a slight angular deviation of the o first neighbors , as compared to the host structure .",
    "the magnitude of the radial relaxation may be quantified by a relaxation parameter @xmath28 , defined by the relation : @xcite @xmath29    we find @xmath28 = 0.83 ( taking the cr - o experimental distance ) , close to the full relaxation limit ( @xmath28 = 1 ) , which is more than in ruby @xmath5-al@xmath1o@xmath6 : cr@xmath0 ( @xmath28 = 0.76).@xcite vegard s law , which corresponds to @xmath28 = 0 , is thus not obeyed at the atomic scale .",
    "the cr - al distance is intermediate between the al - al and cr - cr distances in mgal@xmath1o@xmath2 and mgcr@xmath1o@xmath2 , which accounts for a partial relaxation of the second neighbors , but the third and fourth shells ( o , mg ) do not relax , within the experimental and computational uncertainties .",
    "the chains of al - centred octahedra are radially affected only at a local scale around cr : the al second neighbors relax partially outward cr , with a al1-o bond slightly shortened .",
    "the angular deviations are also moderate ( below 1@xmath27 ) , since the sequence of octahedra is not modified , but these al - centred octahedra are slighlty distorted . indeed ,",
    "these octahedra being edge - shared , the number of degrees of freedom is reduced , and the polyhedra can either distort or tilt a little , one around another . it is interesting to point out that the three chains of octahedra are orientated along the three four - fold axes of the cubic structure , which are highly symmetric directions . on the contrary , an angular relaxation ( 3.5@xmath27 )",
    "is observed for the mg atoms , but with the absence of radial modifications .",
    "this must be connected to the fact that the tetrahedra share a vertex with the cr - centred octahedron , a configuration which allows more flexibility for relative rotation of the polyhedra .",
    "the extension of the relaxation process up to the second shell is not observed in the corundum solid solution , in which it is limited to the first coordination shell.@xcite such a difference between these two solid solutions can be related to the lattice rigidity : the bulk modulus b is smaller in mgal@xmath1o@xmath2 than in @xmath5-al@xmath1o@xmath6 , 200  gpa and 251  gpa , respectively.@xcite this difference directly arises from the peculiarity of the structure of these two crystals : in the spinel structure , one octahedron is edge - shared to 6 al octahedra and corner - shared to 6 mg - centred tetrahedra ( fig .",
    "[ fig : site]b ) . in corundum , each octahedron is face - shared with another , in addition to corner and edge - sharing bonds : this is at the origin of the rigidity of the corundum structure , which is less able to relax around a substitutional impurity such as cr@xmath0 , and relaxation is thus limited to the first neighbors .",
    "this study provides a direct evidence of the structural relaxation during the substitution of cr for al in mgal@xmath1o@xmath2 spinel . the local structure determined by x - ray absorption spectroscopy and",
    "first - principles calculations show similar cr - o distances and local symmetry in dilute and concentrated spinels .",
    "this demonstrates that , at the atomic scale , vegard s law is not obeyed in the mgal@xmath1o@xmath2-mgcr@xmath1o@xmath2 solid solution .",
    "though this result has been obtained in other types of materials ( semi - conductors , mixed salts ) , it is particularly relevant for oxides like spinel and corundum : indeed , the application of vegard s law has long been a structural tool to interpret , within the so - called `` point charge model '' , @xcite the color of minerals containing transition metal ions . in spinel , the full relaxation of the first shell is partially accomodated by strain - induced bond buckling , which was found to be weak in corundum :",
    "important angular tilts of the mg - centred tetrahedra around the cr - centred octahedron have been calculated , while the angles between cr- and al - bearing edge - sharing octahedra are hardly affected .",
    "the improved thermal and mechanical properties of cr - doped spinel may be explained by remanent local strain fields induced by the full relaxation of the structure around chromium , as it has been observed in other solid solutions.@xcite another important consequence of relaxation concerns the origin of the partition of elements between minerals and liquids in geochemical systems.@xcite finally , the data obtained in this study will provide a structural basis for discussing the origin of color in red spinel and its variation at high cr - contents .",
    "indeed , the origin of the color differences between cr - containing minerals ( ruby , emerald , red spinel , alexandrite ) is still actively debated.@xcite    the authors are very grateful to o. proux ( fame beamline ) for help during experiment .",
