    "superconducting qubits  @xcite are promising candidates for quantum information processing and their macroscopic quantum coherence has been experimentally demonstrated .",

    "two - qubit experiments have been performed in superconducting charge  @xcite , flux  @xcite , and phase qubit  @xcite circuits .",
    "one of the basic requirements for scalability to many qubits is to selectively couple any pair of qubits .",
    "however , these experimental circuits  @xcite are difficult to scale up to many qubits , due to the existence of the always - on interaction . theoretical proposals ( e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) have been put forward to selectively couple any pair of qubits through a common data bus ( db ) . some proposals ( e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) only involve virtual excitations of the db modes , while in others ( e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) , the db modes need to be excited . in these proposals ( e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) , the controllable coupling is implemented by the fast change of the external magnetic flux , which is a challenge for current experiments . the switchable coupling between any pair of qubits can also be implemented by adding additional subcircuits ( e.g. , in refs .",
    "these additional elements increase the complexity of the circuits and also might add additional uncontrollable noise .",
    "recently , two theoretical approaches  @xcite using time - dependent electromagnetic fields have been proposed to control the coupling between two qubits .",
    "both proposals require that : ( i ) the detuning between the two qubits is far larger than their coupling constant ; and thus the ratio between the coupling constant and the detuning is negligibly small . in this case",
    ", the two qubits can be considered as two independent subsystems  @xcite .",
    "( ii ) to couple two qubits , the appropriate time - dependent electromagnetic fields ( tdefs ) or variable - frequency electromagnetic fields must be applied to the qubits , to achieve coupling / decoupling .",

    "some are described below .",
    "\\(i ) in the proposal  @xcite , two dressed qubits are formed by the two decoupled qubits and their corresponding tdefs . if the parameters of the applied tdefs are appropriately chosen so that the transition frequencies of the two dressed qubits are the same , then the resonant coupling of the two dressed qubits is realized , and the information between two decoupled qubits can be exchanged with the help of the tdefs .",
    "however , for another proposal  @xcite , one tdef is enough to achieve the goal of exchanging information between two decoupled qubits .",
    "this works because there is a nonlinear coupling  @xcite between the applied tdef and the two decoupled qubits .",
    "if the frequency of the applied tdef is equal to either the detuning ( i.e. , the difference ) or the sum of the frequencies of the two qubits , then these two qubits are coupled to each other and information between these two qubits can be exchanged .",

    "\\(a ) when a tdef is applied to the selected qubit , there are nonlinear coupling terms  @xcite between that qubit , the db and the tdef , but these terms do not appear in the circuit qed proposal  @xcite .",
    "this significant difference provides different coupling mechanisms for these two proposals .",

    "\\(c ) the qubit - db coupling is realized in the proposal  @xcite by applying a tdef so that the frequency of the applied tdef is equal to the detuning or sum of the frequencies of the qubit and the data bus ; but this qubit - db coupling is realized by changing the qubit frequency , so that it becomes equal to the db frequency in the circuit qed .",
    "\\(d ) without an applied tdef used for the  trapped ion \" proposal  @xcite , the qubit and the db are decoupled  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , in the circuit qed ( e.g. , in refs .",
    "@xcite ) , the decoupling is realized by changing the qubit frequency such that the qubit and the db have a very large detuning .    from ( b ) , ( c ) , and ( d ) , it is clear that , in circuit qed , the hilbert spaces of the qubit and the data bus are always changed during the coupling / decoupling stage .",

    "and then the effective coupling constant between the dressed qubit and the lc circuit is about @xmath261 ghz for the coupling constant @xmath243 ghz between the qubit and the lc circuit .",
    "therefore the microwave assisted resonant interaction between the qubit and the lc circuit can be realized in the current experimental setup  @xcite .",

    "in conclusion , using an example of a superconducting flux qubit interacting with an lc circuit  data bus , we study a method to couple and decouple selected qubits with the data bus .",
    "this method can be realized with the assistance of time - dependent electromagnetic fields ( tdefs ) .",
    "if a tdef is applied to a selected qubit , then dressed qubit - tdef states can be formed . by choosing appropriate parameters of the tdef",

    "however , when the tdef is removed , then the qubit and the data bus are decoupled . by using this mechanism ,",
    "many qubits can be selectively coupled to a data bus .",
    "thus , quantum information can be transferred from one qubit to another through the data bus with the assistance of the tdef .",
    "we stress the following : ( i ) all qubits are decoupled from the data bus when their detunings to the data bus are far larger than their coupling constants to the lc circuit ; ( ii ) the qubits can be independently manipulated by the tdefs resonantly addressing them ( for example , if @xmath271 , then the @xmath148th qubit is addressed by its tdef ) ; ( iii ) to couple any one of the qubits to the data bus , an appropriate tdef is needed to be applied such that the dressed qubit can be resonantly coupled to the data bus , and then the information of the qubit can be transferred to the data bus with the help of the tdef .",
    "we emphasize that all superconducting qubits ( charge or flux qubits ) can work at their optimal points during the coupling and decoupling processes with the assistance of the tdef .",
    "although this coupling / decoupling mechanism is mainly focused on superconducting flux qubits , it can also be applied to either charge ( e.g , in refs .",
    "@xcite ) , or phase  @xcite qubits , as well as other solid state systems .",
