    "outflows play a critical role in the formation of isolated low - mass stars throughout the embedded accretion phases of evolution .",

    "in contrast , the role of outflows in the formation of stars @xmath5 8 m@xmath6 remains elusive , because these stars are rare , form in tight clusters along with low- and intermediate - mass stars that may be in different stages of evolution , lie in heavily obscured regions often at distances greater than several kiloparsecs , and may be evolving on dynamical time scales less than a few thousand years ( e.g. , zinnecker & yorke 2007 ) . large surveys with single - antenna microwave telescopes indicate that energetic molecular outflows are present in massive star - forming regions ( e.g. , zhang et al .",
    "2005 ) , but it is not generally possible to link individual outflows with driving sources , even with the current generation of millimeter - wave interferometers .    the situation is somewhat better in the near - infrared , where the h@xmath0 1 - 0 s(1 ) line at 2.12 @xmath4 is a particularly powerful tracer of shocks in molecular outflows ( davis et al .",

    "in these cases , lower limits to the h@xmath0 2.12-@xmath4/h@xmath0 2.25-@xmath4 flux ratios are calculated using the 3@xmath20 value for that aperture as an upper limit for the h@xmath0 2.25-@xmath4 line flux .",
    "the difference in extinction at 2.12 @xmath4 and 2.25 @xmath4 is very small , only a tenth of a magnitude ( assuming a@xmath21 ) , yielding a corresponding brightness ratio of @xmath71.1 , which has a negligible effect on the flux ratios .",
    "the expected h@xmath0 2.12-@xmath4/2.25-@xmath4 line ratio for uv excitation ( as in pdrs ) is @xmath7 1.9 .",

    "two types of shocks are observed in outflows from star - forming regions .",
    "continuous ( or c - type ) shocks occur when the shock is magnetically cushioned by a relatively high transverse magnetic field , such that the shock thickness is broad and deceleration of gas is relatively gradual , resulting in lower excitation and temperatures than in jump ( or j - type ) shocks . in the latter ,",
    "the gas undergoes a sharp increase in temperature within a narrow zone , where molecules are dissociated ( e.g. , barsony et al .",
    "2010 ; smith 2012 ) .",
    "the observed line ratios for objects listed as mhos are consistent with shock excitation , but not for the pdr and anomaly .",
    "since the high flux ratios for many of the mhos may reflect the fact that 2.25-@xmath4 emission is not detected over the full extent of the apertures used for the 2.12-@xmath4 emission ( see table 1 , columns 5 - 7 ) , we also computed flux ratios using a circular aperture of radius 2 pixels centered on the 2.25-@xmath4 emission peaks ( see table 1 , columns 8 - 10 ) .",
    "a comparison of columns 10 and 7 indicates that although h@xmath0 2.12-@xmath4/2.25-@xmath4 flux ratios are typically lower in the 2-pixel radius apertures , the ratios are still consistent with shock excitation .",

    "table 2 lists the three [ ] emission - line features we detected .",
    "the first two features are associated with mho 864 , and the third feature is associated with , and largely overlaps , mho 867 , the bright bow- or ` bean'-shaped feature that opens toward the _ iras _ source . in mho 864 ,",
    "the two [ ] emission - line features lie along the inferred jet axis of the outflow .",
    "one is located at the apex of the mho and the other is close to core d , which presumably harbors the driving source of the outflow ( see figure 2 and  4.2.4 ) .",
    "in mho 867 , the morphology of the [ ] emission is similar to the mho , but over a smaller region . to investigate excitation conditions in these mhos , we computed line ratios in 2-pixel radius apertures along the major and minor axes of mho 864 , and along and transverse to the bow - shaped structure of mho 867 .",
    "placement of these apertures is indicated in figure 3 and emission line flux ratios are presented in table 3 . for the apertures with h@xmath0 2.25-@xmath4 detections , 2.12 @xmath4/2.25 @xmath4 flux ratios range from 6.8 - 14.5 .",

    "we interpret these results in  4.1 .",
    "the terms `` green fuzzies '' and `` extended green objects '' ( egos ) have been applied to regions of extended 4.5-@xmath4 emission that are often associated with shocked h@xmath0 emission from outflows ( e.g. , cyganowski et al .",
