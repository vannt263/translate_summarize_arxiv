    "the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the pulsar wind nebulae ( pwne ) of the highest spin - down powered pulsars is diverse . in particular , luminous pulsars such as crab ( @xmath1 erg s@xmath2 ) and the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) j0537 - 6910 in n157b ( @xmath3 erg s@xmath2 ) are tev detected , as are others with spin - down power in the order of several 10@xmath4 erg s@xmath2 .",
    "however , several pwne with pulsars similarly luminous , are not .",
    "do they have significantly different interstellar environment , injection , or nebular magnetization ?",
    "the x - ray luminosity efficiency of these high - spin down pulsars also presents a large range .",
    "a notable case is g76.9 + 1.0 for which the x - ray efficiency is @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the distance in units of 10 kpc @xcite .",
    "this and similar cases are challenging for pwne spectral models since they imply an inefficient acceleration of high energy electrons in order to fit the x - ray luminosity .",
    "for these cases , @xcite suggested that the pulsar wind has a high magnetization factor , arguing that because particle - dominated winds are necessary for efficient conversion of wind to synchrotron power , pwne with high magnetization would lead to dim x - ray pwne .",
    "thus , high-@xmath7 ( high magnetic fraction ) models point to an interesting alternative for the interpretation of pwne , which , despite their high spin - down , lack tev emission and have weak x - ray counterparts .",
    "these pwne would be different to tev detected ones .",
    "except cta 1 , for which the magnetization reaches almost to equipartition , all tev - pwne with characteristic ages of 10 kyr or less can be described with an spectral model with low @xmath7 , and are thus strongly particle dominated @xcite .",
    "an interesting case is that of g292.0 + 0.18 , for which the central powering pulsar , j11245916 , has essentially the same @xmath8 , @xmath9 ( up to three significant decimal places ) than j1930 + 1852 , which powers g54.1 + 0.3 .",
    "the distance for both nebulae is also similar ( @xmath106 kpc ) . whereas the latter is a tev source , and modeled as particle dominated pwn ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) ,",
    "the former is not ( at least at the level in which it has been covered in the galactic plane observations by h.e.s.s .",
    "@xcite . with the same spin - down power and located at a similar galactic distance , it seems that the flux at tev energies depends on other factors such the environment ( the fir density , for instance ) or the nebula magnetization .",
    "is then g292.0 + 0.18 simply like g54.1 + 0.3 but subject to a stronger magnetization ?    @xcite",
    "have also analyzed several pwne which have been undetected at tev .",
    "however , they assumed a fixed low magnetization ( @xmath11 ) compatible with usual particle dominated nebulae that have been detected at tev to describe them . in this work",
    ", we explore the phase space of pwne models also in magnetization , in order to distinguish whether there is preference for the existence of highly magnetized nebulae ( or at least , for nebula with magnetization close to equipartition ) among those not yet seen at tev .",
    "the code we use solves the time - dependent diffusion - loss equation for the electrons in the pwn , and includes the energy losses due to synchrotron , ic , adiabatic and bremsstrahlung processes , and escape due to bohm diffusion ( see @xcite for details )",
    ". we shall refer with @xmath12 to the injection function , generally assumed as a broken power law with @xmath13 being the energy of the break ( in lorentz factor units ) and @xmath14 and @xmath15 , the low and high energy indices respectively .",
    "the normalization of the injection is computed using the spin - down luminosity of the pulsar @xmath16 and the magnetic fraction @xmath7 @xmath17 the evolution of the magnetic field is described by ( e.g. , @xcite ) @xmath18^{1/2}.\\ ] ] the spin - down power evolution is deduced assuming that the pulsar has the same behavior as a spinning magnetic dipole with braking index @xmath19 .",
    "we refer with @xmath20 to the initial spin - down age , and with @xmath21 to the characteristic age of the pulsar .",
    "the maximum energy of the particles is calculated by the requirement that their larmor radius is smaller than the termination shock radius .",
    "the radius of the nebula is computed assuming free expansion of the shell in the interior of the supernova remnant ( snr ) .",
    "if we consider that the spin - down luminosity of the pulsar is constant , it evolves as @xcite @xmath22 with @xmath23 we shall refer to this radius as @xmath24 .",
    "this value is obtained by assuming that all the mechanical energy of the explosion with energy @xmath25 is transformed into kinetic energy .",
    "@xmath26 is the ejected mass in the explosion .",
    "@xmath27 is the initial spin - down luminosity of the psr . in some of the pwne that we study in this work ,",
    "the spin - down power of the pulsar is very high and its variation in time can not be neglected .",
    "for this reason , we solve numerically the energy balance equation @xmath28 assuming that the pressure @xmath29 of the pwn at the contact discontinuity with the expanding ejecta is given by ( equation a7 in @xcite ) @xmath30 which depends on the density of the snr ejecta @xmath31 .",
    "[ radcomp ] shows the fractional deviation between the radii , i.e. , @xmath32 , using the parameters obtained of table 1 .",
    "we observe that the difference in radius goes from @xmath102% ( for g310.6 - 1.6 ) to @xmath1046% ( for n157b ) , being larger for when the spin - down luminosity is constant .",
    "taking into account that the magnetic field depends on the radius as @xmath33 , this changes the magnetic field of the nebula , and consequently , its synchrotron flux .",
    "another affected parameter in the fits is the ejected mass of the progenitor star , because the velocity of the ejecta behaves with the mass as @xmath34 .",
    "this means that with the numerical solution , the ejected mass needed to reach a given radius @xmath35 has to be smaller , due to the decreasing spin - down power in time .",
    "regarding the ssc radiation , we assume that the synchrotron ball generating the multi - frequency radiation from each of the pwn has the same radius at all energies , and is equal to the radius of the pwn itself .    in order to fit the spectra , we fix from observations as many parameters as possible .",
    "generally , we fix the period ( @xmath8 ) , period derivative ( @xmath36 ) , braking index ( @xmath19 ) , age of the system ( @xmath37 ) , initial spin - down age ( @xmath38 ) , spin - down luminosity ( @xmath16 ) , distance ( @xmath39 ) , radius of the pwn ( @xmath35 ) , minimum energy at injection ( @xmath40 ) , and fir and nir temperatures ( @xmath41 , @xmath42 ) .",
    "the rest of parameters are fitted or derived from the others .",
    "n157b is located in the lmc and it was the first extragalactic pwn detected in gamma rays @xcite .",
    "its pulsar , psr j0537 - 6910 , has a spin - down power of 4.9 @xmath43 10@xmath44 erg s@xmath2 @xcite .",

    "@xcite did infrared observations using the _ spitzer _ telescope but reported no infrared counterpart ( no bright snr ) . studying the gas and dust properties of the vicinity , they deduced that the mass of the progenitor star should not be higher than 25m@xmath45 . in x - rays , n157b was observed with _",

    "@xcite , and @xcite detected the pwn with _",
    "@xcite analyzed the spectrum of n157b and the pulsar psr j0537 - 6910 in x - rays .",
    "the spectrum of the entire remnant is fitted with a dominant non - thermal component ( a power - law with a spectral index of 2.29 and an unabsorbed flux of 1.4 @xmath43 10@xmath46 erg s@xmath2 @xmath47 ) and a thermal component ( a nei model with a temperature of 0.72 kev and an unabsorbed flux of 7 @xmath43 10@xmath48 erg s@xmath2 @xmath47 ) .    in our study , we use the estimated distance of 48 kpc , see @xcite .",
    "there are two gas bubbles in the vicinity of n157b which contribute to the far - infrared ( fir ) photon fields : 30 doradus complex and the ob association lh99 . from the infrared observations done by @xcite , @xcite modelled the infrared emission as a black body with energy density of 8.9 ev @xmath0 and a temperature of 88 k for the lh99 association , and 2.7 ev @xmath0 and 80 k for 30 doradus .",
    "they consider these values as an upper limit since the unprojected distance between these objects is unknown .",
    "figure [ lmcpwn ] ( left panel ) shows the fit we obtain for n157b .",
    "we assume the radius for the pwn given by @xcite , i.e. , 10.6 pc for a distance of 48 kpc .",
    "the pwn shell is not very well defined and some small contribution of the snr could be included . in this first model , we assumed an age of 4600 yr , which is consistent with the sedov age of the snr given by @xcite ( @xmath105 kyr ) and an ejected mass of 20m@xmath49 , corresponding to the lower limit in the ejected mass given by @xcite .",
    "the electron injection has a low ( high ) energy index of 1.5 ( 2.75 ) and the energy break is located at @xmath50 ( @xmath10511 gev ) . from the synchrotron part of the spectrum , we inferred a magnetic field of 13 @xmath51 g and a magnetic fraction of 0.006 . the energy density of the target photon fields , enhanced due to the near presence of lh99 and 30 doradus , results in our fits much below the upper limits given by @xcite , i.e. , 0.7 and 0.3 ev @xmath0 , respectively .    if instead we assume the energy densities given by @xcite , we need to consider a lower age of 2.5 kyr to fit the tev data . considering the lower limit on the ejected mass given by @xcite , then the radius decreases until 3.7 pc .",
    "regarding the synchrotron spectrum , the magnetic field reaches 35@xmath51 g and @xmath7=0.01 .",
    "the intrinsic energy break changes to @xmath52 ( @xmath10102 gev ) and the injection slopes change slightly ( @xmath14=1.5 , @xmath15=2.6 ) . the value obtained for the radius in the latter model is only @xmath1050% higher than the radius observed in x - rays .",
    "this difference is small in comparison with other cases .",
    "for example , for the crab nebula , we see that the radius in the radio band is @xmath102 pc and in x - rays @xmath100.6 pc .",
    "as the shell is not well defined , the radius measured by @xcite could include parts of the remnant , but the relation between the pwn radius in x - rays and the radius in the radio band seems to be more similar to the crab nebula case .",
    "@xcite suggested that n157b pwn could be interacting with the reverse shock of the snr in a very initial phase , explaining its elongated morphology . in any case",
    ", we find that n157b is a luminous particle dominated nebula .",
    "+ n158a , known as the crab twin , is also located in the lmc but has not been detected at tev yet .",
    "this pwn is powered by the pulsar psr b054069 , which has been observed in radio , infrared , optical and x - ray bands .",
    "the period of this pulsar is 50.5 ms @xcite and the period derivative is 4.7 @xmath43 10@xmath53 s s@xmath2 @xcite .",

    "there is no observational measurement of the ejected mass in n158a , and we have left this parameter free in our model .",
    "the resulting ejected mass in our fits is 25m@xmath49 . according to @xcite ,",
    "this mass is at the limit for neutron star creation , which can grow with the quantity of helium in the core of the star and the energy of the supernova explosion . in the infrared",
    ", @xcite did a high - resolution observation of n158a using the european southern observatory new technology telescope ( _ eso - ntt _ ) and concluded that the progenitor of the snr could have belonged to the same generation of young stars in 30 doradus @xcite .",

    "the nir photon field could also be important depending on the density of nearby stars in the n158a field and could enhance the tev yield , at the same time reducing the required fir densities for detection .",
    "we have also investigated highly magnetized models in which the detection of n158a is not possible even with cta , unless the energy density of the fir increases up to @xmath10500 ev @xmath0 ( assuming that there is no nir contribution ) .",

    "but whereas the radio and the infrared data are fitted similarly well to particle dominated models , the predicted x - ray flux of these models is not quite in agreement with data .",

    "we assume those given by galprop , for which the equivalent temperatures and densities of the representing blackbodies are t@xmath80=25 k , @xmath81=0.42 ev @xmath82 , and t@xmath83=2800 k , @xmath84=0.70 ev @xmath82 .",
    "[ g292fig ] shows two models that fit the radio and the x - ray data for this nebula . in both cases",
    "the age of the system is 2500 years , and the ejected mass is 9 m@xmath45 . in model 1",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ g292fig ] ) , we consider a low magnetic fraction model with @xmath7=0.05 , which is 10 times larger than the magnetic fraction obtained in our model for g54.1 + 0.3 in @xcite .",
    "this model predicts that the nebula will be seen by cta , and it would reach h.e.s.s .",
    "sensitivity if the fir energy density reaches 2 ev @xmath0 .",
    "we obtain a magnetic field of 21 @xmath51 g with an injection intrinsic break of @xmath85 ( @xmath1051 gev ) , with a low ( high ) energy index of 1.5 ( 2.55 ) .",
    "these parameters differ from the ones obtained for g54.1 + 0.3 in @xcite ( @xmath86 g , @xmath87 , @xmath14=1.2 , @xmath15=2.8 ) . with this model ,",
    "the difference in the magnetic fraction , the energy densities of the ic target photon fields and the age of the system explain why we observe g54.1 + 0.3 and not g292.0 + 1.8 , even when both are particle dominated .",
    "the radio and x - ray data are also compatible with a high-@xmath7 model for g292.0 + 1.8 ( see fig . [ g292fig ] ) with @xmath88 and a resulting magnetic field of 81 @xmath51 g",
    "( similar to the crab nebula ) .",
    "the injection in this case has an energy break of @xmath89 ( @xmath10130 gev ) and the high energy spectral index changes slightly ( 2.5 ) . in this case",
    ", g292.0 + 1.8 would not be detected even with cta also explaining the difference with g54.1 + 0.3 .",
    "a deep tev observation will distinguish between these two models . according to the first model ( with @xmath90 ) , the tev flux would be only a factor @xmath102 lower than the h.e.s.s .",
    "sensitivity limit in 50 h exposure time .",
    "despite having similar spin - down power , the value of the magnetic field differs from one to another pwn not only because of the value of @xmath7 ( @xmath91 @xmath92 ) differs , but also because their size does ( @xmath93 ) .",
    "models with high values of @xmath7 would explain the low efficiency of some pwne at x - rays and make them undetectable at vhe .",
    "however , we here found that models with high magnetic field and fraction can be constructed only for some of the nebulae that are non - detected at tev , at the price of stretching other parameters .",
    "they seem to work worse than particle dominated models in general , and remain viable only for g76.9 + 1.0 ( for which there are significantly less observational constraints ) and g310.61.6 ( pending the scrutiny of deeper tev observations ) .",
    "these are the specific conclusions :    * we propose a low magnetization model for n157b with an age of 4.6 kyr and a magnetic field of 13 @xmath51 g .",
    "the size of the nebula is compatible with the one given by @xcite , the age with the sedov age of the remnant @xcite and the ejected mass with the lower limit given by @xcite . a high magnetization model ( @xmath94 ) does not agree with the detection of n157b at tev energies , which would imply fir and nir energy densities much higher than the upper limits obtained by @xcite . *",
    "n158a non - detection seems to happen because of its smaller age ( perhaps also because of a lower photon background ? ) rather than by having a large magnetization .",
    "if this is the case , it will certainly be detected with cta and likely also by the current generation of instruments .",
    "indeed , just the cmb inverse compton contribution would produce a cta source . without taking into account a possible significant nir contribution which would ease the required observation time",
    ", we find that if n158a is subject to a fir energy density of 5 ev @xmath0 , it can already lead to a detection by h.e.s.s . in 50 hours",
    "( lower ic target fields leads to larger integration times , but still within plausible limits ) .",
    "the high-@xmath7 model(s ) explored for n158a has been disregarded as unlikely due to inability to produce a good match to the x - ray data . *",
    "g76.9 + 1.0 is subject to a large uncertainty given the lack of sufficient observational constraints ( only x - ray data are available ) .",
    "this leads to the possibility of accommodating both extremes in the phase space of magnetic fraction . in none of the cases ,",
    "a tev detection is expected and it will be difficult to differentiate among models .",
    "the fir and nir target fields necessary to reach the cta sensitivity results in more than a factor 100 ( 1000 ) in comparison with those obtained by galprop for model 1 ( 2 ) . in such cases ,",
    "the inverse compton contribution at x - ray energies would make impossible to fit the spectral slope .",
    "other important parameters as age or the radius of the nebula are not well determined and are needed to make a solid conclusion . *",
    "the low-@xmath7 models for g310.61.6 and g292.0 + 1.8 predict their detection with h.e.s.s . given sufficient integration time .",
    "the cmb inverse compton contribution reaches the sensitivity curve of a 50 hrs observation in the case of g310.61.6 . the magnetic fraction for g292.0 + 1.8 is one order of magnitude higher than the one obtained for g54.1 + 0.3 in @xcite .",
    "this fact and the slight difference in the fir and nir energy densities considered in both cases , could explain the lack of detection of g292.0 + 1.8 at tev .",
    "in both cases , radio and x - ray data are also explained with a high-@xmath7 model with a magnetic field of 306 @xmath51 g for g310.61.6 and 81 @xmath51 g for g292.0 + 1.8 .",
    "however , the high-@xmath7 model for g310.61.6 is not preferred due to its inability to correctly reproduce the spectral break at 6 kev . for g292.0 + 1.8 instead , a high-@xmath7 model remains viable and tev observations would solve the degeneracy .",
