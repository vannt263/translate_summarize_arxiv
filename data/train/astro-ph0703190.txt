    "relativistic jets are associated with galaxies and quasars ( * agn * ) , with black hole binary star systems , and are thought responsible for the gamma - ray bursts ( * grbs * ) . in agn and microquasar jets",
    "proper motions of intensity enhancements indicate motions that are mildly superluminal for the microquasar jets @xmath7 ( mirabel & rodriquez 1999 ) , and range from subluminal ( @xmath8 ) to superluminal ( @xmath9 ) along the m87 jet ( biretta et al .",

    "jets at the larger scales may be kinetically dominated and contain relatively weak magnetic fields , e.g. , equipartition between magnetic and gas pressure or less , but the possibility of much stronger magnetic fields certainly exists closer to the acceleration and collimation region . here general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic ( grmhd ) simulations of jet formation ( e.g. , koide et al .",

    "; hawley & krolik 2006 ; mckinney & gammie 2004 ; mckinney 2006 ; mizuno et al.2006b ) and earlier theoretical work ( e.g. , lovelace 1976 ; blandford 1976 ; blandford & znajek 1977 ; blandford & payne 1982 ) invoke strong magnetic fields .",
    "additionally , vlahakis and konigl have argued that magnetically dominated `` poynting flux '' jets could produce the accelerations observed in agn jets such as that in ngc6251 and 3c345 ( vlahakis & konigl 2004 ) or provide the impetus for high lorentz factor gamma - ray bursts outflows ( vlahakis & konigl 2003 ) . in these cases acceleration occurs up to the point at which poynting fluxes and kinetic energy fluxes become comparable . in addition to strong magnetic fields , a number of grmhd simulation studies of jet formation indicate that highly collimated high speed jets driven by the magnetic fields threading the ergosphere may themselves reside within a broader wind or sheath outflow driven by the magnetic fields anchored in the accretion disk ( e.g. , mckinney 2006 ; hawley & krolik 2006 ; mizuno et al .",
    "this configuration might additionally be surrounded by a less collimated accretion disk wind from the hot corona ( e.g. , nishikawa et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "recent observations of high speed winds in several qso s with speeds , @xmath15 , also indicate that a highly relativistic jet could reside in a high speed wind or sheath , at least close to the central engine ( chartas et al .",
    "2002 , 2003 ; pounds et al .  2003a , 2003b ; reeves et al .",
    "for some time other observational evidence such as _ limb brightening _ has been interpreted as evidence for a slower external flow surrounding a faster jet spine , e.g. , mkn501 ( giroletti et al .",
    "2004 ) , m87 ( perlman et al . 2001 ) , and a few other radio galaxy jets ( e.g. , swain et al .  1998 ;",
    "giovannini et al .",
    "additional circumstantial evidence such as the requirement for large lorentz factors suggested by the tev bl lacs when contrasted with much slower observed motions has been used to suggest the presence of a spine - sheath morphology ( ghisellini et al .",
    "siemignowska et al .",
    "( 2006 ) have proposed a two component ( spine - sheath ) model to explain the broad - band emission from the pks 1127 - 145 jet .",
    "additionally , a spine - sheath jet structure has been proposed based on theoretical arguments ( e.g. , sol et al .  1989 ; henri & pelletier 1991 ; laing 1996 ; meier 2003 ) and similar type structure has been investigated in the context of grb jets ( e.g. , rossi et al .",
    "2002 ; lazzatti & begelman 2005 ; zhang et al .  2003 , 2004 ;",
    "morsony et al .  2006 ) .",
    "in most jet generation numerical and theoretical work it has been necessary to assume an axisymmetric configuration .",
    "given the helicity in the real system , e.g. , helical magnetic field or outwards flow combined with rotation , there exists a potential problem with the stability of the system .",
    "obviously , at least for most agn jets , stability problems are surmounted and a highly collimated relatively stable flow is produced . in this paper",
    "we begin a 3d numerical study of the stability properties of highly relativistic jet flows allowing for the effects of strong magnetic fields and relativistic flow in a sheath around the highly relativistic jet .",
    "we note that observed relatively stable jet flow along with observed jet structures might then be used to constrain the configuration in the acceleration and collimation region where magnetic field strengths are high .    in the past , 3d numerical simulations of relativistic unmagnetized jets along with accompanying theoretical work ( e.g. , hardee et al .",
    "2001 ; agudo et al .  2001 ; hardee & hughes 2003 ) has provided relatively unambiguous interpretation and understanding of structures observed in the numerical simulations .",
    "thus , we begin our study by adopting a simple system , no radial dependence of quantities inside the jet and also no radial dependence of quantities outside the jet .",
    "this `` top hat '' configuration can be described exactly by the linearized rmhd equations . in general , the system consisting of a jet with `` top hat '' profile and magnetic field parallel to the flow along with a uniform external medium also with magnetic field parallel to the flow is more stable than a system with magnetic and flow helicity .",
    "such a system is stable to current driven ( * cd * ) modes of instability ( istomin & pariev 1994 , 1996 ; lyubarskii 1999 ) but can be unstable to kelvin - helmholtz ( * kh * ) modes of instability ( hardee 2004 ) .",
    "this approach allows us to look at the potential kh modes without complications arising from coexisting cd modes ( see baty et al .",
    "2004 )    this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we describe the numerical simulation setup and present the results of the three - dimensional rmhd simulations of spine - sheath relativistic jets . in section 3 , we present the theoretical dispersion relation that arises from a normal mode analysis of the linearized rmhd equations , present relevant analytical approximate solutions , numerically solve the dispersion relation for the simulation parameters and compare to the simulation results . in section 4",
    "we conclude .",
    "in order to study the long - term stability of magnetized sheath - spine relativistic jets , we use the 3-dimensional grmhd code `` raishin '' with cartesian coordinates in special relativity .",
    "the method is based on a 3 + 1 formalism of the general relativistic conservation laws of particle number and energy momentum , maxwell equations , and ohm s law with no electrical resistance ( ideal mhd condition ) in a curved spacetime ( mizuno et al .",
    "the raishin code performs special relativistic calculations in minkowski spacetime by changing the metric .    in the raishin code , a conservative , high - resolution shock - capturing scheme is employed .",
    "the numerical fluxes are calculated using the harten , lax , & van leer ( hll ) approximate riemann solver scheme .",
    "the flux - interpolated , constrained transport scheme is used to maintain a divergence - free magnetic field .",
    "the raishin code has proven to be accurate to second order and has passed a number of numerical tests including highly relativistic cases , and highly magnetized cases in both special and general relativity ( mizuno et al .",
    "2006a ) .    in the simulations",
    "a `` preexisting '' jet flow is established across the computational domain .",
    "this setup represents the case in which the jet is in equilibrium with an external medium far behind the leading edge mach disk and bow shock .",
    "we allow the jet flow to be surrounded by a lower - density external magnetized wind medium .",
    "for all simulations , the ratio of densities is @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the mass density in the proper frame .",
    "the jet flow has @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the initial magnetic field is assumed to be uniform and parallel to the jet flow .",
    "the jet is established in static total pressure balance with the external magnetized wind medium .",
    "our choice of colder jet in a hotter wind is representative of a jet spine in a hotter sheath or cocoon as might occur as a result of astrophysical jet interaction with the surrounding medium .",
    "however , the specific parameters have been chosen for numerical and theoretical comparison convenience .",
    "the computational domain is @xmath20 with @xmath21 computational zones ( 10 computational zones span @xmath22 ) .",
    "we impose outflow boundary conditions on all surfaces except the inflow plane at @xmath23 .",
    "a precessional perturbation is applied at the inflow by imposing a transverse component of velocity with @xmath24 .",

    "precession at the jet inflow plane excites the helical kh mode which is advected down the jet and grows .",
    "the isovolume image shows that beyond @xmath50 with no wind jet flow is disrupted , and the magnetic field is strongly bent and distorted .",
    "transverse 2d slices through the jet axis ( panels 1b & 1c ) show a smaller density ( pressure ) fluctuation associated with the leading edge of the helix in the presence of the external wind .",

    "transverse velocities shown by the arrows indicate a circulation around the jet associated with the helical twist that is much more regular in the presence of the external wind .",
    "figure @xmath52 illustrates jet structure for the strongly magnetized cases with no wind and with an external wind . as in figure 1 we show results for the intermediate precession frequency , @xmath28 , ( cases rmhdbn and rmhdbw ) at simulation time @xmath49 . in the no wind case the helical kh mode grows but more slowly than in the weakly magnetized cases shown in figure 1 and does not disrupt the jet inside @xmath53 .",
    "a weakly twisted helical flow and magnetic structure develops .",
    "the transverse slice at @xmath54 ( panel 2c ) indicates weak interaction between the jet and the external medium at this distance .",

    "the helical kh mode is damped and can just barely be seen out to @xmath55 in the transverse axial slice ( panel 2e ) .",
    "the transverse slice at @xmath54 indicates negligible interaction between jet and external medium and no circular circulation ( panel 2f ) .",
    "it is immediately clear from figure 1 that presence of the wind provides a stabilizing influence in the weakly magnetized case .",
    "further comparison with figure 2 shows that the presence of a strong magnetic field provides a stabilizing influence and complete stabilization in the presence of the strongly magnetized wind .    to investigate simulation results quantitatively , we take one - dimensional cuts through the computational box parallel to the z - axis at radial distances @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 on the transverse x - axis . the results for weakly magnetized cases with / without the external wind are shown in figures 3 , 4 , & 5 for precession frequencies , @xmath59 respectively . the results for the strongly magnetized cases are shown in figures 6 & 7 for precession frequencies @xmath60 respectively . in the figures ,",
    "@xmath61 and @xmath62 velocity components correspond to radial @xmath63 and azimuthal @xmath64 velocity components in cylindrical geometry .    in the weakly magnetized cases oscillation from the growing helical kh mode",

    ". jet flow is disrupted at @xmath71 , @xmath72 and possibly for @xmath70 for the low , intermediate and high frequency precession wind cases respectively .",
    "thus , the external wind reduces the growth of kh instability and delays the onset of flow disruption .",
    "the large dips in the axial velocity near the jet surface are caused by sideways motion of the jet surface .",
    "dips in the axial velocity occur more deeply inside the jet surface for lower frequency precession .",
    "the presence of the external wind reduces these effects somewhat .",
    "quantitative simulation results for the strongly magnetized cases with / without the external wind are shown in figures 6 and 7 . in the absence of the external wind ( rmhdbn and rmhdcn ) growing oscillation from helical kh instability is seen .",
    "however , spatial growth is much slower than for the comparable weakly magnetized cases .",
    "comparison with the weakly - magnetized cases ( rhdbn and rhdcn ) , shows that the magnetic field reduces the growth rate of kh instabilities such that any disruption of collimated flow will lie at @xmath73 . in the presence of the external wind ( rmhdbw and rmhdcw )",
    "the initial oscillation is damped .",
    "damping is more rapid for the intermediate frequency perturbation than for the high frequency perturbation .",
    "plots of radial and transverse velocities , and the radial magnetic field component shown in one - dimensional cuts in figures 6 and 7 show that the dominant wavelengths of oscillation are @xmath74 for the intermediate and high frequency perturbations , respectively with or without the external wind .",
    "there is a possible beat pattern in the azimuthal velocity component with @xmath75 for @xmath76 in the no wind high frequency case .",
    "the presence of the wind results in more readily seen beat patterns accompanying the damped oscillations .",
    "the beat pattern is best seen in the radial magnetic field amplitude ( fig .",
    "6f and fig .",
    "at the intermediate perturbation frequency the beat wavelength is @xmath77 . in the high - frequency case a clear beat pattern with @xmath78",
    "is seen at @xmath79 but disappears at larger @xmath80 .    in the next section",
    "we will compare these simulation results with theoretical predictions for growth and damping of the helical wave mode excited by the inlet perturbations in our numerical simulations .",
    "stability of a jet spine - sheath or jet - wind configuration , where the sheath or wind is much broader than the spine or jet , can be accomplished by modeling the jet / spine as a cylinder of radius r embedded in an infinite wind / sheath .",
    "formally , the assumption of an infinite sheath means that the analysis could be performed in the reference frame of the sheath and numerical simulations could be performed in the reference frame of the sheath with results transformed to the source / observer reference frame .",
    "however , it is not much more difficult to derive a dispersion relation and obtain analytical expressions in the source / observer frame and analytical solutions to the dispersion relation in the source / observer frame take on simple physically revealing forms ( hardee 2007 ) . additionally , this approach lends itself to modeling the propagation and appearance of jet structures viewed in the source / observer frame , e.g. , helical structures in the 3c120 jet ( hardee et al .",

    "modes is indicated by the solution structure just above precession frequency , @xmath30 , where the real and imaginary parts of the s and b1 mode solutions are comparable .",
    "thus , we expect to see an indication of interaction in the @xmath30 weakly magnetized simulation between the s and b1 modes with a beat wavelength of @xmath176 .",
    "this agrees with the observed @xmath177 in the simulation .",
    "external wind flow in the weakly magnetized case leads to weak damping of the b1 mode and reduces the growth rate and increases the growth length , @xmath178 , of the s mode by about a factor of two at all frequencies .",
    "however , the numerical simulation for the high frequency precession of a weakly magnetized jet ( rhdc ) , see figure 5 , indicates a larger perturbation growth for the wind case than for the no wind case where the dispersion relation solutions indicate faster growth for the no wind case .",
    "the most likely reason for this difference is a non - linear surface and first body mode interaction in the no wind case that is indicated by the observed beat pattern in the no wind high frequency simulation . here",
    "the different radial structure of the fundamental and body mode , see hardee et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , with comparable wavelength could be responsible for destructive interference and the reduced transverse velocity growth seen in the no wind simulation .",
    "the wavelengths and growth / damping lengths normalized to the jet radius for precession frequencies @xmath26 , @xmath28 and @xmath30 are given in table 3 for the strongly magnetized simulation parameters .",
    "weak damping ( @xmath175 ) or weak growth ( @xmath179 ) indicate a damping or growth length longer than the grid length in the numerical simulations .",
    "no entry in the growth / damping length column indicates a purely real solution .",
    "wavelengths observed in the strongly magnetized simulations are also in excellent agreement with the theoretically predicted wavelengths .    when no external wind is present the dispersion relation solutions for the strongly magnetized case show growth of both the s and b1 modes .",
    "the growth rate of the s mode is reduced by about 25% at frequencies @xmath26 and @xmath28 and by over a factor of three at @xmath30 when compared to the weakly magnetized case .",
    "thus , we expect to see the observed increased spatial growth length in the strongly magnetized no wind simulation when compared to the weakly magnetized case .",
    "the b1 mode now grows at frequencies @xmath26 and @xmath28 in addition to growth at frequency @xmath30 .",
    "growth of the b1 mode at @xmath26 is comparable to growth of the s mode but is much less than the s mode at @xmath28 so would not be expected to appear in the simulation .",
    "note that s and b1 mode wavelengths and growth rates at @xmath30 are comparable so we expect an s mode and b1 mode interaction at a beat wavelength @xmath180 .",
    "this agrees with a weak beat pattern in @xmath181 and @xmath182 ( see figure 7 ) at @xmath183 seen in the strongly magnetized no wind @xmath30 simulation .",
    "the strongly magnetized external wind flow leads to a reduced growth rate of the @xmath173 mode by over an order of magnitude at all frequencies .",
    "the damping rate of the @xmath174 mode at frequencies @xmath184 is reduced more than the @xmath173 growth rate by about a factor of two .",
    "note that for the all the other cases the low frequency growth rate of the @xmath173 and damping rate ( not shown ) of the @xmath174 modes are comparable . at the lower frequencies ,",
    "@xmath185 the b1 mode is damped . at frequencies @xmath186 the b1 mode is either purely real or is weakly growing . at the intermediate precession frequency the strongly magnetized wind case numerical simulation showed damping and a beat pattern in @xmath182 ( see figure 6 ) with @xmath187 . the beat pattern can be understood as interaction between the weakly growing @xmath173 and more weakly damped @xmath174 modes with predicted beat wavelength @xmath188 . at the high precession frequency",
    "the strongly magnetized wind case simulation showed slower damping and a beat pattern in @xmath182 ( see figure 7 ) with @xmath78 .",
    "the beat pattern can be understood again as interaction between the weakly growing @xmath173 and now more strongly damped @xmath174 modes with predicted beat wavelength @xmath189 .    at the intermediate and high frequencies the dispersion relation solutions indicate weak growth of the @xmath173 mode but the simulations suggest damping .",
    "however , the radial magnetic field component in figures 6 & 7 show a beat pattern indicating an interaction between the weakly growing and weakly damped s modes .",
    "normally , a high damping rate of the @xmath174 mode would eliminate observable interaction .",
    "we suggest that the observed damping at @xmath28 and the lesser damping at @xmath30 is partially a result of this interaction .",
    "the lesser damping at @xmath30 occurs as interaction is reduced because of the considerably larger damping rate of the @xmath174 mode at the higher frequency .",
    "it is also possible that some of the observed damping is a result of numerical dissipation given the relatively low numerical resolution of the simulations .",
    "we can attempt to quantify the growth or damping of the perturbations seen in the numerical simulations and compare the observed rates relative to theoretical predictions .",
    "our estimates of the growth or damping e - folding length determined from the simulations are given in table 4 .",
    "the estimates are obtained by comparing a perturbation amplitude @xmath190 , in @xmath191 , determined at @xmath192 with a perturbation amplitude @xmath193 determined at @xmath194 .",
    "the e - folding growth or damping length @xmath195 is found from @xmath196 $ ] .",
    "we always choose @xmath197 to minimize inlet effects .",
    "the range in @xmath80 over which a growth or damping length was estimated is included in parentheses following the e - folding length .",
    "an indication of non - linear effects such as an observed beat pattern or amplitude saturation is indicated by an asterisk . in these cases",
    "the values provide no more than qualitative guidelines . the low frequency result for",
    "the no wind case is suspect as a shorter wavelength perturbation dominates growth at @xmath198 and the high frequency cases all involve non - linear mode coupling , indicated by a beat wavelength , or appear amplitude saturated . in general , the estimates vary qualitatively like the theoretical predictions",
    ".    we can perform a more quantitative comparison of the moderate frequency , @xmath199 , results with theoretical growth / damping rate predictions .",
    "the simulation growth lengths are @xmath200 times longer than theoretically predicted growth lengths .",
    "the weak damping observed in the magnetized wind case at @xmath201 when compared to the very weak growth predicted is consistent with this picture .",
    "part of the difference between theory and simulation growth lengths can be the result of development of a shear layer in the simulations where a sharp boundary between spine and sheath is assumed theoretically .",
    "additional differences can be a numerical effect resulting from both the narrow width of the computational domain and the numerical resolution .",
    "the narrow width of the computational domain means that some interaction with the domain boundary is unavoidable .",
    "our relatively low numerical resolution of 20 computational zones across the jet diameter has the effect of increasing the numerical viscosity and resistivity .",
    "we do expect this to affect spatial growth lengths in the manner observed .",
    "we note that resolution studies in 2d rhd simulations performed by perucho et al .",
    "( 2004a , 2004b ) suggest that only extremely high numerical resolution will recover correct quantitative growth or damping lengths .",
    "excellent quantitative agreement between theoretically predicted and our numerically observed wavelengths indicates that we are not experiencing serious resolution or boundary effects .",
    "we have performed numerical simulations of weakly and strongly magnetized relativistic jets embedded in a weakly and strongly magnetized stationary or mildly relativistic ( @xmath202 ) sheath using the raishin code ( mizuno et al .",
    "2006a ) . in the numerical simulations a jet with lorentz factor",
    "@xmath203 was precessed to break the initial equilibrium configuration .",
    "results of the numerical simulations were compared to theoretical predictions from a normal mode analysis of the linearized rmhd equations describing a uniform axially magnetized cylindrical relativistic jet embedded in a uniform axially magnetized moving sheath .    in the fluid limit",
    "the present simulation results confirm earlier results obtained by hardee & hughes ( 2003 ) , who found that the development of sheath flow around a relativistic jet spine explained the partial stabilization of the jets in their numerical simulations . here",
    "we confirm this earlier result and have extended the investigation to the influence of magnetic fields with simulations specifically designed to test for stabilization of the relativistic jet spine by strong magnetic fields and a weakly relativistic wind .",
    "the prediction of increased stability of the weakly - magnetized system with mildly relativistic sheath flow and the stabilization of the strongly - magnetized system with mildly relativistic sheath flow is verified by the numerical simulation results .",
    "the simulation results show that theoretically predicted wavelengths and thus wave speeds are relatively accurate . on the other hand , growth rates and spatial growth lengths derived from the linearized equations",
    "can only be used to provide broad guidelines to the rate at which perturbations grow or damp .",
    "nevertheless , the present results can be extended to other parameter ranges with reduced growth occurring as @xmath204 and stabilization occurring when ( eq .",
    "9 ) @xmath205 in the above expressions @xmath206 represents a `` surface '' alfvn speed ( see eqs . 7 & 8) , @xmath207 and @xmath208 are alfvn and flow lorentz factors , respectively ; @xmath209 , @xmath210 and @xmath211 are the flow , axial magnetic field and enthalpy in the ( j ) jet or ( e ) external sheath .",
    "formally , the present results and expressions apply only to magnetic fields parallel to an axial spine - sheath flow in which conditions within the spine and within the sheath are independent of radius and the sheath extends to infinity . a rapid decline in perturbation amplitudes in the sheath as a function of radius is governed by the hankel function s radial dependence .",
    "this suggests that the present analysis will provide a reasonable approximation to a finite sheath provided the sheath is more than about three times the spine radius in thickness .    in the present regime where flow and magnetic fields are parallel , current driven ( cd ) modes are stable ( isotomin & pariev 1994 , 1996 ) .",
    "however , in the strong magnetic field regime we expect the magnetic fields in realistic jets and sheaths to have a significant toroidal component and an ordered helical structure",
    ". provided radial gradients in magnetic fields and other jet spine / sheath properties are not too large we might expect the present results to remain approximately valid where @xmath209 and @xmath210 refer to the axial or poloidal velocity and field components only .",
    "this conclusion is suggested by theoretical results , albeit non - relativistic and for a two dimensional slab jet , indicating that a critical parameter governing kh stabilization is the difference between the projection of the velocity shear and the alfvn speed on the normal mode wavevector ( hardee et al . 1992 ) . in the work presented here magnetic and flow field",
    "are parallel and project equally on the wavevector which for the helical mode lies at an angle @xmath212 relative to the jet axis .    if flow and magnetic fields are not parallel , the projection of flow velocity and alfvn velocity on the wavevector is different and this will modify the stability condition somewhat .",
    "of course , helical magnetic fields ( appl & camenzind 1992 ) , axially magnetized jet rotation in the subsonic limit ( bodo et al .",
    "1996 ) , and a radially stratified axial velocity profile ( birkinshaw 1991 ) do modify the kh modes .",
    "nevertheless , in the helically twisted magnetic and flow field regime likely to be relevant to most astrophysical jets where cd modes are unstable ( lyubarskii 1999 ) , there can be competition between cd and kh modes .",
    "at least in the force - free magnetic field regime , kh modes can dominate cd modes when both are unstable ( appl 1996 ) .    while the normal fourier modes , such as the helical mode that we have considered in this work , are the same in kh and cd regimes , the conditions for instability , the radial structure , the growth rate and mode motions are different .",
    "non - relativistic simulation work ( e.g. , lery et al .",
    "2000 ; baty & keppens 2003 ; nakamura & meier 2004 ) suggests that cd structure is internal and moves with nearly the jet speed . on the other hand ,",
    "kh structure is surface driven and can move at speeds much less than the jet speed .",
    "these differences may serve to identify the source of helical or other moving structure on relativistic jet flows and allow determination of jet properties near to the central engine required to produce such structure .",
