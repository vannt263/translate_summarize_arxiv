    "<S> we investigate the interplay of the electronic and structural transition in la@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the transport and specific heat measurements exhibit unusual evolutions and signature of a first order phase transition around 265 k. mn k - edge extended @xmath3-ray absorption fine structure results reveal distortion in the mno@xmath4 octahedra even in the cubic phase and a remarkable evolution of the distortion across the phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> these results manifest the importance of fluctuations in mn 3@xmath5 orbital occupancy and disorder in their electronic properties , which may help in understanding the orbital and spin ordering proposed in these systems .    </S>",
    "<S> discovery of colossal magnetoresistance ( cmr ) in manganites have opened up a new field of research in solid state physics due to their interesting fundamental issues and significant technological applications such as high density storage media , field sensors , _ </S>",
    "<S> etc_. these systems exhibit plethora of exotic properties such as charge , orbital and spin ordering , electronic phase separation , _ etc . </S>",
    "<S> _ in addition to the cmr effect . </S>",
    "<S> it is now realized that the intricate competition between the charge , spin , orbital , and lattice degrees of freedom in these mixed valent manganites are important for these exotic properties.@xcite    among all the manganites , la@xmath6sr@xmath7mno@xmath2 ( @xmath8 0.5 ) is studied the most due to its proximity to the cmr effect . with the increase in @xmath3 , </S>",
    "<S> the tolerance factor becomes close to unity and the mn - o - mn angle also becomes close to 180@xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> in this situation , mn @xmath10 orbitals would be almost degenerate@xcite and is ideal to study the electronic charge distribution in mn 3@xmath5 levels across the electronic phase transitions observed in these systems .    in this paper , we report our results on the electronic and structural evolution associated to mno@xmath4 octahedra in la@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath11 as a function of temperature . </S>",
    "<S> this compound exhibits a transition from paramagnetic to c - type antiferromagnetic ( c - afm ) structure around 265 k.@xcite reports on structural transition are controversial suggesting a cubic to tetragonal@xcite or no structural transition@xcite with temperature . </S>",
    "<S> subsequent theoretical studies@xcite predict importance of orbital degeneracy in this system . </S>",
    "<S> the orbital degeneracy of mn 3@xmath5 states strongly depends on the local crystal structure of the mno@xmath4 octahedra , which can be probed efficiently by extended @xmath3-ray absorption fine structure ( exafs ) technique . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we have employed mn k - edge exafs around the region of electronic phase transition to investigate the evolution of the local structural parameters of the mno@xmath4 octahedra . </S>",
    "<S> our results reveal that the mno@xmath12 octahedra are distorted even in the cubic phase . </S>",
    "<S> the results at lower temperatures manifest phenomenal evolution of the mn - o bond lengths across the phase transition .    </S>",
    "<S> the sample was prepared by conventional solid state route @xcite and characterized by powder @xmath3-ray diffraction technique . </S>",
    "<S> sample was found to be in single phase with no signature of impurity feature . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis of the diffraction peaks at room temperature indicates cubic structure with space group _ </S>",
    "<S> pm@xmath13m_. iodometric redox titration confirmed the sample to be stoichiometric . </S>",
    "<S> the resistivity and heat capacity measurements were performed using standard four probe method and home made semi adiabatic heat pulse calorimeter , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> mn k - edge exafs studies were carried out at x-18b beamline at the national synchrotron light source , brookhaven national laboratory with an eneregy resolution of 0.8 ev at mn k - edge .    </S>",
    "<S> exafs analysis was carried out using uwxas software@xcite following the standard procedure.@xcite the fourier transform ( ft ) to the @xmath14-space was carried out in the @xmath15-range 3 - 13 @xmath16 by fourier transforming @xmath17 ( @xmath18 is the exafs oscillations ) by a hanning window function . </S>",
    "<S> the back scattering amplitude and phases were calculated using feff6.01a code@xcite for lamno@xmath2 and the same were used for all the temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> the first coordination shell fit was done in the fourier filtered @xmath15-space in the range 0.86 - 1.87  . </S>",
    "<S> the overall many body reduction factor , @xmath19 was fixed to 0.82 . </S>",
    "<S> as seen earlier@xcite , we find that the mn k - edge exafs data at room temperature are best described by 2 short mn - o bond lengths , @xmath20 and 4 long mn - o bond lengths , @xmath21 . in order to avoid uncertainty in the fitting procedure , we have considered average bond distances for eight mn - sr / la bonds and six mn - mn bonds in higher coordination shells ( 0.86 - 3.87  ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the temperature dependent resistivity , @xmath22 and heat capacity , @xmath23 are plotted in fig </S>",
    "<S> . 1 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath22 in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(a ) exhibits insulating temperature dependence along with a sharp increase at about 265 k ( @xmath24 ) and a change of slope at about 254 k. in addition , a distinct hysteresis is observed around @xmath24 and 224 k ( @xmath25 ) for the cooling and warming cycles . </S>",
    "<S> this is demonstrated in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(b ) , where we show the difference in @xmath22 between cooling ( @xmath26 ) and warming ( @xmath27 ) cycles normalized by @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> it is evident that @xmath28 exhibits two peaks of opposite signs at around @xmath24 and @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> the change in sign suggests significant modification in transport mechanisms at different temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> the hysteresis observed in resistivity is an indication of first order phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> notably , the transition from paramagnetic to c - type antiferromagnetic phase@xcite is also observed at @xmath24 .    the heat capacity data shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(c ) exhibit a sharp peak at @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic entropy change at this transition obtained by subtracting the polynomial background is found to be very large , 4.3 j / mol.k . </S>",
    "<S> no distinct feature is observed around @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , at low temperatures , @xmath29 exhibit a linear dependence with @xmath30 as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1(d ) </S>",
    "<S> . considering @xmath31 , the value of @xmath32 is found to be 5.6 mj / mol.k@xmath33 . in metals </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath32 corresponds to the electronic contribution to @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> however , the compound in this study exhibits insulating temperature dependence . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the observation of large @xmath32 indicating finite density of states at the fermi level is unusual and needs further study to understand this effect .    in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2(a ) , we show the temperature evolution of the modulus of ft[k@xmath33@xmath34(k ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> the ft curves are uncorrected for the central and back scattering phase shifts . </S>",
    "<S> the figure shows three prominent peaks around 1.5 , 2.9 and 3.4   marked by a , b and c , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> peaks a and b correspond to mn - o and mn - sr / la shells , respectively , and peak c corresponds to mn - mn and multiple scattering paths ( mn - o - mn ) . while there is no apparent shift in the peak position of the peaks b and c , their relative intensity decreases with the decrease in temperature as shown by plotting the maxima of b and c in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2(b ) . at @xmath35 270 k , </S>",
    "<S> the peak b is weaker than peak c. for 270 k @xmath36 230 k , the intensities are very similar and at @xmath37 230 k , the intensity of peak b increases significantly relative to the intensity of peak c. peak a exhibits a small shift towards the origin and an increasing trend in intensity with the decrease in temperature . since , @xmath18 is a function of bond length , @xmath38 and debye - waller factor , @xmath39 for the @xmath40-th coordination shell , such modification in ft amplitude indicates significant changes in these two parameters with temperatures . in order to obtain the detailed structural information of these modifications , we have carried out the exafs fitting on mn - o , mn - sr / la and mn - mn coordination shells . </S>",
    "<S> representative fit of these shells are shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2(c ) and 2(d ) . </S>",
    "<S> the typical r - factors for the first and higher coordination shell fits are 0.003 and 0.015 , respectively .    </S>",
    "<S> first , we start with the first coordination shell corresponding to mn - o bonds . this shell </S>",
    "<S> is fitted with 2 short bonds , @xmath20 and 4 long bonds , @xmath21 and the results are shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3(a ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is evident from the figure that the distribution in mn - o bonds persists with the decrease in temperature until 270 k. interestingly , around the region of phase transition ( @xmath41 265 k ) , r@xmath42 and r@xmath43 are almost identical indicating an undistorted mno@xmath12 octahedron . at low temperatures , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath20 becomes significantly smaller than @xmath21 thereby mno@xmath12 </S>",
    "<S> octahedra become distorted . </S>",
    "<S> this is remarkable and reveals presumably for the first time such behavior as a function of temperature across a first order phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that tetragonal distortion starts from a perfectly cubic structure , where the mno@xmath4 octahedra are also symmetric . a magnetic phase transition ( from pm to c - afm ) also occurs at @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , in sharp contrast to the common belief , the mn - atoms corresponding to the shorter bond length , @xmath20 becomes ferromagnetically coupled and the ones with the longer bond lengths , @xmath21 are antiferromagnetically coupled .    </S>",
    "<S> when the mno@xmath4 octahedra are symmetric , the @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 orbitals are degenerate forming a @xmath47 band , and @xmath48 and @xmath49 orbitals are degenerate forming an @xmath50 band . in the ionic configuration , mn 3@xmath5 bands in la@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath11 </S>",
    "<S> have 3.2 electrons and the up spin @xmath47 band will be completely filled . </S>",
    "<S> the structural changes in the mno@xmath4 octahedra will lead to a change in the degeneracy of the @xmath47 and @xmath50 bands , and hence significant fluctuation in occupancy of @xmath48 and @xmath49 orbitals . </S>",
    "<S> since , the octahedra are compressed along apical direction ( @xmath20 ; say @xmath51-direction ) , the @xmath5 orbital corresponding to the plane having larger mn - o bond lengths ( @xmath21 ; @xmath48 ) will be more populated compared to the perpendicular one . </S>",
    "<S> this is presumably the reason for the anomalous magnetic coupling observed in this system as filled up spin @xmath48 band favors antiferromagnetic coupling due to superexchange interaction .    in order to explore plethora of unusual effects such as the sharp peak in @xmath23 , a steep increase in resistivity and the nucleation of unusual magnetic coupling at @xmath24 </S>",
    "<S> further , we show the debye - waller factors corresponding to @xmath20 and @xmath21 in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3(d ) and 3(f ) . </S>",
    "<S> the debye - waller factor corresponding to @xmath20 shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3(d ) is significantly large . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests strong influence of disorder in localizing the mn - o hybridized electronic states corresponding to @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> this is presumably the reason for insulating transport despite the fact that ferromagnetic coupling along @xmath20 often favors metallic conduction and finite @xmath32 corresponds to finite density of states at the fermi level .    in figs . </S>",
    "<S> 3(b ) and 3(c ) , we show the mn - sr / la and mn - mn bond lengths , respectively and corresponding debye - waller factors are shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3(e ) and 3(f ) , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> it is evident from the figures that around t@xmath42 , the average mn - sr / la and mn - mn bond lengths remain almost the same .    at 245 k , </S>",
    "<S> mno@xmath12 octahedra are the most distorted ones and the mn - mn distance also becomes minimum . </S>",
    "<S> below this temperature , the distortion in mno@xmath4 octahedra reduces gradually with the decrease in temperature and subsequently , the mn - mn distance also increases gradually . </S>",
    "<S> the debye - waller factor corresponding mn - mn distance does not change significantly ( see fig 3(f ) ) and that corresponding to sr / la atoms around mn shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3(e ) exhibits a gradual decrease with temperature . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that the disorder in sr - sublattice may not have significant role in the electronic properties of this compound .    </S>",
    "<S> around t@xmath42 , the value of resistivity during warming cycle ( @xmath22@xmath52 ) is more than the resistivity during cooling cycle ( @xmath22@xmath53 ) . </S>",
    "<S> below 257 k , the value of @xmath22@xmath53 becomes more than @xmath22@xmath52 and a change in slope is also observed . such unusual modification in transport behavior presumably due to the temperature induced structural evolution of the mno@xmath4 octahedra leading to fluctuation of the occupancy of the mn @xmath50 orbitals in the presence of strong disorder .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have studied the electronic properties of la@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2 using resistivity and heat capacity measurements . </S>",
    "<S> transport and heat capacity data reveal a first order phase transition around 265 k. the local structure was probed by mn k - edge exafs technique . </S>",
    "<S> the mno@xmath4 octahedra are found to be distorted even in the cubic phase at room temperature . </S>",
    "<S> exafs results at different temperatures manifests remarkable evolution of the mno@xmath4 octahedra across the first order phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> we observe that the tetragonal distortion and the antiferromagnetic ordering nucleates from a perfectly cubic structure , where the mno@xmath4 octahedra are symmetric . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the phase transition in this compound involves significant fluctuation in the mn 3@xmath5 orbital occupancy and disorder induced localization , which may be important in understanding interesting orbital and spin ordering observed in manganites .    99    j. m. d. coey , m. viret and s. von moln@xmath54r , adv . phys . * 48 * , 167 ( 1999 ) .    </S>",
