    "neutrino oscillation experiments have firmly established the existence of tiny non - zero masses of active neutrinos and non - trivial mixing in the lepton sector .",
    "neutrinos are massless within the paradigm of standard model ( sm ) .",
    "therefore , the oscillation data can naturally promote the query for physics beyond the sm ( bsm ) .",
    "apart from cp - violating phases most of the oscillation parameters have been determined with great accuracy  @xcite .",
    "thus , it is expected that any bsm theory must provide a suitable mechanism for neutrino mass generation .",
    "to do so , see - saw mechanism seems to be the natural one that predicts the majorana nature of the neutrino signifying lepton number violation . the basic idea behind",
    "the see - saw mechanism is to integrate out the heavy modes , leading to higher - dimensional neutrino mass operators .",
    "depending on the choice of the heavy particles , one can classify variants of this mechanism , namely type - i , -ii , -iii , inverse , double see - saw _ etc .",
    "_ both in supersymmetric ( susy ) and non - susy scenarios .",
    "however , so far there is no such experimental data that can help us to pin down any particular mechanism belonging to any specific model .",
    "thus from neutrino mass generation perspective , these mechanisms are more sacred than particular models .",
    "apart from neutrino masses and mixing the deviation from the galactic rotation curve and bullet clusters provide concrete evidences in favour of dark matter ( dm ) which remains unexplained within the sm framework .",
    "cosmological observations has also measured the relic density of the dm with very high precision  @xcite .",
    "but unfortunately the dm characteristics , e.g. mass , spin , and its nature , i.e. , cold , warm , single or multi component are yet to be determined .",
    "thus there must be a theory beyond the standard model .    keeping these things in mind and also from a theoretical perspective , susy demands special attention as a potential bsm theory .",
    "apart from prescribing a solution for the hierarchy problem which sm suffers from , it can also explain neutrino masses - mixing and provide a suitable dm candidate .",
    "for example , the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) is an excellent dm candidate in the paradigm of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) with @xmath1-parity conservation . on the other hand mssm with @xmath1-parity violation ( rpv )",
    "is an intrinsic susy way to generate neutrino masses and mixing both at the tree level as well as at the one - loop level  @xcite .",
    "however , if @xmath1-parity is broken , the lsp becomes unstable and hence fails to explain the observed relic density of the universe .",
    "but there could be potential dark matter candidates , in the form of a gravitino , axino , axion and kev sterile neutrino  @xcite .    concerning the experimental verification of proposed models , unfortunately",
    ", the early 13 tev run of the lhc has not found any signals in favour of susy  @xcite .",
    "although the non - observation of superpartners does not invalidate the idea of susy , but it certainly questions the ability of mssm to resolve the naturalness problem .",
    "for example , lhc has already ruled out gluinos lighter than 2 tev when the gluino and lsp masses are well separated .",
    "this in turn makes the whole coloured sector heavy due to the logarithmic sensitivity to the ultra - violet ( uv ) scale through renormalisation group evolution equations .",
    "interestingly this correlation is not generic and can be avoided within the models with @xmath1-symmetry and dirac gauginos .",
    "one needs to extend the gauge sector of mssm to @xmath3 representation to construct a dirac gaugino mass .",
    "this requires a singlet @xmath4 , a triplet @xmath5 under @xmath6 and an octet @xmath7 under @xmath8 living in the adjoint representation of the sm gauge group .",
    "these fields couple with bino , wino and gluinos respectively , to generate dirac masses for the gauginos .",
    "the presence of additional adjoint scalars cancel the uv logarithmic divergence , resulting in a finite correction  @xcite only .",
    "hence , the dirac gluino masses can be easily made heavy .",
    "an immediate consequence of having heavy dirac gluinos is the suppression of the cross - section for gluino pair or squark - gluino associated pair productions .",
    "in addition , the pair production of squarks are also suppressed as it requires chirality flipping majorana gaugino masses in the propagator which these frameworks are devoid of .",
    "this invariably weakens  @xcite the stringent upper bound on the first two generation squark masses .",
    "the added feature of @xmath1-symmetry , apart from excluding majorana masses for gauginos , is to prohibit trilinear scalar couplings ( @xmath9-terms ) and the traditional higgsino mass term , i.e. , the @xmath10 term .",
    "the absence of @xmath9-terms result in the suppression of the flavor and cp violating interactions  @xcite .    motivated by these nice features , we propose a susy scenario enveloped by @xmath1-symmetry .",
    "our prime aim in this paper is to generate neutrino masses within the @xmath1-symmetric dirac gaugino framework .",
    "in fact the @xmath1-charges are now identified with the lepton number of the sm fields . in general",
    ", we have the freedom to cast these charges and one can look into other assignments in @xcite .",
    "an artifact of our @xmath1-charge assignment is the presence of a bi - linear `` @xmath1-parity violating '' term in the superpotential which is indeed @xmath1-symmetric .",
    "this is a very striking feature as it allows the sneutrino to acquire vacuum expectation value ( vev ) when @xmath1-symmetry gets broken .",
    "this leads to a mixing between light neutrinos and dirac gauginos which in turn helps to generate light neutrino masses at the tree - level .",
    "this rpv coupling will allow the gravitino to decay to neutrino and photons .",
    "such a gravitino is an excellent decaying dark matter candidate provided its lifetime is greater than the age of the universe .",
    "we categorize our paper as follows . to start with",
    ", we propose the model , and discuss the basic features of this scenario .",
    "we emphasize on the specific choice of @xmath1-charges which lead to the emergence of bi - linear `` rpv '' terms in the superpotential , which are @xmath1-symmetric .",
    "then in the following section , sec .",
    "( [ sec:3 ] ) , we discuss soft susy breaking , @xmath1-symmetry breaking terms , and also the generation of sneutrino vev . in the next section",
    "we explore the neutral fermion mass matrix . there",
    "we show , how successfully the neutrino masses and mixing can be generated in a simplistic scenario .",
    "we discuss the more generic methods in appendix  ( [ appendixa ] ) .",
    "while considering normal as well as inverted hierarchies , we note the constraints on the relevant superpotential parameters .",
    "as it happens , the gravitino is the order parameter of @xmath1-symmetry breaking .",
    "we also explore the possibility of gravitino dark matter in our model satisfying necessary constraints .",
    "altogether , we come up with a conclusion that after successfully defending relevant constraints , our model can describe the neutrino mass and mixing parameters .",
    "we conclude by providing a direction to adjudge this scenario in collider experiments .",
    "our scenario is based on a susy framework with an added global @xmath1-symmetry where the gauginos are dirac type unlike the mssm . enjoying the freedom of @xmath1-charge assignments , we tag the chiral superfields with very specific values as depicted in table  [ table:1 ] .",
    ".the gauge quantum numbers under the sm gauge group @xmath11 as well as the @xmath0 charge assignments of the chiral superfields residing in the model .

    "the lepton number of the superpartners can be non - standard .",
    "the definition of our @xmath1-charge assignment can also be understood as , our choice of @xmath1 equals @xmath12  @xcite where @xmath13 is the traditional @xmath1-charge assignment in mrssm  @xcite   is one for the lepton and quark superfields . ] and @xmath14 stands for the lepton number . as we know ,",
    "an invariant action demands the superpotential to have @xmath1-charge of two units .",
    "hence , the allowed terms in superpotential are : @xmath15 the total superpotential of our scenario is @xmath16 .",
    "the triplet @xmath5 under @xmath6 is parametrised as @xmath17 where @xmath18 , @xmath19 s being the pauli matrices and we also denote the components of the triplet field as @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "@xmath23 are the prototypical mssm fields .",
    "@xmath24 are trilinear / yukawa couplings and @xmath10 , @xmath25 are couplings with mass dimension .",
    "notice that , the lack of a @xmath26 term is a serious problem as the higgsino like chargino masses directly stem from this .",
    "the lep experiment has ruled out charginos below 100 gev .",
    "hence , to generate a @xmath10 term , it is mandatory to include two additional @xmath27-doublet chiral superfields @xmath28 and @xmath29 carrying non - zero @xmath1-charges .",
    "the presence of a @xmath1-charge for these two fields imply that @xmath1-symmetry can not be broken in the visible sector spontaneously otherwise we have to encounter massless @xmath1-axions . as a result , these doublets are known as inert doublets in the literature .",
    "we like to draw attention towards @xmath30 which contains the bi - linear  rpv \" but @xmath1-symmetric terms .",
    "these terms are automatically appearing as a relic of our @xmath1-charge assignment .",
    "it is worthy to mention that in our model , @xmath1-symmetry prohibits baryonic  rpv \" terms in the superpotential and in the process the stringent constraints from proton decay are taken care of . before discussing the neutrino mass generation we would like to first address soft susy breaking and @xmath1-symmetry breaking leading to the generation of sneutrino vev .",
    "we choose to work in a scenario where susy ( global ) breaking is not associated with @xmath1-symmetry breaking .",
    "this can be achieved through both @xmath31-and @xmath32-type spurions .",
    "for example , dirac gaugino masses can be generated with the help of a spurion superfield @xmath33 which appears in the lagrangian as follows  @xcite : @xmath34+h.c.,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 and @xmath36 have @xmath1-charge 1 , i.e. , @xmath37=r[\\lambda_{i\\alpha}^{\\prime}]=1 $ ] and @xmath38=0 $ ] .",

    "the scalar masses are one - loop suppressed as opposed to the gaugino masses . as an outcome",
    ", @xmath31-flatness is a natural direction  @xcite which leads to a vanishingly small tree level quartic for the higgs field .",
    "this is problematic from the perspective of fitting the higgs mass to 125 gev .",
    "thus instead of working in the generalised supersoft supersymmetry framework  @xcite , we recall @xmath32-type breaking  @xcite . in our model , the scalar masses can be generated through a @xmath32-type spurion defined as @xmath43 which allows the following @xmath0 preserving operators  @xcite @xmath44,\\nonumber \\\\ & & \\int d^2\\theta \\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\left(\\widehat s\\widehat t^2+\\widehat s\\widehat o^2+\\widehat s^3\\right)+h.c.,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and can automatically generate the following @xmath0 preserving renormalizable soft susy breaking terms @xmath45.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the soft mass squared terms are proportional to @xmath46 and we also consider same magnitude for the @xmath32- and @xmath31-type vevs . in passing , we would like to note that such a mechanism also generates a scalar singlet tadpole @xmath47 . however , as long as @xmath48 , such a tadpole is not expected to destabilize the hierarchy  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , due to the absence of @xmath1-breaking terms @xmath49 in the scalar sector , sneutrinos can not acquire vev which is a relevant ingredient for neutrino mass generation .",
    "this has been a requirement for us to consider the possibility of @xmath1-symmetry breaking .",
    "it is well established that our universe is associated with a vanishingly small vacuum energy or cosmological constant . to explain this from the perspective of spontaneously broken supergravity theory in the hidden sector , the superpotential needs to acquire a non - zero vev .",

    ", the gravitino would also acquire a mass . here",

    "moreover , in order to fit the neutrino oscillation data one requires unnatural fine - tuning among parameters .",
    "however , in this scenario not only all the neutrinos acquire mass at the tree level but the smallness of the neutrino mass can be entangled to the gravitino mass itself .",
