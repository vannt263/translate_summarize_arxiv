    "it is now established at low redshift that black - hole mass and host spheroidal mass are tightly correlated in both quiescent ( magorrian et al .",
    "1998 ; gebhardt et al .",
    "2000 ; ferrarese & merritt 2000 ) and active galaxies ( mclure & dunlop 2001,2002 ; nelson et al . 2004 ) .",
    "consequently , it is widely accepted that the formation and evolution of supermassive black - holes and their host spheroids must be intimately related .",
    "however , at present we do not have a good understanding of the origins of the black - hole : spheroid connection , or its evolution with redshift .",
    "fundamentally , it is not known whether black - holes formed before , after or co - evally with their host spheroids . from a theoretical perspective ,",
    "most models ( eg . granato et al .",
    "2004 ; hopkins et al . 2005 ; begelman et al . 2005 ) predict that the @xmath8 relation should remain close to the locally observed relation at all epochs .",
    "if true , then the same models predict that the observed ratio between black hole and spheroid mass should evolve with redshift as @xmath9 ( e.g. wyithe & loeb 2003 ; adelberger & steidel 2005 ) .    within this context ,",
    "several recent studies have attempted to explore the redshift evolution of the relationship between black - hole mass , spheroid mass and stellar - velocity dispersion from an observational perspective . using the width of the [ oiii ] emission line as a proxy for stellar - velocity dispersion ,",
    "shields et al .",
    "( 2003 ) found no evidence that high - redshift quasars ( @xmath10 ) deviated from the local @xmath8 relation ( tremaine et al .",
    "2002 ) , although the uncertainties were large .",
    "similarly , adelberger & steidel ( 2005 ) examined the quasar - galaxy cross - correlation function of a sample of 79 @xmath11 quasars , and found them to be consistent with the local black - hole : halo mass correlation of ferrarese ( 2002 ) , although again the uncertainties were large .",
    "in contrast , based on stellar - velocity dispersion measurements for a small sample of seyfert galaxies , true et al .",
    "( 2004 ) concluded that at @xmath12 , black - hole masses are @xmath13 dex larger than observed locally , for a given stellar - velocity dispersion .    in terms of the relationship between black - hole and spheroid mass , peng et al .",
    "( 2005 ) recently concluded that the @xmath14 ratio was a factor of @xmath15 times larger at @xmath6 than the present day , based on a sample of 15 quasars .",
    "furthermore , at the very highest redshifts , there are also indications of evolution in the @xmath16 relation .",
    "the highest redshift quasar currently identified ( @xmath17 ) by the sloan digital sky survey ( sdssj1148 + 5251 ; fan et al .",
    "2003 ) is believed to harbour a central black - hole of mass @xmath18 ( willott , mclure & jarvis 2003 ; barth et al .",
    "however , using co observations , walter et al .",
    "( 2004 ) recently estimated a dynamical mass of only @xmath19 for sdssj1148 + 5251 , clearly inconsistent with the locally observed @xmath16 ratio of @xmath20 ( marconi & hunt 2003 ; hring & rix 2004 ) .",
    "the large uncertainties associated with the results discussed above illustrate that addressing the evolution of the black - hole : spheroid relation from an observational perspective is still a difficult proposition .",
    "the reasons for this are two - fold .",
    "firstly , although in principal it is possible to obtain relatively accurate spheroid mass estimates for quiescent galaxies out to high redshifts , at present no viable technique is available to estimate their central black - hole mass .",
    "secondly , although it is now possible to obtain black - hole mass estimates for broad - line active galactic nuclei ( agn ) out to the highest redshifts using the so - called virial technique ( wandel , peterson & malkan 1999 ; kaspi et al .",
    "2000 ; mclure & jarvis 2002 ; vestergaard 2002 ) , it remains extremely challenging to obtain accurate spheroid mass estimates for statistically significant samples of luminous high - redshift quasars .",
    "in this paper we explore the possibility of exploiting the unification of radio - loud agn to provide spheroidal and black - hole mass estimates for a _ single _ population of massive early - type galaxies in the redshift range @xmath0 . in the standard radio - loud unification scheme ( e.g. barthel 1989 ;",
    "urry & padovani 1995 ) radio - loud quasars and radio galaxies are drawn from the same parent population , with their classification as either quasars or radio galaxies dependent solely on whether our line - of - sight to the central engine intersects the obscuring torus , or not .",
    "consequently , by using a complete sample of low - frequency selected radio - loud agn we can adopt spheroidal mass estimates from the radio - galaxy component ( where the central nucleus is obscured ) and black - hole mass estimates from the quasar component ( where we have a direct line of sight to the central nucleus ) as representative of the whole population .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in section two",
    "we briefly describe the 3crr sample . in sections three and four",
    "we describe how the stellar and black - hole masses were estimated . in section five",
    "we investigate the evolution of the @xmath16 relation within the 3crr sample . in section six the implications for the 3crr @xmath21 relation",
    "are outlined , while in section seven the possible systematic uncertainties influencing the stellar and black - hole mass estimates are reviewed .",
    "our conclusions are discussed in section eight . throughout the paper",
    "we adopt the following cosmology : @xmath22 kms@xmath23mpc@xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 .",
    "the sample utilised in this study is the 3crr sample ( laing , riley & longair 1983 ) which contains the most luminous , low - frequency selected , radio sources in the northern hemisphere .",
    "the 3crr sample is complete to a 178mhz flux limit of 10.9jy over an area of 4.2 steradians , and contains a total of 173 sources within the redshift range @xmath26 . following willott et al .",
    "( 2003 ) we have excluded the nearby starburst m82 ( 3c231 ) , and two flat - spectrum quasars which only feature in the 3crr sample due to doppler boosting ( 3c345 and 3c454.3 ) , leaving a total of 170 sources in the full sample .    the 3crr sample is ideally suited to the purposes of this study because it is both complete , and low - frequency selected .",
    "the low - frequency selection is particularly important because it ensures that the 3crr sample does not suffer from any orientation bias .",
    "indeed , the 3crr quasar sample is known to be consistent with being randomly distributed with respect to our line of sight , with orientation angles restricted to @xmath27 ( willott et al .",
    "in contrast , the quasar components of high - frequency selected radio samples are known to be dominated by flat - spectrum sources which are preferentially aligned close ( @xmath28 ) to the line of sight ( jackson & wall 1999 ) . given the known correlation between orientation and the width of low - ionization broad emission lines in radio - loud agn ( e.g. wills & browne 1986 ; brotherton et al .",
    "1996 ; jarvis & mclure 2005 , in prep ) , it is therefore likely that virial black - hole mass estimates for flat - spectrum quasars are systematic underestimates ( jarvis & mclure 2002 ) .",
    "finally , the extensive optical and near - infrared imaging of the 3crr sample in the literature has demonstrated that the radio - galaxy hosts are consistent with being drawn from the most massive early - types in existence out to @xmath29 ( e.g. mclure et al .",
    "2004 ; bettoni et al . 2003 ; dunlop et al .",
    "2003 ; best , longair & rttgering 1998 ) .",
    "although radio - loud agn of the luminosity of the 3crr sample are extremely rare , it is worth remembering that the likely radio - source lifetime of @xmath30 years is only a small percentage of the hubble time .",
    "furthermore , given that every massive early - type galaxy must presumably pass through an active phase in order to build - up its central supermassive black hole , any information extracted on the evolution of the @xmath14 ratio from the 3crr sample can presumably be applied to the evolutionary history of all massive early types .",
    "it has been known for more than twenty years that powerful radio galaxies display a tight correlation between redshift and apparent @xmath31band magnitude ; the so - called @xmath21 relation or near - infrared hubble diagram ( lilly & longair 1984 ) . in its simplest interpretation",
    "the 3crr @xmath21 relation is fully consistent with the passive evolution of an @xmath32 elliptical galaxy formed in a single burst of star - formation at @xmath33 ( e.g. jarvis et al .",
    "2001 ; willott et al .",
    "2003 ) . alternatively",
    ", the @xmath21 relation is also consistent with the hierarchical merging paradigm , within which the @xmath21 relation is populated at each redshift by early - type galaxies at a specific stage of their evolutionary history ( eg .",
    "best , longair & rttgering 1998 ) . in either case , the stellar populations of the 3crr radio galaxies ( @xmath31band luminosities and colours ) are consistent with a high redshift of formation .    consequently , we have based our stellar mass estimates for the 3crr radio galaxies largely on the @xmath31band photometry compiled by willott et al .",
    "( 2003 ) for their study of the @xmath21 relation ( corrected to a fixed 64 kpc metric aperture and for emission - line contamination ) .",
    "for the purposes of this study we have restricted ourselves to 3crr radio galaxies with @xmath34 .",
    "the reasons for this decision are three - fold .",
    "firstly , the lowest redshift in the quasar component is @xmath35 , so it is only at @xmath36 that a direct comparison between the radio galaxy and quasar components of the 3crr sample can be made .",
    "secondly , by restricting our analysis to @xmath37 , the 3crr radio galaxies all have radio luminosities higher than the fri / frii break ( fanaroff & riley 1974 ) , ensuring that our radio - galaxy sample is comprised entirely of powerful frii sources , the same radio morphology common to the entire 3crr quasar sample .",
    "thirdly , at @xmath37 the radio galaxies all have radio luminosities greater than @xmath38whz@xmath23sr@xmath23 , the radio luminosity above which the 3crr sample is fully consistent with simple orientation - based unification ( willott et al .",
    "2001 )    the full 3crr sample contains 57 radio galaxies in the redshift interval @xmath39 .",
    "however , in this study we restrict our analysis to the complete sub - sample of 43 radio galaxies with @xmath39 and @xmath40 , making it possible to compile a complete set of @xmath31band photometry .",
    "the photometry for the vast majority of the sample ( 39/43 objects ) is drawn from the compilation of willott et al .",
    "in addition we include @xmath41-band photometry for 3c324 , 3c356 ( best , longair & rttgering 1997 ) , 3c225b ( lilly & longair 1984 ) and 3c322 ( targett et al . , in preparation ) .    in the redshift range @xmath42 the stellar masses of the 3crr radio - galaxy hosts have been estimated by simply matching the 64 kpc metric aperture @xmath31band magnitudes with a bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ) stellar population model which undergoes an instantaneous burst of star formation at a formation redshift of @xmath43 . at redshifts of @xmath44 , simply converting the observed @xmath31band magnitudes directly into stellar mass estimates should be relatively robust , given that the underlying old stellar population should dominate rest wavelengths long - ward of @xmath45 m .",
    "moreover , there is now a wide variety of evidence that at @xmath1 the properties of powerful radio - galaxy hosts ( colours , scalelengths , kormendy relation ) are fully consistent with those of passively evolving early - type galaxies ( mclure & dunlop 2000 ; best , longair & rttgering 1998 ; mclure et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "however , at @xmath46 it could be argued that the @xmath31band will be increasingly contaminated by any on - going star - formation . in order to quantify the level of on - going star - formation present in",
    "the 3crr radio - galaxy hosts would require a level of multi - wavelength data which does not presently exist .",
    "however , the necessary multi - wavelength data does exist for the k20 sample ( cimatti et al .",
    "the k20 sample is comprised of @xmath47 galaxies in the chandra deep - field south region with @xmath48 , is @xmath49 spectroscopically complete , and has _",
    "photometry available for each source . based on this multi - wavelength data - set , fontana et al .",
    "( 2004 ) conducted a detailed study of the stellar masses of the k20 galaxies using detailed sed fitting .",
    "furthermore , using the fontana et al .",
    "results , daddi et al .",
    "( 2004 ) provide a fitting formula relating observed @xmath31band magnitude to stellar mass for the k20 galaxies in the redshift range @xmath50 , the most luminous of which are directly comparable to the 3crr radio - galaxy hosts . consequently , for the 3crr radio - galaxy hosts at @xmath51 we have adopted the stellar mass estimates provided by the daddi et al .",
    "( 2004 ) relation derived for the k20 sample .",
    "the stellar mass estimates for the 3crr radio - galaxy hosts are plotted as filled circles in fig 1 .",
    "a simple least - squares fit to the @xmath52 relation produces the result : @xmath53 showing no evidence for evolution out to @xmath6 , with the stellar masses remaining virtually constant at @xmath54 .",
    "this places our stellar mass estimates for the 3crr sample in good agreement with those derived by rocca - volmerange et al .",
    "( 2004 ) using the pegas stellar population models . for completeness",
    "we have also plotted those @xmath55 3crr radio galaxies with @xmath31band photometry available in willott et al .",
    "although they are not included in our analysis , the @xmath55 3crr radio galaxies are clearly consistent with the @xmath52 relation fitted to the higher redshift objects .",
    "finally , it should be noted that we have also chosen to exclude the 20 objects in the 3crr sample which are classified as weak quasars of broad - line radio galaxies by willott et al .",
    "this is simply because the weak quasars are unsuitable for estimating host stellar masses ( significant point - source contamination ) or black - hole mass ( significant host - galaxy contamination ) . within the radio - loud unification scheme",
    ", weak quasars are viewed at an angle to the line - of - sight intermediate to that of quasars or radio galaxies , and their exclusion from our analysis should not therefore introduce any significant biases .",
    "the black - hole mass estimates for the 3crr quasars are based on the so - called virial black - hole mass estimator for broad - line agn ( eg .",
    "wandel , peterson & malkan 1998 ; kaspi et al .",
    "2000 ) . under the assumption that the broad - line emitting gas is in virial motion within the central black - hole s gravitational potential ,",
    "the central black - hole mass can be estimated via : @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the radius of the broad - line region ( blr ) and @xmath58 is the orbital velocity of the line - emitting gas . in practise @xmath57 is estimated via the correlation between optical luminosity and @xmath57 discovered from reverberation mapping of low - redshift agn ( kaspi et al .",
    "2000 ) , and the gas orbital velocity is taken to be the fwhm of either the @xmath59 , mgii or civ emission lines .    using a combination of literature data and new spectroscopic observations from the wht telescope we have compiled line - width measurements and black - hole mass estimates for 38/40 of the broad - line quasars in the 3crr sample .",
    "full details of the data compiled on the 3crr quasars , and the determination of the black - hole mass estimates are provided in the appendix .",
    "the black - hole mass estimates for the 3crr quasars are plotted as open circles in fig 1 .",
    "the best fit to the @xmath60 relation ( solid line ) has the form : @xmath61 which is inconsistent with no evolution at the @xmath62 level .",
    "the dashed line in fig 1 shows the predicted evolution of the quasar black - hole masses under the assumption that the black - hole masses remain a factor of @xmath63 lower than the spheroid masses obtained from the radio - galaxy hosts ( eqn 1 ) .",
    "we have adopted @xmath64 because this is the ratio predicted by the recent studies of the local @xmath14 ratio by marconi & hunt ( 2003 ) and hring & rix ( 2004 ) for a spheroidal mass of @xmath65.the dashed line produces a fit with @xmath66 ( 36 degrees of freedom ) , compared to the best - fit with @xmath67 . for two free parameters this @xmath68 suggests that the redshift dependence of the 3crr @xmath69 ratio is different from no evolution of the redshift zero normalisation at the @xmath70 assume gaussian errors .",
    "it should be noted that significances could be reduced depending on the true form of the error distributions .",
    "] level .",
    "although the 3crr sample is purely radio selected , and therefore does not have a defined optical flux limit , it is subject to an _ effective _ optical flux limit through the correlation between radio and optical luminosity ( e.g. serjeant et al .",
    "consequently , it is of obvious concern that the apparent redshift evolution of the 3crr quasar black - hole masses may simply be the result of malmquist bias .",
    "however , it is relatively straightforward to demonstrate that this is not the case . as a function of redshift",
    "we are interested in calculating the minimum virial black - hole mass that one of the 3crr quasars could have , whilst still producing a radio source more luminous than the 3crr flux limit .",
    "therefore , at each redshift we first calculate the absolute radio luminosity of a source with an apparent flux density equal to the 10.9jy 3crr flux limit ( laing , riley & longair 1983 ) . secondly",
    ", using the optical luminosity - radio luminosity distribution of the 3crr quasars ( fig 2 ) we then determine the minimum allowable optical luminosity .",
    "in fig 2 the adopted limiting optical luminosity as a function of radio luminosity is shown as the solid line .",
    "although this linear relation between optical and radio luminosity provides a good description of the lower envelope of the 3crr quasar optical luminosities , it is nevertheless somewhat arbitrary .",
    "however , it can be seen from fig 2 that moving the adopted limit to significantly higher optical luminosities is clearly ruled out .",
    "furthermore , it should be noted that moving the adopted limit to lower optical luminosities would imply greater sensitivity to lower black - hole masses , making malmquist bias less of a concern . finally , to calculate the minimum virial black - hole mass we assume that the broad emission - line velocity width must be @xmath71 km s@xmath23 , if the source is to be regarded as a broad - line type 1 quasar . as a function of redshift , the resulting minimum allowable black - hole mass , effectively the black - hole mass completeness limit ,",
    "is the upper envelope of the shaded grey region shown in fig 1 .",
    "the results of this calculation immediately demonstrate that the radio flux limit of the 3crr sample does not automatically force the 3crr quasar black - hole masses to increase with redshift . on the contrary , it remains perfectly possible for the 3crr quasars to harbour black - hole masses as small as @xmath72 right out to redshift @xmath6 .",
    "therefore , it seems clear that the redshift evolution of the 3crr quasar black - hole masses is genuine , and not the result of biases inherent to the 3crr radio selection .",
    "in fig 3 we show the evolution of the @xmath73 ratio within the 3crr sample , where each data - point is simply @xmath74 within each redshift bin .",
    "the solid line shows the best - fitting relation , which has the form : @xmath75 with the dark grey shaded region indicating the @xmath76 uncertainty on this fit .",
    "it can be seen from eqn 3 that the slope of the best - fitting relation is formally inconsistent with a non - evolving @xmath69 ratio at the @xmath77 level ( @xmath78 ) . however , it is important to note that the expected @xmath69 ratio for local quiescent galaxies of the same stellar mass as the 3crr hosts is still relatively uncertain . in fig 3",
    "the light grey shaded area shows the @xmath79 dex uncertainty on the redshift zero ratio of @xmath64 predicted by the recent @xmath16 studies of marconi & hunt ( 2003 ) and hring & rix ( 2004 ) .",
    "it can be seen from fig 3 that , although the @xmath69 ratio of the 3crr sample is evolving over the redshift interval @xmath0 , the normalisation remains within the current redshift zero uncertainties until @xmath80 .",
    "consequently , in evaluating the significance of the apparent evolution , it is perhaps better to look for the best non - evolving fit to the data with a normalisation within the redshift zero uncertainties ( light grey shaded area ) . under this constraint ,",
    "the best fit to the data has @xmath81 , just within the redshift zero uncertainties . however , the difference in chi - square between this non - evolving fit and the best fit is @xmath82 , which for two free parameters is significant at the @xmath7 level .",
    "consequently , we conclude that the data presented in fig  3 provide strong evidence that the @xmath69 ratio within the 3crr sample evolves with redshift , changing from @xmath83 at redshift zero to @xmath84 by redshift two .",
    "however , given the relatively large uncertainties on the local normalisation of the @xmath69 ratio , it is also clear that the veracity of the apparent evolution in the @xmath69 ratio of massive early - type galaxies suggested by the 3crr sample will only be thoroughly tested by moving to higher redshifts still .",
    "as discussed previously , the tight @xmath21 relation displayed by the 3crr sample can either be interpreted in terms of passive evolution or , alternatively , as fitting naturally within the hierarchical merging paradigm of galaxy evolution ( best , longair & rttgering 1998 ; mclure & dunlop 2000 ) . in the first interpretation",
    "the 3crr host galaxies have completed their formation at high redshift ( @xmath85 ) , and at all redshifts @xmath86 are expected to be indistinguishable from each other , apart from the passive evolution of their stellar populations . in the second interpretation the 3crr host galaxies have different evolutionary histories , but are seen as powerful radio galaxies and quasars at a point where their host stellar masses are a few times @xmath87 . in this scenario",
    "the 3crr sources at @xmath88 continue to build up stellar mass and are identified with dormant brightest cluster galaxies at redshift zero .",
    "fundamentally both interpretations rely on the host galaxies of the 3crr sources having the same mass ( @xmath89 ) , making them difficult to distinguish via the host - galaxy properties . at @xmath90",
    "the results presented in fig 3 show that the @xmath69 ratio of the 3crr sample is not significantly different from the locally observed value , and consequently the passive evolution interpretation of the @xmath21 relation remains valid for these objects .",
    "indeed , hst imaging studies have found no evidence that the luminosities , morphologies or scalelengths of powerful radio galaxies are evolving out to @xmath91 ( e.g. mclure & dunlop 2000 ; mclure et al .",
    "2004 ) .    however ,",
    "although certainly not conclusive , the results presented in fig 3 suggest that the 3crr host galaxies at @xmath88 are required to grow in mass by a factor of @xmath92 to be fully consistent with the locally observed @xmath69 ratio .",
    "this level of growth would place @xmath93 3crr host - galaxies among the progenitors of local brightest cluster galaxies ( @xmath94 ) , consistent with the best , longair & rttgering ( 1998 ) interpretation of the @xmath21 relation .",
    "indeed , this scenario is further supported by evidence showing that the cluster environments of high - redshift powerful radio galaxies are richer than those of their low - redshift counterparts ( hill & lilly 1991 ; best 2000 ) .",
    "before proceeding to discuss the implications of the suggested evolution in the @xmath14 ratio for massive early - type galaxies , it is worthwhile considering the likely sources of systematic uncertainty .      the reliability of the virial black - hole mass estimator for broad - line agn has been discussed extensively in the literature ( e.g. krolik 2001 ; vestergaard 2002 ) .",
    "perhaps the most salient point arising from these studies is that comparisons with the @xmath8 and @xmath95 relations at low - redshift indicate that the virial mass estimator does not suffer from any systematic biases ( e.g. onken et al .",
    "2004 ; nelson et al . 2004 ; mclure & dunlop 2002 ) .",
    "however , it is worth remembering that while the virial mass estimator appears to be unbiased , it does carry a typical @xmath76 uncertainty of @xmath96 dex , and is therefore not particularly _ accurate _ ( vestergaard 2002 ; mclure & jarvis 2002 ) .",
    "it is therefore of potential concern that more than half of the 3crr black - hole mass estimates shown in fig 1 are based on line - width measurements drawn from the literature ( see appendix ) .",
    "it is possible that this could have an unforeseen effect on the derived black - hole mass estimates .",
    "however , it appears unlikely that this is the source of the observed evolution in the 3crr quasar black - hole masses .",
    "firstly , there is no correlation within the 3crr quasar sample between broad - line velocity width and redshift .",
    "additionally , the scatter apparent in the black - hole mass estimates plotted in fig  1 is entirely consistent with that expected , given the known scatter associated with the virial black - hole mass estimator ( the best - fitting relation shown in fig 1 has a reduced chi - square of @xmath97 for 36 degrees of freedom , assuming a constant @xmath98 dex ) .",
    "the stellar mass estimates derived for the 3crr radio galaxies are in good agreement with the determinations of rocca - volmerange et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and best , longair & rttgering ( 1998 ) .",
    "however , it should be noted that fundamentally they are based solely on @xmath31band photometry .",
    "as previously discussed , at @xmath1 this should not significantly bias the stellar mass estimates because the @xmath31band continues to sample rest - frame wavelengths @xmath99 m , which should be dominated by the underlying old stellar population . at @xmath100",
    "we have chosen to base our estimates on the correlation between @xmath31band magnitude and stellar mass derived via multi - wavelength sed fitting of quiescent @xmath50 field galaxies by daddi et al .",
    "if the radio - galaxy hosts have significantly less on - going starformation than typical field galaxies at these redshifts , then these stellar masses could be underestimates .",
    "indeed , if it is assumed that the radio galaxies in the redshift interval @xmath101 are still passively evolving , the stellar mass estimates adopted here are underestimated by @xmath102 ( e.g. inskip et al .",
    "it is important to note that , in this case , the best - fitting evolution of @xmath14 ratio becomes @xmath103 , and is no longer statistically significant .    in contrast , if the radio - galaxy hosts have significantly more on - going starformation than typical field galaxies at these redshifts , then the stellar masses could be overestimates .",
    "indeed , this is more likely to be the case given the strong evidence in the literature that agn activity and starformation are intimately related at high redshift ( e.g. archibald et al .",
    "2000 ; zirm et al .",
    "however , this possibility is not of great concern to the present study because , if this is the case , then the apparent evolution in the @xmath14 can only become _",
    "stronger_. finally , we note that spitzer irac photometry sampling the rest - frame @xmath31band would be ideal for accurately determining the stellar masses of the 3crr sample . in this context",
    "the results of the current spitzer programme ( pi d. stern ) to study the stellar masses of 70 radio galaxies in the redshift interval @xmath104 , including several 3crr objects , will be of great interest .      under a simple orientation - based unification scheme , the ionizing agn continuum luminosities of the 3crr quasars and radio galaxies should be indistinguishable . traditionally , the [ oiii ] emission line luminosity ( @xmath105 ) has been taken as good tracer of the underlying ionizing continuum in radio - loud agn and , if emitted isotropically , should be indistinguishable between quasars and radio galaxies .",
    "however , studies to directly test the similarity of the [ oiii ] emission of radio galaxies and quasars have failed to reach a consensus , with many finding that the [ oiii ] emission in quasars is more luminous than in their radio - galaxy counterparts .",
    "the question of whether this indicates that the [ oiii ] emission is either non - isotropic ( or partially absorbed in radio galaxies ) , or that the opening angle of the obscuring torus is luminosity dependent , the so - called receding torus model ( eg .",
    "simpson 1998 ) , is still hotly debated and unresolved ( e.g. grimes et al . 2004 ; haas et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "consequently , in this study we have chosen not to make an explicit receding torus correction to the black - hole mass estimates of the 3crr quasars .",
    "however , it should be noted that on average the [ oiii ] luminosities of the 3crr radio galaxies are a factor of @xmath106 lower than their quasar counterparts , in good agreement with the predictions of the receding torus model ( e.g. simpson 2003 ) .",
    "correcting the quasar optical luminosities for this difference would have the effect of lowering their black - hole mass estimates by @xmath107 dex ( see appendix ) .",
    "therefore , although this would have no effect on the significance of the observed evolution in the @xmath14 ratio seen in fig 3 , the five data - points would each be @xmath107 dex lower .",
    "however , it should also be noted that a systematic increase of only 0.1 dex to the 3crr radio galaxy [ oiii ] luminosities is sufficient to make the [ oiii]-@xmath108 distribution of the quasars and radio galaxies indistinguishable at the @xmath109 level ( 2dks test , peacock 1983 ) . a correction to the 3crr quasar optical luminosities of this amount would only change the black - hole mass estimates by @xmath110 dex , with a negligible effect on the observed @xmath14 evolution .",
    "furthermore , recent observations of the 3crr sample ( haas et al 2005 ) suggest that the [ oiii ] emission in quasars is _ not _ isotropic , and that the 3crr sample is fully consistent with orientation - based unification .",
    "the results presented in the last section suggest that the @xmath14 ratio within the 3crr sample is evolving with redshift , increasing by a factor of @xmath111 compared to the local value by a redshift of @xmath6 . however , given that the 3crr sample is comprised of the most luminous radio - loud agn in the universe , is it reasonable to assume that this result is in anyway representative of the dominant , quiescent early - type galaxy population ?",
    "two lines of reasoning would argue that it probably is .",
    "firstly , recent studies of both the radio - galaxy @xmath21 diagram ( e.g. rocca - volmerange et al . 2004 ) and the host galaxies of powerful radio galaxies ( mclure et al .",
    "2004 ; bettoni et al . 2003 ; dunlop et al .",
    "2003 ; mclure & dunlop 2000 ) have demonstrated that 3c - class radio - loud agn are representative of the high - mass end of the early - type galaxy population in terms of mass , colour , half - light radius and fundamental plane location .",
    "secondly , as previously mentioned , estimates of the duty cycle of radio - loud agn are typically in the range @xmath112 yrs , which accounts for a negligible fraction of the evolutionary history of the host galaxies ( @xmath113 yrs )",
    ". therefore , there seems little evidence to suggest that the 3crr sample is anything other than a random sample of the very high - mass end of the early - type mass function over the redshift interval @xmath0 .",
    "consequently , it is interesting to compare how the results presented here compare with those in the existing literature . as discussed in the introduction , from a theoretical perspective the ratio between black - hole and spheroid mass",
    "is expected to evolve as @xmath114 , in excellent agreement with the results of this study .",
    "furthermore , the evolution of the black - hole : spheroid relation suggested by the 3crr sample is also in good agreement with the observational results of shields et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and peng et al .",
    "however , it is worth noting that there are further indications from the recent literature which suggest that the @xmath14 ratio may undergo evolution with redshift .",
    "firstly , from their study of quasar black - hole masses using the sdss first data release , mclure & dunlop ( 2004 ) concluded that virtually all black holes in the local universe with masses @xmath115 were already in place by @xmath6 .",
    "in contrast , recent studies of deep infra - red galaxy surveys suggest that at @xmath6 the mass density comprised of the likely hosts of these black holes ( @xmath116 ) is only @xmath117% of its local value ( e.g. caputi et al .",
    "2005 ; fontana et al .",
    "2004 ; rudnick et al .",
    "qualitatively this would suggest an evolution in the mean @xmath14 ratio of a factor of @xmath92 .",
    "furthermore , studies of quasar host galaxies at @xmath6 also suggest that the @xmath14 ratio may be evolving . the majority of recent studies ( e.g. kukula et al .",
    "2001 ; ridgway et al .",
    "2001 ) suggest that for a given quasar luminosity , the typical host - galaxy luminosity has dropped by a factor of @xmath118 by redshift two .",
    "given that these quasars have similar nuclear luminosities to those studies at low redshift , and no evidence has yet been found for a significant correlation between redshift and quasar broad emission - line widths ( e.g. mclure & dunlop 2004 ; corbett et al .",
    "2004 ) , it is reasonable to assume that these quasars will have similar black - hole masses to their low - redshift counterparts .",
    "consequently , if the host - galaxy luminosities are a reasonable indicator of mass , it is tempting to conclude that the detected drop in host - galaxy luminosity implies an increase in the average @xmath14 ratio of @xmath106 .",
    "however , it should also be noted that this conclusion is highly dependent on the unknown star formation history of the quasar host galaxies , and is as yet based on a very small number of objects .",
    "finally , it is worth returning to the issue of the @xmath14 ratio implied for the highest redshift sdss quasar ; sdss1148 + 5251 ( @xmath17 ) . both willott , mclure & jarvis ( 2003 ) and barth et al .",
    "( 2003 ) estimate the central black - hole mass to be @xmath119 , a value which is consistent with assuming eddington limited accretion . in contrast , the dynamical mass estimate of walter et al .",
    "( 2004 ) is only @xmath120 , implying a @xmath14 ratio of @xmath121 , a factor of @xmath122 higher than observed locally .",
    "this is illustrated in fig 4 , which shows the implied @xmath14 ratio of sdss1148 + 5251 compared to the evolving 3crr @xmath14 relation extrapolated to redshift nine .",
    "although the good agreement between the two is no doubt fortuitous , nevertheless , it is clear that the @xmath14 ratio of sdss1148 + 5251 does not appear to be consistent with the expected local value .",
    "fig 4 also demonstrates that the evolution of the @xmath14 ratio suggested by the 3crr sample , if correct , will result in the @xmath123 @xmath14 ratio being a factor of @xmath124 higher than the local value .",
    "such a significant difference should be detectable directly from the luminosities of the host galaxies of quasars with virial black - hole mass estimates",
    ". the question of whether the host galaxies of @xmath123 quasars suggest any evolution in the @xmath14 ratio will be addressed in a forthcoming paper ( targett et al .",
    ", in prep ) .",
