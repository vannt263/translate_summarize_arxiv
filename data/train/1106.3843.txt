    "recently , special attentions have been paid to zigzag - edge graphene nanoribbons ( zgnrs ) spin - valve devices since zgnrs exhibit fascinating phenomenon due to the size confinement and the edge state.@xmath15 for example , some theoretical studies have predicated that zgnr - based spin - valve devices have a very large tmr.@xmath16    on the other hand , the leads ( electrodes ) for spin - valve devices in the previous works have been supposed to be two - dimensional ( of honeycomb- or square - lattice ) type , but more realistically they should be modeled as three - dimensional semi - infinite slabs .",
    "further , the investigation on the tmr for gnr - magnetic junctions is still lacking so far , especially , the influence of an exchange field on the spin - dependent transport .",
    "another important phenomenon in spintronics is the reverse effect to tmr , i.e. , spin - polarized electrons passing from the left fm layer into the right layer , where the magnetization deviates the left by an angle , may exert a torque to the right fm lead .",

    "the tmr versus bias voltage possesses a pronounced plateau structure for both semiconducting 7-agnr and metallic 8-agnr systems without exchange splitting .",

    "2 , both 7- and 8-agnr systems are almost immune from @xmath148 , which is different from the bulk graphene tunneling junction.@xmath24 this stems from the fact the vhss induced by the edge effect of agnrs are independent on @xmath148 .     with different polarization @xmath148 for spin - up [ ( a ) and ( c ) ] , and spin - down [ ( b ) and ( d ) ] channels .",

    "namely , with increasing @xmath148 , the proportion of spin - up electrons increases and that of spin - down electrons decreases in agnrs .",
    "consequently , it becomes easier for spin - up electrons to tunnel through the barrier , but harder for spin - down ones due to the presence of the inverse spin - direction for spin - down electrons in the tunneling process , thus we conclude that @xmath169 increases while @xmath170 decreases with the increase of @xmath148 .",
    "in addition , it is found that for the small @xmath0 ( below the full spin polarization@xmath171 ) , the conductance value is zero for 7-agnr system , while nonzero constant for 8-agnr system .",
    "this is related to the presence ( absence ) of energy gap in semiconducting 7-agnr ( metallic 8-agnr ) . for a larger @xmath0 ( above the full spin polarization ) , the conductance for either 7- or 8-agnr system displays an oscillation enhancement behavior with shape peaks , which stems from the resonant tunneling through different subbands due to the edge effect.@xmath172     for spin - up [ ( a ) and ( c ) ] , and spin - down [ ( b ) and ( d ) ] channels .",
    "the parameters are the same as those of fig .",

    "it is clearly seen that the current has a step - like structure as a function of bias voltage , which results from the constant dos at the fermi energy and resonance due to vhss . in particular , the dependence of the current on the polarization @xmath148 exhibits different behaviors for the 7-agnr and 8-agnr systems . with increasing @xmath148 , the current increases in the entire bias voltage for the 8-agnr system ,",
    "while for the 7-agnr system , the current rises only in the large bias , and almost remains zero at small bias voltage .",
    "the explanation for this phenomenon is as follows : the dos for the 7-agnr system vanishes near the fermi level , thus the 7-agnr system resembles a insulator - like barrier at the low energy . in this case , the electrons will difficultly tunnel through the 7-agnr system at low bias .     with different polarization @xmath148 for spin - up [ ( a ) and ( c ) ] , and spin - down [ ( b ) and ( d ) ] channels .",

    "the conductance approaches to zero for the 7-agnr system , while a finite constant for 8-agnr system .",
    "an interesting characteristic is that the plateau structure for the 8-agnr system is broader than that for the 7-agnr system since 8-agnr has a larger interval between the fermi energy and the lowest subband [ see fig .",
    "when @xmath0 is applied , the peak splits into two peaks located at the two sides of the original peak for both 7-agnr and 8-agnr systems , and the position of the peaks depends on the magnitude of the exchange splitting .",
    "this behavior is due to the exchange splitting of the edge - induced subbands . from fig . 5 , @xmath176 increases while @xmath177 decreases for both 7- and 8-agnr systems with increasing @xmath148 , which is a typical spin - valve effect .     for ( a ) 7-agnr , ( b ) 8-agnr system with different polarization @xmath148 and splitting @xmath0.,width=226 ]    figure 6 shows the tmr versus the bias voltage @xmath81 for 7- and 8-agnr systems with different polarization @xmath148 and exchange splitting @xmath0 .",
    "firstly , it is noted that the tmr for the 7- and 8-agnr systems has a high value relative to the conventional magnetic junction ; a pronounced plateau for 7- and 8-agnr systems appears at lower bias due to the constant dos near the fermi energy [ see fig . 2 ] .",

    "the amplitude of these peaks can even approach to 1 indicating an perfect spin - valve effect .",
    "a high tmr for the system with an agnr has also been obtained in refs . [",
    "it should be pointed out that the result here is different from that of ref .",
    "[ 23 ] where the tmr for the agnrs systems is very small in the vicinity of the fermi energy .",
    "the plateau structure for 8-agnr system is systematically broader than that corresponding to 7-agnr system , which may be very useful to overcome a well - known shortcoming of mram , which is the large decrease in tmr with applied bias voltage .",
    "interestingly , the increase of @xmath0 suppresses the amplitude of this structure for 7-agnr system .",
    "however , the tmr is enhanced within bias range from -@xmath0 to @xmath0 for 8-agnr system .",
    "this is caused by the exchange splitting influence on the dos as mentioned in fig .",
    "2 . the results are quantitatively different from our previous work for fm / graphene / fm system due to the finite size for agnrs.@xmath179 when the polarization changes to @xmath148=0.3 , as shown by the ( blue ) dotted lines and ( green ) dash - dotted lines in fig .",
    "6 , the tmr for both 7-agnr and 8-agnr systems becomes obviously smaller because the leads become less spin - polarized with decreasing @xmath148.@xmath180 this result is different from ref .",

    "the present result can be easily understood because the spin torque is proportional to @xmath184 , where @xmath185 and @xmath186 are the spin moments of the left and right fms , respectively .",

    "7(b ) and 8(b ) , one can notice the step - like feature in the stt as a function of bias voltage for both 7- and 8-agnr systems , which is reminiscent of the current versus the bias .",
    "the reason is that the in - plane @xmath145 is proportional to the difference of spin - polarized current ( @xmath189,@xmath190 where @xmath191 is the spin - current densities for the angle @xmath32 . in practice , @xmath192 ( not shown here ) for both 7- and 8-agnr systems",

    "another reason for this is that the result is obtained here under the wide bandwidth approximation . from figs .",
    "7(c ) and 8(c ) , it can be found that @xmath145 with the exchange splitting @xmath0 displays a oscillation behavior for the 7-agnr and 8-agnr systems .",
    "this result stems from the fact that the exchange splitting shifts the vhss [ cf .",
    "2(a ) and ( c ) ] , thus leads to the edge - induced subband crossing of the bias windows causing the tunneling resonance .",
    "in conclusion , we have demonstrated the effects of the agnr width , the polarization strength of fm leads with arbitrary polarization directions and the exchange splitting on the spin - resolved transport properties for both semiconducting and metallic agnrs .",
    "in contrast to other related theoretical works , the leads in our system are not supposed to be two - dimensional of honeycomb- or square - lattice type , but is more realistical modeled as three - dimensional semi - infinite fm slabs . by means of keldysh ngf method , it is found that the spin - resolved transport property for the system depends sensitively on both the agnr type and the polarization strength of fm leads . around zero bias the tmr versus bias voltage possesses a pronounced plateau structure for both semiconducting 7-agnr and metallic 8-agnr systems without exchange splitting .",
    "this phenomenon may be very useful to overcome a well - known shortcoming of mram , which is the large decrease in tmr with applied bias voltage .",
    "remarkably , the plateau structure for 8-agnr system is much broader than that for 7-agnr system .",
    "interestingly , the increase of the exchange splitting @xmath0 suppresses the amplitude of this structure for 7-agnr system .",
    "however , the tmr is enhanced at bias that ranged from -@xmath0 to @xmath0 for 8-agnr system",
    ". so it may be useful in the design of spin - valve device and graphene nanoribbons - based spintronic devices by using a metallic agnr .",
    "in addition , the current - induced stt for 7-agnr system is systematically larger that that for 8-agnr system , which may be more favorable to fabricate a current - controlled magnetic memory element by using a semiconducting agnr . as a development of graphene fabrication technology ,",
    "several tens of nanometer wide gnrs can be obtained by patterning graphene into a narrow ribbon , and the large exchange splitting can also be realizable in gnrs , thus the model considered in this paper may have potential application in spintronic devices .",
