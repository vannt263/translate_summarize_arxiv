    "the starting point of this work is the following  contraction theorem \" of l. caffarelli @xcite :    let @xmath2 and @xmath3 denote two borel probability measures on euclidean space @xmath4 , where @xmath5 denotes a quadratic function , i.e. @xmath6 with @xmath7 positive - definite , and @xmath8 is a convex function . then the brenier optimal - transport map @xmath9 pushing forward @xmath10 onto @xmath11 is a contraction : @xmath12    let us recall some of the notions used above .",
    "a borel map @xmath1 is said to push - forward @xmath10 onto @xmath11 , denoted @xmath13 , if @xmath14 for any borel set @xmath7 . among all such maps @xmath1 ,",
    "it is natural to minimize the squared - distance transport cost : @xmath15 - this is precisely the monge ( or monge - kantorovich ) problem for a quadratic cost .",
    "the brenier map @xmath16 pushing forward @xmath10 onto @xmath11 is the @xmath10-a.e .",
    "unique map for which the latter infimum is attained ; it is precisely characterized by the property of being the gradient of a convex function @xmath17 , as first proved by y. brenier @xcite .",
    "it is known that the optimal - transport distance @xmath18 metrizes the wasserstein space @xmath19 of square integrable borel probability measures on @xmath20 equipped with a suitable weak topology .",
    "we refer to @xcite for a comprehensive account on this and related topics .",
    "fix an orthogonal decomposition of @xmath21 into subspaces @xmath22 .",
    "we will say that a function @xmath23 _ satisfies our symmetry assumptions _ if it is invariant under the action of the subgroup @xmath24 of the orthogonal group @xmath25 , or equivalently , if : @xmath26 we will similarly say that a map @xmath27 _ satisfies our symmetry assumptions _ if it commutes with the action of the latter subgroup .",
    "our main result generalizes caffarelli s theorem as follows :    [ thm : main1 ] let @xmath28 and @xmath29 , denote two borel probability measures on euclidean space @xmath4 .",
    "assume that @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) is a convex function of the form : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is a quadratic function as in ( [ eq : quad ] ) , and that @xmath34 is convex and satisfies our symmetry assumptions ( [ eq : symmetry ] ) .",
    "then there exists a map @xmath35 pushing forward @xmath10 onto @xmath11 and satisfying our symmetry assumptions which is a contraction .",
    "the smoothness assumption on @xmath36 above is immaterial , and may be dispensed if @xmath10 is approximated ( say , in total - variation distance ) by measures @xmath37 which satisfy the conditions of theorem [ thm : main1 ] ( see lemma [ lem : approx ] ) . a prototypical example where this applies is for the functions @xmath38 , @xmath39 $ ] .",
    "the same comment applies for @xmath8 , so it is enough to prove the theorem for smooth @xmath40 , and conclude by a compactness argument detailed in section [ sec3 ] .    the general formulation of theorem [ thm : main1 ] interpolates between the following extremal cases :    * @xmath10 is a product measure and @xmath8 is  unconditional \" : @xmath41 * @xmath36 and @xmath8 are both radial : @xmath42 * @xmath36 is quadratic and @xmath8 is an arbitrary convex function",
    ".    we shall be mainly interested in the first case , since the third one follows immediately from caffarelli s result , and the second one may be easily obtained using a one dimensional argument reproducing caffarelli s original proof , as described in section [ sec : revisit ] . however , for some of the applications presented in this work , the case when @xmath43 is the most interesting .",
    "we also remark that caffarelli s theorem has recently been generalized in other directions by valdimarsson @xcite and kolesnikov @xcite .",
    "as opposed to the non - constructive optimal - transport map @xmath0 , our map @xmath1 is obtained as a limit of diffeomorphisms @xmath44 , constructed as a ( reverse ) flow along an advection field generated by an appropriate heat diffusion process .",
    "let @xmath45 denote the following second - order differential operator : @xmath46 and let @xmath47 denote the associated diffusion semi - group , characterized as solving the parabolic equation : @xmath48 the latter is simply the usual heat - equation with an additional first - order drift term , also known as the ( linear ) fokker - planck equation .",
    "its invariant measure is easily checked to be @xmath28 : @xmath49 in particular , @xmath50 becomes a self - adjoint positive semi - definite operator on an appropriate dense subspace of @xmath51 .",
    "since @xmath10 is a log - concave probability measure , it is known that @xmath50 has a non - trivial spectral - gap , from which it follows by the spectral theorem that @xmath52 in a rather strong sense ( see section [ sec3 ] ) . defining : @xmath53 it follows in particular that @xmath54 and @xmath55 , so @xmath56 naturally interpolate between @xmath11 and @xmath10 .",
    "we will show how to construct diffeomorphisms @xmath44 , so that each @xmath57 is a contraction satisfying our symmetry assumptions which pushes forward @xmath58 onto @xmath11 .",
    "theorem [ thm : main1 ] then follows by a compactness argument , ensuring that @xmath59 converge appropriately to our desired map @xmath1 .",
    "our construction is in fact for the inverse - maps @xmath60 , pushing forward @xmath11 onto @xmath58 .",
    "these diffeomorphisms are constructed as a flow along a ( time - dependent ) advection field @xmath61 induced by our diffusion : @xmath62 to choose a consistent @xmath61 , we use the well - known continuity equation ( see e.g. @xcite ) : @xmath63 which allows us to pass from the lagrangian view point ( [ eq : vector - flow ] ) to an eulerian one .",
    "we conclude using ( [ eq : nu - t - def ] ) that : @xmath64 and to make this consistent with ( [ eq : l - def ] ) and ( [ eq : semi - group ] ) , we choose : @xmath65    it remains to show that the maps @xmath66 are expansions , i.e. @xmath67 .",
    "being diffeomorphisms , this is equivalent to requiring that the maps are expansions _ locally _ : @xmath68 differentiating this inequality in @xmath69 and using ( [ eq : vector - flow ] ) , we see that it suffices to show that @xmath70 for all @xmath71 . by ( [ eq : w - t - def ] ) , this is equivalent to showing that : @xmath72      this is formulated in the following result , which we believe is of independent interest :    [ thm : main2 ] under the assumptions of theorem [ thm : main1 ] , @xmath73 preserves the log - concavity of @xmath74 .",
    "in other words , @xmath75 is a convex function for all @xmath71 .",
    "it should be noted that by a result of a. kolesnikov @xcite ( see also @xcite , and compare with @xcite ) , the only smooth linear diffusion processes ( [ eq : semi - group ] ) with generator @xmath76 which preserve the log - concavity of @xmath74 for _ arbitrary _ convex functions @xmath8 , are precisely the ornstein - uhlenbeck processes , given by a constant valued matrix @xmath7 and an affine map @xmath77 ( for our generator ( [ eq : l - def ] ) , this corresponds to quadratic potentials @xmath78 ) . that the ornstein - uhlenbeck processes preserve log - concavity",
    "is well known , and may be easily seen using the mehler formula and the prekop - leindler theorem ( e.g. @xcite ) ; together with our construction above , this already provides an alternative proof of caffarelli s contraction theorem ( with some other map @xmath1 ) . by _ restricting _ to convex functions @xmath8 having certain symmetries , as in theorem [ thm : main2 ] , we are able to show that log - concavity is preserved for generators with _ more general _ potentials @xmath36 .",
    "the proof of theorem [ thm : main2 ] is based on parabolic pde methods and in particular the maximum principle ( see @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "let us give a very heuristic outline of the proof .",
    "after assuming that @xmath8 is smooth enough and strictly convex , and restricting the problem onto a smooth , bounded and strictly convex domain by imposing zero dirichlet boundary conditions , we proceed in the contrapositive .",
    "assume that @xmath79 does not remain strictly convex , and argue that there will be a first time @xmath80 when this fails ; this step is the most delicate in all of the proof and requires very careful justification , a point that has been omitted in many previous works on concavity properties of solutions to parabolic pde .",
    "the strict convexity of the boundary guarantees that the minimum of @xmath81 will be attained in an interior point @xmath82 and some direction @xmath83 .",
    "since this will be a local minimum , this implies on one hand that @xmath84 . on the other hand , using that @xmath85 and @xmath86 at @xmath87 , a calculation shows that : @xmath88 at time @xmath89 , @xmath90 is still assumed to be convex , and our geometric structural and symmetry assumptions on @xmath36 and @xmath8 were precisely designed to guarantee that the latter expression be non - negative .",
    "massaging this argument a little more , we obtain a contradiction , thereby concluding the proof .",
    "we emphasize again that key to our approach is an analysis at the very first time @xmath91 when things may go wrong - a triviality for the usual application of the maximum principle for a ( uniformly continuous ) function on a bounded parabolic domain , but a genuine issue when applied to its second derivatives , which may not be uniformly continuous up to the boundary .",
    "besides the applications provided in his original paper @xcite , caffarelli s contraction theorem has found numerous applications in various fields , serving as a tool to transfer isoperimetric inequalities , obtaining correlation inequalities , and more ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "most of these applications only use the fact that there exists _ some _ contracting map pushing forward one measure onto another , without employing the additional information that this map is the _ brenier _ map , i.e. the gradient of a convex function .",
    "consequently , it is a mere exercise to repeat the corresponding proofs in our more general setting , replacing caffarelli s theorem with theorem [ thm : main1 ] , and thereby extending these applications .",
    "we will not go through all of these in this work , but rather indicate several selected applications pertaining to correlation inequalities , extending in particular some known results regarding the gaussian correlation conjecture ( described in section [ sec : apps ] ) to our setup , following an argument of dario cordero - erausquin @xcite .",
    "we will also briefly indicate how to obtain new isoperimetric inequalities .",
    "after understanding how to extend caffarelli s contraction theorem using our heat - induced flow and proving theorem [ thm : main1 ] , we revisited caffarelli s original argument from @xcite , and observed :    [ thm : main3 ] theorem [ thm : main1 ] is also valid when replacing @xmath1 with the brenier optimal - transport map @xmath0 pushing forward @xmath10 onto @xmath11 .    for the proof of theorem [ thm : main3 ] , which is based on caffarelli s own proof , we require an additional ingredient from @xcite in the form of theorem [ thm : ingred ] , described in section [ sec : revisit ] .",
    "roughly speaking , caffarelli s argument is oblivious to the quadratic part of @xmath36 , and for the non - quadratic part on @xmath92 , reduces under our assumptions the task of showing that @xmath0 is a contraction , to showing that it is a contraction _ with respect to the origin_. it is this latter property which is verified using theorem [ thm : ingred ] .    in section [ sec : comparing ] , we compare between the two maps @xmath1 ( as constructed in subsection  [ ss : construction of t ] ) and @xmath0 .",
    "it is not hard to verify that the path @xmath93 of our interpolating diffeomorphisms does not coincide in general with the path @xmath94 of optimal interpolating maps , where @xmath95 denotes the brenier map pushing forward @xmath11 onto @xmath10 .",
    "indeed , our diffusion process may be seen as the gradient flow for the entropy functional @xmath96 on the wasserstein space @xmath19 equipped with an appropriate riemannian structure ( otto and villani @xcite , see also jordan  kinderlehrer ",
    "otto @xcite ) ; optimal - transport , on the other hand , corresponds to moving along the geodesic between @xmath11 and @xmath10 in @xmath19 , i.e. gradient flow for the distance squared functional @xmath97 .",
    "consequently , we believe that the limiting maps @xmath1 and @xmath0 are in general different , although we have not been able to exclude the possibility that they coincide .",
    "the assumptions of theorem [ thm : main1 ] were precisely designed to ensure that @xmath1 contracts distances , but it is quite surprising that exactly the same assumptions imply ( for seemingly different reasons ! ) the same for @xmath0 .",
    "when comparing these two approaches , it is worth pointing out that our diffusion approach only relies on classical regularity results for linear parabolic pdes , whereas analyzing the optimal - transport map requires caffarelli s deeper regularity results for the fully - nonlinear monge - ampre equation ( see @xcite and the references therein ) ; consequently , the former approach may lend itself to further generalization , in particular to setups where the latter regularity results for the brenier  mccann optimal - transport map are unavailable , or alternatively , known to be false , as in the riemannian - manifold setting ( see @xcite ) .",

    "we provide a complete proof of theorem [ thm : main2 ] . in section [ sec3 ]",

    "<S> a theorem of l. caffarelli implies the existence of a map , pushing forward a source gaussian measure to a target measure which is more log - concave than the source one , which contracts euclidean distance ( in fact , caffarelli showed that the optimal - transport brenier map @xmath0 is a contraction in this case ) . </S>",
    "<S> we generalize this result to more general source and target measures , using a condition on the third derivative of the potential , by providing two different proofs . </S>",
    "<S> the first uses a map @xmath1 , whose inverse is constructed as a flow along an advection field associated to an appropriate heat - diffusion process . the contraction property is then reduced to showing that log - concavity is preserved along the corresponding diffusion semi - group , by using a maximum principle for parabolic pde . in particular , caffarelli s original result immediately follows by using the ornstein - uhlenbeck process and the prkopa  leindler theorem . </S>",
    "<S> the second uses the map @xmath0 by generalizing caffarelli s argument , employing in addition further results of caffarelli . as applications , </S>",
    "<S> we obtain new correlation and isoperimetric inequalities . </S>"
