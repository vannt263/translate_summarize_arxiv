    "the current generation of x - ray satellites , _",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ , has shown that the physics of the intra - cluster medium ( icm ) is complex and needs to be regulated by additional , non - gravitational processes beyond simple gravity and gas dynamics considered in the standard cold dark matter cosmological scenario ( white & rees 1978 ) .",
    "in particular , our understanding of cooling flow systems has radically changed . albeit confirming the existence of short cooling times , high densities and low temperatures in the cluster cores , the arrival of new high - resolution x - ray data has shown the lack of the emission lines expected from gas cooling below 1 - 2 kev and has reduced by about one order of magnitude the new spectroscopically  derived mass deposition rates ( e.g. david et al .",
    "2001 , johnstone et al .",
    "2002 , peterson et al .",
    "2003 and references therein ) .",
    "the most plausible solution to this so - called `` cooling flow problem '' is that some form of additional heating which balances the cooling must be acting in the icm . among the many proposed heating mechanisms , one of the best candidates for supplying the energy is feedback from the active galactic nucleus ( agn ) hosted by the central galaxy of the cluster ( e.g. , rosner & tucker 1989 ;",

    "the possibility of agn heating has recently become the leading idea to solve the cooling flow problem thanks to the discovery of x - ray cavities in the icm on scales often approximately coincident with the lobes of extended radio emission ( e.g. , hydra a : mcnamara et al .",

    "this indicates that the radio lobes fed by agns have displaced the x - ray emitting gas , creating cavities in the icm .",
    "these outbursts can be recurrent , as it has been observed in some cases .",
    "for example , rbs797 shows evidence of a restarted agn activity with precessing jets pointing to a different direction with respect to the one of the outer radio lobes filling the cavities ( gitti et al .",
    "the heating by agn is thought to occur through the dissipation of the cavity enthalpy and through shocks driven by the bubbles inflated by the agn .",
    "systematic studies of a sample of x - ray cavities show that their enthalpies , where the @xmath5 work done by the jet as it inflates the cavity is determined by measuring the cavity size and its surrounding pressure , and the adiabatic index @xmath6 is related to the internal composition of the cavities , still unknown . in the case of a relativistic plasma @xmath6 = 4/3 and @xmath7 . ]",
    "lie between @xmath8 erg and scales in proportion to the cooling x - ray luminosity and the radio power of the host system . in more than a half of the sample the energy input from the central radio source",
    "is currently sufficient to balance cooling ( brzan et al .",
    "2004 , rafferty et al .",
    "the trend between x - ray luminosity and bubble mechanical luminosity , together with the existence of short central cooling time , suggests that the agn is fueled by a cooling flow that is itself regulated by feedback from the agn .",
    "the basic idea of this agn - cooling flow scenario is that a self - regulated equilibrium may be achieved , in which the energy input from the agn balances the radiative losses of the icm over the lifetime of the cluster .",
    "the recent discovery of giant cavities and associated large - scale shocks in three system ( ms0735 + 7241 : mcnamara et al .",
    "2005 , hercules a : nulsen et al .",
    "2005a , hydra a : nulsen et al .",
    "2005b ) has shown that agn outbursts can not only affect the central regions , but also have an impact on cluster - wide scales .",
    "in particular , the supercavities discovered in ms0735 + 7421 have a diameter of about 200 kpc each and a weak cocoon shock surrounding them has been detected .",
    "this large - scale outburst is the most powerful known so far : it releases upward of @xmath9 erg into the icm , heating the gas beyond the cooling region ( mcnamara et al .",
    "2005 ) . in this paper",
    "we want to investigate the significant consequences that this new development has for several fundamental problems in astrophysics .",
    "one important problem addressed by giant cavities is the so - called cluster `` pre - heating '' , which is manifested in the steepening of the observed luminosity vs. temperature relation for clusters with respect to theoretical predictions that include gravity alone ( e.g. , markevitch 1998 ) .",
    "some extra non - gravitational energy is required to explain such a steepening ( e.g. , wu et al . 2000 , voit 2005 ) , and one possibility is that it is supplied by agn outburst .",
    "the additional non - gravitational heating supplied by agn could also induce the suppression of the gas cooling in massive galaxies required to explain the exponential turnover at the bright end of the luminosity function of galaxies ( benson et al .",
    "this would indicate a common solution for the two major heating problems associated with the icm : those of cooling flow and galaxy formation .",
    "some cavities live longer than the time it takes to cross their own diameters , suggesting they are in pressure balance with the surrounding medium .",
    "since the work required to inflate the radio lobes generally exceeds the nonthermal minimum energy of the radio emission ( e.g. , de young 2006 and references therein ) , in the hypothesis that the assumptions adopted into the equipartition calculation are correct , some additional component besides the relativistic plasma may fill the cavity and contribute to support them internally .",
    "we want to investigate what is currently providing the necessary pressure support to sustain the cavities . finally , in a more general view , we want to investigate what is the potential impact that such powerful outbursts have on the global properties of the icm . understanding well the icm physics is essential to use galaxy clusters as high - precision cosmological tools .",
    "we address these problems by studying the x - ray properties of the most energetic outburst known in a galaxy cluster .",
    "ms0735@xmath107421 ( hereafter ms0735 ) is at a redshift of 0.216 . with a hubble constant of @xmath11 , and @xmath12 ,",
    "the luminosity distance is 1069 mpc and the angular scale is 3.5 kpc per arcsec .",
    "ms0735 was observed by _ xmm ",
    "newton _ in april 2005 during revolution 0973 . in this paper",
    "only data from the european photon imaging camera ( epic ) are analyzed and discussed , while those from the reflection grating spectrometer ( rgs ) will be presented in a subsequent paper .",
    "the mos and pn detectors were both operated in full frame mode with the thin filter , for an exposure time of 70.6 ks for mos and 60.7 ks for pn .",
    "we use the sasv6.5.0 processing tasks _ emchain _ and _ epchain _ to generate calibrated event files from raw data . throughout this analysis single pixel events for the pn data ( pattern 0 ) are selected , while for the mos data sets the patterns 0 - 12 are used .",
    "the removal of bright pixels and hot columns is done in a conservative way applying the expression ( flag==0 ) . to reject the soft proton flares we accumulate the light curve in the [ 10 - 12 ] kev band for mos and [ 12 - 14 ] kev band for pn , where the emission is dominated by the particle  induced background , and exclude all the intervals of exposure time having a count rate higher than a certain threshold value ( the chosen threshold values are 0.4 cps for mos and 0.7 cps for pn ) . the remaining exposure times after cleaning are 50.4 ks for mos1 , 49.5 ks for mos2 and 42.0 ks for pn .",
    "starting from the output of the sas detection source task , we make a visual selection on a wide energy band mos & pn image of point sources in the field of view .",
    "events from these regions are excluded directly from each event list .",
    "the source and background events are corrected for vignetting using the weighted method described in arnaud et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , the weight coefficients being tabulated in the event list with the sas task _ evigweight_.",
    "this allows us to use the on - axis response matrices and effective areas .",
    "unless otherwise stated , the reported errors are at 90% confidence level .      the background estimates are obtained using a blank - sky observation consisting of several high - latitude pointings with sources removed ( lumb et al .",
    "the blank - sky background events are selected using the same selection criteria ( such as pattern , flag , etc . ) , intensity filter ( for flare rejection ) and point source removal used for the observation events .",
    "this yields final exposure times for the blank fields of 365 ks for mos1 , 350 ks for mos2 and 294 ks for pn .",
    "since the cosmic ray induced background might change slightly with time , we compute the ratio of the total count rates in the high energy band ( [ 10 - 12 ] kev for mos and [ 12 - 14 ] kev for pn ) . the obtained normalization factors ( 1.266 , 1.303 , 1.283 for mos1 , mos2 and pn , respectively )",
    "are then used to renormalize the blank field data .",
    "the blank - sky background files are recast in order to have the same sky coordinates as ms0735 .    the usual approach to perform the background subtraction is described in full detail in arnaud et al .",
    "this procedure consists of two steps . in a first step , for each product extracted from the observation event list an equivalent product is extracted from the corresponding blank - field file and then subtracted from it .",
    "this allows us to remove the particle background .",
    "however , if the background in the observation region is different from the average background in blank field data , this step could leave a residual background component .",
    "the residual background component is estimated by using blank - field - subtracted data in a region free of cluster emission ( in particular we consider an annulus lying between 8 and 10 arcmin ) and then subtracted in a second step from each mos and pn product . in our case",
    "the residual is negative in the energy band adopted for the spatial analysis ( [ 0.4 - 2 ] kev , see sect .",
    "[ brightness.sec ] ) .",
    "the residual count rate summed over the three detectors is @xmath13 counts / s , which represents @xmath14 of the total background count rate in this energy band .    the fluorescent emission lines excited by the energetic charged particles that pass through the detector exhibit spatial variation over the detector .",
    "this effect would compromise the reliability of the second step of the background subtraction for spectra , as the resulting total background spectrum ( sum of the particle background spectrum , estimated in the blank - field - subtracted cluster region , and the residual background component , estimated in the blank - field - subtracted outer annular region ) shows fluorescence lines which are shifted by a few energy channels with respect to the ms0735 spectrum .",
    "therefore the residual background component is neglected for the purpose of the spectral analysis .",
    "the adaptively smoothed , exposure corrected mos1 count rate image in the [ 0.3 - 10 ] kev energy band is presented in fig .",
    "[ smooth.fig ] .",
    "the smoothed image is obtained from the raw image corrected for the exposure map ( that accounts for spatial quantum efficiency , mirror vignetting and field of view ) by running the task _ asmooth _ set to a desired signal - to - noise ratio of 20 .",
    "regions exposed with less than 10% of the total exposure are not considered .",
    "the inner part of the cluster shows the high surface brightness characteristic of a cooling flow .",
    "we notice a sharp central surface brightness peak at a position @xmath15 ( j2000 ) . at small radii ,",
    "two strong depressions having a diameter of about 150 kpc ( see sect . [ brightness.sec ] ) are visible on opposite side of the cluster center in the ne - sw direction . the cavities are surrounded by a bright x - ray emission of elliptical shape , in the form expected by a radio cocoon .",
    "the elliptical discontinuity in the x - ray surface brightness appears more evident in the _ chandra _ data and has been interpreted as a weak shock ( mcnamara et al . 2005 ) . beyond the cavity region",
    "the cluster maintains a slightly elliptical morphology up to large radii , showing hints of structures that could be the results of past radio activity that created older cavities .",
    "we consider different sectors to the north and south ( n sector : between 10@xmath16 west and 60@xmath16 east of north ; s sector : between 15@xmath16 east and 60@xmath16 west of south ) and to the east and west ( e sector : between 30@xmath16 north and 75@xmath16 south of east ; w sector : between 30@xmath16 south and 80@xmath16 north of west ) in order to include and exclude the cavity regions , respectively .",
    "we also consider a full @xmath17 sector in which we mask the cavities ( hereafter undisturbed cluster ) .",
    "for each sector , we compute a background - subtracted , vignetting - corrected , radial surface brightness profile in the [ 0.4 - 2 ] kev energy band for each camera separately . for the pn data , we generate a list of out - of - time events ( hereafter oot ) to be treated as an additional background component .",
    "the effect of oot in the current observing mode ( full frame ) is 6.3% .",
    "the oot event list is processed in a similar way as done for the pn observation event file .",
    "the profiles for the three detectors are then added into a single profile , binned such that at least a signal - to - noise ratio of 3 is reached .",
    "the cluster emission is detected up to 1.3 mpc ( @xmath18 arcmin ) . in fig .",
    "[ sbprofile.fig ] we show the x - ray surface brightness profile for the sector containing the northern cavity compared from that of the undisturbed cluster .",
    "we note that the data of the undisturbed cluster appear regular , while those for the n sector show a clear deficit of emission between radii @xmath19 and @xmath0 200 kpc relative to the other directions .",
    "the s sector profile shows a behavior similar to the n one , although the depression is less pronounced , whereas the e and w sectors appear regular .",
    "the surface brightness profile of the undisturbed cluster is fitted in the ciao tool _ sherpa _ with various parametric models , which are convolved with the _ xmm _ point spread function ( psf ) .",
    "the overall psf is obtained by adding the psf of each camera ( ghizzardi 2001 ) , estimated at an energy of 1.5 kev and weighted by the respective cluster count rate in the [ 0.4 - 2 ] kev energy band .",
    "a single @xmath20-model ( cavaliere & fusco femiano 1976 ) is not a good description of the entire profile : a fit to the outer regions shows a strong excess in the center as compared to the model ( see fig .",
    "[ 1betafit.fig ] ) .",
    "the centrally peaked emission is a strong indication of a cooling flow in this cluster .",
    "we find that for 100 kpc r 1150 kpc the data can be described ( @xmath21 for 87 d.o.f . ) by a @xmath20-model with a core radius @xmath22 kpc and a slope parameter @xmath23 ( 3 @xmath24 confidence level ) .",
    "the single @xmath20-model functional form is a convenient representation of the gas density profile in the outer regions , which is used as a tracer for the potential .",
    "this best fit model is thus used in the following to estimate the cluster gas and total mass profiles ( see sect .",
    "[ mass.sec ] ) .",
    "we also consider a double isothermal @xmath20-model and find that it can account for the entire profile , when the very inner and outer regions are excluded : for 10 kpc r 1150 kpc the best fit parameters are @xmath25 kpc , @xmath26 , @xmath27 kpc , @xmath28 ; @xmath29 for 96 d.o.f . by assuming a common @xmath20 value we find : @xmath30 kpc , @xmath31 kpc , @xmath32 ; @xmath33 for 97 d.o.f .",
    "the temperature image of the cluster central region shown in fig . [ tmap.fig ] is built from x - ray colors .",
    "specifically , we extract mosaiced mos images in four different energy bands ( [ 0.3 - 1.0 ] kev , [ 1.0 - 2.0 ] kev , [ 2.0 - 4.5 ] kev and [ 4.5 - 8.0 ] kev ) , subtract the background and divide the resulting images by the exposure maps .",
    "a temperature in each pixel of the map is obtained by fitting values in each pixel of these images with a thermal plasma , fixing @xmath34 to the galactic value ( dickey & lockman 1990 ) and the element abundance to 0.4 solar ( see sect .",
    "[ global.sec ] ) . besides the evidence that the very central region is cooler than the surrounding medium",
    ", we do not notice any particular structure in the temperature distribution .",
    "the regularity of the temperature distribution points to a relaxed dynamical state of the cluster , thus excluding the presence of an ongoing merger .",
    "since cluster merging can cause strong deviations from the assumption of an equilibrium configuration , this allows us to derive a good estimate of the cluster mass ( see sect .",
    "[ mass.sec ] ) .",
    "throughout the analysis , a single spectrum is extracted for each region of interest and is then regrouped to give at least 25 counts in each bin .",
    "the data are modeled using the xspec code , version 11.3.0 . unless otherwise stated , the relative normalizations of the mos and pn spectra are left free when fitted simultaneously .",
    "we use the following response matrices : m1_534_im_pall_v1.2.rmf ( mos1 ) , m2_534_im_pall_v1.2.rmf ( mos2 ) , + epn_ff20_sy9_v6.7.rmf ( pn ) .      for each instrument ,",
    "a global spectrum is extracted from all events lying within 6 arcmin from the cluster emission peak , which corresponds to the outermost radius determined from the morphological analysis ( sect .",
    "[ brightness.sec ] ) .",
    "we test in detail the consistency between the three cameras by fitting separately these spectra with an absorbed mekal model with the redshift fixed at z=0.216 and the absorbing column fixed at the galactic value ( @xmath35 , dickey & lockman 1990 ) and studying the effect of imposing various high and low - energy cutoffs .",
    "we find good agreement between the three cameras in the [ 0.4 - 10.0 ] kev energy range ( @xmath36 kev for mos1 , @xmath37 kev for mos2 , @xmath38 kev for pn ) .    the combined mos+pn global temperature ( in kev ) and metallicity ( as a fraction of the solar value , anders & grevesse 1989 ) derived from the best fit ( @xmath39 for 1947 d.o.f .",

    "we produce projected radial temperature and metallicity profiles by extracting spectra in circular annuli centered on the peak of the x  ray emission .",
    "the annular regions are detailed in table [ profile_proj.tab ] .",

    "we also perform the spectral fitting by leaving the absorbing column density as a free parameter and find little variation in the results .",
    "because of projection effects , the spectral properties at any point in the cluster are the emission - weighted superposition of radiation originating at all points along the line of sight through the cluster . to correct for the effect of this projection",

    "in particular , in the case of ms0735 the driving energy of the shock as determined using a spherical hydrodynamic model is @xmath161 erg ( mcnamara et al .",
    "the agn outburst in this cluster is therefore heating the gas mass within 1 mpc @xmath162 at the level of about 1/4 kev per particle .",
    "the heating level increases to @xmath163 kev per particle when considering the gas mass within @xmath130 @xmath164 .",
    "this is a substantial fraction of the 1 - 3 kev per particle of excess energy required to preheat the cluster .    in order to place ms0735 in the observed luminosity vs. temperature relation for galaxy clusters we estimate that its x - ray luminosity in the 0.1 - 2.4 kev energy range is @xmath165 erg s@xmath144 . for a total , emission - weighted temperature of @xmath166",
    "kev the observed luminosity is a factor @xmath0 2.6 higher than that predicted by markevitch s relation ( markevitch 1998 ) .",
    "the departure of ms0735 from the mean @xmath2-@xmath3 relation is reduced when we correct both temperature and luminosity for the effect of the cooling flow , in the usual manner for the study of the scaling relations . in order to be fully consistent with the results presented by markevitch ( 1998 )",
    ", we estimate the effect of the cooling flow by adopting the same approach of this author .",
    "the corrected temperature is obtained by averaging the projected temperature profile after excluding the coolest component in the central 20 arcsec bin ( as estimated from a multiphase spectral fit ) , resulting @xmath167 kev .",
    "the corrected luminosity is estimated from the flux observed by masking the central 20 arcsec and then multiplying by a factor 1.06 which accounts for the flux of the hot plasma component inside the masked region .",
    "the corrected luminosity in the 0.1 - 2.4 kev energy range is @xmath168 erg s@xmath144 and the corrected bolometric luminosity is @xmath169 erg s@xmath144 , which correspond to a factor @xmath170 higher than expected from the corrected average temperature of the cluster .",
    "note that the cooling flow region in ms0735 is bigger ( see sect .",
    "[ cf.sec ] ) than the average value adopted by markevitch ( 1998 ) for the cluster sample , therefore the luminosities and temperature estimated above are not completely corrected for the effect of cooling flow .",
    "a more precise correction is obtained by estimating the luminosities from the spectra extracted after excluding the central 30 arcsec and then adding back in the luminosity expected from a @xmath20-model profile inside the masked region . in this case",
    "we find values of @xmath171 } \\sim 3.8 \\times 10^{44}$ ] erg s@xmath144 and @xmath172 erg s@xmath144 .",
    "similarly as done above , the temperature is estimated by averaging the temperature profile after excluding the coolest component in the central 30 arcsec bin , resulting @xmath173 kev . by considering these values",
    "`` fully corrected '' for the effect of cooling flow , the departure from the observed @xmath2-@xmath3 relation is slightly reduced to a factor @xmath174 .",
    "the corrected luminosity vs. temperature relations for luminosities estimated in the x - ray and bolometric bands are plotted in figs .",
    "[ lt-corr.fig ] and [ lt-corr-bol.fig ] , respectively .",
    "the ms0735 representative points are shown as red full triangles when corrected consistently with the method adopted by markevitch ( 1998 ) , and as blue open triangles when fully corrected for the effect of cooling flow .",
    "the results on temperatures and luminosities estimated in this section are summarized in table [ l-t.tab ] .      the energetic outburst and the consequently rising cavities uplift the central cool , low - entropy gas up to large radii , and the same time the compression in the shells increases the icm density .",
    "this effect of cooling flow , cavities and bright shells ( that for simplicity in the following we refer to as the cavity effect ) results in an increase of emissivity and thus luminosity . by considering a simple phenomenological model of the gas emissivity which assumes that all the gas filling the cavities is compressed into the bright shells due to the cavity expansion",
    ", we estimate that the luminosity is boosted by a factor which depends upon the cavity radius and shell thickness .",
    "for the particular configuration of the cavities observed in ms0735 , we expect an increase in luminosity by a factor as high as about 25% ( see fig .",
    "[ l-boost.fig ] ) , consistent with our measurements .",
    "note that since the cavities lie outside the cooling region , their effect is not taken into account by the methods adopted above to correct for the cooling flow .",
    "the emission from the cavity region should also be masked before estimating the average properties of the `` undisturbed '' cluster .",
    "we thus extract the spectra in the annular region 1.3 - 6 arcmin ( i.e. we excise the central 1.3 arcmin region which includes the cavities ) . from these spectra",
    "we estimate : @xmath171 } \\sim 3.1 \\times 10^{44}$ ] erg s@xmath144 , @xmath175 erg s@xmath144 , where the missing luminosity expected from a @xmath20-model profile inside the central masked region is added back in .",
    "a comparison of these values with those obtained by fully correcting for the effect of cooling flow allows us to evaluate the impact of the cavity effect on the luminosity ( cf .",
    "blue open triangles and stars in figs . [ lt-corr.fig ] and [ lt-corr-bol.fig ] ) .",
    "the observed luminosity increase is consistent with that expected by our simplified model of the structure and emissivity of the gas .",
    "we want to stress that the cavity effect may contribute to partially explain the upward departure of ms0735 from the mean @xmath2-@xmath3 relation , accounting for 25% of the increased luminosity . it may also be relevant for the measurements of the gas mass fraction in galaxy clusters : the cavities create lumps in the icm and this results in an increase of emissivity and therefore in an overestimate of the gas density .",
    "we find indeed some evidence that the gas mass fraction in ms0735 might be higher than typically observed ( see sect .",
    "[ rdelta.sec ] ) .",
    "the main conclusions of this work can be summarized as follows :    * the energetic outburst in ms0735 can heat the icm up to a level of about 1/4 - 1/2 kev per particle , depending on its radius of influence , thus contributing a substantial fraction of the 1 to 3 kev per particle of excess energy required to preheat the cluster ( sect . [ l-t.sec ] ) . only a few outbursts of this magnitude erupting over the life of a cluster",
    "would be required to preheat it .",
    "* ms0735 is a factor @xmath02 more luminous than expected from its average temperature on the basis of the observed @xmath2-@xmath3 relation for galaxy clusters ( sect .",
    "[ l-t.sec ] ) .",
    "flux limited samples of distant x - ray clusters may be biased in favor of detecting clusters with energetic outbursts . * the icm compression in the bright shells due to the cavity expansion produces a boost of the central luminosity of a factor that we estimate should be 25% , consistent with our measurements ( sect .",
    "[ l-t.sec ] ) .",
    "this cavity effect may contribute to partially explain the upward departure of ms0735 from the mean @xmath2-@xmath3 relation , and may also lead to an overestimate of the gas mass fraction in qualitative agreement with the high value of @xmath132 that we measure for ms0735 ( sect .",
    "[ rdelta.sec ] ) . *",
    "the observed scaled temperature and metallicity profiles are in general agreement with those observed in relaxed clusters ( sects .",
    "[ scaled-t.sec ] and [ scaled-m.sec ] ) .",
    "also , the quantities we measure for ms0735 are consistent with the @xmath69-@xmath3 and @xmath4-@xmath3 relations predicted by the cluster scaling laws ( sects .",
    "[ r-t.sec ] and [ m-t.sec ] ) .",
    "this probably indicates that violent outbursts such as the one in ms0735 do not cause gross instantaneous departures from the average cluster profiles and cluster scaling relations ( other than the @xmath2-@xmath3 relation ) .",
    "however , if they are relatively common they may play a role in shaping these global properties .",
