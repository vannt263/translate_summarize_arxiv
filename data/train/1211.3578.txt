    "since the discovery of @xmath6  @xcite , many charmonium - like and bottomonium - like states such as @xmath7  @xcite , @xmath8  @xcite , _ et al .",
    "_ have been observed in the past decade .",
    "the charmonium - like state @xmath6 was first observed by the belle collaboration in the exclusive decay process @xmath9 .",
    "last year the belle collaboration observed two charged bottomonium - like resonances @xmath10 and @xmath11 in the hidden - bottom decay channels @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) and @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) of @xmath16  @xcite .",
    "some of these new states including the above two charged @xmath17 states do not fit into the conventional quark model framework .",
    "various theoretical approaches including the lattice qcd  @xcite , the qcd sum rule @xcite , and the quark model  @xcite have been employed to interpret the underlying structure of these new states . despite huge experimental and theoretical efforts ,",
    "the nature of some of these exotic states is still elusive .",
    "for example , the interpretation of @xmath6 remains challenging since the discovery in 2003 .",
    "one popular speculation is that @xmath6 is a molecular state composed of a pair of heavy mesons @xcite .",
    "similarly , the two charged @xmath10 and @xmath11 states are proposed as the @xmath18 and @xmath19 molecule states within the one boson exchange ( obe ) framework  @xcite .",
    "besides the charmonium - like and bottomonium - like states , the possible existence of some molecular candidates composed of @xmath20 mesons and @xmath21 mesons is also very interesting . if the attractive interaction is strong enough between the heavy meson pair , this kind of states may exist",
    ". their behavior will be very similar to the deuteron which is composed of two nucleons .",
    "there have been some investigation of these interesting states within the obe model .",
    "however , the interaction potential derived from the obe model contains several phenomenological coupling constants and cutoff parameters , which should in principle be extracted through fitting to the experimental data .",
    "unfortunately , there is not much experimental information on the strong interaction between the light meson and heavy meson",
    ". it will be very desirable to derive the strong interaction between the heavy meson pair with a model - independent approach .",
    "especially many new states such as @xmath6 and the two @xmath17 states lie very close to the threshold . within these very loosely bound systems",
    ", the long - range pion exchange force should play an important role .",
    "therefore the chiral perturbation theory provides a natural framework to investigate the heavy meson strong interaction . in this work",
    ", we shall derive the heavy pseudoscalar meson potential order by order .",
    "chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath22pt ) is a model - independent tool to study the chiral dynamics of heavy hadrons .",
    "heavy hadron @xmath22pt is frequently used for the system made up with a single heavy hadron and light pseudoscalar mesons because of its explicit power counting @xcite .",
    "the scattering matrix can be expanded order by order in the small parameter @xmath23 , where @xmath24 represents either the momentum of the light pseudoscalar mesons or the residual momentum of the heavy hadrons in the nonrelativistic limit , while @xmath25 represents either the scale of chiral symmetry breaking or the mass of heavy hadrons .",
    "the power counting guarantees that one can just calculate some limited feynman diagrams and obtain the scattering matrix at the certain order .",
    "weinberg developed a new formalism and first extended the chiral perturbation theory to the two nucleon system @xcite . since his pioneering work ,",
    "the modern nuclear force has been built upon the chiral effective field theory @xcite .",
    "such a formalism was used extensively to investigate the various few - nucleon observables such as the partial - wave analysis , few - nucleon scattering , and reaction .    as pointed out by weinberg @xcite , the power counting of the two nucleon scattering matrix",
    "is broken by the double poles of the heavy hadrons in some 2-particle - reducible ( 2pr ) feynman diagrams .",
    "let us illustrate this point with the box diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig2pr ] . the feynman amplitude can be written as @xmath26 where we omit the parts relevant to the pion which preserves the power counting .",
    "we will focus the integral with @xmath27 , and work it out by closing the @xmath27 contour integral in the lower half - plane @xmath28 the naive power counting predicts that @xmath29 should be @xmath30 . but",
    "it is @xmath31 from eq .",
    "( [ eq2pr ] ) !",
    "@xmath29 is actually enhanced by a large factor @xmath32 compared to the naive power counting prediction .",
    "+    with weinberg s formalism , we do not directly calculate the scattering matrix of the few hadrons perturbatively with the heavy hadron @xmath22pt due to the 2pr diagrams .",
    "instead , we focus on the potential . in the derivation of the hadron - hadron potential ,",
    "one takes into account the 2-particle - irreducible ( 2pi ) parts of the feynman diagrams only and calculate the potential of few hadrons perturbatively with the correct power counting .",
    "afterwards , one can obtain the scattering matrix with the potential by solving the nonperturbative equations such as schrdinger equations , lippmann - schwinger equations , and so on .",
    "the 2pr contributions will be recovered when solving the nonperturbative equations .",
    "the reliable hadron - hadron potential is a necessary input for getting the scattering amplitude or phase shift of the hadrons .",
    "it is also essential to explore the existence of the heavy hadron molecules .",
    "for example , the binding energy or size of the molecular states can be obtained from the potentials of the hadrons by solving the schrdinger or lippmann - schwinger equations .    in this work",
    ", we shall use weinberg s formalism to derive the @xmath33 potentials in four independent channels up to 1-loop level with heavy meson chiral perturbation theory ( hm@xmath22pt ) .",
    "we include the heavy vector @xmath34 mesons as explicit degrees besides the @xmath35 and light pseudoscalar @xmath1 mesons since the @xmath35 and @xmath34 mesons would form a degenerate doublet in the limit of heavy quark symmetry .",
