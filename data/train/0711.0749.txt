    "despite its impressive phenomenological success , the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics is widely believed to suffer from a variety of conceptual deficiencies . in particular",
    ", it provides no fundamental motivation why the strong and electroweak interactions should be described by three different gauge groups , i.e.  @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 .",
    "grand unified theories ( guts ) allow for a unification of these groups within a simple lie group such as @xmath6 , @xmath7 , or @xmath8 . depending on the rank of the unifying group , one or several extra neutral gauge ( @xmath0 ) bosons",
    "appear when the unification group is broken to the sm at higher scales , exhibiting the existence of additional @xmath5 symmetries @xcite .",
    "anomaly cancellations and gauge invariance of quark and lepton yukawa couplings impose a number of restrictions on these additional symmetries .",
    "viable families of models , that are consistent with constraints coming from the cern lep collider , include those based on the @xmath9 and @xmath7 symmetries and , provided that fermion mass generation is not restricted to the sm higgs mechanism and new charged fermions are allowed , also those inspired by @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "if the extra @xmath0-bosons couple to quarks and leptons with approximately sm strength and if their mass is not too large , they will be produced at current and future hadron colliders and can be easily detected through their leptonic decay channels .",
    "the search for these particles occupies therefore an important place in the experimental programs of the fermilab tevatron and the cern lhc . for example , the cdf collaboration has searched the tevatron run  ii data for @xmath0-bosons in the @xmath10 decay channel , using the di - electron invariant mass and angular distributions and setting lower mass limits of 650 to 900 gev for a large variety of models @xcite .",
    "similar constraints come from electroweak precision fits and di - fermion production at lep2 @xcite . within the atlas collaboration ,",
    "the discovery reach in @xmath11 decays has recently been analyzed @xcite for the four classes of models defined in ref .",
    "the cms collaboration has claimed a discovery reach of masses between 3.4 and 4.3 tev for the @xmath12 decay channel and an integrated luminosity of 100 fb@xmath13 @xcite .",
    "the currently available simulations for the lhc experiments rely completely on the pythia monte carlo ( mc ) generator @xcite , which is based on leading order ( lo ) qcd matrix elements , parton showers , and the lund string hadronization model .",
    "it includes the full interference structure of new @xmath0-bosons with drell - yan photon and sm @xmath14-boson exchange , and the above - mentioned phenomenologically viable models can easily be implemented @xcite .",
    "the description of the transverse - momentum ( @xmath1 ) spectrum of the produced vector - boson can be improved by matching the parton shower to the hard emission of an extra parton @xcite , but the overall normalization of the theoretical cross section remains subject to large higher - order corrections and scale uncertainties .",
    "the cdf collaboration has therefore chosen to renormalize the generated monte carlo events with a correction ( @xmath2 ) factor in each invariant mass bin to the next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) cross section @xcite . however",
    ", this procedure does not lead to a correct description of the transverse - momentum spectrum .",
    "note also that in principle the lo cross section no longer factorizes at nnlo , i.e.  the @xmath2-factors for drell - yan and @xmath0 production need no longer to be equal @xcite .    here",
    ", we report on the implementation of extra @xmath0-bosons in the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) monte carlo generator mc@nlo @xcite , allowing to match the complete nlo matrix elements with the parton shower and cluster hadronization model of the monte carlo generator herwig @xcite .",
    "since the lo cross section still factorizes completely at nlo , this requires the implementation of the @xmath0-boson mass , decay width , propagator , and couplings in mc@nlo , together with the full interference with drell - yan photon and sm @xmath14-boson exchanges .",
    "as was the case for pythia , the emission of one additional hard parton has previously been matched to the herwig parton shower , albeit for sm vector - boson production only @xcite . as an alternative",
    ", the ckkw formalism @xcite for the matching of hard real emissions has been implemented in both pythia and herwig for sm vector - boson production with the result that the three different matching formalisms were found to vary systematically in a significant way and to depend in addition strongly on the matching scale @xcite .",
    "similar results were obtained more recently in @xcite for @xmath15-boson plus jet production , where in addition various implementations of the mlm @xcite prescription for matching multiparton final states to parton showers have been compared to the methods discussed above . here",
    ", we perform a similar study of systematic uncertainties by comparing the invariant - mass and transverse - momentum distributions as predicted with our implementation of @xmath0-bosons in mc@nlo with the pythia parton - shower and matrix - element corrections .",
    "we also confront these mc predictions with a new computation of @xmath0-boson production in the framework of joint resummation @xcite .",
    "in addition , we compare the dependence of the various predictions on the unphysical renormalization and factorization scales as well as on the employed parton densities .",
    "the impact of hadronization corrections , dominant electroweak corrections , and non - perturbative effects are also studied .",
    "the remainder of this work is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec:2 ] we first describe the pythia framework for @xmath0-boson production and the associated matching of parton showers with the emission of an additional hard parton .",

    "we also present briefly our calculation of @xmath0-boson production using joint resummation . in sec .",
    "[ sec:3 ] , we define our choice of electroweak sm parameters and define the parameters of our exemplary @xmath0 model .",
    "we also discuss the various corrections that we apply to the production cross section , i.e.dominant electroweak corrections , next - to - leading order qcd matrix elements , parton showers , and hadronization .",
    "we then compare the numerical impact of these corrections and study the remaining theoretical uncertainties , coming from the choice of renormalization and factorization scales , the parameterization of parton densities , and non - perturbative effects .",
    "our conclusions are given in sec .",
    "[ sec:4 ] .",
    "in 1984 , green and schwarz showed that ten - dimensional string theories with @xmath16 or @xmath17 gauge symmetry are anomaly - free and thus potentially finite @xcite . among these two gauge groups , only the former contains chiral fermions as they exist in the sm .",
    "after compactification , it leads to the @xmath8 symmetry as an effective gut group , that can be broken further to @xcite e_6so(10 ) u(1 ) _",

[ eq:1 ] while the @xmath0-bosons corresponding to the additional @xmath18 and @xmath19 symmetries can in general mix with each other , z ( ) = z_+z _  and   z()=z_-z _ , we consider in this work only a tev - scale @xmath20-boson as an exemplary case , i.e.  @xmath21 in the convention of ref.@xcite , and assume the @xmath22 to acquire its mass at considerably higher scales , as it is naturally the case in the hierarchy of symmetry breaking of eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) .",
    "we will furthermore assume that @xmath7 breaks down to @xmath23 at the same scale where @xmath6 breaks down to the sm group @xmath24 with gauge couplings @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 . the @xmath19 coupling g_= g= g_w= e [ eq:3 ]",
    "is then directly related to the coupling @xmath27 of the weak hypercharge @xmath28 by the usual group - theoretical factor @xmath29 .",
    "note that as the @xmath7-breaking scale increases from the @xmath6-breaking scale to the @xmath8 or planck scale , @xmath30 starts to deviate from @xmath31 to roughly @xmath32 times this value @xcite . using eq.([eq:3 ] ) , we can thus express @xmath30 in terms of a group - theoretical factor , the @xmath33 gauge coupling @xmath26 or alternatively the electromagnetic fine structure constant @xmath34 , and the squared sine of the angle @xmath35 , describing the mixing of the neutral @xmath36- and @xmath37-bosons to the massless photon and the sm @xmath14-boson of mass @xmath38 after the breaking of @xmath39 to @xmath40 .",
    "while the photon is protected from further mixing by the exact electromagnetic symmetry , the sm @xmath14-boson can in general mix with the additional @xmath0-boson with an angle @xmath41",

    "this mixing can in general induce a coupling of the @xmath0-boson to the sm @xmath46-bosons , even though they belong to different gauge groups .",

    "( [ eq:6 ] ) that is sensitive to qcd corrections is the quark - antiquark ( and beyond the lo the quark - gluon ) initial state",

    "besides the dominant qcd radiation , we will also briefly investigate the effect of the relatively suppressed qed radiation ( e.g.  @xmath73 ) as well as the corrections induced by the hadronization of the additional partons .",
    "in addition to the transverse momentum @xmath1 generated by hard emission and/or the initial - state parton shower , an average intrinsic transverse - momentum @xmath74 can be assigned to the shower initiator in order to take into account the transverse motion of quarks inside the original hadron .",

    ". its branching ratio to electron - positron pairs , representing the signal , is found to be 5.98% .",
    "these values are then passed as parameters to our modified mc@nlo and new resummation programs .    in order to set a common theoretical basis ,",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ]    the invariant mass - spectrum of the electron - positron pair in lo qcd , i.e.without any parton shower , matrix element correction , resummation , or hadronization effects .",
    "the pythia ( triangles ) , mc@nlo ( stars ) , and parton level ( full line ) mass spectra , shown in the mass range of 900 to 1200 gev around the mass peak of the @xmath0-boson at 1 tev , coincide perfectly . for comparison",
    ", we also show the differential cross section for the sm drell - yan process in mc@nlo ( crosses ) , which coincides with the corresponding lo and pythia predictions and represents the dominant ( irreducible ) background to the @xmath0-boson signal . far from the resonance region ,",
    "the two mass spectra would , of course , coincide .",
    "the transverse momentum of the lepton pair ( @xmath1 ) is exactly zero in pythia and at parton level , while the forced splitting of non - valence partons in mc@nlo induces a distribution that extends to non - zero values of @xmath1 even when the parton shower is switched off .",
    "since this distribution is unphysical , we do not show it here . when integrated over @xmath1 , the mc@nlo total cross section coincides , however , with pythia s and the one at parton level .",
    "the dominant electroweak corrections can be resummed by running the fixed value of the fine - structure constant @xmath136 in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] to the value @xmath142 at the mass of the @xmath0-boson in the @xmath128-scheme .",
    "the ratio @xmath143 then induces an increase of about 22% in the cross sections shown in fig.[fig:1 ] . in the following ,",
    "we will always use a running value of @xmath139 .      in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] , we show the three different ways of improving on the    parton - level predictions that are implemented in pythia , where one can either add qcd parton showers in the soft and collinear regions ( circles ) , corresponding to the leading - logarithmic ( ll ) approximation , or in the full phase space ( triangles ) , which however overestimates the cross section , so that it must be renormalized to the matrix element describing the emission of an additional hard parton ( squares ) . by definition , neither the total cross section nor the mass spectrum are changed and remain accurate to lo only , as can be seen from the fact that all histograms on the left - hand side of fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] coincide , after normalization to the lo prediction and within the statistical error bars , with unity .",
    "the right - hand side of fig.[fig:2 ] demonstrates that the zero transverse momentum of the @xmath0-boson is smeared by the parton showers .",
    "it then peaks around 3 gev and extends up to 700 gev ( see insert ) and even beyond , if the available phase space is opened to the full hadronic centre - of - mass energy as proposed by the `` power shower '' prescription .",
    "note that strictly speaking the ll approximation is , of course , no longer valid there .",
    "normalizing the `` power shower '' to the correct qcd matrix element describing one real emission brings the integrated cross section back into agreement with the lo prediction , as the increase of the cross section at large @xmath1 is compensated by a reduction at small @xmath1 .",
    "these predictions may be improved further in pythia by adding qed parton showers , which are , however , formally suppressed by a factor of @xmath144 , so that their influence would not be visible in fig.[fig:2 ] .",
    "the emitted additional partons may furthermore hadronize , which is modeled in pythia with the lund string model , but we have checked again that the shapes of the distributions in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] would not change significantly .      with mc@nlo it is possible to correct not only the transverse - momentum shape , but also the normalization of the total cross section . in our implementation , this is now also possible for @xmath0 production at the lhc .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] , where we show on the left - hand side that the nlo correction    factor k&&_nlo_lo  1.26 at the resonance ( @xmath145 tev ) is quite significant and depends also slightly on the invariant mass of the lepton pair . by definition ,",
    "the normalization remains again unchanged by the herwig parton shower , which affects , however , strongly the @xmath1-spectrum ( right ) . while the fixed - order prediction diverges as @xmath105 , its logarithmic singularity is effectively resummed by the parton shower and leads to a smooth turnover with a maximum at around 8 gev , i.e.  at a value that is considerably larger than in the case of pythia .",
    "note that the parton shower in mc@nlo replaces part of the nlo contribution , so that switching it off ( not shown ) does not lead to a fully correct nlo prediction .",
    "as was already the case in pythia , we have checked that adding qed parton showers or hadronization , which is modeled in herwig with the cluster model , does not lead to visible changes in the distributions of fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] .",
    "theoretically , the most precise predictions are obtained if logarithmically enhanced soft and collinear parton emission is analytically resummed , both close to threshold and close to @xmath146 , as described in sec.[sec:2e ] above . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] ( left ) , the    nlo @xmath2-factor ( dashed ) is increased further by the resummed contributions , in particular in pure threshold resummation ( dotted ) , which is only approximately described by joint resummation , as we are still relatively far from the production threshold at @xmath127 tev . only for larger values of @xmath133 would the joint and threshold resummed predictions coincide . as",
    "the additional increase in @xmath2 is only of the order of a few percent , the prediction is nicely stabilized .",
    "we have checked that the @xmath2-factors of 1.26 at nlo and 1.28 at nnlo @xcite for drell - yan lepton pairs with mass 1 tev coincide precisely with our nlo and threshold resummed results .",
    "[ fig:4 ] ( right ) demonstrates that the true nlo @xmath1-distribution ( dashed ) diverges as @xmath105 , as it must , and does indeed not exhibit the unphysical maximum of mc@nlo without parton showers around 10 gev .",
    "resummation leads again to a smooth turnover with a maximum at around 8 gev .",
    "note that the jointly resummed prediction ( full ) follows the one with @xmath1-resummation ( dotted ) very closely , as is to be expected from the definition of the variable @xmath51 and the form of the function @xmath147 ( see above ) .",
    "we now confront the `` best versions '' of the three different theoretical approaches with each other , superimposing in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] the lo    matrix element corrected predictions obtained with pythia s `` power shower '' ( circles ) , the nlo matrix element corrected predictions obtained with mc@nlo s parton shower ( stars ) , and the jointly resummed prediction matched to the nlo matrix elements ( full line ) .",
    "the correction factors for the mass spectra ( left ) , which have been normalized to the lo qcd prediction , show only a very weak mass dependence .",
    "we have multiplied the pythia mass spectrum by hand with a global @xmath2-factor of 1.26 . otherwise , within the statistical error bars the pythia @xmath2-factor would just be unity , since the normalization of the total cross section is changed neither by the parton shower nor by the lo matrix element correction , that serves to bring the `` power shower '' back into agreement with the lo qcd prediction .",
    "the mc@nlo @xmath2-factor agrees almost perfectly with the one of joint resummation , since we saw in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] ( left ) that threshold and joint resummation lead only to a very modest increase of the nlo @xmath2-factor .",
    "the theoretical uncertainty induced in the resummed prediction through the simultaneous variation of the renormalization and factorization scale by a factor of two around the central scale @xmath133 is also considerably smaller than the @xmath2-factor , indicating a nice stabilization of the theoretical prediction .",
    "the @xmath1-spectra ( right ) are , for all three improvements , no longer divergent .",
    "the pythia prediction rises and falls rather steeply around its maximum at 3 gev , whereas the mc@nlo and resummed predictions rise and fall more slowly around the peak at 8 gev , which has furthermore a slightly smaller cross section .",
    "the agreement between mc@nlo and joint resummation is impressive , in particular for a scale choice of @xmath148 ( upper end of the shaded band ) at low @xmath1 and @xmath133 at intermediate @xmath1 .",
    "we can therefore conclude that our implementation of @xmath0 production in mc@nlo reaches almost the same level of precision as our joint resummation calculation , but offers the additional advantage of an easy implementation in the analysis chains of the lhc experiments .",
    "the scale uncertainty of the total cross section ( integrated over all transverse momenta and over the invariant mass in the range from 900 to 1200 gev ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] .",
    "the lo qcd prediction ( full ) agrees with    the pythia prediction ( dot - dashed ) at the same order , as the total cross section and its scale dependence is not modified by the parton shower .",
    "since @xmath129 does not enter the calculation at this order , the full scale dependence is in fact due to the factorization scale .",
    "the lo scale dependence does , however , not give a reliable estimate of the theoretical error , since the nlo cross section ( dashed ) is considerably larger . at nlo ,",
    "the factorization scale dependence is reduced as expected , but @xmath149 makes its appearance , so that an additional renormalization scale dependence is introduced .",
    "the total nlo scale dependence is reduced to 9% ( vertical lines ) , once the leading and next - to - leading logarithms ( nll ) are resummed ( dotted ) .",
    "the mc@nlo prediction ( long dot - dashed ) agrees with the one at nlo ( dashed ) for the central scale , but has a weaker scale dependence due to the resummation of leading logarithms in the parton shower @xcite .",
    "since both the type ( @xmath1 vs.  joint ) and order ( ll vs.  nll ) of the resummed logarithms differ between mc@nlo and joint resummation , the two scale variations need not ( and do not ) coincide .",
    "we estimate in fig .",
    "[ fig:7 ] the theoretical uncertainty    coming from different parameterizations of parton densities . since the invariant mass @xmath133 of the lepton pair",
    "is correlated with the momentum fractions @xmath150 of the partons in the external protons , the normalized mass spectra ( left ) are indicative of the different shapes of the quark and gluon densities in the cteq6 m ( full ) and mrst 2004 nlo @xcite ( dashed ) parameterizations .",
    "the latter also influence the transverse - momentum spectra , which are slightly harder for mrst 2004 nlo than for cteq6 m .",
    "the shaded bands show the uncertainty induced by variations along the 20 independent directions that span the 90% confidence level of the data sets entering the cteq6 global fit @xcite .",
    "it remains modest , i.e.  about 8% , and is thus slightly smaller than the scale uncertainty of 9% .    the uncertainty at low transverse momenta coming from non - perturbative effects in the pdfs is usually parameterized with a gaussian form factor describing the intrinsic transverse momentum of partons in the proton",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig:8 ]    the effects coming from three different choices of the form factor , i.e.those of ladinsky - yuan ( ly - g ) @xcite , brock - landry - nadolsky - yuan ( blny ) @xcite , and konychev - nadolsky ( kn ) @xcite , on the quantity & = & .",
    "it is obvious that these non - perturbative contributions are under good control , as their effect is always less than 5% for @xmath151 5 gev and thus considerably smaller than the scale and pdf uncertainties .",
    "in summary , we have improved the theoretical predictions for the production of extra neutral gauge bosons at hadron colliders by implementing the @xmath0 bosons in the mc@nlo generator and by computing their differential and total cross sections in joint @xmath1 and threshold resummation .",
    "the two improved predictions were found to be in excellent agreement with each other for mass spectra , @xmath1 spectra , and total cross sections , while the pythia parton and `` power '' shower predictions usually employed for experimental analyses show significant shortcomings both in normalization and shape .",
    "the theoretical uncertainties from scale and parton density variations and non - perturbative effects were found to be 9% , 8% , and less than 5% , respectively , and thus under good control .",
    "the implementation of our improved predictions in terms of the new mc@nlo generator or resummed @xmath2 factors in the analysis chains of the tevatron and lhc experiments should be straightforward and lead to more precise determinations or limits of the @xmath0 boson masses and/or couplings .",
    "while we have shown numerical results for @xmath0 bosons associated with the @xmath19 gauge symmetry , our calculations are completely general and easily applicable to different grand unification , extra - dimensional , or other models .",
