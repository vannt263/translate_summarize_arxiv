    "the @xmath1discretization of this paper differs in an important way , both theoretically and practically , from the ` ordinary ' discretization studied in @xcite .",
    "first , we point out what the two approaches have in common , then we underline their differences",
    ".    both discretizations must have an underlying compact simple or semisimple lie group @xmath0 of any rank @xmath11 and of any type .",
    "the rank is equal to the number of variables involved in the process .",
    "then we introduce new classes of multivariate special functions , the @xmath12 and @xmath13functions in @xcite , and the @xmath1functions ( [ e ] ) here .",
    "the functions are orthogonal on a finite region @xmath14 of the @xmath15dimensional real euclidean space @xmath16 , as continuous functions as well as functions restricted to a fragment of a lattice @xmath17 .",
    "the lattice can have any density but its symmetry is imposed by the underlying lie group .",
    "thus in @xmath16 there are as many different lattices and special functions orthogonal on them as there are semisimple lie groups of rank @xmath18 .",
    "the families of @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath1functions were recognized and named in @xcite .",
    "they generalize the common cosine , sine , and exponential functions of one variable .",
    "many of their properties are described in reviews @xcite .",
    "the orbit function @xmath19 and @xmath20 are built using the finite reflection group @xmath21 , attached to each @xmath0 , and called the weyl group of @xmath0 .",
    "the @xmath1functions are built using the even subgroup @xmath22 which is not a reflection group .",
    "much less specific information is available about such groups in the literature .",
    "the @xmath1functions are simpler , for the same @xmath0 , than the orbit functions of type @xmath19 or @xmath20 .",
    "more precisely , an orbit function is a sum / difference of two @xmath1functions .",
    "they have no prescribed behavior at the boundary @xmath23 of the region of their orthogonality @xmath24 , unlike the orbit functions which are either symmetric or antisymmetric with respect to their boundary @xmath25 .",
    "region @xmath24 is a union of two adjacent copies of region @xmath14 .",
    "discretizations of the functions over lattice fragments @xmath26 and @xmath27 , particularly their orthogonality over @xmath27 , require different specific values of a number of constants required for groups @xmath0 .",
    "the purpose of the paper is to provide all of the information needed for the fourier analysis of @xmath15dimensional digital data in terms of their @xmath1function expansions , in the context of an admissible symmetry group @xmath0 .",
    "we suppose that @xmath0 is one of the classical simple lie groups with the lie algebras of types @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 .    in section  2 , some standard properties of simple lie groups and/or simple lie algebras are recalled .",
    "the properties of group @xmath32 not generally available elsewhere are important . in section  3",
    ", we describe the lattice grids @xmath33 , where the digital data is provided .",
    "the density of the grid is controlled by our choice of the integer @xmath6 . for any grid @xmath34",
    ", there are only finitely many distinct @xmath1functions that are orthogonal on the grid .",
    "also , the lowest set of such functions is described .",
    "the functions are labeled by the grid of points @xmath7 . in section  4 ,",
    "the properties of the @xmath1functions are described for each point of @xmath7 .",

    "the coefficients @xmath370 , @xmath387 , which appear in ( [ orthoe ] ) , have according to  3.5 values @xmath388 , @xmath389 for @xmath390 , @xmath391 .",
    "we represent each point @xmath392 and each weight @xmath393 by the coordinates @xmath394 $ ] and @xmath395 $ ] from relations ( [ c2me ] ) and ( [ c2le ] ) , respectively .",
    "the values of the coefficients @xmath370 , @xmath387 for @xmath396 , @xmath397 are listed in table [ f4 ] .    .the",
    "coefficients @xmath370 and @xmath387 of @xmath250 . assuming @xmath398 , @xmath399 . [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      analogously to ordinary fourier analysis , we define interpolating functions @xmath400 @xmath401 which are given in terms of expansion functions @xmath364 and expansion coefficients @xmath402 , whose values need to be determined .",
    "these interpolating functions can also be understood as finite cut - offs of infinite expansions .",
    "next we discretize the equations ( [ intc ] ) .",
    "suppose we have some function @xmath403 sampled on the grid @xmath34 .",
    "the interpolation of @xmath403 consists in finding the coefficients @xmath402 in the interpolating functions ( [ intc ] ) such that @xmath404 relations ( [ fle ] ) and ( [ orthoe ] ) allow the values @xmath405 with @xmath326 , @xmath327 to be viewed as elements of a non - singular square matrix .",
    "this invertible matrix coincides with the matrix of the linear system ( [ intcs ] ) .",
    "thus , the coefficients @xmath402 can be uniquely determined .",
    "the formula for calculation of @xmath402 , which is also called discrete @xmath1transform , can be obtained by means of calculation of standard fourier coefficients : @xmath406 we also have the corresponding plancherel formula @xmath407",
    "the @xmath1functions of the article have other undoubtedly useful properties that were not invoked here .",
    "let us briefly mention six :    * product of two @xmath1functions with the same underlying lie group and the same arguments @xmath408 but different subscripts , say @xmath409 and @xmath410 , decompose into the sum of @xmath1functions .",
    "this is a powerful property that enables building of a set of recursion relations for constructing even larger @xmath1functions .",
    "* points of the weight lattice @xmath294 of @xmath0 split into a few disjoint congruence classes .",
    "it is convenient to specify a congruence class of @xmath411 by its congruence number @xcite .",
    "there is a different linear function of @xmath412 for different lie group @xmath0 .",
    "the weights of one @xmath21-orbit , hence also the weights of one @xmath353orbit , belong to the same congruence class . as a consequence , all summands @xmath413 in an @xmath1function",
    "have the weights @xmath412 from the same congruence class .",
    "hence , the @xmath1function has a well defined congruence number . during multiplication of @xmath1functions of the same @xmath0 ,",
    "the congruence numbers of the @xmath1functions add up .",
    "in particular , the decomposition of a product of two @xmath1functions must contain summands with the same congruence number .",
    "the number of congruence classes of a @xmath0 is equal to the order of the center of the compact simple lie group @xmath0 . *",
    "another undoubtedly useful property of orbit functions , which plays no role in this paper , is the fact that they are eigenfunctions of the laplace operator appropriate for the lie group , and that the eigenvalues are known in all cases @xcite . *",
    "the @xmath1functions considered in the paper so far have the underlying simple group @xmath0 .",
    "suppose now that it is semisimple but not simple , say @xmath414 , where @xmath415 and @xmath416 are simple .",
    "then there are two options as to what to take for the even subgroup @xmath417 .",
    "the simpler of the two is to define @xmath418 .",
    "the @xmath1functions of @xmath419 are then products of the @xmath1functions of @xmath415 and @xmath416 , etc . , see @xcite .",
    "such an option is trivial , for example when @xmath420 .",
    "+ the option where @xmath417 is bigger , namely the full even subgroup of @xmath421 , is somewhat more interesting .",
    "this options is still to be explored in the literature @xcite .",
    "it is already non - trivial in the lowest case @xmath420 .",
    "* the results presented in this paper are valid for any compact simple lie group @xmath0 , including the five exceptional cases .",
    "explicit counting formulas for @xmath249 for these five cases , which were not provided here , can be straightforwardly put together using proposition [ nume ] and the appendix in @xcite . *",
    "the present work raises the question : under which conditions converge series of the functions @xmath422 assigned to a function @xmath423 by the relations ( [ intc ] ) , ( [ ctrans ] ) .",
