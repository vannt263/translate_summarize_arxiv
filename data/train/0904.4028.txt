    "when slowly changing , external controls that govern adiabatic evolution of a quantum system return to their original values , the phase of system s wave function acquires a purely geometric contribution independent of both system s energy and duration of the adiabatic process .",
    "this @xmath0 contribution , initially discovered by berry @xcite , mathematically interpreted by simon @xcite , and later generalized to non - abelian @xmath1 operations by wilczek and zee , has been the source of many interesting developments in various fields of chemistry and physics @xcite , such as molecular and spin dynamics , optics , fractional quantum hall effect , various branches of condensed matter physics @xcite , and others , such as , for example , the field of quantum information processing @xcite .    of particular interest to us",
    "is the possibility of observing _ non - abelian _ geometric phases ( su(2 ) , in our case ) in superconducting circuits with josephson junctions @xcite .",
    "such circuits are currently considered as promising candidates for scalable quantum computing architectures @xcite .",
    "even though in this paper we consider a definite physical system ( the so - called capacitively coupled flux biased josephson phase qubits @xcite ) , our analysis may apply equally well to any quantum computing architecture whose dynamics is described by the hamiltonian given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hint_2couplers ] ) .",
    "this very simple hamiltonian has properties that make the corresponding system ideally suitable for actual realization of non - abelian geometric phases .",
    "the most important of these is the presence of two doubly degenerate subspaces , one of which , @xmath2 , _ can _ support non - abelian phase , and the other , @xmath3 , _",
    "cannot_. experimentally then , @xmath3 may be used as fiducial , reference subspace relative to which various interferometric experiments involving @xmath2 could be performed .    to recall how geometric phases appear in quantum mechanics and to fix our notation ,",
    "let us consider a quantum system whose hamiltonian depends on the time @xmath4 via several controllable parameters @xmath5 , @xmath6 .",
    "it is assumed that @xmath7 forms an iso - degenerate family of hamiltonians ( no level crossings as @xmath8 varies ) @xcite .",
    "let the instantaneous energy eigenbasis @xmath9 within a give degenerate subspace be chosen , [ eq : hat ] h((t))_a((t))=e((t))_a((t ) ) , a = 1,2 , ",
    ", n. at @xmath10 , prepare the system in one of the energy eigenstates , @xmath11 , and let it evolve according to the schrdinger equation , [ eq : schrodpsi ] id_a(t)/dt = h((t))_a(t ) .",
    "then , in accordance with the adiabatic theorem , at some later time @xmath4 , the state @xmath12 will be a linear superposition of various @xmath13 belonging to the same degenerate subspace .",

    "a(t ) e^-i_0^t e((t))dt _ b _ b((t ) ) u_ba((t ) ) , where the first factor on the right is the usual dynamical phase , and @xmath14 is the unitary matrix representing additional , purely geometric `` rotation . ''",

    "when @xmath16 traces a closed loop @xmath17 in the parameter space , the system picks up a nontrivial geometric phase ( the _ holonomy _ ) , u_c = p \\{-_i a_i ( ) d^i } 0 , independent of the speed with which the loop had actually been traversed ( as long as it was done adiabatically ) . in the next section",
    "we describe a multi - qubit solid state quantum computing architecture capable of supporting such a phase .",

    "nevertheless , the presence of @xmath32 is crucial here : it guarantees separation of the @xmath25 subspace from the rest of the hilbert space .",
    "such ( at least , partial ) robustness against possible imperfections in the coupling is important since our ability to implement _ multidimensional _ geometric phases relies on the exact degeneracy of the underlying energy subspace .",
    "however , in order to have the exact degeneracy of @xmath30 , we also require that the coupling @xmath33 be the same for @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "this is a very important requirement , not easily achievable experimentally ( unless tunable coupling is available ) .",
    "additionally , since @xmath36 _ does _ appear explicitly in eq .",
    "( [ eq : states ] ) , we require good control over @xmath36 , which is not a problem experimentally . in a typical experiment , even for long times , the magnetic field ( the microwave drive ) can easily be controlled @xcite .",
    "we also point out that the sequence of operations generating non - abelian phases must be short compared to the decoherence and dephasing times . on the other hand",
    ", system s evolution must remain adiabatic compared to the couplings @xmath33 and @xmath29 and the magnetic field @xmath36 . in a typical experiment ,",
    "@xmath33 is on the order of 20 mhz , or @xmath37 ns , so the entire operation would be several hundred nanoseconds which is comparable to the presently achievable decoherence times",
    ". however , with stronger couplings up to @xmath38 mhz and @xmath39 ns it is possible to perform an adiabatic operation in several tens of ns @xcite .",
    "let us now fix a basis @xmath40 at @xmath41 and initialize the system in some state @xmath42 .",
    "we may then trace a closed loop @xmath17 in the parameter space by performing the following sequence of operations :        \\(1 ) begin , if needed , by adiabatically changing the field from @xmath43 to @xmath44 along the radial direction in the @xmath45-plane ( no precession ) .",
    "the system will pick up a phase , & & u_y = e^-i ( b_0,b_1 ) ( ^y/2 ) , + & & ( b_0,b_1 ) 2 _ b_0^b_1 ( 2gb^2a/k ) db .",

    "to demonstrate how this non - abelian scheme works in simple situations , let us find a basis in which a useful gate , such as a hadamard , can be made in a single revolution of the effective magnetic field .",
    "we want @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 , possibly up to an insignificant u(1 ) factor .",

    "other important gates , such as @xmath65 and various phase gates , can also be generated in a similar manner .",
    "we emphasize that the specially designed basis is only `` special '' in the sense that it allows a given gate ( say , a hadamard ) to be generated by following a particularly simple path in the parameter space  here , by making a _ single _ turn of the adiabatically precessing in the @xmath45-plane field .",
    "in summary , we have shown how capacitively coupled tripartite superconducting qubit system may support non - commuting su(2 ) geometric holonomies .",
    "the non - abelian character of the holonomies is due to the inter - qubit coupling .",
    "if we treat the relevant degenerate subspace as a `` geometric '' qubit , then , with a proper choice of the computational basis , any of the standard single - qubit gates used in quantum information processing can be generated by the adiabatic transport alone .",
