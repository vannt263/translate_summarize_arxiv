    "observations of type ia supernovae ( snia ) @xcite , cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) @xcite and large scale structure ( lss ) @xcite all indicate the existence of mysterious dark energy driving the current accelerated expansion of universe , and lots of efforts have been made to understand it .",
    "the most important theoretical candidate of dark energy is the einstein s cosmological constant @xmath4 , which can fit the observations well so far , but is plagued with the famous fine - tuning and cosmic coincidence problems @xcite .",
    "many other dynamical dark energy models have also been proposed in the literature , such as quintessence @xcite , phantom @xcite , @xmath5-essence @xcite , tachyon @xcite , hessence @xcite , chaplygin gas @xcite , and yang - mills condensate @xcite , etc .    actually , the dark energy problem may be in essence an issue of quantum gravity @xcite .",
    "however , by far , we have no a complete theory of quantum gravity , so it seems that we have to consider the effects of gravity in some effective quantum field theory in which some fundamental principles of quantum gravity should be taken into account .",
    "it is commonly believed that the holographic principle @xcite is just a fundamental principle of quantum gravity .",
    "based on the effective quantum field theory , cohen et al .",
    "@xcite pointed out that the quantum zero - point energy of a system with size @xmath6 should not exceed the mass of a black hole with the same size , i.e. @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the ultraviolet ( uv ) cutoff of the effective quantum field theory , which is closely related to the quantum zero - point energy density , and @xmath9 is the reduced planck mass .",
    "this observation relates the uv cutoff of a system to its infrared ( ir ) cutoff .",
    "when we take the whole universe into account , the vacuum energy related to this holographic principle can be viewed as dark energy ( its energy density is denoted as @xmath1 hereafter ) .",
    "the largest ir cutoff @xmath6 is chosen by saturating the inequality , so that we get the holographic dark energy density @xmath10 where @xmath11 is a numerical constant characterizing all of the uncertainties of the theory , and its value can only be determined by observations . if we take @xmath6 as the size of the current universe , say , the hubble radius @xmath12 , then the dark energy density will be close to the observational result .",
    "however , hsu @xcite pointed out this yields a wrong equation of state for dark energy .",
    "subsequently , li @xcite suggested to choose the future event horizon of the universe as the ir cutoff of this theory .",
    "this choice not only gives a reasonable value for dark energy , but also leads to an accelerated universe .",
    "moreover , the cosmic coincidence problem can also be explained successfully in this model .",
    "most recently , a calculation of the casimir energy of the photon field in a de sitter space is performed @xcite , and it is a surprising result that the casimir energy is indeed proportional to the size of the horizon ( the usual casimir energy in a cavity is inversely proportional to the size of the cavity ) , in agreement with the holographic dark energy model .    the holographic dark energy model has been studied widely @xcite . by far , various observational constraints on this model all indicate that the parameter @xmath11 is less than 1 , implying that the holographic dark energy would lead to a phantom universe with big rip as its ultimate fate @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the appearance of the cosmic doomsday will definitely ruin the theoretical foundation of the holographic dark energy model , namely , the effective quantum field theory ; see ref .",
    "@xcite for detailed discussions . to evade this difficulty",
    ", one may consider the extra dimension effects in this model @xcite : the high energy correction from the extra dimensions could erase the big - rip singularity and leads to a de sitter finale for the holographic cosmos .",
    "another way of avoiding the big rip is to consider some phenomenological interaction between holographic dark energy and matter @xcite . with the help of the interaction , the big rip",
    "might be avoided due to the occurrence of an attractor solution in which the effective equations of state of dark energy and matter become identical in the far future .",
    "however , it should be pointed out that in order to avoid the phantom - like universe the phenomenological interaction term should be tuned to satisfy some specific condition , i.e. , the interaction must be strong enough ; for detailed discussions see ref .",
    "@xcite . the only way of acquiring the knowledge of the interaction strength is from the observational data fitting . in this paper",
    ", we will explore the possible phenomenological interactions between holographic dark energy and matter by using the latest observational data .",
    "another important mission of this paper is to probe the spatial curvature of the universe in the holographic dark energy model .",
    "actually , the current observational data are not accurate enough to distinguish between the dynamical effects of dark energy and spatial curvature of the universe , owing to the degeneracy between them .",
    "indeed , in fitting the equation of state of dark energy , @xmath13 , the inclusion of @xmath14 as an additional parameter would dilute constraints on @xmath13 . while most inflation models in which the inflationary periods last for much longer than 60 @xmath15-folds predict a spatially flat universe , @xmath16 , the current constraint on @xmath14 is three orders of magnitude larger than this inflation prediction . as argued in ref .",
    "@xcite , the studies of dark energy , and in particular , of observational data , should include @xmath14 as a parameter to be fitted alongside the @xmath13 parameters .",
    "so , in this paper , we will constrain @xmath14 in the holographic dark energy model in light of the latest observational data .",
    "of course , we will also let the interaction and spatial curvature simultaneously be free parameters , and explore the possible degeneracy between them .",
    "in this section we shall describe the interacting holographic dark energy in a non - flat universe . in a spatially non - flat friedmann - robertson - walker universe",
    ", the friedmann equation can be written as @xmath17 where @xmath18 .",
    "we define @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the critical density of the universe , thus we have @xmath21    consider , now , some interaction between holographic dark energy and matter : @xmath22 @xmath23 where @xmath0 denotes the phenomenological interaction term . owing to the lack of the knowledge of micro - origin of the interaction , we simply follow other work on the interacting holographic dark energy and parameterize the interaction term generally as @xmath24 , where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the coupling constants . for reducing the complication and the number of parameters , furthermore , we only consider the following three cases : ( a ) @xmath27 and @xmath28 , ( b ) @xmath29 , ( c ) @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "we denote the interaction term @xmath0 in these three cases as @xmath32 for convenience , in the following we uniformly express the interaction term as @xmath33 , where @xmath34 , 1 and @xmath35 , for @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 , respectively .",
    "note that according to our convention @xmath39 means that dark energy decays to matter .",
    "moreover , it should be pointed out that @xmath40 will lead to unphysical consequences in physics , since @xmath41 will become negative and @xmath42 will be greater than 1 in the far future .",
    "so , the parameter @xmath43 is always assumed to be negative in the literature . however , in the present work , instead of making such an assumption on @xmath43 , we let @xmath43 be totally free and let the observational data tell us the true story about the holographic dark energy , no matter whether the ultimate fate of the universe is ridiculous or not .    from the definition of holographic dark energy ( [ eq : rhode0 ] ) , we have @xmath44 or equivalently , @xmath45 thus , we easily get @xmath46    following ref .",
    "@xcite , in a non - flat universe the ir cut - off length scale @xmath6 takes the form @xmath47 and @xmath48 satisfies @xmath49 thus , we have @xmath50 equation ( [ eq : l1 ] ) leads to another equation about @xmath48 , namely , @xmath51 combining eqs .",
    "( [ eq : r(t)2 ] ) and ( [ eq : r(t)3.0 ] ) yields @xmath52 taking derivative of eq .",
    "( [ eq : ol1.1 ] ) with respect to @xmath53 , one can get @xmath54    let us plus eqs .  ( [ eq : ihdeeq0 ] ) and ( [ eq : ihdeeq1 ] ) together , and then we can obtain the form of @xmath55 : @xmath56 substituting @xmath55 into eq .",
    "( [ eq : ihdeeq1 ] ) , we have @xmath57 where @xmath58 ( with @xmath59 ) denotes @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 , respectively .",
    "divided the above equation by @xmath63 , we get an equation containing @xmath64 and @xmath65 , @xmath66 where @xmath67 , @xmath68 , and @xmath69 , for @xmath36 , 2 , and 3 , respectively . combining this equation with eq .",
    "( [ eq : ol1.3 ] ) , we eventually obtain the following two equations governing the dynamical evolution of the interacting holographic dark energy in a non - flat universe , @xmath70 @xmath71 these two equations can be solved numerically and will be used in the data analysis procedure .",
    "in the holographic dark energy model with interaction and spatial curvature , there are four free parameters : @xmath11 , @xmath72 , @xmath43 , and @xmath14 . in this section",
    ", we shall constrain these parameters of the holographic dark energy model by using the latest observational data . for decreasing the complication ,",
    "let us close some parameters in turn .",
    "we shall consider the following four cases : ( a ) the model of holographic dark energy without interaction and spatial curvature ( namely , @xmath73 and @xmath74 ) , denoted as hde ; ( b ) the model of holographic dark energy with spatial curvature but without interaction ( namely , @xmath75 but @xmath73 ) , denoted as khde ; ( c ) the model of holographic dark energy with interaction but without spatial curvature ( namely , @xmath76 but @xmath74 ) , denoted as ihde ; ( d ) the model of holographic dark energy with interaction and spatial curvature ( namely , @xmath76 and @xmath75 ) , denoted as kihde .",
    "the observational data we use in this paper include the constitution snia sample , the shift parameter of the cmb given by the five - year wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap5 ) observations , and the baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao ) measurement from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) .      for the snia data , we use the latest constitution sample including 397 data that are given in terms of the distance modulus @xmath77 compiled in table 1 of ref .",
    "the theoretical distance modulus is defined as @xmath78 where @xmath79 with @xmath80 the hubble constant @xmath81 in units of 100 km / s / mpc , and the hubble - free luminosity distance @xmath82 is @xmath83 where @xmath84 , and @xmath85 the @xmath86 for the snia data is @xmath87 ^ 2\\over \\sigma_i^2},\\label{ochisn}\\ ] ] where @xmath88 and @xmath89 are the observed value and the corresponding 1@xmath90 error of distance modulus for each supernova , respectively .      for the bao data ,",

    "one feature is that for the khde and ihde models the values of @xmath115 are rather small , and their best - fit parameters ( namely , @xmath72 and @xmath11 ) are very close to the corresponding ones in the hde model .",
    "the best - fit values and @xmath97 regions of @xmath14 and @xmath43 are fairly small , implying that the holographic dark energy model prefers zero curvature and zero interaction .",
    "the other feature is that for the kihde models @xmath115 as well as the best - fit and @xmath97 values of @xmath14 and @xmath43 are much larger than those in the khde and ihde models .",
    "this indicates that there possibly exists some strong degeneracy between the spatial curvature and the interaction in the holographic dark energy model .",
    "also , the best - fit values and @xmath97 ranges of @xmath11 in the kihde models become remarkably larger than those in other cases .",
    "figures [ fig - omega_m0_and_c]@xmath116[kihde ] show the probability contours at @xmath117 and @xmath106 confidence levels ( cl ) in various parameter planes for these models .",
    "let us discuss the various cases in detail in what follows .    in fig .",
    "[ fig - omega_m0_and_c ] , we plot the @xmath97 and @xmath118 contours in the @xmath107 plane for the khde and ihde models .",
    "we see from this figure that the inclusion of spatial curvature or interaction in the holographic dark energy makes the parameter space of @xmath119 become larger . for the hde model , we have @xmath120 in about @xmath118 range , for details see fig .  1 of ref",
    ".  @xcite . however , when considering the spatial curvature or the interaction , we can only obtain @xmath120 in about @xmath97 range .",
    "in fact , in the ihde models @xmath11 could be evidently greater than one even in the @xmath97 range .",
    "this , in some sense , is good news for the fate of the universe because the likelihood of holographic dark energy becoming a phantom decreases .",
    "the negative aspect lies in that the uncertainty is enlarged owing to the amplification of the parameter space .",
    "figures  [ fig - omega_m0_and_b ] and [ fig - c_and_b ] show the degeneracy situations of @xmath43 and @xmath72 , as well as @xmath43 and @xmath11 , in the ihde models .",
    "it is clear that @xmath43 and @xmath72 are in positive correlation , and @xmath43 and @xmath11 are anti - correlated . from these two figures",
    "one can see that the observational data tell us that @xmath43 can be both positive and negative . in our convention",
    ", a positive @xmath43 will lead to an unphysical future for the universe since @xmath41 will become negative and @xmath42 will be greater than one in the far future .",
    "so , one should only consider the regions of @xmath121 in the figures as realistic physical situations .",
    "the best - fit values for @xmath43 are all close to zero , although slightly larger than zero .",
    "concretely , @xmath122 , @xmath123 and @xmath124 , for the three ihde models , respectively .",
    "the @xmath125 cl limits on @xmath43 are fairly small , in order of @xmath126 .",
    "this indicates that the observations do not favor an interacting holographic dark energy model .",
    "however , it should be pointed out that even a small @xmath43 could possibly be used to avoid the future big rip caused by @xmath120 .",
    "the sufficient and necessary condition of avoiding the big rip in the interacting holographic dark energy model with @xmath120 has been studied in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite . according to this work , we know",
    "that : for ihde1 , the condition is @xmath127 ; for ihde2 , the condition is @xmath128 ; for ihde3 , there is no late - time attractor solution , so the big rip will be inevitable . from fig .",
    "[ fig - c_and_b ] , we find that for ihde1 and ihde2 the points satisfying such sufficient and necessary conditions of avoiding the big rip actually could be found in the @xmath125 cl region with @xmath39 and @xmath120 .    the constraints on khde from the latest snia , cmb and bao data are shown in fig .",
    "the left panel shows that @xmath14 and @xmath72 are in positive correlation , and the right panel indicates that @xmath14 and @xmath11 are anti - correlated .",
    "the best - fit value for @xmath14 is @xmath129 , quite close to zero .",
    "the values of @xmath14 in @xmath118 region can be both positive and negative .",
    "the @xmath125 cl limit on @xmath14 is in order of @xmath126 , nearly as good as that for a vacuum energy model .",
    "these results indicate that the observations actually favor a spatially flat holographic dark energy model .",
    "furthermore , we consider the most sophisticated case for the holographic dark energy model , i.e. , the interacting holographic dark energy in a non - flat universe .",
    "figure  [ kihde ] shows the constraints on @xmath43 and @xmath14 of the kihde models from the latest sn , cmb and bao data .",
    "we find that @xmath43 and @xmath14 are strongly anti - correlated .",
    "it is remarkable that there exists significant degeneracy between the phenomenological interaction and spatial curvature in the holographic dark energy model .",
    "when simultaneously considering the interaction and spatial curvature in the holographic dark energy model , the parameter space is amplified , especially , the ranges of @xmath43 and @xmath14 are enlarged by 10 times comparing to the ihde and khde models . from fig .",
    "[ kihde ] , we find that the holographic dark energy model with zero interaction and flat geometry is still favored . of course , the best - fit points all indicate an interacting holographic dark energy ( with @xmath43 about @xmath130 ) in a closed universe .",
    "when imposing the physical condition @xmath39 , one can find from fig .",
    "[ kihde ] that a closed geometry is more favored .",
    "finally , we feel that it would be better to make some additional comments on the other related work of interacting holographic dark energy models . in an early work @xcite , the interacting holographic dark energy model ( namely , the case of ihde2 ) was first proposed ;",
    "subsequently , this model was constrained by using the observational data of that time @xcite . comparing with these earlier studies ,",
    "our results show a significant reduction of the errors of parameters , owing to the more accurate data used .",
    "it should also be mentioned that in ref .",
    "@xcite the interaction between holographic dark energy and matter was reconstructed by employing two commonly used parametrization form for the equation of state of dark energy .",
    "in addition , the interacting holographic dark energy models with the hubble scale as ir cutoff were also discussed in , e.g. , refs .",
    "the interacting holographic dark energy model in a spatially closed universe was investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite where an additional requirement that the entropy attributed to the ir cutoff @xmath6 should be increasing was imposed .",
    "however , in the present paper , such a condition is not imposed since an appropriate definition of entropy for a holographic universe is still obscure for us ( some studies show that the friedmann equation is consistent with the first law of thermodynamics of the apparent horizon , see , e.g. , refs .",
    "it should also be noted that there are some other versions of holographic dark energy model , for example , the agegraphic dark energy model @xcite and the ricci dark energy model @xcite .",
    "the interacting agegraphic dark energy model has been discussed @xcite , but the interacting version of ricci dark energy model has not been investigated .",
    "in this paper we consider a sophisticated holographic dark energy model where the interaction and spatial curvature are both involved .",
    "the consideration of interaction between dark energy and matter in the holographic dark energy is rather popular , since the interaction not only can help to alleviate the cosmic coincidence problem but also can be used to avoid the future big - rip singularity caused by @xmath120 . in addition , the consideration of spatial geometry in the holographic dark energy is also necessary , because usually there exists some degeneracy between the spatial curvature and the dynamics of dark energy .",
    "the aim of this paper is to probe the possible interaction and spatial curvature in the holographic dark energy model in light of the latest observational data .",
    "we considered three kinds of phenomenological interactions between holographic dark energy and matter , i.e. , the interaction term @xmath0 is proportional to the energy densities of dark energy ( @xmath1 ) , matter ( @xmath41 ) and dark energy plus matter ( @xmath131 ) . for the observational data",
    ", we used the snia constitution data , the shift parameter @xmath99 of the cmb from the wmap5 , and the bao parameter @xmath91 from the sdss .",
    "we separately considered the following cases : opening interaction but closing spatial curvature ; opening spatial curvature but closing interaction ; simultaneously opening interaction and spatial curvature .",
    "our results show that when separately considering the interaction and spatial curvature , the interaction and spatial curvature in the holographic dark energy model are both rather small .",
    "in other words , the observations favor a non - interacting holographic dark energy with flat geometry .",
    "when considering both the interaction and the spatial curvature in the holographic dark energy model , it is interesting to find that there exists remarkable degeneracy between them . on the whole ,",
    "according to the current observational data , the holographic dark energy model without interaction and spatial curvature is still more favored .",

    "<S> in this paper we place observational constraints on the interaction and spatial curvature in the holographic dark energy model . </S>",
    "<S> we consider three kinds of phenomenological interactions between holographic dark energy and matter , i.e. , the interaction term @xmath0 is proportional to the energy densities of dark energy ( @xmath1 ) , matter ( @xmath2 ) , and matter plus dark energy ( @xmath3 ) . for probing the interaction and spatial curvature in the holographic dark energy model , we use the latest observational data including the type ia supernovae ( snia ) constitution data , the shift parameter of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) given by the five - year wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap5 ) observations , and the baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao ) measurement from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) . </S>",
    "<S> our results show that the interaction and spatial curvature in the holographic dark energy model are both rather small . </S>",
    "<S> besides , it is interesting to find that there exists significant degeneracy between the phenomenological interaction and the spatial curvature in the holographic dark energy model . </S>"
