    "inflationary cosmology is a scenario that solves the horizon and flatness problems @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it provides a method for generating the approximately scale - invariant primordial density perturbations that are responsible for the large - scale structure in the universe , as well as the anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background radiation @xcite .",
    "although inflation has become the standard paradigm for early - universe cosmology , there is no direct evidence that supports this paradigm , since it occurs at a very high energy scale . in the standard slow - roll inflationary cosmology a single field ,",
    "the inflaton , is responsible for inflation and generates the primordial density perturbations . in this case , the density perturbations are approximately gaussian @xcite .",
    "however , other mechanisms for generating the density perturbations can give rise to significant non - gaussian effects @xcite .",
    "for example , dbi inflation and its generalizations , in which there is a small speed of sound , @xmath0 , during inflation , give rise to a large bispectrum , and the present limits from wmap already constrain such models @xcite .",
    "the planck satellite will take us to a new level of precision in the measurement of the anisotropy of the microwave background radiation , and it is possible that non - gaussianities will be observed @xcite . in particle physics , it is not unusual to consider a scalar field theory that has a connected four - point correlation but no three - point correlation .",
    "for example , if a @xmath1 symmetry is imposed then the three - point correlation vanishes .",
    "this is essentially the same mechanism that causes the model of ref .",
    "@xcite to have a significant trispectrum but no bispectrum",
    ". the same signature of non - gaussianities can also appear in the curvaton model if some cancellation of terms occurs @xcite .",
    "a natural question that arises within the inflationary paradigm is whether the observation of a trispectrum for the primordial density perturbations but no bispectrum would imply that there must be more than one scalar field playing a role in inflation . in this paper",
    ", we explore whether models with a single scalar field that is responsible for both inflation and the generation of the density perturbations can give rise to such a signature in the planck data .",
    "we find that this is possible , but that it seems to require a fine tuning of parameters .",

    "it is anticipated that the planck satellite will provide sufficiently precise data for it to be possible to begin distinguishing between various inflationary models .",

    "if the density perturbations are gaussian , with uncorrelated fourier modes , then the two - point correlation function fully characterizes the distribution .",

    "generically , such a model will involve a fine tuning , i.e. there will be a relationship between the potential , @xmath81 , and other terms in the lagrangian , as can be seen by simply substituting the speed limit into the equation of motion .",
    "dbi inflation , however , is an exception : the speed limit occurs without imposing any restriction on @xmath81 .",
    "this is because even the first derivative has a non - analyticity ; hence , in the equation of motion , as @xmath82 the terms involving @xmath81 vanish .",
    "if , on the other hand , neither the first nor the second derivative blows up , then there is no divergence in the equation of motion .",
    "we are interested in constructing a model with @xmath83 parametrically larger than @xmath84 .",
    "one obvious solution is obtained by taking the dbi kinetic term to a higher power : @xmath85 for @xmath86 , as @xmath87 the fourth derivative becomes singular while the lower derivatives tend asymptotically to @xmath88 .",
    "however , if this is the only kinetic term , the theory predicts a large @xmath29 . applying eq .",
    "( [ eq : cs2 ] ) to our model , we find that in the limit @xmath87 @xmath89 because small @xmath90 corresponds to large @xmath29 , this must be avoided .",
    "the simplest remedy is to insert a standard kinetic term . with the addition of functional coefficients and a potential , our first model ( referred to henceforth as the `` @xmath91 model '' )",

    "we have achieved our goal , encoding the non - gaussianities for this model in the trispectrum rather than the bispectrum , but to obtain this result we have had to tune the potential .",
    "we can examine the degree of fine tuning required by perturbing the potential . making the replacements",

    "this idea actually has limited utility , for a couple of reasons .",
    "first , the requirement of a canonical kinetic term forces the use of unappealing functional forms : the simplest model we found had @xmath94 as a gaussian in @xmath16 .",
    "more importantly , @xmath29 also scales with @xmath114 , which limits the overall use of the ratio to magnify @xmath34 .    with the constraint that @xmath114 is of order unity , the last way to enhance @xmath34 is to choose an @xmath91 as small as possible .",
    "this leads to a preferred @xmath91 for each of the allowed odd denominators : @xmath122 considering the @xmath106 dependence of @xmath34 at the end - point of this series leads us to our second model , designated the `` log model '' : @xmath123 where in this model @xmath124 .",
    "most of the equations from the previous model carry over .",
    "in particular , the potential equation , the stability equation , and the perturbation equation all continue to hold for the log model . the canonical constraint changes to @xmath125 and a similar analysis to",

    "we shall explore these models and the requisite fine tuning with numerical simulation of specific examples in the next section .",
    "we consider numerical solutions to the equation of motion using initial conditions @xmath130 and @xmath131 .",
    "an initial velocity for @xmath16 makes little difference to the end result as @xmath16 is generally driven quickly to the speed limit .",
    "the initial value for @xmath16 is set by the need for a nearly scale - invariant spectrum .",
    "the slow - variation parameter @xmath132 is required to be @xmath133 , and this usually imposes a lower bound on @xmath16 .",
    "two other observational constraints that need to be considered are the amplitude of the power spectrum and the number of e - foldings . for single - field inflation the size of the density perturbations",

    "<S> in the standard slow - roll inflationary cosmology , quantum fluctuations in a single field , the inflaton , generate approximately gaussian primordial density perturbations . at present , the bispectrum and trispectrum of the density perturbations have not been observed and the probability distribution for these perturbations is consistent with gaussianity . </S>",
    "<S> however , planck satellite data will bring a new level of precision to bear on this issue , and it is possible that evidence for non - gaussian effects in the primordial distribution will be discovered . </S>",
    "<S> one possibility is that a trispectrum will be observed without evidence for a non - zero bispectrum . </S>",
    "<S> it is not difficult for this to occur in inflationary models where quantum fluctuations in a field other than the inflaton contribute to the density perturbations . </S>",
    "<S> a natural question to ask is whether such an observation would rule out the standard scenarios . </S>",
    "<S> we explore this issue and find that it is possible to construct single - field models in which inflaton - generated primordial density perturbations have an observable trispectrum , but a bispectrum that is too small to be observed by the planck satellite </S>",
    "<S> . however , an awkward fine tuning seems to be unavoidable . </S>"
