    "this paper addresses the problem of automatic writer identification using off - line handwritten images .",
    "handwriting is a kind of _ behavioural biometrics_. writer can be recognized by capturing specific characteristics of handwriting habbit of one author , which differ from other authors .",
    "@xcite writer identification has been applied in anti - crime and historic document analysis fields , which requires high level of domain expertise and heavy work .",
    "automatic writer identification aims to recognizing person based on his or her handwritten text .",
    "researches in writer identification can be divided into two categories , off - line and on - line identification . on -",
    "line writer identification requires record the whole procedure of writing with special devices , thus the input is a time series of pen - tip positions , pressures , angles and other information about writing . on the other hand ,",
    "off - line identification merely takes scanned images of handwritten text as input , which is usually more difficult @xcite .",
    "methods for off - line writer identification can be further categorized into two groups : text - dependent and text - independent .",
    "text - dependent methods @xcite require input image with fixed text contents and which usually compares the input with registered templates for identification .",
    "in contrast with this , text - independent methods @xcite dose not make assumptions on input content and have broader applications . however , compared with text - dependent one , text - independent writer identification needs to deal with image with arbitrary texts which exhibits huge intra - category variations , therefore , and is much more challenging .",
    "figure [ fig : iam handwritten examples ] and figure [ fig : hwdb handwritten examples ] shows several examples of handwritten english and chinese by different writers . as can be seen , the main difference between two handwritten images is dominated by the text contents . for writer identification",
    ", one needs to extract abstractive written style features and fine details which reflect personal writing habits .",
    "this poses a great challenge for current handcrafted features which usually capture the local shape and gradient information .",
    "these handcrafted features may include both information of written contents ( text ) and written styles ( person ) , which may limit their performance on this task .    to address this challenging problem ,",
    "this paper leverages deep cnns ( convolutional neural network ) as a powerful model to learn effective representations for off - line text - independent writer identification .",
    "deep cnns have demonstrated its effectiveness in various computer vision problems by improving state - of - the - art results with a large margin , including image classification @xcite , object detection @xcite , face recognition @xcite , handwriting recognition @xcite etc .",
    "we propose _ deepwriter _ , a multi - stream cnn , for extracting writer - sensitive features .",
    "_ deepwriter _ takes multiple local regions as input and is trained with softmax loss on identification .",
    "the main contributions are three - folds .",
    "firstly , we design a multi - stream structure and optimize its configuration for writer identification task .",
    "secondly , we introduce data augmentation to enhance the performance of deepwriter .",
    "finally , we introduce a patch scanning strategy to handle handwritten image with various lengths .",
    "we evaluate the proposed methods on iam dataset @xcite and hwdb1.1 dataset @xcite .",
    "our methods achieves high identification accuracy of @xmath0 on 301 writers , @xmath4 on 657 writers from the iam dataset on english sentence level , and @xmath2 on 300 writers from hwdb1.1 dataset on chinese character level , which outperforms previous state - of - the - art .",
    "interestingly , our results also show that handwritten texts of different languages such as english and chinese may share common features for writer identification , and pretraining cnns on another language can lead to better performance .",
    "writer verification is similar to writer identification .",
    "writer verification system @xcite performs one - to - one comparison and determines whether or not the two input example are written by the same writer",
    ". writer identification system @xcite performs a one - to - many search in a large database with handwriting samples of known authorship and returns a likely list of candidates .",
    "writer verification performs two - class classification , while writer identification performs multi - class classification .",
    "@xcite investigates how much handwritten text is needed for text - independent writer verification and identification .",
    "experimental result in @xcite demonstrates that , given the same number of handwritten characters , verification systems achieve lower error rate than identification systems with identical feature .",
    "therefore , writer identification system is more ambiguous and difficult .",
    "methods proposed previously generally follow the pipeline of pre - processing , feature extraction and feature matching or classification , and mainly focus on feature extraction . in @xcite ,",
    "bulace et.al .",
    "combined multiple features ( directional , grapheme , and tun - length ) and used probability distribution functions ( pdfs ) extracted from the handwriting images to characterize writer individuality , achieving an identification accuracy of @xmath5 on 650 writers from iam dataset on page level . in @xcite , jain et.al . used k - adjacent segments ( kas ) features to model character contours , achieving an identification accuracy of @xmath6 on 300 writers from iam dataset on page level .",
    "these methods depend on features defined by humans , which has been shown can be learned automatically by deep cnn .",
    "we believe that with integrated training and overall optimization , deep cnn can learn to extract appropriate features to this task and outperform traditional methods .",
    "@xcite leverages cnn to identify writer .",
    "@xcite address the problem of on - line text - independent writer identification .",
    "@xcite leverages on - line writing information and deep cnns to obtain accuracy of @xmath7 on 187 writers with chinese page input , and @xmath8 on 134 writers with english page input on casia handwriting database @xcite .",
    "in contrast , this paper address the problem of off - line text - independent writer identification which is more general and difficult .",
    "this paper feeds the model with merely scanned gray - scale handwritten image , and learns effective representation with carefully designed deep cnn model , leading a more simplified and elegant method .",
    "this section will firstly introduce the design of the multi - stream structure of _ deepwrite _ and discuss how to preprocess the input image with various lengths as input for _",
    "deepwrite_. then we will describe the training and testing process with implementation details .",
    "our basic network structure is similar to _ alexnet _ structure @xcite , as depicted in figure [ fig : half deepwriter structure ] . in this paper",
    ", we denote this basic network structure as _ half deepwriter_. _ half deepwriter _ takes as input a @xmath9 image patch .",
    "input handwritten text images for identifying author are with various height and width . in particular , english sentence handwritten image are usually with high aspect - ratio , whose width is much bigger than its height .",
    "resizing input image to fixed size distorts the the shape of handwriting , leading serious information loss .",
    "we thus employ a patch scanning strategy to address this problem .",
    "the patch scanning strategy is detailed below .",
    "however , scanning ignores spatial relationships between these image patches , which contains important information to determine the writer . on the other hand ,",
    "it is expensive to keep complete spatial relationships between all image patches of input scanned handwritten image . as a trade - off",
    ", we leverage relationship between two adjacent image patches , leading to _ deepwriter _ structure .",
    "the network structure of _ deepwriter _ is depicted in figure [ fig : deepwriter structure ] .",
    "_ deepwriter _ takes as input a pair of @xmath9 image patches .",
    "_ patch 2 _ is adjacent to _ patch 1 _ , as depicted in figure [ fig : testing pipeline ] .",
    "_ out1 _ and _ out2 _ , output vectors of _",
    "fc7 _ of _ deepwriter _ , are merged by element - wise sum operation .",
    "detailed configuration of _ deepwriter _ is specified in the caption of figure [ fig : deepwriter structure ] .",
    "the number of model parameters in _ deepwriter _ is the same as that in _",
    "half deepwriter_. therefore , _",
    "dose not increase the risk of overfitting , requiring the same size of training data size as _",
    "half deepwriter_. we experimentally demonstrate that considering spatial relationship between image patches benefits writer identification .",

    "in this paper , we introduce a novel data - driven text - independent model to identify writer for off - line handwritten scanned images . we learn a carefully designed deep convolutional neural network to extract discriminative features from handwritten image patches .",
    "we investigate how the network structure affects identification accuracy and introduce multi - stream structure to leverage spatial relationship between handwritten image patches .",
    "we also investigate the appropriate method to augment training data for writer identification .",
