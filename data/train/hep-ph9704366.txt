    "a classic , and still very attractive , scenario for the generation of the baryon asymmetry of the universe , is based on the fact that very massive particles fall out of equilibrium as the temperature of the universe drops below their mass and their equilibrium density becomes boltzmann suppressed .",
    "if they decay at that epoch through baryon ( @xmath1 ) violating channels which also violate @xmath0 , a net baryon asymmetry will result .",
    "usually , in these scenarios the @xmath0 violation results from a one  loop decay diagram , whose interference with the tree level process allows the phases of the complex coupling constants to show up in the decay asymmetries .",
    "in addition to the complex couplings , to have a non  zero partial decay rate asymmetry requires the loop integral to develop an absorptive part .",
    "this actually happens whenever the loop diagram can be cut in such a way that the particles in the cut lines can be produced on  shell , and hence these particles need to be lighter than the decaying one . in the proposed baryogenesis scenarios of this kind , the light particles in the loop are just standard quarks , leptons or higgs bosons , so that the appearance of a non  vanishing absorptive part is guaranteed .    at the high temperatures at which the heavy particles decay , the light standard particles are in equilibrium with the hot plasma present , and hence a question arises on whether the existence of the background particles has any effect in the evaluation of the @xmath0 violating asymmetries .",
    "indeed , some time ago takahashi @xcite showed that the thermal effects could modify the predictions for baryogenesis in @xmath2 models by up to @xmath3 with respect to the @xmath4 results , and hence these effects may need to be taken into account in the proper computation of the resulting baryon asymmetry in specific models .",
    "the main effect of the background can be taken into account by employing finite temperature propagators in the computation of the loop . in this way it is possible to consider simultaneously both the ` direct ' propagation of a particle between two vertices in the loop and the absorption by the medium of a particle from the first vertex combined with the emission of another one towards the second .",
    "these two alternatives are actually indistinguishable in a thermal bath .",
    "another implication of the finite density background is the modification of the final state phase space density distributions , which take into account the stimulation of the decays into bosons and the pauli blocking of the decays into fermions , and this may eventually also affect the rates .",
    "in order to discuss these issues , let us start by reanalysing the scalar decays into two fermions , which is relevant in the case of heavy higgs boson triplet decays in @xmath2 .",
    "we will generalise the computation in ref .",
    "@xcite by including also the @xmath0 violating diagrams arising from mixing among different heavy states @xcite .",
    "notice that in order to have @xmath0 violation at one loop in the @xmath2 gut it is necessary to have more than one heavy state , and also the existence of more than one heavy state is natural in other models , such as the leptogenesis scenarios to be discussed later , and hence the contribution from the mixing among the heavy states is generally important .",
    "for simplicity we will consider the case in which the masses of the heavy states are significantly splitted , since the study of the @xmath0 violation in the near degenerate situation present additional complications @xcite .",
    "one generally expects that only the decay of the lightest of the heavy states , @xmath5 , will be the one leading to a net @xmath1 , since any asymmetry produced at earlier times through the decay of heavier states would be erased by @xmath1 violating processes which could still be in equilibrium .",
    "hence , one has to compute the asymmetry resulting from the @xmath5 decay , and in the case we will consider in which there is a hierarchy among the masses of the heavy states ( @xmath6 , with @xmath7 ) , it will be natural to assume that the heavier states @xmath8 have already decayed , and hence have a negligible density , at temperatures @xmath9 when the lighter one is falling out of equilibrium .",
    "let us consider the @xmath2 lagrangian involving several scalar five - plets @xmath10 containing , together with higgs doublets @xmath11 the heavy color triplets @xmath12 @xmath13 where the gauge indices are denoted by greek letters .",
    "the matter fields are in the decuplet and the fiveplet representations as usual , @xmath14 and @xmath15 since they are vectors in flavour space , the yukawa couplings @xmath16 and @xmath17 should be thought as @xmath18 matrices , but for simplicity the flavour indices are not displayed .",
    "the @xmath0 violating @xmath1 asymmetry arising from the decay of a @xmath5 and @xmath19 pair is    @xmath20 \\over \\sum_f [ \\gamma(t_1\\to f_f ) + \\gamma(\\bar t_1\\to \\bar f_f ) ] } , \\label{eqeps}\\ ] ]    with @xmath21 the baryon number of the final states @xmath22 . from the interactions in eq .

    "!   \\left ( g^\\dagger_1g_1\\right )              \\right ] } , \\label{epstriplets}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 is the heavy - to - light ratio of squared masses : @xmath25 notice that the asymmetry is null if there is a single triplet field . in this case , the result ( [ epstriplets ] ) depends on the hermitian matrices @xmath26 and @xmath27 therefore their trace has no imaginary part , and the trace of the product is equal to half the trace of the anticommutator , again an hermitian matrix .",
    "the terms in the denominator correspond to the tree level decay rate ; those in the numerator to the interference between the tree level and the absorbptive part of the loop amplitudes , and hence of the yukawa couplings @xmath16 .",
    "however , our result for the numerator differs from ref .",
    "@xcite in the sign of the first term ( in agreement with @xcite ) and a factor 2 in the second one . ] .",
    "in particular , @xmath28 arises from the loop integral in the ` vertex ' contribution , in which the @xmath8 is exchanged in the @xmath29channel ( see fig .",
    "1a ) , and @xmath30 comes from the loop integral in the ` wave ' contribution , in which the @xmath8 is exchanged in the @xmath31channel ( fig .",
    "1b ) , i.e. @xmath32 @xmath33 with @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) being the propagator of a fermion ( scalar ) with mass @xmath36 and momentum @xmath37 .    from these expressions",
    "one gets the following absorptive parts : @xmath38,\\ ] ] and @xmath39    we consider now the finite temperature effects on the @xmath0 violating asymmetry @xmath40 .",
    "the main effect comes from using instead of the usual @xmath4 propagators , the finite @xmath41 ones .",
    "we choose to work in the real time formalism ( rtf ) of thermal field theory @xcite .",
    "the green s functions computed in this formalism are directly the time ordered ones , unlike in the imaginary time formalism where different analytical extensions to real momenta lead to different green s functions ( retarded , advanced , etc . )",
    "the rtf involves the introduction of a ghost field dual to each physical field , which leads to a doubling of the degrees of freedom .",
    "the thermal propagator has then a @xmath42 matrix structure : the ( 11 ) component refers to the physical field , the ( 22 ) component to the corresponding ghost field and the off - diagonal ( 12 ) and ( 21 ) components mixing them .",
    "however , since we are working only at one loop and the external legs are physical , i.e. type1 fields , we just need the ( 11 ) component of the propagators , which are , for fermions and bosons respectively , @xmath43 , \\label{prof}\\ ] ]    @xmath44 , \\label{prob}\\ ] ]    with @xmath45 the 4velocity of the medium ( @xmath46 in the medium rest frame ) , and @xmath47 we drop the ( 11 ) subindex in the propagators from now on .",
    "as discussed previously , we neglect the background density of the heavy triplets in the one  loop diagrams does not contribute to @xmath40 , so that only @xmath48 are relevant . ]",
    "@xmath8 ( assuming @xmath6 ) , and as a first approximation we assume that the decaying particle @xmath5 is at rest ( particle motion effects will be considered in section 4 ) . using the well known property , @xmath49 we get for the absorptive part of the vertex loop integral    @xmath50-{x_k\\over 8\\pi}\\int_{x_k}^\\infty { du\\over u+1}n_f\\left({m_1u\\over",
    "2}\\right )   , \\label{eqitt}\\ ] ]    where @xmath51",
    "this is similar to the result in ref .",
    "@xcite , except for the relative sign between the @xmath4 part and the finite temperature corrections , implying that the temperature effects tend to reduce ( instead of enhancing ) the @xmath0 violation .",
    "the integral term in the r.h.s . of eq .",
    "( [ eqitt ] ) arises from the absorption of particles from the background which are energetic enough so as to put the intermediate state @xmath8 on  shell and hence make it contribute to the absorptive part .",
    "this term becomes then extremely small in the case in which the heavy masses have a significant hierarchy , i.e. for @xmath52 , since the amount of background particles which are energetic enough is boltzmann suppressed .",
    "for the finite temperature ` wave ' contribution we obtain @xmath53 , \\label{eqits}\\ ] ] so that the temperature dependence is similar to the one in the leading term of the vertex part . to give a quantitative idea of the effect , we notice that if the temperature is taken to be 1 , 1/3 or 1/10 of the lightest triplet mass , @xmath54 , the overall factor in ( [ eqits ] ) including the temperature effects is 0.53 , 0.70 or 0.99 respectively .",
    "the physical interpretation of this effect is simple : due to the thermal background , the two light fermions exchanged in the loop are subject to a pauli blocking , and this leads to a reduction of the amount of @xmath0 violation .    in this scenario",
    "there is no effect on @xmath40 resulting from the final state blocking , since this just leads to overall factors @xmath55 multiplying the rates , and hence these factors cancel in the ratio in eq .",
    "( [ eqeps ] ) .",
    "other thermal effects , such as thermal masses or wave function renormalization , are higher order in the coupling constants and hence we neglect them .",
    "the @xmath2 model discussed in the previous section , in spite of being the prototype for the ` out of equilibrium decay ' scenarios of baryogenesis , has the drawback that it generates no net @xmath56 asymmetry ( a characteristic of @xmath2 ) , and hence the @xmath1 generation is vulnerable to the anomalous @xmath1 violating processes of the standard model @xcite ( which only leave @xmath56 unaffected ) , with the consequence that all asymmetries generated within this model will be eventually erased .    a very interesting way out to this problem @xcite is based on the generation of a lepton ( @xmath57 ) asymmetry at early times , by the out of equilibrium decay of heavy isosinglet neutrinos ( the usual ones appearing in see  saw models for neutrino masses and naturally present in gut models such as @xmath58 ) .    in this section",
    "we discuss temperature effects in this kind of models , first under the minimal assumption that the standard model spectrum is enlarged to include heavy right - handed neutrinos , and then , considering the supersymmetric extension of the model .",
    "the interactions of the heavy neutrinos @xmath59 , in the basis in which their mass matrix is diagonal , are given by the following lagrangian @xmath60 where @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the lepton and higgs standard model doublets ( @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 , with @xmath66 ) .",

    "( [ xdef ] ) and @xmath68 notice that , in full analogy with the @xmath2 case , a single right handed neutrino would be unable to generate any asymmetry .",

    "clearly separate into the pieces coming from the @xmath4 propagators , the one from the thermal correction to the fermion ( @xmath74 ) propagator , the one from the thermal piece of the boson ( @xmath75 ) propagator and the product of these two corrections .",
    "however , it is easy to check that the bose and fermi distributions satisfy @xmath76 so that the main temperature correction cancels out ( only the small integral term in @xmath77 survives ) .",
    "this is due to the opposite effects resulting from the pauli blocking of the loop fermion line and the stimulation of the bosonic loop line . on the other hand , here again the final state statistical factors @xmath78 cancel in the expression for @xmath40 , and as a result no significant temperature dependent effect is found .",
    "this scenario has also received considerable attention within a supersymmetric framework @xcite , in particular because the scalar partner of the heavy neutrino @xmath79 is a good candidate for being the inflaton field , in which case the @xmath57 asymmetry could be produced during the process of reheating of the universe as @xmath79 decays @xcite . in this case , as we will now show , another interesting cancellation is found in the asymmetry produced by @xmath79 decay .",
    "the scalar neutrino can decay either into two scalars ( @xmath80 ) or into two fermions ( @xmath81 ) , and the contribution to @xmath0 violation in one channel is obtained from the loop involving the particles of the other channel @xcite .",
    "the thermal effects will modify the asymmetries corresponding to each channel , in a way similar as they did in the case of @xmath2 .",
    "for instance , in the @xmath80 channel , if we ignore the small integral piece coming from the vertex ( equivalent to the last term in the r.h.s . of eq .",

    "one has instead that @xmath85 the total asymmetry produced in the @xmath86 decay is @xmath87 with the surprising result that the main corrections arising from thermal effects actually cancel out , leading to @xmath88    notice that there are also new supersymmetric diagrams contributing to the @xmath0 violating asymmetry in the heavy neutrino decays .",
    "however , since the particles in the loop as well as the external ones are always one fermion and one boson , both massless , the cancellation found in the previous subsection will also occur in the new channels , and therefore there are no significant thermal corrections to the zero temperature result of ref . @xcite .",
    "in the discussion so far we have always considered the decay rate of a particle at rest in the thermal bath . however , the decaying particle will in general",
    "be moving through the background with non zero velocity @xmath89 . since now the lorentz symmetry is explicitly broken by the plasma , this motion can in principle affect the thermal corrections to the decay asymmetry .",
    "when the leading thermal corrections cancel , as in the leptogenesis scenarios discussed in section  3 , the effects of the motion of the decaying particle will provide the main thermal corrections , and hence it is worth to quantify them . to estimate the size of these effects",
    ", we will consider here the case of the heavy neutrino decay in the non - supersymmetric model .",
    "the other cases can be analysed similarly .",
    "it is convenient to compute the decay rate asymmetries in the rest frame of the decaying particle , where the medium will be characterised by a non trivial 4-velocity @xmath90 , with @xmath91 as usual . in this system ,",
    "the effect of the motion will reflect in a modification of the equilibrium distributions appearing in the thermal propagators , eqs .",
    "( [ prof][prob ] ) .",
    "the decay rate will also depend on @xmath92 through the final state phase space factors , which for the case of fermion decays is @xmath93\\left[1+n_b(k_h\\cdot u)\\right]= { 2\\over 1-{\\rm exp}(-m_1\\gamma /t)}p_\\beta(\\cos\\theta),\\ ] ] where @xmath94 is the angle between @xmath95 and the momentum of the final state lepton , and we have introduced @xmath96 we see that now there is a privileged direction selected by the plasma spatial velocity and therefore the decay process is no more isotropic : the rate depends on the angle of the decay product trajectories with respect to this direction .",
    "due to statistics the fermions ( bosons ) are preferentially emitted in the direction parallel ( antiparallel ) to the plasma velocity , which corresponds to the less ( more ) occupied region of the thermal distribution .",
    "anyway , since we are interested in the total decay rate , the angular dependence is integrated out and we are left only with a @xmath97 dependence and @xmath98 @xcite . ] .",
    "let us define @xmath99 as the integrated asymmetry generated in the decay of a heavy neutrino moving with velocity @xmath100 .",
    "the decaying particles will actually have a distribution of velocities with occupation numbers @xmath101 , where @xmath102 . to estimate the overall effect of the particle motion we may just approximate this distribution with the fermi dirac distribution , @xmath103 , and compute the average asymmetry @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the particle s volume density and @xmath106 it is clear that @xmath107 , computed for a given temperature @xmath41 , is just the asymmetry that would result if the initial thermal population of heavy neutrinos went out of equilibrium and decayed all simultaneously at temperature @xmath41 .",
    "we will use the asymmetry @xmath107 as an indicator of the possible effects of the particle motion , although clearly to obtain the exact impact of this into the final lepton asymmetry would require to integrate the whole boltzmann equations , a task beyond our scopes .    to obtain the decay asymmetry at a fixed velocity @xmath99",

    "we showed that the @xmath0 asymmetry depends on the particle motion , since the background density distribution , and hence the thermal corrections , are now modified in the rest frame of the decaying particle .",
