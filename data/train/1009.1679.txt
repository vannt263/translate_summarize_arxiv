    "high energy cosmic neutrino observations provide a rare opportunity to explore the neutrino - nucleon ( @xmath1n ) interaction behavior beyond energies accessible by the present accelerators .",
    "these neutrinos interact during their propagation in the earth and produce energetic muons and taus .",
    "these secondary leptons reach underground neutrino detectors and leave detectable signals .",
    "the detection rate is , therefore , sensitive to neutrino - nucleon interaction probability .",
    "the center - of - mass energy of the collision , @xmath2 , is well above @xmath3 tev for cosmic neutrino energies on the order of 1 eev ( @xmath4 gev ) .",
    "this is a representative energy range for the bulk of the gzk cosmogenic neutrinos , generated by the interactions between the highest energy cosmic ray nucleons and the cosmic microwave background photons  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1n collision cross section can vary greatly if non - standard particle physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) is considered in the high energy regime of @xmath5 tev .",
    "the extra - dimension scenarios , for example , have predicted such effects  @xcite . in these scenarios ,",
    "the virtual exchange of kaluza - klein graviton  @xcite , or microscopic black hole production  @xcite leads to a substantial increase of the neutrino - nucleon cross section by more than two orders of magnitude above the sm prediction .",
    "the effect would be sizable enough to affect the expected annual event rate ( @xmath6 ) of the gzk neutrinos in the @xmath7 km@xmath8 instrumentation volume of an underground neutrino telescope such as the icecube observatory .",
    "thereby the search for extremely - high energy ( ehe ) cosmic neutrinos leads to constraints on non - standard particle physics  @xcite .",
    "the icecube neutrino observatory has already begun ehe neutrino hunting with the partially deployed underground optical sensor array  @xcite .",
    "the 2007 partial icecube detector realized a @xmath9 km@xmath10 effective area for muons with @xmath0 gev and recently placed a limit on the flux of ehe neutrinos approximately an order of magnitude higher than the expected gzk cosmogenic neutrino intensities with 242 days of observation  @xcite .",
    "since new particle physics may vary the cross section by more than an order of magnitude as we noted above , this result should already imply a meaningful bound on the @xmath1n cross section . in this paper",
    ", we study the constraint on the @xmath1n cross section ( @xmath11 ) by the null detection of ehe neutrinos with the 2007 icecube observation .",
    "a model - independent bound is derived by estimating the lepton intensity at the icecube depth with the sm cross section scaled by a constant .",
    "the constraint is displayed in the form of the excluded region on the plane of the cosmic neutrino flux and @xmath12 .",
    "it is equivalent to an upper - bound on @xmath12 for a given flux of astrophysical ehe neutrinos .",
    "we also study the model - dependent constraint on the microscopic black hole creation by neutrino - nucleon collision predicted in the extra - dimension scenario  @xcite .",
    "we calculate the fluxes of leptons propagating in the earth including the black hole cross section and the final states to estimate expected event rate in an equivalent icecube 2007 measurement as a function of extraterrestrial neutrino intensity .",
    "the null detection of signal candidates leads to a constraint on this particular scenario .",
    "there are several works on model - independent upper bounds of @xmath11 using the observational limit of ehe neutrino flux in the literature",
    "@xcite derived the bound using the results of horizontal air shower search by agasa  @xcite and fly s eye  @xcite . refs .",
    "@xcite set the limit based upon the flux bound by the rice experiment  @xcite .",
    "our approach in the present study is different mainly in two respects .",
    "the previous works assumed the gzk cosmogenic neutrino bulk as the _ guaranteed _ beam and deduced the cross section limit using the gzk neutrino intensity .",
    "here extraterrestrial neutrino intensity is considered as a free parameter .",
    "this method is an application of the technique to derive the flux limit based upon the quasi - differential event rate  @xcite , which is independent of specific neutrino flux models . as ehe cosmic ray composition and their origin",
    "are still quite uncertain , this approach provides more appropriate conservative limits on @xmath11 .",
    "it also allows estimation of the minimum intensity of neutrino flux required to constrain the cross section .",
    "another difference is that the previous works introduced the simplification that event rate solely depends on rates of electromagnetic or hadronic cascades directly initiated by neutrinos inside the effective volume of the detector .",
    "this is in fact a good approximation for the rice experiment which is sensitive to radio emission from shower events .",
    "however , underground neutrino telescopes such as icecube have larger effective area for through - going muons and taus in ehe neutrino search  @xcite .",
    "this study of the model - independent limit includes calculation of not just intensities of neutrinos but also the secondary muon and tau fluxes reaching the detection volume for a given @xmath11 and includes their contributions in the overall event rate .",
    "the paper is outlined as follows : first we discuss the model - independent constraint in sec .",
    "[ sec : model - indep - bound ] .",
    "the method to calculate the neutrino and the secondary lepton propagation from the earth s surface to the icecube detector depth is described .",
    "the fluxes for different strengths of @xmath11 are calculated and the resultant constraint is shown for both @xmath11 and the cosmic neutrino flux at neutrino energies of 1 and 10 eev , respectively .",
    "[ sec : bh - bound ] describes the constraint on the microscopic black hole production by neutrino - nucleon interaction as an example of the model dependent bound on @xmath11 .",
    "fluxes of muons and taus from evaporation of black holes produced in the neutrino - nucleon collision in the earth are calculated .",
    "their contributions , as well as those from contained hadronic showers induced directly by the evaporation , would give an observable event rate in the icecube 2007 measurement , and thereby put constraints on the black hole scenario .",
    "we summarize our conclusions in sec .",
    "[ sec : summary ] .",
    "the flux limit obtained by the present icecube observations allows us to place an upper bound on the neutrino - nucleon cross section in a model independent manner ; new physics can not increase @xmath11 too much , otherwise ehe neutrinos would have produced observable events . as an underground neutrino telescope is sensitive to not just shower events induced from neutrinos , but to through - going muons and taus generated by the neutrino - nucleon scattering , one must understand how much fluxes of these leptons reaching an underground detection volume is increased with @xmath11 . in this section ,",
    "we first discuss our method to calculate intensities of neutrinos , muons , and taus at the underground depth of the icecube observatory for a wide range of @xmath11 strength , followed by a description of how they would contribute to the event rate .",
    "finally the constraint on both @xmath11 and cosmic neutrino flux is described together with the relevant discussions .      given a neutrino flux at the surface of the earth , the neutrino and charged lepton fluxes at the icecube depth are calculated by the coupled transportation equations  @xcite : @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are differential fluxes of charged leptons ( muons and taus ) and neutrinos , respectively .",

    "it is an extremely intensive computational task to resolve the coupled questions above for every possible value of @xmath25 . to avoid this difficulty",
    ", we introduce two assumptions to decouple calculation of @xmath28 from the charged lepton transportation equation .",
    "the first is that distortion of the neutrino spectrum by the neutral current reaction is small and the other is that regeneration of neutrinos due to muon and tau decay and their weak interactions is negligible .",
    "these are very good approximations in the energy region above @xmath29 gev where even tau is unlikely to decay before reaching the icecube instrumentation volume",
    ". then the neutrino flux is simply given by the beam dumping factor as @xmath30 where @xmath31 is column density of the propagation path from the earth surface to the icecube depth .",

    "calculation of the neutrino and the charged lepton fluxes with this method is feasible for a wide range of @xmath41 without any intensive computation .",
    "a comparison of the calculated fluxes with those obtained without the introduced simplification for a limited range of @xmath41 indicates that the relative difference we found in the resultant @xmath42 is within 40% .",
    "since this analysis involves an _ order _ of magnitude of increase in @xmath12 , the introduced approximations provide sufficient accuracy for the present study .",

    "one can see that the intensity is nearly proportional to @xmath41 as expected since the interaction probability to generate muons and taus linearly depends on @xmath12 .",
    "it should be pointed out , however , that the dependence starts to deviate from the complete linearity when the propagation distance is comparable to the mean free path of neutrinos , as one can find in the case of @xmath46 in the figure .",
    "this is because the neutrino beam dumping factor in eq .",

    "the effective area for @xmath57s , @xmath58 , is proportional to @xmath25 _ i.e. _ , @xmath41 so the rate of contained shower events is linearly dependent on the neutrino - nucleon scattering probability . note that the differential limit of the neutrino flux is given by eq .",
    "[ eq : event_rate ] for @xmath59 with @xmath60 which corresponds to the 90 % confidence level average upper limit .",
    "this calculation is valid when the cosmic neutrino flux @xmath61 and the cross section @xmath25 do not rapidly change over a decade of neutrino energy around @xmath50 . limiting @xmath25 in the present analysis corresponds to an extraction of the relation between @xmath41 and the ( unknown ) cosmic neutrino flux @xmath62 yielding @xmath60 .",
