    "spin - orbital physics@xcite is a very exciting and challenging field of research within the theory of strongly correlated electrons .",
    "well known examples of mott insulators with active orbital degrees of freedom are two - dimensional ( 2d ) and three - dimensional ( 3d ) cuprates , @xcite colossal magnetoresistance manganites,@xcite and vanadates .",
    "@xcite these realistic models are rather complicated and difficult to investigate due to spin - orbital entanglement on exchange bonds .",
    "@xcite a common feature of spin - orbital models is intrinsic frustration of the orbital superexchange which follows from the directional nature of orbital states and their interactions .",
    "the orbital interactions are frequently considered alone , leading to orbital ordered states , @xcite to valence bond crystal or to orbital pinball liquid exotic quantum states.@xcite    we concentrate below first on probably the simplest model that describes orbital - like superexchange , the so - called orbital compass model ( ocm),@xcite introduced long ago by kugel and khomskii .",
    "@xcite this 2d model attempts to capture orbital anisotropies via couplings that are ising - like along each bond , but where different spin components are active along different bond directions .",
    "a frequently used convention is that interactions take the form @xmath0 and @xmath1 along the @xmath2 and @xmath3 axis of the square lattice . despite its deceptive simplicity",
    ", the compass model is challenging even for classical interactions.@xcite recent interest in this model is motivated by its interdisciplinary character as it plays a role in the variety of phenomena beyond the correlated oxides ; is is also dual to recently studied models of @xmath4 superconducting arrays,@xcite namely to the hamiltonian introduced by xu and moore,@xcite and to the toric code model in a transverse field.@xcite its 2d and 3d version was studied in the general framework of unified approach to classical and quantum dualities @xcite and in the 2d case it was proven to be self - dual.@xcite the ocm was also suggested as an effective description for josephson arrays of protected qubits,@xcite as realized in recent experiment.@xcite it could also describe polar molecules in optical lattices and systems of trapped ions.@xcite recent developments on arrays of nitrogen - vacancy centers , constituting point - like defects in a diamond matrix,@xcite bring a further motivation to the study of ocm , as shown in ref . .    for further discussion of the properties of the 2d ocm it is helpful to recall the one - dimensional ( 1d ) case .",
    "the 1d generalized variant of the compass model with @xmath5-th and @xmath6-th spin component interactions that alternate on even / odd exchange bonds is strongly frustrated , similar to the 2d ocm .",
    "the 1d ocm can be solved exactly by analytical methods in two different ways.@xcite we note that the 1d ocm is equivalent to the 1d anisotropic xy model , solved exactly in the seventies.@xcite an exact solution of the 1d ocm demonstrates that certain nn spin correlation functions change discontinuously at the point of a quantum phase transition ( qpt ) when both types of interactions have the same strength , similarly to the 2d ocm .",
    "this somewhat exotic behavior is due to the qpt occurring in this case at the multicritical point in the parameter space.@xcite the entanglement measures , together with so called quantum discord in the ground state characterizing the quantumness of the correlations , were analyzed recently@xcite to find the location of quantum critical points and to show that the correlations between two pseudospins on even bonds are essentially classical in the 1d ocm .",
    "a slight anisotropy of the interactions leads to particular short - range correlations dictated by the stronger interaction , but balanced interactions induce a qpt to a highly degenerate disordered ground state .",
    "the 2d ocm is similarly characterized by both classical correlations on ordered bonds and by large ground state degeneracy .",
    "balanced interactions @xmath7 define here a qpt between competing types of 1d nematic orders : for @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) , antiferromagnetic ( af ) chains form along @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) that are  in the thermodynamic limit  not coupled along @xmath3 ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "when going through the qpt , nearest neighbor ( nn ) spin correlations are discontinuous.@xcite this picture is supported by high - order perturbation theory,@xcite a rigorous mathematical approach,@xcite mean field ( mf ) theory on the jordan - wigner fermions,@xcite and a sophisticated infinite projected entangled - pair state ( peps ) algorithm.@xcite    at the isotropic point @xmath7 , the nematic order with its highly degenerate ground state manifold persists .",
    "it has been shown by quantum monte - carlo methods to remain stable at finite temperature up to @xmath10 and the phase transition to the fully disordered ( paramagnetic ) phase is in the ising universality class.@xcite this resembles periodic frustrated ising models , where also a phase transition at finite temperature is found.@xcite the ground state degeneracy was found to be exponential in the linear size of the system,@xcite implying subextensive entropy at zero temperature .",
    "as shown by douot _",
    "et al._,@xcite the eigenstates of the ocm are twofold degenerate and the number of low energy excitations scales as linear size of the system .",
    "it has also been shown@xcite that the isotropic ocm is not critical in the sense that the spin waves remain gapful in the ground state , confirming that the order in the 2d ocm is not of magnetic type .",
    "while the compass model is used to describe a variety of systems , see above , it represents a generic simplified concept of the orbital physics .",
    "modifications that bring it closer to specific systems have been suggested , which allow one on one hand to assess how robust the features of the ocm are , and on the other lead to insights about the ocm itself .",
    "it was proven by exact diagonalization of small systems that the low energy excitations of the ocm correspond to the spin flips of whole rows or columns of the 2d lattice and that these characteristic excitations survive when a small admixture of the heisenberg interactions is included into the compass hamiltonian .",
    "@xcite a second generalization interpolates between the ocm and an isotropic ising model , this will be here referred to as the generalized compass model ( gcm ) .",
    "the elaborated multiscale entanglement - renormalization ansatz ( mera ) calculations , together with high - order spin - wave expansion,@xcite showed that the 2d gcm undergoes a second order qpt between the generic ocm and the ising model .",
    "recent progress in the 2d ocm was achieved by making use of its symmetries .",
    "it has been shown that the symmetry allows one to reduce the original @xmath11 compass cluster to a smaller @xmath12 one with modified interactions@xcite which made it possible to obtain exact eigenspectra for larger clusters , @xcite and investigate the specific heat up to a @xmath13 system.@xcite the spin transformations that provided this reduction were also used to uncover a hidden order in the ground state of ocm,@xcite manifested by the exact identities in the four - spin correlation function valid despite imposed anisotropy .",
    "it has been shown numerically that site dilution reduces ordering temperatures , but keeps the nematic character intact.@xcite electron itinerancy has been addressed in the weak - coupling limit at temperatures above the ordering transition .",
    "@xcite    the purpose of this paper is to characterize the motion of a single hole in the ordered phases of both the ocm and the gcm , by obtaining the spectral functions of the itinerant models that reproduce both compass models in the strong coupling regime .",
    "a great advantage of using the itinerant models is that a variational cluster approach ( vca ) could be used to obtain unbiased results for both weak and strong coupling regime .",
    "the vca was introduced to study strongly correlated electrons in models with local interactions .",
    "@xcite recently the vca was used for the description of the excitonic insulator state in the two - orbital hubbard model,@xcite appearing in the broad parameter range between band and mott insulator phases .",
    "this method was successfully applied to investigate hole propagation in the @xmath14 orbital model.@xcite we will compare its results here with mf results valid for weak coupling .    since superexchange interactions are here ising - like , quantum fluctuations are suppressed and the paradigm for hole propagation known from the spin @xmath15-@xmath16 model , i.e. , via coupling to such fluctuations,@xcite may no longer apply .",
    "indeed , it has been recognized that the ising - like superexchange arising for @xmath14 electrons in @xmath17 planes of sr@xmath18vo@xmath19 implies that holes move mostly via three - site terms instead .",
    "@xcite in the case of @xmath20 electrons , describing ferromagnetic ( fm ) lamno@xmath21 planes , inter - orbital hopping becomes an additional possibility.@xcite    however , all these models show truly 2d magnetic order in the ground state . while propagation along the 1d ordered chains of the ocm may be expected to show features characteristic of ising - like order , the second and disordered direction presents a qualitatively new challenge . concerning magnetism ( resp .",
    "orbital superexchange ) , these bonds are inactive in the thermodynamic limit and do not contribute to the energy .",
    "a hole can , in contrast , still hop on these bonds and might thus in principle mediate couplings between ordered chains . as we are going to show ,",
    "the symmetries of the ocm imply that this does not happen : the kinetic hamiltonian of the hole turns out not to depend on the relative orientation of neighboring chains .",
    "we are also going to see that propagation in one of the two orbitals reveals the signatures of ising - like order , namely it depends crucially on three - site hopping processes allowing for coherent propagation along the ordered chains .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : hub ] we present both compass models and their itinerant counterparts . in sec .",

    "summary and conclusions are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : summa ] .",
    "the paper is supplemented by three appendices with more technical details : in appendix [ sec:3site ] we show the form of the three - site hopping hamiltonians for the ocm and the gcm , in appendix [ sec : basis ] we show how the gcm and the ocm can be related to each other by the rotation in the space of fermion operators at the level of their itinerant models , and in appendix [ sec : y ] we derive the form of the hopping hamiltonian after the transformation that changes the sign of coupling in the ocm .",
    "the quantum compass model ( ocm ) on a square lattice is defined as ( we consider here af interactions with @xmath26 ) , @xmath27 where @xmath28 are @xmath29 pseudospin operators and @xmath30 is a shorthand notation for the nearest neighbor of site @xmath31 in the direction @xmath32 .",
