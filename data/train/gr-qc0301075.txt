    "the study of @xmath5-decaying cosmological models has recently been the subject of particular interest both from classical and quantum aspects .",
    "a dynamical characteristic for the cosmological term was already attributed by quantum field theorists since the developments in particle physics and inflationary scenarios . according to modern quantum field theory",
    ", the structure of a vacuum turns out to be interrelated with some spontaneous symmetry - breaking effects through the condensation of quantum ( scalar ) fields .",
    "this phenomenon gives rise to a non - vanishing vacuum energy density of the scale @xmath6 ( @xmath7 is the plank mass ) .",
    "therefore , the bare cosmological constant may receive potential contributions from this mass scale resulting in a large effective cosmological constant which is too far from its present upper band .",
    "this is known as the cosmological constant problem .",
    "the @xmath5 decaying models may serve as potential candidates to solve this problem by decaying the large value of the cosmological constant @xmath5 to its present observed value .    also , there are strong ( astronomical ) observational motivations for considering cosmological models in which @xmath5 is dynamically decreasing as @xmath8 .",
    "some models assume _ a priori _ a fixed value for the parameter @xmath9 . the case @xmath10 , corresponding to the cosmic string matter , has mostly been taken based on dimensional considerations by some authors @xcite .",
    "the case @xmath11 which resembles the ordinary radiation has also been considered by some other authors @xcite .",
    "a third group of authors have also studied the case @xmath12 corresponding to the ordinary matter @xcite .",
    "there are also some other models in which the value of @xmath9 is not fixed _ a priori _ and the numerical bounds on the value of @xmath9 is estimated by observational data or obtained by calculation of the quantum tunnelling rate @xcite .",
    "other aspects of @xmath5-decaying models have also been discussed with no specific numerical bounds on @xmath9 @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "the idea that our 4-dimensional universe might have emerged from a higher dimensional space - time is now receiving much attention @xcite where the compactification of higher dimensions plays a key role .",
    "meanwhile , the recent distance measurements of type ia supernova suggest strongly an accelerating universe @xcite . this accelerating expansion is generally believed to be driven by an energy source called _ dark energy _ which provides negative pressure , such as a positive cosmological constant @xcite , or a slowly evolving real scalar field called _ quintessence _ @xcite . moreover ,",
    "the basic conclusion from all previous observations that @xmath13 70 percent of the energy density of the universe is in a dark energy sector , has been confirmed after the recent wmap @xcite .    to model a universe based on these considerations",
    "one may start from a fundamental theory including both gravity and standard model of particle physics . in this",
    "regards , it is interesting to begin with ten or eleven - dimensional space - time of superstring / m - theory , in which case one needs a compactification of ten or eleven - dimensional supergravity theory where an effective 4-dimensional cosmology undergoes acceleration .",
    "however , it has been known for some time that it is difficult to derive such a cosmology and has been considered that there is a no - go theorem that excludes such a possibility , if one takes the internal space to be time - independent and compact without boundary @xcite .",
    "however , it has recently been shown that one may avoid this no - go theorem by giving up the condition of time - independence of the internal space ; and a solution of the vacuum einstein equations with compact hyperbolic internal space has been proposed based on this model .",
    "similar accelerating cosmologies can also be obtained for sm2 and sd2 branes , not only for hyperbolic but also for flat internal space .    on the other hand , from cosmological point of view , it is not so difficult to find cosmological models in which the 4-dimensional universe undergoes an accelerating expansion and the internal space contracts with time , exhibiting the _ dynamical compactification _",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite .    in @xcite , for instance",
    ", it is shown that using a more general metric , as compared to ref @xcite , and introducing matter without specifying its nature , the size of compact space evolves as an inverse power of the radius of the universe .",
    "the friedmann - robertson - walker equations of the standard four - dimensional cosmology is obtained using an effective pressure expressed in terms of the components of the higher dimensional energy - momentum tensor , and the negative value of this pressure may explain the acceleration of our present universe .    to the author s knowledge the question of @xmath5-decaying cosmological model has not received much attention in higher dimensional kaluza - klein cosmologies . moreover , the exotic matter has not been considered as an alternative candidate to produce the acceleration of the universe . the purpose of the present paper is to study a @xmath0-dimensional kaluza - klein cosmology , with an extended robertson - walker type metric , in this context .",
    "as we are concerned with cosmological solutions , which are intrinsically time dependent , we may suppose that the internal space is also time dependent .",
    "it is shown that by taking this higher dimensional metric and introducing a 4-dimensional exotic matter , a decaying cosmological term @xmath14 is appeared as a type of dark energy and the resulting field equations yield the exponential solutions for the scale factors of the four - dimensional universe and the internal space .",
    "these solutions may account for the accelerating universe and dynamical compactification of extra dimensions , driven by the negative pressure of the exotic matter .",
    "remaining spatial dimensions . ]",
    "it should be noted , however , that the solutions in principle describe typical inflation rather than the recently observed acceleration of the universe which is known to take place in an ordinary matter dominated universe .",
    "nevertheless , regarding the fact that about 70 percent of the total energy density of the universe is of dark energy type with negative pressure , we may approximate the matter content of the universe with almost dark energy and consider the present model as a too simplified model of a real accelerating universe .",
    "the quantum cosmology of this model is also studied by obtaining the wheeler - dewitt equation and finding its solutions .",
    "it is then shown that a good correspondence exists between the classical and quantum cosmological solutions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section * 2 * , we introduce the model by taking a higher dimensional robertson - walker type metric and a higher dimensional matter whose non - zero part is a four - dimensional exotic matter . in section * 3 * , we obtain the einstein equations for the two scale factors . in section * 4 * , we solve the einstein equations and obtain the solutions . in section * 5 * , we derive the wheeler - dewitt equation , and in section * 6 * , the exact solutions of the wheeler - dewitt equation is obtained .",
    "finally , in section * 7 * , we show a good correspondence between the classical and quantum cosmology .",
    "the paper is ended with a conclusion .",
    "we start with the metric considered in @xcite , in which the space - time is assumed to be of robertson - walker type having an internal space with dimension @xmath3 .",
    "we adopt a real chart @xmath15 with @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 denoting the time , space coordinates and internal space dimensions , respectively .",
    "we , therefore , take instead of taking @xmath19 . ]",
    "@xmath20 where @xmath21 is the lapse function , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the scale factor of the universe and the radius of internal space , respectively ; @xmath24 , and @xmath25 .",
    "we assume the internal space to be flat with compact topology @xmath26 , which means @xmath27 .",
    "this assumption is motivated by the possibility of the compact spaces to be flat or hyperbolic in `` _ accelerating cosmologies from compactification _ '' scenarios , as discussed above .",
    "the form of energy - momentum tensor is dictated by einstein s equations and by the symmetries of the metric ( [ 1 ] ) .",
    "therefore , we may assume @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 run over both the space - time coordinates and the internal space dimensions .",
    "now , we examine the case for which the pressure along all the extra dimensions vanishes , @xmath31 . in so doing , we are motivated by the _",
    "brane world _",
    "scenarios where the matter is to be confined to the 4-dimensional universe , so that all components of @xmath32 is set to zero but the space - time components and it means no matter escapes through the extra dimensions .",
    "we assume the energy - momentum tensor @xmath33 of space - time to be an exotic @xmath34 fluid with the equation of state @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the pressure and density of the fluid , respectively and the parameter @xmath9 is restricted to the range @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that the equation of state ( [ 4 ] ) with @xmath38 resembles a universe with negative pressure matter , violating the strong energy condition @xcite and this violation is required for a universe to be accelerated .",
    "using standard techniques we obtain the scalar curvature corresponding to the metric ( [ 1 ] ) and then substitute the result into the dimensionally extended einstein - hilbert action ( without higher dimensional cosmological term ) plus a matter term indicating the above mentioned exotic fluid .",
    "this leads to the effective lagrangian ] @xmath39 where a dot represents differentiation w.r.t @xmath16 .",
    "we now take a closed @xmath40 universe .",
    "it is easily shown that substituting the equation of state ( [ 4 ] ) into the continuity equation together with @xmath41 which gives rise to @xmath42 @xmath43 leads to the following behavior of the energy density in a closed ( @xmath44 ) friedmann - robertson - walker universe @xcite @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the value of the scale factor at an arbitrary reference time @xmath47 .",
    "now , we may define the cosmological term @xcite @xmath48 which leads to @xmath49 where the cosmological term is now decaying with the scale factor@xmath2 as @xmath50 note that @xmath5 is now playing the role of an evolving dark energy @xcite in 4-dimensions , because we did not consider explicitly a @xmath0 dimensional cosmological term in the action , and @xmath5 appears merely due to the specific choice of the equation of state ( [ 4 ] ) for the exotic matter .",
    "the decaying @xmath5 term may also explain the smallness of the present value of the cosmological constant since as the universe evolves from its small to large sizes the large initial value of @xmath5 decays to small values .    of particular interest , to the present paper , among the different values of @xmath9",
    "is @xmath10 which has some interesting implications in reconciling observations with inflationary models @xcite , and is consistent with quantum tunnelling @xcite .",
    "we take @xmath10 and set the initial values of @xmath46 and @xmath51 @xmath52 leading to a positive cosmological term which , according to ( [ 8 ] ) , guarantees the weak energy condition @xmath53 .",
    "the lapse function @xmath21 , in principle , is also an arbitrary function of time due to the reparametrization invariance of the action .",
    "we , therefore , take the gauge @xmath54 now , the lagrangian becomes @xmath55 where eq.([11 ] ) has been used .",
    "it is seen that the parameters @xmath56 and @xmath5 are effectively removed from the lagrangian and this implies that although @xmath56 and @xmath5 are not zero in this model the corresponding 4-dimensional universe is equivalent to a flat universe with a zero cosmological term . in other words , we do not distinguish between our familiar 4-dimensional universe , which seems to be flat and without any exotic fluid , and a closed universe filled with an exotic fluid .",
    "+ we now define the new variables @xmath57 the lagrangian ( [ 13 ] ) is written as @xmath58 the equations of motion are obtained @xmath59 @xmath60 combining the equations ( [ 16 ] ) and ( [ 17 ] ) we obtain @xmath61 @xmath62",
    "the solutions for @xmath22 and @xmath23 are as follows @xmath63 @xmath64 where the constants @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 should be obtained , in principle , in terms of the initial conditions .",
    "it is a reasonable assumption that the size of all spatial dimensions be the same at @xmath67 .",
    "moreover , it may be assumed that this size would be the planck size @xmath68 in accordance with quantum cosmological considerations .",
    "therefore , we take @xmath69 so that @xmath70 , and @xmath71 @xmath72 it is important to note that the constants @xmath73 are not independent , and a relation may be obtained between them .",
    "this is done by imposing the zero energy condition @xmath74 which is the well - known result in cosmology as a _ time reparametrization invariant _ theory .",
    "the hamiltonian constraint is obtained through the legender transformation of the lagrangian ( [ 15 ] ) @xmath75 which is written in terms of @xmath65 and @xmath66 as @xmath76 this constraint is satisfied only for @xmath77 or @xmath78 .    for @xmath79 , the case @xmath80 or @xmath81 gives rise to time independent scale factors , namely @xmath82 , which is not physically viable .",
    "we , therefore , choose @xmath83 so that the universe and the internal space would expand and contract , respectively , in accordance with the present observations .    for the case @xmath84 , we find @xmath85 the former is not physically viable , since it predicts no time evolution for the universe .",
    "the latter , however , may predict exponential expansion for @xmath22 , and exponential contraction for @xmath23 , both with the same exponent @xmath86 .    for the general case @xmath87 , we find @xmath88 , \\label{27}\\ ] ] which gives two positive values for @xmath65 indicating two possible expanding universes provided @xmath89 which indicates the compactification of extra dimensions . moreover , the values of @xmath90 , for a given negative value of @xmath66 , become larger for higher dimensions .",
    "therefore , the universe expands more rapidly in both possibilities . on the contrary , for a given positive value of @xmath65 , indicating an expanding universe , the parameter @xmath66 may take two negative values @xmath91^{-1},\\ ] ] indicating two ways of compactification .",
    "moreover , they become smaller for higher dimensions , exhibiting lower rates of compactification .    to find the constants",
    "@xmath73 we first obtain the hubble parameter for @xmath22 @xmath92 by which the constant @xmath65 is fixed .",
    "the observed positive value of @xmath93 will then justify our previous assumption , @xmath86 .",
    "we may , therefore , write the solutions ( [ 22 ] ) and ( [ 23 ] ) in terms of the hubble parameter @xmath93 as @xmath94 @xmath95 for @xmath84 , and @xmath96 @xmath97^{-1 } } , \\label{32}\\ ] ] and @xmath98 } , \\label{0}\\ ] ] @xmath99 for @xmath87 .    for a given @xmath100 , it is seen that the solution corresponding to @xmath84 may predict an accelerating ( de sitter ) universe and a contracting internal space with exactly the same rates . for @xmath87 , in eqs.([31 ] ) and ( [ 32 ] ) , for a given @xmath100 in the exponent of @xmath22 the exponent in @xmath23 takes two negative values and becomes smaller for higher dimensions .",
    "this means that while the 4-dimensional ( de sitter ) universe is expanding by the rate @xmath93 , the higher dimensions may be compactified in two possible ways with different rates of compactification as a function of dimension , @xmath3 . in eqs.([0 ] ) and ( [ 00 ] ) , on the other hand , for a given @xmath89 the exponent in @xmath22 takes two positive values which become larger for higher dimensions .",
    "this also means that while the extra dimensions contract by the rate @xmath66 , the universe may be expanded in two possible ways with different expansion rates as a function of @xmath3 .",
    "it is easy to show that the lagrangian ( [ 15 ] ) ( or the equations of motion ) is invariant under the simultaneous transformation @xmath101 which is consistent with the time reversal @xmath102 .",
    "therefore , four different phases of `` _ expansion - contraction _ '' for @xmath22 and @xmath23 are distinguished , eqs.([31 ] ) - ( [ 00 ] ) .",
    "one may prefer the `` _ expanding @xmath22 - contracting @xmath23 _ '' phase to `` _ expanding @xmath23 - contracting @xmath22 _ '' one , considering the present status of the 4d universe .",
    ", both the lagrangian ( [ 15 ] ) and the hamiltonian constraint ( [ 24 ] ) are invariant under the transformation @xmath103 therefore , we have a dynamical symmetry between @xmath2 and @xmath1 , namely @xmath104 in this case there is no real line of demarcation between @xmath1 and @xmath2 to single out one of them as the real scale factor of the universe .",
    "this is because the internal space is flat @xmath105 and according to ( [ 13 ] ) one may assume the 4d universe with @xmath106 to be equivalent to the one in which @xmath107 .",

    "therefore , this negative value seems to favor a cosmic acceleration in the expansion of the universe .",
    "in the expansion phase of the closed ( @xmath44 ) universe the cosmological term @xmath5 decays exponentially with time @xmath16 as @xmath112 whereas in the contraction phase ( @xmath113 ) it grows exponentially to large values so that at @xmath67 it becomes extremely large , of the order of @xmath114 .",

    "one of the most interesting topics in the context of quantum cosmology is the mechanisms through which classical cosmology may emerge from quantum cosmology .",
    "when does a wheeler - dewitt wave function predict a classical space - time ?",
    "hartle has put forward a simple rule for applying quantum mechanics to a single system ( universe ) : _ if the wave function is sufficiently peaked about some region in the configuration space we predict to observe a correlation between the observables which characterize this region . _    in this regards , we first take @xmath84 and look for a correspondence between classical and quantum solutions . using eqs.([30 ] ) and ( [ 30  ] ) in the planck units , the corresponding classical locus in @xmath152 configuration space , is @xmath153 whereas in @xmath125 coordinates we have @xmath154 we now consider the wave functions ( [ 50 ] ) in @xmath125 mini - superspace for @xmath84 @xmath155 @xmath156 the above wave functions , in their present form , are not square integrable as is required for the wave functions to predict the classical limit .",

    "now , following hartle s point of view , we try to make correspondence between the classical loci and the wave functions .",
    "figures 1 , 2 , and 3 show respectively the 2d plots of the typical wave functions @xmath164 , @xmath165 and @xmath166 in terms of @xmath125 for @xmath167 ; figures 13 , 14 , and 15 show the corresponding 3d plots , respectively . on the other hand ,",
    "figures 7 , 8 , and 9 show the classical loci ( [ 52 ] ) for @xmath84 , ( [ 58 ] ) for @xmath168 and @xmath169 , respectively .",
    "it is seen that the 2d and 3d plots of the wave functions @xmath164 , @xmath165 and @xmath166 are exactly peaked on the classical loci .    in the same way ,",
    "figures 4 , 5 , and 6 show respectively the 2d plots of the wave functions @xmath170 , @xmath171 and @xmath172 .",
    "figures 16 , 17 , and 18 show the corresponding 3d plots , respectively .",
    "figures 10 , 11 , and 12 show the classical loci ( [ 59 ] ) for @xmath168 , @xmath173 and @xmath169 , respectively .",
    "it is seen again an exact correspondence between the 2d and 3d plots of the wave functions @xmath170 , @xmath171 , @xmath172 and the classical loci .",
    "this procedure applies for all @xmath3 .",
    "in this paper , we have studied a @xmath0-dimensional kaluza - klein cosmology with two scale factors , @xmath2 for the universe and @xmath1 for the higher dimensional space . by introducing a typical exotic matter in 4-dimensions , resulting in a decaying cosmological term",
    ", we obtain exponential solutions for @xmath2 and @xmath1 in terms of the hubble parameter , indicating the accelerating expansion of the universe and dynamical compactification of extra dimensions , respectively . the rate of compactification is shown to be dependent on the number of extra dimensions , @xmath3 . the more extra dimensions , the less rate of compactification .",
    "it is worth noting that the model is free of initial singularity problem because both @xmath2 and @xmath1 are non - zero at @xmath67 , resulting in a finite ricci scalar .    the model , although describes in principle a closed universe with non - vanishing cosmological constant , but is equivalent to a flat universe with zero cosmological constant .",
    "therefore , one may assume that we are really living in a closed universe with @xmath174 , but it effectively appears as a flat universe with @xmath175 .",
    "note that we have not considered ordinary matter sources in the model except an exotic matter source which is to be considered as a source of dark energy .",
    "therefore , it seems the solutions to describe typical inflation rather than the recently observed acceleration of the universe which is known to take place in an ordinary matter dominated universe .",
    "however , if the large percent of the matter sources in the universe would be of dark energy type ( as the present observations strongly recommend ) , then one may keep the results here even in the presence of other matter source , keeping in mind that the relevant contribution to the total matter source of the universe is the dark energy .",
    "a question may arise on the fact that no physics is supposed to exist below the planck length whereas for the contracting solution , the scale factor @xmath23 goes to zero starting from @xmath68 .",
    "however , it is not a major problem because we have not considered elements of quantum gravity theory in this model and merely studied a model based on general relativity which is supposed to be valid in any scale without limitation .",
    "the scale @xmath68 , in this paper , is not introduced within a quantum gravity model ( action ) ; it just appears as a typical initial condition , in the middle of a classical model , based on the quantum cosmological consideration .",
    "one may choose another scale based on some other physical considerations .",
    "we have also studied the corresponding quantum cosmology and obtained the exact solutions .",
    "we have shown a good correspondence between the classical and quantum cosmological solutions for any @xmath3 , provided that the wave functions vanish for the infinite scale factors .",
    "there is no such a correspondence if another boundary condition , other than stated , is taken .",
