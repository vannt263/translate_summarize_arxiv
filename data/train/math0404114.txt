    "by the classical contributions of franel and landau ( @xcite , @xcite , see also @xcite ) , the existence of zero - free regions @xmath0 for the riemann zeta function - and in particular the riemann hypothesis - are known to be equivalent to quantitative statements about the uniform distribution of farey fractions .",
    "although these problems remain widely open , the study of the distribution of farey fractions is of independent interest .",
    "ideas and techniques from this area , especially weil - sali ' e type estimates on kloosterman sums , turned out to be useful in proving sharp asymptotic formulas in problems from various areas of mathematics ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .    the statistics of the spacings between the elements of a ( scaled ) sequence of real numbers can be expressed in the convergence of certain measures , called consecutive spacing measures and respectively correlation measures .",
    "the first ones reflect the distribution of consecutive tuples of elements .",
    "correlations measure the distribution between all tuples of elements and do not require the ordering of the numbers .",
    "there are very few sequences of interest for which one could establish the existence of correlation measures and many of them are conditional , as in the important case of the zeros of the riemann zeta function , or more general @xmath1-functions ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . in this note",
    "we study the correlations of the sequence @xmath2 of farey fractions of order @xmath3 in @xmath4 $ ] as @xmath5 .",

    "this complements previous results ( @xcite , @xcite ) concerning the existence and computation of consecutive spacing measures between farey fractions and gives a complete description of their spacing statistics .",

    "moreover , for any box @xmath34 ,",
    "@xmath35    \\(i ) for such a compact box @xmath36 , @xmath37 is a compact set that does not contain the origin . since @xmath38 for all @xmath39 , all denominators in are greater or equal than @xmath40 ; thus the sum in has finitely many nonzero terms .",

    "[ t2 ] the pair correlation function of @xmath33 is given by @xmath46 moreover , as @xmath47 , @xmath48    the shape of the graph of @xmath49 shows some similarity with the pair correlation function @xmath50 .",
    "both distributions show repulsion between the elements of the sequence .",
    "the strongest one occurs for @xmath49 and is reflected by the vanishing of @xmath49 on the whole interval @xmath51 $ ] .    for a random ( poisson , uncorrelated ) sequence of points ,",
    "the pair correlation function @xmath52 is identically equal to @xmath40 on @xmath53 . as @xmath47 , both pair correlation functions @xmath49 and @xmath54 approach @xmath40 .    , @xmath54 , and @xmath52 .",
    "it is well - known that the cardinality of @xmath2 is @xmath55 an application of the korobov - vinogradov exponential sum estimates gives the better estimate ( see @xcite ) @xmath56    if @xmath57 and @xmath58 are two distinct elements in @xmath2 , then @xmath59 .",
