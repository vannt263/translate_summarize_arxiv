    "as is well known , for the flipped sign solution of @xmath7 ( dark band ) the characteristic features of the fb asymmetry change dramatically : @xmath175 is positive for small _ and _ large values of @xmath19 , and there is no asymmetry zero in the spectrum .    the mfv prediction for the isospin asymmetry , shown in fig .",
    "[ isosusy ] , also splits into two bands , according to the sign of @xmath7 . because the isospin asymmetry is dominated by the penguin coefficients",

    ", a measurement of a large isospin asymmetry at moderate values of @xmath19 would point to physics beyond both , the sm and mfv .",
    "as we have seen in the previous section , in mfv the main effect on the fb and isospin asymmetry is due to a possible sign flip in the value of @xmath7 . taking the central value of the experimental measurement of the isospin asymmetry in @xmath176 at face value , one",

    ", the size of the corresponding wilson coefficients is already constrained from many sources , for instance non - leptonic @xmath1 decays , life - time differences of @xmath1  mesons , kaon decays etc .",
    "since the sensitivity to individual wilson coefficients in these decays is not very high , and considering the possibility of some conspiracy between different new physics effects one may , however , still allow for sizeable deviations of @xmath120 from their sm values .",

    "* the semi - leptonic operators @xmath186 are relevant for @xmath137 at not too small values of @xmath19 .",
    "as already stated above the fb asymmetry provides a rather clean test of the wilson coefficients @xmath174 ( compared to this the isospin asymmetry is less sensitive to @xmath13 and @xmath160 , unless the experimental measurement leads to an unexpectedly large asymmetry for @xmath187  gev@xmath188  gev@xmath21 . ) in particular , when nlo qcd effects are included the wilson coefficient @xmath13 can be measured with 10% accuracy from the fb asymmetry zero @xcite ( provided the relative signs of @xmath189 are sm - like ) .",

    "( for the fb asymmetry we used the results from @xcite ; for the isospin asymmetry we generalized the @xmath178 analysis performed in @xcite . )",
    "the two asymmetries turn out to give complementary tests of the wilson coefficients in the weak effective hamiltonian : for a given value ( and sign ) of @xmath190 , the fb  asymmetry is sensitive to the semi - leptonic coefficients @xmath13 and @xmath160 . on the other hand",
    "the isospin asymmetry is dominated by the effects of four - quark coefficients @xmath191 and @xmath192 at small or medium values of @xmath19 .    to illustrate possible new physics effects we considered an explicit model , namely minimal supersymmetry with minimal flavor violation . in this scenario",
    "the main deviation from the sm is the possibility to generate another sign for the magnetic penguin coefficients @xmath7 , @xmath31 ( while the absolute value for @xmath7 is constrained by the @xmath2 measurement ) .",
    "the corresponding two regions of allowed parameter sets translate into two well separated bands of predictions for the fb and isospin - asymmetry . on the other hand ,",
    "the change in the remaining wilson coefficients is rather small in the mfv scenario and indistinguishable from hadronic uncertainties of the theoretical calculation .",
    "considering an alternative point of view and assuming the sm to be a valid approximation in rare @xmath1 decays , the simultaneous study of the isospin asymmetry and the forward - backward asymmetry in the large - recoil region ( @xmath193 ) provides a perfect testing ground for the qcd factorization approach .",

    "<S> we discuss two dedicated observables in exclusive @xmath0 decay that can be used to study effects of physics beyond the standard model , namely the forward - backward asymmetry in the lepton spectrum and the isospin - asymmetry between decays of charged and neutral @xmath1  mesons . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the region of large recoil - energy ( i.e.small invariant mass of the lepton pair ) , and employ the qcd factorization approach to exclusive @xmath1  meson decays . </S>",
    "<S> sub - leading effects in the heavy quark mass expansion have been taken into account for the calculation of the isospin - asymmetry . </S>",
    "<S> we give predictions for decay asymmetries in the standard model , and its supersymmetric extension with minimal flavor violation , using parameter values allowed by current experimental constraints on @xmath2 decay .    </S>",
