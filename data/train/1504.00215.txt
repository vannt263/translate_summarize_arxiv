    "quantum teleportation ( qt for short ) is the first quantum information processing protocol presented by bennett _",
    "@xcite to achieve the transmission of information contained in quantum state determinately .",
    "many theoretical schemes have been proposed later @xcite .",
    "it has also been realized experimentally @xcite .",
    "latter , to save resource needed in the process of information transmission , lo put forward a scheme for remote preparation of quantum state ( rsp for short ) @xcite . compared with qt , in rsp the sender does not own the particle itself but owns all the classical information of the state he or she wants to prepare for the receiver , who is located separately from the sender . the resource consumption is reduced greatly in rsp , as the sender do not need to prepare the state beforehand .",
    "the rsp has already attracted many attentions .",
    "a number of rsp protocols were presented , such as rsp with or without oblivious conditions , optimal rsp , rsp using noisy channel , low - entanglement rsp , continuous variable rsp and so on @xcite .",
    "experimental realization was also proved @xcite .    in rsp protocols ,",
    "all the classical information is distributed to one sender , which may lead to information leakage if the sender is not honest . in order to improve the security of remote state preparation ,",
    "controllers are introduced , which is the so called controlled remote state preparation ( crsp for short ) , and it has drawn the attention of many researchers .",
    "in contrast to the usual rsp , the crsp needs to incorporate a controller .",
    "the information could be transmitted if and only if both the sender and receiver cooperate with the controller or supervisor .",
    "crsp for an arbitrary qubit has been presented in a network via many agents @xcite . a two - qubit state crsp with multi - controllers using two non - maximally ghz states as shared channel is shown in @xcite .",
    "crsp with two receivers via asymmetric channel @xcite , using povm are presented @xcite .",
    "the five - qubit brown state as quantum channel to realize the crsp of three - qubit state is elaborated in @xcite .",
    "most of the existing schemes chose to use the ghz - type state , w - type state , bell state or the composite of these states as the shared quantum channel . however in this paper , we choose the general pure three - qubit state as quantum channel , which is not locc equivalent to the ghz state . and",
    "for some special cases , the probability for successful crsp can reach unit .    in @xcite , the authors proved that for any pure three - qubit state , the existence of local base , which allows one to express a pure three - qubit state in a unique form using a set of five orthogonal state .",
    "it is the called generalised schmidt - decomposition for three - qubit state . using the generalised schmidt - decomposition , gao _ et al . _",
    "@xcite proposed a controlled teleportation protocol for an unknown qubit and gave analytic expressions for the maximal successful probabilities .",
    "they also gave an explicit expression for the pure three - qubit state with unit probability of controlled teleportation @xcite .",
    "motivated by the ideas of the two papers , we try to investigate the controlled remote state preparation using the general pure three - qubit states and their generalised schmidt - decomposition .",
    "the paper is arranged as follows . in sec .",
    "2 , the crsp for an arbitrary qubit is elucidated in detail .",
    "we find that the successful probability is the same as that of controlled teleportation for qubits with real coefficients . in sec . 3 , the crsp for a general two - qubit state is expounded . for two - qubit state with four real coefficients .",
    "the corresponding successful probability is the same as that of controlled teleportation of a qubit . in sec . 4",
