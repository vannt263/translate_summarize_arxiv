    "after a decade of detector installation and commissioning , ground - based detectors looking for gravitational waves ( gws ) have reached or surpassed their design sensitivities and are poised to open up a new window onto the universe , as well as allowing coincident searches with electromagnetic or neutrino detectors .",
    "the first generation of interferometric observatories ( geo @xcite , ligo @xcite and virgo @xcite ) have already put interesting constraints , for example , on the ellipticity of the crab pulsar @xcite and on the cosmological stochastic background @xcite . with the second generation starting in a few years",
    ", one expects to detect compact binary coalescences in the local universe @xcite , while third generation detectors , such as the einstein telescope @xcite , should take gw astronomy to a new level , due to the large numbers of high snrs of detectable sources , making it possible to address a range of problems on a wide variety of astrophysical sources but also in fundamental physics and cosmology .",
    "the coalescence of two neutron stars ( bns ) , two black holes ( bbh ) or a neutron star and a black hole ( ns - bh ) , are the most promising sources for terrestrial detectors , due to the huge amount of energy emitted in the last phase of their inspiral trajectory , merger , and ringdown .",
    "the maximum distance probed with current detectors is about 30mpc @xcite for bns , but the next generation of detectors should be taking data with a sensitivity approximately 10 times greater , pushing the horizon up to about 450mpc @xcite . with the third generation einstein telescope , the sensitivity will be increased by another order of magnitude and the horizon of compact binaries is expected to reach cosmological distances @xcite . among other things , this will allow for a detailed study of the evolution of binary coalescences over redshift @xcite , measurement of the mass function of neutron stars and black holes and of the neutron star equation of state @xcite , and the use of binary neutron stars and neutron star - black hole binaries as standard sirens to constrain dark energy and its time evolution @xcite ( for a summary of et science objectives see ref .",
    "in such a large volume , however , the number of sources can be as large as a million and the waveforms may overlap to create a confusion foreground , especially at low frequencies where the signal can last for several days @xcite .",
    "this could affect our ability to make individual detections and perform parameter estimation , and the issue deserves thorough study .    with this in mind , we have simulated einstein telescope detector noise and added signals from a population of compact binaries , with a view to issuing a mock data challenge ( mdc ) to the gravitational - wave community .",
    "this could be used to develop advanced data analysis methods in order to separate the sources and measure the properties of both individual sources and of the catalog as a whole .",
    "initially we used a simple bns inspiral signal model , but work is in progress to include other types of sources and more sophisticated scenarios . in the longer term",
    "we envisage issuing _ et science challenges _ to encompass not only detection of signals and parameter estimation , but also the application of such results to outstanding problems in fundamental physics , astrophysics and cosmology .",
    "in section 2 , we present the einstein telescope ; in section 3 we describe our procedure to simulate the mock data ; in section 4 we present the results of the search for both individual sources and the integrated signal ; in section 5 we discuss future developments for the mock data and in the search methods ; finally in section 6 we draw our conclusions .",
    "0.1    [ fig - et ]    a conceptual design study was recently concluded for the proposed european project , the _ einstein gravitational wave telescope _ ( et )  @xcite .",
    "the goal of the study was to explore the technological challenges and the scientific benefits of building a third generation gravitational wave detector that is a factor 10 better than advanced detectors but also capable of observing at frequencies down to 13hz @xcite . in this section",
    "we will discuss the optical configuration of et , different design choices for its sensitivity and et s response to gravitational waves and its distance reach to compact binary coalescences .",
    "consideration of many factors including continuous observation ( duty cycle ) , ability to resolve the two polarizations of gw , and capacity to support new designs over many decades , led to the conclusion that the infrastructures housing the current detectors will be inadequate to meet the design goals of et .",
    "the einstein telescope is envisioned to consist of three v - shaped michelson interferometers with 60 degree opening angles , arranged in a triangle configuration ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - et ] , left panel ) .",
    "these are to be placed underground to reduce the influence of seismic noise .",
    "the design goal to push the sensitivity floor at low frequency down to 13hz comes from the requirement that et be sensitive to more massive coalescing binaries than advanced detectors , _",
    "i.e. _  intermediate mass bbh of masses in the range @xmath1@xmath2 @xcite , but also be able to observe stellar mass binaries for far longer periods before they merge . with better low - frequency sensitivity",
    ", the subtle secular general - relativistic effects that occur in strong gravitational fields will accumulate over longer periods , as shown in eq .",
    ", facilitating a deeper understanding of gw sources . additionally , in the case of binaries where one or both components is a neutron star , the improved low - frequency sensitivity will allow the source s redshift to be measured @xcite , by breaking the degeneracy between the redshifted mass measured from the pn phase and the rest - frame mass measured from the ns tidal deformation phase . in @xcite a lower frequency cutoff of 10hz",
    "was used ; if this cutoff is reduced to 3hz , improving the accuracy of parameter estimation , the errors on recovered redshift are reduced by tens of percent , up to nearly a factor 2 improvement for sources at redshift 4 @xcite .    as the understanding of the achievable sensitivity for einstein telescope evolved during the design study , different sensitivity curves were considered . early in the study",
    "the possibility was envisaged of pushing the low frequency limit down to 13hz in a single interferometer , while still achieving a broad - band improvement of an order of magnitude in sensitivity over advanced detectors @xcite . however , this is highly challenging , and perhaps technically unfeasible , since the technology that achieves better high frequency ( @xmath3hz ) sensitivity , _",
    "i.e. _  higher laser power to bring down the photon shot noise , is in direct conflict with that required to improve low frequency ( @xmath4hz ) sensitivity , _",
    "i.e. _  lower thermal noise and radiation pressure noise , since these are both worsened by higher laser power .",
    "another design subsequently considered is the so - called _ xylophone _ configuration @xcite .",
    "the idea is to install two interferometers in each v of the triangle , one that has good high - frequency sensitivity and the other with good low - frequency sensitivity @xcite .",
    "several other new technologies , for instance frequency - dependent squeezing of light , have been studied in detail for the et design  @xcite and must be combined to achieve the sensitivity goals of third generation detectors @xcite .",
    "the main design parameters for et to achieve a factor 10 improved sensitivity over advanced detectors , while also achieving good sensitivity in the 310hz region , are as follows : 10 km arm lengths , 500w of input laser and 3mw of arm cavity power for the high frequency interferometer , and 3w of input laser and 18kw of arm cavity power and the use of cryogenic technology ( mirrors cooled to 10k ) , for the low frequency interferometer @xcite .",
    "[ fig - et ] , right panel , compares the sensitivity of the initial single - interferometer configuration ( et - b ) @xcite with the xylophone configuration ( et - d ) @xcite which was the latest and most evolved design . also plotted for comparison",

    "let us begin by looking at et s response to gw signals . far away from a source ,",
    "gravitational waves emitted by a system can be expressed in a suitable coordinate system as a transverse and symmetric trace - free ( stf ) tensor @xmath5 ( all temporal components of the metric perturbation vanish ) whose only non - zero spatial components are @xmath6 let @xmath7 be an orthonormal triad in which the metric perturbation takes the transverse - traceless form .",
    "then , using basis polarization tensors defined as @xmath8 the metric perturbation can be written as @xmath9 et s interferometers can also be represented as stf tensors : @xmath10 where @xmath11 @xmath12 and @xmath13 are unit vectors along the three arms of et .",
    "the response @xmath14 @xmath15 of the interferometers to an incident gravitational wave is just the inner product of the detector tensor @xmath16 with the wave tensor @xmath17 : @xmath18 which motivates definition of the antenna pattern functions @xmath19 and @xmath20 @xmath21 in terms of which the response can be written as @xmath22    let us now choose a coordinate system fixed to et such that the three arms of et s triangle are in the @xmath23-plane and the unit vectors along the arms are @xmath24 let @xmath25 be the direction to the source in this coordinate system with @xmath26 denoting directions of increasing @xmath27 and @xmath28 respectively .",
    "the unit vectors @xmath29 @xmath30 and @xmath31 defining the radiation frame can be obtained by successive counterclockwise rotations about the @xmath32-axis by an angle @xmath33 , about the new @xmath34-axis by an angle @xmath27 and the final @xmath32-axis by an angle @xmath35 :    @xmath36    where @xmath35 is the polarization angle defined by @xmath37 the antenna pattern functions of the interferometer whose arms are @xmath38 is : @xmath39 ,         \\label{eq : f1p } \\\\ f^1_\\times & = &   + \\frac{\\sqrt{3 } } { 4}\\bigl [ ( 1+\\cos^2\\theta ) \\ , \\sin 2\\varphi\\ , \\sin 2\\psi          -   2\\ , \\cos\\theta\\,\\cos2\\varphi\\,\\cos 2\\psi \\bigr ] .",
    "\\label{eq : f1c}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the antenna pattern functions are a factor @xmath40 smaller than that of an l - shaped detector of the same length , where @xmath41 is the opening angle of et s interferometer arms .    the antenna pattern functions of the other two detectors in et , with arms @xmath42 and @xmath43 , are obtained from @xmath44 and @xmath45 by the transformation @xmath46",
    "@xmath47 @xmath19 and @xmath48 are sometimes called antenna _ amplitude _ pattern functions to distinguish them from their squares ( @xmath49 and @xmath50 which are called antenna _ power _ pattern functions @xcite .",
    "the overall response of an interferometer to an incident wave depends on the square root of the sum of the antenna power pattern functions @xmath51 the joint response of all the three detectors in the et network is @xmath52 which can be shown to be equal to @xmath53 thus , the joint antenna power pattern depends only on the colatitude @xmath27 of the source .",
    "et s response is smaller compared to an l - shaped interferometer by a factor @xmath54 due to the @xmath55 opening angle , but its 3 detectors enhance its response by @xmath56 , leading to an overall factor of @xmath57 .",
    "this is indeed what we find : @xmath58 .",
    "the response averaged over @xmath27 is @xmath59 and its minimum value is @xmath60 with an average response 63% of its optimum and a worst response 35% of its optimum , and with no null directions , et has virtually all - sky coverage .",
    "it follows immediately from eqs.([eq : det_tensors ] ) , ( [ eq : response ] ) that the sum of the individual responses @xmath61 is identically equal to zero .",
    "the sum of the responses of any set of michelson interferometers forming a closed path is zero and is called the _ null stream_. as we shall discuss later , such a null stream is an invaluable tool in data analysis .",
    "two l - shaped detectors with arm lengths of 7.5 km ( and total length of 30 km ) , rotated relative to each other by an angle @xmath62 , are completely equivalent to et in terms of their response and resolvability of polarizations .",
    "however , their response can not be used to construct a null stream .      in 1986",
    "schutz showed @xcite that inspiralling binary systems are standard candles whose ( luminosity ) distance can be measured from the observed gravitational wave signal , without the need to calibrate sources at different distances .",
    "our detectors are able to measure both the apparent and absolute luminosity of the radiation , and hence to extract the luminosity distance of such a source : the magnitude of the gravitational wave strain gives the apparent luminosity but the rate at which the signal s frequency changes gives the absolute luminosity .",
    "for simplicity we shall consider a binary that is located at an optimal position on the sky ( overhead with respect to the plane of et ) and optimally oriented ( i.e.  its angular momentum is along the line of sight ) .",
    "the discussion below holds good even when these assumptions are dropped , but the measurement of the various angular parameters would be essential in order to disentangle the distance .",
    "this would require a network of three or more detectors with long baselines to triangulate the source s position on the sky .",
    "we will also only consider the gw quadrupole amplitude in this discussion ; higher - order corrections to the amplitude do not affect our conclusions on et s distance reach .",
    "the magnitude of the strain measured by our detectors when the signal frequency reaches the value @xmath63 is @xmath64 , \\label{eq : amp}\\ ] ] where @xmath65 is the speed of light , @xmath66 the gravitational constant , @xmath67 is the chirp mass of the binary , related to its total mass @xmath68 and symmetric mass ratio @xmath69 by @xmath70 , and @xmath71 is the proper distance to the source .",
    "note that this expression is valid in the limit of asymptotically flat , static spacetime ; we will soon discuss the effect of cosmological expansion on the observed signal .",
    "in addition to the signal s strain we can also measure the rate at which its frequency changes via @xmath72 thus , measurement of the signal strain and rate of change of frequency can together determine the system s chirp mass and its distance from earth .    for cosmological sources ,",
    "however , the distance recovered by this method is not the comoving distance to the source @xmath73 ( equivalent to @xmath71 for a spatially flat frw universe ) , but rather its luminosity distance @xmath74 .",
    "this may be explained as follows : due to time dilation , the chirp mass of the system inferred from eq .",
    "( [ eq : fdot ] ) will be  redshifted \" by a factor @xmath75 , thus the signal will appear to have come from a source whose chirp mass is @xmath76 .",
    "thus , if we reconstruct the masses of the binary from the frequency evolution of the waveform , we will obtain redshifted masses a factor @xmath75 larger than the physical masses of the system at redshift @xmath32 .",
    "symbols such as @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 will denote physical masses , whereas when discussing `` redshifted '' observed mass parameters we will use a superscript @xmath32 , for instance @xmath80 .",
    "this increase in apparent mass does not , however , mean that we will observe a greater signal amplitude : gravitational - wave amplitude , being dimensionless , can not change due to redshift .",
    "given this , and noting that @xmath81 is invariant under the effect of redshift , we find that a source with physical chirp mass @xmath67 will appear to us to have a chirp mass @xmath76 , and its apparent distance will be the luminosity distance @xmath74 , instead of the proper or comoving distance .",
    "let us now consider the distance reach of et to an inspiral signal from a compact binary of component masses @xmath82 and @xmath83 , at a luminosity distance @xmath84 and whose orbit ( assumed here to be quasi - circular ) makes an angle @xmath85 with the line of sight .",
    "there exist different measures of the distance reach of a detector : the _ horizon distance _ is commonly used in data analysis ( see , for instance , @xcite ) , while _ detector range _ and _ range functions _ were defined by finn and chernoff @xcite and are routinely used as a measure of detector performance .",
    "our measures of distance reach are inspired by all of these concepts .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) @xmath86 for a given signal ( such as from an inspiralling binary ) , detected by matched filtering with an optimum filter , in a detector labelled @xmath87 , is @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the fourier transform of the response of detector @xmath87 and @xmath90 is the one - sided noise power spectral density ( psd ) of the detector , which we assume to be the same for all three detectors in the et array .",
    "a good analytical fit @xcite to the et - b noise psd is given by @xmath91 , where @xmath92 and where @xmath93 we may write the detector response in terms of two gw polarizations via @xmath94 , where @xmath95 the coherent snr @xmath96 for the et network , for uncorrelated noises in the three detectors , is simply the quadrature sum of the individual snrs : @xmath97 .",

    "we consider uncorrelated noises .    for low mass systems such as bns , the snr is dominated by the inspiral part of the signal ; the coherent snr can then be shown to reduce to @xmath98 where @xmath99 and @xmath100 are lower and upper frequency cutoffs chosen so that the integral has negligible ( say , @xmath101 ) contribution outside this range and @xmath102 is a function of all the angles given by @xmath103.\\ ] ] here @xmath104 @xmath105 are the antenna pattern functions of the detector given by eqs.([eq : f1p])-([eq : f3 ] ) .",
    "substituting for the antenna pattern functions and summing over the three detectors gives @xmath106 the quantity @xmath107 determines the snr of a source of a given ( observed ) chirp mass at any given distance .",
    "although the antenna power pattern @xmath108 is independent of @xmath109 the quantity @xmath107 is only independent of @xmath110 for certain source locations and orientations , the response is still independent of the polarization angle .",
    "for instance , either when the source is  overhead \" with respect to et s plane ( _ i.e. _  @xmath111 ) or face - on ( _ i.e. _  @xmath112 ) , @xmath107 is independent of @xmath113 it depends weakly on @xmath35 for values of @xmath27 and @xmath85 significantly different from these extreme values .",

    "we neglect the possible production of compact binaries through interactions in dense star systems , and we assume that the final merger of a compact binary occurs after two massive stars in a binary system have collapsed to form neutron stars and have inspiralled through the emission of gravitational waves .",
    "the merger rate tracks the star formation rate ( sfr ) , albeit with some delay @xmath152 from formation of the binary to final merger .",
    "we use the sfr of @xcite , which is derived from new measurements of the galaxy luminosity function in the uv ( sdss , galex , combo17 ) and fir wavelengths ( spitzer space telescope ) , and is normalized by the superkamiokande limit on the electron - antineutrino flux from past core - collapse supernovas .",
    "this model is expected to be quite accurate up to @xmath153 , with very tight constraints at redshifts @xmath154 ( to within @xmath155 ) .",
    "following @xcite , we write the coalescence rate density @xmath156 ( in mpc@xmath157yr@xmath158 ) as : @xmath159 where @xmath160 is the sfr of @xcite ( in m@xmath161mpc@xmath157 yr@xmath158 ) , @xmath32 the redshift when the binary system merges , @xmath162 the redshift when the binary system is formed , @xmath163 the probability distribution of the delay connecting @xmath32 and @xmath162 , and @xmath164 the rate density in our local universe .",

    "although the sources overlap strongly in time , they are well separated in frequency , or become so when close to coalescence : an exception could be if two bns signals with similar redshifted chirp masses were approaching coalescence within @xmath215s of each other . due to the form of the detector psd , the main contribution to the matched filter power of any binary coalescence signal occurs when the chirping frequency is close to @xmath216hz ; the `` chirp '' is sufficiently rapid at ( and after ) this point that different sources can be clearly resolved .",

    "common noise arises most significantly as a result of having end stations with similar physical environments for two detectors : in particular , concerning et s low - frequency sensitivity , seismic and newtonian noise displacements . for et , however , it is envisaged to stagger the end stations of the three interferometers by 1 km .",
    "whether this will reduce the common displacement noises to the extent that the detectors can be considered independent is a question under current investigation .",
    "the noise for each detector was generated using the following procedure : firstly , we generate a gaussian time series with a mean of zero , and unit variance .",
    "these time series are fourier transformed and coloured by the relevant et sensitivity curve in the frequency domain . to get the final time - domain representation of the noise",
    ", we apply an inverse fourier transform .",
    "the noise curve used is based on the analytic fit of eq .",
    "( [ eq : psd ] ) to the et - b psd discussed in section ii . to alleviate the effects of possible discontinuities across frame files ,",
    "the psd is gradually tapered to zero below the low frequency limit @xmath218hz , and above a frequency of @xmath219 . fig .",
    "[ fig - serieset ] , right panel , shows the noise curve used to colour the data , with the tapering applied , for a sample rate of 8192hz .",
    "the taper essentially acts like a bandpass filter and removes power outside the band of interest .",
    "the absence of very high and very low frequencies essentially assures continuity across the data segments @xcite .",
    "a _ null stream _ is a combination of the detector output streams such that the gravitational wave signal is identically zero and only noise remains .",
    "the existence of an et null stream was noted already in  @xcite and is a major motivation for the triangular triple michelson topology . given an incident gw tensor @xmath220 , the three interferometer responses were derived in eq .",
    "( [ eq : response ] ) , from which , as already remarked in section  [ sec : null_introduction ] , we find that the sum of the three detector responses to any gw signal vanishes identically .",
    "we may define the _ null stream _ as the sum of the strain time series @xmath221 for the three et detectors . for each single detector @xmath87",
    "we have @xmath222 where @xmath223 is the noise realization , thus @xmath224 is free of gw signals , and will also not contain any common ( correlated ) noise for which the sum over the three detectors happens to vanish . if the noise properties are homogeneous among the detectors , @xmath225 and if correlations between detectors can be neglected , we can use the null stream to estimate the average psd in each of the three detectors . in this case , @xmath226 where @xmath227 is the fourier transform of @xmath228 and , in the last line , @xmath229 is the noise psd in any of the three interferometers _ in the absence of a gw signal_. defining @xmath230 we find @xmath231 as an estimate for the individual single - interferometer psds with the signals removed .",
    "the null stream psd , which we plot on the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig - nullstreampsd ] , then has the advantage of giving a better representation of the noise content of the three detectors .",
    "the typical sensitivity improvement is nonetheless fairly small , about 1% in the 10  100hz band . as a proof of principle of the effectiveness of the use of null stream psd instead of the single detector one , we computed the median over the whole dataset of the difference between ( one - third of ) the null stream psd and the individual detector psd s @xmath232 .",
    "these residuals should be consistent with the median psd of the injected signals in each detector : @xmath233 where @xmath234 is the power spectral density of gw signals .",
    "the result of this operation is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - nullstreampsd ] , right panel .",
    "the residual spectrum between 10 and 400hz in each detector is consistent with the theoretical expectation @xmath235 .",
    "we analysed the triple coincident simulated data using a modified version of the ligo - virgo ihope pipeline @xcite which is used to search for signals from compact binary coalescences ( cbc ) .",
    "this pipeline is a _ coincident _ analysis : data streams from different detectors are separately filtered against template waveforms and the resulting maxima of snr are checked for consistency between detectors .",
    "the main motivation of this procedure is to reduce computational cost when analyzing data from spatially separated detectors with a - priori unknown duty cycles .",
    "coherent analysis , where data streams are combined before finding maxima of snr , should in principle be more sensitive at fixed false alarm rate if many detectors are involved @xcite . for et , the detector outputs could be combined into a null stream and synthetic @xmath236 and @xmath237 detectors , and for the 2 non - null streams , the coherent detection statistic is then identical to the coincident one @xcite . hence unless other sites contribute there is no gain expected specifically from using a coherent analysis .",
    "in our case we might expect a small gain in sensitivity by using synthetic @xmath236 and @xmath237 data , since it eliminates a fraction of the noise from each detector ( the contribution to the null stream ) while keeping all the signal power .",

    "the stages of the coincident pipeline are as follows :    * estimation of the psd by median over several overlapping time chunks within a 2048s segment .",
    "we use the single - detector outputs rather than the null stream to estimate the noise : in principle loud signals could bias this estimation , however as shown in fig .",

    "the length of an inspiral template increases rapidly with the lowest frequency that is matched filtered in the analysis ( eq .  ) . for technical reasons related to memory load and psd estimation , the standard matched filter code used for lsc - virgo analyses @xcite can not filter templates longer than a few minutes : hence we chose to impose a lower frequency cutoff of 25hz .",
    "this limitation should be addressed in future analyses , and may be relevant to analysis of advanced ligo / virgo data .",
    "the template bank was chosen to cover the possible range of redshifted ( _ i.e. _  observed ) mass pairs corresponding to the bns injections up to redshift 4 .",
    "the minimum component mass was taken as @xmath243 ; with a maximum injected component mass of @xmath138 , the observed total mass at @xmath137 is then @xmath244 , which we took as our maximum component mass , with a maximum total mass of @xmath245 .",
    "the maximum injected mass ratio is @xmath246 corresponding to a `` symmetric mass ratio '' @xmath247 , thus templates with @xmath248 were removed , considerably reducing the size of the bank .    since the simulated noise was gaussian , signal - based vetoes and data quality vetoes were not necessary to suppress detector artefacts , and events",
    "were ranked simply by the quadrature sum of snr over coincident triggers . the noise background in our mock data",
    "is expected to be a function of combined snr alone , thus we set a threshold in the value of @xmath249 above which we consider an event likely to be a true gw signal .",
    "note that the time shift method used to estimate background event rates in ligo - virgo searches fails here . in order for such methods to be valid",
    ", the number of detectable gw events over the search time should be small ( of order 1 ) : otherwise , loud triggers due to true gw signals may significantly distort the background distribution , by forming random time - shifted coincidences with noise triggers . in the present case",
    "we see tens of thousands of detectable signals , thus the distribution of loud time - shifted coincidences is totally dominated by such ` signal - plus - noise ' events .",
    "the cbc analysis outputs a list of loudest events with the coalescence time , combined snr , and the component masses of the best - fitting template for each event .",
    "the distribution over @xmath249 is plotted in figure  [ cbc_events_hist ] for both double- and triple - coincident events .    ,",

    "given the single - detector snr threshold @xmath250 , the quietest possible double coincidence has @xmath251 and the quietest triple has @xmath252 .",
    "the expected cumulative distribution of events from an astrophysical population is approximately proportional to the inverse cube of combined snr ( thus to the cube of the luminosity distance , or to the volume of space seen by the search ) .",
    "deviations from this inverse - cube behaviour will arise due to evolution of the source population over redshift , also because the physical volume of space is no longer exactly proportional to distance@xmath253 at large @xmath32 , and also since the observed masses of a coalescing binary are larger than the physical masses by a factor @xmath75 , changing the expected snrs .",
    "over most of the range of @xmath249 the distribution of triple coincidences is close to @xmath254 as expected ; with decreasing combined snr values , an increasing fraction of signals are seen as double coincidences .",
    "we see no significant background distribution of triples , which would be expected to rise exponentially at small combined snr .",
    "thus in principle the efficiency of the search could be improved by lowering the snr threshold .",
    "the distribution of double coincidences shows two components : an approximate power - law at higher @xmath249 and a more rapidly rising component below about @xmath255 .",
    "we interpret these as a cosmological population of sources , modulated by the variation in the proportion found as doubles vs.  triples ; and a gaussian noise background , respectively .",
    "thus we expect that above a combined snr @xmath256 the great majority of events will be caused by binary coalescence signals rather than random noise .",
    "we evaluate the search efficiency as a function of redshift by testing time coincidence between simulated signals and found events ( using a `` coalescence time '' at which the chirping signal reaches a well - defined frequency ) and choose a time window of @xmath257ms . for a given event or injection",
    "there are the following cases :    * false event : an event which does not fall within 30ms of an injection * true event : an event falling within 30ms of one or more injections * missed injection : a simulated signal which does not fall within 30ms of an event * found injection : an simulated signal within 30ms of a found event .",
    "however , if we have very frequent candidate events or injections , we may encounter significant numbers of _ wrongly found injections _",
    ", meaning chance time coincidences between injections and noise events where the expected snr of the injected signal is below the analysis threshold .",
    "for these we do not expect the estimated mass parameters and effective luminosity distance from the analysis pipeline to correspond to those of the simulated source ; the fractional error in these parameters will be order(1 ) .",
    "wrongly found injections would lead us to overestimate the search efficiency and would degrade the accuracy of recovered source parameters . to minimize such effects whenever two or more simulated signals fall within @xmath258ms of an event , we consider only the injection with the lowest redshift to be found . in practice",
    "this ambiguity is found to affect only a small fraction ( sub - percent ) of signals . in order to minimize possible bias in assessing the accuracy of recovered source parameters",

    "the efficiency of finding injections as a function of redshift is summarized in figure  [ cbc_efficiency ] , top two panels . in the top right plot",
    "we compare the efficiency of the current analysis with the theoretical ideal efficiency defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : efficiency ] ) , for two different values of the threshold snr @xmath130 and the low frequency cutoff @xmath99 .",
    "the ihope analysis does somewhat worse than the corresponding theoretical curve , which can in part be attributed to the single - detector snr threshold @xmath260 ; the theoretical calculation does not impose a lower limit on the amplitude of signals in single detectors contributing coherently to the significance of an event .",
    "we evaluate the accuracy of the recovered ( observed ) chirp mass @xmath209 via the discrepancy @xmath261 plotted in figure  [ cbc_efficiency ] , lower left plot .",

    "the vast majority of events found have a well recovered chirp mass with an accuracy better than 0.5% , even for the small number of sources recovered at redshift @xmath262 : the number of wrongly found injections with violently inaccurate @xmath79 is order(10 ) .",
    "the chirp mass is the chief parameter governing the frequency evolution of a compact binary system due to its emission of energy in gw , thus we can deduce the luminosity in gw of such systems with good accuracy out to extremely large distances .",
    "but note again that we can not determine the system s _ physical _ masses without an independent determination of its redshift .",
    "the distribution of errors in observed total mass @xmath263 is significantly broader : see figure  [ cbc_efficiency ] , lower right plot , where there is a slight overall bias towards overestimating @xmath263 and a small population of injections for which the total mass is overestimated by 510% .",
    "we find that this population consists of nearly equal - mass binaries which are found with somewhat more asymmetrical templates .",
    "since the inspiral signal is significantly less sensitive to changes in mass ratio or total mass keeping a fixed @xmath79 than vice versa , we expect a larger spread in recovered @xmath78 values than in @xmath79 .",
    "we might also expect a bias in the recovered mass parameters due to taking the maximum snr value over some region of the template bank , since the density of templates is greater at smaller @xmath79 and at smaller @xmath264 . the recovered mass ratio is also expected to be more sensitive to systematic differences in injected vs.  template waveforms .      the superposition of the gw signals from our population of bns creates a background which is expected to be isotropic ( the source position in the sky and polarization were selected from a uniform distribution ) and stationary ( the length of the data is much greater than the time interval between successive events , and the duration of the waveform ) .",
    "its properties in the frequency domain can be characterized by the dimensionless energy density parameter @xcite : @xmath265 where @xmath266 is the gravitational energy density and @xmath267 the critical energy density needed to make the universe flat today .",
    "this quantity is related to the one - sided ( @xmath268 ) power spectral density in gravitational waves , at the detector output ( @xmath269 ) : @xmath270 where @xmath271 is the opening angle of the interferometer arms .",
    "note that the background from bns is not gaussian at frequencies @xmath272 hz , in the sense that the number of sources overlapping at a given time is too small for the central limit theorem to apply and for the distribution of the sum of the amplitudes to have a gaussian distribution .",

    "there will also be computational challenges in performing the analysis on hour - long stretches of data .    a conceptually difficult problem , not present in the current set of et mock data , is to identify signals among an unmodelled background of non - gaussian noise transients when the rates of signals and transients may both be large .",
    "as seen in the initial cbc analysis , the method of background estimation via time shifts between detectors is invalid if signals are frequent .",

    "single - detector triggers which fail a coincidence test could also be used to train glitch rejection methods . one way to interpret such methods",

    ", we should see an astrophysical event distribution over the statistic value of predictable form , superimposed on a population of noise transients .",
    "if the noise distribution is sufficiently different from that of signals , ideally decreasing rapidly at high statistic values @xcite , it may be possible to separate the two populations simply by fitting the astrophysical component .",
    "however , such a procedure would depend on the noise event population being sufficiently well understood .      according to various cosmological scenarios ,",

    "the nature of the agb may also differ from its cosmological counterpart , which is expected to be stationary , unpolarized , gaussian and isotropic , by analogy with the cosmic microwave background .",
    "on the one hand , the distribution of galaxies up to 100mpc is not isotropic but strongly concentrated in the direction of the virgo cluster and the great attractor , and on the other hand , depending whether the time interval between events is short compared to the duration of a single event , the integrated signal may result in a continuous , popcorn noise or shot noise background  @xcite .",

    "for example , a binary neutron star starting at 1hz will last for about 5 days and there is no way to filter such long signals with the matched filtering algorithms accessible to us .",
    "it is necessary to explore and develop new search algorithms which do nt require the entire template to be available at once to carry out a search .",

    "we have demonstrated that it is possible to recover the average spectrum of the gw signals by subtracting the `` pure noise '' power spectral density ( psd ) obtained from the null stream , from the psd in each individual detector .",
    "the recovered `` residual '' psd has a power - law character extremely close to the @xmath316 behaviour expected for inspiraling binary systems .",
    "the residual psd can either be used as a diagnosis tool for future mock data challenges and stochastic analyses , or as a research tool complementary to a more traditional stochastic analysis .    the null stream is also expected to be a powerful tool for identifying and vetoing non - gaussian features in the detector outputs ; however , since the current set of et mock data does not include such noise features , this use of the null stream will be a topic for future investigation .",
    "the analysis used to detect coalescing binary signals was similar to current pipelines employed in searching ligo - virgo data , and was able to recover a large fraction of simulated signals at redshifts approaching unity .",
    "some signals were recovered up to redshifts greater than 3 with good ( @xmath101 ) accuracy on chirp mass ( the chief parameter determining the frequency evolution of inspiral signals ) .",
    "overlap between two or more signals only rarely affected the performance of the analysis ; however this could become a more critical issue if the lower frequency cutoff ( taken to be 25hz for the first cbc analysis ) were reduced .",
    "we also searched for the gw background created by the superposition of all the binary inspiral signals up to a redshift of @xmath214 using the standard cross - correlation statistic , considering the frequency range @xmath298hz where the spectrum can be well approximated by a power law @xmath317 .",
    "our point estimate at 100hz is in good agreement with the analytical expectation ( with a precision better than @xmath318 ) , and our analysis shows that non - gaussian regimes can be probed by the standard cross - correlation statistics near optimal sensitivity , confirming the work of @xcite .",
    "future mock data will include a wider range of signals , encompassing cbc signals from bns , nsbh / bbh , imbh systems ; a possible primordial stochastic background ; and rare burst - like signals such as core - collapse supernovae",
    ". the challenge will be not only to detect these signals but to measure their parameters , and ultimately to extract a unique range of information about astrophysics , fundamental physics and cosmology from the data .",
    "information on future challenges , and on how to participate will be posted on the et mdc website http://www.oca.eu/regimbau/et-mdc_web/et-mdc.html .",
