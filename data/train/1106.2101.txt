    ".    a qualitative understanding of binding versus anti - binding of the collective two - particle states can be obtained from considering the diagonal matrix elements @xmath211 of two particles versus their relative distance @xmath182 at fixed total momentum @xmath181 .",

    "this is consistent with binding versus anti - binding of the collective states in fig .",

    "this figure is another main result of our paper and summarizes several aspects .",
    "first , the spectrum is very rich and consists of various discrete states and three superimposed two - particle continua .",
    "this should be contrasted against plain two - leg ladders , which show a less involved low - energy spectrum @xcite .",
    "some of the discrete states are genuine one - particle states and some are collective two - particle states . for the parameters depicted , the collective two - particle states are clearly visible only close to the zone boundary .",
    "the potential existence of critical parameters @xmath218 or wave - vectors @xmath219 for which the collective states merge with the continua is unclear at present .",
    "the @xmath97 one - particle states are contained almost completely within the spectral range of the continua and split off from the latter only in a range of @xmath181 similar to the collective states .",
    "this situation is also very different from two - leg spin - ladders in which the states which split off from the continuum close to the zone boundary are collective ( anti)-bound states only . from an experimental point of view",
    "this may pose a challenge on discriminating between such genuine one - particle and collective two - particle states .",
    "finally , the effects of frustration are clearly visible in going from fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] a ) to b ) : the complete spectrum shows a tendency to localize .",
    "however , in contrast to the one - particle dispersions the two - particle interactions are _ not _ reduced approaching the line of maximum frustration , @xmath54 . in turn",
    "the relative splitting of the collective states from the continuum is enhanced by frustration .    to conclude this section we provide some measure of convergence of the se for the two - particle continuum in fig .",
    "this figure shows the relative change in energy of all two - particle states at a fixed total momentum versus their energy when switching from an @xmath189 to an @xmath107 evaluation of the matrix elements of @xmath220 . for this",
    "we confine ourselves to @xmath126 .",
    "as is obvious , the changes are completely negligible and fully justify the use of @xmath189 se for the two - particle states .",
    "we note in passing , that @xmath107 se will not only lead to longer - range irreducible one - particle hoppings , but also increase the range of the irreducible two - particle interactions in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , retaining however the rapid decay with distance depicted there .",
    "to summarize , we have studied the strong rung - coupling regime of the frustrated four - spin tube .",
    "remarkably , this spin model displays several twists with respect to conventional two - leg spin ladders .",
    "it allows for frustration induced quantum - phase transitions into phases other than the plaquette singlet phase .",
    "the nature of these phases remains to be explored .",
    "the structure of the excitations is both richer , and different as compared to two - leg ladders , including a reordering of two - particle ( anti)bound states and additional elementary excitation modes , some of which can be made to decay by reducing the symmetry of the ffst .",
    "finally geometric frustration on the ffst introduces a control parameter allowing for almost localization of excitations and a flattening of the energy landscape .",
    "as compared to potential material realizations of the ffst in cu@xmath6cl@xmath8@xmath10d@xmath11c@xmath8so@xmath6 , several extensions have to be considered in the future . these comprise e.g. reducing the @xmath130-symmetry and considering the weak rung - coupling limit .",
