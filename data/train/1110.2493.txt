    "the hosts of high redshift quasars and radio galaxies provide an important insight into the formation of the most massive galaxies at high redshifts .",
    "in particular , they can be used to study the origin of the black hole mass  bulge mass / velocity dispersion relation ( magorrian et al .",
    "1998 , gebhardt et al .",
    "2000 ; ferrarese et al .  2000 ) and its possible explanation in terms of agn feedback on star formation in the host galaxy ( silk & rees 1998 ; king 2003 ) .",
    "dust obscured quasars play a key role in such models , representing the intermediate stage after the black hole has begun accreting gas from its surroundings , but before agn driven winds have cleared gas and dust from the line of sight to the quasar ( fabian 1999 ; li et al .",
    "2006 ) , in a manner similar to that proposed by sanders et al .",
    "( 1988 ) .    in order to test these models , it is particularly important to build up samples of dust - obscured quasars , especially at high redshifts , where an increased amount of quasar obscuration is thought to be due to dust in the host galaxy ( e.g.  treister et al .",
    "2009 ) , rather than by a nuclear torus as in the orientation - based unified scheme for local seyfert and radio galaxies / quasars ( antonucci 1993 ) . over the past few years",
    ", we have been constructing a sample of mid - infrared selected , dust obscured quasars , building on the work of lacy et al .",
    "( 2007a ) .",
    "this sample includes @xmath5 objects with redshifts past the peak in number density of the normal quasar population at @xmath6 ( richards et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "obscured quasars also have an useful practical advantage over normal quasars , namely that the obscuration of the quasar nucleus by dust allows the host galaxy of the quasar to be characterized much more easily . only in these obscured quasars",
    "is it possible to obtain accurate estimates of host galaxy stellar luminosities and galaxy morphologies ( zakamska et al .",
    "2006 ; lacy et al .",
    "2007b ) .",
    "despite their importance , obscured quasars remain a relatively poorly studied population .",
    "large numbers have been found in the sloan digital sky survey ( reyes et al .",
    "2008 ) , but only through mid - infrared selection has it proved possible to find more than a handful of these objects at @xmath7 , where the [ oiii ] emission line is redshifted out of the rest - frame optical band ( martnez - sansigre et a.  2005 ; lacy et al .  2007a ; polleta et al .  2006 ; 2009 ) .",
    "existing observations of high-@xmath4 dust obscured quasars do tend to support a scenario in which a significant fraction of the dusty quasar population is reddened by dust in the host galaxy , rather than a nuclear torus ( martnez - sansigre et al .",
    "2006 ; lacy et al .",
    "2007b ) , but key unknowns in the observational studies of these objects remain .",
    "these include the masses of the molecular gas reservoirs in these objects , and the stellar luminosities of the hosts . from work that has been performed on similar objects , including @xmath6 ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) selected at 24@xmath8 m with _ spitzer _ ( yan et al .",
    "2010 ) , many of which are agn - dominated , and on a few other type-2 quasars at @xmath9 ( martnez - sansigre et al.2009 ; polletta et al .",
    "2011 ) , it seems that molecular gas is present in such objects , but how the molecular gas content relates to other host galaxy properties is unclear .",
    "we were thus motivated to study the co emission from luminous obscured quasars , since it traces the molecular gas content of the galaxy , and hence the reservoir of molecular gas available for star formation .",
    "in particular , the low-@xmath10 transitions provide the best tracer for the total gas mass ( papadopoulos & ivison 2002 ) .",
    "the low critical density of these transitions allows them to be seen against the cosmic microwave background in gas with density as low as @xmath11 . to do this",
    ", we use the new capabilities of the extended very large array ( evla ) .",
    "the vla has a large collecting area , but has hitherto been restricted through not having receivers in the 30 - 40ghz range , or a correlator capable of correlating a wide bandwidth .",
    "the evla , with ka - band receivers and the wide - band widar correlator provides the opportunity to study these objects in the lowest co ( 1 - 0 ) transition .",
    "when fully commissoned , the widar correlator will be able to correlate an 8ghz bandwidth .",
    "it will thus be capable of measuring redshifts for galaxies whose distances are relatively poorly constrained ( for example , galaxies with only photometric redshifts ) , and for galaxies whose emission features in the optical / near - infrared are obscured by dust . for this initial investigation",
    ", we used the restricted correlator bandwidth available through the open shared risk observation ( osro ) program and objects with well - constrained redshifts with relatively narrow ( @xmath12kms@xmath13 ) emission lines . the combination of these data with newly released archival data from the _ herschel _ telescope allows us to study the gas and dust content of these objects for the first time .",
    "we assume a cosmology with @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "our objects were selected in the mid - infrared using the selection technique of lacy et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , which finds candidate agn and quasars , both obscured and unobscured , by virtue of their red mid - infrared continua .",
    "our obscured quasars comprise both dust - reddened type-1 quasars ( objects with red continua , but broad permitted lines ) , and type-2 quasars , selected from the _ spitzer _ swire survey ( lonsdale et al .",
    "2003 ) and the extragalactic first look survey ( xfls ) ( lacy et al .  2005 ; fadda et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "optical spectra of the first 77 objects in this mid - infrared selected sample were published in lacy et al .",
    "( 2007a ) . a further @xmath16 spectra",
    "have now been obtained ( lacy et al .",
    "2012 , in preparation ) . from this list we picked out a pilot sample of two obscured quasars for follow - up with the evla in osro mode , according to the following criteria : @xmath17 , @xmath18 ( to ensure good ras for night time summer observing ) and optical spectroscopic redshifts from multiple emission lines ( figure 1 ) .",
    "unlike most other samples of quasars selected for co follow - up , our objects were not pre - selected for bright far - infrared emission .",
    "the high redshifts of our sources mean that the available optical spectra sample the rest - frame uv . our working definition of a type-2 quasar as an object which lacks broad permitted lines in the rest - frame optical . as only xfls171419.97 + 602724.8 has a rest - frame optical spectrum ( figure 2 ) , we are only sure of this one as being a type-2 quasar by our definition",
    ". however , the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of sw161117.30 + 541759.2 suggests it is dominated by starlight in the rest - frame optical .",
    "the spectra are discussed in more detail in section 3 .",
    "xfls171419.97 + 602724.8 has had its optical spectrum previously published in lacy et al .",
    "( 2007a ) ( but reproduced here for ease of comparison with the near - infared spectrum presented here ) .",
    "the spectrum of sw161117.30 + 541759.2 was taken using hectospec on the mmt during june 2008 , we used the 270 groove per mm grating , resulting in a spectral resolution of @xmath19 nm . approximately 130 fibers were placed on candidate agn in each setting .",
    "the field was observed for for @xmath20s .",
    ".redshifts and photometry [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     notes : @xmath21 is the fraction of starlight in the model in rest - frame @xmath22-band , @xmath23 is the optical depth in @xmath24-band and @xmath25 is the fractional contribution of the young stellar population in the dual stellar population model .",
    "the limit on @xmath26 is calculated assuming the quasar is accreting at the eddington rate .",
    "the best spectroscopic analogues with similar redshifts as these objects are high redshift radio galaxies ( mccarthy 1993 ) , and type-2 quasars detected in x - ray surveys ( e.g.  norman et al .  2002 ; silverman et al .",
    "the ly@xmath27 lines from the radio galaxies are , however typically much stronger relative to the uv emission lines , consistent with the large haloes of ionized gas around these objects being affected by the presence of the radio jets ( reuland et al .",
    "these objects also have similar uv spectra to those of low redshift seyfert-2 galaxies ( e.g.  kriss et al .",
    "1992 ; kraemer et al .",
    "1994 ) , and agn selected through lyman - break techniques ( hainline et al .",
    "thus , by analogy with known agn both at high and low redshift we feel secure in assuming that the presence of high ionization , high equivalent width uv emission lines is a reliable tracer of agn activity .",
    "few co ( 1 - 0 ) measurements of normal quasars at similar redshifts have been published .",
    "riechers et al .",
    "( 2006 ) measured co(1 - 0 ) of three @xmath28 quasars using the greenbank and effelsberg telescopes .",
    "their luminosities are significantly higher than those measured for dusty quasars in this paper ( @xmath29 ) , but the quasars are intrinsically more luminous , and were pre - selected for having ultraluminous infrared emission , so form a biased sample . similarly , coppin et al .",
    "( 2008 ) detected co emission in 5/6 optically - luminous , submm detected quasars at @xmath30 , with luminosities of @xmath31 . at higher redshifts , wang et al .",
    "( 2010 ) find slightly lower co luminosities , @xmath32 , in a sample of eight @xmath33 quasars , again pre - selected to have submm continuum detections . at present",
    "it is therefore difficult to say whether the dusty quasars in this paper have significantly more or less molecular gas than their unobscured counterparts , since ours are unbiased towards bright far - infrared luminosities ( but see also klamer et al .",
    "this situation is likely to change rapidly , however , as the evla and alma are fully commissioned over the next 2 - 3 years .",
    "[ [ dusty - quasars - and - the - evolutionary - paradigms - for - massive - galaxies - at - high - redshifts ] ] dusty quasars and the evolutionary paradigms for massive galaxies at high redshifts ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    our understanding of galaxy evolution would be greatly enhanced if we could compare the gas content , stellar masses , star formation rates and space densities in unbiassed samples of different types of massive , high redshift galaxies , in order to constrain evolutionary scenarios .",
    "this would include smgs , warm ulirgs and obscured quasars selected in the mid - infrared or hard x - ray , radio galaxies , normal quasars and , if they exist , the quiescent equivalents of each class .",
    "selection effects on current samples of these populations are strong , however , making it difficult to perform a definitive comparison . in our quasar hosts , there is a selection against objects with low stellar mass due to the requirement for detection in all irac bands , but no pre - selection for high dust masses and star formation rates based on mm / submm continuum detections . in the samples of _ spitzer _ selected ulirgs of yan et al .",
    "( 2010 ) and type-2 quasars of martnez - sansigre et al.(2009 ) , a continuum detection at 1.2 mm ( i.e. a high star formation rate and dust mass ) was a requirement for follow - up observations for co. the smgs with co ( 1 - 0 ) measurements are also restricted to a fairly small sample at present , though this situation is likely to change in the next few months as evla commissioning progresses ( e.g.  ivison et al .",
    "nevertheless , we can attempt to piece together a consistent picture with what is currently available .",
    "figure 6 shows our quasar host galaxies compared to other high redshift objects ( including other type-2 quasars ) in the co - luminosity  stellar luminosity ( rest - frame @xmath22-band absolute magnitude ) plane .",
    "assuming similar conversions between co luminosity and co mass , and stellar luminosity and stellar mass for the different populations shown here , we can begin to constrain some evolutionary scenarios between these types of objects .",
    "the type-2 quasars vary considerably in co mass .",
    "the two @xmath34 objects from polletta et al .",
    "( 2011 ) have gas masses comparable to smgs , but the @xmath35 objects from this paper and the @xmath36 and @xmath37 objects from martinez - sansigre et al .  ( 2009 ) have detections or limits significantly lower than this . with the exception of xfls171419.97 + 602724.8 ,",
    "the type-2 quasars tend to have similar stellar masses to the smgs .    making the assumption of conversion of gas to stars with 100% efficiency",
    ", trajectories can be drawn on figure 6 ( such as the large magenta arrow ) to indicate how a galaxy might evolve with time .",
    "( although such a scenario is highly simplistic as feedback effects will prevent the complete conversion of gas to stars , more gas is likely to accumulate too , both from expelled gas cooling and infalling , and from accretion of fresh material . )",
    "this simple scenario would indicate that smgs and co - rich type-2 quasars could evolve into moderately - high stellar mass galaxies , comparable in mass to the hosts of normal type-2 quasars .",
    "however , unless they are able to accrete significantly more gas than is currently present in their molecular reservoirs ( or merge with other massive galaxies ) , they would not be able to evolve into our most massive host galaxy , xfls171419.97 + 602724.8",
    ". it may be significant that , although this object is extremely luminous in the infrared , it has a high dust temperature , perhaps indicating a more evolved system overall , with agn heating dominating the infrared sed .",
    "the @xmath6 ulirgs seem to be a distinct population of relatively low stellar mass objects that could evolve into some of the lower mass ( and lower luminosity ) type-2 quasars .",
    "similarly , the bx and bzk galaxies also look to be distinct from the majority of the smgs and type-2 quasars .",
    "clearly , however , these is a need for larger samples of high redshift galaxies with better controlled selection effects .",
    "these can now be provided using the new generation of micro - jansky depth , @xmath38deg@xmath39 near - infrared surveys such as the _",
    "extragalactic representative volume survey ( mauduit et al .  2011 ) in combination with far - infrared surveys with herschel ( e.g.  oliver et al",

    "<S> we present optical through radio observations of the host galaxies of two dust obscured , luminous quasars selected in the mid - infrared , at @xmath0 and @xmath1 , including a search for co emission . </S>",
    "<S> our limits on the co luminosities are consistent with these objects having masses of molecular gas @xmath2 , several times less than those of luminous submillimeter - detected galaxies ( smgs ) at comparable redshifts . </S>",
    "<S> their near - infrared spectral energy distributions ( seds ) , however , imply that these galaxies have high stellar masses ( @xmath3 ) the relatively small reservoirs of molecular gas and low dust masses are consistent with them being relatively mature systems at high-@xmath4 . </S>"
