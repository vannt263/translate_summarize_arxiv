    "the subject of dense cold ionized matter under strong magnetic field has promised a wide applications in both artificial laboratory as well as naturally occurring plasmas such as astrophysical compact objects @xcite .",
    "such state of matter is usually termed as `` quantum plasma '' .",
    "quantum optics and electronic transport effects play important role in metallic and semiconductor nano - structured materials such as , nano - particles , quantum - wells , quantum - wires and quantum - dots @xcite . a vast majority of recent studies on quantum plasmas @xcite have been inspired by the pioneering works of chandrasekhar , bohm , pines and levine et.al @xcite . in a quantum plasma ,",
    "also known as the zero - temperature fermi - plasma the inter - fermion distances are much lower than the characteristic de broglie thermal wavelength , @xmath0 and this causes a new type collective phenomenon due to the electron degeneracy and tunneling effect , which is encountered only in quantum plasmas such as in ordinary metals or compact astrophysical objects .",
    "the electron degeneracy is a direct consequence of the pauli exclusion principle , which effectively rules the thermodynamical properties of a dense plasma @xcite .",
    "it has been confirmed using a quantum hydrodynamics ( qhd ) model that , in quantum plasmas the nonlinear wave dynamics , due to delicate interplay between dissipation and dispersion , can lead to a variety of soliton- , explosive- and shock - like density structures @xcite .",
    "more recently , marlkund and brodin have extended qhd model to include the electron spin-1/2 effects @xcite by introducing a generalized term for the quantum force .",
    "some estimates indicate that the relativistic electrons in a white dwarf can generate magnetic fields of the order of @xmath1 and higher @xcite , and that in a neutron star the self - field may be of order @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "it has also been found that , in a perfect conductive quantum plasma , the spin magnetization term introduced in quantum magnetohydrodynamics ( qmhd ) equations acts as a negative pressure - like entity significantly effecting the dynamics of the spin - induced nonlinear magnetosonic excitations @xcite .",
    "chandrasekhar in 1935 @xcite showed that , despite the fusion - like nature of a compact astrophysical object such as white dwarf , it can be treated a an ideal zero - temperature and completely degenerate fermi - dirac gas .",
    "this is due to the gigantic inward gravitational pressure which act on the star . using the fermi - dirac statistics and combining it with relativity principles , in a pioneering work",
    ", he succeeded to proved that the gravitational pressure can lead to the state of a relativistic degeneracy for electrons and an ultimate collapse of the star in relativistic degeneracy case @xcite .",
    "the sudden collapse of the white dwarf is due to softening of the degeneracy pressure of electrons when the they become relativistic and this has been shown to alter the whole thermodynamical properties of the star @xcite . in a recent investigation it has been found that the change in the degeneracy state from nonrelativistic to relativistic one can also modify the nonlinear dynamics of a quantum plasma @xcite .",
    "being inspired by the work of marklund @xcite et.al , it is tempting to explore the relativistic degeneracy effects on spin - induced magnetosonic nonlinear propagations , knowing the fact that the spin pressure may have crucial effects at the level of large electron densities ( @xmath3 ) estimated for astrophysical compact objects and also the suppressed collision rate known for fermi - dirac plasmas due to pauli - blocking .",

    "note that in the case of fully degenerate quantum plasma the pauli paramagnetism dominates the langevin - type one , hence , the fermi - temperature , @xmath15 , replaces the thermal electron temperature , @xmath19 in magnetic pressure term . due to the pauli exclusion rule , in a completely degenerate plasma only a small fraction ( @xmath20 ) ,",
    "i.e. unpaired free - electrons , with energies nearly equal to the fermi - energy contribute to the collective spin effects .",
    "this effect gives rise to the well - known pauli paramagnetic law of the form @xmath21 @xcite instead of the langevin - type susceptibility , @xmath22 , frequently used for dense plasmas in literature . on the other hand",
    ", the landau demagnetization susceptibility of @xmath23 should be added due to electron orbital contribution which results in total sum of @xmath24 .",

    "moreover , the resistivity of a completely degenerate fermi - dirac plasma is supposed to be negligible , since , the electron - ion collisions are suppressed by pauli - blocking mechanism , hence , @xmath44 which using eq .",

    "a clear definition of the relativistic degeneracy and distinction between a low - pressure relativistic plasma from the relativistically degenerate quantum fermi - gas is in order .",
    "the relativistic degeneracy is a completely quantum phenomenon ruled by the uncertainty principle and is increased due to the decrease in inter - fermion distances in degenerated plasmas .",
    "although the relativistic effects arise due to increase in fermion number - density in a dense degenerate plasma , however , unlike for the low - pressure relativistic plasmas the degeneracy pressure in the fermion momentum fluid equation usually dominates the relativistic dynamic effects in super - dense plasma state .",
    "chandrasekhar @xcite , combining the relativity and the quantum statistics , showed that for dense degenerate fermi - gas such as a white - dwarf with a mass - density , @xmath60 , the degeneracy pressure turns from @xmath61 ( with polytropic index @xmath62 ) dependence for normal degeneracy in the limit @xmath63 to @xmath64 ( with polytropic index @xmath65 ) dependence for relativistic degeneracy case in the limit @xmath66 .",
    "the relativistic degeneracy starts at mass density of about @xmath67 of the order in the core a @xmath68 white dwarf , which corresponds to a fermi - momentum @xmath69 ( equivalent to the relativistic degeneracy parameter value of @xmath70 ) or the threshold velocity of @xmath71 ( the fermi relativistic factor @xmath72 ) .",

    "the possibility of solitary excitation relies on some conditions to satisfy , simultaneously , namely @xmath85 it is further required that for at least one either maximum or minimum nonzero @xmath86-value , we have @xmath87 , so that for every value of @xmath86 in the range @xmath88 ( compressive soliton ) or @xmath89 ( rarefactive soliton ) , @xmath90 is negative ( it is understood that there is no root in the range @xmath91 $ ] ) .",
    "in such a condition we can obtain a potential minimum which describes the possibility of a solitary wave propagation .",
    "the stationary soliton solutions corresponding to this pseudo - potential which satisfies the mentioned boundary - conditions , read as @xmath92 the conditions for the existence of a solitary propagation stated above require that , first , it takes infinitely long pseudo - time ( @xmath93 ) for the system to get away from the unstable point ( @xmath94 ) .",
    "this statement requires that @xmath95 or equivalently @xmath96 in parametric space , as it is also inferred by the shape of a solitary wave .",
    "thereafter , moving forward in pseudo - time ( @xmath93 ) axis , the localized density perturbation reaches a maximum or a minimum at @xmath97 ( if it exists ) at which the pseudo - speed ( @xmath98 ) of the analogous particle bound in pseudo - potential ( @xmath90 ) region of @xmath99 ( or @xmath100 ) reaches zero again and it returns back .",
    "note that , in the parametric space , from equation eq .",
    "( [ soliton ] ) , it is observed that in physical situation @xmath90 should be negative for solitary ( non - periodic ) wave solution , which is clearly satisfied if @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",

    "a close inspection of the pseudopotential given in eq . ( [ pseudo ] ) reveals that @xmath114 a result which is independent of all plasma parameters .",

    "( [ qp ] ) , versus the relativity parameter , @xmath118 for a relativistically degenerate fermi - gas ( fermi - dirac plasma ) .",
    "it is clearly observed that the increase in the relativity parameter ( relativistic degeneracy of the plasma ) causes the increase in the relativistic susceptibility value .",
    "this is due to the increase in the number density of electrons . *    * the soliton stability region is shown in fig .",
    "2 , which indicates that the existence of magnetoacoustic nonlinear propagation is significantly affected by the relativistic degeneracy and the pauli spin magnetization effects . in this plot and others",
    "mentioned further we have used appropriate range for the zeeman energy parameter , @xmath119 which corresponds to the field strength range , @xmath120 , typical of astrophysical compact objects . however , for some neutron stars or pulsars the corresponding magnetic field may even be much higher ( @xmath121 ) .",
    "the critical mach curve of @xmath122-@xmath83 plane at @xmath116 or @xmath123 is clearly consistent with the plots given in ref .",
    "@xcite and indicates the increase in the soliton matching speed - range with increase in the value of relativistic degeneracy parameter , @xmath83 .",
    "on the other hand , the introduction of a magnetic field ( @xmath124 ) change the lower part of @xmath122-@xmath83 cross - section ( nonrelativistic plasma degeneracy regime , i.e. @xmath125 ) effectively , leaving the large @xmath83 ( relativistic plasma degeneracy regime , i.e. @xmath126 ) part almost unaffected .",
    "this means that the soliton speed for denser plasmas are less affected by pauli paramagnetic effects .",
    "furthermore , for every nonzero value of @xmath127 there is minimum soliton matching speed , @xmath128 , in @xmath122-@xmath83 plane , value of which increases as the strebght of the magnetic field increases . as it is observed from fig .",
    "2 , the pauli spin paramagnetism causes the soliton matching speed - range to increase to higher values .",
    "it is remarkable that , as the paramagnetic effect increases ( magnetic field becomes stronger ) the widening of the soliton matching speed - range increases and extends to higher plasma mass - density area . *",
    "* figure 3 points to remarkable differences of pseudopotential for soliton existence in different plasma degeneracy regimes , namely , nonrelativistic and relativistic degeneracies .",
    "first of all is the difference in the scale of the pseudopotential itself which is related to the soliton width . the second is the effect of the relativistic degeneracy parameter , @xmath83 on the potential width , while the effect is similar for the potential depth ( compare figs .",
    "3(a ) and 3(b ) ) .",
    "third difference is noticed easily comparing figs .",
    "3(c ) and 3(d ) where shows the ineffectiveness of the magnetic field change on the potential profile in the relativistic degeneracy case regarding to that of normal degeneracy .",
    "however , there is almost no difference in the effect of change in matching soliton speed on potentials between the two mentioned cases , since , this is related to the general properties of nonlinear wave propagation theory in dispersive media . * * in fig .",
    "4 we have shown the effect of variation of plasma fractional parameter on the width and amplitude of the magnetoacoustic solitons in a quantum plasma in the presence of pauli spin magnetization . in this figure",
    "the differences between the two extreme degeneracy regimes are obvious .",
    "it is noted that the soliton widths are comparably larger in relativistically degenerate plasma ( left column ) compared to those of the normally degenerate ones ( right column ) . as it is remarked by comparing figs .",
    "4(a ) and 4(b ) the increase in the plasma mass - density , @xmath47 ( or equivalently the value of relativistic degeneracy parameter , @xmath83 ) increases / decreases the soliton amplitude in relativistic / nonrelativistic plasma degeneracy regime while the soliton width always increases with increase in the plasma mass - density value for both relativistic and nonrelativistic degeneracy regimes .",
    "it appears from figs .",
    "4(b ) that the magnetic field has absolutely no effect on soliton properties in a relativistically degenerate plasma compared to its partner in norelativistic one , shown in fig .",
    "4(d ) , which its amplitude / wicth increases / decreases due to increase in the local magnetic field strength , @xmath46 ( or increase in normalized zeeman energy ) . this property marks a distinct feature of soliton dynamics in superdense astrophysical objects which requires further investigations .",
    "finally , it is confirmed by figs .",
    "4(e ) and 4(f ) that , the faster solitons are smaller and wider in both plasma degeneracy regimes , consistent with the soliton propagation properties . *",
    "we investigated the effect of pauli spin magnetization on nonlinear si magnetosonic wave dynamics in both relativistic and nonrelativistically degenerate quantum plasma .",
    "the standard pseudopotential method is employed to achieve the matching condition for propagation of these waves based on quantum magnetohydrodynamics equations .",
    "it was confirmed that , independent of the values of plasma fractional parameters such as wave mach - number , relativistic degeneracy parameter and the strength of the perpendicular magnetic field , always rarefactive solitary structures exist .",
    "it was revealed that fundamental differences in soliton dynamics propagating in the two plasma degeneracy regimes exist .",
    "current results can be useful in the study of astrophysical magnetized compact objects such as white dwarfs , pulsar magnetospheres and interiors of giant planets .",
