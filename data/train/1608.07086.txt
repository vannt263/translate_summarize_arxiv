    "little is known about @xmath0 resonances @xcite since it is difficult to produce them in the laboratory directly .",
    "there are limited facilities around the world which have anti - kaon beams and a beam of nonstrange nature on a nucleon leads to low yields of @xmath0 baryons as two pairs of strange quarks are required to be produced in this case .",
    "however , efforts are being made to improve this situation .",
    "for example , the photoproduction of @xmath0 s on nucleons is being explored currently at the jefferson laboratory @xcite considering the possibility of the production of a hyperon resonance in the intermediate state , thus producing the strange quark pairs in two steps . also , more information is expected to come in future from the j - parc @xcite and @xmath6anda @xcite facilities .",
    "in addition , studies made by belle @xcite and babar @xcite collaborations show that it is possible to extract useful information on this subject from rare processes too .",
    "specifically , some intriguing findings related to the properties of @xmath7 have been reported in such studies .",
    "we find it useful to list these findings , and other relevant information on @xmath7 , in a separate subsection dedicated to @xmath7 below .",
    "the first observation of @xmath7 in the @xmath8 invariant mass spectrum was reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the mass and width were determined to be @xmath9  mev , @xmath10  mev in the negatively charged channel and @xmath11  mev , @xmath12  mev in the neutral channel .",
    "the spin - parity of this state was not determined in ref .",
    "although the mass values obtained by the latest investigations @xcite are not very different , the width of @xmath7 has been determined to be even narrower , of the order of 10 mev @xcite . to mention explicit results , the babar collaboration deduced the mass and width of @xmath7 to be : @xmath13  mev , @xmath14 mev @xcite , and the belle collaboration reported : @xmath15 mev , @xmath16 mev @xcite . both studies obtained spin - parity of this state as @xmath17 .",
    "it was also found in ref .",
    "@xcite that a clear evidence for @xmath18 is found in the @xmath19 invariant mass spectrum but not in the @xmath20 spectrum .",
    "the information on the branching ratio of @xmath18 to @xmath21 and @xmath8 has been updated in ref .",
    "@xcite to , @xmath22 as compared to the value ( @xmath23 ) obtained from the older analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "these properties are difficult to understand , for example , the narrow width of @xmath7 in spite of having a large phase space to decay to open channels , like , @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "similar is the case of the finding related to the suppressed decay to @xmath24 , as compared to the decay to the @xmath21 channel ( as is evident from the difficulty in the identification of the signal of @xmath18 in the @xmath20 spectrum of refs .",
    "@xcite ) . a light quark pair production , within a nave quark model , is equivalently required in both cases ( as can be seen in fig .",

    "( [ ratio ] ) ) is also counterintuitive : there is little phase space for decay to the former one and one would anticipate this ratio to be much smaller .",
    "in fact , these experimental findings have motivated theoretical investigations within quark models , and the mass has been obtained : @xmath31 1725 mev @xcite .",
    "also , the decay properties of @xmath7 have been studied within a chiral quark model @xcite , which includes hadron dynamics through a quark - meson effective coupling , and its total width was found to be 25  mev .",
    "this value , although not widely different , is larger than the one observed in refs .",
    "recently , the findings of the bes and the belle collaborations motivated a study of @xmath7 in terms of hadron degrees of freedom also @xcite .",
    "the formalism used in ref .",
    "@xcite , based on a @xmath32-channel interaction of pseudoscalar meson - baryon channels , reproduces well the mass of @xmath7 but the width is found to be around 1 mev .",
    "the author of ref .  @xcite suggested that inclusion of more diagrams might be useful in obtaining a width of the order of 10 mev .    in view of the growing interest in the @xmath0-baryons at the experimental facilities ,",
    "we find it timely to study cascade resonances in meson - baryon coupled systems .",
    "our formalism includes interaction of both pseudoscalar as well vector mesons , and in the latter case we include @xmath33- , @xmath32- , @xmath34-channel diagrams and a contact term , whose origin will be explained in a subsequent section . as we shall show in this article , in agreement with ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath7 can be understood as a state generated due to meson - baryon coupled channel dynamics and it is possible to straightforwardly understand all the experimental results reported in refs .",
    "@xcite . a hadronic dynamical origin of resonances",
    "was predicted long time ago by trnqvist  @xcite and the possibility of understanding some @xmath0 baryons ( including @xmath7 ) in terms of hadron dynamics has been discussed earlier in the literature  @xcite .",
    "we will compare our results with those obtained in such previous studies in this manuscript .",
    "as we shall discuss , we find an evidence for another @xmath0 resonance , which is also narrower than expected ( due to the existence of several open channels for decay ) and can be related to @xmath2 .",
    "we find that the nature of this state is such that it can be difficult to identify its presence in the experimental data .",
    "we suggest possible ways to detect @xmath2 .      before proceeding further , for the sake of completeness",
    ", we find it useful to present the known information on @xmath2 as well .",
    "not much information is available on this resonance .",

    "this state was first found in @xmath21 mass spectrum in ref .",
    "@xcite , which reported its mass and width values to be @xmath35 mev and @xmath36 mev .",
    "one of the later investigation confirmed an accumulation of events around 2120 mev in @xmath21 and determined the mass and width to be @xmath37 mev and @xmath38 mev @xcite .",
    "this state was , however , not found in ref .",
    "all these experimental data suffer from poor statistics . a better quality data is required to determine the properties of @xmath0 s with mass above 2 gev . indications of the existence of @xmath0 resonances around 2120 mev",
    ", whose origin lies in the meson - baryon coupled channel dynamics , has been discussed in some previous works .",
    "for example , in ref .",
    "@xcite , a pole around 2100 mev is found with a full width of @xmath39 mev for a @xmath0 , with @xmath40 and @xmath41 , as a result of pseudoscalar and vector meson - baryon interaction treated within a @xmath42 symmetry . in ref .",
    "@xcite also a @xmath0 with @xmath40 and @xmath41 , with mass @xmath43 2100 mev and width @xmath44 mev is found to get generated from meson - baryon dynamics .",
    "as we will show , we find the width of @xmath2 to be narrower .",
    "we discuss the details of our formalism and results in the next sections . in the discussions on the results",
    ", we will show that the presence of resonances affects the cross sections of processes like @xmath45 and @xmath46 , which can be important in understanding the enhanced @xmath0 production found in the ar + kcl collisions by the hades collaboration @xcite .",
    "the formalism of the present study is based on solving the bethe - salpeter equation in a coupled channel approach . to do this",
    "we consider all systems with strangeness @xmath47 formed by a pseudoscalar / vector meson with an octet baryon : @xmath24 , @xmath48 , @xmath8 , @xmath21 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "we obtain the amplitudes for different transitions among these channels using lagrangians based on effective field theories . to determine the vector - meson  baryon interaction we use the formalism developed in our previous work @xcite .",
    "a detailed analysis of the low energy vector meson interaction with octet baryons was carried out in ref  @xcite by calculating @xmath33- , @xmath32- and @xmath34-channel diagrams and a contact interaction , using a lagrangian invariant under the gauge transformations of the hidden - local symmetry .",

    "these values have also been found useful in calculations of the magnetic moments of the baryons in ref .",
    "@xcite .",

    "for example , the contact - term ( eq .  ( [ vct ] ) ) for the @xmath49 diagonal amplitude , or for the transition of @xmath92 to @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 is small , but the same is comparable , or even larger than the @xmath32-channel amplitude for @xmath93 . for a numerical comparison ,",
