    "weak value , introduced as a result of weak measurements @xcite , has attracted attention in quantum physics recently @xcite .",
    "while the application of the amplification effect ( aav effect ) has been discussed actively , the weak value gives us a new approach to the fundamental issues . at the same time",
    ", it has been challenging to shed light on the meaning of a weak value , since it may take an anomalous value lying outside the range of eigenvalue spectra @xcite . in particular , it has been of great importance to reveal whether a weak value is worthy of a physical value by itself , namely , without the context of measurements ; weak values were found to be useful for describing several quantum phenomena @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it should be verified that a weak value works in quantum physics not only qualitatively but also quantitatively , by which the weak value must attain the position of a value of a physical quantity .",
    "in fact , we gave indication of the appearance of a weak value in the dirac equation ; with the weak value , we could describe the pair production via a supercritical step potential @xcite and the supply of an electric carrier in graphene @xcite .",
    "importantly , we also succeeded in estimating the pair production rate and the electric current respectively in these previous works : we can cope with the quantitative problems by means of the weak values .    in this paper , along the lines of these discussions",
    ", we deal with the schwinger mechanism in the view of weak values .",
    "the schwinger mechanism represents pair productions in vacuum triggered by a uniform electric field @xmath0 , the rate of which in @xmath1 dimension ( @xmath2 ) is given by @xmath3 where the particle has the mass @xmath4 and the charge @xmath5 ; @xmath6 is the velocity of light @xcite . because of the two degrees of freedom by the 1/2 spin , which makes double counts",
    ", the rate in 3 + 1 dimension is similarly given by @xmath7 the exponential decrease in the rates comes from the landau - zener tunneling through the energy gap between @xmath8 and @xmath9 . in @xcite , using weak values , we estimated the production rate for the massless ( @xmath10 ) pairs in 2 + 1 dimension , when we discussed the electric current in graphene . in similar fashion , it should be also possible to derive the rates for massless pairs in the other dimensions by using weak values , which is our first goal .",
    "for the massive pairs , when the electric field is strong enough to satisfy @xmath11 , in all the dimension , the decreasing rate by the mass can be obtained as follows , @xmath12 where @xmath13 denotes the production rate for massless pairs .",
    "our second goal is to obtain this decreasing rate in each dimension . in discussing such quantitative problem ,",
    "the weak value offers a new qualitative aspect of the pair production , especially , the landau - zener tunneling in the schwinger mechanism . the singularity of the massless , 1 + 1 dimensional case is also clarified in estimating the pair production rate , because the pair production takes place in the different manner from the other cases .",
    "in addition , we can also make the deeper understanding of how the weak values derive the results in the consistent way , when we consider the massive cases : we can clarify the difference between transition and transmission , which was not shown in the previous paper @xcite .",
    "hereafter the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec:2 + 1 ] ,",
    "we review our previous result of the massless dirac particles in 2 + 1 dimension and generalise it for the massive ones .",
    "this procedure can be easily applied to the 3 + 1 dimensional case in section [ sec:3 + 1 ] . in section [ sec:1 + 1 ]",
    ", we deal with the 1 + 1 dimensional case , in which we need to alter our procedure a little bit : we need a slightly artful treatment for the massless pairs because of the singularity as we mentioned above .",
    "we conclude our result in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "in this section , we first review our previous result for the massless , 2 + 1 dimensional case @xcite , and then the theory is developed into the massive , 2 + 1 dimensional case .      using the pauli matrices @xmath14 ,",
    "the hamiltonian of a massless dirac particle in 2 + 1 dimension can be represented as follows , @xmath15 where we have assumed the uniform electric field @xmath0 in @xmath16 direction .",
    "an eigenstate of the free hamiltonian with an energy @xmath17 and a momentum @xmath18 can be described by the chirality and the space part as @xmath19 , where the chirality @xmath20 is independent of @xmath16 and @xmath21 : the chirality of a negative ( positive ) energy @xmath22 ( @xmath17 ) is given by @xmath23 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2e } } \\left [   \\begin{array}{c }   ( p_x - ip_y)c\\\\   \\pm e   \\end{array } \\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] up to the global phase , where @xmath24 and @xmath25 . since",
    "an energy eigenstate can be specified by the chirality , an energy transition can be represented by a pre - postselection on the chirality ; in particular , a transition from a negative energy @xmath26 to a positive one @xmath27 corresponds to a particle - antiparticle pair production . considering the direction of the electric field",
    ", we discuss the transition from ( @xmath28 ) to ( @xmath29 ) with @xmath30 @xmath31 , by which the directions of the velocities before and after the transition are the same as in @xmath32 direction .",
    "we have also taken account of the preservation of the momentum in @xmath21 direction .",
    "when the time @xmath33 is small enough , the pre - postselection on the chirality brings about the time evolution on the space part @xmath34 as follows , ' should be corrected as ` preselection @xmath35 . ' in addition to the energy , the momentum is also involved in the chirality . in this paper , we clarify it in the notation of the chirality as @xmath20 to avoid confusion . ]",
    "@xmath36 where @xmath37 @xmath38 is a weak value defined by , @xmath39 @xmath40 corresponds to the group velocity in @xmath41 direction and gives the current driven by the transition .",
    "since the electric field is in @xmath16 direction , @xmath42 should be zero , from which we can find @xmath43 that is to say , only the transition from ( @xmath28 ) to ( @xmath44 ) is allowed . in this case , the weak value of @xmath45 shows @xmath46 where we have made use of @xmath25 . as shown in @xcite , the velocity given by this weak value is the requisite velocity to yield the changing of both the energy @xmath47 and the momentum @xmath48 : the electric field should perform the work @xmath49 and the impulse @xmath50 with the distance @xmath51 and the time @xmath52 , by which the average velocity of the particle can be defined as @xmath53 . in fact , this average velocity agrees with @xmath54 .",
    "although @xmath54 is larger than @xmath6 , the velocities in @xmath16 direction just before and after the transition are both given by @xmath55 . with the transition probability @xmath56 , they should satisfy , @xmath57 by which the weak value can hold the consistency : the average velocities should be equivalent .",
    "note that , without a transition , a velocity never comes into being . in other words , zero velocity with the probability @xmath58",
    "is included in l.h.s . of equation ( [ eq : cons_wv2 ] ) .",
    "as a result , the transition probability is given by @xmath59    in @xcite , we assumed that the transition can be triggered by virtual particles ( virtual transitions ) allowed by the uncertainty relations , within which the time is so small that the the higher terms of @xmath60 ( @xmath61 ) are smaller than the first one of @xmath62 in the time evolution of equation ( [ eq : t_ev2 ] ) ; using the weak values , we can approximately deal with the quantitative problem , namely , the pair production rate , although the time does not always satisfy @xmath63 . according to the energy - time uncertainty relation , an energy fluctuation corresponding to @xmath64",
    "can be allowed during the time @xmath65 which satisfies , @xmath66 a virtual transition caused by this fluctuation can be made real via the weak value , which provides the requisite velocity for changing both the energy and the momentum as mentioned above .",
    "a quantum state can participate in a pair production , if the needed time for the transition @xmath52 satisfies @xmath67 , from which we can obtain , @xmath68 then , we can estimate the pair production rate as follows , @xmath69 where @xmath70 represents the beta function .",
    "note that the production rate in @xmath71 is given by @xmath72 , because @xmath73 represents the rate of a quantum state contributing to the pair productions per unit time .",
    "this result approximately agrees with the pair production rate in equation ( [ eq : i_rate ] ) with @xmath74 and @xmath10 .",
    "the procedure reviewed above can be applied to the massive dirac particle , which is subjected to the hamiltonian given by @xmath75 as in the massless particle , an eigenstate of the free hamiltonian with a negative ( positive ) energy @xmath22 ( @xmath17 ) and a momentum @xmath18 can be assigned with the chirality as follows , @xmath76.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] then , considering the transition from a negative energy state ( @xmath28 ) to a positive one ( @xmath77 ) , the time evolution of the space part @xmath34 can be given by @xmath78 this approximation is also reasonable as long as the time evolution stems from a virtual transition allowed by the uncertainty relation as mentioned above .",
    "if equation ( [ eq : t_ev_app2 m ] ) gives just the shift in @xmath16 direction , namely , the direction of the electric field , the weak values should satisfy @xmath79 rather than @xmath80 , where we have substituted @xmath81 with @xmath82 ; the space part evolves into @xmath83 . as a result",
    ", we obtain the same result as equation ( [ eq : selective ] ) : the transition is selective i.e. from ( @xmath28 ) to ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "then , the weak value of @xmath45 is given by @xmath84 where we have made use of @xmath85 .",
    "on equation ( [ eq : cond_shift ] ) , we note that this case is different from the ` transmission ' in a supercritical step potential @xcite , in which the massive term @xmath86 is not eliminated . in the ` transmission , '",
    "a pair production takes place at the step , in which how to achieve the time ( and the space ) evolution is described by a weak value as shown in figure [ fig : difference ] ( a ) .",
    "the wave function represents the steady flux of the particles , which are incident to the step and are transmitted or reflected at the step .",
    "then , with the transmission probability , the weak value of a group velocity should be consistent with the the group velocities in i and iii .",
    "on the other hand , in the ` transition ' shown in figure [ fig : difference ] ( b ) , a pair production may take place all over the space , whose probability is uniformly distributed .",
    "what the weak value provides is the process of the transition between the two wave functions in a negative energy and a positive one , which represents the fields governing the behavior of a particle in a sense : where such process takes place is not determined beforehand due to the coherence all over the space . unlike the quantum time evolution of one wave function in the ` transmission , ' the time evolution in the ` transition ' should conventionally represent how the electric field achieves the real work and the real impulse . as a result , it is given by the merely shift without the additional shift i.e. the massive term @xmath87 as shown in equation ( [ eq : cond_shift ] ) .",
    "the consistency of the average velocity like equation ( [ eq : cons_wv2 ] ) must be also on the two waves , which will be on the phase velocities rather than the group velocities .",
    "then , using the transition probability @xmath88 , the weak value of a group velocity , which exactly corresponds to the shift in @xmath16 direction i.e. the phase velocity , should satisfy , @xmath89 where r.h.s .",
    "is the ( average ) phase velocity in @xmath16 direction just before and after the transition . in consequence , we can obtain the same transition probability as equation ( [ eq : prob_2 ] ) .",
    "unlike the massless case , the average velocity @xmath90 may exceed @xmath6 as a phase velocity , while it is also the requisite velocity for the electric field to achieve both the work and the impulse .",
    "due to the coherence all over the space , however , such superluminal velocity is not available and does not contradict the causality . in the massless case @xcite , despite the coherence , we could treat plane waves as if particles effectively like in transmission , because the group velocity always accorded with the phase one . in such description of de facto particles , we could expect to see how a strange weak value ( superluminal velocity ) was avoided .. however , the appearance of such velocity would be noteworthy in dealing with plane waves only . ]",
    "considering the massive case , we have uncovered the difference between the transmission and the transition on this occasion .",
    "however , in both cases , it is common that a weak value determines the physics ( the transmission / transition probability ) by keeping the consistency of the velocity ( particles / waves ) .",
    "( @xmath91 ) and may transmit to iii , at the moment of which the velocity is given by a weak value .",
    "the average velocity of the steady flux of particles in i and iii comes from generating the weak value of the group velocity at the step .",
    "the consistency should be satisfied between these velocities .",
    "( b)unlike the transmission , a transition occurs all over the space with the coherence .",
    "then , the process described by a weak value represents the transition between the two wave functions of the energy eigenstates , which are illustrated by the sinusoidal curves . in this case",
    ", the weak value should be consistent with the average velocity of the waves .",
    "then , the phase velocity ( rather than the group velocity ) will be appropriate for such purpose , since they contain the property of the waves like the coherence . ]    as in the case of the massless particles , quantum states to be counted should satisfy @xmath92 , which gives , @xmath93 as a result , we can estimate the decreasing rate by the mass , @xmath94 with @xmath95 where @xmath96 is defined by @xmath97 . if we substitute @xmath10 into the above equations , the same result of equation ( [ eq : rate2_0 ] ) can be derived : the massive case contains the massless one , which is just obtained with @xmath10 .",
    "figure [ fig : result ] ( @xmath74 ) shows the numerical results of equation ( [ eq : rate_mass2 ] ) , which indicate that the decreasing rate by the mass in @xmath98 is proportional to @xmath97 and about corresponds to equation ( [ eq : i_rate_m ] ) .",
    "note that @xmath98 @xmath99 @xmath100 , in which the approximation of equation ( [ eq : i_rate_m ] ) is valid .    ) , normalized by the numerical values at @xmath101 . in any dimension , when @xmath98 , the decreasing rate is proportional to @xmath97 and agrees with equation ( [ eq : i_rate_m ] ) within the order . ]",
    "according to equation ( [ eq : qc_2 ] ) , @xmath102 is at most @xmath103 .",
    "then , the applicable scope of our model , namely , @xmath98 turns out to be @xmath104 which means that the mass energy is much smaller than the energy fluctuation , @xmath105 . in the massive case ,",
    "there is the mass energy gap between @xmath8 and @xmath9 ; the transition through the energy gap can be understood in the context of the landau - zener tunneling , which brings about the exponential decrease in the pair production rate as shown in equation ( [ eq : i_rate ] ) .",
    "it is plausible that such exponential decrease is approximated to the first order of @xmath97 , when the tunneling gap can be regarded as small enough to satisfy ( [ eq : cond_gap ] ) , which is achieved in the high electric field @xmath0 . in figure",
    "[ fig : result ] ( @xmath74 ) , the agreement in @xmath98 ensures that our model of the virtual transition gives us a new aspect to explain the exponential decreasing rate of the landau - zener tunneling in the high electric field as follows .",
    "mathematically the mass energy gap decreases the integral range in equation ( [ eq : rate2 m ] ) and , eventually , the number of quantum states to be counted , because the integrand in equation ( [ eq : rate2 m ] ) is same as the one in the massless case as shown in equation ( [ eq : rate2 ] ) .",
    "the decrease of the number depends on the electric field , which effectively determines the width of the tunnel ( gap ) caused by the mass energy : as the electric field becomes smaller , the width of the tunnel seems to be wider relatively .",
    "the decreasing rate of the landau - zener tunneling in the high electric field can be explained with such decreasing number of quantum states contributing to the pair productions .",
    "straightforwardly , we can apply the procedure mentioned in the previous section to the 3 + 1 dimensional case , in which the hamiltonian is given by @xmath106 with the uniform electric field @xmath0 in @xmath16 direction and @xmath107 , \\ \\ \\",

    "in 1 + 1 dimension , we will soon notice that we need to contrive the particular estimation due to the singularity of the massless pair production .",

    "<S> according to the schwinger mechanism , a uniform electric field brings about pair productions in vacuum ; the relationship between the production rate and the electric field is different , depending on the dimension of the system . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we make an offer of another model for the pair productions , in which weak values are incorporated : energy fluctuations trigger the pair production , and a weak value appears as the velocity of a particle there . </S>",
    "<S> although our model is only available for the approximation of the pair production rates , the weak value reveals a new aspect of the pair production . </S>",
    "<S> especially , within the first order , our estimation approximately agrees with the exponential decreasing rate of the landau - zener tunneling through the mass energy gap . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , such tunneling can be associated with energy fluctuations via the weak value , when the tunneling gap can be regarded as so small due to the high electric field . </S>"
