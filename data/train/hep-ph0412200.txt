    "the susy breaking triggers the electroweak symmetry breaking while stabilizing the higgs potential against the radiative corrections .    despite the great success in the gauge and higgs sectors ,",
    "the matter sector is problematic . with generic susy breaking terms in the lagrangian ,",
    "the prediction of small cp violation and flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) in the sm may be destroyed by the new interactions among the fermions and their scalar partners .",
    "the problems suggest the special features of the susy breaking , which are flavor blind and cp conserving .",
    "the gravitino , the susy partner of the graviton , also causes a problem in cosmology . in the gravity",
    "mediated susy breaking scenario , the gravitino mass is of the order of tev and it decays during big - bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) , destroying the successful prediction of the abundance of the light elements . in order to avoid the problem",
    ", the reheating temperature of the universe has to be lower than @xmath1  gev @xcite , which is too low for many baryogenesis scenarios with out - of - equilibrium decays of heavy particles .    an interesting possibility which solves all those problems automatically is the anomaly mediated susy breaking scenario @xcite .",
    "the anomaly mediation is the purely gravitational mediation mechanism of the susy breaking and is realized once the direct couplings between the hidden and visible sector fields are suppressed .",
    "the susy breaking only appears with the conformal anomaly of the theory and therefore it is insensitive to the ultraviolet ( uv ) physics and respect all the accidental symmetries in low energy such as cp and flavor conservation in the sm .",
    "moreover , the soft susy breaking terms are suppressed by the loop factor @xmath2 compared to the gravitino mass because of its quantum origin , and therefore the gravitino mass is naturally of @xmath3 .",
    "such a heavy gravitino decays before the bbn era , opening a window of baryogenesis at high temperatures @xcite .",
    "the uv insensitivity enables us to calculate all the susy breaking terms with known coupling constants .",
    "unfortunately , the high predictability immediately excludes the pure anomaly mediation since the scalar leptons turn out to be tachyonic .",
    "there have been several proposals to cure the problem .",
    "for example , to go off the trajectory of the anomaly mediation , one considers non - decoupling effects by using flat directions @xcite or low energy thresholds @xcite .",
    "the introduction of sm non - singlet particles which feel susy breaking directly from the hidden sector is shown to modify the spectrum through two - loop diagrams @xcite . also , attempts to modify the trajectory of the anomaly mediation itself by adding new interactions have been made @xcite . as modification of the initial conditions ,",
    "several kinds of scenario have been proposed such as inclusion of the k \" ahler anomaly @xcite , adding @xmath4-terms @xcite , and adding the boundary interactions in the extra - dimensional setup @xcite .",
    "the admixture of the gauge mediation and the anomaly mediation is recently considered in the context of the conformal sequestering scenario @xcite . among those various modifications , adding @xmath4-terms is clearly the safest since it has no danger of reintroductions of the cp or fcnc problems , and moreover it is shown to preserve the uv insensitivity which ensures the flavor blind and cp conserving soft terms in low energy even in the presence of the flavor changing or cp violating interactions in high energy  @xcite .",
    "once we realize the uv insensitive anomaly mediation by the @xmath4-term modification , the next step is to consider the electroweak symmetry breaking to see if it is possible to have the desired vacuum @xcite .",
    "when all the susy breaking terms are calculable , it is highly non - trivial to have the correct vacuum expectation values ( vev ) of the higgs fields . in ref.@xcite , it has been examined and found that the minimal susy standard model ( mssm ) does not have a stable vacuum unless the @xmath5 parameter , the ratio of two vevs of the higgs fields ( @xmath6 ) , is less than unity . in this case , the top - yukawa coupling constant is very large and blows up right above the stop mass scale .",
    "also , in the next to mssm ( nmssm ) the prediction to the higgsino mass is too small in all the region of the parameter space .",
    "it is caused by the fact that the singlet higgs field @xmath7 only has yukawa interactions which are asymptotically non - free .",
    "the soft mass squared is likely to be positive in that case , resulting in the small vev of @xmath7 .",
    "a successful model is found with linear term of the singlet field in the superpotential , which happens to be the low energy effective theory of the minimal susy fat higgs model @xcite .    in this paper , we reexamine the nmssm with @xmath4-term modified anomaly mediation by introducing additional vector - like quarks  @xcite .",
    "we find that the coupling between the singlet higgs field @xmath7 and the vector - like quarks can modify the anomalous dimension of @xmath7 significantly , and make the soft mass squared of @xmath7 small enough to acquire a large vev and thus there is no higgsino mass problem .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in the next section , we review the uv insensitive anomaly mediation .",
    "we discuss the problems in the mssm and nmssm with the uv insensitive anomaly mediation in section [ sec : ewsb ] .",
    "we extend the nmssm with additional vector - like matter fields and examine the electroweak symmetry breaking in section [ sec : vector ] , and discuss phenomenological and cosmological issues .",
    "section [ sec : conclusion ] is devoted to conclusions .",
    "anomaly mediation is realized once we obtain a sequestered k \" ahler potential in the supergravity action . since the fields in the visible sector can feel the susy breaking only through the gravitational interaction , the only source of the soft terms is the @xmath8-component of the gravity multiplet . in the superconformal formulation of the supergravity lagrangian",
    "@xcite , the @xmath8-component is the auxiliary component of the chiral compensator multiplet @xmath9 with which lagrangian possesses superconformal symmetry .",
    "the supergravity lagrangian is obtained by fixing the value of the components of @xmath9 which breaks the superconformal symmetry explicitly down to the super - poincar ' e symmetry .",
    "it is clear in this construction that the susy breaking appears only with the violation of the conformal symmetry . at the classical level , therefore , the soft scalar masses , the scalar cubic couplings ( @xmath10-terms ) , and the gaugino masses vanish , and all those terms appear at quantum level with conformal anomaly .",
    "explicitly , with the anomalous dimension @xmath11 of the chiral superfield @xmath12 and the beta function @xmath13 of the gauge interaction labeled by @xmath10 , soft terms at the scale @xmath14 are given by @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the yukawa and gauge coupling constants , respectively .",
    "the mass parameter @xmath18 is the gravitino mass which represents the @xmath8-component of the compensator multiplet .",
    "the above soft terms are defined by @xmath19 with @xmath20 and @xmath21 being the scalar component of @xmath12 and gauginos , respectively .",
    "of interest is that the soft terms at the scale @xmath14 are described by @xmath22 and @xmath23 at that scale and hence do not depend on the high energy physics .",
    "the uv insensitivity is a phenomenologically desirable feature since it solves the susy fcnc and cp problem automatically .",
    "it had been thought that sequestered khler potential is difficult to achieve in realistic model of quantum gravity .",
    "for instance , string theory tends to give rise to many moduli fields who can mediate additional supersymmetry breaking effects at the tree - level or one - loop level , which dominate over the anomaly - mediated contributions  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the absence of such fields was explicitly assumed .",
    "the physical separation of hidden and observable sectors along an extra dimension was used in ref .",
    "@xcite to justify the sequestered form of the khler potential .",
    "this , however , is not immune to the problem because there may be light bulk scalars such as radion . only recently",
    ", a concrete mechanism to fix all of the moduli fields was proposed  @xcite . moreover ,",
    "the physical separation was shown not necessary to achieve sequestered khler potential if the hidden sector is nearly conformal  @xcite , even though the hidden sector needs to be of a special type  @xcite . therefore achieving sequestered form of the khler potential does not appear to be an insurmountable problem any more .",
    "an obvious problem of the framework is the tachyonic sleptons .",
    "the contribution from the gauge interaction to the scalar masses @xmath24 is positive ( negative ) for asymptotically free ( non - free ) gauge interaction . since the sleptons only have su(2)@xmath25 and u(1)@xmath26 gauge interactions which are both asymptotically non - free , the scalar masses squared of the sleptons turn out to be negative with neglecting yukawa coupling constants of the leptons .",
    "however , we can easily solve the problem when we gauge the @xmath27 symmetry in the mssm @xcite .",
    "for example , if a u(1)@xmath28 gauge symmetry in the hidden sector acquire the @xmath4-term , the kinetic mixing term between u(1)@xmath28 and u(1)@xmath29 induces the @xmath4-term of u(1)@xmath29 .",
    "the @xmath4-term of u(1)@xmath26 may also be generated in the same way .",
    "remarkably those two @xmath4-terms can provide sufficiently large positive contributions for the scalar masses squared of both the left- and right - handed sleptons .",
    "moreover , the most significant feature is that the modification with @xmath4-terms preserves the uv insensitivity of the soft terms @xcite .",
    "the introduction of @xmath4-terms modifies the soft terms in the following way .",
    "@xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the hypercharge and the @xmath27 charge of the corresponding superfield .",
    "the gaugino masses and the @xmath10-terms are not modified . neglecting the yukawa coupling constants",
    ", we obtain the slepton masses as follows : @xmath33 @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the u(1)@xmath26 and su(2)@xmath25 gauge coupling constants , respectively , and @xmath37 .",
    "the additional @xmath4-term contributions are positive for both of the sleptons when @xmath38 .",
    "the @xmath4-terms can be obtained in a consistent way with grand unified theories ( gut ) , even though u(1)@xmath26 @xmath4-term becomes gauge non - singlet .",
    "for example , in so(10 ) grand unified theories , u(1)@xmath26 and u(1)@xmath29 are both subgroups of so(10 ) .",
    "the kinetic mixing terms between the u(1)@xmath28 gauge field and those u(1 ) s in this case are generated after the gut breaking assuming the presence of the following term : @xmath39 here , @xmath40 is a chiral superfield of 45 dimensional representation , which breaks so(10 ) into su(3)@xmath41 @xmath42 su(2)@xmath25 @xmath42 u(1)@xmath26 @xmath42 u(1)@xmath29 . provided the @xmath4-term of u(1)@xmath28 is generated at one - loop level , the above mixing induces the @xmath4-terms of u(1)@xmath26 and u(1)@xmath29 of the order of @xmath43 which is numerically similar size to the sfermion soft masses squared of @xmath44 .",
    "alternatively , in the models with orbifold unification @xcite , we can simply write down a kinetic mixing term between u(1)@xmath26 and u(1)@xmath29 gauge fields at the boundary .",
    "we now proceed to consider the electroweak symmetry breaking with the @xmath4-term modified anomaly mediation .",
    "whether we obtain correct vacuum is quite non - trivial since all the soft terms are calculable with known coupling constants .",
    "in ref.@xcite it has been shown that the correct vacuum ( correct @xmath45 boson mass ) is realized only when @xmath46 which causes the landau pole of the top - yukawa coupling constant just above the susy breaking scale .",
    "the problem is caused by the explicit violation of the conformal symmetry by the @xmath14-term , i.e. , @xmath47 . because it is a tree - level violation ,",
    "the @xmath48-term associated with the @xmath14-term is not suppressed by the loop factor and hence is large by a factor of @xmath49 compared to other soft terms .",
    "such a huge @xmath48-term requires large yukawa couplings to fine - tune the vev of the higgs fields by enhancing soft masses of @xmath50 and @xmath51 through eq.([eq : soft ] ) .",
    "there is a way of suppressing the @xmath48-term by using an accidental cancellation among different sources of the @xmath14- and @xmath48-terms .",
    "for example , if we have the following terms in the k \" ahler and the superpotential , @xmath52 the @xmath14- and @xmath48-terms from the susy breaking are given by @xmath53 since the relative sign between the two contributions is different for the @xmath14- and @xmath48-terms , there is a possibility to have small @xmath48-term by carefully tuning the @xmath54 and @xmath55 parameters . in this situation",
    ", we can think of the @xmath48-parameter as a free parameter .",
    "we plot in fig.[fig : b - tanbeta ] the @xmath48-parameter dependence of @xmath5 with fixing @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 .",
    "we have included the one - loop correction to the higgs potential from the ( s)top , ( s)bottom , and ( s)tau loop diagrams , and imposed the stability of all the scalar particles .",
    "for large @xmath59 , such as @xmath60 , we need a small value of @xmath5 so that the top - yukawa coupling constant gives large contribution to the higgs potential .",
    "the solutions with @xmath61 are found with small values of @xmath48 .",
    "therefore , even in the mssm , we could achieve the successful electroweak symmetry breaking with maintaining perturbativity up to the planck / gut scale at the expense of a fine - tuning of order @xmath62 in eq.([eq : mu_and_b ] ) .",
    "-parameter and @xmath5 is shown .",
    "we fixed the gravitino mass parameter ( @xmath63 ) to be 300gev and @xmath4-terms ( @xmath64 and @xmath65).,title=\"fig:\",height=245 ] -parameter and @xmath5 is shown .",
    "we fixed the gravitino mass parameter ( @xmath63 ) to be 300gev and @xmath4-terms ( @xmath64 and @xmath65).,title=\"fig:\",height=245 ]    unfortunately , the model has a potential danger to introduce a new cp phase since @xmath54 and @xmath55 are independent complex parameters .",
    "although the reintroduction of the susy cp problem upsets the motivation of the uv insensitive anomaly mediation , there is an interesting observation . as we discuss",
    "later in sec .",
    "[ sec : strongcp ] , the anomaly mediation is a good framework for solving the strong cp problem by the scenario of the spontaneous cp violation @xcite . since the scenario assumes the exact cp invariance in the lagrangian , @xmath54 and @xmath55 are real parameters if the fields which break the cp invariance do not couple with the higgs fields . in this sense",
    ", we claim that the mssm is a viable model with the uv insensitive anomaly mediation once we obtain small @xmath48-parameters .",
    "apart from the benefit of providing a solution to the @xmath14-problem , the extension to the nmssm is well - motivated in the context since the conformal symmetry is not violated at tree level , and hence there is no complication caused by the @xmath66 enhanced soft parameters .",
    "the superpotential of the higgs sector in the nmssm is given by @xmath67 where @xmath7 is the gauge singlet higgs field whose vev plays a role of the @xmath14-parameter in the mssm .",
    "the electroweak symmetry breaking in the nmssm is , however , not successful since the effective @xmath14-parameter of @xmath68 is too small ( at most a few gev ) , resulting in unacceptably light higgsinos  @xcite .",
    "the problem is caused by the positivity of the soft mass squared for the singlet higgs @xmath69 .",
    "the @xmath69 parameter is given by the formula : @xmath70 ignoring the su(2)@xmath25 and u(1)@xmath26 gauge interactions , @xmath21 and @xmath71 are asymptotically non - free , and thus @xmath72 is positive .",
    "the positivity indicates the stability of the origin of the potential , and therefore the vev of @xmath7 is only induced by the small shift of the origin through the linear term @xmath73 in the potential .",
    "although the linear term can be enhanced by increasing the coupling @xmath21 and/or @xmath71 , it is of no help since that also enhances @xmath72 .",
    "having understood the problems in the mssm and the nmssm , we now consider a model with vector - like matter fields .",
    "the problem in the nmssm is caused by the high predictability of the anomaly mediation .",
    "the soft terms are calculable once we fix a model .",
    "particularly the large positive @xmath72 parameter is problematic if we assume the minimal interactions .",
    "however , the interactions of @xmath7 are phenomenologically unknown and we can easily modify the soft terms of the singlet . as an example , we consider a model with vector - like matter fields which couple to the @xmath7 field .    a similar model has been considered in ref.@xcite in the context of the anomaly mediation without @xmath4-terms .",
    "it was pointed out that the calculability of the soft terms still makes the electroweak symmetry breaking difficult even in the presence of @xmath7 and extra vector - like fields by the following reason .",
    "the @xmath5 parameter is determined by the difference between two soft masses of the higgs doublets , @xmath74 and @xmath75 , which only depends on the top yukawa coupling constant @xmath76 in that model .",
    "therefore , the top - quark mass @xmath77 is predicted rather than an input parameter .",
    "unfortunately , successful electroweak symmetry breaking turns out to require unacceptably small @xmath78 such as less than 145  gev .",
    "they discussed a further extension of the model to overcome the situation by introducing three extra singlet superfields and appropriate interaction terms .",
    "in contrast , we show that the correct vacua are easily found in the model with @xmath4-terms .",
    "since @xmath57 contributes to @xmath74 and @xmath75 with opposite signs , we do not have the unwanted correlation between @xmath5 and @xmath76 anymore .",
    "we can find phenomenologically viable parameter regions without introducing extra singlets except for @xmath7 .",
    "we introduce a pair of new chiral superfields @xmath4 and @xmath79 which have quantum numbers of @xmath80 and @xmath81 under the sm gauge group , and also @xmath82 and @xmath83 of @xmath84 and @xmath85 so that the extra matter fields form complete su(5 ) representations @xmath86 to ensure the gauge coupling unification .",
    "we can write down the following superpotential : @xmath87 the introduction of the interactions between @xmath7 and vector - like matter fields does not cause a new cp violation , since the coupling constants @xmath21 , @xmath71 , @xmath88 , and @xmath89 can be made real without loss of generality by appropriate field redefinitions . we do not assume the presence of the direct couplings of @xmath4 and @xmath82 with the ordinary quarks and leptons , which may be forbidden by a u(1 ) symmetry or its discrete subgroup under which only the vector - like matter fields transform .",
    "the additional interactions in eq.([eq : superp ] ) modify the @xmath72 parameter from eq.([eq : mssq ] ) to ( see appendix for the rges ) @xmath90 since @xmath88 is asymptotically free in a wide range of parameter space due to the strong interaction of @xmath4 and @xmath79 , the negative contribution may make @xmath69 negative and large in its absolute value such that we obtain large values of @xmath91 .",

    "since the @xmath0 symmetry , under which all the chiral superfields has a unit charge , is anomalous with respect to the su(3)@xmath41 gauge group , the instanton effect can give a sufficient energy shift among domains such that the domain wall is unstable  @xcite .",
    "related to this issue , there is a problem of the instability of the higgs potential caused by a loop correction associated with the susy breaking effect .",
    "the tadpole diagrams of @xmath7 with gravitational interactions diverge quadratically , and reintroduce the hierarchy problem  @xcite .",
    "the appearance of the linear term can be forbidden if the gravitational interaction respects the @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "it is , however , argued that the quantum gravity violates all the global symmetry .",
    "since the @xmath0 symmetry is anomalous , we can not think of the symmetry as a gauge symmetry , and thus it is expected to be broken at the planck scale .    although it may not be a problem once we understand quantum gravity , it is possible to control the tadpole divergence by embedding @xmath0 to a higher anomaly free symmetry @xmath179 such that the @xmath0 symmetry is realized as an accidental approximate symmetry after breaking of @xmath179 .",
    "for example , the @xmath179 symmetry , under which all the chiral superfields have charge @xmath180 , can be made anomaly free when we add @xmath180 pairs of vector - like quarks @xmath181 and @xmath182 which have the same quantum numbers as @xmath4 and @xmath79 under the sm gauge group and charge @xmath183 under @xmath179 .",
    "when the @xmath179 symmetry is broken spontaneously by the vev of a field @xmath184 which has @xmath179 charge 2 , the vector - like fields acquire the mass of the order of @xmath185 and decouple from the low - energy physics if the vev is much larger than the electroweak scale .",
    "the mass term of the vector - like quarks @xmath4 and @xmath79 or the @xmath14-term given through the vev of @xmath184 is naturally small by the @xmath179 symmetry , because it restricts the form of the lowest dimensional interaction to be @xmath186 where @xmath187 or @xmath188 for even or odd @xmath180 , respectively .",
    "the tadpole term in the lagrangian is also suppressed as @xmath189 , which can be small enough .",
    "also , the @xmath179 symmetry may naturally forbids the large mixing between ordinary quarks @xmath190 and @xmath79 .",
    "for example , if the @xmath179 charges of @xmath4 and @xmath79 are @xmath191 and @xmath192 , respectively , the mixing is naturally suppressed by the @xmath179 breaking effect .",
    "the small but finite mixing makes the vector - like fields unstable , which ensures the absence of the problem with overclosure of the universe @xcite .",

    "the susy fcnc and cp problems are solved thanks to the uv insensitivity of the anomaly mediation .",
    "also , the strong cp phase is not induced by the susy breaking effect once we set vanishing @xmath169 at tree level , which is claimed to be natural in the string theory context @xcite .",
    "the lightest neutralino is the wino which is a good candidate of the cold dark matter assuming the non - thermal production from the gravitino decay .",
    "the thermal leptogenesis works without contradicting the constraint on the gravitino abundance from the bbn theory , since the gravitino decays before the bbn era .",
    "there is no cosmological domain wall problem associated with the spontaneous @xmath0 symmetry breaking in the nmssm because the @xmath0 symmetry is broken by the qcd instanton effect in the presence of the vector - like quarks .",
