    "there is a paradox in the definition of the habitable zone with respect to the presence of liquid water .",
    "imagine a planet at the right distance from a star to have stable liquid water on its surface , supported by a modest greenhouse effect .",
    "nebular models and meteorite data suggest that the local environment during the formation of this planet was sufficiently hot to prevent hydration of the planetesimals and protoplanets out of which the planet was formed ( morbidelli et al . , 2000 ) .",
    "that is , the local building blocks of this `` habitable '' planet were devoid of water .",
    "how , then , could this planet acquire water and become truly habitable ?",
    "delivery of water - laden planetesimals from colder regions of the disk is one solution , but it implies that the habitability of extrasolar planets depends on the details of their final assembly , with implications for the abundance of habitable planets available for terrestrial planet finder ( tpf ) to discover .    in the current paradigm of planet formation four dynamically distinct stages are envisioned ( lissauer , 1993 ) :    * initial stage : * grains condense and grow in the hot nebular disk , gradual settling to the mid - plane . the composition of the grains is determined by the local temperature of the nebula .",
    "gravitational instability among the grains is resisted owing to continuous stirring by convective and turbulent motions .",
    "* early stage : * growth of grains to km - sized planetesimals occurs via pairwise accretion in the turbulent disk .",
    "planetesimals initially have low eccentricities ( @xmath3 ) and inclinations ( @xmath4 ) due to gas drag .    * middle stage ",
    "oligarchic growth : * `` focused merging '' leads to agglomeration of planetesimals into moon - to mars - sized `` planetary embryos .",
    "'' possible runaway accretion and subsequent energy equipartition ( dynamical friction ) may lead to polarization of the mass distribution : a few large bodies with low @xmath3 and @xmath4 in a swarm of much smaller planetesimals with high @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the timescale for this process correlates inversely with heliocentric distance .",
    "simulations of oligarchic growth by kokubo & ida ( 2000 ) suggest that planetary embryos form in @xmath5 1 myr at 1 au , in @xmath640 myr at 5 au , and in @xmath7 300 myr past 10 au .",
    "since the giant planets are constrained to have formed within 10 myr , embryos could only have formed in the innermost solar system within that time .",
    "thus , we expect that at the time of the formation of jupiter , the inner terrestrial region was dominated by @xmath6 30 - 50 planetary embryos while the asteroid belt consisted of a large number of @xmath61 km planetesimals .",
    "* late stage : * once runaway accretion has terminated due to lack of slow moving material , planetary embryos and planetesimals gradually evolve into crossing orbits as a result of cumulative gravitational perturbations .",
    "this leads to radial mixing and giant impacts until only a few survivors remain .",
    "the timescale for this process is @xmath8 yr .",
    "until recently , a leading hypothesis for the origin of earth s water was the `` late veneer '' scenario , in which the earth formed primarily from local material , and acquired its water at later times from a large number of cometary impacts .",
    "the d / h ratio of three comets has been measured to be 12 times higher than the protosolar value ( balsiger et al . , 1995 ; meier et al . , 1998",
    "; bockelee - morvan et al.,1998 ) , and roughly twice as high as the terrestrial oceanic ( roughly the chondritic ) value . at most",
    "10% of the earth s water came from a cometary source .",
    "morbidelli et al .",
    "( 2000 ) proposed that the bulk of the earth s water may have come from the asteroid belt in the form of planetary embryos .",
    "the proto - earth accreted several embryos from outside its local region , including a few from past 2.5 au , which delivered the bulk of the earth s water . in this model",
    "the earth accreted water since its formation , in the form of an early bombardment of asteroids and comets , a few large `` wet '' planetary embryos , and continual impacts of small bodies over long timescales .",
    "this scenario explains the d / h ratio of earth s water in the context of late - stage planetary accretion .",
    "morbidelli et al .",
    "( 2000 ) assumed that oligarchic growth took place throughout the inner solar system , with planetary embryos out to 4 au .",
    "this neglects jupiter s strong gravitational influence on the oligarchic growth process in the asteroid belt , as well as planetesimal - embryo interactions .",
    "several other authors ( e.g. chambers 2001 ; chambers & cassen 2002 ) subsequently have numerically formed terrestrial planets , including both planetary embryos and planetesimals in their simulations .",
    "their initial conditions often seem _ ad hoc _ , and not based on the state of the protoplanetary disk at the end of oligarchic growth , in particular the radial dependence of the planetary embryo formation timescale .    chambers ( 2003 ) used a statistical pik - arnold method to test planet formation in a number of scenarios , including some which are similar to those we present in this paper .",
    "the advantage of his statistical method is its low computational expense relative to n - body simulations , allowing the quick exploration of a large parameter space .",
    "its drawback is the difficulty of implementing realistic dynamics .",
    "therefore , n - body simulations like those we present here may be used to `` calibrate '' , and thereby complement the statistical simulations .    in this paper",
    ", we characterize the process of terrestrial planet formation and volatile delivery as a function of several parameters of the protoplanetary system .",
    "our initial conditions attempt to realistically describe the protoplanetary disk at the beginning of late - stage accretion .",
    "we do not limit ourselves to our own solar system , and focus on the formation of planets within the habitable zone of their parent stars .",
    "the parameters we vary in our simulations are ( i ) jupiter s mass ,",
    "( ii ) eccentricity , ( iii ) semimajor axis and ( iv ) time of formation , ( v ) the density in solids of the protoplanetary disk and ( vi ) the location of the snow line .",
    "section 2 describes our initial conditions and numerical methods .",
    "section 3 presents our results , which are discussed in section 4 , including application to the nasa s terrestrial planet finder ( tpf ) mission .",
    "section 5 concludes the paper .",
    "the timescale for the formation of planetary embryos from planetesimals correlates with heliocentric distance ( kokubo & ida 2000 ) .",
    "we wish to accurately describe the state of the protoplanetary disk at the time when jupiter formed .",
    "( note that we use the term `` jupiter '' to represent the gas giant planet in each planetary system , the majority of which differ from our solar system . )",
    "we assume that oligarchic growth has taken place in the inner solar system , from 0.5 au to the 3:1 mean motion resonance with jupiter , located at 2.5 au in our solar system .",
    "the timescale for embryos to form out to 2.5 au is roughly 10 myr , which is also the upper bound for jupiter formation ( briceno et al . ,",
    "2001 ) . past the 3:1 resonance",
    ", we expect the gravitational influence of jupiter to perturb the oligarchic growth process , through the clearing out of resonances and other dynamical excitation of planetesimals .    between the 3:1 resonance and jupiter we assume that the mass in solids is in the form of planetesimals .",
    "since we are computationally limited to a small number of particles ( @xmath6 200 ) we can not accurately represent the billions of planetesimals in this region .",
    "we treat this problem in two ways : ( i ) all the mass in the asteroid belt is divided into n `` super - planetesimals '' with m@xmath9 = m@xmath10/n , where m@xmath10 is the total mass in the region .",
    "( ii ) the planetesimal mass is fixed at 0.01 earth masses ( m@xmath11 ) . in both cases",
    "the number of planetesimals is @xmath6150 , and they are distributed as n @xmath12 r@xmath13 , corresponding to the annular mass in a disk with surface density @xmath14 r@xmath15 . in case ( i ) , the entire mass in the region ( m@xmath10 ) is accounted for , but the `` planetesimals '' have masses @xmath6 0.1 m@xmath11 ( @xmath16 m@xmath17 ) . in case ( ii ) , the planetesimal masses are somewhat more realistic , but we do not account for the entire mass inventory in the region . case ( i ) will provide a rough upper limit on the mass in volatiles delivered to the terrestrial planets , while case ( ii ) corresponds to a lower limit .",
    "case ( ii ) only accounts for @xmath6 10% of the mass in the asteroid region , as predicted by eq.(1 ) .",
    "therefore , these simulations are also a test of the effects of the surface density past the snow line on the forming terrestrial planets and their composition .",
    "we use a two - tiered surface density profile similar to kokubo & ida ( 2000 ) , which reflects an increase in surface density due to the condensation of water immediately past the snow line :    @xmath18    the `` feeding zone '' of a planetary embryo is an annulus with width comparable to the embryo s hill radius ,    @xmath19    where a is the embryo s semimajor axis , m is its mass , and m@xmath20 is the solar mass .",
    "the mass in the feeding zone of an embryo is    @xmath21    assuming that the mass of an embryo is proportional to the mass in the feeding zone , it follows from the surface density profile in eq.(1 ) that the mass of a planetary embryo m@xmath22 @xmath23 .",
    "simulations of the formation of embryos from planetesimals ( kokubo & ida 2000 ) show that they typically form with separations of 5 - 10 mutual hill radii , rather than immediately adjacent to each other in heliocentric distance , where the mutual hill radius of bodies 1 and 2 is defined as    @xmath24    we therefore space the planetary embryos inside the 3:1 resonance by @xmath25 mutual hill radii ( i.e. @xmath26 = @xmath27 + @xmath25r@xmath28 ) , with @xmath25 varying randomly between 5 and 10 .",
    "so the mass of an embryo increases as    @xmath29    a snowline at 2.5 au corresponds , by coincidence , to the location of the 3:1 resonance for a jupiter at 5.2 au .",
    "this implies that , in our solar system , the local surface density increase at the snowline implied by eq.(1 ) is not reflected in the masses of planetary embryos , as they only form interior to the snow line .",
    "if jupiter s semimajor axis is less than 5.2 au the situation is the same , as the 3:1 resonance is located interior to the snowline .",
    "however , if jupiter s orbit is larger than 5.2 au , then the 3:1 resonance is exterior to the snowline , and there is a region in which oligarchic growth has taken place in a high density environment .",
    "this results in the formation of what we call `` super embryos '' , which can have masses as large as 2 m@xmath11 .",
    "these large icy bodies probably did not form in our solar system , but their dynamical presence can affect terrestrial planet formation interior to their orbits ( see section 3 ) .    in our simulations , we vary the following parameters :    1 .   the semimajor axis of jupiter s orbit : @xmath30 = 4 , 5.2 or 7 au .",
    "2 .   jupiter s mass : m@xmath31 = 10 m@xmath11 , 1/3 m@xmath32 , m@xmath32 or 3 m@xmath32 , where m@xmath32 is jupiter s real mass of 318 earth masses .",
    "the eccentricity of jupiter s orbit : @xmath33 = 0 , 0.1 , or 0.2 . 4 .   the location of the snow line : 2 or 2.5 au .",
    "a snowline at 2 au results in the formation of `` super embryos '' for jupiter at 5.2 au .",
    "the surface density of solids : @xmath34 = 8 - 10 g @xmath35 , @xmath36 = 3 - 4 g @xmath35 . note that the minimum mass solar nebula has @xmath34 = 6 g @xmath35 .",
    "the planetesimal mass ( exterior to the 3:1 resonance ) : m@xmath9 = m@xmath10/n@xmath9 or m@xmath9 = 0.01 m@xmath11 , where n@xmath9 = 150 .",
    "the time of jupiter formation : jupiter forms at t=0 , or starts as a 10 m@xmath11 seed whose mass increases to m@xmath37 at t = 10 myr .",

    "although in this paper we track the dynamical history of planetesimals for a given set of giant planet orbital parameters , our model is not capable of determining the water content of the planetesimals versus semi - major axis , in part because this is determined long before the stage at which planetesimals grow to the size of the moon or larger .",
    "however , it should be said that even nebular models concerned with earlier stages of planetesimal growth lack the fidelity to create _",
    "ab initio _ a reliable map of water content versus semi - major axis . in this paper",
    "we assume a distribution of water content versus semi - major axis for the planetesimals , in all of our model systems , based on the meteorite data for our own solar system .",
    "the stochastic delivery of water to the terrestrial planets that is one of the main conclusions of this paper argues against any more detailed attempt to scale the water abundance for any given system according to disk parameters , for the resulting delivery of water will remain stochastic .",
    "figure  [ fig : lun1 ] gives the range of water content , by mass , of three types of chondritic meteorites compared to an estimate for the earth .",
    "carbonaceous chondrites are the most water rich of meteorites , with water content up to nearly 10% by mass .",
    "the ordinary chondrites are significantly lower , roughly by an order of magnitude , and the enstatite chondrites are somewhat lower still ( abe et al .",
    "the locations within our solar system from which the parent bodies of the meteorites were derived is highly uncertain , though it is generally thought that the carbonaceous chondrites came from the region beyond 2.5 au , while the ordinary and enstatite chondrites were formed further inward .",
    "earth , for which no primitive counterpart exists in the meteorite record discovered to date ( drake and righter 2002 ) , is quite dry with a water content around 0.03 - 0.1% by mass ( abe et al .",
    "much of this may have been added from planetesimals at larger semi - major axes than 1 au ( morbidelli et al .",
    "2000 ) , consistent with the dynamical results we present below . also , the lunar - forming impactor appears to have been extremely dry , with water content much less than that of the earth ( abe et al .",
    "hence , planetesimals at 1 au could have been orders of magnitude dryer than the water content of the earth today .",
    "hydration of the silicates in meteorites is thought to have occurred inside a parent body rather than in the solar nebula , due to the very long hydration timescales in the solar nebula ( fegley , jr . , 2000 ) .",
    "this implies that hydrated bodies could only form by accreting ice , which then reacted as liquid water with the anhydrous minerals when sufficiently heated ( by radioactive , frictional or collisional heating ) .",
    "the current distribution of water - rich vs dry classes of asteroids may be a record of the position of the snow line in the solar nebula ( neglecting possible orbital migration of asteroids ) . as mentioned above",
    ", this division occurs at roughly 2 - 2.5 au in our solar system , and corresponds to a nebular temperature of @xmath6 180 k. a density increase immediately past the snow line is expected due to the `` cold trap '' effect ( stevenson & lunine , 1988 ) , and is expressed in equation ( 1 ) .    as a baseline , we divide each of the planetary systems into three regions according to water content - planetesimals beyond 2.5au have 5% water by mass , those inward of 2 au have water content of 0.001% by mass , and between 2 - 2.5 au lie planetesimals with intermediate water content of 0.1% by mass .",
    "this distribution of water among the planetesimals can be seen in the first panel of the accretion simulations we show below ( fig .",
    "[ fig : aet1 ] , for example ) .",
    "the results of our calculations are such that the intermediate planetesimal class , in terms of water content , does not affect the overall conclusions regarding delivery of water to earth .",
    "thus , one can think of the simulations as positing two regions  one water - rich beyond 2 - 2.5 au and one water poor inward of that  and then following through the collisional history of the planetesimals the delivery of water to the final few terrestrial planets remaining at the end of each simulation .",
    "we integrate all simulations for 200 myr using mercury ( chambers 1999 ) .",
    "we use the hybrid integrator , which uses a second - order mixed variable symplectic algorithm when objects are separated by more than 3 hill radii , and a burlisch - stoer method for closer encounters .",
    "we use a 6 day timestep , in order to have 15 timesteps per orbit for the innermost orbits in our initial conditions at 0.5 au .",
    "our simulations conserve energy to better than 1 part in 10@xmath38 , and angular momentum to 1 part in 10@xmath39 .",
    "collisions conserve linear momentum and do not take fragmentation into account .",
    "these simulations were run on desktop pcs , each taking roughly 1 month of cpu time on a 700 mhz machine .",
    "the three simulations with m@xmath37 = 10 m@xmath11 each required 4 - 6 months of cpu time .",
    "in this section we first discuss the details of one simulation , describing the physical processes which apply to all of our simulations .",
    "we then show the dependences of the terrestrial planets we form on planetary system parameters , and statistically examine the terrestrial planets which have formed .",

    "the mean water mass fraction of the planets formed in all case ( i ) simulations is 1.7@xmath010@xmath41 vs 4@xmath010@xmath42 for all case ( ii ) simulations .",
    "the average planet mass for case ( i ) is 1.8 @xmath2 vs 0.9 @xmath2 for case ( ii ) .",
    "the mean number of planets per simulation for case ( i ) is 2.5 vs 3.2 for case ( ii ) , and the total mass in terrestrial planets is 4 @xmath2 for case ( i ) vs 2.7 @xmath2 for case ( ii ) .",
    "the mean eccentricities of all terrestrial planets for case ( i ) is 0.14 , vs 0.10 for case ( ii ) .",
    "* surface density : * the effects of surface density should be similar to those of the planetesimal mass .",
    "however , since we have only covered a relatively small range in values of @xmath43 and @xmath36 in these simulations , the direct effects are negligible compared with the effects of the planetesimal mass and the stochastic `` noise '' inherent to the simulations .    * jupiter s mass : * a jovian planet of larger mass forms a smaller number of terrestrial planets than a lower - mass body .",
    "the masses of the terrestrial planets increase slightly with the mass of the jovian planet , but this is a small effect compared with the effects of the planetesimal mass . in our 30 case ( ii )",
    "simulations , the total mass incorporated in terrestrial planets is roughly constant with m@xmath31 at @xmath6 2.5 @xmath2 , 25% higher than in our solar system .",
    "the water content of the terrestrial planets does not vary significantly with m@xmath31 .",
    "the number of surviving bodies at the end of the 200 myr integration ( which includes planets and remnant planetesimals and planetary embryos ) increases sharply at small jupiter masses , with an average of 54 for a 10 @xmath2 jupiter .",
    "since the algorithm used in mercury scales with the number of bodies , @xmath44 , as @xmath45 , this explains the large increase in computational expense for the 10 @xmath2 jupiter simulations compared with those with a more massive gas giant .",

    "jupiter s semimajor axis : * we see a weak correlation between higher water content in terrestrial planets and jupiter s semimajor axis . in the case of a jupiter at 4 au , there is simply a smaller reservoir of volatile - rich material between the snow line and jupiter as compared with a system with @xmath30 = 5.2 au , resulting in drier planets . in the case of a jupiter at 7 au",
    ", this reservoir is much larger .",
    "however , as jupiter s zone of influence is at larger heliocentric distances , there is a larger change in energy required to deliver volatile - rich planetesimals to the terrestrial region .",
    "in addition , the super embryos which form between the snowline and the 3:1 jupiter resonance present a dynamical obstacle for inward - bound planetesimals . as a result ,",
    "the innermost terrestrial planet is completely dry in four out of seven simulations with @xmath30 = 7 au , in which the mean water mass fraction of all planets formed inside 1 au is 1.7@xmath010@xmath42 , and 3.8@xmath010@xmath41 for planets which formed between 1 and 2 au .",
    "this is not unexpected , as super embryos immediately past the snowline at 2.5 au can act as accretion seeds and occasionally migrate inside 2 au , resulting in massive ( 1.5 to 3 + @xmath2 ) planets in the proximity of mars current orbit .    * the position of the snow line : *",
    "the most important consequence of a snowline at 2 au rather than 2.5 au is that it lies inside the 3:1 resonance with a jupiter at 5.2 au , resulting in the formation of super embryos in the annulus between 2 and 2.5 au . as mentioned above , these can act as an obstacle to inward - diffusing planetesimals .",
    "however , in four simulations with the snowline at 2 au we see little difference in the terrestrial planets .",
    "we intend to explore this region of parameter space in more detail in future work .",
    "* time of jupiter formation : * we see no significant physical differences between the terrestrial planets in simulations with a 10 @xmath2 jupiter seed which grew to full size at 10 myr and those which began with a full size jupiter .",

    "table 2 summarizes the results of the water added to terrestrial planets within a semi - major axis range of 0.8 - 1.5 au from the parent star .",
    "this is larger than the so - called `` continuously habitable zone '' ( chz ) defined as the semi - major axis realm for which a planet s mean surface temperature will be above the water melting point , but not so high as to allow loss of water by evaporation and subsequent photolysis ( kasting et al .",

    "a better constraint would be the search space planned for the terrestrial planet finder ( nasa ) and darwin ( esa ) programs designed to detect and characterize earths around other stars ( see part 4 ) .",
    "this search space , for a solar - mass star such as that which we are considering here , ranges from 1.5 au ( the orbit of mars in our solar system ) to as close as 0.7 au ( venus orbit ) for a subset of the stars on the search list .",

    "while efforts are being made to design the systems to detect earths in as broad a range of semi - major axes as possible , detection of an earth - sized planet in a venus - like orbit at 0.7 au from a solar - type star may pose special problems in nulling - out or blocking the light of the parent star . however , the results we show in table 2 suggest that there will be many such candidates in venus - like orbits , and hence a complete census of terrestrial planets in venus - to - mars - sized orbits remains a desirable goal .",
    "most significant among our results is the robustness of terrestrial planet formation .",
    "this has been shown previously for starting positions of the giant planets akin to our solar system ( chambers & cassen 2002 ) , and we have extended the results by including giant planets over a wide range of masses and a range of orbits commensurate with terrestrial planet stability but varying significantly from the solar system situation . while terrestrial planet formation  that part of the process in which lunar - to - mars - sized bodies are cleaned up to form a few earth - sized planets ",
    "is stochastic , it still leads to planets familiar to us in terms of size and position .",
    "of course , one can start with initial conditions so different from our solar system that predominantly smaller or larger planets result , and indeed if residual nebular gas is included in the simulation , numerous mars size bodies replace the handful of earth - size objects ( kominami and ida , 2002 ) .",
    "but in the coarse view , it seems easy to make terrestrial planets and hence the tpf / darwin projects ought to assume a high likelihood of terrestrial planets around solar - type stars for which giant planets are not so close as to induce orbital instability .",

    "<S> we present results from 42 simulations of late stage planetary accretion , focusing on the delivery of volatiles ( primarily water ) to the terrestrial planets . </S>",
    "<S> our simulations include both planetary `` embryos '' ( defined as moon to mars sized protoplanets ) and planetesimals , assuming that the embryos formed via oligarchic growth . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate volatile delivery as a function of jupiter s mass , position and eccentricity , the position of the snow line , and the density ( in solids ) of the solar nebula .    in all simulations , we form 1 - 4 terrestrial planets inside 2 au , which vary in mass and volatile content . in 42 simulations </S>",
    "<S> we have formed 43 planets between 0.8 and 1.5 au , including 11 `` habitable '' planets between 0.9 and 1.1 au . </S>",
    "<S> these planets range from dry worlds to `` water worlds '' with 100 + oceans of water ( 1 ocean = 1.5 @xmath0 10@xmath1 g ) , and vary in mass between 0.23@xmath2 and 3.85 @xmath2 .    </S>",
    "<S> there is a good deal of stochastic noise in these simulations , but the most important parameter is the planetesimal mass we choose , which reflects the surface density in solids past the snow line . </S>",
    "<S> a high density in this region results in the formation of a smaller number of terrestrial planets with larger masses and higher water content , as compared with planets which form in systems with lower densities .    </S>",
    "<S> we find that an eccentric jupiter produces drier terrestrial planets with higher eccentricities than a circular one . in cases with jupiter at 7 au , we form what we call `` super embryos , '' 1 - 2 @xmath2 protoplanets which can serve as the accretion seeds for 2 + @xmath2 planets with large water contents .    * </S>",
