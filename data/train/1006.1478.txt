    "the rapid neutron - capture process ( r process ) is considered as the main nucleosynthesis mechanism responsible for the production of heavy neutron - rich nuclei and for the existence of about half of the nuclei heavier than iron @xcite .",
    "although the astrophysical sites for this process are still controversial , it takes place in scenarios characterized by very high neutron densities .",
    "the path that nucleosynthesis follows involves neutron - rich isotopes , which can be far away from the valley of @xmath0-stability . the most relevant nuclear properties to describe the r process are the nuclear masses and the @xmath0-decay properties @xcite namely , the @xmath0-decay half - lives ( @xmath1 ) and the @xmath0-delayed neutron - emission probabilities ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "nuclear masses define the possible r - process paths near the neutron drip - lines .",
    "the @xmath1 values of r - process waiting - point nuclei determine the pre freeze - out isotopic abundances and the speed of the process towards heavier elements , as well as the r - process time scale .",
    "the @xmath2 values of r - process isobaric nuclei define the decay path towards stability following the freeze - out , and provide a source of late - time neutrons",
    ".    a reliable nuclear physics description of the properties of the extremely neutron - rich nuclei along the r - process path is needed to interpret the astrophysical observations and to model and simulate properly the r process .",
    "the quality of the nucleosynthesis modeling is directly affected by the quality of the nuclear structure input . unfortunately , most of the nuclear properties of relevance for the r process are experimentally unknown , although much effort is being done recently , and therefore theoretical predictions must be considered .",
    "such calculations are particularly challenging in the very exotic regions of interest , since they involve extrapolations using well established nuclear - structure models that have been properly tuned to account mostly for the properties of nuclei in the valley of stability .",
    "in particular , the shell structure of neutron - rich drip - line nuclei is still unknown to a large extent .",
    "significant isospin dependence of shell effects in medium - mass and heavy nuclei has been predicted @xcite .",
    "it has been found that the shell gaps dramatically decrease near the neutron drip - lines because of continuum effects and a quenching of shell effects is apparent .    as a matter of fact , nuclear structure properties of nuclei far from stability where no experiments exist for direct comparison ,",
    "can be tested by exploring their influence on the solar r - process abundance patterns . as an example , the agreement with the observed r - process abundances in the @xmath3 mass region is manifestly improved @xcite when using nuclear structure models that include a shell quenching effect at @xmath4 @xcite .    in this work",
    "we focus our attention on the mass region of neutron - rich @xmath5 nuclei , which is of great interest for the astrophysical r process .",
    "in addition , neutron - rich isotopes in this mass region are known @xcite to be interesting examples where the equilibrium shape of the nucleus is rapidly changing and shape coexistence is present with competing prolate , oblate , and spherical shapes at close energies ( see e.g. @xcite for a general review ) .    in a recent publication @xcite ,",
    "the @xmath0-decay properties of some neutron - rich zr and mo isotopes were measured for the first time .",
    "the data were interpreted in terms of the quasiparticle random - phase approximation ( qrpa ) @xcite , using nuclear shapes and nuclear masses derived from the finite - range droplet model ( frdm ) @xcite and the latest version of the finite - range liquid - drop model ( frldm ) @xcite , which also includes triaxial deformation .",
    "qrpa calculations for neutron - rich nuclei have also been performed within different approaches , such as the hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) @xcite , continuum qrpa with either the extended thomas - fermi plus strutinsky integral ( etfsi ) method @xcite or based on density functionals @xcite , and the relativistic mean field ( rmf ) approach @xcite , just to mention some of the recent publications , all of them for spherical nuclei .",
    "however , the mass region of concern here requires nuclear deformation as a relevant degree of freedom to characterize the nuclear structure involved in the calculation of the @xmath0-strength functions . the deformed qrpa formalism has been developed in refs .",
    "@xcite , where phenomenological mean fields based on nilsson or woods - saxon potentials were used as a starting basis . in this work",
    "we investigate the decay properties of neutron - rich even - even zr and mo isotopes within a deformed self - consistent hartree - fock ( hf ) mean field formalism with skyrme interactions and pairing correlations in bcs approximation .",
    "residual spin - isospin interactions are also included in the particle - hole and particle - particle channels and are treated in qrpa @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] a brief review of the theoretical formalism is presented .",
    "[ results ] contains the results obtained within this approach for the potential energy curves , gamow - teller ( gt ) strength distributions , and @xmath0-decay half - lives .",
    "iv summarizes the main conclusions .",
    "in this section we show briefly the theoretical framework used in this paper to describe the @xmath0-decay properties in zr and mo neutron - rich isotopes .",
    "more details of the formalism can be found in refs .",
    "the method consists of a self - consistent formalism based on a deformed hartree - fock mean field obtained with skyrme interactions , including pairing correlations .",
    "the single - particle energies , wave functions , and occupation probabilities are generated from this mean field . in this work",
    "we have chosen the skyrme force sly4 @xcite as a representative of the skyrme forces .",
    "this particular force includes some selected properties of unstable nuclei in the adjusting procedure of the parameters .",
    "it is one of the more successful skyrme forces and has been extensively studied in the last years .",
    "the solution of the hf equation is found by using the formalism developed in ref .",
    "@xcite , assuming time reversal and axial symmetry .",
    "the single - particle wave functions are expanded in terms of the eigenstates of an axially symmetric harmonic oscillator in cylindrical coordinates , using twelve major shells .",
    "the method also includes pairing between like nucleons in bcs approximation with fixed gap parameters for protons and neutrons , which are determined phenomenologically from the odd - even mass differences through a symmetric five term formula involving the experimental binding energies @xcite when available . in those cases where experimental information for masses is still not available ,",
    "we have used the same pairing gaps as the closer isotopes measured .",
    "the pairing gaps for protons ( @xmath6 ) and neutrons ( @xmath7 ) obtained in this way are roughly around 1 mev .",
    "the corresponding pairing strengths @xmath8 and @xmath9 calculated from the gap equation depend sensitively on the mass region , single - particle spectrum , and active window for pairing . for typical values of the cutoffs of about 5 mev around the fermi level , one obtains @xmath10 mev and @xmath11 mev .",
    "it is worth noticing that , although the bcs formalism leads to an unphysical neutron gas surrounding the nucleus near the drip line , the approximation is still valid in the region considered here , where the pairing gaps are still much lower than the fermi energies .",
    "the potential energy curves ( pec ) are analyzed as a function of the quadrupole deformation @xmath0 ,    @xmath12    written in terms of the mass quadrupole moment @xmath13 and the mean square radius @xmath14 .",
    "for that purpose , constrained hf calculations are performed with a quadratic constraint @xcite .",
    "the hf energy is minimized under the constraint of keeping fixed the nuclear deformation .",
    "calculations for gt strengths are performed subsequently for the equilibrium shapes of each nucleus , that is , for the solutions , in general deformed , for which minima are obtained in the energy curves .",
    "since decays connecting different shapes are disfavored , similar shapes are assumed for the ground state of the parent nucleus and for all populated states in the daughter nucleus .",
    "the validity of this assumption was discussed for example in refs .",
    "@xcite . in our particular case , for sly4 and neutron - rich zr and mo isotopes , the ground - state deformation of the even - even parents ( zr , mo ) and of the corresponding @xmath0-decay odd - odd daughters ( nb , tc ) are practically the same , as it can be seen in ref . @xcite .    to describe gt transitions , a spin - isospin residual interaction is added to the mean field and treated in a deformed proton - neutron qrpa @xcite .",
    "this interaction contains two parts , particle - hole ( @xmath15 ) and particle - particle ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "the interaction in the @xmath15 channel is responsible for the position and structure of the gt resonance @xcite and it can be derived consistently from the same skyrme interaction used to generate the mean field , through the second derivatives of the energy density functional with respect to the one - body densities .",
    "the @xmath15 residual interaction is finally expressed in a separable form by averaging the landau - migdal resulting force over the nuclear volume , as explained in refs .",
    "the coupling strength is given by @xmath17 mev .",
    "the @xmath16 part is a neutron - proton pairing force in the @xmath18 coupling channel , which is also introduced as a separable force @xcite .",
    "the strength of the @xmath16 residual interaction in this theoretical approach is not derived self - consistently from the sly4 force used to obtain the mean field basis , but nevertheless it has been fixed in accordance to it .",
    "this strength is usually fitted to reproduce globally the experimental half - lives .",
    "various attempts have been done in the past to fix this strength , arriving to expressions such as @xmath19 in ref .",

    "an important difference between the results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_t_beta_zr ] and those discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite is the abrupt increase seen in the latter for the @xmath1 and @xmath70 value for a near - spherical @xmath79zr .",
    "these large values were mostly produced by the location of the gt - populated @xmath135g@xmath136@xmath137@xmath138g@xmath139 level at rather high energies in the spherical daughter @xmath79zr .",
    "this discrepancy emphasizes the sensitivity of @xmath1 and @xmath70 to the structure details of the mother / daughter nuclei .",
    "the experimental @xmath2 values are only upper limits , although they are much larger than the typical values obtained theoretically . in the heavier isotopes",
    "there are no data and these results are then useful to see the sensitivity to deformation of the predictions .",
    "the spherical minima in the heavier isotopes predict half - lives and @xmath2 values much lower than the corresponding values for deformed shapes . in fig .",
    "[ fig_t_beta_mo ] we have the results for the isotopes @xmath140mo . in the case of @xmath118mo",
    "the half - life is reproduced with the self - consistent oblate deformation , while the prolate one generates too high half - lives . in the case of @xmath94mo the measured half - life",
    "is well reproduced with both oblate and prolate equilibrium deformations . in the case of @xmath118mo the @xmath2 value is zero since experimentally @xcite @xmath141 . for @xmath94mo the @xmath2 value is not reached by the calculations . as in the case of the heavier zr isotopes , the heavier mo isotopes show that the half - lives for the spherical minima are much smaller than the corresponding half - lives for the self - consistent oblate and prolate shapes .",
    "in general we observe that the half - lives ( @xmath2 values ) in the heavier zr and mo isotopes calculated with @xmath127 and @xmath68 from sly4 ( solid lines ) are lower ( larger ) than the results calculated with @xmath127 and @xmath68 from dz ( dashed lines ) .    in figs .",
    "[ fig_t_pn_sly4 ] and [ fig_t_pn_dz ] we compare the measured @xmath0-decay half - lives ( upper panels ) and @xmath2 values ( lower panels ) with the theoretical results obtained with the oblate , prolate , and spherical equilibrium shapes . in the @xmath113zr isotopes we use experimental @xmath71 and @xmath68 values , while in the heavier @xmath128zr isotopes we use sly4 in fig .",
    "[ fig_t_pn_sly4 ] and the dz mass formula in fig .",
    "[ fig_t_pn_dz ] .",

    "[ fig_t_pn_dz ] . in the case of zr isotopes",
    ", we can see that the experimental half - life is close to the oblate result in @xmath77zr and appear systematically between the prolate and oblate calculations in the isotopes @xmath143zr .",
    "one wonders whether such result could be explained by the coexistence of a highly - deformed prolate ground - state configuration with a moderately deformed minimum similar to that found in @xmath77zr @xcite and ( more speculatively ) in @xmath102zr @xcite .",
    "the results seem to indicate that such weakly - deformed intruder configurations may have an oblate character . in the heavier isotopes @xmath126zr the predictions of both oblate and prolate",
    "are very close to each other and much larger than the result obtained from spherical shapes .",
    "measuring these half - lives and @xmath70 values will be a good opportunity to check the role of spherical configurations in these exotic nuclei , since the spherical components will lower the half - lives and @xmath70 values by factors about 5 and 15 - 50 , respectively .    in the case of mo isotopes ,",
    "the experimental half - lives in @xmath123mo tend to favor the oblate theoretical results ( which are indeed the ground states ) over the prolate ones . in the heavier @xmath125mo isotopes , as in the case of the heavier zr isotopes , oblate and prolate results are very similar and much larger than the spherical predictions , offering again a sensitive test to analyze the deformation of these heavy nuclei , for which spectroscopic measurements are more difficult .",
    "experimental @xmath2 values are only upper limits except for the case @xmath94mo , which is much larger than the calculations .",
    "this implies that the relative gt strength contained in the energy region below @xmath68 is overestimated theoretically and therefore the relative contribution coming from the strength above @xmath68 is too small .",
    "this can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig_bgt_mo_qbeta ] for @xmath94mo , where the accumulated strength is practically flat above @xmath68 .",
    "the half - lives and @xmath70 values of the @xmath144 nuclei , predicted here for spherical configurations , would have clear consequences in the calculation of r - process abundances .",
    "in particular , the abrupt reduction of the @xmath70 values may contribute to fill the artificial trough around @xmath145 predicted by current r - process nucleosynthesis models .",
    "furthermore , the confirmation of spherical shapes in these nuclei may be an indirect signature of the @xmath4 shell quenching since both phenomena are predicted by the sly4 force used in our calculations .",

    "in this paper we have studied the @xmath0-decay properties of neutron - deficient zr and mo isotopes within a deformed qrpa approach based on mean fields generated from self - consistent skyrme hartree - fock calculations . in particular , we have analyzed the experimental information on the half - lives and @xmath0-delayed neutron - emission probabilities in the neutron - rich @xmath73zr and @xmath72mo isotopes in terms of the nuclear deformation .",
    "we have shown that the measured half - lives in zr isotopes are placed between the results obtained from the oblate and prolate coexistent shapes that appear very close in energy in the pecs .",
    "the predicted half - lives in the heavier zr isotopes @xmath126zr , where there are no experimental data yet , are however very close to each other for both oblate and prolate shapes and much larger than the predictions from the spherical shapes . on the other hand , the measured half - lives in mo isotopes agree better with the calculations from oblate shapes , which are lower than the corresponding prolate ones .",
    "once more , in the heavier isotopes @xmath125mo , the predicted half - lives for both shapes are very close and larger than the spherical ones .",
    "thus , comparison with experimental half - lives indicates that in some cases ( mo isotopes ) a single shape accounts for this information , while in other cases ( most of the zr isotopes ) a more demanding treatment in terms of mixing of different shapes seems to be more appropriate .",
    "@xmath2 values are in general not well reproduced , although experimentally only upper limits are measured in most cases .",
    "hence , it will be certainly worth measuring those heavier isotopes and check whether they are properly described by the deformed shapes , or a spherical component is needed as well .",
    "nevertheless , one should keep in mind that half - lives are integral properties that collect all the information of the decay in a single number and does not tell us about the detailed internal structure of the gt strength distribution , much more sensitive to the nuclear structure . from a more detailed analysis of the gt strength distributions in the @xmath71 energy range accessible in @xmath0-decay ,",
    "we have shown that the differences between the predictions of the different nuclear shapes could be clearly distinguished experimentally .",
    "although these spectroscopic measurements are at present not feasible because of the still low production rates of exotic nuclei at modern radioactive beam facilities , they will provide in the future precise tests of the nuclear structure in exotic nuclei .",
