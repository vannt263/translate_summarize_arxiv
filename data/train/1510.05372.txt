    ". integrating   over the set @xmath115 with respect to the frostman measure @xmath126 , we see that @xmath362 we now interchange the order of summation and integration to deduce that @xmath363 applying hlder s inequality to the right hand side leads to the following upper bound for @xmath364 @xmath365 the sum in the previous estimate can be dealt with in the following way : choose @xmath366 with @xmath367 so that @xmath346 implies that @xmath368 for some @xmath369 .",
    "we claim that @xmath370 the growth condition on @xmath126 and lemmas [ shadowproperties ] and [ johnmeas ] imply that @xmath371 inequality follows from this since the sum on the right hand side converges .",
    "putting together all the estimates above yields @xmath372 it follows that @xmath373 to get from here we just note that by concavity of @xmath146 @xmath374 and thus we have @xmath375 we are left with the case that there is @xmath326 so that @xmath376",

    "another observation one has to notice is that if we replace the central whitney cube @xmath333 by a ball @xmath392 in the capacity estimates in theorem  [ thm : main thm ] , then the estimates   and   become @xmath393 and @xmath394 respectively , where the constant @xmath235 in both   and   now depends additionally on @xmath13 and @xmath395 . indeed ,",

    "assume that @xmath46 is a positive borel measure satifying for @xmath49 .",
    "since @xmath47 is compact it follows from that @xmath403 furthermore , together with the finiteness of @xmath404 imply that for any borel set @xmath127 we have @xmath405 we want to show that there are constants @xmath406 and @xmath407 independent of @xmath9 such that @xmath408 where @xmath57 is the boundary extension given in definition [ def : natural boundary extension ] . by fubini s theorem @xmath409 where @xmath410 .",
