    "the ot showed initially a fairly slow flux decay @xmath11 ( galama et al .",
    "1999 ) , which gradually steepened , @xmath12 after @xmath13  d ( @xcite ) , @xmath14 after @xmath15  d ( @xcite , bloom et al 1999 ) , @xmath16 after @xmath17  d ( @xcite , 1999b ) ) .",

    "this provides a lower limit of @xmath18 to the redshift , and a @xmath19ray energy of @xmath20  erg , in the case of isotropic emission .",
    "polarization is one of the clearest signatures of synchrotron radiation , if this is produced by electrons gyrating in a magnetic field that is at least in part ordered .",
    "polarization measurements can provide a crucial test of the synchrotron shock model ( @xcite ) .",
    "an earlier attempt to measure the linear polarization of the optical afterglow of grb 990123 yielded only an upper limit ( @xcite ) of @xmath21% .",

    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     -0.85truecm    imaging polarimetry is achieved by the use of a wollaston prism splitting the image of each object in the field into the two orthogonal polarization components which appear in adjacent areas of the ccd image . for each position angle @xmath25",
    "of the half  wave plate rotator , we obtain two simultaneous images of cross  polarization , at angles @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "relative photometry with respect to all the stars in the field was performed and each couple of simultaneous measurements at orthogonal angles was used to compute the points in fig . 2 ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : sphi ] ) .",
    "this technique removes any difference between the two optical paths ( ordinary and extraordinary ray ) and the polarization component introduced by galactic interstellar grains along the line of sight .",
    "moreover , being based on relative photometry in simultaneous images , our measurements are insensitive to intrinsic variations in the optical transient flux ( @xmath28 magnitudes during the time span of our observations ) . with the same procedure , we observed also two polarimetric standard stars , bd135073 and bd125133 , in order to fix the offset between the polarization and the instrumental angles .",
    "the data reduction was carried out with the eso ",
    "midas ( version 97nov ) system .",
    "after bias subtraction , non  uniformities were corrected using flat ",
    "fields obtained with the wollaston prism .",
    "the flux of each point source in the field of view was derived by means of both aperture and profile fitting photometry by the daophotii package ( @xcite ) , as implemented in midas .",
    "for relatively isolated stars the two techniques differ only by a few parts in a thousand .    in order to evaluate the parameters describing the linear polarization of the objects , we compute , for each instrumental position angle @xmath26 , the quantity : @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the intensities of the object measured in the two beams produced by the wollaston prism , and @xmath32 are the average ratios of the intensities of the stars in the field .",
    "this corrects directly for the small instrumental polarization ( and , at least in part , for the possible interstellar polarization ) .",
    "these field stars ( see fig.3 ) have been selected over a range in magnitude ( @xmath33 ) to check for possible non  linearities .",
    "since the interstellar polarization of any star in the field may be related to the patchy dust structure and/or to the star distance , we have verified that the result does not depend on which stars are chosen for the analysis . the parameter @xmath34 is related to the degree of linear polarization @xmath35 and to the position angle of the electric field vector @xmath36 by : @xmath37 @xmath35 and @xmath36 are evaluated by fitting a cosine curve to the observed values of @xmath34 .",
    "the derived linear polarization of the ot of grb 990510 is @xmath38% ( 1@xmath39 error ) , at a position angle of @xmath40 .",
    "the errors for the polarization level and position angle are computed propagating the photon noise of the observations and the contribution of the normalization to the stars in the field and of the calibration of the position angle .",
    "the latter quantities , however , amounts to only a minor fraction of the quoted 1@xmath39 uncertainties . fig .",
    "2 shows the data points and the best fit @xmath41 curve .",
    "the statistical significance of this measurement is very high .",
    "a potential problem is represented by a `` spurious '' polarization introduced by dust grains interposed along the line of sight , which may be preferentially aligned in one direction .",
    "stanek et al .",
    "( 1999b ) , using dust infrared emission maps ( @xcite ) , reported a substantial galactic absorption ( @xmath42 ) in the direction of grb 990510 .",
    "the maps by dickey & lockman ( 1990 ) and by burstein & heiles ( 1982 ) give instead a somewhat lower value , @xmath43 and @xmath44 , respectively . applying an empirical relation ( @xcite )",
    "this polarization can amount to @xmath45 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath46% .",
    "these are only statistical estimates and large variations on the main trend may be expected .",
    "then a fraction , or even all the polarization of the ot could be caused by the passage of its light through the galactic ism .",
    "however the normalization of the ot measurements to the stars in the field already corrects for the average interstellar polarization of these stars , even if this does not necessarily account for all the effects of the galactic ism along the line of sight to the ot ( e.g. the ism could be more distant than the stars , not inducing any polarization of their light ) . to check this possibility , we plot in fig .",
    "3 the degree of polarization vs. the instrumental position angle for each star and for the ot .",
    "all points in this figure have been derived avoiding to normalize with respect to other objects .",
    "it is apparent that , while the position angle of all stars are consistent with being the same ( within 10 degrees ) , the ot clearly stands out .",
    "the polarization position angle of stars close to the ot differs by @xmath47 from the position angle of the ot ( see fig .",
    "this is contrary to what one would expect if the polarization of the ot were due to the galactic ism .",
    "indeed , the higher polarization level measured for the ot when normalized to the stars in the same field implies that the ism actually _ somewhat de - polarizes _ the ot .",
    "we therefore conclude that the ot , even if contaminated by interstellar polarization , must be intrinsically polarized to give the observed orientation .",
    "we can place tight limits on the amount of absorption , and hence the associated polarization , that could be produced by interstellar material in the host galaxy of grb  990510 .",
    "assuming that the intrinsic spectrum is a power law @xmath48 , we require that the fluxes measured simultaneously in the @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath1 and @xmath51 band ( pietrzynski & udalski 1999 ; kaluzny et al .",
    "1999 ; hjorth et al .",
    "1999b ) lie on a power law curve .",
    "this strongly limits the amount of the local extinction , affecting the flux at rest ",
    "frame frequencies of @xmath52 , i.e. in the uv , where extinction is more severe .",
    "we find a maximum allowed value @xmath53 , corresponding to a maximum induced polarization level of @xmath54 .",
    "incidentally , the best fit power law is obtained for @xmath55 , a galactic @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "this value of @xmath58 matches the predictions of the standard model for the decaying afterglow flux ( @xcite ) , which gives @xmath59 . for @xmath60 ,",
    "the expected flux decay is in agreement with that measured at the time of the observations .",
    "relativistic fireball models do explain the main properties of grbs and their afterglows ( @xcite )",
    ". polarized optical synchrotron emission may be observable if : ( i ) the coherence length of the magnetic field in the fireball grows at a sizeable fraction of the speed of light ( gruzinov & waxman 1999 ; gruzinov 1999 ) or , ( ii ) the fireball is collimated ( hjorth et al .",
    "1999a ) ( i.e. it is beamed ) .",
    "therefore , measurements of optical polarization can provide constraints on the geometry of the emitting source .",
    "additional information come from the afterglow light curve which shows a gradual steepening in the bands @xmath50 , @xmath1 and @xmath51 , which was never observed before ( marconi et al .",
    "the observed steepening is almost wavelength independent , thus excluding that it could be entirely caused by a curved spectrum shifting in time rigidly to lower frequencies , in which case we ought to see the highest frequencies steepening first .",
    "in addition , the @xmath61 and @xmath62 colors are changing very slowly during the evolution , indicating that the spectral slope is changing slowly with time .",
    "these information suggest that the fireball is collimated in a jet .",
    "the solid angle of the jet visible to the observer is limited to those regions making an angle smaller than @xmath63 with the line of sight .",
    "as @xmath64 decreases , the visible solid angle increases as @xmath65 , until @xmath66 ( with @xmath67 being the cone of semi  aperture angle and @xmath68 the angle between the cone axis and the line of sight ) .",
    "when @xmath69 the observed solid angle remains constant , since the entire jet is visible . for @xmath64factors between @xmath70 and @xmath71 the observed solid angle increases somewhat slower than @xmath65 .",
    "since the flux at the earth is proportional to the observed solid angle , we have two well defined behaviors of the light curve , corresponding to @xmath72 and @xmath73 , and a transition period of gradual steepening in between .",
    "photons produced in regions at an angle @xmath63 with respect to the line of sight are emitted , in the comoving frame , at @xmath74 from the velocity vector .",
    "a comoving observer at this angle can then see a compressed emitting region and a projected magnetic field structure with a preferred orientation .",
    "if the gradual steepening of the light curve is due to the mechanism just mentioned , we would observe only some regions at a viewing angle @xmath63 , not all those we would see in axis ",
    "symmetric situation , and this asymmetry can be the cause of the observed linear polarization .",
    "the above arguments suggest that we are observing , slightly off ",
    "axis , a collimated beam .",
    "if this is the case , we would have a link between the flux decay behavior , the presence of polarization , and the degree of collimation , opening a new perspective for measuring the intrinsic power of grbs .",
    "deeper understanding of polarization in grbs may come from future multi ",
    "filter observations and from spectropolarimetry .",
    "frequency dependent polarization can in fact easily disentangle different components of polarization .",
    "in addition , variability in the degree of polarization and its position angle is expected in such fastly evolving sources : therefore repeated observations of the same afterglow will also be important .",
