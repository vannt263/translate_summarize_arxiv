    "the monty hall game has its roots in the popular tv show _",
    "let s make a deal _ and it was often the source of misunderstanding .",
    "there are several quantisations of this game @xcite .",
    "we follow the scheme by flitney and abbott and reformulate it in the language of the density matrices in order to study the influence of noise on the game behaviour .",
    "problem of noise in quantum games was also studied in @xcite .",
    "this paper is organised as follows . in section  [ sec : classical : mh ] the classical monty hall problem is introduced . in section  [ sec :",
    "quantum : mh ] flitney and abott s scheme of quantisation of monty hall game is presented . in section  [ sec : noisemodel ] the noise model which is applied to the game is discussed . at last in section  [ sec : results ] the results and their discussion is presented .",
    "in the classical scheme monty hall game runs as follows .",
    "there are two players : alice and bob .",
    "bob s goal is to get the prize and alice plays the role of banker .",
    "there are three boxes of which only one contains the prize .",
    "the game consists of successive steps :    1 .",
    "alice randomly chooses one box and hides the prize in it .",
    "bob chooses one of the boxes according to his will .",
    "alice opens one of the boxes which does not contain the prize .",
    "bob now have an option to keep his choice or to switch and chose the other closed box .",
    "alice opens the box chosen by bob .",
    "bob wins if the prize is in the box he have chosen .",
    "otherwise he looses .",
    "the game is appealing and thought - provoking because bob s optimal strategy differs from intuition . to achieve higher probability of winning , bob should switch the box fourth step of the game .",
    "explanation of this fact is very simple .",
    "there are two possible cases in step two : bob chooses the box with the prize inside ( with probability @xmath0 ) or bob chooses the box without a  prize inside ( with probability @xmath1 ) .",
    "then in third step , when alice opens one of the boxes , bob switches .",
    "hence in the first case he will lose , but in the second case he will always switch to the box containing the prize . therefore switching strategy yields to expected pay - off of @xmath1 and not switching strategy only to @xmath0 .",
    "flitney and abbott presented in @xcite following quantisation of this game .",
    "alice s and bob s choices are represented by qutrits and the game starts in some initial state which will be specified further .",
    "players strategies are represented by operators acting on their respective qutrits .",
    "third qutrit represents the box opened by alice .",
    "the state of the system may be expressed by the normalised state vector @xmath2 where @xmath3 is alice s choice , @xmath4 is bob s choice and @xmath5 represents the box that has been opened .",
    "the operator for opening of the box is defined as @xmath6 and the operator for switching the box as @xmath7 where @xmath8 , otherwise @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "bob s not switching operator @xmath12 is represented by the identity matrix acting on the state of three qutrits .",
    "alice and bob are restricted to unitary transformations on their qutrits .",
    "@xmath13 are players movements .",
    "the unitary operator that implements this game is given by relation @xmath14 if bob chooses to switch or by relation @xmath15 if bob chooses not to switch the box .",
    "the final state of the game is @xmath16 , where @xmath17 indicates bob s strategy and @xmath18 is the initial state of the game .",
    "one may consider bob s classic probabilistic strategies .",
    "bob controls a  free parameter @xmath19 $ ] , which represents the mixing of switching and not switching strategies .",
    "pure switching strategy is obtained for @xmath20 and pure not switching strategy is obtained for @xmath21 .",
    "bob wins if he picks the correct box , hence expectation value of his pay - off is given by the equation @xmath22    flitney and abbott considered two initial states , one separable @xmath23 and one having qutrits of alice and bob entangled @xmath24    the goal of the this work is to analyse the influence of noise on the game outcome .",
    "therefore we assume , that the game is not played on the pure state but on a  mixed state , that underwent non - unitary evolution trough a noisy channel .",
    "the initial state of the game is given by @xmath25 , where @xmath26 denotes the quantum noisy channel .",
    "in this case , quantum monty hall game is implemented on qutrits , i.e. three level quantum states .",
    "one can imagine that such a game could be implemented in real physical system .",
    "one of suitable systems is 3-levels quantum state implemented on some atom .",
    "we model the noise in such system by local spontaneous emission channel parametrised by single real parameter @xmath27 .",
    "this parameter can be understood as time .",
    "following @xcite we chose an atom with so called v - configuration in which the allowed spontaneous transitions are : @xmath28 and @xmath29 . in this analysis",
    "we assume that each atom ( qutrit ) decoheres independently by the spontaneous emission .",
    "this dissipative process is characterised by two einstein coefficients @xmath30 , @xmath31 , describing the irreversible depopulation from exited states @xmath32 and @xmath33 . for simplicity",
    "the following calculations are conducted with @xmath34 .",
    "the following set of kraus operators represents this channel : @xmath35 , k_1= \\sqrt{1-e^{-t a_1 } } \\left [ \\begin{smallmatrix }   0 & 1 & 0 \\\\   0 & 0 & 0 \\\\   0 & 0 & 0 \\end{smallmatrix } \\right ] , k_2= \\sqrt{1-e^{-t a_2 } } \\left [ \\begin{smallmatrix }   0 & 0 & 1 \\\\   0 & 0 & 0 \\\\   0 & 0 & 0 \\end{smallmatrix } \\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] hence action of the channel on one qutrit is @xmath36    the extended channel acting on all three qutrits is obtained by applying the following formula @xmath37      generalized pauli channel is an extension of the pauli channel to any dimension @xcite . in order to apply the generalized pauli channel on qutrits ,",
    "one defines two unitary operators : @xmath38,\\quad z= \\left [ \\begin{smallmatrix }   1 & 0 & 0 \\\\   0 & e^{2/3 i \\pi } & 0 \\\\   0 & 0 & e^{4/3 i \\pi } \\end{smallmatrix } \\right].\\ ] ]    one can create a  family of generalized pauli channels with the help of kraus operators , in the following way : @xmath39 by putting @xmath40 and @xmath41 for @xmath42 we obtain one parameter family of noisy channels .",
    "the parameter @xmath43 $ ] can be understood as probability of error occurrence .",
    "note that for @xmath44 action of the channel transforms any state to maximally mixed state @xmath45 .",

    "+     +    [ [ conclusions ] ] conclusions + + + + + + + + + + +    we have studied two noise models , that are likely to occur in the physical implementation of the quantum version of the monty hall game .",
    "the calculation have shown that existence of noise heavily influences the expectation value of the quantum monty hall game .",
    "we can observe different behaviour of the game for different strategies , initial states and quantum channels .",
    "in the case of spontaneous emission channel the initial state of the game approaches the ground state @xmath59 as noise parameter goes to infinity .",
    "therefore for large amounts of noise the game is played ( quantum strategies are applied ) on the state @xmath59 rather than on states @xmath49 or @xmath50 .",
    "when we compare the asymptotic behaviour of the pay - off functions in the cases 1 and 3 we see that they converge to the same limit @xmath92 .",
    "the difference between those cases is that in case 1 bob should switch the gate only if noise parameter is larger than @xmath93 .",
    "it should be noted that for @xmath66 bob knows exactly what is the initial state of the game  where the prize is hidden . therefore given alice",
    "will not act ( her strategy is to apply an identity ) , bob can allways win and the game becomes unfair .",
    "this can be observed in cases 1 , 2 and 3 .",
    "generalized pauli channel transforms any input state towards the maximally mixed state .",
    "therefore for maximal value of noise parameter any correlations are lost .",
    "it can be easily seen that if initial state of this game is maximally mixed then , bob s pay - off is always equal to @xmath85 and is independent of alice s and bob s strategies .",
    "the noise can influence the outcomes of the game in a  non - trivial way .",
    "in example in case 6 bob should change his strategy , to switching the box , when noise parameter is larger than @xmath94    obtained results show , that if bob knows the properties of the noise in the system implementing quantum monty hall game he can use this knowledge to change his strategy in order to maximize his pay - off . in some cases the noise can be more influential than strategies and therefore can impede successful implementation of quantum games .",
    "more careful studies , that take into account imperfections of the physical device realizing this game , would be needed if a  proposition of concrete physical implementation of this game will appear .",
    "this research was partially supported by the polish ministry of science and higher education project n519 012 31/1957 .",
