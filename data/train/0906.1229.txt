    "the concept that elliptic flow results from rescattering ( of partons or hadrons ) in a medium is contradicted by minijet correlation data .",
    "such rescattering would decouple partons from their initial - state scattering partners ( especially at 3 gev ) and destroy hadronic correlations resulting from parton fragmentation .",
    "strong back - to - back parton correlations are inferred from strong hadron jet correlations , even in central au - au collisions .",
    "differential analysis of single - particle spectra and two - particle correlations from rhic au - au collisions reveals that copious parton fragment yields extend down to small transverse momentum even in central collisions . according to pqcd and elementary collisions at least half of all parton fragments in nuclear collisions",

    "the blast - wave model fitted to sp spectra returns an estimate of radial flow .",
    "but the spectrum structure responsible is just the hard component associated with minijets .",
    "spectrum ratio @xmath51 used to estimate jet suppression at larger @xmath6 strongly suppresses spectrum structure below @xmath260 gev / c , including most of the jet fragment yield in the spectrum hard component .    conventional @xmath0 analysis , especially in more - peripheral and more - central a - a collisions , misidentifies the @xmath261 fourier component of jet azimuth structure ( `` nonflow '' ) as elliptic flow and can greatly overestimate @xmath0 in such cases .",
    "ratio @xmath12 contains the single - particle spectrum in its denominator , and is thus strongly affected by the spectrum hard component ( minijets ) at larger @xmath6 , in addition to nonflow contributions from jet azimuth correlations in its numerator .",
    "so - called `` triggered '' analysis of jet azimuth correlations suppresses true jet yields because of incorrect estimation of the combinatoric - background offset ( zyam estimate ) and @xmath0 component .",
    "the conventional zyam procedure underestimates jet yields by as much as a factor 10 , and the away - side jet is distorted by the @xmath0 oversubtraction ( minimum at @xmath129 ) so as to suggest the presence of mach shocks .",
    "the combination leads to inference of an `` opaque medium '' and parton thermalization .",
    "the numerator of @xmath12 contains quadrupole spectrum @xmath262 which could represent a hydro phenomenon if that were relevant .",
    "however , the quadrupole component is insensitive to dramatic changes in jet properties with increasing centrality that could be attributed to a common medium .",
    "the quadrupole component seems to be carried by an isolated and small part of the final - state system .    in conclusion",
    ", the combination of two fragmentation components ( projectile nucleons and semihard - scattered partons ) plus an isolated third ( quadrupole ) component accurately describes all rhic spectrum and correlation data over a large @xmath6 interval .",
    "no evidence for radial flow is observed .",
    "jet yields increase according to binary - collision scaling in more - peripheral collisions , and even more rapidly for more - central au - au collisions .",
    "fragmentation is strongly modified in the latter case .",
    "there is no evidence for an opaque medium .    as a rule , above @xmath263 gev qcd should be given first opportunity to describe nuclear collisions .",
    "hydro should not be invoked until qcd has been shown to fail .",
    "a hydro description of selected aspects of data within restricted kinematic intervals does not establish the necessity of the model . in some cases hydro",
    "is contradicted .",
    "the relevance of hydrodynamics to rhic collisions can therefore be questioned .",
