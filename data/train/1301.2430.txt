    "in order to gain some insights on how the internal structure of black holes could get modified by quantum gravitational effects , one can consider quadratic corrections to the dynamics of general relativity ( gr ) , which arise when the quantum renormalizability of the matter fields is considered in curved space@xcite and also when gr is seen as an effective theory@xcite .",
    "here we address this problem assuming that the space - time possesses independent metric and affine structures ( palatini formalism ) .",
    "though quadratic gravity theories have been studied in the literature in a variety of situations , the palatini formulation has comparatively received much less attention . our motivation to consider the palatini approach@xcite comes from recent results that support this framework as a very promising arena to explore aspects of quantum gravity phenomenology@xcite .",
    "our model is described by the following einstein - maxwell action with planck - scale corrections in the gravitational sector ( @xmath0 planck length ) @xmath1- \\frac{1}{16\\pi } \\int d^4x \\sqrt{-g } f_{\\alpha\\beta}f^{\\alpha\\beta } \\nonumber \\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] taking independent variations of ( [ eq : action ] ) with respect to metric and connection yields @xmath2&=&0 \\",

    "the antisymmetric part of the connection is set to zero for simplicity . for a spherical electric field",
    ", the field equations can be written as [ @xmath17 and @xmath18 @xmath19 which smoothly recover gr in the limit @xmath20 . using a spherically symmetric line element for @xmath11",
    ", one can show that the metric @xmath12 can be expressed as@xcite @xmath21}{\\delta_2 z \\sigma_-^{1/2 } }   \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 represents the schwarzschild radius of the vacuum solution .",
    "all the information about the geometry is encapsulated in @xmath26 , which satisfies @xmath27 .",
    "for @xmath28 we have @xmath29 , which leads to @xmath30 and recovers gr when @xmath31 .",

    "this constant is very important in this theory .",
    "in fact , when the charge - to - mass ratio @xmath36 is set to the value @xmath37 , the resulting geometry is smooth everywhere , as can be seen from the line element @xmath38+(r_q l_p ) d\\omega^2 \\\\ ] ] and from the direct computation of curvature scalars such as @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 . for any other value of @xmath36 curvature divergences",
    "arise at @xmath42 .",
    "expressing the charge as @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the electron charge and @xmath45 the number of charges , we can write @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the fine structure constant . with this",
    "we find that the area of the @xmath42 surface is given by @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is planck s area .",
    "this suggests that each charge sourcing the electric field has associated an elementary quantum of area of magnitude @xmath50 . from this",
    "it follows that the ratio of the total charge @xmath51 by the area of this surface gives a universal constant , @xmath52 , which up to a factor @xmath53 coincides with the planck surface charge density .",
    "furthermore , the regularity condition @xmath54 sets the following mass - to - charge relation @xmath55 , which indicates that the matter density inside a sphere of radius @xmath56 is another universal constant , @xmath57 , independent of @xmath51 and @xmath58 . from the large @xmath59 expansion , one can verify that the location of the external horizon of the nonsingular charged black holes is essentially the same as in gr , @xmath60 .",
    "for a solar mass black hole , the number of charges needed to avoid the @xmath42 singularity is just @xmath61 , which is a tiny amount on astrophysical terms ( in fact , the sun contains @xmath62 protons ) . in general",
    ", @xmath63 implies that in astrophysical scenarios @xmath64 .",
    "we have shown with an exactly solvable model that nonperturbative effects at the planck scale can generate important modifications on the innermost structure of black holes while keeping their macroscopic features essentially unchanged .",
    "this is an aspect that has been recursively used in heuristic discussions in the literature but without solid mathematical support .",
    "our model , formulated  la palatini , provides an explicit realization of this idea .",
    "a deeper understanding of the properties of the solutions obtained here could shed useful new light on the properties of black hole singularities , the mechanisms that prevent them , and the fate of black hole evaporation@xcite .",
    "investigations of these issues are currently underway .",
