    "quantum statistics started in the 70 s with the discovery that notions of ` classical ' statistics such as the cramr - rao inequality , the fisher information , have non - trivial quantum extensions which can be used to design optimal measurements for quantum state estimation and discrimination . recently",
    ", statistical inference has become an indispensable tool in quantum engineering tasks such as state preparation @xcite , precision metrology @xcite , quantum process tomography , state transfer and teleportation , continuous variables tomography .",
    "quantum system identification ( qsi ) is a topic of particular importance in quantum engineering and control where accurate knowledge of dynamical parameters is crucial .",
    "this paper addresses the qsi problem for markov dynamics from the viewpoint of _ asymptotic statistics _ , complementing other recent investigations .",
    "we illustrate the concept of a quantum markov chain through the example of an atom maser @xcite : identically prepared d - level atoms ( input ) pass successively and at equal time intervals @xmath2 through a cavity , interact with the cavity field , and exit in a perturbed state ( output ) which carries information about the interaction ( see figure [ fig.atom.maser ] ) . neglecting the internal dynamics of atoms and cavity , and taking the latter to be of dimension @xmath3 ,",
    "the evolution can be described in discrete time and consists of applying an interaction unitary @xmath4 for each time interval @xmath2 when a new atom passes through the cavity .",
    "if the incoming atoms are in the pure state @xmath5 and the cavity is initially in some state @xmath6 , then at time @xmath7 the output plus cavity state is @xmath8 @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the copy of @xmath11 acting on cavity and the atom which at time @xmath7 is at position @xmath12 on the right side of the cavity .",
    "consider now that the interaction depends on some unknown parameter @xmath0 such that @xmath13 and correspondingly @xmath14 .",
    "our identification problem is to estimate @xmath0 , by measuring the _ output _ rather that the system ( cavity ) which may not be directly accessible . for simplicity we restrict ourselves to the case of estimating one parameter ( the interaction strength ) , such that @xmath15 where @xmath16 is a _ known _ hamiltonian , but the results can be extended to multiple parameters as well as continuous time .",
    "the questions we want to address are : how much information about @xmath0 is contained in the output state @xmath17 , and how can we ` extract ' it ?    the standard approach to such questions goes via the quantum cramr - rao inequality which shows that the variance of any unbiased estimator obtained by measuring a copy of a state @xmath18 , is lower bounded by the inverse of the quantum fisher information @xmath19 .",
    "although this bound is generally not attainable for a single copy , it is asymptotically attainable , i.e. there exist a sequence of measurements @xmath20 on @xmath7 _ identically prepared systems _ , and estimators @xmath21 such that @xmath22 unlike this case where the @xmath7-copies fisher information scales linearly with the number of systems , the fisher information of the _ correlated _ states @xmath23 depends on the joint state rather than that of a single sub - system , and there is no straightforward argument to show that its rescaled version is asymptotically attainable .",
    "moreover , in the case of multi - dimensional parameters , this approach would run into the same problems as the independent copies model , for which it is well known that the cramr - rao bound is not attainable even asymptotically @xcite .    for these reasons",
    ", we will pursue an _ asymptotic _",
    "analysis based on the concept of local asymptotic normality ( lan ) @xcite which was recently extended to quantum statistics and used to solve the ( asymptotically ) optimal estimation problem for general multiparametric models . in this paper we extend quantum lan from independent to finitely correlated quantum states , and in the same time generalise results on lan @xcite and the central limit theorem ( clt ) for classical markov chains .    in theorem [ th.qlan ]",
    "we show that , locally with respect to the parameter @xmath0 , the output state @xmath23 can be approximated by a one - parameter family of coherent states , cf . .",
    "this result can be seen as the markov version of asymptotic gaussianity in coherent spin states ( css ) @xcite . as a by - product",
    ", we obtain the asymptotic expression of the quantum fisher information @xmath24 ( per atom ) of the output state , which is equal to the ` markovian variance ' of the driving hamiltonian .",
    "this quantity should be understood as the limit of the rescaled quantum fisher informations @xmath25 of the @xmath7 atoms family of states @xmath23 @xmath26 in particular , @xmath19 sets an asymptotic lower bound on the variance @xmath27 of any sequence of unbiased estimators @xmath28 . using the formalism of lan",
    "we can show that the lower bound is attainable but at the moment we do not not know the explicit form of the optimal measurement , and we expect it to be non - separable , and possibly unfeasible with current technology .",
    "in theorem [ th.simple.measurement ] we analyse the more realistic set - up of repeated , separate measurements performed on the outgoing atoms , and show that the _ mean _ of the outcomes is asymptotically gaussian and can be used to estimate @xmath0 .",
    "the corresponding _ classical _ fisher information can be maximised over different measured observables , so that the experimenter can perform the most informative separable measurement , and compare its performance with the benchmark given by the quantum fisher information ( see example ) .",
    "this generalises wiseman s adaptive phase estimation protocol where a particular field quadrature is most informative among all quadratures @xcite .",
    "with the same techniques , similar results can be obtained for means of other functionals of the measurement data such as correlations between subsequent atoms .",
    "however it remains an open problem to find the ( asymptotic ) classical fisher information contained in the complete measurement data .",
    "the next two sections introduce the key concepts underlying our results : local asymptotic normality and ergodicity .",
    "the main results are contained in theorems 3 and 4 . to illustrate these results we analyse a simple example based on a xy interaction for which we compute the quantum fisher information and we plot the classical fisher information for different output observables .",
    "an interesting feature of this model is the divergence of the asymptotic quantum fisher information per atom at vanishing interaction , which is due to a quadratic rather than linear scaling of the ` usual ' quantum fisher information @xmath25 for @xmath29 .",
    "we investigate this behaviour and find that with the scaling @xmath30 , the model converges to a simple unitary rotation model on the system , with input passing into the output unperturbed .",
    "we conclude with a discussion on further extensions , open problems and connections with other topics .",
    "in this section we briefly review some asymptotic statistics techniques , show how they extend to quantum statistics , and explain why this is useful .",
    "the aim is to introduce the concept of local asymptotic normality , which will be encountered in the main results , theorems [ th.simple.measurement ] and [ th.qlan ] .",
    "a typical problem in statistics is the following : estimate an unknown parameter @xmath31 , given the random variables @xmath32 which are independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . ) and have probability distribution @xmath33 depending ` smoothly ' on @xmath0 . if @xmath34 is a unbiased estimator , that is @xmath35 , then the cramr - rao ( c - r ) inequality provides the following lower bound to its ( rescaled ) covariance matrix @xmath36 \\geq i(\\theta)^{-1},\\ ] ] where @xmath37 is a @xmath38 positive definite real matrix called the fisher information matrix at @xmath0 and quantifies the amount of ` statistical information ' about @xmath0 contained in a single sample from the distribution @xmath33 . if @xmath39 denotes the density of @xmath33 with respect to some reference measure @xmath40 , then the matrix elements of @xmath37 are given by @xmath41 and depends only on the local behavior of the statistical model @xmath42 around the point @xmath0 . to give a simple example",
    ", if @xmath43 are independent coin tosses with @xmath44=\\theta$ ] , then the mean @xmath45 is an unbiased estimator of @xmath0 whose distribution is asymptotically normal according to the central limit theorem @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the normal distribution with mean @xmath48 and variance @xmath49 .",
    "a simple calculation shows that in this case @xmath50 so that @xmath21 achieves the c - r lower bound .",
    "interestingly , the fisher information diverges at the boundary of the interval @xmath51 $ ] , but note that the bound is meaningful only for points in the interior of the parameter space .",
    "a similar situation will occur later in an example of a quantum markov chain .    while in general there might not exist any unbiased estimators achieving the c - r bound for a given @xmath7 , the theory says that ` good ' estimators @xmath52 ( e.g. maximum likelihood under certain conditions ) are _ asymptotically _ normal with @xmath53 such that the c - r bound is asymptotically achieved .    le cam went a step further and discovered a more fundamental phenomenon called _ local asymptotic normality _ ( lan ) , which roughly means that the underlying statistical model @xmath54 can be linearised in the neighbourhood of any fixed parameter , and approximated by a simple gaussian model with fixed covariance and unknown mean @xcite . to explain this ,",
    "let us first note that without loss of generality we can ` localise ' @xmath0 , i.e. write it as @xmath55 where @xmath56 can be chosen to be a rough estimator based on a small sub - sample of size @xmath57 with @xmath58 , and @xmath59 is an unknown ` local parameter ' . by a simple concentration of measure argument one can show that with vanishing probability of error , the local parameter satisfies @xmath60 . for all practical purposes , we can then use the more convenient local parametrisation by @xmath61 and denote the original distribution @xmath62 by @xmath63 .",
    "now , lan is the statement that there exists randomisation ( classical channels ) @xmath64 and @xmath65 such that @xmath66 where @xmath67 denotes the @xmath68-norm , and @xmath69 and @xmath70 are the probability densities of @xmath63 and respectively @xmath71 .",
    "operationally this means that one can use the data @xmath32 to simulate a normally distributed variable with density @xmath70 , and viceversa , with asymptotically vanishing @xmath68-error , without having access to the unknown parameter @xmath59 .",
    "this type of convergence is strong enough to imply the previous results on asymptotic normality and optimality of the maximum likelihood estimation , but can be used to make similar statements about other statistical decision problem concerning @xmath0 .",
    "we will now show that a similar phenomenon occurs in quantum statistics , and indicate how it can be used to finding asymptotically optimal state estimation protocols .",
    "let us consider the problem of estimating a one - dimensional parameter @xmath0 , given @xmath7 _ identical and independent _ copies of a quantum system prepared in the ( possibly mixed ) state @xmath72 depending smoothly on @xmath0 .",
    "following we analyse an _ unbiased _ estimator @xmath21 based on the outcome of an arbitrary measurement @xmath73 on the joint state @xmath74 . by the classical cramr - rao inequality ,",
    "the mean square error ( mse ) of @xmath21 is lower bounded by the inverse ( classical ) fisher information of the measurement outcome : @xmath75 \\geq i_{m}(\\theta)^{-1}.\\ ] ] thus , a ` good ' measurement is characterised by a large fisher information , but how large can @xmath76 be ?",
    "the answer is given by the notion of _ quantum fisher information _ associated to the model @xmath77 which is defined as @xmath78 where the _ symmetric logaritmic derivative _ ( sld ) @xmath79 is the quantum analogue of @xmath80 and is the selfadjoint solution of the equation @xmath81 as expected , for @xmath7 identical copies the quantum fisher information of the joint state @xmath82 is @xmath83 and the sld is given by @xmath84 with @xmath85 acting on the @xmath86th system .",
    "the braunstein - caves inequality shows that the quantum fisher information is an upper bound to the classical one , i.e. @xmath87",
    "so that we obtain @xmath88 \\geq f(\\theta)^{-1}.\\ ] ] moreover , the constant on the right side can be achieved _ asymptotically _ by an adaptive measurement which amounts to measuring @xmath89 for some point @xmath56 which is a preliminary estimator of @xmath0 obtained by measuring a small proportion of the systems . in summary ,",
    "the optimal estimation rate for one dimensional parameters is @xmath90 , and can be achieved by means of _ separate _ measurements of the sld s @xmath85 .",
    "let us turn now to the case where @xmath18 depends on a multidimensional parameter @xmath91 .",
    "the quantum fisher information _ matrix _ can be defined along similar lines and all previous inequalities hold as matrix inequalities , in particular the covariance matrix of an unbiased estimator @xmath21 satisfies @xmath92 \\geq f(\\theta)^{-1}.\\ ] ] however , unlike the classical case , and the one - dimensional quantum case , the right side is in general not achievable , even asymptotically !",
    "this purely quantum phenomenon has a simple intuitive explanation : the optimal estimation of the different coordinates @xmath93 requires the simultaneous measurement of generally incompatible observables , the associated sld s @xmath94 .",
    "coming back to the original goal of estimating the parameter @xmath0 , the above fisher information analysis implies that the optimal measurement procedures must depend on the chosen figure of merit .",
    "thus , one should not aim at saturating matrix inequalities such as but at finding asymptotically attainable lower bounds for the risk ( multiplied by @xmath7 ) @xmath95= n{\\rm tr}\\left ( g(\\theta ) { \\rm var}(\\hat\\theta_{n})\\right),\\ ] ] assuming for simplicity a quadratic loss function with positive weight matrix @xmath96 .",
    "taking the trace with @xmath96 on both sides of gives the generally non - attainable lower bound @xmath97 , and other examples can be derived from different versions of the quantum cramr - rao inequality such as belavkin s right and left inequalities @xcite .",
    "holevo @xcite derived a more general bound and showed that it is achievable for families of gaussian states with unknown displacements , but until recently it remained an open question whether this bound was asymptotically attainable for finite dimensional states . by further refining the techniques of the unbiased estimation set - up , hayashi and matsumoto showed that the holevo bound is indeed asymptotically attainable for general families of _ two - dimensional _ quantum states . complementing this frequentist asymptotic analysis , bagan and",
    "coworkers solved the optimal qubit estimation problem _ for any given @xmath7 _ in the bayesian set - up with invariant priors .",
    "however , neither of these approaches was successful in solving the ( asymptotically ) optimal estimation problem for general ( mixed states ) , multi - parametric models @xmath98 with @xmath99 .      at this point ,",
    "a natural question to ask is whether the phenomenon of local asymptotic normality occurs also in quantum statistics , and whether it can be used to design asymptotically optimal measurement strategies .",
    "recall that in the classical case , the main idea was that for large @xmath7 , the i.i.d .",
    "model could be approximated by a gaussian model , in the sense that each can be mapped approximately into the other by means of classical channels .",
    "building on earlier work by hayashi @xcite , the quantum version of lan has been derived in a series of papers to which we refer for the details of the constructions . here",
    "we only mention the general result , and discuss in more detail the special case of pure states models which is more relevant for the present work .    as in the classical case , we can localise @xmath0 to a neighbourhood of @xmath56 such that @xmath100 with @xmath60 for some small @xmath101 , and we denote @xmath102 . then there exist channels ( normalised , completely positive linear maps ) @xmath64 and @xmath65 between the appropriated spaces such that @xmath103 where @xmath104 is a family of quantum gaussian states of a continuos variables system , and @xmath105 is a family of classical gaussian distributions",
    ". moreover , each family has a fixed covariance matrix and the displacement is a linear transformation of the unknown parameter @xmath59 . with this tool at hand",
    ", one can prove that the holevo bound is attainable through the following three steps procedure : first localise @xmath0 , then send the remaining states through the channel @xmath64 and then apply the optimal measurement for the limit gaussian model .",
    "we illustrate lan for the simple case of a one dimensional family of pure states on @xmath106 @xmath107 is a selfadjoint operator , which satisfies @xmath108 . the ( non - unique ) sld is given by @xmath109\\ ] ] and the quantum fisher information is proportional to the variance of the ` generator ' @xmath110 @xmath111    in the case of pure states , the limit gaussian model consists of a family of coherent states so that lan can be intuitively understood by analysing the intrinsic geometric structure of the quantum statistical model , which is encoded in the inner products between vectors corresponding to different parameters .",
    "indeed , with the usual definition of the local states @xmath112 , a simple calculation shows that @xmath113 where @xmath114 is a coherent state of a one mode continuous variables ( cv ) system , with displacements @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
    "this means that locally , the ` shape ' of the statistical model for @xmath7 states , converges to that of a family of coherent states . by using the central limit",

    ", it can be shown that the weak lan can be upgraded to the strong version described by and .",

    "theorem [ th.simple.measurement ] . for @xmath236 the quantum fisher information is @xmath237 while that of the spin measurement varies from @xmath238 to @xmath239 ( see figure [ fig.fisher ] ) .     ]",
    "an interesting , and perhaps surprising feature of the quantum fisher information is that it diverges at vanishing coupling constant , due to the factor @xmath240 in the denominator .",
    "this singularity arises from the second term on the right side of and stems from the fact that the markov chain is _ not mixing _ at @xmath1 . to get an intuition for this phenomenon",
    "let us compute ( according to the standard methodology ) the quantum fisher information at @xmath1 for the family @xmath241 where the input state is chosen to be @xmath242 and the initial state of the ` cavity ' is @xmath243 . since @xmath244 one can easily verify that @xmath245 and hence the quantum fisher information at @xmath1 is @xmath246 since @xmath247 the latter reduces to computing the squared norm of the vector @xmath248 where @xmath249 are the basis indices . since a basis vector containing @xmath250 indices equal to @xmath238 , can be obtained in @xmath250 different ways by applying the lowering operator to an input tensor , the coefficients are @xmath251 and the fisher information is @xmath252 thus , in contrast to the case of independent systems , the fisher information scales _ quadratically _ rather than linearly with the number of systems , hence the divergence of the quantum fisher information _ per atom _ which represents the asymptotic value of @xmath253 .",
    "note that similar quadratic scaling of the quantum fisher information is encountered in phase estimation @xcite and more generally in optimal estimation of unitary channels @xcite , with the difference that it holds for any parameter , rather than at a single point .",
    "we take a closer look at the the states @xmath23 by scaling the parameter as @xmath254 as suggested by the fisher information .",
    "this means that we know @xmath0 with an accuracy of @xmath255 ( rather than the usual @xmath256 ) and we would like to find if the the estimation of @xmath59 ` stabilises ' in the asymptotic regime . by using the same technique as in theorem [ th.qlan ] we have @xmath257|0 \\rangle\\ ] ] where @xmath258 is the map @xmath259 we expand @xmath174 as @xmath260 where @xmath261 plugging into we obtain the limit @xmath262|0\\rangle \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\langle 0 | \\exp(i   ( u - v)k ) |0\\rangle.\\label{eq.unitary1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this agrees with the quadratic scaling of the quantum fisher information at @xmath1 and shows that the quantum statistical model has a limit provided that the right scaling of parameters is used .",
    "let us now look at the @xmath7-steps reduced dynamics of the system for the same scaling @xmath30 with initial state @xmath263 .",
    "after a similar computation ( with @xmath264 ) we obtain @xmath265 which means that for large @xmath7 the system is effectively _ unitarily driven _ by the ` hamiltonian ' @xmath266 , even though we started with an open system dynamics ! this effect is interesting in itself and is reminiscent of the quantum zeno effect . from and we can conclude that asymptotically , the system and the output have pure states , and moreover the input passes undisturbed into the output @xmath267 in conclusion , unlike the ergodic case where the output contains information about the parameter , it is the system s state which carries all the information , and successive time steps amount to a simple unitary rotation .",
    "in particular , this explains the quadratic scaling of the quantum fisher information @xmath268 . in conclusion , the non - ergodic set - up exhibits interesting statistical features and should be analysed on its own in more detail . in particular , for practical applications",
    "it is important to see whether the quadratically scaled fisher information is achievable asymptotically .",
    "quantum system identification is an area of significant practical relevance with interesting statistical problems going beyond the state estimation framework .",
    "we showed that in the markovian set - up this problem is very tractable thanks to the asymptotic normality satisfied by the output state _ and _ the time average of the simple measurement process .",
    "this may come as a surprise considering that the output is correlated , but is in perfect agreement with the classical theory of markov chains where similar results hold @xcite .",
    "the theorems can be extended to strong lan with multiple parameters , continuos time dynamics , and measurements on several atoms . however , as in process tomography , full identification of the unitary requires the preparation of different input states .",
    "the optimisation of these states , and the case of non - mixing chains are interesting open problems .",
    "another open problem is to find the classical fisher information of the simple measurement _ process _ , rather than that of time averaged functionals .",
    "since markov chains are closely related to matrix product states , our results are also relevant for estimating matrix product states @xcite .",
    "when the chain is not - ergodic , the fisher information may exhibit a qualitatively different behaviour , such as quadratic rather than linear scaling with the number of output systems , which bears some similarity with that encountered in phase estimation @xcite .",
    "understanding this behaviour in a more general scenario , and the possible applications in precision metrology are topics for future research .",

    "for @xmath7 large enough @xmath174 has the same spectral gap property and we denote by @xmath270 its largest eigenvalue and the corresponding eigenvector such that @xmath271 and @xmath272      we prove that this is the case by using the taylor expasions @xmath277 then we can solve the eigenvalue problem in successive orders of approximation @xmath278 from the first equation we have @xmath279 .",
