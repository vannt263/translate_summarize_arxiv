    "as a function of concentrations and temperature , amphiphilic systems generically form many different phases , each of which corresponds to a specific geometrical arrangement of the amphiphilic interfaces @xcite .",
    "most ternary amphiphilic systems feature the disordered micellar , the hexagonal and the lamellar phase . here",
    "the amphiphilic monolayers , which separate regions of water from regions of oil , form spheres , cylinders and lamellae , respectively .",
    "however , many of these systems also have stable cubic phases @xcite . near",
    "the disordered micellar phase one often finds a micellar cubic phase and near the lamellar phase a bicontinuous cubic phase . in the micellar cubic phase , the interfaces form spheres as they do in the disordered micellar phase , only that now they are packed in an orderly fashion . in the bicontinuous cubic phase",
    ", they form sheets which span the whole sample in all directions of space @xcite .",
    "each of these triply periodic surfaces has a cubic bravais lattice and divides space into two unconnected but intertwined labyrinths filled with water and oil , respectively .    in this work ,",
    "the polymorphism of ternary amphiphilic systems is studied in the framework of a curvature model with non - vanishing spontaneous curvature .",
    "we assume that the shape of the amphiphilic monolayers is determined by their bending rigidity even in the presence of concentration constraints .",
    "therefore we model them by _ surfaces of constant mean curvature_. this encompasses the spheres , cylinders and lamellae of the non - cubic phases ; for the bicontinuous cubic phases , the surfaces of constant mean curvature are triply periodic .",
    "safran and coworkers considered the same geometries and showed that the interplay between the bending energy and the volume constraints can explain some aspects of the generic phase behavior of ternary amphiphilic systems @xcite .",
    "in particular , wang and safran @xcite considered the single structure ( one monolayer ) and the double structure ( two monolayers ) from the _ d - family_. their calculation relied on data for triply periodic surfaces of constant mean curvature , which were found numerically by anderson , who investigated the geometrical properties of the d , p , c(p ) , i - wp and f - rd families @xcite . however , the bicontinuous cubic phases most often identified experimentally are the various gyroid structures which correspond to the _ g - family_. data for the g - family were calculated only recently by groe - brauckmann @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we consider as bicontinuous cubic phases single and double structures for _ all _ families for which the required geometrical data are known , including the g - family . indeed",
    ", we find that for negative values of the saddle - splay modulus @xmath0 , of all bicontinuous cubic phases considered it is mainly the gyroid structures which are stable .",
    "they can exist for values of @xmath0 which are twice as negative as the values for which the structures from the d - family have been found to be stable previously @xcite .",
    "we will show that this finding can be explained nicely by considering the interplay between certain universal geometrical properties of the various bicontinuous cubic phases and the volume constraints within the gibbs triangle .",
    "in fact we find that the gyroid structures are so favorable because they have exceptional topological properties and at the same time can accommodate extreme volume fractions of oil and water .",
    "the elastic properties of amphiphilic interfaces are described by the canham - helfrich expression for the elastic energy per unit area @xcite @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are mean and gaussian curvatures , respectively , and @xmath5 and @xmath6 the two principal curvatures of the surface .",
    "the two elastic moduli are the bending rigidity @xmath7 and the saddle - splay modulus @xmath0 .",
    "the main temperature dependence is carried by the spontaneous curvature @xmath8 . for systems with water , oil and",
    "non - ionic surfactants @xmath9 , it is found experimentally that @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the balanced temperature @xcite .",
    "here positive curvature is defined to be curvature towards the oil regions , thus oil is the interior phase below the balanced temperature and water above .",
    "for example , @xmath12 and @xmath13 for @xmath14 at @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively , where @xmath17 is the amphiphile length in the monolayer and @xmath18 @xcite . in this work , we assume a positive value for the spontaneous curvature , as it is typical for surfactant systems below the balanced temperature , so that oil is the interior phase .",
    "the tendency to bend towards the oil regions decreases with temperature since the headgroups hydration decreases . for the case of a negative spontaneous curvature ,",
    "water and oil have to be interchanged in the various structures as well as in the phase diagrams presented below .",
    "this is usually the case not only for surfactants above the balanced temperature , but also for lipid systems where the monolayers tend to bend towards the water regions due to their bulky tail regions .",
    "we consider the dimensionless free energy per unit volume , @xmath19 where the integration extends over the neutral surface @xmath20 of the amphiphilic monolayers , @xmath21 is the overall volume , and @xmath22 . for the first (",
    "bending ) term in eq .",
    "( [ helfrichhamiltonian ] ) , the area integration can be carried out since we only consider surfaces of constant mean curvature .",
    "for the second ( topological ) term , we employ the gauss - bonnet theorem , @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the euler characteristic of the surface .",
    "the curvature model is only stable for @xmath25 or @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "experimentally there is no straightforward way to measure @xmath0 , but usually a small negative value is assumed .",
    "the phase diagram at constant temperature is a function of the volume fractions @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 of water , oil and amphiphile , respectively , which are restricted to the gibbs triangle by @xmath30 .",
    "we consider amphiphiles of length @xmath31 , which have a tail length @xmath32 and a head size @xmath33 , with @xmath34 . throughout this paper",
    "we will use @xmath35 , i.e.  we will consider amphiphiles which have head and tail regions of similar size , as they are for @xmath36 .",
    "the hydrocarbon volume fraction is given by @xmath37 @xcite . in order to parametrize concentration space",
    ", it is convenient to use @xmath38 and the ratio @xmath39 $ ] .",
    "the amphiphile volume fraction @xmath29 is taken to be @xmath40 .",
    "if the amphiphile is assumed to occupy the space between the two parallel surfaces at distances @xmath32 and @xmath41 from the neutral surface , this is a very accurate approximation when the amphiphile length @xmath31 is small compared to the extension of the amphiphilic aggregates , and gives reasonable results even for the extreme case of oil - free spherical micelles for @xmath42 .    in the following all lengths",
    "are measured in units of @xmath31 .",
    "the free - energy densities of the non - cubic phases follow from as @xmath43 \\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that only @xmath44 depends on @xmath45 , since the other two structures have no gaussian curvature .",
    "since we only consider the free - energy contribution due to the curvature elasticity of the amphiphilic monolayers , for the non - cubic phases @xmath46 has a trivial @xmath38-dependence .",
    "however , due to close packing , spheres and cylinders have maximal volume fractions @xmath47 and @xmath48 , respectively . with @xmath49 , @xmath38 and @xmath45 ,",
    "the model has a three - dimensional parameter space .",
    "it can be seen from that the maxwell construction is not possible for this model , since @xmath50 is not concave .",
    "therefore we use the intersections of the free - energy densities of different phases as an indication for the location of phase transitions .",
    "we want to remark parenthetically that wang and safran @xcite considered the free energy per unit area ( rather than per unit volume ) ; this amounts to an overall factor of @xmath51 ( the dimensionless specific area ) in the free - energy density of all phases .",
    "as long as the location of the phase transitions is estimated from the intersection of the free - energy curves , the two approaches are equivalent . however , for a calculation of two - phase regions , the use of the free energy per unit _ volume _ becomes essential  since in general coexisting phases will have different amphiphile concentrations .    for @xmath52 ( vanishing saddle - splay modulus ) and @xmath53 ( no excluded volume effects ) , eqs .",

    "spheres become more favorable , while cylinders are increasingly suppressed and finally disappear for @xmath58 . in particular , the phase boundaries @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 and the emulsification failure are obtained from eqs .",

    "it is important to realize that not all values of @xmath66 are physically relevant .",

    "we model the amphiphilic monolayers in the bicontinuous cubic phases by triply periodic surfaces of constant mean curvature @xmath78 . for the special case @xmath79",
    ", this leads to triply periodic minimal surfaces with @xmath80 and @xmath81 . due to the gauss - bonnet theorem , @xmath23 ,",
    "these surfaces have a negative euler characteristic @xmath24 per unit cell .",
    "triply periodic minimal surfaces are commonly used to model all kinds of extended sheet - like structures in condensed matter systems , in particular the mid - surfaces of the lipid bilayers in _ inverse cubic phases _ which are very prominent in lipid - water mixtures @xcite . before",
    "1970 only three cubic triply periodic minimal surfaces have been known ( d , p and c(p ) ) @xcite .",
    "then schoen described five more ( g , f - rd , i - wp , o , c - to and c(d ) ) @xcite .",
    "today some more examples are known @xcite , but none of them seems to be of physical relevance .",
    "karcher proved in 1989 not only the existence of the triply periodic minimal surfaces described by schoen , but also that the simpler of them can be deformed into triply periodic surfaces of constant ( non - zero ) mean curvature @xcite .",
    "as for any triply periodic surface , space is divided into two percolating labyrinths .",
    "a shift of @xmath82 to positive / negative values shrinks / expands one labyrinth , while it expands / shrinks the other .",
    "thus two branches are generated , which both end in cubic arrangements of ( infinitesimally connected and possibly self - intersecting ) spheres .",
    "since the euler characteristic is a topological quantity connected to the genus @xmath83 of the surface by @xmath84 , it does not change within a family .",
    "anderson studied the cubic families d , p , c(p ) , i - wp and f - rd and calculated for a conventional unit cell of unit lattice constant both the volume fraction @xmath38 of one labyrinth as a function of scaled mean curvature @xmath85 ( the volume fraction of the other labyrinth follows as @xmath86 ) and the scaled surface area @xmath87 as a function of @xmath38 @xcite . recently",
    "@xmath88 and @xmath89 were calculated also for the g - family by groe - brauckmann @xcite .    in this work",
    "we consider the families g , d , p , c(p ) , i - wp and f - rd , for which these geometrical data are available .",
    "their minimal surface member is shown in for d , c(p ) , i - wp and f - rd in one conventional unit cell .",
    "the numerically calculated data points for @xmath88 and @xmath89 per conventional unit cell are taken from refs .",
    "@xcite ; rearrangement and interpolation with cubic splines provides smooth functions @xmath88 , @xmath90 and @xmath89 .",
    "the data are used only up to the extremal values of @xmath38 , beyond which the curves bend backwards . beyond these points ,",
    "the surfaces resemble ensembles of spheroidal regions connected by nearly unduloidal necks , which we do not consider to be of physical relevance @xcite .",
    "the functions @xmath90 and @xmath89 as used in this work are plotted in for the six families considered .",
    "in fact , only one of the two curves for each family carries independent information since the other one can be constructed by using @xmath91 @xcite .",
    "each family only exists over a certain range of volume fractions ; the extreme cases are the g - family with @xmath92 $ ] and the c(p)-family with @xmath93 $ ] .",
    "if the minimal surface member of a family divides space into two congruent labyrinths , they have the same volume fraction @xmath94 , the two branches are symmetric to each other and the minimal surface as well as the family itself is called _",
    "balanced_. for the structures considered here , this is the case for g , d , p and c(p ) .",
    "for these structures , the curves @xmath90 and @xmath89 are symmetrical with respect to @xmath95 .",
    "for the non - balanced families i - wp and f - rd , the two labyrinths are of different topology and @xmath96 . in , we collect data connected to the minimal surface members of each family , which we will use later in our discussion .    in the vicinity of the minimal surface , the volume fraction @xmath38 as a function of scaled mean",
    "curvature @xmath85 can be approximated as @xmath97 . with @xmath98",
    "it follows that @xmath99 near the minimal surface .",
    "the values for @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 are given in .",
    "since the surfaces of constant mean curvature can be expected to have similar geometrical properties as parallel surfaces in the vicinity of a minimal surface , the magnitude of @xmath102 can be estimated as follows .",
    "if @xmath103 denotes the perpendicular distance from the minimal to its parallel surface , to lowest order in @xmath103 the volume fraction @xmath38 and the mean curvature @xmath85 , _ averaged _ over the surface in the whole unit cell , are given by @xmath104 and @xmath105 , respectively @xcite .",
    "thus @xmath106 and @xmath107 for the parallel surface case .",
    "the corresponding numbers are given in ; except for c(p ) , the overall agreement with the numerical data for @xmath102 is remarkably good .",
    "the simplest case of a cubic bicontinuous phase in a ternary amphiphilic system is a _ single structure _ where the amphiphilic monolayers form _ one _ triply periodic surface .",
    "then one labyrinth is filled with oil and the other with water . for balanced families , filling either of the two labyrinths with oil gives the same single structure ; for the non - balanced families i - wp and f - rd , this yields different single structures which we denote by i , wp , f and rd , respectively @xcite . here the symbols i and f correspond to the curves plotted for i - wp and f - rd in .",
    "since mean curvature is defined as curvature towards the oil regions , wp and rd follow by the replacements @xmath108 and @xmath109 from the data of i and f plotted in , respectively .",
    "thus , altogether we consider 8 different single structures , which exist for the volume intervals @xmath110 $ ] for g , @xmath111 $ ] for d , @xmath112 $ ] for p , @xmath113 $ ] for c(p ) , @xmath114 $ ] for i , @xmath115 $ ] for wp , @xmath116 $ ] for f and @xmath117 $ ] for rd .    to each single structure",
    "corresponds a _",
    "double structure _ where the amphiphilic monolayers form _ two _ triply periodic surfaces arranged roughly parallel and on either side of the minimal surface of the corresponding single structure .",
    "both surfaces divide space into two labyrinths which are topologically equivalent to those of the initial structure . however , since two amphiphilic monolayers are present , now these labyrinths are filled with the same component and separated by a bilayer which is filled with the other component .",
    "single and double structures are also known as monolayer and bilayer structures @xcite .",
    "a double structure can be either of type i ( water - filled bilayer ) or of type ii ( oil - filled bilayer ) @xcite .",
    "there will be no problem below to distinguish the symbol i for double structure of type i from the symbol i for one of the two simple structures of the i - wp family . in",
    ", we summarize the classification of bicontinuous cubic structures . in the following , single structures , type i double structures and type ii",
    "double structures are abbreviated as q , q@xmath118 and q@xmath119 , respectively .",
    "q@xmath119 structures are also known as _",
    "inverse bicontinuous cubic phases_. in we show single and double gyroid structures in one conventional unit cell . for many",
    "surfactant - water and lipid - water systems , g@xmath119 and/or d@xmath119 are well established ; moreover there are reports on p@xmath119 and g@xmath118 structures in these binary amphiphilic systems @xcite .",
    "q structures in binary systems have been discussed only theoretically so far @xcite . for many systems with water , oil and surfactant ,",
    "stable bicontinuous cubic phases have been reported , however often without identification of their space group ( see e.g.   ref .",
    "@xcite for the system @xmath120 ) .",
    "the best established identification is a number of q@xmath121 structures for the system ddab - water - styrene @xcite .",
    "there are a few reports on q structures @xcite , and none on q@xmath122 structures .",
    "however , several speculations on single structures can be found in the literature ( e.g.  in refs .",
    "@xcite ) , and our recent theoretical work on ternary systems with vanishing spontaneous curvature suggests that they should have some physical relevance @xcite . to our knowledge ,",
    "hardly nothing is known on bicontinuous cubic phases in ternary systems with water , oil and lipid .    in order to construct a double structure from a given family of triply periodic surfaces of constant mean curvature , we take two surfaces corresponding to @xmath82 and @xmath123 .",
    "thus there is one q@xmath122 and one q@xmath119 structure for each of the 6 families .",
    "for q@xmath122 structures , the minimal surface case corresponds to @xmath124 . as both surfaces accumulate mean curvature in their respective branches , the volume fraction decreases until the first labyrinth reaches its minimal size ( which is the minimal volume fraction of the corresponding single structure ) .",
    "the volume intervals covered by the q@xmath122 structures turn out to be @xmath125 $ ] for g@xmath118 , @xmath126 for d@xmath118 , @xmath127 $ ] for p@xmath118 , @xmath128 $ ] for c(p)@xmath118 , @xmath129 for i - wp@xmath118 and @xmath130 for f - rd@xmath118 .",
    "the q@xmath119 structures follow from the corresponding q@xmath122 structures by an interchange of oil and water .",
    "thus here the minimal surface case corresponds to @xmath73 , and the volume fractions covered are complementary to the ones given for the q@xmath122 structures .      for bicontinuous cubic structures ,",
    "the free - energy density depends on the hydrocarbon volume fraction @xmath38 in a non - trivial way , since only one or two amphiphilic aggregates are present .",
    "the lattice constant is denoted with @xmath131 . for a given value of @xmath38 , the mean curvature @xmath132 and the surface area @xmath133 within a unit cell",
    "are determined by the curves plotted in .",
    "the amphiphile concentration @xmath134 fixes @xmath131 , so that @xmath135 . using the gauss - bonnet theorem for the gaussian curvature term",
    ", we find from for the free - energy density of a bicontinuous cubic structure @xmath136 ^ 2   + r\\ \\frac{(w v)^3}{\\gamma(v)^2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath137 here @xmath24 denote the euler characteristic of the interfaces within one conventional unit cell , as given in .",
    "the _ curvature index _ @xmath138 and the _ topology index _ @xmath139 are two universal geometrical quantities which characterize a surface in three - dimensional space .",
    "their significance can be understood rather easily from the observation that both the mean and gaussian curvatures can be made dimensionless by multiplying them with appropriate powers of @xmath140 , which is the only relevant length scale ; this implies @xmath141 and @xmath142 and @xmath143 .",
    "the equivalence between these quantities and the isoperimetric ratios holds since for surfaces of constant mean curvature , the integral mean curvature , which is one of the minkowski functionals of integral geometry , can be replaced by @xmath144 .",
    "the curvature index @xmath145 describes how strongly the structures is curved and the topology index @xmath146 describes its porosity ( the larger its value , the less holes the structure has ) . for minimal surfaces , @xmath145 vanishes and",
    "@xmath146 remains the only relevant quantity .",
    "its significance for amphiphilic systems has been pointed out by hyde @xcite , and its variation as a function of crystallographic determinants has been studied recently by fodgen and hyde @xcite . for multicontinuous structures",
    "build from @xmath147 sheets , the curvature index is smaller and the topology index is larger by a factor of @xmath147 compared to the corresponding single structure . in particular , for double structures the curvature index is half and the topology index is twice as large as for single structures .",
    "thus , double structures are less porous than single structures since they have disconnected surfaces .",
    "we can infer from that the minimal gyroid is the least porous of the single structures with @xmath148 .",
    "we want to remark parenthetically that  surprisingly  bicontinuous random surfaces have similar values of @xmath146 as single cubic structures .",
    "for example , it can be shown exactly that the isosurfaces of gaussian random fields with @xmath149 have @xmath150 @xcite . since",
    "this value is only slightly larger than that of the single gyroid phase , it can be concluded that the random sponge phase on average features only few disconnected or multiple sheets .",
    "however , when the random sponge s interfaces are made to acquire curvature , the topology index grows strongly with @xmath145 since disconnected parts proliferate @xcite .",
    "the opposite is true for the families of surfaces of constant mean curvature considered here ; if the mean curvature is increased from zero , the topology remains the same , but the area content decreases .",
    "therefore the topology index decreases , since for given topology it measures the specific surface area .    in order to evaluate the free - energy density of the bicontinuous cubic phases from as a function of @xmath49 , @xmath38 and @xmath45 , curvature and topology index as defined in have to be calculated as a function of @xmath38 .",
    "for the 8 q structures , they follow in a straightforward way from the data plotted in . in order to derive them for the 6 q@xmath122 structures , we first consider the non - balanced case , thus the two labyrinths @xmath151 and @xmath152 have different topologies ( e.g.  for i - wp , we have @xmath153 and @xmath154 ) .",
    "we first construct @xmath155 and then invert it to obtain @xmath156 , the mean curvature of both surfaces as a function of the overall volume fraction ( which is distributed onto both labyrinths ) .",
    "the surface area then follows as @xmath157 .",
    "the euler characteristic is @xmath158 ( with @xmath159 given in ) . with @xmath156 , @xmath160 and @xmath161 calculated",
    ", we then can evaluate @xmath145 and @xmath146 in for the non - balanced q@xmath122 structures .",
    "for the non - balanced q@xmath119 structures , we have to evaluate them using @xmath162 , @xmath163 and @xmath164 . for the balanced families",
    ", one has @xmath165 , @xmath166 , @xmath167 , @xmath168 and @xmath169 .",
    "this amounts to using @xmath170 , @xmath171 , @xmath172 and @xmath173 in .",
    "note the minus sign for the curvature of the q@xmath119 structures since the monolayers change their orientation compared to the q@xmath122 structures . in we",
    "plot @xmath145 and @xmath146 as a function of @xmath38 for all single and double structures considered .",
    "recall that the minimal surface case corresponds to @xmath174 , @xmath151 and @xmath175 for q , q@xmath122 and q@xmath119 structures , respectively ; in these cases , the curvature index disappears and the topology index acquires its maximum value . in , we give the values of @xmath176 for all families considered .",
    "this implies the hierarchy g , d , i - wp , p , c(p ) , f - rd with decreasing @xmath177 . from",
    "we also see that the single structures i and wp in fact can become better than single d for certain values of @xmath38 .",
    "we see from that single structures for @xmath178 and all q@xmath119 structures have negative values for the curvature index @xmath145 . from it",
    "therefore follows that these structures have @xmath179 , compare ; thus they are always less stable than the lamellar phase . in other words , since we consider the case that the monolayers prefer to bend towards the oil regions ( positive spontaneous curvature @xmath8 ) , in the framework of the curvature model no phase can be stable which curves towards the water regions .",
    "one should note , however , that single structures for @xmath178 or q@xmath119 structures could occur even for positive @xmath8 if they were stabilized by other contributions to the free energy which are neglected in our treatment .",
    "for the case of negative @xmath8 , the situation is reversed : now the monolayers prefer to bend towards the water regions , and from the double structures the ( inverse ) q@xmath119 and not the q@xmath122 structures are stable . in general , for ternary systems one expects q in the middle of the gibbs triangle ( possibly in the vicinity of a microemulsion phase for surfactant systems ) , q@xmath180 near the binary side amphiphile - oil and q@xmath119 near the binary side amphiphile - water . for surfactant systems , which usually have @xmath181 at room temperature ,",
    "the curvature model predicts the stability of q and q@xmath180 structures ; for lipid systems , which usually have @xmath182 at room temperature , q and ( inverse ) q@xmath119 structures are predicted .",
    "this general prediction conforms with the predominance of inverse phases for lipid - water mixtures .",
    "note that the surfactant systems ddab - water - styrene @xcite mentioned above is an exception to our distinction between surfactant and lipid systems since the two tails result in @xmath182 and therefore lead to inverse phases like in the lipid case .",
    "altogether we consider 17 different phases , 3 non - cubic , 8 single and 6 double structures of type i. moreover there always exists an emulsification failure at low amphiphile - to - oil ratios .",
    "we first discuss the case of vanishing saddle - splay modulus , @xmath52 . for the bicontinuous cubic phases we see from that the optimal value @xmath183 for the free - energy density is achieved for @xmath184 $ ] . for the spherical and cylindrical phases we find @xmath185 and @xmath186 from eqs .",

    "we will denote them as _ lines of vanishing frustration _ since they mark the specific parameter values for which a given phase can satisfy both bending and concentration constraints simultaneously . in the @xmath66-plane ,",
    "each of the structures considered has such a line , thus each of them has some region of stability where its particular geometry serves best to accommodate the volume fractions of the different components .",
    "in fact there are even several values of @xmath188 where the free - energy density of different structures is degenerate . in b",
    "we map the lines of vanishing frustration from a onto the gibbs triangle for @xmath75 . for these values ,",
    "the q structures run towards the w - a side and the q@xmath122 structures towards the a - o side .",
    "although the lines of vanishing frustration for c(p ) , c(p)@xmath122 and f - rd@xmath122 are not mapped onto the gibbs triangle , the phase behavior here remains highly degenerate .",
    "a demonstrates that the different structural types considered occupy different regions of the phase diagram in a very characteristic fashion : for large @xmath49 , q and q@xmath122 structures are stable for @xmath189 and @xmath190 , respectively . with decreasing @xmath49 , the regions of stability curve to the left . in order to understand the sequence of phases within the band - like region of each structural type for large @xmath49 ,",
    "it is useful to expand the free - energy densities of the various bicontinuous structures about the minimal surface members by using . for the q and q@xmath122 structures",
    ", this corresponds to an expansion about the volume fractions @xmath101 and @xmath151 , respectively .",
    "again we only consider the lines of vanishing frustration for which @xmath183 and @xmath191 $ ] .",
    "the curvature index @xmath138 defined in can be approximated by @xmath192 in the same order of approximation , the lines of vanishing frustration then follow as @xmath193 and @xmath194 for q and q@xmath122 structures , respectively .",
    "thus the minimal surface case corresponds to the stable solutions for @xmath195 at @xmath196 and @xmath124 , respectively , where the curvature indexes of the corresponding structures disappear ( compare ) .",
    "for the balanced single structures and the double structures the hierarchy of the different phases within the band - like region occupied by a certain structural type is thus determined by the values of @xmath197 , which are given in for the 6 families considered .",
    "the only exception are the 4 non - balanced single structures , which can not be compared in this way , since the value for @xmath101 is different for each of them . using the approximation",
    "@xmath198 derived above , we find @xmath199 , so that the sequence is approximately determined by the topology index of the minimal - surface member of each family . in fact the structures in are ordered with decreasing @xmath177 . in particular , for a given structural type and values of the hydrocarbon volume @xmath38 outside the ( rather restricted ) @xmath38-intervals of existence of i - wp , f - rd and c(p ) , we expect from eq .",
    "( [ geometricalpropertiesapprox ] ) to find the sequence g - d - p as a function of either @xmath38 or @xmath49 .",
    "when the saddle - splay modulus becomes negative , so that @xmath201 , the free - energy densities of lamellae and cylinders do not change since these structures have vanishing gaussian curvature .",
    "however , spheres have positive gaussian curvature and therefore their free - energy density decreases ( compare ) . since bicontinuous cubic phases have negative ( integral ) gaussian curvature , their free - energy density increases ( compare ) and they will be suppressed towards large @xmath49 by the lamellar phase and towards small @xmath49 by the cylindrical phase ; these phases in turn will for sufficiently large @xmath45 be suppressed by the spherical phase . since ternary amphiphilic systems presumably have negative but small values of the saddle - splay modulus , the important questions here are up to which value of @xmath45 the bicontinuous cubic phases remain stable , and which of the 14 different structures considered performs best .",
    "it follows from that the relevant quantity is the topology index : the larger its value for a certain bicontinuous cubic structure which is stable for @xmath52 , the longer this structure stays stable with increasing @xmath45 . shows that for any value of @xmath38 , the double structures have larger geometry indices than single structures . within each of the two relevant structural classes ,",
    "it is the gyroid structure which has the largest value of the topology index ( compare ) .",
    "we therefore conclude that the double gyroid g@xmath122 should dominate phase behavior for @xmath200 for topological reasons .",
    "however , there are three restrictions to this general conclusion . first",
    ", g@xmath118 can only realize @xmath202 $ ] .",
    "second , before g@xmath122 can dominate all other bicontinuous cubic phases with increasing @xmath45 , it might be already dominated itself by the lamellar phase l and the cylindrical phase c. and third , since the topological term is weighted by a factor @xmath203 in , the double gyroid can not perform so well for small @xmath38 as it can for larger @xmath38 .",
    "our numerical results nicely corroborate this analysis and shows the exact outcome of the balance between the different principles mentioned . in we show phase diagrams as a function of @xmath49 and @xmath45 for @xmath204 , @xmath205 , @xmath206 and @xmath207 .",
    "since @xmath49 , @xmath38 and @xmath45 define the parameter space , these figures show nearly the complete phase behavior predicted by the model .",
    "only the subsequent mapping onto the gibbs triangle is affected by the chosen values for @xmath208 and @xmath8 . in , we draw the lines of constant @xmath49 , which marks the upper edge of the part of the @xmath209-plane which is mapped onto the gibbs triangle for @xmath35 and @xmath210 .",
    "the degeneracy of the bicontinuous cubic phases for @xmath52 discussed above disappears quickly with increasing @xmath45 .",
    "they eventually all disappear because the lamellar phase l and the cylindrical phase c become more stable . at @xmath211 ,",
    "c itself is suppressed by the spherical phase s. the double gyroid g@xmath118 remains stable for larger values of @xmath45 than all other bicontinuous cubic phases .",
    "in fact for @xmath212 ( b ) it is stable up to @xmath213 .",
    "this result stands in marked contrast to the results of ref .",
    "@xcite , which predicted that the most stable phase should be d@xmath122 with a stability limit of @xmath214 . for",
    "@xmath204 ( a ) the double gyroid can not exist and the single gyroid g is the only stable bicontinuous cubic phase .",
    "for @xmath215 ( d ) the single structures are not stable since their curvature index is negative for @xmath178 ( compare a ) .",
    "if more than one structure is stable within one structural class , we see the sequence g - d - p which was shown above to be determined by the topology index as well .    in we show the gibbs triangles for @xmath216 and @xmath75 , @xmath217 and @xmath75 , as well as @xmath218 and @xmath219 . in the first case of a very small value of the saddle - splay modulus , one still sees the degeneracy of the case @xmath220 . for the more negative value ,",
    "only the single gyroid g and the double gyroid g@xmath118 are stable . comparing with , we see that the g - phase is stable near its extremal volume fraction of @xmath221 , while the g@xmath222-phase is stable for a large range of volume fractions , which covers the region of the gibbs triangle where its line of vanishing frustration is located for @xmath52 .",
    "the effect of decreasing spontaneous curvature from @xmath223 in b to @xmath219 in c is to extend the region of stability of the lamellar and bicontinuous phases away from the w - a side , towards the center of the gibbs triangle .",
    "in order to calculate phase behavior of ternary amphiphilic systems , we investigated a simple curvature model with non - zero spontaneous curvature . in particular , we focused on the bicontinuous cubic phases whose interfaces were modeled by triply periodic surfaces of constant mean curvature .",
    "we showed that for this class of surfaces , the free - energy density of the bicontinuous cubic phases can be written in a very general form which emphasizes the universal geometrical character of the problem studied .",
    "it consists of two terms : the bending term depends on the curvature index @xmath145 and the topological term depends on the topology index @xmath146 .",
    "the relative strength of the two terms is determined by @xmath224 .",
    "the relevance of the two quantities @xmath145 and @xmath146 not only depends on @xmath45 , but also on the way by which they are weighted in the free - energy density by the two variables @xmath49 and @xmath38 which parametrize concentration space .",
    "several properties have to conspire for a specific phase to be stable at a certain point of the phase diagram .",
    "first , its geometrical properties have to allow to accommodate the given concentrations ( this imposes some constraints on the allowed values for the hydrocarbon volume fraction @xmath38 ) .",
    "second , the resulting mean curvature must be close to the given spontaneous curvature in order to keep the bending term small . since there are two independent degrees of freedom in concentration space , one of which is sufficient to adjust the mean curvature to its optimal value , the regions of stability are at least one - dimensional in the @xmath66-plane for @xmath225 .",
    "the exact location of these lines of vanishing frustration is determined by the curvature index @xmath138 .",
    "phases with negative curvature index @xmath145 are less stable than the lamellar phase . for positive spontaneous curvature ( monolayer bending towards oil regions )",
    ", this rules out the single structures for @xmath178 and the double structures of type ii .",
    "third , for @xmath200 the structure has to be favored by the topological term also .",
    "this requires large values for the topology index @xmath139 and basically favors the double gyroid g@xmath118 .",
    "fourth , the concentrations in the regions of stability have to be physically relevant , i.e.  they have to correspond to those of the gibbs triangle .",
    "the mapping of the phase diagram as a function of @xmath38 and @xmath49 onto the gibbs triangle depends on specific values for the amphiphile chain length @xmath208 and the spontaneous curvature @xmath8 and cuts off some of the phase behavior in the @xmath66-plane .",
    "the phase behavior for @xmath225 is highly degenerate .",
    "this degeneracy has been discussed already in ref .",
    "@xcite for the canham - helfrich hamiltonian without spontaneous curvature and concentration constraints . in order to resolve the question of the relative stability of the different bicontinuous cubic phases ,",
    "one has to consider further physical effects like topological contributions ( @xmath200 ) , van der waals , electrostatic or steric interactions , higher order curvature terms @xcite or packing energies for the hydrocarbon chains @xcite .",
    "our analysis shows that although every phase considered has some region of stability in phase space , there are certain general principles which allow to understand the complicated structure of the resulting phase diagram .",
    "the locations of the regions of stability are determined by the curvature index @xmath145 ; we have derived a simple approximation for @xmath145 , which is valid for large @xmath49 and explains why q and q@xmath226 structures are stable for @xmath189 and @xmath190 , respectively .",
    "moreover , it turns out that the sequence of phases within the band - like regions of a certain structural type is determined by the value of @xmath197 , which in turn can be well approximated by @xmath227 . thus the relative location of the different phases of one type",
    "is determined by the topology index of the minimal - surface member of that family .",
    "when the saddle - splay modulus becomes negative , more and more of the cubic bicontinuous phases disappear until eventually all of them are suppressed by the non - cubic phases .",
    "however , we found that the bicontinuous cubic phases remain stable for considerably higher values of @xmath45 than found previously @xcite .",
    "since the structure performs best which has both a high topology index and can accommodate large ranges of hydrocarbon volume fraction @xmath38 , the double gyroid g@xmath118 becomes the most stable bicontinuous cubic phase for increasing @xmath45 .",
    "note that g@xmath118 is the only double structure of type i where the oil - filled labyrinths consist of channels , which are connected by junctions of three - fold coordination exclusively .",
    "its outstanding stability with respect to @xmath45 can therefore be explained by the fact that it is the most cylinder - like of the bicontinuous cubic phases .",
    "the same geometrical property in fact can stabilize also the entropy - dominated microemulsion since low - coordinated vertices provide a lot of configurational entropy @xcite . since with increasing @xmath45 the double gyroid g@xmath118 is eventually suppressed by the lamellar and the cylindrical phase before it can suppress all other bicontinuous cubic phases , the single gyroid g ( with has the most favorable topology index within its structural type ) has a considerable region of stability as well .    in summary",
    ", we have demonstrated that the complicated phase behavior of bicontinuous cubic phases in ternary systems can be understood in terms of the interplay between their universal geometrical properties and the concentration constraints of a ternary system .",
    "the main result is that the gyroid structures are favored since they have the largest values for the topology index @xmath146 , that is the smallest porosity among the bicontinuous cubic phases .",
    "it should be pointed out , however , that this work rests on the basic assumption that all structures form surfaces of constant mean curvature .",
    "such surfaces arise as minima of @xmath228 under a volume constraint , or as minima of @xmath229 without volume constraint , but they are _ not _ solutions to @xmath229 under volume constraint  except for the special case of vanishing frustration , where the surface with @xmath230 just satisfies the volume constraint .",
    "it is easy to understand that , in general , surfaces of constant mean curvature do not minimize the curvature energy with volume constraint , since the energy can be lowered by keeping the mean curvature on the largest part of the surface very close to @xmath8 , and by concentrating deviations from @xmath230  which are enforced by the volume constraint  to a small part of the surface ( which therefore makes a small contribution to the curvature integral ) .",
    "however , since the regions of stability of most bicontinuous phases do not extend very far from the lines of vanishing frustration in the phase diagram , the deviations of the exact solutions from surfaces of constant mean curvature can be expected to be small for the physically relevant regions .    in this work , we focused on the case of finite and positive spontaneous curvature .",
    "its value can be controled in amphiphilic systems by changing temperature and disappears at the balanced temperature . above the balanced temperature ,",
    "the spontaneous curvature is negative and oil and water have to be interchanged in the structures and phase diagrams discussed .",
    "then the double structures of type i are replaced by the double structures of type ii ( the inverse phases ) and the phase boundaries in the gibbs triangle run predominantly towards the oil apex . for surfactant systems , the balanced temperature is usually well above room temperature @xcite .",
    "although the curvature model presented here predicts inverse bicontinuous phases above the balanced temperature , they are probably destroyed by thermal fluctuations in this case .",
    "for lipid systems , the balanced temperature is usually similar to the main transition temperature , and inverse phases are predicted even at room temperature . in accordance with experiments on both kinds of systems ,",
    "the model presented in this paper predicts that the lamellar phase dominates at the balanced temperature .",
    "however , since it assumes finite spontaneous curvature and neglects thermal fluctuations , it can not describe the bicontinuous microemulsion phase which for surfactant systems often coexists with the lamellar phase around the balanced temperature .",
    "we did not consider the effect of thermal fluctuations or long - ranged interactions .",
    "the special case of vanishing spontaneous curvature has been investigated in ref .",
    "it was found that for the canham - helfrich model , the elastic bulk and shear moduli vanish at @xmath231 .",
    "small higher order curvature terms make these moduli finite , but thermal long - wavelength fluctuations with large amplitudes should remain .",
    "an extension of this type of analysis to systems with spontaneous curvature has not been attempted so far . since the spontaneous curvature introduces a new length scale , many of the results of ref .",
    "@xcite should not apply in this case .",
    "however , large fluctuations on long length scales can still be expected .",
    "the contribution of the fluctuations to the free - energy density should be of the form @xmath232 , where a is the lattice constant , which is determined by the concentrations , and @xmath233 is a molecular length of the amphiphile @xcite .",
    "therefore , the thermal contributions to the free energy of different bicontinuous cubic phases should be very similar , and the sequences of stable bicontinuous cubic phases as a function of concentrations  as shown in and explained in terms of their geometrical properties in sec .",
    "[ sec : phasebehavior ]  should be observed in experiments .",
    "in fact for the system ddab - water - styrene a sequence of double structures was reported which seems to correspond to increasing topology index @xcite .",
    "for the non - cubic phases , thermal fluctuations correspond mainly to steric interactions between fluctuating lamellae and cylinders and translational entropy for spheres . extending the model by these contributions would in fact",
    "remove the non - concavity of their free energy densities .",
    "previous work suggests that the main effect for surfactant systems would be to favor micellar phases near the water - amphiphile side of the phase diagram and lamellar phases near the water - apex @xcite .",
    "such a modification could bring the calculated phase diagrams of in good qualitative agreement with experimental phase diagrams measured for the whole gibbs triangle , like the ones obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath120 . for a more detailed comparison , experimental structure determination for bicontinuous cubic phases in ternary surfactant systems",
    "is needed .",
    "the same holds true for ternary lipid systems where to our knowledge hardly any experimental data is known .    with respect to long - ranged interactions",
    ", it seems reasonable to assume similar effects for all bicontinuous cubic phases .",
    "for attractive / repulsive forces , we therefore expect all of them to be favored / disfavored to a similar degree . in principle",
    "such additional contributions could stabilize the bicontinuous cubic phases with negative curvature index . in regard to the non - cubic phases",
    ", it was shown previously that van der waals interactions should show a considerable effect only for large values of the bending rigidity , i.e.  for lipids @xcite .",
    "thus we predict that the geometrical arguments presented in this work describe the main physics of bicontinuous cubic phases in ternary amphiphilic systems with spontaneous curvature , even when more complicated models are considered .",
