    "in the last few years , ladder systems have been studied extensively @xcite .",
    "interacting electron systems in one dimension ( 1d ) are more or less well understood .",
    "there are several rigorous results available for such systems @xcite .",
    "powerful techniques like the bethe ansatz @xcite and bosonization @xcite have yielded much useful information about such systems . after the discovery of high-@xmath2 cuprate superconductivity , 2d interacting electron systems acquired new significance due to the fact that the dominant electronic and magnetic properties of the cuprate systems are associated with the @xmath3 plane @xcite .",
    "there are , however , very few rigorous results available for 2d systems . ladders , consisting of n - chains coupled by rungs , interpolate between 1d and 2d and their study is expected to be useful for a proper understanding of interacting many body systems .",
    "the possibility of deriving rigorous results is also more .",
    "a number of ladder systems have been discovered recently exhibiting a variety of interesting phenomena@xcite .",
    "physical insight obtained from the study of ladders is also expected to be relevant for high-@xmath4 cuprate systems .",
    "the cuprates , in the spin - disordered phase , are doped spin liquids .",
    "below optimal doping levels and well above the superconducting transition temperature @xmath4 , there are experimental signatures of a spin gap(sg)@xcite opening up .",
    "the gap has been ascribed to pre - formed cooper pairs of holes which lack the long - range phase coherence of the superconducting state .",
    "the cooper pairs become phase coherent only below @xmath4 giving rise to superconductivity .",
    "dagotto et al@xcite were the first to show that a two - chain ladder has a spin liquid ground state and a sg in the excitation spectrum .",
    "on doping the system with holes , binding of holes in pairs is possible , giving rise to dominant superconducting(sc ) pairing correlations .",
    "a few years later , a hole doped two - chain ladder system @xmath5 was discovered which exhibits superconductivity under pressure@xcite .",
    "the relationship between ` pseudo ' spin - gap , pre - formed hole pairs and superconductivity is not well - understood in the case of cuprate systems . for the ladder system ,",
    "the sg is a real gap and the binding of holes leading to sc pairing correlations can be explicitly demonstrated .",
    "resistivity measurements of the ladder compound @xmath6 show unusual temperature dependence as in the case of cuprates @xcitehighlighting further similarities between the two systems .",
    "bose and gayen @xcitehave constructed a two - chain t - j type ladder model for which several exact , analytical results can be derived in the undoped as well as doped cases . for two holes , the possibility of binding of holes",
    "was suggested but the bound state spectrum was not derived . in section",
    "ii of this paper , we give a detailed derivation of the low - lying spin and charge excitation spectrum of the ladder model in the two - hole sector .",
    "we show that the ground state consists of a bound pair of holes .",
    "the spin excitation spectrum has a gap and the charge excitation is gapless .",
    "the two - hole wave functions are also computed .",
    "the two - hole bound state wave function is shown to have modified d - wave symmetry .",
    "all these results are exact and analytic in nature .",
    "the dominance of sc pairing correlations in the ladder model is shown in an approximate , analytical manner .",
    "the two - chain ladder model consists of two chains , each described by a t - j hamiltonian , coupled by @xmath7 interactions between them ( fig.1 ) .",
    "the model is described by the @xmath0 hamiltonian : @xmath8 the constraint that no site can be doubly occupied is implied in the model .",
    "the hopping integral @xmath9 has the value t for nearest - neighbour(nn ) hopping within a chain and also for diagonal transfer between chains ( solid lines in fig.1 ) . the corresponding spin - spin interactions @xmath10 are of strength j. the spins have magnitude 1/2 .",
    "the hopping integral across vertical links ( broken lines ) connecting two chains has the strength @xmath11 .",
    "the corresponding spin - spin interaction strength @xmath10 is @xmath12 .",
    "we assume t and @xmath11 to be positive . in the conventional two - chain spin - ladder ,",
    "the diagonal interaction and hopping terms are absent .",
    "the inclusion of the diagonal terms of the same strength as the intra - chain ones enables one to reduce the difficult n - body problem to an easily solvable few body problem . the conventional spin ladder model , in the absence of diagonal terms , constitutes a many - body problem for which no simplification occurs . the only exact results , which are available , are numerical results based on exact diagonalization of finite ladders @xcite .    in the half - filled limit , i.e , in the absence of holes , the @xmath0-hamiltonian in ( 1 ) reduces to @xmath13+@xmath14 .",
    "the exact ground state @xmath15 ( for @xmath16 ) consists of singlets along the rungs of the ladder @xcite .",
    "the ground state energy @xmath17 , where n is the number of rungs .",
    "an exact excited state can be constructed by replacing a singlet by a triplet .",
    "creation of a triplet costs an amount of energy @xmath18 so that the spin gap @xmath19 .",
    "the excitation is localised and has no dynamics .",
    "let us now consider the case of a single hole doped into the ladder . in the presence of holes a single rung can exist in nine possible states : ( i ) empty , ( ii ) two bonding states , ( iii ) two anti - bonding states , ( iv ) one singlet state and ( v ) three triplet states . these states are shown below .",
    "@xmath20    a single hole hops in a background of antiferromagnetically interacting spins .",
    "this , in general , is a difficult many body problem because as the hole hops it gives rise to spin excitations in the system .",
    "the inclusion of diagonal hopping terms in our model leads to a cancellation of all the terms containing spin excitations , resulting in a perfect , coherent motion of the hole .",
    "we illustrate this through an explicit example .",
    "consider a single hole in a bonding state , located in the m - th rung .",
    "all other rungs are in singlet spin configurations .",
    "a pictorial representation of the state is @xmath21 @xmath22 the state is an exact eigenstate of the @xmath23 part of the @xmath0 hamiltonian .",
    "let us now apply @xmath24 on the state .",
    "since background electrons are fermions , their ordering is important and one has to keep track of signs during interchanges .",
    "the ordering of fermions follows the convention    135@xmath25@xmath25 + 246@xmath25@xmath25 +    on operating with @xmath24 on the state shown in ( 3 ) , one gets @xmath26    the states in the second column are obtained due to diagonal hopping of the hole .",
    "there is a cancellation of the terms containing parallel spin pairs and the final state is given by    @xmath27    one finds that the hole accompanied by a free spin-1/2 moves coherently by one lattice unit(compare with eqn.(3 ) ) .",
    "the eigenvalue problem now becomes very easy to solve .",
    "let @xmath28 @xmath29 @xmath30 is an exact eigenstate of the @xmath0 hamiltonian with the energy eigenvalue @xmath31 the energy is measured with respect to that of the ground state energy in the undoped state .",
    "refs.@xcite give a detailed discussion of the single hole spectrum for both bonding and antibonding hole states .",
    "for conventional spin ladders , troyer et al @xcite have found numerical evidence of quasi - particle ( qp ) excitations carrying charge + e and spin-1/2 .",
    "the charge and spin may be located on different rungs . in the exact eigenstate of eqn.(6 ) , the positively charged hole and the spin-1/2 are always located on the same rung .",
    "we refer to the composite object as hole -qp .",
    "let us now consider the case of two holes .",
    "the two holes can be introduced on the same rung or on separate rungs .",
    "other rungs are in the singlet spin configurations . if the holes are located on two separate rungs , there are two free spins which can combine to give either a triplet or a singlet . in the triplet sector , the two hole - qps can scatter against each other giving rise to a continuum of scattering states with energy @xmath32",

    "similar results are obtained when k is an odd multiple of @xmath43 .",
    "we now study the eigenvalue problem in the limit @xmath53 .",
    "the continuum of hole excited states , for real q , is given by eqn.(15 ) .",
    "for complex q bound and antibound states are obtained .",
    "let us now replace q by @xmath54 in eqns.(15,16 ) .",
    "since n is large , eqn.(16 ) reduces to @xmath55 from a simultaneous solution of eqn.(15 ) ( with q replaced by @xmath54 ) and eqn.(17 ) , one gets the following cubic equation in @xmath56 , @xmath57\\,+\\,e^q\\,[\\frac{3j}{4t^2}(\\,-\\,2\\,t^\\prime\\,+\\,3j^\\prime/4)\\,-\\,3]\\,-\\,(\\frac{3j}{4t})=0\\ ] ] the exact , analytic solutions of a cubic equation are given in ref.@xcite .",

    "there are at most two physical solutions of the cubic equation in ( 18 ) .",
    "once a solution for @xmath56 is obtained , the energy eigenvalue is obtained from eqn.(15 ) ( with q replaced by @xmath54 ) . for positive values of t ,",
    "one gets the solution for a bound state of two holes and for t -ve , a solution for the antibound state is obtained .",
    "the other values of the excitation branches are obtained by symmetry .",
    "fig.2 shows the exact energy spectrum for the bound state , continuum of scattering states and antibound states of two holes for @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "fig.3 shows the same for the parameter values @xmath60 ,",
    "@xmath61 and @xmath59 .",
    "the bound state of holes is obtained irrespective of the value of j / t being less than or greater than 1 .",
    "dagotto et al @xcite were the first to show the binding of two holes in a two - chain ladder system .",
    "their finding was based on exact diagonalization of finite - sized ladder systems .",
    "later , troyer et al @xcite also found evidence for the binding of holes in finite ladder systems . in the case of our model , we have shown exactly and analytically the binding of two holes for @xmath53 .",
    "for finite systems also , one can solve the eigenvalye problem exactly .",
    "the two - hole ground state is the bound state of two holes with centre of mass momentum wave vector k=0 .",
    "the exact bound state wave function is given by ( 13 ) with k=0 and q replaced by @xmath54 in ( 14 ) .",
    "in the limit @xmath53 , one obtains @xmath62 this result shows explicitly that the bound state wave function has an exponential decay as the separation between the two holes increases . with the knowledge of the eigenvalue @xmath63 , the ratio @xmath64 can be computed from the exact eigenvalue equations derived in ref.[13 ] .",
    "fig.4 shows a plot of @xmath65 versus r for the ground state wave function with parameter values @xmath66 and @xmath59(dotted line ) , @xmath67 ( solid line ) .",
    "when @xmath12 is much larger than j , the holes prefer to be on the same rung to minimise the loss in exchange interaction enrgy .",
    "the hole delocalization energy along the rung is , however , lost . when @xmath12 and j are comparable , @xmath65 has maximum value when holes are separated by approximately one lattice constant .",
    "the exchange energy loss is less when two holes are on nn rungs than when they are further apart .",
    "being on separate rungs , the holes gain in delocalization energy .",
    "the bound state is also more extended .",
    "these results are in agreement with the numerical results of troyer et al @xcite .",
    "the low energy modes of a ladder system are characterised by their spin .",
    "singlet and triplet excitations correspond to charge and spin modes respectively .",
    "the two hole ground state is in the singlet sector and , as already discussed , corresponds to a bound state of two holes for k=0 . since a hole bound state branch exists in the singlet sector , excitations with energy infinitesimally close to the ground state energy are possible .",
    "these excitations are the charge excitations since the total spin is still zero and the charge excitation spectrum is gapless .",
    "there are two distinct types of spin excitations .",
    "the first is the magnon ( s=1 ) excitation of the undoped ladder with energy @xmath12 measured with respect to the ground state energy .",
    "the spin triplet excitation appears on doping the ladder . for a pair of holes ,",
    "the lowest triplet excitation energy is @xmath68 from eqn.(8 ) .",
    "the lowest triplet excitation energy depends on the values of t , @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the spin gap energy @xmath69 is the difference in energies of the lowest triplet excitation and the ground state ( two hole bound state in the singlet sector ) energy .",
    "fig.5 shows @xmath69 versus j / t for @xmath70 and @xmath59 .",
    "thus , the two - chain ladder model has the feature that the charge excitation is gapless but the spin excitation has a gap .",
    "the same result holds true for the conventional spin ladder @xcite . in the notation cxsy @xcite(x gapless charge and y gapless spin excitations ) , the t - j type ladder model exists in the c1s0(luther - emery ) phase .",
    "the experimental evidence of hole based superconductivity @xcite in a ladder system provides the motivation to look for superconducting pairing correlations in our ladder model . we have already shown the existence of the two - hole bound state .",
    "define the pairing operator @xmath71 and consider the quantity @xmath72 @xmath73 and @xmath74 are the ground states in the case of zero and two holes respectively . for our ladder model , both of those ground states are exactly known and",
    "one can verify that @xmath75 and @xmath76 have opposite signs , @xmath77 and @xmath78 denote unit vectors in the x(along chain ) and y(along rung ) directions .",
    "this is a signature of d - wave pairing and shows that the bound state of two holes has symmetry of the d - wave type . in the case of cuprate superconductors",
    ", there is much experimental evidence that the pairing wave function has d - wave symmetry @xcite .    in the large @xmath12 limit",
    ", the ladder model can be mapped onto an effective boson model @xcite .",
    "the physical picture is that of bound hole pairs existing along rungs and moving in a background of rung spin singlets . the hole pairs can be considered as hard core bosons .",
    "the pair hopping matrix element to second order in perturbation theory is @xmath79 there is also an interaction @xmath80 between two hole pairs on nn rungs .",
    "to second order in perturbation theory , @xmath81 both @xmath82 and one can map the ladder model onto an effective hardcore boson model on a chain with nn interaction : @xmath83 @xmath84 is the hard core boson creation operator , creating a hole pair on the rung i and @xmath85=@xmath84 @xmath86 is the corresponding number operator .",

    "the disordered paramagnetic phase corresponds to the metallic phase for charged bosons .",
    "the afm @xmath91-type order in the z direction ( when @xmath92 ) describes the ordering of bosons on the lattice . for charged bosons ,",
    "one obtains an insulating charge - ordered phase .",
    "the transition from the paramagnetic to the afm phase represents a metal - insulator transition .",
    "the afm xy order @xmath93 is characterised by a two - component order parameter and in the bosonic language corresponds to the off - diagonal long range order of a superfluid condensate . for charged bosons ,",
    "this is the sc phase .    for the xxz chain ,",
    "the asymptotic forms of the correlation functions have been obtained by luther and peschel using bosonization theory @xcite . for @xmath94 ,",
    "the expressions for the correlation functions in the limit of large x and zero magnetic field are : @xmath95 @xmath96 where the exponent @xmath97 for the equivalent bosonic model , the correlation functions corresponding to ( 27 ) and ( 28 ) are the charge density wave(cdw ) correlation @xmath98 and the superconducting(sc ) correlation @xmath99 .",
    "the sc correlations are dominant if @xmath100 . for our ladder model , @xmath101 and @xmath102 ,",
    "i.e. , for large r both the cdw and sc pairing correlations exist . the transformed hamiltonian(eqn.(25 ) ) , however , contains a magnetic field term . in the presence of the magnetic field h@xmath103 ,",
    "the spin chain with @xmath104 is in a spin - flop phase @xcite which is equivalent to the sc phase in the bosonic theory .",
    "thus for our ladder model , the sc pairing correlations are dominant for large @xmath12 .",
    "we have considered a two - chain t - j ladder model for which several exact , analytical results can be derived for the case of two holes .",
    "inclusion of the diagonal exchange and hopping terms enables us to reduce the original n - body ( n-2 spins and two holes ) problem to an effective two - body problem which is easily solved .",
    "the ground state is a bound state of two holes with centre of mass momentum wave vector k=0 and total spin s=0 .",
    "the bound state wave function has modified d - wave symmetry .",
    "the charge excitation is gapless whereas the spin excitation has a gap .",
    "all the results derived by us are in agreement with the numerical results for the conventional two - chain spin - ladder . in the strong coupling limit ,",
    "our results are the only exact , analytical results for the lightly doped two - chain t - j ladder . for more than two holes ,",
    "we have not been able , as yet , to calculate the ground state and low lying excitation spectrum exactly and analytically .",
    "recently , in a remarkable paper @xcite , lin , balents and fisher have studied weakly interacting electrons hopping on a two - chain ladder . using bosonization and perturbative renormalisation - group(rg ) analysis ,",
    "they have shown that at half - filling the model scales onto the gross - neveu(gn ) model .",
    "the gn model happens to be integrable and has so(8 ) symmetry .",
    "for repulsive interactions , the two - chain ladder exhibits a mott insulating phase at half - filling with d - wave pairing correlations .",
    "the exact energies of all the low - lying excited states can be calculated because of the integrability of the gn model .",
    "lin et al further studied the effects of doping a small density of holes into the d - mott spin liquid phase at half - filling .",
    "again , for a pair of holes , the ladder system exists in a sg phase with hole binding in the ground state and gapless charge excitations .",
    "scalapino , zhang and hanke @xcite have considered the strong coupling limit of a two - chain ladder model with local interactions designed to exhibit exact so(5 ) symmetry .",
    "this model too has a sg phase with hole pairs in the ground state .",
    "numerical calculations on the t - j @xcite and hubbard ladders @xcite also show the existence of such a phase .",
    "thus , the sg phase with bound hole pairs appears to be a universal feature of the two - chain ladder system irrespective of the strength of the coupling .",
    "this phase also exhibits superconducting pairing correlations . for ladder systems",
    "the existence of a sg is favourable for the binding of holes . as mentioned in the introduction ,",
    "the existence of a ` pseudo - sg ' in the cuprates is conjectured to be associated with pre - formed cooper pairs of holes .",
