    "there are two topics in the mathematical physics that remained independent for a long time : the theory of isomonodromic deformations , initiated by r.  fuchs , p.  painlev and l.  schlesinger in the beginning of 20th century ( see @xcite and references therein ) , and the 2d conformal field theory ( cft ) founded by a.  belavin , a.  polyakov and a.  zamolodchikov in 1984 @xcite .",
    "both theories have wide range of applications .",
    "conformal field theory describes perturbative string theory and second order phase transitions in the 2d systems .",
    "the theory of isomonodromic deformations gives rise to non - linear special functions such as painlev transcendents , which appear in different problems of mathematical physics : for example , in the random matrix theory and general relativity .",
    "first relations between the theory of isomonodromic deformations and 2d quantum field theory have been established in 1978 - 80 by m. sato , m. jimbo and t. miwa @xcite .",
    "more recently , o. gamayun , n. iorgov and o. lisovyy have discovered that the @xmath1-function of the painlev vi equation ( related to the rank two fuchsian system with four regular singular points on the riemann sphere ) can be expressed as a sum of @xmath6 conformal blocks , multiplied by certain ratios of the barnes functions  a typical expansion of the correlation function in cft @xcite .",
    "their formula gives the general solution of painlev vi equation .",
    "this conjecture has already been proved in two ways : one proof is purely representation - theoretic and adapted initially for the 4-point @xmath1-function @xcite but can provide us with a collection of nontrivial bilinear relations for the @xmath7-point conformal blocks , whereas another one is based on the computation of monodromies of conformal blocks with degenerate fields and allows to consider an arbitrary number of regular singular points on the riemann sphere @xcite .",
    "the correspondence also extends to the irregular case : for instance , it gives exact solutions of the painlev v and iii equations @xcite , @xcite , which are known to describe correlation functions in certain _ massive _ field theories .",
    "the present paper is concerned with the extension of the isomonodromy - cft correspondence to higher rank . already in @xcite",
    "there was a suggestion that the monodromy preserving deformations of fuchsian systems of rank @xmath4 should be related to 2d cft with central charge @xmath8 .",
    "one obvious and natural candidate for such a theory is the toda cft with @xmath3 algebra of extended conformal symmetry .",
    "we show that indeed the @xmath9 isomonodromic problem corresponds to the @xmath3 algebra , whose virasoro part has central charge @xmath8 .",
    "these algebras were first introduced by a. zamolodchikov in @xcite , and their study was substantially developed in @xcite ( for the first nontrivial @xmath5-case ) and @xcite ( for generic @xmath3 ) .",
    "other developments in the theory of @xmath10-algebras are discussed in the review @xcite .",
    "the most condensed form of the commutation relations of @xmath5 is given by the operator product expansions ( opes ) of the energy - momentum tensor @xmath11 and the @xmath10-current @xmath12 :    t(z)t(w)&=++ , + t(z)w(w)&=++ , + w(z)w(w)&=++ + + 1(z - w)^2 ( .",
    "( 2)+120 ^ 2t(2))+    where @xmath13 .",
    "the representation theory of this algebra is very similar to that of the virasoro algebra . in the generic case one has the verma module with the highest vector @xmath14 such that @xmath15 , @xmath16 .",
    "hence the representation space is spanned by the vectors l_-m_1l_-m_2  l_-m_kw_-n_1w_-n_2  |,[verma],m_1m_2  m_k , n_1n_2 ",
    "n_k , while the set of the highest weight vectors themselves corresponds to primary fields ( vertex operators ) of the 2d cft .",
    "as in the virasoro case , these fields can be determined by their opes with higher - spin currents @xmath11 and @xmath12 :    t(z)(w)&=++ + w(z)(w)&=+++[vertex ]    however , the w - descendants such as @xmath17 and @xmath18 are not defined in general ( this is to be contrasted with the virasoro case where one has e.g. @xmath19 ) , which means that the 3-point functions involving such fields are not really defined . as a consequence , one can not express the matrix elements @xmath20 in terms of @xmath21 only .",
    "it was shown in @xcite in an elegant way that all such 3-point functions can be expressed in terms of an infinite number of unknown constants c_k=_,_|(1)w_-1^k|_0,_0 , k=1,2,  [ck ]    the problem is that having this infinite number of constants ( which for the 4-point conformal block actually becomes doubly infinite ) one can adjust them as to obtain @xmath22 function as a result . in this paper",
    "we show that the isomonodromic approach can fix this ambiguity in such a way that all these parameters become functions on the moduli space of the flat connections on the sphere with 3 punctures . in the @xmath23 case",
    "this space is 2-dimensional ( we denote the corresponding coordinates by @xmath24 and @xmath25 ) , so all @xmath26 .    note that for the @xmath3 algebra one would have the set of constants @xmath27 with @xmath28 non - negative indices ( e.g. , this easily follows from analysis of @xcite ) , which is half of the dimension of the moduli space of flat @xmath0 connections on the 3-punctured sphere .    the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we briefly discuss the origins of the schlesinger system and the space of flat connections on the punctured riemann sphere .",
    "then we introduce a collection of convenient local coordinates on this space , which are related to pants decomposition of the sphere . in section 3",
    "an iterative algorithm of the solution of the schlesinger system is proposed .",
    "we then present a set of non - trivial properties of this solution , discovered experimentally , and put forward a conjecture about isomonodromy - cft correspondence in higher rank , which relates @xmath3 conformal blocks to the isomonodromic tau function .",
    "in particular , for a collection of known @xmath5 conformal blocks we present the 3-point functions that can be used to construct the @xmath1-function in the form of explicit expansion . in section 4",
    "we describe the problems of definition of the general @xmath5 conformal block and discuss how they can be addressed using the global analytic structure induced by crossing symmetry .",
    "we conclude with a brief discussion of open questions .",
    "the main object of our study will be the fuchsian linear system    ( z)&=_=1^n(z)=a(z)(z ) , + _ & = 0.[linearsystem ]    here @xmath29 are traceless matrices with distinct eigenvalues , @xmath30 is the matrix of @xmath4 independent solutions of the system normalized as @xmath31 .",
    "it is obvious that upon analytic continuation of the solutions along a contour @xmath32 encircling @xmath33 they transform into some linear combination of themselves :    _ : ( z)(z)m _ , where @xmath34 . the relation @xmath35 from @xmath36 imposes the condition m_1  m_n=1.[pi1 ] the well - known riemann - hilbert problem is to find the correspondence \\{m_1,",
    " ,m_n}\\{a_1,  ,a_n}. it is easy to see that the conjugacy classes of @xmath37 are m_~(2i a _ ) .",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath29 determine the asymptotics of the fundamental matrix solution near the singularities , so one can fix even this asymptotics and study the corresponding refined riemann - hilbert problem .",
    "we will work only with traceless matrices @xmath29 since the scalar part trivially decouples .      since it is difficult to solve the generic riemann - hilbert problem exactly",
    ", one can first ask a simpler question : how to deform simultaneously the positions of the singularities @xmath33 and matrices @xmath29 but preserve the monodromies @xmath37 .",
    "the answer follows from the infinitesimal gauge transformation    ( z)&(1+)(z ) , + a(z)&a(z)+- ,    that is    z_&z_+ , + a_&a_+ , + a_&a_- _ ,    leading to the schlesinger system of non - linear equations    & = , + & = -_.",
    "note that one can fix @xmath38 , then the corresponding matrix @xmath39 will be constant .",
    "a non - trivial statement is that the relations = _ are compatible and define the @xmath1-function @xmath40 of the schlesinger system .",
    "it is easy to see that the 3-point @xmath1-function is given by a simple expression : @xmath41 where @xmath42 .",
    "let us now attempt to solve the schlesinger system for the 4-point case and compute the corresponding @xmath1-function in the form of certain expansion .",
    "the main object of our interest is the @xmath1-function .",
    "it depends on monodromy data which provide the full set of integrals of motion for the schlesinger system .",
    "it will be useful to start by introducing a convenient parametrizaton of this space .",
    "one starts with @xmath7 matrices @xmath43 , with fixed nondegenerate eigenvalues , i.e. there are @xmath44 parameters .",
    "these matrices are constrained by one equation ( [ pi1 ] ) and are considered up to an overall @xmath45 conjugation , which decreases the number of parameters by @xmath46 . so the resulting number of parameters is _",
    "n^_n(_1,  ,_n)=(n-2)n^2-nn+2",
    ". here @xmath47 ( @xmath48 is the cartan subalgebra ) define the conjugacy classes : @xmath49 .",
    "it is obvious that @xmath50 is equivalent to @xmath51 , such that for all weights of the first fundamental representation @xmath52 one has @xmath53 .",
    "it means that @xmath54 , where @xmath55 are simple coroots ( for the simply - laced case they coincide with the roots ) .",
    "for the general lie algebra this formula can be written as _",
    "n^g(_1,  ,_n)=(n-2)-n . in particular , for @xmath56 punctures on the sphere @xmath57",
    "this formula gives the number of non - simple roots of @xmath58 . in the @xmath0 case it specializes to _ 3^_n(_1,_2,_3)= ( n-1)(n-2 ) .",
    "this expression vanishes for @xmath59 , which drastically simplifies the study of the corresponding isomonodromic problem .",
    "however already for @xmath23 this dimension is equal to 2 , i.e. it is nonvanishing . one way to simplify",
    "the problem is to set @xmath60 : in this case the orbit of the adjoint action @xmath61 has the dimension @xmath62 .",
    "the total dimension is @xmath63 . in this calculation",
    "the first two terms correspond to the dimensions of orbits : two generic and one with a large stabilizer .",
    "the last term corresponds to one equation and one factorization . hence _",
    "this case is the best known on the side of @xmath10-algebras @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . in the mathematical framework",
    ", this situation corresponds to rigid local systems .",
    "we begin our consideration with an arbitrary lie group @xmath65 containing a cartan torus @xmath66 .",
    "the corresponding lie algebras are @xmath67 and @xmath68 , respectively . at some point",
    "we will switch to @xmath69 case .",
    "the moduli space @xmath64 is described by 4 matrices satisfying @xmath70 , defined up to conjugation : _",
    "4^=\\{(m_1,m_2,m_3,m_4)}/g . let us introduce @xmath71 and consider two triples \\{(m_1,m_2,s^-1),(s , m_3,m_4)}. note that the products inside each of these triples are equal to the identity .",
    "let us now choose the submanifold with fixed eigenvalues of @xmath72 .",
    "one may also use the freedom of the adjoint action to diagonalize @xmath73 @xmath74 where @xmath75 .",
    "we thereby obtain a submanifold _",
    "4^(_1,_2;;_3,_4)= \\{(m_1,m_2,e^-2i),(e^2i , m_3,m_4)}/h_4^ ( _ 1,_2,_3,_4 ) , where the remaining factorization is performed over the cartan torus @xmath66 .",
    "it is very similar to what happens for @xmath76 : _",
    "3^=\\{(m_1,m_2,m_3)}/g=\\{(m_1,m_2,e^2i_3)}/h , except that the conjugation is simultaneous for both triples . to relax this condition ,",
    "let us define an extra cartan torus acting on @xmath64 : h : \\{(m_1,m_2,e^-2i),(e^2i , m_3,m_4)}\\{(m_1,m_2,e^-2i),h^-1(e^2i , m_3,m_4)h } , which looks like a relative twist of one part of the sphere with respect to another ( in the @xmath59 case it will be exactly the geodesic flow ) .",
    "therefore one can say that ^_4(_1,_2;;_3,_4)/h=^_3 ( _ 1,_2,-)^_3(,_3,_4 ) .",
    "the torus action is free , so locally it looks as a product ( actually it is true even globally because the fibration @xmath77 is trivial : we can give an algebraic parametrization for one representative from each conjugacy class ) .",
    "therefore we have the equality for the open subsets ( denoted by @xmath78 ) : ^_4(_1,_2;;_3,_4)^_3 ( _ 1,_2,-)h^_3(,_3,_4 ) .",
    "the above considerations suggest the following choice of coordinates on @xmath64 :    * gluing parameters @xmath79 : @xmath80 items . * invariant functions on @xmath81 ( for example , @xmath82 , @xmath83 ) .",

    "the coordinates on each copy of @xmath90 are denoted by @xmath91 .",
    "the indices @xmath92 of the matrices are replaced by @xmath93    : eight = two @xmath79 s + two @xmath94 s + @xmath95,width=264 ]      suppose that the coordinates on @xmath97 are chosen via the pants decomposition .",
    "split the matrices into two groups and define @xmath98    _ n^&=\\{(m_1,  ,m_n-2,s_n-3 ^ -1),(s_n-3,m_n-1,m_n)}/g= + & = \\{(m_1,  ,m_n-2,e^-2i),(e^2i , m_n-1,m_n)}/h_n-1^h_3^.    iteratively repeating this procedure , one is led to the following choice of coordinates on @xmath96 :    * @xmath99 gluing parameters @xmath100 , * @xmath99 relative twist parameters @xmath101 , * @xmath102 3-point moduli of flat connections ( here we identify @xmath103 and @xmath104 ) .",
    "anticipating the result , let us mention that these coordinates are convenient from the cft point of view : @xmath100 will parametrize intermediate charges in the conformal block and @xmath101 will be the fourier transformation parameters . this description was shown to be valid in the @xmath59 case @xcite , @xcite and was recently demonstrated to hold for @xmath0 case with @xmath105 @xcite .",
    "from a more conceptual point of view , this decomposition illustrates that all extra parameters in the @xmath1-function expansion come from the 3-point functions .",
    "in order to study the generic schlesinger system , let us follow the approach proposed in the original paper of m. jimbo @xcite and in @xcite .",

    "_ t=1ta_ta_0 + 1t-1a_ta_1 .",
    "let us study the solution of the system ( [ schles0 ] ) for the case when @xmath108 is finite in the limit @xmath109 : @xmath110 .",

    "we see that in view of its definition @xmath114 describes the total monodromy around @xmath115 and @xmath116 in the limit @xmath117 .",
    "since the deformation is isomonodromic , this monodromy is constant and is given by @xmath118 .",

    "here we see an operator @xmath119 , which produces some fractional powers of @xmath116 .",

    "we know that in the lie algebra the operator @xmath119 acts by    t^e_t^-&=t^(,)e _ , + t^h_t^-&=h _ ,    where @xmath123 is a root and @xmath124 , @xmath125 are the elements of the cartan - weyl basis .",

    "one can also see that the degrees present in @xmath133 are larger then in @xmath132 if @xmath79 is sufficiently small ( @xmath134 ) .",
    "we also define a slightly ambiguous notation @xmath135 by t^k+(,w)v_n , w(kn ) .",
    "now we have all the ingredients that are necessary for the construction of an iterative solution of the system ( [ schles ] ) .",
    "our initial data will be given by the triple of matrices @xmath79 , @xmath136 and @xmath137 .",
