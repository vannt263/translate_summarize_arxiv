    "considerable experimental effort has been made in measuring proton - deuteron ( pd ) scattering @xcite cross sections at intermediate energies . for up to 300  mev proton energy those data",
    "have been analyzed with rigorous three - nucleon ( 3n ) faddeev calculations  @xcite based on the cd - bonn potential  @xcite and the tucson - melbourne 3n force ( 3nf ) @xcite .",
    "theoretical predictions based on 2n forces alone are not sufficient to describe the data above about 100 mev .",
    "some of those defects are known as the sagara discrepancy  @xcite .",
    "though 3nf effects are already seen below 100 mev , they increase significantly above that energy .",
    "however , presently available 3nf s only partially improve the description of cross section data and spin observables .",
    "since most of the cited calculations are based on the non - relativistic formulation of the faddeev equations  @xcite , one needs to question if in the intermediate energy regime a poincar invariant formulation is more adequate .",
    "there are two basic approaches to a relativistic formulation of the 3n problem .",
    "one is a manifestly covariant scheme linked to a field theoretical approach  @xcite , the other is based on an exact realization of the symmetry of the poincar group in three nucleon quantum mechanics  @xcite .",
    "we employ the second approach , where the mass operator ( rest energy operator ) consists of relativistic kinetic energies together with two- and many - body interactions including their boost corrections  @xcite .",
    "the first attempt in solving the relativistic faddeev equation for the 3n bound state based on second approach has been carried out in  @xcite , resulting in a decrease of the binding energy compared to the nonrelativistic result . on the other hand , similar calculations based on the field theory approach  @xcite",
    "increase it .",
    "these contradictory results require more investigation . in the following we",
    "summarize the results of our calculations based on the second approach : in section 2 we introduce the relativistic 2n potential , in section 3 we present the 2n t - matrix , which fulfills the relativistic boosted lippmann - schwinger ( ls ) equation , and in section 4 we give numerical results for the triton binding energy based on the poincar invariant faddeev equation .",
    "modern meson theoretical nn potentials , e.g. charge dependent bonn potential ( cd - bonn )  @xcite , are derived from a relativistic lagrangian , then cast into a three - dimensional form using the blankenbeclar - sugar equation , which by kinematical redefinitions can be written in the form of a standard nonrelativistic ls equation , which in partial wave decomposed form reads @xmath1 the corresponding relativistic ls equation is given as @xmath2 where @xmath3    in the relativistic faddeev equation one needs @xmath4 off - the - energy - shell . according to @xcite there is a direct operator relation between the nonrelativistic @xmath5 and the relativistic @xmath6 : @xmath7 in a momentum representation this leads to @xmath8 this is the nonlinear relation between the relativistic potential @xmath6 and the nonrelativistic potential @xmath5 from eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) , which has recently been solved  @xcite .",
    "the resulting on - shell - t - matrix @xmath4 is on - shell identical to the t - matrix @xmath9 from eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "cluster properties require that the energy is additive . because of the non - linear relations between the mass and energy in special relativity",
    ", the additivity of energies in the rest frame implies a non - linear relation between the two - body interactions in the two and three - body mass operators  @xcite .",

    "( [ eq6 ] ) this can be rewritten as  @xcite @xmath12 thus one can obtain @xmath13 by the same technique  @xcite as @xmath14 .",

    "the magnitude of the t - matrix gradually decreases with increasing the boost momentum @xmath11 .",
    "it can be shown  @xcite that the half - shell t - matrices @xmath19 and @xmath20 are related by simple factors @xmath21 solving eqs .",
    "( [ eq5 ] ) and ( [ eq10 ] ) to obtain @xmath4 and @xmath22 independently we numerically confirmed the relation ( [ eq11 ] ) with high precision .",

    "this value is significantly smaller than a previously published result  @xcite in which a reduction of the triton binding energy by about 400  kev was given .",
    "the reason for this overestimation of a relativistic effect on the binding energy can be attributed to a different construction of the relativistic off - shell t - matrix @xmath4 .",
