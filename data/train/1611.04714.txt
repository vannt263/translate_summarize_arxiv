    "srruo@xmath2 is one of the rare 4@xmath3 transition - metal oxides that shows a ferromagnetic order and has attracted considerable interest due to its fascinating electronic and magnetic properties .",
    "this compound has a pseudocubic perovskite structure ( a gdfeo@xmath2 type orthorhombic structure ) .",
    "its curie temperature @xmath6 and ordered ferromagnetic moment are 160 k and approximately 1@xmath7/f.u . , respectively.@xcite the fundamental and important question concerning this compound is how the electron correlation effect affects its electronic properties . at first glance , because ru 4@xmath3 electrons are generally expected to have a delocalized nature in the crystal , it is natural to consider that the electron correlation effect is not significant and that the ferromagnetic order can be described well in terms of the stoner theory in an itinerant electron picture .",
    "however , this compound shows so - called bad metal behavior , and its resistivity exceeds the ioffe - regel limit at high temperatures , indicating a breakdown of the quasi - particle description.@xcite optical spectroscopy has shown that the charge dynamics deviate from fermi liquid behavior.@xcite moreover , the rhodes - wohlfarth ratio @xmath8/@xmath9 , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 represent the paramagnetic dipole moment estimated from the curie constant and the ordered moment at zero temperature , respectively , is approximately 1.3.@xcite this value indicates that srruo@xmath2 is close to the localized - moment limit .",
    "these results imply that the correlation effect of the ru 4@xmath3 electrons plays an important role and that the electronic state is not conventional .",
    "photoemission ( pes ) spectroscopy provides a direct probe into the electronic band structure .",
    "a number of pes experiments have been carried out to clarify the electronic state of srruo@xmath2 .",
    "earlier pes studies reported that although the overall structure of the valence spectra consisting of the ru 4@xmath3 and o 2@xmath10 states was roughly reproduced by calculations based on the density functional theory ( dft ) , the ru 4@xmath3 derived peak near the fermi level ( @xmath11 ) was strongly suppressed compared to that derived from dft calculations.@xcite however , subsequent pes studies have revealed , by using bulk sensitive soft x - rays and/or @xmath12 @xmath13 grown thin film samples , that pes spectra are very sensitive to surface conditions , and the valence spectra of the earlier pes studies were largely influenced by the extrinsic surface electronic states.@xcite these subsequent pes studies demonstrated that their valence spectra exhibit a pronounced peak originating from the ru 4@xmath3 state just below @xmath11 as predicted by dft calculations , showing that dft calculations based on an itinerant electron picture can be a good starting point to describe the electronic state of srruo@xmath2 .",
    "however , following experimental observations in pes investigations suggest that the ru 4@xmath3 electrons also have localized characteristics . the pes spectra show an incoherent feature , which is not reproduced in dft calculations .",
    "this incoherent feature is possibly originating from the electron correlation effect and has been reproduced in a recent calculation based on the combination of the dft and the dynamical mean - field theory ( dft+dmft ) , which can incorporate the electron correlation effect beyond the conventional dft.@xcite in addition , recent angle - resolved pes and optical conductivity experiments have shown that the temperature dependence of ferromagnetic exchange splitting is markedly weaker than that predicted in the stoner theory.@xcite it has been suggested in these studies that exchange splitting persists above @xmath6 but that the long - range ferromagnetic order is destroyed by the spatial and temporal fluctuations of the exchange splitting in a local region above @xmath6 . this fluctuating exchange splitting in a local region above @xmath6 is reminiscent of localized magnetic moments .",
    "therefore , it is considered that the ru 4@xmath3 electrons in srruo@xmath2 have both local and itinerant characteristics .",
    "in fact , the ru 4@xmath3 electrons in srruo@xmath2 have an instability toward electron localization due to the correlation effect .",
    "substituting mn for ru suppresses the ferromagnetic order and induces an antiferromagnetic insulating phase above @xmath1435% of mn concentration.@xcite similar insulating phases have been found for several other ru site substituted systems.@xcite the substitution of la for sr also reduces the ferromagnetic order.@xcite we have recently reported that the ferromagnetic order in sr@xmath0la@xmath1ruo@xmath2 changes into a cluster - glass state for @xmath4 @xmath15 0.3 , whereas the metallic character is retained up to at least @xmath4 = 0.5.@xcite the ac susceptibility depends markedly on the frequency near the cluster - glass ordering temperature @xmath16 , and the frequency dependence of @xmath16 follows the vogel - fulcher law .",
    "furthermore , @xmath17sr investigations for @xmath4 @xmath15 0.3 demonstrated that magnetic clusters start developing well above @xmath16 and that the magnetic ordering process of the cluster - glass state is strikingly different from that expected for a conventional long - range ferromagnetic order.@xcite note that the emergence of a cluster - glass state is an indication of the localized character of the ru 4@xmath3 states because it reflects the presence of spatial inhomogeneities in the magnetism .",
    "we have also revealed that the electronic specific - heat coefficient increases significantly with la doping , indicating that la doping may enhance the effective mass of the conduction electrons due to the electron correlation effect.@xcite in this study , we performed pes measurements using soft x - rays to study how the electronic state of sr@xmath0la@xmath1ruo@xmath2 evolves with la doping and to observe the tendencies of the electron localization indicated by the emergence of the cluster - glass state .",
    "polycrystalline samples of sr@xmath0la@xmath1ruo@xmath2 for @xmath4 @xmath18 0.5 were prepared by the conventional solid - state reaction method as reported previously.@xcite pes experiments were carried out at the soft x - ray beamline bl23su in spring-8.@xcite the base pressure in the sample chamber was maintained below 2@xmath1910@xmath20 pa during the measurements . to obtain clean surfaces ,",
    "the samples were fractured @xmath12 @xmath13 just before the measurements under ultrahigh vacuum conditions .",
    "the pes spectra were measured using a vg - scienta ses2002 analyzer .",
    "the energy resolution was approximately 120 mev at a photon energy of @xmath21 = 700 ev and increased up to 300 mev at @xmath21 = 1100 ev .",
    "the position of @xmath11 was calibrated by measuring the fermi edge of an evaporated gold film .",
    "the sample temperature was controlled by a he - flow cryostat , and the pes spectra were collected over a temperature range from 25 to 200 k. measurements of the x - ray absorption spectrum ( xas ) were performed in the total - electron - yield mode .",
    "figure 1 shows the pes spectra of sr@xmath0la@xmath1ruo@xmath2 .",
    "the sample temperature was maintained at 25 k during data collection . at this temperature ,",
    "the samples with @xmath4 @xmath18 0.2 were in ferromagnetic ordered states , and samples with @xmath4 @xmath15 0.3 , which exhibit cluster - glass states at low temperatures , were in paramagnetic states.@xcite however , it should be mentioned here that the valence spectra hardy depend on the temperature in the temperature and @xmath4 range investigated here , as shown later in this section .",
    "the incident photon energy was 700 ev . at this photon energy , the ru 4@xmath3 ,",
    "o 2@xmath10 , and la 5@xmath3 states have relatively large pes cross - sections , whereas the contributions from other valence electrons , such as ru 5@xmath22 , sr 5@xmath22 , and la 6@xmath22 , are essentially negligible because their contributions are approximately two orders of magnitude smaller than that of ru 4@xmath3.@xcite the spectrum for @xmath4 = 0 is very similar to those of previous pes studies using soft x - rays.@xcite the peak just below @xmath11 extending to approximately @xmath23 ev originates from the ru 4@xmath3 states , and the intensity distributed from @xmath23 to @xmath24 ev is mainly attributed to the o 2@xmath10 states.@xcite the line shape of the intensity of the o 2@xmath10 states does not exhibit any noticeable change with la doping .",
    "we normalize these spectra by the spectral area from -2.5 to -10 ev , which roughly corresponds to the total intensity of the o 2@xmath10 states .",
    "although the la 5@xmath3 states , whose pes cross - sections are comparable that of o 2@xmath10 at @xmath21 = 700 ev,@xcite also contribute to this energy range with increasing @xmath4 as shown later in this section , the la 5@xmath3 contribution compared to the total intensity of the o 2@xmath10 states is less than few percent and essentially negligible by the following reason . the total number of o 2@xmath10 electrons is roughly 18/f.u . assuming that the o 2@xmath10 bands are nearly fully occupied as predicted by dft calculations,@xcite whereas the total number of la 5@xmath3 electrons is considered to be less than 0.5 at most for @xmath4 @xmath18 0.5 .",
    "the shape of the ru 4@xmath3 derived peak shows remarkable change ; the intensity just below @xmath11 is suppressed with increasing @xmath4 , and the intensity develops near @xmath25 ev ( indicated by the arrow in fig .",
    "it has generally been recognized in previous pes studies that the peak just below @xmath11 and the broad spectral weight near @xmath25 ev in srruo@xmath2 correspond to the coherent and incoherent components of the ru 4@xmath3 state , respectively.@xcite the presence of the incoherent component near @xmath25 ev is supported by a recent dft+dmft calculation for srruo@xmath2,@xcite indicating that it is originating from the electron correlation effect . in this context , the observed spectral change suggests that a spectral weight transfer of the ru 4@xmath3 electrons from the coherent to incoherent components occurs upon doping la .",
    "we also display the @xmath4 variation of the spectral area from 0.5 to -2.5 ev , which roughly corresponds to the total number of ru 4@xmath3 electrons contributing to the peak just below @xmath11 , in the inset of fig .",
    "1 . within the experimental accuracy ,",
    "the spectral area from 0.5 to -2.5 ev seems unchanged , suggesting an absence of a large change in the valence state of ru with la doping .",
    "however , we can not discuss the detailed behavior of the valence state evolution of ru by la doping due to the presence of the data scatter of about 10% .    since the doped la atoms may provide additional la 5@xmath3 electrons to the valence bands",
    ", one may consider that the change of the peak near @xmath11 is caused not by the spectral weight transfer of the ru 4@xmath3 state from the coherent to incoherent components but by the development of the la 5@xmath3 component . to check this possibility",
    ", we performed la 3@xmath3-edge resonance pes experiments to identify the la 5@xmath3 contributions in the valence band spectra.@xcite in the la 3@xmath3-edge resonance pes , the following two processes occur simultaneously : @xmath26 these are known as the ( 1 ) direct and ( 2 ) auger processes . because these two processes have the same initial and final states , the la 5@xmath3 spectral weight is expected to be resonantly enhanced when the photon energy corresponds to the la 3@xmath3-edge .",
    "the inset of fig .",
    "2 shows the la 3@xmath5 xas spectrum for @xmath4 = 0.3 .",
    "a peak is clearly seen at a photon energy of @xmath21 = 834.6 ev .",
    "the incident photon energy was chosen to this peak energy for the on - resonance measurements and @xmath21 = 830 ev for the off - resonance measurements .",
    "the on- and off - resonance spectra measured at 25 k for each sample are displayed in fig .",
    "it is clear that the intensity of the peak at around @xmath27 ev is markedly enhanced in the on - resonance spectra .",
    "we normalized these on- and off - resonance spectra by the intensity around @xmath11 and found that the on- and off - resonance spectra overlap almost perfectly around @xmath11 .",
    "this reflects an absence of the la 5@xmath3 component in this energy range , where the ru 4@xmath3 component is dominant . here",
    ", we note that this normalization method is almost equivalent to that by the incident photon intensity since the difference in the pes cross - section of ru 4@xmath3 between the on- and off - resonance spectra is only about 1%.@xcite because the la 5@xmath3 contribution is limited to the energy range between @xmath23 and @xmath28 ev for all the samples presently investigated , it is considered that the la 5@xmath3 states mainly hybridize with the o 2@xmath10 states and do not influence the change of the spectra near @xmath11 .",
    "it should be also noted here that the presence of la 5@xmath3 component contradicts with the simple ionic picture , since the la atom is generally considered to be trivalent in this picture , and thus , the la 5@xmath3 state should be empty.@xcite the presence of la 5@xmath3 state is consistent with our recent magnetic susceptibility measurements , which showed that the @xmath4 variation of the effective moment can not be explained in terms of the simple ionic picture.@xcite since sr@xmath29 is substituted by la@xmath30 , the same fraction of ru@xmath31 is expected to be substituted by ru@xmath30 through electron transfer in the simple ionic picture .",
    "the ru@xmath31 and ru@xmath30 ions have effective moments of 2.83 and 1.73@xmath7 , respectively,@xcite and therefore , the effective moment is expected to decrease monotonously with increasing @xmath4 in the simple ionic picture .",
    "however , the experimentally obtained effective moment estimated from the curie constant does not shows a monotonous decrease with @xmath4 .",
    "both the present la 3@xmath3-edge resonance pes and our recent magnetic susceptibility measurements imply that the ru 4@xmath3 state in sr@xmath0la@xmath1ruo@xmath2 can not be understood in terms of the simple ionic configurations of ru@xmath31 and ru@xmath30 possibly because of its delocalized nature .",
    "since the pes experiments were carried out in the soft x - ray range , the pes spectra mainly reflect the bulk electronic states .",
    "however , the influence from the surface region of sr@xmath0la@xmath1ruo@xmath2 may not be negligible .",
    "in fact , the electronic state in the surface region of srruo@xmath2 seems to be markedly different from that of the bulk state , since the pes spectra obtained for polycrystal samples with scraped or fractured surfaces largely depend on the photon energy , namely , on the probing depth.@xcite here , we subtract the surface components from the pes spectra according to a procedure described in ref . 14 to investigate the intrinsic bulk electronic properties .",
    "the pes spectra can be decomposed into surface and bulk components using the following equation : @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 represent the intensities of the surface and bulk components , respectively .",
    "@xmath3 is the thickness of the surface layer , and @xmath35 is the photoelectron mean free path . since @xmath35 depends on the photon energy , we can estimate the surface and bulk components from two spectra measured at different photon energies . in this analysis ,",
    "the o 2@xmath10 spectral weights at higher binding energies are fitted by multiple gaussians as shown in fig . 1 , and",
    "then we subtract them from the pes spectra to focus on the behavior of the ru 4@xmath3 derived peak .",
    "the ru 4@xmath3 derived peaks in the pes spectra measured with @xmath21 = 500 and 1100 ev at 25 k are shown in figs .",
    "3(a ) and 3(b ) , and these spectra are normalized by the area of each spectrum .",
    "the spectra measured at @xmath21 = 500 ev are broadened using a gaussian to decrease the energy resolution to that of @xmath21 = 1100 ev so that we can compare the spectra .",
    "we estimated @xmath35 to be approximately 10 and 19 @xmath36 for @xmath21 = 500 and 1100 ev , respectively , using semiempirical expressions given in ref .",
    "the parameter @xmath3 is assumed to be same order in magnitude with lattice constants,@xcite and we estimated the surface and bulk components by tentatively using @xmath3 values of 6 and 12 @xmath36 [ figs .",
    "3(c)-3(f ) ] . figures 3(c ) and 3(e ) clearly show that the spectral shape of the bulk component does not exhibit any noticeable change with the doubling of @xmath3 , suggesting that the bulk spectra estimated in this procedure are robust against estimation errors in @xmath3 .",
    "therefore , the estimated bulk spectra would reflect the intrinsic bulk electronic states , even though the accurate value of @xmath3 is unknown .",
    "although the incoherent component ( @xmath141.2 ev ) is stronger in the surface spectra , one can see the spectral weight transfer from the coherent to incoherent component upon la doping in the bulk spectra .",
    "the strong enhancement of the incoherent component in the surface spectra can naturally be understood by considering the fact that the surface ru 4@xmath3 state is expected to be less hybridized than the bulk ru 4@xmath3 state .",
    "this is because the surface atoms have fewer nearest neighbors .",
    "hence , this enhancement further supports that the incoherent component at @xmath141.2 ev originates from the electron correlation effect .",
    "we measured the temperature dependence of the pes spectra to study how magnetic ordering affects the valence electronic state of sr@xmath0la@xmath1ruo@xmath2 .",
    "figure 4 shows the pes spectra for each sample measured at 25 and 200 k. these spectra are normalized by the area of each spectrum . the ferromagnetic ordering temperatures for @xmath4 = 0 ( @xmath6 = 160 k ) and 0.1 ( @xmath6 = 120 k ) are between 25 and 200 k and well separated from these temperatures .",
    "although the cluster - glass ordering temperatures for @xmath4 @xmath15 0.3 are lower than 25 k , the magnetic clusters already start developing at this temperature according to our recent @xmath17sr study.@xcite the pes spectra exhibit no discernible dependence on the temperate over the investigated @xmath4 range .",
    "the present study reveals that the substitution of la for sr generates a clear weight transfer of the ru 4@xmath3 state from the coherent to incoherent component .",
    "since the incoherent feature is reproduced by a recent dft+dmft calculation for srruo@xmath2 , which can take account of the man- body effect beyond the conventional dft calculations , @xcite the development of the incoherent component seems to be caused by the enhancement of electron correlation by la doping .",
    "the enhancement of electron correlation is consistent with the emergence of cluster - glass states for @xmath4 @xmath15 0.3 because both are indicative of the localized character of the ru 4@xmath3 electrons . on the other hand ,",
    "it is important to note that the large pes intensity at @xmath11 remains up to @xmath4 = 0.5 despite the development of the incoherent component .",
    "this suggests that the ru 4@xmath3 state still involves itinerant characteristics and is consistent with the metallic character of sr@xmath0la@xmath1ruo@xmath2 revealed by resistivity and specific - heat measurements.@xcite    next , we argue the relationship between this variation in the pes spectra with la doping and the thermodynamic quantities .",
    "we previously demonstrated that low temperature magnetization is markedly suppressed with la doping.@xcite this indicates that exchange splitting at low temperatures is reduced with increasing @xmath4 .",
    "a dft calculation for srruo@xmath2 predicts that the reduction of the exchange splitting accompanies the enhancement of the density of states near @xmath11 and therefore makes the ru 4@xmath3 derived peak more pronounced.@xcite however , the present pes results show an opposite behavior with increasing @xmath4 .",
    "hence , it is considered that the effect of the reduction in exchange splitting on the pes spectra is overwhelmed by the suppression of the pes intensities near @xmath11 due to the renormalization factor @xmath37 = @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the self - energy originating from the electron correlation effect .",
    "we previously reported that the electronic specific - heat coefficient @xmath40 exhibits a monotonic increase with increasing @xmath4 up to @xmath4 = 0.3 , which is accompanied by a significant suppression in the magnetic ordering temperature and the ordered moment.@xcite the increase rate in @xmath40 with la doping becomes small for @xmath4 @xmath15 0.3 , where the low - temperature ordered moment is well suppressed .",
    "combined with the features of the pes spectra , we consider that the enhancement in @xmath40 up to @xmath4 = 0.3 is caused by a combination of the suppression of exchange splitting and the development of the electron correlation effect .",
    "in contrast , the weak increase in @xmath40 for @xmath4 @xmath15 0.3 likely originates solely from the latter effect .    here",
    ", we discuss the origin of the enhancement of electron correlation and the suppression of the ferromagnetic order with la doping . according to ref .",
    "28 , the la doping increases the lattice constants and also enhances the gdfeo@xmath2 type distortion by tilting the ruo@xmath41 octahedra .",
    "the former change in the crystal structure would enhance the density of states at @xmath11 by weakening the hybridization effect .",
    "in contrast , the latter change may diminish the density of states at @xmath11 by lifting the degeneracy of the ru 4@xmath3 derived bands near @xmath11 , which have @xmath42 symmetry.@xcite at first glance , the enhancement of electron correlation with la doping revealed by this study seems to suggest that the evolution of the electronic state caused by the former change is dominant in sr@xmath0la@xmath1ruo@xmath2 .",
    "however , in this explanation , the origin of the suppression of ferromagnetic would be puzzling .",
    "this is because the presence of the ferromagnetic order is determined by the value of the product of the density of states at @xmath11 and an interaction constant in the stoner theory.@xcite therefore , in this sense , the suppression of the ferromagnetic order can be considered as an indication of the suppression of the density of states at @xmath11 and the broadening of the ru 4@xmath3 bands near @xmath11 .",
    "this is clearly inconsistent with the above explanation for the origin of the enhancement of electron correlation .",
    "further experimental and theoretical investigations are clearly needed to understand this puzzling coexistence of the suppression of the ferromagnetic order and the enhancement of electron correlation with la doping .",
    "it is remarkable that the pes spectra exhibit no significant temperature variations in contrast to their clear @xmath4 dependence .",
    "x - ray magnetic circular dichroism spectroscopy studies have revealed that orbital moments are almost quenched in the ferromagnetic state of srruo@xmath2.@xcite therefore , the ferromagnetic order originates from spin moments , and a considerable amount of exchange splitting between the majority and minority spin bands is indispensable to reproduce the ordered moment of approximately 1@xmath7.@xcite in fact , the energy scale of the exchange splitting for @xmath4 = 0 is estimated to be approximately 0.5 ev by dft calculations.@xcite this value is much larger than the energy resolution of present pes study ( 120 mev at @xmath21 = 700 ev ) .",
    "therefore , the temperature dependence of the pes spectra should be measurable , if the conventional stoner theory is applicable to the ferromagnetic order in this compound .",
    "this is because pes spectra are the simple sum of the majority and minority spin components , and the exchange splitting between these components should decrease with increasing temperature and disappear above @xmath6 in the stoner theory . actually , stoner - like temperature dependence has been reported in pes experiments for ferromagnetic gd metal,@xcite although subsequent detailed spin - resolved pes experiments revealed that the temperature dependence is much more complex than the prediction of the stoner theory.@xcite our pes data are consistent with recent angle - resolved pes and optical spectroscopy studies for @xmath4 = 0,@xcite which indicate that exchange splitting does not disappear at @xmath6 and remains finite well above @xmath6 . in these studies",
    ", it has been proposed that such a residual exchange splitting above @xmath6 can be explained based on fluctuating local band theory.@xcite in this theory , the band structure in a local region still has exchange splitting above @xmath6 ; however , the long - range magnetic order is destroyed by spatial and temporal fluctuations .",
    "the recent dft+dmft calculation also reproduced residual exchange splitting above @xmath6.@xcite    note that the pes spectra of sr@xmath0la@xmath1ruo@xmath2 do not show a discernible temperature dependence for the entire investigated @xmath4 range , whereas the ferromagnetic transition temperature varies widely with @xmath4 . @xmath6 and the ordered moment in the ferromagnetic state for @xmath4 = 0.1 are approximately 120 k and 0.75@xmath7 , respectively , which are approximately 75% of those for srruo@xmath2.@xcite",
    "the present pes investigations imply that the exchange splitting for @xmath4 = 0.1 also remains nearly unchanged up to 200 k , which is well above @xmath6 . in this context",
    ", it is natural to speculate that exchange splitting for @xmath4 @xmath15 0.3 also remains finite above the cluster - glass ordering temperatures , and it is closely related to the origin of the development of magnetic clusters well above the cluster - glass ordering temperatures observed in the @xmath17sr study.@xcite even though the absence of temperate dependence in the pes spectra for @xmath4 @xmath15 0.3 seem to be consistent with this speculation , this is not conclusive because the low - temperature magnetization for @xmath4 @xmath15 0.3 is significantly smaller than that for srruo@xmath2 , and it may yield too small exchanging splitting to be detected in the present pes experiment.@xcite",
    "the electronic states of sr@xmath0la@xmath1ruo@xmath2 were studied by pes experiments using soft x - rays .",
    "the ru 4@xmath3 derived peak near @xmath11 is significantly influenced by the substitution of la for sr ; doping la into srruo@xmath2 reduces the pes intensity just below @xmath11 , accompanying the evolution of an incoherent component near @xmath25 ev .",
    "the resonant pes experiments at the la 3@xmath5 edge confirmed that the change in the spectral shape of the ru 4@xmath3 derived peak does not originate from the additional contribution of the la 5@xmath3 electrons .",
    "we decomposed the pes spectra into the bulk and surface components using the dependence of the photoelectron mean - free path on the photon energy and found that the spectral weight transfer of the ru 4@xmath3 state from the coherent to incoherent components upon la doping occurs in the bulk component .",
    "the development of the incoherent component is considered to reflect the enhancement of the electron correlation effect with la doping .",
    "this is consistent with the emergence of cluster - glass states for @xmath4 @xmath15 0.3 , which indicates the localized nature of the ru 4@xmath3 electrons . on the other hand ,",
    "a large portion of the pes intensity at @xmath11 still remains even for @xmath4 = 0.5 , showing that the ru 4@xmath3 state still involves itinerant characteristics .",
    "the temperature dependence of the pes spectra is negligibly small and does not follow the prediction of the stoner theory .",
    "these results suggest that the electronic and magnetic properties of sr@xmath0la@xmath1ruo@xmath2 are influenced by the electron correlation effect and that the ru 4@xmath3 electrons have both local and itinerant natures .",

    "<S> to clarify how the electronic state of sr@xmath0la@xmath1ruo@xmath2 evolves with la doping , we conducted photoemission ( pes ) experiments using soft x - rays . the spectral shape of the ru 4@xmath3 derived peak near the fermi level changes significantly with increasing @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> this variation indicates that a spectral weight transfer from the coherent to incoherent component occurs due to an enhancement of the electron correlation effect . </S>",
    "<S> resonant pes experiments at the la 3@xmath5 edge have confirmed that there is no significant contribution of the la 5@xmath3 state in the energy range where the spectral weight transfer is observed . </S>",
    "<S> using the dependence of the photoelectron mean free path on the photon energy , we subtracted the surface components from the pes spectra and confirmed that the enhancement of the electron correlation effect with la doping is an intrinsic bulk phenomenon . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> a large portion of the coherent component remains at the fermi level up to @xmath4 = 0.5 , reflecting that the ru 4@xmath3 state still has itinerant characteristics . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we found that the pes spectra hardly depend on the temperature and do not exhibit a discernible change with magnetic ordering , suggesting that the temperature variation of the exchange splitting does not follow the prediction of the stoner theory . </S>",
    "<S> the presently obtained experimental results indicate that the electron correlation effect plays an important role in sr@xmath0la@xmath1ruo@xmath2 and that the ru 4@xmath3 electrons possess both local and itinerant characteristics . </S>"
