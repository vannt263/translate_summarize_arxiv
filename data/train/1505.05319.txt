    "conformal invariance ( ci ) imposes strong constraints on correlation functions leading to exact results mainly in two dimensions . on the other hand",
    "most renormalizable theories possessing conformal invariance at the classical level exhibit the trace anomaly once quantum corrections are taken into account .",
    "of course this is most welcome in particle physics because conformal symmetry breaking must come into play to properly describe the real world .",
    "then , in the high energy limit , ci may be recovered appearing as uv and/or ir limits @xcite .",
    "furthermore , ci is an important concept in holographic theories based on the @xmath1 duality which relates strongly - coupled four dimensional gauge theory to gravitational theory in five dimensional @xmath2 space - time , for instance .",
    "it is also important in super - symmetric gauge theories , e.g. ( conformal invariant ) @xmath3 super yang - mills . for applications of the @xmath4 conjecture @xcite in many branches of physics",
    "see @xcite .",
    "anomalies occur when a symmetry presented at a classical level is broken upon quantization . in perturbation theory , during the process of regularization / renormalization , counter - terms are generated and may violate the symmetry that was present at the classical level .",
    "the presence of anomaly depends on the fact that it is not possible to find a regulator that preserves all the symmetries of the classical action .",
    "well - known examples of anomalies are the ( avv ) chiral anomaly @xcite when gauge fields coupled to conserved currents give rise to non - conserved axial current , and the trace anomaly of a scalar field conformally coupled to a classical gravitational background @xcite .",
    "finite and undetermined local terms appear as differences between loop integrals with the same degree of divergence in feynman diagram calculations @xcite .",
    "such indeterminacies are regularization dependent and are at the heart of symmetry breakings by regularizations .",
    "a reasonable strategy would be to leave them arbitrary till the end of the calculation to be fixed on symmetry or physical grounds .",
    "anomalies , such as the avv chiral anomaly , appear in this approach when the ambiguities proved themselves insufficient to preserve the full set of symmetry identities valid at classical level .    attributing spurious values to such indeterminacies",
    "can break gauge invariance or super - symmetry @xcite . in the latter reference",
    "it was shown that undetermined local terms can be cast as surface terms at any loop order .",
    "moreover it was argued that momentum routing invariance ( mri ) is a necessary and sufficient condition to preserve ( abelian ) gauge symmetry at arbitrary loop order .",
    "this condition is automatically fulfilled by dimensional regularization @xcite .",
    "the strategy of identifying ambiguous regularization dependent surface terms in perturbation theory to arbitrary loop order is better understood and accomplished within implicit regularization ( ir ) @xcite , which is discussed in more detail in section [ 2 ] .",
    "ir is a momentum space setting to perform feynman diagram calculations in a regularization independent fashion .",
    "consequently ir turns out particularly adequate to unravel anomalies within perturbation theory . in ir ,",
    "the lagrangian of the underlying quantum field theory is not modified because neither an explicit regulator is introduced nor the dimensionality of the space time needs to be moved away from its physical dimension .",
    "in particular , ir allows for a democratic display of the anomaly between the ward identities which ultimately should be fixed on physical grounds .",
    "for example , in @xcite was studied weyl fermions on a classical gravitational background in two dimensions and shown that , assuming lorentz symmetry , the weyl and einstein ward identities reduce to a set of algebraic equations for the arbitrary parameters which place the ward identities on equal footing , just as in the avv triangle anomaly @xcite .    in this contribution",
    "we revisit an old controversy related to breaking of the conformal current at one - loop order when matter fields lie on a gravitational background .",
    "some of the terms of this anomaly are ambiguous and regularization dependent @xcite .",
    "therefore , we investigate if this ambiguity appears as surface terms which sometimes may be fixed on symmetry grounds .",
    "moreover , we believe that performing this calculation in four dimensions and without introducing an explicit regulator is worthwhile since we will not get spurious terms that may contaminate the anomaly .    this work is organized as follows : in section [ first ] we review some aspects about conformal anomaly ; in section [ 2 ] we outline the implicit regularization scheme to establish our notation ; in section [ 3 ] we derive the @xmath5 coefficient using the one - loop correction to the graviton propagator ; in section [ 4 ] we perform the one - loop renormalization of the quantum effective action ; we present how the anomaly is affected by the surface terms in section [ s6 ] and we draw concluding remarks in section [ 5 ] .",
    "in order to present the state of the art let us establish some notation .",
    "a theory is conformal invariant if it does not change under the field transformation @xmath6 where @xmath7 stands for scalar , vector , spinor or the metric ( @xmath8 or @xmath9 , respectively ) , @xmath10 is an arbitrary scalar field and @xmath11 is the corresponding conformal weight for the scalar , vector or spinor fields(@xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively ) and it is equal 2 for the metric .",
    "the corresponding conserved current associated with the transformation ( [ 1.1 ] ) is the conformal current also known as the trace of the energy - momentum tensor . in classical field theory , this current is conserved in the massless limit .",
    "quantum corrections usually break conformal invariance in the semi - classical approach of gravity ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "pioneering works about this anomaly have derived one - loop corrections to the graviton propagator due to vector @xcite and spinor @xcite couplings .",
    "they found out that , although diffeomorphism was preserved , the trace of the energy - momentum tensor was no longer zero at the quantum level @xcite since it received finite corrections . like other anomalies",
    "this breaking poses a renormalizability issue @xcite .    at first",
    ", this symmetry breaking was thought as being spurious @xcite -@xcite , that is to say an artifact of the regularization method , motivating the seek for a regularization scheme which preserves both ci and diffeomorphism @xcite-@xcite .",
    "afterwards , the trace of energy - momentum tensor was computed in several frameworks . in @xcite",
    "it was calculated diagrammatically using dimensional regularization @xcite .",
    "moreover , it was shown that the anomaly also arises in @xmath14-function regularization @xcite , point - splitting regularization @xcite and in the context of schwinger - dewitt method @xcite . a derivation based on the ads@xmath15cft correspondence",
    "can be found in @xcite .",
    "besides , this anomaly has already been classified in a regularization independent way using the algebraic approach@xcite .",
    "however , the explicit diagrammatic computation reveals that some of the terms which quantum mechanically break conformal invariance are regularization dependent . for a review about conformal anomaly and",
    "its universalities and ambiguities in different regularization schemes see @xcite .",
    "it is noteworthy that the anomalous trace of the energy - momentum tensor has physical consequences : it determines the energy - momentum tensor for a black hole in two dimensions @xcite and the classification of the vacuum quantum states in four dimensions @xcite .",
    "this anomaly also gives rise to the stability condition in the modified starobinsky inflationary model @xcite .",
    "besides , the anomaly induced action has applications in black hole evaporation @xcite , annihilation of an ads universe @xcite and creation of a de sitter wall universe @xcite .",
    "the trace anomaly has a general form given by @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the square of the weyl tensor , @xmath18 is the gauss - bonnet topological invariant , @xmath19 is the ricci scalar and @xmath20 and @xmath5 are related with @xmath21-functions @xcite @xmath22    the usual results in the literature are @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "however , there is a disagreement in the coefficient @xmath5 . while some regularization schemes predict @xmath25 , dimensional regularization yields @xmath26@xcite .",
    "furthermore , @xmath5 vanishes in the derivation based on the ads@xmath15 cft @xcite correspondence and it is ambiguous in pauli - villars regularization @xcite .",
    "afterwards , it was shown that dimensional regularization actually also furnishes an ambiguous result @xcite .",
    "we shall compute the trace anomaly in an implicit momentum space regularization framework , paying particular attention to regularization dependent quantities @xcite .",
    "we perform the one - loop correction to the graviton propagator due to couplings with scalar , fermion and vector fields .",
    "we then relate that correction for the two - point function with @xmath27 . for this purpose",
    "we employ implicit regularization @xcite in which divergences are expressed order by order in perturbation theory as loop integrals in consonance with bphz theorem @xcite whereas undetermined regularization dependent local terms are expressed by surface terms .",
    "thus we derive the @xmath5 coefficient and then compare our result with those of the literature .",
    "we apply the implicit regularization framework @xcite to treat the integrals which appear in the amplitudes of section [ 3 ] .",
    "let us make a brief review of the method . in this scheme",
    ", we assume the existence of an implicit regulator @xmath28 just to justify algebraic operations within the integrands .",
    "we then use the following identity to separate uv divergent basic integrals from the finite part :    @xmath29 } , \\label{2.1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath30 , to separate basic divergent integrals ( bdi s ) from the finite part .",
    "these bdi s are defined as follows @xmath31 @xmath32 and @xmath33    the basic divergences with lorentz indices can be combined as differences between integrals with the same superficial degree of divergence , according to the equations below , which define surface terms : + sum over permutations between the two sets of indices @xmath34 and @xmath35 @xmath36    in the expressions above , @xmath37 is the degree of divergence of the integrals and for the sake of brevity , we substitute the subscripts @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 by @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 , respectively .",
    "surface terms can be conveniently written as integrals of total derivatives , namely @xmath44 @xmath45 @xmath46 and @xmath47    we see that equations ( [ dif1])-([dif4 ] ) are undetermined because they are differences between divergent quantities .",
    "each regularization scheme gives a different value for these terms .",
    "however , as physics should not depend on the schemes applied , we leave these terms to be arbitrary until the end of the calculation , fixing them by symmetry constraints or phenomenology , when it applies @xcite .    it is noteworthy that this prescription is not the usual one since we do not evaluate divergent integrals or regularization dependent quantities neither do we introduce a regulator or further parameters usually introduced in explicit regularization procedures .",
    "we do assume the existence of a regulator in order to give sense to the manipulation ( [ 2.1 ] ) .",
    "however , we do not say which one .",
    "that is because the introduction of an explicit regulator and additional parameters usually breaks symmetries of the theory and it makes the renormalization procedure more laborious .    besides of not modifying the theory , such as changing the dimension of space - time or breaking gauge or lorentz symmetry spuriously",
    ", we can support or differ controversial results of the literature , which are most of the times caused by regularization dependent quantities like surface terms in ( [ dif1])-([dif4 ] ) .",
    "if those terms remain in the finite part of the amplitude , it can be arbitrary and regularization dependent although of being finite .",
    "therefore , we carry those terms till the end of the calculation and fix them using a symmetry requirement , the fulfillment of a ward identity , for instance",
    ".    we should also emphasize that although ir was consistently built for multi - loop calculation in scalar field theories @xcite , its validity is questionable for arbitrary loop order in other theories and in curved space . if one works in a momentum space framework",
    ", one must ensure that causality and locality are guaranteed in all orders of perturbation theory . in differential",
    "regularization @xcite , for instance , it was shown that those principles hold at lower - order even in curved space @xcite",
    ". however , we do not worry with that in the present case since we perform only one - loop calculations .",
    "we consider the semi - classical approach of gravitation where matter fields are quantized in a classical curved background ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the action for scalar , fermion and abelian vector are , respectively @xmath48 and @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the tetrad , @xmath51 and @xmath52 is the non - minimal coupling .    in equation ( [ 3.2 ] ) , in order to couple fermions with the gravitational field , we need to define the covariant derivative , @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the spin connection , which depends on the tetrad , and @xmath55 $ ] , with @xmath56 representing the dirac matrices .",
    "the actions expressed by ( [ 3.2 ] ) and ( [ 3.3 ] ) are classically conformal invariant and so is the action ( [ 3.1 ] ) in the conformal limit @xmath57 . to compute the classical breaking we have first to calculate one - loop corrections to the graviton propagator . in order to do this",

    "loop diagrams @xmath67,@xmath68 and @xmath69 contribute only with quartic and quadratic divergences .",
    "quadratic divergences for massless fields are made zero in dimensional regularization @xcite and in implicit regularization @xcite .",
    "quartic divergences are unphysical in the sense that they do not contribute for physical quantities , like logarithmic divergences do when deriving the running of coupling constants , for instance .",
    "both divergences also come from diagrams @xmath64,@xmath65 and @xmath66 . using symmetric integration , like @xmath70",
    ", all quartic divergences can be transformed in a single form @xmath71 which can be subtracted by a suitable cosmological counter - term ( see @xcite for details ) .",

    "<S> standard perturbative calculations of conformal symmetry breaking expressed by the non - zero trace of the energy - momentum tensor have shown that some violating terms are regularization dependent , which may suggest the existence of spurious breaking terms in the anomaly . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we perform the calculation in a momentum space regularization framework in which regularization dependent terms are judiciously parametrized . we compare our results with those obtained in the literature and conclude that there is an unavoidable arbitrariness in the anomalous term @xmath0 . </S>"
