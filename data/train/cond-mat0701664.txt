    "<S> the dynamics of polymer translocation through a pore has recently received a lot of attention and appears highly relevant in both chemical and biological processes@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the theoretical cosideration is usually based on the assumption @xcite that the problem can be mapped onto a one dimensional diffusion process . </S>",
    "<S> the so called _ translocation coordinate _ </S>",
    "<S> ( i.e. , reaction coordinate @xmath0 ) is considered as the only relevant dynamic variable . </S>",
    "<S> the whole polymer chain of length @xmath9 is assumed as being in equilibrium with a corresponding free energy @xmath10 of an entropic nature . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath11-dynamics of the translocation coordinate follows then the conventional brownian motion and the one dimensional smoluchowsky equation @xcite can be used with the free energy @xmath10 playing the role of an external potential . in the absence of external driving force ( unbiased translocation ) </S>",
    "<S> , the corresponding average first - passage time follows the law @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the length of a polymer kuhn segment and @xmath14 stands for the proper diffusion coefficient . </S>",
    "<S> the question about the choice of the proper diffusion coefficient , @xmath14 , and the nature of the diffusion process , is controversial . </S>",
    "<S> some authors @xcite adopt @xmath15 , as for rouse diffusion , which yields @xmath16 as for polymer reptation@xcite albeit the short pore constraint is less severe than that of a tube of length @xmath9 . in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite it is assumed that @xmath14 is not the diffusion coefficient of the whole chain but rather that of the monomer just passing through the pore . </S>",
    "<S> the unbiased translocation time is then predicted to go as @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> the latter assumption has been questioned @xcite too . indeed , on the one hand , the mean translocation time scales@xcite as @xmath18 but on the other hand the characteristic rouse time ( i.e. the time it takes for a _ free _ polymer to diffuse a distance of the order of its gyration radius ) scales as @xmath19 where the flory exponent @xmath20 at @xmath21 , and @xmath22 at @xmath23 @xcite . thus @xmath24 against common sense </S>",

    "<S> moreover , the equilibration of the chain is questionable when the expression for @xmath10 is to be used . </S>",
    "<S> the characteristic equilibration time scales again as @xmath25 and is thus always larger than the translocation time , i.e. @xmath26 . again the internal consistency of the whole approach is in doubt . </S>",
    "<S> it was found by mc - simulation @xcite that @xmath27 for translocations in @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that the translocation time scales in the same manner as the rouse time albeit with a larger prefactor that depends on the size of the nanopore . </S>",
    "<S> the authors argued that this finding bears witness of the failure of the brownian nature of the translocation dynamics and suggested instead that _ anomalous diffusion dynamics _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite should be more adequate . </S>",

    "<S> the time variation of the second statistical moment , @xmath31 , clearly indicates an anomalous nature @xcite since the measured exponent @xmath32 while @xmath33 . still missing is a proper theoretical analysis which could explain the physical origin of the anomalous dynamics , and make it possible to solve the appropriate _ fractional diffusion equation _ ( or , in case of a biased translocation , the fractional fokker - planck - smoluchowski equation ) @xcite governing this dynamics .    </S>",
