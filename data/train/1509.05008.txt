    "`` _ follow me _ '' ( fm ) is probably the most natural strategy to solve the guidance problem , that is , to guide something or somebody along a given trajectory or towards a specific target , whether physically along geographical paths ( streets , roads , buildings ) , conceptually ( language learning , politics ) or even spiritually ( religion , social networks ) . the success of the fm strategy is based on the effect of the attraction that the guide ( the leader , the driver ) exerts on the guided ( followers , driven ) .",
    "also successfull is the `` _ do as i do _ '' strategy , based on imitation ( of behavior ) or alignment ( of opinion ) , and used in the above mentioned fields , among others ( social learning ) .",
    "less expected is the effectiveness of the opposite strategy , namely , `` _ move away from me _ ''",
    "( ma ) , based on repulsive interactions .",
    "that repulsion can serve to guide something or somebody is shown by nature itself , not only by means of gradient fields ( electromagnetic , temperature or chemical fields ) , where attraction towards high densities can be viewed as repulsion from low densities , but also by specifically repelling targets or agents . in neural development , axonogenesis takes place by combining attractive and repulsive guidance , so that the axon growth follows guidance cues presented by chemoattractant and chemorepellent molecules located in the environment of the cell  @xcite . in animal herding ,",
    "sheepdogs are used to guide sheep flocks through a repulsive force that dogs exert on sheep  @xcite .",
    "guidance cues can also be magnetic , as in drug targeting  @xcite , thermotactic , as in sperm guidance  @xcite , cognitive , as in crowd motion and traffic flow  @xcite or in opinion formation  @xcite , acoustic signals , as in animal alarm calls or instrumental conditioning  @xcite , food trail pheromones in ants  @xcite ( chemical at a scale larger than the cell ) , etc .",
    "attractive and alignment guidance problems are being studied for a long time by means of agent based models  @xcite , with attention to guidance by leadership  @xcite , and optimal strategies to minimize time guidance ( optimal evacuation times ) or distance travelled by the agents have been found for several systems  @xcite .    very recently , in 2015 ,",
    "the optimal strategy for a flocking model to reach a target point or to follow a given trajectory through attractive and alignment guidance has been presented  @xcite . in this model ,",
    "individuals from the flock interact through attractive - repulsive and alignment forces with the rest of individuals .",
    "interactions are symmetric , except for one specific individual the leader which exerts on each other individual an extra attractive force .",
    "the result is that the leader is followed by the flock , so that , by controlling the behavior of the leader , a fm strategy can be used to make the flock reach a given target or move along a given trajectory .",
    "repulsive forces in attractive - repulsive models have mostly been considered for collision avoidance with obstacles or with other agents .",
    "guidance by repulsion has received much less attention , which is reduced , to our knowledge , to the above mentioned axonogenesis and animal herding . also very recently , in 2015 , an agent based model has been introduced to describe a so - called defender - intruder interaction , where repulsion is used by a defender to expel an intruder away as far as possible from a protected target  @xcite .",
    "the authors in  @xcite find an optimal ma strategy , which not always consists in approaching the intruder as close as possible , but to simply drive the intruder away beyond a short distance of security .",
    "repulsion in the intruder - defender interaction is qualitatively different than in collision avoidance or in interception  @xcite , where the attractive and/or alignment forces determine ( most of ) the behavior .",
    "defender - intruder problems fall into the category of `` conflicting interactions ''  @xcite , which are well described by the classical pursuit - evasion ( pe ) framework  @xcite .",
    "the simplest scenario for a pe interaction consists of a single pursuer that follows and tries to capture a single evader that tries to escape to infinite from the pursuer  @xcite .",
    "although our interest does not focus on conflicting interactions , we adopt here the pe framework .",
    "the guidance by repulsion can indeed be described with the simple two - agents pe framework , provided two considerations are taken into account : first , the guide is not exactly a pursuer , as it often separates from the direction towards the evader and the guide can not be arbitrarily close to the evader , and second , the agent to be guided is not exactly an evader , as it does nt try necessarily to escape to infinite but simply moves away a short distance from the repelling guide .",
    "we present here a guidance by repulsion model based on the two - agents pe framework .",
    "we will refer to the guiding agent as _ the driver _ , which tries to drive the _",
    "evader_. the driver thus follows the evader but can not be arbitrarily close to it .",
    "this is especially interesting if the driver can not approach the evader or contact between agents should be avoided ( because of chemical reactions , animal conflict , etc ) .",
    "the evader moves away from the driver but does nt try to escape beyond a not so large distance .",
    "the driver is of course faster than the evader . at a critical short distance",
    ", the driver can display a circumvention maneuver around the evader that forces the evader to change the direction of its motion .",
    "thus , by adjusting the onset and offset of the circumvention maneuver , the evader can be driven towards a desired target or along a given trajectory .",
    "our goal is to find optimal strategies to drive the evader in the most efficient way .",
    "we use an inertial model where interactions between agents take place through asymmetric newtonian forces .",
    "the asymmetry consists in that one agent is attracted and repulsed , while the other is simply repulsed .",
    "this kind of interaction has been coined `` anti - newtonian '' by sprott  @xcite and others  @xcite .",
    "thus , velocities are not constant ( they depend on the state of the system ) , and no alignment forces are considered .    we denote by @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( and indexes @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) the driver and the evader agents respectively .",
    "both agents obeys the newton s second law , that is , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , where @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 denote the position vector , the velocity vector and the mass of agent  @xmath10 , and the resultant force to which agent  @xmath10 is subject , respectively , for @xmath11 .",
    "the force acting on the evader @xmath12 has only one component , which is in the direction of escape from the pursuer , @xmath13 . the force acting on the pursuer @xmath14 has a component collinear to @xmath12 and a lateral perpendicular component @xmath15 which allows the pursuer to surround the evader , therefore forcing the evader to change the direction of escape . here",
    "@xmath16 .",
    "the perpendicular component of the force acting on the pursuer @xmath14 can be switched on and off by means of the control parameter @xmath17 which takes values on @xmath18 .",
    "the control parameter @xmath17 is the key ingredient of the model , as it determines the behavior of the pursuer , which in turn determines the behavior of the evader .",
    "the resulting dynamical system can be considered as a driver - evader system with two operating modes controlled by a single parameter .",

    ", we introduce the model equations and parameters , describing in detail the interactions between agents and with the environment .",
    "we show that the driver - evader system can be viewed as having two operating modes controlled by a single parameter , so that the system can be moved from one state to another in order to make the driver to guide the evader from any point to any other point .",
    "we study the controllability of the system , and prove that , although the system is not fully controllable , agents positions remain asymptotically close to each other ( _ i.e. _ , an agent can not go to infinity ) .    in sec .  3",
    ", we consider what are the optimal strategies which allow the driver to guide the evader to a desired target .",
    "activating a system has a cost , as well as keeping it in the active mode . as an illustrating example",
    ", the driver can be viewed as a spacecraft with two lateral propellers whose ignition process and fuel consumption are very high with respect to the consumption of the back propeller .",
    "our interest is in reducing the cost by minimizing 1 ) the number of activation and 2 ) the time of use of the lateral propellers .    to do that",
    ", we formulate an optimal control problem @xmath19 for a cost functional including these two costs .",
    "whe then find , in sec .",
    "3.1 , the ( unique ) optimal strategy allowing the reach the target in an initially active system ( @xmath20 , and the ( unique ) optimal strategy which reduces the length of the time interval @xmath21 $ ] during which the control parameter has a non - zero value .",
    "this second strategy also reduces the number of manipulations of the control to two ( one _ switch on _ and one _ switch off _ ) . in this minimization process ,",
    "the cost of back propellers ( which are always switched on , the driver is a self - propelled agent which is always attracted by the evader ) is neglected compared to the cost of using the lateral propellers , so that there is not ( too much ) concern by long trajectories or long execution times where lateral propellers are switched off .",
    "these open - loop controls are subject to the reproducibility of the initial and environmental conditions and to uncertainty about the model  @xcite .",
    "in fact , we show here in detail that the system is highly sensitive to small variations of the values of the control , thus suggesting the appropriateness of the use of closed - loop controls that can afford for the random perturbations arising in real systems .",
    "we then present in sec .",
    "3.2 a feedback control law allowing to drive the evader to any desired target with an arbitrary accuracy .",
    "this feedback law is especially advantageous as it yields a similar cost than the open - loop controls , in real conditions ( _ i.e. _ , under perturbations ) .",
    "moreover , the feedback control law provides an excellent insight for the search of a control function yielding a substantially lower cost ; as an example , we report numerical simulations of a case in which the resulting cost is reduced almost a 60% of the cost provided by the open - loop controls .    finally , in sec .  4",

    "the circumvention force is thus a force that attracts the driver towards one of the two sides of the evader , where the side is determined by the sign of the parameter @xmath17 .",
    "the model considers two other critical distances , @xmath33 , which is the ( short ) distance at which the intensity of the circumvention force is effective , and @xmath34 , which denotes the distance between agents left by the driver during the circumvention maneuver . in",

    "finally , both agents are subject to friction forces with the ground , which have the same form , in the opposite direction of the motion : @xmath36 , for @xmath11 .",
    "the model can be formulated in different ways . the formulation presented in  ( [ eq - up])([condinis ] )",

    "another advantage of this formulation is that each ingredient of the model , especially the circumvention behavior , appears explicitly in the equations , thus facilitating the realistic interpretation of the contribution of each component of the model .",
    "for example , the exponent  @xmath38 of @xmath39 in the circumvention force ( which is large compared to the exponent  @xmath40 in the attracting force ) shows that the circumvention maneuver will only be effective when both agents are sufficiently close to each other .    with this formulation ,",

    "moreover , @xmath198 is an instantaneous measure of how urgently the control must be set to on .",
    "let us consider a maximal tolerance of deviation @xmath199 .",
    "the feedback control law is based on the idea that when @xmath198 is smaller than @xmath199 , it is possible to consider that @xmath104 is practically on the line @xmath65 , so that @xmath17 can be set to off , thus saving cost , and when @xmath200 , the deviation is excessive and the control must be set to on .",
    "the tolerance of deviation @xmath199 is an effective bound for both the angle and the intensities of the velocities ( @xmath201 ) , so  @xmath202 restricts also the velocities of the agents : a slightly deviated evader at a high speed can miss the target as well as a largely deviated evader at a lower speed .",
    "note also that when @xmath203 , the control can be switched off provided the evader and the target are at the same side with respect to the driver , in order to prevent the driver from driving the evader away from the target ; that is , @xmath17 can be set to zero only if the scalar product @xmath204 is negative .",
