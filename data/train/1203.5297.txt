    "a commonly accepted inflationary paradigm states that the large - scale structure ( lss ) of the universe is formed through evolution of density perturbations driven by gravitational instability . at some moment the growth of small - scale perturbations switches to non - linear regime .",
    "the treatment of linear regime is quite simple , the linear power spectrum ( transfer function ) for @xmath3 h / mpc can be readily computed with percent accuracy for any feasible cosmology . however , it is not so for the smaller scales , due to the non - linear terms in equations and complexity of physics of baryonic component ( hydrodynamics , radiation transfer , thermal and chemical evolution ) . this paper is aimed for the development of technique capable to build a bridge between the initial ( linear ) matter power spectrum and observable ( inherently non - linear ) galaxy power spectrum .",

    "within the scenario commonly referred as `` standard '' ( see @xcite ) , the gravitational potential of collisionless dark matter inhomogeneities governs the baryonic matter until the baryonic matter power spectrum reaches the dark matter s one in amplitude .",
    "at some moment , a non - linear perturbation with amplitude exceeding some critical one detaches from background expansion , reaches a turnaround point and starts to collapse due to self - gravity .",
    "subsequently the violent relaxation takes place , which brings the system into the virial equilibrium , so the halo of dark matter is formed .",
    "then , the baryonic gas starts to cool down , followed by clumping into clouds and ignition of the luminous tracers within halos ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "thus , the spatial distribution of luminous matter should strongly correlate with one of halos .",
    "the correlation is confirmed by large simulations , which take into account the baryon physics and particle dynamics of dark matter @xcite , and by semi - analytic models of galaxy formation @xcite as well .",
    "the numerical techniques require the considerable computing power , whereas the purely analytical are found unreliable and inaccurate .",
    "thus , the `` hybrid '' approach seems to be optimal , combining the analytical model of galaxy formation @xcite with dark matter `` merger trees '' extracted from simulations .",

    "the presented semi - analytical treatment is our implementation of halo model and it is proven to be correct in describing and interpretation of the clustering of the matter at the non - linear stage of evolution , both in simulated and observed universe .",

    "meanwhile , when non - central position of most massive galaxies in halos is assumed , ( @xmath388 ) , the predictions agree with the observational data up to @xmath396 h / mpc .    the calculated non - linear galaxy power spectrum for @xmath2cdm cosmology with ( @xmath292 , @xmath53 , @xmath293 , @xmath294 , @xmath295 ) = ( 0.26 , 0.74",
