    "the standard model of @xmath5cdm enables to explain these observational results within observational error bound .",
    "however , this model suffers from the cosmological constant problem and thus , one needs to find another model .",
    "up to now , the @xmath0-gravity as a modified gravity model remains a promising model to explain the present accelerating universe  @xcite .",
    "@xmath0 gravities can be considered as einstein gravity ( massless graviton ) with an additional scalar .",
    "for example , it was shown that the metric-@xmath0 gravity is equivalent to the @xmath6 brans - dicke ( bd ) theory with the potential  @xcite .",
    "although the equivalence principle test in the solar system imposes a strong constraint on @xmath0 gravities , they may not be automatically ruled out if the chameleon mechanism is introduced to resolve it in the einstein frame .",
    "it was shown that the equivalence principle test allows @xmath0 gravity models that are indistinguishable from the @xmath5cdm model in the background universe evolution  @xcite .    in order to point out the difference between @xmath5cdm and @xmath0 gravity , it is necessary to introduce the equation of state parameter @xmath1 .",
    "working with the @xmath0-gravity action in the jordan frame  @xcite , one has to use the different energy density and pressure @xmath7 in compared to @xmath8 in the einstein - like frame  @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to the scalar - tensor ( brans - dicke ) theory in the jordan frame  @xcite . in the einstein - like frame",
    ", one needs only the native equation of state @xmath9 as in the scalar - tensor ( quintessence model ) theory , while one requires two equations of states : @xmath10 and the effective equation of state @xmath11  @xcite because of non - minimal coupling of scalar to the gravity .",
    "it is worth noting that there is an essential difference between einstein - like and einstein frames because the latter is recovered from the conformal transformation in jordan frame  @xcite . for the holographic dark energy model ,",
    "two of authors have clarified that although there is a phantom phase when using the native equation of state  @xcite , there is no phantom phase when using the effective equation of state  @xcite .",
    "recently , there were a few of important works which explain the oscillation around the future de sitter solution with @xmath12 using @xmath0-gravity  @xcite and its brans - dicke theory  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the authors in  @xcite have shown that the number of phantom divide crossings are infinite when using the ricci scalar perturbation , which is confirmed by analytical condition and numerical way .    in this work ,",
    "we focus on the issues of future oscillations around the phantom divide for @xmath0 gravity . in order to confirm the appearance of future oscillations around the phantom divide @xmath12 , we introduce two types of equation of states @xmath13 and @xmath11 arisen from the @xmath0-fluid .",
    "we clarify the difference between two different sets of energy density and pressure by observing the  negative and effective \" equations of state .",
    "finally , we point out that the singularity appears at @xmath4 because the stability condition of @xmath0 gravity violates when @xmath14 at the certain point @xmath4 .",
    "we start from the action of @xmath0 gravity with matter as @xmath15 where @xmath0 is a function of ricci scalar @xmath16 with @xmath17 and @xmath18 is the action for matter which is assumed to be minimally coupled to gravity . here the action @xmath19 is initially written in jordan frame and @xmath20 denotes matters . taking the variation of the action ( [ action ] ) with respect to metric @xmath21 , one obtains @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the einstein tensor and @xmath24 . assuming the flat friedmann - roberston - walker ( frw ) universe @xmath25 with @xmath26 is the scale factor , we obtain the two friedmann equations from ( [ variation ] ) : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the hubble parameter , the overdot denotes the derivative with respect to the cosmic time @xmath29 , and @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the energy density and pressure of all perfect fluid - type matter , respectively .",
    "on the other hand , the scalar curvature @xmath16 defined by @xmath32 plays an independent role in the cosmological evolution because we are working with @xmath0-fluid . for our purpose",
    ", we introduce the new variable @xmath33 , then ( [ hubble ] ) and ( [ curvature ] ) take the forms @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the current density of cold dark matter ( cdm ) and @xmath36 is the current density ratio of radiation and dark matter . regarding ( [ hubble1 ] ) as the evolution equation , we rewrite it as a compact form @xmath37 where @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 represent dark energy , dark matter and radiation , respectively . comparing ( [ hubble1 ] ) with ( [ hubble2 ] )",
    "leads to a definition of dark energy density arisen from the @xmath0-gravity  @xcite @xmath41 .",

    "in this section , we wish to explain the singularities encountered in the cosmological evolution of @xmath0-fluid  @xcite .",

    "the former is necessary to show that the gravity is attractive and and the graviton is not a ghost , whereas the latter needs to ensure that the scalaron of a massive curvature scalar does not have a tachyon .",

    "hence , if @xmath147 at a certain point of @xmath4 , it gives rise to an singularity at which some cosmological parameters blow up .",
    "this results from the violation of stability condition @xmath0 gravity : the second of ( [ stcon ] ) .    in order to show the presence of singularities explicitly",
    ", we use the graph of @xmath148 as a function of @xmath71 . from fig . 5 , we find that the singularity appears at @xmath101 and thus , the backward evolution is not allowed in einstein - like frame . in the jordan frame ,",
    "the power - law gravity shows the singularities at @xmath149 for @xmath86 ( see fig . 7 ) and",
    "@xmath150 for @xmath136 ( see fig . 8) , while from fig .",
    "10 , we find that the singularity appears at @xmath101 and thus , the backward evolution is not allowed in jordan frame .",
    "this completes the presence of singularities in the cosmological evolution of @xmath0-fluid .",
    "we have investigated the issues of future oscillations around the phantom divide for @xmath0 gravity by introducing two types of energy density and pressure arisen from the @xmath0-fluid .",
    "one has the conventional energy density @xmath38 and pressure @xmath151 even in the beginning of the jordan frame , whose continuity equation provides the native equation of state @xmath152 .",
    "hence , we call this frame as the einstein - like frame",
    ".    on the other hand , the other has the different forms of energy density @xmath153 and pressure @xmath154 which do not obviously satisfy the continuity equation .",
    "this needs to introduce the effective equation of state @xmath11 to describe the @xmath0-fluid precisely , in addition to the native equation of state @xmath155 .",
    "we confirm that future oscillations around the phantom divide always occur in @xmath0-gravities by introducing two types of @xmath0-gravity : one is the power - law potential ( [ p - law ] ) with the exponent @xmath86 and 1/3 and the other is the hu and sawiciki model ( [ hsm ] ) . in the jordan frame ,",
    "the former did not show past oscillations around the phantom divide and its evolution was terminated around @xmath156 for @xmath86 . on the the other hand",
    ", the latter did not provide any past evolution in both einstein - like and jordan frames .",
    "similarly , we confirm that there are future oscillations around @xmath82 for the reduced ricci scalar @xmath46  @xcite .",
    "as was expected , the cosmological constant model has no frame - dependence and we could not find any future oscillations around the phantom divide around @xmath157 for the exponential gravity in ( [ ex - pot ] ) .    for whole evolution from the past to future when imposing initial conditions at the present time",
    ", the cosmological evolution is allowed in the einstein - like frame better than in the jordan frame .",
    "this means that the cosmological evolution of @xmath0-fluid determined from its form of energy density and pressure , depending on the given frame .",
    "also , it was proven that the termination ( singularity ) appeared in cosmological evolution is closely related to the form of @xmath0-fluid for given frame .",
    "this has arisen from @xmath158 in the first friedmann equations ( [ r - eq ] ) and ( [ r - eq - jordan ] ) . as a result , it is so because of the violation of the stability condition ( non - tachyon ) of @xmath0 gravity .",
    "consequently , we have successfully performed ( whole ) cosmological evolution of @xmath0 gravities by choosing two different state variables of energy density and pressure , and pointed out why the singularity appeared in the backward evolution when the initial condition was chosen as the present time .",
