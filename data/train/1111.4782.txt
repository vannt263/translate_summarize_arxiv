    "the transport of a polymer across a nanopore is vital to many biological processes , such as dna and rna translocation through nuclear pores , protein transport across membrane channels and virus injection  @xcite . due to various potential technological applications such as rapid dna sequencing , gene therapy and controlled drug delivery  @xcite ,",
    "polymer translocation has received considerable experimental  @xcite and theoretical interest  @xcite .",
    "of particular technological interest is the case of driven translocation , where the process is facilitated by an external driving force .",
    "the key theoretical issue here is to find a unifying physical description that yields the correct dynamical behavior , e.g. , the dependence of the translocation time @xmath1 on the chain length @xmath2 . experiments and numerical simulations have indicated that @xmath3 . however , numerous different values of @xmath4 have been observed , suggesting explicit dependence on the various physical parameters ( cf . ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "several theories of driven polymer translocation have emerged  @xcite , some claiming agreement with the experimental or numerical results within a certain subset of the physical parameter space . however , to date no single theory has been able to capture the wide range of observed values of @xmath4 , nor quantitatively explain the reason for their dependence on the system s parameters .",
    "therefore , the need for a unifying theory of driven translocation remains .    in refs .",
    "@xcite , polymer translocation was described as a one - dimensional barrier crossing problem of the translocation coordinate @xmath5 ( the length of the subchain on the _ trans _ side ) . here ,",
    "the chain starts from the _ cis _ side with one end inside the pore ( @xmath6 ) and is considered as translocated once @xmath7 , with @xmath8 the segment length .",

    "the brownian dynamics equation for @xmath5 in the overdamped limit follows as @xmath15 - \\frac{\\delta\\mu}{a } + \\zeta(t).$ ] here @xmath16 is the ( constant ) effective friction , and @xmath17 is gaussian white noise satisfying @xmath18 and @xmath19 . for",
    "moderate to large @xmath9 , this model describes translocation at constant mean velocity @xmath20 .",
    "however , it is known that the translocation process initially slows down and finally speeds up towards the end  @xcite .",
    "qualitatively , this observation has been explained by a simple force - balance argument , where the friction @xmath16 depends on the number of moving monomers on the _ cis _ side subchain  @xcite . in refs .",
    "@xcite , it is assumed that the whole subchain on the _ cis _ side is set into motion immediately after the force at the pore is applied . however , this assumption is only valid in the limit of extremely weak driving force , where the _ cis _ side subchain is always at equilibrium . in most cases ,",
    "the driving force is substantially larger , implying that even the subchains are out of equilibrium  @xcite .",
    "it has been proposed that in this regime , the out - of - equilibrium dynamics can be described by tension propagation ( tp ) along the chain backbone , which leads to nontrivial time - dependence of the drag force and gives the non - monotonic translocation velocity  @xcite . however ,",
    "this idea has not been quantitatively verified , since most of the studies have considered the asymptotic limit @xmath21 , which is out of reach of experiments and numerical simulations .",
    "therefore , it is imperative to study the tp mechanism for finite @xmath2 , which is the regime that is experimentally relevant and where numerical simulation data are available .    to this end , in this work we adopt the tp formalism in context of the brownian dynamics ( bd ) equation of motion for @xmath5 mentioned above , in which we introduce a time - dependent friction coefficient @xmath22 that is determined by the tp equations .",
    "we introduce a tp formalism for finite chain lengths by incorporating the pore - polymer interactions to the tp equations .",
    "we solve the resulting brownian dynamics ",
    "tension propagation ( bdtp ) model at finite chain length @xmath2 , and validate it through extensive comparisons with molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations .",
    "we verify that the tension propagation mechanism dominates the dynamics of driven translocation .",
    "in addition , we show that the model quantitatively reproduces the numerical values of @xmath4 in various regimes without any free parameters , explaining the diversity in @xmath4 as a finite chain length effect . finally , we address the recent theoretical disagreement between the constant - velocity tp theory of refs .",
    "@xcite and the constant - flux tp theory of ref .",
    "@xcite and show that at the asymptotic limit , @xmath21 , @xmath4 approaches @xmath23 .",
    "we introduce dimensionless units for length , force , time , velocity and friction as @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the solvent friction per monomer . in these units ,",
    "the bd equation reads @xmath30 + \\tilde{f } + \\tilde{\\zeta}(t ) \\equiv \\tilde{f}_\\mathrm{tot } , \\label{eq : motion_dimless}\\ ] ] where , for simplicity , we have assumed that the pore length @xmath31 .",
    "generalization of eq .",
    "( [ eq : motion_dimless ] ) to different pore lengths is straightforward ( see , e.g. , ref  @xcite ) .",
    "( [ eq : motion_dimless ] ) is , of course , approximative rather than rigorously exact .",
    "it contains two approximations , which we will show to be valid by quantitative comparison with md simulations .",
    "first , we postulate that the friction @xmath32 is determined by tp on the _ cis _ side subchain . while there is no conclusive _ a priori _ reason to neglect the non - equilibrium effects of the _ trans _ side subchain , we will show that those effects are negligibly small in the experimentally and computationally relevant regimes .",
    "second , we note that eq .",
    "( [ eq : motion_dimless ] ) includes the entropic force , whose form is strictly valid only for small driving forces @xmath33 , when the translocation time @xmath34 is comparable to the rouse relaxation time  @xcite .",
    "however , for larger @xmath33 , the average contribution of the entropic force to the total force @xmath35 is very small ( see results below for discussion ) .",
    "therefore , even for large forces , the model will be shown to give excellent agreement with md simulations .    the effective friction @xmath32 actually consists of two contributions .",
    "the first one is the drag force of the _ cis _ side subchain that is solved with the tp formalism .",
    "the other one is the frictional interaction between the pore and the polymer .",
    "formally , we can write @xmath36 as the sum of the _ cis _ side subchain and pore frictions , @xmath37 .",
    "while for @xmath21 the first term dominates , for finite @xmath2 the pore friction can significantly affect the translocation dynamics .",
    "we will come back to this issue later , but let us first look at how the time - dependent part of the friction can be determined from the tp formalism . in the special case of extremely large driving force , one can find @xmath38 directly from the tp equations .",
    "more generally , however , it is easier to derive the velocity of the monomers at the pore entrance , @xmath39 .",
    "in such a case , the effective friction is in a natural way defined as @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the line density of monomers near the pore and @xmath42 is the flux of monomers through the pore entrance . in either case",
    ", determining @xmath32 essentially reduces to calculating the number of moving monomers , whose combined drag force then constitutes the time - dependent part of the friction . as the driving force is applied , the chain begins to move in stages , with the segments closest to the pore being set into motion first .",
    "a close analogue is a coil of rope pulled from one end , which first uncoils before starting to move as a whole . to keep track of the moving part of the chain",
    ", one defines a _ tension front _ , which divides the chain into the moving part that is under tension , and the nonmoving part outside the front ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : configuration ] ) .",
    "the front is located at @xmath43 , and propagates in time as parts of the chain further away from the pore are set in motion .",
    "the last monomer within the tension front is labeled as @xmath44 . using the tp formalism",
    ", one can derive an equation of motion for the tension front , using either @xmath45 or @xmath46 as the dynamical variable .",
    "the details of this calculation can be found in the appendix .",
    "depending on the magnitude of the driving force , the equation of motion for the tension front attains a slightly different form . in the simplest case , when the driving force is very large compared to temperature and chain length , @xmath47 , the moving part of the chain is almost completely straight . in this",
    "_ strong stretching _ ( ss )",
    "regime , the equation of motion is  @xcite @xmath48 here , @xmath49 , with @xmath50 being the number of moving monomers on the _ cis _ side .",
    "the flory exponent @xmath51 and the prefactor @xmath52 are related to the end - to - end distance of the polymer , @xmath53 . in the ss approximation , eq .",

    "fig : configuration ] ) . in this _ stem - flower _ ( sf ) regime , the line density and and velocity of the monomers are not constant in space .",

    "we stress that this agreement tells that the translocation dynamics is reproduced correctly at the most fundamental level and that such an agreement is a vital requirement for any correct theoretical model .",
    "the comparison also reveals an extremely lucid picture of the translocation process : first , as tension propagates along the chain , the effective friction increases and translocation slows down . in the second stage , the number of dragged monomers is reduced as the tail retracts , and translocation speeds up .     in both 2d and 3d for md and the bdtp model .",

    "[ fig : alpha_asym ] ) and ii ) for a fixed @xmath2 , @xmath4 decreases with @xmath122 , as shown in table i for 2d and 3d ( refs .",
    "@xcite ) . for @xmath123 ,",

    ", @xmath4 is almost independent of @xmath122 .",
    "therefore , the increase of @xmath4 in the last two lines of table i ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) is in fact due to increase in @xmath2 , not in @xmath122 .",
    "finally , we have estimated the asymptotic value of @xmath4 in the sf regime by solving the bdtp model up to @xmath125 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : alpha_asym ] ) .",
    "in 2d , the numerical estimate is @xmath126 , for @xmath127 , and , in 3d , @xmath128 , for @xmath127 . in both cases ,",
    "we recover the value @xmath129 as predicted in ref .",
    "@xcite with the constant - flux tp theory , and recently also using a different approach  @xcite . however , the value is different from sakaue s original prediction of @xmath130  @xcite .",
    "the reason for the different predictions is that in both refs .",
    "@xcite , and in our model , the number of monomers is globally conserved , whereas in refs .",
    "@xcite the conservation is guaranteed only locally in the neighborhood of @xmath131 .",
    "therefore , asymptotically , @xmath132 in both 2d and 3d , also in agreement with the prediction of ref .  @xcite .",
    "to summarize , we have introduced a new theoretical model of driven polymer translocation that has only two degrees of freedom and no free parameters .",
    "the model gives near - exact agreement with high - accuracy molecular dynamics simulations in a wide range of parameters .",
    "our study shows that the dynamics of driven translocation is dictated by non - equilibrium tension propagation on the _ cis _ side subchain .",
    "the model also reveals that the majority of experiments and simulations in the literature are performed in the regime , where finite chain length effects have significant impact on the translocation dynamics .",
    "although mostly overlooked in the literature , this is an important observation , since the finite chain length effects persists for chain lengths of at least several tens of thousands of monomers .",
