    "many nebulae around evolved stars posses a dense equatorial ring . these include both progenitors of core collapse supernovae ( ccsne ) , e.g. , sn  1987a , and lower mass planetary nebulae ( pn ) and pre - pn , e.g. , the necklace pn ( pn  g054.2 - 03.4 ) .",
    "there is no consensus yet on the formation mechanism of the equatorial ring and its relation to the bipolar nebula found in all these systems .",
    "the inner ( equatorial ) ring of 1987a is presently energized by the collision of the sn ejecta , and it can be clearly resolved into many dense clumps ( e.g. , @xcite ) . the radius of the ring is @xmath0 @xcite , and its total ionized mass is @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the center of the ring is offset by @xmath2 ( of its radius ) from the sn explosion @xcite .",
    "the total mass of the circumstellar matter ( csm ) nebula of sn 1987a is @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "this implies that the mass in the equatorial ring is a small fraction of the nebular mass ( even if the mass in the equatorial ring is several times the ionized mass in the ring ) .",
    "for a recent summary of the csm properties of sn 1987a see @xcite . @xcite and",
    "@xcite find the equatorial ring around the b - type supergiant sbw1 and that around the luminous blue variable ( lbv ) candidate hd 168625 , respectively , to be similar in some respects the inner ring of sn 1987a ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite point to some similarity between the ring nebula of the blue supergiant sher  25 and the hourglass shape of the csm of sn  1987a .",
    "for example , the ring in sher  25 expands at @xmath4 , compared with @xmath5 in sn  1987a . both the ring and the bipolar lobes of sher  25",
    "were formed in a brief and violent major outburst with a very high mass - loss rate about @xmath6 ago @xcite . in sn  1987a ,",
    "on the other hand , based on dynamical timescales , the inner ring is @xmath7 younger than the outer rings .",
    "the ionized mass in the hourglass nebula of sher  25 is @xmath8 , while that in the ring is only @xmath9 .",
    "@xcite did not find an interacting or close stellar companion to sher  25 . in the scenario proposed in the present study",
    "a binary companion had entered the envelope of sher  25 about @xmath6 ago .",
    "the necklace pn has been studied by @xcite and its central binary system was further explored by @xcite .",
    "the ring expands with a velocity of @xmath10 , and the total ionized mass of the nebula , most of it in the ring , is @xmath11 .",
    "the ring was ejected @xmath12 ago and the two opposite polar caps , which were most likely formed by two opposite jets , are @xmath13 old @xcite",
    ". the ring does not seem to posses perfect symmetry around the central star ; there seems to be more mass to the north - west direction .",
    "the orbital period of the central binary system is 1.16  day , which indicates that the system went through a common envelope ( ce ) evolution .",
    "the total mass in the ring , @xmath14 , is much smaller than any mass ejected in the ce process that shrank the binary orbit .",
    "a somewhat similar structure of bipolar nebulae and a ring is seen around post - agb stars @xcite , e.g. , the red rectangle @xcite .",
    "however , in the red rectangle the ring is in a keplerian rotation @xcite , there is an outflowing disk , and the secondary star did not enter a ce phase @xcite .",
    "this type of systems will be studied in a forthcoming paper .",
    "we note the following common properties to the equatorial rings in the necklace and most of the equatorial rings of the massive stars with csm rings , in particular sn 1987a .",
    "( 1 ) the general nebular structure composed of the equatorial ring and a bipolar nebula , e.g. , a nebula with prominent two outer rings in sn  1987a @xcite , and polar clumps ( formed by jets ) in the necklace .",
    "other pne show a clumpy ring in the equatorial plane of a bipolar structure , e.g. , ngc  6309 @xcite .",
    "( 2 ) the equatorial ring is broken to many clumps .",
    "( 3 ) displacement from a perfect axisymmetry around the star .",
    "this suggests a short interaction time , or interaction in an eccentric orbit .",
    "a short interaction time , say few orbital periods or less , suggest instability of the orbital motion .",
    "we will examine the possibility of the system being in a darwin unstable phase during the formation of the ring .",
    "( 4 ) the mass in the ring is a small fraction of that in the nebula . ( 5 ) large parts of the polar regions of the nebula , both in sn 1987a and the necklace , were formed before the ring .",
    "however , in sher  25 the bipolar nebula and ring have been ejected together and during a short time @xcite . as well , it seems that there are bipolar regions connected to the equatorial ring in sn 1987a @xcite and in sbw1 @xcite .",
    "the relation to a bipolar structure and the small mass of the ring suggest that the ring formation comes with the formation of a bipolar nebula .",
    "( 6 ) it is commonly accepted that in all systems , pn and massive blue giants , a fast wind , @xmath15 , was blown shortly after the ejection of the ring .    there is also one significant difference between the systems . in the necklace",
    "the ce process had removed the entire envelope , while in sn  1987a and the other massive stars a massive stellar envelope had survived .",
    "hence , under our assumption of a common formation mechanism , the ring in the necklace was not formed from the final ejection of the ce .",
    "let us add here two more systems , the born - again planetary nebulae a30 and a78 ( @xcite for a most recent paper and references therein ) .",
    "both pne show in their inner region an equatorial ring of knots and faster polar outflows , that @xcite claim to have been ejected in one event in each pn .",
    "the polar knots can reach velocities of @xmath16 .",
    "a fast wind ( @xmath17 ) blown after the ejection of the ring and polar outflows interacted with the knots @xcite .",
    "a late fast wind is common to sn  1987a and the necklace as well .",
    "such a wind can clean the inner region from low density slowly - moving gas , e.g. , gas between the dense equators to condense polar regions .",
    "there is no indication yet for binary systems at the center of these two pne .",
    "another interesting object is the classical nova v959 mon , for which @xcite argue for equatorial outflow and a faster polar outflow .",
    "a clear bi - lobed morphology appears @xmath18days past the detection of @xmath19-ray emission .",
    "@xcite mention that a fast central wind can be focused to the polar directions by the dense equatorial gas .",
    "we note that it is quite possible that two opposite jets were launched by the wd few months after outburst , as has been suggested by @xcite for nova v1494 aql . in this paper",
    "we follow @xcite and raise the possibility that jets compress an equatorial outflow , rather than an equatorial outflow that focuses a polar outflow , in nova v959 mon and the other objects discussed here .",
    "many models have been proposed for the formation of equatorial rings , both single - star models , e.g. , @xcite , and binary models , e.g. , @xcite who studied a merger model for the triple ring system of sn  1987a .",
    "we instead take the view that such nebulae are shaped by jets ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and lobes inflated by the jets can compress an equatorial disk or ring @xcite .",
    "we will use the common properties to examine a common formation mechanism of the equatorial rings in the systems listed above .",
    "@xcite run a bipolar outflow into a thin shell .",
    "their study has some common features with the mechanism proposed by @xcite and simulated by @xcite . @xcite",
    "were aiming at forming several rings outside the equatorial plane . at late times",
    "they have no equatorial ring , but only rings above and below the plane .",
    "their equatorial ring is observed only at early times , and it is not formed by compression of gas toward the equatorial plane by jets .",
    "the mechanism studied here is based on jets that compress an equatorial outflow , as outlined in @xcite , and should be considered different in many respects from that studied by @xcite .",
    "we will differ from @xcite by considering jets - csm interaction much closer to the binary systems in a process that might also be observed as an intermediate - luminosity optical transient ( ilot ; also termed : intermediate - luminosity red transient ; red transient ; red nova ; luminous red nova ) .",
    "ilots are eruptive events with a typical decay time of weeks to years and with a peak luminosity between those of novae and supernovae ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "several studies in recent years pointed to some connections between different ilots , e.g , between ngc  300ot and pre - planetary nebulae ( pne ) @xcite , between ngc  300ot and the great eruption of @xmath20 car , @xcite , and between ngc  300ot and the pn ngc  6302 and the pre - pns oh231.8 + 4.2 , m1 - 92 and iras  22036 + 5306 @xcite .",
    "@xcite proposed that the lobes of some ( but not all ) pns and pre - pns were formed in a several month - long ilot event ( or several close sub - events ) .",
    "this process was recently simulated by @xcite , who also summarize the expected properties of the nebular parts of a pn that are formed by an ilot event ( in general not all nebular components are formed by an ilot ) .",
    "@xcite , for example , raised the possibility that the lobes of the pn kjpn  8 were formed in an ilot event .    in section [ sec : darwin ]",
    "we examine the possibility that the formation episode of the rings , either by mass loss from the second lagrangian point ( @xmath21 ) or by jets , occurred during a relatively short phase of darwin instability . in section [ sec : l2 ]",
    "we analyze the mass lose through the second lagrangian point ( @xmath21 ) and conclude that it is unlikely by itself to explain the equatorial rings .",
    "in section [ sec : hydro ] we use a 3d hydrodynamical code to simulate ring formation by a brief jet - launching episode , that might lead also to an ilot .",
    "our summary is in section [ sec : summary ] .",
    "we consider a binary system composed of a primary giant star and a more compact secondary star , mainly a main sequence ( ms ) star .",
    "the giant primary star can be a red giant branch ( rgb ) star , and asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) star , e.g. , in the case of pne , or a red supergiant ( rsg ) , e.g. , in the case of the progenitor of the sn  1987a nebula .",
    "we study processes where the expanding equatorial rings mentioned in section [ sec : intro ] were formed in a relatively short time , i.e. , much shorter than the phase of high mass loss rate .",
    "the high mass loss rate of agb and rsg stars can last hundreds to thousands of years , while the brief ring formation episode is assumed to take place within months to tens of years , @xmath22 .",
    "we are not considering here the formation of rotating ( keplerian ) disks .",
    "we assume that the brief ring formation episode takes place while the system is in an unstable darwin phase .",
    "before the ring formation episode the secondary star brings the giant envelope to synchronization with the orbital motion ( co - rotation ) , and the the system is darwin stable , i.e. , @xmath23 . here",
    "@xmath24 and @xmath25 are the moments of inertia of the binary system and the primary star , respectively . due to further spiraling - in as a result of loss of angular momentum and/or due to the expansion of the giant star , at some stage the system becomes darwin unstable .",
    "we can constrain the mass of the secondary star under these assumptions when interaction starts .",
    "tidal interaction becomes strong when the primary radius becomes @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the orbital separation when tidal interaction starts to dominate the orbital evolution @xcite .",
    "we demand that by the time the binary system has spiraled - in to @xmath28 the primary envelope has reached co - rotation ( the derivation is not sensitive to the exact value in the range of @xmath29 ) .",
    "the moment of inertia of the giant envelope is taken to be @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the convective envelope mass and @xmath32 is the giant radius . for agb stars @xmath33 .",
    "for the progenitor of sn  1987a during its rsg phase we run a model with an initial mass of @xmath34 using the modules for experiments in stellar astrophysics ( mesa ) , version 6596 @xcite . at its rsg phase @xmath35 before explosion",

    "the above condition to reach synchronization at @xmath41 gives a constraint of @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the giant envelope mass when tidal synchronization takes place .",
    "the darwin instability might occur before or after the primary fills its roche lobe .",
    "we demand that the system enters the darwin instability when the secondary is outside the primary , but not too close , e.g. , @xmath44 .",
    "the condition reads @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the giant envelope mass when darwin instability occurs .",
    "over all , the scenario of ring formation during a darwin unstable phase reads @xmath47 where we assumed that the envelope mass did not change much between the tidal synchronization and darwin instability phases .    for the progenitor of sn  1987a condition ( [ eq : m2 ] ) reads @xmath48 . in the merger model of @xcite",
    "the secondary mass is @xmath49 , and most of the mass is ejected in mid - latitudes , not in the equatorial plane .",
    "@xcite required a secondary mass of @xmath50 to account for the deformation of envelope after the merger . considering the uncertainties in the above estimates of the binary companion mass , the mass range found by us here can accommodate these models .",
    "we emphasize that for the progenitor of sn  1987a we consider a complete rapid merger when the giant core is made out of co , unlike the incomplete merger discussed by @xcite .    for a low mass agb star with an envelope mass of @xmath51 near the tip of the agb , condition ( [ eq : m2 ] )",

    "this mass range is smaller than the secondary mass range of @xmath53 mentioned by @xcite for the necklace .",
    "we later present our view that the ring in the necklace was formed in a post - ce event , like a born - again object .",
    "we now turn to examine two processes that can operate more efficiently during a darwin unstable phase and lead to equatorial mass outflow : the mass loss from the second lagrangian point @xmath21 ( section [ sec : l2 ] ) , and the launching of two opposite jets ( section [ sec : hydro ] ) .",
    "the later can work efficiently even if the system is darwin stable .",

    "we here repeat those calculations and present them in a way appropriate for our goals .",
    "we first consider the angular momentum of the mass leaving through @xmath21 , and then consider the energy of this mass .",
    "the mass loss process from @xmath21 has been discussed in many papers , e.g. , @xcite for a recent paper on v838  mon , but in many cases for rotating disks rather than expanding ones ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",

    "from angular momentum considerations we can get an expression for the decrease in orbital separation when ( @xmath66 ) mass loss occurs only from @xmath21 , ( @xmath67 ) we neglect the moment of inertia of the primary star , and ( @xmath68 ) no mass accretion by the secondary star takes place . taking a small mass loss such that @xmath69 does not change much",

    "-0.7 cm    -0.7 cm    0.4 cm      a key process for the presently proposed model for the formation of a clumpy equatorial ring is that the csm gas is compressed toward the equatorial plane by the jets , and that it survives for a long time . for that to occur",
    "the following conditions must be met .",
    "( 1 ) cooling time .",
    "since the initial momentum of each jet is away from the equatorial plane , to exert the force toward that plane , the jet must be shocked and form a hot bubble .",
    "for the hot bubble to exert enough pressure its cooling time must be long . either the radiative emissivity is low , as in @xcite , or the photon diffusion time out , @xmath139 , is not much shorter than the flow time , @xmath140 , as is the case here . the ratio @xmath141 is given in equation ( 8) of @xcite .",
    "( 2 ) no holes in the csm .",
    "the compression of the csm toward the equatorial plane must occur before the hot bubble pressure decreases too much . to not lose pressure by gas leakage , there should be no ` holes ' in the csm through which the hot bubble gas can escape .",
    "( 3 ) no hole drilling .",
    "another condition for the bubble pressure not to decrease too rapidly is that the expansion along the polar direction should not be much faster than in other directions .",
    "this translates for the jets not to be too narrow . with a half opening angle of @xmath142",
    "we still get a clear ring .",
    "the exact limit depends on the other parameters of the jets and the density profile of the csm .",
    "for example , in a case with a little csm mass along the polar directions and narrow jets , the jets will drill a hole through the csm , and the hot bubble gas will leak . for the csm and outflow parameters used here jets with @xmath143 can lead to a ring formation .",
    "( 4 ) sufficient energy in the shocked jets . to influence the equatorial gas there should be enough energy in the bubble to compress the csm near the equatorial plane . in our simulations",
    "the total kinetic energy of the jets were about three orders of magnitude more than the energy ( thermal and kinetic ) of the csm .",
    "however , inspection of the velocity maps show that the fast outflow takes place away from the equatorial plane .",
    "only a small fraction of the jets energy goes to the compression . in our simulations a clear ring develops early on , even for narrow jets and for dense csm .",
    "we estimate that it is sufficient that the energy in wide - fast jets be more than an order of magnitude of that in the csm for a ring to form .",
    "narrower jets require more energy for the hot bubble they inflate to form a ring .",
    "( 5 ) no destruction by a late central wind . in some cases , like in sn  1987a and in pne , after the short interaction , the central star can blow a fast spherical wind .",
    "although the wind is tenuous , it can last for thousands of years .",
    "this fast wind can clear the lower density regions of the bipolar bubbles , and leave a large contrast between the equatorial ring and the rest of the nebula .",
    "as well , it can lead to the formation of two rings , one above and one below the equatorial plane .",
    "it is required that the fast wind does not destroy the ring .",
    "our study of a flow with a spherical fast wind will be published in the near future .",
    "we studied the formation of expanding equatorial rings around evolved giant stars ( rgb , agb , and rsg stars ) .",
    "such rings can reveal themselves when ionized at later times by the central star , either a central star of a pn or an exploding massive star .",
    "based on many similarities between rings around massive stars , that are progenitors of core collapse supernovae ( ccsne ) , and rings in pns , we assumed that the ring formation mechanism is similar in all these types of evolved stars ( section [ sec : intro ] ) .",
    "the main similarity we referred to is the presence of a bipolar nebula in most of these systems .",
    "in section [ sec : l2 ] we examined the formation of the ring by mass loss from the second lagrangian point ( @xmath21 ) beyond the compact companion to the giant star .",
    "this process is most likely to occur when the system is in a darwin unstable phase ( section [ sec : darwin ] ) .",
    "we found that this process might indeed take place @xcite , but that extra energy must be given to the mass leaving from @xmath21 .",
    "a second problem might be to maintain the flow of gas from @xmath21 parallel to the equatorial plane .",
    "the gas is close to the binary system , hence hot .",
    "it is expected to expand away from the equatorial plane , making the formation of a dense equatorial ring questionable .",
    "a third problem might be the formation of a clumpy ring , as the outflow from @xmath21 occurs over many orbital periods and the ring is expected to be smooth .",
    "in section [ sec : hydro ] we studied the compression of an equatorial ring by bipolar jets , as suggested by @xcite .",
    "we found that the process leads to the formation of a dense and clumpy equatorial ring .",
    "we therefore suggest that clumpy equatorial rings , such as in the necklace pn and in an  1987a , as well as many other similar objects , are formed by this process . in most cases",
    "the jets are launched from an accretion disk around a compact companion .    in this first study",
    "we did not follow the ring evolution beyond the short time of its formation . in most , or even in all , of the systems with clumpy rings mentioned in section [ sec : intro ] , a fast tenuous wind is blown after the intensive mass loss episode .",
    "this fast wind might clean the low - density regions , leaving behind only the dense regions , such as the equatorial ring .",
    "this might even form polar rings , such as the outer rings in sn  1987a .",
    "the later evolution of the ring after the fast tenuous wind has turned on is the subject of a forthcoming paper ."
