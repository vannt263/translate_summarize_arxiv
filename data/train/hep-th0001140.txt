    "nonsingular spacetimes and those containing black holes are qualitatively quite different . nevertheless , it is possible to find sequences of spacetimes that , while remaining nonsingular , come arbitrarily close to having horizons @xcite . in a previous paper",
    "@xcite we studied a class of such solutions that are associated with self - gravitating monopoles in a spontaneously broken yang - mills theory .",
    "the emphasis there was on the detailed behavior of the fields as one approaches the critical solution in which a horizon first appeared . in this paper",
    ", we concentrate instead on the geometrical aspects of the spacetimes associated with these objects near criticality , and on using these to gain insights into the properties of true black holes .    as in ref .",
    "@xcite , we restrict ourselves to spherically symmetric spacetimes and write the metric in the form @xmath0 a horizon corresponds to a zero of @xmath1 ; the horizon is extremal if @xmath2 also vanishes .",
    "we work in the context of an su(2 ) gauge theory with gauge coupling @xmath3 and a triplet higgs field @xmath4 whose vacuum expectation value @xmath5 breaks the symmetry down to u(1 ) . in flat spacetime",
    "this theory possesses a finite energy monopole solution with magnetic charge @xmath6 and mass @xmath7 .",
    "it has a core region , of radius @xmath8 , with nontrivial higgs and massive vector boson fields . beyond this core",
    "is a coulomb region in which all massive fields approach their vacuum values exponentially rapidly , leaving only the coulomb magnetic field .",
    "the effects of adding gravitational interactions depend on the value of @xmath5 . for @xmath5",
    "much less than the planck mass @xmath9 , one finds that @xmath1 is equal to unity at the origin , decreases to a minimum at a radius of order @xmath10 , and then increases again with @xmath11 . as @xmath5",
    "is increased , this minimum becomes deeper , until an extremal horizon develops at a critical value @xmath12 of the order @xmath9 . as we describe in more detail in sec .",
    "ii , two distinct types of critical behavior are possible , depending on the ratio of the higgs and gauge boson masses . for lower values of this ratio",
    ", one finds `` coulomb - type '' critical solutions , in which the horizon occurs in the coulomb region of the monopole at @xmath13 . outside the horizon",
    ", the metric is that of an extremal reissner - nordstrom black hole , with @xmath14 while the massive fields take on their vacuum values . as the higgs self - coupling increases",
    ", there is a transition to `` core - type '' critical solutions that have a horizon inside the monopole core and nontrivial matter fields ( or hair ) outside the horizon .    in both types of critical monopole solutions",
    "the fields remain nonsingular at @xmath15 .",
    "however , it is also possible to have solutions with singularities at @xmath15 that can be viewed as self - gravitating monopoles with schwarzschild black holes at their center .",
    "as long as the mass of the central black hole is not too great , the variation of these solutions with @xmath5 is quite similar to that of the nonsingular monopoles , and one finds the same two types of critical behavior @xcite .    after reviewing these solutions ,",
    "we discuss in sec .",
    "iii how near - critical monopoles might appear to an outside observer .",
    "one would expect the measurements made by such an observer to vary continuously with the parameters of the monopole and to show no discontinuity at the critical solution .",
    "the external observer could probe the monopole with either particles or waves . in the case of the particle , we find that the time needed for the particle to emerge from the interior ( as measured by a static external observer using `` schwarzschild time '' ) diverges as the critical solution is approached . when a wave is sent in , there is a reflected wave due to the gravitational field just outside the horizon and a transmitted wave that passes through the interior and then emerges with a time delay . as before , the time delay diverges as @xmath16 , while the reflected wave becomes indistinguishable from that due to a black hole .",
    "using either type of probe , an observer whose lifetime is finite can not distinguish between a true black hole and a nonsingular , subcritical solution that is sufficiently close to being critical .",
    "we discuss the implications for our understanding of black hole entropy .",
    "we also find that the near - critical coulomb - type solutions display what horowitz and ross @xcite have termed naked - black - hole behavior , even though there is no black hole at all .",
    "this is characterized by the fact that a freely - falling observer passing through the minimum of @xmath1 ( we shall refer to the location of this minimum as the quasi - horizon ) feels a tidal force that diverges as the critical solution is approached . for core - type solutions , on the other hand ,",
    "no such behavior is observed .    in sec .",
    "iv , we consider the effect of having additional matter fall into a near - critical solution , addressing in particular the question of whether this process could produce an extremal black hole .",
    "extremal black holes are especially interesting from the standpoint of black hole thermodynamics because they have vanishing hawking temperature .",
    "the analogies between black hole dynamics and thermodynamics thus suggest that they should be rather difficult , if not impossible , to create .",
    "indeed , one of the formulations @xcite of the third law of black hole dynamics asserts the impossibility ( under certain technical assumptions ) of making a nonextremal black hole extremal .",
    "one could also envision producing an extremal black hole starting from a nonsingular spacetime .",
    "boulware @xcite showed that this can be done by the collapse of a charged shell of matter .",
    "however , this mechanism relies critically on the shell being infinitely thin ; shells of finite thickness and density do not collapse to an extremal configuration .",
    "it is easy to understand the difficulty of making an extremal black hole if one recalls that the extremal reissner - nordstrom black hole is characterized by having a mass and a charge that ( in appropriately rescaled planck units ) are equal .",
    "forming such an object by the collapse of a shell with equal charge and mass densities involves a delicate balance between electromagnetic and gravitational forces .",
    "one could instead try to achieve extremality by adding matter to a pre - existing nonextremal reissner - nordstrom black hole ( i.e. one with greater mass than charge ) .",
    "however , because the added matter would have to have more charge than mass , the coulomb repulsion between the black hole and the infalling matter would tend to overcome their gravitational attraction .",
    "the situation is rather different in our case , because the nonsingular monopole solutions are _ overcharged _ ; i.e. , their long range fields are those of a reissner - nordstrom solution with greater charge than mass . allowing uncharged matter to fall into these objects increases their mass and should bring them closer to criticality . if the amount of matter entering is just sufficient to create a zero of @xmath1 , one would expect an extremal solution to result .",
    "we will present numerical arguments that support this expectation .",
    "finally , we make some concluding remarks in sec .  v.",

    "if we instead set @xmath54 , then @xmath29 is finite and varying inside the horizon and infinite for @xmath55 ; depending on the value of @xmath35 , the minimum of @xmath29 may be at @xmath15 or at some finite radius , but in neither case does @xmath29 have a zero . for near - critical solutions where the minimum value @xmath56 is small but nonzero , we find that the ratio @xmath57 varies as @xmath58 , where @xmath59 ranges from about 0.7 to unity .",
    "a rather different type of critical solution is found for larger @xmath35 .",
    "for these core - type solutions the horizon occurs at a radius @xmath60 , with the values @xmath61 and @xmath62 of the matter fields at this point being different than their asymptotic values .",
    "although the solutions are still nonanalytic at the horizon , this nonanalyticity occurs only in subdominant terms .",
    "thus , @xmath1 again vanishes as @xmath63 as one approaches the horizon , but the coefficient is now the same inside and outside the horizon . ,",
    "subcritical monopoles exhibit both core - type and coulomb - type quasi - horizons .",
    "however , as one approaches criticality for a given value of @xmath35 , only one quasi - horizon actually becomes a horizon .",
    "the other quasi - horizon , though interesting , is essentially irrelevant for our purposes . ]",
    "the radial derivatives of both matter fields are finite at the horizon , so @xmath64 remains finite and there is no sharp change in @xmath50 at the horizon . because @xmath50 remains finite and nonzero",
    ", @xmath29 has a zero at the horizon that coincides with the zero of @xmath1 .",
    "these solutions can be generalized to include a black hole in the center of the monopole . instead of requiring that the fields be nonsingular at @xmath15 , one instead",
    "requires that there be a zero of @xmath1 at a nonzero radius @xmath65 . at this zero , the equations for the matter fields become constraint equations relating the fields and their first derivative ; solving these constraints yields enough boundary conditions to determine a solution .",

    ", one can instead increase @xmath65 with @xmath37 held fixed ; this is much more analogous to the process of actually dropping matter into a near - critical solution that we will consider in sec .",

    "this should be compared with the proper time along the worldline of constant @xmath45 .",
    "this is finite for the subcritical case , whereas in the critical case the proper times along the segments ad and db are both infinite , corresponding to the fact that an observer in the exterior region containing a can not detect objects behind the horizon pd . in order to obtain consistency with our physical expectations of continuity",

    "there is a contribution from @xmath90 associated with the growth of @xmath91 . in the coulomb - type solutions",
    "the near - vanishing of @xmath92 [ see eq .",

    "the @xmath98-dependent term in @xmath99 can be neglected for any @xmath98 such that the particle could have reached @xmath74 . by a similar argument , we see that any particle that reaches @xmath74 goes through the peak of @xmath32 before turning around . hence , @xmath100 where the ellipses represent subdominant terms .    for coulomb solutions the dominant effect is due to the fact that @xmath101 is almost vanishing throughout the interior region .",

    "thus , @xmath103 where @xmath104 is of order unity .    rather than sending in a particle , one can also probe the near - black hole by sending in a wave packet . as an example , let us consider a free massive scalar field @xmath4 , whose field equation in curved spacetime takes the form @xmath105 + m^2 \\phi\\ . \\label{scalar}\\ ] ] this can be put into a more tractable form by writing @xmath106 and defining a new coordinate @xmath107 satisfying @xmath108 equation  ( [ scalar ] ) then takes the form of a one - dimensional wave equation @xmath109   \\psi\\ ] ] with a scattering potential @xmath110   +   { j(j+1 ) b\\over r^2}\\ .\\ ] ]    when a wave packet incident from large @xmath45 reaches the region near the quasi - horizon , a portion is reflected by the scattering potential , while a portion is transmitted and emerge with some time delay .",
    "if a near - critical solution is to appear essentially indistinguishable from a black hole to an outside observer , two conditions must hold .",
    "first , the reflection coefficient as a function of wave number must approach that of the black hole as @xmath111 .",
    "second , the time delay in the emergence of the transmitted wave should diverge in the critical limit .    to see how the first of these conditions comes about ,",
    "let us use eq .",
    "( [ abeqn ] ) to rewrite the scattering potential as @xmath112\\ .\\ ] ] for both core- and coulomb - type solutions the quantity @xmath113 remains finite in the critical limit , while the second term in the brackets is zero at the quasi - horizon . since @xmath114 , it is clear that @xmath115 vanishes at least as fast as @xmath96 as the critical limit is approached .",
    "hence , in the limit the scattering potential splits into two parts , one inside and one outside the horizon .",
    "the outer potential is equal either to that of an extremal reissner - nordstrom black hole ( in the coulomb case ) or that of a black hole with hair ( in the core case ) . because the variation of the outer potential with @xmath96 is smooth in both cases , our conditions on the reflection coefficients are satisfied if we can ignore reflection from the inner part of the potential .",
    "this can be understood by noting that the natural distance variable in which to discuss the motion of the waves is @xmath116 . by integrating eq .",
    "( [ newcoord ] ) inward from some reference point @xmath75 , we obtain @xmath117 the behavior of this integral as the critical limit is approached is very similar to that of the integral in the expression for @xmath99 , eq .  ( [ dt ] ) . for either type of solution",
    ", the region near the quasi - horizon gives a contribution that diverges at least as fast as @xmath118 .",
    "there is a corresponding growth in both the effective distance from the inner portion of the potential to any external point and in the time delay of the corresponding reflected wave .",
    "as @xmath96 is increased , an external observer at fixed @xmath45 first sees the reflections from the inner and outer parts of the potential split into two distinct reflected waves , and then finds that the time delay of the second reflected wave ( from the inner potential ) grows without bound .    the portion of the wave that is transmitted through the region near the quasi - horizon either continues through the origin and then outward or reflects off a central centripetal barrier , according to whether or not @xmath98 vanishes . in either case ,",
    "the time delay accumulated by this wave before it returns to the quasi - horizon grows in essentially the same manner as the travel time for a massive particle traversing the same path : as @xmath118 for a core - solution and as @xmath58 for a coulomb - type solution .",
    "thus , regardless of the type of probe used , an external observer at fixed @xmath119 must wait for at least a time @xmath120 before the probe emerges from the region inside the quasi - horizon . to leading order , this time delay is independent of the energy or angular momentum of the probe , and is instead determined solely by the spacetime geometry .",
    "hence , to an observer with a finite lifetime @xmath121 , the interior region of any near - critical configuration with @xmath122 is inaccessible .",
    "is less than @xmath123 , the the boundary of the inaccessible region depends only very weakly on @xmath121 and @xmath119 , and is essentially indistinguishable from the quasi - horizon . ]",
    "he would most naturally describe any larger system containing this configuration by a density matrix @xmath124 obtained by tracing over the degrees of freedom inside the quasi - horizon .",
    "from this density matrix one can derive an entropy @xmath125 that can be associated with the interior of the quasi - black hole .",
    "one could , of course , proceed in this manner to define an entropy for any arbitrary region in space , just as one can choose to make the information in any subsystem inaccessible by putting the subsystem behind a locked door .",
    "the crucial difference here is that the inaccessibility is due to the intrinsic properties of the spacetime , and that the boundary of the inaccessible region is defined by the system itself rather than by some arbitrary external choice .",
    "it is thus reasonable to define @xmath126 as _ the _ entropy of the quasi - black hole .",
    "a precise calculation of this entropy is clearly infeasible . among other problems",
    ", such a calculation would require a correct implementation of an ultraviolet cutoff , which presumably would require a detailed understanding of how to perform the calculation in the context of a consistent theory of quantum gravity .",
    "as an initial effort , one can take the ultraviolet cutoff as the planck mass @xmath127 and ask for an order of magnitude calculation .",
    "such a calculation was done by srednicki @xcite , who showed that tracing over the degrees of freedom of a scalar field inside a region of flat spacetime with surface area @xmath32 led to an entropy @xmath128 where @xmath129 is the ultraviolet cutoff and @xmath130 is a numerical constant .",
    "furthermore , although the precise calculations depend on the details of the theory , srednicki gave general arguments suggesting that such an entropy should always be proportional to the surface area .",
    "this leads us to expect that @xmath131 .",
    "this result is , of course , consistent with the possibility that in the critical limit @xmath126 goes precisely to the standard black hole result @xmath132 .",
    "however , in contrast with the usual black hole case , our spacetime configurations are topologically trivial .",
    "the `` interior '' region enclosed by the quasi - horizon is nonsingular and static .",
    "furthermore , this region can be unambiguously defined , so that it is conceptually clear what is meant by tracing over the interior degrees of freedom , even though it may not yet be possible to implement this calculation in complete detail .",
    "we find it quite striking that by this approach one can arrive so nearly at the standard entropy result .      in our discussion above of the trajectory of a particle probe",
    ", we focussed on the coordinate time that elapses over the course of the particle s passage through the monopole .",
    "however , it also of interest to consider the elapsed proper time , which can be found by integrating @xmath133 [ see eq .",
    "( [ drdt ] ) ] . for core - type solutions",
    "this gives a finite nonzero result with no unusual behavior as the critical limit is approached .",
    "the situation with coulomb - type solutions is , on the other hand , quite striking .",
    "the sharp decrease in @xmath50 at the quasi - horizon leads to a corresponding decrease in @xmath133 , so that the proper time elapsed while the probe is within the quasi - horizon is also has consequences for the shape of the trajectory through the interior . by combining eqs .  (",
    "[ j ] ) and ( [ drdt ] ) , one finds that in the critical limit all probes follow a straight line passing through the origin , regardless of the incident angle with which they hit the horizon . ]",
    "@xmath134 in the critical limit @xmath50 vanishes identically for @xmath73 , and @xmath135 .",
    "this vanishing of @xmath136 is related to another interesting property of these solutions .",
    "it is well known that the riemann tensor is nonsingular at a black hole horizon .",
    "it therefore does not seem surprising that in the most familiar black hole solutions , the schwarzschild and reissner - nordstrom , a particle suffers no unusual effects as it crosses the horizon .",
    "however , horowitz and ross @xcite showed that this is not always the case .",
    "because of the acceleration of a particle as it approaches the horizon , the components of the riemann tensor in a coordinate frame that is freely falling with the particle can be quite different from the components measured in a static frame . with a metric of the form of eq .",
    "( [ metric ] ) , the components @xmath137 ( where @xmath49 denotes a transverse spatial direction and @xmath138 the time in the boosted frame ) are given by @xmath139\\ , \\label{nakedbh}\\ ] ] where @xmath140 is the energy per unit mass of the infalling particle .",
    "the fact that this curvature component is never large ( with @xmath140 of order unity ) for the schwarzschild and reissner - nordstrom black holes is a consequence of the fact that @xmath50 is constant in both cases .",
    "this is not true in general .",
    "horowitz and ross found several examples of dilaton black holes for which @xmath137 , and thus the tidal forces felt by an infalling particle , could be made arbitrarily large near the horizon by taking the solution to be sufficiently close to extremality .",
    "they introduced the term naked black hole to indicate the fact that this ( almost ) singular behavior occurs outside the horizon .",
    "subsequently @xcite , they showed that in these examples @xmath137 was inversely proportional to the square of the proper time remaining before the particle reached the singularity at @xmath15 .    applying their results to our solutions",
    ", we find that near - critical coulomb - type solutions display naked black hole behavior , even though they are not black holes at all .",

    "i , it is of interest to determine whether systems with either initially nonsingular spacetimes or initially non - extremal black holes can evolve into systems with an extremal horizon .",
    "it appears that under reasonable conditions of finiteness and causality this can not be done by adding charge to an undercharged object @xcite .",
    "the discussion in the previous two sections , however , suggests an alternative . recall that our subcritical monopoles are overcharged ; i.e. , they have a charge larger than their mass . in the normal reissner - nordstrom case , such a system would exhibit a naked singularity .",
    "however , in the monopole the coulomb core is screened by the massive particles in such a way that no gravitational singularity exists .",
    "this suggests a scenario by which an extremal black hole is dynamically formed from a monopole by dropping in uncharged matter .",
    "let us add to our theory a chargeless matter field that is coupled to the monopole fields only through gravity .",
    "we then allow a spherical shell ( of small , but finite thickness ) of this matter fall into the monopole .",
    "if the mass of the shell is sufficiently small , we do not expect a horizon to be formed . on the other hand ,",
    "if the shell contains enough matter , the system should collapse to form a black hole .",
    "it seems plausible that threshold case between these two regimes should produce an extremal horizon .    in the case of a coulomb - type solution",
    ", one might run into difficulties because of the naked - black - hole behavior it exhibits .",
    "this concern , however , should not be an issue for the case of a core - type solution . here",
    "the fields of the critical solution are much better behaved ; what nonanalyticities exist at the horizon are mild , and become increasingly so as one increases @xmath35 . moreover",
    ", nothing unusual happens to the near - critical core - solutions as one parametrically approaches criticality .",
    "adding a small schwarzschild black hole at the center of the self - gravitating monopole should not significantly change the scenario .",
    "the infall of a spherical shell of appropriate mass should still turn the quasi - horizon of a near - critical solution into an extremal horizon .",
    "the black hole would essentially play a spectator role , as its presence is largely irrelevant to the dynamics of the system .",
    "we have carried out numerical simulations to test these ideas .",
    "we begin with a core - type monopole solution that , for numerical convenience , has a small schwarzschild black hole with horizon radius @xmath145 at its center .",
    "the parameters are chosen to be such that the solution is near criticality , so that only a small amount of additional matter is needed for the quasi - horizon at @xmath146 to collapse to a true horizon .",
    "we add to the theory a massive scalar field @xmath147 that is coupled only to gravity .",
    "we then send a spherically symmetric gaussian pulse of @xmath148 field in toward the monopole and watch the system evolve . to simplify the computation , we freeze the matter field variables @xmath30 and @xmath31 at their initial values ; because the fields for near - critical core - type monopoles are not very sensitive to the metric ( cf .",
    "fig  [ fig : big ] ) , this approximation should cause little error .",
    "when the pulse amplitude is larger than some threshold value , the pulse falls into the monopole until the metric function @xmath1 develops a simple zero near the location of the quasi - horizon of the initial monopole configuration .",
    "this newly formed horizon is non - extremal .",
    "more interesting is the situation where the pulse amplitude is at , or just below , this threshold value .",
    "figure  [ fig : t1 ] shows a sequence of snapshots illustrating this scenario at four different points during the pulse s motion inward . as @xmath149 , the horizon of the internal black hole ; this corresponds to using a time variable appropriate to an observer in the interior of the monopole .",
    "if we had used the more conventional normalization with @xmath50 equal to unity at spatial infinity , the time coordinate would be that appropriate to an external observer and would grow rapidly as the pulse approached the quasi - horizon . ]",
    "( the distortion of the pulse is due to the backreaction of the monopole metric . )",
    "[ fig : t1 ]    [ fig : t2 ]    [ fig : t3 ]    as required by birkhoff s theorem , @xmath1 is is undisturbed ahead of the pulse , but undergoes a shift as the pulse passes .",
    "thus , in the region ahead of the pulse @xmath1 is the same as it was in the original configuration , while behind the pulse it has the form corresponding to a static monopole with a central black hole whose horizon radius exceeds @xmath145 by an amount determined by the energy - momentum of the infalling pulse .",
    "these two are joined by a kink at the pulse position . as the pulse passes through the quasi - horizon",
    ", @xmath1 reaches its minimum .",
    "similarly , the plot of @xmath92 appears as nearly a step function centered at the pulse position , with the inner and outer regions corresponding to the initial and final configurations .",
    "the jump in @xmath92 at the pulse position varies with time .",
    "it reaches its maximum when the pulse is passing through the quasi - horizon , and then decreases .",
    "( the resulting variation in the value of @xmath92 at large @xmath45 may appear to violate causality , but is actually a just a consequence of the gauge choice implicit in our choice of coordinates . )    as the pulse continues past the quasi - horizon into the monopole core , the metric function @xmath1 remains static outside the pulse .",
    "however , @xmath150 decreases from its maximum value as the pulse continues inward .",
    "eventually , the pulse bounces off the central black hole ( with a small amount of its energy being absorbed ) and the process reverses itself .",
    "the pulse passes by the quasi - horizon and retreats to infinity .",
    "as it does so , one sees the metric variables restore themselves to almost the original values they had before the insertion of the pulse .    as the initial pulse amplitude",
    "is increased towards its threshold value , the minimum value achieved by @xmath1 approaches zero , while the maximum value of @xmath92 appears to grow without bound .",
    "the time @xmath151 at which the pulse passes through the quasi - horizon does not vary appreciably . at spatial infinity ; @xmath151 would then diverge as the threshold amplitude was approached . ]    a numerical simulation will not , of course , be able to produce a precisely extremal horizon . in our simulations , we have been able to adjust the pulse amplitude to make the minimum @xmath1 be as small as @xmath152 . in analyzing the behavior of the solutions",
    "as the pulse amplitude is varied , we see no indication of any singularity as the threshold is approached .",
    "we therefore expect that a pulse precisely at threshold would produce a nonsingular extremal horizon . in this case of critical collapse , the subsequent evolution of the system would be quite similar to the subcritical case , with the pulse continuing inward , bouncing off the central black hole , and then retreating outward .",
    "however , in this case the spacetime into which it moves is causally distinct from the one where the pulse had originated ; i.e. , it is a new sector of the penrose diagram .    as a final comment , in all this analysis , dropping in pressureless dust should give analogous results .",
    "one can invoke birkhoff s law so that the metric behind the ( radially thick ) dust shell must be represented by a static metric .",
    "but one should expect the same sorts of naked singularity behavior since this results from the interaction of metric variables .",
    "in this paper we have used near - critical self - gravitating monopoles as tools for studying the transition from a nonsingular spacetime to one with a horizon . by analyzing the properties of trajectories that pass through the quasi - horizon and",
    "then emerge again , we have seen that the observations made by an external observer vary continuously and show no evidence of discontinuity when the critical limit is reached .",
    "this analysis also shows how the many causally distinct regions of the extremal black hole spacetime naturally emerge from the simple penrose diagram of the subcritical monopole .",
    "a somewhat unexpected result from this analysis is that for the coulomb - type solutions the proper time required to traverse the interior region vanishes in the critical limit .",
    "this is closely associated with the fact that near - critical coulomb solutions display naked black hole behavior ; these are the first examples of configurations without horizons that do so .",
    "however , the absence of this behavior in core - type solutions shows that this is not a universal property of near - critical solutions .",
    "our analysis also sheds light on some aspects of black holes themselves .",
    "we have seen that the region bounded by the quasi - horizon becomes effectively inaccessible to outside observers when the solution is sufficiently close to criticality .",
    "the interior degrees of freedom thus become unmeasurable .",
    "tracing over them then leads a naturally defined entropy that can be attributed to this configuration .",
    "an order of magnitude estimate of this entropy agrees with the hawking - bekenstein formula for the entropy of a black hole ; it seems plausible that in the critical limit the agreement would be precise .",
    "these nonsingular near - critical solutions thus provide a concrete and unambiguous framework for implementing the old idea that black hole entropy might be understood in terms of the degrees of freedom hidden behind the horizon .",
    "finally , we have argued that an extremal black hole can be produced by allowing additional matter to fall into a near - critical monopole .",
    "we have illustrated this by numerical simulations .",
    "starting with an initially nonsingular monopole , this leads to a zero - temperature black hole where there had previously been no horizon at all .",
    "alternatively , one can start with a small black hole at the center of the monopole . in this latter case",
    ", a configuration with a nonzero hawking temperature evolves into one with @xmath153 .",
    "the existence of these possibilities gives additional clues for , and constraints on , a more precise formulation of the third law of black hole thermodynamics ."
