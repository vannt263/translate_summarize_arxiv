    "irc+10216 is a low mass agb star losing mass at a rate of 2 - 4@xmath410@xmath5 m@xmath6 yr@xmath7 in the form of a molecular and dusty wind that produces an extended circumstellar envelope ( cse ) .",
    "the processes of dredge - up that occurs during this evolutionary late stage alter the elemental composition in the stellar surface ( that is roughly solar , c / o@xmath81 , during the main sequence phase ) resulting , in the case of irc+10216 , in a c / o ratio greater than 1 , in what is known as a carbon star .",
    "the physical conditions in the vicinity of the photosphere of an agb star ( typical temperatures of @xmath92500 k and densities of @xmath910@xmath10 @xmath11 ) make the material to be mainly molecular , with a composition determined by local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) .",
    "it is now well established since the pioneering work of @xcite that the c / o ratio completely determines the kind of chemistry taking place .",
    "the high stability of co makes this molecule to have a large abundance locking almost all of the limiting reactant and allowing for the reactant in excess to form either carbon bearing molecules when c / o@xmath121 , and the opposite , i.e. , oxygen bearing molecules , when c / o@xmath81 .",
    "this has been extensively confirmed by observations .",
    "a look to the list of molecules detected in irc+10216 confirms that they are mostly carbon bearing species ( see table 1 in @xcite and  3 ) . the only oxygen bearing molecule in c - rich agb stars with a significant abundance , apart from co , is sio @xcite .",
    "however , some other o  bearing molecules such as h@xmath0o @xcite , oh @xcite , and h@xmath0co @xcite have recently been detected in irc+10216 .",
    "the existence of such molecules has been interpreted as the result of evaporation of cometary ices from a kuiper belt analog in irc+10216 @xcite .",
    "the luminosity increase of the star , intrinsic to the red giant phase , would have caused the ice sublimation and subsequent release of water vapor to the gas phase in the circumstellar shells .",
    "oh would be produced when water is photodissociated by the interstellar uv field in the unshielded outer envelope and h@xmath0co would be the photodissociation product of an unknown parent molecule produced by sublimation of the ice mantles of these comets .",
    "an alternative explanation has been proposed by @xcite in which h@xmath0o would be produced through fischer - tropsch catalysis on the surface of iron grains , that would be present in the expanding envelope due to condensation from the gas phase of some fraction of the available iron .",
    "fischer - tropsch catalysis breaks the co bond and produces h@xmath0o and hydrocarbons such as ch@xmath13 .",
    "o  bearing species have also been detected in the c - rich protoplanetary nebula crl618 @xcite .",
    "however , the production of these species has been interpreted by @xcite as the result of a rich photochemistry in a region of high density ( @xmath910@xmath14 @xmath11 ) and temperature ( 200 - 300 k ) where large complex carbon - rich molecules are also produced @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to investigate whether oxygen bearing molecules could be produced in the carbon - rich expanding gas of agb stars by non - lte mechanisms .",
    "lte calculations provide a good estimation of molecular abundances in the vicinity of the photosphere but as the gas expands the temperature and density decrease significantly and the chemical timescale increases , making chemical kinetics dominant in determining the molecular abundances .",
    "we describe the model of the circumstellar envelope in  2 . the reaction network is discussed in  3 .",
    "the results of the chemical model are presented in  4 together with comparisons of radiative transfer calculations with available observations .",
    "the conclusions are given in  5 .",
    "we assume spherical symmetry for the circumstellar envelope . in order to calculate the molecular abundances at different radii in the cse",
    ", we follow the history of a volume element of gas with a given chemical composition travelling from the photosphere ( @xmath15=@xmath16 ) to the end of the envelope ( @xmath15@xmath910@xmath17 cm ) .",
    "we build a system of differential equations which integration yields the temporal evolution of the density of each gas species .",
    "the time has to be interpreted as radial position provided the gas travels outwards at a given velocity .",
    "different processes are considered during this travel depending on the position in the cse .",
    "kinetic temperature ( which determines the reaction rate constants ) and total gas density radial profiles are needed to solve the system of equations .",
    "the values adopted for the different parameters used to model the cse are given in table  [ tabl - param ] .    for model purposes the cse",
    "is considered to consist of three different regions : the innermost region , the inner envelope , and the intermediate and outer envelope .",

    "the _ density _ profile is given by hydrostatic equilibrium . considering the above temperature law ,",
    "the gas density can be expressed as follows in terms of the value at @xmath18 , @xmath21 @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath24 is the gravitational constant , @xmath25 the mass of the star , @xmath26 is the mass of a hydrogen atom and @xmath27 the mean molecular weight of gas .    the high densities and temperatures in this region allow to assume that molecular abundances are given by a lte calculation .",

    "is supposed to occur .",
    "radiation pressure on grains , together with momentum coupling of gas and grains , make the gas accelerate up to a terminal expansion velocity which remains constant beyond @xmath33 .",
    "the mechanism responsible for the transport of the gas from @xmath18 to @xmath33 is somewhat controversial .",
    "hydrodynamical models @xcite have shown that pulsational driven shocks can gradually move the gas up to @xmath33 .",
    "@xcite have applied this approach for modelling the chemistry in the inner envelope .",
    "an alternative mechanism could be that the gas close to the photosphere pulsates around an equilibrium position with an associated radial velocity very similar to the escape velocity .",
    "this could lead to a scenario in which shells of gas that are in levitation can eventually escape from the surroundings of the photosphere and some of them could reach @xmath33 .    ",
    "the _ temperature _ profile in this region is given by equation 1 .",
    " for the _ density _ profile we follow the treatment of a shocked extended region of a c - rich cse of @xcite @xmath34 where @xmath35 is defined in @xcite and @xmath29 is explained in the next paragraph .",
    "the reference value @xmath21 is not evident neither from observations nor from models .",
    "previous models of the inner envelope of irc+10216 @xcite have used high values of @xmath21 based on hydrodynamical models for periodically shocked mira - like stars , which have density profiles as an output . however , with such high @xmath21 values , the extrapolation to larger radii produces densities for the outer envelope much higher than those obtained from the law of conservation of mass , in which the absolute density is well determined by the mass loss rate and the expansion velocity ( see equations 5 and 6 in  2.3 ) . to reconcile the outer envelope density law with the high values in the inner regions",
    "we introduce the arbitrary factor @xmath29 in equation 3 .",
    "we consider three different density laws for the inner envelope , shown in fig  [ fig - fis - inn - vcte]a , whose parameters @xmath21 and @xmath29 are given in table  [ tabl - param ] : mi ( i for intermediate density ) ; mh ( h for high density ) , also considered for comparing our results with the previous model of @xcite although it overestimates the density for large radii ; and finally ml ( l for low density ) .",
    "we point out that the chemical time scale strongly depends on the density and also the h / h@xmath0 ratio is completely different in a low or high density situation ( see figs .  [ fig - fis - inn - vcte]b , [ fig - fis - inn - vcte]c and [ fig - fis - inn - vcte]d ) .",
    "we will comment this in  4.1 .",
    "another issue is how the gas travels from @xmath18 to @xmath33 . as discussed above",
    ", different mechanisms could be operating . the simplest assumption to model the chemistry is to consider that the gas travels at constant velocity in this inner envelope .",
    "when using this approach we will assume a velocity of 1 km / s .",
    "+  _ sio condensation onto sic grains_. considering non - lte effects , we investigated whether deposition of si species ( that are specially refractory ) on sic grains could affect the oxygen chemistry because sio is the second more abundant o  bearing molecule .",
    "the scheme for grain formation in irc+10216 could be as follows .",
    "the major type of grains are carbonaceous , most probably amorphous carbon ( a.c . ) as indicated by fitting the ir spectrum @xcite .",
    "these grains would originate in condensation processes involving c@xmath0h@xmath0 ( the most abundant c  bearing molecule after co ) that would take place at @xmath91000 k ( @xmath94 r@xmath36 ) .",
    "a minor type of grains would be sic , as indicated by the 11.3 @xmath27 m feature in the ir spectrum @xcite , that would condense at @xmath91500 k ( @xmath92 r@xmath36 ) .",
    "this condensation sequence is due to an inverse greenhouse effect in both types of grains ( see @xcite for a theoretical approach and @xcite for experimental evidence ) .",
    "although a more correct approach would be a chemical mechanism leading to the formation of grains from gaseous molecules , for our purposes we describe the condensation of sic grains ( a.c .",
    "grains are not considered because we are just interested in deposition of si species on sic grains ) as a two - step process : ( 1 ) _ nucleation _ from sic gas molecules in the context of homogeneous nucleation theory , which is basically described by the nucleation rate @xmath37 ( number of condensation nuclei formed per unit time and unit volume ) ; and ( 2 ) _ growth of grains _ by accretion of gas phase molecules , that is described by the grain radius @xmath38 .",

    "sio condensation _ during the expansion ? .",
    "when we consider such a process in our model , h@xmath0o abundance remains low .",
    "the reason is that , as explained above , h@xmath0o is related to sio in such a way that h@xmath0o becomes abundant when sio does , but not when sio depletes .",
    "then , we consider in model mh ( where sio is formed with a significant abundance ) a speculative process that can be summarized as follows : a sio molecule condenses onto a sic grain and the si atom incorporates into the grain lattice while the o atom is released to the gas phase @xmath140 we assume that 90% of the sio formed in the gas phase is deposited onto sic grains and that all that oxygen , formerly contained in sio , is released to the gas phase as atomic oxygen ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - quim - inn - vcte]e ) .",

    "this atomic oxygen is progressively returned to co during the relaxation time , but also to oh which has an appreciable abundance during these first stages . reaction r11 ( oh+h@xmath0@xmath1h@xmath0o+h ) , which forms water from oh , operates , but at these high temperatures the reverse reaction immediately destroys the h@xmath0o formed , returning oxygen into oh and some time later into co. indeed , shocks are a very good mechanism for dissociating co and releasing atomic oxygen .",
    "this co@xmath1o process occurs preferably during the first shocks due to the high temperatures , which also make the kinetics of the o@xmath1h@xmath0o process fast but , since water is not thermodynamically abundant at high temperatures in a c - rich gas ( it is at low temperatures ) , other reactions are faster and return the atomic oxygen to co.    sio is very affected by the high non - equilibrium chemistry driven by shocks and ends this phase with a very low abundance , mainly due to reaction r8 , which was not included by @xcite .",
    "note that either considering 5 or 15 shocks to reach @xmath33 from @xmath18 , the abundances do not appreciably change .",
    "it is shown that this mechanism decreases rather than enhances oxygen chemistry .    concerning the h / h@xmath0 ratio , shocks favor a large value since h@xmath0 is dissociated in the post - shocked gas ( due to the high temperatures reached ) and depending on the density it can regenerate during the relaxation time via the three body reactions r1 ,",

    "<S> in this paper we study the oxygen chemistry in the c - rich circumstellar shells of irc+10216 . </S>",
    "<S> the recent discoveries of oxygen bearing species ( water , hydroxyl radical and formaldehyde ) toward this source challenge our current understanding of the chemistry in c - rich circumstellar envelopes . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of icy comets surrounding the star or catalysis on iron grain surfaces have been invoked to explain the presence of such unexpected species . </S>",
    "<S> this detailed study aims at evaluating the chances of producing o  bearing species in the c - rich circumstellar envelope only by gas phase chemical reactions . for the inner hot envelope </S>",
    "<S> , it is shown that although most of the oxygen is locked in co near the photosphere ( as expected for a c / o ratio greater than 1 ) , some stellar radii far away species such as h@xmath0o and co@xmath0 have large abundances under the assumption of thermochemical equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> it is also shown how non - lte chemistry makes very difficult the co@xmath1h@xmath0o , co@xmath0 transformation predicted in lte . concerning the chemistry in the outer and colder envelope , </S>",
    "<S> we show that formaldehyde can be formed through gas phase reactions . </S>",
    "<S> however , in order to form water vapor it is necessary to include a radiative association between atomic oxygen and molecular hydrogen with a quite high rate constant . </S>",
    "<S> the chemical models explain the presence of hco@xmath2 and predict the existence of so and h@xmath0cs ( which has been detected in a @xmath3 3 mm line survey to be published ) . </S>",
    "<S> we have modeled the line profiles of h@xmath0co , h@xmath0o , hco@xmath2 , so and h@xmath0cs using a non - local radiative transfer model and the abundance profiles predicted by our chemical model . </S>",
    "<S> the results have been compared to the observations and discussed . </S>"
