    "[ sec1 ]    independent cosmological observations have recently pointed out the existence of a significant fraction of critical density in the form of unclustered matter , possibly characterized by a negative pressure @xcite .",
    "such a component of the cosmic fluid , conventionally denoted dark energy , is believed to drive the accelerated evolution of our present universe , as suggested by the study of the supernovae ia ( snia ) hubble diagram .",
    "while the simplest explanation of the dark - energy component is probably a cosmological constant , it might be neither the most motivated , nor the best fit to the data .",
    "the existence of a ( presently dominating ) dark - energy component raises at least three important questions : _ _ a _ _ ) what is the physical origin of such a new component ? _ _ b _ _ ) why its energy density today is just comparable to the matter energy density ? _ _ c _ _ ) did the acceleration start only very recently in the cosmological history",
    "?    the first question refers to the fundamental physical mechanism able to generate a cosmic and universal dark - energy distribution .",
    "so far , most models of dark energy have adopted a purely phenomenological approach , even if a few proposal concerning the possible role of the dark - energy field in the context of fundamental physics have already appeared @xcite .",
    "the other questions concern two distinct ( although possibly related ) aspects of the so - called `` coincidence problem '' @xcite .",
    "the first aspect refers to the density of the dark - energy and of the dark - matter component . since in most models",
    "the two components have different equations of state , they scale with time in a different way , and their densities should be widely different for essentially all the cosmological history : by contrast , current data are strongly pointing at a comparable proportion of the two components just at the present epoch",
    ".    the second aspect of the coincidence problem may arise if the epoch of accelerated evolution started only very recently , say at @xmath3 .",
    "there are reasons to suspect that this may be the case because , in most models , the growth of structures is forbidden after the beginning of the accelerated expansion , so that the acceleration can not be extended too far into the past .",
    "it has also been recently claimed that the supernova sn1997ff @xcite at @xmath1 provides an additional indication that the acceleration is a relatively recent phenomenon .",
    "a promising approach for a possible simultaneous answer to the above questions has been recently provided by a dilatonic interpretation of the dark energy based on the infinite bare - coupling limit of the superstring effective action @xcite , whose cosmological solutions are characterized by a late - time global attractor where dark - matter and ( dilatonic ) dark - energy densities have an identical scaling with time . a very similar cosmological scenario has been studied also in @xcite .",
    "the respective amount of dark - matter and dark - energy density is eventually determined by the fundamental constants of the model , and it is expected to be of the same order , so that their ratio keeps frozen around unity for the whole duration of such an asymptotic regime . in such a context , the today approximate equality of dark - matter and dark - energy density would be no longer a coincidence of the present epoch , but a consequence of the fact that our universe has already entered the asymptotic regime ( actually , for a region of parameter space allowed by observations , it is also possible that the ratio of dark - energy to dark - matter density is close to unity not only in the asymptotic regime , but already after the equivalence epoch )",
    ". finally , the cosmic field responsible for the observed large - scale acceleration would be no longer introduced _",
    "_ ad hoc _ _ , being identified with a fundamental ingredient of superstring / m - theory models of high - energy physics .",
    "in this paper we will focus our discussion on the possible constraints imposed by structure formation on the above model of dilatonic dark energy , by studying the growth of matter perturbations in the two relevant post - equivalence epochs : a first decelerated epoch , dubbed _ _ dragging phase _ _ , and a second accelerated epoch , dubbed _ _ freezing phase__. we will then reconstruct the behavior of the cosmological gravitational potential , evaluate the sachs - wolfe and integrated sachs - wolfe contributions to the spectrum of cmb anisotropies , and estimate the present level of matter fluctuations ( in particular , the so - called variance @xmath2 , smoothed out over spheres of radius 8 mpc @xmath4 ) .",
    "finally , we will compare it with observations .",
    "the results that we find are interesting , and might help answering the third question posed at the beginning of this section : among the range of parameters compatible with a phenomenologically acceptable @xmath2 we find indeed values allowing a long epoch of acceleration , starting as far in the past as at @xmath0 .",
    "by contrast , the models of dark energy uncoupled to dark matter , with frozen ( or slowly varying ) equation of state , can not accelerate before @xmath3 .",
    "it seems appropriate to anticipate here that the production of an acceptable level of fluctuations even in the case of an early start of the accelerated epoch is due to two concurrent factors : the first is that , during the freezing phase , perturbations do not stop growing like in other models of accelerating dark energy ; the second is that the horizon at equivalence in our model shifts at larger scales with respect to a standard @xmath5cdm model .",
    "it is also important to stress that such an early acceleration is by no means in contrast with the recently observed supernova sn1997ff at @xmath1 .    for the model of dilatonic dark energy considered in this paper the coincidence problem",
    "can thus be alleviated by the fact that the ratio of dark - matter to dark - energy density is of order one not only at present , not only in the course of the future evolution but ( at least in principle ) also in the past , long before the present epoch .",
    "it should be clear , however , that this possibility could be strongly constrained by future observations of supernovae at high redshift .",

    "this result confirms that , as already pointed out in @xcite , a realistic dark - energy scenario seems to require a rather high degree of accuracy in determining the scale of the dilaton potential .",
    "this ( fine - tuning ? ) aspect of the potential is however a common problem of all scalar - field models of dark energy .",

    "this leads to a final distance modulus ( i.e. to a difference of apparent and absolute magnitude ) of @xmath259 mag .    using the definition adopted in @xcite , this result",

    "a negative value of @xmath279 , referred to milne , does not necessarily corresponds to deceleration .    for a more precise illustration of this important point",
    "we have plotted in fig .",
    "3 the distance modulus @xmath279 for the accelerated freezing phase of our dilatonic dark - energy model .",
    "we have numerically integrated the luminosity - distance functions , including baryons , for the two particular values @xmath280 already used in the previous figures ( it may be useful to recall that , when @xmath113 is fixed to @xmath281 , these two values of @xmath116 correspond to @xmath282 and @xmath283 , respectively ) . it can be seen from the picture that , in both cases , the curves representing the cosmic evolution of our model , _ _ although deeply inside the accelerating regime _ _ , remain well within one sigma from the ( lensing - corrected ) sn1997ff data , while providing , at the same time , a reasonable fit of the binned data of all the other supernovae .    , referred to milne s cosmology , for a @xmath284cdm model ( dashed curve ) and for dilatonic dark - energy model during the freezing epoch , for two values of @xmath285 ( thick curves when baryons are included , thin curves without baryons ) .",

    "[ sec5 ]    in this paper we have considered a phenomenological model of dark - energy - dark - matter interactions based on the infinite bare - coupling limit of the superstring effective action .",
    "the dilaton , rolling down an exponentially suppressed potential , plays the role of the cosmic field responsible for the observed acceleration , and drives the universe towards a final configuration dominated by a comparable amount of kinetic , potential and cdm energy density .    the effective dilatonic coupling to dark matter switches on at late enough times ( i.e. , large enough bare coupling ) , and affects in a significant way the post - equivalence cosmological evolution .",
    "the time - dilution of the dark - matter density , in particular , is first slightly enhanced ( during the dragging phase ) and then considerably damped ( during the freezing phase ) with respect to the standard @xmath288 decay law .",
    "the large - angle fluctuation scales relevant to the observed cmb anisotropies reenter the horizon during the dragging epoch , and exit the horizon again during the freezing epoch . in spite of this unconventional evolution",
    ", the growth of the matter - density perturbations may be large enough to match consistently present observations .",
    "the predicted value of the ( smoothed out ) density contrast @xmath6 , compared with data obtained from cluster abundance , defines a significant allowed region in the parameter space of the given class of dilatonic dark - energy models .",
    "the analysis of such an allowed region provides two main results .",
    "the first is that the bounds on the past - time extension of the accelerated ( freezing ) epoch are significantly weaker than in conventional dark - energy models ( uncoupled to dark matter , with frozen equation of state ) .",
    "the establishment of the freezing regime , in our class of dilatonic models , is allowed long before the present epoch ( up to @xmath289 ) , thus providing ( in principle ) a further relaxation of the coincidence problem , by extending the present cosmological configuration not only in the far future , but also towards the past .",
    "the possibility of very early ( @xmath248 ) accelerated evolution is indeed a typical signature of such a class of dilatonic models , useful in principle to discriminate it from other ( uncoupled ) dark energy models , hopefully on the grounds of future observational data .",
    "it is important to stress , to this respect , that the farthest type ia supernova so far observed is at @xmath290 , and is perfectly compatible with an accelerated universe already at that epoch , provided the data of the magnitude - redshift diagram are consistently fitted by the accelerated kinematics of dilatonic models .",
    "the second results concerns the parameters of the ( non - perturbative ) dilaton potential appearing in the strong - bare - coupling regime of the string effective action .",
    "the dilaton mass scale @xmath34 , for an efficient and realistic dark energy scenario , appears in such a context to be tightly anchored to a value very near to the present hubble curvature scale .",
    "a small deviation of @xmath34 from the required value is enough to remove the predictions of the dilatonic model from the region of parameter space allowed by the @xmath6 data .",
    "this means that , under the assumption that the dilatonic models discussed in this paper provide the correct explanation of the observed cosmic acceleration , the measurements of the density contrast @xmath6 , besides their obvious astrophysical importance , would also acquire an interesting high - energy significance for providing an indirect ( parameter - dependent ) measurements of the dilaton mass scale .",
    "we note , finally , that astrophysical observations may provide several additional constraints on dilatonic dark - energy models .",
    "for instance , the clustering evolution of sources at high redshifts may constrain directly the freezing growth exponent @xmath291 ; as already mentioned , the baryon bias that develops during freezing is also observable , at least in principle @xcite ; finally , further constraints can be derived from a computation of the full multipole spectrum of the cmb radiation ( see e.g. @xcite for a recent study of the cmb constraints on coupled dark - energy models with power - law potentials ) .",
    "preliminary results seem to confirm the conclusions of this paper , but a detailed discussion of these new constraints is postponed to a future work ."
