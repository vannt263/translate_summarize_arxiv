    "since stars more massive than @xmath102@xmath8 lack a significant convective envelope , which is a necessary ingredient to drive a solar - type dynamo , magnetic fields are not expected to be observed in these stars .",

    "such a temperature results in the cii 4267  line being about 25 percent deeper , and the uv sed being about 20 percent too large .",
    "carbon abundances as measured from optical lines are poorly studied in bp stars , but are typically found to be underabundant in cooler ap stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "if @xmath167kk is adopted this would suggest that the carbon abundance would need to be reduced by 0.4 dex to fit the observed line depth , but this discrepancy will be somewhat mitigated if we use nlte models , as the cii 4267  line is predicted to be weaker in nlte , which would then increase the abundance necessary to fit the observed profile .",
    "however , adopting a nlte model does not significantly affect the sed and the higher @xmath109 would provide a poorer fit to the uv sed . a future self - consistent analysis that takes into account rapid rotation , nlte effects , and non - solar he abundances",
    "is necessary to remove any ambiguity .",
    "kk , @xmath138@xmath8 , @xmath139@xmath140 ) computed in lte ( dashed red ) and nlte ( dotted green ) . as the @xmath109 is independently constrained by the sed , this implies that hr5907 is a he - strong star.,width=316 ]    from the low - resolution fors and high - resolution espadons circular polarisation measurements , we find that the mean , surface averaged , longitudinal magnetic field values are consistently negative . from the variation of these measurements",
    "we infer a dipolar magnetic field with a @xmath1016 kg field strength at the pole and a magnetic axis nearly aligned with the rotation axis ( @xmath197 ) .",
    "however , direct modelling of the mean lsd profiles of the velocity - resolved stokes  @xmath11 signatures suggests a lower dipole polar field strength of @xmath1010 kg . in any event ,",
    "modelling of the circular polarisation data shows large deviations from the simple dipole model at several rotational phases .",
    "these important deviations may indicate a more complex topology to the magnetic field structure , similar to what is seen in some other magnetic b - type stars .",
    "however , the observed deviations could also be due to the strongly variable helium lines that dominate our mean lsd profiles .",
    "in fact , the lower @xmath96 measurements around phase 0.5 are completely consistent with what is expected if helium is less abundant at the pole and therefore more weighted towards the equatorial regions where the helium lines are stronger . a self - consistent he - abundance and magnetic field map of the stellar surface , similar to hd37776 @xcite , is required to unambiguously determine the magnetic field topology of hr5907 .",
    "comparing the observed lightcurve with the photometric predictions of @xcite , using our inferred inclination and magnetic obliquity , shows the two to be in good qualitative agreement . a lower inclination would not result in a perceivable dip in the lightcurve , unless the magnetic obliquity was about 30or higher . on the other hand ,",
    "if the inclination were higher , we would expect to see two dips in the lightcuve that would require a @xmath101d period ( which would be inconsistent with the variations observed with the @xmath96 measurements ) as opposed to the single dip that we do observe with our @xmath100.5d period .",
    "if the magnetic obliquity was much larger , we would expect to see two dips in the lightcurve , unless the inclination was lower .    as shown in sect .",
    "[ spec_var_sec ] , there appear to be significant chemical abundance variations across the stellar photosphere .",
    "helium appears to have the strongest contrast , with equivalent width variations on the order of 20 percent , which is actually much smaller than observed in other rapidly - rotating he - strong stars such as @xmath13  ori e or hr7355 .",
    "carbon , silicon , and nitrogen are also found to vary weakly . in other he - variable stars the locations of these abundance spots",
    "are correlated with the magnetic field ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and usually axisymetric about the magnetic equator",
    ". therefore the weak helium variability may well reflect the observed magnetic geometry - we are nearly always viewing the same orientation of the magnetic hemispheres and would expect only small rotational modulation since the magnetic axis is nearly aligned with the rotation axis . while the absolute helium variability might be weak compared to other rapidly - rotating he - strong stars , the helium surface distribution may vary enough to cause photometric fluctuations .",
    "the small dip that is evident in the photometric lightcurve ( at about phase 0.65 ) also coincides with a small increase in helium absorption at this phase , as shown in fig .",
    "[ he1_ew ] .",
    "using the stellar parameters as derived in this paper and wind parameters estimated from these stellar parameters ( included in table  [ param_tab ] and obtained using formulae from @xcite and @xcite ) , we find that the wind magnetic confinement parameter @xcite @xmath198 , which indicates that the circumstellar material is strongly confined out to large distances from the star ( @xmath199 ) .",
    "the kepler , or co - rotation , radius @xcite @xmath200@xmath111 , implying that beyond this radius , the material is centrifugally supported .",
    "we find that the locations of the emission peaks in balmer and paschen lines agree well with this value .",
    "we also computed the predicted spin - down time using eq .",
    "( 25 ) of @xcite , @xmath201myr , which is considerably longer than the potential age of hr5907 .    in summary",
    ", this study reports the detection of a large - scale , organised magnetic field with a polar surface intensity of 10 - 16 kg in hr5907 .",
    "interpreted within the context of the orm , we find photometric , h@xmath1 and longitudinal magnetic field variations consistent with a 0.508276d rotational period , making this the shortest period , non - degenerate , magnetic massive star known to date .",
    "we find evidence of surface abundance variations in helium , carbon , silicon , and nitrogen .",
    "this is one of only a few known rapidly - rotating magnetic massive stars that show strong emission variations due to a magnetosphere .",
    "the only other massive star with a comparable rotation period is hr7355 , which is believed to have a magnetic geometry more similar to @xmath13 ori e ( a magnetic obliquity closer to 90 ) , which is very different from this star .",
    "hr5907 is therefore an ideal target for comparison with the predictions of rigidly rotating magnetosphere models @xcite and a great testbed for studying the effects of the magnetic field orientation on angular momentum loss and magnetic spin - down .",
