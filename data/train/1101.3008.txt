    "the first potentially real - life application of the emerging field of quantum information is arguably quantum key distribution ( qkd ) which allows two distant parties to establish a secret key over an _ a priori _ unsecure communication channel @xcite .",
    "the importance of a qkd protocol is usually measured through three main criteria : its _ practicality _ , its _ performance _ and its _ security_.    among all existing protocols , those based on continuous variables appear quite appealing from a _",
    "practical _ point of view @xcite .",
    "for instance , the protocol gg02 @xcite simply requires the preparation of coherent states and their detection via homodyne ( or heterodyne ) detection .",
    "moreover , the _ security _ of this protocol is established against collective attacks @xcite which are optimal in the asymptotic limit @xcite . there",
    "exist different ways to quantify the _ performance _ of a given protocol , but the usual figure of merit is the secret key rate that can be achieved as a function of the distance .",
    "continuous - variable protocols such as gg02 perform quite well for short distances , but seem unfortunately limited to much shorter distances than their discrete - variable counterparts ( see fig . 4 of ref .",
    "@xcite for a comparison of the performance of various protocols ) .",
    "in particular , while discrete - variable protocols allow one to distribute secret keys over distances larger than 100 km , gg02 has only be implemented for a distance of 25 km @xcite and there is not much hope of increasing its range well beyond 50 km @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we introduce continuous - variable ( cv ) qkd protocols which share the practicality and security of gg02 , but greatly improve its performance , especially in terms of achievable distance .    in section [ philosophy ] , we quickly review the status of current cv protocols . in section [ new_schemes ]",
    ", we present the specific modulation schemes of our protocols .",
    "we then introduce the concept of _ decoy states _ for cv qkd protocols in section [ section_decoy ] . in section [ security ] , we prove the security of our protocols against collective attacks and we finally discuss their performance in section [ performance ] .",
    "proving the security of a qkd protocol is usually a difficult task , but the situation is even worse for continuous - variable qkd protocols , because the relevant hilbert space is infinite dimensional .",
    "the task is difficult for ( at least ) one specific reason : the bipartite state @xmath0 shared by alice and bob ( in the entanglement - based version of the protocol ) has an infinite number of degrees of freedom .",
    "this means that a full tomography of this state is hopeless , even in the case of collective attacks , where alice and bob share many copies of the same state .",
    "fortunately , one can take advantage of extremality properties of gaussian states @xcite to show that the eavesdropper s information is upper - bounded by the information she would have if alice and bob shared instead the state @xmath1 , the gaussian state with the same first two moments as @xmath0 @xcite . hence",
    ", knowing the first two moments of the state @xmath0 , that is , a _ finite _ number of parameters , is sufficient to bound eve s information .",
    "furthermore , taking advantage of specific symmetries of the protocols in phase - space @xcite , it is possible to reduce this number to only three , namely the variances of alice and bob s reduced states and the covariance .",
    "that so few parameters are indeed sufficient to bound eve s information is quite remarkable , but it should be noted that this is also a necessity if one wants to take finite - size effects into account .",
    "indeed , it was shown in @xcite that estimating these parameters with a precision compatible with a secret key rate is already very challenging in terms of resources .    because of the constraints imposed by finite - size effects , the only theoretical tool presently available to prove the security of a continuous - variable qkd protocol is therefore this gaussian optimality .",
    "this technique unfortunately comes at a price , namely that if the true quantum state @xmath0 is not sufficiently close to a gaussian state , then the bound on eve s information will not be tight enough to still get secret bits at the end of the protocol . by construction , this bound is indeed only tight for gaussian states , and it turns out that it degrades very rapidly as the non - gaussianity of the state ( and consequently of the protocol ) increases .",
    "this observation leads us to the unavoidable conclusion that with the theoretical techniques available today , protocols using a gaussian modulation ( _ i.e. _ gg02 , possibly with a heterodyne detection @xcite ) are optimal among all continuous - variable qkd protocols , and using any other modulation scheme can only lead to worse performances .",
    "a natural question then arises : why should one consider new protocols involving specific non - gaussian modulations since _ theoretically _ , they can not beat a gaussian modulation ?",
    "the reason is that , _ in practice _ , protocols with a gaussian modulation do not perform as well as expected , especially with regards to long distance communication .",
    "this is due to the fact that error - correction is very hard to implement for a gaussian modulation , thereby making the effective secret key rate drop to zero at distances of the order of 50 km , even if the theoretical key rate is strictly positive .",
    "the protocols we introduce in the present paper outperform previous protocols in terms of maximal range .",
    "this is achieved thanks to a combination of two facts : first , the specific modulation schemes allow one to extract information much more efficiently than with a gaussian modulation ; second , there is a regime ( for the variance of the modulation ) where the protocols are still significantly close to a gaussian protocol , hence making the bound on eve s information tight enough to be useful .",
    "the main argument for switching from a gaussian modulation to a non - gaussian one is _ not _ because it might make the eavesdropping more difficult ( available theoretical tools are not powerful enough to answer this question ) .",
    "the reason is that present coding techniques do not allow for a very efficient reconciliation procedure at ( very ) low signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) when alice s data are gaussian .",
    "remember that a qkd protocol typically consists of three phases : first , alice and bob exchange quantum signal , perform measurements and obtain correlated classical data , say vectors * x * and * y * ; second , in the _ reconciliation _ step , they use classical error correction techniques to agree on a common ( errorless ) bit string * u * , and finally , they apply _ privacy amplification _ to obtain a secure key from * u*.    the importance of the reconciliation phase is specific to continuous - variable protocols for two reasons .",
    "first , one has to deal with continuous values for _ both _ alice and bob s variables instead of bits , which is rather unusual in the field of digital communication .",
    "indeed , even when analog signals are used to transmit information on noisy ( classical ) channels , the modulation is almost always discrete and not continuous .",
    "the second reason is that contrary to discrete - variable qkd protocols where the error rate is always below some small constant ( to guarantee the security of the protocol ) , the snr can be arbitrarily small for continuous - variable protocols ( and is actually very small as one tries to increase the range of the protocol and the transmission of the channel is @xmath2 ( in fiber if @xmath3 is the channel length in kilometers ) , then the snr is roughly given by @xmath4 .",
    "the modulation variance on alice s side , @xmath5 is a free parameter of the protocol which can be optimized for a quantum channel , but numerical simulations show that the optimal value for @xmath5 practically does not depend on the transmission @xmath6 of the channel .",
    "for this reason , the snr is roughly proportional to the transmission of the channel , and is consequently very small for long distances . ] ) .    for continuous - variable qkd protocols ,",
    "information is encoded in phase space , in general in the quadratures of coherent states .",
    "more precisely , if the classical information she wants to send is described by a vector @xmath7 , then alice prepares the @xmath8 coherent states @xmath9 and sends them through the quantum channel .",
    "there are two possibilities concerning the detection : bob can perform either homodyne or heterodyne measurements . in the case of a homodyne detection , for each state , bob chooses randomly which quadrature to measure .",
    "he then obtains an @xmath8-dimensional classical vector @xmath10 and later informs alice of his choices of quadratures . in the case of a heterodyne detection ,",
    "bob ends up with a @xmath11-dimensional vector @xmath10 .",
    "hence , alice and bob share twice as many data for the heterodyne protocol than for the homodyne one .",
    "however , a heterodyne detection adds 3 db of noise to the data , and in practice the performances of both schemes are quite similar .    in order to complete the key distribution ,",
    "two additional steps are required .",
    "first alice and bob proceed with the reconciliation of their classical data in order to agree on a common bit string @xmath12 . here",
    ", we restrict ourselves to a _",
    "reconciliation @xcite , meaning that only bob can send classical information to alice ( in contrast to _ direct _ reconciliation where alice would send some side - information to help bob correct his errors ) .",
    "second , they use privacy amplification in order to obtain a secret key from @xmath12 : this can only be done once they have an upper bound on eve s information about @xmath12 .    in this paper , we consider protocols for which the reconciliation can be performed efficiently ( which is not the case of the protocols using a gaussian modulation ) , and for which eve s information can be bounded if she is restricted to collective attacks .",
    "security against general attacks (  unconditional security \" ) is then obtained in the asymptotic limit , thanks to a de finetti representation theorem for infinite - dimensional quantum systems @xcite .    to be more specific ,",
    "the protocols considered here are characterized as the ones for which the _ reverse _ reconciliation problem can be reduced to the channel coding problem for the binary - input additive white gaussian noise ( bi - awgn ) channel , which can itself be tackled with standard techniques ( efficient error correcting codes ) .",
    "one such protocol is the four - state protocol considered in @xcite , but it turns out that other , more efficient , _ continuous _ modulation schemes are also possible .",
    "let us consider protocols involving a homodyne detection . in this case , the protocols of interest display a discrete modulation with either 2 or 4 states , and a basic problem is how to evaluate the transmission channel , and thereby eve s information .",
    "such a problem does not arise for gaussian modulations , because the variances and covariances directly measured by alice and bob give a covariance matrix , which is all that is needed to characterize the worst possible attack by eve , which is a gaussian attack according to the gaussian optimality theorem . on the other hand , for a non - gaussian modulation , the noises and correlations measured by alice and bob can not be directly connected to a relevant covariance matrix , and the gaussian optimality theorem does not apply directly .    among possible approaches ,",
    "two - state protocols were studied in @xcite , and the authors proved the security of the protocols against any collective attacks , but with the _ caveat _ that a complete tomography of the state was required . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors considered the noises and correlations measured by alice and bob from their non - gaussian modulation , and then considered the gaussian attacks associated with these values as optimal .",
    "however , this approach has the implicit assumption that the transmission channel can be considered as _ linear _ , which means that it is intrinsically characterized by a transmission @xmath6 and an excess noise @xmath13 ( see details in appendix [ linear ] ) .",
    "gaussian channels are obvious examples of linear channels , but a linear channel may also be non - gaussian . since the proofs of @xcite only involve estimating the second moments of alice and bob s correlations , they are compatible with a practical implementation taking into account finite - size effects @xcite , but they are not fully general .    in the present paper , we extend the security proof of discrete modulation protocols against arbitrary collective attacks .",
    "our proof still only requires us to estimate two quantities : the transmission @xmath6 and excess noise @xmath13 of the quantum channel , without carrying out a full channel tomography . but achieving this estimation requires the use of decoy states , as will be explained in section [ section_decoy ] .",
    "since the four - state protocol always outperforms the two - state protocol , we will only discuss the case of the former in the present paper . in this protocol , the modulation consists of four coherent states : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a positive number .",
    "the modulation variance @xmath5 is given by @xmath16 .",
    "the practical implementation of the reverse reconciliation problem for the four - state protocol is discussed in details in appendix [ reduction ] .      before introducing the modulation schemes compatible with a heterodyne detection , let us say a few words concerning the reconciliation procedure .",
    "the main difficulty here lies in the fact that we need a reverse reconciliation .",
    "indeed , the side information sent by bob must help alice without giving eve any relevant information .",
    "the only schemes where side information seems to have these properties ( while being efficiently computable by bob ) are when it describes rotations in particular dimensions , namely dimensions 1 , 2 , 4 and 8 @xcite . this surprising result is a consequence of the fact that the only real division algebras are the real numbers ( @xmath17 ) , the complex numbers ( @xmath18 ) , the quaternions ( @xmath19 ) and the octonions ( @xmath20 ) . indeed",
    ", one can show that the possibility of an efficient reconciliation protocol ( in terms of computation complexity as well as classical communication ) is intimately connected with the existence of a division operation for the data considered .",
    "in particular , identifying vectors in @xmath17 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 or @xmath23 with units of the real numbers , the complex numbers , the quaternions or the octonions allows one to take benefit of the division structure naturally associated with these ensembles .",
    "for instance , the reconciliation protocol of the four - state protocol exploits this property in dimension 1 .",
    "the modulation schemes we consider now exploit it for dimensions 2 , 4 and 8 .",
    "first , note that in the case of the four - state protocol , alice chooses the value of each quadrature uniformly on the ( 0-dimensional ) sphere @xmath24 in dimension 1 .",
    "( this value is then appropriately rescaled to obtain the desired variance of modulation . ) for this reason , we will sometimes refer to the four - state protocol as the 1-dimensional protocol in the rest of the paper .",
    "the modulation schemes we consider now are simply the generalizations to dimensions 2 , 4 and 8 . hence , in the @xmath3-dimensional protocol",
    "( with @xmath25 ) , alice draws random variables uniformly on the sphere @xmath26 in dimension @xmath3 .    for @xmath27 , alice draws @xmath8 points on the unit circle : @xmath28 , and sends the @xmath8 coherent states @xmath29 , where the variables are rescaled by a factor @xmath15 .    for @xmath30",
    ", alice draws @xmath31 points on the sphere",
    "@xmath32 : @xmath33 , and sends the @xmath8 coherent states @xmath34 , where the variables are rescaled by a factor @xmath35 .    for @xmath36 , alice draws @xmath37 points on the sphere @xmath38 : @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and sends the @xmath8 coherent states @xmath41 , where the variables are rescaled by a factor @xmath42 .",
    "the procedure to reduce the reverse reconciliation problem in these three scenarios to the usual problem of channel coding for the bi - awgn channel is explained in detail in appendix [ reduction ] .",
    "let us say a few words about what we mean by _ efficient _ reconciliation procedure in the context of qkd .",
    "usually in the field of computer science , an algorithm is said to be efficient if the amount of resources ( _ e.g. _ running time , randomness generation , classical communication , etc ) it consumes grow at most polynomially with the natural size of the problem . in the case of a reconciliation procedure ,",
    "the problem size is given by the length @xmath8 of the vectors alice and bob try to agree on .",
    "as @xmath8 usually takes very large values ( for instance @xmath43 or @xmath44 ) , an algorithm requiring resources scaling as @xmath45 or @xmath46 is obviously unacceptable : only a linear scaling is compatible with a practical implementation .",
    "moreover , the factor of proportionality should be small enough . for @xmath47 or 8 , the reconciliation procedure introduced in @xcite",
    "requires that bob draws one random bit and transmits classically one real number to alice per exchanged signal .",
    "the computational complexity of the protocol ( not including the decoding of the error correcting code ) is linear with @xmath8 . for values of @xmath3",
    "strictly greater than 8 , the naive approach ( which consists in drawing random transformations uniformly in the orthogonal group @xmath48 and transmitting them to alice ) requires that bob draw @xmath3 random variables from a normal distribution ( instead of only 1 bit ) and to send @xmath3 real values to alice for each exchanged quantum signal , which is prohibitive for a realistic implementation .",
    "it should be emphasized that the higher the dimension , the higher the secret key rate of the qkd protocol .",
    "the reason for this is the very specific technique that we use to bound eve s information .",
    "our bound depends only on the covariance matrix of alice and bob s bipartite state in the entanglement - based version of the protocol , and therefore is tight only when the state is gaussian .",
    "fortunately , if the state is almost gaussian , then the bound is good enough for our purpose .",
    "because of this , we want to use a protocol as gaussian as possible .",
    "it turns out that considering modulations in higher and higher dimensions brings us closer and closer to the gaussian modulation for which the bound is tight .",
    "indeed , a gaussian modulation of variance 1 can be seen as drawing uniformly a random point of the sphere of radius @xmath49 in @xmath50 as @xmath3 tends to infinity .",
    "hence , the gg02 protocol with a gaussian modulation can be seen as the @xmath3-dimensional protocol with @xmath51 .",
    "unfortunately , for @xmath51 , efficient reconciliation techniques at low snr are not known .",
    "as we already mentioned , it is crucial that the security proof of cv qkd protocols requires the estimation of only a few parameters .",
    "ideally , one would like a gg02-type security proof where only the transmission @xmath6 and the excess noise @xmath13 of the quantum channel need to be estimated .    as we will discuss in section [ security ] , the security proof of our protocols indeed relies on the fact that one can estimate the covariance matrix of alice and bob s bipartite state in the entanglement - based version of the protocol .",
    "a difficulty lies in the fact that alice and bob do not perform the entanglement - based version of the protocol ( in which case the covariance matrix is directly accessible in the experiment ) but use instead the _ prepare and measure _ version .",
    "hence , if alice encodes the variable @xmath52 in the quadrature of a state and bob obtains the result @xmath53 when measuring this quadrature , they can estimate the three following moments of order 2 : alice s variance @xmath54 , bob s variance @xmath55 and the covariance @xmath56 . whereas alice and bob s variance in the prepare and measure scenario are directly related to the respective variances in the entanglement - based scenario ,",
    "the same is not true for the covariances .",
    "there are two cases where the covariance matrix in the prepare and measure protocol allows one to recover the covariance matrix of the state in the entanglement - based scenario , namely when the quantum channel is linear ( see appendix [ linear ] ) , for instance a gaussian channel , and when the modulation is gaussian .    in refs .",
    "@xcite , the security of the protocols considered in the present paper was established in the case of linear channels . here",
    ", we wish to get rid of this hypothesis ( which can never be perfectly verified in practice with a finite number of samples ) , and for this reason , it is necessary to use a gaussian modulation for the parameter estimation procedure .",
    "unfortunately , it is not _ a priori _ possible to use two different modulations for key distribution and parameter estimation , because an eavesdropper could use a different strategy in each case .",
    "the solution is to add a _ third _ modulation consisting of decoy states .",
    "let us call `` key '' , `` decoy '' and `` g '' the modulations corresponding respectively to states used for the key distillation , decoy states and states used for parameter estimation purposes ( a gaussian , in fact thermal , distribution ) .",
    "one can define the three following states : @xmath57 where @xmath58 for the @xmath3-dimensional protocol .",
    "( in particular , @xmath59 refers here to @xmath60 coherent states . ) in these expressions , the probability distribution @xmath61 is the uniform measure of the sphere @xmath26 ( with radius @xmath62 ) and @xmath63 is the gaussian distribution @xmath64 in @xmath3 dimensions . in other words",
    ", @xmath61 corresponds to the modulation schemes described in section [ new_schemes ] , and @xmath63 is the gaussian distribution of the gg02 protocol .    if the probability distribution @xmath65 is chosen such that @xmath66 where @xmath67 is a weight between 0 and 1 , then the state sent by alice to use for parameter estimation is indistinguishable from that used to distill a key ( or as a decoy ) .",
    "the idea is that after the exchange of quantum states is complete , alice can announce to bob which states he can use for the key , which states he can discard ( decoys ) and which states should be used for parameter estimation .    if in principle , the form of @xmath68 does not matter ( it could be any state , not necessarily of the form [ decoy_def ] ) , this is no longer true if we require the protocol to be practical .",
    "indeed , for this reason , we impose the extra constraint that @xmath68 should be obtained as a mixture of coherent states , _",
    "i.e. _ be of the form [ decoy_def ] .",
    "we discuss this in details in appendix [ decoys_coherent ] where we describe two techniques for finding the appropriate decoy states .",
    "to summarize , the modulation that is used in the protocols is a mixture of three particular modulations .",
    "let us note @xmath69 the fraction of states that alice and bob want to use for parameter estimation purposes ( this fraction can be optimized numerically but in a typical scenario , its value can be around 50 @xmath70 ) .",
    "then for each state she sends , alice will choose either the modulation @xmath71 with probability @xmath72 or modulation @xmath73 with probability @xmath69 or send a decoy state with probability @xmath74 .",
    "in this paper , we restrict ourselves to the case of collective attacks since they are optimal in the asymptotic limit @xcite .",
    "the ( asymptotic ) secret key rate @xmath75 is then given by @xcite : @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the reconciliation efficiency , @xmath78 is the classical mutual information between alice and bob s data ( for the data corresponding to the modulation @xmath71 ) and @xmath79 is the holevo quantity : @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the von neumann entropy , @xmath53 is bob s measurement result obtained with probability @xmath82 , @xmath83 is the corresponding state of eve s ancilla and @xmath84 is eve s partial state .    note that this rate should be modified to take finite - size effects into account .",
    "for simplicity , we only consider the asymptotic rate here , but a complete analysis of finite - size effects can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "since the quantity @xmath85 is directly observable in practice , the goal of the security proof consists in deriving an upper bound for the quantity @xmath79 which should be a function of parameters accessible in an experiment . in our case , we will find a bound which only depends on three parameters : the variance of modulation @xmath5 which is chosen by alice , the transmission @xmath6 and the excess noise @xmath13 of the quantum channel which can be estimated with the technique described in ref .",
    "@xcite .",

    "we use the superscript 0 to denote states before the quantum channel .",
    "moreover , the action of the quantum channel can be described by a map @xmath86 where the identity acts on the first part of the state ( namely , alice s state ) and the quantum channel @xmath87 acts non - trivially only on the second part of the state .",

    "for this , we do not need to make any assumption ( for instance of linearity ) concerning the quantum channel .",

    "the last part of the argument consists in proving that the covariance matrix @xmath105 has the same form ( or at least can be safely considered to have the same form ) as @xmath100 after the quantum channel , if one simply replaces @xmath115 by @xmath111 : @xmath120    this is clear if the quantum channel @xmath87 is linear , for instance gaussian but the argument is more involved in the case of an arbitrary quantum channel .",

    "the parameter estimation is performed in such a way that there are no privileged direction in phase space . however , this is formally not enough to warrant that eve s attack has the same symmetry .",
    "we therefore provide the following two strategies : either one assumes that the symmetry is not broken by eve ( which in theory could be checked by performing a tomography of the state ) , or one does not want to make such an assumption and prefers to actively symmetrize the protocol .    in the first scenario , under the assumption",
    "that the symmetry of the quantum channel is not broken , the security protocol with decoy states presented here is at least as good as in the case where the channel is linear . indeed",
    "the quantum state shared by alice and bob is invariant under the group of conjugate passive symplectic operations applied on alice s @xmath8 modes and bob s @xmath8 modes , which means that their state can be safely considered to be gaussian if the analysis is restricted to collective attacks @xcite .",

    "the goal of this section is to explain how an efficient reconciliation can be achieved for the various modulation schemes considered in this article , for arbitrarily low snr .",
    "reconciliation in a qkd protocol is very similar to the problem of channel coding ( that is , transmitting information efficiently and reliably on a noisy communication channel ) with the additional constraint that the input of the channel is not chosen by alice but instead randomly picked from a given probability distribution corresponding to the modulation scheme . in particular ,",
    "the usual task is the following : alice and bob are given two @xmath8-dimensional real vectors @xmath148 and @xmath10 and their goal is to agree on a common bit string @xmath149 .",
    "a supplementary constraint when dealing with reverse reconciliation is that @xmath149 should be a function ( possibly randomized ) of @xmath10 , and that all public communication should be from bob to alice .",
    "there exists a standard technique for reducing the problem of reconciliation to the one of channel coding , namely coset coding introduced by wyner @xcite .",

    "this simple technique allows one to obtain good error correcting codes of arbitrarily low rate ( see chapter 5.2 of ref .",
    "@xcite for more details concerning this concatenation technique ) .",
    "in the entanglement - based version of the protocol , one has to apply the generalized measurements @xmath98 . in the prepare and measure scenario , it is therefore necessary for alice to send states which are compatible with these measurements .",
    "the states corresponding to the operator @xmath99 are not a problem , since by construction , they correspond to the modulation used to distill the key , that is , coherent states drawn uniformly on the sphere in @xmath3 dimensions .",
    "the states corresponding to the operator @xmath102 might be a little bit more problematic in the sense that they are not usually easy to produce experimentally .",
    "ideally , one would like to be able to produce these states simply by modulating coherent states ( which are the only states simple enough to allow for a realistic qkd protocol ) .",
    "in particular , if alice applies the measurements @xmath98 , then one obtains the following relation : @xmath179 with @xmath180 . however , in this case , the state @xmath68 does not have a positive @xmath181-function , meaning that it can not be obtained as a mixture of coherent states .",
    "we now present two different techniques to deal with this problem : either one replaces @xmath92 with a noisy version ( see appendix [ noisy ] ) or one relaxes equation [ def_decoy ] and considers instead an approximate version of the decoy states ( see appendix [ optimization ] ) .",
    "let us consider the prepare and measure version of the @xmath3-dimensional protocol . in this case",
    ", the gaussian modulation can be seen as sending @xmath60 coherent states @xmath182 such that the random variables @xmath183 are independent and identically distributed centered normal variables . without loss of generality , we consider variables with variance @xmath184 .",
    "taking advantage of the rotational invariance of the gaussian distribution , one can equivalently choose the random vector @xmath185 by first picking uniformly a random point of the unit sphere @xmath26 in @xmath3 dimensions , and drawing the radius @xmath186 of the vector @xmath187 from a chi distribution with @xmath3 degrees of freedom .",

    "the first approach we investigate aims at satisfying equation [ def_decoy ] exactly while allowing for a positive ( and non - negligible ) probability @xmath67 of sending a signal state .",
    "this is done by considering slightly noisy versions of the true signal modulation",
    ".    in particular , one chooses two parameters @xmath193 $ ] and @xmath194 and defines the states used for key distillation as the ones with a radius bounded by these two parameters : @xmath195 .",
    "the decoy states then simply correspond to the remaining states .",
    "provided that @xmath196 and @xmath197 are close enough to 1 , the penalty imposed by this noise , compared to the ideal case where the key modulation is strictly equal to 1 , is negligible in terms of reconciliation efficiency .    on the other hand , one should not choose values too close to 1 , otherwise the probability @xmath67 that a given state can be used for key distillation will be very small : @xmath198    hence , optimizing the values of @xmath196 and @xmath197 should be seen as a tradeoff between the penalty imposed on reconciliation efficiency and the probability that a given state can be used for key distillation .",
    "note also that with this approach , the state @xmath192 is not longer described as in appendix [ covariance ] .",
    "in particular , the covariance matrix of the new state is a little bit different from the one presented in appendix [ covariance ] .",

[ gamma_key ] .",
    "we now give a second approach to the problem of approximating decoy states with coherent states .",
    "our goal is still to achieve the following equality : @xmath199 but this time , without considering a noisy version of @xmath200 .",
    "if one chooses @xmath180 as defined in appendix [ measurement ] , then the state @xmath68 does not have a positive @xmath181-function , meaning that it can not be obtained as a mixture of coherent states .",
    "fortunately , @xmath181-functions can be regularized rather well , and for our purpose , it is sufficient to find a state @xmath68 with a non negative @xmath181-function such that equation [ def_decoy2 ] only holds _",

    "[ approx ] holds and alice uses the modulation @xmath201 for the decoy states , then the probability that eve can distinguish the states used for key distillation from the ones used for parameter estimation is upper bounded by @xmath203 .    here , we do not give a solution for the problem of finding the best distribution @xmath181 compatible with a success probability @xmath67 and the error @xmath203 , but we point out that the usual optimization tools ( for instance the optimization toolbox of matlab ) allow one to find very good instances of @xmath181 . for example , for the 2-dimensional protocol and @xmath204 , we could obtain a value of @xmath203 less than @xmath205 for @xmath206 with a distribution @xmath181 corresponding to a sum of 6 dirac distributions , that is a mixture of 6 particular coherent states .",
    "the natural question that arises here is how good should the approximation be ? is a trace distance equal to @xmath205 sufficient to guarantee a reasonable level of security ? or should one aim for a value of @xmath207 ?",
    "note that if the approximation is not perfect , it means that eve might have a ( very ) small probability to distinguish between the states used for the key distillation and those used for parameter estimation .",
    "however , discriminating between these two modulations does not appear to be a good solution for eve as this would induce a lot of phase noise in the signal : indeed , because all the modulations considered here are phase - invariant , the optimal discrimination procedure consists in projecting the states onto fock states , thereby erasing all the phase information .",

    "if we consider here for @xmath313 the group of conjugate passive symplectic operations applied on alice s @xmath8 modes and bob s @xmath8 modes ( in phase space , such operations are simply conjugate orthogonal transformations ) , then for a given operation @xmath320 applied to the state , the map @xmath315 is obtained by applying the orthogonal transformations corresponding to @xmath320 on the classical data measured by alice and bob . if the protocol is invariant under this whole group , then it is sufficient to look at gaussian states to prove security against collective attacks @xcite . in the prepare and measure version of the protocol , this group becomes the orthogonal group @xmath321 .",
    "one simple way to ensure that a protocol is indeed invariant under a set @xmath313 of transformations is for alice and bob to actively apply random transformations of @xmath313 to their states .    in particular , if alice and bob both apply random orthogonal transformations to their classical vectors in the prepare and measure protocol , then the security analysis can be done assuming that they share a gaussian state in the entangled version of the protocol .    for our security proof ,",
    "the goal of the symmetrization is to make sure that the state shared by alice and bob is as isotropic as possible .",
    "indeed , remember that we need to estimate the covariance matrix of the state shared by alice and bob after alice s generalized measurement @xmath98 .",
    "the only problem that could potentially happen would be that eve guesses which states might be used for key distillation and which ones might be used for parameter estimation and that she manages to somehow play with alice and bob s correlations in order to fool them into overestimating their correlations .",
    "to totally prevent such a ( quite unrealistic ) scenario , it is sufficient to symmetrize the state so that there are no privileged directions in phase space that eve could exploit .",
    "hence , in practice , the symmetrization does not require to apply random conjugate passive symplectic operations chosen with the uniform measure over the whole set of such operations : a smaller subset should be efficient . a very conservative quantitative criterium to evaluate",
    "the quality of such a set would be for instance the distance between the partial trace of @xmath322 once we trace out @xmath323 modes and the gaussian state with the same first two moments .      to make sure that the protocol is indeed invariant under specific transformations",
    ", we apply an active symmetrization step to the state @xmath0 before applying the protocol .",
    "the transformations we consider are conjugate passive symplectic operations applied on alice s @xmath8 modes and bob s @xmath8 modes , which therefore correspond to orthogonal transformations applied to their classical vectors in the prepare and measure protocol . for simplicity , we restrict the discussion to this prepare and measure scheme in the following .",
    "the active symmetrization requires us to choose a subset @xmath324 of the orthogonal group and for alice and bob , and to apply the same element @xmath325 ( chosen uniformly at random ) to their data before starting the postprocessing . as we stressed above , taking for @xmath324",
    "the whole orthogonal group is not necessary in practice .",
    "hence , we want @xmath324 to be a subset of the orthogonal group with the following properties : drawing a random element @xmath150 from the uniform measure on @xmath324 should be doable with resources ( time and alea generation ) scaling at most linearily in @xmath8 , the description of @xmath150 should also be at most linear in @xmath8 and applying @xmath150 ( or @xmath326 ) to a random vector of @xmath327 should also be at most linear in @xmath8 .",
    "these conditions ensure that the protocol with the active symmetrization remains practical .",
    "moreover , the symmetrization should work as well as possible , meaning that @xmath324 should symmetrize the state as much as possible .",
    "we give examples of such possible subsets @xmath324 in the next subsection .",
    "let us describe a recursive algorithm that allows one to draw an orthogonal transformation with the haar measure on @xmath328 .",
    "if we assume that we already drew a random transformation @xmath329 from the haar measure on @xmath330 , then let us note @xmath331 the orthogonal transformation in @xmath328 acting as the identity on the first element of the canonical basis of @xmath327 and as @xmath329 on the last @xmath323 elements of the basis .",
    "then , let us draw uniformly at random a unit vector @xmath332 on the sphere @xmath333 and define the following householder reflection @xmath334 : @xmath335 note that drawing @xmath332 can be done in linear time simply by drawing @xmath8 random normal variables and normalizing the obtained vector . also , applying @xmath334 to any vector can be done in linear time in @xmath8 .",
    "finally , one can show that random orthogonal transformation @xmath336 follows the haar distribution of @xmath328 @xcite .",
    "in particular , one has : @xmath337 where one defines @xmath338 .",
    "hence , drawing , describing and applying a random orthogonal transformation from @xmath328 are tasks with complexity quadratic in @xmath8 .",
    "we define the subset @xmath339 of the orthogonal group as corresponding to the set of compositions of @xmath280 such householder reflections , that is the last @xmath280 steps of the algorithm described above .",
    "for instance , @xmath340 corresponds to the set of householder reflections with respect to a hyperplane of @xmath341 , and @xmath342 is the orthogonal group @xmath328 .",
    "one can also define a family of measures @xmath343 on @xmath328 corresponding to the uniform measures of @xmath344 .",
    "a complete symmetrization would imply performing orthogonal transformations on both alice and bob s data chosen randomly with the measure @xmath345 , but for all practical purposes , it seems that @xmath346 already provides a high level of symmetrization .",
    "we present here two different schemes , depending on the choice of modulation which can be either fully gaussian or consists of a non - gaussian modulation supplemented by appropriate decoy states .",
    "the former modulation is compatible with both a homodyne or a heterodyne detection and corresponds to the technique detailed in appendix [ noisy ] while the latter , which is more efficient in terms of resources , is only compatible with a heterodyne detection ( and is detailed in appendix [ optimization ] ) .",
    "these schemes include the active symmetrization introduced in appendix [ active ] .",
    "* alice draws @xmath11 random variables @xmath347 from a centered normal distribution with the appropriate variance . these form a vector @xmath348 . *",
    "alice sends the states @xmath349 to bob , with @xmath350 .",
    "* bob receives the states after the quantum channel and measures them , with either a homodyne detection or a heterodyne detection . in the case of a heterodyne detection",
    ", he obtains a @xmath11-dimensional vector @xmath53 . in the case of a homodyne detection",
    ", he obtains an @xmath8-dimensional vector @xmath53 , then informs alice about his choices of measured quadratures ( @xmath52 or @xmath67 for each state ) ; alice only keeps the relevant coordinates in her data in order to form a new @xmath8-dimensional vector @xmath52 . *",
    "alice randomly draws a random orthogonal transformation @xmath351 from the orthogonal group @xmath321 ( or @xmath328 for a homodyne detection ) . in theory , to achieve a perfect symmetrization of the state , alice should draw @xmath351 with the haar measure on @xmath321 .",
    "however , in practice , @xmath351 can be chosen uniformly in a well - chosen subset of @xmath321 which has the advantage of allowing for efficient descriptions of its elements , such as one of the measures @xmath352 defined in appendix [ active ] . *",
    "alice describes @xmath351 to bob through the classical communication channel , and both parties apply @xmath351 to their respective vector , hence obtaining @xmath353 and @xmath354 . *",
    "alice chooses randomly @xmath355 coordinates that are used for parameter estimation . *",
    "the next step is where lies the novelty of our protocols .",
    "for instance , in the so - called four - state protocol , alice considers the coordinates @xmath356 which were not used for parameter estimation and keeps only the ones such that @xmath357 is sufficiently close to a predetermined value . in the case of the eight - dimensional protocol ( with heterodyne detection for instance ) , alice divides her data into blocks of size 8 and keeps the blocks for which the euclidean norm is close to a predetermined value ( see appendix [ noisy ] for details ) .",
    "alice informs bob of the indices that she keeps .",
    "the rest of the data are discarded . at this point ,",
    "alice and bob have classical correlations for which an efficient reconciliation protocol is available ( see appendix [ reduction ] ) .",
    "* alice draws @xmath8 8-dimensional random vectors , each chosen from one of the three following distributions : random vectors on the 7-dimensional sphere with the appropriate radius ( these data correspond to the non - gaussian modulation which will be used for the key distillation ) , random vectors on the 7-dimensional sphere with an appropriately fluctuating radius ( these are the decoy states which will be discarded at the end of the protocol : the mixture of these states with the previous ones should be indistinguishable from a true gaussian distribution ) or gaussian vectors which are used for parameter estimation .",
    "alice hence obtains an @xmath358-dimensional vector @xmath52 for which each subset of length 8 corresponds either to legitimate information , decoy data that will be discarded or data used for parameter estimation . *",
    "alice randomly draws a random orthogonal transformation @xmath351 from the orthogonal group @xmath359 . in theory , to achieve a perfect symmetrization of the state , alice should draw @xmath351 with the haar measure on @xmath359 .",
    "however , in practice , @xmath351 can be chosen uniformly in a well - chosen subset of @xmath321 which has the advantage of allowing for efficient descriptions of its elements , such as one of the measures @xmath352 defined in appendix [ active ] . *",
    "alice computes the vector @xmath360 , which is the image of @xmath52 by the orthogonal transformation @xmath351 and uses this vector for her modulation .",
    "hence she sends the states @xmath361 to bob , with @xmath362 .",
    "* bob receives the states after the quantum channel and measures them , with a heterodyne detection .",
