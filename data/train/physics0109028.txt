    "recent realizations of two@xcite and three@xcite component alkali bose - einstein condensates ( bec s ) in a trap provide us with new systems to explore the physics in otherwise unachievable parameter regimes .",
    "dramatic results have recently been observed in the phase segregation dynamics of mixtures of rb@xcite and na@xcite gases .",
    "periodic spatial structures were found at intermediate times which then recombine at a later time .",
    "phase segregation phenomena have been much studied in materials science and these can be understood using _",
    "classical mechanics_. spatial modulations have also been observed , for example , in alnico alloys.@xcite these were explained in terms of a concept called spinodal decomposition.@xcite when a system is quenched from the homogeneous phase into a broken - symmetry phase , the ordered phase does not order instantaneously . instead ,",
    "different length scales set in as the domains form and grow with time .",
    "for the bec s , however , _ quantum mechanics _ play an important role .",
    "it has been shown@xcite that it is possible to have an analogous spinodal decomposition , which manifests some of the phenomenology including a periodic spatial structure at an intermediate time that is now determined by quantum mechanics .",
    "the time scale provides for a self - consistent check of the theory and is consistent with the experimental results.@xcite the growth of domains at later times is now determined by quantum tunneling and not by classical diffusion .",
    "recently , it became possible@xcite to cool a single component system of about a million @xmath2k fermionic atoms in a magnetic trap below the fermi temperature , @xmath3 , leading to the realization of a spin - polarized fermion gas of atoms .",
    "similar to electrons in a solid , the dilute gas of atoms fills all the lowest energy states below the fermi energy , @xmath4 .",
    "the transition to this quantum degenerate state is gradual as compared to the abrupt phase transition into a bose condensate .",
    "for single component fermionic systems , however , the equilibrium is difficult to achieve as the @xmath5-wave elastic collisions are prohibited due to pauli exclusion principle . in the experiments of demarco and jin@xcite , this was circumvented by using a mixture of two nuclear spin states of @xmath2k atoms for which @xmath6-wave collisions are allowed .",
    "one of the manifestations of quantum mechanics was the nature of momentum distribution which differed from the well known classical gaussian distribution .",
    "this system corresponds to the weak coupling limit in which the physical properties are close to those of a non - interacting fermion gas .",
    "the other system which is being explored@xcite is the gas of @xmath7li atoms .",
    "mixtures of fermions interating with the coulomb interaction have been studied in the context of the electron - hole fluids@xcite . for fermions mixtures on a lattice site interacting with the hubbard hamiltonian , the * partial * phase segregation leads to antiferromagnetism .",
    "thermodynamic properties as well as density and momentum distributions of spin - polarized fermionic gas of atoms in a harmonic trap have been studied in recent years@xcite .",
    "butts and rokhsar@xcite have obtained universal forms of the spatial and momentum distributions for a single component spin - polarized non - interacting fermion gas using the thomas - fermi ( tf ) approximation , whereas schneider and wallis@xcite have studied the effects of shell closure for small number of atoms , similar to the nuclear shell model .",
    "bruun and burnett@xcite have studied an interacting fermion gas of @xmath7li atoms which have a large negative scattering length .",
    "such an interaction could also lead to the possibility of superfluid state@xcite in these systems . in the present paper",
    ", we consider mixtures of these new finite systems of ultracold fermionic atoms with a positive scattering length in the limit of both weak and strong coupling and explore the equilibrium and non - equilibrium quantum statistical physics using the tf approximation , monte carlo simulations , and the random phase approximation .    in section",
    "ii we present the equilibrium static properties of mixtures of fermionic atoms in different parameters regimes using both the tf and the monte carlo simulations . in section iii , we study the dynamics of phase segregation of such mixtures using a linear stability analysis .",
    "finally , conclusions will be presented in section iv .",
    "we first start with the statics of a two component fermion gas of atoms with masses @xmath8 and @xmath9 and particle numbers @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "this is assumed to be confined in an azimuthally symmetric harmonic trap with radial and axial frequencies @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively which are considered to be the same for both the components .",
    "unlike the electron gas in matter , the fermion gas of atoms is neutral and dilute .",
    "therefore , significant interactions between atoms are only short - ranged and that would be responsible for any phase segregation in the system . in the long wavelength limit , the system can be well described by the density functional theory and the total energy can be written as    @xmath14 { \\rm d}{\\bf r}.\\ ] ]    here @xmath15 is the non - interacting part of the energy density and @xmath16 is the particle density of the component @xmath17 with @xmath18 .",
    "the interaction term has been approximated by the contact potential @xmath19 .",
    "@xmath20 is related to the scattering length @xmath21 by @xmath22 , with @xmath23 . in accordance with the experiments , we take @xmath21 to be positive and consider only the @xmath6-wave scattering . therefore , the contribution to the interaction term is non - zero only when the species are different or are in different hyperfine states as in experiments . from the pauli exclusion principle , there is no contact interaction between particles of the same species ( spin ) . in a more general treatment including @xmath24-wave scattering there would be additional terms involving interaction between identical species also .",
    "but these are small , and thus neglected .    for the kinetic energy density @xmath25 we use a local approximation",
    "including the first and second derivatives of the particle density , @xmath26    the first term represents the thomas - fermi ( tf ) approximation to the kinetic energy .",
    "the second term is @xmath27 and represents the gradient correction to the kinetic energy .",
    "the integral of the third term extended to infinity vanishes , and thus it will not be included in the calculations .",
    "the monte - carlo results confirm that the gradient term is at least 2 orders of magnitude smaller than the tf term , but this term is important in that it can break the symmetry of the ground state and lead to asymmetric states with a lower energy .    without the interaction term in ( 1 ) , the system behaves in the same fashion as the one component system for which butts and rokhsar@xcite obtained @xmath28 to be related to the total particle number @xmath29 by @xmath30 . defining @xmath31 ( giving the characteristic size of the gas ) , and @xmath32 ( momentum of a free particle of energy @xmath28 ) , they calculated the density profile at t=0 to be given by @xmath33^{3/2 } ,   \\label{rho0}\\ ] ] with @xmath34 , @xmath35 . in the tf approximation",
    ", the trapping potential can be treated to be locally constant and we can define a local fermi wavevector , @xmath36 so that @xmath37 , and the density at t = 0 can also be written as @xmath38 .",
    "we now examine the properties of the mixed ( two - component ) interacting system and will show how the repulsive interaction modifies this non - interacting density profile as well as other properties of the system .",
    "the strength of the coupling , which controls the phase segregation , depends on the dimensionless parameter which is the ratio between the interaction and the kinetic energies , namely @xmath39 $ ] . in the simple case of equal masses ( @xmath40 ) and densities ( @xmath41 ) of the two components ,",
    "this simply scales as @xmath42 .",
    "this means that the coupling would be stronger if @xmath21 or the density is large . also as @xmath28 is proportional to the frequency of the trap at constant @xmath29 ( a higher frequency leads to a larger separation between the levels )",
    ", the coupling would be large for higher frequencies .",
    "from now on , to measure the strength of the interaction , we will use the dimensionless parameters @xmath43 , where @xmath44 , or in the case of equal chemical potentials , just @xmath45 .",
    "for a general two - component system with chemical potentials @xmath46 and @xmath47 , the ground state is obtained by minimizing the thermodynamic potential @xmath48 .",
    "this leads to the following system of equations:@xmath49 + ( { \\frac{1 } { 2 } } m_1 \\omega^2 { \\bar r}^2 - \\mu_1 + g \\rho_2 ) = 0 \\\\ \\frac{\\partial \\omega}{\\partial \\rho_2({\\bf r } ) } & = & \\frac{\\hbar ^2}{2m_2 } \\left[(6 \\pi^2 \\rho_2)^{\\frac{2}{3 } } - { \\frac{1}{36 } } ( \\left| \\frac{\\nabla \\rho_2 } { \\rho_2 } \\right|^2 + 2 \\frac{\\nabla^2 \\rho_2}{\\rho_2 } ) \\right ] + ( { \\frac{1 } { 2 } } m_2 \\omega^2 { \\bar r}^2 - \\mu_2 + g\\rho_1 ) = 0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    similar to the one - component case , one can rewrite the above in a dimensionless form by introducing for each of the species @xmath50 , the following quantities : @xmath51^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ ] , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 . here",
    "= 3-@xmath50 . if one neglects the smaller terms containing derivatives of @xmath56 ( the tf limit ) , one obtains the following algebraic equations satisfied by the dimensionless densities @xmath57 and @xmath58 for any coupling strength @xmath59 : @xmath60 we see that the effect of the additional @xmath61 term , i.e. the interaction , is to deplete the regions where @xmath62 is highest ( without necessarily leading to a phase segregation ) .    when there is phase segregation , the interface energy is proportional to the square root of the coefficient of the gradient term@xcite and it often serves to distinguish different configurations . in that case , their effect can not be neglected and these are included in the monte carlo simulations .",
    "we next discuss some special cases in the tf limit .",
    "to simplify the notations , we will use : @xmath64 . in this case , three solutions to eq .",
    "( 6 ) will correspond to @xmath65 , of which only one is physical with @xmath66 .",
    "if a solution @xmath67 exists , by symmetry , the other one is necessarily @xmath68 .",

    "the real solutions are plotted in fig .",
    "[ thermo ] , where the @xmath65 solution is referred to as  sym \" , and the other conjugate ( asymmetric ) solutions are referred to as  a1 \" and  a2 \" .",
    "below we discuss these solutions in the weak and strong coupling limits .      in this case",
    "we look for symmetric solutions ( @xmath70 ) .",
    "equation ( [ densities ] ) then reduces to ( dropping the subscripts ) : @xmath71 which can be solved easily numerically to give the density profile of the non - segregated phase .",
    "it is possible to show that after proper rescaling , the result for all coupling strengths and at any point can be summarized in a single universal curve in fig .",

    "the above situation , however , can not be always sustained . in the strong coupling limit",
    ", we can have phase segregation ( @xmath78 ) , and one needs to go back to eq .",
    "( [ densities ] ) which now admits lower energy solutions that are not `` permutation symmetric '' : @xmath79 where we used the same simplifying notations as before .",
    "as previously mentioned , the symmetric solution @xmath80 always exists .",
    "this can be exploited to reduce the above equations to a quadratic equation , which is analytically more transparent .    subtracting the above equations from each other and dividing out by @xmath81 ,",
    "we obtain , @xmath82 this quadratic equation can be solved for @xmath83 in terms of @xmath84 .",
    "the solutions will all be axially symmetric in that they are functions of @xmath85 only .",
    "in actuality , the axial symmetry can also be broken , but we do not find it here since we neglected the terms in gradient of the particle density in the kinetic energy .",
    "the broken symmetry solutions will be discussed in the subsection e where we present results obtained from the monte carlo simulations incorporating these terms . in fig .",
    "[ thermo ] , the solutions with @xmath86 can be seen in the limit of small reduced distance and large @xmath87 .",
    "the bifurcation point where these solutions start to occur , corresponds , from numerical results , to @xmath88 , and @xmath89 , which separate the strong coupling regime from the weak one . in both figures ,",
    "the symmetric solution is drawn with solid line , and the asymmetric ones with dashed lines .",
    "actually , at the bifurcation point , we have exactly @xmath90 as will be shown in the tf linear stability analysis section below . since @xmath91 , the smallest coupling @xmath92 for the unequal solutions to occur satisfies @xmath93 . since @xmath94",
    ", we find a critical dimensionless coupling @xmath95 .",
    "we shall come back and compare this value with that obtained with a different approach .",
    "one can also treat the case where one of the species is a minority ( @xmath97 ) .",
    "if we assume @xmath98 , then @xmath99 , and @xmath100 . the density distribution of the majority species will be weakly perturbed . referring to eqs .",
    "( [ densities ] ) , one can see that the coupling @xmath101 becomes very small and maybe neglected .",
    "thus a good approximation is to assume @xmath102 .",
    "the @xmath103 term in the second equation , however , is a large quantity , and will strongly affect the particle density @xmath104 .",

    "as we can see from the above equation , their number , even at the origin is reduced by a factor of @xmath106 .",
    "we find that for a large enough @xmath103 the density @xmath84 is depleted from the center ( see also fig .",
    "[ thermo]b , curve a2 ) .",
    "we next study the fluctuations of the system about its equilibrium configuration in the tf limit by expanding the thermodynamic potential @xmath107 upto second order in the particle density variation @xmath108 about its minimum which was computed above .",
    "the sign of the second derivative of @xmath107 will decide the stability of the symmetric phase .",
    "a phase segregation occurs when the hessian ( second derivative matrix ) ceases to be positive definite .",
    "if the transition is first order , it would have already occurred before reaching a negative second derivative .",
    "the second derivative from eqs .",

    "this implies that @xmath116 , which is exactly the critical @xmath117 obtained earlier from a different analysis .",
    "these two instabilities occuring at the same point suggest that , within the adopted model ( tf ) , the transition might be of second order .",
    "similar to the electron gas which has several kinds of instabilities such as ferromagnetism , antiferromagnetism , charge density wave , superconductivity , etc ... these two - component systems might also exhibit other types of instabilities . to investigate them",
    ", we will assume the homogeneous case ( @xmath118 ) as the analysis can be made simpler by using the fourier decomposition of the density .",

    "this means that there is phase segregation for repulsive couplings .",
    "furthermore , if @xmath134 , there will be density modulation in the small @xmath133 limit ( the functional we considered is valid in the long wavelength limit ) .",
    "we shall return to this point in section iii where the dynamics are treated .",
    "one can also note that the transition points of eq .",

    "<S> we investigate the statics and dynamics of spatial phase segregation process of a mixture of fermion atoms in a harmonic trap using the density functional theory . </S>",
    "<S> the kinetic energy of the fermion gas is written in terms of the density and its gradients . </S>",
    "<S> several cases have been studied by neglecting the gradient terms ( the thomas - fermi limit ) which are then compared with the monte - carlo results using the full gradient corrected kinetic energy . a linear instability analysis has been performed using the random - phase approximation . near the onset of instability , the fastest unstable mode for spinodal decomposition is found to occur at @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> however , in the strong coupling limit , many more modes with @xmath1 decay with comparable time scales . </S>"
