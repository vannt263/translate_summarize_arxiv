    "previous versions of the catalog ( schneider et al .  2002 , 2003 , 2005 ;",
    "hereafter papers  i , ii , and  iii ) were published with the sdss early data release ( edr ; stoughton et al .",
    "2002 ) , the sdss first data release ( dr1 ; abazajian et al .",
    "2003 ) , and the sdss third data release ( dr3 ; abazajian et al .  2005 ) , and contained 3,814 , 16,713 , and 46,420 quasars , respectively .",
    "the current catalog is the entire set of quasars from the sdss - i quasar survey ; the sdss - i was completed on 30 june  2005 and the fifth data release ( dr5 ; adelman - mccarthy et al .",
    "2007 ) was made public on 30  june  2006 .",
    "the catalog contains 77,429 quasars , the vast majority of which were discovered by the sdss .",
    "the sdss quasar survey is continuing via the sdss - ii legacy survey , which is is an extension of the sdss - i .",
    "the catalog in the present paper consists of the dr5 objects that have a luminosity larger than ( calculated assuming an cosmology [ spergel et al .",
    "2006 ] , which will be used throughout this paper ) , and whose sdss spectra contain at least one broad emission line ( velocity fwhm larger than or have interesting / complex absorption - line features .",
    "the catalog also has a bright limit the quasars range in redshift from  0.08 to  5.41 ; 78%  have redshifts below  2.0 .",
    "the objects are denoted in the catalog by their dr5 j2000 coordinates ; the format for the object name is . since the image data used for the astrometric information can change between data releases ( e.g. , a region with poor seeing that is included in an early release is superseded by a newer observation in good seeing ) , the coordinates for an object can change at the  0.1@xmath3 to  0.2@xmath3 level ; hence the designation of a given source can change between data releases . except on very rare occasions ( see  5.1 ) , this change in position is much less than  1@xmath3 .",
    "when merging sdss quasar catalogs with previous databases one should always use the coordinates , not object names , to identify unique entries .",
    "the dr5 catalog does not include classes of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) such as type  2 quasars , seyfert galaxies , and bl  lacertae objects ; studies of these sources in the sdss can be found in zakamska et al .",

    "the observations used to produce the catalog are presented in section 2 ; the construction of the catalog and the catalog format are discussed in sections 3 and  4 , respectively .",
    "section  5 presents an overview of the catalog , and a summary is given in section  6 .",

    "the sloan digital sky survey uses a ccd camera on a dedicated telescope at apache point observatory , new mexico , to obtain images in five broad optical bands ( @xmath4 ; fukugita et al .",
    "1996 ) over approximately 10,000  deg@xmath2 of the high galactic latitude sky .",
    "the survey data - processing software measures the properties of each detected object in the imaging data in all five bands , and determines and applies both astrometric and photometric calibrations ( pier et al . , 2003 ; ;",
    "ivezi et al .",
    "photometric calibration is provided by simultaneous observations with a 20-inch telescope at the same site ( see hogg et al .",
    "2001 , smith et al .",
    "2002 , stoughton et al .",
    "2002 , and tucker et al .",
    "the sdss photometric system is based on the ab magnitude scale ( oke & gunn  1983 ) .",
    "the catalog contains photometry from  204 sdss imaging runs acquired between 19  september  1998 ( run  94 ) and 13  may  2005 ( run  5326 ) .      the sdss filter system was designed to identify quasars at redshifts between zero and approximately six ; most quasar candidates are selected based on their location in multidimensional sdss color - space .",
    "the point spread function ( psf ) magnitudes are used for the quasar target selection , and the selection is based on magnitudes and colors that have been corrected for galactic extinction ( using the maps of schlegel , finkbeiner , & davis  1998 ) .",
    "an @xmath6 magnitude limit of  19.1 is imposed for candidates whose colors indicate a probable redshift of less than  @xmath1  3.0 ( selected from the @xmath7 color cube ) ; high - redshift candidates ( selected from the @xmath8 color cube ) are accepted if and the source is unresolved .",
    "the errors on the @xmath6 measurements are typically and magnitudes at the brighter and fainter limits , respectively .",
    "in addition to the multicolor selection , unresolved objects brighter that lie within  2.0@xmath3 of a first radio source ( becker , white , &  helfand  1995 ) are also identified as primary quasar candidates .",
    "target selection also imposes a maximum brightness limit on quasar candidates ; the spectra of objects that exceed this brightness could contaminate the adjacent spectra on the detectors of the sdss spectrographs .",
    "a detailed description of the quasar selection process and possible biases can be found in richards et al .",
    "( 2002a ) .",
    "the primary sample described above was supplemented by quasars that were targeted by the following sdss spectroscopic target selection algorithms : galaxy and luminous red galaxy ( strauss et al .",
    "2002 and eisenstein et al .",
    "2001 ) , x - ray ( object near the position of a _ rosat _ all - sky survey [ rass ; voges et al .  1999 ,  2000 ]",
    "source ; see anderson et al .",
    "2003 ) , star ( point source with a color typical of an interesting class of star ) , or serendipity ( unusual color or first matches ) .",
    "the sdss is designed to be complete in the galaxy , luminous red galaxy and quasar programs , ( in practice various limitations reduce the completeness to about  90% ) but no attempt at completeness was made for the other categories .",
    "most of the dr5 quasars that fall below the magnitude limits of the quasar survey were selected by the serendipity algorithm ( see  5 ) .    while the bulk of the catalog objects targeted as quasars were selected based on the algorithm of richards et al .",
    "( 2002a ) , during the early years of the sdss the quasar selection software was undergoing constant modification to improve its efficiency .",
    "all of the sources in papers  i and  ii , and some of the paper  iii objects , were not identified with the final selection algorithm .",
    "once the final target selection software was installed , the algorithm was applied to the entire sdss photometric database .",
    "each dr5 quasar has two spectroscopic target selection flags listed in the catalog : best , which refers to the final algorithm , and target , which is the target flag used in the actual spectroscopic targeting .",
    "there are also two sets of photometric measurements for each quasar : best , which refers to the measurements with the latest photometric software on the highest quality data , and target , which are the values used at the time of the spectroscopic target selection .",
    "extreme care must be exercised when constructing statistical samples from this catalog ; if one uses the values produced by only the latest version of the selection software , not only must one drop the catalog quasars that were not identified as quasar candidates by the final selection software , one must also account for quasar candidates produced by the final version that were not observed in the sdss spectroscopic survey ( this can occur in regions of sky whose spectroscopic targets were identified by early versions of the selection software ) .",
    "the selection for the uv - excess quasars , which comprise the majority ( @xmath1 80% ) of the objects in the dr5 catalog , has remained reasonably uniform ; the changes to the selection algorithm were primarily designed to increase the effectiveness of the identification of quasars .",
    "extensive discussion of the completeness and efficiency of the selection can be found in richards et al .",

    "the survey efficiency ( the ratio of quasars to quasar candidates ) for the ultraviolet excess - selected candidates , which comprise the bulk of the quasar sample , is about  77% .",
    "( the catalog contains information on which objects can be used in a uniform sample ; see section  4 . )",
    "spectroscopic targets chosen by the various sdss selection algorithms ( i.e. , quasars , galaxies , stars , serendipity ) are arranged onto a series of 3@xmath9 diameter circular fields ( blanton et al .",

    "the dr5 spectroscopic program attempted to cover , in a well - defined manner , an area of  @xmath1  5740  deg@xmath2 .",
    "spectroscopic plate  716 was the first spectroscopic observation that was based on the final version of the quasar target selection algorithm of richards et al .",
    "( 2002a ) ; the detailed tiling information in the sdss database must be consulted to identify those regions of sky targeted with the final selection algorithm ( see richards et al .",

    "the two sdss double spectrographs produce data covering at a spectral resolution the data , along with the associated calibration frames , are processed by the sdss spectroscopic pipeline ( see stoughton et al .",
    "the calibrated spectra are classified into various groups ( e.g. , star , galaxy , quasar ) , and redshifts are determined by two independent software packages .",
    "objects whose spectra can not be classified by the software are flagged for visual inspection .",
    "figure  1 shows the calibrated sdss spectra of four previously unknown catalog quasars representing a range of properties .",
    "the processed dr5 spectra _ have not _ been corrected for galactic extinction .",
    "the quasars in the catalog were drawn from three sets of sdss observations : 1 )  the primary survey area , 2 )   bonus \" plates , which are spectroscopic observations of regions near to , but outside of , the primary survey area , and 3 )   special \" plates , where the spectroscopic targets were not chosen by the standard sdss target selection algorithms ( e.g. , a set of plates to investigate the structure of the galaxy ; see adelman - mccarthy et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "the dr5 quasar catalog was constructed , as were the previous editions , in three stages : 1 )  creation of a quasar candidate database , 2 )  visual examination of the spectra of the quasar candidates , and 3 )  application of luminosity and emission - line velocity width criteria .",
    "all three tasks were initially done without reference to the material in the previous sdss quasar catalogs , although the results of each task were compared to the paper  iii database ( e.g. , the construction of the quasar database was not viewed as complete until it was understood why any paper  iii quasars were not included ) .",
    "this catalog of bona - fide quasars , that have redshifts checked by eye and luminosities and line widths that meet the formal quasar definition , is constructed from a larger  master \" table of confirmed quasars and quasar candidates .",
    "this master table was created using an sql query to the public sdss - dr5 database ( i.e. , the catalog archive server [ cas ] ; http://cas.sdss.org/astrodr5/ ) .",
    "two versions of the photometric database exist , which contain the properties of objects when targeted for spectroscopic observations ( target ) and as determined in the latest processing ( best ) .",
    "these databases are divided into multiple tables and subtables to facilitate access to only the most relevant data for a particular use . in the case of the quasar catalog construction ,",
    "we have made use of the photoobjall and specobjall tables , which contain , respectively , the photometric information for _ all _ sdss sources and for _ all _ sdss spectra . in the case of photoobjall , both the target and best versions are queried .",
    "these tables include duplicate observations of objects and observations of objects that lie outside of the formal sdss area ( as compared to the photoobj and specobj tables , which include only sources in the formal sdss area ) , and are the most complete database files .",
    "for example , in photoobjall , two ( or more ) observations of a single object may exist ; if so , one is classified as primary , the other(s ) as secondary .",
    "this master table contains all objects identified as quasar candidate targets for spectroscopy in either the target or best photometric databases .",
    "quasar candidates are those objects which have had one or more of the following flags set by the algorithm described by richards et al .",
    "( 2002a ) :    target_qso_hiz or target_qso_cap or target_qso_skirt or target_qso_first_cap + or target_qso_first_skirt    except for",
    "the  special \" plates [ see adelman - mccarthy et al .  2006 , 2007 ] , where additional care is required in interpreting the flags ) .",
    "objects flagged as target_qso_mag_outlier and target_qso_reject are not included , as these flags are meant only for diagnostic purposes .",
    "( in the cas documentation and the edr paper , target_qso_mag_outlier is called target_qso_faint . )",
    "furthermore , the master table includes any objects with spectra that have been classified by the spectroscopic pipeline as quasars ( specclass = qso or hiz_qso ) , that have unknown type , or that have redshifts greater than  0.6 .",
    "( on rare occasions the spectroscopic pipeline measures the correct redshift for a quasar but classifies the object as a galaxy . )    the query was run on the union of the database tables target .. photoobjall , best .. specobjall , and best .. photoobjall .",
    "multiple entries for a given object are retained at this stage .",
    "ten objects in the dr3 quasar catalog were missed by this query .",
    "one omission was due to an  unmapped \" fiber ( a spectrum of a quasar was obtained , but because of a failure in the mapping of fiber number to location in the sky , we are no longer certain of the celestial position of the object ) ; the other nine were low - redshift agn that were not classified as quasars by the spectroscopic pipeline ( this result provides an estimate of the incompleteness produced by the query ) .",
    "we were able to identify the information for all ten quasars in the database and add the material to the master table .",
    "four automated cuts were made to the master table database of 329,884 candidates : 1 )  objects targeted as quasars but whose spectra had not yet been obtained by the closing date of dr5 ( 124,447 objects ) , 2 )  candidates classified with high confidence as  stars \" by the spectroscopic pipeline that had redshifts less than  0.002 ( 33,653 ) , 3 )  objects whose photometric measurements have not been loaded into the cas ( 3106 ) and 4 )  multiple spectra ( coordinate agreement better than  1.0@xmath3 ) of the same object ( 40,007 ) . in cases of duplicate spectra of an object , the  science primary \" spectrum is selected ( i.e. , the spectrum was obtained as part of normal science operations ) ; when there is more than one science primary observation ( or when none of the spectra have this flag set ) , the spectrum with the highest signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) is retained ( see stoughton et al .",
    "2002 for a description of the science primary flag ) .",
    "these actions produced a list of  128,671 unique quasar candidates .",
    "the sdss spectra of the remaining quasar candidates were manually inspected by several of the authors ( dps , pbh , gtr , mas , and sfa ) ; as in previous papers in this series , we found that the spectroscopic pipeline redshifts and classifications of the overwhelming majority of the objects are accurate .",
    "tens of thousands of objects were dropped from the list because they were obviously not quasars ( these objects tended to be low s / n stars , unusual stars , and a mix of absorption - line and narrow emission - line objects ) ; this large number of candidates that are not quasars is due to the inclusive nature of our initial database query .",
    "spectra for which redshifts could not be determined ( low signal - to - noise ratio or subject to data - processing difficulties ) were also removed from the sample .",
    "this visual inspection resulted in the revisions of the redshifts of 863 quasars ; the changes in the individual redshifts were usually quite substantial , due to the spectroscopic pipeline misidentifying emission lines .",
    "an independent determination of the redshifts quasars with redshifts larger than  2.9 in the catalog was performed by shen et al .",
    "the redshift differences between the two sets of measurements follow a gaussian distribution ( with slightly extended wings ) , with a mean of  0.002 and a dispersion of  0.01 .",
    "the catalog contains numerous examples of extreme broad absorption line ( bal ) quasars ( see hall et al .",
    "2002 ) ; it is difficult if not impossible to apply the emission - line width criterion for these objects , but they are clearly of interest , have more in common with ",
    "typical \" quasars than with narrow - emission line galaxies , and have historically been included in quasar catalogs .",
    "we have included in the catalog all objects with broad absorption - line spectra that meet the luminosity criterion .      as in papers  ii and  iii ,",
    "we adopt a luminosity limit of the absolute magnitudes were calculated by correcting the best @xmath6 measurement for galactic extinction ( using the maps of schlegel , finkbeiner , & davis  1998 ) and assuming that the quasar spectral energy distribution in the ultraviolet - optical can be represented by a power law where @xmath10  =  @xmath11 ( vanden  berk et al .",
    "( in the 134 cases where best photometry was not available , the target measurements were substituted for the absolute magnitude calculation . )",
    "this approach ignores the contributions of emission lines and the observed distribution in continuum slopes .",
    "emission lines can contribute several tenths of a magnitude to the k - correction ( see richards et al .",
    "2006 ) , and variations in the continuum slopes can introduce a magnitude or more of error into the calculation of the absolute magnitude , depending upon the redshift .",
    "the absolute magnitudes will be particularly uncertain at redshifts near and above five , when the lyman  @xmath10 emission line ( with a typical observed equivalent width ) and strong lyman  @xmath10 forest absorption enter the  @xmath6 bandpass .",
    "quasars near the @xmath12  =  @xmath13 luminosity limit are often not enormously brighter in the @xmath6-band than the starlight produced by the host galaxy .",
    "although the psf - based sdss photometry presented in the catalog are less susceptible to host galaxy contamination than are fixed - aperture measurements , the nucleus of the host galaxy can still contribute appreciably to this measurement for the lowest luminosity entries in the catalog ( see hao et al .",
    "an object of @xmath14 will reach the ",
    "low - redshift \" selection limit at a redshift of  @xmath1  0.4 .",
    "after visual inspection and application of the luminosity criterion had reduced the number of quasar candidates to under 80,000 objects , the remaining spectra were processed with an automated line - measuring routine .",
    "the spectra for objects whose maximum line width was less than 1000  km  s@xmath0 were visually examined ; if the measurement was deemed to be an accurate reflection of the line ( automated routines occasionally have spectacular failures when dealing with complex line profiles ) , the object was removed from the catalog .",
    "the dr5 sdss quasar catalog is available in three types of files at the sdss public web site listed in the introduction : 1 )  a standard ascii file with fixed - size columns , 2 )  a gzipped compressed version of the ascii file ( which is smaller than the uncompressed version by a factor of more than four ) , and 3 )  a binary fits table format .",
    "the following description applies to the standard ascii file .",
    "all files contain the same number of columns , but the storage of the numbers differs slightly in the ascii and fits formats ; the fits header contains all of the required documentation .",
