    "in contrast with the more conventional optical phase conjugation schemes that perform phase conjugation with spectral inversion @xcite , spectral phase conjugation ( spc ) is the phase conjugation of an optical signal in the frequency domain without spectral inversion .",
    "equivalently , in the time domain , spc is the phase conjugation and time reversal of the signal complex pulse envelope @xcite .",
    "spc is useful for all - order dispersion and nonlinearity compensation @xcite , as well as optical signal processing @xcite .",
    "although spc has been experimentally demonstrated using photon echo @xcite , spectral hole burning @xcite , temporal holography @xcite , spectral holography @xcite , and spectral three - wave mixing ( twm ) @xcite , all the demonstrated schemes suffer from the use of cryogenic setups , non - realtime operation , or extremely high pump energy .",
    "pulsed twm @xcite and four - wave - mixing ( fwm ) @xcite processes in the transverse - pumping geometry have been theoretically proposed to efficiently perform spc , but have not yet been experimentally realized .",
    "all the holographic and wave - mixing schemes also have strict requirements on the transverse beam profile of the signal , limiting their appeal for simultaneous diffraction and dispersion compensation applications .",
    "there is a correspondence between classical spc and quantum coincident frequency entanglement , as shown in ref .   for",
    "the transversely pumped twm @xcite and fwm @xcite processes .",
    "it is then interesting to see if other coincident frequency entanglement schemes are also capable of performing spc , when an input signal is present .",
    "this paper studies one of such schemes , which makes use of extended phase matching ( epm)@xcite and has been experimentally demonstrated @xcite in a periodically - poled potassium titanyl phosphate ( ppktp ) crystal @xcite .",
    "it is shown in section [ fourier ] , for the first time to the author s knowledge , that this epm scheme is indeed capable of performing spc and optical parametric amplification ( opa ) , more efficiently than previous proposals .",
    "the analysis also yields a surprising result , namely that the parametric gain can be theoretically infinite even for a pump pulse with finite energy , analogous to backward wave oscillation , where counterpropagating waves are parametrically coupled and can give rise to mirrorless optical parametric oscillation ( opo)@xcite .",
    "the reason for the similarity is that , in the scheme presented here , even though the signal and the idler copropagate with the pump pulse in the laboratory frame , they _ counterpropagate in the frame of the moving pump pulse _ , because one is faster than the pump and one is slower .",
    "hence the moving pump pulse provides both an effective cavity and parametric gain , leading to oscillation . in reality , however , the interaction among the pulses should be ultimately limited by the finite device length .",
    "it is shown in section [ laplace ] , with a laplace analysis , that the parametric gain should abruptly increase above the threshold , where infinite gain is predicted by the fourier analysis , but a finite medium length would always limit the gain to a finite value . still , as previous proposals of twm mirrorless opo have never been experimentally achieved due to the requirement of a continuous - wave ( cw ) pump and the difficulty in phase matching counterpropagating waves , the presented analysis suggests the exciting possibility that mirrorless opo can be realized with an ultrashort pump pulse and a practical poling period for phase matching of copropagating modes , if a long enough medium can be fabricated and parasitic effects can be controlled . by analyzing the scheme in the heisenberg picture in section [ quantum ] , a high spontaneous parametric down conversion rate is also predicted , in excellent agreement with the experimental result reported in ref .  .",
    "the result should be useful for many quantum information processing applications , such as quantum - enhanced synchronization @xcite and multiphoton entanglement for quantum cryptography @xcite .",
    "finally , numerical results are presented in section [ numerical ] , which confirm the theoretical predictions .",
    "and @xmath0 , while the pump pulse has a carrier frequency of @xmath1 .",
    "the epm condition requires that the signal and the idler counterpropagate with respect to the pump , which should be much shorter than the input signal.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    consider the copropagating twm process ( fig .",
    "[ epm_spc ] ) , assuming that the basic type - ii phase matching condition ( @xmath2 ) , with a quasi - phase - matching period @xmath3 , is satisfied .",
    "the coupled - mode equations are @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the pump pulse envelope of carrier frequency @xmath6 , @xmath7 are the signal and idler envelopes of frequency @xmath8 and @xmath0 respectively , @xmath9 are the group delays of the three modes , @xmath10 are the nonlinear coupling coefficients , @xmath11 are the center frequencies of the modes such that @xmath12 , and @xmath13 are the refractive indices . group - velocity dispersion within each mode and diffraction are neglected .",
    "define @xmath14 as the retarded time coordinate that follows the propagating pump pulse .",
    "the change of coordinates yields @xmath15 throughout the theoretical analysis , the pump is assumed to be undepleted and unchirped , so that @xmath16 , hereafter regarded as real without loss of generality .",
    "equations ( [ signal ] ) and ( [ idler ] ) are space - invariant , if the nonlinear medium length @xmath17 is much longer than the signal or idler spatial pulse width in the frame of @xmath18 and @xmath19 , or @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the signal or idler pulse width .",
    "one can then perform fourier transform on the equations with respect to @xmath18 , as defined by the following , @xmath22 notice that @xmath23 is defined as the fourier transform after the conjugation of @xmath24 .",
    "the coupled - mode equations become @xmath25 let @xmath26 consider the case in which @xmath27 and @xmath28 are non - zero and have opposite signs , implying that the signal and the idler propagate in opposite directions with respect to the pump .",

    ". then @xmath54 , and the output idler becomes the phase - conjugated and time - reversed replica of the input signal , if the input idler is zero .",
    "spc is hence performed . the spc efficiency @xmath55 , or the idler gain , defined as the output idler fluence divided by the input signal fluence , is @xmath56 this spc efficiency can be fundamentally higher than that of the transversely pumped twm device @xcite due to two reasons .",
    "one is the copropagation of the three pulses , which makes @xmath57 higher than a similar parameter in the latter case by a factor of @xmath58 , on the order of 40 for ktp .",
    "the second reason is that for @xmath59 , due to the tangent function dependence , the spc efficiency of the epm scheme increases with respect to @xmath57 much faster than that of the latter , which only depends on a similar parameter exponentially .",
    "that said , the transversely pumped fwm device @xcite can still be more efficient in the small gain regime @xmath60 if a highly nonlinear material , such as polydiacetylene , is used .",
    "furthermore , the epm device requires a longer nonlinear medium length by a factor of @xmath58 , and depends crucially on the material dispersion , thus severely limiting the flexibility in the choice of operating wavelengths .    equations ( [ transforms ] ) and ( [ transformi ] ) are obtained from the analysis of the coupled - mode equations ( [ signal ] ) and ( [ idler ] ) , after fourier transform with respect to @xmath18 is performed .",
    "the solutions are therefore formally valid only when the nonlinear medium length @xmath17 goes to infinity . in practice , in the moderate gain regime @xmath61 , the approximation given by eq .",
    "( [ longmedium ] ) should be adequate , where the length @xmath17 can be , say , ten times larger than the signal spatial pulse width in the frame of @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "numerical analysis in section [ numerical ] will validate the accuracy of the fourier solutions .",
    "intriguingly , the fourier solutions , eqs .",
    "( [ transforms ] ) and ( [ transformi ] ) , have the same form as those of backward wave oscillation @xcite , suggesting that the device studied here , with an ultrashort pump pulse and a practical quasi - phase - matching period ( @xmath62 @xmath63 m as reported in ref .  ) , can also perform mirrorless opo , as long as @xmath64 .",
    "however , the prediction of infinite gain is based on the assumption of infinite medium length and therefore may not be valid . in this case , laplace transform should be used .    for the cw - pumped mirrorless opo schemes ,",
    "a laplace analysis @xcite with respect to time shows that beyond threshold , poles appear on the right - hand plane in the laplace domain , meaning that the temporal impulse response increases exponentially with time , leading to self - oscillation when enough time is elapsed . the same procedures of utilizing the two - sided laplace transform @xcite as in ref .   are followed here in order to be consistent with the relevant literature , but since the proposed scheme is the opposite limit of the cw devices , the laplace transform should be performed with respect to @xmath18 instead , @xmath65 for simplicity but without affecting the qualitative behavior of the solutions , it is assumed that the pump pulse is square , there is no input idler , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 .",
    "the output solutions in the laplace domain are then given by @xmath68 if we let @xmath69 , the transfer functions in eqs .",
    "( [ laplaces ] ) and ( [ laplacei ] ) are well - known to be low - pass filters @xcite , the bandwidth of which decreases as @xmath57 increases . if the spatial bandwidth of the input signal , on the order of @xmath70 , is much smaller than the bandwidth of the low - pass filters , the transfer functions can be regarded as flat - top functions , and by plugging @xmath71 in eqs .",

    "as @xmath57 increases and the filter bandwidth decreases , however , the fourier solutions become less and less accurate for a finite - bandwidth input signal .",

    "given the input - output signal - idler relationship in eqs .",
    "( [ transforms ] ) and ( [ transformi ] ) , it is straightforward to obtain a quantum picture of the parametric process in the moderate gain regime by replacing the signal and idler envelopes with heisenberg operators , so that @xmath86 if the inputs are fock states , @xmath87 the average output photon number of each mode is @xmath88 the average number of spontaneously generated photon pairs per pump pulse is therefore the same as the idler gain , or @xmath89 . moreover , the unitary transform given by eqs .",
    "( [ operators ] ) and ( [ operatori ] ) has the same form as the cw fwm process .",
    "one then expects the photon wavefunction to be similarly given by @xcite @xmath90 is the fock state in the signal or idler mode .",
    "the scheme thus has a significant advantage in efficiency and robustness for multiphoton entanglement , compared with other schemes that often require feedback @xcite",
    ". the efficient multiphoton coincident frequency entanglement should be useful for quantum - enhanced synchronization @xcite and quantum cryptography applications @xcite .",
    "the preceding quantum analysis assumes that there is only one spatial mode in each signal or idler mode , and is accurate only when the fourier solutions are accurate .",
    "this restricts the applicability of the quantum analysis to the moderate gain regime @xmath91 , depending on how closely the assumption in eq .",
    "( [ longmedium ] ) is observed .",
    "it is beyond the scope of this paper to investigate what happens in the quantum picture when more than one spatial modes are involved , but qualitatively , one expects that each spatial mode should have a varying parametric gain depending on the spatial frequency , as suggested by the laplace solutions in eqs .",

    "a medium length of 10 cm may be pushing the limit of current technology .",
    "even if one is able to fabricate such a long periodically - poled nonlinear crystal , the effective medium length is always limited by parasitic effects , such as diffraction , group - velocity dispersion , and competing third - order nonlinearities , so it might be difficult to fabricate an ideal epm device for the aforementioned purposes .",

    "@xcite , the diameter of the beam is @xmath120 @xmath63 m , so the characteristic diffraction length is @xmath121 cm , while the characteristic group - velocity dispersion length is 20 cm according to ref .  , which are all on the order of the medium length required for mirrorless opo .",
    "that said , techniques like diffusion bonding @xcite can be used to increase the length of a nonlinear crystal , diffraction can be eliminated by waveguiding , while there exist a variety of methods to compensate for group - velocity dispersion and third - order nonlinearities @xcite . hence with careful engineering , fabricating an epm device for the proposed applications is still a distinct possibility .",
    "in summary , it is proven that the copropagating three - wave - mixing process , with appropriate extended phase matching and pumped with a short second - harmonic pulse , is capable of performing spectral phase conjugation , parametric amplification and efficient multiphoton entanglement . the main technical challenges of experimental implementation seem to be the long medium length required and the control of parasitic effects such as diffraction , group - velocity dispersion , and competing third - order nonlinearities",
    ". however , a shorter proof - of - concept device has already been experimentally realized for the purposes of broadband second - harmonic generation @xcite and coincident frequency entanglement @xcite , so it is not unrealistic to expect that a longer device can be fabricated for the proposed applications , which should be useful for optical communications , signal processing , and quantum information processing .",
    "theoretically , much remains to be explored .",
    "the study of parasitic effects , not considered in this paper , is vital for experimental realization .",
    "the analysis of the ultrashort - pump limit can be potentially generalized to other twm and fwm geometries , while the quantum analysis of this limit is by no means complete . in conclusion",
