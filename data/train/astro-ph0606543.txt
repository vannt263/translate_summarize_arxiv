    "x - ray observations of extraplanar hot gas ( @xmath6 @xmath7 10@xmath8 k ) around nearby edge - on disk galaxies are essential in the study of the galactic ecosystem in many aspects , particularly the disk - halo interaction .",
    "such observations have helped establish the prevalence of galactic superwinds in starburst galaxies , e.g. , ngc  253 ( strickland et al .  2000 , 2002 ) and ngc 4666 ( dahlem , weaver & heckman  1998 ) , among others .",
    "extraplanar x - ray - emitting gas has also been detected unambiguously around several `` normal '' late - type galaxies with little evidence for nuclear starbursts :  ngc  891 ( sb ; bregman & houck 1997 ) , ngc 4631 ( scd ; wang et al .",
    "2001 ) , ngc 3556 ( sc ; wang , chaves & irwin 2003 ) and ngc 4634 ( scd ; t@xmath9llmann et al .",
    "2006 ) . in these galaxies",
    "( except for ngc  4634 which currently lacks direct evidence ) , extraplanar hot gas is clearly linked to outflows from recent massive star - forming regions in galactic disks .",
    "the global x - ray properties of extraplanar gas in these `` normal '' star - forming galaxies , when scaled with the star formation rate of the host galaxies , appear similar to those found in starburst galaxies ( strickland et al .",
    "2004a , b ; wang 2005 ) .",
    "nevertheless , this needs to be confirmed by extended x - ray observations of `` normal '' star - forming galaxies .    on the other hand",
    ", current galaxy formation models also predict the existence of hot gaseous halos surrounding present - day disk galaxies , which arise from gravitational infall from the intergalactic medium ( igm ; e.g. , toft et al .  2002 and references therein ) .",
    "the predicted extraplanar x - ray luminosity strongly depends on the mass of the host galaxy .",
    "x - ray observations thus have long been expected to detect such gaseous halos around nearby massive , typically earlier - type disk galaxies . however , there is so far little direct observational evidence for the presence of this kind of x - ray - emitting halo .",
    "benson et al .  ( 2000 ) analyzed x - ray emission from the outer halos ( @xmath10 ) of primarily two early - type spirals ngc 2841 ( sb ; @xmath11 mpc ) and ngc 4594 ( sa ; @xmath12 mpc ) , using _",
    "rosat _ pspc observations .",
    "no significant diffuse emission was detected , although the upper limits to the diffuse x - ray luminosities are consistent with the current predictions ( toft et al .",
    "therefore , more dedicated searches for the x - ray signals of igm accretion around disk galaxies are needed .",
    "here we present a study of an _ xmm - newton _  observation toward ngc  2613 , an edge - on sb galaxy with `` normal '' star formation .",
    "we focus on probing the spatial and spectral properties of its large - scale x - ray emission .",
    "this galaxy ( table  [ tab : n2613 ] ) is a good candidate to probe the presence of hot gas , in the sense that : 1 ) it is very massive and thus expected to contain a large amount of hot gas ; 2 ) its high inclination ( @xmath1379@xmath14 ) allows the possibility of detecting extraplanar emission , either from a halo of accreted gas or a large - scale outflow ; 3 ) its moderately large distance ( 25.9 mpc ) places the galaxy and its @xmath1350 kpc vicinity in the field of view ( fov ) of a typical _ xmm - newton _  observation , offering a good opportunity of studying the large - scale distribution of gas , and 4 ) it is known to show extraplanar features at other wavebands , specifically the radio continuum and ( chaves & irwin 2001 ; irwin & chaves 2003 ) as well as earlier observations ( bottema 1989 ) .",
    "we obtained two _ xmm - newton _  observations on ngc  2613 . the first observation ( obs .",

    "consequently , another observation ( obs .",
    "i d 0149160201 ) with a 33 ks exposure was taken on may 20/21 , 2003 . in our analysis , we only used data obtained from the second observation .",
    "we used sas , version 6.1.0 , together with the latest calibration files for data reduction . for the mos data , we selected only events with patterns 0 through 12 and applied flag filters xmmea_em , xmmea_2 , xmmea_3 and xmmea_11 . for the pn data , we selected only events with patterns 0 through 4 and applied flag filters xmmea_ep , xmmea_2 , xmmea_3 and xmmea_11 . according to light curves of the mos and the pn , we further excluded time intervals with high background rates by setting good time interval thresolds of 2.0 cts / s for the mos in the 0.3 - 12 kev range and 6.0 cts / s for the pn in the 0.3 - 15 kev range , respectively .",
    "the resulting net exposure time is 23.5 ks for the mos and 18.7 ks for the pn .",
    "we used the _",
    "skycast _ program to generate the `` blank - sky '' background for our observation .",
    "same event filters were applied to the``blank - sky '' event files , resulting in exposures of 791 , 759 and 294 ks for the mos1 , mos2 and pn , respectively .",
    "we then constructed images and exposure maps at the 0.2 - 0.5 , 0.5 - 1 , 1 - 2 , 2 - 4.5 and 4.5 - 7.5 kev bands for each detector . for spectral analysis",

    "the source detection uses a detection aperture of the 50% psf encircled energy radius ( eer ) .",

    "the nucleus is the only source detected within the central 30@xmath18 , suggesting that this emission may represent an agn . to investigate this further",
    ", we perform a spectral analysis on the nuclear emission . due to the relatively low spatial resolution and short exposure time of the observation as well as the relatively large distance to ngc  2613",
    ", the spectrum extraction of the nucleus is a compromise between having better counting statistics and suffering less contamination from non - nuclear emission around the nucleus . to assess the contribution from non - nuclear emission",
    ", we extract two spectra from circles with radii of 10@xmath18 and 16@xmath18 around the galactic center , for each detector .",
    "the 10@xmath18 ( 16@xmath18 ) radius corresponds to a physical scale of @xmath131.2 ( 2.0 ) kpc at the distance of ngc  2613 and represents an enclosed energy fraction ( eef ) of @xmath130.50 ( 0.65 ) in the pn and @xmath130.55 ( 0.70 ) in the mos .",
    "we extract a background spectrum for each detector from a circle with a 25 radius at @xmath19 to the south of the galactic disk ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sou_plot ] ) .",
    "this background region is chosen because it shows a low x - ray intensity and is at an off - axis angular distance comparable to that of the disk .",
    "we then bin the source spectra to achieve a background - subtracted signal - to - noise ratio greater than 2 .",
    "the spectra from the 16@xmath18 circle show a prominent broad bump at energies @xmath13  4 - 5 kev ( fig .",
    "[ fig : nucleus_spec ] ) , which can also be seen in the spectra from the 10@xmath18 circle .",
    "this is further evidence that the nuclear region contains an agn since the spectra can naturally be explained by a combination of a heavily absorbed power - law from an agn and a softer contribution from non - nuclear emission .",
    "we jointly fit the pn , mos1 and mos2 spectra in the 0.3 - 12 kev range with xspec .",
    "owing to the lack of obvious features below 3 kev in the spectra , a composite model of _",
    "wabs[zwabs(pl)+pl ] _ is applied , where the first power - law component ( pl1 ) with intrinsic absorption characterizes the nuclear emission and the second power - law component ( pl2 ) represents the non - nuclear emission . in the fit , we require that the amount of foreground absorption be at least that supplied by the galactic foreground ( as specified in _ wabs _ : n@xmath20 ) .",
    "fit results for the 10@xmath18 and 16@xmath18 spectra are consistent with each other within the uncertainty ranges .",
    "we list in table  [ tab : nucleus_fit ] the fit results to the 16@xmath18 spectra , the implications of which will be discussed in   [ subsec : nucleus ] .",
    "all quoted errors in the tables are at the 90% confidence level .",
    "the best - fit two - component model is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : nucleus_spec ] .",
    "we note that in the pn spectrum there is some hint of excess over the best - fit two - component model at @xmath130.9 kev , which might be physically due to the presence of diffuse hot gas around the nucleus .",
    "we thus try to include a thermal plasma component ( apec in xspec ) in the fit to probe the existence of an additional thermal component .",
    "while the best - fit temperature of this component is , as expected , @xmath130.9 kev , the fit is not significantly improved according to an f - test , and the range of the fitted temperature could not be well constrained .",
    "therefore we consider this potential thermal component insignificant in the spectra .",
    "-1 cm    -0.5 cm    given the relatively high source detection limit ( @xmath21 ) and the relatively low spatial resolution , the bulk of expected galactic x - ray sources of ngc  2613 are still embedded in unresolved emission .",
    "indeed , only four sources ( in addition to the nucleus ) are detected within the @xmath22 ellipse of the galaxy .",
    "we jointly fit the accumulated spectra of these four sources extracted from individual detectors .",
    "circles with radii of twice the 50% eer around individual sources are used to accumulate the spectra .",
    "corresponding background spectra are extracted from the source - removed @xmath22 ellipse . we find that an absorbed power - low model fits the spectra well , giving a best - fit photon index of @xmath23 and an intrinsic 0.3 - 10 kev luminosity of @xmath24 .",

    "[ fig:2dmap ] ) is a `` bubble - like '' feature , which is referred to as the ` north bubble ' in the following .",
    "this feature follows the minor axis fairly well and has a maximum extent of @xmath26 ( 13 kpc ) from the nucleus . immediately on the opposite side of the nucleus",
    "is another extension that is somewhat smaller , reaching @xmath27 .",
    "this feature will be called the ` south extension ' .",
    "a third feature protrudes from the south side of the major axis but west of the minor axis .",
    "this feature will be called the ` south - west feature ' .",
    "finally two very large extensions are seen to the east of the major axis with emission peaks located at ra= @xmath28 , dec@xmath29 ( north arc ) , and ra= @xmath30 , dec@xmath31 ( south arc ) .",
    "these have the appearance of arising from the eastern tip of the x - ray disk and will be called the ` eastern extensions ' consisting of northern and southern arcs .",
    "the above features are labelled in fig .",
    "[ fig:2dmap ] for ease of reference .",
    "most of these features extend significantly beyond the optical disk . given the extent of the x - ray emission along the major axis and the inclination of the disk , the projected in - disk emission along the minor axis should be within @xmath32 , whereas most of the extended features show an extent larger than 1@xmath33 .",
    "therefore , we suggest that these features are truly extraplanar . their origin will be further discussed in   [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "-1 cm    we remove the detected discrete sources , except for the nucleus , to study the spatial properties of the unresolved soft x - ray emission .",
    "the nucleus is kept because it is heavily obscured (   [ subsec : ps ] ) and contributes few photons to the emission below 2 kev . for each faint source with a count rate ( @xmath34 ) @xmath35 0.01 @xmath36 ,",
    "we exclude a circular region with a radius of twice the 50% enclosed energy radius ( eer ) . for sources with @xmath34 @xmath37 0.01 @xmath36",
    ", the radius is multiplied by an additional factor of 1+log(@xmath34/0.01 ) .",
    "the choice of the adopted radii is a compromise between removing the bulk of the source contribution and preserving a sufficient field for the study of unresolved emission .",
    "thus 75 - 80% of photons from each detected source is removed according to our criteria .",
    "we construct the `` blank - sky '' background - subtracted , exposure - corrected 0.5 - 2 kev intensity profile from the source - removed pn image , as a function of off - center distance along the minor axis .",

    "the total count rate produced by this extraplanar excess is @xmath44 .",
    "the unresolved emission should consist of two components : 1 ) emission from truly diffuse gas , and 2 ) collective discrete contributions from sources below our detection limit plus some residual counts spilled outside our source removal regions . to constrain the source component",
    ", we assume that it follows the distribution of the nir k - band light of the galaxy , which can be determined from the 2mass k - band map ( jarrett et al .",

    "circular regions used for removing the discrete x - ray sources are also excluded from the map .",
    "the k - band vertical profile is then produced in the same manner as for the x - ray profile . to compare the two profiles , we normalize the k - band profile to match the x - ray intensity at the center ( fig .  [",

    "these features further indicate the presence of diffuse hot gas . at energies above 2 kev",
    "the spectra are dominated by a collective contribution from unresolved discrete sources , most likely lmxbs ( see   [ subsec : cxs ] ) .",

    "the predicted luminosity strongly depends on the circular speed of the host galaxy .",
    "the most massive galaxies in their simulations have circular speeds similar to that of ngc  2613 ( @xmath13 @xmath91 ) . the predicted 0.2 - 2 kev luminosity for such a galaxy is @xmath92 ( fig .  3 in toft et al .",
    "from our best - fit spectral models of the spectra of unresolved emission , we derive an intrinsic 0.2 - 2 kev luminosity of @xmath138@xmath3 for the sum of the thermal and power - law components , and @xmath136@xmath3 for the thermal components only .",
    "we note that the unresolved emission outside our spectral extraction region contributes little to the total luminosity .",
    "the simulated luminosity of gas emission by toft et al .",
    "( 2002 ) is at least an order of magnitude higher than the observed value for ngc  2613 .",
    "we therefore conclude that the simulations as presented by toft et al .",
    "( 2002 ) substantially over - predict the x - ray emission from the cooling inflow of the igm , if this is what is occurring in ngc  2613 .",
    "this over - prediction is related to the so - called over - cooling problem in current theories of galaxy formation .",
    "we speculate that the over - cooling problem is a result of an inappropriate treatment of stellar and/or agn feedback .",
    "for example , the mechanical energy input from type ia supernovae ( sne ) is typically not included in galaxy formation simulations , partly due to the difficulty in treating the astrophysics related to gaseous flows .",
    "qualitatively , type ia sne , which tend to occur in low - density hot environments , provide an especially effective mechanism for large - scale distributed heating , required to reduce the cooling of gas in galactic bulges and halos ( tang & wang 2005 ) .",
    "massive stars in galactic disks may also serve as sources of mechanical energy that could produce outflows into halos and help slow down the cooling of the accrected gas .",
    "for example , with a star formation rate of @xmath93 for stars between 0.1 and 100 @xmath94 , and assuming a salpeter imf and that stars with mass @xmath95 become core - collapse sne , the rate of total energy release from the star - forming regions of ngc  2613 is @xmath96 .",
    "our spatial and spectral analyses suggest that the extraplanar gas is responsible for the thermal emission (   [ subsec : diffuse ] ) and has a total 0.3 - 10 kev luminosity of @xmath97 .",
    "thus , sne can provide enough energy to explain the x - ray emission of the extraplanar gas in ngc  2613 .",
    "-1 cm    -0.5 cm      [ subsubsec : correlations ] in fig .",
    "[ fig : overlay_map]a and b , we compare the x - ray emission with the radio continuum emission and total intensity emission , respectively . of the two radio images ,",
    "the radio continuum morphology more closely resembles the x - ray morphology in the sense that : a ) the north bubble has a radio continuum counterpart ; b ) the south extension also has a radio continuum counterpart ; c ) the south - west feature shows a small radio continuum protrusion ; and d ) the peaks of the large eastern extensions ( north and south ) also show radio emission .    the total intensity map shown here",
    "does not show all of the extended features identified by chaves & irwin ( 2001 ) , but two of their features , f1 and f2 clearly extend above and below the galactic plane and are labelled in fig .",
    "[ fig : overlay_map]b .",
    "these two features might be related with the northern and southern arc of the eastern extensions seen in the x - ray .",
    "it is not wise to read too much into these correlations , given the limited s / n of the maps .",
    "however , the relationship with the radio continuum is sufficiently strong that the x - ray emission in the extraplanar features , representing hot diffuse gas , is very likely associated with the radio continuum emission which represents predominantly the non - thermal component .",
    "we further consider the energetics of a specific feature , namely the ` north bubble ' , which is the only extraplanar feature that can be cleanly isolated from the ambient emission .",
    "guided by fig .",
    "[ fig : bubble_map ] , we approximate the volume occupation of the bubble by a cylinder with 1@xmath33 in diameter and 08 in height , the center of which is 12 above the galactic center .",
    "hence the volume of the bubble is @xmath98 .",
    "we find a total 0.5 - 2 kev count rate of 2.4@xmath99 within the bubble . in the best - fit model to the spectra of unresolved emission , the high and low temperature components predict a 0.5 - 2 kev count rate of 7.5@xmath99 and 2.0@xmath99 , respectively .",
    "therefore the north bubble is unlikely to be due to the low temperature component alone .",
    "instead , it could be dominated by the high temperature component .",
    "taking an effective temperature of @xmath13 0.8 kev , we estimate the mean density of the bubble to be @xmath100 , where @xmath101 is the filling factor of the hot gas inside the bubble .",
    "the total thermal energy of the bubble is @xmath102 , and the work done to steadily lift up the bubble against gravity is @xmath103 , given the gravitational potential introduced by the exponential disk of the galaxy ( irwin & chaves 2003 ) . given the morphology and the position of the bubble , we speculate that it was produced near the nuclear region , either by a nuclear starburst or the agn . if the bubble s total amount of thermal and gravitational energy is obtained from a starburst , it takes a time of @xmath104 to form the present structure , where @xmath105 is a geometrical factor taken to be 0.1 to reflect a fractional star formation rate of the central 1 kpc in the disk .",
    "this timescale is typical for massive stars to become sn explosions . on the other hand , assuming the flux density of the agn follows @xmath59 between the radio and x - ray bands , the total bolometric luminosity over this frequency range is @xmath106 with @xmath107 adopted (   [ subsec : nucleus ] ) .",
    "it is uncertain what fraction of the agn energy can be taken to energize the ambient gas , but we consider the agn might also be capable of producing this feature .",
    "for example , the locations of the north bubble and south extension immediately on either side of the nucleus are reminiscent of extraplanar loops or lobes seen in nuclear outflow galaxies like ngc  3079 ( e.g. cecil et al .",
    "2002 ) which is known to have an agn .",
    "cm    -2 cm",
    "[ sec : summary ] we have analyzed an _",
    "xmm - newton _  observation of the massive edge - on sb galaxy ngc  2613 .",
    "we find a deeply embedded agn in this galaxy .",
    "the x - ray spectrum of this agn can be characterized by a power - law model with a photon - index of @xmath132 and a 0.3 - 10 kev intrinsic luminosity of 3.3@xmath0 .",
    "linking the x - ray spectral properties of the agn with the current upper limit at radio frequencies indicates a spectral flattening of the agn at low frequencies .",
    "the 0.5 - 2 kev unresolved x - ray emission is found to closely trace the near - ir emission in the disk region , and the x - ray to near - ir luminosity ratio is consistent with that inferred from galactic lmxbs .",
    "these two facts together indicate that the bulk of the unresolved emission is produced by the old stellar population of the galaxy , predominantly lmxbs .",
    "a few extraplanar diffuse x - ray features are present in addition to the collective emission from discrete sources traced by the near - ir light .",
    "these features can be explained by the presence of hot gas , which can be spectrally characterized by a two - temperature plasma with @xmath51 @xmath130.08 kev and @xmath130.8 kev .",
    "the total x - ray luminosity of hot gas is at least an order of magnitude lower than that predicted by current simulations of igm accretion based on disk galaxy formation models .",
    "thus the extraplanar features are very unlikely to result from igm accretion .    instead , morphologically",
    "most of these extraplanar features have extended radio counterparts , which are believed to arise from disk - related events .",
    "also , energetically the extraplanar features can be generated by either supernova explosions or the agn , the latter possibly related to the bubbles above and below the nucleus . therefore , we conclude that the extraplanar features are most likely formed from outflows from the galactic disk .",
    "our observation suggests that a proper inclusion of galactic feedback is essential , not only to understanding galaxy formation , but also to its continued evolution .",
    "ngc  2613 and galaxies like it provide nearby laboratories that may help to understand the over - cooling problem existing in current galaxy formation simulations .",

    "<S> the remaining unresolved emission is primarily due to extraplanar hot gas . </S>",
    "<S> the luminosity of this gas is at least a factor of 10 less than that predicted by recent simulations of intergalactic gas accretion by such a massive galaxy with a circular rotation speed @xmath5 ( toft et al .  </S>",
    "<S> 2002 ) . instead , we find that the extraplanar hot gas most likely represents discrete extensions away from the disk , including two `` bubble - like '' features on either side of the nucleus . </S>",
    "<S> these extensions appear to correlate with radio continuum emission and , energetically , can be easily explained by outflows from the galactic disk . </S>"
