    "a quantum state transducer , that for instance transfers an optical state to a solid state , is an indispensable component contained in various types of quantum information processors . for instance , such a state transfer procedure is involved in every quantum memory architecture @xcite , which is typically used for building a quantum repeater in quantum communication networks @xcite . towards a systematic and effective design of state transfer protocol , in @xcite two of the authors developed a general theory for single - input and single - output ( siso ) passive linear quantum systems @xcite",
    "; the result obtained is that the input state encoded in an appropriately shaped wave function can be perfectly transferred to the system .",
    "a remarkable fact is that such a wave function can be completely characterized in terms of the zeros of the transfer function of the system , which thus revealed a close connection between systems and control theory and the important task in quantum information science .",
    "based on this background , in this paper , we aim to extend the result of @xcite to the case of multi - input and multi - output ( mimo ) general linear passive systems .",
    "in fact the memory systems studied in the above - referred papers @xcite are all mimo systems .",
    "also a hybridized system conducting frequency conversion between e.g. an optical cavity and a microwave circuit is essentially an mimo system @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "it is well known in classical systems and control theory @xcite that extending the notion of zeros from the siso case to the mimo case is quite nontrivial .",
    "this is because in the mimo case we are dealing with a transfer function _ matrix _ , and the zeros of this matrix can have several definitions ; for instance , a _ transmission zero _ is defined as a complex number at which the rank of the transfer function matrix drops , while a _ blocking zero _ is a complex number at which the transfer function matrix becomes a zero matrix .",
    "therefore , the goal of this paper is to deduce the condition for perfect state transfer and how that condition can be characterized by the zeros of the transfer function matrix .",
    "_ notation : _ for a matrix @xmath0 , the symbols @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 represent its hermitian conjugate , transpose , and complex conjugation in elements of @xmath4 , respectively ; i.e. , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 . for a matrix of operators we use the same notation , in which case @xmath8",

    "let us consider the following mimo passive linear quantum system @xcite : @xmath10 here @xmath11^\\top$ ] is the vector of system annihilation operators .",

    "finally @xmath21 is a @xmath22 unitary matrix , representing the scattering process of @xmath23 .    in the state transfer problem considered in this paper ,",
    "we assume that the input is given by a continuous - mode single - photon field state .",
    "this state is defined in terms of the following annihilation and creation process operators : @xmath24 @xmath25 is an associated function in @xmath26 , representing the shape of the optical pulse field .",

    "in the previous section we found that , in the general setup , the field state can be perfectly transferred to the system state . that is , although engineering the entangled single - photon state is challenging in experiment , perfect state transfer is in principle _ always _ possible .",

    "that is , if the system has a transmission ( or more strongly blocking ) zero , then an appropriately chosen input can make the output always zero .",
    "the point here is that the passive linear quantum system always has a transmission zero as shown in fact  3 , and this is the reason why the field state is perfectly absorbed into the system .",
    "thus the questions arising here are how the pulse function can be represented in terms of zeros of the system , and what field state represented in terms of zeros can be perfectly transferred .    to answer these questions let us recall facts  1 and 3 .",
    "that is , the system always has a transmission zero @xmath44 satisfying @xmath43 with @xmath59 the corresponding transmission - zero vector , and this satisfies the eigen - equation @xmath70 with @xmath60 the corresponding eigenvector .",
