    "turbulence allows for an efficient conversion of kinetic energy into heat . in general , in the presence of external heat - sources , the influence of this heat - production is small , and few studies have considered how these heat fluctuations are exactly redistributed over scales by the turbulent flow itself . in a recent work , @xcite ,",
    "addressed the question how this heat generation influences the wavenumber spectrum of heat fluctuations , using the eddy - damped quasi - normal markovian ( edqnm ) model , combined with an ad - hoc , spectrally local model .",
    "unfortunately , in the important case of a spatially uniform temperature distribution , their model predicts zero frictional heat production , which is at odds with the physics of turbulent flows , where heat fluctuations are produced as soon as the instantaneous viscous dissipation is not uniform in space . in the present manuscript",
    "we will derive an edqnm model of the heat fluctuation production which is more generally applicable , since it is independent of the initial distribution of temperature fluctuations .",
    "the problem we will consider is conceptually the simplest possible setting in which a non - trivial effect due to the heat generation by turbulent dissipation can be observed : statistically isotropic and stationary incompressible turbulence , governed by the navier - stokes equations .",
    "the viscous dissipation of kinetic energy is a heat source , and the advection of this scalar , the temperature , will be considered passive , ignoring the influence of thermal expansion of the fluid elements .",
    "it will be shown later that the temperature fluctuations are in most situations small , so that this assumption seems very reasonable .",
    "the heat diffusion coefficient @xmath0 , dynamic viscosity @xmath1 and density @xmath2 are assumed to be uniform and constant .",
    "the temperature is then governed by the following equation , @xmath3 with @xmath4 the specific heat , which we will assume to be constant , and where the viscous stress tensor @xmath5 is given , for a newtonian fluid , by @xmath6 and @xmath7 combining these expressions we obtain ( @xcite ) , @xmath8 with @xmath9 the kinematic viscosity .",
    "the velocity @xmath10 and temperature @xmath11 are functions of space @xmath12 and time @xmath13 , but this dependence will be omitted from the notation unless more than one different space locations or time - instants appear in the same expression . introducing the reynolds decomposition , @xmath14 , with @xmath15 the average temperature and @xmath16 the fluctuation , we find the following equation for the mean temperature .",
    "@xmath17 with @xmath18 the mean dissipation rate and where the overlined quantities denote averages . clearly , the average temperature increases since no heat - sinks exist in our system . in a statistically stationary turbulent flow , where @xmath18 is constant",
    ", the mean temperature will thus increase linearly in time .",
    "the equation for the fluctuations is @xmath19 the variance of the temperature fluctuations is then given by @xmath20 note that the second term in expression ( 2.11 ) of @xcite , is zero due to homogeneity and the last term is not complete since their basic equation ( 2.1 ) is not correct .",
    "this does not change the rest of their analysis , which did not explicitly use this information , but it is important if one wants to derive a model analytically from the governing equations , as we will do in the following section .",
    "the temperature distribution over different lenghtscales is given by the temperature spectrum , defined such that @xmath21 which implies , due to homogeneity and isotropy , @xmath22 with @xmath23 the fourier transform of the temperature fluctuation .",
    "the equation for @xmath24 is straightforwardly derived from ( [ eq : theta ] ) , @xmath25 with @xmath26 the fourier transform of the velocity fluctuation .",
    "this equation is unclosed and three triple correlations need to be determined before we can integrate ( [ eq : unclosed ] ) . in @xcite , the first correlation ,",
    "@xmath27 was modeled by classic edqnm theory ( @xcite ) .",
    "the second correlation was modeled by the ad - hoc model , @xmath28 as stated in the introduction , model ( [ wrongmodel ] ) can not be used in the case of a uniform temperature distribution . in that case",
    "the temperature fluctuations will stay zero forever , because the above model for the production is proportional to the spectrum @xmath24 .",
    "one could argue that the model can , perhaps , give correct results for the case in which the temperature spectrum is initially nonzero .",
    "this would however be fortuitous , since the temperature is supposed to be passive within our assumptions .",
    "it should therefore not have any influence on the injection rate of heat fluctuations .",
    "we will in the following section derive an edqnm model for the viscous production term of heat fluctuations . subsequently we will carry out simulations to show the temperature spectrum that results from this production term .",
    "we will compare these results to those obtained by @xcite .",
    "we use the procedure outlined in @xcite to derive the edqnm model for the triple correlations in equation ( [ eq : unclosed ] ) : first we derive a direct interaction approximation ( dia , @xcite ) of the triple correlation",
    ". then we modify the time - dependence to obtain a closure expression of the edqnm type .",
    "note that orszag already pointed out this relation between the eulerian dia equations and the edqnm equations for isotropic turbulence in the original paper ( @xcite ) .",
    "the idea behind the dia is the following : in the triple correlations that we are interested in , the turbulent fluctuations are expanded around a state @xmath29 , @xmath30 in which all but one particular triad are retained .",
    "the influence of this particular triad only is denoted @xmath31 , @xmath32 and is treated as a perturbation around the state @xmath29 , @xmath30 .",
    "the expansion is then truncated at the lowest non - vanishing order .",
    "the expressions for @xmath31 and @xmath32 are in the present case , @xmath33 and @xmath34 in which @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the nonlinear response functions of the velocity and temperature fluctuations , respectively .",
    "expression ( [ eq : u1 ] ) and the first line of ( [ eq : t1 ] ) are the standard dia contributions for the velocity and the scalar ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the second and third line of ( [ eq : t1 ] ) are the dia contribution to the scalar stemming from the frictional heat source nonlinearity .      the equation for the energy spectrum is equivalently closed by the edqnm model ( @xcite ) , @xmath61\\frac{dpdq}{pq}+f(k),\\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath62 a constant forcing term acting in the small wavenumber range and @xmath63 with @xmath64 it was shown in the past that the variance of the dissipation - rate fluctuations , involving fourth order correlations of the velocity field , was not correctly captured by dia related approaches ( @xcite ) .",
    "the present model involves the correlation between the dissipation - rate fluctuation and the temperature fluctuation .",
    "this is a mixed velocity - temperature third order correlation .",
    "in general , it seems that dia more reliably represents third than fourth order correlations , but a validation of the model ( [ eq : pedqnm ] ) by direct numerical simulation would be valuable , in particular since the modeled correlation involves the fluctuation of the dissipation rate .",
    "the goal is here to first derive expressions for the heat - fluctuation spectrum generated by frictional heating , by considering the evolution equation ( [ eq : detdt ] ) and the edqnm closure for the frictional heating term @xmath46 in this equation",
    ". then we will verify these analytical results by numerically integrating the closure equations . for our analytical considerations we will assume the energy spectrum to be constant in time and to obey kolmogorov scaling , @xmath65 , from the wavenumber corresponding to the integral scale down to the kolmogorov wavenumber @xmath66 .    to evaluate the convolution integral in ( [ eq : p0 ] ) , there are three distinct cases to consider .",
    "firstly , the convolution integral is dominated by local interactions .",
    "secondly , the integral is dominated by infrared nonlocal interactions @xmath67 .",
    "thirdly the integral is dominated by ultraviolet nonlinear interactions @xmath68 .",
    "we have verified the convolution integral analytically for all three types of contributions and we have found that in the case of a very long inertial range , the nonlocal interactions contribute insignificantly compared to the local interactions .",
    "we will therefore only consider the approximation of ( [ eq : detdt ] ) for the case of local interactions . in that case ( [ eq : p0 ] ) can be approximated by its dimensional estimate , @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the local estimate of the triad interaction time @xmath71 .",
    "if we suppose @xmath72 and we assume kolmogorov - scaling we find @xmath73 in the case of unit and large prandtl number , the diffusion will be small in the inertial - convective range , and we expect a balance to establish between the production term and the transfer term , @xmath74 this balance will indeed be observed in the numerical evaluation of the closure . in this range , it was shown ( @xcite ) that the scalar transfer can be qualitatively predicted by a kovaznay - type of gradient model , @xmath75 we find from ( [ eqpposs1 ] ) , ( [ eq : pist ] ) and ( [ eq : kovaznay ] ) , @xmath76 integrating this spectrum up to the kolmogorov scale we have , @xmath77 in a steady state , the total production will be balanced by the scalar dissipation , so that , @xmath78 assuming a scaling of the production spectrum of the form ( [ eqpposs1 ] ) up to the kolmogorov scale @xmath79 , we have @xmath80 which shows that in the limit @xmath81 , @xmath82 this means that in the limit of vanishingly small viscosity , both the mean - square heat fluctuations and their dissipation tend to zero .      ) .",

    "we observe that the main part of the production is locally ( in wavenumber ) dissipated by the diffusion .",
    "the transfer term allows for a small transfer of temperature variance towards smaller scales .",
    "but since the production takes mainly place in the diffusive range ( at unit prandtl number ) , the fluctuations do not survive long enough to be strained significantly by the velocity field , and the transfer is therefore confined to a small wavenumber span in the dissipation range .",

    "a further consequence of this assumption is that the mean - square temperature fluctuations should be proportional to @xmath94 .",

    "however , the triad - correlation timescale is in this case not given by ( [ eq : tauk ] ) , since at these scales the dynamics are now dominated by the diffusion of heat , so that @xmath101 and the production spectrum in the inertial - diffusive range will then be given by @xmath102 since the diffusion spectrum is @xmath103 we find from @xmath104 that @xmath105      the results for a large prandtl number simulation ( @xmath106 , @xmath107 ) are shown in figure [ fig:4 ] . the @xmath108 spectrum starts to appear but is not yet fully developed at this prandtl number . since the peak of the production mechanism remains fixed around @xmath79 , independently of the prandtl number , there is no reason why it should not become more pronounced at higher prandtl number .",

    "it was shown in the previous sections that according to the closure we derived , the generation of heat fluctuations is dominated by local interactions in wavenumber space .",
    "this allowed us to show that a simple , phenomenological model of the production is @xmath113 with @xmath114 comparing the form of the above model to the model of @xcite , the main difference is the absence of the heat fluctuation spectrum in ( [ eq : recallmodel ] ) . in the case of the model of @xcite ,",
    "the production term can not be determined independently from the temperature fluctuation distribution .",
    "all cases we considered in the present work would thus yield zero temperature fluctuations using that model .",
    "however , in the particular case of an initial heat - fluctuation spectrum , in the absence of further heat - sources and for very long times , it is possible to compare the predictions of the model of @xcite with the present case .",
    "for instance in the inertial - convective range we expect a balance between nonlinear - transfer of scalar fluctuations and production . combining expression ( [ eq : pist ] ) , ( [ eq : kovaznay ] ) and ( [ wrongmodel ] ) , we find in this particular case for the temperature fluctuation spectrum in the inertial - convective range ( assuming kolmogorov scaling ) , @xmath115 if we consider the low prandtl number case , balance ( [ eq : lowp ] ) should hold in the inertial range and the temperature spectrum will be proportional to @xmath116 as also proposed by @xcite .",
    "the predictions of their model for these particular cases are therefore in agreement with the results of our edqnm model .",
    "this might seem surprising , given the fact that the model does not give physical results for the basic case in which no initial fluctuations are present .",
    "we note however that all the models of the form @xmath117 will give the same steady - state inertial - convective range behavior , independent of the value of @xmath118 . the only choice predicting a non - zero production in the absence of initial fluctuations is @xmath119 .",
    "the value that will give correct scaling in the inertial - diffusive range , at low prandtl number is @xmath120 corresponding to the model of @xcite .",
    "it is therefore not possible to find a model of the form ( [ eq : modgamma ] ) which gives behaviour in agreement with both ( [ eq : ethighp ] ) and ( [ eq : etlowp ] ) and which predicts nonzero production in the absence of initial fluctuations .",
    "the simplest phenomenological model that satisfies these criteria is ( [ eq : recallmodel ] ) , involving a timescale which can mimic both diffusive and inertial behaviour .",
    "we note that as soon as initial heat fluctuations are present in the considered flow , as is a prerequisite for ( [ wrongmodel ] ) to generate heat , the distribution of these fluctuations will determine the instantaneous heat generation and all transients will be affected by this .",
    "the influence of these unphysical transients can be very long if the initial heat fluctuations are present in the largest flow scales , which decay slowly .",
    "an edqnm model for the heat - production term due to viscous friction is derived .",
    "temperature wavenumber spectra are deduced from this closure . in particular , it is shown that the heat - production is mainly generated through local triad interactions .",
    "the heat production spectrum is then proportional to @xmath90 . balancing this production spectrum against nonlinear transfer , we find the heat - spectrum for unit and large prandtl number in the inertial - convective subrange . in the very diffusive case ( very small prandtl number )",
    ", the production is in equilibrium with the diffusivity spectrum , leading to a different wavenumber dependence .",
    "the predictions are @xmath121    now that we have obtained these expressions for the heat - fluctuation spectra , it is possible to estimate how large the fluctuations are in reality . expression ( [ eq : t2re ] ) shows that , assuming kolmogorov scaling , we have @xmath122 let us consider typical values for @xmath4 and @xmath87 . for a gas such as air , @xmath123 , @xmath124 . in order to observe heat - fluctuations of the order of @xmath125 , a dissipation rate of the order of @xmath126",
    "is needed . combining this with equation ( [ eq : meantemp ] )",
    ", this implies that the mean temperature of the gas increases at a rate of @xmath127 . for a typical liquid such as water , this increase is even larger .",
    "this example illustrates the smallness of the temperature variance in practice .",
    "it does not seem to us that in a practical situation in which the temperature of a fluid increases by @xmath128 every second , fluctuations of the order of a millikelvin are of major importance .    note that the scalings ( [ expressions2-b ] ) are observed approximately from the numerically integrated closure expressions .",
    "we stress that these are the results which are given within the framework of the edqnm assumptions and the model cures for the defect of a previous model proposition which excluded heat - fluctuation generation in the absence of initial fluctuations ( @xcite ) .",
    "a validation of the edqnm model for the heat production and a verification of the proposed scalings ( [ expressions2-b ] ) using high resolution direct numerical simulations of isotropic turbulence would certainly be valuable , in particular since dia and edqnm might have difficulties in representing correlations involving fluctuations of the dissipation rate .",
