    "over the last three decades or so , a revolution has happened in the development of science .",
    "we are talking about chaos theory @xcite . in the chaotic regime",
    ", the behavior of a deterministic system appears random .",
    "this finding has forced many experimentalists to re - examine their data to determine whether some of the random behaviors attributed to noise are due to deterministic chaos instead .",
    "chaos theory has been successfully applied to many scientific and practical situations @xcite .    in the philosophical realm , however , the importance of this development was that chaos theory seemed to offer scientists the hope that almost `` any '' random behavior observed in nature could be described using low - dimensional chaotic systems .",
    "random - looking information gathered in the past ( and shelved because it was assumed to be too complicated ) perhaps could now be explained in terms of simple laws .",
    "the known chaotic systems are not random @xcite .",
    "if the previous values of a time - series determine the future values , then even if the dynamical behavior is chaotic , the future may , to some extent , be predicted from the behavior of past values that are similar to those of the present .",
    "the so - called `` unpredictability '' in the known chaotic systems is the result of the sensitive dependence on initial conditions .",
    "it is not an absolute unpredictability .",
    "truly random systems are different from the chaotic ones .",
    "past sequences of values of a random dynamical variable that are similar to present ones tell as much or little about the next value as about the next hundredth value . the so - called nonlinear forecasting methods for distinguishing chaos from random time - series",
    "are based on these ideas @xcite .",
    "recently , we have introduced explicit functions that produce truly random sequences @xcite .",
    "for instance , let us define the function : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a real number and @xmath2 is a parameter .    for an integer @xmath3",
    "this is the solution to some chaotic maps @xcite ( see fig .",
    "1(a ) ) . for a non - integer @xmath1 , function ( [ exp1 ] ) can produce truly unpredictable random sequences whose values are independent .    functions ( [ exp1 ] ) with non - integer @xmath1 can not be expressed as a map of type @xmath4    in the present letter we address the following question : can an autonomous dynamical system with several variables produce a random dynamics similar to that of function ( [ exp1 ] ) ? we will present several dynamical systems with this kind of behavior . we will report the results of real experiments with nonlinear circuits , which contain direct evidence for this new phenomenon .",
    "we discuss some applications .",
    "let us discuss first some properties of function ( [ exp1 ] ) .",
    "we will present here a short proof of the fact that the sequences generated by functions ( [ exp1 ] ) are unpredictable from the previous values .",
    "this proof is presented here for the first time . however",
    ", a more detailed discussion of the properties of these functions ( including statistical tests ) can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "let @xmath1 be a rational number expressed as @xmath5 , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are relative prime numbers .",
    "we are going to show that if we have @xmath8 numbers generated by function ( [ exp1 ] ) : @xmath9 ( @xmath10 can be as large as we wish ) , then the next value @xmath11 is still unpredictable .",
    "this is valid for any string of @xmath8 numbers .",
    "let us define the following family of sequences : @xmath12   , \\label{exp3}%\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is an integer .",
    "the parameter @xmath13 distinguishes the different sequences .    for all sequences parametrized by @xmath13 , the first @xmath8 values are the same .",
    "this is so because @xmath14   = \\sin^{2}\\left [   \\pi\\theta_{0}\\left ( \\frac{p}{q}\\right )   ^{n}\\right ]   , \\label{exp4}%\\ ] ] for all @xmath15 .",
    "note that the number @xmath16 is an integer for @xmath15 .",
    "so we can have infinite sequences with the same first @xmath8 values .",
    "nevertheless , the next value @xmath17 \\label{exp5}%\\ ] ] is uncertain .    in general , @xmath18 can take @xmath7 different values .",
    "these @xmath7 values can be as different as @xmath19 or @xmath20 . from the observation of the previous values @xmath9",
    ", there is no method for determining the next value .",
    "this result shows that for a given set of initial conditions , there exists always an infinite number of values of @xmath2 that satisfy those initial conditions .",
    "the time - series produced for different values of @xmath2 satisfying the initial conditions is different in most of the cases",
    ". even if the initial conditions are exactly the same , the following values are completely different .",
    "this property is , in part , related to the fact that the equation @xmath21 , where @xmath22 , possesses infinite solutions for @xmath2 .",
    "we should stress that from the observation of a string of values @xmath23 generated by function ( [ exp1 ] ) it is impossible to determine which value of @xmath2 was used .",
    "figures 1(a ) and 1(b ) show the first - return maps for @xmath24 and @xmath25 .    for @xmath1 irrational",
    "( we exclude the numbers of type @xmath26 ) , the numbers generated by function ( [ exp1 ] ) are completely independent ( see fig .",
    "2(a ) that shows the first - return map for @xmath27 ) . after any string of @xmath8 numbers @xmath9 , the next outcome @xmath11 can take infinite different values .",
    "the numbers produced by function ( [ exp1 ] ) are random but are not distributed uniformly .",
    "the probability density behaves as @xmath28 .",
    "if we need uniformly distributed random numbers , we should make the following transformation @xmath29 . in this case",
    "@xmath30 ( see fig .",
    "2(b ) ) .",
    "it is important to mention here that the argument of function ( [ exp1 ] ) does not need to be exponential all the time , for @xmath31 .",
    "in fact , a set of finite sequences ( where each element - sequence is unpredictable , and the law for producing a new element - sequence can not be obtained from the observations ) can form an infinite unpredictable sequence .",
    "see the discussion in the following paragraph .",
    "so if we wish to produce random sequences of very long length , we can determine a new value of parameter @xmath2 after a finite number @xmath32 of values of @xmath33 .",
    "this procedure can be repeated the desired number of times .",
    "it is important to have a nonperiodic method for generating the new value of @xmath2 .",
    "for example , we can use the following method in order to change the parameter @xmath2 after each set of @xmath32 sequence values .",
    "let us define @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is produced by a chaotic map of the form @xmath36 ; @xmath37 is the order number of @xmath2 in a way that @xmath38 corresponds to the @xmath2 used for the first set of @xmath32 values of @xmath33 , @xmath39 for the second set , etc .",
    "the inequality @xmath40 should hold to ensure the absolute unpredictability . in this case , from the observation of the values @xmath33 , it is impossible to determine the real value of @xmath2 .    after a careful analysis of functions ( [ exp1 ] ) ,",
    "we arrive at the preliminary conclusion that ( to produce unpredictable dynamics ) the main characteristics for any functions are the following : the function should be able to be re - written in the form @xmath41 where the argument function @xmath42 grows exponentially and the function @xmath43 should be finite and periodic .",
    "this result allows us to generalize this behavior to other functions as the following @xmath44 where @xmath45 is a periodic function .",
    "however , a more deep analysis shows that ( to produce complex behavior ) the function @xmath46 does not have to be exponential all the time , and function @xmath43 does not have to be periodic .",
    "in fact , it is sufficient for function @xmath46 to be a finite nonperiodic oscillating function which possesses repeating intervals with finite exponential behavior .",
    "for instance , this can be a chaotic function .",
    "on the other hand , function @xmath43 should be noninvertible .",
    "in other words , it should have different maxima and minima in such a way that equation @xmath47 ( for some specific interval of @xmath48 , @xmath49 ) possesses several solutions for @xmath50 .",
    "the following autonomous dynamical system can produce truly random dynamics : @xmath51 @xmath52 @xmath53    here @xmath54 can be an irrational number , @xmath55 , @xmath56 .",
    "we can note that for @xmath57 , the behavior of function @xmath58 is exactly like that of function ( [ exp1 ] ) .",
    "for @xmath59 the dynamics is reinjected to the region @xmath57 with a new initial condition . while @xmath33 is in the interval @xmath57 ,",
    "the dynamics of @xmath58 is unpredictable as it is function ( [ exp1 ] ) .",
    "thus , the process of producing a new initial condition through the equation ( [ exp9 ] ) is random .    if the only observable is @xmath58 , then it is impossible to predict the next values of this sequence using only the knowledge of the past values .",
    "an example of the dynamics produced by the dynamical system ( [ exp8])-([exp10 ] ) is shown in fig .",
    "if we apply the nonlinear forecasting method analysis to a common chaotic system , then the prediction error increases with the number of time - steps into the future . on the other hand , when we apply this method to the time - series produced by system ( [ exp8])-([exp10 ] ) , the prediction error is independent of the time - steps into the future , as in the case of a random sequence .",
    "other very strong methods@xcite , which allow to distinguish between chaos and random noise , produce the same result .    here",
    "we should make an important remark .",
    "mathematical models can be of different types .",
    "for instance , natural phenomena can be described by differential equations , difference equations , cellular automata , neural networks , etc .",
    "even explicit functions can be mathematical models .",
    "if we consider function ( [ exp1 ] ) as the mathematical model of some dynamical process , then this process can be completely random .",
    "if all we know is the series of outcomes @xmath60 , then it does not matter how many values we already have , the next value is unpredictable .",
    "however ,  this is because from the observation of the values @xmath61 , it is impossible to determine the `` variable '' @xmath62 .",
    "this could be considered as a `` hidden variable '' . of course",
    ", we can not say that this is just a problem of hidden variables , because not for any hidden variable @xmath63 , the function @xmath64 is a random system . here",
    "we have obtained necessary conditions for this phenomenon to occur .",
    "let us extend this analysis to the dynamical system ( [ exp8])-([exp10 ] ) . in this case",
    "the completely random variable is @xmath58 .",
    "the role of `` hidden variable '' is played by @xmath33 .",
    "if one could observe the series @xmath33 , then the complete randomness of the data set is lost .",
    "we could say that some projection of the complete set of variables onto a proper subset is necessary for the effect .",
    "it is important to notice that the dynamical system ( [ exp8])-([exp10 ] ) is a well - posed set of difference equations with unique forward time evolution . given the initial conditions ( @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 ) , the future evolution of the dynamics is fully determined .",
    "however , if the only observable is @xmath58 , then this variable will behave as a completely random time - series .",
    "how can one reconcile the unique forward time evolution with this randomness ?",
    "the answer is related to the fact that only a subset of the variables are observed .    with this result",
    "we are uncovering a new mechanism for generating random dynamics .",
    "this is a fundamental result because it is very important to understand different mechanisms by which the natural systems can produce truly random ( not only chaotic ) dynamics .",
    "there is a large literature dedicated to pseudorandom number generators ( see e.g. @xcite and references quoted therein ) . a very fine theory has been developed in this area and this theory has produced many important results .",
    "however , we should say here that the known pseudorandom number generators are not supposed to generate truly random numbers .",
    "in his important review article @xcite , james says : `` truly random numbers are unpredictable in advance and must be produced by a random physical process , such as radioactive decay '' .",
    "in fact , pseudorandom numbers are produced using recurrence relations , and are therefore not truly random @xcite .",
    "dsouza et al @xcite say in their paper : `` pseudorandom number generators are at best a practical substitute , and should be generally tested for the absence of undesired correlations '' .",
    "many known pseudorandom number generators are based on maps of type : @xmath68    now we will present the maps behind some of the most famous and best pseudorandom number generators .    _",
    "multiplicative linear congruential generators _",
    "@xcite are defined by the following equation : @xmath69    some famous values for these parameters are the following : @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 ; @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath72 ; @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 ; @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath72 ; @xmath80 , @xmath76 , @xmath72 ( this is the best generator for @xmath76 , according to the criteria of knuth @xcite ) .",
    "the _ fibonacci - like generators _ obey the following equation : @xmath81 where @xmath82 is some binary or logical operation .",
    "for instance , @xmath82 can be addition , subtraction or exclusive - or .",
    "other _ extended algorithms _ use equations as the following : @xmath83    the _ add - and - carry generators _ are defined as : @xmath84    among the high quality generators investigated in the famous paper @xcite are the following @xmath85 @xmath86 @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the bitwise exclusive or operator , @xmath89 here for @xmath90 , @xmath72 , and for @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath77 .",
    "all known generators ( in some specific physical calculations ) give rise to incorrect results because they deviate from randomness @xcite .",
    "the problem is that these algorithms are predictable .",
    "an example of this can be found in the work of ferrenberg et al @xcite .",
    "they found that high quality pseudorandom number generators can yield incorrect answers due to subtle correlations between the generated numbers .",
    "suppose we have an ideal generator for truly random numbers . in this case ,",
    "no matter how many numbers we have generated , the value of the next number will be still unknown .",
    "that is , there is no way to write down a formula that will give the value of the next number in terms of the previous numbers , no matter how many numbers have been already generated .",
    "the authors of paper @xcite related the errors in the simulations to the dependence in the generated numbers .",
    "indeed , they are all based on maps of type ( [ exp19 ] ) .    in the present paper",
    "we have shown that both the sequence of numbers @xmath33 defined by function ( [ exp1 ] ) and the sequence of numbers @xmath58 defined by the dynamical system ( [ exp8])-([exp10 ] ) can not be expressed as a map of type ( [ exp19 ] ) .",
    "in fact , these numbers are unpredictable and the next value can not be determined as a function of the previous values .",
    "recently , simulations of different physical systems have become the `` strongest '' tests for pseudorandom number generators . among these systems",
    "are the following : the two - dimensional ising model @xcite , ballistic deposition @xcite , and random walks @xcite .",
    "nogus et al @xcite have found that using common pseudorandom number generators , the produced random walks present symmetries , meaning that the generated numbers are not independent .        on the other hand ,",
    "the logarithmic plot of the mean distance versus the number of steps @xmath32 is not a straight line ( as expected theoretically ) after @xmath93 ( in fact , it is a rapidly decaying function ) .",
    "dsouza et al @xcite use ballistic deposition to test the randomness of pseudorandom number generators .",
    "they found correlations in the pseudorandom numbers and strong coupling between the model and the generators ( even generators that pass extensive statistical tests ) .",
    "one consequence of the kardar - parisi - zhang theory is that the steady state behavior for the interface fluctuations ( in ballistic deposition in one dimension ) should resemble a random walk .",
    "thus , a random walk again serves as a good test for pseudorandom numbers .",
    "we have produced random walks using the numbers generated by our systems .",
    "the produced random walks possess the correct properties , including the mean distance behavior @xmath94 .",
    "the present paper is not about random number generators . in the present paper",
    "we discuss a new phenomenon : the fact that unperturbed physical systems can produce truly random dynamics .",
    "of course , one of the applications of this phenomenon is random number generation .    the art of random number generation requires more than the randomness of the generated numbers .",
    "it requires good programming skills and techniques to obtain the desired distributions for the numbers .",
    "the functions and systems described in this paper can be used to create very good random number generators .",
    "algorithms designed for this purpose along with the statistical tests will be published elsewhere .    in this section",
    "we only wished to present a theoretical comparison between the sequences produced by the pseudorandom - number - generator algorithms ( [ exp19])-([exp27 ] ) and the systems described in the present paper .",
    "when the input is a normal chaotic signal and the system is an electronic circuit with the i - v characteristics shown in figures 4 and 5 , then the output will be a very complex signal .        in ref .",
    "@xcite a theory of nonlinear circuits is presented . there",

    "we have constructed a circuit similar to the one shown in fig .",
    "we produced chaotic time - series using a common nonlinear map and then we transformed them into analog signals using a converter .",
    "this analog signals were introduced as the voltage - input to the circuit shown in fig .",
    "similar results are obtained when we take the input signal from a chaotic electronic circuit .",

    "are shown in figures 8(a ) and 8(b ) .",
    "when the nonlinear circuit has an i - v characteristic with many more maxima and minima , e.g. fig . 5 ( and this can be done in practice , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , we can produce a much more complex dynamics .",
    "nonlinear chaotic circuits can be described successfully by discrete maps as the equations ( [ exp11])-([exp13 ] ) ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , in some cases it can be very helpful to have a physical situation with a model based on a set of well - posed ordinary differential equations .    in ref .",

    "6 is a function with many extrema , the produced time - series is more complex ( see fig .",

    "a nonlinear physical system constructed with chaotic circuits and a josephson junction @xcite can be an ideal experimental setup for the random dynamics that we are presenting here .",
    "it is well - known that the current in a josephson junction may be written as @xmath122 where @xmath123 here @xmath124 is the phase and @xmath125 is the voltage across the junction .",
    "note that nature has provided us with a phenomenon where the sine - function is intrinsic .",

    "so we think this is a good name for the present phenomenon .",
    "on one hand , deterministic randomness implies that if there is a phenomenon in the world ( whose mechanism from first principles is not known ) described by a dynamical system of type ( [ exp8])-([exp10 ] ) or ( [ exp11])-([exp13 ] ) , and the only observable is a physical variable as @xmath58 , then the law of this phenomenon can not be learnt from the experimental data , or the observations . and , situations in which the fundamental law should be inferred from the observations alone have not been uncommon in physics .    on the other hand ,",
