    "recent investigations for the infrared ( ir ) dynamics of yang - mills theory based on various methods converge to a consistent picture for the gluon and faddeev - popov ghost propagators : in the framework of euclidean @xmath5 yang - mills theory with the manifestly lorentz covariant gauge fixing , the transverse gluon propagator in the landau gauge vanishes in the ir limit @xmath6 , @xmath7 while the faddeev - popov ghost propagator is enhanced in the ir limit : @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are respectively defined by the gluon propagator in the landau gauge and the ghost propagator with unbroken color symmetry as    @xmath11    with @xmath12 and the transverse projection operator , @xmath13    such behaviors of the gluon and ghost propagators were first derived by gribov @xcite long ago as a result of restricting the region of functional integration over the gluon field to the interior of the gribov horizon in order to avoid gribov copies .",
    "indeed , he obtained the result : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a mass scale called the gribov mass .",
    "subsequently , zwanziger @xcite has obtained the exact analytic result that the restriction of the gribov horizon enforced by a horizon condition yields @xmath16    recent studies @xcite of the coupled sd equation for the gluon and ghost propagators have reached a conclusion that , in the ir limit @xmath6 , the gluon form factor @xmath17 and ghost form factor @xmath18 defined by @xmath19 exhibit the power behavior characterized by an ir critical exponent @xmath20 : @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are @xmath24-independent constants , and @xmath20 takes the value between 1/2 and 1 depending on the approximations adopted to write down the solvable sd equation ( gribov s result corresponds to @xmath25 .",
    "however , the aim of this paper is not to obtain the precise value of @xmath20 . ) .",
    "these ir asymptotic solutions should be compared with the ultraviolet ( uv ) asymptotic solutions obtained by perturbation theory : @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are @xmath24-independent constants and , at one - loop level , the exponents @xmath29 and @xmath30 are independent of the number of colors @xmath31 in @xmath5 yang - mills theory , i.e. , @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "this type of solutions with logarithmic dependence on momenta can also be derived as the uv asymptotic solution to the sd equation , see @xcite .",
    "it is possible to explain how gribov s old result is compatible with the recent ir solution of sd equation .",
    "gribov s prescription to cut off the functional integral at the first gribov horizon does not alter the sd equations of faddeev - popov theory , as pointed out by @xcite .",
    "the cut - off at the first gribov horizon assures that both the gluon and ghost propagators are positive , and that negative and oscillating solutions are excluded .",
    "indeed , the above ir solutions for the truncated sd equations are positive @xmath34 ,    moreover , the method of the stochastic quantization in its time - independent formulation indicates qualitatively the same result @xcite as the sd equation .",
    "recent numerical simulations on the lattice also support the above results , see e.g. , @xcite .",
    "the above result has an implication to the confinement problem . as an immediate consequence of the suppression of the gluon propagator in the ir limit ,",
    "gluon confinement is easily understood , since the would - be physical transverse gluon becomes short range and the massless gluon is absent from physical spectrum . on the other hand , infrared enhancement of ghost propagator",
    "suggests that the unphysical longitudinal gluon becomes long range and mediates the confining strong force , providing the linear confining potential , i.e. , quark confinement .",
    "more generally , it is worth remarking that the enhancement of the ghost propagator is consistent with a sufficient condition for color confinement ( confinement of all the color non - singlet objects ) due to kugo and ojima @xcite ( see @xcite ) : @xmath35 thus the precise information of the ir limit is quite important to elucidate the non - perturbative dynamics of yang - mills theory .    in this paper",
    ", we re - examine the truncated schwinger - dyson equation for the gluon and ghost propagators in yang - mills theory in the landau gauge , keeping these developments in mind .",
    "a purpose of paper is to point out that the above solution ( [ irsol ] ) is not the most general ir asymptotic solution of the truncated sd equation .",
    "another purpose is to understand why the quite different asymptotic solutions , i.e. , ir power solution and uv logarithmic solution in momentum space , can be obtained from the same sd equation . for this end , we study the ir and uv asymptotic solution on equal footing simultaneously by proposing a new ansatz and examine a possible logarithmic correction to the ir asymptotic power solution .    in the studies of sd equation",
    "so far @xcite , an ansatz for the solution , ( [ irsol ] ) or ( [ uvsol ] ) , was substituted into the sd equation and the power index and the coefficient are determined self - consistently by comparing both sides of sd equation . however",
    ", this procedure does not guarantee the uniqueness of the solution .",
    "moreover , improving the ir asymptotic solution was attempted by von smekal , hauck and alkofer @xcite and atkinson and bloch @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the truncated sd equation with bare vertex functions is satisfied by the asymptotic expansion ( according to the notation @xcite ) : @xmath36 where @xmath37 ( @xmath38 and @xmath39 ) and @xmath40 is a free parameter which can not be determined from the ir asymptotic expansion alone .",
    "the ir parameter @xmath40 is expected to be negative for the ir asymptotic solution to connect into the uv asymptotic solution ( in a very narrow transition region ) .",
    "the value was determined by numerical solution to be negative , @xmath41 , as expected .",
    "see @xcite for further information .    in this paper",
    ", we adopt another ansatz for asymptotic solutions which incorporates possible logarithmic dependence and can be applied to both ir region @xmath6 and uv region @xmath42 simultaneously : ) .",
    "moreover , we can also treat the region @xmath43",
    "( @xmath44 ) by changing the last series as @xmath45 ] @xmath46 with a new variable @xcite , @xmath47 where @xmath48 is an appropriate real number and @xmath49 is the renormalization group invariant momentum scale defined by @xmath50 $ ] for the renormalization scale @xmath51 using the @xmath0 function : @xmath52 . here",
    "the coefficients @xmath53 and @xmath54 can be expressed in terms of @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "the ir and uv asymptotic region corresponds to @xmath55 where the signature of @xmath56 depends on that of @xmath48 . note that these parameters are not all independent ( we can give a certain value for @xmath57 , e.g. , @xmath58 or @xmath59 , since it is negligible when @xmath60 ) .",
    "an advantage of this ansatz is that we can search for the possible ir and uv solutions simultaneously without discriminating the ir and uv region by specifying possible set of power indices and coefficients .",
    "in fact , we show that the above ansatz satisfies the truncated sd equation @xcite specified below , if the exponents satisfy either of the two relationships ,    @xmath61    where the relationships among @xmath62 are given later , since they are very complicated ( see appendix ) .",
    "it should be remarked again that these relations can be obtained without specifying the momentum region in question , by comparing the both sides of the respective sd equation .",
    "we must choose the appropriate solution as follows .",
    "the asymptotic uv solution is selected by requiring @xmath63 therefore , the first choice ( [ uv ] ) of parameters corresponds to the uv asymptotic solution : pure logarithmic solution without leading power behavior .",
    "indeed , the perturbative result @xmath32 and @xmath33 satisfies @xmath64 .",
    "another advantage is that the ir asymptotic solution allows the logarithmic correction to the power solution .",
    "it is shown below that the ir solution is identified with the second set of parameters ( [ ir ] ) ( @xmath65 ) : @xmath66 where @xmath67 and the coefficient @xmath62 can now be expressed by @xmath30 . irrespective of the value of @xmath30 , these solutions for @xmath68 behave as @xmath69 for @xmath70 , in particular , we have the ir suppressed vanishing gluon propagator and ir enhanced ghost propagator , irrespective of the presence or absence of the logarithmic correction .",
    "therefore , the existence of logarithmic correction does not change the expected ir physics at the ir limit @xmath6 .",
    "thus the new type of solution , even if it exists , does not destroy the argument in favor of color confinement mentioned above .",
    "if @xmath71 and @xmath72 for all @xmath73 , the solution in question reduces to the pure power solution known so far .",
    "the identification of the ir solution is done as follows .",
    "first of all , it should be remarked that all the solutions of sd equations are not allowed as physically meaningful solutions . to clarify this point",
    ", we examine the renormalized ( running ) gluon - ghost - antighost coupling constant defined by @xmath74 where @xmath75 is renormalization group invariant in the landau gauge , since @xmath76 .",
    "the above ansatz yields the running coupling @xmath77 @xmath78 the first set of parameters leads to @xmath79 which vanishes in both uv @xmath42 and ir limit @xmath6 . to be consistent with the uv asymptotic freedom , the running coupling must become zero at @xmath80 and grows as @xmath81 decreases .",
    "therefore , the running coupling ( [ rc1 ] ) can be identified with the uv solution . however , if we adopt this solution also as the ir solution , the running coupling must vanish at @xmath82 again .",
    "this identification leads to the multi - valued @xmath0 function .",
    "hence , the first set can not correspond to the ir solution .",
    "functions @xmath83 with an infrared fixed point at @xmath84 corresponding to the ir power solution in the absence ( left ) and presence ( right ) of logarithmic correction . ]    on the other hand , the second choice @xmath85 converges to a finite and non - zero value in both uv @xmath42 and ir limit @xmath6 irrespective of @xmath86 . hence this is not accepted as the uv solution .",
    "identification with the ir solution implies that @xmath87 is nothing but the ir stable fixed point for arbitrary values of @xmath88 . as @xmath24 increases towards the uv region from the ir fixed value at @xmath89 , therefore",
    ", the running coupling must bend below to smoothly connect into the uv logarithmic solution .",
    "this effect can be seen by taking into account the power series in @xmath90 . for this purpose",
    ", the parameters @xmath91 and @xmath92 must satisfy @xmath93 , provided that @xmath94 .",
    "incidentally , the ir diverging running coupling constant does not appear from the solutions subject to the above relationship of parameters .",
    "the uv behavior is characterized by the @xmath0 function , @xmath95 with @xmath96 . in the neighborhood of ir",
    "fixed point @xmath84 , the beta function @xmath97 behaves as follows ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : betafunc ] ) .",
    "the power solution with power correction ( [ absolution ] ) leads to @xmath98 and @xmath99 , while the power solution with logarithmic correction ( [ kondosolution ] ) yields @xmath100 and @xmath101 . the difference can not be seen in the @xmath75 vs. @xmath102 plot , since @xmath103 at @xmath89 in both cases .",
    "however , in the @xmath75 vs. @xmath24 plot , the logarithmic correction implies @xmath104 at @xmath89 , in contrast to the power solution @xmath105 at @xmath89 .",
    "the data of numerical simulation available seem to be still insufficient to discriminate between two cases . in this paper , therefore , we examine the ir behavior in the analytical way .",
    "for simplicity of analysis , we restrict our consideration to a version of the truncated sd equation adopted by atkinson and bloch @xcite using the bare vertex functions , since qualitatively the same ir behavior was obtained also from the solutions of the truncated sd equations using the full vertex function improved so as to be consistent with the slavnov - taylor identity .",
    "the truncation is done as follows .",
    "we include all diagrams in the ghost equation , while we neglect contributions from the two - loop diagrams in the gluon equation .",
    "the gluon equation was contracted with the brown - pennington projection operator @xcite @xmath106 which removes the tadpole term .",
    "therefore , the quadratic uv divergence can be removed by this projection .",
    "finally , the non - trivial contribution in the gluon equation comes from only two diagrams , i.e. , gluon loop and ghost loop , apart from the tree gluon propagator .",
    "we include only the bare triple gluon vertex and the bare gluon - ghost - antighost vertex .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig : sdeq ] .    moreover ,",
    "in order to avoid angular integration , we adopt the approximation called the @xmath107-max approximation , @xmath108 , @xmath109 . here the angle @xmath110 comes from the inner product @xmath111 between the external momenta @xmath24 and the internal momenta @xmath112 which is to be integrated out .",
    "thus we can write explicitly down the coupled sd equation each of which is the one - dimensional integral equation .",
    ", i.e. , @xmath25 .",
    "this value agrees with the gribov prediction .",
    "recently , it has been shown @xcite that the value of @xmath20 is decreased between 0.5 and 0.6 due to the renormalization effect of the triple gluon interaction vertex which is necessary to reproduce the correct coefficient of @xmath0 function in the uv limit . ]    introducing the renormalization constants for the gluon field @xmath113 , the ghost field @xmath114 , the triple gluon vertex @xmath115 and the gluon - ghost - antighost vertex @xmath116 , we write down the sd equation for the renormalized gluon and ghost form factors . by introducing @xmath117 , @xmath118 and @xmath119 , the ghost sd equation reads @xmath120 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] while the gluon sd equation reads @xmath121   \\nonumber\\\\ & + { n_c \\over 3}\\lambda { z}_1 \\big [   { 7f(x ) \\over 2x^3 } \\int_{0}^{x } dy y^2",

    "<S> we examine the possibility that there may exist a logarithmic correction to the infrared asymptotic solution with power behavior which has recently been found for the gluon and faddeev - popov ghost propagators in the landau gauge . we propose a new ansatz to find a pair of solutions for the gluon and ghost form factors by solving the coupled schwinger - dyson equation under a simple truncation . </S>",
    "<S> this ansatz enables us to derive the infrared and ultraviolet asymptotic solutions simultaneously and to understand why the power solution and the logarithmic solution is possible only in the infrared and ultraviolet limit respectively . even in the presence of the logarithmic correction , the gluon propagator vanishes and the ghost propagator is enhanced in the infrared limit , and the gluon - ghost - antighost coupling constant has an infrared fixed point ( but with a different @xmath0 function ) . </S>",
