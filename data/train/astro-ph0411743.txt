    "disc accretion is an essential process for such dynamic phenomena as energetic x - ray sources , active galactic nuclei , and protostars .",
    "since the early works by @xcite and @xcite , a great number of papers have been devoted to studies of the disc accretion onto gravitating objects , and the standard accretion disc models with geometrically thin disc have proven to be particularly successful in applications to cataclysmic variables . however , for very luminous accretion discs whose luminosity exceeds the eddington luminosity , we need another disc model instead of the standard model because the disc is expected to have geometrically thick structure and powerful outflows from the disc .",
    "it is well known that the luminous accretion discs , where the radiation - pressure and the electron - scattering are dominant , are thermally unstable if the usual @xmath12-model for the viscosity is used . for the luminous disc ,",
    "the slim accretion disk model has been proposed by @xcite , where strong advective cooling depresses the thermal instability .",
    "the slim disc model seems to be reasonable for the accretion discs at the super - eddington luminosity , but we need to reconfirm it from the point of view of a two - dimensional simulation .",
    "the super - eddington accretion discs were generally expected to possess vortex funnels and radiation - pressure driven jets from geometrically thick discs @xcite . a two - dimensional hydrodynamical calculation of a super - eddington accretion disc around a black hole",
    "was first examined by @xcite , and was discussed regarding ss 433 .",
    "although they showed a relativistic jet formation just outside a conical photosphere of the accretion disc and a collimation angle of @xmath13 of the jet , the jet s mass flux is too small and the collimation angle is much larger than the one observed for ss 433 .",
    "@xcite investigated an adiabatic inflow ",
    "outflow solution of the accretion disc , where the super - eddington flow leads to a powerful wind .",
    "@xcite discussed the super - eddington mass transfer in binary systems and how to accrete in such super - eddington accretion discs .",
    "recent theoretical studies and two - dimensional simulations of the black holes accretion flows @xcite showed a new development in the advection - dominated accretion flows ( adafs ) and the convection - dominated accretion flows ( cdafs ) which may be deeply related to the super - eddington accretion flows .",
    "furthermore , from a point of view completely different from the @xmath12-viscosity models for accretion discs , recently developed rigorous works of global three - dimensional magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) simulations of black hole accretion flows should be noticed @xcite .",
    "they show that , without assumption of the phenomenological @xmath12-viscosity , magnetic fields play the most important role in the angular momentum transport ; that is , accretion is driven by turbulent stresses generated selfconsistently by the magnetorotational instability .",
    "the results reveal a three component structure : a warm keplerian disc , a highly magnetized corona , and axial jet .",
    "@xcite examined the super - eddington black - hole model for ss 433 based on two - dimensional hydrodynamical calculations coupled with radiation transport .",
    "although , in this model , a high - velocity jet with 0.2  0.4@xmath4 is formed along the rotational axis , a small collimation angle of @xmath14 radian of the jets and a sufficient mass - outflow rate comparable to @xmath15 g s@xmath7 could not be obtained .",
    "additionally , it was also suggested that this result might be a transient behavior during a long disc evolution @xcite .",

    "5 ( a ) and ( b ) is maintained throughout the disc evolution , it is expected that the collimation angle of the jet is as small as @xmath196 . furthermore , in addition to models 1 and 2 , we examined the intermediate case with @xmath197 between them and found that the case also shows anisotropic outflows same as model 2 but with a smaller collimation angle than that in model 2 . from these results ,",
    "we speculate that the collimation angle may be smaller if we consider other models with much higher input - accretion rates .",
    "this should be confirmed in future .",
    "of course , axisymmetric mhd disc simulations have been used successfully in the past to reproduce jets formation and collimation of the jets since @xcite , and the recent 3-d mhd simulations , which have directed at the internal dynamics of the disc itself and the resulting accretion flow , also show an unbound outflowing jet along the z axis confined by magnetic pressure . however , as far as the very luminous x - ray source ss 433 is concerned , the jet acceleration is considered to be mainly in thermal origin but not nonthermal one .",
    "therefore it is very advantageous for us to be able to reproduce a small collimation angle of the jet in terms of the thermal model considered here .",
    "the mass - outflow rate in model 1 is as large as @xmath15 ",
    "@xmath6 g s@xmath7 but is variable and intermittent with times , while in model 2 it is as large as @xmath120 g s@xmath7 , and it is stable and comparable to the mass - outflow rate estimated in ss 433 .",
    "black - hole accretion discs and jets with 3 and 15 @xmath0 have been examined by time - dependent two - dimensional radiation hydrodynamical calculations over a far distant region and a long time - scale . starting with the initial disc based on the shakura - sunyaev disc model",
    ", we examined the time evolutions of the disc and the jet .",
    "as the result , the inner disc becomes geometrically thick , optically thin , and convectively unstable .",
    "the dominant radiation pressure force in the inner region of the disc accelerates the gas flow vertically to the disc plane , and the high - velocity jets with 0.2  0.4@xmath4 are formed along the rotational axis . in model 1 with the lower accretion rate , the initially anisotropic high - velocity jet becomes gradually isotropic flow in the distant region of @xmath195 cm .",
    "the mass outflow occurs through the entire outer boundary and the mass - outflow rate is large as @xmath15 ",
    "@xmath6 g s@xmath7 , but it is variable and intermittent with times ; that is , the outflow switches occasionally to inflow . at the initial phase the luminosity fluctuates around @xmath8 erg s@xmath7 by a factor 2 and",
    "then it flares up to @xmath198 erg s@xmath7 and again to @xmath199 erg s@xmath7 after a time of @xmath200 .",
    "after then the luminosity behaves like a periodic variation with a period of @xmath201 and an amplitude of factor ten .    on the other hand , the jet in model 2 with the higher accretion rate maintains its initial anisotropic shape even after the jets go far away , and the mass outflow occurs only through the polar direction .",
    "the disc luminosity and the mass - outflow rate attain to their steady values of @xmath11 erg s@xmath7 and @xmath10 g s@xmath7 , respectively .",
    "these different behaviors of the unstable disc luminosity in model 1 and the stable disc luminosity in model 2 are interpreted in terms of the thermal instability of the slim accretion disc model . the super - eddington model with 15 @xmath0 is promising to explain a small collimation degree of the jet and a large mass - outflow rate observed in the x - ray source ss 433 .",
    "it shoud be noticed that these conclusions are dependent on the viscosity parameter @xmath12 because we examined only the low - viscosity flows with @xmath80 . in the previous numerical simulations",
    ", we found that the low - viscosity flow is more advantageous to form a well collimated powerful jet than the high - viscosity flow with @xmath181 .",
    "the characteristics of the accretion flows for different @xmath12 can qualitatively explained by the role of viscosity in the suppression of the convective instability in the accretion flows .",
    "thick accretion discs of low viscosity ( @xmath202 ) are generally convection - dominated flows @xcite . the convective instability results in the vortex motion of gas of different spatial scales .",
    "convection cells stretch from the disc mid - plane to the disc surface in the inner region of the disc .",
    "the convective flow is subsonic in the mid - plane but becomes comparable to the sonic speed near to the disc surface . as a result , a part of the convective flow escapes from the disc as the disc wind , dissipating energy of powerful accoustic waves produced by convection in the disc .",
    "the outflowing material originates not only from the innermost disc near the transition region between the inner advection - dominated and outer convection - dominated zones but also from the outer upper disc as the disc wind .",
    "the disc wind is incorporated into the rarefied , hot , and high - velocity region and is acclerated due to the strong radiation field in the rarefied region . however , in the case of a high viscosity , the strong accretion flow smoothes the convective instability and is globally stable to the instability . as the result , the powerful jet as is found in the low - viscosity case is not reproduced . at present , we have no clear conclusion as to which viscosity case to be realized in actual black hole accretion flows .",
    "future 3-d mhd simulations of the black hole accretion flows may give a decisive answer to the viscosity problem .",
    "the authors would like to thank the referee for many useful comments ."
