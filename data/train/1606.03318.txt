    "the molecular system is effectively described by two energy eigenstates that are delocalized across the dbt .",
    "the molecule is coupled to a low excitation heat bath , and the joint system number state basis evolves unitarily under the action of : @xmath2 where @xmath3 .",
    "this coupling can be viewed as a partial swap between qubit and environment , parametrized by @xmath4 .",
    "it has the effect of transferring @xmath5 ( @xmath6 is the energy of the @xmath7 level ) between the molecule and the environment , with a probability dependent on the coupling strength . within this experiment",
    "all of the photons are emitted along the zero phonon line , and as such we do not observe the effects of transitions within the vibrational modes . if we perform periodic measurements on the output field we can perform a partial measurement on the state of the molecule , and measure the heat flux from the molecule to the environment .",
    "this produces trajectories of the joint system which are shown in fig .",

    "we convert the time resolved trace of the photon statistics into the heat distribution which we find to be consistent with : @xmath8 where @xmath9 are the initial occupation probabilities of each level .",

    "the lower dashed curve represents part of the heat distribution , which has been calculated directly from the spectroscopic data.,title=\"fig : \" ]    by examining the heat distribution given above we can directly evaluate the jarzynski equality .",
    "in particular we find that the system satisfies @xmath11 for all time points during the period of spontaneous emission .",
    "this demonstrates that the decay of organic molecules from an excited to the ground state is a thermodynamic process , even when it is considered at the level of single photon emission events .",
    "we can utilize the jarzynski equality to detect shifts in the energy spectra of the molecule . if we consider taking the energy levels from : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is a common shift of the energies and @xmath14 is the difference in shifts between energy levels 1 and 2 .",
    "this operation produces a change in the equilibrium free energy ( @xmath15 ) of the molecule : @xmath16 here we have defined @xmath5 and @xmath17 . by observing the fluorescence emitted by the excited molecules we can determine the value of both of these quantities . combining this relation with the jarzynski equality for heat we can determine the value of @xmath13 .",
    "this would allow for probing the strengths of local field effects with high sensitivity .",
    "recently there has been substantial interest in developing systems which can be used to test quantum thermodynamics , @xcite .",
    "here we have demonstrated that the photon emission from organic molecules satisfies one of the fundamental relationships of the field .",
    "this is true for the single photon emission from the molecules , at all points during the relaxation time .",
    "we believe that this provides an important platform for the study of quantum thermodynamics in real systems .",
    "organic spectroscopy is a well developed and established field of physics , and here we demonstrate that it possible to tap into these resources to investigate fundamental questions in quantum thermodynamics .    in the initial set up of this investigation we focused on emissions along the zero phonon line .",
    "one major advantage of investigating quantum thermodynamics by utilizing fluorescence from organic molecules is that it is experimentally straightforward to relax this assumption and probe how the situation changes when we incorporate the phononic transitions .",
    "this would have the effect of creating an extra heat bath for energy transferred into the molecule to dissipate into , and would also provide for a much larger number of potential trajectories to be taken . with single molecule",
    "spectroscopy it is possible to have sufficient resolution of the photons emitted to determine how much energy is being `` lost '' to the phonon modes",
    ". we would then be able to determine if the jarzynski equality is still satisfied in this open system .    in this analysis of the molecule - heat bath system we have modelled it as initially being in a mixed state .",
    "we believe this initial condition to be reasonable as the lifetime of any entanglement between the molecule and environment is very short lived .",
    "if instead the molecule were to be left in a superposition of energy eigenstates ( e.g. @xmath18 ) after the work is done on it then in the current setup there is no difference in the measured heat statistics relative to the corresponding de - phased mixed state .",
    "the reason this occurs is due to the repeated suppression of the coherence in the heat bath via measurement in the photon number basis and discarding the measurement outcomes .",
    "however as the initial state before the spontaneous emission is very close to a pure product state between the molecule and the heat bath , and the hamiltonian time evolution is unitary , the total state before measurements is approximately pure , and there will exist a basis in which measurements would not destroy coherence . as is well known , see e.g.  @xcite , coherence implies extra extractable work so it would be valuable to identify how to implement this alternative basis measurement experimentally .",
    "consider the two level molecule .",
    "we assume it is initially in a thermal state at the same temperature as the environment . in this set - up and for the modes of concern",
    "this means both the molecule and the environment are essentially in the ground state with a very small probability of a thermal excitation . the system is then pulsed by a laser which causes a swap in the occupation probabilities of the joint state . ( the laser is non - resonant but there is then near - instantaneous vibrational de - excitation to the excited level of interest - see fig .",
    "2 . ) now the joint system undergoes evolution under its own hamiltonian which has the effect of inducing a partial swap , parametrized by @xmath19 , see eq .",
    "[ eq : unitary ] .",
    "this unitary arises naturally from the jaynes - cummings hamiltonian which describes the coupling between the environment and the molecule @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to the emission of a photon to the environment as the molecule is de - excited .    framing this in the language of quantum jumps , such that we can evaluate the jarzynski equality  la @xcite , produces the trajectories in table [ tab : trajtable ] .",
    "these trajectories are defined by considering an infinitesimal time step during which one of two events happens - either the system evolves under the joint hamiltonian or we perform a projective measurement on the environment .",
    "the sequence of pure states produces a trajectory .        .",

    "+    in this framework we consider the system to always be occupying a definite state and determine what possible evolutions each state can take .",
    "each of these evolutions constitutes a possible trajectory the system can undertake , which have associated values of internal energy change , work and heat .",
    "having identified what the possible trajectories are , we must now determine which correspond to the experimental data we obtain . as we are detecting photon emission from the molecules using an avalanche photodiode ( apd ) , in principle we detect trajectories 1 , 3 and 4 .",
    "however due to the electronics of the apd there is a delay time in receiving the signal from the photons @xcite .",
    "trajectories 3 and 4 occur on a very fast time scale due to the stimulating effect of the laser causing the transition and so are unobserved . as such , we only observe clicks in the detector due to traj .",
    "1 . the probabilities of the remaining trajectories turn out , as described below , to be determined uniquely by the initial state being assumed to be thermal together with demanding that the probabilities of all the trajectories sum to 1 .",
    "the time resolution is very high and the probability of receiving more than one photon in a given time - bin is negligible here , even taking into account the number of molecules scattered in the illuminated part of the crystal .",
    "thus one click means one photon .    *",
    "the swapping parameter * that controls the interaction with environment is plotted as a function of temperature and the time .",
    "it can be seen that the swapping parameter is very stable for the majority of time during the experiment , indicating that the model we employ to interpret the data is sound , see eq .",
    "[ eq : unitary ] .",
    "we utilize this in connecting the experimental data to the quantum jumps model that enables us to evaluate the jarzynski equality . ]",
    "having established the concurrence between clicks and photons , we now treat the environment as a low excitation heat bath .",
    "the emitted photons are then simply the heat flux into the bath , and by relating the cumulative probability of emission to the heat distribution , eq .",
    "[ eq : heatdist ] , we can determine the values of @xmath30 and @xmath19 , see fig . [",

    "this information corresponds to trajectories 1 and 2 , and by employing the fact that @xmath31 we can explicitly calculate the jarzynski equality .",
    "this equality is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : dataplot ] .",
    "we conclude that this fluorescence experiment amounts to a scenario where jarzynski s equality holds . as further evidence that this experimental set - up is promising for probing quantum thermodynamics we note / reiterate the following : ( i ) molecular spectroscopy is a powerful and well - established technique , ( ii ) the set - up maps naturally to the quantum jumps model for work and heat ( used e.g.  in crook s proof of quantum jarzynski @xcite ) . a natural and exciting next step in this program is to prepare two entangled molecules to implement the quantum maxwell s demon of @xcite .",
    "this would build on the important first steps we have taken with this work , and reinforce the applicability of quantum thermodynamics to spectroscopy .",
