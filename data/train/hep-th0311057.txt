    "currently the topic of supersymmetric extended objects is extremely fashionable . before the advent of the new brane world , however , only a few workers paid attention to the physical and mathematical properties of super - membranes of various dimensions . among such pioneers , we mention the work on the cohomological interpretation of the topological charges associated with these extended objects by j. a. de azcarraga and collaborators , see @xcite .",
    "relevant contributions to the subject can be found also in the work of m. cvetic , s. j. rey et al , @xcite . in this paper , we offer a brief summary of our work on a related topic -the dynamics of bps domain walls- to honor adolfo , professor and friend to several of us from the salamanca years circa 1977 .",
    "we focus on a generalized wess - zumino model with two @xmath0 chiral superfields , first discussed by bazeia et al . in reference @xcite .",
    "slightly later in @xcite , it was shown by shifman and voloshin that this model admits a degenerate family of bps domain walls .",
    "the general variety of both non - bps and bps solitary waves has been described in @xcite , studying the ( 1 + 1)-dimensional version of the system .",
    "more recently , eto and sakai , see @xcite , have discovered how to define a local \" superpotential in such a way that the domain walls of the generalized wess - zumino model remain exact solutions in @xmath1 ( 3 + 1)-dimensional supergravity .",
    "a remarkable feature of this supersymmetric system is the availability of analytic descriptions of the domain wall dynamics along orthogonal lines to the two``-branes .",
    "bps wall / bps anti - wall dynamics have been discussed in @xcite , analyzing the energy density of non - bps wall / anti - wall configurations . in @xcite , however , several of us unveiled the adiabatic dynamics of bps two - walls by studying geodesic motion in the moduli space .",
    "the dynamics inside the wall at low energy is ruled by the effective action '' , see @xcite , governing the evolution of goldstone bosons through the two - brane .",
    "although lorentz invariance forbids dependence on the center of mass of the wall , in our system with two real scalar fields the effective action depends on the relative coordinate that labels the distance between walls ; the inertia for goldstone bosons running either on distant or intersecting walls are different , smoothly varying from one to another .",
    "the above results concerning the classical dynamics of domain walls are based on a crucial property : the degeneracy of the classical moduli space of domain walls .",
    "the question arises as to whether this degeneracy survives quantum fluctuations .",
    "analyse of the one - loop fluctuations around the wall solutions in the body \" of the supersymmetric system reveal that repulsive forces , decaying exponentially with distance , arise between the fundamental lumps , see @xcite .",
    "however , a general theorem warranting the identity between the one - loop corrections to kink masses and the anomaly in the central charge of the @xmath0 susy algebra , see e.g. @xcite , tells us that at the quantum level wall degeneracy occurs in the fully supersymmetric system .",
    "we shall consider the ( 3 + 1)-dimensional @xmath0 supersymmetric wess - zumino model , where the superpotential @xmath2 determines the interactions between the two chiral superfields : @xmath3 . here , the four - vectors @xmath4 and the grassman weyl spinors @xmath5 provide ( non - dimensional ) coordinates in @xmath1 minkowski superspace .",
    "@xmath6 is the only ( non - dimensional ) coupling constant .    in our search for domain walls ,",
    "we need to explore only the body `` of the theory , i.e. we shall focus on the first terms of the grassman expansion of the fields and the superpotential : @xmath7 .",
    "moreover , the reality condition @xmath8 and the requirement of independence of the @xmath9 variables ( dimensional reduction ) , @xmath10 , lead us to the ( 1 + 1)-dimensional superpotential : @xmath11.\\ ] ] therefore , the domain walls of the original wess - zumino model are in one - to - one correspondence with the solitary waves ( kinks ) of the ( 1 + 1)-dimensional system , with dynamics governed by the action : @xmath12\\ .\\label{eq : bnrt}\\ ] ] the vacuum moduli space , characterized as the set of critical points of @xmath13 modulo the internal parity symmetry group of the problem , contains the two '' points : @xmath14 , @xmath15 .",
    "we shall focus only on the topological sector connecting the @xmath16 vacua .",
    "generically , solitary waves in other topological sectors are not bps kinks ; the problem of kink stability is studied in @xcite from a geometrical point of view .",
    "the energy for static configurations can be written  la bogomolny , resulting in : @xmath17+\\int_p \\ , \\left [ d\\phi_1{\\partial w\\over\\partial\\phi_1}+d\\phi_2{\\partial w\\over\\partial\\phi_2}\\right].\\ ] ] given a polynomial superpotential such as @xmath13 , the solutions of the first - order equations @xmath18 are absolute minima of @xmath19 , usually referred to as bps kinks that saturate the topological bound : @xmath20 .    from ( [ eq : flow ] ) ,",
    "the flow lines of @xmath21 are identified as the solutions of the ode : @xmath22 there is an integrating factor , @xmath23 if @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and the flow lines -kink orbits- are the curves : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is an integration constant .",
    "the meaning of these solutions can be summarized as follows : there are two maxima of @xmath28 with the same height .",
    "kink solutions which pass from one maximum to the other depend on a parameter , @xmath29 , which measures whether the particle moves through the bottom of the valley or more along the sides on the curve ( [ eq : tra1 ] ) .",
    "there is a critical value @xmath30 of @xmath29 where the particle moves as high as possible ; when @xmath29 increases beyond this critical value the particle crosses the mountain and falls off to the other side , see figure 1 .",
    "exactly at the critical value , the kink orbit starts at the point @xmath31 and ends at the other point @xmath32 ; this is in contrast to any other kink orbit for @xmath33 , which starts at @xmath31 but ends in @xmath34 .",
    "thus , there are two kinds of kinks living in different topological sectors of the system : link `` kinks , interpolating between different points of the vacuum moduli space , and loop '' kinks , joining vacua identified as the same point of the vacuum moduli .",
    "to find the kink form factors , one plugs formula ( [ eq : tra1 ] ) into ( [ eq : flow ] ) so that the problem is reduced to solving the quadrature : @xmath35=\\int \\frac{d \\phi_2}{\\phi_2 \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{4}+\\frac{c}{2 \\sigma } |\\phi_2|^{\\frac{2}{\\sigma}}-\\frac{\\sigma}{2(1-\\sigma ) } \\phi_2 ^ 2}}=2\\sigma(x+a)=z\\label{eq : quad}\\ ] ] @xmath36= \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{4}+\\frac{c}{2 \\sigma } |i^{-1}(z)|^{\\frac{2}{\\sigma}}-\\frac{\\sigma}{2(1-\\sigma ) } [ i^{-1}(z)]^2}\\quad , \\quad \\phi_2^{{\\rm tk}2}[x;a , c]=i^{-1}(z)\\ ] ]      explicit analytic integration of ( [ eq : quad ] ) in terms of elementary functions is only possible if @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "the reason is that the analogous mechanical problem that one needs to solve in the search for one - dimensional solitary waves is an integrable liouville system . also , when @xmath39 and @xmath40 , the quadrature can be found analytically , but in these cases one is forced to deal with elliptic functions .",
    "we present the analytic outcome of finding @xmath41 and its inverse @xmath42 in the two liouville cases . in figure 2",
    "we show kink profiles for several values of @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "@xmath45 @xmath46 @xmath47=\\frac{(-1)^\\alpha}{2 } \\frac{\\sinh 4 ( x+a)}{\\cosh 4(x+a)+b } \\hspace{1 cm } \\phi_2^{{\\rm tk2}}[x;a , b]= \\frac{(-1)^\\beta}{2 } \\frac{\\sqrt{b^2 - 1}}{\\cosh 4(x+a)+b}\\qquad , \\ ] ] where @xmath48 , and @xmath49 is the center of the kink .",
    "the parameter @xmath43 is related to the integration constant as follows : @xmath50 , so that @xmath51 .",

    ", we focus on the @xmath55 case because it provides an analytical description of the generic behaviour . in figure 3 ,",
    "pictures of the energy density are depicted for the same kinks shown in figure 2 .",
    "note that for @xmath56 the energy density presents two lumps , whereas if @xmath57 the density is of the usual bell - shaped form .",
    "also , because changing @xmath43 to @xmath58 in the solution is equivalent to changing @xmath59 to @xmath60 and the energy density is not sensitive to the sign of @xmath43 , it is sensible to describe the moduli space of kinks as the half - plane parametrized by the @xmath61 coordinates : @xmath62 fixes the center of mass of the two lumps , and @xmath63 can be interpreted as the relative coordinate that measures the distance between them .",
    "this qualitative description can be precisely established in an analytic fashion by looking at the maxima of the energy density @xmath64 $ ] .",
    "these can be found through a classical analysis , applying the cardano and vieta formulas and rolle s theorem .",
    "we obtain the following conclusions :    \\1 . if @xmath65 $ ] , @xmath66 is the only critical point ( maximum ) of @xmath67 and @xmath68={2\\over ( b^2 + 1)^2}$ ]",
    ". therefore , @xmath63 measures the height of @xmath67 in this regime where the two lumps are aggregate .",
    "if @xmath69 , @xmath66 is a minimum .",
    "because @xmath70={2{\\rm sinh}x\\over[b^2+{\\rm cosh}x]^5}p_3[{\\rm cosh}x]$ ] , where @xmath71 $ ] is a third order polynomial with real roots @xmath72 , see @xcite , we identify @xmath73 $ ] as the two maxima of @xmath74 obeying to the peak of the energy density of the two lumps .",
    "@xmath63 measures ( in a highly non - linear scale set by the known function @xmath75 ) the distance between lumps .",
    "in this section , we recover the ( 3 + 1)-dimensional point of view where our kinks become domain walls .",
    "the aim is to study the low - energy classical dynamics of these bps topological walls , which can be understood as composed of the two basic link walls .",
    "we shall focus on the @xmath55 case , for which analytical formulas are available .",
    "we first analyze the motion orthogonal to the wall . in the case of walls grown from kinks of a single real scalar field ,",
    "this analysis is not necessary because lorentz invariance takes care of the matter . besides the @xmath62 coordinate , describing the motion of the wall center of mass in the orthogonal direction ruled by lorentz symmetry",
    ", there is another parameter in the moduli space of domain walls : the relative coordinate @xmath43 .",
    "the dynamics of the motion on the @xmath43-coordinate along the @xmath76-axis is non - trivial ; the dependence of @xmath43 on time precisely characterizes how the two basic walls intersect and split on their way along the @xmath76-axis .",
    "starting from the hamiltonian of the reduced system , @xmath77=\\int \\ , dx { 1\\over 2}\\left({\\partial\\phi_1^k\\over\\partial x^0}{\\partial\\phi_1^k\\over\\partial x^0}+{\\partial\\phi_2^k\\over\\partial x^0}{\\partial\\phi_2^k\\over\\partial x^0}\\right)+\\int \\ , dx\\ ,   { \\cal e}\\qquad , \\ ] ] we apply the adiabatic hypothesis of manton @xcite to study the low - energy dynamics of topological defects as geodesic motion in the moduli space .",
    "the smooth evolution on the moduli hypothesis @xmath78 \\qquad , \\qquad \\phi_2^k(x^0,x)=\\phi_2^k[x;a(t),b(t)]\\ ] ] is plugged into the action and , after integrating out the @xmath76 variable , we find that @xmath79 becomes the action for geodesic motion in the kink moduli space with a metric inherited from the dynamics of the zero modes : @xmath80 the components of the metric tensor are : @xmath81 , where @xmath82 \\label{eq : metric}\\quad .\\ ] ] as expected , the metric is independent of the center of mass @xmath62 . despite appearances , the behaviour of the metric is regular in the transition of @xmath63 from lower to higher values than 1 . for a metric of the form given , the geodesics",
    "are easily found : they are merely straight lines on the @xmath83 plane : @xmath84 @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 are integration constants .",
    "it is worthwhile to use ( [ eq : str ] ) to express the geodesic orbits in the kink space : @xmath89 there are two main types :    @xmath45 choosing @xmath90 in ( [ eq : geod ] ) we obtain geodesics describing free motion of the center of mass without any variation in separation of the two lumps , see figure 4 .",
    "@xmath45 if we choose @xmath91 the geodesics also describe a non - trivial motion of the relative coordinate .",
    "a mathematica numerical plot choosing @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 whereas @xmath95 is fixed by setting @xmath96 at @xmath97 is shown in figure 5(a ) . clearly",
    ", these geodesics describe exact solutions at the adiabatic limit for intersecting walls .",
    "there is analogy with the scattering of solitons in the sine - gordon model , although , in this case , shape - preserving collisions only occur in the topological sector with a loop kink . as compared with similar phenomena , we find hybrid behaviour in our system between the sine - gordon and @xmath98 models .",
    "the effective action for domain walls modeled on kinks without internal structure is derived by expanding the action around the classical solution and taking into account only the zero mode in the direction orthogonal to the wall , see @xcite .",
    "we proceed along the same way to unveil the effective action induced by the zero modes for intersecting walls .",
    "there are two zero modes in the direction orthogonal to these composite two - branes .",
    "the collective coordinates corresponding to these zero modes are precisely the coordinates of the kink moduli space .",
    "the hessian driving the small fluctuations orthogonal to the domain wall is @xmath99 and by expanding the ( 3 + 1)-dimensional action restricted to the bose sector around the kink solutions @xmath100+\\delta\\phi_1(\\vec{x},t ) \\qquad , \\qquad \\phi_2(\\vec{x},t)=\\phi_2^{tk2}[x;a , b]+\\delta\\phi_2(\\vec{x},t)\\ ] ] up to second order in small fluctuations we obtain : @xmath101 note that the metric found in the previous subsection implies that the ( non - dimensional ) constant energy per unit of area , the surface tension , we would have obtained @xmath102 , see @xcite . ] of the wall , is @xmath103 .",
    "because the solutions only depend on @xmath76 , we now attempt to separate variables @xmath104 and because the spectrum of the ( 1 + 1)-dimensional hessian has a mass gap @xmath105 , at low energies the only contribution to @xmath106 comes from the zero modes .",

    "formula ( [ eq : eff ] ) tells us that the two goldstone bosons @xmath114 and @xmath115 living inside the wall feel a different tension that are functions of the relative coordinate .",
    "the dependence of the surface tensions on how far or how close the two basic lumps are follows the graphics in figure 5(b ) .",
    "do quantum effects modify the picture that we have described ? is the dynamics of domain walls in the quantum world different ? to answer these related questions , we develop a semiclassical analysis of the domain walls in the bose sector of the generalized wess - zumino model .",
    "we start with the one - component topological kink arising when @xmath116 .",
    "the second - order fluctuation operator around the tk1 kink is a diagonal `` matrix - valued schrdinger operator : @xmath117 there are contributions of the tangent '' and orthogonal \" fluctuations to the semi - classical kink mass : @xmath118      we shall apply the generalized dhn formula @xmath119 + \\nonumber \\\\&+ & \\hbar m\\frac{\\left < v_{aa}(x ) \\right > } { 8 \\pi } \\int_0^\\infty \\!\\ ! \\frac{dk}{\\sqrt{k^2+v_a^2}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] that was derived in @xcite .",
