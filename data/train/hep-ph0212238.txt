    "in recent years generalized parton distributions ( gpds ) @xcite have generated a considerable amount of attention .",
    "these distributions stem from hadronic matrix elements that are both non - diagonal with respect to hadron states and involve quark and gluon operators separated by a light - like distance .",
    "thus physics of both inclusive ( parton distributions , e.g. ) and exclusive ( form factors , e.g. ) reactions is contained in the gpds . at the leading - twist level , these new structure functions describe the soft physics of a variety of hard exclusive processes ( see the reviews @xcite ) .",
    "since light - like correlation functions are involved in the description of deeply virtual compton scattering ( dvcs ) , e.g. , there exists a simple decomposition of these matrix elements in terms of the light - cone fock space wave functions of the initial and final states @xcite .",
    "this representation of gpds is ideal for physical intuition , however , comparatively little has been done to show that the light - cone wave function representation is consistent with the reduction properties required of the generalized parton distributions .",
    "below we undertake a simpler task of presenting covariant models for the pion which respect the properties of gpds .",
    "albeit simple , these models illustrate the utility and physicality of the light - cone fock representation as well as provide a guide to understanding how the reduction relations arise in this formalism which will be useful when non - perturbative solutions for the fock components in qcd become available .",
    "the scalar constituent model which we consider is merely the triangle graph with point - like vertices ( this has been considered in @xcite , see also @xcite ) .",
    "the spin-@xmath0 model is based on an earlier exactly soluble , @xmath1-dimensional light - front model @xcite .",
    "extension of this model to @xmath2 dimensions , which involves regularizing the divergent light - front current , has been done in @xcite .",
    "another approach is to use the formalism of double distributions ( dds ) @xcite .",
    "this formalism elegantly explains the polynomiality conditions required of gpds and thus gives one the ability to construct models consistent with known properties  although insight into model construction has often been limited to factorization _",
    "anstze_. recently two - body light - front wave function models of the pion have been used to obtain gpds @xcite based on dds . without modifying the quark distribution ,",
    "the resulting gpds violate the positivity constraints @xcite .",
    "this inconsistency is attributed to missing contributions from non - wave function vertex diagrams which are absent when one uses non - covariant vertices . in general",
    "these diagrams are a substitute for higher fock components , see @xcite .",
    "the covariant models used here , however , allow us to test the uniqueness of this ostensible construction .",
    "indeed we find that appealing to lorentz invariance is only enough to determine one component of the double distribution in the two - component formalism ( even for @xmath3-odd distributions , where the polyakov - weiss @xmath4-term @xcite is absent ) .",
    "we show that in the scalar constituent model , missing the second component leads to incorrect gpds .",
    "the same is true for the spin-@xmath0 constituent model , where additionally the positivity constraint is violated .",
    "the correct dds can be calculated from non - diagonal matrix elements of twist - two operators which we demonstrate for both models . on the other hand ,",
    "exploiting the ambiguity inherent in defining dds ( which is akin to gauge freedom @xcite ) one can generate infinitely many different gpd models which share the same form factor _ and _ quark distribution as well as satisfy polynomiality ( and likely positivity ) .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows .",
    "first in section [ scalar ] , we explicitly derive the gpd for the scalar triangle diagram with point - like vertices .",
    "next we show the dd for this model extracted from the form factor in the drell - yan frame leads to incorrect gpds . having encountered this problem , we review definitions of the double distributions in section [ twist ] . here",
    "we also calculate the correct dd for the scalar triangle diagram . in [ spinor ] , we present the model for the spin-@xmath0 case .",
    "next in section [ form ] , we regularize the current and then extract this model s gpd . although not manifest , this model satisfies polynomiality , which is demonstrated in section [ prop ] .",
    "using @xcite as a guide , we construct the dd for this model in section [ double ] .",
    "similar to section [ scalar ] , this one - component dd too gives rise to a different gpd than the light - front projection .",
    "additionally positivity is not satisfied by this one - component dd ( section [ pc ] ) .",
    "we calculate the missing component of the dd from matrix elements of twist - two operators in section [ real ] .",
    "lastly we conclude with a brief summary ( section [ summy ] ) .",
    "for the pion model with scalar constituents , we choose the point - like bethe - salpeter vertex @xmath5 , where the coupling constant is assumed to be absorbed into the overall normalization .",
    "furthermore , we choose derivative coupling of the photon to charged scalar particles .",
    "the pion electromagnetic form factor for this model can be calculated from the feynman triangle diagram . in order to derive the gpd , however , we need to choose the kinematics specified in figure [ ftri ] with @xmath6 as the momentum of the struck quark . using the stated pion vertex and taking the plus - component of the current ,",

    "consideration of this model was first done from the perspective of dds , see e.g.  the toy model of @xcite .",
    "this dd model was revisited recently with derivative coupling at the photon vertex in the appendix of @xcite and the same dd also appears in @xcite . to derive the dd for this simple model",
