    "in the past decade , an impressive convergence of observational results led to a resurgence of interest in a universe dominated by a relic cosmological constant @xmath1 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in general grounds , the main motivation behind",
    "this idea is the wide belief that the presence of an unclustered component , such as the vacuum energy , not only would explain the observed late - time acceleration of the universe but would also reconcile the inflationary flatness prediction ( @xmath2 ) with the current clustering estimates that point systematically to @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , it is also well known that the same welcome properties that make @xmath1cdm scenarios our best description of the observed universe also result in an unsettled situation in the particle physics / cosmology interface , in which the cosmological upper bound ( @xmath4 @xmath5 ) differs from theoretical expectations ( @xmath6 @xmath5 ) by more than 100 orders of magnitude @xcite . in this regard and",
    "based only on phenomenological grounds , an attempt at alleviating such a problem was proposed almost two decades ago , in which @xmath1 is allowed to vary @xcite .",
    "afterward , a considerable number of models with different decay laws for the variation of the cosmological term was investigated in both theoretical @xcite and observational aspects @xcite .",
    "although constituting a possible way to address the above problem , the usual critique to the so - called @xmath1(t)cdm scenarios is that , in the absence of a natural guidance from fundamental physics , one needs to specify a phenomenological time - dependence for @xmath1 in order to establish a model and study their observational and theoretical implications .    in this concern , a still phenomenological but interesting step toward a more realistic decay law was recently discussed by wang and meng in ref .",
    "@xcite . instead of the traditional approach",
    "specifying a decay law for @xmath7 and studying its consequences , they deduced a new one from a simple argument about the effect of the vacuum decay on the dark matter expansion rate .",
    "such a decay law is similar to the one originally obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite from arguments based on renormalization group and is capable of reconciling @xmath1(t)cdm models with an initially decelerated and late time accelerating universe , as indicated by current sne ia observations @xcite .",
    "additionally , the authors assumed that baryons have a negligible role to play in the late time evolution of the model and supposed that vacuum decays only into dark matter .    0.1 in    the qualitative argument used in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also , @xcite ) is the following : if vacuum is decaying into dark matter particles , the energy density of this latter component will dilute more slowly compared to its standard evolution , @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the cosmological scale factor .",
    "thus , the deviation from the standard dilution is characterized by a positive constant @xmath10 , such that ) , restrict the parameter @xmath10 to be positive . ]",
    "@xmath11 this is the simplest possible way of stating the fact that the dark matter dilution is attenuated by the existence of another component of the cosmic constituents decaying into this sector . by introducing the above result into the balance equation for the dark matter particles and @xmath1 , i.e. , @xmath12 we obtain @xcite @xmath13 in the above equations , a dot and the subscript 0 denote , respectively , derivative with respect to time and the current values of the parameters , @xmath14 , @xmath15 is the dark matter energy density and @xmath16 is an integration constant . as emphasized in ref .",
    "@xcite , such a decay law seems to be the most general one , as it has many of the previous phenomenological attempts as particular cases(t)cdm scenarios whose deviation from the standard evolution of the dark matter energy density is more general than the one given by eq .",
    "( [ energycdm ] ) , e.g. , @xmath17 @xcite , the vacuum decay law of eq .",
    "( [ decayv ] ) remains valid . ] .",
    "our aim in this paper is twofold : first , to test the viability of this comprehensive class of decaying @xmath1 scenarios in light of the latest cosmological observations for an even more general class of models by including baryons in the analysis , as they were not taken into account by the authors of @xcite . to this end",
    ", we use the recent type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) measurements , as given by the high-@xmath18 supernovae team @xcite , the baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) measurement from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) @xcite , and the shift parameter from the three - year wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) data @xcite .",
    "as we shall show , @xmath19cdm plus baryons is fitted for a wider range of values of @xmath10 if compared to the case without baryons .",
    "second , as a step towards fundamental physics motivation for the attenuated dilution of dark matter , we also discuss here how this class of @xmath19 cosmologies can be interpreted in terms of a classical scalar field .",
    "however , differently from usual scalar field cosmologies , in this case the quintessence field must be coupled to dark matter in order to account for the dilution .",
    "such `` coupled quintessence '' models have been largely considered in the literature to address some fine - tuning issues of the usual quintessence proposals @xcite .",
    "we organized this paper as follows . in sec .",

    "we show that the best concordance with the data is obtained when the baryonic component is assumed to be a separately - conserved one .",

    "we summarize and discuss our main conclusions in sec .",
    "let us first consider a homogeneous , isotropic , spatially flat universe described by the friedmann - robertson - walker line element .",
