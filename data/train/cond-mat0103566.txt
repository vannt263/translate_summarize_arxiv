    "the pseudospin - electron model ( pem ) was originally proposed to include a local interaction of the conducting electrons in metals ( or semimetals ) with a certain two level subsystem when it is reasonable to use pseudospin formalism ; the pseudospin variable @xmath0 defines these two states .",
    "starting from @xcite this scheme is applied to describe the strongly correlated electrons of cuo@xmath1 sheets coupled with the vibrational states of apex oxygen ions o@xmath2 ( moving in a double - well potential ) in ybacuo type systems . recently a similar model was proposed for investigation of the proton - electron interaction in molecular and crystalline systems with hydrogen bonds @xcite .",
    "the model hamiltonian has the following form : @xmath3 and includes , in addition to the terms describing electron transfer ( @xmath4 ) , the electron correlation ( @xmath5 - term ) in the spirit of the hubbard model , interaction with the anharmonic mode ( @xmath6 - term ) , the energy of the tunnelling splitting ( @xmath7 - term ) , and the energy of the anharmonic potential asymmetry ( @xmath8 - term ) in the single - site part @xmath9    based on pem a possible connection between the superconductivity and lattice instability of the ferroelectric type in htsc was discussed @xcite .",
    "description of the electron spectrum and electron statistics of the pem was given in @xcite within the framework of the temperature two - time green s function method in the hubbard - i approximation .",
    "a series of works has been carried out in which the pseudospin @xmath10 , mixed @xmath11 , and charge @xmath12 correlation functions were calculated . a possibility of divergences of these functions at some values of temperature exists as it was shown with making use of the generalized random phase approximation ( grpa ) @xcite in the limit of infinite single - site electron correlations ( @xmath13 ) @xcite .",
    "this effect was interpreted as a manifestation of dielectric instability or ferroelectric type anomaly .",
    "the tendency to form the spatially modulated charge and pseudospin ordering at certain model parameter values was established .    the case of absence of electron transfer ( @xmath14 ) , but with taking into account of the direct interaction between pseudospins was considered within the mean field approximation @xcite .",
    "it was shown there that behaviour of the system strongly depends on a thermodynamical regime : at @xmath15 the first order phase transitions with the jumps of pseudospin mean value @xmath16 and electron concentration values @xmath17 as well as the second ones ( with smooth changes ) were detected , while at @xmath18 an instability with respect to phase separation in the electron and pseudospin subsystems can take place .    in the papers",
    "@xcite pem was considered at the absence of direct electron - electron interaction and tunnelling splitting ( @xmath19 , @xmath20 ) .",
    "in such a version of pem ( simplified pem ) , an effective many - body pseudospin interaction via conducting electrons appears , and hence it is interesting to investigate an influence of the retarded nondirect interaction between pseudospins on thermodynamics of the model .",
    "hamiltonian of this simplified pem is invariant with respect to the transformation @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 ( the so - called electron - hole symmetry ) what makes possible to describe the hole - pseudospin system as well .",
    "on the other hand , the presented hamiltonian in the case of absence of electron correlation and tunnelling splitting allows one to describe the binary alloy type model .",
    "it is convenient to introduce projective operators on pseudospin states @xmath25 ; then hamiltonian of the binary alloy can be obtained by substitution @xmath26 , @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the concentration of one component of binary alloy , and @xmath29 is the concentration of the second one .",
    "difference between these models is in the way how an averaging procedure over projection operators @xmath30 is performed ( thermal statistical averaging in the case of pem and configurational averaging for binary alloy ) and how the self - consistency is achieved ( fixed value of longitudinal field @xmath8 for pem and fixed value of the component concentration @xmath31 for binary alloy ) .",
    "furthermore , if in hamiltonian ( [ h_initial ] ) , ( [ h_initial0 ] ) ( considering the simplified case @xmath19 , @xmath20 ) , we remove spin indices and rewrite the hamiltonian in terms of the operators of the mobile @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) and localized @xmath34 ( @xmath35 , @xmath36 ) electrons , we obtain the hamiltonian of the falicov - kimball model where @xmath8 plays a role of the chemical potential for the localized @xmath37-electrons . the ground state of the falicov - kimball model , when the electron concentration for subsystems is fixed , is not uniform and shows the commensurate or incommensurate ordering or phase separation depending on the concentration and coupling constant values @xcite . on the other hand , in the case of the fixed value of field @xmath8 ,",
    "the bistability effects are observed .",
    "investigations of the thermodynamic properties of the simplified pem within the framework of the self - consistent grpa @xcite and dynamical mean field approximation ( dmfa ) @xcite have shown that :    * in the @xmath38 regime ( when the electron states of other structure elements , which are not included explicitly into the pem , are supposed to play a role of a thermostat ensuring a fixed value of the chemical potential @xmath39 ) the interaction between the electron and pseudospin subsystems leads to the possibility of either first or second order phase transitions between different uniform phases ( bistability effect ) @xcite as well as between the uniform and the chess - board ones @xcite ; * in the regime @xmath18 ( this situation is more customary at the consideration of electron systems and means that the chemical potential depends now on the electron concentration being the function of @xmath40 , @xmath8 etc . )",
    "an instability with respect to the phase separation in the electron and pseudospin subsystems can take place @xcite .",
    "the above mentioned methods of investigation of the pem ( within the framework of the self - consistent grpa scheme as well as within the framework of dmfa in the case of the finite space dimension ) take into account only mean field type contributions . it is reasonable only when fluctuation effects are small .",
    "in the vicinity of critical points effects of the mean field fluctuations become significant .",
    "the aim of this article is to calculate the thermodynamic and correlation functions of the simplified pem ( @xmath19 , @xmath20 ) within the framework of self - consistent approach , allowing us take into account fluctuation effects of the effective self - consistent mean field .",
    "such a consistent gaussian fluctuation approach was proposed previously in work @xcite where expressions for the grand canonical potential and pseudospin correlator as well as a self - consistent set of equations for the pseudospin mean value and root ",
    "mean  squares ( r.m.s . )",
    "fluctuation parameter were obtained .",
    "furthermore we would like to investigate an influence of the gaussian fluctuations on the thermodynamics of phase transitions in the pem and discuss an applicability of the schemes previously used for the investigation of the pem .",
    "for this purpose the results of investigation of pem within the framework of the self - consistent grpa scheme @xcite as well as within the dmfa @xcite are presented .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "first , a short review of the self - consistent grpa approach is presented and the results of the numerical calculations within the framework of this scheme are compared with corresponding ones obtained within the dmfa in @xcite .",
    "second , we review the self - consistent gaussian fluctuation approach for the pem and present its simplified version ( analogous to the approximation proposed by onyszkiewicz @xcite for spin models )",
    ". then we apply gaussian fluctuation method to investigation of the thermodynamic properties of the pem , and finally results of the numerical calculations of the pseudospin mean value and r.m.s .",
    "fluctuation parameter as well as the grand canonical potential are shown .",
    "phase diagrams are presented and compared to the corresponding ones of the grpa . finally , discussion and conclusion are given .",
    "we would like to remind that traditional grpa method ( proposed by izyumov et al .",
    "@xcite for the investigation of the magnetic susceptibility of the ordinary hubbard model as well as @xmath41 model ) takes into account the same topological class of diagrams ( so - called loop diagrams ) as in the random phase approximation ( rpa ) .",
    "main difference between the grpa and rpa is a way of choosing of the basic states : splitted ( hubbard - i ) band states in the grpa method and pure band states in rpa .",
    "the question how to calculate thermodynamic quantities within the grpa has been open until recent works @xcite . in this section",
    "we briefly show how to construct the mean field type approximation within the grpa scheme for pem .",
    "calculations are performed in the strong coupling case ( @xmath42 ) using single - site states as the basic ones .",
    "the formalism of electron annihilation ( creation ) operators @xmath43 @xmath44 ( @xmath25 ) acting at a site with the certain pseudospin orientation is introduced @xcite . within the framework of the proposed representation , the initial hamiltonian ( [ h_initial ] ) ( in the case of @xmath19 , @xmath20 ) has the following form : @xmath45 where @xmath46 are the energies of the single - site states .",
    "expansion of the calculated quantities in terms of the electron transfer @xmath47 leads to the infinite series of terms containing the averages of the @xmath40-products of the @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 operators .",
    "the evaluation of such averages is made using the appropriate wick s theorem @xcite formulated in the spirit of wick s theorem for hubbard operators @xcite .",
    "this theorem gives an algorithm reducing the average of product of @xmath17 creation ( annihilation ) operators to the sum of averages of products of the @xmath52 operators .",
    "so it is possible to express the result in terms of the products of nonperturbed green s functions and averages of the projection operators @xmath53 expanded in semi - invariants .",
    "nonperturbated electron green s function is equal to @xmath54 in the uniform case @xmath55 , a single - electron green s function ( calculated in hubbard - i type approximation ) is @xmath56 @xmath57 @xmath58 ; its poles determine the electron spectrum @xmath59 investigation of the electron spectrum was performed in @xcite . in this approximation , the branches @xmath60 and @xmath61 form two electron subbands always separated by a gap .",
    "reconstruction of the electron spectrum takes place with change of the pseudospin mean value @xmath62 .    in the adopted approximation the diagrammatic series for the pseudospin mean value can be presented in the form @xcite @xmath63 where the following diagrammatic notations are used : @xmath64 @xmath65 @xmath66 wavy line is the fourier transform of the hopping integral @xmath67 .",
    "semi - invariants are represented by ovals and contain the @xmath68-symbols on site indices . in the spirit of the traditional mean field approach , renormalization of the basic semi - invariant by insertion of independent loop fragments",
    "is taken into account in ( [ sz_diagr ] ) .",
    "the analytical expression for the loop is the following : @xmath69 it should be noted that within the presented self - consistent scheme of the grpa , chain fragments form the single - electron green s function in the hubbard - i approximation , and in the sequences of loop diagrams in expressions for thermodynamic and pair correlation functions the connections between any two loops by more than one semi - invariant are omitted .",
    "this procedure includes renormalization of the higher order semi - invariants similar to the one given by expression ( [ sz_diagr ] ) .",
    "summation of diagrammatic series ( [ sz_diagr ] ) for the pseudospin mean value is equivalent to averaging with the mean - field type hamiltonian : @xmath70 where an expression @xmath71 determines an internal effective self - consistent field formed by retarded many - body interaction between pseudospins via conducting electrons",
    ".    equation for pseudospin mean value in the uniform case is as follows @xmath72 where @xmath73 an analytical expression for mean value of the particle number can be presented in the form @xcite : @xmath74 -[1 + 2\\langle s^z\\rangle ] n(\\varepsilon_2)-[1 - 2\\langle s^z\\rangle ] n(\\varepsilon_1).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath75 is fermi distribution .",

    "solution of equation ( [ szsz ] ) is equal to @xmath82 and is different from zero only in a static case ( @xmath83 ) ( since pseudospin operator commutes with the initial hamiltonian ) .    within the same approach the grand canonical potential",
    "was obtained @xcite .",
    "the corresponding analytical expression is @xmath84 it was shown that all quantities can be derived from the grand canonical potential @xmath85 what demonstrates thermodynamic consistence of the proposed approximation .    in the @xmath86 regime",
    "the stable states are determined from the minimum of the grand canonical potential .",
    "the solution of equation for the pseudospin mean value and calculation of potential @xmath7 ( as well as the pair correlation function ) were performed numerically @xcite .",
    "the first order phase transitions between the different uniform phases ( bistability effect ) at change of temperature @xmath40 and field @xmath8 can take place when chemical potential is placed within the electron subbands . in the case",
    "when chemical potential is fixed and placed between the electron subbands , the uniform phase become unstable with respect to fluctuations with @xmath87 , and the possibility of second order phase transitions between the uniform and chess - board phase exists at the change of temperature or field @xcite .",
    "as mentioned above , the band structure is determined by the pseudospin mean value ( figure  [ fig1 ] ) , and its change is accompanied by the corresponding changes of the electron concentration ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "5.cm 5.cm    the simplified version of pem was considered in @xcite within the framework of dmfa scheme as well .",
    "the obtained phase diagrams within the self - consistent grpa and dmfa are presented in figure  [ fig2 ] ( in the case when chemical potential is placed in the center of lower subband @xmath88 ) .",
    "[ 2.5cm][2.5 cm ] 5.5 cm ( a ) [ 2.5cm][2.5 cm ] 5.6 cm ( b )    one can see a quite sufficient coincidence of shapes of the first order phase transition curves ( thick solid line ) .",
    "but unlike to the phase diagram in figure  [ fig2]b obtained within the dmfa , boundaries of the phase stability region calculated in the self - consistent grpa have the same type of slope , hence a region exists , where the vertical line twice crosses the boundary of the phase stability region ( figure  [ fig2]a ) .",
    "the analysis of the @xmath89 behaviour in this region ( for fixed value of the longitudinal field @xmath90 ) with the decrease of temperature shows that high temperature phase becomes unstable with respect to fluctuations with @xmath91 ( the lower crossing point of the vertical line and boundary of the phase stability region in figure  [ fig2]a . ) similar results were obtained previously in @xcite for temperature behaviour of the correlation functions in the case of infinite single - site electron correlation @xmath92 within the framework of the grpa .    in the case of the fixed value of the electron concentration condition of equilibrium",
    "is determined by the minimum of free energy . in this regime",

    "the instability with respect to the phase separation in pseudospin - electron model was marked in @xcite , where it was obtained within the grpa in the limit @xmath92 .",
    "the above considered approach takes into account only contributions of mean field type . in this section",
    "we present the developed in @xcite consistent scheme for calculation of thermodynamic and correlation functions , which takes into account the gaussian fluctuations of the self - consistent mean field .",
    "we also reduce the presented here method to more suitable for numerical calculation taking into account a restricted class of diagrams .",
    "such an approximation for spin models with a direct interaction proposed by onyszkiewicz @xcite yields a much better description of critical properties of spin models in the whole range of temperature then others .    in constructing a higher order approximation that takes into account the fluctuation effects of the self - consistent mean field",
    ", we use the self - consistent grpa as the zero - order one .",
    "this means that all ` single - tail ' parts of diagrams ( [ sz_diagr ] ) and ( [ correlator ] ) are already summed up and all semi - invariants are calculated using the distribution with the hamiltonian @xmath81 ( [ mf ] ) .",
    "all these semi - invariants are represented graphically by thick ovals and contain the @xmath68-symbols on site index : @xmath93    as an approximation that goes beyond of the self - consistent grpa we use , similarly to @xcite , the approach taking into account the so - called ` double - tail ' diagrams . a corresponding diagrammatic series for the pseudospin mean value can be written as @xmath94[.1cm]{\\epsfxsize 9.cm\\epsfbox{diag12.eps}}\\quad .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the diagrammatic equation for the pseudospin correlator @xmath95 within the presented here approximation is similar to the corresponding one within the grpa ( [ szsz ] ) and given by @xmath96[.75cm]{\\epsfysize 1.4cm\\epsfbox{diag13.eps}}\\quad , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] but now all semi - invariants in this equation are renormalized due to the ` double - tail ' parts .",
