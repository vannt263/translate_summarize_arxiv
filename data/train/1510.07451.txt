    "a zero mean curvature ( zmc , for short ) surface in the lorentz - minkowski @xmath0-space @xmath1 is a surface whose mean curvature is identically zero .",
    "a spacelike one and timelike one are often said to be a maximal surface and a timelike minimal surface , respectively .",
    "there has been a lot of studies about these classes .",
    "for example , there are weierstrass - enneper type representation formulas for maximal surfaces ( @xcite ) and timelike minimal surfaces ( @xcite ) similarly to the case of minimal surfaces in the euclidean 3-space @xmath2 . on the other hand ,",
    "in contrast to the case of minimal surfaces in @xmath2 , motivated by calabi s work @xcite , cheng and yau @xcite showed that the only complete maximal surfaces are spacelike planes .",
    "from this fact , more general classes of maximal surfaces with singularities such as _ maxfaces _ in @xcite or _ generalized maximal surfaces _ in @xcite have been frequently studied .",
    "similarly , timelike minimal surfaces with singularities have been studied and many examples constructed . note that we use the word singularities in the sense of points where a surface is not an immersion .",
    "moreover , these surfaces often can be real analytically extended to zmc surfaces which have more than one causal characters .",
    "for example , motivated by the works @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , in @xcite , s. fujimori , y. w. kim , s. e. koh , w. rossman , h. shin , m. umehara , k. yamada , and s. d. yang showed that any maxface which has non - degenerate fold - singularities ( see definition 2.13 in @xcite ) is extended real analytically to a timelike minimal surface . in this extension , the set of fold singularities of the maxface forms a non - degenerate null curve on a zmc surface , where a non - degenerate null curve is a regular curve whose velocity vector field is lightlike and not proportional to its acceleration vector field everywhere . on the other hand ,",
    "there are no similar results for zmc surfaces whose lightlike parts are straight lines , which are degenerate everywhere . however , several zmc surfaces which have exactly two causal characters and their lightlike parts are straight lines were constructed in @xcite , and there is a one - parameter family of zmc surfaces which change their causal characters from spacelike to timelike across a lightlike line constructed in @xcite .",
    "these surfaces are the only known examples of zmc surfaces which change their causal characters from spacelike to timelike across a lightlike line . from this viewpoint , the study of zmc surfaces which have more than one causal characters and especially construction of examples of zmc surfaces containing lightlike lines are important .    in this paper , we deal with non - rotational zmc surfaces foliated by circles and at most countably many straight lines in parallel planes , called zmc surfaces of riemann - type , and study the causal characters of these surfaces .",
    "the notion of circles in @xmath1 is defined by r. lpez ( see for example , @xcite and @xcite ) , and circles in @xmath1 are classified into three cases : euclidean circles , hyperbolas , and parabolas according to causal characters of planes containing circles . therefore , the class of zmc surfaces of riemann - type foliated by these circles is large enough to include some important exmples of zmc surfaces containing lightlike lines .",
    "spacelike and timelike zmc surfaces of riemann - type and , more generally , constant mean curvature surfaces foliated by circles in @xmath1 have been studied in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , etc .",
    "r. lpez @xcite and honda - koiso - tanaka @xcite constructed the following parametrizations of zmc surfaces of riemann - type foliated by circles in spacelike parallel planes which appear as the general solutions of a system of odes ( see remark [ remark : ode1 ] ) , and they studied causal characters of these surfaces : @xmath3 where @xmath4 .",
    "the causal characters of the above surfaces are determined by the constants @xmath5 and @xmath6 and the shape of the domain @xmath7 , that is , there may be several maximal surfaces , timelike minimal surfaces , and surfaces which have more than one causal characters in the above class . in this paper",
    ", we classify all zmc surfaces of riemann - type according to their causal characters .",
    "more precisely , we prove the following result ( theorem [ thm : causalofspacelike ] .",
    "( 1 ) ) :    causal characters of the above surface @xmath8 is determined as follows :    1 .",
    "@xmath8 is spacelike if and only if @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath8 is timelike if and only if  @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",

    "@xmath8 has both timelike part and lightlike part and it does not have timelike part if and only if @xmath13 and @xmath14 . moreover , in this case the lightlike part of the surface is a part of a straight line .",
    "the surfaces except those stated above are surfaces which have all causal characters .",
    "moreover , in the case that @xmath15 and @xmath16 , the lightlike part of the surface consists of a part of a straight line and two non - degenerate null curves .",
    "in addition to the above surfaces , we found the following new zmc surfaces of riemann - type which appear as the singular solutions of a system of odes ( see remark [ remark : ode1 ] ) : @xmath17 and prove that these surfaces have timelike part and two lightlike lines ( theorem [ thm : causalofspacelike ] .",
    "we also found zmc surfaces foliated by hyperbolas and parabolas which appear as singular solutions of systems of odes , and determined causal characters of these surfaces and zmc surfaces of riemann - type which appear as general solutions constructed by r. lpez @xcite ( theorem [ thm : causaloftimelike ] and [ thm : causaloflightlike ] ) .",

    "however , as mentioned above , zmc surfaces containing lightlike lines have not been sufficiently discussed .",
    "there are not so many known examples of zmc surfaces containing lightlike lines . in section 5 ,",
    "we determine the characteristics of zmc surfaces of riemann - type containing lightlike lines which appear in the above corollary [ corb ] and the one exceptional case ( theorem [ thm : sp ] ( 1 ) ( iii ) ) and show that there are one or two - parameter families of zmc surfaces of riemann - type which have a lightlike line with characteristics @xmath18 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 .    in section 6 , we consider zmc entire graphs which have all causal characters .",
    "calabi @xcite showed that there are no maximal entire graphs except for linear functions .",
    "however , o. kobayashi @xcite found zmc entire graphs which are called _ the helicoid of 2nd kind _ and _ scherk s surface of 1st kind _ ( see ( [ eq:6.1 ] ) and ( [ eq:6.2 ] ) , respectively ) .",
    "these zmc entire graphs have all causal characters . in this paper , we obtain the following new zmc entire graph of riemann - type which is foliated by parabolas and has all causal characters : @xmath24 most recently , this surface was also constructed independently by fujimori , kawakami , kokubu , rossman , umehara and yamada @xcite from a different viewpoint .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows : in section 2 , we first introduce basic notations and local theory of surfaces in @xmath1 .",
    "the most important notion is the causal characters of a surface ( definition [ def : causal ] ) . in section 3 ,",
    "we review the parameterizations of zmc surfaces of riemann - type foliated by euclidean circles , hyperbolas , and parabolas , which were constructed mainly by r. lpez in @xcite and give new zmc surfaces of riemann - type which appear the as sngular solutions of a system of odes ( theorems [ theorem : parameterizations of zmc surfaces foliated by circles ] , [ theorem : parameterizations of zmc surfaces foliated by hyperbolas ] , and [ thm : lightlike ] ) . in section 4 ,",
    "we determine the causal characters of all zmc surfaces of riemann - type ( theorems [ thm : causalofspacelike ] , [ thm : causaloftimelike ] , and [ thm : causaloflightlike ] ) and prove the above corollary [ corb ] .",
