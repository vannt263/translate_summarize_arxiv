    "the design or configuration of a cross - correlation imaging interferometer , the placement of the antennas , presents a challenge because the properties desired for imaging can not all be optimized simultaneously .",
    "imaging interferometers such as those used in radio astronomy construct a picture of the sky from a set of measured fourier components .",
    "each pair of antennas in a multi - antenna array measures one fourier component whose scale or spatial wavelength is proportional to the distance between the pair and whose direction is aligned with their orientation .",
    "the entire set of fourier components is given by all the possible pairs , and the point source response or the beam of the telescope is given by their fourier transform .",
    "thus the relative locations of the antennas determines the quality of the images obtained by the telescope @xcite .",
    "the impossibility of obtaining an infinite set of fourier components requires choices as trade - offs among different qualities desired for imaging .",
    "for example , the extent or size of the array should be small because the atmospheric phase coherence decreases with distance and also because the construction is easier . at the same time",
    ", the width of the beam or point - source response should also be small to achieve high angular resolution . because the sizes of the array and the beam are related through the fourier transform of the antenna separations , these two goals amount to minimizing both the extent of a function and the extent of its fourier transform .",
    "the challenge is that the two generally have an inverse relationship , one big the other small .",
    "another challenge lies in the trade - off between the angular resolution and the level of the side lobes around the main beam .",
    "the highest angular resolution requires as many long spatial wavelength fourier components ( antenna separations ) as possible .",
    "this requires a sharp cut - off in the number of components at the maximum spatial wavelength ( antenna separation ) because a smooth transition to the maximum necessarily implies a decreasing number of components nearing the limit .",
    "the sharper the transition , the larger the side lobes so that generally , the higher the angular resolution , the higher the side lobe levels .",
    "a further design goal is complete sampling of the fourier plane .",
    "although imaging requirements might push the distribution to emphasize shorter or longer wavelength spatial frequencies , gaps in the distribution represent missing information and allow unfaithful imaging .",
    "the assumption is that the likelihood of a significant error in the estimate of a fourier component increases with the distance in fourier space from the component to the measurement .",
    "therefore , the best estimate of the strength of a fourier component is a nearby measurement , and the distribution of separations should minimize the maximum distance from any point in the fourier plane to the nearest measurement .    in summary , four design goals :    1 .",
    "high angular resolution 2 .",
    "concentrated power , low side lobes 3 .",
    "compact array size 4 .",
    "uniform or smooth distribution of fourier components    how do we design arrays to fulfill these goals ?",
    "how do we measure success ? do the trade - offs define a continuous space with the different goals at the vertices of a polyhedral boundary ?",
    "can we position our design within this space to best meet the imaging requirements of a particular application ?",
    "must we rely on numerical optimization that might provide a configuration but no explanation leaving doubt that we have found the best possible design ?",
    "this paper introduces array configurations built on a hierarchy made by repeating one simple array configuration on different scales . in this construction ,",
    "the relationships between the antenna locations , their separations , and the beam are simple enough to provide answers to these questions .",
    "for example , hierarchical or h - arrays can be designed to achieve either higher angular resolution or a more concentrated beam with lower side lobes by simply changing the scaling between the levels of the hierarchy to emphasize shorter or longer spatial wavelength fourier components . because h - arrays are nested and scaled , the choice can be made in the design stage by scaling the separation between the hierarchies , or for arrays designed with more possible locations than antennas , the beam can be varied by populating different levels of the hierarchy .",
    "this makes h - arrays particularly well suited for the strategy employed by most radio astronomy interferometers of periodically rearranging a smaller number of antennas among a larger number of locations to observe different angular scales .",
    "h - arrays will be useful for future interferometers with many antennas .",
    "two well - known fourier transform pairs @xcite illustrate the trade - offs and suggest that there is a functional form for a continuously varying aperture distribution resulting in a beam pattern that can be varied smoothly between the design goals . for the moment , suppose that we have complete control over the aperture distribution , and can assume an ideal continuous distribution .",
    "we will come back to the question of how an array can be configured to provide the required aperture .",
    "first , consider a uniform distribution across the aperture . in one - dimension",
    "this would be a boxcar function or in two dimensions a uniform disk .",
    "the beam pattern is the fourier transform of the aperture distribution , which for one and two dimensions respectively , is the sinc function , @xmath0 , and the function @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a bessel function . in the two - dimensional case ,",
    "the power pattern , or the square of the beam , is the airy function .",
    "the beam and power patterns are shown in figure [ fig : ftpair ] .",
    "the angular resolution of the beam power is @xmath3 , the wavelength of the observing frequency divided by the diameter of the aperture .",
    "for example , if the aperture is 1000 m in diameter and the observing frequency is 230 ghz , then the angular resolution , measured by the width of the power in the main beam , is 0.27 arc seconds , full - width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) .",
    "however , a significant amount of the power is outside the main beam in the side lobes .",
    "the encircled energy , or the percentage of the total beam power as a function of radius is a measure of the concentration of the power in the main beam .",
    "the beam of a 1000 m uniform aperture at 230 ghz contains 98% of the power within a radius of 1.53 arc seconds .",
    "@xmath4{sinc_eeplot }   \\includegraphics[trim=0.10 in 0.3 in 0.8 in 0.2 in , clip , width=2.75in]{gauss_eeplot } \\\\",
    "\\end{array } $ ]    in contrast , consider a gaussian distribution whose fourier transform is also a gaussian with an inverse relation in widths , @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "because the gaussian has no side lobes other than its own extended wings , all the power is concentrated in the main beam .",
    "however , the inverse relation between the widths in the real and fourier domains means that a large array size is required to achieve a small beam size .",
    "furthermore a gaussian aperture must be truncated at a finite radius .",
    "a gaussian aperture of 1000 m diameter with a width of one - half the radius or @xmath7 has an angular resolution of @xmath8 arc seconds .",
    "this is significantly broader than the beam of a uniform aperture , but the encircled energy of the gaussian is more concentrated .",
    "the radius encircling 98% of the total power in 2.15 arc sec is 0.35 arc seconds .",
    "the beam and power patterns are shown in figure [ fig : ftpair ] .",
    "the figures of merit are listed in table [ table : merit ] .",
    "these two fourier transform pairs illustrate two different trade - offs : first , between the angular resolution and the size of the array ; and second between the angular resolution and the encircled energy which is sensitive to the amount of power in side lobes .",
    "in general , the best apertures are a compromise between these two extremes , a uniform distribution with a smoothed or apodized boundary .",
    "for example , a sigmoid such as the logistic function @xmath9 defines a curve which is uniform , equal to one in its interior , and has a smooth boundary at @xmath10 whose transition width , @xmath11 , can be continuously varied . figure",
    "[ fig : logistic ] ( _ left _ ) shows two aperture distributions made with the logistic function with different values for the width of the boundary , @xmath11 = 50 and 42 m , and its location , @xmath10 = 250 and 333 m. both apertures are truncated at a radius of 500 m. both beams ( figure [ fig : logistic ] _ right _ ) have broader fwhm and lower side lobes than the beam of the idealized uniform aperture with a sharp boundary ( figure [ fig : ftpair ] ) .",
    "the comparison here shows additionally that the side lobes decrease with the increasing width or smoothness of the boundary while the beam width increases , and the angular resolution decreases .",
    "@xmath4{logistic_uv }   \\includegraphics[trim=0.10 in 0.3 in 0.8 in 0.2 in , clip , width=2.75in]{logistic_beam } \\\\",
    "\\end{array } $ ]    finally , we must come back to the constraint that the aperture distribution is not arbitrary but given by the separations of the individual antennas .",
    "the relationship between the pattern of antenna locations and the pattern of their separations is not always obvious . particularly with earth rotation synthesis ( ers )",
    "@xcite , it is a challenge to arrange the individual antennas to create a desired distribution from the sum of their separations .",
    "the fourth design goal indicates how well the antenna separations approximate a continuous distribution .",
    "one of the first arrays for radio astronomy , the mills cross @xcite had regularly - spaced dipole antennas aligned in the shape of a cross which provided a square aperture with a regularly - spaced , two - dimenensional grid of fourier components .",
    "@xcite developed an interferometer with more sampling efficiency by eliminating one of the arms , which changed the cross to a t - shape , and by locating the antennas with non - uniform spacing in such a way as to minimize the number of separations of the same length .",
    "minimum redundancy is an advantange particularly for interferometers that use expensive parabolic - dish antennas rather than dipoles .",
    "the theory of minimum redundancy was further explored by @xcite and extended to a large number of antennas by @xcite .",
    "interferometers such as the hat creek observatory / bima @xcite , the owens valley radio observatory millimeter array @xcite , and the plateau de bure interferometer @xcite , among others , are t - shaped arrays designed for fourier sampling with minimum redundancy .    the very large array ( vla ) @xcite improves on the t - shape by arranging the 3 arms in a y - shape which provides better sampling when used in ers .",
    "a typical astronomical observation is about 8 hours , or one - third of a complete rotation .",
    "the antennas are distributed along the arms according to a power - law spacing .",
    "this creates a non - uniform sampling that allows a higher dynamic range between the smallest and the largest measured fourier component .",
    "in contrast , the submillimeter array interferometer is designed to to provide uniform and non - redundant fourier sampling for high image fidelity @xcite .",
    "uniform coverage is discussed more immediately below (  [ cw ] ) and power - law spacings in  [ spiralarrays ] .",
    "yet another design goal , a gaussian - shaped beam , was used to design the configurations for the combined array for research in millimeter astronomy ( carma ) @xcite . the large number of antennas of the recently built atacama large millimeter array ( alma ) @xcite allows more flexibility to shape the beam , and there are three different design goals for configurations of different scale .",
    "the most compact configuration seeks to minimize side lobe levels , the intermediate is a spiral pattern with a gaussian beam in mind , and the most extended is a `` y '' shape modified to reduce the side lobes of the beam @xcite .",
    "examples of the three configurations are shown in  [ alma ] .",
    "the long wavelength array ( lwa ) distributes 256 antennas in a uniform random pattern that is modified to reduce the side lobe levels @xcite .",
    "random arrays are discussed in  [ random ] .",
    "one proposed design for the square kilometer array ( ska ) puts the antennas along logarithmic spirals and seeks to minimize large gaps in the fourier sampling @xcite .",
    "spiral arrays are discussed in  [ spiralarrays ] and the minimum gap criterion in  [ minimax ] .",
    "the study presented here in this article does not discuss the merits of different design goals .",
    "these depend on the particular scientific aims of the observatories and their particular constraints , for example , the number of antennas .",
    "the different designs of the observatories listed above represent a significant diversity of goals , and the list does not even include all radio astronomy arrays .",
    "rather , this paper shows how array design can be understood in terms of trade - offs between different goals and how the design process can be simplified by a hierarchical strategy that allows the designer to place the array at a desired point between the trade - offs .",
    "the hierarchical arrays introduced in this paper are constructed by repeating a simple configuration , a subarray , on multiple scales .",
    "a good choice for the repeating pattern is one of the configurations that approximates uniform sampling in the fourier plane .",
    "this property ensures that for each scale the gaps in the fourier coverage , or more precisely the separations between sampling points are all about the same size .",
    "since they are a basis for the h - arrays , it is worth reviewing the properties of the configurations that provide the best uniform coverage .",
    "a previous paper showed that arrays designed on the figures known as curves of constant width ( cw ) come closest to approximating a uniform aperture distribution @xcite .",
    "these figures are in the shape of closed rings .",
    "the name , constant - width , refers to the diameter .",
    "these curves have the property that from any point on the curve , the maximum distance to the opposite side , effectively the diameter , is always the same .",
    "this guarantees that the boundary of the aperture and its fourier transform , the beam , are both circular .",
    "for example , the circle , which by definition has a constant diameter , is a curve of constant width .",
    "the circle can be thought of as a cw - curve with an infinite number of sides .",
    "the reuleaux triangle is the limiting case of a cw - curve with the least ( three ) number of sides .",
    "of the two , the reuleaux triangle is preferred for array design and was adopted for the design of the submillimeter array .",
    "the uniform aperture distribution with its @xmath1 beam approximated by a cw - array lies toward one end of our space of design trade - offs accomplishing three of the design goals , high angular resolution , compact array size , and uniform sampling but at the expense of rather high side lobes .",
    "the uniform sampling has another attractive feature . in imaging applications",
    ", the uniform sampling allows the measured fourier components to be combined with equal weights ( `` natural weighting '' in radio astronomy ) and therefore achieves the highest sensitivity simultaneously with uniform sampling .",
    "cw - arrays are a good choice for interferometers that have relatively few antennas and therefore deeply cherish each individual fourier component and regret weighting down any of them .",
    "furthermore , a small number of antennas limits the flexibility to shape the beam , and the small number of measured fourier components necessarily results in high side lobes which , unavoidable , are therefore less of a design concern .",
    "imaging with high side lobes relies on numerical techniques to deconvolve the beam pattern from the image @xcite .",
    "cw - arrays are also the best choice for dithering patterns for flat - fielding multi - pixel imaging arrays @xcite . in this application",
    "the goal is to measure the relative sensitivity of all the pixels in a sensor array such as a ccd .",
    "one possibility is to point the telescope repeatedly until each pixel has viewed the same patch of sky .",
    "this requires many observations , one for each pixel in the array , but each comparison to determine the relative sensitivity of two pixels requires the use of only two measurements .",
    "another possibility is to point the telescope only twice in such a way that the view is shifted by one pixel .",
    "each pixel then views the patch of sky previously viewed by its neighbor , and the sensitivity of neighboring pixels may be measured relative to each other .",
    "the relative sensitivity of all the pixels is found by working across the array comparing neighboring pixels .",
    "this requires only two observations , but the number of comparisons needed to determine the sensitivity of any two pixels increases with their separation .",
    "the noise in each intermediate measurement and comparison reduces the accuracy of the flat - fielding .",
    "the optimal strategy uses as few observations and as few intermediate comparisons as possible .",
    "this is achieved by distributing the pointing shifts uniformly across the space of all possible shifts , exactly analagous to the problem of distributing the separations of antennas uniformly across their separation space . in their study , @xcite objectively compared a number of different array designs and verified that the cw - arrays provide the best approximation to uniform sampling .",
    "the spitzer space telescope uses an observing pattern based on the reuleaux triangle for imaging with its infrared cameras .",
    "the simplest example of cw - array is the six - element pattern in figure [ fig : s6 ] whose separations are uniformly distributed on an hexagonal grid .",
    "the antenna coordinates are given in table [ table : s6positions ] .",
    "visually there appears to be a hole in the center that is missing a separation .",
    "this is a separation of zero , or equivalently the fourier component of zero spatial wavelength corresponding to the total power .",
    "all interferometers are missing this measurement .",
    "figure [ fig : s6 ] shows that the distance between all the separations , including the distance from the smallest separations to the zero point , is exactly one . in this sense , the configuration is not missing short spacings .",
    "the shortest spacing is set by the distance between the pairs of antennas on each side of the reuleaux triangle which of course can be made arbitrarily small .",
    "the reason the central hole in the coverage looks larger in this array than in other arrays with non - uniform coverage is because the uniform coverage limits the size of the largest separation .",
    "for example , arrays with a power - law distribution of antenna separations achieve a higher ratio of the largest to smallest separations , higher spatial dynamic range , but only by leaving larger holes in the coverage at larger spatial wavelengths",
    ". however , in these non - uniform arrays , the central hole looks smaller with respect to the total extent of the non - uniform coverage . the next section ,  [ example36 ] , shows that one advantage of hierarchical arrays is that this central hole can be filled by a smaller scale in the hierarchy .    while the uv coverage in ers is no longer strictly uniform , the mid - points of the ers tracks are still on the original uniform grid",
    "this means that arrays that have good snapshot coverage generally have good coverage in ers even though the coverage in snapshot and ers is not the same .",
    "figure [ fig : s6 ] shows the tracks of the separations ( baselines in radio astronomy ) in an 8.2 hr ers assuming the array is located at a latitude of 23@xmath12 and the target transits through the zenith . as shown in the figure , ers generates a pattern of tracks , or an effective aperture , slightly larger in extent north - south than east - west .",
    "this is because the target is low on the horizon at the beginning and end of the track when it is rising and setting . at these times from the vantage point of the target ,",
    "the array and its antenna separations appear shortened by projection .",
    "this results in uv coverage that is narrower and a beam pattern that is wider in the east - west direction than north - south .",
    "it is trivial to make the beam circular by adjusting the aspect ratio of the array , but the correction is also a function of the declination of the target .",
