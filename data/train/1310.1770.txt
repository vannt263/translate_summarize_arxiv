    "bound states of light quarks , and the @xmath0 meson in particular , represent a challenging testbed for our understanding of the strong interaction .",
    "theoretical approaches to their description are split into two directions . from the high - energy side , the quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , which is widely believed to be a fundamental theory of the strong force ,",
    "becomes strongly coupled at the relevant energy scales , so trustable perturbative calculations help a little in quantitative description of precise low - energy data , which there is no lack of . from the low - energy side ,",
    "a number of successful models to describe the data have been developed . to be quantitative ,",
    "they necessarily require some phenomenological input .",
    "none of these models can be consistently and quantitatively derived from the qcd lagrangian , therefore a gap between the two approaches emerges .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to contribute to filling this gap by making a bridge between a successful low - energy model and the high - energy qcd calculation .",
    "we choose the electromagnetic form factor of the charged pion as the observable to study .    while most of the approaches fall into one of two groups , that is either low - energy ( soft ) or high - energy ( hard ) ones , and",
    "therefore can not address the intermediate ( transition ) range of typical energies or momenta , there are some remarkable attempts to cover all energy scales within a single framework .",
    "one is the numerical non - perturbative qcd realized at the lattice . despite a considerable success ,",
    "technical difficulties presently prevent it from obtaining reliable quantitative results for light mesons at intermediate momenta .",
    "another approach is based on the holographic duality between strongly and weakly coupled theories which , for qcd , has not been rigorously proven , though works well in a number of phenomenological applications . by definition , any duality construction is uneasy to implement quantitatively at intermediate energies , where both dual theories are moderately strongly coupled .",
    "our goal here is less ambitious .",
    "we adopt frameworks of a particular relativistic constituent - quark model with low - energy phenomenological parameters included and study how the qcd asymptotics is reached within this particular model .",
    "the asymptotics of the pion electromagnetic form factor @xmath4 at momenta transfer @xmath5 has been determined @xcite , in the qcd frameworks , as @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the one - loop running strong coupling constant , @xmath8 is the first beta - function coefficient , @xmath9 is the number of active quark flavours and @xmath10  mev @xcite is the pion decay constant .",
    "it is important to note that this asymptotical behaviour , consistent with the quark counting rules @xcite , includes the one - loop coupling only and is to be modified whenever the one - loop approximation fails , but not by means of a simple replacing of @xmath11 with its more precise value .",
    "involved qcd calculations have been performed to obtain corrections to eq .",
    "( [ eq : as ] ) , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "the qcd does not predict the value of @xmath12 at which this asymptotics should be reached .    on the other hand , the experimental data on @xmath4",
    "( see e.g.ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) are well described by a number of low - energy nonperturbative models , provided some phenomenological parameters are tuned . in most cases , these models do not attempt to describe the soft - hard transitions ( see however a few important exceptions discussed in sec .  [ sec : formfactor : results ] ) . to our best knowledge ,",
    "none of the successful low - energy models have described quantitatively and without dedicated tuning of parameters how the asymptotics ( [ eq : as ] ) settles down , given the experimental data .",
    "we attempt to do it in the present work .",
    "we start with a well - established poincar - invariant constituent - quark model  @xcite which has , for our purposes , the following three advantages :    * * predictivity * : starting from the experimental data on @xmath13 at @xmath14  gev@xmath15 @xcite , this approach allowed to predict , in 1998 , the values of the pion form factor for the extended range of higher momentum transfer @xcite .",
    "the experimental data obtained later ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) for the range of @xmath16 larger by an order of magnitude coincide precisely with the prediction of ref .",
    "@xcite without any further tuning of parameters ; * * robustness * : the behaviour of @xmath17 at moderate and high @xmath12 does not depend on the selected wave function and is determined by the constituent - quark mass only  @xcite ; * * asymptotical behaviour * : it has been mathematically proven  @xcite that in the limit @xmath5 and the constituent - quark mass @xmath18 , the qcd asymptotical behaviour , @xmath19 , is obtained in this model .    the points ( ii ) , ( iii ) suggest a following concept @xcite to study the soft - hard transition for @xmath4",
    ". one should adopt the successful low - energy framework and supplement it with a @xmath12-dependent quark mass @xmath20 , which should be equal to a constituent - quark mass at @xmath21 but should fall at @xmath22 to provide the correct @xmath18 limit . in this work ,",
    "we accept a dependence of @xmath23 motivated by other studies and fulfill this program .    as a result",
    ", we obtain a quantitative description of the hard - soft transition .",
    "we will see that , given the experimental data , this transition should not take place at low @xmath12 .",
    "therefore , the data on @xmath4 constrain possible models for @xmath23 and indicate the presence of large nonperturbative contributions to the light quark mass at least up to @xmath24  gev@xmath3 .",

    "[ sec : formfactor : results ] , where the comparison with other approaches is also given .",
    "we briefly conclude in sec .",
    "[ sec : concl ] and list some cumbersome formulae in the appendix .",
    "our method is a version of the instant form of the poincar invariant constituent - quark model ( picqm ) .",
    "this model is described in detail in refs .",
    "briefly , the model is constructed as follows . in the instant form (",
    "if ) of the relativistic hamiltonian dynamics ( see e.g.  ref .",
    "@xcite ) one considers two non - interacting one - particle states .",
    "then one separates the center - of - mass motion of the system as a whole and , by means of the wigner - eckart theorem for the poincar group , extracts the reduced matrix elements , that is form factors @xcite . to include the interaction , one finds solutions to the muskhelishvili - omnes type equations .",
    "these solutions represent wave functions of constituent quarks .",
    "it is important to notice that the approach we use differs from the if _ per se _ but it was rather fruitfully complemented by the so - called modified impulse approximation ( mia ) , see ref .",
    "mia is constructed by making use of a dispersion - relation approach and removes certain ( often quoted ) disadvantages of the if .",
    "in particular , our framework is fully relativistic .",
    "the final result for the pion form factor , @xmath17 , is given by a double integral representation , @xmath25 where @xmath26 , @xmath27 is the picqm pion wave function and @xmath28 is the free two - particle form factor . the latter may be obtained explicitly by the methods of relativistic kinematics and is a relativistic invariant function ; its actual form is rather cumbersome and is given in appendix for reference .",
    "( [ eq : fpi - integral ] ) , @xmath29{s}\\,u(k)k\\ ] ] and a phenomenological wave function @xmath30 is to be supplied .",
    "fortunately , as it has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the behaviour of the form factor is insensitive to the choice of the wave function provided a phenomenological boundary condition ( correct pion charge radius @xmath31 ) is satisfied and the correct value of the pion decay constant @xmath32 is reproduced . in the present work ,",
    "we use the power - law type wave function ( see e.g.  ref .",
    "@xcite ) , @xmath33 where the normalization coefficient @xmath34 and @xmath35 is a phenomenological parameter related to the confinement scale .",
    "several other wave functions were shown in refs .",
    "@xcite to give the same result for the form factor , provided its low - energy behaviour is fixed by fitting the pion charge radius with a single wave - function parameter , @xmath35 in our case .",
    "the behaviour of @xmath17 at @xmath36  gev@xmath3 , given this fit , is completely determined by @xmath20 , as it has been demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite where calculations have been performed for various @xmath20 and different wave - function parametrizations .",
    "the asymptotical behaviour of @xmath17 has been studied in ref .",
    "@xcite by considering , mathematically , the @xmath22 limit . in this limit",
    ", the original model has two essential dimensionful parameters , the quark mass @xmath20 and the confinement scale @xmath35 .",
    "it has been demonstrated that at @xmath18 , that is @xmath37 , the qcd asymptotical quark - counting rules are reproduced , @xmath38 . as we will demonstrate below in the present work ( sec .",
    "[ sec : formfactor : results ] ) by numerical calculations , the constant of eq .",
    "( [ eq : as ] ) is also properly reproduced in the @xmath18 limit .",
    "this is a remarkable success of the model .      to merge the correct low - energy behaviour ( which suggests the constituent - quark mass @xmath20 of order the confinement scale @xmath35 ) with the correct qcd asymptotics ( which requires @xmath37 as we have just discussed above )",
    ", one should describe the transition between the two regimes by means of a momentum - dependent effective quark mass @xmath23 .",
    "we will now discuss possible approaches to determination of this function and formulate our prescriptions .",
    "since the current - quark mass @xmath39 , a parameter of the qcd lagrangian , experiences the renormalization - group running and is thus scale - dependent , one might be tempted to identify this @xmath40 dependence with the one we are seeking for @xmath20 .",
    "if this were true , the mass @xmath39 , when running from large values of @xmath12 down to @xmath41 , where the qcd coupling becomes really strong , should acquire large non - perturbative corrections which in turn should increase the mass by two orders of magnitude . the renormalization - group equation for @xmath39",
    "has the schematic form @xmath42 where @xmath43 does not depend explicitly on @xmath39 . for a small @xmath39",
    "this indicates a small derivative , so light particles should remain light unless extreme nonperturbative effects blow up @xmath43 .",
    "the latter possibility is in principle possible , and some authors attempted to run @xmath40 all the way down to @xmath44 under certain assumptions about non - perturbative renormalization ( see e.g.ref .",
    "the mass @xmath45 obtained in this way was significantly lower than the constituent - quark mass @xmath20 inferred from phenomenological models .",
    "this is not surprising , however , because , as is most clearly stated in the `` quark masses '' review @xcite of the particle data group , the consituent - quark masses _ `` make sense in the limited context of a particular quark model , and can not be related to the quark mass parameters of the standard model''_. therefore , we should consider the @xmath12 dependence of the constituent - quark mass @xmath20 starting from its infrared value and can not impose the qcd value of @xmath39 as a precise boundary condition for @xmath23 defined in a particular model .",
    "the function @xmath23 should decrease at large @xmath12 to reflect fading of non - perturbative effects , but , being defined in a model - dependent way , it should not be identified with @xmath39 anywhere .",
    "there are some remarkable approaches to quantifying this non - perturbative mass `` running '' .",
    "one is based on the gap equation supplemented by the effective confining propagator for gluons and a one - gluon exchange for constituent quarks @xcite .",
    "the resulting @xmath23 function was obtained numerically in ref .",
    "@xcite by means of a solution to a certain integral equation .",
    "it depends on the following four parameters : the confinement scale , two infrared dynamical mass scales and @xmath46 .",
    "while all these parameters are of the same order , one should vary all of them to obtain phenomenologically acceptable results .",
    "another approach to @xmath23 is based on the dyson - schwinger equations in qcd @xcite .",
    "it requires assumptions for the behaviour of the strong coupling constant in the non - perturbative domain which might be quantified with introducing several free parameters ( cf.five parameters described in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    ref .",
    "@xcite explored varying quark mass @xmath23 in the context of a light - front constituent - quark model , the approach close to the one we follow here .",
    "they adopted a parametrization @xmath47 with @xmath48 , which describes a step - like transition from @xmath49 to @xmath50 at @xmath51 , while the parameter @xmath52 is responsible for the smoothness of the transition ( @xmath53 corresponds to a step ) .",
    "again , this functional form has four parameters .",
    "this form has been subsequently used in other studies @xcite .",
    "we note that changes in free parameters result in considerable variations of the @xmath23 profile in any of the frameworks , while evaluation of @xmath23 for each set of parameters , which we have to perform multiple times in our approach , represents a serious numerical task if we choose a dynamical model like refs .",
    "therefore we , in a way similar to ref .",
    "@xcite , also choose an ad hoc parametrization  ( [ eq : mass - run ] ) ; however , we modify it by setting @xmath54 to better approximate available examples of @xmath23 obtained by detailed calculations , as illustrated in fig .  [",

    "@xcite ( thick full lines ) , for various sets of parameters . ]",
    "we note that eq.([eq : mass - run - log ] ) does not introduce additional free parameters with respect to eq.([eq : mass - run ] ) but improves significantly the approximation of results of ref .",
    "@xcite by imitating the one - gluon - exchange logarithmic contribution .",
    "altogether , the model we use here have the following parameters : the wave - function confinement scale @xmath35 ; the infrared and ultraviolet mass asymptotics @xmath55 , @xmath56 and the two parameters @xmath57 and @xmath52 which describe the shape of @xmath23 , eqs .",

    "appendix , are taken from the previous studies  @xcite and kept fixed . ] .",
    "two of them , @xmath55 and @xmath35 , correspond to parameters we had in the model with constant @xmath20 ; like previously , we tune them to reproduce two observable quantities : the pion decay constant @xmath32 and its charge radius @xmath62 .",

    "the derivation of eq .",
    "( [ eq : fpi ] ) implies the zero - momentum limit  @xcite , therefore one should identify @xmath64 in this formula .",
    "we use the most recent particle data group  @xcite value of @xmath65  mev .",
    "the pion charge radius is related to the form factor as @xmath66 hereafter , we use the experimental data on @xmath4 discussed in ref .  @xcite .",
    "in particular , we exclude some of the early ( 1976 - 1978 ) measurements which , according to ref .",
    "@xcite , may have large and unknown systematic uncertainties .",
    "since the particle data group world average value of @xmath67 is strongly affected by these old data , we take instead the most precise value of ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath68  fm .",
    "this is consistent with using the low - momentum data points of ref .",
    "@xcite when constraining @xmath57 and @xmath52 as discussed below .",
    "equations ( [ eq : fpi ] ) and ( [ eq : msr ] ) , both related to the @xmath69 limit , allow us to fix @xmath70  gev and @xmath71  gev . not surprisingly , these values are very close to those used in previous works on the same model ( @xmath55 is precisely the same while a minor change in @xmath35 reflects the change in the world - average value of @xmath32 used ) .",
    "the two parameters @xmath57 and @xmath52 remain unconstrained at this step .",
    "to proceed further , we note that the experimental values of @xmath17 at all momentum transfers covered by the data , that is @xmath72  gev@xmath3 for the data we use , are in a perfect agreement  @xcite with the predictions  @xcite of the model with @xmath73 .",
    "given the fact that the behaviour of @xmath17 is determined by @xmath20 , see sec .",
    "[ sec : model : constituent ] , significant deviations from @xmath55 below @xmath74  gev@xmath3 may spoil the agreement .",
    "therefore , we determine a constraint on @xmath57 and @xmath52 from the agreement with experimental data on @xmath4 , quantified as the 95% confidence - level contour on the @xmath75 plane obtained by the standard @xmath76 analysis ( fig .",

    "these data are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : fpi6gev ] and the references are given in its caption .",
    "this however leaves unconstrained the situation when @xmath23 remains large at arbitrary high @xmath12 , since the result with @xmath77 gives an excellent description of the existing data .",
    "one may think of an additional , optional constraint on @xmath78 related to perturbativity at large @xmath12 . clearly , this condition is qualitative and",
    "may be formulated in a number of ways .",
    "we note that the recent lattice calculations of the running strong coupling constant ( see e.g.  ref .",
    "@xcite ) indicate the agreement with perturbative values at the scales of order 5  gev and higher .",
    "we therefore consider , rather arbitrarily , a condition @xmath79  gev .",
    "neither the precise form nor the very existence of this constraint affect the principal results of this work .",

    "the lower bound on the allowed @xmath17 is determined by the 95% c.l .",
    "limit from the present experimental data .",
    "the first and immediate conclusion is that the asymptotics  ( [ eq : as ] ) does settle down at @xmath82 , where @xmath83 .",
    "not only the correct behaviour @xmath84 is observed ( it was expected from analytical calculations of ref .",
    "@xcite ) , but also the coefficient in eq .  ( [ eq : as ] ) is reproduced numerically , independently of the selected shape of the @xmath23 function .",
    "this , seemingly miraculous , result indicates a deep connection between low- and high - energy degrees of freedom in our model which will be discussed elsewhere ( see however sec .",

    "@xcite , an extended version of ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the second important implication of our results is that the present measurements of @xmath4 constrain the evolution of @xmath23 far beyond the momentum transfers covered by the data .",
    "we see that the effective constituent - quark mass should remain large , @xmath85 , at least up to @xmath86 .",
    "therefore , nonperturbative dynamics is important at these scales and the qcd asymptotics of the pion form factor shall start settling down at even higher values of the momentum transfer .",
    "let us briefly compare our results with other attempts to describe the transition from soft to hard behaviour of the pion form factor .",
    "a widely used approach to the calculation of the pion form factor , as well as of other observables , is based on the light - front quantization , see ref .",
    "in particular , it has been applied to the calculation of both soft and hard contributions to the pion form factor more than two decades ago @xcite .",
    "it was pursued also in ref .",
    "@xcite , the concept of which is the most close to ours . the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite , however , did not obtain the asymptotics ( [ eq : as ] ) .",
    "this fact may be related to properties of the constituent - quark model they used : crucial properties ( ii ) and ( iii ) of our model , see introduction , may not hold for other approaches .",
    "an alternative development of the light - front approach is related to holography  @xcite .",
    "the results of ref .",
    "@xcite illustrate general trends observed in numerous papers which we can not review here ( see e.g.  the review in ref .",

    "a number of successful approaches therefore give a good description of the data but do not address the high-@xmath12 behaviour of @xmath4 at all .    the picture similar to what we observe ,",
    "that is the @xmath89const behaviour at large @xmath12 , has been observed only in ref .",

    "the model was supplemented by a model of effective @xmath12-dependent quark mass motivated by other studies . as a result",
    ", we obtained a quantitative description of the transition from the soft constituent - quark regime to the hard qcd asymptotics for the pion form factor .",
    "when the quark mass is switched off , the model reproduces the qcd asymptotics ( both the @xmath95 behaviour and the coefficient ) of the pion form factor without tuning of parameters , provided the low - energy data are well described .",
    "secondly , we demonstrated that the existing @xmath4 data indicates that the perturbative qcd fails to describe the pion at momentum transfers at least as large as @xmath96  gev@xmath3 .",

    "<S> we adopt a non - perturbative relativistic constituent - quark model for the @xmath0-meson electromagnetic form factor , which have successfully predicted experimental results , and supplement it with the effective momentum - dependent quark mass to study quantitatively the transition to the perturbative qcd asymptotics . </S>",
    "<S> the required asymptotical behaviour ( including both the @xmath1 fall - off and the correct coefficient ) settles down automatically when the quark mass is switched off ; however , the present experimental data on the form factor suggest that this can not happen at the values of the momentum transfer below @xmath2  gev@xmath3 . the effective constituent - quark mass below this scale acquires substantial non - perturbative contributions . </S>"
