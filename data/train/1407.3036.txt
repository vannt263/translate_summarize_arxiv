    "similar to coulomb blockade for electrons in mesoscopic electronic devices  @xcite , photon blockade  @xcite is a typical nonlinear quantum optical effect , where the subsequent photons are prevented from resonantly entering the cavity due to the strong nonlinear photon - photon interaction .",
    "this phenomenon can be observed by the so - called photon antibunching in photon correlation measurements .",
    "the nonlinear photon - photon interaction at single - photon level is inherently nonclassical and provides a way to control signal photon via photonic devices , which is essential to various emerging techniques , such as single - photon transistor  @xcite , photon routing  @xcite , generation of non - classical light  @xcite , quantum information processing with photonic qubits  @xcite , optical communication  @xcite , and optical quantum computer  @xcite .",
    "the photon blockade has been experimentally demonstrated in , e.g. , cavity - qed systems with the strong atom - cavity coupling  @xcite , a quantum dot strongly coupled to a photonic crystal resonator  @xcite , and circuit - qed systems  @xcite .",
    "it is generally recognized that the nonlinear photon coupling strength should be far larger than the cavity decay rate when the single - photon blockade occurs . thus engineering nonlinear photon - photon coupling is an important task for single - photon devices .",
    "recently , cavity optomechanics becomes a rapidly growing field of research , in which nonlinear couplings between the electromagnetic and mechanical degrees of freedom  @xcite lead to various interesting phenomena .",
    "the nonlinear optomechanical coupling can be applied to the detection of gravitational waves  @xcite , the observation of quantum effects in the mescoscopic and macroscopic scales  @xcite .",
    "the optomechanical system can also be used to build sensitive mass , force and displacement detectors  @xcite , and the hardware for realizing quantum information processing  @xcite .",
    "various achievements have been made both theoretically and experimentally in optomechanical systems , for instance , the cooling of the mechanical resonator to its ground state , which paves the way to study the physical effects on the boundary between classical and quantum mechanics  @xcite , the mechanical oscillations induced by the radiation pressure  @xcite , electromagnetically induced transparency  @xcite , entanglement between optical and mechanical modes  @xcite , optomechanical transducers  @xcite , normal mode splitting  @xcite , and coherent optical wavelength conversion  @xcite . especially , the nonlinear kerr effect can also be realized in optomechanical systems  @xcite , which can be used to engineer nonlinear photon - photon interaction .",
    "thus , the optomechanical systems might also be very important candidates to act as single - photon devices , e.g. , a single - photon router  @xcite .",
    "it has been theoretically shown that the single - photon phenomena and photon blockade can be realized in optomechanical systems  @xcite when the single - photon optomechanical coupling strength is much larger than the cavity decay rate . however , in current experimental technology , the optomechanical - coupling induced kerr nonlinearity is not strong enough to be used for observing such single - photon effect .",
    "several approaches have been proposed for enhancing the photon - photon interaction using coupled optomechanical systems  @xcite . however , the strong single - photon optomechanical coupling is still a necessary condition for the demonstration of photon blockade .",
    "recent studies showed  @xcite that particular nonlinear effects are hopeful to be observed in a linear cavity , which is coupled to an optomechanical system with the weak optomechanical coupling .",
    "however , photon blockade is still hard to be observed in optomechanical system .",
    "moreover , this method requires strong coupling between the linear cavity and the optomechanical cavity via spatial proximity . however , individual addressability of each cavity is still an arduous challenge in current experimental technology  @xcite .",
    "we recently study a method to induce nonlinearity into a linear cavity by coherent feedback control using a circuit qed system as a controller  @xcite .",
    "motivated by studies  @xcite and considering progress on quantum coherent feedback methods  @xcite , we propose an approach to realize an optomechanically - based single - photon device by replacing the circuit qed system in the coherent feedback approach  @xcite with a traditional optomechanical system .",
    "such a coherent - feedback strategy can liberate both the linear cavity and the optomechanical system in space and eliminate the slashing requirement on individual addressability or large coupling strength between linear cavity and optomechanical cavity .",
    "moreover , we find that photon blockade phenomenon can be observed even in the weak optomechanical coupling regime for such a design",
    ". we will also show that the damping effects of the controlled cavity and the optomechanical controller are actually crucial for achieving photon blockade in such coherent - feedback approach .",
    "this is different from other existing photon blockade systems in which the cavity loss always plays a negative role .    in our approach ,",
    "the output of the controlled cavity is unitarily processed by optomechanical controller , and then the processed output field is fed into the controlled cavity again .",
    "such a coherent - feedback strategy preserves the quantum coherence of the system and also reduces the feedback - induced time delay .",
    "in contrast to direct coherent feedback  @xcite , we use field - mediated coherent feedback  @xcite method , in which the information flow is uniquely determined by the propagation direction of the quantum field and thus it is easier to be realized in experiments .    the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "iii , we present the mathematical descriptions of our feedback control system , i.e. , a linear cavity coupled to an optomechanical system in the feedback configuration .",

    "the second - order correlation function of controlled cavity field and controller cavity field versus @xmath166 are studied when the driving field is applied to the controller cavity .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig9](a ) , we can find that there exists a minimum near the point @xmath179 corresponding to @xmath185 and a maximum near the point @xmath186 corresponding to @xmath187 .",

    "[ fig9](a ) also clearly shows that the curve of @xmath211 fits well with the curve of @xmath206 as well as which has been shown in fig .",
    "this is easily understood , because the controller cavity and the controlled cavity are coherently coupled with each other through the closed feedback loop with explicit photon flow direction , which is naturally determined by the propagation of the quantum field .",
    "thus , if photon blockade ( tunneling ) occurs in the controller cavity , then the photons from the controller cavity are output one by one ( two by two ) , and enter the controlled cavity , and vice versa .",

    "similar to the case for driving the controller cavity , a minimum near the point @xmath179 corresponding to @xmath213 and a maximum near the point @xmath186 corresponding to @xmath214 can be found .",
    "the only difference is that the minimum ( maximum ) value for driving controlled cavity is smaller ( bigger ) than that for driving controller cavity .",
    "that is , the photon blockade ( tunneling ) is better in driving controlled cavity than that for driving the controller cavity with the same parameters .",
    "we would also like to mention that single - photon blockade can be more easily observed when coherent - coupling strength @xmath215 is enhanced no matter the driving is applied to contolled cavity or controller cavity .",
    "the strong photon blockade under weak optomechanical coupling comes from the cooperation between the weak kerr nonlinearity in controller cavity induced by optomechanical interaction and the destructive interference for different paths of two - photon excitation process  @xcite . in order to better understand the interference process ,",
    "two different paths for two - photon excitations are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] .",
    "the first path is direct excitation from one photon to two photons in the driven cavity(@xmath216 ) .",
    "the second path is one photon coherently passed to the other one and finally comes back to the driven cavity(@xmath217 ) which is unidirectional and uniquely determined by the propagation direction of quantum field . @xmath204 and",
    "@xmath205 can be considered as effective coupling strength between these two cavities , which is the key to induce destructive interference .",
    "it is obviously that the cavities losses play a crucial role for achieving such destructive interference in contrast to other photon blockade systems introduced so far in which the cavities losses always play a negative role .",
    "we finally emphasize that the destructive interference due to the coherent feedback control is unidirectional determined by the propagation direction of the quantum field which is easier to be realized and controlled in contrast to that due to a cavity directly coupled to an optomechanical system  @xcite .",
    "the cavity directly coupled scheme requires both individual addressability of each cavity and large coupling strength between each other through spatial proximity which is still a huge challenge  @xcite . however , in our proposed scheme , such two cavities are spatially separated by each other and directly coupling is replaced by coherent - feedback control which liberates such two cavities in space and eliminates the slashing requirement about challenging individual addressability and large coupling strength .",
    "different from the single driving way by applying the driving field to the linear cavity in coupled - cavities scheme , our scheme can support another driving way , e.g. , driving the controller cavity , which can also present strong photon blockade effect even in the optomechanical single - photon weak - coupling regime .",
    "another significant difference is that both the controlled linear cavity and optomechanical controller cavity can emerge photon blockade simultaneously in contrast to the situation that only the linear cavity can emerge photon blockade and optomechanical system can not in coupled - cavity scheme .",
    "in summary , we have studied a system in which a linear cavity is coherently controlled by an optomechanical system through a closed feedback loop .",
    "the linear dynamics of the controlled cavity is nonlinearized by the optomechanical controller via the so - called feedback nonlinearization .",
    "the nonlinear controller using optomechanical systems and the coherent - feedback loop are the core of this strategy",
    ". such coherent - feedback strategy can both liberates the controlled cavity and the optomechanical system in space and eliminates the slashing requirement about individual addressability or large coupling strength to achieve strong photon blockade in optomechanical weak - coupling regime .",
    "moreover , we find that the coherent feedback control induced nonlinearity can be used to demonstrate some other interesting nonlinear optical phenomena .    in the semiclassical regime , we found that optical bistability phenomenon in the controller cavity induced by the optomechanical interaction can be transferred to the controlled linear cavity through coherent feedback control .",
    "in particular , we found that the threshold value of the bistability can be significantly suppressed to zero through the coherent feedback control in contrast to finite threshold value of the bistability in pure optomechanical systems  @xcite .    in the quantum regime",
    ", we study the statistical properties of photons of the controller cavity field and the controlled cavity field with two different driving strategies . we found that photon blockade both in the controller cavity and the controlled cavity is very similar under such two different driving methods when the output damping rates of the controlled cavity is comparable to those of the controller cavity .",
    "however , this similar effect can be broken when the output damping rates of the controlled cavity are much bigger than those of the controller cavity .",
    "particularly , quite opposite quantum nonlinear behaviors , e.g. , tunneling and blockade , are discussed in the region around the point @xmath186 .",
    "photon blockade can be observed when the coherent - coupling strengths @xmath204 and @xmath218 are enhanced no matter the driving is applied to controlled cavity or the controller cavity .",
    "moreover , photon blockade can still happen even in the weak optomechanical coupling regime due to the destructive quantum interference induced by coherent feedback control .",
    "it is worth noting that the cavities s losses are actually crucial for achieving photon blockade in such coherent - feedback approach in contrast to photon blockade systems introduced so far in which the cavities losses always play a negative role .",
    "we hope that our study can provide a controllable way to engineer strong quantum nonlinearity , such as the control of photon transmission through a linear cavity by using a optomechanical controller , achieving strong photon blockade under weak optomechanical coupling condition and serving as single - photon devices .",
