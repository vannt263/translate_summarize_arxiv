    "black holes for which the charge or angular momentum parameter equals the mass are called extremal black holes .",
    "they are very central in black hole thermodynamics due to their vanishing surface gravity and they represent the absolute zero state of black hole physics .",
    "it is quite generally believed that extremal black holes are disallowed by nature but a proof is missing .",
    "one possibility to obtain an extremal black hole is to produce one from the collapse of an already extremal object .",
    "previous mainly numerical studies ( @xcite , @xcite ) have concluded that when @xmath2 collapse always takes place at a critical radius @xmath9 outside the outer horizon , and as @xmath10 approaches @xmath11 this value approaches the horizon .",
    "this is similar to the non - charged case where the buchdahl inequality implies that collapse will take place when @xmath12 i.e. , @xmath13 cf .",
    "@xcite . in the charged case",
    "the critical value is expected to be smaller due to the coulomb repulsion , and this is also shown to be the case below and in particular as @xmath14 the stability radius does approach the outer horizon . for more information on the relation of this topic to extremal black holes and black hole thermodynamics",
    "we refer to @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite and the references therein .",
    "the problem of finding a similar bound as the classical buchdahl bound for charged objects have resulted in several papers ; some of these are analytical , cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , whereas others are numerical or use a mix of numerical and analytical arguments , cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite to mention some of them .",
    "we refer the reader to the sources for the details of these studies but in none of them a transparent bound has been obtained ( except in very special cases ) , on the contrary they have been quite involved and implicit .",
    "moreover , most of these studies rely on the assumptions made by buchdal , i.e. , the energy density is assumed to be non - increasing and the pressure to be isotropic .    in this work",
    "we will show that @xmath15 given that @xmath16 ( which is a physically natural assumption , cf . the discussion below ) , and that @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the radial- and tangential pressures respectively and @xmath8 is the energy density .",
    "here we have used lower case letters @xmath17 and @xmath18 to stress that the inequality holds anywhere inside the object .",
    "we refer to the equations ( [ j ] ) and ( [ mg ] ) below for the exact definitions of these quantities . to the best of our knowledge this",
    "bound has not appeared in the literature before .    in the non - charged case",
    "a general proof of the buchdahl inequality @xmath19 in the case when @xmath5 was first given in @xcite .",
    "a completely different proof was then given by stalker and karageorgis @xcite where also several other situations were considered , e.g. the isotropic case where @xmath20 the advantage of the method in @xcite ( which is related to the method by bondi @xcite which however is non - rigorous ) compared to the method in @xcite is that it is shorter and that it is more flexible in the sense that other assumptions than @xmath21 can be treated . on the other hand",
    "the result in @xcite is weaker than the result in @xcite in the sense that the latter method implies that the steady state that saturates the inequality is unique , it is an infinitely thin shell .",
    "indeed , in @xcite it is shown that given any steady state , the value of @xmath22 for this state is strictly less than the value @xmath22 of a state for which the matter has been slightly re - distributed and this monotonic property continues until an infinitely thin shell has been reached for which @xmath23 .",
    "the method in @xcite also shows sharpness but only in the sense that there are steady states with @xmath22 arbitrary close to @xmath24 leaving open the possibility that different kinds of steady states might share this feature .",
    "moreover , since the assumption @xmath21 is satisfied by solutions of the einstein - vlasov system it is natural to ask if there exist regular static solutions to the _ coupled _ system which can have @xmath22 arbitrary close to @xmath25 this question is given an affirmative answer in @xcite , where in particular it is shown that arbitrary thin shells which are regular solutions of the spherically symmetric einstein - vlasov system do exist . on the contrary ,",
    "the matter quantities and the corresponding spacetimes constructed in @xcite for showing sharpness can not be realized by regular solutions of the einstein - vlasov system .",
    "the construction in @xcite gives that a solution which nearly saturates the inequality @xmath26 satisfies @xmath27 and in addition @xmath7 and @xmath28 are discontinuous .",
    "neither of these two properties can be realized by regular solutions of the ( massive ) einstein - vlasov system .    in the present work where we study charged objects",
    "we will adapt the method in @xcite to show the inequality ( [ dan ] ) and its sharpness .",
    "this again supports the claim above that this method is very flexible .",
    "we have not been able to carry out the strategy in @xcite in this case .",
    "if we have succeeded it would have given a more complete characterization , cf .",
    "the discussion above .",
    "however , we do show in theorem 2 below that an infinitely thin shell solution ( with properties specified in the theorem ) saturates the inequality , although we can not show that no other steady states can saturate it as well .",
    "we also mention that in @xcite a numerical study of the coupled einstein - maxwell - vlasov system is carried out which supports that there are arbitrarily thin shell solutions for this system which saturate the inequality ( [ dan ] ) .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in the next section",
    "the einstein equations will be given and some basic quantities will be introduced . in section 3",
    "the main results are stated and section 4 is devoted to the proofs . in the final section",
    "we discuss our inequality in view of the bound derived in @xcite for a constant energy density profile .",
    "we follow closely the set up in @xcite but here we also allow the pressure to be anisotropic , i.e. , the radial pressure @xmath29 and the tangential pressure @xmath7 need not be equal .",
    "we assume throughout the paper that @xmath30 the energy density @xmath31 and the charge density @xmath32 are non - negative .",
    "we study spherically symmetric mass and charge distributions and we write the metric in the form @xmath33 where @xmath34,\\,\\varphi\\in [ 0,2\\pi].$ ] it is well - known that the reissner - nordstrm solution for the charged spherically symmetric case gives @xmath35 here @xmath0 is the outer radius of the sphere and @xmath10 is the total charge . this solution is a vacuum solution .",
    "the purpose of this work is to investigate the behaviour of @xmath36 and @xmath37 when the matter and charge densities are non - zero for @xmath38 before writing down the einstein equations let us introduce some quantities following @xcite .",

    "we now define the gravitational mass @xmath45 within a given area radius @xmath18 by @xmath55 in terms of the gravitational mass we thus get @xmath56 let us also write down the tolman - oppenheimer - volkov equation which follows from the einstein equations , cf .",

    "the quantities @xmath45 and @xmath61 should satisfy @xmath62 we see immediately that these relations imply that @xmath63 we will in addition assume that the following condition holds @xmath64 the condition ( [ energyrel ] ) is likely to be satisfied for most realistic matter models , cf .",

    "@xcite , and in the non - charged case it is when @xmath68 that the classical bound @xmath69 is recovered .    we are now almost ready to state our main result but first we define what we mean by a regular solution of the spherically symmetric einstein equations .",
    "we say that @xmath70 is a regular solution if the matter quantities @xmath71 and @xmath32 are bounded everywhere and @xmath72 except possibly at finitely many points , @xmath29 has compact support and the equations ( [ j ] ) , ( [ ee1 ] ) , ( [ ee2 ] ) and ( [ tov ] ) are satisfied ( where the matter quantities are @xmath72 ) and the constraints ( [ inconditions1 ] ) and ( [ inconditions22 ] ) are satisfied .    [ thm1 ] let @xmath73 be a regular solution of the einstein equations and assume that ( [ energyrel ] ) holds .",
    "then @xmath74 moreover , the inequality is sharp in the subclass of regular solutions for which @xmath75    let us immediately make a consistency check so that ( [ chineq ] ) ensures that the stability radius is strictly outside the outer horizon .",

    "the proof of theorem [ thm1 ] relies on the method in @xcite for the non - charged case . in the introduction we discussed the strength of this method but also its shortages ; the question of uniqueness of the steady state that saturates the inequality ( [ chineq ] ) is left open , and the constructed steady states that nearly saturate the inequality can not be a solutions of the coupled einstein - vlasov system ( these issues were answered in @xcite and @xcite respectively ) .",
    "furthermore , it is not completely obvious from the construction in @xcite that these solutions approach an infinitely thin shell .",
