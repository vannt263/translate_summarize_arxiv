    "consider a globally hyperbolic spacetime which is spatially compact .",
    "one can ask the question whether there exists a slicing by cauchy surfaces of constant mean curvature ( in short : cmc - slicing ) and what are its properties .",
    "since cmc - slicings have a wide variety of uses in general relativity , this question has received a lot of attention , we refer to @xcite and @xcite for recent overviews .    in the present paper",
    "we study this problem for a class of spatially compact spacetimes , which are quotient spaces of the kottler - schwarzschild - de sitter family of spacetimes @xcite under certain discrete subgroups of their isometry group .",
    "these spacetimes can be viewed as models of cosmological spacetimes containing a black hole .",
    "studies of cmc - slicings which we are aware of treat cases where the spacetime has  in the future and/or past  either an all - encompassing crushing singularity or is geodesically complete , whereas in kottler - schwarzschild - de sitter both types of asymptotic behavior coexist",
    ". furthermore , the kottler - schwarzschild - de sitter spacetimes , due to the presence of a positive cosmological constant , violate the so - called timelike convergence condition ( strong energy condition ) which most papers assume .",
    "before we state the main results of the present work , let us define and describe the family of kottler - schwarzschild - de sitter cosmologies we consider :    the kottler - schwarzschild - de sitter metric reads @xmath0 the cosmological constant @xmath1 and the constant @xmath2 are required to satisfy @xmath3 then the function @xmath4 is positive in the interval @xmath5 , and @xmath6 at the `` black hole horizon '' @xmath7 and at the `` cosmological horizon '' @xmath8 .",
    "the region @xmath9 is a static region of the spacetime with killing vector @xmath10 .",
    "( when @xmath11 , there are no horizons , the spacetime is not static but homogeneous . )",
    "it is straightforward to see that @xmath12 in the limit where @xmath13 goes to zero , the spacetime metric tends to schwarzschild and @xmath14 tends to @xmath15 . in the limit where @xmath16 goes to zero ,",
    "the metric becomes de sitter and @xmath17 tends to @xmath18 .",
    "the static region of the spacetime has an analytic extension reminiscent of the kruskal extension of the schwarzschild spacetime and the de sitter spacetime . a common way of depicting the arising spacetime uses two charts which cover the regions @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the conformal compactification of the region @xmath19 is depicted in fig .",
    "[ tile0 ] ; it contains the curvature singularity @xmath21 ; the conformal compactification of @xmath20 is shown in fig .",
    "[ tile0p ] .",
    "the overlap of the charts is @xmath22 . as is well - known , the constructed spacetime corresponding to the union of figs .",
    "[ tile0 ] and  [ tile0p ] can be smoothly ( in fact analytically ) extended in a `` periodic  in  r''-fashion .",
    "thereby one obtains an inextendible , globally hyperbolic spacetime of topology @xmath23 satisfying @xmath24 , see fig .",
    "[ tile01 ] .",
    "we call this spacetime the kottler - schwarzschild - de sitter spacetime kssds .",
    "on kssds there exists an isometric action of @xmath25 .",

    "[ tile0 ] and  [ tile0p ] are orbits under the @xmath26-factor in this action , i.e. under the static killing vector @xmath27 .",

    "note that the killing vector @xmath28 is globally defined ; it is null on the killing horizons @xmath29 and @xmath30 which emanate from the bifurcation 2-spheres at which @xmath28 vanishes .",
    "furthermore there exist discrete isometries ( `` reflections '' ) leaving fixed the hypersurfaces @xmath31 , which are given via @xmath32 .",
    "while @xmath33 is globally defined on kssds , @xmath34 blows up on the killing horizons . in the static region or in the black hole , white hole , or cosmological regions",

    "the solid lines in figs .",
    "[ tile0 ] and  [ tile0p ] represent hypersurfaces @xmath36 , which are totally geodesic as fixed point sets of the discrete isometries .",
    "there exist two kinds : spacelike and timelike @xmath36 hypersurfaces ; the latter we call @xmath36 cylinders .    by virtue of the periodicity in @xmath33 ,",
    "the @xmath37 cylinders in two adjoining copies of the region @xmath19 can be identified , which results in a smooth spacetime of topology @xmath38 , which we call the cosmological kottler - schwarzschild - de sitter spacetime kssds[0 ] .",
    "the spacetime kssds is the universal covering of kssds[0 ] .",
    "more generally , let @xmath39 and identify points of equal radius @xmath33 on a @xmath37 cylinder and a tilted @xmath40 cylinder in an adjacent copy of the region @xmath41 on the r.h .",

    "[ tile01 ] .",
    "thereby we obtain a whole family of inextendible , globally hyperbolic , cosmological spacetimes , which we call kssds[t ] .",
    "note that kssds[t ] is a smooth , in fact analytic , spacetime : consider a neighborhood of the @xmath37 cylinder in kssds . via the killing flow",
    "this neighborhood is isometric to a neighborhood of the @xmath40 cylinder , hence the hypersurfaces @xmath37 and @xmath40 agree not only in their induced first and second fundamental forms , but also in all higher derivatives of the fundamental forms .",
    "the identification of the two hypersurfaces thus results in a smooth manifold .",
    "note that , while the spacetime kssds[0 ] is time - symmetric , kssds[t ] with @xmath42 is not ; however , kssds[t ] and @xmath43 $ ] differ by time orientation only .",
    "the spacetimes kssds[t ] are not the only cosmological spacetimes which arise as quotient spaces from kssds .",
    "firstly , we note that it is not necessary to identify @xmath37 with a @xmath36 cylinder in an adjoining copy of the region @xmath19 ; indeed , an arbitrary number of intervening copies between the identified copies is possible .",
    "however , the arising spacetimes do not exhibit different structures as far as the properties of cmc - slicings are concerned .",
    "secondly , we may identify , in the black / white hole or in the future / past cosmological region , points mapped to each other by a discrete subgroup of the action under @xmath28 .",
    "thereby we obtain cosmological spacetimes that are completely different from the class kssds[t ] considered here .",

    "we find that the cmc - slicing in kssds[t ] can be represented by a curve in the parameter space @xmath55 , which in turn is given as the t - level set of a function @xmath61 on @xmath55 .",
    "thus there exists an interplay between a global but finite dimensional picture , where cmc - slicings are viewed in terms of their representation in @xmath55 on the one hand , and a local but essentially infinite dimensional view of slicings in spacetime on the other hand .",
