    "one of the most compelling issues of modern astrophysics is the open question concerning the nature of the dark matter which dominates the gravitational field of individual galaxies and galaxy clusters .",
    "[ see for instance @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . ] while the current consensus in the astrophysics community is to advocate the cold dark matter ( cdm ) paradigm , no _ direct _ observations of the equation of state have been carried out to confirm this widely adopted assumption .",
    "efforts to confirm this assumption include attempts to detect elementary particles that have been suggested as cold dark matter candidates .",
    "however , experiments that aim ( for instance ) to detect massive axions with earth - based detectors @xcite do not yet yield a positive result .",
    "a different approach to analysing the nature of dark matter has been suggested by @xcite who first proposed that combined measurements of rotation curves and gravitational lensing could be used to determine the equation of state of the galactic fluid . whereas their analysis made particular assumptions on the form of the rotation curve , and is restricted to a certain type of equation of state , herein we provide a general formalism that allows us to deduce the density and pressure profiles without any prior assumptions about their shape or the equation of state .",
    "analytic galaxy halo models that predict a significant amount of pressure or tension in the dark matter fluid include `` string fluid '' @xcite , or some variations of scalar field dark matter ( sfdm ) .",
    "see for instance @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "our method provides a means of observing , or at least constraining , the pressure distribution in a galactic halo .",
    "therefore it is in principle able to give evidence for or against specific proposed dark matter candidates .",
    "the key point is that in general relativity , density and pressure _ both _ contribute to generating the gravitational field _",
    "separately_. furthermore , the perception of this gravitational field depends on the velocity of probe particles .",
    "these effects become especially important when one compares rotation curve and gravitational lensing measurements , where the probe particles are fundamentally different : interstellar gas or stars at subluminal velocities for rotation curves , and photons which travel at the speed of light for lensing measurements .",
    "our formalism accounts for these crucial differences between the probe particles , and relates observations of both kinds to the the density and pressure profile of the host galaxy .",
    "although we ( mainly ) consider static spherically symmetric galaxies in a first post - newtonian approximation , the basic concept is fundamental and can be extended to more general systems with less symmetry . a suitable framework for considering most exotic weak gravity scenarios",
    "is provided by the effective refractive index tensor , as introduced by @xcite .",
    "the present approach might also help to shed some light on prevailing problems that arise when combining rotation curve and lensing observations .",
    "for example , an unresolved issue exists when measuring the hubble constant from the time delay between gravitationally lensed images : using the standard models for matter distribution in the lens galaxy , the resulting hubble constant is either too low compared to its value from other observations , or the dark matter halo must be excluded from the galaxy model to obtain the commonly accepted value of @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "a possible explanation of this trend might lie in a disregarded pressure component of the dark matter halo .",
    "we organise this article in the following manner : first we introduce the minimal necessary framework of general relativity concepts , and point out the important conditions required to obtain the newtonian gravity limit .",
    "next , we elaborate on the post - newtonian extension of the currently employed rotation curve and gravitational lensing formalisms .",
    "consequently , we show how to combine rotation curve and lensing measurements to make inferences about the density and pressure profile of the observed galaxy .",
    "we then examine how noticeable the effects of non - negligible pressure could be in the measurements .",
    "lastly , we discuss how the formalism adapts to non - spherically symmetric galaxies and comment on the current observational situation and issues arising with the new formalism .",
    "in general relativity the motion of a probe particle is given as the geodesic of a curved space - time whose curvature is generated by matter or more generally speaking , stress - energy .",
    "the static and approximately spherically symmetric gravitational field of a galaxy is represented by the space - time metric @xcite @xmath1 which is completely determined by the two metric functions @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "these coordinates @xmath4 are called _ curvature coordinates _ and @xmath5 represents the geometry of a unit sphere .",
    "invoking the einstein field equations with the most general static and spherically symmetric stress - energy tensor gives the relation between the metric functions and the density and pressure profiles : @xmath6 ;   \\\\",

    "the pressures and matter fluxes are small compared to the mass - energy density .",
    "[ it : newtonnopressure ]    while there is no doubt that in a galaxy condition [ it : newtonweak ] is satisfied everywhere apart from the central region @xcite , condition [ it : newtonslow ] only holds for rotation curves and not for gravitational lensing .",
    "finally , condition [ it : newtonnopressure ] is related to the open question about the fundamental nature of dark matter .",
    "hence , the possibility of dark matter being a high pressure fluid , or some sort of unknown field with high field tensions , can not be excluded _ a priori_.    it is a standard result that condition [ it : newtonweak ] is enough to deduce that the gravitational potential @xmath2 is generated by the @xmath16-component of the ricci tensor @xcite : @xmath17 which on invoking the einstein equations for @xmath18 becomes @xmath19 therefore , the metric function @xmath2 can be interpreted as the newtonian gravitational potential @xmath20 if and only if the pressures of the galactic fluid are negligible , i.e. if condition [ it : newtonnopressure ] holds : @xmath21 it is now quite obvious from ( [ eq : pressure_field_eq ] ) that the gravitational field is highly sensitive to the pressure if density and pressure are of the same order of magnitude .",
    "for the regime of rotation curve measurements , both conditions [ it : newtonweak ] and [ it : newtonslow ] apply . in this case , the geodesic equations of the metric ( [ eq : ss_metric ] ) reduce to @xcite @xmath22 where @xmath23 denotes the position vector of a probe particle .",
    "equation ( [ eq : rotcurve_geodesic ] ) is equivalent to the newtonian formulation of gravity , except for the general relativistic potential @xmath24 which replaces the newtonian potential @xmath20 .",
    "measurements of rotation curves are carried out by observing the doppler shift in the emission lines of the light emitting probe particles . in a general relativistic context , the observed shift in wavelength is not exclusively due to doppler effects of the moving probe particles , but also depends on the gravitational redshift which arises as the photons climb out of the gravitational potential well .",
    "it has been shown for edge - on galaxies that the total wavelength shift @xmath25 of an emission line of a probe particle at radius @xmath13 is given by @xcite @xmath26 where prime denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath13 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 is the impact parameter .",
    "@xmath29 is the wavelength shift of an approaching particle and @xmath30 that of a receding particle .",

    "this also justifies the previous assumption @xmath32 .    for galaxies of arbitrary orientation",
    "it is more tedious to obtain this result , but in a similar fashion , it can also be shown that the doppler shift in wavelength is the dominant contribution to the observed total redshift @xcite .    therefore , the usual techniques for obtaining the potential @xmath38 from rotation curve measurements can be employed if one keeps in mind that the motion of the observed particles is not governed by the newtonian gravitational potential @xmath20 , but by its general relativistic generalisation @xmath24 : @xmath39 if one assumes condition [ it : newtonnopressure ] , the density @xmath40 is related to @xmath38 by ( [ eq : newton_field_eq ] ) . in the general case",
    ", however , the interpretation of the mass which is inferred by rotation curve measurements , @xmath41 , can be obtained from ( [ eq : pressure_field_eq ] ) : @xmath42 therefore , in the general case , we call @xmath43 the _ pseudo - mass _ determined by rotation curve measurements .",
    "a fundamentally different approach of measuring the gravitational field of a galaxy is gravitational lensing . here , the observable photons are not only conveying the information about the gravitational field to us , they also act as probe particles themselves .",
    "hence , condition [ it : newtonslow ] is naturally not satisfied for gravitational lensing observations .",
    "consequently , the equations of motion for photons _ do not _ simplify to ( [ eq : rotcurve_geodesic ] ) , as is the case for rotation curves . instead ,",

    "we note that the refractive index contains two distinct ingredients , the potential part , @xmath2 , and the integral over the mass - function , @xmath59 .    at this point , we conclude that since gravitational lensing observations yield @xmath44 and rotation curve measurements yield @xmath2 , combined observations of @xmath44 and @xmath2 allow the separate deduction of @xmath2 and @xmath3 , and therefore describe the gravitational field of a galaxy in a general relativistic sense , without any prior assumptions .",

    ", we proceed to outline the current formalism .    for a point mass ,",
    "the angular displacement of the gravitationally lensed image in the lens plane can be calculated from the refractive index ( [ eq : refindex_pointmass ] ) @xcite : @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the vector that connects the lensed image and the centre of the lens in the 2-dimensional lens plane .",
    "since the extent of a lensing galaxy s mass distribution is small compared to the distance between the light emitting background object and the lens , as well as compared to the distance between the lensing galaxy and the observer , one assumes the deflecting mass distribution to be geometrically thin .",
    "therefore , the volume density @xmath40 of the lensing galaxy can be projected onto the so - called lens plane , resulting in the surface density @xmath69 which describes the mass distribution within the lens plane @xcite .",
    "the total deflection angle of a lensing mass with finite extent is then said to be given by the superposition of all small angles ( [ eq : pointmass_deflection ] ) due to the infinitesimal masses in the lens plane @xcite : @xmath70 this equation is the foundation of the gravitational lensing formalism as introduced by @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "since this formalism is based on the assumption that the total angle of deflection is caused by the superposition of point masses  without the notion of pressure at all  it automatically assumes that the underlying lensing potential is newtonian , i.e. @xmath71 .",
    "hence , the lensing potential and the naively inferred density- or mass - distribution are related by ( [ eq : newton_field_eq ] ) : @xmath72 which implies @xmath73 however , as we argued previously , the lensing potential @xmath74 is the fundamental observable , and not the density @xmath40 which was used to construct the formalism .",
    "therefore , for the general case that does not assume [ it : newtonnopressure ] , i.e. @xmath75 , we note that @xmath76 instead , the deduced mass distribution @xmath77 has to be considered as a _ pseudo - mass _ similar to that of rotation curve measurements .",

    "although we chose to present this new formalism using the example of a simple spherically symmetric galaxy , it is easy to show that the fundamental concept behind the formalism is also valid for configurations with less symmetry .",

    "this is the straightforward extension of the spherically symmetric formalism presented in this paper .",
    "the post - newtonian formalism we have outlined requires the simultaneous measurement of ( pseudo-)density profiles from rotation curve and gravitational lensing observations .    while in principle these profiles do not have to be of the same galaxy",
    ", they must be comparable in the sense that they accurately describe `` similar '' galaxies .",
    "for example , weak lensing measurements can be used to statistically infer the ( pseudo)-density profile of an `` average '' galaxy @xcite . at the same time",
    ", analysing the dynamics of satellite galaxies gives the rotation curve and thus , the corresponding pseudo - density profile , of another `` average '' galaxy @xcite .",
    "whether these two `` average '' galaxies are comparable or not depends on many factors , such as e.g. the distribution of galaxy morphologies in both samples , the statistical noise , the employed models for the ( pseudo)-density distribution , etc .",
    "these statistical issues render the fast - growing collection of weak lensing data problematic for our purposes .    on the other hand , combined simultaneous measurements of rotation curves and lensing of individual galaxies are extremely well suited for our formalism .",

    "* ) , the number of individual `` strong '' lensing systems with multiple images is rather limited ( @xmath130 ; * ? ? ?",
    "combined observations are further aggravated by the differing distance scales : most high quality rotation curves are naturally available for galaxies with a low to intermediate redshift of up to @xmath131 @xcite , while gravitational lenses are easier to detect at intermediate to high redshifts ( @xmath132 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , since the image separation scales increasingly with the redshift of the lensing galaxy @xcite .",
    "therefore , even for nearby galaxies with existing combined measurements of kinematics and lensing ( e.g. 2237 + 0305 at @xmath133 and eso 325-g004 at @xmath134 ) , the lensing data is restricted to the core region , while the rotation curve is only described by few data points in the outer region of the lens galaxy @xcite .",

    "for instance , detailed observation of the recently discovered closest known strong lensing galaxy eso 325-g004 @xcite could provide satisfactory data to allow the decomposition of density and pressure of the galactic fluid , as outlined in this article .",
