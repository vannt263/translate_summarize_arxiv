    "the standard model ( sm)-like higgs boson with mass around 126 gev @xcite reported at the lhc strongly favors extension beyond the minimal supersymmetric model ( mssm ) . a simple idea is adding a sm singlet @xmath7 to the mssm , with superpotential @xmath8 due to the yukawa coupling @xmath0 in eq.([nmssm ] ) , the higgs boson mass can be naturally uplifted to observed value for moderate value @xmath9 at the electroweak ( ew ) scale .",
    "this specific extension is referred as the next - to - minimal supersymmetric model ( nmssm ) @xcite for @xmath10 , or @xmath0-supersymmetry ( @xmath0-susy ) @xcite for @xmath11 .",
    "either the nmssm or @xmath0-susy is very attractive from the viewpoint of naturalness argument @xcite , as the stringent tension on stop masses required by the higgs mass in the mssm is dramatically reduced .",
    "the origin of upper bound on @xmath0 above can be seen from the beta function @xmath12 for @xmath0 .",
    "since @xmath12 is dominated by the top yukawa coupling @xmath13 , the sign of which is positive , it imposes an upper bound on the ew value of @xmath0 in order to be still in the perturbative region at high energy scale . given this scale near the grand unification ( gut ) scale @xmath14 gev , the critical value was found to be @xmath15 @xcite in terms of the one - loop beta function , functions in the @xmath16 scheme . ]",

    ", the observed higgs mass favors large value of @xmath0 @xcite .    the intuition for solving the tension between the observed higgs mass and perturbativity is obvious in the context of susy .",
    "the main observation is that yukawa couplings in superpotential receive only wave - function induced renormalizations due to the protection of susy , in contrast to non - supersymmetric case .",
    "scalar field theory with dimension lower than four by wilson and fisher @xcite , and in well - known nonlinear sigma model @xcite together with an attempt to obtain a version of four - dimensional supersymmetry @xcite .",
    "similar phenomenon was also addressed by authors of @xcite in four - dimensional scalar field theory with nonpolynomial potentials .",
    "] by following the fact that the beta functions of yukawa couplings are related to the anomalous dimensions of chiral fields @xcite , and the anomalous dimensions are proportional to quadratic yukawa couplings with positive coefficients , the sign of contribution to @xmath21 function due to yukawa interactions is thus always positive . a way to alleviate",
    "this is introducing hidden super - confining gauge dynamics @xcite , from which yukawa couplings are asymptotically free , and @xmath7 is a composite other than fundamental state , with large @xmath0 at low energy as a result of this asymptotical freedom . in this context",
    "the higgs doublets can be either fundamental @xcite or composite states @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we will explore @xmath0-susy that stays perturbative up to the gut scale in alternative way . in this framework",
    "we will obtain a well defined @xmath0-susy on the realm of perturbative analysis , and operators such as higgs doublets and singlet @xmath7 are all fundamental other than composite states .",
    "this is our main motivation for this study .",
    "the study of well defined @xmath0-susy was initially addressed in ref.@xcite , in which it was found that for @xmath22 smaller than @xmath23 , @xmath0 is the first yukawa coupling running into the non - perturbative region at high energy scale .",
    "it was also understood that either introducing new matter fields at the intermediate scale between the weak and gut scale or adopting smaller ew value @xmath24 can decrease the evolution rate for @xmath0 .",
    "given an initial ew value @xmath24 , one can derive the upper bound on @xmath25 or vice versa , once new matters which appear at the intermediate scale are identified explicitly .",
    "the minimal content of new fields only includes the messenger sector which communicates the susy breaking effect to the visible sector , namely the @xmath0-susy .    together with the messengers a spontaneously broken @xmath3 gauge group will be considered as the new fields .",
    "we consider a class of models different from those studied in the literature @xcite , in which sm fermions and sfermions except the higgs doublets and @xmath7 are all charged under the hidden @xmath26 .",
    "the abelian gauge coupling @xmath27 and the @xmath3-breaking scale @xmath28 enter into the parameter space as two new free parameters . in comparison with traditional nmssm or @xmath0-susy , in our model",
    "the beta function for top yukawa coupling @xmath29 receives new and negative contribution due to the hidden @xmath3 sector , the magnitude of which is determined by the hidden gauge coupling @xmath27 and scale @xmath30 .",
    "as long as @xmath27 is large enough but still valid for perturbative analysis , these new effects decrease the slope of @xmath0 as function of renormalization scale @xmath19 above scale @xmath28 , and therefore lead to larger critical value @xmath25 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , in terms of one - loop renormalization group equations ( rges ) for relevant coupling constants we estimate the critical values of @xmath24 and @xmath25 due to the hidden @xmath3 effect . in section 3",
    ", we revise the phenomenology for large @xmath0 but small @xmath6 .",
    "finally we conclude in section 4 . in appendix",
    "a , we show the details of the hidden sector and briefly review collider constraints on the model parameters .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the beta function for yukawa couplings of superpotential can be easily estimated by using the non - renormalization of superpotential .",
    "firstly , in the case without hidden @xmath26 gauge group the one - loop beta functions for yukawa couplings in @xmath0-susy are given by , defined as the ratio @xmath31 is required to be smaller than @xmath23 in light of the 126 higgs mass in the nmssm or @xmath0-susy . in @xcite",
