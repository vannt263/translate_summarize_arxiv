    "many extensions of the standard model ( sm ) treat quarks and leptons in the same basis and , consequently , allow the existence of particles , called leptoquarks , that mediate quark - lepton transitions .",

    "since leptoquarks are an undeniable signal of physics beyond the sm , there have been several direct searches for them in accelerators .",
    "so far , all searches led to a negative result , with the possible exception of some intriguing events in @xmath4 collisions at hera @xcite . analyzing the decay of the @xmath5 into a pair of on - shell leptoquarks , the lep experiments established a lower bound @xmath6 gev for scalar leptoquarks @xcite .",
    "this limit can be improved by looking for @xmath5 decays into an on - shell leptoquark and an off - shell one , resulting in @xmath7 gev @xcite .",
    "the search for scalar leptoquarks decaying exclusively into electron - jet pairs at the tevatron constrained their masses to be @xmath8 gev @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the experiments at hera @xcite placed limits on their masses and couplings , establishing that @xmath9 gev depending on the leptoquark type and couplings .    the direct search for leptoquarks with masses above a few hundred gev",
    "can be carried out only in the next generation of colliders .",
    "there have been many studies of the production of leptoquarks in the future @xmath10 @xcite , @xmath11 @xcite , @xmath1 @xcite , @xmath12 @xcite , @xmath13 @xcite , and @xmath14 @xcite colliders . in this work ,",
    "we study the capability of the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) to unravel the existence of scalar leptoquarks through the final state topology two jets plus a pair @xmath1 .",
    "this is accomplished by a careful analyses of the signal and its respective backgrounds .",
    "we performed our analyses for first generation leptoquarks that couple to pairs @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , or @xmath18 with the leptoquark interactions described by the most general effective lagrangian that is invariant under @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to notice that pair production of scalar leptoquarks in a hadronic collider is essentially model independent since the leptoquark ",
    "gluon interaction is fixed by the @xmath20 gauge invariance . on the other hand , single production is model dependent because it takes place via unknown interactions .",
    "notwithstanding , these two signals are complementary because they allow us not only to reveal their existence but also to determine their properties such as mass and yukawa couplings to quarks and leptons .",
    "the single and pair productions of leptoquarks can give rise to jets accompanied by @xmath1 pairs .",
    "in this work , we performed a careful analyses of all possible qcd and electroweak backgrounds for the jets plus a @xmath1 pair topology using the event generator pythia version 5.7 @xcite , taking into account initial and final state qcd radiation .",
    "the signal was also generated using this package .",
    "we devised a series of cuts not only to reduce the background and enhance the signal but also to separate the single and pair production mechanisms .",
    "our analyses improves the previous ones @xcite since we considered all possible backgrounds as well as the most general model for leptoquarks .",

    "the lhc reach depends on the coupling of the leptoquark to fermions . on the other hand ,",
    "the production of a leptoquark pair can be observed up to masses of 1.11.3 ( 1.51.7 ) tev depending only upon the leptoquark type .",
    "low - energy experiments lead to strong indirect bounds on the couplings and masses of leptoquarks , which can be used to define the goals of new machines to search for these particles .",
    "the main sources of indirect constraints are :    @xmath26 leptoquarks give rise to flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) processes if they couple to more than one family of quarks or leptons @xcite . in order to avoid strong bounds from fcnc",
    ", we assumed that the leptoquarks couple to a single generation of quarks and a single one of leptons .",
    "however , due to mixing effects on the quark sector , there is still some amount of fcnc left @xcite and , therefore , leptoquarks that couple to the first two generations of quarks must comply with some low - energy bounds @xcite .    @xmath26 the analyses of the decays of pseudoscalar mesons , like the pions , put stringent bounds on leptoquarks unless their coupling is chiral  that is , it is either left - handed or right - handed @xcite .",
    "@xmath26 leptoquarks that couple to the first family of quarks and leptons are strongly constrained by atomic parity violation @xcite . in this case , there is no choice of couplings that avoids the strong limits",
    ".    @xmath26 the analyses of the effects of leptoquarks on the @xmath5 physics through radiative corrections lead to limits on the masses and couplings of leptoquarks that couple to top quarks @xcite .    as a rule of a thumb ,",

    "a natural hypothesis for theories beyond the sm is that they exhibit the gauge symmetry @xmath0 above the electroweak symmetry breaking scale @xmath29 , therefore , we imposed this symmetry on the leptoquark interactions .",
    "in order to avoid strong bounds coming from the proton lifetime experiments , we required baryon ( @xmath30 ) and lepton ( @xmath31 ) number conservation , which forbids the leptoquarks to couple to diquarks .",
    "the most general effective lagrangian for leptoquarks satisfying the above requirements and electric charge and color conservation is given by @xcite @xmath32 where @xmath33 , @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) stands for the left - handed quark ( lepton ) doublet , and @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 are the singlet components of the fermions .",
    "we denote the charge conjugated fermion fields by @xmath39 and we omitted in eqs .",
    "( [ lag : fer ] ) and ( [ eff ] ) the flavor indices of the leptoquark couplings to fermions .",
    "the leptoquarks @xmath40 and @xmath41 are singlets under @xmath42 , while @xmath43 and @xmath44 are doublets , and @xmath45 is a triplet .",
    "the quantum numbers for all scalar leptoquarks can be found , for instance , in the last reference of @xcite .",
    "since leptoquarks are color triplets , it is natural to assume that they interact with gluons . to obtain their couplings to gluons we substituted @xmath46 by the covariant derivative @xmath47 in the leptoquark kinetic lagrangian .    from the above interactions we can see that the main decay modes of leptoquarks are into pairs @xmath48 and @xmath49",
    ", thus , their signal is a @xmath50 plus a jet , or a jet plus missing energy . in this work we considered only the first decay and took into account properly the corresponding branching ratio .",
    "moreover , the event generator pythia assumes that the leptoquark interaction with quarks and leptons is described by @xmath51 and the cross sections are expressed in terms of the parameter @xmath52 defined as @xmath53 with @xmath54 being the fine structure constant .",
    "we exhibit in table [ t : cor ] the leptoquarks that can be analyzed using the final state @xmath50 plus a jet , as well as , their decay products , branching ratio into @xmath48 , and the correspondent value of @xmath52 . as we can see from eqs .",

    "at the parton level , the single production of leptoquarks leads to a final state exhibiting a pair @xmath1 and @xmath34 ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "after the parton shower and hadronization the final state usually contains more than one jet , and consequently , the backgrounds for single and pair productions of leptoquarks are basically the same . in our analyses",
    "we kept track of the @xmath50 ( jet ) carrying the largest transverse momentum , that we denoted by @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) , and the @xmath50 ( jet ) with the second largest @xmath61 , that we called @xmath62 ( @xmath63 ) .",

    "our calculations were performed using the parton distribution functions of cteq2l @xcite .    within the scope of the sm ,",
    "there are many sources of backgrounds leading to jets accompanied by a pair @xmath1 .",
    "we divided them into three classes : qcd and electroweak processes and top quark production .",
    "the reactions , included in the qcd class , depend exclusively on the strong interaction and are listed in table [ t : qcd1 ] , where @xmath34 ( @xmath58 ) represents a ( anti)quark of flavor @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , or @xmath69 and @xmath70 stands for a gluon .",
    "we also show in this table the total cross section ( @xmath71 ) for each process with the only requirement that the partons produced in the hard scattering have a transverse momentum larger than 100 gev @xcite .",
    "the last column in this table contains the total cross section ( @xmath72 ) after imposing that the final state contains a pair @xmath1 with each lepton having a transverse momentum larger than 50 gev .    in this class of processes , the main source of hard",
    "@xmath50 is the semileptonic decay of hadrons possessing quarks @xmath67 or @xmath69 , which are produced in the hard scattering or in the parton shower through the splitting @xmath73 ( @xmath74 ) .",
    "since only a small fraction of the decays give rise to hard leptons , we needed to improve the efficiency of the monte carlo by decaying the same hadron several times and keeping track of the fraction of events that yield the desired signal .",
    "an important feature of the events in this class is that close to the hard @xmath50 there is a substantial amount of hadronic activity , as we can see from fig .",

    "as we can see from table [ t : pair1 ] , the gluon ",
    "gluon mechanism dominates the production of leptoquark pairs as long as the signal is observable at the lhc .",
    "moreover , for @xmath88 , the cross section for the production of leptoquark pairs is larger than the single production one for light leptoquarks ( @xmath99 gev ) due to the large gluon  gluon luminosity .",

    "[ fig : pair1 ] , where we just required the @xmath50 to have @xmath100 gev .",
    "we can see from this figure that the @xmath101 and @xmath102 processes lead to a similar spectrum that is peaked approximately at @xmath95 ( @xmath103 gev ) and also exhibits a large fraction of very hard jets and leptons .",
    "the presence of this peak indicates that the two hardest jets and leptons originate from the decay of the leptoquark pair .",
    "however , we still have to determine which are the lepton and jet coming from the decay of one of the leptoquarks .",

    "[ fig : pair2]b .",
    "there are several goals in our analyses .",
    "first , we study the lhc potentiality to discover a leptoquark , which requires establishing the cuts to enhance the signal and reduce the backgrounds .",
    "then , we separate the single and pair productions of leptoquarks in order to be able to analyze their yukawa couplings .    taking into account the features of the signal and backgrounds described in the previous sections",
    ", we imposed the following set of cuts :    * the first requirement is that the leading jets and @xmath50 are in the pseudorapidity interval @xmath106 .",
    "* the leading leptons ( @xmath59 and @xmath62 ) should have @xmath107 gev . *",
    "we reject events where the invariant mass of the pair @xmath1 ( @xmath108 ) is smaller than 190 gev .",
    "this cut reduces the backgrounds coming from @xmath5 decays into a pair @xmath104 . * in order to further reduce the @xmath109 and remaining off - shell @xmath5 backgrounds @xcite , we required that _ all _ the invariant masses @xmath110 are larger than 200 gev , since pairs @xmath111 coming from an on - shell top decay have invariant masses smaller than @xmath112 .",
    "the present experiments are able to search for leptoquarks with masses smaller than 200 gev , therefore , this cut is in agreement with the present bounds .    in principle",
    "we should also require the @xmath50 to be isolated from hadronic activity in order to reduce the qcd backgrounds .",
    "nevertheless , we verified that our results do not change when we introduced typical isolation cuts in addition to any of the above cuts .",
    "in fact , the cuts c1 and c2 eliminate all the qcd processes , except for @xmath113 , for which 0.25% of the events survive the cuts c1 and c2 ( and also c3 ) .",
    "however , this background disappears when we apply c4 .",
    "we exhibit in table  [ t : ew1 ] the fraction of electroweak events that passes the cuts c1 , c2 , and c3 .",
    "as we can see from this table , the electroweak backgrounds associated to the production of a @xmath5 or a @xmath114 pair survive the cuts c1 and c2 and they are not completely eliminated even when we apply the cut c3 . at this point ,",
    "the most important backgrounds in this class are the production of a @xmath5 in association with a quark or a gluon , which have cross sections of the order of a few fb .",
    "analogously to the qcd events , the electroweak backgrounds disappear after imposing c4 .",
    "a substantial fraction of the top backgrounds passes the cuts c1 and c2 , as we can see from table  [ t : top1 ] .",
    "the @xmath1 invariant mass cut ( c3 ) reduces these backgrounds , however , they remain rather large , being of the order of 50 fb .",
    "when the c4 cut is applied , the only events that pass all cuts stem from @xmath115 ; nevertheless , the cross section of this process is smaller than @xmath116 fb when we integrate in an invariant mass bin around a leptoquark mass ; see below .    since the cuts c1c4 effectively suppress all the backgrounds to leptoquark production at the lhc , the leptoquark searches are free of backgrounds",
    "therefore , the lhc will be able to exclude with 95% cl the regions of parameter space where the number of expected signal events is larger than 3 for a given integrated luminosity .",
    "in our analysis of leptoquark pair production we applied the cuts c1c4 and also demanded the events to exhibit two @xmath28-jet pairs with a invariant masses in the range @xmath117 with @xmath118 given in table  [ bins ] .",
    "the limits on the leptoquarks depend exclusively on its branching ratio into a charged lepton and jet ( @xmath119 ) since they are produced by strong interaction processes that are the same for all leptoquark species .",
    "we show in table   [ t : lim : pair ] the 95% cl limits on the leptoquark masses that can be obtained from their pair production at the lhc for two different integrated luminosities .",
    "as we can see , this search will be able to exclude leptoquarks with masses up to 1.5 ( 1.7 ) tev for @xmath120 ( 1 ) and an integrated luminosity of 100 fb@xmath22 , increasing considerably the present bounds .",
    "we also analyzed the search for leptoquarks through the existence of an excess of events presenting a @xmath28-jet invariant mass in the range @xmath117 after we imposed the cuts c1c4 ; see table  [ bins ] for @xmath121 .",
    "these events originate from the single production of leptoquarks , as well as their pair production , consequently having a larger cross section than the pair or single production alone , and then increasing the reach of the lhc . however , this search is model dependent since the single production involves the couplings of the leptoquark to fermions .",
    "in fact , the cross section is determined by @xmath52 , @xmath119 , and the quark that the leptoquark couples to .",
    "therefore , for fixed @xmath52 , the production cross sections for leptoquarks @xmath122 and @xmath123 [ ( @xmath124 , @xmath125 , and @xmath126 ) or ( @xmath127 , @xmath128 , @xmath129 , and @xmath130 ) ] are equal .",
    "[ kap_mlq ] contains the 95% cl excluded regions in the plane @xmath52@xmath131 from the single leptoquark search .",
    "as expected , the excluded region is independent of @xmath52 for masses up to the reach of the leptoquark pair searches ; see table   [ t : lim : pair ] . at higher masses",
    "the signal is dominated by the single production and consequently the bounds on leptoquarks that couple to @xmath66 quarks ( @xmath127 , @xmath128 , @xmath129 , and @xmath130 ) are the weakest ones for a fixed value of @xmath52 .",
    "since the leptoquarks @xmath124 , @xmath125 , and @xmath126 couple to @xmath65 quarks and have @xmath132 they are the ones that possesses the most stringent limits . in fact , for leptoquark yukawa couplings of the electromagnetic strength ( @xmath88 ) and an integrated luminosity of 100 fb@xmath22 , the lhc can exclude @xmath122 and @xmath123 leptoquarks with masses smaller than 2.6 tev ; while @xmath127 , @xmath128 , @xmath129 , and @xmath130 leptoquarks with masses smaller than 2.4 tev can be ruled out ; and @xmath124 , @xmath125 , and @xmath126 leptoquarks can be excluded up to masses of 2.9 tev .",
    "the discover of leptoquarks is without any doubt a striking signal for the existence of life beyond the standard model .",
    "the lhc will be able to discover leptoquarks with masses smaller than 1.51.7 tev irrespective of their yukawa couplings through their pair production for an integrated luminosity of 100 fb@xmath22 .",
    "furthermore , the single leptoquark search can extend the reach of the lhc , allowing the discovery of leptoquarks with masses up to 23 tev depending on their couplings to fermions .",
    "it is interesting to notice that the single leptoquark searches not only enlarge the reach of a collider like the lhc , but also allows to study the yukawa couplings of the leptoquarks in a greater detail .",
    "for instance , from the numbers of events with @xmath133-jet and @xmath134-jet we can infer whether the leptoquark couples to @xmath135 or @xmath136 . from the size of the single production cross section we can also estimate @xmath52 for leptoquarks coupling to @xmath65 and @xmath66 quarks .",
