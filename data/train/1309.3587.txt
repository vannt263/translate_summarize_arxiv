    "this article analyzes a general version of time dependent quantum mechanical systems via time ordered evolution operators .",
    "time - ordered evolution operators arise from direct integration of the time - dependent schrdinger equation .",
    "they are most often used to enable real - time propagation of ground - state solutions in response to any arbitrary external perturbations of the quantum system .",
    "important physics can be extracted from the time - domain responses .",
    "the development of efficient numerical techniques which aim at achieving both accuracy and performance in time - dependent quantum simulations has become important for a large number of applications spanning the fields of quantum chemistry , solid state physics and spectroscopy . in particular , finding a suitable numerical representation for the time - ordered evolution operator is one of the main focuses of the tddft research field @xcite .",
    "the numerical treatment of time - ordered evolution operators often gives rise to the matrix exponential , commonly treated using approximations such as split - operator techniques @xcite .",
    "the efficiency of the time - domain propagation techniques described here , however , is further enhanced by reliance on the capabilities of the new feast algorithm for solving the eigenvalue problem @xcite . by using feast ,",
    "the solution of the eigenvalue problem is reformulated into solving a set of well - defined independent linear systems along a complex energy contour .",
    "obtaining the spectral decomposition of the matrix exponential becomes then a suitable alternative to pde based techniques such as crank - nicolson schemes @xcite , and can also take advantage of parallelism .",
    "the goals of the paper are as follows .",
    "* to provide a rigorous infrastructure , both on the ground space and the ` smooth ' space , for the evolution operator used in topical applications of tddft cited in this article ( see @xcite for an early adaptation of kato s evolution operator ) ; * to complement the numerical gauss quadrature in time introduced in @xcite and to provide an exact interface with the use of feast ; the simulations and theorems of this article are tightly connected ; * to complement the detailed estimates obtained via the magnus expansion @xcite by an alternative approach based on finite element estimation ; in particular , the bramble - hilbert lemma and the sobolev representation theorem ; * to introduce the numerical evolution operators ; in an approximate sense , this leads to the approximate preservation of significant quantities . * to obtain , via entirely different methods based on the evolution operator , pertinent existence theorems in the literature @xcite ; in some cases , more information can be extracted from this approach , including local existence for very general nonlinearities . in particular , our focus on the nonlinear schrdinger equation with hartree potential is consistent with recent studies @xcite characterizing this equation as a weak limit of weakly coupled fermion systems .",
    "our global analytical methods are not applied to obtain uniqueness for nonlinear systems , since this is a well - studied topic .",
    "we summarize now the plan of the paper . in the following section",
    ", we outline the mathematical properties developed over the years for schrdinger operators , as applied to many - particle systems .",
    "the section includes a discussion of current understanding and practice .",
    "we also introduce the evolution operator and admissible hamiltonians . in the appendix",
    ", we include the basic theory of the evolution operator .",
    "this is due to kato @xcite and dorroh @xcite , and is detailed in @xcite .",
    "the appendix includes the verification that the hartree potential satisfies the required hypotheses for inclusion in the class of admissible hamiltonians ; this leads to invariance of the evolution operator on the smooth space .",
    "section three introduces discretization of the evolution operators , in terms of the traditional rectangular rule , for short time steps , and in terms of ` degree of precision ' quadrature rules for longer time steps .",
    "although this resonates with classical theory , the corresponding proofs of the approximation theorems of the following section are not elementary .",
    "this is followed in section four by precise statements of the principal theorems and by proofs , which validate the discretizations .",
    "in addition , a well - posedness result ( global existence in time ) is given for the nonlinear schrdinger equation , involving the hartree potential coupled to an external potential for a closed system .",
    "numerical simulations and discussions are presented in section five , and future research is outlined in section six .",
    "finally , our analysis is for the bounded domain in euclidean three space , and excludes the use of strichartz estimates .",
    "two major theories have been developed to analyze many - particle quantum systems .",
    "classical density functional theory ( dft ) is derived from the hohenberg - kohn theorem in @xcite . by transferring inter - electron effects to the exchange - correlation potential , expressed as a functional of the electron density @xmath0 , the theory is capable of representing a many - electron system in terms of non - interacting effective particles .",
    "this theory employs pseudo - wave functions but a precise representation for the electron charge density .",
    "the aggregate potential is the effective potential @xmath1 .",
    "this leads to the hamiltonian @xmath2 and its associated kohn - sham orbitals @xcite .",
    "well - posedness of the steady problem has been studied in @xcite ; applications in @xcite .",
    "although dft is only applicable for obtaining the ground state of quantum systems consistent with charge density , its time - dependent counterpart , tddft , has been proposed in @xcite to investigate the dynamics of many - body systems and can be potentially used to obtain energies of excited states .",
    "another major theory used in the theoretical chemistry community is the hartree - fock model . here",
    ", the emphasis is directed toward the calculation of exact orbitals ( for a mathematical discussion , cf .",
    "aspects of these two theories are covered in the present framework , as well as other quantum theories .",
    "we follow the notation and format of @xcite .",
    "if we denote by @xmath2 the hamiltonian operator of the system , then the state @xmath3 of the closed quantum system obeys the schrdinger equation , @xmath4 for mathematical well - posedness , an initial condition , @xmath5 and boundary conditions must be adjoined . in the study @xcite , it is shown that the initial value problem is well - defined physically ; there is an inherent invertible mapping from the time dependent external potential function to the time dependent particle density .",
    "this study is now the basis in the physics community for the reliability of physics - based studies involving time dependent density functional theory .",
    "an important study using this model is contained in @xcite .",
    "the model is now characterized as the runge - gross model ; the potential in the hamiltonian includes : an external potential , which allows for an ionic component , the hartree potential , and the exchange - correlation potential . except for the global existence result for the hartree potential ,",
    "the present article is restricted to potentials which are linear in the quantum state , but the theory has the capacity to extend to local ( in time ) nonlinear versions of the runge - gross model .",
    "we will assume that the particles are confined to a bounded region @xmath6 , with @xmath7 , and that homogeneous dirichlet boundary conditions hold for the evolving quantum state .",
    "in particular , the spectrum of the hamiltonian is discrete in this case .",
    "also , the proofs are unaffected by the interpretation of @xmath8 as a scalar or vector complex - valued function .      consider a linear problem , i.e. , an external potential @xmath9 which is independent of the system state , particularly the charge density .",
    "this assumption is equivalent to studying a non - interacting system .",
    "alternatively , in the case of an interacting system , it describes exactly one iteration of a nonlinear mapping based on potential which includes the exchange correlation potential , the hartree potential , or contributions from other quantum system models .",
    "it is natural therefore to make the following assumption :    * assumption * the hamiltonian , @xmath10 has , for each @xmath11 , an @xmath12 self - adjoint extension @xmath13 .",
    "it follows from a theorem of stone @xcite , ( * ? ? ?",
    "35 , theorem 1 ) that , for each fixed @xmath14 , @xmath15 is the infinitesimal generator of a strongly continuous group , @xmath16\\}$ ] , of unitary operators on @xmath12 .",
    "the earliest results for the self - adjointness of the hamiltonian with interactions including coulomb potentials are attributed to kato @xcite . since later results by kato and other authors @xcite",
    "imply that these operators are also stable in the sense we have defined them , it follows that the framework for evolution operators outlined here covers this case .",
    "moreover , any further perturbation of such potentials by potentials depending ( non - linearly ) on @xmath17 class functions of the quantum state , with bounded derivatives , is also admissible .",
    "this is a classical commutator result , initially investigated in @xcite .",
    "the framework here is thus quite general .",
    "however , the choice of @xmath18 of theorem [ ue ] of the appendix , is strongly dependent on the structure of the effective potential .      in this section ,",
    "all statements pertain to euclidean space @xmath19 . in order to motivate the format of the hamiltonian operators for the linear problem",
    ", we first consider the initial value problem for the _ nonlinear _ schrdinger equation , @xmath20 where @xmath21 here , @xmath22 , and the convolution , @xmath23 represents the hartree potential , where we have written @xmath24 for the charge density @xmath0 , and @xmath25 for the external potential .",
    "when spin is accounted for , @xmath0 includes an additional factor of two . in the appendix ,",
    "we are able to show that , for a choice of hartree potential defined by a charge density of minimal regularity , the hamiltonian family may be used to construct the evolution operators @xmath26 .",
    "we begin by introducing a widely used notation in the mathematical physics community ( e.g. , see @xcite ) for the evolution operators @xmath26 , which can be useful if the argument @xmath27 is not essential , and emphasis is to be placed upon the family of semigroup generators and the semigroups used in the construction of the evolution operators .",
    "formally , then , the time - ordered evolution operator for ( [ eeq ] ) takes the form @xcite : @xmath28 and the final solution at time @xmath29 is then given by : @xmath30 this is equivalent to the formula ( [ scp ] ) with @xmath31 .",
    "notice that @xmath32 is used here for the quantum mechanical interpretation of evolution operators .",
    "in addition to the final solution @xmath33 , the evolution of the system along @xmath34 $ ] can be described by intermediate solutions . from the properties of the time - ordered evolution operator ( property * ii * of theorem [ ue ] of the appendix ) , one can indeed apply the following decomposition : @xmath35 where we consider @xmath36 intermediate times with @xmath37 and @xmath38 , and where the solution @xmath3 can be obtained at time @xmath39 , @xmath40 .",
    "let us assume a constant time step @xmath41 ; the corresponding time - ordered evolution operator is designated @xmath42    let us then outline two possibilities : ( i ) @xmath41 is very small in comparison to the variation of the potential @xmath43 ; and ( ii ) @xmath41 is much larger .",
    "if @xmath41 is chosen very small such that @xmath44 can be considered constant within the time interval @xmath45 $ ] , it follows that the argument of the exponential in ( [ prop1 ] ) needs to be evaluated only at time @xmath11 : @xmath46 which is then equivalent to solving a time independent problem along @xmath41 .",
    "note that this is equivalent to definition [ recrule ] , formulated in section [ a ] .",
    "additionally , we note that the time - ordered exponential can be replaced by the exponential ( semigroup ) operator in this case , which is the essence of the rectangular integration rule .",
    "schematically , we write for the semigroup product : @xmath47 in section [ a ] , we show how the rectangular rule globally defines a family of approximate evolution operators , shown ( rigorously ) to converge to the time - ordered family . in this case , the approximation operators must be defined so that they also possess the time - ordered property .",
    "we have then the following on @xmath34 $ ] : @xmath48 the approximation order is shown to be @xmath49 in theorem [ theorema ] .      in simulations ,",
    "the use of very small time - step intervals has a sound physical interpretation as it corresponds to a step by step propagation of the solution over time .",
    "the major drawback of this approach , however , is that it involves a very large number of time steps from initial to final simulation times .",
    "in contrast , much larger time intervals could become advantageous in simulations since the electron density ( or other integrated physical quantities ) is likely to exhibit much weaker variations as compared to the variations of the individual wave functions .",
    "in addition , at certain frequency , e.g. thz , long - time domain response is needed , and accurate calculations using large time steps could be used to speed - up the simulation times .",
    "let us now consider the case of a much longer time interval of length @xmath41 , which may correspond , for instance , to a given period of a time - dependent perturbation potential @xmath50 .",
    "a direct numerical integration of the integral component in the time - ordered evolution operator ( [ prop1 ] ) , leads to @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are integration weights , and @xmath54 is the number of quadrature points .",
    "the subscript @xmath55 suggests the local construction of the evolution operators within the larger subinterval .",
    "in the case of a rectangular quadrature rule , one notes that @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 . here , @xmath60 .",
    "therefore , it follows from ( [ lim1 ] ) : @xmath61 in particular , if the number of rectangle quadrature points @xmath54 increases significantly , the problem is then equivalent to solving ( [ bf1 ] ) multiple times since @xmath62    clearly , higher - order quadrature schemes such as gaussian quadrature can use far fewer points @xmath54 than a low - order quadrature rule such as the rectangular rule , to yield a high order approximation of the integral of a function .",
    "a @xmath54-point gaussian quadrature rule is a numerical integration constructed to yield an exact result for polynomials of degree @xmath63 by a suitable choice of the points @xmath64 and gauss - legendre weights @xmath52 ( * ? ? ?",
    "we associate the quadrature points @xmath39 at the gauss node @xmath65 using @xmath66 ; also we note @xmath67 .",
    "thus , the following is a reasonable conjecture :    @xmath68 here , @xmath55 represents an average spacing between quadrature nodes : @xmath69 . in section [ b ] , we show that this estimate is rigorously correct for the weighted sum of the hamiltonians ( cf .",
    "theorem [ theoremb ] ) .      in order to evaluate the time - ordered evolution operator ,",
    "it is necessary to decompose the exponential in ( [ oper111 ] ) into a product of exponential operators taken at different time steps : @xmath70,\\ ] ] which expresses an anti - commutation error @xmath71 $ ] between hamiltonian operators evaluated at different times @xmath39 .",
    "the validity of this approximation is discussed in section [ c ] .",
    "we note from equations ( [ oper111 ] ) and ( [ oper1111 ] ) that two numerical errors are respectively involved : ( i ) a quadrature error resulting from the discretization of the integral and ( ii ) an anti - commutation error resulting from the decomposition of the exponential operators .",
    "this section is devoted to theorems [ theorema ] , [ theoremb ] , and [ global.existence ] .",
    "we present a general result , not restricted to the quantum application .",

    "the estimate is now immediate from the uniform convergence of the generator sequence . @xmath95",
    "although high - precision quadrature is much used ( see @xcite for a crank - nicolson evolution operator approximation ) , its analysis via approximation theory , including the bramble - hilbert lemma and the sobolev representation theorem , appears minimal .",
    "the much older classical theory is described in @xcite .",
    "to fix the ideas , we consider the method locally , as used on a subinterval originally defined via the rectangular rule .",
    "the analysis is not restricted to gaussian quadrature .",
    "[ bdef ] the structure of the hamiltonian here is assumed of the form written in equation ( [ eq_pot ] ) , and @xmath96 has the meaning of a potential .",

    "@xmath102 $ ] , define , for @xmath76 , @xmath103    we require the constants @xmath97 of the rule to reproduce the spatial part of the operator .",
    "there are two parts of the error as seen from approximation theory .",
    "there is that determined from the approximate evolution operators , as induced by the quadrature .",
    "this is estimated in the following theorem .",
    "however , there is also the initial error : that inherited by the quality of the approximation of the solution at the beginning of the local time interval .",
    "this is not an input directly controlled .",
    "[ theoremb ] suppose that @xmath104 is invariant on the smooth sobolev space : @xmath105 , and @xmath96 is smooth : @xmath106 .",

    "we emphasize that the sum defining @xmath117 is to be taken as _ time ordered_. we have used the reproduction of the spatial part of the operator by the quadrature scheme in writing this reduction .",
    "thus , we have from ( [ identity ] ) , with @xmath119 : @xmath120 @xmath121{\\hat u}_{p}(s , t_{0})g \\ ; ds . \\label{rep}\\ ] ] we add and subtract the following quadrature estimator function within the integrand of ( [ rep ] ) : @xmath122 this gives two terms , equivalent to quadrature estimation for two distinct functions : @xmath120 @xmath123 \\ ; ds\\ ] ] @xmath124 \\ ; ds . \\label{twoterms}\\ ] ] it remains to estimate the linear functionals summed above in ( [ twoterms ] ) , and defined by the difference of integration and quadrature evaluation in each case .",
    "although the hypotheses of the bramble - hilbert lemma ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 2 ) are directly satisfied , the conclusion is not sufficient : this implies an order @xmath125 approximation multiplied by a time integrated expression , involving the @xmath112-th derivative of @xmath96 . to obtain a more precise error estimate , also involving the factorial , and required here ,",
    "we ( additionally ) apply the sobolev representation theorem ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "4.1.1 ) ) .",
    "this provides the full , triple product estimate , which includes the ( taylor ) factorial . since this estimate is maintained with respect to integration over @xmath113 , the proof is concluded .",
    "@xmath95 .      in practice ,",
    "equation ( [ oper1111 ] ) offers an attractive numerical alternative to the original magnus expansion @xcite when applied to large systems .",
    "the product of exponentials does not require the manipulation of commutators , and it can also be addressed very efficiently using our feast spectral approach ( more details will follow in the simulation section ) .",
    "note that the iteration of the semigroup exponentials in equation ( [ oper1111 ] ) represents a slight weighted version extension of the rectangular rule to unequally spaced nodes .",
    "one can adapt the proof of theorem [ theorema ] to this case to obtain a convergence order of @xmath126 .",
    "however , it does not seem possible to improve this estimate to @xmath127 as is possible in the case of the rectangular rule .",
    "note that ( [ identity ] ) involves the difference between the generator and the approximate generator ; in the case of the rectangular rule , this approximation converges uniformly in norm over the @xmath11-interval .",
    "this does not appear to be the case for the exponential product , where one can not assert the local convergence of the generator approximation .",
    "however , the program carried out in @xcite , explicitly up to order eight , proposes an interesting improvement : the definition of a ` nearby ' discrete problem , so that the so - called commutator - free product exponential rule discussed here can be applied via adjusted weights to improve convergence .",
    "it appears to be an open problem as to the actual computational complexity associated with such improved estimates .",
    "we note that , in the simulations of the following sections ( see figure 1 ) , one uses very high - order gauss - legendre rules . remarkably , one sees a very close relation between the predictions of theorem [ theoremb ] and the actual numerical convergence .",
    "we show in this section that a solution for the initial - value problem for the nonlinear schrdinger equation exists for the admissible hamiltonians we have introduced in section [ admissible ] .",
    "in addition to the regularity assumed for @xmath128 previously , we also require here the existence and boundedness of its time derivative . the exchange - correlation potential is not included in this formulation .",
