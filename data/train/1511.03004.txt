    "the electronic structure of the carbon nanoparticles is of great interest in the todays physical research .",
    "these nanostructures have a large potential use as electronic nanodevices in the computer science .",
    "the main structure of this kind is the plain graphene , but other kinds of the nanostructures like fullerene , nanotubes etc .",
    "were already largely investigated .",
    "the main characteristics of the electronic properties is the local density of states ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "it can be calculated using the different methods ; here we use the continuum gauge field - theory approach @xcite which leads to the solution of a 2-component dirac - like equation .",
    "the result we get is the sum of the squares of the components of the normalized solution .",
    "this method was used in @xcite for the calculation of the electronic structure in the close surrounding of different kinds of the defects and of fullerene , nanocone , nanotubes and wormhole .",
    "one phenomenon has not been yet considered enough in the graphene nanostructures : the effect of the spin - orbit coupling ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "the reason is that this effect is very weak in the case of the plain graphene , but it can grow considerably in other kinds of the carbon nanostructures because of the curvature and the orbital overlap of the next - nearest neighbouring atomic sites . furthermore , the influence of the impurities could play a crucial rule .",
    "then , we distinguish the intrinsic and the extrinsic ( rashba ) term of the @xmath1 .",
    "a lot of theoretical work concerning this effect was performed in @xcite .",
    "there are more ways how to incorporate these terms into the hamiltonian for the ground state of the given nanostructure . for the case of the graphitic nanocone @xcite ,",
    "different methods are described in @xcite and @xcite : in these papers , the terms corresponding to the @xmath1 are added into different blocks of the corresponding matrix and , consequently , it is mixed with different terms of the remaining part of the hamiltonian . here",
    ", we will be more interested in the method used in @xcite , where the used formalism is an analog of the procedure used for the case of the nanotubes @xcite .    in @xcite ,",
    "the boundary effects were not considered .",
    "their significance is ( among others ) connected with the needs of the quadratic integrability of the resulting wave function .",
    "they come from the rapid change of the geometry close to the conical tip and from the finite size of the conical nanostructure .",
    "the change of the geometry could give rise to the mass of the fermion @xcite , but it could be also simulated by an addition of a fictious charge into the conical tip @xcite .",
    "next , the influence of the pseudopotential is also significant @xcite .",
    "finding of the analytical solution of the resulting hamiltonians is a very difficult task . in most of our calculations ,",
    "we use the numerical methods . to achieve a higher precision , the green function approach",
    "is also used .    in this paper",
    ", we review the results of the calculations concerning the influence of the @xmath1 on the electronic structure of the graphitic nanocone in @xcite , discuss the influence of the boundary effects and incorporate the green function formalism . in section",
    "ii , we remind the main results from @xcite . in section iii",
    ", we present the influence of the possible boundary effects connected with the topology of the molecular surface : the relativistic acquisition of the mass connected with the curvature and the coulomb interaction .",
    "finally , in section iv , we derive the green function perturbation scheme to the second order for the purpose of getting more precise results of the calculation of the @xmath0 .",
    "in @xcite , we derived the hamiltonian for the curvature  induced @xmath1 in the graphitic nanocone using the method of ando @xcite .",
    "we started with the case of the hamiltonian without the @xmath1 @xcite and after incorporating the appropriate @xmath1 terms , we finally got @xmath2 where all the parameters connected with @xmath1 and with the geometry of the nanocone are described in the mentioned paper . to calculate the @xmath0 , we solve the equation @xmath3 and",
    "finally get the matrix equation ( 9 ) in @xcite . there , this equation is solved in a numerical way and the resulting @xmath0 for @xmath4 is sketched in fig . 3 of that paper .",
    "the numerical method of finding the solution used in @xcite can be used for other modes . in fig .",
    "[ ldos3dspin ] , we see the @xmath0 for the same numbers of the defects , but here it corresponds to the sum of the solutions corresponding to @xmath5 .",
    "we can see that while for the case of 1 and 2 defects in the tip , the @xmath0 should grow to infinity for @xmath6 for an arbitrary value of energy , this effect is restricted only to zero energy in the case of 3 defects in the tip .     for the graphitic nanocone influenced by the @xmath1 . here",
    ", the @xmath0 corresponds to the sum of the solutions corresponding to @xmath5 .",
    "the number of the defects in the tip in the particular cases : @xmath7 ( left ) , @xmath8 ( middle ) and @xmath9 ( right).,width=604 ]    from these results follows that there could be a strong localization of the electrons in the tip .",
    "but we did not consider different boundary effects which could significantly influence this behavior .",
    "our effort is to find a quadratically integrable solution which preserves the main features of the found approach .",
    "this means that for 1 and 2 defects the rise of the @xmath0 close to @xmath6 will be suppressed or restricted to a much smaller area around @xmath6 , and the peak for @xmath6 and @xmath10 in the case of 3 defects will be preserved . in the last case of 3 defects ,",
    "the calculations show that the main contribution to the revealed peak is the mode @xmath11 and that considering the next modes the resulting character of the @xmath0 for @xmath6 will approach the behavior of the case of 1 and 2 defects ( fig .",
    "[ ldos3dspin3d ] ) .     for the graphitic nanocone with 3 defects in the tip influenced by the @xmath1 : @xmath11 ( left ) and the case corresponding to the sum with @xmath12 ( right).,width=604 ]",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ hamsoc ] ) is not the only possibility how to express the hamiltonian for the @xmath1 : we can also use the form of the hamiltonian where the spin  orbit coefficients and the differential operators occupy different blocks of the corresponding matrix and find the analytical solution .",
    "this possibility is outlined in @xcite , where the rashba term is excluded and the intrinsic terms are moved to the diagonal positions of the hamiltonian .",
    "so the resulting hamiltonian ( eq . ( 10 ) in @xcite ) has the form @xmath13 with @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "let us stress that here the intrinsic term does not depend on @xmath16 and the @xmath1 depends on the vortex angle only .",
    "the solution for this hamiltonian is given by the modified bessel function of the second kind .",
    "on the contrary , the analytical solution of ( [ hamsoc ] ) was not found ; we can only say that the found numerical solution @xcite is similar to the bessel function of the first kind .    working on the hamiltonian ( [ hamsoc ] ) investigated in @xcite ,",
    "let us investigate the boundary effects to get more precise information about the electronic structure close to @xmath6 .",
    "in the real graphitic nanocone , the tip has not a sharp form as one would expect for the cone geometry , but the geometry becomes smooth in this region ( fig .",
    "[ geom ] ) ; it means , there is such a value of @xmath17 that our predictions fail for @xmath18 .        from the possible ways how to remove this discrepancy",
    ", we outline these 2 methods : having to find a way to simulate the smooth geometry in the conical tip , we either suppose that due to a big curvature and the connected relativistic effects , the massless fermion , for which we solve equation ( [ direq ] ) , acquires a non - negligible mass @xmath19 @xcite or a charge is considered in the conical tip from which the coulomb interaction comes influencing the results .      for @xmath18 , we can write the corrected version of the matrix equation ( 9 ) from @xcite : @xmath20 for higher values of @xmath16 , where the curvature is considerably smaller , the mass is considered to be zero and the form of the matrix equation is changed into the mentioned form .",
    "we can solve this equation numerically and analytically , as well . in the case of the numerical solution ,",
    "especially the case of 3 defects would cause a shift and decoupling of the peaks in the corresponding graph .",
    "however , the main purpose of using the boundary conditions - getting the solution which is quadratically integrable - is not achieved here .    for the purpose of getting the analytical solution",
    ", we suppose in ( [ syst1 ] ) that the mass @xmath19 acquired by the fermion is considerably larger than other effects contained in the hamiltonian , i.e. @xmath21 and @xmath22 ( and the same up to the 4-th order of the powers and the differentiations ) .",
    "then , the solution can be very roughly approximated as @xmath23 @xmath24 @xmath25 @xmath26.\\ ] ] the graphs of the @xmath0 corresponding to this solution coincide with the graphs for the numerical solution with @xmath27 , so the potential peaks for an arbitrary number of the defects disappear here .",
    "+      the influence of the charge considered in the conical tip is expressed in the hamiltonian by the presence of the diagonal term @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the fine structure constant .",
    "so this term substitutes the mass term in ( [ syst1 ] ) : @xmath30 here , the coefficients @xmath31 can be considered nonzero , as well as zero , depending on whether we consider the parallel influence of both the coulomb interaction and the @xmath1 or the coulomb interaction only . the analytical solution for the second case",
    "is given in @xcite and we outline the corresponding @xmath0 in fig .",

    "the outlined solution , similarly as the solution for the case of the @xmath1 only in fig .",
    "( [ ldos3dspin ] ) , signalizes the localization of the electrons for @xmath6 , but on the contrary to that figure , for higher @xmath16 and energies close to zero , the @xmath0 decreases to zero .    for the first case",
    ", we use the analog of the numerical method used in @xcite : we express the solution in the form of an infinite series ( eqs .",
    "( a1 ) , ( a2 ) in @xcite ) and substitute it into the system ( [ syst2 ] ) . by the addition of the requirement @xmath35",
    ", we get a system of recurrence equations for the coefficients @xmath36 . from the boundary conditions",
    "follows @xmath37 and the same for the coefficients @xmath38 .",
    "then , the value of the parameter @xmath39 is determined from the requirement of the nonzero solution of the system for the coefficients @xmath40 , i. e. the determinant of the corresponding matrix should be nonzero .",
    "in this way , we get @xmath41 we have to choose one of the 4 possible values of @xmath39 ; here we chose the value with plus signs on the critical places .",
    "then , the coefficients @xmath40 create the components of the corresponding eigenvector .",

    "[ ldos3dspin ] , @xmath46 . comparing figs .",
    "[ graph - coulomb - bezs ] and [ graph - coulomb ] we see that the same problem appears in both cases : the electrons are localized in the tip for an arbitrary energy for an arbitrary number of the defects and the uniqueness of the peak for zero energy , which corresponded to the mode @xmath11 and 3 defects in the case of the @xmath1 only ( fig . [ ldos3dspin ] ) , is distorted by the divergence of the @xmath0 at all energies for @xmath6 .",

    "the effect of the coulomb interaction in the presence of the @xmath1 decreases as well for the higher number of the defects and it approaches zero for @xmath10 . if the coulomb interaction occurs without the @xmath1 , its influence , thanks to the decrease of other effects , is getting more significant , but significant changes of its magnitude are appreciable only close to zero . +",
