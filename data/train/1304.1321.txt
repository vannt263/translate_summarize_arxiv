    "recent experiments ( lopes  @xcite , codalema  @xcite ) showed that radio emission can be used as a new complementary technique for measuring cosmic - ray - induced air showers .",
    "this gave a new impulse to the field of radio emission from air showers and triggered several new experiments at the pierre auger observatory  @xcite , and lofar  @xcite .",
    "from the theoretical point of view several models have been developed to give a description of the radio emission from air showers , such as reas3  @xcite , mgmr  @xcite , and more recently zhaires  @xcite , selfas  @xcite , coreas  @xcite , and eva  @xcite .",
    "there used to be a huge discrepancy between the different macroscopic and microscopic models .",
    "the microscopic models in time domain like reas  @xcite were based on the geosynchrotron emmission of electrons and positrons gyrating in earth s magnetic field .",
    "the macroscopic models in time domain like mgmr  @xcite were based on the macroscopic geomagnetic current due to deflection of charged particles in earth s magnetic field and the net negative electron excess in the shower front . where the microscopic models in time domain used to predict uni - polar pulses , the macroscopic models predicted bi - polar pulses with a difference in magnitude up to a factor ten .",
    "this has only recently been resolved with the addition of a missing radiation component to the microscopic models  @xcite .",
    "it follows that similar results are obtained for macroscopic models like mgmr  @xcite and models using a microscopic description by adding the electric field contributions of the separate electrons like reas3  @xcite . from these results",
    "it can be concluded that the emission mechanisms are understood .",
    "the main geomangetic mechanism is due to the drift of charged particles in earth s magnetic field .",
    "this gives rise to a net macroscopic current in the direction of the lorentz force acting on the particles .",
    "the time variation of the induced vector potential gives rise to a net electromagnetic pulse .",
    "a second emission mechanism is due to the net negative charge in the shower front .",
    "the polarization of the signal as a function of the observer position with respect to the impact point of the shower can be used to disentangle the geomagnetic emission and the charge - excess emission  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the lateral distribution function ( ldf ) , given by the radio signal strength as a function of antenna distance to the shower axis , can be used to give information about the composition of the cosmic - ray spectrum at the highest energies  @xcite .    in  @xcite it was shown that even though the deviation of the index of refraction from unity , the refractivity , is small ( @xmath0 ) , this deviation gives rise to cherenkov effects at realistic observer distances .",
    "the importance of these effects were discussed in  @xcite for a simplified shower geometry , where the ldf was shown to have a distinct peak . in  @xcite",
    "we showed the first results of the eva - code based on realistic charge and current distributions in the air shower which are obtained from monte - carlo simulations .    in this article",
    "we show that due to cherenkov effects it is possible to accurately extract from the radio signal the position where the shower profile reaches its maximum .",
    "this is closely related to the mass of the initial cosmic ray .",
    "in addition cherenkov effects have a large effect on the relative magnitude of the charge - excess emission with respect to the geomagnetic emission .",
    "the calculations presented are done using the eva  @xcite simulations to which we give a short introduction .",
    "the basis of the eva model lies at the linard - wiechert potentials from classical electrodynamics  @xcite .",
    "the particle distributions in the shower front are introduced by the weight function @xmath1 .",
    "the total vector potential is given by the convolution of the point - like potential and the weight function , a^_w(t,)&=&d^2rdhw(,h)a^_pl(t,- ) , [ eq : vec - pot ] where the point - like vector potential given by , a^_pl(t,-(t))= _",
    "t = t , [ eq : vec - pl ] is based on the four - current j_pl^(t,)=j^(t)^3(-(t ) ) .",
    "the vector potential is to be evaluated at the negative retarded shower time @xmath2 .",
    "we define @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the unit vector pointing along the shower axis .",
    "the velocity is defined as @xmath5 .",
    "the four - vector @xmath6 is defined by the light - cone condition @xmath7 and @xmath8 . where @xmath9 is the optical path length between the source @xmath10 and the observer position @xmath11 . in",
    "@xcite it was already shown that the denominator in the vector potential , @xmath12 , can be linked to the derivative of the retarded time with respect to the observer time @xmath13 .",
    "furthermore , it was shown that for a realistic index of refraction the denominator could hit a zero leading to a divergence in the vector potential .",
    "this divergence is due to the well known cherenkov effect . to overcome these divergences a partial integration",
    "is done such that the derivatives acting on the denominator @xmath14 are shifted to the weight function @xmath15 . the final expression for the electric field",
    "is now given by  @xcite , e^||&=&-cd^2^^h_k_0 d + & & \\",
    "{ w a^0_pl - wa^||+w^||_pl } + e^i&=&cd^2^^h_k_0 d + & & \\ { w^ia^0_pl+w a^i_pl - w ^i_pl } , [ eq : field - tot ] where we defined the coordinates @xmath16 and @xmath17 . here",
    "@xmath18 is defined as the critical distance behind the shower front where cherenkov effects occur and the vector potential diverges .",
    "looking at  eq .",
    "( [ eq : field - tot ] ) we see that by making use of the finite extent of the particle distributions in the shower a non - singular expression is obtained .",
    "the derivatives of these distributions , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 , are finite where the vector potential , @xmath21 , has a square - root divergence which is now safely integrated .",
    "[ sec : emission ] the main emission mechanism is due to the deflection of electrons and positrons in earth s magnetic field .",
    "the induced drift gives rise to a net macroscopic current in the direction of the lorentz force .",
    "the electric field is given by the time derivative of the induced vector potential and is polarized in the direction of the lorentz force .",
    "there is an additional emission mechanism due to a net electron excess in the air shower front .",
    "this electron excess induces a scalar potential , and the electric field is given by the spatial derivatives acting on the potential .",
    "the polarization is given by the spatial derivative and hence becomes radial in the direction of the observer with respect to the shower axis  @xcite .",
    "evidence for the charge - excess component in air showers has been observed at the pierre auger observatory  @xcite and at the codalema site  @xcite .",
    "apart from an additional test of the monte carlo shower simulation , the importance of a thorough understanding of the charge - excess emission at distances where cherenkov effects play a role lies in the fact that this is the main emission mechanism in dense media where cherenkov effects are dominant .",
    "this emission is thus crucial for experiments searching for gzk neutrino s through radio emission from showers induced in ice  @xcite or moon rock  @xcite .",
    "the maximum for the geomagnetic radio emission occurs when the shower maximum is observed at the cherenkov angle .",
    "the position of the shower maximum @xmath22 , is defined by the depth at which the total electromagnetic component reaches its maximum . for charge - excess",
    "the maximum in the radio signal is seen when cherenkov emission is observed from the maximum of the electron excess profile .",
    "the electron excess profile does not necessarily peak at the same height as the total shower profile and the cherenkov peak might be observed at a different observer distance .",
    "therefore , polarization analysis gives additional information about the relative peak position of the total electromagnetic component with respect to the charge - excess profile .    for the charge - excess analysis in  @xcite",
    ", the variable @xmath23 defined as r= , [ eq : r ] is used . by definition the @xmath24 direction is given by the projection of the geomagnetic component @xmath25 on the ground plane , where @xmath26 is the unit vector pointing along the shower axis and @xmath27 is the unit vector pointing in the direction of earth s magnetic field .",
    "the @xmath28 direction is given perpendicular to @xmath24 in the ground plane .",
    "with this definition @xmath23 vanishes independent of the observer position if there would be no electric field component beside the geomagnetic emission .",
    "since the charge - excess polarization is pointing radially inward from the observer position to the shower axis , @xmath23 vanishes if the observer is positioned on the positive @xmath24 axis , becomes negative moving to the @xmath28 axis , goes to zero again on the @xmath29 axis , and becomes positive on the @xmath30 axis .    in the following , we consider the simplified geometry of a perpendicular incoming air shower with respect to earth s surface .",
    "the magnetic field is pointing to the north .",
    "the observer angle is defined from east ( @xmath31  degrees ) to north ( @xmath32  degrees ) . for",
    "the considered geometry a sinusoidal pattern should become visible if @xmath23 is plotted as a function of the observer angle @xmath33 .     as defined in  eq .",
    "( [ eq : r ] ) as a function of @xmath33 the observer angle in degrees for a set of 24 , @xmath34  ev , showers with a proton as primary shower - inducing particle .",
    "the primary inducing shower particle moves perpendicular to earth s surface .",
    "the squares give @xmath23 for an index of refraction equal to unity , the circles give @xmath23 for a realistic index of refraction following the law of gladstone and dale given in  eq .",

    "[ fig : rvspsi ] the average value of @xmath23 for a set of 24 , @xmath34  ev , showers with a proton as primary shower - inducing particle is shown .",
    "this is done for an index of refraction equal to unity as well as a more realistic index of refraction following the law of gladstone and dale , @xmath35 , given by @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the air density at an atmospheric height @xmath38 . the observer distance @xmath39  m is chosen in such a way that the shower maximum is observed at the cherenkov angle for geomagnetic emission . for an index of refraction of unity",
    "we clearly observe a sinusoidal - like pattern .",
    "since cherenkov effects do not affect the polarization of the signal we do not expect the qualitative features of this pattern to change significantly for a realistic index of refraction .",
    "this is indeed the case as can be observed from  fig .",
    "[ fig : rvspsi ] . nevertheless , even though the pattern does not change significantly , the maximum value of @xmath23 increases .",
    "this is also seen in  fig .",
    "[ fig : rvsd ] where we plot the absolute value of @xmath23 at an observer angle of 90 degrees as a function of distance from the shower axis , @xmath40 .",
    "the charge - excess emission is radially polarized and should thus vanish at the shower axis .",
    "this is not the case for the geomagnetic emission which is polarized in the direction of the lorentz force .",
    "it follows that charge - excess emission , and thus @xmath23 , scales with the opening angle with respect to the point of maximum emission . for an index of refraction equal to unity",
    "this is the opening angle with the shower maximum , which steadily increases with observer distance , and hence @xmath41 also steadily increases with observer distance . for a realistic index of refraction , however , the opening angle of maximum emission is equal to the cherenkov angle and stays constant over the range of distances where cherenkov effects are dominant .",
    "this is observed in  fig .",
    "[ fig : rvsd ] in the region below @xmath42 meters .",
    "below 50 meters , @xmath41 becomes considerably larger when cherenkov effects are included into the simulation . at slightly larger observer distances , but still in the regime where cherenkov effects are important , @xmath41 becomes smaller when cherenkov effects are applied . in this region something more subtle",
    "is going on .",
    "this can be understood from  fig .",
    "[ fig : profile ] , where the shower profile ( full line ) for the total electromagnetic component is given as well as the charge - excess profile ( dashed line ) .",
    "it follows that the charge - excess profile peaks closer to earth s surface ( @xmath43 ) than the shower profile ( @xmath44 ) . due to this effect , at @xmath42 meters cherenkov effects have diminished for the charge - excess component , but are still large for the geomagnetic emission and hence @xmath23 becomes small .",
    "if the charge - excess profile would have peaked at a larger height compared to the shower profile for the total electromagnetic component , @xmath41 as plotted in  fig .",
    "[ fig : rvsd ] would always be larger when cherenkov effects are included into the simulation compared to the calculations done for an index of refraction equal to unity .",
    "this is a large effect , which should be measurable .",
    "the value of @xmath41 in the regime where cherenkov effects apply is thus sensitive to the relative position of the charge - excess maximum with respect to the maximum for the shower profile given by the total electromagnetic component .    for distances larger than @xmath42 meters ,",
    "cherenkov effects become small and the value of @xmath23 for a realistic index of refraction converges to the value of @xmath23 for a constant index of refraction equal to unity .     as defined in  eq .",
    "( [ eq : r ] ) at an observer angle @xmath32 degrees as a function of distance from the shower axis @xmath45 for a set of 24 , @xmath34  ev , showers with a proton as primary shower - inducing particle .",

    "[ fig : profile ]",
    "due to the extremely thin verticle particle distribution close to the shower axis the electric field contains very high frequency components when the shower maximum is seen at the cherenkov angle  @xcite .",
    "away from the cherenkov angle the emitted radiation is not seen at a single instant any more and the projection of the shower profile is the determining length scale .",

    "the simulation is done for a typical @xmath34  ev proton shower .",
    "the ldf at low frequencies is naturally sensitive to emission on a rater long time scale , which is generally given by the ` normal ' varying current emission and peaks close to the shower axis . for the higher frequencies the ldf becomes more sensitive for cherenkov emission from close to the shower maximum and peaks further outward . in the @xmath46  mhz band ,",
    "cherenkov emission and normal emission compete with each other giving rise to a two peak structure .",
    "for an index of refraction equal to unity it is shown that one can distinguish between different shower - inducing primary particles  @xcite .",
