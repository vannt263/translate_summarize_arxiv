    "from the very first observations of the neptune adams ring arcs [ hubbard et al 1986 , smith et al 1989 ] plus the subsequent observations [ sicardy et al 1999 , dumas et al 1999 ] , the adams arcs seemed to change in arc locations and in brightness .",
    "more recently , these dynamic natures of the arcs , fraternite , egalite ( 2,1 ) , liberte , and courage , have been confirmed beyond any doubt in another ground observation [ de pater et al 2005 ] .",
    "measuring from the center of the main arc fraternite , they extend a total of about @xmath1 ahead of fraternite .",
    "occassionally , some arcs flare up and others fade away .",
    "furthermore , the arc configuration appears to be changing in time as well .",
    "the leading arc courage appears to have leaped over to another cer site recently [ de pater et al 2005 ] .",
    "although the twin arc egalite(2,1 ) is small , it is a very bright arc . according to de pater et al [ 2005 ]",
    ", its relative intensity to fraternite varied from 17 percent higher in 2002 to seven percent lower in 2003 totaling a 24 percent relative change over a short period of time",
    ". the angular span of the twin arc egalite appeared to be 30 percent larger in 2005 and 1999 publications than in 1989 voyager 2 results .",
    "this widening of egalite was accompanied by a corresponding narrowing of fraternite , which indicated a likely exchange of material between the two . as for liberte ,",
    "1999 data showed it was about 3@xmath2 ahead of its position in voyager 2 pictures .",
    "for the 2005 results , the 2002 data appeared to show liberte as a twin arc separated by about 4.5@xmath2 with the leading twin at the original voyager 1989 location , while in 2003 it returned again as one single arc at the voyager location .",
    "with respect to the normally low intensity arc courage , it flared in intensity to become as bright as liberte in 1998 indicating a possible exchange of material between the two arcs .",
    "most interestingly , it was observed in the 2005 data that courage has moved 8@xmath2 ahead from @xmath3 to @xmath4 [ de pater et al 2005 ] .    according to the prevailing theories , based on the restricted three - body framework ( neptune - galatea - arcs ) with a conservative disturbing potential , these arcs are radially and longitudinally confined by the corotation resonance potential of the inner moon galatea . in order to account for these arcs ,",
    "the 84/86 corotation resonance due to the inclination of galatea ( cir ) had been invoked to give a potential site of @xmath5 [ goldreich et al 1986 ] .",
    "later on the 42/43 resonance because of its eccentricity ( cer ) was considered giving a resonant site of @xmath6 on the adams ring arcs [ porco 1991 , horanyi and porco 1993 , foryta and sicardy 1996 ] .",
    "the arc particles librate about the potential maximum imposed by the corotational resonance satellite galatea .",
    "dissipated energy of the particle is replenished by the lindblad resonance .",
    "nevertheless , well established as it is , there are several difficulties .",
    "firstly , with fraternite centered at the potential maximum spaning aproximately @xmath7 on each side , it crosses two unstable potential points which ought to reduce the angular spread .",
    "secondly , the minor arcs leading ahead of fraternite are mislocated with the cir or cer potential maxima",
    ". furthermore , should the arcs were confined by the corotation potential , there ought to be arcs in other locations along the adams ring distributed randomly instead of clustered near fraternite .",
    "recently , there is a model that considers fraternite as being captured by the cer potential of galatea . with fraternite",
    "having a finite mass , the minor arcs are clustered at locations along the adams ring where the time averaged force vanishes under the corotation - lindblad resonances [ tsui 2007a , tsui 2007b ] .",
    "the finite mass of fraternite has been suggested by namouni and porco [ 2002 ] to pull on the pericenter precession of galatea to account for the mismatch between the cer pattern speed and the mean motion of the arcs .",
    "the arc locations are determined by the lindblad resonance reaction of the arc itself . because the force vanishes only on a time averaged base , as comparing to the stationary cer potential in the rotating frame",
    ", the arc material could migrate on a long time scale from one site to another leading to flaring of some arcs and fading of others .",
    "this could also generate twin arcs ( egalite , liberte ) and displace courage from @xmath3 to @xmath4 ( resonant jump ) [ de pater et al 2005 ] , as required by observations .",
    "although there are only arcs in the leading positions ahead , arcs in the trailing positions behind could be allowed in this model . according to this lindblad reaction model , only fraternite f",
    "is confined by the externally imposed cer potential of galatea x which reads    @xmath8    where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the position vectors of galatea x and fraternite mass distribution , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the respective semi - major axes , @xmath13 is the argument of perihelion of x , @xmath14 is the corotation resonance variable , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 . with @xmath17 km , @xmath18 km , and @xmath19 [ sicardy et al 1999 , dumas et al 1999 ]",
    ", the cer potential is    @xmath20    to complement this model , we consider the self - gravity of fraternite , which has a distributed mass , on the cer potential to account for its longitudinal @xmath0 arc span .",
    "we first consider a qualitative spherical self - gravity physical model to grasp the @xmath0 arc span .",
    "we begin with the gauss law of the gravitational field    @xmath21    under a qualitative physical model of arc span , we take a spherical uniform mass distribution of radius @xmath22 . solving for the potential @xmath23 inside the sphere with @xmath24 and outside the sphere with @xmath25 respectively , and matching the potential and the gravitational field across the boundary",
    ", we get _ _ _ _    @xmath26    this potential shows a normal @xmath27 decaying form for @xmath28 , but a @xmath29 form for @xmath30 .",
    "writing in terms of @xmath11 and @xmath31 , we have    @xmath32    where @xmath33 is now taken on the longitudinal direction along the arc , so that we can write @xmath34 and @xmath35 with @xmath36 as the angular span in radian . taking @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 , which are within the estimates of the arc parameters [ namouni and porco 2002 ] ,",
    "we have plotted in fig.1 the sinusoidal cer potential in thick line with a minimum around @xmath40 and the self - potential in thin line in units of @xmath41 .",
    "the superposition of the two in thick line is also shown in the same figure .",
    "the superimposed potential has a maximum at the center and a minimum around @xmath42 .",
    "although self - gravity is resulted from all the particles of the arc , each individual particle will see the self - potential as an external potential .",
    "the particles will girate in stable orbit about the central maximum of the superpositioned cer potential and self - potential .",
    "we now present an elongated ellipsoid model of self - gravity . for an ellipsoidal mass distribution with uniform density @xmath43 over a volume    @xmath44    where @xmath45 , the potential in space for the gravitational field @xmath46 had been addressed to in honorable treatises such as kellogg [ 1953 ] and landau and lifshitz [ 1975 ] . here , we follow the celebrated original work of kellogg [ 1953 ] especially on section 6 of chapter 7 .",
    "the potential in space of this homogeneous ellipsoid is given by    @xmath47   \\frac{d\\lambda}{\\sigma^{1/2}(\\lambda)}\\,\\,\\ , , \\\\",

    "consider a prolate ellipsoid with @xmath49 .",
    "this ellipsoid has a circular cross section on the yz plane and an axis of symmetry in x. the yz plane of @xmath50 is the equatorial plane . in this prolate case ,",

    "the inside potential can be obtained from the outside potential by using @xmath58 . to evaluate the potential on the axis of symmetry",
    ", we take @xmath59 . denoting @xmath60 and considering @xmath61",

    "taking again @xmath37 , with @xmath63 for galatea , and semi - major axes @xmath64 and @xmath65 , the cer potenial , the self - potential , and the superposition of the two with a minimum around @xmath42 are shown in fig.2 .",
    "with fraternite having @xmath66 of the mass of galatea , the self - potential actually exceeds the cer potential in magnitude , as shown in fig.2 .",
    "each test mass would be librating around the potential maximum , dominated by the self - gravity of the collective mass distribution .",
    "should fraternite be elongated further while maintaining the total mass , it would increase the semi - major axis @xmath67 of the ellipsoid .",

    "the elongation would feed the minor arcs . with this self - gravity model , not just the minor arcs are dynamically changing [ de pater et al 2005 ] , the main arc fraternite could be under a dynamical process as well .",
    "in order to explain the @xmath0 arc span of fraternite , we draw attention to the fact that fraternite , as an arc , has a significant mass .",
    "this mass is a distributed mass , instead of a point - like mass , such that its self - gravity should be taken into considerations to account for its angular span .",
    "we have used two models to evaluate the self - potential in the longitudinal direction .",
    "first is the tutorial spherical model , as a proof of principle study , with a uniform mass distribution over a sphere of radius @xmath22 .",
    "second is the elongated ellipsoidal model for a more realistic evaluation . using the accepted range of fraternite parameters",
    ", the ellipsoid model shows that the self - potential of the arc could be the cause of its angular span . for a longer arc",
    ", the ellipsoid gets longer and the ratio @xmath69 becomes larger .",
    "eventually , for a complete ring , the ellipsoid is infinitely long and the self - potential in the longitudinal direction becomes constant .",
