    "the study of non - hubble motions and of the peculiar velocity field of galaxies on different scales forms an observational foundation for many tasks of present - day cosmology ( see the survey of strauss and willick , 1995 ) . for detailed analysis of peculiar velocities ample samples of galaxies with measured radial velocities @xmath0 and independent distance estimates @xmath1 are required .",
    "the first homogeneous catalogue of this kind , markiii , was compiled as a result of integration and unification of data of observations of radial velocities and rotational velocities ( in the radio or optical ranges ) of galaxies from different samples , which were made by different groups of authors in 19821996 ( willick et al . , 1995 , 1997b ) .",
    "it was based on mutual coordination of the tf relations ( tully  fisher , 1977 ) , which were represented in the form `` luminosity  line width '' for the samples of spiral galaxies of clusters and of the field .",
    "the sample of spirals ( han and mould , 1992 ) was adopted as the reference one . the @xmath2 samples were later also included in markiii , and relative zero points for the arrays of e and s galaxies ( dekel et al . , 1999 ) were determined . without going into details of constructing markiii , which were described comprehensively by the authors ,",
    "let us note that standardization of the selection criterion was an important part of the work since the initial observational samples incorporated galaxies from different optical catalogues with different limits in apparent magnitude or angular diameter and having different angles of inclination to the line of sight .",
    "notice that strongly inclined , `` flat '' spirals were not originally included in markiii .",
    "the total number of individual galaxies involved in the final version of markiii amounts to 3000 ; they were divided into 1200 groups .",
    "thus , the catalogue markiii is important for it contains homogeneous data for early- and late - type galaxies , both cluster members and field galaxies and distributed practically throughout the sky .",
    "this allows a map of matter density distribution to be constructed from the distribution of peculiar velocities , and the values of cosmological parameters to be obtained .",
    "there is another approach to establishing a homogeneous sample of galaxies for studying the non - hubble motions of galaxies .",
    "it was realized when compiling the catalogue of flat edge - on galaxies , rfgc ( karachentsev et al .",
    ", 1999a ; the first version is fgc , karachentsev et al .",
    "the main idea of this approach is a special all - sky search for late edge - on spiral galaxies and selection for the catalogue of objects satisfying the conditions @xmath3 and @xmath4 , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the major and minor axes .",
    "the rfgc catalogue contains 4236 galaxies and covers the entire sky .",
    "since the selection was performed using the surveys poss - i and eso / serc , which have different photometric depth , we reduced the diameters of the southern - sky galaxies to the system poss - i , which turned out to be close to the system @xmath7 .",
    "the substantiation of selecting exactly flat galaxies and a detailed analysis of optical properties of the catalogue objects are available in the texts of fgc , rfgc and in the papers of the authors cited therein .",
    "some extensive work has so far been done on measurements of radial velocities , hi 21 cm line widths , @xmath8 , or rotational curves @xmath9 for the galaxies of the rfgc catalogue .",
    "besides , we have collected such data from literature .",
    "part of the data have been used to derive the radial velocities and direction of bulk motion of flat galaxies ( karachentsev et al .",
    ", 1995 , 1999b ) .",
    "herein we report the radial velocities , hi line widths and peculiar velocities for 1327 galaxies of the rfgc catalogue .",
    "observational data were divided into several samples .    1 .   the observations of flat galaxies from fgc performed with the 305 m telescope at arecibo ( giovanelli et al . ,",
    "the observations are confined within the zone @xmath10 accessible to the radio telescope .",
    "there was no selection by the visible angular diameter , type , axes ratio and other characteristics .",
    "we have not included in the summary the flat galaxies from the supplement to fgc , which do not satisfy the condition @xmath3 , and also the galaxies with uncertain values of @xmath8 , in accordance with the notes in the paper by giovanelli et al .",
    "our list contains 490 flat galaxies from this paper .",
    "2 .   the observations of optical rotational curves made with the 6 m telescope of sao ras ( makarov et al . , 1997a , b ; 1999 ; 2000 ) .",
    "the objects located in the zone @xmath11 , with the axes ratio @xmath12 and a large diameter @xmath13 were selected for the observations .",
    "the maximum rotational velocities were converted to @xmath8 by a relation derived through comparison of optical and radio observations of 59 galaxies common with sample `` 1 '' ( makarov et al . , 1997a ) .",
    "300 galaxies from these papers are included into our list .",
    "3 .   the data on radial velocities and hydrogen line widths in the fgc galaxies identified with the rc3 catalogue ( de vaucouleurs et al . , 1991 ) . in a few cases , where only @xmath14 are available in rc3 , they were converted to @xmath8 according to karachentsev et al . ( 1993 ) .",
    "this sample comprises flat galaxies all over the sky , a total of 167 objects .",
    "4 .   the data on hi line widths ( 64 m radio telescope , parkes ) and on optical rotational curves @xmath9 ( 2.3 m telescope of siding spring ) for the flat galaxies identified with the lists by mathewson et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , mathewson and ford ( 1996 ) .",
    "the optical data were converted to the widths @xmath8 according to mathewson and ford ( 1996 ) .",
    "the sb  sd galaxies from the catalogue eso / uppsala ( lauberts , 1982 ) with angular dimensions @xmath15 , inclinations @xmath16 , and a galactic latitude @xmath17 have been included in the lists . as mathewson et al .",
    "( 1992 ) report , the data obtained with the 64 m and 305 m telescopes are in good agreement .",
    "our sample contains 177 flat galaxies from these papers .",
    "the hi line observations of flat galaxies carried out by matthews and van driel ( 2000 ) using the radio telescopes in nancay ( @xmath18 ) and green bank ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "they have selected the flat galaxies from fgc(e ) with angular dimensions @xmath20 , of scd types and later , mainly of low surface brightness ( sb = iii and iv according to rfgc ) .",
    "we did not include in our list uncertain measurements from the data of matthews and van driel ( 2000 ) . in the case of common objects with samples `` 1 '' or `` 2 ''",
    "we excluded the data of matthews and van driel ( 2000 ) on the basis of the comparisons of @xmath0 and @xmath8 .",
    "the subsample `` 5 '' comprises 193 galaxies .",
    "thus , each galaxy enters into our sample with a single set of @xmath0 and @xmath8 estimates .",
    "we have included in the list a total of 1327 flat galaxies .",
    "the heliocentric velocities were reduced to the system cmb , @xmath21 according to kogut et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , and to the centroid of the local group , @xmath22 ( karachentsev and makarov , 1996 ) .",
    "the observed widths were corrected for the cosmological broadening and turbulence ( tully and fouqu , 1985 ) .",
    "the angular diameters were corrected for the extinction in the galaxy and intrinsic absorption ( karachentsev , 1991 ) .",
    "the mean characteristics of the galaxies are collected in table1 .",
    "the distribution of the catalogue blue diameters as a function of @xmath21 for 1327 flat galaxies is shown in fig.1 .",
    "it can be seen that the diameters of galaxies are close to the limiting catalogue value , @xmath23 , and this holds practically for all ( but for the smallest ) distances .",
    "thus the selection by angular diameters in our list is not strong , although individual samples have different depths ( table1 ) and are differently located on the lg@xmath24 diagram ( we do not present the figures here ) .",
    ".mean sample characteristics of flat galaxies [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the distribution of 1327 flat galaxies over the sky in the galactic coordinates is displayed in fig.2 .",
    "one can see that they cover the sky fairly uniformly except the milky way , with some excess in the number of galaxies north of @xmath25 .",
    "before description of determination of the distance to a rfgc galaxy independent upon the radial velocity , we will make some general remarks . for each of the galaxies included in our list",
    ", we have a homogeneous set of catalogue parameters : 1 ) measured `` blue '' and `` red '' angular diameters @xmath26 in a system close to @xmath7 ; 2 ) hubble type ty ( 5 corresponds to type sc ) ; 3 ) surface brightness index sb ( brightness decreases from i to iv ) etc .",
    "we used the tf relation in the form `` linear diameter ",
    "width '' and therefore , in distinction to the markiii compilers , did not need to coordinate apparent magnitudes observed in different photometric bands and with different apertures .    the data on radial velocities and widths were taken from different lists , and in the case of `` duplicates '' we took account of the data of only one source .",
    "each galaxy entered into our list with the equal weight .",
    "the second principal distinction of our list from markiii is that the distances to galaxies were determined not by coordination of the tf relations for individual samples , but from the generalized tf relation common to all galaxies .",
    "karachentsev et al .",
    "( 2000 ) describe in detail the procedure of determining the distances to galaxies from the generalized tully - fisher relation . the distance @xmath27 ( expressed in km / s and corresponding to the radial velocity of a galaxy in the case of purely hubble expansion )",
    "was represented as a linear combination of functions , dependent on the galaxy characteristics , with coefficients @xmath28 . using the fisher criterion the statistical significance was determined for each regressor .",
    "the regressors , which entered into the approximation @xmath29 with a confidence level of less than 99.9% , were rejected .",
    "we use in this paper the distance approximation    @xmath30    it is implied here the corrected diameters and widths ; @xmath31 , and @xmath32 . as compared to our paper of 2000 , the summand , which included",
    "the axes ratio , has been discarded in this approximation as statistically insignificant , and a new statistically significant regressor @xmath33 is added .",
    "considering the model of bulk motion of galaxies to be the most simple dipole approximation , we represented the measured radial velocity of each galaxy @xmath21 in the relic radiation rest frame as the sum of three components : r , the projection of the ordered ( bulk ) motion , @xmath34 and a random small - scale component @xmath35 . using the least - square method , we derived the @xmath28 coefficients of the generalized tully - fisher relation and the values of @xmath36 ( in km / s ) with which the sum of squares of the deviations @xmath37 is minimized .",
    "for all the galaxies of the list peculiar velocities were computed @xmath38 having excluded 56 galaxies with peculiar velocities over @xmath39 and having introduced a restriction @xmath40km / s to make the sample more homogeneous in depth ( see fig.1 ) , we derived a generalized tf relation with coefficients : @xmath41 @xmath42 @xmath43 @xmath44    this relation was again applied to the computation of peculiar velocities of all 1327 galaxies .",
    "they are presented in table2 .",
    "the content of the columns is as follows : + ( 1 ) , ( 2 )  the number of the galaxy in the rfgc and fgc catalogues , respectively ; + ( 3 )  the right ascension and declination for the epoch 2000.0 ; + ( 4 ) , ( 5 )  the corrected `` blue '' major and minor diameters , in arcmin ; + ( 6 )  the corrected line width @xmath45 in km / s ; + ( 7 )  the observed heliocentric radial velocity , in km / s ; + ( 8)  the radial velocity reduced to the centroid of the local group , in km / s ; + ( 9 )  the radial velocity in the system of @xmath46 cosmic microwave radiation , in km / s ; + ( 10 )  the distance ( in km / s ) measured from the basic regression on the assumption that the model of motion of galaxies is dipole ; + ( 11 )  the dipole component of the radial velocity , in km / s ; + ( 12 )  the peculiar velocity , in km / s ; + ( 13 )  the number of the sample from which the original data @xmath0 and @xmath8 were taken .",
    "fig.3 shows @xmath47 against @xmath1 .",
    "the relation between the predicted distance @xmath1 and the measured radial velocity @xmath21 is shown in fig.4 for 1271 flat galaxies .",
    "the scatter of points corresponds to @xmath48km / s .",
    "after the exclusion of 56 `` outliers '' the positive and negative radial velocities on the `` peculiar velocity  distance '' relationship are located symmetrically about zero and do not exhibit noticeable variation of slope with distance .",
    "the problem of refinement of distances independent of their radial velocities ( in the case of spiral galaxies this is the improvement of the tf relation ) remains the most important , any samples being used . in many papers of the past few years , necessity is shown of taking into account the contribution made by both the surface brightness and the galaxy type to tf relation .",
    "basing on detailed photometric investigation of spiral galaxies in clusters , willick ( 1999 ) would solve this problem in a more refined way .",
    "he derived not strong but statistically significant dependence between tf relation and surface brightness , and also between tf and galaxy light concentration index `` c '' . in our case the value of @xmath49 , which characterizes the variation of the disk ",
    "bulge relationship along the hubble sequence , may be a rough analog of the index `` c '' .",
    "it seems promising to examine models of bulk motion of galaxies not only in the most simple dipole approximation , but also with involvement of the quadrupole ( willick et al . , 1997a ) , as well as the quadrupole and octupole ( parnovsky et al . , 2000",
    "about 4% of the galaxies from our list have considerable ( over 3@xmath50 ) peculiar velocities .",
    "the existence of galaxies , moving at velocities @xmath51(40005000)km / s with respect to the whole bulk , appears to be fairly intriguing .",
    "we assumed that the cases of such deviations are accounted for by the errors in measuring the basic observable quantities : angular diameters , radial velocities , widths .",
    "these errors may be due to morphology peculiarities , to the existence of a close neighbour , etc .",
    "after the revision of these galaxies on the poss - i and eso prints we found no discrepancies between values of newly measured diameters and the catalogue ones .",
    "about half of the galaxies``outliers '' have condensations near the centre or along the disk ( rfgc 59 , 1396 , 1441 , 2637 , 4080 ... ) , bent ( rfgc 1033 , 1272 , 1719 , 3396 , 4054 ... ) , or strongly diffuse ( rfgc 1234 , 1719 , 3200 ... ) disks . some galaxies with high peculiar velocities",
    "are located in the region of clusters and have fairly close neighbours ( rfgc 1542 , 1568 , 1897 ... ) .",
    "new observations will possibly elucidate the matter .    in conclusion",
    "the following will be noted : the markiii catalogue and the list presented here are currently the most complete , homogeneous and covering all the sky samples for studying the field of peculiar velocities of galaxies .",
    "having a few common objects , they complement each other both in types of galaxies and in depth of the survey .    beginning with the creation of the first version of fgc",
    ", we have kept searching for new estimates from literature and making observations of radial velocities and widths of flat galaxies . in 1995 , from the data for about 800 fgc galaxies , we estimated the velocity modulus and the apex of the bulk motion of flat galaxies , using the forward tf relation and the dipole approximation : @xmath52km / s , @xmath53 , @xmath54 ( karachentsev et al . , 1995 ) .",
    "at the second stage ( karachentsev et al . , 2000 ) a generalized multiparametric tf relation has been derived from which in a dipole approximation over @xmath55 flat galaxies the values @xmath56km / s , @xmath57 , @xmath58 have been obtained and an averaged field of peculiar velocities has been constructed .",
    "our data have turned out to be in good agreement with the results obtained by dekel et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , @xmath59km / s , @xmath60 , @xmath61 .",
    "we have used the present list to investigate the bulk motion on the basis of the generalized tf regression and involvement , in addition to the dipole component , of the quadrupole and octupole components ( parnovsky et al . , 2000 ) . the bulk motion direction in this case too is close to that obtained previously .",
