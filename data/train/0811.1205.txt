    "progress can be made by searching for additional luminosity - dependent parameters , or by identifying a subsample of sne  ia with the lowest scatter of the luminosity .",
    "this depends on the degree of our understanding of sn  ia physics as well as on the good controlling of various systematic effects such as the photometry itself , the sn luminosity evolution , and the absorption by dust .",

    "( 2005 ) and anupama et  al.(2005 ) by 0.04 - 0.06 mag in some wavebands . the origin is unclear , and further studies are needed if systematic errors are to be minimized ( to @xmath40 mag ) when using sne  ia to measure cosmological distances .    to reasonably assemble the optical photometric data for sn 2005cf obtained with different telescopes and place them on the johnson - cousins @xmath41 system [ e.g. , from the sloan @xmath28 to the broad - band @xmath31 ] , we applied additional magnitude corrections ( @xmath43-corrections ; stritzinger et  al .",
    "2002 ) to the photometry .",
    "this is because the color - term corrections only account for the differences derived from normal stars , whereas the spectra of sne are quite dissimilar . properly modeling the instrumental response is essential for deriving reliable @xmath43-corrections .",

    "it is worth noting that , without applying such a systematic magnitude correction , the @xmath45 color measured at the ctio 0.9  m and palomar 1.5  m ( or lick 1.0  m ) telescopes could differ by @xmath100.1 mag in the early nebular phase when the colors are usually used as the reddening indicators .",
    "applying the @xmath43-corrections to the photometry noticeably improved the consistency of the datasets obtained with different telescopes .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig .",
    "4 , where the scatter around the best - fit curve decreases from 0.06 mag to 0.03 mag in the @xmath39 band . improvements are also achieved for the other bands , with the photometric scatter reduced to within 0.020.03 mag .",
    "such a normalization in the photometry could be potentially important when comparing the properties of sne measured with different systems .",
    "this is because a shift of a few percent in the @xmath45 color might systematically bias the extinction correction , hence producing an error of @xmath1010% ( a factor of 34 larger ) in the derived luminosity of the sn .",
    "we further applied @xmath46-corrections to our photometry using the same set of spectra as for the @xmath43-corrections .",
    "we note that the @xmath6-band @xmath46-correction could reach @xmath100.06 mag at the earliest phases , perhaps due to a rapid evolution of the spectral shape .",
    "the large @xmath46- and @xmath43-corrections required in the @xmath6 band , which were usually unavailable due to the insufficient spectral coverage , might partially account for the large scatter seen in the @xmath6-band light curve of sn 2005cf .",

    "1985 ; branch 1992 ) , the maximum luminosity produced by the radioactive @xmath14ni can be written as ( stritzinger & leibundgut 2005 ) @xmath201    where @xmath202 is the rise time of the bolometric light curve , and @xmath203 is the @xmath14ni mass ( in units of solar masses , m@xmath11 ) . with the photometric data in the @xmath37 band and our earliest unfiltered data from the database of the kait survey",
    ", we estimate the rise time to the @xmath2 maximum as @xmath204  d. inserting this value and the maximum bolometric luminosity into the above equation , we derive a nickel mass of @xmath205 m@xmath11 for sn 2005cf .",
    "this is within the reasonable range of @xmath14ni masses for a normal sn  ia .",
    "the quoted error bar includes uncertainties in the rise time and in the peak luminosity .    the lower bolometric luminosity and smaller nickel mass obtained by p07 is primarily due to the neglected host - galaxy extinction for sn 2005cf in their analysis .",
    "table 13 lists all of the important parameters for sn 2005cf and its host galaxy , as we derived in the previous sections .",
    "in this paper we present extensive optical , uv , and nir photometry as well as optical spectroscopy of sn 2005cf .",
    "in particular , the photometric observations in the optical bands were extremely well - sampled with numerous telescopes . to minimize systematic deviations from the standard system , we carefully computed the @xmath43-corrections and applied them to sn 2005cf .",
    "photometry without such corrections may potentially lead to a noticeably inconsistent measurement of the reddening , which makes precise extinction corrections difficult .",
    "the _ swift _ uvot optical photometry is found to be consistent with the ground - based observations to within @xmath10.05 mag , after applying the @xmath43-corrections .",
    "the _ swift _ uvot uv uvm2 and uvw2 photometry is relatively close to that of _ hst _ acs f220w and f250w , respectively , with a small shift of up to 0.10.2 mag .",
    "our observations show that sn 2005cf is a normal sn  ia with a typical luminosity decline rate @xmath57(true ) = @xmath206 mag .",
    "based on the @xmath207 colors and the refurbished color-@xmath57 relations , we estimated the host - galaxy reddening of @xmath158 mag , which is small but non - negligible .",
    "the nir light curves closely resemble those of normal sne  ia , with a prominent secondary maximum .",
    "one distinguishing feature is the uv luminosity in the 20002500  range which appears much fainter and peaks later than that of the neighboring bands .",
    "this is likely caused by intrinsic spectral features in the uv , an explanation favored by the evolution of the sed .    the comprehensive data , from uv to nir bands ,",
    "allow us to establish the @xmath15 bolometric light curve of sn 2005cf in the 160024,000    range .",
    "the maximum bolometric luminosity is found to be @xmath208 erg s@xmath8 , corresponding to a synthesized nickel mass of @xmath205  m@xmath11 .",
    "the bolometric luminosity is dominated by the optical emission ; the uv contribution is found to be a few percent of the optical , and the peak value ( @xmath1010% ) occurs at around maximum light .",
    "the nir flux contribution shows more complicated temporal evolution : the ratio decreases from the beginning of the explosion and reaches a minimum of @xmath105% at @xmath209  d ; it then rises up to a peak value of @xmath1020% at @xmath210  d , and finally declines in a linear fashion .",
    "in general , the optical spectra of sn 2005cf are similar to those of normal sne  ia .",
    "strong hv features are distinctly present in the ca  ii nir triplet and the ca  ii h&k lines ; these are detached from the photosphere at a velocity @xmath1019,000 - 24,000 km s@xmath8 .",
    "a hv ca  ii feature is commonly seen in other sne  ia , while the flat - bottomed shape of the si  ii @xmath96355 line is relatively rare perhaps due to the paucity of the very early spectra .",
    "the excellent temporal coverage of the spectra of sn 2005cf reveals that either the flat - bottomed feature or the triangular - shaped feature associated with si  ii @xmath96355 in some sne  ia might be due to contamination by another hv absorption component , such as the pure si  ii shell .",
    "although hv absorptions of ca  ii and si  ii are observed in many sne  ia , they diverge in strength and duration . for instance , the hv features are very strong in sn 2005cf and sn 2001el , remaining until a few days after @xmath2 maximum , whereas they are relatively weak in sn 2003du and sn 2005cg and becomes marginally detectable around @xmath2 maximum . given a common origin of the hv absorption from the aspherical ejecta ( e.g. , a torus or clumps ) , the diversity in strength of the hv features could be interpreted by",
    "a line - of - sight effect ( see also tanaka et  al .",
    "aspherical structure of the ejecta is favored by the evidence that the degree of polarization for the line features in sn 2001el is much higher than that for the continuum ( wang et  al .",
    "2003 ; kasen et  al .",
    "2003 ; see also chornock & filippenko 2008 for sn 2004s ) .",
    "it is thus interesting to examine whether the strength of the hv line features correlates , at least for a subset of sne  ia , with that of the line polarization .",
    "unfortunately , similar high - quality polarimetric measurements at early phases are sparse for sne  ia ( but see wang et  al .",
    "obviously , polarization spectra obtained from the very beginning would allow us to penetrate the layered geometrical structure of the sn ejecta as well as the immediate environment surrounding the explosion site .",
    "the well - observed , multi - wavelength data presented in this paper makes sn 2005cf a rare `` golden standard '' sample of normal type ia supernova , which could be used as a testbed either for the theoretical models of sn ia , or for the studies of the systematic errors in sn  ia cosmology .",

    "it is always tricky to transform photometric observations from one filter system to another , requiring many response parameters characterizing the instruments .",
    "according to the description in stritzinger et  al .",
    "( 2002 ) , the instrumental response @xmath243 can be simply defined as @xmath244 where @xmath245 is the filter transmission function , @xmath246 is the transparency of the earth s atmosphere , and @xmath247 is the detector quantum efficiency .",
    "the atmospheric transmission at the sites where it is not directly available was obtained by modifying the standard atmospheric model ( walker 1987 ) to be consistent with the average broadband absorption coefficients .",
    "here we did not include the mirror reflectivities , dichroic transmission , or dewar window transmissions due to the absence of this information .",
    "various instrumental responses , normalized to the peak transmission , are shown in figure 2 .    to check",
    "whether the instrumental response curves match those actually used at the telescopes , we computed the synthetic magnitudes and hence the color terms by convolving the model curves with a large sample of spectrophotometric standard stars from stritzinger et  al .",
    "the resulting synthetic color terms are generally consistent with the values listed in table 1 of the main text , but small differences are present .",
    "the differences are probably due to the mirror reflectivities , dichroic mirror transmission , or other unknown transmissivity of the optical elements . following the method proposed by stritzinger et  al .",
    "( 2002 ) , we shifted the wavelength of the model response curves in order to reproduce exactly the measured color terms .",
    "the wavelength shifts of different instrumental responses are given in table a1 .",
    "they are usually @xmath1100   , except in the @xmath37 and @xmath39 filters at the ctio 1.3  m telescope where the required shifts are 128    and 377   , respectively .",

    "<S> we present extensive photometry at ultraviolet ( uv ) , optical , and near - infrared ( nir ) wavelengths , as well as dense sampling of optical spectra , for the normal type ia supernova ( sn ia ) 2005cf . </S>",
    "<S> the optical photometry , performed at eight different telescopes , shows a @xmath0 scatter of @xmath10.03 mag after proper corrections for the instrument responses . from the well - sampled light curves </S>",
    "<S> , we find that sn 2005cf reached a @xmath2-band maximum at @xmath3 mag , with an observed luminosity decline rate @xmath4 mag . </S>",
    "<S> the correlations between the decline rate and various color indexes , recalibrated on the basis of an expanded sn  ia sample , yield a consistent estimate for the host - galaxy reddening of sn 2005cf , e.g.,@xmath5 mag . </S>",
    "<S> the uv photometry was obtained with the _ hubble space telescope _ and the _ swift _ ultraviolet / optical telescope , and the results match each other to within 0.10.2 mag . </S>",
    "<S> the uv light curves show similar evolution to the broadband @xmath6 , with an exception in the 20002500    spectral range ( corresponding to the f220w / uvm2 filters ) , where the light curve appears broader and much fainter than that on either side ( likely owing to the intrinsic spectral evolution ) . combining the uv data with the ground - based optical and nir data , we establish the generic uv - optical - nir bolometric light curve for sn 2005cf and derive the bolometric corrections in the absence of uv and/or nir data . </S>",
    "<S> the overall spectral evolution of sn 2005cf is similar to that of a normal sn  ia , but with variety in the strength and profile of the main feature lines . </S>",
    "<S> the spectra at early times displayed strong , high - velocity ( hv ) features in the ca  ii h&k doublet and nir triplet , which were distinctly detached from the photosphere ( @xmath7 km s@xmath8 ) at a velocity ranging from 19,000 to 24,000 km s@xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> one interesting feature is the flat - bottomed absorption observed near 6000    in the earliest spectrum , which rapidly evolved into a triangular shape and then became a normal si  ii @xmath96355 absorption profile at about one week before maximum brightness . </S>",
    "<S> this pre - maximum spectral evolution is perhaps due to the blending of the si  ii @xmath96355 at photospheric velocity and another hv absorption component ( e .. g . , si  ii shell at a velocity @xmath1018,000 km s@xmath8 ) in the outer ejecta , and may be common in other normal sne  ia . the possible origin of the hv absorption features is briefly discussed . </S>"
