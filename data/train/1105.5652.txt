    "each color class @xmath4 should be an _ @xmath5-packing _ , a set of vertices with property that any distinct pair @xmath19 satisfies @xmath20 .",

    "the smallest integer @xmath2 for which there exists a packing @xmath2-coloring of @xmath1 is called the _ packing chromatic number _ of @xmath1 and it is denoted @xmath0 .",
    "the very first results about packing chromatic number were obtained by slopper  @xcite .",
    "he studied an _ eccentric coloring _ but his results were directly translated to the packing chromatic number .",
