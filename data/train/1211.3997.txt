    "while we detect no variations statistically significant at 99%confidence , it is curious that the 3 most significant variations occur at locations on the inner ring .",
    "note that if a feature , such as one of the knots , does nt change in intensity but moves from one analysis pixel to another , then our @xmath37 test would detect this as a variation .",
    "we know that features in the inner ring of the nebula do move and expect to detect some variability due to this motion .",
    "however , as our 5 observations span only 14 days and @xmath20 corresponds to 11.5 light days , only relativistic motion would be detectable .",
    "other effects , such as changes in the roll angle of the read - out streak , can also lead to spurious variability . indeed",
    ", this may play a role for the analysis pixel with the most significant variation , which lies adjacent to the average read - out streak ( figure  [ f : r1 ] ) .",
    "thus far , we have described the x - ray data for each analysis pixel in units of acis count rate . neglecting for the moment pile - up effects , the photon spectral flux ( or other related radiation quantity ) is proportional to the count rate for an assumed spectral shape",
    ". consequently , any change in count rate corresponds to a proportionate change in photon spectral flux ( for an assumed spectral shape ) . using the _ chandra _   pimms for the acis - s detector and an absorption column @xmath53 , we determine ( ignoring pile - up ) this constant of proportionality for an x - ray power - law photon index @xmath54 , 1 , and 2 : at @xmath55  @xmath24 , @xmath56  0.99 , 1.26 , and 2.46 @xmath57  ph/(@xmath58 s @xmath24 ) per ct / s , respectively . correcting for pile - up",

    ", we compute 99%-confidence upper limits to @xmath74 ( table  [ t : r2 ] last row ) .",
    "note that the upper limits to @xmath74 are marginally consistent with the low - energy extrapolation of the @xmath0-ray spectrum ( @xmath75 ) of the flaring component ( buehler et al .",
    "2012 ) .",
    "in sections  [ ss : x_analysis][ss : x_variability ] , the search for variability focused on sensitivity to flux changes amongst the five pointings with a minimum cadence of 0.6  days . here , we search for variability on shorter time - scales  namely within each pointing .",
    "as described in section  [ s : xray_obs ] , the acis s3 ccd was read at most roughly 6000 times in each pointing due to telemetry saturation ( deadtime ) . in this study , rather than using the @xmath76 acis analysis pixel , we employed a circular search bin with a radius of @xmath29  acis - pixel ( @xmath77 ) on a grid with @xmath78  acis pixel spacing .",
    "note that this oversampling implies that the results of the test in adjacent pixels are not statistically independent .",
    "( we also analyzed these data using the statistically independent analysis pixels of  [ ss : x_analysis ] with similar results as below . )    using the frame number of each detected photon , we derive the empirical cumulative distribution function ( ecdf ) of the frames with a photon arriving in the analysis pixels of the ccd .",
    "this ecdf is then compared with the corresponding ecdf of the exposure given by the sequence of frames actually read .",
    "finally , we compare the two ecdfs using a kolmogorov - smirnov test , resulting in a probability estimate @xmath79 that the two ecdfs are derived from the same parent distribution .",
    "a low value of @xmath79 would indicate possible variability .",
    "the results of the test for the five pointings were very similar .",
    "the smallest value , @xmath80 , was obtained in observation @xmath81 .",
    "note that selecting this point represents a tuning bias , as the noise in neighboring points is highly correlated due to the oversampling .",
    "the probability of finding at least one pixel with @xmath82 considering that there are @xmath83 statistically independent trials is 0.015 , which we regard as a _",
    "lower _ limit due to the tuning bias .",
    "a 0.015 probability is tantalizing but not compellingly significant : hence , we do _ not _ claim detection of short - time - scale variability . the fact that the location of the point with minimum q is very close to the pulsar , a region in which pileup plays a strong role in blotting out the image , bolsters our somewhat conservative conclusion .",
    "the extreme saturation of the pulsar in the x - ray images means that we can not easily study the central 2@xmath84 in x - rays .",
    "however , this region does contain a nebular structure of particular interest : the `` inner knot '' whose peak is @xmath85 southeast of the pulsar at position angle @xmath86 east from north ( hester 2008 ) .",
    "this structure , an oval shape extending @xmath87 , is well measured in hst and ground - based near - ir images .",
    "given its relatively red spectrum ( energy spectral index @xmath88 versus @xmath89 for the pulsar ; sandberg and sollerman 2009 ) , it is one of the near - ir brightest structures in the nebula .",
    "sandberg and sollerman ( 2009 ) note that the knot varies by a factor of 2 ; we confirm typical variability of @xmath90 in archival _ hst _ images .",
    "komissarov & lyutikov ( 2011 ) have proposed that this structure represents radiation from an oblique termination shock in the pulsar wind nebula . in this picture ,",
    "the earth line - of - sight is tangent to the flow at the inner knot position , and thus the intensity experiences substantial doppler boosting for synchrotron emission in the mildly relativistic post - shock flow . indeed ,",
    "in relativistic mhd simulations they find that this bright spot is highly variable and can dominate the @xmath0-ray synchrotron emission . alternatively",
    ", the knot could be a time varying standing shock in the polar jet flow itself , a flow known to be highly variable from hst imaging ( hester 1995 , 2002 , 2008 ) .",
    "it is thus of interest to check the status of the knot during the 2011-april @xmath0-ray flare . unlike the sequence of multiwavelength observations performed after the 2010 september flare , it was impossible to trigger an allocated hst target of opportunity observation owing to solar constraints in april .",
    "happily we were able to obtain a keck near infrared camera ( nirc2 ) @xmath91 exposure ( figure  [ f : k1 ] left image ) on mjd 55667.250 , almost precisely at the peak of the @xmath0-ray flux and 2.5h before the acis image obsid 13152 ( figure  [ f : r0 ] ) .",
    "unhappily , the observations occurred during twilight and only one @xmath92-s integration without dithering was obtained . under these conditions the adaptic - optics ( ao ) loop did not close , leaving an undithered image with native 0.46@xmath84 full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) seeing .",
    "this frame was dark subtracted and an approximate background was removed using an immediately subsequent image . despite the modest image quality",
    ", the inner knot was well detected .",
    "after subtracting the pulsar with a scaled image of the comparably bright companion star @xmath93 northeast , we measured the knot flux and position .",
    "we find a magnitude @xmath94 and an offset @xmath95 from the pulsar . for comparison we measured a high - quality nirc2 @xmath91 image ( figure  [ f : k1 ] right image ) obtained 2005 nov 10 .",
    "here the knot is @xmath96 at offset @xmath97 .",
    "we also note that sandberg and sollerman ( 2009 ) measured @xmath98 on 2003 oct 18 .",
    "we conclude that the knot was in a relatively bright state during the flare ( @xmath99 brighter than in 2005 ) , but well within the normal range of flux ( and position ) variation .",
    "thus , there is no dramatic change in the inner knot in the near - ir band .",
    "we use the amplitude of the measured variation as an upper limit to any variation in the inner knot associated with the @xmath0-ray flare ( figure  [ f : sed ] ) .",
    "on 2011 april 14 , we triggered a prompt radio follow - up program with the vla .",
    "the vla observations occurred in 8 epochs starting april 15 and ending july 10 .",
    "these observations detected the pulsar at 2 epochs , but found no other point sources in the field .",
    "observations were predominantly in the range @xmath100  ghz , with additional observations at 1.4  ghz ( not reported ; see below ) and at 22  ghz ( for some later epochs ) . unless otherwise noted , all observations used two sub - bands , each with a 128-mhz bandwidth . in each run , observations of the target were bracketed with scans of a phase calibrator ( j0559 + 2353 , except where noted ) and a flux calibrator ( 3c  147 ) .",
    "the fields of view are limited to the primary beam response of the antennas , with full width at half power of 9@xmath101/@xmath102 with @xmath103/(5  ghz ) .",
    "table  [ t : vla1 ] provides a summary of the observational parameters and results .",
    "our initial observations were obtained through a _",
    "fermi _   guest - investigator cycle-3 program ( s3184 ) approved for four 1-hour runs in the l - band and c - band ( @xmath104 and @xmath105 ghz , respectively ) .",
    "the vla was in its b - array configuration during these observations , resulting in images with angular resolution @xmath1061/@xmath107 .",
    "we found that the l - band data for the crab were highly confused due to the brightness and complexity of the steep - spectrum nebular emission in the first ( april 15 ) and second ( april 19 ) epochs .",
    "consequently , we modified our strategy for subsequent observations .",
    "after the first epoch , we split the c - band observations into two widely spaced side - bands centered at 4.2 and 7.8 ghz , aiming better to constrain the spectrum of any detected source .",
    "we also began scheduling observations only at frequencies greater than 4  ghz after the second epoch . in these b - array data , our point - source limits at the lower frequency are @xmath108 larger than at the higher frequency , again due to the crab nebula s steep - spectrum radio emission .",
    "after non - detection of any significant radio point - source emission down to @xmath1061 - 7 mjy ( 3-sigma ) sensitivities in the initial three vla observations 17 days after the @xmath0-ray peak ( hays et al .  2011 ) , we purposely delayed the fourth observation until 9 days after the previous observation to probe longer time scales . only in this last observation",
    "( april 30 ) did we obtain a significant point - source detection , which was coincident with the crab pulsar position , but only in the upper side - band centered at 7.8  ghz .",
    "the detection is a factor of 5 greater than the 3-sigma limit from 9 days prior .",
    "the source was not detected at the lower frequency side - band ( 4.2  ghz ) with a limit indicating a source with a flat radio spectrum .",
    "following the point - source detection on april 30 , we became aware of vla test observations of the crab obtained on april 22 ( program tdem0007 , pi : d.  frail ) .",
    "these data were obtained with wide bandwidth ( 16 @xmath109 128 mhz wide sidebands ) , so were more sensitive than those from our observing runs .",
    "the flux densities were scaled to 3c  147 ; j0534 + 1927 was utilized for phase calibration .",
    "the flat - spectrum radio source coincident with the crab pulsar detected in our apr-30 observation was confirmed in the apr-22 data in two bands , but with a much lower ( @xmath110 ) flux .",
    "also , the source spectrum was rather steep , with an energy spectral index @xmath111 ( @xmath112 ) between 5  ghz and 8.6  ghz .",
    "following the radio detections of the pulsar , we requested further vla monitoring of the crab through director s discretionary time ( program 11a-268 = ac1052 ) .",
    "in addition to the c - band observations , we obtained exposures in the k  band ( centered at 22.396 and 22.254 ghz ) aiming to constrain further the spectrum of any detected radio source . through this program ,",
    "we obtained 2-hour runs on may 12/13 ( while the vla was in its hybrid bna array ) and on july 10/11 ( in a array ) , and an additional 1-hour run on may 28 , using one of the early ( april 19 , from program s3184 ) frequency setups .",
    "an angular resolution of @xmath7(0.3/@xmath102 ) is typically achieved in a - array vla observations . with the higher resolution",
    ", we obtained systematically 4@xmath109 lower flux limits than in the lower resolution b - array data , presumably due to lesser contribution from the extended nebular emission . in none of these",
    "later epoch follow - up observations , did we detect a point source , to typical limits of @xmath113 mjy at each of the three frequencies ( see table  [ t : vla1 ] ) .",
    "previously , it was argued that the @xmath0-ray flaring possibly originates in a knot 5.7  east of the pulsar ( tavani et al .",
    "indeed , this knot is the site of the most significant x - ray variability we observe (   [ ss : x_variability ] ) during the 2011-april flaring episode .",
    "variable radio emission was detected around the time of the previous crab @xmath0-ray flaring episode ( lobanov , horns , & muxlow 2011 ) with fainter flux densities than achieved in our vla observations .",
    "however , we found no significant radio point - source counterpart to this knot in any of our 8 epoch vla observations following the 2011-april @xmath0-ray flare .",
    "rather , we detected a variable continuum radio source with the vla , coincident within @xmath114 of the crab pulsar position in 2 of 8 epochs .",
    "however , the flux level and cadence of the radio detections is consistent with previous observations by moffett & hankins ( 1996 ) , who detected the pulsar @xmath115 of the times they observed .",
    "moreover , the dates of the radio point - source detections coincident with the pulsar do not coincide with any feature in the @xmath0-ray lightcurve ( figure  [ f : r0 ] ) , having occurred 8 - 16 days after the brightest @xmath0-ray peak .",
    "consequently , our vla follow - up observations provide no conclusive evidence for the site of the @xmath0-ray flares .",
    "here we discuss possible explanations for the absence in non-@xmath0-ray bands of variability that is obviously correlated with the @xmath0-ray flare .",
    "in addition we present a conceptual model for the production of the @xmath0-ray flares .",
    "as was recognized immediately , the sed of @xmath0-ray flares peak near a characteristic energy about 5 times the energy @xmath116  @xmath6 , which is identified with radiation - reaction - limited synchrotron ( magneto - bremsstrahlung ) emission ( e.g. , landau & lifshitz 1959 ) . subjected to comparable parallel and perpendicular electromagnetic acceleration , an electron radiates at this energy , independent of the strength of the acceleration .",
    "an electron emitting synchrotron radiation in a magnetostatic field with peak emission at several @xmath117  @xmath6  would cool in turning through @xmath118  radian and would thus require a parallel electric field @xmath119 to compensate the radiative loss .    the crab pulsar releases energy in an essentially electromagnetic form .",
    "poynting flux flows radially outward from the the pulsar through the light cylinder at @xmath120  km and into an outflowing wind , where at least some of the electromagnetic - energy flux may transform into a plasma - energy flux .",
    "how , where , and to what extent this happens has long been a matter of debate ( e.g. , arons 2010 ; kirk et al .",
    "furthermore , the electromagnetic component has a dc toroidal part with an associated quadrupolar current distribution , and an ac , `` striped '' part containing current sheets separated by @xmath121  km .",
    "the transformation from electromagnetic to plasma energy might be non - dissipative  through the action of a lorentz force ( e.g. , bogovalov 1997 ; bogovalov 2001)or dissipative  through particle heating and acceleration ( e.g. , coroniti 1990 ; lyubarsky & kirk 2001 ; sironi & spitkovsky 2011 ) .",
    "however , it must occur somewhere as magnetic flux would otherwise accumulate in the nebula , ultimately reacting back on the pulsar",
    ". some of this transformation from electromagnetic to plasma energy may occur at a shock ( ptri & lyubarsky 2007 ; sironi & spitkovsky 2011 ) with radius @xmath122  cm , where the wind momentum flux balances the ambient nebular pressure ( rees & gunn 1974 ; kennel & coroniti 1984 ) .",
    "it has also been proposed that the toroidal field loops contract to form an axial pinch ( identified with the x - ray jet ) and reconnect at an equatorial current sheet ( the torus ) ( komissarov & lyubarsky 2003 ; del zanna , amato , & bucciantini 2004 ; camus et al .",
    "2009 ) .    in many respects",
    "the pulsar is a current generator .",
    "the supersonic wind contains outflowing fluxes of electrons and positrons .",
    "( any ions that are present behave like positrons of similar rigidity but do not radiate . )",
    "the difference in their fluxes determine the current density .",
    "this current may concentrate into sheets and filaments , where strong dissipation can occur  as happens in heliospheric and laboratory plasmas ( gosling et al .",
    "2005 ; sui & holman 2003 ; sergeev et al .",
    "in particular , the inner wind , the shock , the jet , and the torus are all natural sites of rapid dissipation and @xmath0-ray emission . if we consider this dissipation more generally under electromagnetic conditions , a current @xmath123 may be associated with a potential difference @xmath124 where @xmath125 is the impedance of free space and we drop model - dependent constants of order unity .",
    "( this result can be anticipated on the basis of dimensional analysis or exhibited in particular simple cases . ) the maximum energy to which an electron or positron can be accelerated is @xmath126 @xmath10  @xmath127 and the expected power is then @xmath128 . on this basis ,",
    "a spectrum of currents extending up to @xmath4  ta should suffice to account for the @xmath0-ray variations .",
    "however , currents do not automatically dissipate as just described .",
    "large electric fields are normally discharged in a few plasma periods .",
    "the best way to create them here is transiently over a few larmor periods and radii .",
    "this , in turn , requires local charge separation of the plasma in the emission site . to be more precise",
    ", the density @xmath129 of electrons plus positrons / ions will combine to create a local current density @xmath130 .",
    "for example , in the case of a pinch , the gradient , polarization and curvature drifts automatically produce the axial current .",
    "however , a supporting local electric field of strength @xmath131 also requires that @xmath132 .    put another way ,",
    "the charge and current are mostly in an emission site that is a few larmor radii in size and survives for a few larmor periods of the @xmath0-ray emitting particles .",
    "when this happens , the `` ohmic '' dissipation is radiative , not collisional as is normally the case . for this to occur",
    ", the particles must be sufficiently energetic to radiate efficiently .",
    "this requires that most of the particles are concentrated in an emission site that is as small as @xmath133  cm .",
    "the key point is that there should be extensive and sustained radiation - reaction - limited emission at the peak @xmath0-ray - flare energy , even though the particle energy and magnetic field might be changing .",
    "note that when this condition is unsatisfied , efficient particle acceleration to lower energy should still result : most of the magnetic dissipation and particle acceleration in the nebula might occur in this fashion .",
    "detailed modeling is necessary to determine whether or not such a scheme can reproduce the powerful , narrow - band @xmath0-ray variation that is observed ( uzdensky et al .",
    "2011 ; cerutti et al .",
    "2012 ; cerutti , uzdensky , & begelman 2012 ; lyutikov , balsara , & matthews 2012 ; bykov et al .",
    "2012 ; sturrock & aschwanden 2012 ; blandford & yuan 2012 ) and to see if unstable magnetized plasmas , carrying large currents , evolve to satisfy these conditions .",
    "whether we interpret the @xmath0-rays as coming from radiation - reaction - limited synchrotron emission or simply extrapolate the observed @xmath0-ray spectra to lower energy , it should not be surprising that direct , associated emission has not yet been observed in the x - ray , optical , or radio bands : in these bands the contrast with the steady emission is too small to be easily noticed .",
    "however , the indirect effects could be larger and detectable .",
    "for example , the large 2011-april flare produced a radiant energy of @xmath134  ergs if isotropic , equivalent to the energy contained within a region of size @xmath135  cm subtending an angle @xmath136  arcsec .",
    "it seems unlikely that the dynamical aftermath of a major flare would not alter the ambient emission  either through compression or rarefaction that would cause the magnetic field strength and the electron distribution function to change significantly .",
    "the associated surface brightness change should be several percent , assuming a total emission region of size @xmath136  arcsec , consistent with our upper limits .",
    "even if future observations fail to exhibit associated emission , they may still rule out specific detailed mechanisms in local sites .",
    "understanding the emission mechanism could have a significance beyond pulsar wind nebulae .",
    "in particular , it could provide a clue to the surprisingly rapidly variable emission seen in relativistic jets in the radio , optical , x - ray , and @xmath8  bands .",
    "if so , the crab nebula would once again be the source of fresh and important astrophysical insight .",
    "using the _ chandra _ , keck , and vla observatories , we acquired x - ray , near - ir and radio images of the crab nebula , contemporaneous with the 2011-april @xmath0-ray flare .",
    "we searched for variability in the x - ray data over two time - scale ranges : first we tested for pointing - to - pointing variations amongst the 5 pointings , each with an effective exposure time @xmath137  s and a minimum separation of 0.6  days .",
    "second we tested for variations within each of the 5 observations . in neither case",
    "did we detect statistically significant x - ray variations ; thus we can set only upper limits to any x - ray variations associated with the @xmath0-ray flare .",
    "as the _ chandra _   acis images suffer severe pile - up near the crab pulsar , our search for variability in the x - ray images was not sensitive to variations within the central @xmath138 or so .    comparing the upper limits to x - ray variations with the _ fermi_-lat - measured @xmath0-ray variations , we set upper limits at @xmath139%-confidence to the effective x - ray@xmath0-ray photon power - law index @xmath140 to @xmath141 , dependent upon assumptions about the x - ray index @xmath142 . as _",
    "fermi_-lat measures a @xmath0-ray index @xmath143 for the flaring component , it is statistically possible that the flaring component s spectrum extends as a simple power - law from @xmath0-rays to x - rays .",
    "further , we note that our upper limit to @xmath74 is consistent with transparent synchrotron emission , whose photon index must be @xmath144 .",
    "comparison of two keck near - ir observations found that the inner knot ( @xmath145 from the pulsar ) was somewhat brighter than average during the @xmath0-ray flare , but well within the normal range of brightness fluctuations typically observed .",
    "we used the measured ( @xmath146 ) change in the near - ir flux from this knot as an upper limit to near - ir variations associated with the @xmath0-ray flare .",
    "we also performed a number of vla observations searching for a point source appearing either at an unusual location and/or contemporaneous with the @xmath0-ray flare .",
    "other than the pulsar itself , no such source was detected .",
    "figure  [ f : sed ] shows the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the crab nebula over the observed electromagnetic spectrum .",
    "the plot also shows the sed of the 2011-april @xmath0-ray flare and the various limits determined here on variable radio , near - infrared , and x - ray emission possibly associated with the @xmath0-ray flare .    finally , we reviewed and discussed potential implications of @xmath0-ray flares and theoretical issues to be addressed .",
    "we concluded that , apart from lower - energy emission directly associated with the @xmath0-ray flare itself , the dynamical aftermath of a major flare could alter the ambient emission  e.g. , through compression of the magnetic field .",
    "the associated surface brightness change would likely be only several percent , assuming a total emission region of size @xmath147 , consistent with our upper limits .",
    "although no  smoking gun \" has been identified , one should be encouraged that we have identified a number of regions in the x - ray images that are possible candidates .",
    "we have also established further target of opportunity observations with _",
    "chandra _   and hst that will be triggered at the onset of the next @xmath0-ray flare .",
