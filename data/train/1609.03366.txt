    "the formation of wrinkles and their localization into folds is observed when a layered material is progressively compressed . as such , they occur in a variety of systems at different scales in nature from the folding of geological strata @xcite to the morphogenesis of biological tissues such as the cerebral cortex@xcite or fingerprints @xcite as well as in the growth of biofilms @xcite . just as nature uses these mechanical instabilities to generate intricate patterns",
    ", wrinkling instabilities are also finding a number of technological applications from flexible electronic devices @xcite to controlled patterned surfaces @xcite that have improved light harvesting efficiency @xcite or surface hydrophobicity @xcite . because of this ubiquity and the renewed interest in taking control of elastic instability , the deformation of layered elastic materials has been the object of renewed interest recently , with a number of fundamental studies in the past decade @xcite .",
    "the simplest example of elastic instability is the classic euler buckling @xcite in which a compressed beam buckles over its entire length . to use elastic instability for pattern formation",
    "usually requires the selection of a length scale other than the system size , however .",
    "perhaps the simplest example of such a system is provided by an elastic film ( of bending stiffness per unit width @xmath0 ) floating on a liquid of density @xmath1 and subject to an axial compression .",
    "this system quickly forms wrinkles with a wavelength @xmath2  a result that expresses the compromise between the bending rigidity of the film ( which prefers large - amplitude wrinkles ) and the weight of the liquid ( @xmath3 being the gravitational acceleration ) , which prefers many small - amplitude wrinkles@xcite .",
    "this wrinkling instability can also be observed in other types of floating materials such as thin layers of nanoparticles@xcite , surfactants @xcite or particle rafts @xcite . however , at some point most of these wrinkles begin to shrink with a very small number growing to form much larger ` folds ' ; although other options ( such as delamination@xcite ) exist , folds are more generically observed and so we focus on them in this paper .",
    "the nature of the wrinkle - to - fold transition in this system has been somewhat controversial : it was initially suggested ( on the basis of experiments ) that folds form at a critical compression .",
    "several numerical and analytical works have studied the wrinkle - to - fold transition in idealized situations ( in which the elastic film is infinitely long and weightless @xcite ) and have shown that in these scenarios the transition is not sharp : i.e.  folds emerge continuously from the wrinkled state .",
    "recently , a more realistic model ( incorporating the finite length of the film ) demonstrated that this transition emerges at a finite compression making a second - order transition @xcite . despite the amount of work on the wrinkle - to - fold transition , several questions remain unanswered .",
    "for example , existing models suggest that downwards and upwards folds should be equally favourable , while experiments report exclusively downward folds .",
    "moreover , what happens beyond the transition between these two states has not been described experimentally but only via numerical simulations@xcite with the weight of the film discussed in scaling terms . in the first part of this paper we investigate the effect of the film weight on the wrinkle - to - fold transition while in the second part we focus on the evolution of the fold upon further compression .",
    "we observe that the fold becomes a closed loop after self - contact , encapsulating a volume of the upper fluid . as the applied compression",
    "is increased , we observe that the fold either sinks deeper without limit or eventually bends upward , depending on the relative buoyancy of the drop - film combination .",
    "we predict the regime diagram for this behaviour theoretically .",

    "is then poured slowly on top of the film ( so that no oil invades the lower surface of the film , in contact with water ) .",
    "one of the pmma plates is mounted on two perpendicular manual translation stages for alignment in the ( @xmath18,@xmath23 ) direction and connected to a stepper motor ( ` thorlabs ` ) of micrometer precision .",
    "the compression is quasi - static : the stepper motor displaces the plate in small increments at a constant speed .",

    "an additional source of discrepancy between the experimental results and the numerical model may be , once again , that we underestimate the size of the teardrop , since we measure its shape at the edge of the film ( where it is affected by surface tension ) and not at its centre .",
    "it may also be due to how we oversimplify the boundary condition at the top of the beam . here",
    ", we have assumed that a clamped boundary condition is appropriate but we have observed that the top of the fold can slide and rotate slightly as the compression is varied .",
    "we have studied experimentally the behaviour of thin elastic films under uniaxial compression at a liquid - fluid interface . as previously observed ,",
    "when confinement increases the film undergoes a transition from a uniform wrinkled state to a localized configuration in which a single fold is observed .",
    "we showed that the film weight affects the wrinkle - to - fold transition , breaking the up - down symmetry of the light film problem considered previously .",
    "more importantly , however , the film weight plays a large role in the evolution of the fold beyond the transition : it may bend back towards the fluid interface or grow deeper as compression is increased .",
    "a simple model predicts the two possible behaviours in a phase diagram .    the experimental results presented here allow us to confirm some previous theoretical assumptions but",
    "also highlight the role of the film weight and surface tension in the formation and evolution of a fold .",
    "the teardrop shape observed after self - contact seems similar to the so - called  self - encapsulation \" of an elastic rod which is observed in a solely elastic situation when a rod covering a fixed span is loaded at the middle with a transverse force such that two points of the rod come into contact with each other@xcite .",
    "finally , this study could give insight into the elastic properties of compressed particle - laden interfaces , which exhibit a wrinkling instability similar to that described for elastic films in this letter .",
    "for example , our results show that such films may encapsulate a teardrop of the upper ( lower ) fluid if the dimensionless parameter @xmath76 ( @xmath77 ) ; this may provide a novel route for the creation of cylindrical , particle - coated droplets @xcite by compressing a particle - laden interface .",
    "in such settings , the granular aspect of the interface allows the interface s mechanical properties to be tuned by probing new parameters such as the particle size , density or packing fraction @xcite as well as the solid - liquid contact angles .",
    "however , the granular aspect also affects the stress state within the layer at the onset of wrinkling @xcite meaning that the transition from wrinkles to localized folds upon further compression remains to be carefully characterized in such systems .",
    "we are grateful to sbastien neukirch , vincent dmery and claude perdigou for useful discussions as well as aurlie fargette for her help with the preparation of thin films and julien chopin for his expertise with the tensile testing .",
