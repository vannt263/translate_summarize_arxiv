    "development of experimental techniques for constructing and exploring molecular devices has inspired extensive theoretical study of charge transport in molecules , with potential application in molecular electronics.@xcite one important issue related to stability of potential molecular devices involves heating and heat transport in molecular junctions .",

    "were reported only recently.@xcite    electron - vibration interactions in the junction ( leading to inelastic effects in charge transport@xcite ) may cause junction heating and affect its heat transport properties.@xcite theoretical considerations of thermoelectric properties so far either completely disregarded such effects ( in treatments based on the landauer theory@xcite ) or included it within a scattering theory framework.@xcite the latter treats the effect of vibrations as an inelastic electron scattering process , and changes in the non - equilibrium distributions of electrons and vibrations are not described in a self - consistent manner .",
    "it has been shown that such changes may have qualitative effects on the transport.@xcite note also that scattering theory approaches may lead to erroneous predictions due to neglecting effects of contacts fermi seas on the junction electronic structure.@xcite    this paper is motivated by recent measurements of the seebeck coefficient in molecular junctions.@xcite considerations based on landauer formula were employed there to interpret experimental data .",

    "the existence of a similar crossover in the self - consistent results can be inferred by comparing figures  [ fig_get_seebeck_iv]a and b. 4 .   a smaller value of the electron - phonon coupling @xmath19 naturally leads to a smaller difference between self - consistent and scattering theory calculations ( compare figs .

    "this gives no thermoelectric current when @xmath109 , hence as @xmath110 one needs a higher temperature difference in order to compensate for the same bias . as a result ,",

    "electron - vibration interaction can either increase or decrease seebeck coefficient depending on the physical situation .",
    "we study the dependence of this influence on different parameters of the model ( applied bias , gap between molecular level and fermi energy , strengths of coupling between molecule and contacts , between tunneling electron and molecular vibration , between molecular vibration coupling and thermal baths , and frequency of the vibration ) . comparing results of the two approaches ,",
    "we show that scattering theory based approach may fail both quantitatively and qualitatively .",
    "experimental data presented in ref .",
    "@xcite does not give conclusive evidence for the relative importance of inelastic processes .",
    "more extensive measurements showing dependence of the seebeck coefficient on junction parameters are needed in order to make definite conclusion .",
