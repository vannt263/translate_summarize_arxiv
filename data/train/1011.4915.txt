    "very recently the existence of a large number of copies of standard model ( sm ) particles has been proposed as a possibility to lower the planck scale and solve the electroweak hierarchy problem @xcite .",
    "it was shown that in this scenario the fundamental quantum gravity scale @xmath1 is related to the effective planck scale @xmath2 as .",
    "this implies @xmath3 for @xmath4 and thus solves the hierarchy problem @xcite .",
    "the above bound is imposed by consistency of large distance black hole dynamics @xcite in the presence of @xmath0 copies of the sm fields .",
    "moreover , in @xcite this scenario has been advocated also as a mechanism for generating small neutrino masses , providing an attractive alternative for seesaw , extra dimensional and other known mechanisms .",
    "it is assumed that there exists one sm singlet right - handed neutrino @xmath5 per sm@xmath6 copy , so that @xmath7 .",
    "the mechanism relies on the fact that the right - handed neutrinos , being sm singlets , couple to all the sm copies `` democratically '' .",
    "this sm singlet democracy , combined with the requirement of unitarity of the theory , leads to a @xmath8 suppression of the yukawa couplings to the left - handed neutrinos @xmath9 and thus a suppression of the corresponding dirac neutrino mass terms .",
    "thus the minimalistic approach to the problem of small neutrino masses advocated in @xcite suggests that @xmath10 violating majorana masses of @xmath5 are unnecessary in this scenario and lepton number could assumed to be conserved .",
    "the assumption of lepton number conservation is however rather ad hoc , as there is no fundamental reason to forbid majorana masses for the right - handed neutrinos and lepton number conservation appears as an accidental symmetry .",
    "moreover , quantum gravity breaks global symmetries , and then conserved lepton number requires a gauged @xmath10 symmetry @xmath11 .",
    "the latter should be spontaneously broken to avoid the existence of the corresponding massless gauge boson , stringently constrained by phenomenology .",
    "on the other hand , lepton number violation might be helpful for successful baryogenesis .    in the following we analyze the issue of lepton number violation within the @xmath0-copies sm .",
    "we assume a @xmath12 gauge symmetry of the @xmath0-copies sm including a common anomaly free gauge factor @xmath11 .",
    "this gauge factor prevents the appearance of phenomenologically dangerous lepton number violating ( lnv ) operators induced by tev black holes .",
    "an additional permutation symmetry @xmath13 acting in the space of the sm@xmath14 species ( @xmath15 ) is also imposed @xcite . which , to be unaffected by black holes ,",
    "should be considered as a gauged symmetry in the sense of being a discrete subgroup @xmath16 of some continuous gauge group @xmath17 spontaneously broken down to @xmath13 .",
    "the lagrangian terms relevant for our discussion are the following : @xmath18 the model involves @xmath0 right - handed sm singlet neutrinos @xmath19 and one sm singlet complex scalar field @xmath20 having the @xmath10-charge equal to + 2",
    ". then the trilinear @xmath21 couplings are forbidden in ( [ lag ] ) .",
    "the @xmath11 is spontaneously broken by a vacuum expectation value @xmath22 resulting in the appearance of a majorana mass term from the second term in eq .",
    "( [ lag ] ) .",
    "we assume that the scale of @xmath10 breaking lies below the gravity cutoff @xmath1 .",
    "the dirac mass terms considered in ref .",
    "@xcite arise from the first term after the electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "we now consider the yukawa coupling @xmath23 matrix @xmath24 of dirac type , following ref . @xcite . as",
    "the @xmath25 fields are not charged under the sm symmetry , they can not be assigned to a single sm - copy , apart from respecting the same transformation properties under a permutation symmetry acting on the space of species .",
    "this permutation symmetry constrains the yukawa coupling matrix to the form [ lambda ] _",
    "ij= (    cccc a & b & b & .. + b & a & b & .. + b & b & a & .. + .. & .. & .. & .. +    ) .",
    "this matrix , combined in the first term in ( [ lag ] ) with the sm higgs expectation value @xmath26 , results in the dirac neutrino mass matrix @xmath27 here following ref .",
    "@xcite we assume that the electroweak symmetry breaking leaves the permutation symmetry unbroken .",
    "this implies that the vevs of all the higgs species are equal to the same value @xmath28 . a key point ensuring in the scenario of ref .",
    "@xcite the smallness of neutrino mass matrix entries is the smallness of the yukawa coupling matrix ( [ lambda ] ) , which follows from the requirement of unitarity of the theory .",
    "this can be shown by considering right - handed neutrino inclusive production in the scattering of the sm particles , as displayed in fig .",
    "1(a ) . at high energies",
    "the rate of this process grows like [ bd - n ] n b^2 e , as follows from dimensional analysis .",
    "here we assumed @xmath29 , which is suggested by the observation that these two quantities are of the same nature and there exists no fundamental reason for them to be very different in magnitude @xcite .",
    "unitarity below the gravity cutoff is preserved only for [ b - n ] b. thus the neutrino mass matrix ( [ m - d ] ) results in @xmath30 dirac neutrinos with tiny masses @xmath31 @xcite , which fulfill the experimental bounds constraining them to the sub - ev scale . one neutrino state in this framework is very heavy , with mass of the order @xmath32 , which is comparable with the effective planck scale .",
    "( lepton number conserving ) ; ( b ) via exchange of the higgs singlet ( lepton number violating ) .",
    "@xmath33 denotes some of the sm fields coupled to @xmath34 with strength @xmath35 .",
    "[ large - n ] ]    ]     copies of the sm particle content .",
    "[ 0vbb - n ] ]    now let us turn to the second term of eq .",
    "( [ lag ] ) which upon breaking the @xmath10 symmetry leads to the majorana mass matrix of the right - handed neutrinos @xmath36 the permutation symmetry constrains the majorana type yukawa coupling @xmath23 matrix in the same way as for the case of dirac type yukawa couplings to be of the form _",
    "ij= (    cccc c & d & d & .. + d & c & d & .. + d & d & c & .. + .. & .. & .. & .. +    ) .",
    "the similarity arguments used above to justify @xmath29 in eqs .",
    "( [ lambda ] ) , ( [ bd - n ] ) can equally be applied to motivate @xmath37 .",
    "now , when considering the scattering process of right - handed neutrinos , both final states can be any of the @xmath0 copies as in fig .",
    "1(b ) and , thus , the inclusive rate grows like n^2 c^2 d^2 e , which preserves unitarity below the gravity cutoff only for [ c - n ] c ~d . an even more stringent bound results from the diagram of higgs doublet scattering in fig .  [ scalar ] , n^4 ^2d^4 e. the scalar quartic couplings @xmath38 should not be very small since there is no symmetry protecting its smallness .",
    "thus @xmath39 can be assumed for rough estimations .",
    "this implies [ cd - lim ] c~d .",
    "this limit remains unaffected if additional @xmath20-branches are inserted in the diagram in fig .",
    "2 . consequently",
    "the neutrino majorana mass matrix entries ( [ m - m ] ) are even more strongly suppressed as the dirac masses discussed above .",
    "we now turn to the neutrino mass spectrum and mixing . the mass matrix written in the basis of the 2@xmath0 fields @xmath40 ( @xmath41 , @xmath42 ) has the following form , @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are @xmath46 submatrices given by eqs .",
    "( [ m - d])-([m - m ] ) .",
    "the set of @xmath47 mass eigenstates @xmath48 of this symmetric matrix splits into two groups of @xmath49 degenerate states @xmath50 and @xmath51 and another two states @xmath52 .",
    "these groups correspond to two @xmath30 dimensional and two singlet representations of the permutation group @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "the resulting eigenstates are @xmath53 with @xmath54 \\langle s\\rangle ,   \\ \\ \\",
    "g_{n } = [ a+ ( n-1 ) b]\\langle h\\rangle , \\\\",
    "\\nonumber \\delta_{n } & = &   \\sqrt{4 g_{n}^{2 } + \\sigma_{n}^{2 } } , \\ \\ \\ \\ n=0,n.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here we denoted the mixing matrix element of each state with the neutrino of the original sm copy by @xmath55 .",
    "all phenomenological manifestations of the two sets of @xmath49 degenerate states specified above are identical to two effective fields @xmath50 and @xmath51 with masses @xmath56 and @xmath57 , respectively .",
    "they are defined as @xmath58    thus , the left - handed neutrino interaction eigenstate of the original sm copy ( @xmath59 ) can be written as @xmath60 where the effective mixing matrix element of @xmath61 with @xmath62 is defined as @xmath63 assuming @xmath29 and @xmath37 as discussed above we find @xmath64 whith @xmath65 thus there are two light states @xmath61 and two very heavy states @xmath52 with a mass ratio @xmath66 of @xmath67",
    ". for consistency with the neutrino phenomenology one needs one neutrino at sub - ev scale , say , @xmath68ev .",
    "then , as seen from eqs .",
    "( [ def-6 ] ) , the states @xmath52 are pushed in mass towards the effective planck scale and , therefore , their phenomenological impact is negligible .",
    "the light majorana states @xmath61 have a very small mass splitting @xmath69 and form a quasi dirac state with mass @xmath70 .",
    "thus these light states are expected to induce lepton number violating processes at rates @xmath71 . however , due to the structure of the mass matrix ( [ massmatr-1 ] ) with zero submatrix in the upper - left corner , lnv processes are even more strongly suppressed .",
    "the contribution of light @xmath72 and heavy @xmath73 majorana neutrinos with the masses @xmath74 and @xmath75 , respectively , to the amplitude @xmath76 of a generic lnv processes can be schematically written as @xmath77 here @xmath78 denotes all mass eigenstates , while @xmath79 and @xmath80 denote the light and heavy sets @xmath81 and @xmath82 , respectively , and @xmath83 is the characteristic momentum of the lnv process under consideration .",
    "here we defined @xmath84 for neutrinoless double beta decay @xmath85 , which is the most sensitive probe of lnv , the characteristic momentum is @xmath86 105 mev .",
    "for other lnv processes such as meson decays and equal sign dileptons in pp - collisions , this characteristic momentum @xmath83 is even larger .    from the definition ( [ def of eff nu masses ] ) and eqs .",
    "( [ egs])-([u - eff ] ) it follows that the leading term of the expansion ( [ lnv - amplitude expansion ] ) vanishes , @xmath87 .",
    "this result can be understood by taking into account the following two facts .",
    "first , the following relation holds , @xmath88 where now the summation runs over all masses of both heavy and light neutrinos . here the mass matrix @xmath89 with zero @xmath23 upper - left corner is given in ( [ massmatr-1 ] ) .",
    "second , as we mentioned before in eqs .",
    "( [ egs ] ) , the light neutrino states belong to two @xmath49 dimensional representations of the permutation group @xmath13 while the two heavy states are @xmath13-singlets .",
    "thus , due to symmetry reasons the cancellation in the sum ( [ fact-1 ] ) can only happen within the same representation , in other words , within @xmath90 group of light neutrino states and @xmath91 heavy neutrino states .",
    "this can be directly confirmed by substituting eqs .",
    "( [ egs])-([u - eff ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ def of eff nu masses ] ) .",
    "thus the @xmath92 sm exhibits the curious property that the expression ( [ fact-1 ] ) vanishes individually also if the sum runs only over the eigenstates being much lighter than @xmath93 , which corresponds exactly to the usually dominating contribution to neutrinoless double beta decay originating from the first term in eq .",
    "( [ lnv - amplitude expansion ] ) .",
    "consequently the first non - vanishing contribution to the lnv amplitude starts from the second term in eq .",
    "( [ lnv - amplitude expansion ] ) .",
    "this fact can also be illustrated diagrammatically as in fig .",
    "[ 0vbb - n ] . from eqs .",
    "( [ u - eff])-([def-6 ] ) and ( [ def of eff nu masses ] ) it follows that @xmath94 therefore , the amplitudes ( [ lnv - amplitude expansion ] ) of lnv processes in the studied framework are extremely small .    however , this conclusion is based on the assumption @xmath29 and @xmath37 which does not have a firm physical motivation since the parameters @xmath95 are not directly subject to the unitarity constraints like in eq .",
    "( [ b - n ] ) and ( [ cd - lim ] ) .",
    "we thus examine what are the typical rates of lnv processes in the scenario in which the latter assumption is relaxed .",
    "now the parameters @xmath95 should not be expected very small because they are not suppressed by any symmetry .",
    "assuming @xmath96 to avoid phenomenological problems with a new light gauge boson in eqs .",
    "( [ egs ] ) we have @xmath97 thus , there are still two very heavy states with masses @xmath98 , which contribute to the amplitude of lnv processes via the last term in eq .",
    "( [ lnv - amplitude expansion ] ) and this contribution is negligible .",
    "the other two majorana states with masses @xmath99 are not necessarily light , since the suppression due to multiple sm copies is absent now .",
    "their masses are related as @xmath100 to ensure the phenomenological consistency of this scenario one has to require that there exists a light neutrino .",
    "thus , we assume that @xmath101 ev and study the corresponding mass @xmath102 .",
    "the condition @xmath103 is required in order to push the masses of the @xmath10 gauge boson and the singlet higgs @xmath20 towards sufficiently large values to elude current experimental limits .",
    "however in the @xmath92 sm @xcite the values of @xmath104 larger than the gravity cutoff @xmath105(tev ) make little sense .",
    "reasonable values are around @xmath106  tev . in the present scenario",
    "there are no symmetry or other reasons supporting any significant difference between the diagonal yukawa couplings of @xmath107 and @xmath20 higgs fields in eq .",
    "( [ lag ] ) .",
    "therefore , for estimations it is reasonable to assume @xmath108 .",
    "then one obtains @xmath109  ev . thus for this rather typical case the natural values of both masses @xmath57 and @xmath56 are much smaller than the typical momentum scales of lnv processes @xmath110 mev .",
    "this means that again @xmath111 and the leading contribution to the lnv amplitude ( [ lnv - amplitude expansion ] ) is @xmath112 this is far beyond the sensitivity of possible experimental observations .",
    "the most sensitive @xmath113 experiments have reached the limit on the double beta decay observable @xmath114 ev @xcite .",
    "this conclusion is valid unless a strong hierarchy @xmath115 between the lepton number violating and lepton flavor conserving yukawa couplings @xmath116 and @xmath117 , respectively , is considered .",
    "then @xmath118 mev and @xmath119 and the lnv amplitude ( [ lnv - amplitude expansion ] ) may become large .",
    "however , as we commented above , this situation is rather unnatural since in the present scenario there is no symmetry or other mechanism supporting this hierarchy .",
    "in this paper we have adressed a problem arising in any scenario with a low quantum gravity scale : do lnv operators induced by tev scale black holes invalidate the model ? for the case of the @xmath92-copies sm we have shown that this consequence is avoided due to a non - trivial cancelation mechanism .",
    "this property should be considered as an important benefit of the model .",
    "nevertheless , the presence of a large number of right - handed majorana states may have interesting phenomenological consequences .",
    "for example , a very naive estimate of the right - handed neutrino decay diagrams on tree and one - loop level , which give rise to the baryon asymmetry in leptogenesis , scale as @xmath120 from the yukawa coupling with @xmath0 copies of @xmath25 , contributing potentially to the decay , and the @xmath25 propagator in the loop diagram .",
    "so the process may be relevant despite the fact that lnv signals are strongly suppressed for the left - handed neutrino states .",
    "a similar line of reasoning may apply e.g. to single @xmath25 production at the lhc .",
    "finally we did not address the effects of the new neutrino degress of freedom on big - bang nucleosynthesis @xcite and the phenomenology of baryon number violation and proton decay @xcite in the present scenario .",
    "these and other phenomenological consequences will be discussed elsewhere .",
