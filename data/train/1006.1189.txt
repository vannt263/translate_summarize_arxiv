    ", supernova activity has apparently produced a hot x - ray emitting component and has arguably impacted the composition and kinematics of the warm and cold ism components as well @xcite . our goal in this paper is to provide a systematic overview of the physical state of and the relation between these components using a panchromatic suite of x - ray , optical , and radio datasets .",
    "we use a 20 ksec imaging observation with the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ in order to characterize the distribution of the hot x - ray emitting plasma in relation to the ionized and neutral gas and provide a complete analysis of the x - ray point source population in and around he  2 - 10 .",
    "previous analyses of these _ chandra _ data by @xcite and @xcite have addressed the integrated x - ray properties of he  2 - 10 in the context of larger samples of star - forming galaxies with diffuse x - ray emission . these studies",
    "concluded that the hot ism is mildly enriched in @xmath8-process elements , consistent with the mixing of fresh supernova ejecta from the recent starburst into the surrounding ism .",
    "our focus here is a more detailed look at both the diffuse and compact x - ray components of he  2 - 10 than previously reported .",
    "we show that @xmath8-element enrichment is not strictly required to fit the x - ray spectrum , we identify a hard ultraluminous x - ray source as a counterpart to a nuclear radio source , and we discuss the relative energetics and morphologies of the cold , warm , and hot phases of the ism to understand the state of the starburst - driven outflow .",
    "first , we provide a brief review of the global characteristics of he  2 - 10 that will be relevant to later discussion .",

    "given the relatively small 20@xmath1720  ( 0.89  kpc@xmath18 ) region containing all of this activity , the star formation rate per unit area is at least @xmath7 2 m@xmath3  yr@xmath1 kpc@xmath19 .",

    "unbinned images were extracted from the time - filtered events file in four carefully chosen bands : soft ( s ) 0.30.7  kev , medium ( m ) 0.71.1  kev , hard ( h ) 1.16  kev , and total ( t ) 0.36  kev .",
    "emission in the soft band is somewhat attenuated because the galactic foreground column , @xmath36 ( hartmann & burton 1996 ) , corresponds to optical depth unity at 0.35  kev .",
    "the galaxy was not detected at energies above 6  kev , the energy adopted for the hard band cutoff .",

    "the smoothing scales are automatically adjusted to achieve a minimum s / n ratio of 1.8 and a maximum s / n ratio of 2.2 per pixel .",
    "strong point sources are effectively unchanged by the smoothing process , while the contrast of weak , diffuse emission is enhanced .",
    "each of the four background images was smoothed ( using the smoothing map generated by csmooth from the on - source images ) and subtracted from the source images .    since adaptive smoothing",
    "does not preserve photon statistics in a straightforward manner , we used the adaptively smoothed images only to produce images for presentation and to define large apertures for the extraction of diffuse component spectra .",
    "all quantitative analyses were performed by extracting photons from the events file or unsmoothed images and by estimating their significance using poisson statistics .",

    "three sources ( # s 1,2,3 ) lie projected against the stellar component of he  2 - 10 , while the remainder may be associated with field stars or background galaxies .",
    "celldetect found a subset of these 29 sources , but also yielded four additional sources not identified by wavdetect ( # s 30  33 ) .",
    "these four lie within 10  of the nucleus where the diffuse x - ray emission is strong , have sizes exceeding the nominal psf size , and , we show later , are likely to be localized peaks in the diffuse thermal emission .",

    "figure  [ x - rband ] shows these sources numbered 129 overlaid on an optical 6550   image .",
    "sources 1,2,3 and 3033 are better seen in figure  [ x - hst ] which shows an adaptively smoothed x - ray depiction ( _ contours _ ) of the henize  2 - 10 nucleus overlaid on a 400  s f814w image ( _ grayscale _ ) from the hubble space telescope archive @xcite .",

    "we measured counts in each of the four energy bands ( total , soft , medium , and hard ) using elliptical apertures containing probable source pixels as identified by wavdetect .",
    "annuli surrounding each aperture were defined manually and used for measuring and subtracting the background .",
    "table  1 lists the net counts detected in each band along with the ratio of the source size to the nominal psf .",
    "sources 1,2,3 , 10 and 3033 have psf ratios near 2 or larger , suggesting that they may be either extended sources or blends of multiple point sources .",
    "our detection threshold of @xmath94 counts in 20 ksec in the total 0.36 kev band on the _ chandra _ @xmath38 corresponds to an x - ray flux of 1.5@xmath39 based on the webpimms mission count rate simulator . at or above this flux level we would expect an x - ray source density of @xmath90.8 sources per square arcminute , based on the results of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . within the @xmath90.25 square degree region encompassing he  2 - 10",

    "statistically , the three ( possibly seven ) compact sources projected onto he  2 - 10 are likely to lie within the galaxy itself .",

    "were combined to produce an image with a mean stellar fwhm of 1.2 .",
    "a rough r - band flux calibration was performed on the image using the magnitudes of 8 stars in the field based on the guide star catalog f - band magnitudes .",
    "the typical uncertainty is 0.5 mag .",
    "poor weather and low target elevation prevented @xmath15 narrow band exposures from being taken .",
    "we instead obtained a continuum - subtracted @xmath15 image of henize  2 - 10 which appeared in @xcite ( kindly given to us by c. esteban . )",
    "the @xmath15 image is flux calibrated using the calibration of @xcite .",
    "radio continuum observations of henize  2 - 10 at 20 cm ( 1420 mhz ) and 2 cm ( 15 ghz ) were obtained with the very large array in the b configuration and published previously in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "full details may be found in those papers .",
    "we used the 20-cm data mapped with a synthesized beam of 3  fwhm to search for radio sources in the field surrounding he  2 - 10 that correspond to the detected x - ray and optical sources .",
    "other than henize  2 - 10 itself , there are no 20-cm radio sources within the 8  _ chandra  _  field to a 3@xmath37 limit of 0.6 mjy .",
    "sources 13 and 3033 appear superimposed on diffuse emission near the nucleus of henize  2 - 10 , and all have psf ratios between 2 and 4 , while the remainder of the 26 compact sources further from the nucleus have psf ratios not far from unity .",
    "these nuclear objects may either be genuine point sources ( i.e. , x - ray binaries or collections of x - ray binaries ) projected onto regions of diffuse gas , or they may be local maxima in the diffuse emission . the second possibility better explains their larger sizes compared to the field sources .",
    "their x - ray colors help to discriminate between these possibilities .",
    "figure  [ 2color ] shows an x - ray two - color diagram formed from ratios of count rates in the hard , medium , and soft bandpasses : @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "the left panels include only the seven sources projected against the nucleus , while right panels show the other 26 sources .",

    "sources 13 are consistent with @xmath42 power law spectra behind modest absorbing columns .",
    "these three objects are strongest in the hard band , consistent with heavily absorbed spectra .",
    "sources 2 and 3 are too faint for meaningful spectral fits , but lower limits on their luminosities can be made assuming a _ minimum _ column density of @xmath43  for the galactic foreground and a power law spectrum with photon index @xmath44 where the number of photons per energy bin is given by n(e)@xmath45 .",

    ". however , the uncertainties in the foreground column and the photon energy distribution would allow for intrinsic luminosities several times greater than these estimates if @xmath48 and @xmath49 were larger than the values adopted here .",
    "we note that both of these objects appear to lie within the older starburst region `` b '' @xcite several arcseconds to the east of the dominant starburst core region ( `` a '' ) .",
    "by contrast with sources 2 & 3 , sources 3033 are strongest in the medium band , consistent with the color expected of soft thermal plasma .",
    "the upper right panel of figure  [ 2color ] plots the colors of sources 429 .",

    "the candidate stars occupy a region of relatively low column density , as might be expected for galactic foreground objects .",

    "the compact sources 13 represent only a small fraction of the x - ray flux of henize  2 - 10 .",
    "we performed photometry on the x - ray images using an 80  diameter aperture centered on the nucleus to obtain a total flux for the galaxy .",
    "the size of this aperture was chosen to include all of the diffuse emission seen in the smoothed , background - subtracted total band ( 0.36.0 kev ) image .",
    "this aperture includes the seven compact sources in the main body of henize  2 - 10 and none of the other 26 sources in the field .",
    "the background flux was estimated using an annular region extending 15  beyond the circular aperture .",
    "table  [ phot.tab ] lists the results of this photometry in each band .",
    "table  [ phot.tab ] also indicates the fraction of diffuse emission after subtraction of the flux from the compact sources 13 .",
    "we find that 84@xmath594% of the emission in the total 0.36.0 kev band comes from diffuse emission . in the hard 1.16.0 kev band ,",
    "69@xmath599% of the emission is diffuse . in the soft and medium bands ,",
    "the fraction of flux from the diffuse x - ray medium is over 90% .",

    "no single - component spectral models produce acceptable fits to the data .",
    "reasonable models require at least two spectral components to reproduce both the low - energy peak near 1 kev and the secondary peak near 3 kev .",
    "this secondary high - energy peak is most pronounced in small 2  diameter spectral apertures centered on the nucleus and becomes weaker relative to the rest of the spectrum as the aperture size is increased .",

    "radio source # 3 in he  2 - 10 @xcite is also non - thermal ( @xmath82 ) , and , while the angular size is unresolved in the @xmath91  data , implying a diameter smaller than 50 pc , the non - detection of this source with few milliarcsecond resolutions rules out a compact supernova or supernova remnant and suggests an extended morphology @xcite .",
    "the ratio of radio to x - ray fluxes for this source , @xmath83 @xcite , is    @xmath84    this is in the range of other ulx sources and low - luminosity agn tabulated by @xcite ( @xmath85 ) , but higher than x - ray transients ( @xmath86 ) and lower than a supernova remnant like cas  a ( @xmath87 ) .",

    "except for the nuclear region inside 10  where extinction may be a significant factor , these tracers of the warm and hot phases , respectively , exhibit the same radial profile . inside the 10  nuclear region",
    ", the x - ray surface brightness drops below the h@xmath8 by a factor of @xmath89 ( 0.4 dex ) .",
    "this may be understood as a result of differential extinction between h@xmath8 , where a column density of 1.5@xmath23 @xmath11 corresponds to @xmath90 ( @xmath91 ) , and the peak of the thermal x - ray emission at 0.71.1 kev where @xmath92 for the same foreground column .",
    "the relative distributions of the warm and hot phases are better pictured in figure  [ 3colorco ] which shows the @xmath15 emission in red , the 0.71.1 kev medium band x - ray emission in green , and the optical continuum 6550   in blue .",
    "contours show the molecular gas as traced by @xmath93co 1 - 0 emission observed by the owens valley radio interferometer mapped at a resolution of 5  @xcite .",
    "although the kinematics of the atomic and molecular gas are complex , co velocity - field maps show rotation such that the elongation in the co integrated intensity contours probably traces a molecular `` disk '' within the rotational plane of henize  2 - 10 . the @xmath15 shells project to the e - ne and sw , presumably driven by starburst activity in the nucleus , and indicate a direction of expansion perpendicular to the molecular disk .",
    "figure  [ 3colorhi ] shows the extent of the @xmath15 emission ( red ) , the 0.71.1 kev medium band x - ray emission ( green ) , and the optical continuum 6550   ( blue ) relative to the neutral hydrogen 21-cm emission in contours @xcite .",
    "the contours correspond to column densities of n@xmath94 and @xmath95  @xmath11 averaged over a 30  beam .",
    "the higher - resolution 21-cm and co maps of @xcite indicate that henize  2 - 10 does contain regions of much larger column density exceeding @xmath96  @xmath11 on few arcsecond scales , but such localized peaks in the gas surface density are not visible in this low - resolution map .",
    "although the orientation of henize  2 - 10 is uncertain , figure  [ 3colorhi ] shows that the full extent of x - ray and h@xmath8 emission ( at least to the surfce brightnesses probed in the best existing x - ray and h@xmath8 observations ) is contained within the @xmath97  @xmath11 contour .",
    "if the distribution is approximately spherical , then the starburst - driven bubbles have not penetrated the neutral hydrogen envelope , at least to the level of 8@xmath10 @xmath11 . in contrast , polar superbubbles would have broken through a thick , low - inclination disk .",
    "the h@xmath8 emission and neutral gas absorption kinematics allow that we are seeing an expanding polar bubble approximately face - on , but do not require it .",
    "@xcite remark that the superbubbles to the east and north - east are blueshifted , perhaps forming the approaching side of a polar superbubble .",
    "the receding lobe could be largely hidden by extinction aside from a bit of redshifted h@xmath8 emission to the southwest .",
    "if the southwest x - ray lobe were viewed through the disk , the x - ray emission in figure  7 would appear harder to the southwest than it does towards the northeast .",
    "in fact , however , figure  [ 3colorx ] shows that the soft ( red ) regions are preferentially in the south and west .",
    "if the lobes are mainly polar , then the x - ray emission must be coming predominantly from the near side of the outflow .",
    "given the evidence for a recent merger in this galaxy @xcite combined with the ambiguity of the neutral and ionized gas velocity fields , we conclude that the geometry of the system defies simple characterization and may be dominated by transient features generated in the merger and outflow .",
    "we extracted a spectrum of the diffuse emission using a annular aperture centered on the nucleus which exclude the 2  region containing the nuclear point source .",
    "the aperture has inner radius 2  and outer radius 40 .",
    "a 30  square region located 60  north of he  2 - 10 was used to estimate the background .",
    "although spectrum may contain a contribution from faint unresolved x - ray binaries and the probable x - ray binaries source 2 and source 2 , that contribution is small compared to the diffuse emission .",
    "the diffuse spectrum contains 1040 counts and the spectrum was binned to produce a minimum of 15 counts per energy bin .",
    "the diffuse emission was modeled with simple x - ray thermal plasma models in xspec v11.3 . in all cases",
    "we adopted a galactic foreground column density of @xmath98  @xmath11 based on the integrated profile leiden / dwingeloo neutral hydrogen survey in this direction @xcite .",
    "table  [ spectra.tab ] lists the model description , the best fit parameters for these models , the reduced @xmath67 value as a goodness - of - fit statistic , and the implied 0.36.0 kev unabsorbed luminosity .",
    "motivated by results in other starburst galaxies where the data required at least two plasma components with different temperatures @xcite , we fit the spectrum with a two - temperature , solar - abundance model , where each component has the same absorbing column density .",
    "x - ray bubbles should contain plasma over a range of temperatures from very hot shocked @xmath9few kev gas to cooler @xmath90.1 kev material at the interface of the x - ray and neutral medium where instabilities and ablation mix the hot gas with the ambient ism @xcite .",
    "this model ( model 1 in table  [ spectra.tab ] ) produces a good fit to the data ( red .",
    "@xmath67=0.97 ) with kt@xmath99=0.68 kev and kt@xmath99=0.19 kev and n@xmath100=0.5@xmath23 @xmath11 . figure  [ spec.model1 ] shows the binned data and models spectrum ( upper panel ) along with residuals from the best - fit model ( lower panel ) .",
    "by contrast , a single - temperature , single - component , solar - abundance thermal plasma models ( model 2 ) produces a poor fit to the data ( red .",
    "@xmath67=2.25 ) for kt=0.63 kev and n@xmath100=0.23@xmath23 @xmath11 . allowing the metallicity to vary in the single component model ( model 3 ) produced a much better fit ( red .",
    "@xmath67=1.15 ) for kt=0.63 kev and n@xmath100=0.23@xmath23 @xmath11 and @xmath8/h=0.14 ( i.e. , z@xmath70.14 z@xmath3 ) .",
    "however , we reject such a low metallicity as unphysical given the near - solar abundance of the warm ionized medium @xcite .",
    "finally , we note that other starburst galaxies show evidence for enhanced ratios of @xmath8 to iron - group elements @xcite , so we tried a single - component thermal plasma model where the abundances of @xmath8 and fe - peak elements were allowed to vary . the @xmath8 group elements ( c , o ,",
    "ne , mg , si , s , ar , ca ) are tied and allowed to vary independently from the fe - group elements ( n , al , fe , ni for these purposes ) . this model ( model 4 )",
    "shows an improved fit ( red .",
    "@xmath67=0.95 ) over models 2 and 3 , having @xmath8/h=0.78 , @xmath101=2.7 , kt=0.64 kev , and n@xmath100=0.1@xmath23 @xmath11 . these parameters are in good agreement with the previous analyses by @xcite . both models 1 and 4",
    "provide good fits to the data and are consistent with expectations that 1 ) @xmath8/fe ratios are enhanced in starburst galaxies , and 2 ) the hot interstellar medium has a range of temperatures , often parameterized as hot and cool x - ray components . constraining the absolute metallicity of the hot gas in he  2 - 10 is not possible with these data because of the degeneracy between metallicity and the normalization ( i.e. , @xmath102 ) of the x - ray component .    in an attempt to identify spatial variations in the x - ray spectral properties , we extracted spectra using four fan - shaped apertures centered just outside the nucleus and extending 40  to the north , south , east , and west , similar to the apertures of @xcite .",
    "all of these apertures exhibited similar spectral characteristics , with the best fit models showing the same anti - correlation between best fitting plasma temperature and absorbing column density .",
    "in general , we found that the highest absorbing column densities are located in the east quadrant , but the limited number of photons in each spectrum precludes statistically significant conclusions regarding spatial variations in the diffuse x - ray medium . on the basis of the color differences in figure  [ 3colorx ] , we extracted a spectrum of predominantly red ( soft x - ray ) regions ( small fan - shaped regions n and s of the nucleus ) and compared the best fit parameters to those for a spectrum of the predominately green ( harder x - ray ) regions .",
    "once again , the small number of photons , particularly in the red regions of softest x - ray emission , do not constrain the physical properties of this gas sufficiently well to distinguish differences from the predominately green spatial regions .",
    "regardless of whether an outflow occurring in henize  2 - 10 escapes from the dark matter halo , it is instructive to consider whether the supernovae in the current burst can drive it .",
    "the @xmath15 luminosity of henize  2 - 10 , measured by @xcite is @xmath16 erg  s@xmath1 ( uncorrected for extinction ) , leading to an implied current star formation rate of at least 1.8 m@xmath3yr@xmath1 @xcite . for a @xcite initial mass function with slope @xmath103 between 0.1",
    "m@xmath3  and 100 m@xmath3 , the number of potential supernovae generated from an instantaneous burst producing @xmath104 m@xmath3  of stars is about 15000 if all stars over 8 m@xmath3  end as supernovae .",
    "this is consistent with the 3750 snrs already present , estimated independently from the nonthermal radio continuum by @xcite or the 5000 snrs estimated by @xcite .",
    "the implied current sn rate is one every 250 yrs .",
    "the supernova rate is equivalent to a mechanical energy injection rate varying from few@xmath1710@xmath105 to 10@xmath106 erg  s@xmath1 over the first 10@xmath107 yr , using the online instantaneous burst models of @xcite .",
    "the total mechanical energy produced over this period would be 10@xmath108 erg . for continuous star formation models at a rate of 2 m@xmath3  yr@xmath1",
    ", the steady state mechanical energy injection rate is @xmath93@xmath1710@xmath106 erg  s@xmath1 or about 5@xmath109  erg over the last 10 myr .",
    "these should be regarded as a lower limits , as the mid - ir measurement of the sf rate is nearly 7 m@xmath3  yr@xmath1 .",
    "however , this rate is unsustainable for any extended duration in such a small galaxy . at this rate all molecular gas in the galaxy",
    "would be consumed in 40 myr .",
    "we have estimated the mechanical energy contained in the three h@xmath8 shells observed to the ne and sw of the nucleus , adopting the @xcite ( projected ) expansion speeds of 60 to @xmath9300 .",
    "these shells have a combined h@xmath8 luminosity of @xmath91@xmath110 erg  s@xmath1 based on the fluxes measured on the h@xmath8 images of @xcite , scaled to 9.8 mpc . for an assumed density of @xmath111=100  @xmath112 and temperature of 10@xmath113  k ,",
    "the case b h@xmath8 recombination coefficients and emissivities power of @xcite lead to a shell mass of 3.5@xmath114  m@xmath3 , given a correction factor of 1.4 for helium .",
    "this implies a shell kinetic energy of @xmath115 = 1.26@xmath116 ^ 2 $ ] erg , where @xmath117 is the expansion speed in units of 60 . for a bubble expansion speed of 300 , this implies a maximum kinetic energy of 3.1@xmath118 erg .",
    "such kinetic energies would be easily achieved given the magnitude of the star formation burst estimated above .",
    "additional thermal energy , @xmath119 , contained in the plasma can be estimated by adopting a volume for the hot gas ( 29 kpc@xmath120 ) , a mean density ( 0.01 @xmath112 derived via the x - ray model normalization ) , and a mean energy per particle ( 0.7 kev ) . in this manner we find e@xmath121=4@xmath122  erg , i.e. , a large fraction ( up to 50% ) of the total energy estimated to have been generated in the recent burst of star formation , if the lower limit of 2 m@xmath3  yr@xmath1 is adopted as an average sf rate .",
    "adopting the larger ir - based sfr leads to a thermal energy reservoir that is @xmath915% of the total energy generated by recent star formation .",
    "the poorly resolved rotation curve , ambiguous morphology , and unconstrained inclination of the in henize  2 - 10 preclude a precise estimate of the escape velocity . using the 21-cm l - v diagram from @xcite",
    ", we estimate a dynamical mass of @xmath123/sin@xmath18i m@xmath3  within a radius of 2100 pc , or a halo mass of @xmath124 m@xmath3 for intermediate inclination , @xmath125 degrees .",
    "following @xcite , we approximate the dark matter halo with a modified isothermal sphere .",
    "the halo scale radius is @xmath126  kpc . in this model ,",
    "the escape velocity at 1.2  kpc is @xmath127 .",
    "only the highest - velocity component of the interstellar absorption trough @xcite reveals low - ionization gas exceeding this escape velocity .",
    "the location of this material along the line - of - sight is unconstrained , but even if it resides at 2.1  kpc or more , this component represents a small fraction of the interstellar gas mass .",
    "the @xmath15 velocities @xcite also reveal low - ionization gas at speeds exceeding the escape velocity , but these high speeds are measured about 0.6  kpc east of knot a. while some loss of low - ionization material appears likely , we find no direct evidence that the bulk of the interstellar gas will escape from henize  2 - 10 .",
    "this is consistent with the conclusions of @xcite who found that starbursts were efficient at expelling metals but not the cool ism .",
    "if the hotter plasma component , 0.60.8 kev in table  [ spectra.tab ] , represents the post - shock emission from an even hotter wind , then that wind has a velocity in the 790 to 900  range .",
    "since we detect the shock emission out to 2.1  kpc , then this wind material appears likely to escape the dark halo .",
    "this finding suggests a high fraction of the metal yield from the starburst is ejected .",
    "that henize  2 - 10 harbors a galactic wind is not surprising considering the very high intensity of star formation ; the areal star formation rate exceeds 2 m@xmath3  yr@xmath1  kpc@xmath19 , which is well above the threshold suggested for winds @xcite , and may be as much as a factor of three higher , allowing for extinction .",
    "x - ray imaging of henize  2 - 10 has revealed a nuclear x - ray source with a probable luminosity exceeding @xmath128 erg s@xmath1 , suggesting the presence of an accreting black hole hole within the central 1(50 pc ) with a mass of @xmath129 m@xmath3 .",
    "this source is coincident with a compact non - thermal radio source that , based on its non - detection in milliarcsec vlba data , may be extended over scales of a few tens of pc .",
    "the angular size , luminosity , and ratio of radio to x - ray fluxes are consistent with properties of ulx sources and low - luminosity agn in other galaxies .",
    "we identify 33 compact x - ray sources in the _ chandra _ field .",
    "seven of these appear to be associated with he2 - 10 and may be luminous x - ray binaries ( 23 ) or peaks in the diffuse emission ( 4 ) .",
    "seven additional sources are likely to be foreground galactic stars while eighteen sources are probable background agn",
    ". these latter objects may constitute good probes of the ism in and around he  2 - 10 if their uv fluxes are sufficiently large for studies with the _ hubble space telescope cosmic origins spectrograph_.    diffuse x - ray emission from henize  2 - 10 accounts for 84% of the x - ray photons in the 0.36.0 kev bandpass , and 98% of the photons at intermediate energies ( 0.71.1 kev ) .",
    "the unabsorbed 0.36.0  kev x - ray luminosity of the diffuse ism component is @xmath130 erg s@xmath1 for the adopted distance of 9.8 mpc .",
    "although the data are insufficient to place strong constraints on the chemical properties , the x - ray spectrum is well fit by either a solar - composition two - temperature plasma with kt@xmath99=0.69 kev and kt@xmath25=0.19 kev or a single temperature plasma with @xmath8/fe ratios enhanced to @xmath92.7 times the solar value . both interpretations have precedents in studies of other starburst galaxies .",
    "we compare , for the first time , the distributions of the cold molecular , warm atomic , warm ionized , and hot coronal medium in he  2 - 10 . the x - ray and h@xmath8 emission",
    "follow a very similar radial surface brightness profile out to 30  ( 1.5 kpc ) . while both components extend far above and below the nuclear molecular `` disk '' , neither is detected at radii beyond the 8@xmath10 @xmath11 contour . unlike larger starburst spiral galaxies , no prominent outflow cones or extra - planar bubbles are observed beyond the neutral gas layer . to the surface brightness levels currently probed by x - ray and h@xmath8 observations ,",
    "the warm ionized and hot components lie well within the projected envelope .",
    "the absence of any systematic compilation of x - ray and distributions in dwarf galaxies makes it unclear whether he  2 - 10 is anomalous in this regard .",
    "evidence for high - velocity outflows in low - ionization tracers is tenuous , suggesting that it is unlikely that large fraction of the neutral gas is presently being removed from the galaxy .",
    "however , the energy of the hot x - ray medium is e@xmath121=4@xmath122  erg .",
    "this constitutes a significant fraction of the energy estimated to have been generated in the recent starburst and a reservoir for the continuing development of a global wind .",
    "the high areal density of star formation can be reconciled with the lack of prominent outflow signatures if henize 2 - 10 is in the very early stages of developing a galactic wind .",

    "<S> _ chandra x - ray observatory _ imaging spectroscopy of the starburst galaxy henize  2 - 10 reveals a strong nuclear point source and at least two fainter compact sources embedded within a more luminous diffuse thermal component . </S>",
    "<S> spectral fits to the nuclear x - ray source imply an unabsorbed x - ray luminosity @xmath0 erg  s@xmath1 for reasonable power law or blackbody models , consistent with accretion onto a @xmath250 m@xmath3  black hole behind a foreground absorbing column of @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> two of these point sources have @xmath5 erg s@xmath1 , comparable to luminous x - ray binaries . </S>",
    "<S> these compact sources constitute a small fraction ( @xmath616% ) of the total x - ray flux from he  2 - 10 in the 0.36.0 kev band and just 31% of the x - rays in the hard 1.16.0 kev band which is dominated by diffuse emission . </S>",
    "<S> two - temperature solar - composition plasmas ( kt@xmath70.2 kev and kt@xmath70.7 kev ) fit the diffuse x - ray component as well as single - temperature plasmas with enhanced @xmath8/fe ratios . since the observed radial gradient of the x - ray surface brightness closely follows that of the h@xmath8 emission , the composition of the x - ray plasma likely reflects mixing of the ambient cool / warm ism with an even hotter , low emission measure plasma , thereby explaining the @xmath9solar ism composition . </S>",
    "<S> aperture synthesis 21-cm maps show an extended neutral medium to radii of 60  so that the warm and hot phases of the ism , which extend to @xmath930 , are enveloped within the 8@xmath10 @xmath11 contour of the cool neutral medium . </S>",
    "<S> this extended neutral halo may serve to inhibit a starburst - driven outflow unless it is predominantly along the line of sight . </S>",
    "<S> the high areal density of star formation can also be reconciled with the lack of prominent outflow signatures if henize 2 - 10 is in the very early stages of developing a galactic wind . </S>"
