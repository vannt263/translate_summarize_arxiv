    "lepton flavour violation ( lfv)is an important signature into physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) . in the sm with massive neutrinos , neutrinos have the yukawa interaction .",
    "lepton flavour is violated like quark flavour . however , lfv is strongly suppressed by the neutrino masses .",
    "supersymmetry ( susy ) with massive neutrinos makes the situation drastically changed .",
    "it can predict sizable lfv effects , because the alternative source of lfv is generated from the slepton mixing through the renormalization group effect on the right - handed neutrino yukawa interaction .",
    "the lfv processes @xmath1 of charged lepton are being measured .",
    "the meg experiment @xcite gives the upper bound on the @xmath2 process as @xmath3 the forthcoming experiment reaches to @xmath4 .",
    "the @xmath5 decay processes are also measured at b - factories @xcite . on the other hand , it has been already discovered that lepton flavour is violated in the neutrino sector .",
    "the oscillation parameters will be measured in detail .    in this letter",
    ", we study the phase of the neutrino yukawa matrix and investigate its effect on the magnitude of the lfv processes .",
    "in the framework based on the see - saw mechanism , we can parameterize the neutrino yukawa matrix @xmath6 in terms of physical quantities as @xcite @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the vacuum expectation value of the higgs boson , @xmath9 is the observed maki - nakagawa - sakata ( mns ) matrix including two majorana phases @xmath10 ; i.e. , @xmath11 here we neglect the @xmath12 element of @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath13 is the neutrino mass matrix and @xmath14 is the right - handed majorana neutrino mass matrix in each diagonal base .",
    "an arbitrary complex orthogonal matrix @xmath15 is expressed as @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 the elements @xmath19 give a drastic effect on structure of the yukawa matrix as hyperbolic functions .",
    "we call @xmath20 as _ r - phase _ to distinguish it from the majorana phase",
    ".    in the following , we assume that the neutrino masses are _ approximately _ degenerate and the right - handed neutrino masses are degenerate @xmath21 where , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the solar and atmospheric neutrino mass squared differences , @xmath24 is the size of right - handed neutrinos , and @xmath25 is undetermined light neutrino mass parameter . we then obtain the neutrino yukawa matrix @xmath6 in its diagonal base as @xmath26 where @xmath27 this expression indicates the characteristic relation @xmath28 among the neutrino yukawa couplings , which is similar to those of the quarks and the charged leptons @xmath29 . for @xmath30 and @xmath31 , @xmath32 is close to @xmath33 , so that the neutrino yukawa couplings become hierarchical .",
    "the parameter @xmath32 is written in terms of the combination of _ r - phase _",
    "( see eqs.([r1 ] ) and ( [ r2 ] ) ) , and it determines the size of the neutrino yukawa hierarchy .",
    "we consider the susy models , especially the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) with right - handed neutrinos . in the slepton sector",
    ", the mssm lagrangian has an alternative source of lfv through the following soft susy breaking terms , @xmath34 where @xmath35 are the slepton tri - linear couplings and @xmath36 are the soft mass parameters for the sleptons .",
    "we assume that these couplings are universal at the grand unified theory ( gut ) scale ( @xmath37 ) , i.e. , @xmath38 in this framework , the lfv processes @xmath1 can appear due to the slepton mixing @xcite , which comes from the renormalization group effect on @xmath6 between the scales of @xmath37 and @xmath24 @xmath39 the branching ratios for these processes are expressed by @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the typical susy scale , @xmath42 is the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of higgs bosons , @xmath43 is the fine structure constant , and @xmath44 is fermi constant .",
    "let us consider the @xmath32 dependence of lfv with @xmath45 , the effect of _ r - phase _ contributes to only @xmath2 process .",

    "we have analyzed the structure of the neutrino yukawa matrix and have discussed the magnitude of lfv processes from the phase effect on the neutrino yukawa matrix in the mssm with the right - handed neutrinos .",
    "the neutrino yukawa matrix has two types of phases , majorana phases and _ r - phases_. in the case that neutrino masses are degenerate and the right - handed neutrino masses are degenerate , the eigenvalues of the neutrino yukawa matrix become hierarchical spectrum and the _ r - phases _ determine the size of yukawa hierarchy .    in the susy models ,",
