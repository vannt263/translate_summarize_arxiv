    "numerous x - ray pulsars have been found in the magellanic clouds , many of which are associated with binary systems containing a be star and a neutron star ( e.g. yokogawa et al .",
    "2000 , yokogawa et al .",
    "2003 , haberl & sasaki 2000 , and references therein ) . corbet ( 1984 ) presented evidence that a relationship exists between the neutron star spin period and the orbital period in these systems .",
    "this was further substantiated by waters & van kerkwijk ( 1989 ) who explained the correlation in terms of the equilibrium spin period of the pulsar as a result of the slow equatorial winds from the be star .",
    "subsequent data have further strengthened this spin / orbit correlation ( e.g. see fig .  6 by int zand et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "asca observations by yokogawa et al .",
    "( 2000 ) showed that ax  j0049.4@xmath07323 has an unusually long pulse period ( 755.5 s ) , making it the slowest known rotator among the x - ray pulsars in the smc .",
    "hence , one expects that the system to have a long orbital period , based on corbet s results from other be / neutron star systems .",
    "using photometric data from the macho and ogle - ii projects , we have identified what we believe to be the orbital period of @xmath2394 days for ax  j0049.4@xmath07323 , based on recurrent optical outbursts .    from optical observations , edge & coe ( 2003 )",
    "identified ax  j0049.4@xmath07323 with a be star which showed a double peaked h@xmath3 emission profile at the time of their observations .",
    "they give the magnitude and color of the system as @xmath4=14.99 and @xmath5=0.05 , but they did not address the question of the orbital period or light variability .",
    "using macho and ogle - ii data we have investigated the light curve of this be star and found what we propose to be the orbital period as well as quasi - periodic variability between outbursts .",
    "the interactive macho project light curve browser was used to extract instrumental magnitudes for ax  j0049.4@xmath07323 .",
    "data on this system are available for @xmath27.4 years from mjd 48855 through mjd 51546 .",
    "the macho website displays light curves called  blue \" and  red , \" but after using of the transformation equations given by alcock et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , the colors are close to @xmath4 and @xmath6 , respectively . here",
    ", we refer to these bands as @xmath7 and @xmath8 , as we have done in previous papers using macho data .",
    "@xmath9 magnitudes for this system are also available in the ogle - ii databaseogle / dia/ ] where this object is designated as ogle004942.00@xmath0732314.2 in the  difference image analysis \" of smc variable stars . @xmath9",
    "magnitudes are given for dates from 1997 january through 2000 july ( mjd 50466  51756 ) , with the data partially overlapping in time the last portion of the macho observations .",
    "in figure 1 we plot the macho and ogle - ii light curves for ax  j0049.4@xmath07323 in @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 .",
    "it is clear , especially in the @xmath8 data , that outbursts up to @xmath20.3 mag occur regularly .",
    "the outbursts have been labeled a through f , so that it is possible to refer to them in the text .",
    "the amplitude of the outbursts varies , and since their duration is short , not all outbursts have necessarily been observed at maximum light . in the ogle - ii data , only the last three outbursts were covered , and outburst d was first observed after its start in the other two colors , so its time of maximum is not well determined .",
    "figure 2 displays an expanded light curve of outburst f in @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and the color curve , @xmath10 . in all colors",
    "the outburst shows a rapid rise and a more gradual decline . the amplitude is greater at longer wavelengths , implying the system as a whole reddens during the outburst , as is shown in the bottom panel of this figure . in figure 3 we plot",
    "@xmath8 light curves and @xmath10 color curves for outbursts b through e. one can see that both the amplitude and duration of the outbursts vary . during most outbursts",
    "the color of the system reddens slightly , suggesting that the brightened region was cooler than the be star itself .",
    "typically , the equatorial disks surrounding be stars are cooler than the stars themselves ( mcgowan & charles 2002 ) , so we expect that a region in the disk has brightened .",
    "using the macho data for outbursts c through f , we find the recurrence time to be 394.3@xmath112.3 days .",
    "outburst a is questionable , since it was only observed by a single point in @xmath8 ( with a large error ) and missed in @xmath7 .",
    "using outbursts a through f in @xmath8 , we find a period of 393.0 days .",
    "similarly , from @xmath7 data for outbursts b through f we derive a period of 394.5 days .",
    "we adopt 394 days as a mean period , noting that for some outbursts the time of peak brightness was not well determined .",
    "the ogle - ii data are in good agreement with this value , even though only one outburst ( f ) was fully observed .",
    "the regularity of these outbursts suggests that this 394-day period is likely to be the orbital period of ax  j0049.4@xmath07323 . placing this system on the  corbet diagram \" ( pulse period vs.  orbital period ) given in fig.6 by int zand et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , we see a very good fit at the extreme upper end of the relationship for be - star x - ray systems . hence , 394 days is very likely the orbital period .",
    "since these systems typically have eccentric orbits , a possible interpretation is that the outbursts occur when the neutron star enters the extended equatorial disk ( at or near periastron passage ) surrounding the be star .",
    "variations in the amplitude and onset of the outbursts may depend on the density and extent of the disk at the time the neutron star plunges into the disk .",
    "similar outburst behavior is already known in several other be / neutron star binaries .",
    "the most noted case is a0538@xmath066 in the lmc , whose orbital eccentricity in its 16.6-day period is estimated to be @xmath12 ( e.g. charles et al .",
    "1983 , hutchings et al .",
    "1985 ) . during periastron passage",
    ", this system brightens by as much as 2 mag , although there is considerable variation in amplitude of the outbursts ( e.g. alcock et al .",
    "several other be / neutron star binaries are known to show smaller periodic outbursts which are thought to occur near periastron , although there have been no direct measurements of their orbital eccentricities .",
    "these include rx  j0520.5@xmath06921 ( coe et al .",
    "2001 ) and rx  j0058.2@xmath07231 ( schmidtke et al . 2003 ) , with orbital periods near 24 and 60 days , respectively .",
    "both show outburst amplitudes of @xmath20.05 mag as well as reddening of the system during the outburst , as is seen here for ax  j0049.4@xmath07323 .",
    "in addition to the regular outburst cycle , we have examined the photometry between outbursts to see if there was any periodic behavior .",
    "we first looked at segment 3 which shows a relatively constant mean magnitude ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "we pre - whitened the data by subtracting a linear trend to produce residuals designated as @xmath13 . using the method described by horne & baliunas ( 1986 )",
    ", we carried out an analysis of the power spectrum over a large range of frequencies .",
    "there is a relatively strong signal at p=10.69 days ( labeled ` f ' ) and a weaker one at its alias periods , 1.1 days ( labeled ` 1@xmath0f ' ) . a similar analysis of @xmath7 data for the same time span yields a primary period at 10.61 days .",
    "both colors show a sinusoidal light curve with a full amplitude of @xmath20.03 mag during this segment .",
    "we then analyzed the other numbered segments in all available colors .",
    "each segment was detrended using either a linear or quadratic fit prior to calculating the periodograms .",
    "strong peaks are present in the periodograms for segments 2 , 4 , and 5 , with mean periods of 10.89 , 10.86 , and 11.35 days , respectively .",
    "the power spectra for segments 2  5 are shown in the bottom panel of figure 4 .",
    "one can see that the periods with the most power in segments 2 and 4 differ from those found for segments 3 and 5 . even for segment 1 , which shows an overall downward trend in brightness",
    ", there is a weak peak at 10.37 days in the @xmath13 data .",
    "segment 6 , which is only well represented in @xmath9 , shows a peak at 11.42 days .    in figure 5",
    "we plot the phased @xmath13 light curves for segments 2 and 3 , folded on their individual 11-day periods . although the amplitude of the folded curves varies substantially between segments , there is no dependence on either period or mean brightness .",
    "we also searched for coherent changes in @xmath10 color at periods similar to those present in the individual bandpasses , but found none . except for the reddening during outbursts , the system s color remained remarkably constant after mjd 49600 .",
    "the mean value ranged from @xmath10 = 0.14@xmath110.03 in segment 2 to 0.15@xmath110.03 in segment 4 . prior to mjd 49600 , however , small changes in color were observed .",
    "the system was bluest at the beginning of the macho observing , with @xmath14 , and then reddened slightly to @xmath15 during the shallow dip that preceded outburst a ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "there is no unique short period which fits all segments simultaneously .",
    "it appears that each segment has a quasi - periodicity near 11 days .",
    "since it is likely that the 394-day outbursts are due to some disturbance in the equatorial disk during each orbit , then how would this be manifest after the outburst ?",
    "we note that @xmath211 days is about the timescale for the rotation of the outer portion of a 10r@xmath16 disk .",
    "hence , the period found following an outburst may be due to the rotation of the excited region where the neutron star penetrated the disk and our changing view of it .",
    "variations of @xmath25% in the disk radius , and hence its outer rotation period , could easily be expected .",
    "longer periods would indicate a greater equatorial disk radius .    because the macho data are taken at approximately one day intervals , we can not rule out that the true periodicity is at the shorter , alias period near 1.1 days ( labeled ` 1@xmath0f ' in figure 4 ) ) .",
    "percy et al .  (",
    "2002 ) have shown that some be stars exhibit low - amplitude variations with timescales of the order of 0.3 to 2 days due to nonradial pulsations or rotation .",
    "however , this alternate interpretation seems unlikely since such a period would not be expected to vary substantially from one segment to another .",
    "it is more reasonable to associate variations in the periodicity with changes in the disk , and hence the @xmath211-day period is the primary one .",
    "we have shown that ax  j0049.4@xmath07323 exhibits small , recurrent optical outbursts with a period of @xmath2394 days .",
    "this period is identified with the orbital period of the system and may be caused by the interaction of the neutron star with the equatorial disk of the be star during periastron passage . during the outbursts , the system s color becomes redder , consistent with a brightening in the disk .",
    "in addition , between outbursts the system displays color - independent , quasi - periodic variability , with a timescale of @xmath211 days .",
    "we tentatively suggest that this behavior may result from the observer s changing view of the disturbed region in the equatorial disk as it rotates around the be star ."
