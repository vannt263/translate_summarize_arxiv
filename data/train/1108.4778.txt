    "the significant suggestion , that not only low values of @xmath9 should be considered , are the results obtained for calcium under pressure at @xmath67 gpa , where @xmath68 has been noted @xcite .    in",

    "for the higher values of the frequency ( @xmath101 mev ) one can observe the maximum of re[@xmath100 ] , which is induced by the area of the characteristic peaks in the eliashberg function .",

    "for the frequencies higher than @xmath104 mev , the real part of the order parameter decreases together with the growth of @xmath103 due to the drop of the eliashberg function s value . in the last step",
