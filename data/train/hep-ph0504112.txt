    "the description of baryons within the constituent quark models is a very important problem in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "since the baryon is a three - body system , its theory is much more complicated compared to the two - body meson system .",
    "the quark - diquark picture of a baryon @xcite is the popular approximation widely used to describe the baryon properties @xcite .",
    "the methods of heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) proved to be very fruitful in predicting the properties of the heavy - light @xmath5 mesons ( @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) .",
    "this success suggests to apply these methods to heavy - light baryons . in our paper",
    "@xcite we considered the simplest baryonic systems of this kind , the doubly heavy baryons ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "the two heavy quarks ( @xmath3 or @xmath4 ) compose in this case a bound diquark system in the antitriplet colour state which serves as a localized colour source .",
    "the light quark is orbiting around it and the resulting effective two - body system strongly resembles the heavy - light @xmath6 and @xmath7 mesons .",
    "the main distinction is that the quark - diquark interaction is not point - like due to the heavy - diquark form factor @xcite .",
    "the heavy - quark expansion in @xmath9 can be used here , and the light quark is treated fully relativistically .",
    "the experience acquired in the investigation of doubly - heavy baryons and the recent success in the relativistic description of light mesons @xcite made it possible to study the baryons with one heavy quark ( @xmath3 or @xmath4 ) , too . in this case",
    "we assume that the heavy - quark  light - diquark configuration dominates .",
    "thus the three - body problem is again reduced to the two - body one . a crucial assumption of this quark - diquark picture consists in neglecting the influence of the third quark on the internal diquark dynamics .",
    "in the model with the harmonic - oscillator pair interactions , for instance , this effect increases the interaction strength by a factor 3/2 , and thus a significant increase by a factor @xmath10 of the internal excitation energies of the diquark is achieved .",
    "it is hoped that for linear confinement and relativistic kinematics this effect would be modified and become smaller , but the answer could come only from a thorough treatment of the relativistic three - body problem and comparison with the quark - diquark approximation . in the considered version of the quark - diquark picture",
    "such influence could be partially reproduced by the account of the heavy - light diquark .",
    "we assume that such contributions are small and thus the heavy quark influence on the diquark dynamics is also small .",
    "such assumption is necessary to preserve the presumed universal nature of the diquark @xcite .",
    "otherwise the diquark properties would be very different in such hadronic systems as baryons , tetraquarks , pentaquarks , etc .",
    "unfortunately , the @xmath9 expansion can not be reliably applied for the @xmath4 quark since its mass proves to be comparable with the mass of the light diquark .",
    "so we use instead the @xmath2 expansion for the heavy quark and a completely relativistic description for the light quarks .",
    "fortunately , our predictions can be compared with the rather large amount of experimental data for the ground state baryons with one heavy quark ( mainly the @xmath4 ) .",
    "in the quasipotential approach and quark - diquark picture of heavy baryons the interaction of two light quarks in a diquark and the heavy quark interaction with a light diquark in a baryon are described by the diquark wave function ( @xmath11 ) of the bound quark - quark state and by the baryon wave function ( @xmath12 ) of the bound quark - diquark state respectively , which satisfy the quasipotential equation @xcite of the schrdinger type @xcite @xmath13 where the relativistic reduced mass is @xmath14 and @xmath15 , @xmath16 are given by @xmath17 here @xmath18 is the bound state mass ( diquark or baryon ) , @xmath19 are the masses of light quarks ( @xmath20 and @xmath21 ) which form the diquark or of the light diquark ( @xmath22 ) and heavy quark ( @xmath23 ) which form the heavy baryon ( @xmath6 ) , and @xmath24 is their relative momentum . in the center of mass system",
    "the relative momentum squared on mass shell reads @xmath25[m^2-(m_1-m_2)^2]}{4m^2}.\\ ] ]    the kernel @xmath26 in eq .",
    "( [ quas ] ) is the quasipotential operator of the quark - quark or quark - diquark interaction .",
    "it is constructed with the help of the off - mass - shell scattering amplitude , projected onto the positive energy states . in the following analysis",
    "we closely follow the similar construction of the quark - antiquark interaction in mesons which were extensively studied in our relativistic quark model @xcite .",
    "for the quark - quark interaction in a diquark we use the relation @xmath27 arising under the assumption about the octet structure of the interaction from the difference of the @xmath28 and @xmath29 colour states . an important role in this construction",
    "is played by the lorentz - structure of the confining interaction . in our analysis of mesons",
    "while constructing the quasipotential of the quark - antiquark interaction , we adopted that the effective interaction is the sum of the usual one - gluon exchange term with the mixture of long - range vector and scalar linear confining potentials , where the vector confining potential contains the pauli terms .",
    "we use the same conventions for the construction of the quark - quark and quark - diquark interactions in the baryon .",
    "the quasipotential is then defined by @xcite    \\(a ) for the quark - quark ( @xmath28 ) interaction @xmath30 with @xmath31,\\ ] ]    \\(b ) for quark - diquark ( @xmath32 ) interaction @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the qcd coupling constant , @xmath35 is the vertex of the diquark - gluon interaction which is discussed in detail below @xmath36@xmath37 and @xmath38 , @xmath39 @xmath40 $ ] .",
    "@xmath41 is the gluon propagator in the coulomb gauge @xmath42 and @xmath43 ; @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the dirac matrices and spinors @xmath46 with @xmath47 .    the diquark state in the confining part of the quark - diquark quasipotential ( [ dpot ] ) is described by the wave functions @xmath48 where the four vector @xmath49 is the polarization vector of the axial vector diquark with momentum @xmath24 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 is the polarization vector in the diquark rest frame .",
    "the effective long - range vector vertex of the diquark can be presented in the form @xmath52 where @xmath53 . here",
    "the antisymmetric tensor @xmath54 and the axial vector diquark spin @xmath55 is given by @xmath56 .",
    "we choose the total chromomagnetic moment of the axial vector diquark @xmath57 @xcite .",
    "the effective long - range vector vertex of the quark is defined by @xcite @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the pauli interaction constant characterizing the anomalous chromomagnetic moment of quarks . in the configuration space",
    "the vector and scalar confining potentials in the nonrelativistic limit reduce to @xmath60 with @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the mixing coefficient .",
    "the constituent quark masses @xmath63 gev , @xmath64 gev , @xmath65 gev , @xmath66 gev and the parameters of the linear potential @xmath67 gev@xmath68 and @xmath69 gev have the usual values of quark models .",
    "the value of the mixing coefficient of vector and scalar confining potentials @xmath70 has been determined from the consideration of charmonium radiative decays @xcite and the heavy quark expansion @xcite .",
    "finally , the universal pauli interaction constant @xmath71 has been fixed from the analysis of the fine splitting of heavy quarkonia @xmath72- states @xcite . in the literature",
    "it is widely discussed the t  hooft - like interaction between quarks induced by instantons @xcite .",
    "this interaction can be partly described by introducing the quark anomalous chromomagnetic moment having an approximate value @xmath73 ( diakonov @xcite ) .",
    "this value is of the same sign and order of magnitude as the pauli constant @xmath71 in our model .",
    "thus the pauli term incorporates at least some part of the instanton contribution to the @xmath29 interaction .",
    "note that the long - range chromomagnetic contribution to the potential in our model is proportional to @xmath74 and thus vanishes for the chosen value of @xmath71 .",
    "at a first step , we calculate the masses and form factors of the light diquark . as it is well known , the light quarks are highly relativistic , which makes the @xmath2 expansion inapplicable and thus , a completely relativistic treatment is required . to achieve this goal in describing light diquarks",

    "these masses are in good agreement with values found in ref .",

    "it is important to emphasize that , in calculating the heavy baryon masses , we do not use any free adjustable parameters .",
    "indeed , all parameters of the model ( including quark masses and parameters of the quark potential ) have fixed values which were determined from our previous considerations of heavy and light meson properties .",
    "note that the light diquark in our approach is not considered as a point - like object .",
    "instead we use its wave functions to calculate diquark - gluon interaction form factors and , thus , take into account the finite ( and relatively large ) size of the light diquark .",
    "the other important advantage of our model is the completely relativistic treatment of the light quarks in the diquark and the light diquark in the heavy baryon .",
    "we use the @xmath2 expansion only for heavy ( @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) quarks . the overall reasonable agreement of our model predictions given in table  [ tab : bm ] with both available experimental data and the results of significantly distinct theoretical approaches gives further grounds for the heavy - quark  light - diquark picture of heavy baryons .",
