    "in surface design , the user often needs to perform rounding or filleting between two intersecting surfaces .",
    "mathematically , the surface used in making the rounding is defined as the envelope of a family of spheres which are tangent to both surfaces .",
    "this envelope of spheres centered at @xmath1 with radius @xmath2 , where @xmath3 and @xmath2 are rational functions , is called a canal surface with spine curve @xmath4 .",
    "if the radius @xmath2 is constant the surface is called a pipe surface . moreover , if additionally we reduce the dimension ( take @xmath3 in a plane and consider circles instead of spheres ) we obtain the offset to the curve .",
    "canal surfaces are very popular in geometric modelling , as they can be used as a blending surface between two surfaces .",
    "for example , any two circular cones with a common inscribed sphere can be blended by a part of a dupin cyclide bounded by two circles as it was shown by @xcite ( see figure [ fig : cyclide ] ) .",
    "cyclides are envelopes of special quadratic families of spheres . for other examples of blending with canal surfaces we refer to @xcite .",
    "= 3.5 cm    here we study the implicit equation of a canal surface @xmath5 and its implicit degree .",
    "the implicit equation of a canal surface can be obtained after elimination of the family variable @xmath6 from the system of two equations @xmath7 ( here @xmath8 are quadratic in the variables @xmath9 ) , i.e. by taking the resultant with respect to @xmath6 . however , this resultant can have extraneous factors . in the paper",
    "we explain how these factors appear and how we can eliminate them . by using lie and laguerre geometry",

    "it turns out that the variety defined by the system of equations @xmath14 is a dual variety to the curve @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is a curve on the lie quadric determined by the spine curve @xmath17 ( for the explicit definition see formula ( [ bar_e ] ) ) . for the dual variety @xmath18",
    "we define the @xmath0-basis , which consists of two polynomials @xmath19 which are linear in @xmath20 , and of degree @xmath21 in @xmath6 are such that @xmath22 is minimal .",
    "it turns out that the resultant of @xmath23 and @xmath24 with respect to @xmath6 gives the implicit equation of the variety @xmath18 .",
    "there is a simple substitution formula ( see the algorithm at the end of section [ dualvariety ] ) to compute the implicit equation of the canal surface from the implicit equation of the variety @xmath18 .",
    "partial solutions to the problem of finding the implicit equation ( and degree ) for canal surfaces have been given in other papers .",
    "for instance , the degree of offsets to curves is studied in @xcite . in @xcite , there is a degree formula for the implicit equation of a polynomial canal surface .",
    "quadratic canal surfaces ( parametric and implicit representation ) have been studied in @xcite .",
    "we close the introduction by noting that the implicit degree of a canal surface is important for the parametric degree .",
    "our observation is that if the canal surface has the minimal parametrization of bi - degree @xmath25 then its implicit degree is close to @xmath26 . on the minimal bi - degree @xmath25 parametrizations of the canal surface",

    "we develop some algebraic formalism about modules with two quasi - generators .",
    "we define the @xmath0-basis for these modules and present an algorithm for its computation . in the following section , we recall some needed facts about lie and laguerre sphere geometry . then using lie and laguerre geometry we describe the canal surface explicitly",
    "also , we introduce the @xmath27-hypersurface which contains all @xmath28-offsets to the canal surface . using the @xmath0-basis algorithm",
    "we compute the implicit equations of the dual variety @xmath18 , the @xmath27-hypersurface and the canal surface @xmath5 .",
    "next we apply the results of the previous section to the dual variety @xmath18 of the curve and explain how to compute the implicit degree of the @xmath27-hypersurface ( without computation of the implicit equation ) .",

    "@xmath355 is the envelope of the family of spheres in @xmath220 given by the spine curve @xmath17 and @xmath349 is the envelope of the same family of spheres with radii augmented by @xmath28 .",
    "for instance , circular cylinders or circular cones ( call them just _ cones _ ) are envelopes @xmath357 of @xmath321-lines @xmath358 and vice versa . in the literature , the canal surface @xmath5 is usually defined as this envelope @xmath355 .",

    "the main idea to understand and eliminate the extraneous components that appeared in the example is to linearize the equations @xmath363 and @xmath364 by replacing the quadratic term @xmath387 by a new variable @xmath388 ( or more precisely @xmath389 to keep the equations homogeneous ) .",
