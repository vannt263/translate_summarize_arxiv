    "recently , the subject of _ mesoscopic superconductivity _  @xcite has attracted considerable interest , partly due to the possibility to perform experiments in hybrid structures consisting of superconductors and semiconductors where phase - coherence lengths exceed device dimensions  @xcite .",

    "@xcite . speaking in simple terms ,",
    "andreev reflection occurs at the interface between a superconductor  ( s ) and a normal metal  ( n ) when an electron with energy within the superconducting gap is incident on the interface from the n side .",
    "while no states are available in s for the incoming electron , a finite amplitude for pairing with some suitable electron from n is induced by the proximity of s , which allows both electrons to enter s as a cooper pair .",
    "if that happens , n is left with a hole excitation that has the sign of its group velocity , charge , and mass opposite to that of the electron . as incoming electron and andreev - reflected hole",

    "one of the most well - known is perhaps the appearance of phase factors which lead to magnetoconductance oscillations in a variety of mesoscopic systems  @xcite and affect orbital wave functions even in regions where no magnetic field is present  @xcite . if the magnetic field is treated within a quasiclassical approximation which assumes the relevant physical length scale of the system to be much smaller than the cyclotron radius of electrons , the hamiltonian of eq .",

    "<S> the andreev  reflection contribution to the interface conductance is calculated . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of zeeman splitting is most visible as a double  step feature in the conductance through clean interfaces . due to a screening current , conductance steps </S>",
