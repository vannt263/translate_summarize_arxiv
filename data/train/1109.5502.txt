    "the evolution of massive stars is greatly affected by the amount of mass and angular momentum lost during their lifetime .",
    "understanding the mechanisms responsible for these losses is a fundamental goal in stellar astrophysics .",
    "for instance , mass - loss influences the characteristics of the supernova explosion with which a massive star ends its life , as well as the number of potential single - star progenitors of long - duration gamma - ray bursts ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "an important mass - loss mechanism , at least at galactic and magellanic cloud metallicities , is the transfer of momentum from photons to the atmospheric gas through line interactions , initiating and driving an outflow ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the strength of these radiation - driven winds therefore depends on the effective number of absorption lines , in particular near the photospheric flux maximum in the ultraviolet .",
    "it is dominated by the absorption of light through a copious amount of metallic ion lines that are present in this wavelength region . as a consequence , the mass - loss rate ( @xmath3 ) of stars hotter than 25000  k",
    "is predicted to scale with metallicity ( @xmath4 ) as @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that this prediction holds for early - type stars in the galaxy ( @xmath6 ) , large magellanic cloud ( lmc ; @xmath7 ) , and small magellanic cloud ( smc ; @xmath8 ) , yielding the empirical relation @xmath9 .",
    "to date however , no observational constraints exist at sub - smc metallicities .    for galactic stars more luminous than @xmath10 ( i.e. above the humphreys - davidson limit ) , episodic mass loss is expected to occur during the luminous blue variable and/or wolf - rayet phase ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "also , dust / pulsation - driven mass loss takes place in the red supergiant phase of lower luminosity objects ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , if the _ relative _ contribution of line driving remains sizable at all @xmath4 , an important consequence of the theory of radiation - driven winds would be that low - metallicity massive stars loose less mass and angular momentum over their lifetime than their high - metallicity counterparts . at sub - smc metallicities , single stars with a large initial rotational velocity may avoid envelope expansion and the associated efficient transfer of angular momentum from the core to the envelope , thus keeping a rapidly spinning core .",
    "this makes them potential progenitors of long - duration gamma - ray bursts ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in order to observationally constrain stellar and wind parameters at sub - smc metallicities , we have used the x - shooter spectrograph mounted on eso s _ very large telescope _ ( vlt ) ut2 ( * ? ? ? * vernet et al .",
    "2011 , in press ) to secure intermediate - resolution spectra of some of the most massive stars in three nearby dwarf galaxies , ic1613 , wlm and ncg3109 , each having a metallicity of @xmath11 .",
    "the throughput of the instrument , combined with the collecting area of an 8.2 m telescope , allows us , for the first time , to perform a detailed quantitative spectral analysis at a resolution @xmath12-@xmath13 and test the theory of line driving in o - type stars at a sub - smc metallicity ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    with the aid of previous , low - resolution studies @xcite , we selected the six visually brightest o - type stars in these galaxies ( four in ic  1613 , one in both wlm and ngc  3109 ) .",

    "section  [ sec : modeling ] discusses the method of analysis and section  [ sec : results ] presents the results .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : discussion ] , we discuss implications of our findings .",
    "the spectrum of ngc  3109 - 20 has been obtained during a x - shooter gto run on 2010 april 23 , with an exposure time of 5x900s . in a successive gto run from 2010",
    "september 12 to 16 , the stars in ic  1613 and wlm were observed , with an exposure time of 6x900s for all stars .",
    "all observations were obtained in nodding mode with a nod throw of 5 `` , using a slit width of 0.8 '' for the uvb arm ( 300 - 550 nm ) , 0.9 `` for the vis arm ( 550 - 1020 nm ) , and 0.9  for the nir arm ( 1000 - 2500 nm ) , yielding a spectral resolving power of @xmath14=6200 , 8800 and 5600 , respectively .",
    "conditions were clear or photometric with an average seeing below 0.8 '' in the r band .",

    "fundamental properties of the observed stars are listed in table  [ tab : basic ] .",
    "the data have been reduced using the x - shooter pipeline v1.2.2 in physical model mode @xcite .",
    "the nodding mode usually allows for easy nebular subtraction .",
    "however , all sources except wlm - a11 show signs of variable strength of the nebular emission lines over the length of the nod throw , preventing the use of this method . for these stars",
    "the sky subtraction was done by using suitable regions of sky close to the object , resulting in a good nebular correction for all stars except ic  1613-a15 ( see below ) . the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) per resolution element ranges from 32 to 67 in the uvb arm and from 21 to 29 in the vis arm .",
    "the detected flux in the nir part of the spectrum was low ( snr @xmath15 5 ) , so we could not use this part of the spectrum in our analysis .",
    "the nebular emission in ic  1613-a15 varies in radial velocity along the slit , causing residuals in the final spectrum .",
    "the regions affected by these residuals were removed from the final spectrum and not used in the atmosphere fit .",

    "we normalize all @xmath80 values such that the best @xmath81 is equal to 1 , i.e. we assume that deviations of the original best @xmath81 from unity are induced by under- or overestimated errorbars on the normalized flux .",
    "this approach is similar in spirit to using relative weighting in the @xmath80 merit function and to propagating the root - mean - square of the fit to scale the error bars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the uncertainties are obtained by considering the range of models which satisfy @xmath82 .",
    "these errors do not take into account uncertainties in the luminosity .",
    "however , as the mass - loss rate approximately scales with luminosity as @xmath83 , typical uncertainties in @xmath35 do not have a significant impact on our conclusions .",
    "the derived mass - loss rates are represented in the modified wind - momentum vs. luminosity diagram ( wld , figure  [ fig : wld ] ) .",
    "the modified wind momentum is defined as @xmath84 .",
    "this quantity is ideally suited to study the @xmath85 relation because it is almost independent of mass , and @xmath36 and @xmath14 are usually relatively well constrained . as the h@xmath16 recombination line is essentially sensitive to the invariant wind - strength parameter @xmath86 that is inferred from the spectral analysis , @xmath87 ( for given @xmath30 ) scales with @xmath35 , making it less sensitive to uncertainties in the luminosity . as @xmath36 is expected to scale with metallicity ( @xmath88 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the wind - strength parameter @xmath89 is invariant , the derived mass - loss rate is subject to a similar scaling .",
    "this scaling of @xmath3 and @xmath90 has been applied to the values given in table  [ tab : fitting ] .",
    "compared to theoretical expectations ( * ? ? ?",
    "* @xmath91 dashed line in figure  [ fig : wld ] ) , all stars except ic  1613-a13 tend toward a higher than predicted mass - loss rate for their metallicity .",
    "compared to the empirical relations found by @xcite , our values are reminiscent of the values measured for the lmc . for ic",
    "1613-a15 we could only obtain an upper limit due to the nebular contamination , and ic  1613-b11 and c9 could have a low enough mass - loss rate within the errors .",
    "wlm - a11 and ngc  3109 - 20 have a well defined mass - loss rate which is almost an order of magnitude too large for their metallicity .",
    "in addition to random uncertainties , several sources of systematic uncertainties may affect our mass - loss determinations , for instance due to assumptions we have made . here",
    "we discuss potential non - intrinsic causes for the high mass - loss rates that we derive .",
    "the adopted values of the flow acceleration parameter @xmath18 could contribute to the high values of @xmath92 . to fit the line profile , the wind density vs. velocity profile",
    "must be the same , causing a higher value of @xmath18 to give a lower mass - loss rate .",
    "if we underestimated @xmath18 the mass - loss rate will therefore be too high .",
    "however , even for extreme values of @xmath18 , the correction will be at most a factor of two .",
    "the assumption that @xmath38 introduces an uncertainty in @xmath92 , but as errors in the terminal flow velocities are not expected to exceed 20 - 40% @xcite , this effect is even smaller .",
    "another source of uncertainty is the luminosity determination , both through extinction and distance uncertainties .",
    "however , as said before , the wld is not very sensitive to uncertainties in @xmath35 , as an increase in @xmath35 almost linearly increases the value of @xmath92 .",
    "this effect is illustrated by the arrow in figure  [ fig : wld ] , indicating a change of a factor of two in distance .",
    "furthermore , since the extinction towards all galaxies appears very low , and the absolute magnitude of the stars ( table  [ tab : basic ] ) agrees well with the values for their spectral type @xcite , we do not expect a significant error in the luminosity .",
    "an underestimated metallicity could also be part of an explanation for the difference in empirical and predicted mass - loss rates .",
    "however , the various studies mentioned in table  [ tab : basic ] all agree on an oxygen abundance of 10 - 15% solar .",
    "our own determination of the oxygen abundance for ic  1613 and ngc  3109 also agrees with these values .",
    "furthermore , earlier studies on the stellar populations of our target galaxies @xcite derived iron abundances of again 10 - 15% solar .    finally , multiplicity could play a role . since the observed spectroscopic binary fraction in the galaxy is approximately 50% @xcite , it is possible that some of our sources are binaries",
    "binarity can influence the derived mass - loss rate by dilution or wind - wind collisions . in the case of a low - mass companion ,",
    "the normalized spectrum will have shallower lines due to dilution effects .",
    "in close binaries with two massive stars , wind - wind collisions can cause emission in @xmath934686 and h@xmath16 if the wind - collision region is isothermal ( see , for example , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "however , we could not find indications for massive companions in our data , which would cause higher luminosities , nor of radial velocities that differ from those of the parent galaxy .    because of the large distance to the host galaxies , it is possible that our targets are unresolved multiples instead of single stars ( e.g. , hartoog et al .",
    "2012 , in preparation ) . with a seeing of 0.8 \"",
    ", the smallest resolved area covers a distance ranging from 2.8 pc for ic  1613 to 5 pc for ngc  3109 , and can therefore easily harbor a typical open cluster .",
    "however , the observed luminosities are typical of stars of the corresponding spectral type @xcite , and we therefore do not see any strong indications for multiplicity .",
    "there are several physical mechanisms that can increase the mass - loss rate or make it appear higher .",
    "a likely cause is the effect of wind clumping , which we do not take into account in our modeling .",
    "clumping causes mass - loss indicators based on the average squared density @xmath94 , such as h@xmath16 , to have more emission than would be the case in an unclumped wind .",
    "this causes the derived mass - loss rates to be overestimated by a factor of @xmath95 , with @xmath96 the mean value of the volume - filling factor in the line - forming region @xcite",
    ".    however , by comparing our results to the relations found by @xcite , where clumping is also unaccounted for ( causing the empirical mass - loss rate to be higher than the theoretical prediction ) , the rates we find for @xmath97 galaxies coincide with lmc values .",
    "so unless clumping behaves differently at sub - smc metallicities , we would still expect the mass - loss rates to be located below the empirical smc area in the wld .",
    "the slope and absolute scaling of the wld is also anticipated to change at very low metallicities @xcite .",
    "the expected effect , however , works in the opposite direction , and the mass - loss rates should be even lower . furthermore , the slope - change is predicted to occur at a much lower metallicity ( @xmath98 ) .",
    "fast rotation can also cause increased and asymmetric mass - loss ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "however , all of the projected rotational velocities we derive are low ( @xmath99 ) , and given that the probability that by chance all sources have their rotational axis pointed more or less in our direction is small , we do not expect this effect to play a major role in our sample",
    ".    there could be other processes affecting the mass - loss process , possibly related to pulsations and magnetic fields , which both have been detected in o - type stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "pulsations are caused by the high sensitivity of opacity to temperature in the high - temperature low - density regions in o ( super)giants , giving rise to @xmath100-pulsations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this is induced by the sudden appearance of a large number of same - shell transition iron lines , and is therefore dependent on the iron abundance .",
    "thus it is expected that pulsations are less important at low metallicities @xcite .",
    "the increased opacity described above can give rise to small convective regions in the stellar envelope @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that these convective regions can produce magnetic hot spots through the dynamo effect , which can be strong enough to influence the wind and possibly play a role in the wind clumping .",
    "this effect is again metallicity dependent , and is expected to play a lesser role and eventually disappear with decreasing metallicity @xcite .",
    "in this letter , we have pointed out a discrepancy between the observed and predicted mass - loss rates from massive stars in low - metallicity environments , and discussed possible explanations .",
    "a potential violation of the expected metallicity scaling of the radiation - driven mass - loss rate at @xmath101 , resulting in higher than expected mass - loss rates , would have far - reaching implications .",
    "firstly , one expects low-@xmath4 o - type stars to suffer more from spin - down through angular momentum loss in the stellar wind .",
    "consequently , the rotational mixing efficiency may be reduced , leading , for instance , to a more modest nitrogen enrichment than currently thought @xcite .",
    "secondly , one anticipates the single o star population in low metallicity environments to produce more observationally identifiable wolf - rayet stars , being the successors of o - type stars having their outer envelope stripped by mass - loss , and therefore increased number of ib and , potentially , ic supernovae .",
    "the single - star channel would , however , produce less progenitors of long - duration gamma - ray bursts , as the stars loose more angular momentum by their outflow .",
    "finally , if the larger than expected wind strength at @xmath102 persists to extremely low metallicities ( though at present the driving mechanism is unknown ) , stellar winds will impact the evolution of massive population iii stars and the chemical enrichment of the intergalactic medium of the early universe .",

    "<S> we present a spectroscopic analysis of vlt / x - shooter observations of six o - type stars in the low - metallicity ( @xmath0 ) galaxies ic1613 , wlm and ngc3109 . the stellar and wind parameters of these sources allow us , for the first time , to probe the mass - loss versus metallicity dependence of stellar winds below that of the small magellanic cloud ( at @xmath1 ) by means of a modified wind momentum versus luminosity diagram . </S>",
    "<S> the wind strengths that we obtain for the objects in wlm and ngc  3109 are unexpectedly high and do not agree with theoretical predictions . </S>",
    "<S> the objects in ic  1613 tend towards a higher than expected mass - loss rate , but remain consistent with predictions within their error bars . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss potential systematic uncertainties in the mass - loss determinations to explain our results . </S>",
    "<S> however , if further scrutinization of these findings point towards an intrinsic cause for this unexpected sub - smc mass - loss behavior , implications would include a higher than anticipated number of wolf - rayet stars and ib / ic supernovae in low - metallicity environments , but a reduced number of long - duration gamma - ray bursts produced through a single - star evolutionary channel .    </S>",
