    "the unavoidable change of quantum states by a measurement process is one of the main distinguishing features of quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "the acquisition of information about a quantum system through a projective measurement creates a post - measurement state which , when inspected , does not allow one to deduce the state of the system before the measurement .",
    "thus , this class of measurement has a destructive character since all information about the initial state is lost .",
    "however , not all measurement processes lead to a complete loss of information on the initial state @xcite .",
    "the trade - off between the information about a quantum system , obtained by means of a measurement process , and the disturbance induced by this process in the state of the system has been an intensive research subject @xcite . in this context ,",
    "sequential measurements have been recently considered . in such case ,",
    "several measurement processes are carried out consecutively onto the same physical system @xcite . adopting sequential measurements , the existence of an adaptive strategy which optimises the balance between the acquired information and the disturbance induced in the state of the system has been experimentally demonstrated @xcite .    in this work we present motivating fundamental results related with sequential measurements onto a single quantum system .",
    "we experimentally demonstrate that multi - party sequential unambiguous state discrimination ( susd ) is possible @xcite .",
    "the discrimination among nonorthogonal quantum states was first introduced in the context of quantum decision theory @xcite .",
    "the idea is that a party , alice , prepares a quantum system in one of several pre - defined nonorthogonal states .",
    "then , she sends the system to a second party , bob , whose task is to determine what is the state of the system .",
    "several discrimination strategies are possible depending on the constraints imposed .",
    "unambiguous state discrimination ( usd ) is designed upon the requirement of perfect identification of the nonorthogonal states considered @xcite . due to the nonorthogonality",
    ", this requirement can only be achieved probabilistically .",
    "thus , the scheme admits the possibility of an inconclusive event that does not give any information about alice s prepared state .",
    "sequential unambiguous state discrimination arises in a scenario where the states prepared by alice must be unambiguously identified by multiple parties , and without the use of classical communication exchanged between them during the protocol s session . since the process must be carried out without sharing a classical bit of information , each observer has access only to the post - measurement unknown states generated by the previous one . through a sequence of consecutive generalized measurements on the same quantum system",
    ", there is a non - vanishing probability that all receivers simultaneously identify the state prepared by alice .",
    "the process of susd is designed to maximize this probability , and is described as the concatenation of non - optimal usds carried out by the intermediate parties , to an optimal usd implemented by the last party .",
    "+    throughout the development of quantum information theory , the studies of protocols concerning discrimination of non - orthogonal quantum states have shown their close relationship with others such as quantum key distribution ( qkd ) @xcite , entanglement concentration @xcite , quantum cloning @xcite , teleportation @xcite , entanglement swapping @xcite , superdense coding @xcite , and some quantum algorithms @xcite .",
    "thus , our experimental implementation of a susd can be seen as a step towards single - photon multi - party experimental quantum information processing .",
    "moreover , our scheme is based on single - photon polarization qubit states and can be extended to have the parties separated over an optical network @xcite .",
    "now , let us briefly review the susd process between three parties ( named alice , bob and charlie ) @xcite .",
    "alice prepares a quantum system in a state randomly chosen from a set of two equally likely nonorthogonal states defined by @xmath0 .",
    "states @xmath1 and @xmath2 form a two - dimensional orthonormal basis and coefficients @xmath3 and @xmath4 are real and positive numbers such that @xmath5 . without loss of generality , we assume that @xmath6 , so the inner product @xmath7 is real and non - negative .",
    "thereby , coefficients @xmath3 and @xmath4 can be considered as functions of @xmath8 , that is @xmath9 , @xmath10 .",
    "after state preparation alice sends the quantum system acting as an information carrier to bob .",
    "he now implements a non - optimal usd process .",
    "this allows bob to obtain information about the state prepared by alice , while leaving enough information in the post - measurement states such that charlie can also discriminate alice s states .",
    "this happens at the expense of a reduced success probability .",
    "the non - optimal usd performed by bob requires the implementation of a specific generalized quantum measurement . according to the neumark s theorem ,",
    "such measurement can be implemented by resorting to an additional ancillary system , an entangling unitary operation between the ancilla and the system , and finally by a projective measurement over the ancilla hilbert space ( please see the for more details ) . in terms of a bipartite unitary operation between the system and the ancilla , bob s discrimination process",
    "is described as @xmath11 is an arbitrary state representing the initial state of the ancilla and @xmath12 is a two - dimensional orthonormal basis of the ancilla .",
    "the states @xmath13 and @xmath14 are given by @xmath15 $ ] and @xmath16 , respectively .",
    "thus , bob implements a process that transforms the set of nonorthogonal states into orthogonal ones , succeeding with probability @xmath17 .",
    "since the states are now orthogonal , bob can discriminate between them and deduce the state prepared by alice .",
    "otherwise , there exists a probability @xmath18 of obtaining no information .",
    "after the implementation of bob s usd , the particle is sent to charlie who does not know the result of bob s discrimination . in consequence ,",
    "the state of the particle can not depend on the particular outcomes obtained by bob and must be always @xmath14 regardless of his recorded results .",
    "charlie discriminates unambiguously between these two states whose inner product is now @xmath19 , and therefore , less separated than the original states @xmath20 because @xmath21 .",
    "analogously , charlie must set up an operation such that @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the initial state of the ancilla used by charlie .",
    "@xmath24 corresponds to its possible final orthogonal states that inform charlie whether the discrimination has been successfully achieved or not .",
    "charlie s usd must be optimal since no additional parties will handle the system and , therefore , the remaining information must be maximally acquired .",
    "the state of the system in case of an inconclusive event is the same one despite the state alice sent @xcite . as seen from eq .",
    "( [ eq : charlie ] ) , charlie has a @xmath25 probability for succeeding and @xmath18 for failing .",
    "taking into account eq .",
    "( [ eq : bob ] ) , we have that @xmath26 is the probability of both bob and charlie having successfully accomplished their quantum state discrimination , which is the main purpose of this protocol .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( [ eq : psucc ] ) is the upper limit for the joint success probability of the susd protocol @xcite .",
    "in our implementation , the states @xmath20 are encoded in the polarization degree of freedom of a single photon .",
    "figure  [ fig : setup ] illustrates our experimental setup . a 60 mw cw laser at 355 nm",
    "is used to generate twin photons through spontaneous parametric down conversion in a non - linear @xmath27 ( bibo ) crystal . a colored glass filter and an interference filter ( 10 nm bandwidth )",
    "block the pump field and select degenerated down - converted photons at 710 nm .",
    "a heralded single - photon source uses the detection of a down - converted photon to witness the passage of the other twin photon through the experimental scheme .",
    "the latter is sent through a single mode optical fiber ( smf ) to eliminate any spatial correlation between the twin photons , and then through a polarizing beam splitter ( pbs ) for polarization filtering .",
    "this source produces a typical coincident count rate of @xmath28s with an accidental count rate of @xmath29/s .",
    "the counts are recorded by a field programmable gate array coincidence counting unit , with the timing delay adjusted between each detector s output and the heralding trigger signal .",
    "alice prepares one of the states @xmath20 with a single half - wave plate ( hwp ) .",
    "bob s non - optimal usd is implemented by means of an intrinsically stable sagnac interferometer i1 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] ) .",
    "the propagation path of a photon within i1 depends on its polarization state , which allows for conditional polarization transformations implemented with half - wave plates placed inside the interferometer @xcite .",
    "the fast axes of the plates located at the clockwise transmitted mode ( continuous line in i1 ) , and at the counter - clockwise reflected path ( dashed line in i1 ) , were oriented at angles @xmath30 and @xmath31 , respectively .",
    "the upper and lower output ports of the interferometer i1 are associated to a failure or a success of bob s discrimination process , respectively . in such configuration ,",
    "a photon emerging from the upper output port is described by one of the two nonorthogonal states @xmath32 .",
    "a photon emerging from the lower output port is described by one of two orthogonal polarization states @xmath13 .",
    "these states can be deterministically discriminated by splitting them into two new paths using a pbs and a hwp .",
    "since they are univocally related to states @xmath20 , this identifies with certainty the states prepared by alice .",
    "this concludes the generalized measurement of bob implementing the usd process .    before the transmission of the photon to charlie s i3 and i4 interferometers",
    ", bob transforms the post - measurement state @xmath33 to @xmath34 , and @xmath35 to @xmath36 using hwps ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] ) .",
    "thus , the state of the photon sent to charlie is always one of the polarization states @xmath32 , independently of the path followed after bob s discrimination ( in this way , there is no bit of classical communication being shared by them ) .",
    "charlie analyses the polarization state by placing new sagnac interferometers i2 , i3 and i4 at the end of each path leaving bob s measurement .",
    "these three interferometers are similar to bob s one and their settings are chosen to achieve the optimal usd of @xmath32 in charlie s measurement process @xcite . for the optimal usd",
    ", charlie needs to place a hwp in each counter - clockwise mode in the interferometers i2 , i3 , and i4 of fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] . they must be adjusted at an angle given by : @xmath37 .",
    "another hwp oriented at @xmath38 degrees was used in the clockwise mode to balance the interferometers .",
    "note that charlie must adopt three interferometers , as he does not know which path corresponds to a conclusive or inconclusive result of bob s measurement .",
    "last , it is worth mentioning that such setup configuration can find application to multipartite secure quantum communication since , for each trial , bob can guarantee that there is no flow of information - regarding his measurement - to charlie by randomizing at which output path the post - measurement polarization states are sent in .",
    "the same is valid for charlie , who can guarantee the privacy of his measurements by randomizing for each interferometer , the detectors corresponding to the conclusive and inconclusive events .",
    "finally , the photon is measured with silicon avalanche photo - detectors ( apds ) operating in continuous mode , with a detection efficiency of @xmath39 coupled with single - mode fibers ( smfs ) . for each detection event",
    ", the clicking detector is publicly announced . from the detection events",
    ", one can estimate when bob , charlie or both succeed discriminating the state generated by alice .",
    "for instance , consider that the last detector was the one that clicked . based on this publicly announced information , both bob and charlie",
    "get informed that the state prepared by alice was @xmath20 , without the need of using any classical communication exchanged between the three parties .",
    "last , please note that in our implementation bob and charlie do nt need to share one bit of classical information to define how bob s measurement outcomes map to the outcomes of charlie s measurement ( or , alternatively , to the detectors at the public channel ) .",
    "there is a simple strategy that bob can adopt to figure out the mapping .",
    "that is , bob can simply block two of his outputs and note from the detection events publicly announced , which detectors are associated with the unblocked path . the same strategy is also valid for charlie and the public detectors .    .",
    "the continuous line represents the theoretical prediction of eq .",
    "( [ eq : psucc ] ) .",
    "the points with error bars represent the recorded probabilities averaged over @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "the green area represents an error model to show how experimental imperfections can affect @xmath42 in our scheme .",
    "[ fig : total_success],title=\"fig : \" ] +    to experimentally validate our scheme , the susd protocol was implemented considering seven different values for the inner product ( @xmath8 ) of the non - orthogonal states generated by alice . the results when alice sends @xmath41",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : psiminus ] , as an illustrative example of the results recorded .",
    "each plot shows the detection probability @xmath43 , with @xmath44 and @xmath45 , at the output of the @xmath46th interferometer ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] ) .",
    "these probabilities @xmath43 are the observed average values after 45 experimental runs , each consisting of 15 s integration time , for each value of @xmath8 .",
    "the error bars display the standard deviation of each probability considering all experimental runs .",
    "the continuous line represents the theoretically predicted values for each probability as a function of the inner product @xmath8 . a good agreement between the theory and experimental results can be observed . to understand how experimental imperfections can affect our proposed scheme ,",
    "we resorted to an error model based on monte carlo simulations , which is represented by a green area . to account for errors in alice s state preparation procedure we used a measured maximum mismatch of @xmath47 on the half - wave plates .",
    "furthermore we also considered in the model the use of non - ideal pbss , where up to 3% of horizontally ( vertically ) polarized light could be lost while being transmitted ( reflected ) through the pbs , and a mismatch between the output modes of the sagnac - like interferometers of up to 3% .",
    "[ fig : total_success ] shows the recorded joint success probability ( averaged over @xmath40 and @xmath41 ) for each value of @xmath8 .",
    "again , there is a good agreement between theory [ eq .",
    "( [ eq : psucc ] ) ] and the experimental results observed .",
    "here we reported on the implementation of the recently proposed protocol of sequential unambiguous state discrimination aimed at quantum information processing in a multi - party scenario @xcite . in our scheme ,",
    "a single photon is used to distribute the information of a qubit polarization state between three parties : alice , bob and charlie , all connected through a linear optical network .",
    "the scheme relies on the generation of non - orthogonal polarization states by alice , with bob and charlie applying sequential measurements onto the single photon for the unambiguous state discrimination .",
    "our experimental demonstration employs commercially available optical components , opening up a path towards practical applications .",
    "finally , the technology to compensate polarization drifts in long - optical fibers is available @xcite , which opens up the possibility to spatially separate the parties with long - distance optical fiber links .",

    "the unambiguous state discrimination ( usd ) protocol requires the implementation of a generalized quantum measurement over a given physical system and , in accordance with the neumark s theorem , its implementation consists of three basic steps : ( i ) the addition of an ancillary system , ( ii ) a collective or joint unitary transformation between the system and the ancilla , and ( iii ) a projective measurement over the ancilla hilbert space .    to see this ,",
    "please let us consider that the nonorthogonal states to be discriminated @xmath48 are encoded in a system @xmath8 . with the purpose of performing the usd of such states , we must then consider that an extra ancillary system @xmath4 , initially prepared in an arbitrary state @xmath49 , is added to this system .",
    "last , let us assume that the following unitary transformation @xmath50 acting onto system @xmath51 is implemented : @xmath52 then , one can see that this transformation always creates a set of three mutually orthogonal states : the two states @xmath53 and one of the states @xmath54 .",
    "the states @xmath55 and @xmath56 are associated with the successful identification of the nonorthogonal states @xmath57 and @xmath58 , respectively . the states @xmath54 are associated with a failure in the identification process .",
    "since the states @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath54 are mutually orthogonal , they can be perfectly distinguished .",
    "thus , conclusively identifying the two nonorthogonal states .",
    "the three elements of the generalized measurement representing the usd process are , therefore , @xmath59 , where @xmath60 are the kraus operators describing the physical processes performed on the initial state of system @xmath8 .",
    "these operators are given by @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the computational basis for system @xmath8 and @xmath63 is the basis on which the ancillary system @xmath4 is measured .",
    "typical optical implementations of unambiguous state discrimination ( or alternatively , optical implementations of generalized quantum measurements ) , such as the ones adopted by bob and charlie in our work , can be fully accomplished by resorting to different degrees of freedom of a single photon @xcite . to understand it",
    ", please consider that the states @xmath64 and @xmath65 are now the horizontal and vertical polarization states @xmath66 and @xmath67 of a single photon , respectively .",
    "correspondingly , the diagonal polarization states are defined by @xmath68 .    without loss of generality ,",
    "let us now focus on bob s measurement .",
    "note , however , that the same reasoning is valid for charlie s measurement . immediately after the unitary transformation @xmath50 implemented by bob s interferometer",
    ", the state of a single photon is given by @xmath69 where , here , the state @xmath49 represents the propagation path of photons at the input port of bob s interferometer .",
    "the state @xmath70 represents the photons emerging from the lower output port of bob s interferometer ( see ic1 in fig .  1 ) , while state @xmath71 describes photons emerging from the upper output port of bob s interferometer .",
    "thereby , the ancillary degree of freedom employed in our experiment corresponds to the propagation path of the photons .",
    "the identification of the states @xmath72 is then obtained by mapping the polarization states @xmath73 of the photons",
