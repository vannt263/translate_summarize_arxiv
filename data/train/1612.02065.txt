    "the uavs are assumed to have downwards facing visual sensors with a circular sensing footprint , while no assumptions are made about the type of the sensor .",
    "the covered area as well as the coverage quality of that area depend on the altitude of each uav .",
    "a partitioning scheme of the sensed region , similar to  @xcite , is employed and a gradient based control law is developed .",

    "this will lead to a reduction of the node s altitude and in time the node will reach @xmath87 . once the node reaches @xmath10 its altitude control law will be @xmath88 until the integral over @xmath30 stops being zero .",
