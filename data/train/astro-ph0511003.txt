    "dust extinction of sne  ia is of critical importance to supernova cosmology .",
    "new studies show that when correcting the observed @xmath2 magnitudes of sne  ia to the observed @xmath3 colors , the coefficient is generally found to be around 2 - 3 instead of the value of about @xmath4 as expected for dust extinction in the galaxy and the lmc @xcite . this small value had been thought to be likely caused by a combination of intrinsic color dependence of sn luminosity and dust extinction .",
    "some recent works however show that for several well observed highly extinct sne  ia , @xmath5 were found to be in the same low range as deduced from cosmology fits ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) .",
    "these studies seem to suggest that dust in sn hosts are systematically different from those in the galaxy and the lmc . here",
    "i propose an alternative explanation that does not require such a difference .",
    "there might be circumstellar ( cs ) dust around the progenitor systems of sne  ia . in such cases extinction correction",
    "can not be performed by assuming a standard interstellar extinction law , but has to be treated through careful radiative transfer @xcite .",
    "sn  2002ic , as an extreme example , was found to be associated with a massive hydrogen rich material with mass around 6@xmath6 @xcite . @xcite",
    "deduced from spectropolarimetry observations that the hydrogen rich materials are distributed in an asymmetric , perhaps disk - like geometry .",
    "such a massive envelope , if exists in the galaxy , must be easily observable .",
    "it can in fact be identified with well studied post - agb objects such as proto - planetary nebulae ( ppne ) .",
    "the post - agb phase is very short lived , lasting only on the order of a few thousand years .",
    "this explains why sn  2002ic like events are rare but it also raises the question of whether sne  ia can occur in environment in which the surrounding nebulosity is more diluted .",
    "ppne ultimately evolve to planetary nebulae ( pne ) which then disperse into the interstellar medium ( ism ) and leave behind white dwarfs in the center .",
    "a large fraction of white dwarfs inside pne are found to be likely in binary systems @xcite .",
    "the pn phase lasts for about ten to a hundred times longer than the ppn phase . assuming that the explosion of the central white dwarfs are unrelated to the evolution of nebulosity outside , one can expect that there are about 10 times more sne  ia occurring inside pne for every sn  ia occurring inside a ppn .",
    "extinction to the central white dwarfs of several pne were observed by @xcite , and the dust extinction optical depth is typically around 1 .",
    "assuming that there is no dust creation / destruction after the ppn shell ejection and homologous expansion of the nebulae , at any later epochs the dust opacity scales as @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the dynamical age of pne which is typically around 10,000 years .",
    "it thus takes about @xmath9 years for the dust to be diluted to @xmath10 - a level that is still sensitive to modern sne ia observations .",
    "dusts in pne are distributed in patchy opaque clumps such as observed in the helix nebula @xcite .",
    "these dusty clumps may survive even longer time scales . on top of the dust ejected as ppne during the post - agb phase , more dust",
    "may be ejected to the cs environment throughout the evolution path to sne  ia .",
    "this argues that circumstellar dust may be important and has to be analyzed carefully for precision measurements .",
    "the albedo of interstellar dust is around 0.7 in @xmath2 and @xmath11 filters , as was found from observations of reflection nebulae ( see @xcite for a review of interstellar dust properties ) .",
    "this means that scattering dominates the interaction between photons and dust particles .      for illustrative purposes ,",
    "let us consider an invariant point source located inside a optically thin cs shell of optical depth @xmath12 and albedo @xmath13 .",
    "in one extreme case ( case a , hereafter ) we assume that all the scattered photons do not reach the observer , then the attenuation of the source is given by @xmath14 . case a applies to interstellar dust extinction where scattering predominantly direct photons off the line of sights .",
    "if on the other extreme ( case b , hereafter ) we assume that all of the scattered photons eventually escape from the system , the corresponding attenuation will be @xmath15 , where it is also assumed that each photon interacts at most once with the dust shell before escape which is a good approximation if the shell is optically thin .",
    "case b alters the extinction curves of the dust from @xmath16 to @xmath17 .",
    "a complete description of the amount of extinction requires not only the extinction cross section but also the dust albedo . using the interstellar dust model of @xcite for the average properties of lmc dust , the two limiting cases are shown in fig .",
    "1 . the inclusion of scattered photons not only reduces the total extinction but also changes significantly @xmath18 , the ratio of extinction to color - excess .",
    "@xmath1 is significantly reduced at wavelength longer than 300 nm whereas the opposite is true in the wavelength range shorter than 300 nm .",
    "case a is applicable for extinction by interstellar dust .",
    "case b is applicable for extinction by a dust envelopes that can not be spatially resolved from the target , such as compact cs dust of stars or circumnuclear dust in the host galaxies of agns or qsos .",
    "the light curves and spectra of sne evolve with time .",
    "the effective wavelengths in different filters thus vary , and accordingly the amount of extinctions in these filters change with time .",
    "using the dust model of @xcite , and the sn  ia spectral template as described in @xcite , we show in fig .",
    "2(a ) @xmath1 at different epochs for a typical sn  ia .",
    "r@xmath19 show @xmath20 20%  variations .",
    "this effect should be important when using sn  ia for cosmology , but can not explain the observed low @xmath5 for sne  ia .",
    "light reflected off dust particles travels longer distance and arrives at the observer with a time delay .",
    "this is the so called light echo phenomena studied by @xcite , and more recently by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "light echos are observed in several nearby sne such as sn  1987a @xcite , sn  1991 t @xcite , and sn  1998bu @xcite .",
    "the survival of cs dust around sn  1987a was studied by @xcite where it was shown that scattering by circumstellar dust can provide an alternative explanation of early polarimetry of sn  1987a .",
    "@xcite also suggest that dust around sne  ia can be probed by polarimetry observations .",
    "the exact amount of extinction is related to the geometric location of the dust clouds . in fig .",
    "2(b ) and ( c ) we show as an example the results assuming a geometry in which dust coexists with a stellar wind of inner radius 1 10@xmath21 cm .",
    "the optical depth of the dust cloud is assumed to be 1.45 in @xmath2 band which gives @xmath22 .",
    "the effect of multiple scattering is treated approximately using the formula of @xcite . with the extinction cross section as given by @xcite for dust in the lmc , the column density of the dust shell considered here is 10@xmath23 @xmath24 which requires a mass loss rate of @xmath25 .    as shown in fig .",
    "2(b ) , the extinctions in different filters decrease steadily from the time of explosion to about 15 - 20 days after optical maximum .",
    "this is due to an increase of the contributions of scattered photons to the total flux .",
    "the effective extinction is in general smaller than when dust scattering is ignored .",
    "2(c ) shows the effective ratio of extinction to color - excess . to be consistent with sn  ia observations ,",
    "this is defined here as @xmath26 , with @xmath27 , where @xmath28 and @xmath29 with @xmath30 and @xmath31 being the @xmath2 and @xmath11 band maximum magnitudes with no dust extinction , respectively , and @xmath32 and @xmath33 the @xmath2 and @xmath11 band maximum magnitudes with dust extinction , respectively . by comparing fig .",
    "2(a ) and fig .",
    "2(c ) , it is remarkable that the inclusion of dust scattering reduces significantly the values of @xmath1 around optical maximum in the optical wavelength range .",
    "the @xmath2 and @xmath11 band light curves and the color curve @xmath3 are shown in fig .",
    "the presence of dust alters the light curves shapes , results in light curves with steeper rises and flatter decreases .",
    "this affects the measurements of light curve parameters .",
    "it is worth pointing out that the peculiar sn  2000cx showed qualitatively a fast rise and a slow decline in @xmath2 and @xmath11 bands @xcite which is consistent with the above behavior .",
    "we defer quantitative analyses of individual sn to future studies , but note here that the presence of cs dust can be tested on individual basis of well observed sne .",
    "4 shows that scattering has smaller effect around optical maximum for dust wind located at larger distances .",
    "more distant dust clouds , however , do affect later time light curves .",
    "this study shows that the low values of @xmath5 observed sne  ia may be an indication of the presence of dust in the immediate neighborhood of sne  ia .",
    "dust of extinction properties similar to that of the lmc can explain the observed unusually low @xmath5 values for sne  ia , provided that they are distributed in the circumstellar environment of the sne .",
    "although not required by the current analyses , it should be reminded that cs dust may have substantially different extinction properties compared to interstellar dust .",
    "however , the presence of even a small amount of cs dust leaves clear imprints on the light curves of sne  ia and can be tested by careful observations of sn  ia light curves .",
    "high resolution spectroscopy has set some upper limits on the amount of csm around sn  1994d @xcite and sn  2001el @xcite .",
    "the strongest constraint is a mass loss rate of around 10@xmath34 for a wind velocity of 10 km / s derived for sn  2001el 9 days before optical maximum .",
    "note that at this early date , only csm at distances lower than 3 @xmath35 cm are interacting with the sn ejecta , and the observations are not sensitive to csm at even larger distances .",
    "these observations are thus insensitive to nebular structures with a central bubble such as often encountered in pne .    as noticed in @xcite and @xcite , several other sne previously identified as sn  iin are in fact strikingly similar to sn  2002ic at late stages .",
    "these include sn  1988z @xcite , sn  1997cy @xcite , and sn  1999e @xcite .",
    "model spectra of these objects seem to rule out significant amount of oxygen in the ejecta @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggested that the mass of sn  1988z ejecta is unexpectedly low with m @xmath36 .",
    "the low mass ejecta and the absence of oxygen are consistent with sn  ia explosions .",
    "if these are all sn  2002ic - like sne , and taking the number of sn  ia discoveries at their face value , it would imply that about 1%  of all sne  ia are associated with dense nebula similar to sn  2002ic .",
    "there may be a substantial fraction of sne  ia with significant amount of undetected cs materials .",
    "this is corroborated by recent sn  ia rate studies which indicate that about 50%  of the observed sne  ia are produced by progenitors probably more massive than 5.5 m@xmath37 , in a time scale of the order of 10@xmath38 years after the progenitor birth @xcite .",
    "@xcite argue merging of two white dwarfs might be responsible for events such as sn  2002ic , whereas @xcite argue for the type 1.5 sn scenario proposed by @xcite in which the explosion is due to a star at the end of the post - agb phase @xcite .",
    "these models would produce sne  ia with dense csm envelope .",
    "it is not clear in what parameter range can these different models produce successful supernovae .",
    "studies of cs dust around sne  ia can be performed and be used as probes of the progenitor systems and explosion mechanisms .",
    "another source of dust in the immediate neighborhood of sne  ia may be the ejecta themselves .",
    "the thermonuclear reaction lasts only for a second after the sn explosion .",
    "during which the ejecta reach a temperature of 10@xmath39 k and an expansion velocity of 25,000 - 30,000 km / sec .",
    "the temperature of the ejecta decreases rapidly due to adiabatic cooling and reaches a temperature of about @xmath40 k in only about a few minutes .",
    "this rapid cooling allows for the condensation of dust in the ejecta .",
    "most of these dust , however , are likely to be quickly destroyed by radioactive heating as the ejecta are reheated to temperatures around 10,000 k. but the dust formation may be patchy and some dense clumps may survive the radiation field of the supernova , especially at the highest velocity layers that are shielded from the bombardment of the radioactive decays deeper .    in summary , the signatures of cs dust can be recognized by analyzing light curves of sne  ia .",
    "observations of wide wavelength coverage from uv to the near - ir offer the best hope for discriminating interstellar dust from cs dust .",
    "spectropolarimetry is another method for studying interstellar dust , as shown in @xcite for sn  1987a ."
