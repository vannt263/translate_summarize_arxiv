    "novel integrated photonic circuits built on a single chip have been recently introduced within the realm of quantum information @xcite , disclosing new perspectives towards quantum communication @xcite , quantum computation @xcite , and the quantum simulation of physical phenomena @xcite .",
    "the next generation of integrated quantum circuits ( iqcs ) , incorporating highly efficient photon sources @xcite and detectors @xcite , are expected to have a large impact in future photonic quantum technologies and are essential to achieve a level of complexity and stability of the operations higher than what previously demonstrated .",
    "the miniaturization of integrated photonic devices represents a necessary step towards the implementation of state - of - the art quantum information protocols , which require an exponentially high number of elements and an increasing stability , impossibile to achieve with standard bulk optical setup .",
    "inherently stable interferometer networks , composed of waveguides , beam splitters and phase shifters , built in two dimensions on different material platforms , such as silicon , silicon nitride and others , are realized by lithography , a well established technique already developed for telecom wavelengths .",
    "this approach allows the fabrication of a large number of replicas of the same circuit by using a single mask and represents at the moment the strongest candidate for a large - scale production of iqcs .",
    "while it has been demonstrated that the operation complexity performed by such systems may be very high , it is worth to remember that they are still limited by the need of using a large number of photons .",
    "moreover , only path - encoded qubits are allowed in such systems , since polarization qubits are degraded by the intrinsic large birefringence of the material substrate or of the waveguide itself . on the other hand , several applications in the quantum domain , such as quantum computation and quantum communications , may greatly benefit from the possibility of manipulating and controlling polarization qubits .",
    "femtosecond laser writing , recently introduced for iqc applications @xcite , allows to write in three dimensions circular transverse waveguide profiles able to support the propagation of nearly gaussian modes with any polarization state , while keeping highly stable the phase of path - encoded qubits .",
    "besides , this technique makes it possible to perform arbitrary transformations of the polarization state by suitable integrated devices , such as polarization beam splitters @xcite and waveguide - based optical waveplates @xcite .    nowadays , the building blocks necessary to perform the basic operations with path- and polarization - qubits are available .",
    "time is right to demonstrate the simultaneous control of two different degrees of freedom of the photons within the same chip . in this work",
    "we manipulate path- and polarization - encoded qubits belonging to a 2-photon 4-qubit hyperentangled / cluster state @xcite and propagating through an integrated quantum circuit .",
    "this enabled us to demonstrate the grover s algorithm on a four element database , in a one - way quantum computing approach .",
    "our experimental setup is depicted in fig .  [ fig1 ] and fig .",
    "[ figexp ] and consists of a hyperentangled - photon source , a manipulation stage , which includes the integrated photonic chip , and a detection stage .",
    "the source generates pairs of photons , hyperentangled in the path and polarization dofs , via spontaneous - parametric down conversion at 710  nm by a bbo type i nonlinear crystal @xcite .",
    "polarization entanglement is produced by optical superposition of two cones of perpendicular polarization created by double passage , back and forth , of a uv laser pump through the bbo crystal from both sides @xcite .",
    "path entanglement is generated by selecting with a 4-hole screen two pairs of correlated spatial modes , namely @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , @xmath3 .",
    "the generated hyperentangled ( he ) state is :    @xmath4    where @xmath5 and @xmath6 label the two photons ; @xmath2 , @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath3 identify the four spatial modes , while @xmath7 and @xmath8 represent the two possible polarization states for each photon . as will be discussed in the following ,",
    "the phases @xmath9 and @xmath10 , corresponding respectively to the polarization and path dofs , can be independently controlled .",
    "the chip consists of two waveguide balanced beam splitters ( @xmath11 and @xmath12 ) , yielding polarization insensitive behaviour@xcite , fabricated by femtosecond laser waveguide writing@xcite using the second harmonic ( @xmath13=515  nm ) of a yb : kyw cavity - dumped laser oscillator ( 300  fs pulse duration , 1  mhz repetition rate ) .",
    "femtosecond laser pulses are focused by a 0.6  na microscope objective into the volume of the glass substrate ( eagle 2000 , corning ) , where nonlinear energy absorption creates a permanent and localized refractive index increase .",
    "waveguides are produced by smoothly translating the sample under the laser beam , using aerotech fiberglide 3d air - bearing stages . under proper irradiation conditions ( 100  nj pulse energy and 10  mm  s@xmath14 translation speed )",
    "single - mode waveguides at 710  nm are produced , at 170  @xmath15 depth below the glass surface , characterized by a mode diameter of @xmath168  @xmath15 m , propagation loss of 1.5  db  cm@xmath14 and coupling loss to single mode fibers @xmath18  1  db per facet .",
    "integrated beam splitters are realized following a particular three - dimensional directional - coupler design@xcite that ensures insensitivity to the polarization . to achieve a balanced splitting ratio the waveguides , initially 127  @xmath15 m far",
    ", are brought closer ( with a bending radius of 90  mm ) down to 10  @xmath19 distance for an interaction length of 1.8  mm .",
    "overall chip length is 34  mm .",
    "the four modes @xmath2 , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , @xmath3 are coupled to the input ports of @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively , through a 8 cm long , single mode fiber array , terminated at the input side by a set of four gradient index ( grin ) lenses .",
    "one of the main technical issue is given by the independent injection of each mode into the corresponding grin lens ; this is performed by using for each mode a set of custom made half - mirrors and one half - lens . besides , polarization compensation is individually performed for each mode through a properly chosen set of half waveplates ( hwps ) and quarter waveplates ( qwps ) .",
    "finally , the fiber array is thermally insulated from the environment in order to guarantee path stability .",
    "output light from the chip is collected by a 10@xmath20 objective .",
    "the coupling ratios of the 4 modes in each optical component and the overall transmission efficiency are provided in the supplementary information .",
    "two interference filters centred at 710  nm select 10  nm bandwidth and ensure photon indistinguishability , and two avalanche photodiode ( apd ) detectors measure coincidences between output modes @xmath21 , @xmath22 that are coupled to the detectors through multi mode fibers ( we label @xmath23 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , @xmath24 the output modes of @xmath11 and @xmath12 respectively ) .",
    "figure  [ fig1]c shows the hong - ou - mandel ( hom ) dips obtained when the two photons are injected within @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively .",
    "we obtained the following visibilities : @xmath25 for @xmath11 and @xmath26 for @xmath12 , thus showing the correct operation of the two systems . after removing @xmath27 accidental coincidences every 30 sec ,",
    "we obtain @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "in a first experiment , we injected in the chip the path - polarization he state : @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "this state was obtained from eq .   by introducing the polarization transformation using the compensation",
    "waveplates shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] such that @xmath33 and @xmath34 on modes @xmath0 and @xmath2 while @xmath35 and @xmath36 on @xmath3 and @xmath1 . in this way",
    ", we were able to guarantee the polarization compensation over the entire system , which includes the fiber array and the chip , on the computational polarization basis . in order to compensate the two pairs of correlated modes on the diagonal basis , we introduced before the compensation plates on mode @xmath3 an additional half hwp at zero degrees .",
    "as the addition of the plate preserves the compensation in the computational basis , we tilted it along its vertical axis in order to keep constant the phase difference between the two couples of modes .",
    "this ensures the simultaneous compensation on the polarization degree of freedom .",
    "arbitrary values for the parameters @xmath9 and @xmath10 in eq .   can be set by translating the spherical mirror within the he source and by tilting an additional glass plate on mode @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "the plus signs appearing in eq .   were achieved by setting @xmath37 and the minus signs are obtained by setting @xmath38 .",
    "the overall symmetry of the state determines the behaviour of the two photons : if the wavefunction of the he state is symmetric they emerge from the same output port of the beam - splitters , corresponding to a coincidence dip , while the expected result in the case of an antisymmetric wavefunction is a coincidence peak .",
    "this behaviour can be analysed by recovering the dips and peaks of path entanglement varying both @xmath10 and @xmath9 so that a dip can be obtained with @xmath39 and a peak with @xmath40.results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : he01 ] .",
    "the average peak / dip visibilities are @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "these results are comparable with those of ref .",
    "@xcite and prove the achievement of path - polarization hyperentanglement on chip with good fidelity .     and @xmath43 varying both @xmath9 and @xmath10 . peaks and dips derive from the symmetry of the entire he wave function .",
    "experimental data of each curve are fitted with the convolution of a gaussian with a sinc function ; error bars derive from the poissonian statistical distribution of counts .",
    "errors on the peak / dip visibilities are estimated by using a monte carlo statistical analysis on experimental data . ]    in a second experiment , the same hyperentangled source was used to engineer a four - qubit cluster state encoded in the path and polarization dofs of the two photons : @xmath44 where @xmath45 . at variance with standard hyperentangled states , four qubits cluster states are not biseparable and present genuine multipartite entanglement @xcite .",
    "they can be thought as graphs where the vertices are the physical qubits initially in the state @xmath46 , and each edge represents a controlled - phase gate entangling the two connected nodes . as an example , in this graphical representation a he state is equivalent , up to single qubit transformations , to the graph formed by two disjointed couples of vertices , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tomo_cluster]a .",
    "a cluster state can then be obtained by connecting these pairs of qubits . in our case",
    "this was easily performed by inserting a zero - order hwp in mode @xmath2 oriented along the optical axis , as explained later . in the one - way quantum computation model @xcite ,",
    "cluster states provide the entire resource for the computation as the information is written , processed and read out by single - qubit measurements on the physical qubits of the cluster .",
    "this approach to quantum computation transfers the main complexity of the process from the ability to implement multi - qubit gates to the capability to create the initial cluster state .",
    "it is therefore well - suited for quantum optical schemes where states can be produced with high fidelity while photon - photon interactions are difficult to achieve , thus precluding two - qubits gates from linear optical circuits .",

    "* c ) * real part of the two qubits polarization tomography of pair @xmath43 of the cluster state , compensated to be a @xmath48 state .",
    "imaginary parts of the two tomographies are negligible .",
    "[ fig : tomo_cluster],scaledwidth=48.0% ]    starting from the he state @xmath49 and inserting a zero order , zero degrees hwp in mode @xmath2 we were able to change the polarization of @xmath43 from @xmath47 to @xmath48 while keeping @xmath50 unchanged , thus creating the cluster state @xmath51 .",
    "the quantum state tomographies corresponding to the two mode pairs are reported in fig .",
    "[ fig : tomo_cluster]b - c and correspond to the following parameters : @xmath52 here @xmath53 is the fidelity and @xmath54 is the concurrence of the experimental state , while errors are calculated from a monte carlo analysis of the experimental data .",
    "the obtained results are comparable with those of the tomographies of the hyperentanglement source reported in the si , thus proving that the cluster state is correctly generated .",
    "the stabilizer formalism , explained in ref .",
    "@xcite can be adopted to measure a genuine multipartite entanglement witness : @xmath55 where upper case @xmath56 , @xmath57 define the pauli operators for the polarization of the state , lower case @xmath58 , @xmath59 define the pauli operators for the momentum .",
    "the state is entangled when @xmath60 and particularly it is purely entangled for @xmath61 . the polarization dependent stabilizers are measured by rotating the analysis waveplates ( fig .  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the two beamsplitters perform the transformation in the path of each photon @xmath62 and @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is achieved by changing the phase @xmath65 , i.e. tilting the correspondent glass plate on mode @xmath66 .",
    "this manipulation allows us to measure the momentum - dependent stabilizers involving @xmath67 .",
    "we report in tab .",
    "[ tab : stab ] the measured outcomes for the stabilizers .",
    "the overall value of @xmath68 demonstrates that the state presents genuine multipartite entanglement , and we can derive a lower bound@xcite for the fidelity of the created cluster state @xmath69 .",
    "this result is comparable with that of ref .",
    "@xcite .       in order to test the entanglement in chip we needed to compensate the effect that both the integrated device and the fiber array have on the polarization of the input state .",
    "we assumed that these elements perform unitarian transformations to the polarization of the state .",
    "as shown in fig . 1 , we used a qwp ( quarter wave plate ) and a hwp ( half wave plate ) to compensate them in the h - v basis , while the phases between @xmath71 and @xmath72 ( @xmath73 ) were adjusted tilting on the vertical axis a hwp at @xmath74 in the mode @xmath3 and using the spherical mirror of the source .",
