    "[ intro ]    since the discovery of the high - temperature ( high-@xmath1 ) superconductors in 1986 , there have been many advances in the field of superconductivity due to intense worldwide research efforts .",
    "several sets of ceramic cuprate materials have been synthesized and the transition temperature @xmath1 in some of these has exceeded @xmath2 .",
    "they all share a common quasi - two - dimensional structure and the superconductivity is believed to originate from the electron correlations in the @xmath3 planes . in spite of intensive study of these compounds during the past decade , there is no consensus on a possible mechanism for superconductivity . at the same time , researchers have focused on out - of - plane effects as an explanation in the cuprate superconductors , because all the cuprate families share the same @xmath3 plane , but the maximum @xmath4 varies dramatically from one cuprate family to another  @xcite .",
    "this variation is unlikely to be caused by the electronic interactions in the @xmath3 plane , but it is most probably due to different atomic structures between the planes and their indirect effect on the electronic structure in the @xmath3 plane .",
    "recently , it has been argued that the non - planar apical oxygen atoms in the @xmath5 pyramid or @xmath6 octahedron play an important role in the out - of - plane atomic - scale lattice effects in high @xmath7 superconductors ( htscs )  @xcite .",
    "more systematic experimental studies have been done on @xmath0  @xcite ( @xmath8-@xmath9 ) . because of the natural cleavage plane between two @xmath10 layers , the above system has been ideal for probing the planar electronic structure .",
    "this material also has a complicated superstructure modulation ( supermodulation ) which is known to have a strong effect on the position of the apical oxygens but almost no effect on the @xmath3 plane  @xcite .",
    "slezak et al .",
    "measured the local superconducting gap using stm with atomic precision and found that the energy gap also has a modulation with the same periodicity as the structural supermodulation  @xcite .",
    "superconductivity in cuprate materials is often discussed in the context of the quantum critical point that controls the optimal doping and maximum in the transition temperature  @xcite .",
    "most measurements of magnetic correlation length near putative quantum critical point ( qcp ) reveal that it remains finite .",
    "scanning probes ubiquitously reveal electronic nanoscale inhomogeneity ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "all these findings cause us to question the assumption of a smooth evolution to the quantum critical point .",
    "a possible alternative explanation of these findings is that the electronic matter develops a spontaneously inhomogeneous modulations ( stripes , checkerboards , etc . ) near qcp  @xcite .",
    "this propensity to spontaneous charge inhomogeneity can significantly benefit from the electronic modulations induced by the apical oxygen positions . from this perspective",
    "it is natural to expect that apical oxygen position modulations provide a perturbation that leads to in - plane charge and spin modulation and therefore would lead to a spatially modulated superconducting state with finite correlation lengths both for charge and spin excitations .",
    "in addition , scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) measurements in underdoped @xmath8-@xmath9 provide information about two energy scales or gaps , coherent vs. incoherent pairings , metal - insulator transition , etc .",
    "driven by temperature and electron concentration  @xcite .",
    "for most htscs , the changes in physical properties are obtained by doping carriers through changes of composition .",
    "apart from the usual doping cases , some htscs with bi , such as @xmath8-@xmath9 , can experience self - doping , where the ions in non - conducting layers can act as a charge reservoir , which provides free carriers to the @xmath3 plane  @xcite . here",
    "we investigate possible supermodulation of a charge redistribution ( self - doping ) between the charge reservoir and the @xmath3 plane at fixed stoichiometry .",
    "inspired by the observation of gap modulation , several theoretical proposals have been put forward by introducing variations of coupling constants on a phenomenological level , or applying the conventional bcs theory  @xcite .",
    "here we report the results of a microscopic study of pairing gap modulation for repulsive electrons within individual unit cells in real space for various spatial displacements of the apical atoms on superconducting pairing .    in this paper",
    "we discuss the physical nature of the observed local pairing gap modulation and possible charge redistribution in connection with the structural changes , the change of chemical potential and self - doping effect .",
    "we argue that the superconducting pairing correlations are strongly driven by pairing modulations while charge density and the chemical potential in the supermodulation phase can change slightly with the periodicity of structural changes .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : following the introduction to the various aspects of pairing modulations , we present the microscopic model and methodology of exact cluster calculations of pyramidal structures in section  [ method ] . in section",
    "[ result ] , we show the results of charge gap variations and pairing modulation in @xmath0 .",
    "the concluding summary constitutes section  [ summary ] . in appendixes , we present the details of calculations related to various aspects of modulation properties .",
    "[ model ]    slezak et al . showed a direct link between the spatial modulation of the out - of - plane atomic structure within an individual unit cell and the variation of the local gap maximum  @xcite .",
    "the non - planar atoms , especially the apical oxygen atoms , are playing an indirect but important role on modulating the local electronic structure of the @xmath3 plane .",
    "merz et al .",
    "@xcite concluded from their x - ray absorption spectroscopy that increasing @xmath11 dopant can induce holes both on oxygens in @xmath3 plane and the apical oxygen atom .",
    "this result suggests that both the planar and apical oxygens can be electronically connected and might be controlling the local electronic state by exchanging holes between @xmath3 plane and other planes",
    ". this could be the origin of interlayer interactions and local gap variations .",
    "therefore , in order to simulate the spatial gap modulation , we need a model which can treat the local electronic state exactly and simultaneously include an out - of - plane interaction that can exchange electrons / holes with the basal atoms .",
    "this requirement suggests the use of a quantum cluster treatment to deal with local correlations and an extra out - of - plane site to control the electron / hole concentration on the @xmath3 plane .",
    "we begin with the canonical single band hubbard model on a pyramid cluster ( as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] ) .",
    "@xmath12 here , @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) is the electron destruction ( creation ) operator at the basal sites with spin @xmath15 ( or magnetic sublevel ) , while @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) is the same operator at the apical site .",
    "the first term indicates the hopping between the nearest basal sites @xmath18 and @xmath19 ( @xmath20 denotes the nearest neighbor sites ) with the same hopping parameter @xmath21 .",
    "the second term describes hopping between the apical site and the basal site @xmath18 with a hopping amplitude @xmath22 .",
    "in addition , @xmath23 is the on - site coulomb interaction . in practice",
    ", the hopping within the plane should be much bigger than that of the out - of - plane atom , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath24 .",
    "the energies are measured with respect to @xmath25 , unless otherwise stated .",
    "the cluster can be solved exactly for all the eigenvalues and eigenvectors  @xcite .",
    "the apical site can exchange holes with all the basal sites , so displacements of the top site within the cluster will affect the planar electronic structures .    in the absence of electron - hole symmetry , the sign of the hopping amplitude between the nearest neighbor sites leads to distinct changes of the electronic structure  @xcite . in nonbipartite structures , such as the pyramid or tetrahedron",
    ", the results strongly depend on the sign of @xmath21 and @xmath22 . here",
    "the pyramidal non - bipartite geometry is defined by choosing @xmath25 as the hopping connecting square ( plaquettes ) sites in the basal plane , and we consider various coupling parameters @xmath26 as hoppings between the apical site and the planar site @xmath18 in the square base ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] ) .     and",
    "the hopping parameters between the top site and basal sites are @xmath27 . here , all the energy parameters are measured in units of @xmath21 . ]",
    "[ method ]    an essential element for understanding our results on pairing modulation is the formation of coherent pairing state of @xmath28 electrons with a negative charge gap and positive spin gap obtained earlier in refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein . for completeness",
    "here we first briefly summarize the key results of exact diagonalization in small clusters at weak and moderate @xmath29 values .",
    "the square lattices , generated recently on optimized ( finite ) betts unit cells , provide strong evidence for the phase separation instabilities found in generic @xmath30 , @xmath31 and other clusters  @xcite .",
    "numerical ( exact ) calculations of the energy levels @xmath32 for the relevant electron number @xmath28 and a given spin @xmath33 are used to define charge and spin gaps .",
    "the charge excitation gap @xmath34 at finite temperature can be written as an energy difference of canonical energies , @xmath35 , where @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "the charge gap determines the stability of an @xmath38electron state compared to an equal admixture of @xmath39 and @xmath40electron states ( the average number of electrons for this mixture is still @xmath28 ) .",
    "depending on the strength of the on - site electron - electron repulsion @xmath29 , this charge excitation gap can be positive @xmath41 or negative @xmath42 .",
    "the pair binding energy @xmath43 determines whether a total 2@xmath28 electrons on pair of isolated clusters prefer to distributed uniformly ( @xmath41 ) or give rise to local charge inhomogeneity ( @xmath42 ) . for odd @xmath28",
    "this corresponds also to an effective electron pairing , since clusters are more likely have an even number of electrons .",
    "when the charge gap is negative , the system energetically prefers the mixed state with @xmath44 and @xmath45 electron configurations .",
    "the spin gaps @xmath46 , defined in the grand canonical ensemble , can provide essential insights into the response of the system to applied magnetic field @xmath47 .",
    "the magnetic susceptibility @xmath48 is defined as a function of the magnetic field @xmath47 near the critical chemical potential ( say @xmath49 ) and , in the negative charge gap region ( @xmath42 ) , we introduce the spin gap @xmath46 as the magnetic field which gives rise to the first magnetic susceptibility peak , _",
    "i.e. , _ the magnetic field required to drive the system into its lowest exited state .      the zeros of canonical and the grand canonical gaps as a function of @xmath29 at @xmath50 describe qcps for continuous and abrupt quantum phase transitions .",
    "the change of sign in canonical gaps at the level crossing point away from half filling is crucial for electron ( charge ) phase separation and pairing instabilities .",
    "as temperature approaches zero , the possible sign change in canonical gap @xmath51 at @xmath52 signifies the existence of a qcp related to first order ( dramatic ) changes .",
    "this qcp describes an abrupt ( discontinuous ) change in the ground state of a many - body system due to strong quantum fluctuations .",
    "the negative charge gap ( @xmath42 ) shows the regions of electron instability with a tendency toward phase separation . for one hole",
    "off half filling the mott - hubbard like insulating ground state for electron - hole pairing with @xmath41 is stable at all @xmath53 , while for @xmath54 , the ground state consists of paired electrons ( @xmath42 ) . this pairing instability which redistributes electrons signals the formation of spatially inhomogeneous , hole - rich @xmath55 and hole - poor @xmath56 regions .",
    "[ instabilities ] many cooperative phenomena invoked in the approximate treatments of the  large \" concentrated systems , are also seen in exact analysis of pairing instabilities in the canonical and grand canonical ensembles of the small clusters in the thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "the negative sign of the canonical charge gap ( @xmath42 ) is a signature of phase separation instabilities .",
    "however , instead of a full phase separation , the spin gap rigidity ( @xmath57 ) provokes local inhomogeneities in electron distribution .",
    "the spatial inhomogeneities in the charge distribution imply different electron configurations , close in energy .",
    "the quantum mixing of these hole - rich @xmath55 and hole - poor @xmath56 clusters for one hole off the half filling case provides a stable spatial inhomogeneous media that allows the pair charge to fluctuate .",
    "thus , the negative sign of charge gap implies phase ( charge ) separation of the clusters on hole - poor and hole - rich regions .",
    "we find that at rather low temperatures the calculated positive gap @xmath58 in grand canonical method can have equal amplitude with a negative charge gap @xmath34 derived in the canonical method , _",
    "i.e. _ , with identical gaps , @xmath59 .",
    "such behavior is similar to the existence of a single quasiparticle gap in the conventional bcs state .",
    "we identify such an opposite spin ( singlet ) coupling and electron charge pairing as spin coherent electron pairing .",
    "this is an important characteristic of ( quantum ) phase coherence in the ground state associated with simultaneous coherent pairing of independent charge and spin ( fermion ) entities and the corresponding full bose - einstein condensation of these  preformed \" bosons with a single energy gap .",
    "such behavior is similar to coherent pairing with a unique quasiparticle gap in the conventional bcs theory .",
    "however , unlike in the bcs theory , the charge gap differs significantly from the spin gap as temperature increases above the superconducting temperature , @xmath1 .",
    "it is important to note that the coherent pairing formation through _ separate _ condensation of bound holes and coupled opposite spins ( both boson entities ) at different critical temperatures @xmath60 and @xmath61 is somewhat different from the cooper pairs ( composite bosons ) condensation with a unique critical temperature .",
    "the magnitudes of the spin gap and charge gap also differ with increasing temperature here , unlike in the bcs case .",
    "this implies the emergence of two gaps and two energy scales or two characteristic critical temperatures leading correspondingly to incoherent pairing of pairs with unpaired ( opposite spins ) far above @xmath1 seen in htscs using stm measurements  @xcite .",
    "microscopic spatial inhomogeneities and incoherent pairing detected in these experiments are correlated remarkably with predictions of charged pairs without quantum phase coherence above @xmath61 in nanoscale .",
    "the positive change gap @xmath41 describes charge redistribution and mott - hubbard like transition above @xmath60 .",
    "the positive spin gap calculated in the grand canonical approach implies coherent pairing with a homogeneous spatial distribution below @xmath61 .",
    "this picture is consistent with some stm measurements in @xmath62  @xcite .",
    "[ result ]      [ sec1 ]    high temperature superconductors have complex layered structures . for example , there are various layers , bilayers or trilayers that affect the superconductivity attributed to the cu - o planes acting as _ reservoirs _ of electrons or holes . here",
    "we attempt to model such complex structures with a simple pyramid having a square base and and an out - of - plane atom . as discussed in our previous publications ,",
    "a negative charge gap @xmath34 is essential for having coherent pairing states at zero temperature @xmath63 .",
    "we first consider the simplest case to testify the validity of the model : a symmetric pyramidal cluster with equal hopping terms @xmath64 @xmath65 between the apex atom and the all the basal atoms .",

    "[ fig : fig2 ] is shown at various @xmath29 values and low temperatures , @xmath67 ( in units of @xmath21 ) close to optimal doping for one hole of half filling , @xmath68 ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "the energy gap vanishes in a multiparameter space of @xmath29 and @xmath66 , where its sign changes define the quantum critical points for electron charge and spin pairing instabilities . in the fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] plots with @xmath70 provides strong evidence for the existence of a qcp of level crossing instability , associated with phase separation instability .",
    "for example , the charge gap at @xmath71 vanishes ( @xmath72 ) at @xmath73 .",
    "this qcp describes an abrupt change in the ground state of a many - body system due to strong quantum fluctuations , _",
    "i.e. , _ a transition from electron pairing into mott - hubbard behavior . the negative charge gap ( @xmath42 ) at @xmath74 corresponds to coherent electron pairing @xmath75 in a vertically deformed square pyramid ( with @xmath76 in the basal plane ) , while for @xmath77 , the mott - hubbard insulating ground state for electron - hole pairing with @xmath41 is stable .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] , as the hopping @xmath66 increases but still small ( for example , @xmath78 for @xmath71 ) , the value of the charge gap changes very slowly , which corresponds to the case with the top site far from the basal plane .",

    "however , when @xmath66 is large enough ( for example , @xmath79 for @xmath71 ) , there is a dramatic change and the charge gap becomes positive .",
    "this illustrates the case with the top site close enough to the base , so the electronic state on the top site greatly affects the electronic state on the basal plane and tends to destroy the electron pairing on the basal as the apical atom gets closer to the plane . comparing with results of the elementary square geometries  @xcite",
    ", we can conclude that the electronic structure of the basal sites contributes significantly to the formation of electron pairs , while the apical site tries to destroy such pairing by  sharing \" holes / electrons with the basal sites .",

    "this feature resembles the effect of small next nearest neighbor hopping in the square lattice . actually , the two effects are equivalent when @xmath66 is small ( see appendix  [ s3 ] ) .",
    "this equivalence indicates that the influence of a far - away top site is like a bridge connecting the next nearest neighbor sites so that it perturbs the electronic state at the plane but does not significantly destroy the paired state .",

    "there are several possible answers here : the modulation of ( 1 ) electron / hole pair strength , ( 2 ) the electronic density and ( 3 ) the electron / hole pair density . in order to verify the first option",
    ", we calculate the change of the chemical potential @xmath138 of the system with the modulation , where @xmath138 is calculated as an average of @xmath139 and @xmath140 ( defined in sec .",
    "[ method ] ) : @xmath141 .",
    "the chemical potential represents the average energy needed to break an electron / hole pair , so it shows the average binding energy of the hole / electron pairs .",
    "we find that modulation amplitude of @xmath138 is smaller than @xmath142 of the average chemical potential .",
    "this result indicates that although the pairing gap experiences a strong modulation , the binding energy of the hole / electron pairs is not affected , i.e. , the pairing gap modulation is a strong coherent effect not strictly relevant to the modulation of ( hole / electron ) pairing strength .",
    "we have also studied the change of electron density on the apical site with modulation .",
    "when the apical site is very far away from basal plane ( all @xmath143 ) , the gap is maximum and there is exactly one electron on the apical atom , i.e. , decoupling of the apical atom with the plane restores the two - dimensional character of electron pairing . for our simulated case , when the apical site is spatially close to the plane , we find that the electron density of the top site increases , which supports the experimental observation that the dopant on oxygen can provoke a transfer of holes / electrons on both @xmath3 plane and @xmath11 atoms .",
    "however , our calculations show that the amplitude of modulations of the electronic density on apical site is smaller than @xmath144 of the average value .",
    "this result indicates that the electronic density on the pairing plane is insignificantly affected by modulation of the out - of - plane structure .",
    "therefore , the gap modulation does not originate from the modulated electronic density .",
    "therefore , we propose the modulation of electron / hole pair density is the source of the pairing gap modulation .",
    "this kind of modulation of pair density is somewhat similar to the hole - pair density wave proposed in ref .",
    "[ summary ]    the effects of disorder in the position of the apical atom outside the cuo@xmath145 plane on the superconducting gap have been investigated in @xmath0 ( bi2212 ) within the framework of small single band hubbard clusters .",
    "we have shown that exact cluster calculations in appropriate geometries can quantitatively describe the displacements of the atoms in the bulk of @xmath0 material with its well - known supermodulation behavior .",
    "our calculations at low temperatures can be used to fit and understand experimental data under variation of the position of the apex atom in the vertical  c \" direction or along  a \" ,  b \" or square diagonal directions .",
    "independent of the character of the quasiperiodic distortion , we find modulation in the variation of the pairing gap around its central position .",
    "the theory provides strong evidence that the supermodulation is correlated with the out - of - plane displacement of the apical site and shows how variations of the inter - atomic distances affect the coupling and maximum of the superconducting energy gap .",
    "the current , exact solution - based study offers strong evidence that the inhomogeneity observed in the stm experiments is driven by distortions of the dopant oxygen atoms , located away from the cuo@xmath145 plane , whose primary effect is to suppress local pair formation .    the structural changes in our microscopic model in the vicinity of qcp provide the locally enhanced pairing modulation where the nanoscale variation of the pairing strength in the superconducting state have a dramatic effect on the pairing gap .",
    "@xmath0 type materials contain the cuo@xmath145 planes and a `` reservoir '' of carriers in other layers .",
    "a charge redistribution may occur between @xmath3 plane and nonplanar atoms driven by supermodulation , i.e. , out - of - plane displacements of the apical atom .",
    "usually one discusses the charge redistribution by changing composition , such as oxygen stoichiometry , etc .",
    "thus , one of the most direct ways to determine the structural changes in couplings can be done through a detailed analysis of the charge distribution and the valence states of the respective out - of- and in - plane ions . in particular , the position of the apex oxygen or the corresponding bond length ( coupling ) is a sensitive probe of these effects . to summarize ,",
    "this effect may explain structural changes such as the shift of the apical oxygen atom under modulation , and therefore one would expect that there should be a charge density modulation accompanying the formation of a modulated gap in @xmath0 type materials .",
    "however , our results strongly suggest that there should not be significant charge transfer from the reservoir into the superconducting plane .",
    "probably the most direct confirmation of the rigidity of charge density distribution can be obtained for the hole concentration from positron annihilation experiments or x ray absorption spectra  @xcite .",
    "the gap modulation or corresponding quantum oscillations in @xmath8-@xmath9 can be attained by tuning pressure or doping due to the direct access they provide to the structural changes that can be traced in the vicinity of qcp .",
    "these calculations can also be extended to finite temperatures , different doping levels or electron concentrations or can be applied to slightly different ( octahedron , tetrahedron , etc . ) geometries .",
    "the obvious next step is to see how the charge gap variations change with temperature and its relationship with the critical temperature t@xmath146 of the cuprate superconductors to explore methods of enhancing and maximizing t@xmath146 . in a nutshell ,",
    "the spectroscopy assessed by cluster studies of repulsive electrons possesses both energy and symmetry information on the local pairing interaction and consequently contains the essential elements for understanding the variations of superconducting gap , coherent pairing and modulation in inhomogeneous , large systems . heavily relying on gained insights from superconductivity effects driven by out - of - plane distortions of the apical atoms",
    ", one can understand also the role of local out - of - plane impurities tied to the mechanisms of superconductivity in other layered high t@xmath146 superconductors , impurities in graphene intercalated compounds , etc .",

    "[ s3 ] the effect on the charge gap of a small apical hopping is similar to that of a small next nearest hopping .",
    "here are a little simple investigates of the relation between these two small extra hopping based on the first order perturbation . for the simplest case , assume all the apical hoppings are the same @xmath86 , and @xmath147 is used to denote next nearest hopping .",
    "both @xmath86 and @xmath147 are small relative to @xmath21 .",
    "assume that the ground state of a four - site cluster without next nearest neighbor is @xmath148 and the ground state of an isolated apical atom is @xmath149 , so the first order correction due to the next nearest hopping is @xmath150 where @xmath151 means summation over all the next nearest neighbors .",
    "while , the first order perturbation due to the apical hopping is @xmath152 where @xmath153 is the @xmath154 state of the top atom . comparing eq .  [ eq : apc ] and eq .  [ eq : nnn ] , @xmath155 multiplication is the only difference . if @xmath156 , the two equation are equivalent . usually , @xmath153 can be state with no electron @xmath157 , one up spin @xmath158 , one down spin @xmath159 , or two spins @xmath160 and these four states build up a complete basis , so @xmath161 .",
    "however , @xmath162 only include three terms @xmath157 , @xmath158 , and @xmath159 , so @xmath163 therefore , as long as the ground state of apical atom is not a two spin state , the effect on the ground state energy within the first order correction due to the apical atom is same as the next nearest hopping .",
    "it is hard to determine all the cases that the condition is satisfied , but some specific cases can be empirically found : ( @xmath164 ) when hopping between the apex and the plane is small , the holes have very small probability to occupy the apical atom at the same time ; ( @xmath165 ) when the electron interaction is strong enough , the double occupancy is prohibited , but this case also causes the spin frustration because of the non - bipartite structure .",
    "[ s5 ]    the experiment ( see  @xcite ) shows a cosinusoidal superconducting gap behavior .",
    "the average gap value at optimal doping is about @xmath166mev and the ( peak - to - peak ) amplitude of gap modulation is about @xmath167 of the average gap value .",

    "the @xmath3 layer does not change too much from the original square structure , but the @xmath168 and @xmath10 layers are strongly distorted .",

    "the distortion of the two layers can be simulated by the displacement of the apical site along vertical and horizontal direction . as mentioned in sec .",
