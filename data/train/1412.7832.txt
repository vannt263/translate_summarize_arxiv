    "recent higher dimensional theories of gravity @xcite have put forward the idea that extra spatial dimensions possibly exist , but these are hidden from our observations due to the effect of warping instead of the traditional kaluza - klein compactification .",
    "this idea opened up new horizons in the field of particle physics and cosmology .",
    "the extra dimensions could be much larger than the planck length , with ordinary matter of the observed four - dimensional ( 4d ) universe being confined to a 4d sub - manifold with three spatial dimensions @xcite .",
    "the 4d hypersurface ( called the ` brane ' ) , is warped by a function of the extra dimension ( called the ` warp factor ' ) , to be embedded in the higher dimensional background .",
    "the simplest example of such warped braneworld models is the thin brane model of randall and sundrum ( rs ) @xcite . in this model ,",
    "the brane is represented by a delta function term in the higher dimensional bulk , and the brane tension is responsible for the discontinuity in the first derivative of the metric at the junction of the two regions .",
    "subsequently , other models with thin or thick branes have been constructed in five ( or higher ) dimensions @xcite .",
    "the thick brane models assume the existence of bulk fields other than pure gravity in the form of real scalars , yielding regular domain wall solutions having a finite thickness , thereby giving rise to well - behaved differentiable metrics . on account of 4d poincar invariance",
    ", these bulk fields acquire static nonzero configurations along the extra dimensions .    in the rs type ii model",
    ", the zero mode perturbation of gravity is localized on the brane which is embedded in a non - compact five - dimensional ( 5d ) anti - de sitter ( @xmath0 ) spacetime having mirror symmetry . as gravity leaks into the higher dimensional bulk ,",
    "only a part of it is felt in the observed 4d universe .",
    "confinement of gravity can be achieved in the thick brane versions of the rsii model @xcite . however , if the geodesic motion of particles gets perturbed , then stable confinement of particles can not be achieved even in the rsii model @xcite . as gravitational force alone",
    "is not sufficient for providing particle confinement in presence of perturbed motion , some additional mechanism is necessary to provide confinement in such a case .",
    "in higher dimensional cosmology , scalar fields help us to explain different phenomena of gravitation .",
    "scalar fields represent spin-0 particles in field theories , for example the higgs field in the standard model of particle physics . in cosmology , the present acceleration of the universe is explained in terms of a so - called ` dark energy ' .",
    "generally , a scalar field ( e.g. quintessence ) is considered as the possible source of dark energy .",
    "other than the dark energy problem , different phases of the inflation @xcite , embedding ( as in the braneworld models ) , can also be explained in terms of scalar fields @xcite .",
    "scalar fields can act as an ` effective ' cosmological constant driving an inflationary period of the universe . to produce a proper phase of inflation , the matter content of the universe must be dominated by a fluid with negative pressure . at very high energies , as in the initial phase of cosmological evolution , the correct description of matter is given by field theory in terms of a scalar field . in the simplest models of inflation , the energy density responsible for inflation arises from the expectation value of a scalar field rolling down a potential .",
    "if the potential of this scalar field is sufficiently flat so that the field moves slowly , then the corresponding pressure is negative .",
    "so it is believed that inflation is driven by one ( or more ) scalar field(s ) , called the `` inflaton '' .",
    "however , the shape of its potential is not known except that it must be sufficiently flat .",
    "this led to the consideration of several types of scalar field models , each having its own merits and demerits .",
    "scalar fields exhibit different cosmological behaviours due to different types of self interactions , or potentials .    in most braneworld models , depending on the nature of the bulk , either the scalar field is assumed to be a function of the extra dimension as well as of the coordinates on the brane @xcite or",
    "is simply dependent on the extra dimensional coordinate . on a large scale ,",
    "the universe appears to be homogeneous .",
    "therefore a cosmological scalar field is assumed to be space - independent , and only varies with time .",
    "in some cases , scalar fields have been used to explain the localization of fermions through yukawa - type interactions , as in the rubakov - shaposhnikov model @xcite .",
    "a non - quantum description of stable confinement of particles in the brane due to a direct interaction between a bulk scalar field and the particles , was provided by dahia et .",
    "they assumed the bulk scalar field to depend only on the extra - dimensional coordinate .",
    "these scalar fields are known as kinklike scalar fields @xcite . in a field",
    "theoretic description of thick branes , such scalar fields are suitable for localizing bulk fermions and other scalar or vector fields near the 4d hypersurface @xcite .    in this work",
    "we have studied the behaviour of a scalar field in a 5d bulk with spacelike extra dimension , in order to derive an idea about the nature of particle confinement in such a 5d spacetime .",
    "we have assumed the scalar field to depend on the extra - dimensional coordinate only . on the other hand ,",
    "the 5d bulk is a warped product space with the warping function dependent on the extra - dimensional coordinate .",
    "we divide our study into three parts .",
    "first , we have examined the nature of the scalar field and the corresponding ` damping force ' on the 4d brane . during this investigation",
    "we have showed how the warping function and the scalar field potential determine the nature of the ` damping force ' , which helps us to study the nature of confinement of particles .",
    "we have assumed a massive scalar field so that we can consider different types of potential and determine the effect of perturbation on the field potential . in the second part",
    "we have studied the effective potential near the brane for a yukawa type interaction between the test particle and the scalar field @xcite . in the last section",
    "we have examined the stability of the dynamical system .",
    "we have discussed the effect of perturbation on the scalar field for an unwarped situation and showed how the nature of this perturbation gives rise to a limit cycle i.e an asymptotically stable situation .",
    "we have studied the system for both quadratic scalar field potential and the higgs potential .",
    "let us consider a 5d line element represented by @xmath1 where the warping function is @xmath2 and @xmath3 is a spacelike extra dimension .",
    "according to our assumption , the 5d manifold is foliated by a family of hypersurfaces defined by @xmath4 .",
    "so the geometry of the hypersurface at @xmath5 can be determined from the equation @xmath6 in the following expressions , a prime stands for derivative with respect to @xmath3 .    a warped product space @xcite , can be defined as follows : let us consider two manifolds ( riemannian or semi - riemannian ) @xmath7 and @xmath8 of dimensions @xmath9 and @xmath10 , with metrics @xmath11 and @xmath12 respectively . with the help of a smooth function @xmath13 ( henceforth referred to as the warping function ) , we can build a new riemannian ( or semi - riemannian ) manifold @xmath14 by setting @xmath15 , which is defined by the metric @xmath16 . here",
    "( m , g ) is called a warped product manifold. for dim @xmath17 , with signature @xmath18 , ( m , g ) corresponds to a spacetime , called a warped product spacetime , which in our case is a ( 3 + 1)-dimensional lorentzian spacetime with signature ( + , -,-,- ) .",
    "the nature of the scalar field is determined from the corresponding field equations .",
    "let us consider the simplest case of a one - component real scalar field @xmath19 minimally coupled to gravity in a warped extra dimension , where we neglect the back reaction produced by the scalar field on the warping , as considered by toharia et al in @xcite .",
    "the 5d scalar field equations are thus given by @xmath20 where @xmath21 .",
    "the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the scalar field need not be constant , so that it can have a nonzero value along the extra dimension , given by @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is an element of the 4d hypersurface .",
    "it has been demonstrated @xcite that such a @xmath3-dependence of the vev of a scalar field may lead to the natural localization of fermions living on the higher - dimensional bulk to the lower - dimensional hypersurface in the thick brane scenario .",
    "the equation of motion for the scalar field now reduces to the form @xmath24 the evolution of the static nonzero configurations of the scalar field in the background spacetime considered by us is therefore given by the equation @xmath25 this equation looks like the equation of standard damped harmonic motion .",
    "however , the difference is that here we are dealing with an equation for space evolution along the extra dimension at a given instant of time , instead of an actual time evolution .",
    "thus the second term of is analogous to a dissipative term , with the quantity @xmath26 being analogous to a ` coefficient of friction ' .",
    "the presence of the ` dissipative ' term makes this system ` nonconservative ' in nature .",
    "we know that during cosmological phase transition the scalar field is required to interact with other fields , to facilitate the transfer of energy from potential energy into radiation @xcite .",
    "a similar study can be done for a 5d bulk considering the type of scalar field described in @xcite .",
    "here we have considered a rsii type scenario with a thick brane .",
    "assuming different types of scalar field potentials we have studied the nature of the ` dissipative ' force and its effect on the dynamical system , in order to get an idea of confinement in all these cases .",
    "the sample field potentials which we have considered are the following : ( i ) quadratic potential @xmath27 , where @xmath9 is the mass of the scalar field @xcite , ( ii ) quartic potential @xmath28 @xcite , where @xmath29 is a coupling constant and ( iii ) @xmath30 where c is a constant @xcite . for the quartic potential",
    ", it is known that the classical equations of motion of a scalar field admit a domain wall solution which is independent of the coordinates on the brane and depends only on the extra - dimensional coordinate @xcite .",
    "its form coincides with ( 1 + 1)-dimensional kink solutions @xcite and provides a suitable mechanism for the trapping of ordinary matter .",
    "the study of this mexican hat potential is a matter of great interest , especially in spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "let us consider the potential due to a massive scalar field .",
    "it is known that a lot of inflationary models are based on scalar fields because scalar fields play an important role in high energy physics .",
    "a massive scalar field helps us to describe chaotic inflation @xcite . during chaotic inflation the scalar field",
    "is assumed not to be homogeneous . at the planck time",
    ", the scalar field in some parts of the universe is large and in other parts of the universe the scalar field is low . so in those parts of the universe where the scalar field is large at the planck time , inflationary expansion can take place .",
    "on other hand the places where the scalar field is low at the planck time , will not experience inflationary expansion .",
    "so it is clear that under such a scenario , dissipation plays an important role in the stabilization of extra dimension . keeping this in mind , here we shall study the nature of the dissipation in the bulk along the extra dimensional coordinate .",
    "the scalar field equation in this circumstance becomes @xmath31 since we were unable to find the analytical solution for , we solved the system in the same way as done in @xcite using the ndsolve routine from mathematica , assuming the boundary condition @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",

    "so the figure suggests that as we move towards the @xmath36 hypersurface , the system will become more stable due to the effect of damping .",

    "we shall consider a single quadratically self coupled scalar field with @xmath29 as the coupling constant .",
    "we may choose @xmath29 to be either positive or negative .",
    "but if we choose a negative coupling constant , then it leads to a potential which has no lower bound .",
    "the potential has a single minimum at the origin if we assume that @xmath39 is positive for a positive coupling constant , and it will also remain invariant under @xmath40 symmetry . but",

    "@xmath92 in this paper we have studied the behavior of a scalar field in a 5d warped product spacetime . the warping function is dependent on the extra - dimensional coordinate only .",
    "similarly , the scalar field we have chosen here , is a function of the extra - dimensional coordinate .",
    "the quantity @xmath93 represents the potential due to the scalar field .",
    "the behaviour of the dynamical system has been studied for different scalar field potentials in order to get some idea about the nature of confinement .",
    "@xmath92 the whole study have been divided into three parts . in the first part",
    "we have analyzed the behaviour of the scalar field and the associated damping force .",
    "the damping force is an additional force which helps the system to attain equilibrium . in our study ,",
    "the damping force depends on the extra dimensional coordinate .",
    "first we considered the dynamical system in presence of a massive potential @xmath94 . here",
    "the damping force becomes maximum at the brane for a growing type of warping function , but the maximum value is zero .",
    "this indicates that if we move away from the the brane the damping will de - stabilize the system . for a decaying warping function",
    "the effect is just the opposite .",
    "next we studied the system under the action of a quartic potential @xmath95 . here",
    "the the system finds itself in stable , neutral and unstable conditions periodically for both growing and decaying warp factors as we move along the extra dimension .",
    "a growing warping function helps the oscillations of the system to die out gradually as we move away from the brane , whereas for a decaying warping function , the oscillations diverge as we move away from the brane .",
    "however , for both types of warping function , the damping force vanishes on the brane .",
    "lastly we have studied the effect of the potential @xmath96 .",
    "here the nature of the scalar field remains almost the same for both growing and decaying warping functions , as if the field is indifferent to the warp factor , though the corresponding damping force shows opposite behaviour in these two cases .",
    "although the system tends to stabilize for the growing warping function , but the damping is absent on the brane .",
    "@xmath92 in the second part we have assumed the scalar field to have yukawa - type interaction with the test particle . under this condition",
    "we have studied the effective potential , which shows a double bottom nature for growing and decaying warping functions when the scalar field has a massive quadratic potential . for a quartic potential , in the case of a growing warping function ,",
    "the effective potential becomes minimum at the brane , but the minimum value is zero , indicating neutral confinement .",
    "whereas for the decaying warping function it attains a repulsive maximum on the brane .",
    "but the interesting part appears when we choose @xmath96 .",
    "the behaviour of the effective potential on the brane is identical for both the warping functions , and is repulsive in nature .",

    "@xmath92 in the final part we have studied the stability of the dynamical system in presence and absence of a perturbation during an unwarped condition . we found that the presence of perturbation may or may not generate asymptotically stable cycle i.e a limit cycle , depending on the nature of the scalar field potential . in the warped condition , the phase trajectories are not limit cycles and therefore we need not analyze the stability of the system in this condition . in the unwarped case , for the quadratic potential we find that there is a condition on the possibility of obtaining a limit cycle when the system remains unperturbed .",
