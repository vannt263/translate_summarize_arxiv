    "over the past several decades there have been remarkable breakthroughs in experimental techniques for probing non - classical behaviors of small - scale quantum objects coupled to quantum environments ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "correspondingly , a more sophisticated theoretical understanding of the thermodynamic nature of such systems , especially in the low temperature regime where quantum effects are dominant , has been substantially demanded .",
    "in contrast to common quantum statistical mechanics , which is intrinsically based on a vanishingly small coupling between system and environment , the finite coupling strength between them in the quantum regime causes some subtleties that must be recognized .    at the heart of the aforesaid ``",
    "quantum thermodynamics '' @xcite , the second law of thermodynamics , assumed to be inviolable by the scientific community for over a century @xcite , has been confronted by challenges with considerable interest , and its absolute status has even come under increased scrutiny @xcite .",
    "in fact , this fundamental law of nature has extensively been theoretically studied particularly in the scheme of a quantum harmonic oscillator linearly coupled to an independent - oscillator model of a heat bath ( quantum brownian oscillator ) in equilibrium at a ( low ) temperature @xmath0 , mainly due to its mathematical manageability .    a short overview of recent results either pro or contra the validity of the quantum second law has been given in @xcite ; and the final result therein was that a properly defined clausius inequality @xmath1 representing the second law is valid without any previously argued violation in form of @xmath2 at @xmath3 . in the above inequality",
    ", @xmath4 represents the von - neumann entropy of the coupled oscillator , which is , interestingly enough , identical to the thermal entropy of an _ uncoupled _ effective oscillator in equilibrium . and @xmath5 is a heat exchanged between ( weakly coupled ) effective oscillator and bath , and @xmath6 a well - defined effective equilibrium temperature .",
    "this effective temperature differs from the temperature @xmath0 of the total system ( oscillator plus bath ) especially in the strong - coupling limit , where the total - system temperature is in fact not well - defined as an equilibrium temperature of the system oscillator since the reduced equilibrium density operator of the oscillator @xmath7 is not any longer in form of the canonical thermal state @xmath8 with @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "this discrepancy between these two equilibrium temperatures is , of course , caused by the extra work ( or energy ) needed to couple an ( uncoupled ) oscillator to a bath @xcite . as a result , it may be legitimate to say that the original form of the clausius inequality for the coupled oscillator in terms of the temperature @xmath0 is not well - defined rather than being violated .",
    "however , the entire discussion of the quantum second law has so far been restricted to that for thermal equilibrium states , accordingly , in form of the clausius equality . on the other hand ,",
    "there has recently been an interesting result for a generalized clausius inequality for non - equilibrium quantum processes , but restricted to isolated quantum systems ( initially prepared at a thermal equilibrium state ) @xcite . in this paper",
    "we extend the above discussions into far - from - equilibrium processes in the scheme of quantum brownian oscillator as a prototype of open quantum systems , but in the weak - coupling limit only since the exact treatment of the non - equilibrium processes in the strong - coupling limit is pretty much hopeless to leading to useful quantities in closed form to be needed for our discussion [ cf .",

    ", we consider the quantum oscillator with time - dependent hamiltonian parameters , which finally enables us to derive a generalized clausius _",
    "in_equality without any violation in variation of the hamiltonian parameters as our central result .",
    "in fact , the time - dependent quantum oscillator has been studied by many authors for last about 60 years , initiated by husimi @xcite . in this paper",
    "we appeal to the method of quantum liouville equation in order to directly obtain the time - dependent density operator of the system in consideration .",
    "this approach differs from that developed by husimi , which is based on the fact that the schrdinger equation for an isolated linear oscillator , rather than coupled to a bath , can reduce to a system of classical equations for the oscillator .",

    "the system and the bath effectively share the energy in the coupling term , especially in the strong - coupling limit ( @xmath23 ) , and so it is in fact not completely clear whether this energy should be interpreted as belonging to the system or to the bath @xcite .",
