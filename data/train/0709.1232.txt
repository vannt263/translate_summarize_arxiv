    ", relevant situations do not fall into this category .",
    "for example , in order to compute quantum corrections to classical solutions in euclidean yang - mills theory @xcite singular potentials need to be considered .",
    "they also serve for the description of physical systems like the calogero model @xcite and conformal invariant quantum mechanical models @xcite .",
    "more recently they became popular among physicists working on space - times with horizons .",
    "there , for a variety of black holes , singular potentials are used to describe the dynamics of quantum particles in the asymptotic near - horizon region @xcite .",
    "a similar situation occurs when manifolds are allowed to have conical singularities @xcite . under these circumstances , in general , @xmath9 will not be defined , although for special instances this definition still makes sense ; nearly all of the literature has concentrated on these special instances . in order to describe these instances in more detail , let us consider a bounded generalized cone . as we will see below , the laplacian on a bounded generalized cone has the form @xmath10 where @xmath11 is defined on the base of the cone .",
    "if @xmath11 has eigenvalues in the interval @xmath12 only , one can show that @xmath0 is essentially self - adjoint and no choices for self - adjoint extensions exist .",

    "in particular , the zeta function is shown to have a logarithmic branch point at @xmath7 , in addition to the standard simple pole at @xmath7 .",
    "a natural construct for the determinant is to subtract off these singular terms and to consider the derivative of the finite remainder .",

    "the details of the singular behavior as @xmath14 , as well as of the finite terms , strongly depend on the self - adjoint extension . in section [ sec3 ]",
    "we therefore briefly review the construction of self - adjoint extensions on the generalized cone using the hermitian symplectic extension theory @xcite .",
    "this , finally , provides the set - up for the analysis of the zeta function for arbitrary self - adjoint extensions . even in the most general case eigenvalues",

    "this method allows us to find the determinant for arbitrary self - adjoint extensions , the main result , see theorem [ t - det0 ] , being derived in section [ sec4 ] . in section [ sec - special ]",

    "it was shown that the zeta function @xmath73 has , in the general case , in addition to the  unusual \" poles , meromorphic structures that remained unobserved and which are unparalleled in the zeta function literature such as poles of arbitrary order and logarithmic singularities .",

    "then expanding the determinant of the matrix in about the column containing the zero @xmath408-th column of @xmath58 , we get @xmath411 at this point , we see the general pattern : we expand the determinant in about the column containing the zero @xmath412-th column of @xmath58 and then we continue the process of expanding about each column containing the zero @xmath413 columns of @xmath58 . at the end ,",

    "therefore , since the matrix @xmath61 has rank @xmath62 , the @xmath419 rows of @xmath58 are identically zero , and the @xmath427 rows of @xmath58 are linearly independent , it follows that the @xmath428 rows of @xmath59 are linearly independent and these rows , together with the @xmath429 rows of @xmath58 span all of @xmath430 .",
    "now recall that the @xmath419 columns of @xmath58 are identically zero ; in particular , the span of the @xmath429 rows of @xmath58 does not contain any @xmath431 , where @xmath432 denote the unit vector in @xmath430 with @xmath93-th slot equal to @xmath76 and @xmath50 s elsewhere .",
    "it follows that the span of the @xmath429 rows of @xmath58 ( which are linearly independent ) is contained in the span of @xmath433 .",
    "therefore , by the property of dimension , @xmath434 hence , as the @xmath428 rows of @xmath59 plus the @xmath429 rows of @xmath58 span all of @xmath430 , it follows that @xmath435 we are now ready to prove our lemma .",
    "the nonzero rows of @xmath436 are linearly independent by .",
    "the rows in the matrix @xmath437 that are complementary to the nonzero rows of @xmath438 are therefore linearly independent by .",
    "it follows that the matrix @xmath439 has full rank , which is equivalent to @xmath424 .",
    "now the formula of @xmath440 follows from and .",
    "this completes the proof .      because the @xmath441 eigenvalues and the eigenvalues in @xmath442 of @xmath11 result in rather different analytic properties , it is natural to separate these eigenvalues . with this discussion in mind",
    ", we shall call a lagrangian subspace @xmath443 _ decomposable _ if @xmath444 where @xmath445 is a lagrangian subspace of @xmath446 and @xmath447 is a lagrangian subspace of @xmath448 .",
