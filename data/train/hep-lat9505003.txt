    "the analytical investigation of spin glasses on random graphs of various sorts has a long and honourable history @xcite , though there has been little in the way of numerical simulations .",
    "random graphs with a fixed or fixed average connectivity have a locally tree like structure , which means that loops in the graph are predominantly large , so bethe - lattice - like @xcite ( ie mean field ) critical behaviour is expected for spin models on such lattices . given this ,",
    "the analytical solution for a spin model or , in particular , a spin glass on a bethe lattice @xcite can be translated across to the appropriate fixed connectivity random lattice .",
    "alternatively , a replica calculation can be carried out directly in some cases for spin glasses on various sorts of random lattices .",
    "for the case of ising spins on a fixed connectivity random lattice we arrive at the following prediction for the ferromagnetic transition temperature , if one exists @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the quenched probability distribution of bonds in the model , @xmath5 is the connectivity and @xmath6 is the ( inverse ) transition temperature .",
    "a similar relation is predicted for the spin glass transition temperature @xmath7 @xmath8 from equs.([e00],[e01 ] ) we would expect to find a ferromagnetic transition when @xmath9 at @xmath10 or a spin glass transition at @xmath11 depending on which critical temperature was lower .",
    "the global order parameter that is necessary to describe the system in the spin glass case @xcite appears as the fourier transform of the local field distribution .",
    "a rather different way of looking at the problem of spin models on random graphs was put forward in @xcite , where it was observed that the requisite ensemble of random graphs could be generated by considering the feynman diagram expansion for the partition function of the model . for an ising ferromagnet with hamiltonian @xmath12 where the sum is over nearest neighbours on three - regular random graphs ( ie @xmath13 feynman diagrams ) ,",
    "the partition function is given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the number of undecorated graphs with @xmath16 points , @xmath17 @xmath18 is defined by @xmath19 and the action itself is @xmath20 where the sum runs over @xmath21 indices .",
    "the coupling in the above is @xmath22 where @xmath23 for the ferromagnet and the @xmath24 field can be thought of as representing `` up '' spins with the @xmath25 field representing `` down '' spins .",
    "an ensemble of @xmath5-regular random graphs would simply require replacing the @xmath13 terms with @xmath26 and a fixed average connectivity could also be implemented with the appropriate choice of potential .",
    "this approach was inspired by the considerable amount of work that has been done in recent years on @xmath27 matrix , the size of the matrix is not to be confused with @xmath28 , the number of vertices in the graph ! ] versions of such integrals which generate `` fat '' or ribbon graphs graphs with sufficient structure to carry out a topological expansion @xcite because of the matrix index structure .",
    "the natural interpretation of such fat graphs as the duals of triangulations , quadrangulations etc . of surfaces has led to much interesting work in string theory and particle physics @xcite .",
    "the partition function here is a poor , `` thin '' ( no indices , so no ribbons ) , scalar cousin of these , lacking the structure to give a surface interpretation to the graph .",
    "such scalar integrals have been used in the past to extract the large @xmath28 behaviour of various field theories @xcite again essentially as a means of generating the appropriate feynman diagrams , so a lot is known about handling their quirks .    for the ising ferromagnet on three - regular ( @xmath13 ) graphs , solving the saddle point equations at large @xmath28 shows that the critical behaviour appears as an exchange of dominant saddle point solutions to the saddle point equations @xmath29 at @xmath30 .",
    "the high and low temperature solutions respectively are @xmath31 which give a low temperature magnetized phase that can be detected by a non - zero magnetization order parameter , which is defined in terms of the fields @xmath32 as @xmath33 the critical exponents for the transition can also be calculated in this formalism and , as expected , are mean field . in general a mean field transition appears at @xmath34 on @xmath26 graphs , which is exactly the value predicted by equ([e1 ] ) in the standard approaches .    to consider a non - trivial bond distribution it suffices to make the substitution @xcite @xmath35 in the saddle point equations .",
    "if we take the distribution @xmath36 , this has the effect of replacing @xmath37 by @xmath38 on @xmath26 graphs we find that this change in the coupling shifts the ferromagnetic transition point to @xmath39 which is again identical to the value found from equ.([e1 ] ) .",
    "this is rather surprising as a direct substitution of the weighted propagator coming from equ.([e4 ] ) into the saddle point equations might be expected to correspond an _ annealed _ distribution of bonds because we are calculating with a finite number ( one ) of replicas .",
    "the calculations leading to equ.([e1 ] ) and equ.([e2 ] ) , however , have taken quenched bond distributions by calculating with @xmath40 replicas and then taking the limit @xmath41 .",
    "there are various possibilities for addressing spin glass order in the feynman diagram approach . in @xcite",
    "the entropy per spin was calculated for the ising _",
    "anti_-ferromagnet on @xmath13 graphs and it was found to become negative for sufficiently negative @xmath42 , which is often indicative of a spin glass transition . similarly it was found that the factorized solution ( which exists in the ferromagnetic and anti - ferromagnetic cases ) broke down for higher moments @xmath43 of the partition function , which is again indicative of a spin glass transition .",
    "the temperature at which this happened appeared to be converging to a finite value as the moments increased , unlike the random energy model where a similar calculation gives a temperature that diverges as @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "we now look at the calculation of @xmath45 in a little more detail .",
    "we can put two ising models on each feynman diagram by taking four fields @xmath46 , where the double subscript now covers both replicas , and enlarging the inverse propagator to @xmath47 if we solve explicitly the saddle point equations for the two replica system with @xmath48 we find a @xmath49-independent solution appearing at @xmath50 and a mirror solution at the corresponding antiferromagnetic value given by the inverse of this , @xmath51 .",
    "the second solution , @xmath51 , was also observed in @xcite as the point where the factorized solution broke down for the antiferromagnet with @xmath52 .",
    "remarkably , as we are looking at a finite number ( two ) of replicas here , @xmath53 are precisely the values given by eqn.([e2 ] ) for @xmath7 , where the limit @xmath41 has been taken to obtain the spin glass transition temperature .",
    "thus , just as for the ferromagnetic transition , the quenched @xmath41 results are appearing already at @xmath54 . using numerical routines to investigate the structure of the saddle point equations for more ising replicas",
    "reveals that the solutions at @xmath6 and @xmath7 still appear at higher @xmath40 as bifurcations from the symmetric high temperature solution .",
    "this is not quite the whole story .",
    "as already noted in @xcite for @xmath55 we hit a different sort of critical behaviour which takes us off the symmetric solution branch to a _ replica _ symmetric solution before reaching @xmath7 .",
    "at these points a first order ( jump in @xmath56 ) transition occurs .",
    "this behaviour is identical to that of the ising replica magnet @xcite , which is effectively the sk model at a finite number of replicas for a suitable choice of parameters . in this",
    "the @xmath52 transition is second order and the transition temperature coincides with the @xmath57 value , whereas the @xmath58 transitions are first order and occur at higher temperatures .",
    "we can attempt to analyse the saddle point equations for _ any _ number @xmath40 of ising replicas in the case of purely ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic couplings using bifurcation theory methods because the tensor product structure of the propagator @xmath59 is preserved in these cases solutions existed in these cases . ] which facilitates the calculation .",
    "we will not , however , see first order transitions such as those discussed above because the bifurcation structure only tells us about continuous transitions from the symmetric high temperature solution .",
    "if we denote the @xmath60 propagator in equ.(7 ) as @xmath61 for brevity , the saddle point equations for the @xmath40 replica case may now be written schematically as @xmath62 where @xmath63 are now @xmath64 dimensional vectors , the tensor product is taken over @xmath40 copies of @xmath18 and the action for @xmath40 replicas is denoted by @xmath65 .",
    "we have abused the notation slightly in equ.(18 ) as the left hand side is really @xmath66 because we have multiplied by @xmath67 to get rid of the inverse factor coming from the quadratic term in @xmath65 , which simplifies the analysis of the saddle point equations .",
    "we will continue the abuse in the discussion below .    for the antiferromagnetic case @xmath37 is simply replaced by @xmath68 throughout .",
    "we restrict ourselves to investigating the symmetric branch ( and hence ignore the first order solutions that appear for @xmath69 ) .",
    "a symmetric , high temperature solution can be constructed by taking products of the @xmath70 symmetric solution in equ.(10 ) @xmath71 where @xmath72 standard theory @xcite then shows that a bifurcation from the symmetric high temperature solution ( ie phase transition ) is expected when the hessian @xmath73 is equal to zero .",
    "more explicitly @xmath74 where we have denoted the tensor product of @xmath40 copies of @xmath18 by @xmath75 . if we absorb the factors of @xmath76 into @xmath18 and denote @xmath77 we thus have @xmath78 as our bifurcation equation .",
    "the extension to @xmath5-regular ( @xmath26 ) graphs is trivial . for these the @xmath70 high temperature solution",
    "is ( @xmath79 ) where @xmath80 and the hessian becomes @xmath81 so the net effect is simply to replace @xmath82 by @xmath83 in the bifurcation equation .",
    "the matrix @xmath84 has two eigenvalues @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "from the algebraic structure of @xmath87 we can readily calculate the eigenvalues @xmath88 , @xmath89 where each eigenvalue has multiplicity @xmath90 and express ( taking @xmath91 ) @xmath92 the roots of the bifurcation equation are thus @xmath93 reproducing equ.(3 ) for @xmath94 and @xmath91 . in terms of @xmath95 we can write this as @xmath96 where we have retained the label @xmath97 on @xmath42 .",
    "the above analysis holds for the ferromagnet where @xmath98 . in the case of a pure antiferromagnet @xmath99 and @xmath100",
    "is negative , so we can only find roots of the bifurcation equation for @xmath97 even .",
    "@xmath101 we have thus recovered both @xmath102 ( @xmath103 ) for the ferromagnet and @xmath104 ( @xmath105 ) for the antiferromagnet in this approach .",
    "a generic feature of the above solutions is immediately obvious - once a bifurcation appears at some @xmath40 it is always present for a greater number of replicas .",
    "this suggests a possible resolution of the puzzle of why the quenched transition temperatures are appearing already at finite @xmath40 : the appropriate transition is encountered at the same temperature for _ all _ @xmath40 , so the analytical continuation @xmath41 is trivial . in the spin glass case",
    "the first order transitions for @xmath58 are the fly in the ointment , as these are encountered before the putative continuous transition at @xmath7 .",
    "looking explicitly at the replica symmetric solution for @xmath106 @xcite shows that the the replica symmetric banch appears in a first order transition at @xmath107 ( in the antiferromagnet ) before the symmetric branch takes over again below this .",
    "it is rather amusing that we have encountered a `` c=1 ( 2 ising model ) barrier '' in this context .",
    "calculations are still possible here for @xmath69 , but there is certainly a change of behaviour . in the case of spin models on annealed ensembles of fat graphs",
    "analytical calculations have struggled to get beyond @xmath108 , whereas simulations have so far failed to see much difference between @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "although the tensor product structure of @xmath75 is lost when @xmath111 and the saddle point equation becomes @xmath112 the matrices @xmath113 differ only in the _ sign _ of the eigenvalue @xmath114 , so it is still possible to derive an explicit expression for the hessian , which in this case is @xmath115^{{k } \\choose { m } } .\\ ] ] we thus reproduce the values of @xmath116 and @xmath7 calculated from equs.(3,4 ) for general @xmath49 as the first two bifurcation points .",
    "on @xmath26 graphs we replace @xmath117 , which is still in accordance with equs.(3,4 ) .",
    "as all even bifurcation points are independent of @xmath49 , we predict the @xmath49 independence of the spin glass transition point , as in the more standard approaches .",
    "equs.(3,4 ) are not restricted to distributions of the form @xmath118 , but we can extend the approach here to accommodate this by making the observation that @xmath119 will commute with another @xmath120 for any @xmath121 .",
    "thinking of a given distribution ( a gaussian , say ) as a weighted sum of delta functions over @xmath18 s with different values of @xmath37 , we can still diagonalize all of the terms in the sum simultaneously and arrive at an expression of the form @xmath122^{{k } \\choose { m } } = 0.\\ ] ] for the bifurcation equation .",
    "although the continuous transition temperatures @xmath123 are independent of the number of replicas , the multiplicity of solutions ( ie low temperature phases ) that bifurcate at a given point are not .",
    "there are @xmath124 solutions bifurcating at the spin glass transition temperature @xmath125 , so just as in the infinite range model there is a change in the nature of the solutions to the saddle point equation when @xmath126 and the number of solutions is formally negative .",
    "the classification of the spin glass solutions in the current case is thus clearly closely related to the parametrization of the matrix @xmath127 that appears in the saddle point equations of the infinite range model @xcite .",
    "it is also possible to consider potts spins on a bethe lattice @xcite .",
    "we take hamiltonian in this case to be @xmath128 where the spins @xmath129 can now take on @xmath130 values . in front , for consistency with @xcite ] the critical temperatures for ferromagnetic and spin glass ordering calculated in @xcite give , in the style of equs.([e00],[e01 ] ) , @xmath131 and @xmath132 for @xmath130 state potts models .",
    "if we consider the ferromagnet , @xmath133 , we find that @xmath134 .",
    "there is , however , a parallel here with the ising spin glass calculations .",
    "it was noted in @xcite that this temperature is actually a spinodal point , for @xmath135 the potts ferromagnet undergoes a first order transition before reaching this point .",
    "arguing , as in the ising case , that a random graph looks locally like the bethe lattice we would expect the various critical temperatures and spinodal points still to apply on @xmath26 graphs .",
    "it is also possible to solve the saddle point equations explicitly to avoid relying on this analogy . for the 3-state potts model with action @xmath136",
    "this gives high and low temperature solutions @xmath137 where @xmath138 .",
    "this gives a changeover in behaviour at @xmath139 , ie @xmath140 , which agrees with the value from equ.([e6 ] ) and thus picks out the spinodal point .",
    "similarly , solving the 4-state potts model equations gives the solutions @xmath141 where @xmath142 here .",
    "the changeover here is at @xmath143 , again apparently at the spinodal point",
    ". it would be interesting to carry out a simulation to check the nature of the transition in these ferromagnetic models .",
    "analysis of the potts spin glass saddle point equations follows a similar tack to those of the ising model .",
    "the caveats about missing potential first order transitions at finite @xmath40 still , of course , apply .",
    "if we take the three state potts model as an example @xmath18 is replaced by the @xmath144 matrix @xmath145 , which is the simplest from the point of view of the saddle point equations , involves a rescaling with respect to equ.([potts3 ] ) which accounts for the different between @xmath76 and the high temperature solution in equ.([potts3sol ] ) . ] @xmath146 and the high temperature solution on @xmath13 graphs is ( @xmath147 ) where @xmath148 the eigenvalues of @xmath149 are @xmath150 , where @xmath151 .",
    "it is still true that @xmath152 will commute for any @xmath121 so we can put this to good use again to derive the hessian for general @xmath4 @xmath153^{{k \\choose m } 2^m}.\\ ] ] the multiplicity of solutions has changed because of the possibility of taking one of two @xmath154 from each replica .",
    "the results for @xmath6 and @xmath7 from the bethe lattice are thus faithfully reproduced as the first two bifurcation points .",
    "generalizing to the @xmath130 state potts model on @xmath26 graphs , we find @xmath155 and the eigenvalues of the @xmath156 matrix @xmath157 will be @xmath85 and @xmath158 @xmath154 s , where @xmath159 .",
    "this gives the hessian @xmath160^{{k \\choose m } ( q-1)^m}\\ ] ] which the reader will be pleased to hear is the last elaboration of the bifurcation equation that we consider .",
    "the @xmath161 case reproduces the ising results derived earlier .",
    "given the accessibility of mean - field results on random graphs , especially as one is not forced to take infinite range interactions or deal with the boundary difficulties of the bethe lattice , the lack of simulational effort is rather surprising .",
    "as the new viewpoint offered by regarding the random graphs as feynman diagrams offers the possibility of attacking various questions , such as the nature of replica symmetry breaking on random graphs , from a different angle , we thought it important to continue the simulations of @xcite for the ising and @xmath130 state potts spin glasses on @xmath13 graphs to check carefully the agreement with the known results for quantities such as the transition temperatures and critical exponents and to gain a thorough understanding of the numerics before going on to investigate less well understood aspects .",
    "our numerical methods are largely similar to those of @xcite , so we describe them only briefly in the next section and concentrate on the results of the simulations .",
    "in all of the simulations we report here we generated around 100 different feynman diagrams at each of the sizes we simulated , 100 , 250 , 500 and 1000 vertices .",
    "the quenched bond distribution on each graph was @xmath162 , with @xmath49 taken to be @xmath163 ( the `` @xmath0 '' distribution ) unless specified otherwise .",
    "various massively parallel processors were used to run the simulations of the different graphs simultaneously and perform the quenched averaging over the graphs in situ . again , in the interests of simplicity and reliability ( and as in @xcite ) we used only a metropolis algorithm with simulated annealing rather than some of the more advanced algorithms developed recently . at each @xmath42 value simulated we carried out 500,000 simulated annealing sweeps , followed by 500,000 production sweeps with a measurement every tenth sweep .",
    "each sweep consisted of a complete metropolis update of the lattice .",
    "our strategy for extracting the critical exponents will be to use binder s cumulant for the overlap , defined below , to extract an estimate for @xmath7 and the combination @xmath164 and then to look at the finite size scaling of other quantities to extract further exponents .    in the ising model the spin glass transition temperature is found in simulations by putting two ising replicas on each graph with spins @xmath165 to measure the overlap , which is the order parameter for the spin glass transition @xmath166 the binder s cumulant for the overlap is then defined in an analogous fashion to the binder s cumulant for the magnetization in a ferromagnetic transition @xmath167 \\over [ \\langle q^2 \\rangle ] ^2 } \\label{cumq}\\ ] ] where @xmath168 denote thermal averages and @xmath169 $ ] disorder averages .",
    "the plots of @xmath170 for differently sized graphs are expected to cross at @xmath7 . in the course of all the simulations the overlap distribution @xmath171\\ ] ] was also histogrammed .",
    "a non - trivial @xmath2 is a strong , but not infallible , signal for a spin glass phase .",
    "it is perhaps worth remarking that the order of averages in eqn.([cumq ] ) is not absolutely obvious _ a priori _ - one might have considered @xmath172 $ ] , for instance .",
    "regarding @xmath173 as moments of the distribution @xmath2 , the choice in the eqn.([cumq ] ) would seem most appropriate . the alternative overall average has been considered in quantum spin glass simulations @xcite on the heuristic grounds that it gives better scaling behaviour .",
    "we have carried out the scaling analysis of our simulations described below with both definitions for the ising spin glass and found essentially identical results .",
    "we expect the overlap to have the finite size scaling form @xmath174 at any spin glass transition and the spin glass susceptibility , defined as @xmath175 \\label{csg1}\\ ] ] or , alternatively , @xmath176 to diverge as @xmath177 .",
    "other critical exponents such as that for the specific heat @xmath178 are defined in the standard manner and relations such as @xmath179 still hold good .",
    "the mean field critical exponents are shown in the table below for an ising ( @xmath161 ) spin glass    table 1 : spin glass exponents for ising model    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     table 2 : @xmath7 for various @xmath130 state potts models on @xmath13 graphs .",
    "the quoted errors in the table are the most conservative choice - the largest difference between the crossing points for the various lattice sizes - apart from @xmath180 where the @xmath181 data was dropped , as it failed to cross with the other lattice sizes .",
    "we next look at the qualitative features of the low temperature phase in the various @xmath2 to see if the mean field theory expectations are borne out . with our definitions , the histograms of @xmath2 range from @xmath182 to @xmath158 for a @xmath130 state potts model with the origin at zero and roughly half of the probability density in the range @xmath183 , so we have plotted only @xmath183 , normalized to the range @xmath184 for clarity in all our figures in all of the models the high - temperature @xmath2 look like skewed gaussians centred on the origin , whose sharpness increases with graph size indicating delta - function - like behaviour in the continuum limit . in fig.8",
    "we have plotted @xmath2 for the three state potts model for @xmath185 ( @xmath186 ) .",
    "this is clearly different from the ising model : there is a strong peak at the origin that is increasing with graph size as well as smaller bump at around @xmath187 which is also increasing with graph size and which might tentatively be identified with another peak in the continuum limit . in @xcite simulations of the potts antiferromagnet , where no spin glass phase is expected , saw no signs of the structure at @xmath187 , with @xmath2 remaining resolutely centred on the origin .",
    "although the very large autocorrelation times that are encountered for @xmath188 make the interpretation of the low temperature results a dangerous business we can press on deeper into the low temperature region to look at @xmath2 there and see if there is any evidence for the second transition .",
    "@xmath2 is plotted at @xmath189 for the same three lattice sizes in fig.9 , where we can see that there does , indeed , appear to be a second peak developing away from the origin at @xmath190 as well as the bump at @xmath187 .",
    "the qualitative features of the above results are preserved in the @xmath191 state models that we also simulated : the histogram of @xmath2 broadens from a sharp peak at the origin at around @xmath7 and develops a secondary bump or shoulder .",
    "there is some evidence of further structure developing for even larger @xmath42 .",
    "from the numerical evidence it would thus appear that the @xmath180 potts spin glass with a @xmath0 distribution of bonds lies _ above _ the critical @xmath130 value that separates ising and potts spin glass behaviour , whereas the bethe lattice calculation in @xcite supports the opposite conclusion , although on the relatively small lattices simulated here it is difficult to distinguish between features that will be sharp in the continuum limit and continuous parts of @xmath2 .",
    "a more detailed analysis of the saddle point equations may shed some light on this question analytically . for completeness in fig.10",
    "we show @xmath2 for the @xmath192 model at @xmath193 to demonstrate the similarity with the @xmath180 results .",
    "the fits to the maxima of the binder s cumulant to extract @xmath164 are rather poor for all the higher state potts models , but the specific heat curves for @xmath194 are similar in form to the ising model , as can be seen for the @xmath192 potts model in fig.11 , indicating the continued presence of a cusp rather than a divergence .",
    "we therefore do not have a reliable value of @xmath164 to feed into the finite size scaling relations , although the cusp suggests that @xmath195 , at least for @xmath194 .",
    "nonetheless , we can still fit to find the combinations @xmath196 and @xmath197 at the estimated critical points for the various models .",
    "this gives @xmath198 for the @xmath194 state models respectively .",
    "the mean field theory suggests that @xmath56 becomes discontinuous at @xmath7 for @xmath199 . with the smaller lattices that we have for @xmath200 this effect ,",
    "if it exists , is masked by finite size rounding but attempting to fit @xmath196 does give larger values and much poorer fits than for @xmath194 such as @xmath201 for @xmath202 .",
    "this could be construed as providing some evidence for a discontinuity .",
    "the data allowed fits to @xmath197 only for the @xmath194 models , where it gave @xmath203 respectively .    in summary ,",
    "all the potts @xmath2 are clearly qualitatively different from the ising model , even though the two exponents @xmath204 we fitted for @xmath194 are roughly similar .",
    "there is not sufficient data in the simulations reported here to reliably distinguish a discontinuous transition for @xmath199 , though there are certainly indications ( the fits to @xmath196 ) that this is the case . in all the cases ,",
    "however , the values extracted for the spin glass transition temperature by analysis of binder s cumulant are in agreement with the predictions .",
    "the novel analytical approach offered by using techniques borrowed from matrix models in the manner of @xcite to look at spin models on random graphs allows one to rederive results for transition temperatures and order parameters that are less transparent in previous replica calculations , or only arrived at by analogy with the bethe lattice .",
    "indeed , results from bifurcation theory enabled us to calculate the hessians for bifurcations from the symmetric solution ( which may not be dominant all the way to the bifurcation point , as is seen in the @xmath205 solutions ) in @xmath40 replica ising or potts models for any @xmath40 and @xmath4 .",
    "the number of putative spin glass solutions bifurcating at @xmath125 appeared to behave as in the the infinite range model .",
    "in essence the investigation of a spin glass on a @xmath206regular random graph is reduced to looking at the solutions to the equation @xmath207 further work along these lines is clearly both desirable and possible for the ising and other potts models , with the nature of replica symmetry breaking in this short range ( but still mean field ) model being perhaps the most important question .",
    "we have made no attempt here to follow the various solution branches that bifurcate at @xmath125 , for instance , which would shed light on the low temperature phase , particularly if calculations for arbitrary @xmath40 were still possible .",
    "an understanding of the role of the first order solutions that appear for @xmath69 and their failure to influence the @xmath41 limit is also still missing .",
    "we emphasize again that the transitions in the thin graph model appear to be identical with those in the ising replica magnet where it is the @xmath52 transition that marks the boundary between first order transitions and the behaviour seen in the quenched model at @xmath57 .",
    "we investigated the models numerically in some detail .",
    "quantitatively , transition temperatures were in agreement with those calculated for all the models .",
    "the extraction of the critical exponents for the ising model showed clear mean field behaviour , and the @xmath49-independence of the spin glass transition temperature was also apparent .",
    "qualitatively , the @xmath2 measured in the various models backed up the mean field picture of the phase transition with a continuous distribution for the ising model and sharper features for @xmath208 .    in summary ,",
    "spin glasses on thin graphs offer a promising arena for the application of ideas from matrix models , large-@xmath28 calculations in field theory and bifurcation theory .",
    "the tensor ( or near - tensor ) product of the inverse propagator allows some quite general expressions to be derived for the hessian in the saddle point equations and offers a powerful line of attack on questions such as replica symmetry breaking . as a subject for numerical simulations they offer the great advantage of mean field results with no infinite range interactions and no boundary problems .",
    "it is worth remarking in closing that one is not limited to the mean - field theory with the current methods .",
    "it is possible to `` fatten '' the graphs analytically by increasing the size of the matrices in the saddle point equations @xmath209 as has already been done with some success for ising models coupled to two dimensional gravity @xcite , which is equivalent to looking at the models on an annealed ensemble of planar ( fat)graphs . this reduces the fractal dimension of the graphs from infinity in the mean field case to more realistic values .",
