    "gravitational lensing refers to the bending of light due to the curvature of space - time induced by massive bodies @xcite .",
    "this effect allows one to probe the total matter distribution in the universe , including both luminous and dark matter .",
    "weak lensing is the technique of using the subtle gravitational lensing effect of a large number of galaxies to statistically infer the large - scale matter distribution in the universe ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for detailed reviews ) .",
    "the measurement is based on small , percent - level `` shears '' , or distortions of galaxy shapes due to lensing . with several ongoing large optical surveys collecting data @xcite ,",
    "this technique is one of the most powerful probes for constraining the nature of dark energy @xcite .",
    "conventional weak lensing analyses involve calculating the n - point statistics of the shear field .",
    "in particular , the _ cosmic shear _ measurement , which refers to the 2-point correlation function of the shear field in configuration space , has been measured in several earlier datasets @xcite .",
    "shear @xmath3 is defined to be a combination of second derivatives of the lensing potential @xmath4 , @xmath5  @xmath6 \" is the second partial derivative with respect to the angular sky coordinates @xmath7 of @xmath4 ( assuming a spatially flat universe in the newtonian limit of gr ) , which is defined as @xcite @xmath8 in the above equation , @xmath9 is the comoving distance and @xmath10 is the 3d gravitational potential , whose spatial structure and time evolution contains cosmological information .    instead of measuring statistics based on shear , here we focus on an alternative approach by converting shear into the projected density field , the convergence @xmath11 , also a combination of second derivatives of @xmath4 , @xmath12 the convergence directly represents the integrated mass distribution , which can be seen by using the cosmological poisson equation and the limber approximation to re - write as @xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the hubble constant today , @xmath15 is the total matter density today , @xmath16 is the cosmological scale factor , and @xmath17 is the mass overdensity ( @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the 3d density and mean density respectively ) . in practice",
    "we integrate over the redshift distribution of source galaxies as shown in eq .",
    "15 of the accompanying paper @xcite .",
    "note that the same weak lensing effect also introduces distortions in the observed cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) maps .",
    "reconstructing the convergence map from the cmb gives the integrated mass up to the surface of last scattering ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "compared to the weak lensing convergence map constructed from galaxies , the cmb convergence map typically covers a larger area with lower spatial resolution , and the sources of the lensing effect ( the cmb photons ) come from a single redshift plane . in this letter",
    ", we use `` weak lensing mass maps '' to refer to convergence maps generated from source galaxies .",
    "weak lensing mass maps supplement measurements based on shear in many ways .",
    "mass maps can be easily cross - correlated with other data since they represent a scalar , the local ( projected ) mass density , while the shear is a complex variable and is sensitive to the global mass distribution . cross correlating with x - ray and sunyaev - zeldovich observations helps us understand the relation of hot gas and dark matter in galaxy clusters . cross correlating with the cmb convergence map",
    "provides an important cross check of lensing measurements using different tracers .",
    "other applications of mass maps include peak statistics @xcite , higher - order moments of @xmath11 @xcite , and the identification of superclusters and cosmic voids @xcite .",
    "the methodology of generating weak lensing mass maps has been demonstrated in earlier work .",
    "@xcite generated a 3d mass map using cosmos data in a 1.64 deg@xmath21 area .",
    "the high - quality shear measurements and redshift information allow for good mass reconstruction on small scales and in the radial direction .",

    "the images are taken in 5 optical filter bands ( @xmath22 ) on a total area of @xmath23 deg@xmath21 and reach close to the expected full depth of des at @xmath24 .",
    "the main goal of this work is to reconstruct the weak lensing mass map from shear measurements of the des sv data in a 139 deg@xmath21 contiguous region overlapping with the south pole telescope survey ( the spt - e field ) .",
    "we present the methodology used for the map construction , followed by cross - correlation results and conclusions . throughout the paper ,",

    "note that the plots in this letter rely on the ` ngmix ` shear catalog .",
    "however we analyzed both shear catalogs to assess their statistical consistency .",
    "the `` conservative additive '' selection criteria on the background sample involves a combination of signal - to - noise ( s / n ) cuts , size cuts and other quality cuts . to facilitate our understanding of possible systematics in the procedure of constructing the mass map",
    ", we use a set of simulated galaxy catalogs that we match closely to the characteristics of the data ( including intrinsic galaxy properties , galaxy number counts , noise , photo-@xmath29 errors , survey mask ) .",
    "we use the simulated galaxy catalogs developed for the des collaboration @xcite .",
    "the catalog is based on three flat @xmath2cdm dark matter - only n - body simulations with different resolutions .",
    "galaxies are populated using the prescriptions derived from a high - resolution simulation using subhalo abundance matching techniques @xcite .",

    "weak lensing parameters ( shear and convergence ) are assigned to each galaxy based on the high - resolution ray - tracing algorithm curved - sky gravitational lensing for cosmological light cone simulations @xcite .",
    "details of the data and simulation catalogs are presented in the companion paper .          and can be fourier transformed to get a simple relationship between the fourier transforms of the shear and convergence , denoted @xmath34 and @xmath35 @xcite : @xmath36 @xmath37 where @xmath38 are the components of the angular wavenumber .",
    "the above equations hold for @xmath39 .    in practice , we pixelate the shear measurements into a map of 5@xmath405 arcmin@xmath21 pixels and fourier transform the map .",
    "we then use to obtain @xmath35 and inverse fourier transform to yield our final real - space convergence map . in an ideal scenario , this reconstructed convergence map does not contain an imaginary component",
    ". however , due to noise , the finite area of the map , and masking , a non - zero imaginary component is recovered .",
    "we separate the real and imaginary parts of the measured convergence map into e- and b - modes , or @xmath41 .",
    "the b - mode convergence is a useful diagnostic tool for testing systematics , as it should vanish for real lensing signals on a sufficiently large area .",
    "finally , as the uncertainty in this reconstruction is formally infinite for a discrete set of noisy shear estimates , it is important to apply a filter to remove the high - frequency noise @xcite . in this work",
    "we apply a gaussian filter of different sizes . in the companion paper",
    "@xcite we use simulations to quantify the degradation in @xmath42 and the level of @xmath43 expected from the noise and masking in the data .",
    "we find that our results are consistent with that expected from simulations .",
    "one of the main goals of this work is to cross - correlate the mass map with the foreground galaxy distribution . for this purpose",
    ", we construct a second mass map assuming that the foreground galaxy sample traces the mass distribution  we refer to this map as @xmath44 .",
    "it is constructed using equation with @xmath45 replaced by @xmath46 , the fractional overdensity of galaxy counts . under the assumption of linear bias (  galaxy overdensities are linearly proportional to the total mass overdensities , which is expected to be valid on sufficiently large scales ) , the smoothed @xmath44 is simply a product of the mass map @xmath11 with a constant bias factor . for our foreground galaxy sample ,",
    "the linear bias is valid above 5 - 10 arcmin scales , which is the focus of our study . in practice",
    ", the limited redshift range of our foreground galaxy sample means that we can not expect a perfect estimate of the mass map even if the bias factor were unity .",
    "shows the resulting weighted galaxy map and the e and b - mode convergence maps generated from the procedure described above .",
    "the maps shown are for a gaussian smoothing of 20 arcmin rms .",
    "we expect @xmath42 to correlate with @xmath44 , while @xmath43 should not correlate with either of the other maps .",
    "the @xmath42 map shown in the middle panel of is overlaid with galaxy clusters detected in the same data using the algorithm redmapper @xcite . each cluster",
    "is represented by a circle with radius proportional to the optical richness @xmath47 , which is related to mass via a roughly linear relation ( see @xcite for details of the mass calibration of @xmath47 ) .",
    "we select only clusters with @xmath48 , which corresponds to mass @xmath49 m@xmath50 ( @xmath51 corresponds to mass @xmath52 m@xmath50 ) .",
    "visually , one can see that the spatial distribution of the clusters traces the mass map very well , with most clusters detected in or around the high @xmath42 regions .",
    "we analyze the redshift distributions of the clusters in the high and low mass density regions .",
    "two examples are shown in , where we plot ( in blue ) the lensing efficiency and @xmath47-weighted redshift distribution of the clusters within a 1 degree radius of the identified high and low - mass positions marked in .",
    "compared to the average redshift distribution of clusters ( overlaid in grey ) , we find that the high - mass ( low - mass ) regions indeed contain many more ( fewer ) clusters than average .",
    "the redshift binning is @xmath53=0.03 , corresponding to between 1.53 @xmath54 in this redshift range , where @xmath54 is the cluster photo-@xmath29 error uncertainty .",
    "the photo-@xmath29 s for redmapper clusters are very well determined ( @xmath55 ) , which is important for the identifications of the 3d structures . using these histograms",
    "we can identify potential candidates for super - clusters .",
    "for example , the peak at @xmath56 in the left panel parked in red indicates that this spatial structure is contained in a redshift range localized to within about 100 mpc along the line of sight .",
    "this line of sight has multiple structures at different redshifts , others have just one or two .",
    "the redshift range above @xmath57 ( marked with the shaded grey area ) overlaps with the background sample , hence the interpretation of their relation with the mass map is more complicated .",
    "the largest mass concentrations are investigated in more detail in the companion paper and in follow - up studies .",
    "next , we investigate quantitatively the correlation between the foreground galaxies and the mass map by calculating the pearson correlation coefficient between the two maps over a range of smoothing scales that span 5 to 40 arcmin .",
    "that is , we calculate @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the covariance between @xmath42 and @xmath60 , and @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the standard deviations of the two maps . in this calculation",
    ", pixels in the masked region are not used .",
    "we also remove pixels within 10 arcmin of the boundaries to avoid significant artefacts from the smoothing .",
    "similarly we calculate the pearson correlation coefficient between @xmath43 and the other maps to check for any significant systematic effects .",
    "the errors on the correlation coefficients are estimated by a jackknife resampling of 10 deg@xmath21 sub - regions of the maps ( each jackknife subsample is @xmath63 of the total area ) .",
    "the results are shown in .",
    "we find that the pearson correlation coefficient between @xmath44 and the e - mode convergence is @xmath64 at 10 arcmin smoothing and @xmath65 at 20 arcmin smoothing .",
    "this corresponds to a @xmath66 significance at these scales .",
    "the correlation between the b - mode convergence and the @xmath44 maps is consistent with zero at all smoothing scales .",
    "the correlation between the e and b - modes convergence is also consistent with zero .",
    "the grey shaded regions show the 1@xmath1 range of results from the simulated galaxy catalogs modelled to match the main characteristics of the data samples .",
    "the black data points agree well with the simulations , suggesting there are no significant contributions to our signal from systematic errors .    to further examine the potential contamination by systematics in the maps , we construct maps of 20 quantities associated with the observing conditions (  airmass , extinction , seeing , psf ellipticity etc . ) and cross correlate with our @xmath42 and @xmath44 maps .",
    "we find that none of these quantities contribute significantly to the cross correlation signal we have measured , with most of them consistent with zero .",
    "details are presented in the companion paper .",
    "bounds from simulations for the correlation between the e and b - mode convergence and the foreground galaxies , with the same pixelization and smoothing as the data as well as sources of statistical uncertainty .",
    "the green points show the correlation between e and b - modes of the convergence map .",
    "the various correlation coefficients with the b - mode convergence are consistent with zero .",
    "uncertainties on all measurements are estimated using jackknife resampling . ]",
    "we present in this letter a weak lensing convergence map generated from shear measurements in the 139 deg@xmath21 spt - e field in the dark energy survey science verification data .",
    "the mean redshift of the source galaxies is @xmath67 and corresponds to a comoving distance of 2.9 gpc .",
    "this map probes the projected total mass ( luminous and dark ) , with matter approximately half - way between us and the source galaxies making the most contribution to the lensing .",
    "we study the correlation of the mass map with galaxies and clusters that trace the foreground mass distribution .    the spatial distribution of galaxy clusters identified in the same data using an independent technique is highly correlated with the mass map .",
    "the combination of the mass map and the cluster catalog provide a powerful tool for exploring potential super - clusters and super - voids in the universe .",
    "cross - correlating the e - mode mass map with a magnitude - limited foreground galaxy sample gives a 6.8@xmath1 detection at 20 arcminute smoothing , while the cross correlation between b - mode mass map and the galaxies is consistent with zero on all scales .",
    "the cross - correlation between e and b - mode mass map are also consistent with zero .",
    "these results are consistent with simulations of the @xmath2cdm model in which we have modeled several sources of statistical uncertainties in the lensing and weighted galaxy maps .",
    "more detailed analysis , simulation and systematics tests are described in a companion prd paper @xcite .",
    "topics for follow - up studies include the study of galaxy bias , identification of super - clusters and super - voids , higher order moments of the mass map , and cross - correlation with the cmb and other observations . with the full set of data from des in a few years ( @xmath68 times the size of the sv data used in this work ) , we expect the mass maps to be a powerful tool for cosmology .",
