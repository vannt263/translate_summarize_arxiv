    "the principal goal of the present paper is to develop a formalism of macdonald processes  a class of probability measures on gelfand - tsetlin patterns  and to apply it to studying interacting particle systems and directed random polymers .",
    "our inspiration comes from three sides : the well - known success of the determinantal point processes in general , and the schur processes in particular , in analyzing totally asymmetric simple exclusion processes ( taseps ) and last passage percolation problems ( in one space dimension ) ; the recent breakthrough @xcite in finding exact solutions to the kardar - parisi - zhang stochastic nonlinear pde ( kpz equation , for short ) , based either on tracy - widom s integrability theory for the partially asymmetric simple exclusion process ( pasep ) or on the replica trick coupled with bethe ansatz solutions of the quantum delta bose gas ; and oconnell s description of a certain random directed polymers in terms of eigenfunctions of the quantum toda lattice known as class one whittaker functions ( for root systems of type a ) .",
    "the present work ties these developments together .",
    "the macdonald processes are defined in terms of the macdonald symmetric functions , a remarkable two - parameter family of symmetric functions discovered by macdonald in the late 1980s @xcite .",
    "the parameters are traditionally denoted by @xmath4 . on the diagonal @xmath5 ,",
    "the macdonald symmetric functions turn into the schur functions , and the macdonald processes turn into the schur processes of @xcite . the key feature that makes the schur processes very useful is the determinantal structure of their correlation functions .",
    "this feature is not present in the general macdonald case , which is one reason why macdonald processes have not been extensively studied yet ( see , however , @xcite ) .",
    "we find a way of utilizing the macdonald operators  a sequence of difference operators that are diagonalized by macdonald symmetric functions  for explicit evaluations of averages for a rich class of observables of macdonald processes .    in the case",
    "@xmath1 , these averages lead us to a fredholm determinant representation of a @xmath2-laplace transform of the distribution of the last part of a macdonald - random partition .",
    "the appearance of the fredholm determinant seems remarkable . as to our best knowledge",
    ", the macdonald symmetric functions ( either general ones or those for @xmath1 ) do not carry natural determinantal structures ( as opposed to the schur functions ) .    in a different direction",
    ", we exhibit a family of markov chains that preserve the class of macdonald processes .",
    "the construction is parallel to that of @xcite in the schur case , and it is based on a much earlier idea of @xcite . in the case",
    "@xmath1 , the continuous time version of these stochastic dynamics can be viewed as an interacting particle system in two space dimensions ( whose schur degeneration was studied in @xcite ) .",
    "a certain one dimensional markovian subsystem has a particularly simple description ",
    "it is a @xmath2-deformation of tasep where a particle s jump rate equals @xmath6 , with ` gap ' being the number of open spaces to the right of the particle ; we call it @xmath2-tasep .",
    "the macdonald formalism thus provides explicit expressions for averages of many observables of these interacting particle systems started from certain special initial conditions .",
    "in particular , we obtain a fredholm determinant formula for the @xmath2-laplace transform of the distribution of any particle in @xmath2-tasep started from the so - called step initial condition .",
    "we then focus on asymptotic behavior of certain specializations of the macdonald processes . in what follows",
    ", the parameter @xmath7 is assumed to be 0 .",
    "we find that as @xmath8 , in the so - called plancherel specialization , the particles in the macdonald - random gelfand - tsetlin pattern crystalize onto a perfect lattice ( law of large numbers behavior ) .",
    "the scaled fluctuations of particles around this limiting lattice converge to the whittaker process introduced by oconnell @xcite as the image of the oconnell - yor semi - discrete directed polymer under a continuous version of the tropical rsk correspondence .",
    "the process is supported on triangular arrays of real numbers .",
    "( this degeneration is parallel to the recently discovered degeneration of the macdonald symmetric functions to the class one whittaker function , see @xcite . )",
    "the markov dynamics on macdonald processes converge to dynamics on these triangular arrays which are not the same as those induced by the tropical rsk correspondence , but which were also introduced in @xcite as a geometric version of warren s process @xcite . for a different choice of specialization ,",
    "the fluctuations above converge to another version of the whittaker process introduced in @xcite as the image of sepplinen s log - gamma discrete directed polymer under the tropical rsk correspondence of a.n .",
    "kirillov @xcite .    under the scalings to whittaker processes ,",
    "the fredholm determinant formulas converge to similar formulas for the laplace transform of the partition functions for these polymers ( hence characterizing the free energy fluctuations ) . as one application of these new fredholm determinant formulas we prove ( via steepest descent analysis ) that as time @xmath9 goes to infinity , these polymers are in the kpz universality class , i.e. , their free energy fluctuates like @xmath10 with limiting law given by the tracy - widom gue distribution . under a different scaling , known as intermediate disorder scaling , we show how to recover the laplace transform for the partition function of the point - to - point continuum directed random polymer , i.e. , the solution to the stochastic heat equation with delta initial data , or the exponential of the solution to the kpz equation with narrow wedge initial data .",
    "those familiar with the non - rigorous replica approach of @xcite or @xcite may observe that the unjustifiable analytic continuations and rearrangements necessary to sum the divergent moment series in those works ( a.k.a .",
    "the replica trick ) , can be seen as shadows of the rigorous manipulations and calculations performed at the higher level of the macdonald processes .    from the point of view of the kpz equation , we observe that the @xmath2-tasep may now be used as its ` integrable discretization ' in a similar way as pasep has been used , and we expect to present more results in this direction in future works .",
    "it has been known for a while that moments of exactly solvable polymer models solve certain quantum many body systems with delta interactions .",
    "this fact , together with bethe ansatz computations , has been widely used in physics literature to analyze the polymers .",
    "the formalism of the macdonald processes results in certain explicit integral formulas for those moments , that are thus solutions of the quantum many - body systems .",
    "those contour integral solutions provide a new and seemingly robust ansatz for solving such systems without appealing to the bethe ansatz . as one application we provide new formulas for the solution to the delta bose gas , with the difference between attractive and repulsive interactions only coming in as a sign change in the denominator of our contour integral integrand  a striking contrast with the bethe ansatz approach , where the two cases lead to very different sets of eigenfunctions .",
    "the range of potential applications of these new formulas remains to be investigated .",
    "the introduction below provides a more detailed description of our results .",
    "we would like to note that on many occasions , because of space considerations , the introduction will only give a sample statement , and for the full scale of the result the reader is encouraged to look into the body of the paper ( we provide exact references to relevant statements throughout the introduction ) .",
    "this paper is split into six chapters :    * chapter one is the introduction .",
    "we have attempted to make this fairly self - contained ( at the cost of repeating certain definitions , discussions and results again in the main parts of the paper ) . *",
    "chapter two contains the definition of macdonald processes , the calculation of certain observables as contour integrals , and the development of dynamics which preserve these processes .",
    "additionally , a review of properties of macdonald symmetric functions is provided in this part for the readers convenience .",
    "* chapter three takes the macdonald parameter @xmath1 ( resulting in @xmath2-whittaker processes ) and contains the basic result that @xmath2-laplace transforms of certain elements of these processes are fredholm determinants . specializing the @xmath2-whittaker functions and focusing on a certain projection of the dynamics on the processes results in @xmath2-tasep whose",
    "one - particle transition probabilities are characterized by a fredholm determinant . *",
    "chapter four includes the weak ( in the sense of distribution ) limit @xmath8 of @xmath2-whittaker processes .",
    "two @xmath2-whittaker specializations ( called plancherel and pure alpha ) are focused on .",
    "they lead to whittaker processes which were previously discovered by oconnell @xcite and corwin , oconnell , sepplinen and zygouras @xcite .",
    "laplace transforms for certain elements of those are now given by fredholm determinants , and exponential moments are given by contour integrals of a particularly simple form . using the fredholm determinant ,",
    "a limit theorem is proved showing tracy - widom gue fluctuations . *",
    "chapter five uses the connection developed in @xcite to relate the above mentioned formulas to the study of directed polymers in random media and via another limiting procedure , to the continuum directed random polymer and the kpz equation . *",
    "chapter six shows how the contour integral formulas developed here provide a new ansatz for solving a certain class of integrable quantum many body systems such as the delta bose gas .",

    "we also consider the effect of boundary perturbations to the quenched random media on the limiting free energy statistics .",
    "for the semi - discrete directed polymer , when the drifts of a finite number of the brownian motions forming the quenched random media are critically tuned , the statistics are instead governed by the limiting baik - ben arous - pch distributions @xcite from spiked random matrix theory . for the continuum polymer , the boundary perturbations correspond to choosing the initial data for the stochastic heat equation from a particular class , and likewise for its logarithm  the kpz equation .",
    "the laplace transform formula we prove can be inverted to give the one - point probability distribution of the solution to these stochastic pdes for the class of initial data .    in joint work with patrik ferrari and balint veto @xcite we further extend the class of initial data for which we can compute exact statistics so as to include the equilibrium initial data for the kpz equation .",
    "that is to say , we are able to exactly characterize the distribution of the solution to the kpz equation when started with a two - sided brownian motion and prove that as @xmath7 goes to infinity and under @xmath366 scaling , the one - point probability distribution converges to the @xmath367 distribution of baik and rains .",
    "the @xmath366 scaling for fluctuations associated with this initial data was previously shown in @xcite .",
    "in joint work with daniel remenik @xcite we prove that under @xmath368 scaling , the limiting distribution as @xmath365 of the free energy of sepplinen s log - gamma discrete directed polymer is gue tracy - widom .",
    "the main technical innovation we provide is a general identity between a class of @xmath270-fold contour integrals and a class of fredholm determinants . applying this identity to the integral formula proved in @xcite for the laplace transform of the log - gamma polymer partition function , we arrive at a fredholm determinant which lends itself to asymptotic analysis ( and thus yields the free energy limit theorem ) .",
    "the fredholm determinant was anticipated via the formalism of macdonald processes yet its rigorous proof was so far lacking because of the nontriviality of certain decay estimates required by that approach ( see theorem [ alphalimitthm ] ) .    in joint work with tomohiro sasamoto @xcite",
    "we prove duality relations for two interacting particle systems : @xmath2-tasep and asep .",
    "expectations of the duality functionals correspond to certain joint moments of particle locations or integrated currents , respectively .",
    "duality implies that they solve systems of odes .",
    "these systems are integrable and for particular step and half stationary initial data we use a nested contour integral ansatz to provide explicit formulas for the systems solutions and hence also the moments .",
    "we form laplace transform like generating functions of these moments and via residue calculus we compute two different types of fredholm determinant formulas for such generating functions . for asep ,",
    "the first type of formula is new and readily lends itself to asymptotic analysis ( as necessary to reprove gue tracy - widom distribution fluctuations for asep ) , while the second type of formula is recognizable as closely related to tracy and widom s asep formula @xcite-@xcite . for @xmath2-tasep",
    "both formulas coincide with those computed via the theory of macdonald processes ( in particular see section [ qwhitsecformulas ] and [ qtasepandthe ] below ) .",

[ gammasumlemmaremark ] let us briefly illustrate the application of lemma  [ gammasumlemma ] which is similar to mellin - barnes type integral representations for hypergeometric functions . consider @xmath1178 by including the pole at 0 in lemma  [ gammasumlemma ] one readily checks that for @xmath1165 @xmath1179 and thus for @xmath1165 @xmath1180 the left - hand side is analytic for all @xmath1161 , @xmath913 , while the right - hand side is analytic for @xmath1181 . by analytic continuation ,",
    "the above equality holds for all @xmath1162 .",
    "analytic continuation of the right - hand side to the whole domain of analyticity would require additional means .        in order to apply lemma  [ gammasumlemma ] to the inner summations consider contours @xmath1185 which are negatively oriented semi - circles that contain the right half of a circle centered at @xmath1186 and of radius @xmath133 .",
    "the infinite contour @xmath1187 . by the condition on the contour @xmath1188",
    "we are assured that these finite semi - circles @xmath1189 do not contain any poles beyond those of the gamma function @xmath1190 .",
    "the only other possible poles as @xmath697 varies is when @xmath1191 .",
    "however , the conditions on @xmath1188 and on the contours on which @xmath697 varies show that these poles are not present in the semi - circles @xmath1175 .    in order to apply the above lemma",
    "we must also estimate the integral along the symmetric difference .",
    "identify the part of the symmetric difference given by the semi - circle arc as @xmath1192 and the part given by @xmath1193 as @xmath1194 .",
    "since @xmath1195 it is straight - forward to see that @xmath1196 stays uniformly bounded as @xmath697 varies along these contours .",
    "consider then @xmath1197 .",
    "this is defined by writing @xmath1198 for @xmath1199 and @xmath1200 , and setting @xmath1201 .",
    "writing @xmath1202 we have @xmath1203 .",
    "note that our assumption on @xmath1095 corresponds to @xmath1120 and @xmath1204 . concerning the product of gamma functions ,",
    "recall euler s gamma reflection formula @xmath1205 one readily confirms that for all @xmath697 : @xmath1206 for some @xmath1207 fixed , @xmath1208 for a fixed constant @xmath1209 which depends on @xmath1210 .",
    "therefore , along the @xmath1194 contour , @xmath1211 and since @xmath1204 is fixed , this product decays exponentially in @xmath1212 and the integral goes to zero as @xmath133 goes to infinity . along the @xmath1192 contour",
    ", the product of gamma functions still behaves like @xmath1213 for some fixed @xmath1209 . thus along this contour @xmath1214 since @xmath1120 and @xmath1215 these terms behave like @xmath1216 ( @xmath1217 fixed ) along the semi - circle arc .",
    "clearly , as @xmath133 goes to infinity , the integrand decays exponentially in @xmath133 ( versus the linear growth of the length of the contour ) and the conditions of the lemma are met .",
    "* step 3 : * in order to analytically extend our formula we must prove two facts .",
    "first , that the left - hand side of equation ( [ thmlaplaceeqn ] ) is analytic for all @xmath1220 ; and second , that the right - hand side determinant is likewise analytic for all @xmath1220 ( and in doing so that the operator is trace class on that set of @xmath1095 ) .      observe that for any @xmath1223 , within a neighborhood of @xmath1095 the infinite products are uniformly convergent and bounded away from zero . as a result",
    "the series is uniformly convergent in a neighborhood of any such @xmath1095 which implies that its limit is analytic , as desired .    turning to the fredholm determinant ,",
    "let us first check that we are , indeed , justified in writing the infinite series as a fredholm determinant ( i.e. , the @xmath163 is trace - class ) .",
    "we use the conditions given in lemma  [ traceclasscrit ] which requires that we check that @xmath1224 is continuous simultaneously in both @xmath985 and @xmath1225 , as well as that the derivative of @xmath1224 in the second entry is continuous in @xmath1225 . both of these facts are readily checked .",
    "in fact , since we have a uniformly and exponentially convergent elementary integral , it and all its derivatives in @xmath985 and @xmath1225 are continuous .",
    "this is because differentiation does not affect the exponential decay .    in order to establish that the fredholm determinant @xmath1219 is an analytic function of @xmath1095 away from @xmath170 we appeal to the fredholm expansion and the same criteria that limits of uniformly absolutely convergent series of analytic functions are themselves analytic .",
    "there exist theorems ( such as in @xcite section iv.1 , property 8 , or in the appendix of @xcite ) which show that if a trace - class operator is an analytic function of a parameter @xmath1095 , then so if the determinant .",
    "however , the analyticity of the operator must be shown in the trace - class norm which tends to be involved .",
    "since we are already dealing directly with fredholm series expansions , we find it more natural to prove analyticity directly from the series rather than try to appeal to these results .",
    "returning to the issue at hand , recall that @xmath1226 it is clear from the definition of @xmath163 that @xmath1227 is analytic in @xmath1095 away from @xmath170 .",
    "thus any partial sum of the above series is analytic in the same domain .",
    "what remains is to show that the series is uniformly absolutely convergent on any fixed neighborhood of @xmath1095 not including @xmath170 . towards this end",
    "consider the @xmath1228 term in the fredholm expansion : @xmath1229 we wish to bound the absolute value of this .",
    "observe that uniformly over @xmath1230 and @xmath129 the term @xmath1231 for some fixed constant @xmath1232 .",
    "now consider the determinant .",
    "along the contours for @xmath697 and @xmath985 the ratio @xmath1233 is uniformly bounded in absolute value by a constant @xmath1234 . by hadamard s bound @xmath1235    taking the absolute value of ( [ fredexpbound ] ) and bringing the absolute value all the way inside the integrals",
    ", we find that after plugging in the results of ( [ pochbound ] ) and ( [ detbound ] ) latexmath:[\\ ] ] where the @xmath115-contour is along @xmath360 for any @xmath2643    [ endansatzcomment ] the contour integral formulas used to solve the quantum many body systems in proposition  [ adbgprop ] and proposition  [ discdbg ] should be understood as coming about from a more general contour integral ansatz .",
    "the correspondence is as follows .",
    "consider a many body system which evolves in a weyl chamber according to a certain pde and has delta function initial condition .",
    "assume it also has a boundary condition on the boundary of the weyl chamber involving consecutively labeled particles .",
