    "the ` supersoft ' x - ray sources form a new and exciting but inhomogeneous class of x - ray objects . though a few members of the class were known before rosat , it is this observatory which has characterised the class as objects with temperatures of 15  80 ev and luminosities approaching the eddington limit for a solar mass object , i.e. @xmath2  @xmath3 erg s@xmath1 .",
    "the model which best fits the observations has a white dwarf steadily or cyclically burning hydrogen - rich material accreted onto its surface at @xmath4 m@xmath5 yr@xmath1 ( van den heuvel et al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "van den heuvel et al .",
    "( @xcite ) theorise that this material may be supplied by a near main - sequence a / f companion star , more massive than the white dwarf and in a close binary orbit , which is overflowing its roche lobe .",
    "such systems are known as close binary supersoft sources ( cbss ) , for further discussion of the nature of the class see kahabka & van den heuvel ( @xcite ) .",
    "35 supersoft x - ray sources have so far been identified within our galaxy , m31 , the local group galaxy ngc 55 , the lmc & smc ( listed in kahabka & van den heuvel @xcite ) . of these systems",
    "( hereafter rx j0019 ) is the only northern hemisphere cbss identified , so far , in our galaxy .",
    "rx j0019 is a close binary with a 15@xmath685 period and both short - term and long - term optical variability , with orbital variability of @xmath7 ( beuermann et al .",
    "@xcite , hereafter b95 ; greiner & wenzel @xcite ) .",
    "ubvri photometry at photometric maximum and minimum reveal a very blue continuum , in common with other cbss .",
    "the optical and uv spectra show balmer @xmath8 and he ii lines , especially @xmath91640,4686 , in emission with enhanced blue wings , but no he i lines ( b95 ) .",
    "balmer @xmath10 and @xmath11 lines exhibited p - cygni type profiles .",
    ".spectroscopic and photometric jhk magnitudes and spectral indices .",
    "jhk fluxes were obtained from spectra by fitting the continua with low order polynomials and letting the flux be the value of the fit at 1.25 , 1.6 and 2.2 @xmath0 m .",
    "the photometric phases were calculated using the ephemeris of will & barwig ( @xcite ) .",
    "the spectral index , @xmath8 , was calculated for spectra dereddened by e(b  v)=0.1 . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      no photospheric absorption lines are seen in the infrared spectrum taken at minimum light , indicating that either the underlying spectral type of the donor is not later than f , we are seeing the system at low inclination and irradiation is supressing absorption , or the accretion disc is dominating the emission . through the optical and ir to at least 2.4",
    "@xmath0 m the orbital modulation of flux appears to be nearly constant , implying that they are dominated by the same component .",
    "the continuum is flatter than that expected for a stellar photosphere , suggesting the accretion disc is dominant .    given the variability of the source over a variety of timescales ( greiner & wenzel @xcite ) , simultaneous multiwavelength observations of rx j0019 would be necessary to properly determine the relative contribution of light sources , and consequently place constraints on the spectral class of the donor , inclination of and distance to the system .",
    "one explanation of the satellite lines to p@xmath11 , p@xmath10 and",
    "br@xmath11 is that they are the infrared signature of jets , similar to the doppler shifted components of the balmer @xmath8 , @xmath10 and he ii @xmath124686  lines of another supersoft source , ( hereafter rx j0513 , crampton et al .",

    "we fitted each of these three composite lines profiles with three gaussians .",
    "the details of these gaussians are given in table [ tab : jets ] .",
    "the mean separation of the satellite lines from the core is @xmath14 km s@xmath1 , and their mean fwhm is @xmath15 km s@xmath1 . assuming the jet interpretation is correct , and the jets are perpendicular to an accretion disc which lies in the plane of the binary , the true velocity of the outflow is simply a function of the inclination angle ( @xmath16 km s@xmath1 . ) .",
    "following shahbaz et al .",
    "( @xcite ) we can also estimate the opening angle of the jet , @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the fwhm of the satellite lines and @xmath19 the observed velocity .",
    "meyer - hofmeister et al .",
    "( @xcite ) model orbital modulation of the system with a best - fit inclination of 56@xmath20 , corresponding to a outflow velocity of @xmath21 km s@xmath1 and an opening angle of 28@xmath20 .",
    "hachisu & kato ( @xcite ) model outbursts of the source with an inclination of 45@xmath20 , corresponding to a velocity of @xmath22 km s@xmath1 and a very large opening angle of 45@xmath20 .",
    "an inclination angle of around 75@xmath20 would be required to derive the same velocity as the jet in rx j0513 , and would imply a much more collimated jet ( @xmath23 ) . alternatively the lower jet velocity could be intrinsic and reflect the lower escape velocity required from a lower mass white dwarf . indeed hachisu & kato ( @xcite ) argue for a mass of around 0.6 m@xmath24 for the white dwarf in rx j0019 , around half that estimated for rx j0513 ( southwell et al .",

    "they have found transient satellite lines around hydrogen and he ii lines in optical spectra of rx j0019 .",
