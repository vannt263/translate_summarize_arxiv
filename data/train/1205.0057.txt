    "this paper addresses the pace of marathons over courses with significant elevation changes ( i.e. hills ) .",
    "the analysis starts by reporting the observed change in the pace of marathon runners on flat courses reported by myers and higdon @xcite .  here",
    "pace refers to the amount of time a runner takes to run a mile .",
    "the units , following the conventions of marathon running in the united states , are generally minutes per mile .",
    "then a crude analysis of the energetic costs of running hills is given .",
    "this analysis takes into account the energy cost of moving the runner both horizontally and vertically in an approximate fashion .",
    "next , the pace predicted by myers and higdon is adjusted to take into account the elevation changes of the 2012 oakland marathon course .",
    "an example for a marathon finishing time of three hour and thirty minute is given .",
    "the results are compared to the pace estimates for the same course given by `` smart pace bands '' from `` races2remember''@xcite .",
    "finally , the paces of 23 finishers of the 2012 oakland marathon are examined .  the average and individual splits of those 23 runners",
    "are compared to the splits predicted by the myers hill corrected prediction based on the average finish time .",
    "here `` split '' refers the time taken by a finisher to run a mile in the course of the marathon .",
    "the times are generally reported in the conventional form for marathon running of hours : minutes : seconds ( h : m : s ) and paces and splits are reported in minutes : seconds ( m : s ) per mile .",
    "in the book  marathon  the ultimate training guide \" by hal higdon @xcite , an analysis by an engineer and marathon runner named goerge myers examines the pace of elite marathon runners over the course of a marathon .",
    "myers observed that there were some standard variations in the average pace of an elite marathon finisher that could roughly be broken up into the four regions shown in table  [ table1 ] .",
    ".myers pace regions and factors [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table4 ]    the values of @xmath0 suggest that the energy loss due to compression effects of the human body is small ( and consistent with zero ) during flat or uphill running .",
    "however , while running downhill the energy loss is approximately @xmath1% .",
    "this phenomenon should explain the discrepancy at mile 11 noted above and shown in fig .",
    "[ om2012-comp1.eps ] .  from mile 10 to mile 11",
    "there is a net decrease in elevation and this net decrease is the only factor in determining the elevation adjustment to the pace as determined via eq .",
    "( [ pace2 ] ) ; the actual path of the runner up and down over the course of a mile does not matter .",
    "however , if eq .",
    "( [ pace3 ] ) is used , then the actual path of the runner up and down does matter since @xmath0 breaks the up and down symmetry .    unfortunately , fig .",
    "[ om2012-comp1a1s.eps ] shows that the fits using eq .",
    "( [ pace3 ] ) fail to match the actual finshers splits for mile 11 .",
    "table  [ table4 ] shows the deviation in the predicted pace and the actual pace , @xmath2pace , for the two methods .  using eq .",
    "( [ pace3 ] ) instead of eq .",
    "( [ pace2 ] ) does lead to a 6.6 second decrease in the deviation , but that is only 13.5% of the observed deviation .",
    "the deviation in the observed and predicted pace of mile 11 is an open question .",
    "it may be possible that the elevation profile used here ( and shown in fig .",
    "[ om2012a-01 ] ) is inaccurate between mile ten and mile 11 .",
    "some evidence for this can be seen in fig .",
    "[ om2012-330.eps ] where the _ spb _ estimate for the pace of mile 11 ( filled green triangles and green line ) is slower than the pace of mile ten .",
    "this is the opposite of the pace estimate from eq .",
    "( [ pace2 ] ) ( blue squares and blue line ) in fig .  [ om2012-330.eps ] .",
    "other than tha the first mile , mile 11 and after mile 12 ( where eq .",
    "( [ pace2 ] ) takes into account the pace slowing effects that myers noted , which was not taken into account by the _",
    "estimate ) the trend of the pace change from one mile to the next is similar between the two estimates .",
    "an approximate treatment of the effects of elevation changes on the pace of marathon runners was presented .",
    "it was seen that a good approximation of 23 finishers of the 2012 oakland marathon was made using eq .",
    "( [ pace2 ] ) .  some crude corrections for compression effects of the human body",
    "were made leading to an improved agreement between eq .",
    "( [ pace3 ] ) and the faster finishers .",
    "this analysis can be used to plan a strategy for runners of marathon courses with significant elevation changes ( hills ) .",
    "improvements to the analysis presented here could be achieved with a better approximation to the energy cost of flat and uphill and down hill running .",
    "more data consisting of the splits of more runners on more marathon course would also improve estimates of @xmath0 ."
