    "it follows that the interlacement graphs of euler systems of @xmath0 form an orbit under simple local complementation . from a combinatorial point of view",
    "this naturality  of interlacement graphs is intuitively satisfying : the euler systems of @xmath0 must share some structural features , as they coexist in @xmath0 , and these shared structural features are reflected in shared structural features of their interlacement graphs .",
    "many researchers have studied simple local complementation in the decades since kotzig founded the theory ; the associated literature is large and quite fascinating .",
    "we do not presume to summarize this body of work , but we might mention that intrinsic properties distinguish the simple graphs that arise as interlacement graphs from those that do not @xcite and that 4-regular graphs with isomorphic interlacement graphs are closely related to each other @xcite .",

    "we developed the modified interlacement machinery hoping to extend this multiplicative naturality to arbitrary circuit partitions and euler systems , as in corollary [ bigcor ] .",
    "we are grateful to r. brijder for pointing out that matrices like the modified interlacement matrices appear in the discussion of interlace polynomials given by aigner and van der holst @xcite ; their theorem 4 includes an implicit form of the circuit - nullity formula ( [ circnull ] ) , but none of the other results we have presented appear there .",
    "we should also note that versions of corollary [ invcor ] have appeared in the earlier literature : jaeger @xcite proved the special case in which the euler systems do not involve the same transition at any vertex , bouchet @xcite provided a different proof of the even more special case in which the euler systems involve only each others @xmath57 transitions , and a general result for relative interlacement matrices appeared in @xcite . without naturality , though , the proofs of these results are considerably more intricate than that of corollary [ invcor ] .",
