    "detailed spin evolution on long time scales has been made available for several accretion - powered x - ray pulsars such as 4u 1626 - 67 , gx 1 + 4 , and oao 1657 - 415 ( for comprehensive reviews and data , see e.g. chakrabarty et al .",
    "1993 , chakrabarty 1995 , and references therein ) .",
    "these systems have shown puzzling abrupt spin reversals . before and after the observed torque reversals , their spin - up and spin - down torques were largely steady .",
    "it is intriguing that the spin - up and spin - down torques before and after reversals are nearly identical .",
    "these reversals are quite different from the random torque fluctuations seen in some pulsar systems believed to be fed by winds ( e.g. nagase 1989 , anzer & brner 1995 , and references therein ) .",
    "the nearly steady torques plausibly indicate the existence of ordered accretion disks .",
    "the observations indicate that the mass accretion rate is gradually modulated with small amplitudes on a time scale of at least a year , which is much longer than the typical reversal time scale .    in the disk - magnetosphere interaction models of the ghosh - lamb type ( ghosh & lamb 1979ab , campbell 1992 , yi 1995 , wang 1995 ) ,",
    "the magnetic torque is a function of the mass accretion rate , @xmath2 .",
    "the sign of the torque is reversed ( spin - up / down ) as @xmath2 varies when the disk inner edge moves past the equilibrium radius at which the torque vanishes ( e.g. lipunov 1992 ) . in this picture , however , the torque variation is expected to be smooth and continuous unless @xmath2 varies discontinuously .",
    "although this behavior may be relevant for some smooth torque reversals , the observed sudden reversals appear distinct ( chakrabarty 1995 ) . given the lack of any plausible mechanism for discontinuous change of @xmath2 , which must be tuned to occur near spin equilibrium , it is difficult for the existing magnetized disk models to provide an explanation .",
    "the observations indicate that the mass accretion rates vary little during transition ( cf .",
    "chakrabarty 1995 ) , which makes the discontinuous change of @xmath2 unlikely as an explanation .    in this letter",
    ", we propose a possible explanation for the observed sudden torque reversal .",
    "we take the neutron star moment of inertia @xmath3 , radius @xmath4 , and mass @xmath5 . at a cylindrical radius @xmath6 from the star , the vertical component of the dipole magnetic field @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the stellar surface field strength .",
    "the spin period is @xmath9 or angular velocity @xmath10 .",
    "in the conventional disk - magnetosphere interaction model of the ghosh - lamb type ( ghosh & lamb 1979ab ) , the magnetic field of an accreting neutron star penetrates a geometrically thin accretion disk and exerts a magnetic torque . except in a narrow region near the radius where the disk is disrupted",
    ", it is assumed that the accretion disk rotation is keplerian , @xmath11 , the radial internal pressure gradient is small , the radial drift velocity is small , and the disk thickness becomes negligible ( campbell 1992 , yi 1995 , wang 1995 and references therein ) .",
    "in such a model , the @xmath12 component of the induction equation in steady state gives the azimuthal component of the field b_(r)=_*-_k(r)_k(r)b_z(r ) .",
    "where we have assumed that the internal viscosity and the magnetic diffusivity are due to a single turbulent process . here",
    "we will assume that @xmath13 , defined as the ratio of @xmath6 to the vertical velocity shear length scale @xmath14 , is @xmath15 ( e.g. campbell 1992 , yi 1995 ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath16 is the usual viscosity parameter ( e.g. frank et al .",
    "1992 ) and we take @xmath17 .",
    "although we adopt specific values of @xmath13 and @xmath16 , the constraints on @xmath8 could always be rescaled in such a way that the exact individual values of the three parameters are not necessary ( e.g. kenyon et al . 1996 ) .",
    "the inner edge of the disk , where the disk is magnetically disrupted , is at @xmath18 determined by the condition that the magnetic torque exceeds the internal torque in the disk ( campbell 1992 , yi 1995 , wang 1995 ) which can be expressed as ( r_or_c)^7/2=2n_c(gm_*r_c)^1/2 where @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 is the keplerian corotation radius . integrating the magnetic torque over the disk , and allowing for the angular momentum carried by the gas which crosses the inner edge of the disk ,",
    "the torque exerted on the star by the disk is n=76n_01-(8/7)(r_o",
    "/ r_c)^3/21-(r_o / r_c)^3/2 where @xmath22 ( campbell 1992 , yi 1995 , wang 1995 ) and @xmath23 as @xmath24 approaches the equilibrium point @xmath25 .",
    "this estimate is based on the assumption that there is a negligible flux of angular momentum from @xmath26 .",
    "most of the contribution to the torque in this type of model comes from field - disk interaction in a narrow region just outside of @xmath27 .",
    "several different phenomenological descriptions of disk - magnetosphere interaction cause little practical differences to our conclusions ( wang 1995 ) .",
    "1(a ) presents an example of the typical smooth torque reversal expected in the models of the ghosh - lamb type is shown .",
    "this example is based on a set of parameters similar to what we adopt below for 4u 1626 - 67 .",
    "it is clear that any densely sampled spin evolution would reveal a gradual and continuous variation of the torque , a generic prediction of the ghosh - lamb type model .",
    "a sudden torque reversal with nearly constant @xmath28 is hard to explain unless there exists an unknown constraining mechanism or the @xmath2 variation is discontinuous and fine - tuned .",
    "it is possible that some observed smooth torque reversals ( chakrabarty 1995 ) could be due to this type of reversal model .    under suitable conditions the inner parts of the accretion disk may evolve to an optically thin , low density state , for example , inside the disk boundary layer around a white dwarf ( e.g. paczynski 1991 , narayan and popham 1993 ) .",
    "when @xmath29 is sufficiently small this transition may occur over a broad range of radii within a disk , producing a state in which radiative losses are so inefficient that the disk retains a large fraction of the heat generated from the dissipation of orbital energy ( the ` advective state ' , cf .",
    "narayan and yi 1995 ) .",
    "the transition to this state is not well understood , and may be affected by various external factors , including x - ray irradiation ( e.g. meyer & meyer - hofmeister 1990 ) and coronal heating ( meyer & meyer - hofmeister 1994 ) .    here",
    "we will assume that , whatever the details of the transition , the disk will make the jump to a low density state when it becomes possible for it to do so .",
    "what is the critical @xmath30 below which the disk becomes hot and optically thin ?",
    "observationally , weakly magnetized cataclysmic variables generally show a trend in which the x - ray to optical flux ratio decreases as @xmath2 increases . above a critical rate of @xmath31 , the x - ray emission becomes extremely weak .",
    "this has been attributed to the transition of the inner region to an optically thin ( x - ray emitting ) hot accretion disk ( patterson & raymond 1985 , narayan & popham 1993 ) at low @xmath2 .",
    "interestingly , such a critical rate is largely consistent with the critical rate @xmath32 or @xmath33 for @xmath34 based on the recently discussed advection - dominated hot accretion disks ( narayan & yi 1995 ) . for a given accretion rate ,",
    "there exists a critical radius inside of which the disk makes a transition to sub - keplerian while the disk at radii larger than the critical radius remains keplerian ( narayan & yi 1995 ) . the exact location of this critical radius is not clearly understood yet .",
    "we assume that most of the magnetic torque contribution comes from the inner region ( e.g. wang 1995 ) which is inside the critical radius , e.g. @xmath35 .",
    "the relevance of the critical @xmath30 for the cataclysmic variables becomes more striking when we consider strongly magnetized neutron star systems .",
    "the inner edge of the accretion disk around a strongly magnetized neutron star lies roughly at @xmath36 which is close to the typical white dwarf radius .",
    "therefore , one may ask what would be the effects of the transition , at @xmath37 , to the hot optically thin accretion disk on the spin evolution of the pulsars ?",
    "we propose an explanation for the torque reversal based on such a transition . the optically thin , hot accretion disk can not be geometrically thin or keplerian once its internal pressure @xmath38 becomes a significant fraction of its orbital energy . after the transition , the disk thickness @xmath39 and radial drift velocity @xmath40 increase .",
    "the rotation of the accretion disk @xmath41 becomes sub - keplerian @xmath42 ( e.g. narayan & yi 1995 ) . in the case of strongly magnetized pulsars , direct x - ray observation of such",
    "a disk transition is difficult because most of the x - ray luminosity , @xmath43 , comes from the surface of the star and the luminosity from the disk , which is truncated well above the stellar surface , is limited to @xmath44 .",
    "the sub - keplerian disk , however , may have observable dynamical consequences .",
    "once the sub - keplerian rotation is forced on the magnetosphere , the ( sub - keplerian ) corotation radius is shifted inward and the position of the disk inner edge with respect to the new corotation radius is relocated .",
    "( in principle , the inner edge of the disk could end up beyond the new corotation radius but this would not account for the observed properties of the torque reversal systems . ) as a result , the magnetic torque changes and there could be a visible change of spin - up / down torque on the disk transition time scale .    if such a transition does occur at a certain critical rate , the most likely time scales are the local thermal time scale @xmath45 or the disk viscous - thermal time scale @xmath46 for @xmath34 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 ( e.g. frank et al .",
    "this is plausible if the transition is mainly driven by the thermal instability of the local optically thin region of the accretion flow accompanied by the disk density change on the local viscous - thermal time scale ( cf .",
    "meyer & meyer - hofmeister 1994 ) .",
    "in fact , the viscous time scale for the thin disk is unrealistically long , since the relevant infall time is the one for the hot , and thick disk , which will be only a few orbital times . in any case , these time scales indicate that the local disk surface density change could occur on a time scale short enough , much less than a day , to make the transition appear almost instantaneous .",
    "the long term gradual @xmath2 modulation determines the overall evolutionary trend and possibly affects the residuals seen in some observations ( cutler et al .",
    "1986 , chakrabarty 1995 ) .",
    "the sudden torque reversal does not require any short term ( @xmath49 ) change of @xmath2 but only that the condition @xmath50 be satisfied around the time of reversal .    in order to model the reversal episode ,",
    "we assume no dynamic vertical motion of the disk gas such as winds or outflows . the dominant effect of the transition is to reset the corotation radius and disk truncation radius @xmath27 .",
    "we take the temperature of the sub - keplerian hot disk to be a constant fraction @xmath51 of the local virial temperature , i.e. @xmath52 ( e.g. narayan & yi 1995 )",
    ". then the ratio of the disk thickness to radius is @xmath53 and the radial drift velocity is @xmath54 . using the radial component of the momentum equation ( e.g. campbell 1992 ) , we get the sub - keplerian rotation frequency @xmath55 where @xmath56 corresponds to the usual keplerian limit .",
    "we note that @xmath57 and @xmath58 . assuming a constant @xmath51 or @xmath59 , after the transition to the sub - keplerian rotation with @xmath60 , the corotation radius becomes @xmath61 and the new inner disk edge is relocated to @xmath62 determined by ( r_o^r_c^)^3=2n_cn_0^ a where @xmath63 .",
    "the torque on the star after the transition is = 76 1-(8/7)(r_o^/r_c^)^3/21-(r_o^/r_c^)^3/2 .",
    "the torque vanishes when @xmath64 as in the keplerian rotation ( eq",
    ". 2 - 3 ) . in our discussions , we take a constant @xmath65 ( e.g. narayan & yi 1995 ) . the parameters @xmath17 and @xmath66",
    "are assumed to be constant before and after the transition .",
    "for the keplerian disk , the equilibrium spin ( @xmath67 in eq .",
    "( 2 - 3 ) ) period is p_eq=[4.9s]()^3/7 ( b_*10 ^ 12g)^6/7(r_*10 ^ 6cm)^18/7 ( m_*1.4m_)^-5/7 ( m10 ^ 16g / s)^-3/7 . for @xmath68 , the equilibrium spin period would become longer by a factor @xmath69 and",
    "the system begins to evolve toward the newly determined equilibrium after transition .",
    "for the spin evolution calculation we integrate the torque equation = -p_*^2i_*[torque ] where torque @xmath70 or @xmath71 depending on the physical state of the inner disk . we take a linear increase or decrease of @xmath2 as an approximation to more complex @xmath2 variations on longer time scales .",
    "the transition occurs on a time scale @xmath72 before and after the transition .",
    "the transition at @xmath73 , which is determined by the fits to the observed spin evolution , is taken to be instantaneous ( cf .",
    "@xmath74 , @xmath75 ) . for each torque reversal event , we adjust @xmath8 , @xmath2 , and the accretion rate time scale , @xmath76 .",
    "we consider three x - ray pulsars for which abrupt torque reversals have been detected . for a given initial spin period @xmath9 , a fit gives a set of the above parameters .    _",

    "the recent batse detection of a sudden torque reversal to spin - down is puzzling due to its very short time scale and the nearly equal spin - up / down rates .",

    "the modulation by the orbital motion on a time scale @xmath109 is plausible in gx 1 + 4 ( chakrabarty 1995 ) but is unlikely in 4u 1626 - 67 ( rappaport et al .",

    "1990 , chakrabarty 1995 ) and oao 1657 - 415 ( chakrabarty et al .",
    "several binary precession time scales ( e.g. thorne et al . 1986 ) and the mass flow oscillation time scale ( induced by x - ray irradiation , meyer & meyer - hofmeister 1990 ) could be relevant for long time scale ( @xmath111 ) modulations . in 4u 1626 - 67",
    "the observed optical and x - ray pulsation frequencies are identical , which has been attributed to the reprocessing of x - rays by accretion disk ( ilovaisky et al .",
    "1978 , chester 1979 ) . the direct x - ray irradiation of the secondary star ( hameury et al .",
    "1986 ) and the disk instability ( e.g. smak 1984 ) may also give rise to @xmath2 modulations in neutron star systems .",
    "( ii ) it is important to quantitatively understand @xmath30 and @xmath112 ( cf . narayan & yi 1995 ) .",
    "( iii ) within our model , the observed smooth transitions back to spin - up ( seen in oao 1657 - 415 and gx 1 + 4 ) could result from the return from the advective to keplerian flow .",
    "the characteristic time scale for such a back transition is likely to be the the viscous disk formation time scale . the observed uv - delay time scale , on the order of a day , in cataclysmic variables ( livio & pringle 1992 ) , may be similar to the postulated reverse transition time scale .",
    "( iv ) it remains unexplained that in gx 1 + 4 the x - ray flux increased during the increase of the spin - down torque ( chakrabarty 1995 ) .",
    "if x - rays come from the shocked polar accretion , as @xmath2 decreases , the x - ray emission temperature and the apparent flux in a fixed x - ray band could decrease due to radiation drag ( e.g. yi & vishniac 1994 ) .",
    "a geometrically thick , but optically thin , inner disk is more apt to scatter x - ray emission , so that a partially obscured polar cap can actually become more conspicuous as @xmath29 drops .",

    "<S> accretion - powered x - ray pulsars 4u 1626 - 67 , gx 1 + 4 , and oao 1657 - 415 have recently shown puzzling torque reversals . </S>",
    "<S> these reversals are characterized by short time scales , on the order of days , nearly identical spin - up and spin - down rates , and very small changes in x - ray luminosity . </S>",
    "<S> we propose that this phenomenon is the result of sudden dynamical changes in the accretion disks triggered by a gradual variation of mass accretion rates . </S>",
    "<S> these sudden torque reversals may occur at a critical accretion rate @xmath0 @xmath1 when the system makes a transition from ( to ) a primarily keplerian flow to ( from ) a substantially sub - keplerian , radial advective flow in the inner disk . for systems near spin equilibrium , </S>",
    "<S> the spin - up torques in the keplerian state are slightly larger than the spin - down torques in the advective state , in agreement with observation . </S>",
    "<S> the abrupt reversals could be a signature of pulsar systems near spin equilibrium with the mass accretion rates modulated on a time scale of a year or longer near the critical accretion rate . </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting that cataclysmic variables and black hole soft x - ray transients change their x - ray emission properties at accretion rates similar to the pulsars critical rate . </S>",
    "<S> we speculate that the dynamical change in pulsar systems shares a common physical origin with white dwarf and black hole accretion disk systems .    </S>",
