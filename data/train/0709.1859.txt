    "the cornerstone work by kramers ( for a comprehensive review see ref .",
    "@xcite ) has instigated an ever ongoing interest in the dynamics of escape processes of single particles , of coupled degrees of freedom or of small chains of coupled objects out of metastable states . in undergoing an escape",
    "the objects considered manage to overcome an energetic barrier , separating the local potential minimum from a neighboring attracting domain .",

    ", noise - assisted  escape is the predominant phenomenon being studied in statistical physics",
    ". then , the system energy fluctuates while permanently interacting with a thermal bath .",
    "this causes dissipation and local energy fluctuations and the process is conditioned on the creation of a rare optimal fluctuation which in turn triggers an escape @xcite .",
    "in other words , an optimal fluctuation transfers sufficient energy to the chain so that the latter statistically overcomes the energetic bottleneck .",
    "characteristic time - scales of such a process are determined by the calculation of corresponding rates of escape out of the domain of attraction . in this realm , many extensions of kramers escape theory and of first passage time problems in over- and underdamped versions have been widely investigated @xcite .",
    "early generalizations to multi - dimensional systems date back to the late @xmath0 s @xcite .",
    "this method , nowadays , is commonly utilized in biophysical contexts and for a great many applications occurring in physics and chemistry @xcite-@xcite .    with this work we present a different scenario of a possible exit from a metastable domain of attraction which has recently been put forward in ref .",

    "_ purely deterministic _ dynamics of a linearly coupled chain of nonlinear oscillators . put differently",
    ", no additional coupling to a thermal bath promotes the escape .",
    "henceforth , dissipation vanishes as well within this set up .",
    "the underlying mechanism to create an escape is caused solely by the strongly nonlinear hamiltonian deterministic dynamics .",
    "we explore macroscopic discrete , coupled nonlinear oscillator chains with up to @xmath1 links .",
    "these may appear as realistic models in mechanical and electrical systems , in various biophysical contexts , in neuroscience , or in networks of coupled superconductors , to name but a few @xcite-@xcite .",

    "an initially , almost homogeneous chain is able to generate spontaneous structural modulations .",
    "this process proceeds in a self - organized manner .",
    "more specifically , due to the modulational instability , unstable growing nonlinear modes give rise to the formation of coherent structures @xcite such that the originally uniformly distributed energy becomes concentrated to a few degrees of freedom . with regard to nonlinear localization phenomena",
    "_ intrinsic localized modes or discrete breathers _",
    ", such as time - periodic and spatially localized solutions of nonlinear lattice systems , have turned out to present the archetype of localized excitations in numerous physical situations @xcite-@xcite .",
    "an escape is related to a crossing of a saddle point in configuration space , corresponding to a bottleneck @xcite or a transition state .",
    "the latter is associated with an activation energy @xmath2 to be concentrated in the critical localized mode .",
    "we will show that the critical localized mode can be reached in the microcanonical situation spontaneously @xcite .",
    "thus , we encounter a self - organized creation of the transition state which is in clear contrast to noise activated escape .",
    "in particular , we demonstrate that intrinsic _ nonlinear effects _ on a long discrete chain of @xmath3 units induce a transition over an energetic barrier by enhancing one , or several localized breather states @xcite-@xcite . due to this mechanism",
    "the initially almost uniformly distributed energy is dynamically concentrated by use of an internal redistribution ; no assistance of energy exchange with a thermal bath is thus needed .",
    "we show as well that the nonlinear mechanism of energy localization may promote a _",
    "faster _ escape dynamics as compared to the noise - assisted situation where the system experiences an enduring stochastic forcing .",

    "this mechanism will be elaborated on in the next section .",
    "it is well established that the formation of localized excitations in nonlinear systems can be caused by a modulational instability @xcite-@xcite .",
    "this mechanism initiates an instability of an initial plane - wave when small perturbations of non - vanishing wave numbers are imposed .",

    "in order to enhance the energy localization in the dynamics of eq.([eq : qdot ] ) we propose the following scenario : an amount of energy @xmath54 is applied per unit which allows the activation of nonlinear , self - organized excitations of the chain .",

    "the question then is , does such an escaped unit continue its excursion beyond the barrier or can it even be pulled back into the bound chain formation ( @xmath86 ) by the restoring binding forces exercised by its neighbors ? on the other hand , the unit that has already escaped from the potential well might drag neighboring ones closer to or , in the extreme , even over the barrier .",

    "[ fig : pattern ]  ( b ) ] the energy is more strongly localized ( fewer humps and of higher height ) than in the case of @xmath160 [ fig .",
    "[ fig : pattern ]  ( a ) ] . in comparison for @xmath161 [ fig .",
    "[ fig : pattern ]  ( c ) ] the number of humps is further diminished , but they are of lower height than most of the humps for @xmath159 .",
    "in fact , for @xmath159 the energy contained in the unit at site @xmath162 is close to the one of the barrier .",
    "thus , a localized pattern appropriate for escape is provided already by the mechanism of modulational instability . in particular , no further ( major ) energy accumulation , which would delay the escape process considerably ,",
    "is hence required .    to gain further insight into the efficiency of energy localization it is illustrative to suppose that the whole lattice can be divided into a periodic array of ( non - interacting ) segments where each of them supports a single localized hump .",
    "the energy of one segment is determined by @xmath163 defining @xmath164 as the ratio of the energy per segment to the net barrier energy we obtain @xmath165 appropriate conditions for escape are provided when the energy contained in each segment , @xmath166 , is close to the activation energy , @xmath167 , measured in units of the barrier energy  i.e .",
    ", @xmath168 .",
    "the efficiency of energy localization is then determined by the following ratio @xmath169 for a given value of the coupling strength @xmath17 the activation energy is known ; cf . fig .",
    "[ fig : ae ] . fixing the initial energy and using eq .",
    "( [ eq : growthrate ] ) we infer the value of @xmath170 and finally using eqs .",
    "( [ eq : epsilon_qmax ] ) and ( [ eq : chiratio ] ) we obtain @xmath171 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : chi ] the ratio @xmath171 is plotted as a function of the coupling strength @xmath17 .",
    "the plot exhibits a maximum at @xmath172 , which corroborates the finding of the resonance found for the escape versus coupling strength as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : resonance ] .",
    "moreover , the curvature of the graphs of figs .",
    "[ fig : resonance ] and [ fig : chi ] are similar .",
    "we also study the influence of `` size''i.e . , the number of oscillators , @xmath3 , on the escape process .",
    "a general constraint on the escape process arising from varying the chain length is formulated .",
    "we discuss the escape time statistics for chains with constant energy density and for chains with fixed total energy , but varying number of oscillators , respectively .",
    "our studies apply to a homogeneous initial state ( @xmath42 mode ) .",
    "first of all , the initial homogeneous state must become unstable with respect to a modulational instability . with relation ( [ eq : constraint_q ] ) a constraint is established on the allowed wave numbers , giving rise to the modulational instability .",
    "they form a discrete set , and we can derive a lower bound for the number of oscillators , @xmath173 , needed for the onset of the modulational instability : @xmath174 in the case of @xmath175 the initial homogeneous state is always unstable , independent of the number of oscillators , @xmath3 . however , for an initial state in the weakly nonlinear regime , which means @xmath176 , the inequality ( [ eq : number_q ] ) yields a condition for the minimal number of units on the chain that are necessary for modulational instability . on the other hand ,",
    "once the conditions are provided that the chain be able to adopt the transition state , the addition of further lattice sites beyond a certain number leaves the activation energy unaltered .",
    "this is due to the fact that the transition state is represented by the c.l.m . which is strongly localized in space with exponential decaying tails .",
    "let us first consider chains with constant energy density @xmath177 .",
    "one would at first glance expect a faster escape with increasing number of oscillators and thus with increasing total energy .",
    "this is , however , not necessarily the case . for an explanation it is suitable to consider _ the limit of very long chains _ , @xmath178 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : e_long ] the average time for which the _ first _ and _ last _ escape incidents of a unit take place is depicted versus varying chain length @xmath3 .",
    "the averages were performed again over @xmath141 realizations of random initial conditions .",
    "in addition , we as well depict the mean escape time of the chain .",
    "we set the initial coordinates around a mean value of @xmath179 and spread at @xmath78 , yielding @xmath180 .",
    "apparently the longer the chain is , the more humps ( breathers ) that are formed due to the modulational instability .",
    "this offers the possibility that a larger number of interacting breathers contribute to an enhanced energy localization in a confined region of the chain which in turn boosts the formation of the critical localized mode .",
    "hence , the time it takes for the first unit to escape shrinks with increasing chain length , while the last escape time increases due to the enlarged number of escaping units . also , the mean escape time becomes insensitive to variations of the chain length for sufficiently large length @xmath181 , and thus it tends to saturate .",
    "we next consider the situation when a fixed amount of total energy  i.e .",
    ", @xmath182is provided to the system and the number of units on the lattice is varied . to obtain a certain value of @xmath143 upon altering the number of units , @xmath3 , we adopted @xmath58 appropriately while keeping @xmath78 and @xmath79 fixed .",
    "the maximal energy content per unit is restricted to the range @xmath183 .",
    "the results for the mean escape time are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : e_cst ] .",
    "generally , we observe an increase of @xmath146 with growing @xmath3 .",
    "interestingly enough , the slope passes through intermediate stages of sub - exponential , hyper - exponential and eventually approaches an exponential behavior .",
    "in this paper we have explored the conservative and deterministic dynamics of a one - dimensional chain consisting of linearly coupled anharmonic oscillators that are placed into a cubic on - site potential .",
    "attention has been paid to the collective barrier crossing of the whole chain .",
    "initially the system is placed into a metastable state for which all units are trapped near the bottom of the potential .",
    "an overcoming of the barrier of the whole chain is prevented at short initial times because of a too high net barrier height .",
    "nevertheless , as we convincingly demonstrated , the spontaneous formation of localized modes upon evolving time serves to enrich energetically a segment on the chain to such a degree that it adopts the transition state energy in assuming the form of a hairpin .",
    "we have shown that the associated critical localized lattice state is dynamically unstable and eventually a barrier crossing proceeds as the propagation of a kink - antikink - like pair along the chain .",
    "strikingly , there exists a resonant - like coupling strength @xmath17 for which the escape time ( rate ) becomes minimal ( maximal ) , cf .",
    "[ fig : resonance ] .    in view of potential applications",
    "we note that this deterministic collective escape process provides nonlinear systems with the unique possibility to self - promote their activation dynamics .",
    "particularly , the ability to operate efficiently  i.e .",
    ", exhibiting an enhanced collective coherent escape  although not optimally initialized ( meaning that one starts out with a far too low energy density compared to the barrier height ) underpins the beneficial use of this physical scenario .",
    "remarkably , while at weak thermal noise the rate of thermal escape is exponentially suppressed , a deterministic nonlinear breather dynamics yields a robust critical nucleus configuration , which in turn causes an enhancement of the noise - free escape rate .",
    "thus , the freezing out of noise may prove advantageous for transport in metastable landscapes , whenever the deterministic escape dynamics can be launched in a single shot via an initial energy supply .",
