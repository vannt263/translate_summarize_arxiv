    "the australian ska pathfinder ( askap ) is a next generation radio telescope on the strategic pathway towards the staged development of the square kilometre array ( ska ) . in this short conference paper",
    "an overview of askap   is given and a brief description of some indicative science programs .",
    "an expanded write - up of the askap  science case can be found in the refereed papers ( johnston et al .",
    "2007 and johnston et al . 2008 ) .",
    "details and updates for the askap  project generally can be found on the web at http://www.atnf.csiro.au/projects/askap .",
    "askap  has four main goals :    * to demonstrate and prototype technologies for the mid - frequency ska , including field - of - view enhancement by focal - plane phased - arrays on new - technology 12-m class parabolic reflectors ; * to carry out world - class , ground breaking observations directly relevant to the ska key science projects ; * to establish a site for radio astronomy in western australia where observations can be carried out free from the harmful effects of radio interference ; * to establish a user community for the ska .",
    "table  [ intro : params ] gives the askap  system parameters .",
    "the first column gives the relevant parameter with the second column listing the value of that parameter .",
    ".system parameters for askap .",
    "note that the field of view is frequency independent . [ cols=\"<,^ \" , ]     [ intro : speed ]      the central core of askap  will be located at the murchison radio observatory in inland western australia , one of the most radio - quiet locations on the earth and one of only two sites short - listed by the international community as a potential location for the ska ; the second site is located in southern africa .",
    "the approximate geographical coordinates of the site are longitude 116.5 east and latitude 26.7 south .",
    "the choice of site ensures that askap  will be largely free of the harmful effects of radio interference currently plaguing the present generation of telescopes , especially at frequencies around 1  ghz and below .      in early 2008 ,",
    "the askap  test bed antenna was installed at the site of the 64-m parkes radio telescope to allow testing of the focal plane array and beamforming systems . in late 2008 ,",
    "the antenna contract for the 36 askap  dishes was signed .",
    "the first 6 antennas of askap  will be on - site and operational in western australia by late 2010 and constitute the boolardy engineering test array ( beta ) .",
    "over the subsequent two years the remainder of the antennas will be deployed , with commissioning of the final system expected to take place in late 2012 .",
    "following international science meetings held in australia in april 2005 and march 2007 , seven main science themes have been identified for askap . these are extragalactic hi  science , continuum science , polarization science , galactic and magellanic science , vlbi science , pulsar science and the radio transient sky . in this paper , we can do no more than list bullet points for each science section . an extended version of the science case has already been published ( johnston et al .",
    "2007 ) , with larger , and more complete , version of the science case for askap   published in experimental astronomy ( johnston et al . 2008 ) .    the technological innovation of askap  and the unique radio quiet location in western australia will enable a powerful synoptic survey instrument that will make substantial advances in ska technologies and on three of the ska key science projects : the origin and evolution of cosmic magnetism , the evolution of galaxies and large scale structure , and strong field tests of gravity .",
    "the headline science goals for askap  are :    * the detection of a million galaxies in atomic hydrogen emission across 80% of the sky out to a redshift of 0.2 to understand galaxy formation and gas evolution in the nearby universe * the detection of synchrotron radiation from 60 million galaxies to determine the evolution , formation and population of galaxies across cosmic time and enabling key cosmological tests . * the detection of polarized radiation from over 500,000 galaxies , allowing a grid of rotation measures at @xmath0 to explore the evolution of magnetic fields in galaxies over cosmic time . * the understanding of the evolution of the interstellar medium of our own galaxy and the processes that drive its chemical and physical evolution . * the characterization of the radio transient sky through detection and monitoring of transient sources such as gamma ray bursts , radio supernovae and intra - day variables . * the discovery and timing of up to 1000 new radio pulsars to find exotic objects and to pursue the direct detection of gravitational waves . * the high - resolution imaging of intense , energetic phenomena through improvements in the australian and global very long baseline networks .",
    "expressions of interest ( eoi ) for survey science projects closed on december 15 , 2008 .",
    "a total of 38 eois were received , and information on the eois can be obtained from our web pages .",
    "teams submitting successful eois have been invited to submit a full proposal by june 15 , 2009 .",
    "anyone wishing to join teams and participate in askap science should contact the askap project scientists by sending email to atnf-askap-ps@atnf.csiro.au"
