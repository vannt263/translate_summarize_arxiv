    "the photon is one of the basic elementary particles .",
    "this `` horrendous - looking hypothesis of light - quanta '' introduced in 1905 by einstein has been based on the planck s concept of quanta of energy dating from 1900 .",
    "the photon properties , as follows from quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) , are well known : the photon is a massless , chargeless object with a pointlike coupling to the charged fundamental particles . as such , it was used in the past and is still used at present as an ideal tool for probing structure of more complicated objects , for example hadrons , acting as a microscope with the resolution given by its wavelength .    the concept of `` the structure of the light - quanta '' which has appeared later and which is the topic of this work , makes people confused even today .",
    "however it is very natural in the quantum field theory , since a photon , as any elementary particle , can fluctuate into various states consisting of leptons , quarks , @xmath5 bosons , hadrons .... a transition to a particular observed state can be realized as a physical process due to the interaction with another object(s ) , for example , ... _ `` through an interaction with a coulomb field the photon could materialize as a pair of electrons , @xmath6 .",
    "although not usually thought of in these terms , this phenomenon was the earliest manifestation of photon structure '' _ @xcite .",
    "similarly the process @xmath7 leads to the `` hadronic ( partonic ) structure of the photon '' in the perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( pqcd ) .",
    "this notion offers an effective way to describe hard and semihard processes involving photons .",
    "the hadronic properties of the photon become apparent also in the soft photon - hadron interactions , where the similarity between photon and vector mesons @xmath8 interaction is observed .",
    "probing the `` structure '' of the photon can be performed in an analogous way as testing the structure of other objects - once a hard probe is at our disposal , the partonic structure can be revealed .",
    "often the probe happens to be just another photon ( ... `` an ideal tool '' ) .",
    "sometimes this leads to additional complications and even confusion when the partonic content of the photon is discussed .",
    "contrary to the nucleon case , the quark - parton model ( qpm or pm ) gives the definite predictions for the hadronic structure functions @xmath9 for the real photon , and for the related parton densities in the photon .",
    "they exhibit a logarithmic dependence on the @xmath10 scale .",
    "the leading qcd corrections to these quantities can be summed up using the evolution equations , which , due to existence of the inhomogeneous ( pm ) term , can be solved in principle without any input , leading to the so called asymptotic solution . despite this fact evolution equations",
    "are solved usually in an analogous way as for the nucleon , by introducing some experimental or model input , to cure the singular behaviour present in the asymptotic solution .",
    "the gross features of the parton densities in the photon present already in the pm , as the scaling violation and large quark densities at large @xmath11 , are unique for the photon ( in general for gauge bosons ) , therefore they are treated as one of the basic tests of qcd .",
    "this holds to even larger extent for the structure functions of the virtual photon . here",
    "the existence of the second scale , the `` mass '' of the virtual photon , makes it possible , at least in principle , to obtain the qcd predictions in the input - independent way .",
    "the qcd description of all basic processes induced by the real and virtual photons is now available with the nlo accuracy .",
    "basic ideas related to the considered topic are discussed in review articles , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "there are two basic types of inclusive processes where the structure of photon is tested in existing experiments :    * the deep inelastic scattering , dis@xmath1 and dis@xmath12 , where the structure functions for a real and virtual photon are measured , * the large @xmath2 jet ( and particles ) production in @xmath13 and @xmath14 collisions , where individual quark and gluon densities in the photon may be probed ( the so called resolved photon processes ) .",
    "the early experiments of the first type were performed at petra and pep @xmath15 colliders almost twenty years ago , starting with the first measurement by the pluto collaboration @xcite in 1981 .",
    "recent results on the structure function @xmath16 , for a real @xmath17 , based on few years runs at lep1 , at the cm energy @xmath18 , are now available in published or preliminary form . also new data taken at lep 1.5 ( cm energy 130 - 136 gev ) and at lep2 ( 161 - 172 , 183 , 189 and 202 gev ) have been or are being analysed .",

    "the range of the @xmath11 variable extends from @xmath19 0.001 , where the possible rise of the structure function of the real photon can be observed , to 0.98 . in earlier analyses",
    "the charm ( sometimes also bottom ) quark contribution to @xmath16 was subtracted , later on it was included , although with a different treatment than for the light quarks ( only the qpm term ) .",
    "recently the first dedicated measurement of @xmath21 has been performed at lep2 for 0.0014@xmath220.87 and 5@xmath23100 gev@xmath4 .",
    "the measurement of the resolved real photon processes , production of large @xmath2 jets ( also particles ) , started a decade later .",
    "first evidence for the resolved photon process was reported in 1992 by the amy collaboration at tristan @xcite .",
    "data have been and are still being taken in @xmath14 collisions at the abovementioned @xmath15 machines and in the photoproduction processes at the @xmath24 collider hera ( with the cm energy @xmath19 300 - 320 gev ) . the latter one gave first results on the effective parton density ( the light quark distributions combined with the gluon distributions ) and on the gluonic content of the photon , showing the rise at small @xmath25 , a part of the momentum of the photon taken by a parton .",
    "the probed range of @xmath25 is from 0.05 - 0.1 to 1 , where @xmath25 equal to 1 corresponds to the direct interaction of the photon .",
    "the hard scale in such processes , @xmath26 , is usually given by @xmath2 , and the range of the measured @xmath27 @xmath28 extends from @xmath19 20 up to 1000 gev@xmath4 .",
    "there appeared also first data on the prompt photon production , and on the @xmath29 and @xmath30 quark content of the photon , both from @xmath15 and @xmath24 collisions .",
    "an impressive progress has been observed during the last year in the measurements of the `` structure of the virtual photon '' .",
    "fifteen years after the first measurement of the @xmath31 by pluto collaboration @xcite , a new measurement has just been performed at lep .",
    "a large amount of data concerning the resolved virtual photon comes from the @xmath32 collider hera , with the virtualities of the photon spanning the range from 0.1 to 85 gev@xmath4 . here",
    "an effective parton distribution for a virtual photon has been extracted from the dijet production . here",
    "also a new type of analysis related to the forward jet production in events with large @xmath10 ( dis@xmath33-type events ) is being performed , with the aim to test the underlying dynamics of the qcd radiation processes at the small @xmath11 in the proton .",
    "the resolved virtual photon subprocesses contribute here as well and they should be included when describing the forward jet production .",
    "the discrepancies between the data and monte carlo ( mc ) models in the hadronic final states in the photon - induced processes are observed by many collaborations .",
    "they are especially visible in the dis@xmath1 experiments , where there is a need of unfolding , reconstruction of basic kinematical variable @xmath11 from the visible energy of hadronic system @xmath34 .",
    "the improvement in the unfolding has been obtained recently , still the dependence on the chosen mc used in the analysis can not be avoided @xcite .",
    "similar situation , the lack of proper description of hadronic final state , occurs also at the @xmath32 collider hera .",
    "it was found there that implementation of the modified transverse momenta distribution of the partons in the mc programs helps to describe the data .",
    "the same modified mc models have been used recently in analysis of the @xmath15 data from the lep and tristan colliders .",
    "the observed discrepancies may also be a signal of a new production mechanism not included in the standard perturbative qcd analysis , as for example the multiple interaction .",
    "this mechanism , when added , usually improves description of the data , both at the @xmath15 and @xmath32 colliders .",
    "the situation is still not clear and it enforces the advanced study of various aspects of hadron production in the dis@xmath1 setup ( see @xcite ) and in the photon - induced jet production @xcite .",
    "the aim of this survey is to present our knowledge on the structure of the photon , as it stands ad 2000 .",
    "we chose to use the data as a guide through the field .",
    "we collected main results from precision measurements for the unpolarized real and virtual photons , performed during last few years at lep , tristan and hera colliders . in order to show the status and also the progress achieved in this rapidly expanding field of research in high energy physics , we present the very recent ( mainly published ) results , and also some of the previous measurements playing the role of the milestones in the field .",
    "the survey is a collection of short presentations of the various experimental data without much detail on the experimental setup .",
    "only basic information on the type of measurements for each entry , used monte carlo generators and , wherever possible , comparison with the theoretical predictions are given .",
    "this allows to compare different results in an easy way , and also to show various attempts to improve the monte carlo description of the data .",
    "although the collection of the experimental results is the main body of the survey , we found it important to point out the essential aspects of the analyses and to mention also some new theoretical ideas and future measurements .",
    "this survey is an extension of our first attempt @xcitei , which covered the data which appeared up to early 1998 when the first measurements of some quantities related to the structure of photon have appeared , and also some problems in describing data have been recognized .",
    "the present overview contains much more data , and it reports new types of analyses undertaken to solve the observed problems ( already with some positive results ) .",
    "we start with the results of measurements of the hadronic structure function @xmath0 of the unpolarized real photons in dis@xmath1 experiments .",

    "we will not discuss the total cross sections , either for real or virtual photons , nor diffraction phenomena .",
