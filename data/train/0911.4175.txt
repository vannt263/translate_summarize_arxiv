    "a large contribution ( including the casimir repulsion through a vacuum gap for some range of parameters ) was found@xcite using the approximation of frequency - independent @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "later , however , it was shown@xcite that for real materials @xmath16 is nearly equal to unity in the range of frequencies which gives a major contribution to the casimir pressure .",

    "2(b ) , magnetic properties have an important influence on the casimir pressure and even lead to the change of sign of the force ( from attraction to repulsion ) .",
    "this important conclusion can be confirmed analytically in the limiting case of large @xmath0 .",
    "if the metallic properties of au plate are described by the drude model , one obtains @xmath83 this does not depend on the magnetic properties .",
