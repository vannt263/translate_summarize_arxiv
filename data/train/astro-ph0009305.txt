    "there is an apparent deficit in the total density of baryons at moderate and low redshift , @xmath4 , which has come to be called the `` missing baryon '' problem ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "observations of the hydrogen and helium absorption lines in the lyman alpha forest give a baryon density at high redshift ( z @xmath5 3 ) of @xmath6 @xcite , which is consistent with the value @xmath7 derived from standard big bang nucleosynthesis ( * ? ? ?",
    "* a hubble constant of @xmath8 km @xmath9 @xmath10 is used throughout the paper ) . however , in the local universe the baryon budget is far below this number .",
    "summing over all the baryons inside stars , neutral atomic gas and molecular gas gives @xmath11 .",
    "there is a growing consensus that these `` missing baryons '' reside in a hot ( @xmath12 k ) , ionized plasma associated with groups of galaxies .",
    "this is effectively attributing to the universe a mix of components similar to that observed in richer groups and galaxy clusters ( fukugita et al .",
    "1998 ; @xcite ) .",
    "it is plausible that this medium can be enriched in heavy elements .",
    "these heavy elememts would not be fully ionized at the temperatures of interest , as is the cluster gas @xcite .    resonant absorption by a hot",
    ", enriched medium would introduce features in the x - ray spectrum of a distant quasar .",
    "the features would be narrow lines or broad troughs depending on the velocity structure of the absorber .",
    "the associated absorption edges would also be present but are generally much weaker @xcite .",
    "early work by @xcite discusses the x - ray absorption spectrum introduced by a uniformly distributed , hot igm with an admixture of metal atoms via x - ray `` gunn - peterson '' effect . using the same method but with a photoionized model of the igm , @xcite constrain the density and temperature of the igm with _",
    "rosat _ pspc spectra of @xmath13 quasars .",
    "@xcite discusses the detectability of x - ray resonance absorption lines in quasar spectra produced by hot plasma in an intervening galaxy cluster .",
    "more detailed and accurate calculations of cluster absorption were performed by @xcite .    like the lyman alpha forest system in the optical band , the spatial distribution of the galaxy groups and clusters can also produce an `` x - ray forest '' along the line of sight in the x - ray spectrum of a background quasar .",
    "the concept of an `` x - ray forest '' was first suggested by @xcite : x - ray absorption lines are produced by hot intergalactic medium in the form of `` filamentary and sheet - like structures connected to galaxy clusters and groups , as well as colder gas left out in voids . ''",
    "a similar concept was explored by @xcite using the expected spectrum of mass concentrations for a universe dominated by cold dark matter .",
    "the effect of differing cosmologies on the number and evolution of x - ray absorption lines is related to the effect on the number density of clusters @xcite .",
    "this means that x - ray absorption line studies might eventually provide independent constraints on cosmological parameters .",
    "here we build on and extend the approach of @xcite to explore the x - ray forest for various cosmologies and to assess its detectability .",
    "detecting it is not easy .",
    "most of the absorption lines will have equivalent widths @xmath14 ev , and none of the previous x - ray missions ( _ einstein , asca , rosat _ ) had sufficient sensitivity to detect such features in a quasar spectrum .",
    "however , current and future missions give order - of - magnitude advances in sensitivity for the x - ray forest .",
    "for example , _ chandra _ grating spectrometers have resolving powers of 1,000 around 1 kev @xcite with sufficient collecting area to detect an absorption line from an ion column density of approximately @xmath15 in a plausible quasar spectrum . assuming a moderate metal abundance , this column density implies a hydrogen column density of a modest galaxy cluster @xcite .",
    "_ xmm _ and _ constellation - x _ achieve comparable or better energy resolutions with larger effective area . in this paper",
    "we use simulations to assess the ability of these missions to detect features in the x - ray forest .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : section ii gives a semi - analytic calculation of the x - ray forest distribution function , based on press - schechter formalism .",
    "section iii is devoted to the numerical simulation of the distribution function . in section",
    "iv we discuss the detectability of the x - ray forest .",
    "section v presents the conclusions and discussion .",
    "galaxies , galaxy clusters and other large scale structures grow from the initial small scale density fluctuation via gravitional instability .",
    "the small scale fluctuation first grows linearly , until it reaches a critical density .",
    "then it decouples from the hubble expansion , starts collapsing and finally condenses out as a virialized , gravitational bound halo . given a random gaussian distribution , the comoving number density of virialized halos can be described by the press - schechter function : @xmath16here @xmath17 is the mass of the virialized halo ; @xmath18 is the comoving mean density of the universe which is constant during matter domination ; @xmath19 denotes the linearly extroplated overdensity at which an object virializes ; and @xmath20 is the rms density fluctuation inside halos containing a mean mass of @xmath17 .",
    "@xcite first gave this function with a very simple and intuitive model : large scale virialized objects form from the nonlinear interaction of small scale objects through a self - similar condensation process .",
    "however , the original theory suffers the so - called `` cloud - in - cloud '' problem of miscounting the underdense regions properly . @xcite and @xcite extended this model by counting the overdense regions one - by - one and gave the correct normalization of the mass function .",
    "although no direct observational evidence shows that the press - schechter function is the right way to describe the cluster abundance , this function fits n - body simulations extremely well @xcite .    formally one would expect @xmath19 to depend on the cosmological model and the geometry of the collapsing object .",
    "since most of the rich clusters are fairly round it would be a good assumption that the collapse is close to spherical . in a flat universe",
    "spherical collapse gives @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "however , the value of @xmath19 changes by @xmath22 as one goes from an einstein - de sitter universe to an @xmath23 universe @xcite .",
    "so we adopt the value of 1.686 throughout the paper .",
    "the rms mass variance at redshift @xmath4 can be expressed by the present rms mass variance and the linear growth factor @xmath24 through@xmath25 from observations of cluster density in the local universe , several papers give the normalization of the power spectrum at @xmath26 scale @xcite .",
    "here we adopt the value from @xcite .",
    "the present rms mass fluctuation @xmath27 can be calculated by the normalized power spectrum .",
    "a functional fit to @xmath24 is given by @xcite    to apply the press - schechter formalism we need to determine the virial mass of clusters ( @xmath17 ) precisely .",
    "however , measuring the virial mass of clusters is difficult , especially at high redshift .",
    "observationally the x - ray temperature ( @xmath28 ) of galaxy clusters can be measured more accurately .",
    "numerical simulations and observations of x - ray clusters show that there exists a very tight relationship between @xmath28 and @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "to simply we assume a singular isothermal sphere model of the cluster mass density distribution .",
    "the mass - temperature relationship is given by @xcite @xmath29 here @xmath30 is the ratio of the mean cluster density to the critical density at that redshift , @xmath31 is the ratio of the specific kinetic energy to thermal energy , @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the cosmology density parameter at present and redshift of @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "recently various authors show that equation ( 3 ) is accurately obeyed in n - body hydrodynamic simulations with value of @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "although all of them suggest a slightly higher @xmath31-value , it might be due to the incomplete thermalization of the intracluster gas , or the gas density dropping faster than @xmath35 around the virial radius in the numerical simulations . here",
    "we use @xmath36 , which means that the specific galaxy kinetic energy equals the specific gas thermal energy within the virial radius .",
    "a recent analysis on abell 401 shows the cluster mass given by the best - fit model is approximately by a factor of 1.7 lower than the value predicted by equation ( 3 ) @xcite .",
    "the difference is attributed to the fact that the simulated clusters have steeper gas density and shallower temperature profiles than observed .      assuming a `` @xmath31 model '' of the cluster gas density distribution @xcite , the column density of gas particles at an impact distance of @xmath37 is @xcite @xmath38^{-\\frac{1}{2}}\\]]here @xmath37 is the projected distance from the center of the galaxy cluster",
    "; @xmath39 is the core radius of the galaxy cluster and we select a constant value of 250 kpc throughout the paper ; @xmath40 is the baryonic gas fraction ; @xmath41 is the mean atomic weight and @xmath42 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "we are interested in the metal ion column density which would produced absorption features in the x - ray spectrum of a background quasar .",
    "the ionization sources of intracluster gas can be either photoionization from the x - ray background radiation or collisional ionization .",
    "however the x - ray background is in general too weak to be the main source of ionization so we only consider collisional ionization here .",
    "since generally the collisional time scale is much shorter than hubble time , the gas is in collisional ionization equilibrium .",
    "if we denote @xmath43 as the fraction of ion @xmath44 , @xmath45 would be only a function of temperature , i.e. , @xmath46 under collisional equilibrium @xcite . assuming a uniform metallicity @xmath47 the ion @xmath44 column density distribution is @xmath48^{-\\frac{1}{2}}\\]]here 0.46 is the fraction of hydrogen atoms by number .",
    "the baryonic gas fraction within galaxy clusters has recently received attention @xcite .",
    "almost all the observations give large values of baryon density @xmath49 than expected from the theory of the big bang nucleosynthesis if @xmath50 , which is taken as an indication of a low density universe .",
    "both local and high redshift observations @xcite suggest @xmath40 scatters between @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "to simplify , we use @xmath53 throughout the paper .      in analogy to the lyman-@xmath54 forest system",
    ", we define @xmath55 as the number of absorption systems along the line of sight with a column density between @xmath56 and @xmath57 per unit redshift . here",
    "@xmath58 is the column density of ion @xmath44 . if we define @xmath59 as the cross section of a galaxy group or cluster , the distribution function is then @xmath60 here @xmath61 is the cluster number density distribution at different cluster temperatures , which can be obtained by the press - schechter function and the cluster mass - to - temperature relationship .",
    "@xmath62 is the path length .",
    "we refer to @xcite for detailed calculations .",
    "given different cosmological models , the x - ray forest distribution @xmath55 is determined through equation ( 6 ) via the press - schechter function ( equation ( 1 ) ) .",
    "here we compare the x - ray forest distribution under three cosmological models : a standard cold dark matter model ( scdm ) ; a low - density open cdm model ( ocdm ) and a low - density @xmath63-dominated cdm model .",
    "table  [ tbl-1 ] shows all the model parameters .",
    "observationally resonance absorption lines will be produced by transitions with the ions of the most abundant elements with the largest oscillator strength .",
    "for specificity we choose the ions , and .",
    "table  [ tbl-2 ] gives all the parameters .",
    "@xcite measured the metal abundances in four rich clusters with _",
    "asca_. we adopt their metallicity because we concentrate only on high column densities produced by rich clusters .",
    "the redshift evolution of cluster metallicities can also play an important role here , for simplicity we treat them as constants .",
    "we adopt the solar abundances from @xcite .",
    "the atomic data are from @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : ion ] shows the ionization fractions @xcite , in which , and show three different peak temperatures around @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 , respectively .",
    "these temperatures roughly correspond to the galaxy cluster mass around @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 , according to the mass - temperature relationship ( 3 ) .",
    "to compute the press - schechter function we use the codes based on @xcite for the calculation of power spectrum and mass variance @xmath70",
    ". however , their codes are normalized by cobe data , which is on a scale larger than the size of galaxy clusters , so we renormalize the power spectrum based on the observations of the cluster abundance in the local universe .    figure  [ fig : distfuncfe ] through figure  [ fig : distfuncox ] give the distribution of three elements : , and under three cosmological models at different redshifts .",
    "the most striking feature is that in all three ions , the standard cold dark model shows a more rapid evolution than the two other low - density models .",
    "this trend in general agrees with the evolutionary scenarios predicted by different cosmological models . in the scdm model",
    ", the density perturbation grows as @xmath71 , most clusters are formed recently and the cluster number density declines very quickly as we move to high redshift . on the other hand ,",
    "low - density models predict slower evolution .",
    "figure  [ fig : nt ] shows the comoving cluster abundances as a function of x - ray temperature at different redshift predicted by the press - schechter distribution .",
    "although lcdm also shows some decline of cluster abundances at high temperature , scdm show the strongest evolution of number density at temperatures @xmath72 . among all three ions ,",
    "the distribution of shows the biggest decline ( over three decades between @xmath73 and @xmath74 ) .",
    "the reason is that has the highest peak temperature ( @xmath75k ) in figure  [ fig : ion ] , which corresponds to the biggest decline in the cluster abundances ( figure  [ fig : nt ] ) .",
    "the second feature is that all three distributions show a rapid cutoff between @xmath3 and @xmath76 .",
    "this is mainly because the maximum ion column density can not exceed the central column density of the galaxy clusters .",
    "the central ion column density is given by equation ( 5 ) .",
    "for instance , the peak temperature of is around @xmath77k ( figure  [ fig : ion ] ) , which roughly corresponds to a central column density of @xmath78 .",
    "this explains why figure  [ fig : distfuncox ] shows a sharp cutoff around this column density .",
    "the third feature is that for all three ions , the scdm model predicts more absorbers along the line - of - sight than ocdm and lcdm .",
    "this is because the spatial density of clusters is very sensitive to the present matter density - @xmath32 ( equation ( 1 ) ) .",
    "@xmath32 represents the overall amplitude of the density fluctuation and changing of @xmath32 will dramatically change the spatial density of virialized objects , the clusters of galaxies .",
    "this can be a method to determine @xmath32 in the future from observations of the x - ray forest .      to obtain statistics on the distribution of x - ray absorption lines ,",
    "we carry out a series of monte carlo simulations . assuming both absorber column density and redshift are independent random variables @xcite",
    ", we define the probability density functions ( pdf ) for each variable ,    @xmath79    here @xmath80 is the total absorber number , given by the integration of the distribution function over both redshift and ion column density .",
    "we set a range for each variable as @xmath81 { \\rm cm^{-2}}$ ] and @xmath82 $ ] . using these pdfs",
    "we obtain column densities and redshifts for 10,000 randomly selected lines - of - sight .",
    "figures  [ fig : avecol ] and  [ fig : avered ] show the average cumulative distribution of the absorption line numbers vs. column density and redshift , respectively .",
    "although is too scarce to give any statistical information , both figures do reflect the three features of the x - ray forest we noted before . in figure",
    "[ fig : avered ] we include only the absorption lines with column density higher than @xmath83 because this is the lowest column density which is detectable by _ constellation x _ ( see the next section ) . in this figure",
    "we see that , compared to the lcdm and ocdm models , scdm presents a larger number of absorption lines . for instance",
    ", scdm shows that on average ten absorption lines up to @xmath84 , where ocdm and lcdm give only four and three lines , respectively .    assuming a velocity dispersion of @xmath85 , the line optical depth is obtained by @xmath86 . here",

    "we choose a typical spectrum of an x - ray bright quasar with photon index @xmath108 and flux @xmath109 between 0.1 and 2.4 kev .",
    "the galactic column density is @xmath110 .",
    "given this representative spectrum we calculate the minimum detectable equivalent width and column density of some ion species for a particular observation time . in table",

    "is calculated based on a s / n of 3 and an integration time of 100 ksec .",
    "comparing this table with figure  [ fig : avecol ] and  [ fig : avered ] , we find that ion is the best candidate for all three instruments .",
    "using xspec 10 , we simulate this `` representative '' spectrum plus absorption lines from one realization of the lcdm model ( figure  [ fig : ox_tran ] ) on _ xmm _ rgs .",
    "several tens of quasars with @xmath112 have such spectrum or are even brighter , so we put the redshift of this quasar at @xmath113 .",
    "the lcdm simulations give three absorption lines with @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "table  [ tbl-4 ] lists the simulated line properties .",
    "then we fit the simulated spectrum with a model only containing galactic absorption and a single power law .",
    "the @xmath116 plot of figure  [ fig : sim ] clearly shows three absorption lines .",
    "notice here line 2 and line 3 are only separated by approximately @xmath117 ev .",

    "we calculate the x - ray distribution function of , and under the standard cold dark matter model and two low - density models .",
    "shows the more rapid evolution of scdm , compared to ocdm and lcdm ; these trends are milder for and . using monte - carlo simulation",
    ", we investigate the average distribution of the x - ray forest .",
    "we find scdm model presents more absorption lines than ocdm and lcdm , which eventually might yield a method of determining @xmath32 .",
    "we also select a typical spectrum of an x - ray bright , distant quasar to explore the detectability of the x - ray forest .",
    "we find for all three telescopes , there are at least several absorption lines detectable by _ chandra _ , _ xmm _ and _ constellation - x_. this result is consistent with @xcite and hellsten et al .",
    "( 1998 ) .",
    "the x - ray forest distribution function depends on the press - schechter distribution of galaxy clusters , the cluster mass - temperature relationship and the gas distribution inside galaxy clusters ( equation ( 6 ) ) . in the following",
    "we discuss several important factors which can affect the result .",
    "the key element of the press - schechter function is the mass variance , @xmath70 .",
    "the present mass variance @xmath118 is calculated from the present power spectrum filtered through a top - hat window , and normalized by the the mass variance at @xmath119 mpc , @xmath120 .",
    "the estimation of @xmath120 involves fitting the press - schechter function with the observed spatial number density of local clusters @xcite . in this evaluation",
    "a crucial relationship is the mass - temperature relationship of equation ( 3 ) .",
    "although there are both numerical and observational evidences for this relationship , it has a well - known problem of the `` recent - formation approximation '' : the clusters observed today formed just before we observe them . to resolve this problem two different methods @xcite",
    "were proposed to substitute the press - schechter function , both of which gave nearly the same result @xcite .",
    "based on the mergering - halo formalism of @xcite , @xcite derived a new @xmath121 relation and claimed that equation ( 3 ) overestimated temperature evolution and so the numbers of high - z clusters .",
    "their conclusion would affect the x - ray forest distribution function of discussed here , but not .",
    "the reason is that the exponential term of press - schechter function will only become crucial at high temperature ( @xmath122k ) , well above the temperature of the ionization peak of at @xmath123k .",
    "however it would be important to investigate this effect because it would largely decrease the possibility of detecting the highly - ionized heavy metal absorptions lines , such as .",
    "another important uncertainty which can affect the x - ray distribution function is the metal abundance inside clusters . using _",
    ", @xcite shows the mean abundances of o , si and fe of four galaxy clusters are 0.48 , 0.65 and 0.32 respectively , which are close to the values used in this paper . however , there are a few factors which can affect the metal distribution .",
    "first , the metal abundances can depend on the mass of the cluster or group .",
    "recent observations by @xcite show at temperature above 1 kev , the metal abundances are roughly @xmath124 , with little variance , while at temperature below 1 kev , the metal abundances drop very fast ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references there in ) . if it is real , this effect can dramatically drop the possibility of observing oxygen absorption lines because of its low peak temperature of ionization .",
    "another factor is the assumption in this paper of constant metal abundances upto redshift as high as @xmath13 , although this is important only for the richest systems which have significant column density .",
    "no direct evidence shows a constant metal abundances beyond @xmath125 @xcite .",
    "further progress in this subject relies on both numerical simulations and observations .",
    "large - scale simulations on the x - ray clusters would provide us more accurate information on the x - ray forest distribution . on the observation side , with the launch of _ chandra _ and _ xmm _",
    ", we would expect a few or absorption lines by observing low and moderate redshift quasars . in the future , _ constellation - x _ will provide us superior spectrum of the x - ray forest , with the pioneer of probing the number and distribution of objects in the universe .",

    "<S> there is a growing consensus that in the present universe most baryons reside in galaxy clusters and groups in the form of highly ionized gas at temperatures of @xmath0 k. the h - like and he - like ions of the heavy elements can produce absorption features - the so - called `` x - ray forest '' - in the x - ray spectrum of a background quasar . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the distribution of the x - ray absorption lines produced by this gas under three different cosmological models : the standard cdm with @xmath1 , a flat model with @xmath2 and an open model with with @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> we give a semi - analytic calculation of the x - ray forest distribution based on the press - schechter formalism , following @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we choose three ions ( , and ) and calculate the distribution functions , the number of absorbers along the line - of - sight ( los ) to a distant quasar vs. redshift and column density in a given ion . </S>",
