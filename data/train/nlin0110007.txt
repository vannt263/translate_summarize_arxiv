    "coupled map lattices  @xcite consist of a continuous variable ( here @xmath0 ) defined on a discrete lattice representing space and time .",
    "the dynamics relates the value of @xmath0 at each space - time point to its value at previous lattice points , typically just the most recent time and the nearest neighbours in space .",
    "coupled map lattices include the simplest examples of spatiotemporal chaos and are often used to model less tractable systems such as nonlinear partial differential equations .",
    "diffusively coupled tchebyscheff maps were introduced by beck in order to chaotically quantise field theories  @xcite , later applied to spontaneous symmetry breaking of quantised higgs fields  @xcite .",
    "the discrete time of the coupled map lattice corresponds to the fictitious time in the parisi - wu stochastic quantisation  @xcite , and is taken to infinity in order to reproduce quantum mechanics .",
    "the function appearing in the map is naturally given by the derivative of the quartic double well potential , which ( appropriately scaled ) is the third degree tchebyscheff polynomial discussed below .",
    "in addition , tchebyscheff maps are conjugated to bernoulli shifts , and so have very chaotic statistical properties , hence the possibility that the stochastic forces arise intrinsically from the chaotic dynamics .    in a later work",
    "@xcite , beck considers coupled map lattices based on the second degree tchebyscheff polynomial in addition to the third degree case considered previously , and restricts attention to one spatial dimension .",
    "he numerically computes averages of interaction and self energies , and reproduces to about four digits a large number of parameters occurring in the standard model of particle physics , with predictions for some poorly constrained quantities such as neutrino and higgs masses .",
    "the opinion of the present author is that although ref .",
    "@xcite does not contain a complete theory relating particle physics to coupled map lattices , the probability of obtaining such a large number of accurate predictions with so few adjustable parameters is sufficiently small that the models warrant further attention .    quite apart from the context in which these models were introduced",
    ", they have a number of appealing features from a dynamical point of view .",
    "in particular , there is an adjustable parameter @xmath1 in which the system takes two exactly solvable limits , @xmath2 which is decoupled and fully chaotic , and @xmath3 in which the lattice decouples into two sub - lattices , the latter of which are fully chaotic for the advanced coupling case and fully stable for the backward coupling case ( see below for definitions ) .    motivated by the desire for exact results and the simple form of the equations , this paper analyses the simplest periodic states , those for which the field does not depend on the spatial variable , called `` synchronised states '' . finding these states is equivalent to finding periodic orbits of a one dimensional map , but the linear stability is a more involved calculation than one dimensional maps due to spatially dependent unstable modes .",
    "stability analysis is important because the proliferation of stable states undermines the argument that stochastic quantisation arises from the chaotic dynamics .    a general theory of linear stability of periodic solutions of coupled map lattices is given in refs .",
    "our analysis of synchronised states leads , as in these works , to cyclic matrices , which are always explicitly diagonalisable .",
    "the general theory also permits spatially periodic solutions of length greater than one ( leading to block cyclic matrices ) , and lattices of spatial dimension greater than one ( leading to blocks within blocks ) .    finding that an orbit in a spatially extended system is linearly stable",
    "does not imply that a finite measure of initial conditions approaches the orbit , unlike finite dimensional dynamical systems .",
    "actually , there are many possible inequivalent measures of initial conditions : we choose an initial distribution that is lebesgue in the field @xmath0 and spatially independent , but physical arguments may justify an alternative choice .",
    "in fact , in view of the results , we will argue that the final ( ie infinite fictitious time ) state depends strongly on this choice of initial conditions , and hence that physical arguments are required to specify such a choice .",
    "the linear stability of the synchronised states is given in sec .",
    "[ s : lin ] . numerical work in sec .",
    "[ s : non ] reveals properties of the dynamics far from these periodic states .",
    "the conclusion summarises the results , discussing in more detail the implications for the beck theory .",
    "as in low dimensional dynamical systems ( such as the individual maps ) , linear stability analysis in coupled map lattices consists of determining whether and how fast infinitesimal perturbations of a reference trajectory ( here a periodic orbit ) grow with time .",
    "as noted above , however , linear stability , in that _ all _ sufficiently small ( everywhere ) perturbations decay with time , does not imply that a finite measure of initial conditions is attracted to the reference trajectory .",
    "notwithstanding ths caveats of interpretation , the linear stability analysis is a good starting point for finding stable orbits and their corresponding parameter ranges ; nonlinear stability is discussed in sec .  [",

    "this part of the trajectory is obtained by iterating @xmath29 backwards .",
    "recalling that the tchebyscheff polynomials can be represented as @xmath30 we have for the degree 2 models @xmath31 and for the degree 3 model @xmath32 note that the @xmath33 corrections are suppressed by the contraction of the inverse map .",
    "the orbit is closed by matching the expressions for @xmath34 and @xmath35 , assuming that both @xmath36 and @xmath7 ( actually @xmath37 and @xmath38 ) are much greater than one .",
    "the result is @xmath39 for the second degree models and @xmath40 for the third degree model .",
    "the value of @xmath1 can now be read off as @xmath41 where @xmath42 is given in tab .",
    "[ t : bn ] .",
    "the result is consistent with the original assumption that @xmath1 is small .",
    "note that the original @xmath33 freedom in the initial condition @xmath43 contributes to @xmath44 when the trajectory is near @xmath16 , and so is expected to shift @xmath1 by an amount of order @xmath45 , that is , @xmath46 .",
    "obtaining the appropriate coefficient would require a more involved calculation .",
    "now we turn to the linear stability of these long orbits using eq .",
    "( [ e : stab ] ) .",
    "@xmath47 is now a product of a large number ( @xmath48 ) of factors .",
    "the @xmath49 factor is small since both @xmath50 and @xmath1 are small , and will be considered separately . for the remaining factors the @xmath51 term dominates and the @xmath52 term can be ignored , owing to the presence of the small quantity @xmath1 .",
    "thus we have @xmath53\\prod_{t=1}^{\\tau-1}f'(\\phi_t ) [ 1+{\\cal o}(a\\tau)]\\ ] ]    the product is @xmath54 for the second degree models , ignoring corrections of order @xmath1 .",
    "an analogous result holds for the third degree model . making a small angle approximation we arrive at @xmath55 where @xmath56 is given in tab .",
    "[ t : bn ] .",
    "thus the product , being of order @xmath57 , balances the first factor which is of order @xmath1 and hence @xmath58 .",
    "an orbit will be linearly stable if the remaining coefficient maximised over @xmath59 ( and denoted @xmath60 ) is less than one .",
    "we can set @xmath61 by letting @xmath62 for the second degree models and @xmath63 for the @xmath64 model .",
    "for the @xmath65 model we also have @xmath66 so the orbit remains superstable in the presence of perturbations at all wavenumbers @xmath59 , and @xmath67 .",
    "the @xmath68 models have @xmath69 , so that we have stability if @xmath70 .",
    "this quantity is also given in tab .",
    "[ t : bn ] , and it shows that all orbits are linearly stable when @xmath61 .",
    "note that the most stable state is when @xmath71 belongs to a periodic orbit of the synchronised map  ( [ e : sync ] ) ; this is not generally the same as the superstable point of this map , which is the solution of the equation @xmath72 .",
    "finally we make a connection to an observation made in ref .  @xcite . in section 6.6 of that",
    "work a scaling was observed numerically in the limit @xmath73 , in particular the dynamical average @xmath74 exhibited the following behaviour @xmath75 where the function @xmath76 satisfies ( in the limit ) @xmath77 that is , @xmath76 is log - periodic .",
    "here we have found a family of stable orbits in which @xmath1 differs from one to the next by a factor of @xmath78 .",
    "the @xmath78 comes from the derivative of the synchronised map at the points @xmath79 .",
    "the scaling of @xmath78 would occur in other families of orbits ( stable or unstable ) containing @xmath79 , and hence possibly to all small values of @xmath1 .",
    "linear stability , considered in the previous section , implies that sufficiently small perturbations of a periodic state will approach that state in the future . however",
    ", this does not imply that a generic initial state will approach the stable state . for a sufficiently large system , some of the initial conditions will be near points of the periodic state , however there is no guarantee that neighbouring maps will not strongly perturb these maps away from the periodic state .",

    "the most interesting question is what has happened to the period 2 orbits .",

    "averages can be estimated given a knowledge of the relative proportions of upper domains , lower domains and boundary regions .",

    "the continuous case is numerically ambiguous due to the exponentially long time scales .",
    "it may may relax eventually to the stable periodic orbit , so its infinite time properties can be calculated directly from this orbit .    as the relaxation time increases , the transition between the discrete and continuous regimes ( ie @xmath88 at a time of @xmath83 )",
    "is observed to move towards larger @xmath1 , so it is in fact likely that at sufficiently long times , the final destination is a state with frozen disorder for all @xmath1 corresponding to this stable periodic orbit .",

    "[ f : slow ] shows that at @xmath89 and a time of @xmath90 the dynamics seems to have frozen .    however , even if as suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite the coupled map lattice describes something going on at the planck scale ( @xmath91 seconds ) , the transient relaxation may relate to measurable time scales .",
    "note that time in the coupled map lattice is not physical time but parisi - wu fictitious time which supposedly is taken to infinity . the question is whether this indeed happens or rather it remains exponentially large but finite .",
    "the other backward coupled ( @xmath68 ) maps and also @xmath92 have the same appearance of multiple `` feathered '' attracting points , which apparently give way to a continuous distribution as @xmath1 is varied , specifically for @xmath93 and @xmath94 , for @xmath65 and @xmath95 or @xmath96 , and for @xmath64 and @xmath97 .",

    "@xmath100 lies just below the lower boundary of the stable window ( of spatial period 2 ; not discussed above ) .",

    "@xmath110 lies in a stable period 2 orbit , although numerical results suggest chaos in its vicinity .",
    "thus , these values ( and hence standard model parameters according to ref .",
    "@xcite ) relate to many different types of dynamics , from fully chaotic ( ie not in the lists above ) to a stable fixed point .",

    "numerically , the period 2 orbit in the @xmath84 model is an attractor where the two values of @xmath0 occur in different domains at one time slice , exchanging their values at the next time slice .",
    "the size and distribution of these domains depends sensitively on the distribution of initial conditions .",
    "furthermore , some values of @xmath1 require exponentially long times before the final state is reached .",
    "similar structures appear in the @xmath65 , @xmath93 and @xmath64 models .",
    "how do these results affect ref .",
    "in general we might expect the results to depend on the choice of initial conditions if a stable periodic state exists ( true for many of the values ) or indeed any coexistence of attractors ( beyond the scope of this paper ) , and also be affected by exponentially slow dynamics in one of the `` feather '' regions ( apparently not relevant at the values given in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "in addition , the fact that many if not most of the values of @xmath1 correspond to stability , or at least not full chaos , undermines the assertion that it is the strong chaotic properties of the tchebyscheff maps that is responsible ( via stochastic quantisation ) for quantum mechanics .",
    "the coupled tchebyscheff maps are often far from chaotic , and some explanation must be given as to why many stable parameter values are important in particle physics yet the quantisation mechanism requires strong instability .",
    "the results presented here are only a brief sketch of the diffusively coupled tchebyscheff map lattices , however it has been sufficient to find analytic results for classes of periodic states and demonstrate some of the richness of spatially extended dynamics including bifurcations evident in figs .  [",

    "[ f : slow ] .",
    "the combination of analytic tractability and a great variety of dynamical behaviour makes the coupled tchebyscheff maps good candidates for prototypes of spatiotemporal chaos , much as the ( closely related ) logistic map is a prototype of low dimensional chaos .",
