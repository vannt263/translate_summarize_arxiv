    "the virgo cluster represents an ideal laboratory for the study of galaxy evolution in a cluster environment .",
    "it is one of the nearest galaxy clusters ( d@xmath217 mpc ) , a relatively populous system ( abell richness class i ) , consisting of some two thousand catalogued members in the virgo cluster catalogue ( vcc , * ? ? ?",
    "the virgo cluster is spiral - rich and dynamically young , i.e. , made of galaxy subgroups which are falling into the main cluster .",
    "the most prominent groups are those associated with m86 to the west and m49 to the south .",
    "a particularity of the virgo cluster is that the distribution of its hot intracluster medium is strongly peaked on the central cd galaxy m87 @xcite , and overall highly sub - structured .",
    "the virgo cluster is therefore ideal to study the effects of both gravitational interaction and interaction with the intracluster medium on the atomic gas ( ) disks of spiral members .",
    "morphological signs of tidal interaction are usually detected in the restframe ultraviolet or blue - filter optical images of the stellar disk .",
    "a series of morphological parameters , originally developed for galaxy classification , have been used extensively in recent years to identify disturbed galaxies , and to infer the merger fractions and rates over cosmological time scales @xcite .",
    "the observational benefits are that the hubble space telescope observations of high - redshift galaxies and ground - based observations of nearby galaxies ( e.g. , sdss ) probe the same wavelength , physical structure and volumes . however , in the nearby universe , the 21 cm perspective on galaxies is set to catch up to the optical surveys in terms of numbers of galaxies studied . currently under construction are two new radio observatories : the south african karoo array telescope ( meerkat ; * ? ? ?",

    "together with refurbished observatories such as the extended very large array ( evla ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the aperture tile in focus instrument ( apertif ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) on the westerbork synthesis radio telescope ( wsrt ) , detailed  maps of thousands of galaxies will become available .",
    "the unprecedented volume of data implies that the data reduction and subsequent morphological classification can only be done through automated procedures .    in the previous papers in this series @xcite",
    ", we have shown that the morphological classifiers that are in use to identify mergers in the optical can be extremely useful for the  perspective .",
    "the  observations are not as high - resolution as the optical disk but this is compensated for by the larger extent of the atomic gas disk and the relative sensitivity of gas to an interaction  for which much anecdotal evidence already existed in  the  rogues galaxies \" catalogue @xcite .",
    "the sensitivity of  surveys to gas - rich and minor mergers will provide the calibration for higher redshifts where these types of mergers are expected to be the dominant type of galaxy interaction @xcite . the square kilometre array @xcite will subsequently be able to resolve  disks at these higher redshifts .",
    "the  disks of spiral galaxies are also extremely sensitive to ram pressure by the intergalactic or intracluster medium .",
    "the virgo cluster is an ideal laboratory to test the effects of both gravitational interaction and intracluster medium stripping on the quantified morphology of  disks .",
    "there are detailed models of the gas stripping sequence @xcite , and a uniform  data set from the vla imaging of virgo spirals in atomic gas ( viva ) project @xcite , with detailed notes on individual galaxies identifying morphological phenomena .    in this paper",
    ", we explore the distribution of the  morphological parameters from the viva column density maps in relation to estimates by @xcite , @xcite or @xcite of the star - formation rate ,  deficiency , stripping and gravitational harassment .",
    "first we discuss data and morphological parameters (  [ s : data ] and [ s : param ] ) , but readers already familiar with these can skip to results and conclusions (  [ s : results ] and [ s : concl ] ) .",
    "the viva project @xcite has compiled the largest high - resolution imaging  database of the virgo cluster to date .",
    "they have published 48 vla  data cubes and maps with 51 virgo cluster spiral galaxies .",
    "these are some 40 new observations with the remainder from reprocessed archival data .",
    "we obtained the zero order moment maps from http://www.astro.yale.edu/viva/ and converted to  column density maps using the expressions in @xcite .",
    "the spatial resolution of viva data is approximately 15@xmath3 ( or @xmath21.2 kpc at the distance of virgo ) , and the typical sensitivity is @xmath4 @xmath5 in 3@xmath6 per 10 km / s channel .",
    "viva data show that ( i ) the galaxies located in the core of the cluster predominantly have truncated   disks with some gas displaced from the galactic disk and ( ii ) some 7 out of the 50 sample galaxies ( @xmath210% ) show long , one - sided  tails @xcite .",
    "these tails occur in galaxies located at intermediate projected distances between 0.5 and 1 mpc from the cluster centre . from the sample listed in table 1 of @xcite ,",
    "we did not use ic 3418 as it is a non - detection in the viva survey and holmberg vii because it does not have enough continuous  flux to meaningfully compute morphological parameters .",
    "two morphological parameter schemes are now in wide use : concentration - asymmetry - smoothness ( cas , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and gini20   @xcite . in an image with @xmath7 pixels with intensities @xmath8 at pixel position @xmath9 , cas the morphological parameters are defined as : @xmath10 @xmath11 @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the radius which includes that percentage of the intensity of the object , @xmath14 is the value of the pixel in the rotated image and @xmath15 is the same pixel in the image after smoothing .",
    "gini and 20   are defined as : @xmath16 @xmath17 with @xmath18 $ ] , where ( @xmath19,@xmath20 ) is the galaxy s central position , and @xmath21 is the intensity of pixel @xmath22 in an flux - ordered list .",
    "pixel @xmath23 is the pixel marking the 20% point in this list .",
    "@xmath24 is the mean pixel value .",
    "the gini parameter is an indicator of inequality in the distribution of pixel values ; gini=1 is perfect inequality with one pixel containing all the flux from an object and gini=0 is perfect equality with each pixel containing an equal fraction of the flux .",
    "values in between indicate how concentrated the flux from this object is in a few bright areas .",
    "the 20   parameter is an indication whether or not the brightest parts of the object are close to the center or spread throughout the object .    in addition to these well - established parameters ,",
    "we compute the gini coefficient of the second order moment @xmath25 $ ] , which we called @xmath26 @xcite . for all these parameters ,",
    "we compute the uncertainty by varying the input centre the resolution and randomizing the pixel values .",
    "the exception is the gini parameter as this does not rely on the centre as input . for the gini error , we jacknife the pixel selection . for a more detailed description of these parameters ,",
    "we refer the reader to the previous papers in this series @xcite and the original papers introducing these @xcite .",
    "we compute these parameters for the area defined by the contour level of @xmath27 @xmath5 ( the @xmath28 level ) .    in @xcite",
    ", we identified several parts of parameter space where tidally interacting galaxies reside for the whisp sample . to identify the interacting galaxies",
    ", we used a subsample of 154 spirals and dwarf galaxies in whisp , which have independent visual estimates of interaction from either @xcite or @xcite .",
    "the criteria from the literature and our previous paper are identified in figures [ f : tail ] and [ f : int ] with dashed and dotted lines respectively .",
    "criteria from the literature are : @xmath29 from @xcite , marked by the dashed lines in figures [ f : tail ] and [ f : int ] , panels iv , v and vi .",
    "@xmath30 from @xcite , marked by the dashed lines in panel ii of figures [ f : tail ] and [ f : int ] .",
    "@xmath31 @xcite , marked by the dashed lines in panel iv of figures [ f : tail ] and [ f : int ] .",
    "we defined three criteria based on the whisp  morphologies : @xmath32 makred by the vertical dotted line in figures [ f : tail ] and [ f : int ] , panels i , iii , vi and x , @xmath33 marked by the dotted line in figures [ f : tail ] and [ f : int ] , panel v , and , @xmath34 which is the dotted lines in figures [ f : tail ] and [ f : int ] , panel ix .",
    "these criteria select a merger from its  morphology for different time scales . in @xcite",
    ", we quantified the typical time scale for a merger to be selected by each of these criteria using   maps of merger simulations ( originally presented in * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these can be compared to merger simulations of an isolated disk , evolving passively .",
    "the comparison shows how long a merger is selected as well as the level of contamination by passive disks . at the resolution of the whisp sample ,",
    "interactions were identifiable as such by their  morphology for about a gyr .",
    "this is a similar time scale as the one for optical morphological identifications and better than the close pair method .",
    "our goal is to explore if the above criteria could be applied to  data in a denser environment , where many other phenomena play a role in the  morphology as well as to explore how many of those other phenomena leave a signature in the  morphology .",
    "figures [ f : tail ] and [ f : int ] show the spread of morphological parameters for the entire viva sample with different morphological classifications from @xcite . table [ t : viva ] lists all the values . due to the combination of distance and resolution , the viva sample has the coarsest physical scales we have applied these morphological parameters to date . in @xcite and @xcite we showed that these parameters are relatively invariant with distances out to d@xmath220 mpc and a resolution of 6 \" , so the viva sample is effectively at the limit of this technique with current observatories .",
    "we used the optical positions ( j2000 ) of the galaxies reported in @xcite as the centre of the galaxy ( @xmath19,@xmath20 ) to compute the parameters that depend on a central position ( all except the gini paramter ) .",
    "our motivations are that the stellar disk marks the centre of the gravitational potential of a galaxy and kinematic and stellar centres generally align well ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "optical positions of the galaxies are a likely starting point for many of the future  surveys and @xcite reported many tidal  tails and displacements , which could be quantified using our morphological parameters .",
    "thus , it is entirely possible that some of morphological values ( e.g. , asymmetry ) are extreme since the centre is not the barycentre of the flux , as is common for optical morphological measurements .",
    "@xcite supply extensive notes on the  morphology and the nature of the  stripping of individual galaxies .",
    "we have summarized these evaluations in table [ t : chung ] .",
    "@xcite note which galaxies are currently undergoing or have recently undergone stripping , as well as the likely origin of this stripping ; ram pressure by the intracluster medium or tidal interaction with a close companion .",
    "in addition , they report a parameter for  deficiency ( @xmath35 ; the galaxy s  surface density compared to the value typical for spirals ) , a measure of  truncation ( @xmath36 ; the ratio of the  diameter over the optical , b - band one ) , and additional notes for indicators of warps in the  morphology and velocity maps .",
    "finally , @xcite also list the star - formation properties of their sample , as catalogued and classified by @xcite ; the level of activity and whether it was recently cut - off ( truncated star - formation ) .",
    "we have plot the spread of our morphological parameters with each of these estimates marked to explore if there are specific parts of parameter space that single out an  disk characteristic , similar to the separation of interaction and non - interacting galaxies we found in the whisp database .",
    "figures [ f : hidef ] , [ f : tail ] , and [ f : int ] , show the spread in parameters each with certain phenomena marked , so that they can be identified in the morphological parameter space .",
    "we discuss several  morphological phenomena noted by chung et al .",
    "below .          figure",
    "[ f : hidef ] shows gini versus concentration for  deficient and truncated  disks .",
    "both parameters are sensitive to how evenly the flux is distributed over the area of the disk and therefore could be sensitive to both these phenomena . to identify  truncation , one could use the concentration of the  emission .",
    "we have found that values around or below c=1 seem to be very indicative of truncation ; the radii containing 20 and 80 percent of the  flux are very close together ( fig .",
    "[ f : hidef ] , left panel ) .",
    "given that typical values for concentration in  are much higher ( typically c@xmath375 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , this may be a good tracer of truncation in large  surveys .",
    "a value of concentration below unity selects half of the truncated galaxies in the viva sample very cleanly ( 12 out of 24 truncated disks with no contamination from non - truncated disks ) .",
    "the  deficiency is defined by the surface density compared to the average surface density for spirals ( see equation 5 in * ? ? ?",
    "the majority of viva galaxies are  deficient ( 44 galaxies with @xmath38 ) . the low values of concentration ( @xmath39 )",
    "appear to be indicative of this  deficiency .",
    "in viva , those galaxies with extreme  deficiency ( @xmath40 ) are not much more concentrated than moderately deficient ones ( figure [ f : hidef ] , right panel ) , at least at this resolution .",
    "we note that a c@xmath415 criterion will select some 80 % of the   deficient galaxies in the viva sample but their number is contaminated ( 17% of this selection is not  deficient ) . in the upcoming large surveys this makes concentration a quick assessor on whether or not a spiral has a typical  content or not .",
    "nearly all the spirals in the virgo cluster are undergoing , or have recently undergone , some type of interaction .",
    "discerning between the dominant mechanism , tidal or ram - pressure , was a major focus of the work by @xcite and @xcite . several interaction related morphological phenomena ( e.g. , warps and  tails )",
    "are noted by @xcite .",
    "table [ t : chung ] lists many galaxies with  tails in the viva data and several with  warps .",
    "one would expect that high values for the asymmetry would identify  tails ( figure [ f : tail ] ) .",
    "however , because we used the optical centres listed by @xcite , asymmetry is already at the maximum value for most of the viva galaxies ( figure [ f : tail ] , panels iv - vii ) .",
    "we note however that the asymmetry may still be a good indicator of ( tidal )  tails , but in less extreme or possibly better resolved cases .",
    "the 20-gini selection criterion ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : lcrit2 ] ) does reasonably separate those galaxies with  tails from those which do not ; 60 % of the  tails identified by @xcite are selected by this criterion ( figure [ f : tail ] , panel ii ) .",
    "however , these are about half the objects selected do not have an  tail .",
    "therefore , the gini-20   criterion can be used a likelyhood for an  tail but it will suffer from contamination .",
    "warps were identified predominantly by their kinematic signature in @xcite and no morphological parameter or combination seems to be able to identify them in the viva data .",
    "figure [ f : int ] shows the same spread of morphological parameters as figure [ f : tail ] with the estimate we gleaned from @xcite whether or not the galaxy is stripped , undergoing ram - pressure , or undergoing tidal interaction .",
    "the sequence of stripping in the virgo cluster according to @xcite is indicated by the solid lines .",
    "this sequence of six virgo galaxies does trace a track into and out of certain interaction criteria defined previously in the literature and the third paper in this series .",
    "the extreme values for asymmetry drive almost all of the viva galaxies into the asymmetry - based merger selection space ; the asymmetry criterion from @xcite , the asymmetry - gini criterion from @xcite and our asymmetry-20 criterion from @xcite ( equations [ eq : lcrit1 ] , [ eq : lcrit3 ] , and [ eq : crit2 ] respectively ) .",
    "the extreme values for concentration linked to  deficiency and truncation similarly make the concentration20 selection criterion ( equation [ eq : crit3 ] , * ? ? ? * ) not applicable for merger selection .",
    "only the gini-20 criterion ( eq . [ eq : lcrit2 ] ) appears to separate objects with  tails moderately as discussed above .",
    "the  criterion ( eq . [ eq : crit1 ] ) is not contaminated by galaxies undergoing ram - pressure stripping but does not select tidal interactions well anymore either , something that we attribute to the native viva resolution ( no visibility times found in * ? ? ?",
    "* for the viva resolution ) .",
    "because stripping ,  deficiency and truncation are interlinked , there is the possibility that the concentration selection criteria also will select those galaxies that are or have been stripped .",
    "two effects move  morphologies into the selection criteria : poorer resolution and additional effects such as the ram - pressure stripping . given how the vollmer sequence tracks into ( and out again ) of the merger selection criteria , we can conclude that galaxies undergoing ram - pressure stripping will sometimes be selected as interacting in a morphological selection in future  surveys , at least those with spatial resolutions similar to viva .",
    "the addition of some galaxies that are undergoing stripping would , in part , explain the high merger fraction and rate we found in the whisp survey @xcite . in @xcite , we noted that the lower resolution data of the viva sample would have some problems selecting interacting systems from isolated ones , purely on the basis of their  morphology ( table 8 in the appendix ) .",
    "however , the success with which tidal  tails could be separated is encouraging .",
    "therefore , in future medium - resolution  surveys ( e.g. , wallaby , koribalski et al , _ in preparation _ ) , the selection of  disks with disturbed morphology can be used as a first pass in a search for stripping or interacting galaxies and a merger fraction and rate will have to be corrected for the contamination by stripping galaxies .",
    "for example , those galaxies that are  deficient can be removed before a merger rate is determined but that would bias against denser cluster environments ( which do include more other interactions like ram - pressure stripping )",
    ". a higher resolution survey of the virgo cluster galaxies would resolve the population of tidally interacting galaxies .",
    "the separation of ram - pressure stripped galaxies from tidal interacting ones may then be possible without the removal of  deficient ones .",
    "we explored the link between the morphological parameter space of  and the star - formation and truncation of star - formation as listed in table 3 in @xcite .",
    "relations are weak as the  gas is undergoing several other effects other than feedback from star - formation but it is interesting to note that those galaxies with little star - formation also have lower values of gini for  ( i.e. , they are more homogeneous ) .",
    "in this paper , we present the morphological parameters commonly used in the optical , applied to the  column density maps of virgo cluster galaxies obtained by the viva program .",
    "we find that the resolution of these observations ( @xmath215 \" or 1 kpc ) is on the coarse side for this type of analysis but some   morphological phenomena are identifiable , though with limitations .",
    "a critical choice is whether or not to use the optical or the  centres for these galaxies , one that every  survey will have to make .",
    "the choice of centre affects measures such as concentration , 20 , , and especially asymmetry .",
    "alternatively , one could use the barycentre of the  emission itself but the optical centre is most likely the centre of the dark matter halo of the galaxy and this approach would likely miss  displacements like tidal tails .",
    "we find that of the  morphological phenomena ,  deficiency and truncation can be identified easily by a low value of the concentration index ( figure [ f : hidef ] ) .",
    "warps could not be identified using the morphology parameters and  tails can be identified moderately well with the combined gini and 20 interaction criterion ( eq . [ eq : lcrit2 ] & figure [ f : tail ] , panel ii ) from @xcite .",
    "galaxies that are interacting are still identified by some of the morphological criteria from the literature @xcite and those identified by us specifically for  in @xcite ( eq . [ eq : lcrit1 ]  [ eq : crit3 ] ) .",
    "however , galaxies affected by ram - pressure stripping are ofttimes also selected by these criteria .",
    "for example , we note that the ram pressure sequence identified by @xcite tracks into the interaction part of the parameter space for many of the morphological selection criteria ( solid tracks in figure [ f : int ] ) . discerning between the origin of the  stripping ram pressure or tidal is , however , not possible with these morphological parameters , at least at viva s spatial resolution .",
    "thus any selection of interacting systems in a survey based purely on the  morphology parameters will include those that are undergoing ram - pressure stripping in a denser environment .",
    "a straightforward correction would be to exclude all  deficient ( @xmath39 ) galaxies from a morphological selection of interacting galaxies .",
