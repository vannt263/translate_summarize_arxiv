    "massive star formation is a phenomenon of fundamental importance in astrophysics , but our understanding of this process is hampered by the heavy extinction and large distances to the nearest sites . over the past decade , several examples of so - called `` massive protoclusters '' , loosely defined as four or more ( sub)millimeter continuum sources within @xmath4  au , have been identified using interferometers ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the massive members of such protoclusters often span a wide diversity of evolutionary stages ranging from ultracompact hii  regions and hot molecular cores to cool dust sources @xcite . in these objects ,",
    "the separations between the individual members are well - matched to those of the four principal members of the trapezium cluster , suggesting that ( sub)millimeter protoclusters trace the formation phase of the central massive stars of future ob clusters @xcite .",
    "given that all four of the trapezium stars themselves comprise compact multiple star systems , with separations of 15 - 400  au @xcite , it is critical to continue to study the members of these younger proto - trapezia with higher angular resolution .",
    "such observations are essential in order to probe for further multiplicity and to resolve the surrounding accretion structures , which are unlikely to be simple uniform disks , particularly in the context of binary and multiple systems .",
    "these observations must be undertaken at wavelengths long enough to penetrate the high column of obscuring dust .",
    "the ngc6334 region , known as the cat s paw nebula , contains multiple sites of high mass ( m@xmath58 @xmath6 ) star formation @xcite .",
    "the irac / newfirm survey of @xcite identified 375 class i ysos and 1908 class ii ysos , indicating a star formation rate several times that of orion and just below the @xcite criteria for a `` mini - starburst '' . at the northeastern end of the region ,",
    "the deeply - embedded source `` i '' was first identified in far - infrared images @xcite .",
    "ngc6334i contains an embedded cluster of stars in near - infrared images @xcite and a cometary ultracompact hii ( uchii ) region @xcite .",
    "the uchii region is detected in the mid - infrared along with a few other sources @xcite .",
    "however , imaging at 10 and 18  @xmath7 m with @xmath8 resolution @xcite yielded infrared luminosity estimates for these other sources that are several orders of magnitude less than the bolometric luminosity of the region , suggesting that additional more deeply embedded objects power the ( sub)millimeter emission .",
    "our previous 1.3  mm submillimeter array ( sma ) observations of ngc6334i  at @xmath9 resolution revealed a cluster of four millimeter continuum sources in a trapezium - like arrangement @xcite .",
    "three of these objects are undetected in the infrared , and may represent a large fraction of the total luminosity of the protocluster . for clarity ,",
    "these four sources have been renamed in this paper from sma1 .. sma4 to mm1 .. mm4 ; the uchii region is known as mm3 .",
    "the brightest two of these objects ( mm1 and mm2 ) are the sources of hot core line emission seen in nh@xmath10 @xcite , hcn and ch@xmath10cn @xcite , and many other organic molecules @xcite . using ch@xmath10cn from a _ herschel _ line survey",
    ", @xcite found an average gas temperature for ngc6334i of 154  k , dominated by emission from the two hot cores mm1 and mm2 .",
    "a high velocity bipolar outflow traced by various transitions of co @xcite and hcn 10 @xcite emanates from the region around mm1 and mm2 , though it has been unclear which of the two objects is the powering source .    in this paper",
    ", we present sub - arcsecond , comparable - resolution continuum imaging of ngc6334i from 5  cm to 1.3  mm using the karl g. jansky very large array ( vla ) and the atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array ( alma ) .",
    "these data have allowed us to detect and resolve a number of new likely protocluster members and to carry out detailed analysis of their spectral energy distributions .",
    "the spectral line information from these new data will be presented in a future paper . for the distance to ngc6334i",

    "the most commonly used value was 1.7  kpc from photometric estimates for the ngc6334 region @xcite , implying a reduction by a factor of 1.7 for derived quantities based on the distance squared , such as mass and luminosity .",

    "the position of the gain calibrator has been established to sub - milliarcsecond accuracy in the vlba calibrator survey @xcite .",
    "the absolute flux calibration of the vla data is expected to be better than @xmath31 .",
    "the alma data were calibrated using the casa 4.3.1 version of the alma calibration pipeline .",
    "the following calibrators were employed for both alma bands : j1717 - 3342 ( gain ) and j1733 - 1304 ( bandpass ) .",
    "the absolute flux scale for the 1.3  mm data was set using titan , and the resulting measured flux density of the frequently monitored quasar j1733 - 1304 ( used for bandpass at both wavelengths ) is within @xmath32 of the value predicted by interpolation between the nearest alma measurements at 3  mm and 0.87  mm .",
    "the absolute flux calibrator for the 3  mm data was ceres , and in this case we found that the derived flux density of j1733 - 1304 was too high by @xmath33 , compared to alma flux monitor data taken within one day of our science observations .",
    "thus , we opted to recalibrate the 3  mm data , setting the absolute flux scale using the flux density of j1733 - 1304 from the flux monitoring .",
    "this procedure certainly improved the relative absolute flux calibration between the 3 and 1.3  mm data , but since the alma flux monitor values are themselves also based on models of the millimeter emission from solar system objects , there is still an overall absolute flux uncertainty of @xmath34 for the alma data .",
    "after applying the calibration , the science target data were split off for all bands , additional flagging was applied , and line - free channels were used to construct pseudo - continuum data sets .",
    "finding line - free channels for the vla data was easy , only requiring the excision of a few radio recombination and narrow maser lines .",
    "because of the two strong hot - core sources in ngc6334i , it is challenging to find line - free channels for continuum imaging and subtraction for the 3 and 1.3  mm data . toward this aim",
    ", we first made dirty cubes containing both the line and continuum emission of each spectral window ( spw ) , and used these cubes to carefully identify line - free channels for continuum imaging and subtraction . from tests of different threshold levels for line - free channel identification , and comparison of the resulting image flux densities",
    ", we estimate that the continuum of the two hot core line sources ( mm1 and mm2 ) suffers from residual line contamination of @xmath35 in flux density for the adopted threshold level , while the other continuum sources suffer very little contamination . the final line - free ( `` continuum '' )",
    "bandwidths are given in table  [ obscm ] .",
    "the continuum data for all bands were imaged in casa 4.6.0 using multi - frequency synthesis and _ nterms=2 _ to account for linear changes in intensity versus frequency due to the spectral index of the emission which may vary with position .",
    "multi - scale clean was also employed with scales 0 , 5 , and 15 times the image pixel size ( typically 1/5 of the synthesized beam ) .",
    "the data were iteratively self - calibrated , using the bright continuum emission .",
    "though providing copious signal for the self - calibration of the vla data , the cm - bright uchii region mm3 significantly limits the achieved dynamic range in the vla images .",
    "similarly , the mm - bright region mm1 limits the dynamic range of the 1.3  mm alma image ( see figure  [ fov ] , also * ? ? ?",
    "the dynamic range limitations imposed by the bright sources in the field at each band mean that the rms noise in the images varies significantly as a function of position .",
    "robust weighting between uniform and natural that gave the best compromise between sensitivity and confusion from missing short spacing information was employed . the final angular resolution and robust parameter for each band",
    "are given in table  [ obscm ] . while not perfectly matched , the final angular resolutions are comparable .",
    "the final images were corrected for primary beam attenuation , though this only has a significant impact for the 7  mm and 1.3  mm data .",
    "note that the 5  cm vla data were also presented by @xcite for the source ngc6334i(n ) .",
    "we expect that the absolute astrometry between bands is of order @xmath36 .",
    "in addition to the continuum , class ii ch@xmath10oh maser transitions at 6.6685 and 19.9674  ghz are present within the 5  cm and 1.5  cm data , respectively .",
    "the 6.7  ghz and 19.9  ghz data have channel spacings of 1  mhz , corresponding to 45  km  s@xmath30 and 15  km  s@xmath30 , respectively . due to the strong maser emission that is unresolved in these channels ,",
    "hanning smoothing was needed to suppress gibbs ringing , further reducing the spectral resolution to 90  km  s@xmath30 and 30  km  s@xmath30 , respectively .",
    "thus , only positional information for the strongest maser features can usefully be gleaned from these data .",
    "for both ch@xmath10oh maser transitions , the data were independently self - calibrated using the brightest maser channel .",
    "the angular resolutions of the maser image cubes are @xmath37 ( p.a.= @xmath38 ) and @xmath39 ( p.a.= @xmath40 ) for the 6.7 and 19.9  ghz transitions , respectively .",
    "the rms noise in the peak maser channel is 3.6  mjy  beam@xmath30 for the 6.7  ghz cube and 0.67  mjy  beam@xmath30 for the 19.9  ghz cube .",
    "we also manually processed an archival observation of ngc6334i in the 22.23508  ghz water maser transition , recorded in a 2-hour block on 2011 sep 09 in the a - configuration ( the project code is `` not_in_pds '' ) .",
    "the three calibrators were the same as for the other vla datasets described above .",
    "both basebands were tuned to the water line , each using eight contiguous 2  mhz subbands each with 128 channels .",
    "the basebands were offset by half a subband bandwidth ( 1  mhz ) in order to provide continuous sensitivity coverage over a total bandwidth of 16.5  mhz ( 222  km  s@xmath30 ) with 0.21  km  s@xmath30 channels and dual polarization .",
    "after normal calibration , we applied hanning smoothing , yielding a spectral resolution of 0.42  km  s@xmath30 .",
    "we imaged the calibrated data into 0.5  km  s@xmath30 channels , and then performed self - calibration using the strongest maser channels .",

    "note that since the dust opacity is not taken into account and the 1.3  mm opacities of some of the sources are very large ( as we show in   [ sedsec ] and [ nature ] ) , these spectral indices should not be interpreted as directly representative of the dust grain emissivity index @xmath104 ( c.f . in the optically thin limit @xmath105 ) .",

    "gaussian fitting of the compact sources mm5 .. mm9 was straightforward , requiring only a single component .",
    "the fitting procedures used for the more complex , and only marginally resolved , emission of mm1 , mm2 , and mm4 were necessarily more complex , especially for the 3 and 1.3  mm data , as described below . for each of these complex sources , we also give an estimate of the total flux density measured above the local @xmath106 level for each wavelength in table  [ properties ] . the total 1.3  mm integrated intensity reported by @xcite for ngc6334i using @xmath107 resolution sma data",
    "is @xmath108  jy . the alma 1.3  mm data with a resolution of @xmath109 actually recover more flux , 13.2  jy , an increase of @xmath110 .",
    "when one considers the @xmath111 and @xmath31 absolute calibration uncertainties of the sma and alma data , respectively , the new value is within @xmath112 of the older value .        for the longer wavelength ( 5  cm , 1.5  cm and 7  mm ) emission toward mm1 ,",
    "the mm1b and mm1d components were simultaneously fit with two gaussians .",
    "these fits are well constrained at 1.5  cm and 7  mm , but less so at 5  cm , particularly for mm1d , due to the comparatively poorer angular resolution . also , for both sources",
    ", while the 1.5  cm and 7  mm fitted positions match to within @xmath113 , the 5  cm fits are slightly offset to the north .",
    "for mm1b the 5  cm position shift ( compared to the average of the 1.5  cm and 7  mm positions ) is only marginally significant at @xmath114 ( north ) , while for mm1d , it is more significant at @xmath115 ( north ) .",
    "this position offset may simply be due to the fact that these two sources are poorly resolved by the more extended north - south beam at 5  cm ( see table  [ obscm ] ) , or this could indicate a real change in position with wavelength .",
    "it is notable that the fitted 5  cm , 1.5  cm , and 7  mm positions for the cm1 source do all match to within the expected astrometric uncertainty ( @xmath116 ) .",
    "the shorter wavelength data toward mm1 ( 3 and 1.3  mm ) shows emission spread over a larger area with more complex morphology .",
    "both the spatial variation of @xmath99 ( fig .",
    "[ spix ] ) and the presence of distinct sources at longer wavelengths suggest that the bulk of the 3 and 1.3  mm emission arises from a collection of individual sources .",
    "moreover , the high peak brightness temperatures across mm1 suggest that these individual sources are centrally concentrated . for these reasons",
    ", we attempted to decompose the emission into gaussian components . since it has the best angular resolution ,",
    "we first used the 1.3  mm image toward mm1 in a multi - step approach as outlined in figure  [ mm1fit ] . first , we aimed to remove the bulk of the most confused emission toward the center of mm1 using three gaussian components to represent mm1a , mm1b , and mm1d ( the fitted 7  mm positions and sizes of components mm1b and mm1d were used in this initial guess ) . the resulting residual image ( shown in fig .  [ mm1fit ] as `` subtract a , b , d '' ) was then used to fit the now less - confused emission from mm1c , mm1e , mm1f , and mm1 g with single component gaussians .",
    "the fitted parameters for mm1c , mm1e , mm1f , and mm1 g were then in turn subtracted from the original image , now leaving a residual for the spatially confused emission of mm1a , mm1b , and mm1d .",
    "an estimate for the 1.3  mm emission from mm1b was then extrapolated from the well constrained 7  mm fit for this source ( see table  [ properties ] ) using a spectral index of 3.05 ( see fig .  [ spix ] ) , and subtracted from the `` subtract c , e , f , g '' residual image .",
    "this left a residual image ( `` subtract b , c , e , f , g '' ) with only emission from mm1a and mm1d , now spatially distinct , from which fits were obtained for these two components .",
    "subtracting the resulting fitted parameters for mm1a and mm1d from the `` subtract c , e , f , g '' residual reveals an unresolved source at the position of mm1b , not surprisingly with similar characteristics to the previous 7  mm - based guess for this component .",
    "a fit for mm1b was made to this residual image to refine mm1b s parameters , after which the refined parameters were subtracted anew from the `` subtract c , e , f and g '' residual , to further refine the fits for mm1a and mm1d .",
    "the bottom two panels of fig .",
    "[ mm1fit ] show the final 1.3  mm 7-component model and the final residual with the model removed , demonstrating that the fitting process worked reasonably well , with the only notable residual being a faint arc of extended emission located to the southwest of component mm1c .",
    "the residual structure has a brightness temperature of @xmath117k .",
    "we applied a similar procedure to fit the 3  mm emission toward mm1 , though with the poorer resolution at 3  mm , the fits are less certain , especially for mm1a , mm1b , and mm1d .",
    "we account for the extra uncertainty in the fitted parameters for the more spatially confused objects ( mm1a , mm1b , mm1d , mm1e , and mm1 g ) by adding an extra @xmath31 and @xmath118 uncertainty ( in quadrature ) to the formal fitting errors in band 6 and 3 , respectively , when performing the sed modeling described in ",
    "[ sedsec ] .",
    "we also attempted simultaneous 7-component fits to the raw images , using the previously described fitting results as initial guesses .",
    "although such models can be made to converge by fixing some of the parameters , they lead to very elongated ellipsoids for one or more components . our tempered approach results in a more physically plausible model that is motivated and supported by the longer wavelength images . indeed",
    ", the final fitted positions at 1.3  mm for components mm1b and mm1f agree with their 7  mm positions to within 0015 and 0010 , respectively .",
    "in contrast , following the trend observed for the longer wavelength data for mm1d , we find the 1.3  mm position offset @xmath119 south of the 1.5  cm and 7  mm position , and thus @xmath120 south of the 5  cm emission .",
    "we began our analysis of the mm2 millimeter emission by fitting and removing a single gaussian component from the 1.3  mm image .",
    "the resulting residual image shows a compact component of emission near the 1.3  mm continuum peak ( mm2a ) , consistent with the core - halo structure seen in the @xmath99 image ( fig .",
    "[ spix ] ) , and a weaker unresolved residual source toward the location of the 7  mm source mm2b . in order to better constrain the ` core - halo ' morphology of the bulk of the 1.3  mm emission from mm2 , narrow and broad gaussian components were simultaneously fit to the 1.3  mm image .",
    "the new resulting residual image is noise - like ( apart from mm2b ) and the fitted parameters are well - constrained and are thus likely representative of the true morphology , though the solution may not be unique .",
    "this procedure was repeated for the 3  mm image , with the single gaussian fit again showing a distinct compact residual toward mm2a , but this time not toward mm2b ( likely owing to the poorer angular resolution of the 3  mm data ) . using the 1.3  mm model parameters as initial guesses , the 3  mm image was also fit with a narrow and a broad component .",
    "the position and size of the 3  mm ` core ' component are in good agreement with those at 1.3  mm , as is the position of the broad component .",
    "however , the fitted size of the broad 3  mm component is larger by @xmath121 , possibly a consequence of the modestly higher sensitivity of the 3  mm data to larger scale structures . as a result , though we have tabulated the fit results for both components of mm2a in table  [ properties ] , we consider only the values for mm2a - core to be sufficiently reliable to construct and further interpret its sed .    for the mm4 region , at 3 and 1.3  mm",
    "a single gaussian component was first fit to the compact emission , which we denote as mm4a .",
    "then the residual image was used to fit a gaussian to mm6 located to the north of mm4a ( see fig .  [ zoom ] ) .",
    "these residual images also show a filamentary tail south of mm4a , but since the emission does not appear compact , we did not attempt to fit its properties ( however it is included in the mm4 total flux density in table  [ properties ] , as is mm6 ) .",

    "nevertheless , our compact size measurements allow us to determine whether or not the sources are likely to be centrally heated . in models of accretion flows onto massive protostars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the dust emission is expected to become optically thick in the inner regions leading to an effective photosphere . by taking the observed radius and brightness temperature ,",

    "thus , we can safely conclude that four of the cores ( mm1a - d ) are centrally heated and contain protostars , while mm1f is a borderline case .",
    "the values of @xmath171 also allow us to estimate upper limits to the dust temperature . because mm1 dominates the total millimeter continuum emission from ngc6334i , it is likely responsible for a large fraction of the bolometric luminosity of this deeply - embedded region :",

    "in any case , mm1b and mm1d are the two sources with the hottest dust .    as discussed in ",
    "[ sedsec ] , free - free emission with a rising spectrum that remains unresolved at high angular resolution and is embedded in strong dust continuum emission at shorter wavelengths is likely to originate from an hchii region .",
    "the emission from mm1b falls into this category ( see fig .",
    "[ seds1 ] ) , with a fitted size @xmath246  au .",
    "thus the emission from this source likely originates from a combination of an hchii region surrounded by warm dust .",
    "in contrast , as described in   [ fitsec ] , the longer wavelength emission from mm1d appears to shift slightly to the north with increasing wavelength , a hallmark of free - free jet emission due to the expected increase in angular size of the jet major axis with wavelength @xcite .",
    "the sed of mm1f is consistent with warm dust emission , with no detectable free - free emission .",
    "additional evidence for the jet interpretation for the longer wavelength data from mm1d comes from the fact that this source is the loci of red and blue - shifted h@xmath11o masers (   [ watersec ] ; fig .",
    "[ h2o ] ) .",
    "the kinematics of these masers are complex , but there is a general trend of red - shifted emission toward the ne of mm1d and blue - shifted emission to the sw . given that this gradient is consistent with the orientation of the large - scale molecular outflow observed in this region ( see   [ watersec ] ) , we suggest that mm1d is the driving source , with the water masers tracing the innermost jet / outflow structure .",
    "higher angular resolution and sensitivity multi - wavelength imaging will be required to confirm and constrain the properties of the putative mm1d jet .",
    "there is also a cluster of water masers just south of mm1b that form a linear structure , suggestive of a jet , though without a clear increase in velocity with distance .",
    "given the close proximity of mm1b and mm1d ( projected separation of 440  au ) and their multiple signs of protostellar activity ( including having the highest dust temperatures ) , they may represent a proto - binary system , or at least a transient bound system that has resulted from gravitational interaction .",

    "even if only a few of the components contain central protostars , the number density would be @xmath250  pc@xmath251 , which is already above the estimated order of magnitude required for interactions to lead to binary mergers ( @xmath252  pc@xmath251 ; * ? ? ?",

    "dashed line ) , anchored at the 1.3  mm flux density , is in good agreement with the observed 3 to 1.3  mm spectral index .",
    "however , in all four cases , this dust model also predicts that the 7  mm emission should have been easily detectable at the @xmath255 ( mm1e and mm1 g ) to @xmath256 ( mm1a and mm1c ) level , in stark contrast to the data .",
    "indeed , mm1c should also have been marginally detected at 1.5  cm based on the alma data .",
    "there are several possibilities for the origin of these discrepant seds : ( 1 ) calibration errors ; ( 2 ) mismatched uv - coverage ; ( 3 ) unusual dust spectral properties ; and ( 4 ) source variability .",
    "we discuss each of these in turn below .",
    "perhaps the simplest explanation is calibration errors , either in the vla data , especially at 7  mm , or the alma data at 3 and 1.3  mm .",
    "however , as shown in fig .",
    "[ seds1 ] , many sources show entirely normal seds that are well fit by dust with @xmath150 , along with a free - free component in some cases .",
    "additionally , the absolute calibrations were re - examined carefully and are believed to be accurate to better than @xmath31 .",
    "likewise , mismatched uv - coverage leading to different degrees of spatial filtering for example is very unlikely to be an explanation because ( a ) these `` strange sed '' sources have similar fitted sizes to all the other detected sources ( apart from the uchii region mm3 ) , and ( b ) the 7  mm data actually have better uv - coverage at short baselines compared to either the 3  mm or 1.3  mm data .",
    "we also explored whether a steeper dust emissivity spectral index @xmath104 could explain the data , in a similar way to mm1d ( see   [ sedsec ] ) .",
    "the sed plots for mm1a , mm1c , mm1e , and mm1 g ( fig .",
    "[ seds2 ] ) are also over - plotted with a solid line with @xmath257 corresponding to @xmath258 , the steepest values found in laboratory measurements of 100 - 200  k grains in the literature @xcite . we find that the 7  mm non - detections of mm1e and mm1 g are marginally consistent with this steeper @xmath104 , but these two sources would need to be somewhat optically thick to account for the shallower slope between 3 and 1.3  mm . in contrast , the non - detection of 7  mm continuum emission for mm1a and mm1c remains a mystery even with this steep @xmath104 .",
    "thus , at least for mm1a and mm1c we are left with the intriguing possibility that the flux density of these two sources has grown significantly between 2011 when the 7  mm data were acquired and 2015 when the alma data were acquired .    variability in the bulk dust emission from a deeply embedded protostellar source is theoretically plausible even on significantly shorter timescales of weeks to months @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the high density of protostellar sources in mm1 increases the likelihood of an outburst due to an accretion event resulting from a disk instability driven by a recent encounter between two protostars @xcite .",
    "recently , the first outbursting class  0 source was discovered ( hops 383 in orion ) , which increased in @xmath259 m brightness by a factor of 35 in only a few years , with an associated brightening in the submillimeter by at least a factor of two @xcite .",
    "interestingly , if one subtracts a 1.5  jy contribution from each of the apparently variable sources mm1a and mm1c from the 2015 alma 1.3  mm integrated intensity of ngc6334i , then the agreement with the 1.3  mm sma value from epoch may 2005 @xcite is much better than described in   [ contsec ] , with the percent difference dropping to @xmath35 .",
    "the remaining flux densities of @xmath260  jy would then be consistent with the 7  mm upper limits for mm1a and mm1c using the value of @xmath104 ( 2.4 ) found for mm1d . while this interpretation is intriguing , it is clear that future monitoring of the mm1 sources across the centimeter to millimeter range will be necessary to confirm such rapid changes in flux density and to begin to constrain the mechanism responsible for it .",
    "we find the continuum emission of mm2 to be significantly more compact than mm1 . as described in ",
    "[ contsec ] and [ fitsec ] , mm2 exhibits a distinct core - halo morphology in its 3 to 1.3  mm spectral index , which is also evident as a significant compact residual at the peak of the emission of mm2a when the emission is fit with a single gaussian .",

    "indeed , recent alma studies of massive protoclusters @xcite have revealed evidence for both low - mass and high - mass cores forming coevally in the same parent clump .",
    "in addition to the compact dust sources that we have identified and discussed , the fainter filamentary dust emission extending from mm1 , mm2 and mm4 is of considerable interest . the most notable structures ( fig  [ zoom ] ) extend to the northwest of mm1 g ( total 1.3  mm flux density @xmath276  mjy ) and the southwest of mm4a ( @xmath277  mjy ) .",

    "it is notable that chromospherically active pmss with radio emission are typically time variable and they also often emit in x - rays .",

    "our new alma and vla radio continuum observations spanning 5  cm to 1.3  mm with comparable resolution  as fine as 220  au  have revealed exciting new features and phenomena in the ngc6334i massive protocluster .    *",
    "the dominant millimeter source , mm1 , is resolved into seven compact ( r@xmath96300  au ) components within a radius of 1000 au , four of which have brightness temperatures exceeding 200  k , implying minimum luminosities of @xmath283  @xmath3 and indicative of central heating .",
    "we interpret this structure as a  hot multi - core  in which at least four massive protostars are independently heating their surrounding cocoons of gas and dust .",
    "several components of mm1 exhibit steep millimeter seds indicative of either unusual dust spectral properties or time variability . *",
    "the two hottest dust sources , mm1b and mm1d , also exhibit free - free emission consistent with a hchii region and a jet , respectively , as well as associated water maser structures .",
    "the close pairing of these two objects ( 440  au separation ) suggests that they form either a proto - binary star or a transient bound system .",
    "we suggest that mm1d is the driving source of the large - scale bipolar outflow from this region based on the water maser kinematics . *",
    "the secondary hot core region , mm2 , is less extended than mm1 , yet also contains evidence for multiple components , mm2a and mm2b , with significantly different millimeter spectral indices consistent with optically - thin and optically - thick dust , respectively .",
    "a 6.7  ghz class ii ch@xmath10oh maser lies between the two objects . *",
    "the enigmatic continuum source mm4a shows a 1.3  mm brightness temperature of 97  k , and a fit to its sed implies a dust optical depth of @xmath284 at 1.3  mm .",
    "our detection of water maser emission at the systemic velocity of the cluster proves that it is not a background object .",
    "the lack of thermal molecular lines remains difficult to understand , given the physical conditions , and we suggest that it may trace a rare evolutionary phase of a high mass protostar .",
    "* in addition to the four previously known millimeter sources , we detect 5 new objects at 1.3  mm whose emission may originate from circumstellar disks around low to intermediate mass protostars .",
    "we also detect two new objects at centimeter wavelengths , one of which ( cm1 ) has an infrared stellar counterpart and an sed consistent with an ionized stellar wind .",
    "the other ( cm2 ) has a non - thermal spectral index ( -0.5 ) and is associated with the strongest water maser emission in the cluster . while it shares these two characteristics with w3oh - h2o , cm2 , in contrast , has no dust emission and may represent a unique object .    in summary ,",
    "the picture of ngc6334i emerging from these new observations is a diverse collection of young stellar objects in various states of formation and activity .",
    "in addition to the trapezium - like arrangement of the four principle objects mm1-mm4 , we now have evidence that two of these objects are themselves multiple systems , extending the analogy to the orion trapezium stars to a second level .",
    "our results support the conclusion from @xmath247-body simulations that trapezium - like systems appear frequently in the formation of a cluster @xcite , while the close proximity of the seven components of mm1 highlights the inevitably dynamic nature of such proto - ob systems . finally , the intriguing possibility that the dust emission from mm1 is time variable highlights the importance of future observations of both its continuum and maser emission .",
