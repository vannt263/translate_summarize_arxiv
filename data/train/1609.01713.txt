    "massive early - type galaxies ( etgs ) reveal halos of hot gas .",
    "this x - ray emitting diffuse gas varies in luminosity by a factor of @xmath3100 - 1000 for a given optical luminosity , or equivalently , stellar mass ( osullivan , forbes & ponman 2001 ; fabbiano 2006 ; boroson , kim & fabbiano 2011 ) .",
    "it has been suggested that stellar mass loss dominates the source of this gas ( sun et al .",
    "2007 ; sarzi et al . 2013 ) . however , in a large x - ray study of etgs , goulding et al .",
    "( 2016 ) concluded that the data are not consistent with a simple stellar mass loss picture .",
    "an additional source of gas is indicated by the cold dark matter ( cdm ) paradigm for galaxy formation . here",
    "infalling pristine gas in massive halos is shock - heated to x - ray emitting temperatures as these halos collapse .",
    "the hot gas slowly cools while emitting x - rays , with the x - ray luminosity directly related to the depth of the potential well ( white & frenk 1991 ) . in the gimic simulations of crain",
    "et al . ( 2010 ) , the density of the hot gas is less concentrated than that of the canonical dark matter density profile .",
    "this leads to much lower x - ray luminosities than predicted by white & frenk ( 1991 ) , which is then closer to the x - ray luminosity as observed from late - type galaxy halos .",
    "however , for early - type galaxies , agn heating of hot gas is also potentially important .",
    "recently , choi et al . (",
    "2015 ) included agn in cosmological models of massive etgs .",
    "they found better agreement with the x - ray luminosities of etgs than when using models without agn feedback , although some discrepancies remained .",
    "these cosmological simulations all suggest that the key parameter determining the luminosity of the diffuse x - ray gas ( l@xmath0 ) is the galaxy mass ( which determines the depth of the potential well ) with agn perhaps playing a secondary role in etgs .    combining new _",
    "chandra _ data with results from the literature , kim & fabbiano ( 2013 ; kf13 ) have shown that the dynamical ( i.e. baryonic plus dark matter ) mass may indeed be the key parameter in determining l@xmath0 surrounding an etg ( see also mathews et al .",
    "in particular , they showed that measurements of l@xmath0 correlated strongly with the dynamical mass within 5 r@xmath1 ( where r@xmath1 is the effective radius of the galaxy optical light ) for a sample of 14 early - type galaxies .",
    "the total mass measurements within 5 r@xmath1 came from the work of deason et al . ( 2012 ) who used a combination of planetary nebulae ( pne ) and globular cluster ( gc ) kinematics from the literature , and the assumption of power - law mass and tracer density profiles .    here",
    ", we use a homogeneous analysis of dynamical masses from gc kinematics within 5 r@xmath1 for 29 etgs ( alabi et al .",
    "this analysis is based on data from the sluggs survey ( brodie et al .",
    "2014 ) and supplemented by data from the literature .",
    "x - ray gas luminosities mostly come from the compilation of kim & fabbiano ( 2015 ; hereafter kf15 ) and are extracted from radii which vary from 30 to 240 arcsec ( @xmath3 2 - 5 r@xmath1 . ) we investigate the trends of the x - ray gas luminosity for our sample with stellar mass , dynamical mass within 5 r@xmath1 and with extrapolated virial mass .",
    "we compare these new observations with simulated galaxy halos from crain et al .",
    "( 2010 ) and choi et al .",
    "( 2015 ) , and discuss whether the hot gas halos around etgs are consistent with an origin , and heating mechanisms , as described by the @xmath2cdm paradigm .",
    "globular cluster kinematics for galaxies from the sluggs survey are supplemented by literature data for ngc 1316 , 1399 , 4472 and 4636 to give a total sample of 29 galaxies , to derive dynamical masses ( alabi et al . 2017 ) .",
    "the sluggs ( brodie et al . 2014 ) survey targets nearby etgs with stellar masses around 10@xmath4 m@xmath5 .",
    "the survey has accumulated over 4000 high precision gc velocities ( see e.g. pota et al .",
    "2013 ) .",
    "dynamical masses for the sample galaxies have been derived from the gc kinematics by alabi et al .",
    "they used the tracer mass estimator of watkins et al .",
    "( 2010 ) with the assumption of isotropic orbits for the gcs ( mildly radial or tangential orbits give masses within @xmath310% of the isotropic case ) .",
    "small corrections have been made for flattening , rotation or substructures within the gc systems . in fig .",
    "1 we show a comparison of the total dynamical mass within 5r@xmath1 used in this work with that used by kf13 , i.e. from deason et al .",
    "although there is a reasonable match between the two studies , fig.1 shows that alabi et al .",
    "( 2017 ) find systematically higher masses for low mass galaxies than deason et al .",
    "the masses for most of these low mass galaxies were derived using pne , which alabi et al .",
    "( 2016 ) showed may underestimate the true galaxy mass compared to other tracers of mass ( i.e. gcs and x - rays ) .",
    "here we use the alabi et al .",
    "( 2017 ) masses which are derived only from gcs . assuming an nfw - like halo , alabi et al .",
    "( 2017 ) also estimated the total virial mass for each galaxy by extrapolating from the 5r@xmath1 mass .",
    "the diffuse hot gas x - ray luminosities in the 0.3 - 8 kev band are taken from the work of kf15 .",
    "they have carefully removed the contribution from discrete sources such as low mass x - ray binaries ( fabbiano 2006 ) to the total x - ray luminosity , leaving the diffuse gas contribution l@xmath0 . a correction to bolometric would increase the x - ray luminosities by 0.08 dex on average .",
    "most of the x - ray data come from _ chandra _ observations .",
    "however , for some high mass galaxies the x - ray emission is particularly extended ( e.g. ngc 4374 , 4486 , 4649 , 5846 ) and in those cases _ rosat _ data from osullivan , forbes & ponman ( 2001 ) , corrected to the _ chandra _ energy band , are used .",
    "although the contribution from discrete sources in the rosat data can not be subtracted as accurately as it can for chandra data , their contribution is only about 1% of the diffuse gas luminosity for these high mass galaxies ( see osullivan , forbes & ponman 2001 ) . for further details",
    "here we make a very small correction to the kf15 l@xmath0 luminosities for the distances used in the sluggs survey ( brodie et al .",
    "the kf15 compilation did not include several galaxies that appear in the alabi et al .",

    "the x - ray emission centred on ngc 1400 , they detected an enhanced region of x - rays to the ne of the galaxy that they associated with stripped gas .",
    "here we use the x - ray luminosity centred on ngc 1400 with a small adjustment to our x - ray band and distance , and assume an uncertainty of 20% .",

    "the choi et al .",
    "simulations support the interpretation that the data are well represented by a single linear relation .",
    "we note that choi et al . compared their predictions with the best fit relation of kf13 ( which used masses from deason et al .",

    "however , with our updated measurements their predictions now reveal a good match to the observations of l@xmath0 and virial mass .",
    "we note that several of the galaxies in our sample show ` hot cores ' ( i.e. central gas temperatures that are hotter than the surrounding gas ) when spatially resolved temperture profiles are available , e.g. ngc 1316 ( kim & fabbiano 2013 ) , ngc 3115 ( wong et al .",
    "2011 ) , ngc 4278 ( pellegrini et al .",
    "2012 ) and ngc 4649 ( paggi et al . 2014 ) .",
    "these hot cores are thought to be due to recent heating by the agn and/or associated radio jets ( e.g. paggi et al .",
    "the influence of agn may extend down to our lowest stellar masses of 10@xmath18 m@xmath5 ( cheung et al .",
    "2016 ) .",
    "kf13 found that the most x - ray luminous ( log l@xmath0 @xmath19 40 ) galaxies ( i.e. 7 galaxies after excluding ngc 4374 which deviated significantly from their trend ) revealed significantly less scatter than the 6 low x - ray luminosity galaxies . with our sample of 29 galaxies , and a new 5 r@xmath1 dynamical mass for ngc 4374 , we find it lies well within the distribution of the x - ray luminous galaxies .",
    "we note that the @xmath33 gyr old merger remnant galaxy ngc 1316 ( fornax a ) also lies within the scatter of the general trend .",
    "using a sample of 61 galaxies , kf15 were able to explore the l@xmath0t@xmath13 relation subdivided by the shape of their central optical profile , i.e. core or cusp like .",
    "they found that core galaxies , which tend to be x - ray luminous , have a very tight relation .",
    "in contrast , low x - ray luminosity cusp galaxies revealed no clear correlation between l@xmath0 and t@xmath13 . in fig .",
    "2 we have colour - coded our sample by their central optical profile ( see table 1 ) .",
    "the galaxies are classified as core , cusp , intermediate or unknown surface brightness profile from krajnovic et al .",
    "( 2013 ) or lauer et al .",
    "we note that there is some disagreement in the literature about the central profile in some galaxies , e.g. dullo & graham ( 2013 ) suggested that ngc 4473 does not contain a central core but rather a disk .    in all three panels",
    ", the sample divides clearly between core ( high x - ray luminosity ) and cusp ( low x - ray luminosity ) galaxies , with 5 additional galaxies ( 3 unknown and 2 intermediate profiles ) .",
    "the sample divides more clearly in terms of l@xmath0 than mass ( see also pellegrini 2005 ) .",
    "we note that the central profile shape correlates very strongly with central rotation , i.e. core galaxies @xmath20 slow rotators , and cusp galaxies @xmath20 fast rotators ( krajnovic et al . 2013 ) .",
    "focusing on the middle panel , the 17 core galaxies reveal a somewhat tighter relation than the 9 cuspy galaxies .",
    "we find a p - value for the spearman rank correlation test of 0.0007 for the core galaxies , whereas the cusp galaxies have a value of 0.26 indicating almost no relation .",
    "a bisector fit to only the cuspy galaxies also suggests no statistically significant relation .",
    "this supports the findings of kf15 and suggests that sn heating may play an increased role in cuspy ( low mass ) etgs ( david et al .",
    "so although the x - ray luminosity of both core ( high x - ray luminosity ) and cuspy ( low x - ray luminosity ) etgs are primarily determined by total mass , and hence the depth of the potential well , other factors may play a role for the lower mass galaxies .",
    "using new dynamical masses we find a strong linear relationship between the diffuse gas x - ray luminosity for a sample of 29 nearby massive early - type galaxies and their total dynamical mass within 5 r@xmath1 .",
    "this result supports the earlier analysis by kf13 based on 14 galaxies .",
    "we also show that the cosmological simulations of choi et al .",
    "( 2015 ) , which incorporate agn mechanical heating , now agree with observations of the x - ray luminosity and mass within 5 r@xmath1 .",
    "this good agreement with model galaxies in a cosmological framework supports the idea that the diffuse x - ray luminosity is primarily driven by the depth of a galaxy s potential well , with a significant contribution from agn mechanical heating .",
    "supernova heating may contribute in lower mass galaxies .",
