    ", the sky level was measured using the dedicated sky lenses and subtracted from the target spectra .",
    "arc lamp exposures were taken before and after each target frame for wavelength calibration .",
    "tungsten lamp exposures were also taken at the beginning and end of each night in order to build the mask necessary to extract the data from the ccd frames .",
    "flux and lick absorption line standard stars were observed during each observing run for calibration purposes . since the flux standards and the galaxies were not always observed under the same conditions , the fluxes quoted in this paper are approximate .",
    "differences in the flux calibration between observing runs are , however , smaller than 6% ( see paper vi ) .",
    "the individually extracted and flux calibrated datacubes were finally merged by truncating the wavelength domain to a common range and spatially resampling the spectra to a common squared grid .",
    "the dithering of individual exposures enabled us to sample the merged datacube onto @xmath12 pixels .    during the eighth",
    "observing run , the grating of the instrument was replaced by a volume phase holographic grating ( vph ) .",
    "this change gave an increase in sensitivity of the instrument .",
    "only two galaxies in our sample are affected by this change ( ngc4220 , ngc4293 ) .",
    "a specifically designed mask model ( see paper i for details ) was produced for the extraction of the data in this run .",
    "all the procedures described above are valid for both configurations .    in order to ensure the measurement of reliable stellar kinematics , we spatially binned our final datacubes using the voronoi 2d binning algorithm of @xcite , creating compact bins with a minimum signal - to - noise ratio ( @xmath13 ) of @xmath14 per spectral resolution element .",
    "most spectra in the central regions , however , have @xmath13 in excess of @xmath15 , and so remain un - binned .",

    "the origin of the images is rather heterogeneous , so the final set of images used in this paper comes from observations made in several photometric filters .",
    "since no _ hst_/wfpc2 image was available for ngc4220 , acs / f814w imaging was used instead . in the cases with no",
    "_ hst _ or with poor signal - to - noise imaging ( e.g. , _",
    "hst_/wfpc2/f300w ) we used ground - based photometry , in the f555w and f814w filters , from the 1.3 m mcgraw - hill telescope at the mdm observatory on kitt peak .",
    "the mdm images are part of a complete photometric survey of the ` sauron `  galaxies and will be described elsewhere .",
    "the use of this photometric dataset is two - fold .",
    "first , it allows us to generate unsharp - masked images , to highlight any small scale structures that might be present in the galaxies .",
    "second , we used the hst images to accurately determine the point spread function ( psf ) of each merged exposure , by comparing them to the reconstructed ` sauron `  intensity distribution .",
    "we followed the procedure outlined in paper iii to derive the psf values . where hst imaging is not available",
    ", we quote the value from the seeing monitor during the observations .",
    "table  [ tab : allgal ] summarises the hst imaging used ( i.e. , in the available filter closest to the v - band ) , and lists the seeing estimate for each galaxy .",
    "cases with no hst imaging are indicated by wht.-2",
    "we measured the stellar kinematics of the 24 sa spiral bulges using the penalized pixel - fitting ( ppxf ) method of @xcite .",
    "we made use of the library of single age , single metallicity population ( ssp ) models from @xcite as stellar templates .",
    "we selected a representative set of 48 ssp models evenly sampling a wide range in age and metallicity ( 1.00 @xmath16 age @xmath16 17.38 gyr , -1.68 @xmath16 [ fe / h ] @xmath16 + 0.20 ) .",
    "this set of templates differs from the one used in paper iii in that we expanded the range of metallicities to include more metal - poor templates .",
    "this was necessary to be able to accurately match the main absorption features in our galaxies .",
    "exclusion of these models resulted in a poor match of the overall spectrum and therefore a bias in the measured parameters.-2    a non - negative linear combination of ssp models , convolved with a gauss - hermite series @xcite , was fitted to each individual spectrum .",
    "the best - fitting parameters were determined by chi - squared minimization in pixel space . in the wavelength range covered by ` sauron ` , a few potential emission lines were masked during the fitting procedure ( , , ) .",
    "additionally , a low - order legendre polynomial was included in the fit to account for small differences in the continuum shape between the galaxy spectra and the input library of synthetic models.-1    our sample of spiral galaxies displays stellar velocity dispersions that are , in general , much lower than those found in the ellipticals and lenticulars in paper iii .",
    "given the instrumental sampling of ` sauron `  ( 60  per pixel ) , some bias in the determination of the stellar velocity dispersion might be expected for values below @xmath17120 .",
    "this bias can me minimised by choosing an adequate penalisation factor ( @xmath18 ) in ppxf .",
    "we carried out simulations to determine the best factor for our dataset , and a value of @xmath19 was adopted , as in paper iii .",
    "the level of uncertainty of the velocity dispersion @xmath20 , for this penalization factor , was extensively tested in paper iii by means of monte - carlo simulations .",
    "as shown in figure  2 of that paper , for a spectrum with a @xmath13 of @xmath14 and an intrinsic @xmath20 as low as 50 , the measured velocity dispersion differs from the intrinsic one by , at most , @xmath1710  even for extreme @xmath21 and @xmath22 values , which is within the estimated errors . in practice",
    "only the outer bins in our maps ( i.e. the ones with the lowest velocity dispersions ) are affected by this bias .",
    "typical spectra from our sample of galaxies contain significant amounts of nebular emission in the ` sauron `  wavelength range .",
    "however , stellar absorption features are still dominant overall , and therefore the measurement of the gas distribution and kinematics requires a careful separation of the line emission from the stellar absorption .",
    "for this , we follow the procedure described in paper v. briefly , this method consists of searching iteratively for the emission - line velocities and velocity dispersions , while linearly solving at each step for both their amplitudes and the optimal combination of the stellar templates over the full ` sauron `  wavelength range .",
    "no masking of the regions affected by emission is thus required .",
    "the stellar kinematics is held fixed during the fitting process .",
    "a low - order legendre polynomial ( typically of order 6 ) is included in the fit to account for small differences between the galaxy spectra and the input library of synthetic models .",
    "we refer the reader to paper v for a more detailed description of the method , limitations , and sensitivity limits .    in general , the amount of emission in both  and  is important in our sample . in some galaxies we are also able to detect significant emission from the  doublet , but in most cases",
    "this is very weak and it is difficult to establish its kinematics . as observations of the  and  lines ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and the  and  emission lines ( e.g. , @xcite ) display similar kinematics , we do not expect to find significant differences between the kinematics of  and .",
    "given the small amount of information the  maps add to our results , we do not show them here .",
    "they will be made available with the public data release.-2    as the ionised gas is collisional and dissipative , the emission - line maps can exhibit complicated morphologies and kinematics @xcite . in practice",
    "this could translate into complex emission - line profiles due to the superposition of distinct gas clouds .",
    "we carefully inspected the emission line profiles in our data to search for asymmetric profiles , but we could not find any significant deviation from a pure gaussian in the majority of our galaxies . only a few cases revealed complex profiles in specific regions close to their centre , possibly related to their agn nature ( e.g. , ngc2273 ) .",
    "the lack of such complex profiles in the rest of our sample may be , at least in part , due to ` sauron ` s limited spectral resolution .",
    "we therefore fitted a single gaussian profile to each line in our wavelength range .",
    "we fixed the amplitude ratio of the  emission - line doublet to 1:3 @xcite , and to 0.7:2 for the  lines k and electron densities from 0.1 @xmath23 to 1000 @xmath23 @xcite ] .",
    "as gas clouds may be ionised by different mechanisms , it is possible that in certain regions of the galaxies the ionisation of  is more efficient than  and viceversa . given that in general our sample galaxies display very strong emission , we looked for differences in the kinematics by fitting these two emission lines independently .",
    "based on the simulations performed in paper v , we considered true detection of emission when the ratio of the amplitude of the emission line to the surrounding noise ( @xmath24 , see paper v ) is larger than 5 , 4 , and 4 for , , and  respectively .",
    "as demonstrated in papers ii , iii and v for e and s0 galaxies , the methods used to derive the stellar and ionised - gas kinematics produce comparable results with those published in the literature . here , we report similar comparisons to assess the robustness of these methods for our sample of sa bulges , where emission is much more prominent and stellar velocity dispersions are smaller .",
    "literature measurements for our sample of sa bulges are relatively scarce and come from heterogeneous sources , which often also implies different aperture sizes and slit position angles .",
    "we used the compilation in the on - line catalogue hyperleda @xcite for the comparison of the stellar kinematics , and the palomar spectroscopic survey @xcite for the line - width of the ionised gas .",
    "we measured the stellar velocity dispersions and fwhm of the  emission lines from a standard central aperture of @xmath25 extracted from our ` sauron `  maps .",
    "this aperture size was chosen to match the apertures in the palomar survey .",
    "for the stellar velocity dispersions , apertures were aligned along the axis reported in the individual references ( i.e. @xcite ) .",
    "we only considered literature values with reported errors below 10  ( i.e. , the typical error estimate of our measurements ) .",
    "for the ionised - gas measurements , we used the position angle of the palomar long - slit observations .",
    "we excluded from the comparison galaxies with strong non - gaussian emission - line profiles ( i.e. , agn - like ) , as the single gaussian used in our method is not an accurate representation of those line profiles .",
    "uncertainties in the  fwhm in the palomar survey were typically 10% , except in ngc4596 for which the reported uncertainty is 40% .    on the top panel of figure  [ fig : comparison ]",
    "we show the result of the comparison for the stellar velocity dispersions .",
    "a linear regression was fitted to the combined datasets .",
    "we made use of the _ fitexy _ routine taken from the idl astro - library @xcite to fit a linear relation of the form @xmath26 , where @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "the value of @xmath29 was chosen to be 150 to minimise the uncertainty in the fitted intercept .",
    "the resultant fit provides a slope of @xmath30 and an intercept of @xmath31 .",
    "our measurements are thus in good agreement with those in the literature . on the bottom panel",
    "we plot the results for the ionised - gas fwhms .",
    "a similar linear regression fit gives a slope of @xmath32 and intercept of @xmath33 .",
    "while a correlation between the  fwhm and  fwhm may be expected if these lines are produced in low - density reservoirs @xcite , given the strong dependence of the line widths on the critical densities it is possible that this assumption does not hold for all galaxies in our sample . considering this result and all the possible systematic effects at play in this comparison ,",
    "our measurements seem to be in good agreement with those of @xcite .",
    "additionally , we tested the reliability of our measurements by checking the quality of the optimal template fits to the spectra in our galaxies . in figure",
    "[ fig : optemp ] we show these fits for one of the most critical cases in our sample : ngc4314 @xcite .",
    "we chose to illustrate this example because of the wide range of emission - line fluxes in the  map relative to the underlying stellar continuum . in this galaxy ,",
    "most of the emission is confined to a ring of radius @xmath1710 . outside the ring",
    "the amount of  flux decreases by more than a factor 100 .",
    "the different panels in this figure demonstrate that our method is able to produce very good fits to the spectra in several distinct regions of the galaxy , and that our results are not biased because of an inadequate matching of the spectra .",
    "similar agreement is found for the rest of the sample of galaxies .",
    "figures  [ fig : n1056]-[fig : n7742 ] display maps of the absorption and emission - line distribution and kinematics of the 24 sa galaxies in our sample .",
    "the maps are displayed according to increasing ngc number . in each case , we show ( _ first row _ ) an unsharp - masked image of the galaxy from either hst or ground - based mdm data ( see section  [ sec : imaging ] ) .",
    "the _ second row _ displays the total intensity reconstructed from the ` sauron `  spectra ( in mag / arcsec@xmath34 with an arbitrary zero point ) , the mean stellar radial velocity @xmath10 , and velocity dispersion @xmath20 ( both in ) .",
    "third _ and _ fourth _ row presents the flux ( in logarithmic scale ) , mean velocity and velocity dispersion ( both in ) of the  and  emission lines , respectively .",
    "the _ fifth _ row shows the /  ratio map ( in logarithmic scale ) , as well as the stellar gauss ",
    "hermite velocity moments @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "the maps of the ionised gas were constructed according to the @xmath24 ratios set in  [ subsec : gaskin ] .",
    "data bins with @xmath24 values below these thresholds are displayed in dark grey .",
    "mean stellar radial velocities are with respect to estimated heliocentric systemic velocities , the values of which are provided ( corrected for the barycentric motion ) in table  [ tab : allgal ] .",
    "the same heliocentric systemic velocity is assumed in the emission - line velocity maps .",
    "detailed descriptions of the different maps are collected in appendix  [ sec : galaxies_notes ] . here , we concentrate on an overview of the general trends and results observed .",
    "inspection of the different figures reveals a wide range of kinematic structures .",
    "the presence of dust in our galaxies can have , in many cases , a strong impact on the measured stellar kinematics , as it affects the amount of light we receive along the line - of - sight . despite the dust , and as expected for sa galaxies , the maps show clear stellar rotation even at low galaxy inclinations ( e.g. , ngc7742 ) .",
    "kinematically decoupled components occur frequently in the inner regions ( ngc1056 , ngc2273 , ngc3623 , ngc4235 , ngc4245 , ngc4274 , ngc4596 , ngc5448 , ngc5689 , ngc7742 ) .",
    "these structures are usually detected in the stellar velocity maps alone ( as a sudden change in velocity , or pinching of the isovelocity contours close to the centre ) , but often they are also associated with a drop in the velocity dispersion and anti - correlated @xmath21 values with respect to the stellar velocities .",
    "moreover , they are generally related to features in the photometry , such as bars or central dust discs and rings .",
    "these structures are in nearly all cases co - rotating and aligned with the main body of the galaxy .",
    "the flattening of the isovelocities of these components suggests that these might be inner discs or rings .",
    "in addition , there are a few galaxies in the sample ( ngc4698 and ngc5953 ) that have kinematically decoupled components which are misaligned with respect to the major axis of the galaxy",
    ".    velocity dispersion minima ( i.e. , ` velocity dispersion drops ' ) are common in our sample .",
    "we observe distinct dispersion drops in 11 out of 24 galaxies ( 46% ) .",
    "this is probably a lower limit considering the medium spatial resolution of our ` sauron `  data .",
    "only 4 of these 11 cases are known to have an active nucleus .",
    "recent long - slit studies @xcite revealed a velocity dispersion drop frequency of about 40% in a sample of 30 nearly edge - on s0-sbc galaxies , which is consistent with our findings .",
    "the first observed cases of central velocity dispersion minima date back to the late 80s and early 90s ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , this subject has started to gain attention in the last years ( e.g. , @xcite ) . despite the growth of observational examples ,",
    "the nature of these drops is not well understood .",
    "first theoretical predictions for the presence of these velocity dispersion minima @xcite suggested that they were the natural consequence of inner regions of galaxies following an r@xmath35 light profile @xcite . later on this prediction",
    "was extended to more general r@xmath36 profiles @xcite by @xcite . in practice , these drops are not common in elliptical galaxies ( paper iii ) .",
    "the objects in our sample are sa galaxies with generally large bulges dominating the light in the inner regions . if bulges were scaled - down versions of ellipticals , then one would not expect velocity dispersion drops in sa galaxies . therefore , the observations lead to the picture that sa bulges may have disk properties as well @xcite .",
    "the latest n - body simulations associate the origin of these dispersion minima to kinematically cold components ( i.e. discs ) , formed by gas inflow towards the central regions of the galaxy and subsequent star formation @xcite . however , the importance of dissipative processes @xcite , and the role of bars @xcite is still unclear in this context .    a large fraction of the galaxies with sigma - drops",
    "do indeed show the presence of star formation at the same locations ( as seen from the low /   ratio ) .",
    "the presence of star formation in the inner regions of galaxies , however , does not always translate into a stellar velocity dispersion drop .",
    "given the typical gas consumption time scale in normal disk galaxies ( @xmath17 1 gyr ) , it is possible that many of the galaxies displaying these drops , but not young star formation , have simply used up all the available gas to form stars .",
    "the detection of the drop can also be more difficult due to the inclination of the galaxy , as in face - on configurations the contribution of the dynamically cold stars to the line - of - sight is much smaller than that of the surrounding bulge .",
    "examples of this effect are found in ngc4274 and ngc4314 .",
    "a more in - depth discussion of the link between the velocity dispersion drops and their underlying stellar populations will be the subject of a future paper in this series.-2    some objects in the sample ( ngc2273 , ngc3623 , ngc4220 , ngc4245 , ngc4293 , ngc4369 , ngc4596 , ngc5448 , ngc5636 ) display misaligned photometric and kinematic axes , indicative of a non - axisymmetric structure ( i.e. , a bar ) .",
    "these misalignments are more easily detected at low galaxy inclinations , but it is still possible to recognise the existence of bars by means of their kinematic signatures even for edge - on configurations .",
    "following the pioneering work of @xcite , recent n - body simulations of barred galaxies @xcite have suggested several bar diagnostics making use of the parameters of the gauss - hermite series ( @xmath10 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 ) . in our sample",
    "we find at least five highly - inclined galaxies ( ngc3623 , ngc4235 , ngc4274 , ngc5448 , ngc5689 ) that reveal some of the main kinematic signatures shown in the simulations : double - hump rotation curve , broad velocity dispersion profile with a plateau at moderate radii , and @xmath37 correlation over the projected bar length .",
    "in addition to these bar diagnostics , other features such as boxy isophotes or cylindrical rotation hint at the presence of a bar in ngc4220 and ngc4425 . nuclear star forming rings are also often interpreted in the context of bar driven evolution .",
    "we return to this point in section  [ sec : sfr ] .",
    "as expected , nearly all the galaxies in our sample display significant amounts of ionised - gas emission .",
    "there are only two cases where the detection of ionised gas is marginal or absent ( ngc4425 , ngc6501 ) .",
    "similarly to the stellar kinematics , we can also correlate the presence and spatial morphology of the dust with the distribution seen in the ` sauron `  ionised - gas maps .",
    "dust features in the unsharp - masked images are usually associated with the presence of ionised - gas structures .",
    "however , the inverse is not always true .",
    "this may be due to the fact that dust is much more difficult to detect in face - on systems or is simply not there .",
    "the connection between ionised gas and dust is more evident in the  than in the  emission , which overall also tends to be stronger than .",
    "this difference is particularly apparent in the /  maps . a large fraction of the objects in our sample display very low /ratios , suggesting currently ongoing star formation .",
    "the morphology of star formation regions is varied .",
    "there are six cases in our sample where star formation occurs in ring - like structures ( see sect .",
    "[ sec : sfr ] ) . in some other galaxies",
    ", however , the star - forming regions spread across the main body of the galaxy ( e.g. , ngc1056 ) , align with strong dust lanes ( e.g. , ngc4220 ) or have a more amorphous morphology ( e.g. , ngc4369 , ngc4405 ) . in most of the cases , these low /  regions have gas velocity dispersion values below @xmath1750 .",
    "this suggests that there is a large amount of cold gas present , from which stars have recently formed.-2    the velocity maps of the ionised gas in our sample are consistent with gas motions in a disc co - rotating with the stars . in these cases",
    "the rotational velocities exhibit rotation amplitudes larger than those of the stars , as expected from the dissipative nature of the gas ( and the corresponding smaller asymmetric drift ) .",
    "a few cases depart from this simple description : ngc4772 and ngc5953 , where the gas in certain regions rotates almost perpendicularly to the stars ; ngc7742 , where the gas counter - rotates with respect to the stars ; ngc4383 , which displays mean velocities confined in a jet - like structure ; ngc4369 , that shows no well defined rotation axis , possibly due to the patchy nature of the gas distribution , and ngc3623 , where the gas traces spiral arm structure .",
    "our maps also display differences in the  and  mean velocities and velocity dispersions .",
    "this is particularly apparent in the inner arcseconds ( e.g. , ngc4698 , ngc5475 ) , and sometimes also outside the nuclear regions ( e.g. , ngc5953 , ngc7742 ) .",
    "the measurement of misalignments between structural components in early - type galaxies has often been used to assess the frequency of triaxiality , by measuring differences between the photometric and kinematic major axes ( e.g. , @xcite ) , or to determine the occurrence of accretion events , by measuring the misalignment between the kinematics of the stellar and gaseous component ( e.g. , @xcite ) . here , we measure both types of misalignments to quantify the presence of bars or triaxial bulges and the presence of decoupled gaseous components in our sample , and to investigate their dependence on environment .",
    "we determined the photometric major axis of each galaxy by computing the weighted second moments of the intensity distribution using the large scale ground - based mdm images ( see sect .",

    "this generally corresponds to the position angle of the main disc .",
    "we used the mdm images in the f814w filter to minimise the effects of dust in the determination of the photometric major axis .",
    "the stellar and gaseous kinematic major axes were obtained by finding the position angle that minimised the difference between the ` sauron `  velocity fields and a bi - antisymmetric representation of the velocity field ( see appendix c in @xcite ) .",
    "both methods are robust indicators that provide a good estimate of the _ global _ position angle of the maps used , and thus peculiarities on small scales are not visible in the final distribution of misalignments .",
    "the values of the measured misalignments are listed in table  [ tab : allgal].-2    the study of triaxiality due to past merging events is difficult to assess in our sample of disc galaxies .",
    "spiral galaxies are known to suffer disc instabilities that could eventually lead to the formation of bars ( i.e. , internal triaxial bodies ) . with time , it is likely that the evolution of the bar will erase any signature of triaxiality from any previous merging event . despite the progress in this field , the relative importance of internal versus external processes and their role on the formation of spiral galaxies is not well established yet ( see @xcite for a review on the subject ) .    in figure",
    "[ fig : misalig](a ) , we quantify the degree of misalignment between the stellar surface brightness distribution with respect to the main stellar rotation axis for each galaxy .",
    "the histogram displays a gradually increasing number of galaxies towards small misalignments . as discussed in   [ subsec : stars ] ,",
    "bars are , at least in part , responsible for the spread towards intermediate misalignments . however , in the figure , barred galaxies alone do not account for the observed excess of galaxies at intermediate values .",
    "the presence of dust in many of the galaxies in our sample plays an important role in the observed distribution .",
    "no significant difference is found between field and cluster members .",
    "a ks - test indicates that there is a 78% probability that the distributions of the two classes are identical .",
    "figure  [ fig : misalig](b ) presents a histogram with the observed misalignments between the kinematics of the stars and ionised gas . similarly to panel  [ fig : misalig](a ) there is an excess of galaxies with small misalignments .",
    "the spread towards intermediate misalignments seems to be due to non - circular motions in the ionised - gas velocity fields ( e.g. , ngc5448 , @xcite ) , and to a lesser extent by dust extinction . from these figures",
    ", the misalignment distribution appears to be consistent for field and cluster galaxies ( ks - test , @xmath38=73% ) .",
    "the only two galaxies without ionised - gas detection , ngc4425 and ngc6501 , belong to cluster and field environments , respectively.-2    these results contrast with our findings for early - type galaxies ( paper v ) , as there are no cases displaying misalignments above 60@xmath39 in our sample . the absence of counter - rotating gas and stars or of gas minor - axis rotation in our sample is consistent with the finding of previous surveys ( e.g. , @xcite ) that such phenomena are exceedingly rare in spiral galaxies .",
    "a likely explanation for the observed distribution is that in the event of an accretion of a small satellite by a spiral galaxy , the axisymmetric geometry of the system will cause the accreted material to quickly settle on the main galactic plane , where pre - existing gas would shock with counter - rotating accreted gas , dissipating its angular momentum or inducing star formation ( see also @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "determining the rate at which stars are born in galaxies is key to understanding how galaxies form and evolve . since the first estimates of star - formation rates using colors ( e.g. , @xcite ) , many different diagnostics have been proposed to measure the amount of stellar mass produced in a given time ( i.e. , ultraviolet continuum , recombination lines , forbidden lines , far - infrared continuum ) .",
    "see @xcite for an extensive review on this subject .",
    "-2    in this section we use one of the most widely applied diagnostics to determine the importance of the star formation rate ( sfr ) in our sample of galaxies : the sfr@xmath40  luminosity relation .",
    "we use the prescription of @xcite :    @xmath41    the wavelength range covered by ` sauron `  does not allow for a direct measurement of the  luminosity , but  fluxes instead .",
    "we used the measured hubble flow=71  mpc@xmath42 @xcite .",
    "] , listed in table  [ tab : allgal ] , to convert our observed  fluxes into luminosities . given that many galaxies in our sample display significant amounts of dust , we corrected those  luminosities for dust attenuation .",
    "for the galactic extinction we used the correction factors in @xmath10-band of @xcite as given by the ned database .",
    "we also considered the expected dust extinction of each galaxy due to its inclination .",
    "for that we used the values listed in the hyperleda catalogue , which were determined using the prescription of @xcite .",
    "the values , originally in @xmath11-band , were converted to @xmath10-band assuming the attenuation law of @xcite .",
    "after these corrections , we converted the extinction corrected   luminosities to  luminosities using the theoretical conversion factor 2.86 @xcite .",
    "the sfr was then determined using the equation above . finally , we derived the masses of the ionised gas in each galaxy following @xcite and assuming a case b recombination at t=10,000k with an electron density of @xmath43 @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "table  [ tab : allgal ] lists the values of the observed  fluxes , correction factors for dust extinction , computed extinction corrected  luminosities , star formation rates and ionised - gas masses within the ` sauron `  fov .",
    "following the investigation of the relation between star formation and low ionised - gas velocity dispersions in sigma - drops in  [ subsec : stars ] , we looked at whether a similar empirical relation holds in general in our sample . in figure",
    "[ fig : sfr ] we plot /  ratio and sfr versus the   velocity dispersion for each galaxy .",
    "the /  ratio is the average over the ` sauron `  fov , while the sfr is the total over the same area .",
    "the   velocity dispersion is the luminosity weighted average of the individual measurements over the full ` sauron `  map for each galaxy .",
    "we find that ionised - gas velocity dispersion values are low ( @xmath1750 ) in regions where the /  ratio is also low ( @xmath161 , see fig.[fig : sfr ] , top panel ) .",
    "galaxies displaying the largest sfr are also those showing the lowest   velocity dispersions ( see fig.[fig : sfr ] , bottom panel ) .",
    "the obvious interpretation is that we are seeing stars being formed from cold ( i.e. , low velocity dispersion ) gas .",
    "a similar behaviour is found in ` sauron `  observations of the grand - design spiral galaxy m100 @xcite and ` gmos `  ifu observations of ngc1097 @xcite .",
    "the relation , although still present , becomes much weaker if the  velocity dispersion is used instead , displaying the limitations of the  line as an indicator of star formation .",
    "the star formation rates found here range over several orders of magnitude and appear to be in good agreement with those for normal disc galaxies @xcite . some of the most extreme cases of star formation in our sample appear in the form of circumnuclear star - forming rings . in total",
    "we have detected six ( ngc2844 , ngc4245 , ngc4274 , ngc4314 , ngc5953 , ngc7742 ) in our sample of 24 galaxies , which is consistent with the most recent estimates from  studies of larger samples ( 21@xmath455% , @xcite ) .",
    "the formation of star - forming rings is usually associated with the interplay between bar - driven inflow and bar resonances @xcite . in our sample",
    "there are three galaxies , displaying inner rings , that are indeed classified as barred ( ngc4245 , ngc4274 , ngc4314 ) .",
    "star - forming rings in general , however , do not need to be accompanied by the visible presence of a bar .",
    "as gas in galaxies is very sensitive to non - axisymmetric structures , a simple oval ( i.e. weak bar ) suffices to force the re - distribution of the gas ( i.e. , @xcite ) .",
    "ngc7742 ( see also paper ii ) could be an example of this scenario , where there is no clear evidence of a bar .",
    "this hypothesis is further supported by the presence of a central decoupled component in the inner parts of the galaxy which , as discussed in section  [ sec : results ] , is common in barred galaxies .",
    "however , given the striking resemblance of ngc7742 to hoag s object @xcite , alternative formation scenarios may include an interaction event with a neighbour galaxy @xcite . in this context ,",
    "the star - forming ring in ngc2844 may be the consequence of an interaction with the nearby galaxies ( e.g. , ngc2852 , ngc2853 , see appendix  [ sec : galaxies_notes ] ) .",
    "an even more evident case of the interacting scenario is the close pair formed by ngc5953 and ngc5954 . in this case ,",
    "the star - forming ring in ngc5953 is co - spatial with the kinematically decoupled component seen in the stellar and gas kinematics (  [ subsec : stars ] ,  [ subsec : gas ] ) , thus indicating that we may be witnessing the formation of a decoupled component as a result of an ongoing interaction .",
    "the maps presented in this paper constitute a systematic study of the stellar and ionised - gas morphology and kinematics of a representative sample of 24 sa galaxies in the nearby universe .",
    "our analysis reveals stellar kinematically decoupled components in 12 of the galaxies in our sample .",
    "many of them show additional velocity dispersion drops , which are often associated with the presence of young stars .",
    "the ionised gas is almost ubiquitous in our sample and is , in general , is accompanied by the presence of dust .",
    "the kinematics of the gas is consistent with circular rotation in a disc co - rotating with respect to the stars .",
    "we assessed the importance of triaxiality and interactions by studying the distribution of misalignments between the photometric and stellar kinematics major axes , and also between the stellar and gas kinematic major axes .",
    "we concluded that , even though dust contamination plays an important role , bars are the main source for the observed non - axisymmetry in our sample .",
    "there is also no evidence for major accretion events in our sample , except in ngc4698 , and ngc5953 .",
    "derived star formation rates appear to be in good agreement with previous work in the literature .",
    "in general , star formation is intense in many galaxies and displays varied morphologies ; the most striking cases being six galaxies showing circumnuclear star - forming rings .",
    "we related the origin of these rings to gas redistribution by bars or ovals ( e.g. , ngc4314 , ngc7742 ) , or to interaction events ( e.g. , ngc5953 ) .    the maps and analysis shown here comprise only part of the information that can be extracted from the ` sauron `  data . a more detailed analysis and interpretation of some of the issues raised in this paper",
