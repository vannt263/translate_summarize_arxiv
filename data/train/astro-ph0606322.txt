    "rotochemical heating is one of several mechanisms that can keep neutron stars ( nss ) hot beyond their standard cooling time of @xmath0 ( see @xcite [ hereafter fr05 ] for further references , and @xcite for a recent review on neutron star cooling ) .",
    "it originates in deviations from beta equilibrium produced as the star gets compressed due to its decreasing rotation rate , implying a conversion of rotational energy into thermal energy .",
    "this effect is capable of keeping old millisecond pulsars ( msps ) at surface temperatures @xmath1  k , consistent with likely thermal ultraviolet emission from psr j0437 - 4720 ( @xcite ; fr05 ) .",
    "the heating mechanism works as follows .",
    "as a ns spins down , the centrifugal force acting on each fluid element diminishes , raising the local pressure .",
    "this compression results in a change of the equilibrium concentration of each particle species .",
    "reactions that modify the chemical composition drive the system towards the new equilibrium configuration .",
    "but if the rate at which reactions do this task is slower than the change of the equilibrium concentrations due to spin - down compression , the matter remains out of chemical equilibrium .",
    "the excess energy stored in the chemical imbalance is dissipated , partly by enhanced neutrino emission and partly by heating the matter in the star .",
    "thus , the star is kept warm and can radiate for long after the standard cooling time .",
    "after its introduction @xcite , this heating mechanism was studied by several authors : @xcite applied it to quark stars , @xcite estimated the effects of superfluidity , and @xcite studied the heating due to compositional transitions in the crust due to spin - down compression .",
    "the most striking prediction associated with rotochemical heating is that , if the spin - down timescale is substantially longer than any other timescale involved ( with the likely exception of magnetic field decay ) , the star arrives at a _ quasi - steady state _",
    ", in which the temperature depends only on the current , slowly changing value of @xmath2 ( the product of the angular velocity and its time derivative ) , and not on the star s previous history @xcite .",
    "this provides a simple way to constrain the physics involved in theoretical models , once the spin parameters and observed surface temperature of a given , sufficiently old ns are known .    in spite of the previous work ,",
    "fr05 were the first to go beyond order - of - magnitude estimates and calculate the thermal evolution of nss with rotochemical heating , taking the structure of the star fully into account in the frame of general relativity , and using realistic equations of state of dense matter .",
    "they developed a general formalism to treat the evolution of the temperature and departures of chemical equilibrium , implementing it for the simplest possible core composition , namely neutrons , protons , electrons , and muons ( @xmath3 matter ) . using state - of - the - art equations of state , and",
    "modified urca reactions as the dissipative process , they obtained results consistent with the observed ultraviolet emission from the millisecond pulsar psr j0437 - 4720 @xcite .    here",
    ", we show that their formalism is not completely rigorous , in the sense of ignoring the perturbations to the electrostatic potential that must be present inside the ns in order to keep nearly exact charge neutrality among the different charged particles present inside the star .",
    "we start ( in  2 ) by discussing the physical origin , importance , and strength of the electrostatic potential expected inside a ns , as well as its relation to the ( nearly exact ) condition of local charge neutrality .",
    "then ( in  3 ) , we review the main components of the rotochemical heating formalism developed by fr05 , which are rigorously correct and not directly affected by the presence of electrostatic potential perturbations , showing that their main result , namely the existence and properties of the quasi - steady state , are unchanged . in  4 , we introduce the electrostatic potential into the equations of fr05 that relate the different chemical imbalance variables ( chemical potential imbalances and deviations from equilibrium particle abundances ) to each other .",
    "the quantitative consequences of these modifications are explored in  5 , whereas  6 contains our main conclusions .",
    "it is well - known that a neutron ( @xmath4 ) in vacuum is an unstable particle , decaying into a proton ( @xmath5 ) , an electron ( @xmath6 ) , and an electron antineutrino ( @xmath7 ) . in nss , neutrons are stabilized by the presence of enough protons and electrons to block ( through the pauli exclusion principle ) the possible final states of the decay .",
    "neutron and protons have high masses and are therefore held inside the star by its gravitational potential well , whose depth must be larger than the kinetic part of their fermi energies . however , this potential is not deep enough to hold the much lighter electrons , whose fermi energy is relativistic ( much larger than their mass ) , and which would therefore tend to escape , yielding a net positive charge on the ns .",
    "however , at ns densities , already a small charge imbalance between protons and electrons causes an electrostatic field that can hold in the electrons and at the same time partially balance the gravitational force on the protons , preventing them from sinking into the center of the star , due to their relatively small kinetic energies .",
    "thus , a non - rotating ns in hydrostatic , chemical ( beta ) , and diffusive equilibrium contains a spherically symmetric electrostatic potential @xmath8 that keeps the charged particles near local charge neutrality .",
    "the existence of such an electric potential in stars has been known to astrophysicists since the early twentieth century .",
    "a recent discussion , including early references , is found in @xcite .    more formally , and using a relativistic description of gravity , in contrast to the newtonian description in the previous paragraph , we describe the star by the spherically symmetric metric @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the condition of diffusive equilibrium for each particle species @xmath10 is that its total , redshifted chemical potential , @xmath11e^{\\phi(r)}\\ ] ] is uniform throughout the star . here , @xmath12 is the charge of each particle species , and @xmath13 is its intrinsic chemical potential @xcite , determined by the kinetic energy of the species ( or equivalently , by their number density @xmath14 ) and their local interactions with particles of the same and other species ( which are determined by all the densities ) . for a given metric and electrostatic potential ,",
    "these conditions determine the distribution of the individual particle species by fixing the spatial dependence of the intrinsic chemical potential . for a typical density inside nss , @xmath15 , the extremely relativistic electron chemical potential @xmath16 , which sets the scale for the electrostatic potential , @xmath17 , where @xmath18 .",
    "the field equation for the electrostatic potential is maxwell s equation , @xmath19 , where the components of the electromagnetic field tensor can be written in terms of the 4-vector potential components @xmath20 as @xmath21 , and @xmath22 are the components of the charge - current 4-vector . in the static system of interest here ( ignoring currents and magnetic fields inside the neutron star ) , the space components of the 4-vectors can be set to zero : @xmath23 , and the time component @xmath24 .",
    "a substantial amount of algebra yields the relativistic poisson equation for the electrostatic potential , @xmath25-e^{-2\\phi}r_{00}\\psi=4\\pi\\sum_i n_iq_i,\\ ] ] where @xmath26 are the components of the riemann curvature tensor , and the primes indicate derivatives with respect to the radial coordinate @xmath27 .",
    "the terms on the left - hand side ( the generalization of the laplacian operator of flat spacetime ) are of order @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the radius of the ns .",
    "thus , a minute excess positive charge density @xmath30 ( compared to the typical density of each charged species , @xmath31 , mentioned above ) is enough to produce the required potential .",
    "therefore , to an excellent approximation , we can assume that the electrostatic potential is exactly that required to keep local neutrality everywhere among the charged particle species , replacing equation  ( [ eq : poisson ] ) by the condition of charge neutrality @xmath32 imposed on the densities @xmath14 , and obtaining the _ non - zero _ electrostatic potential from this condition , together with equation  ( [ eq : totalchem ] ) .",
    "the formalism of fr05 can be summarized as follows ( we refer to the original paper for more details ) .",
    "the changing rotation rate @xmath33 of the star , assumed to be much slower than the `` break - up '' or `` keplerian '' rate , slightly perturbs its structure , making the total , chemical - equilibrium number @xmath34 of particles of species @xmath10 in the star change with time as @xmath35 where @xmath36 is a constant , depending on the structure of the unperturbed , non - rotating star .",
    "the actual number of particles of the same species , @xmath37 , is changed by non - equilibrium weak interactions in the stellar core as @xmath38 the integral is performed over the volume of the unperturbed , non - rotating stellar core , and the sum runs over different kinds of reactions ( labeled by @xmath39 ) , each of which creates a net number @xmath40 of particles of species @xmath10 per unit time and per unit volume .",
    "the latter quantity is a function of the local density , temperature , and , most importantly , of the local chemical imbalance , quantified by the variables @xmath41 , where @xmath42 stands for the charged leptons : electrons ( @xmath43 ) or muons ( @xmath44 ) . if the @xmath45 are non - zero , so are the net reaction rates , with their signs such that the chemical imbalances tend to be decreased .",
    "the evolution of the excess ( or deficit ) of particles of species @xmath10 , @xmath46 , is therefore determined by the competition between the changing rotation rate of the star , which tends to increase its absolute value , and the reactions , tending to decrease it : @xmath47    the evolutionary time scale of the star is assumed to be much longer than the time scales for diffusion of particles and heat across it .",
    "so , in particular , the redshifted temperature @xmath48 is considered to be uniform inside the star , except for a thin surface layer .",
    "this temperature evolves as @xmath49,\\ ] ] where @xmath50 is the total heat capacity of the star , @xmath51 is the total power released by reactions and other heating mechanisms , @xmath52 is the total neutrino luminosity , and @xmath53 is the photon luminosity , which are functions of the chemical imbalances @xmath45 and the temperature @xmath54 everywhere inside the star .    although the particles are in diffusive equilibrium , moving easily everywhere inside the star , they are generally not in chemical equilibrium ( free to convert into one another ) . therefore , non - zero , but spatially uniform , redshifted chemical imbalances are set up , @xmath55 not involving the electrostatic potential , which cancels out due to the equal and opposite charges of protons and leptons . being uniform in the star , these redshifted chemical imbalances are the ideal variables to quantify the departure from chemical equilibrium and follow its time evolution .",
    "the reaction rates on the right - hand side of equations  ( [ eq : dot_ni ] ) and ( [ eq : dot_dni ] ) can be written in terms of @xmath56 and @xmath57 instead of the corresponding un - redshifted , local , position - dependent variables .    in order to close the system of dynamical equations ,",
    "it is necessary to write the chemical imbalances , @xmath56 , in terms of the excess numbers of particles , @xmath58 , which is where the inaccuracy of the previous treatment ( fr05 ) is located , as we shall discuss below .",
    "however , at this point , we may note that , if we are only interested in the quasi - steady state reached by nss with slow spin - down evolution , we only need to set the right - hand sides of equations  ( [ eq : dot_dni ] ) and ( [ eq : dot_t ] ) equal to zero , immediately yielding a non - degenerate set of algebraic equations for @xmath56 and @xmath57 , which is equivalent to that of fr05 and therefore has identically the same solutions .",
    "when the chemical equilibrium is slightly perturbed , the total , redshifted chemical potential of equation  ( [ eq : totalchem ] ) is displaced from its equilibrium value by the small amount @xmath59e^{\\phi},\\ ] ] where the prefix @xmath60 refers to the respective variable being slightly perturbed with respect to the chemical equilibrium state , maintaining diffusive equilibrium ( so @xmath61 remains uniform ) .",
    "we note that equation ( 9 ) of fr05 considered only the first term .",
    "if some neutrons are converted into proton - electron pairs ( plus escaping antineutrinos ) , its effect on the energy density and pressure , and therefore on the structure of the star and the spacetime metric , is not large , as verified explicitly ( in the newtonian approximation ) in appendix a. we therefore invoke the relativistic cowling approximation ( e.  g. , @xcite ) , setting @xmath62 .",
    "however , the absolute value of the electrostatic potential must increase , in order to hold more protons and electrons together than before .",
    "this effect is considered explicitly in what follows .",
    "the intrinsic chemical potential perturbations are related to local density changes , @xmath63 where , from equation  ( [ eq : dtotalchem ] ) , @xmath64 . imposing conservation of local charge neutrality , @xmath65 , yields @xmath66 thus , after some algebra , the perturbation to the total number of particles of one species in the star can be written as in equation ( 11 ) of fr05 : @xmath67 but with the coefficients redefined as @xmath68.\\ ] ] ( the second term inside the square brackets is missing in eq .",
    "[ 12 ] of fr05 . )",
    "the thermodynamic identity @xmath69 can be used to show that @xmath70 .",
    "more important , however , is to note that the @xmath71-matrix @xmath72 is singular , since charge conservation is `` built in , '' in the sense that , for any combination of four values for the variables @xmath73 , it is guaranteed that @xmath74 , i.  e. , three of the rows of @xmath72 are not linearly independent : @xmath75 .",
    "one manifestation of this singularity is the existence of `` trivial '' perturbations with @xmath76 , for which @xmath77 and therefore the particle distributions inside the star are not changed .",
    "these perturbations can be interpreted as redistributions of charges outside the star , or just as redefinitions of the zero point of the potentials .    in order to obtain an invertible problem ,",
    "we reduce our four degrees of freedom to three , by defining the new variables @xmath78 and @xmath79 the latter for both @xmath80 , and eliminating the row and column corresponding to the protons from the matrix @xmath72 , in this way converting it into a symmetric and invertible @xmath81-matrix @xmath82 , with @xmath83 for @xmath84 .",
    "( the proton density and total number can be recovered from those of electrons and muons through the condition of charge neutrality . )",
    "the components of the inverse matrix , @xmath85 , relate the chemical imbalance variables to the particle number perturbations : @xmath86    finally , this can be further reduced by considering that the reactions also conserve baryon number , i.  e. , @xmath87 , which allows to also eliminate @xmath88 , writing @xmath89 we can make contact with the notation of fr05 by writing @xmath90 with the coefficients rewritten as @xmath91 @xmath92 @xmath93 instead of equations ( 54 ) through ( 56 ) of fr05 .",
    "these re - definitions were chosen so that their equations ( 52 ) and ( 53 ) for the time evolution of the chemical imbalance variables @xmath94 remain formally correct .",
    "the coefficients @xmath95 , which determine the rate by which chemical imbalances are built up by the changing rotation rate , also remain correctly expressed by equations ( 57 ) and ( 58 ) , although more easily written as @xmath96",
    "formally , the only changes that have to be introduced to the equations of fr05 are to replace their equations ( 9 ) , ( 12 ) , ( 13 ) , ( 54 ) , ( 55 ) , and ( 56 ) by the corresponding equations in the previous sections . in their dynamical system for the time evolution of the variables @xmath57 and @xmath94 , the only difference lies in the values of the coefficients @xmath97 , @xmath98 , and @xmath99 , now defined by our equations ( [ eq : znp ] ) , ( [ eq : znpe ] ) , and ( [ eq : znpm ] ) , instead of their equations ( 54 ) , ( 55 ) , and ( 56 ) , and in the coefficients @xmath95 , which depend on the former ( e.  g. , our eq .",
    "[ [ eq : wnpl ] ] ) .",
    "we have argued in  3 that the quasi - steady state eventually reached by old nss is unaffected by these changes .",
    "however , the rate at which this state is approached ( directly depending on the coefficients @xmath95 ; see , e.  g. , fr05 , eqs .",
    "[ 76 ] and [ 81 ] ) could be affected , as well as the less intuitive time evolution of younger nss with stronger magnetic fields ( e.  g. , @xcite ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : z ] shows a comparison of the coefficients @xmath97 , @xmath98 , and @xmath99 , as functions of stellar mass , for one particular equation of state ( a18+@xmath100+uix * , @xcite ) , for the formalism of fr05 ( dashed lines ) and the more rigorous one presented here ( solid lines ) .",
    "it can be seen that @xmath97 hardly changes , whereas @xmath98 and @xmath99 show changes whose fractional amplitude increases with mass , up to a @xmath101 level at the largest masses .",
    "calculations with other equations of state yielded very similar results .    in figure",
    "[ fig : evolution ] , we compare the time evolution of the chemical imbalance variables , @xmath102 and @xmath103 , as well as the redshifted internal temperature , @xmath57 , as obtained in both formalisms for two different neutron star masses . for the lower mass , particles inside the star undergo only ( slow ) modified urca reactions , whereas at the higher mass electrons can undergo ( fast ) direct urca processes , whereas muons are still restricted to modified urca .",
    "this accounts for the relatively simple evolutionary curves on the left , as compared to the more complex one on the right .",
    "( see fr05 for a more detailed discussion . )",
    "it can be seen that , consistent with our previous discussion , there is no evidence for differences between the two formalisms in the asymptotic , quasi - steady regime , whereas some differences are seen at the epochs of strong time evolution , especially in the higher mass star .",
    "we have shown that the electrostatic potential inside a ns plays an important role in determining the spatial distribution of charged particles and their nearly exact local charge neutrality everywhere in the star .",
    "we take it into account explicitly in an extension of the formalism for rotochemical heating of fr05 , in which the relations between the two sets of variables quantifying chemical imbalances ( chemical potential differences and departures from equilibrium abundances ) are affected , without changing the rest of the formalism . the quasi - steady state reached by old nss",
    "is strictly unaffected by these corrections , and the time - dependent evolution at earlier times shows quantitatively negligible changes .",
    "the authors are very grateful to michael gusakov for pointing out the problem that we address in the present paper .",
    "we also thank olivier espinosa for useful discussions , and juan vliz for assistance with the preparation of figures .",
    "this work received financial support from fondecyt regular grants 1020840 and 1060644 , from the fondap center for astrophysics , from the visiting professors program of pontificia universidad catlica de chile , from the russian leading scientific school grant 9879.2006.2 , and from the russian fund for basic research grant 04 - 02 - 17590 .",
    "here we verify whether the gravitational potential ( or metric ) perturbation in equation ( [ eq : totalchem ] ) can indeed be neglected .",
    "we consider a neutron star model of @xmath104 , calculated in full general relativity with the first pal equation of state @xcite . for simplicity using perturbation theory in a newtonian framework",
    ", we calculate the gravitational potential perturbation @xmath105 corresponding to an arbitrarily chosen deviation from chemical equilibrium , taken as an excess electron and proton density of 1% everywhere ( muons are not present in this model ) , with a corresponding decrease in the neutron density , so as to conserve baryon number .",
    "figure  [ fig : gravpot ] shows @xmath105 as a function of the radial coordinate . for comparison , @xmath106 ,",
    "so the intrinsic chemical potential perturbation term in equation ( [ eq : totalchem ] ) is about 50 times larger than that corresponding to the gravitational potential ."
