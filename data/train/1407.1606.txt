    "a polymer is a macromolecule that consists of a large number of monomer subunits  @xcite .",

    "considerable effort was expended to describe these phenomena on the microscopic level using theory and simulations @xcite . under tensile strains cavities",
    "may nucleate in a hitherto homogeneous polymeric glass .",
    "it was argued that the formation of cavities takes place in regions of local low elastic modulus  @xcite .",
    "polymeric glasses subjected to large strains exhibit strain hardening ; this may suppress strain localization and consequent crazing , necking , shear banding etc .",
    "strain hardening is presumably caused by ordering the polymer beyond a certain strain threshold .",
    "the microscopic origin of strain hardening was studied using molecular dynamic simulations in ref .",
    "@xcite , finding that the origin of this phenomenon is related to plastic rearrangements of the monomers .",
    "this also leads to short - range ordering . in spite of the above mentioned efforts a first - principles theory of these interesting phenomena is still incomplete .",
    "in particular in this paper we propose a microscopic theory that relates macroscopic observables with the conformational deformation of the oligomers under pure shear .    in recent years",
    "there has been great progress in understanding the mechanical properties of amorphous solids from first principles  @xcite .",
    "this progress was based on identifying elementary plastic events as the loss of mechanical stability when a hessian eigenvalue hits zero  @xcite .",
    "this event is connected to a saddle node bifurcation in the generalized energy landscape .",
    "it was demonstrated also that these elementary events can aggregate and concatenate to yield shear localization and eventually shear bands  @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to extend this analytic approach to plasticity from simple lennard - jones glasses ( and recently some glasses with magnetic properties ) @xcite to the realm of short oligomeric ( or wax ) glasses .",
    "these are amorphous solids whose constituents are short chains of the order of 10 - 30 monomers , where the full impact of polymeric entanglement is still not crucial  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless the existence of fairly long chains of connected monomers introduces a hierarchy of new length scales and energy scales related to valence bonds , valence angles and inter - oligomer interactions .",
    "in particular the persistence length @xmath0 of the oligomer turns out to be crucial .",
    "thus a variety of new phenomena and questions arise , calling for a careful numerical simulation and analytic assessment . among the issues arising",
    "we will provide a microscopic theory for the shear modulus of these materials , for the failure mechanism through plasticity ( both local and system spanning ) and shed light on the geometric characteristic of the oligomers under mechanical yield .",

    "thus the total number of particles in our system is @xmath3 .",
    "the interaction between monomers belonging to the same or to different oligomers is different .",
    "inter - oligomer interaction are simply given by a truncated and smoothed lennard - jones potential @xmath4 , see below in eq .",
    "( [ ljpotential ] ) . within a given oligomer",
    "the interactions have three contributors .",
    "first , all monomers within the lennard - jones cutoff range @xmath5 exert a force on each other which is derived from the potential @xmath4 .",

    "after each plastic drop the stress rises again linearly with the applied strain ( but not necessarily with the same slope ) until the next plastic drop takes place . generally speaking both the stress vs. strain and the energy vs. strain curves reach eventually a kind of steady state in which the average stress and energy do no longer change even though they still experience elastic increases and plastic drops .    at first , when the external strain is still small , the energy drops associated with the plastic events are small , and do not increase with the system size .",
    "these plastic energy drops are associated with localized events as is explained in the next section . on the other hand , when the external strain is increased , at a threshold value of the external strain ( also known as the yield strain @xmath45 ) much bigger energy drops become possible .",

    "nevertheless the reader should note that a continuum description of the stress vs strain curves in our open system is still under debate , even in the case of simpler examples like binary lennard - jones glasses . here the quantitative theory of energy input by mechanical strain , including the share taken by stress vs. oligomeric conformation changes on the one hand , and energy dissipated to the heat bath on the other hand is still unavailable .",

    "in addition to the energy and the stress in the system , the oligomeric glass presents also interesting responses to external strains in the resulting geometry of the chains .",
    "of course , the configuration of the oligomers in the glass depends on the stiffness of the chains .",

    "once the persistence length is of the order of the initial value of @xmath61 we can assume that the oligomers are entirely stretched . then the effect of the shear strain is opposite , in reducing the end - to - end distance .",
    "this stems simply from the fact that any inclined stretched polymer will bend under the action of shear , since its two ends move at different speeds .",

    "oligomeric glasses , like simple binary glasses and the much more complex metallic glasses , exhibit , in addition to localized plastic events also a second class of system spanning , shear localizing events .",
    "these events are precursors to shear banding , and they need a finite amount of stress or strain to accumulate before they become possible . in previous analysis it was shown that shear localizing events occur when the strain exceeds a value @xmath130 which depends on the poisson ratio of the material but is usually around 5 - 7%  @xcite .",
    "it appears that the present oligomeric glasses are not much different in this respect .",
    "we begin to see shear localizing instabilities when @xmath63 is of the order of 10% or less .",
    "the shear localization event is rather dramatic ; even though we shear homogeneously with our affine transformation the system chooses to respond by localizing all the shear over a small band of the size of the core of the eshelby solution , and see refs .",
    "@xcite for details .",
    "it was shown in refs .",
    "@xcite that this solution minimizes the energy compared to a random array of elementary plastic events .",
    "the nature of the shear localizing events is similar to what had been seen previously : an eigenvalue of the hessian matrix dips to zero , but now instead of a single quadrupolar structure a whole string of those , concatenated along a line in 2-dimensions  @xcite or on a plane in 3-dimensions  @xcite , appear simultaneously .",
    "they have a global connection now , with the outgoing direction of one quadrupolar structure connecting immediately to the incoming direction of the next quadrupole , thus arranging the displacement field to go in two different direction above and below the line ( or plane ) . for pure shear the line ( or plane )",

    "both images show how the shear is now concentrated over a narrow band , with the displacement field pointing to the  right \" above the band and to the  left \" below the band . in a stress control rather than a strain controlled experiment such an event would lead to macroscopic failure .    in the next section we will present a theoretical formalism to compute the shear modulus for the oligomeric glasses",
    "the shear modulus that is a measure of linear response of the material under the applied strain characterizes the mechanical behaviour of the system .",
    "here we provide the theory that relates the shear modulus to the microscopic variables like hessian , non - affine displacements , etc .",
    "we recall that for homogeneous shear strain the shear modulus is defined as the second derivatives of the potential energy with respect to the applied strain @xmath63 , i.e. , @xmath133 in this expression the second derivative contains two contributions : one coming from the affine part and another from the non - affine motion of the monomers .",

    "[ fig15 ] .    .",
    "the relatively large error bars stem from the relative smallness of the system , in which different realizations give a spread of values of the shear modulus .",

    "in this paper we discussed the mechanics of oligomeric glasses , also known as waxes , with a special attention to the stress and energy vs strain , the characteristics of the oligomeric chains and their changes under strain , the shear modulus , and the plastic failure modes .",
    "we proposed a microscopic outlook which extends the available theory for simple binary glasses to this much more complex oligomeric example .",
    "this resulted in an exact theory for the shear modulus , and a full understanding of the plastic failure , both in the localized and the extended modes .",
    "there are a few open problems that call for further theoretical and numerical considerations .",
    "the most relevant are :    1 .",
    "a continuum theory of the stress vs strain and energy vs strain is lacking . to be realistic , this is a hard task , and even for the simpler case of binary glasses such a theory is still under hard debate @xcite .",
