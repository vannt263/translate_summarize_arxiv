    "symmetricom test set has become a useful instrument for phase noise and frequency stability measurements that allows one to compare a signal from a device under test ( dut ) against a reference signal and as a result measure the relative phase noise and frequency stability between the two signals  @xcite .",
    "the manufacturer supplies a few models but currently the maximum input bandwidth is 400 mhz ( model 5125a ) while the highest performance unit ( model 5120 - 01 ) , with the lowest phase noise measurement noise floor , only has a measurement bandwidth of 30 mhz .",
    "so how would one measure the additive or residual phase noise of a device under test which has an operating frequency much higher than 30 mhz or even 400 mhz ?",
    "one method to achieve this is to take a beat note between two oscillators , and , by engineering a relatively low noise reference through frequency division of a signal derived from one of the oscillators , one can make a measurement on oscillators operating at x - band frequencies  @xcite . if the oscillators have similar phase noise 3 db can be subtracted for their individual performance .",
    "however this method is limited to the case where the beat note between the signals from two oscillators being compared falls within the measurement bandwidth of the test set being used .",
    "this paper outlines a method to use the symmetricom test set outside its normal area of application ( oscillator noise measurements ) .",
    "we show that it can be used for measuring phase fluctuations in passive and active microwave components ( circulators , amplifiers , voltage controlled phase shifters etc ) and at frequencies well outside its normal operational bandwidth .",
    "this method is quite different to that normally used for phase noise measurements where a homodyne technique uses baseband measurements and calibration of the mixer is required to calculate the phase noise from voltage noise measurements .",
    "it allows one to simply measure the phase noise and/or frequency stability of practically any device at any frequency , provided the frequency is sufficiently stable .",
    "the dut could be an active device where only phase noise is of interest or alternatively two oscillators where both phase noise and frequency stability are measured .",
    "the essential elements of the measurement technique are shown in fig . 1 .",
    "here the dut is a microwave amplifier operating at frequency @xmath0 .",
    "the microwave signal from a stable source is divided into two arms .",
    "one arm passes through the dut and picks up the intrinsic phase fluctuations due to the amplifier .",
    "an attenuator ( att1 ) is adjusted to give the desired input power and a second attenuator ( att2 ) is used to provide the suitable lo drive level for the first mixing stage . at this point",
    "an auxiliary source is used to provide a signal at a frequency @xmath1 that is within the range of the test set being used .",
    "the important feature of this technique is to impose the dut phase noise onto the low frequency @xmath1 auxiliary signal , which is done via the use of two mixing stages .",
    "if necessary , attenuators ( att3 and att4 ) are used to adjust the lo drive level and the rf power level to the second mixing stage .",
    "alternatively an isolator could be used instead of attenuator att4 .",
    "a band pass filter ( bpf ) is used to reject one of the sidebands , either @xmath2 or @xmath3 , at the output of the first mixing stage .",
    "( an image rejection or single side band mixer could also be used . )",
    "the second mixing stage recovers the frequency ( @xmath1 ) of the auxiliary signal , after low pass filtering ( lpf ) but it carries all the phase fluctuations of the device under test . the signal is then amplified and input to the symmetricom test set .",
    "the reference to the test set is taken directly from the auxiliary oscillator .",
    "this combination of two mixing stages with the test set is integral to this technique and allows one to essentially use the test set to measure the phase noise of any device operating at any frequency within the range of the components used .",
    "considering the configuration of fig .",
    "1(a ) , we model the input signal to the second mixing stage , after filtering , as proportional to , @xmath4,\\ ] ] where the upper sideband has been rejected , and where @xmath5 is the phase spectrum of the noise added by the dut to the @xmath0 signal before being mixed with the @xmath1 auxiliary signal .",
    "the parameter @xmath6 represents the initial phase of the signal at lo1 .",
    "after the second mixing stage the resulting signal frequency dependence can be modeled by the product of the latter with the original @xmath0 microwave pump signal as , @xmath7 cos[2 \\pi f_0 t + \\varphi_{lo2 } ] = \\nonumber \\\\ & \\frac{1}{2 } cos [ 2 \\pi f_a t + \\delta \\varphi(t)+ \\phi ] , \\label{eqn1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is a phase constant and the high frequency @xmath9 mixing product has been rejected by the low pass filter .",
    "the @xmath9 signal is well suppressed by the mixer itself if @xmath0 is in the microwave range . here",
    "@xmath10 represents the initial phase of the signal at lo2 .",
    "this and the initial phase at lo1 are a fixed phase with respect to the initial phase of the auxiliary signal at the if port of the first mixing stage .",
    "therefore the last term in eq .",
    "( [ eqn1 ] ) is a constant phase factor and as a result the @xmath1 signal input to the test set contains the phase noise of the dut .",
    "the correlated phase fluctuations of the pump microwave signal ( @xmath0 ) are rejected at the level of the second mixer .",
    "phase fluctuations of the auxiliary oscillator are rejected by the test set because it measures fluctuations of the phase difference between two input signals ( it is essentially a `` digital '' phase bridge ) .",
    "the measurement system white noise floor is then determined primarily by the final low frequency rf amplifier used to provide sufficient signal power to the input of the test set .",
    "the two mixers down converting the microwave signal , that passes through the dut , to the frequency of the auxiliary signal , and the rejection of one of the sidebands , are the main elements in this technique .",
    "all variations on this design contain this important aspect .",
    "ideas similar to this have been developed before under the name of `` transposed gain '' where a signal is down converted from a much higher microwave frequency to a low frequency where the amplifier , used as the important gain stage , has much lower intrinsic noise and after which the signal is up converted again to the higher microwave frequency  @xcite .",
    "this technique is quite different as it does not actually use a transpose gain but transfers the noise of the dut to a much lower frequency signal that is accessible to the phase noise test set used to measure the device s phase noise and/or frequency stability .",
    "it is worth noting that the dut could have , alternately , been located on the other branch of the power splitter before the mixer input lo2 but we would get the same result as eq .",
    "( [ eqn1 ] ) .",
    "caution needs to be taken to ensure that the lo power on the mixers is maintained at their optimum drive level and at the same level for all measurements .",
    "one might be measuring the dut as a function of input power , as in fig .",
    "1 , which will change the power at lo1 .",
    "the mixer s contribution to the measurement system noise floor depends on its input power .",
    "it was observed that when the mixer power was allowed to drop well below optimum drive levels the measurement system noise floor was elevated and limited the measurement .",
    "however as indicated in fig .",
    "1(b ) the band - pass filter could also be replaced with a ( mechanical ) phase shifter but it will be shown that this does not result in the correct measurement of the phase noise of the dut .",
    "we model this configuration with a signal at the first mixing stage as proportional to , @xmath11,\\ ] ] where both sidebands are present , the term @xmath5 represents the flicker phase fluctuations of the dut .",
    "( the treatment of the white phase noise of the dut is given below ) .",
    "the term @xmath12 represents the added phase from the variable ( mechanical ) phase shifter .",
    "when this is mixed at the second mixing stage the resulting signal frequency dependence can be modeled by the product of the latter with the original @xmath0 microwave pump signal as , @xmath13 \\times \\nonumber \\\\ & cos[2 \\pi f_0 t + \\varphi_{lo2 } ] = \\nonumber   \\\\ % & \\frac{1}{2}cos[2 \\pi ( -f_a ) t + \\delta \\varphi(t)+\\varphi_{lo1}+\\varphi_p -\\varphi_{lo2 } ] + \\nonumber\\\\ % & \\frac{1}{2}cos[2 \\pi ( f_a ) t + \\delta \\varphi(t)+\\varphi_{lo1}+\\varphi_p   -\\varphi_{lo2}]= \\nonumber\\\\ % & \\frac{1}{2}cos[2 \\pi ( f_a ) t - \\delta \\varphi(t)-\\varphi_{lo1}-\\varphi_p + \\varphi_{lo2 } ] + \\nonumber\\\\ % & \\frac{1}{2}cos[2 \\pi ( f_a ) t + \\delta \\varphi(t)+\\varphi_{lo1}+\\varphi_p -\\varphi_{lo2}]=\\nonumber\\\\ & cos[2 \\pi f_a t ] cos[\\delta \\varphi(t)- \\phi+\\varphi_p ] , \\label{eqn2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the high frequency @xmath9 mixing product has been low pass filtered out and the phase noise sidebands are added to the phase constants .",
    "in contrast to the previous case , shown by eq .",
    "( 1 ) , the phase noise of the dut is not imposed on the output signal at frequency @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , the measurement system without the band - pass filter ( fig .",
    "1(b ) ) is incapable of measuring _",
    "phase fluctuations of the dut .      in this section",
    "we show how the measurement system in fig .",
    "1(b ) treats white phase noise of the dut . in this case the output signal voltage from the dut with effective temperature @xmath14 as given by , @xmath15 + \\nu(t),\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the amplitude of the signal input to the dut , @xmath17 is the dut transmission coefficient and @xmath18 is the white noise from the dut with power spectral density , @xmath19 , 1\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is boltzmann s constant .",
    "therefore the power spectral density of phase fluctuations due to this thermal noise source is , @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the power of the dut input signal .",
    "after the reference phase shifter is adjusted to maximize the output signal from the second mixer , the input signal to the symmetricom test set , can be modeled by , @xmath23 + \\xi(t ) , \\label{eqn3}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 is the mixer s conversion coefficient . the first term in eq .",
    "( [ eqn3 ] ) is the same as eq .",
    "( [ eqn2 ] ) but with the phase shifter tuned to maximize the @xmath1 signal , and the second term is the broadband white phase noise term , which unlike the first term is not dependent on the chosen reference phase shift .",
    "the power spectral density of @xmath25 can be expressed as , @xmath26 .",
    "1 \\label{eqn3 - 2}\\ ] ] the effective power spectral density of phase fluctuations of the output signal due to thermal noise is then , @xmath27 this expression results from combining eqs ( [ eqn3 ] ) and ( [ eqn3 - 2 ] ) .",
    "it is power dependent and models what is observed .",
    "equations ( 8) and ( 5 ) coincide .",
    "this proves that the measurement system in fig .",
    "1(b ) , while insensitive to flicker phase noise of the dut , can correctly measure its white phase noise .",
    "hence the technique using the phase shifter , though it _ does not _ allow us to measure the dut narrow band phase noise on the auxiliary signal , it _ does correctly _ measure its broadband white noise .",
    "the same key elements of the configuration of fig .",
    "1(a ) , using the band - pass filter , can be used to measure the phase noise and frequency stability of a pair of oscillators at different frequencies , where we assign @xmath28 and @xmath29 to the frequencies of the two oscillators .",
    "the same aspects apply to this configuration as discussed above , so we ll only consider the situation where a band - pass filter is used .",
    "if the phase shifter is used instead of the band - pass filter it can be shown , like in eq .",
    "( 2 ) , that the relative phase fluctuations of the oscillators are not recovered on the auxiliary signal .",
    "2 describes the basic features for the measurement method for two oscillators where a band - pass filter is used after the first mixing stage .",
    "the main difference with fig .",
    "1 is that two devices are needed .",
    "one may be used as a dut and the other as a reference to obtain the measured signal frequency where , @xmath30 with the @xmath31 depending on the choice of band - pass filter .",
    "this ensures a signal at a frequency measureable by the test set containing the phase fluctuations of the two oscillators .",
    "here we have assumed a 400 mhz bandwidth test set is being used .",
    "therefore eq .",
    "( [ eqn400 ] ) means the frequency difference between the oscillators must be less than twice the bandwidth of the test set otherwise additional mixing stages are needed .    in the case where a reference oscillator has much lower phase noise than the dut oscillator",
    "the final result is that of the dut but if they are nominally identical oscillators then we get the relative phase fluctuations of the two devices .",
    "this means 3 db must be subtracted for the phase noise of a single oscillator .    from one of the oscillators an intermediate frequency",
    "is generated with an auxiliary oscillator in the first mixing stage , which is filtered to reject one of the sidebands with the band - pass filter , and then mixed in the second stage with the signal from the other oscillator , low pass filtered , amplified and measured on the symmetricom test set .",
    "the phase noise is read directly from the test set , but to find the allan deviation of the signal at frequency @xmath28 or @xmath29 one must scale by the ratio @xmath32 where @xmath0 is chosen as equal to either @xmath28 or @xmath29 .",
    "in the case of fig .",
    "2 we can model the results of the first mixing stage as proportional to , @xmath33,\\ ] ] where upper @xmath1 sideband has been filtered out by the band - pass filter . the phase noise of the oscillator is represented by @xmath34 .",
    "when this is mixed at the second mixing stage with the output of the second oscillator with its own phase noise @xmath35 at the frequency @xmath29 , and modeled as proportional to , @xmath36,\\ ] ] the resulting signal frequency dependence can be modeled by the product of the latter with the former as , @xmath37 \\times \\nonumber \\\\ & cos[2 \\pi f_{02 } t + \\delta \\varphi_2 ( t ) + \\varphi_{lo2 } ] = \\nonumber \\\\ & \\frac{1}{2}cos[2 \\pi ( f_{01}-f_{02}+f_a ) t + \\delta \\varphi_1(t)+\\delta \\varphi_2 ( t ) + \\phi ] , \\label{eqn4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is a phase constant and the high frequency mixing product of order @xmath38 has been filtered out .",
    "the power of phase fluctuations of the resulting signal at frequency @xmath39 is equal to the combined power of phase fluctuations of the individual microwave oscillators .",
    "of course the low pass filter must now pass the signal with frequency @xmath39 , and this frequency must be within the bandwidth of the measurement test set .",
    "this then necessarily affects the frequency at which the phase noise is measured and the scaling ratio to calculate the allan deviation becomes @xmath40 . if the oscillators are nominally identical an additional @xmath41 factor must be applied to get the stability of a single oscillator .",

    "the microwave mixers are watkins johnson model number m14a .",

    ", they are consistent with those expected for the amplifier and indicate a flicker law for fourier frequencies @xmath42 hz .",
    "the thermal noise floor is dependent on input power to the amplifier as expected .",
    "a carrier frequency of @xmath43 ghz and an auxiliary frequency @xmath44 mhz were used in these measurements .",
    "the measurement system noise floor was measured by removing the dut and it was found that it limits the measurements for fourier frequencies @xmath45 hz .",
    "the phase noise of the final rf amplifier was determined to be the principle limitation of the measurement system especially at fourier frequencies @xmath46 hz . by using either a minicircuits era-5 + or a zfl-500ln+ amplifier the measurement system white noise floor",
    "was limited to about -163 dbc / hz and about -158 dbc / hz ( on the 20 mhz carrier ) respectively .",
    "the former is very close to white noise floor of the symmetricom 5125a test set itself .",
    "the additive phase noise of the rf amplifiers used here were separately measured by splitting the 20 mhz signal of the auxiliary oscillator and passing one signal through the amplifier to the input channel of the test set and the other directly to the reference channel . in both cases , the same input power to the amplifier was used as in the measurement system , and the results matched the thermal noise floor of the measurement system when using these rf amplifiers .    finally , when using the era-5 + rf amplifier , a pair of minicircuits zx05 - 153 + mixers were substituted for the watkins johnson m14a mixers and this raised the measurement system white noise floor 3 db to about -160 dbc / hz , indicating that a small contribution also may come from the choice of mixers used .",
    "using the method of fig .",
    "1(b ) and a very low phase noise aml x - band microwave amplifier we measured essentially the phase noise floor of the measurements system as a function of input power to the x - band amplifier . in this configuration where a mechanical phase shifter ( an arra 9428b in this case ) is used instead of",
    "the band - pass filter one does not get the phase noise of the dut ( nor that for the oscillator(s ) if a phase shifter is used in the configuration of fig .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "however the measurements of fig .",
    "4 indicate that as one decreases the input power to the x - band amplifier ( the dut ) one observes rising thermal noise . at input power levels @xmath47 dbm ( curve 1 ) the measured noise is at the measurement system noise floor . at input power levels",
    "less than this we observe an increase in white noise approximately proportional to the change in input power .    the measurement system noise floors for both configurations shown in fig .",
    "1 were determined by removing the dut , and ensuring the power to the mixers and the rf amplifier were the same as used when making the dut phase noise measurements .",
    "looking at figs 3 and 4 there is a clear difference in the frequency dependence and level of the measurement system phase noise floor .",
    "the difference is that in the method of fig 1.(a ) , with the band - pass filter , the mixer noise is present for @xmath48 hz ( curve 4 in fig .",
    "3 ) but in the method of fig 1.(b ) , without the band - pass filter , the mixer noise is not present ( curve 4 in fig .",
    "4 ) and we only measure the test set noise floor for @xmath49 hz . at higher offset frequencies it is the rf amplifier that sets the thermal noise floor .    as shown in eq .",
    "( [ eqn2 ] ) , the dut phase noise is not added to the auxiliary signal , when the phase shifter was substituted for the band - pass filter , so also the mixers in the circuit are devices under test and their phase noise is not added but shows up as amplitude noise on the signal input to the test set . by contrast , from eq .",
    "( [ eqn1 ] ) , when the band - pass filter is used , the phase noise of the mixers is , in addition to the phase noise of the dut , added to the signal input to the test set .",
    "therefore with the dut removed we measure a system noise floor that includes the phase noise of the two mixers and the rf amplifier ( at the higher offset frequencies ) .        using the measurement method of fig .",
    "2 we measured the phase noise of an agilent e8257c synthesizer generating a 1 ghz signal compared to a 1 ghz signal synthesized from an ultra - low phase noise cryogenic sapphire oscillator .",
    "the phase noise spectra are shown in fig . 5 , and the frequency stability in fig .",
    "curve 1 represents the phase noise of the synthesizer without external reference , and curve 2 when it was referenced by a 10 mz signal from the frequency doubled output of an oscilloquartz 8607 quartz oscillator .",
    "the measurement system used two minicircuits zx05 - 10l - s+ mixers , a zvbp-909-s+ band - pass filter , a slp-100 + low pass filter and a zfl-500ln+ amplifier .",
    "its measurement system phase noise floor is shown in curve 3 in fig .",
    "this was determined by using the same low phase noise oscillator on both input ports ( for oscillators 1 and 2 in fig .",
    "the auxiliary oscillator frequency used in these measurements was @xmath50 mhz , derived from the ultra - low phase noise cryogenic sapphire oscillator , with a phase noise of -130 dbc / hz at 1 hz offset @xcite . in this case",
    "it was necessary to scale resulting stability generated by the test set by @xmath51 mhz@xmath52 ghz @xmath53 where @xmath54 ghz .",
    "we also compared the same oscillators where we raised the output signal frequency of the agilent e8257c synthesizer to @xmath55 ghz .",
    "the auxiliary oscillator was still at @xmath50 mhz , which was mixed with the signal at @xmath56 ghz from the ultra - low phase noise cryogenic sapphire oscillator , then we filtered out the upper sideband with the band - pass filter leaving the lower sideband at 900 mhz to be mixed with the 1.2 ghz signal .",
    "after low - pass filtering ( using a minicircuits slp-400 filter ) and amplification this resulted in a 300 mhz signal that was measured by the test set .",
    "curve 4 in fig .",
    "5 is the result where a factor of @xmath57 has been subtracted to compare the results all at 1 ghz .",
    "it is essentially identical with curve 2 as expected . and",
    "in fig 6 we show the allan deviation of the 1.2 ghz synthesizer signal where the correct scaling has been applied to the output of the test set . in this case @xmath58",
    "mhz@xmath59 ghz @xmath60 .",
    "only allan deviation data with a noise equivalent bandwidth ( neq ) of 0.5 hz is shown .",
    "the cryogenic sapphire oscillator s phase noise and frequency stability @xcite are orders of magnitude lower than that of the agilent e8257c synthesizer . at 1 ghz",
    "its phase noise is approximately equal to the measurement system noise floor ( curve 3 or fig .",
    "5 ) , hence it does not contribute to these results .",
    "figs 5 and 6 therefore show only the performance of the e8257c synthesizer .    it should be noted that when the frequency difference of the two oscillators falls within the bandwidth of the test set the additive phase noise can be measured by taking the beat note of the two signals and comparing it to a previously characterized low noise reference . to confirm the validity of our transposed gain technique we used this direct comparison method to repeat the measurements in figures 5 and 6 and found no discrepancy in the results .",
    "a technique has been developed that allows one to measure the phase noise of active components operating at frequencies well outside the bandwidth of the phase noise measurement test set being used .",
    "digital measurements of phase fluctuations offer several advantages over the usual homodyne technique . here",
    "is no need for the calibration of the mixer nor is there any requirement to phase lock two oscillators to maintain zero voltage at the output of the mixer during the measurement process .",
    "the latter feature permitted , for the first time , the phase noise measurement of ultra - stable cryogenic sapphire oscillators .",
    "this method is only limited by the operational bandwidth of the components used , and the noise floor imposed on the measurements by the two mixing stages and the final rf amplifier used to provide sufficient signal power to the test set . using the band - pass filter and x - band mixers a measurement system noise floor at low offset frequencies of @xmath61 was obtained , while with 1 ghz mixers @xmath62 was achieved . using a",
    "minicircuits era-5 + rf amplifier at the input to the test set a measurement system white noise floor of -163 dbc / hz was obtained .",
    "hence one may achieve a measurement white noise floor at the limits of the test set itself , near -165 dbc / hz for the 5125a model and -175 dbc / hz for 5120a-01 model with ultra - low - noise option . provided",
    "the final rf amplifier is sufficiently low noise one can reach this white noise floor and potentially measure the phase noise of extremely low noise components .",
