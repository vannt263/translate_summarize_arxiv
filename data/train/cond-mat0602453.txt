    "to establish reliable analytical theories of spin glasses has been one of the most challenging problems in statistical physics for years .",
    "the problem was solved for the mean - field model @xcite .",
    "much less is known analytically for finite - dimensional spin glasses , for which approximate methods including numerical simulations and phenomenological theories @xcite have been the main tools of investigation in addition to a limited set of rigorous results and exact solutions @xcite .",
    "our main interest in the present contribution does not lie directly in the issue of the properties of the spin glass phase .",
    "we instead will concentrate ourselves on the precise ( and possibly exact ) determination of the structure of phase diagram of finite - dimensional spin glasses .",
    "this problem is of practical importance for numerical studies since exact values of transition points greatly facilitate reliable estimates of critical exponents in finite - size scaling .",
    "more precisely , recent developments @xcite to derive a conjecture on the exact location of the multicritical point in the phase diagram will be analyzed from a different view point .",
    "the conjecture was derived using the replica method , gauge symmetry and a duality relation .",
    "in addition it was necessary to introduce an ansatz to identify the location of a singularity of the free energy .",
    "the resulting conjecture for the transition point ( multicritical point ) is nevertheless in satisfactory agreement with a number of numerical results , which renders a strong support to the validity of our prescription . in the present paper",
    "we present a more systematic analysis leading to the ansatz , thus reducing the problem to that of the analyticity proof of a function related to duality .",
    "the ansatz was introduced somewhat arbitrarily previously .",
    "the discussions in the present paper make it clear that the ansatz is closely related to the analyticity of a well - defined function , which paves a path toward the formal proof of the conjecture .",
    "for simplicity , let us consider the @xmath0 ising model on the square lattice .",
    "it is possible to apply the same line of argument as presented below to other systems ( non - ising models and/or other lattices ) as will be mentioned in the final section .",
    "the hamiltonian is @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a quenched random variable with asymmetric distribution and @xmath3 .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are imposed .",
    "we accept the replica method in this paper and do not strive to rigorously justify the validity of taking the limit @xmath4 in the end , where @xmath5 is the number of replicas",
    ".    the @xmath5-replicated partition function after configurational average is a function of edge boltzmann factors : @xmath6\\equiv z_n(x_0(k , k_p ) , x_1(k , k_p),\\cdots , x_n(k , k_p ) ) .",

    "the discussions so far have already been given in references @xcite . in those papers we went on to try to identify the multicritical point by the fixed - point condition of the principal boltzmann factor , @xmath37 , combined with the nishimori line ( nl ) condition @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "the reason for the latter choice is that the multicritical point is expected to lie on the nl @xcite . in this way",
    "an ansatz was made at this stage that the multicritical point is given by the relation @xmath39 .",

    "[ lemma2 ]    _ proof .",
    "_ since the normalized partition function is a multinomial of normalized edge boltzmann factors @xmath73 with positive coefficients , the first half of the above statement is trivial . to check the second half , we note that @xmath74 corresponds to the case where no antiparallel spin pairs are allowed in any replica at any bond .",
    "the only allowed spin configuration is the all - parallel ( i.e. perfectly ferromagnetic ) one , for which we have set the energy 0 ( or the edge boltzmann factor @xmath75 ) since the energy is measured from such a state by dividing @xmath62 by @xmath28 .",
    "taking into account the global inversion degeneracy , we conclude that @xmath76 is equal to @xmath77 . similarly , when @xmath78 ( corresponding to the high - temperature limit ) , all spin configurations show up with equal probability .",
    "therefore the normalized partition function just counts the number of possible spin configurations , yielding @xmath79 .",
    "now we are ready to step toward the main theorems .",
    "there exists a monotone decreasing function @xmath80 with @xmath81 and @xmath82 by which the value of @xmath83 at @xmath84 becomes equal to the value at @xmath85 , @xmath86    _ proof . _",
    "according to lemma [ lemma1 ] , the curve @xmath87 starts from the point @xmath88 and ends at @xmath89 as @xmath7 increases from 0 to @xmath53 .",

    "( [ zn_duality3 ] ) and theorem 1 .",
    "the normalized partition function is self - dual with a fixed point @xmath101 given by @xmath102 , which is equivalent to @xmath103 .",
    "_ the first half of the statement is immediate from corollary 1 .",
    "the second half comes from the observation that the values of @xmath46 on both sides of eq .",
    "( [ zn_duality4 ] ) become identical at the fixed point @xmath102 , thus making the prefactors , @xmath104 and @xmath105 , equal to each other .",
    "assume that @xmath80 has no singularity for @xmath106 . if the free energy per site of the replicated system has a unique singularity at some @xmath107 in the thermodynamic limit , then @xmath108 is equal to @xmath101 of theorem 2 .    _",
    "_ as long as @xmath80 is analytic , the above statement is the same one as the usual duality argument for the ferromagnetic ising model on the square lattice , in which @xmath80 is @xmath109 .",
    "however , if @xmath80 happens to be singular at @xmath110 for example , this singularity would be reflected in the singularity of the free energy ( away from the fixed point @xmath101 ) through the relation ( [ zn_duality4 ] ) : the free energy per spin derived from the right - hand side will be singular at @xmath110 reflecting the singularity of @xmath80 there .",
    "this causes a singularity of the free energy derived from the left - hand side at @xmath110 .",
    "we have been unable to prove analyticity of @xmath80 .",

    "we have limited ourselves to the @xmath0 ising model on the square lattice for simplicity .",
    "it is straightforward to apply the same type of argument to other lattices and other models .",
    "for example , models on the square lattice ( such as the gaussian ising spin glass and the random chiral potts model ) can be treated very similarly : the differences lie only in the explicit expressions of @xmath62 as given in section 2.9 of reference @xcite and section 4.1 of reference @xcite .",
    "also , the duality structure of the four - dimensional random plaquette gauge model is exactly the same as the @xmath0 ising model on the square lattice @xcite , and therefore the present analysis applies without change . in the case of mutually dual pairs of lattices , such as the triangular and hexagonal lattices or the three - dimensional @xmath0 ising model and the three - dimensional random - plaquette gauge model",
