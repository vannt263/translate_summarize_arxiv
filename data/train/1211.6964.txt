    "dense liquids exhibit slow relaxation processes in thermal equilibrium , characterized by a time scale @xmath0 that diverges as the liquid is driven to structural arrest into an amorphous solid @xcite .",
    "this opens a window rich in nonlinear phenomena under flow , both amenable to experiment and theoretical treatment .",
    "it is of interest , because the externally imposed flow strongly disturbs the equilibrium relaxation processes .",
    "more precisely , given a typical single - particle relaxation time scale @xmath1 , we consider shear flow with deformation rate @xmath2 such that @xmath3 , but @xmath4 .",
    "this nonlinear rheology has in particular been studied in colloidal dispersions and soft - matter systems , where the mesoscopic size of the constituent particles implies relaxation times of @xmath5 , easily probed by moderate flow in experiment . in the flowing steady state ,",
    "shear thinning is the most prominent phenomenon : @xcite the apparent viscosity of the sheared fluid decreases rapidly with increasing shear rate @xmath2 .",
    "quite generally , the flowing steady state is characterized by a nonlinear relation between the macroscopic stress @xmath6 and the applied shear rate @xmath2 .",
    "going beyond the steady state , the behavior under start - up flow has received particular attention . as a steady shear flow of rate @xmath2",
    "is suddenly switched on at @xmath7 , stresses @xmath6 increase from zero ( assuming the experiment was started in an equilibrated and hence stress - free configuration ) to their steady - state value @xmath8 .",
    "the resulting stress - strain curve @xmath9 , measured as a function of applied deformation @xmath10 for @xmath11 , exhibits a peculiar intermediate maximum , termed stress overshoot .",
    "this is typically found in amorphous metals @xcite , or ( for different reasons ) polymer melts @xcite .",
    "the maximum of the @xmath9 curve has been linked to material stability : it can be taken as a yield stress that separates reversible ( linear and nonlinear ) elastic deformation at small strains from irreversible plastic flow induced by larger deformations .",
    "more recently , stress overshoots have also been discussed in soft colloidal systems , underlining a generic mechanism applicable in a wide variety of system classes @xcite .    as a transient phenomenon ,",
    "the stress overshoot is susceptible to the history of sample preparation .",
    "molecular dynamics simulations have addressed this focusing on the shear - molten amorphous solid , where a systematic dependence was found on the waiting time @xmath12 between sample preparation and flow start - up @xcite , as long as the start - up configuration is not fully equilibrated , @xmath13 .    in the engineering literature",
    "it is well established that the stress - strain curve depends on the deformation history of the sample .",
    "one particular example was found empirically by johann bauschinger in the 1880 s during experiments on various steels @xcite : these materials typically are softer under compressional load after having been subject to tension .",
    "this is , in the strict sense , called the bauschinger effect . as an abstraction ,",
    "take the case where pre - shear is applied in one particular direction , and consider the modified stress ",
    "strain curve measured if shear is then applied in the opposite direction .",
    "typically , the regime of elastic deformation shrinks , so that plastic rearrangements dominate much earlier than in an initially unstrained sample . reversing the shear rate , which we will call bauschinger effect also , in the following , has been discussed @xcite in the framework of the shear - transformation - zone theory ( stz ) , where one attributes internal degrees of freedom to the stzs , which carry the memory of the deformation history .",
    "recent simulation studies of the bauschinger effect @xcite in a system quenched into its low - temperature glassy state have been analyzed in terms of anisotropic elastic constants that arise due to the deformation history .",
    "it is a matter of current debate whether and how the rheological properties of amorphous materials deep in the glassy state ( here referred to as essentially the @xmath14 case ) , and at much higher temperaturs in the melt , are related . in athermal systems , concepts like stzs @xcite and avalanches of yielding events",
    "@xcite are widely recognized as useful to rationalize macroscopic behavior .",
    "but the range of applicability of these approaches is not well understood when dealing with liquids close to their glass transition , where thermal fluctuations dominate yielding mechanisms that may be qualitatively different from , say , athermal jamming @xcite .",
    "the rheology of dense liquids is the realm of a recent extension of the mode - coupling theory of the glass transition ( mct ) to sheared colloidal systems @xcite .",
    "intriguingly , some of the macroscopic phenomena are quite alike in both quasi - athermal systems and liquids driven by thermal noise .    here",
    "we investigate , both by mode - coupling theory and computer simulation , the nonlinear rheology under flow reversal in the initially equilibrated liquid state , without referring to @xmath14 properties .",
    "the initial stress overshoot is shown to vanish if the flow is reversed in the steady state .",
    "hence , the bauschinger effect does not require an explanation associated with properties of the quenched glass or aging phenomena .",
    "we study its connection to the time - dependent memory of past flow that is typical for dense liquids , by investigating the effect of flow reversal applied at various times during the initial evolution from equilibrium to steady state .",
    "a clear separation between reversible elastic rearrangements and irreversible plastic flow emerges .",
    "we connect the macroscopic stress response to microscopic particle motion , quantified through the transient mean - squared displacements .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section  [ sec:1 ] contains the exposition of the theoretical approach , and section  [ sec:2 ] gives an overview of the simulation . in sec .",
    "[ sec:3 ] we discuss the comparison between theory and simulation , and the insights thereby gained .",
    "section  [ sec:4 ] concludes with an outlook .",
    "our theoretical approach is based on the mode - coupling theory of the glass transition ( mct ) @xcite , as extended to deal with nonlinear rheology in the integration - through transients ( itt ) formalism @xcite .",
    "itt - mct is a microscopic ( albeit approximate ) theory describing the dynamical correlation functions of the wave - vector dependent density fluctuations in glass - forming liquids .",
    "suitably generalized green - kubo relations provide the nonequilibrium transport coefficients in the nonlinear - response regime ; within mct , they are expressed as integrals over the density correlators .",
    "the coupling coefficients of the theory are fully determined by knowing the equilibrium static structure of the liquid .",
    "the theory then predicts an ideal glass transition to occur as a bifurcation transition : smooth changes in control parameters such as density or temperature bring about a discontinuous change in the long - time behavior of the density correlation functions .",
    "these decay to zero in the equilibrium liquid , but attain a finite long - time limit , the glass form factor , in the ideal glass .",
    "the theory compares semi - quantitatively to the linear rheology measured in colloidal hard sphere dispersions @xcite .    since the full microscopic theory is rather cumbersome to solve ,",
    "various simplifications have been devised .",
    "schematic models try to capture mathematically the essence of the bifurcation transition by reducing the number of correlation functions to a few or only one , at the cost of neglecting spatial information .",
    "the important correlations contained in the schematic models are temporal ones .",
    "memory effects are contained in generalized friction kernels depending on ( up to ) three times .",
    "causality is automatically enforced , and the flow history of the sample is contained in the friction - kernels via time- or strain - dependent elastic coefficients and structural relaxation functions .",
    "the latter describe plastic deformation , and their nonlinear equations of motion are the heart of the theory . the non - markovian equations of the schematic models contain a small number of fitting parameters that mimic the relation between the equilibrium structure ( encoding the interaction potential ) and the theory s coupling coefficients .",
    "smooth and regular variations of the parameters lead to dramatic elasto - plastic and viscoelastic changes in the structural relaxation and non - linear rheology .",
    "the interpretation of the effects in terms of spatially dependent particle rearrangements can not be achieved by the schematic model , and thus it remains unresolved to which degree force - chains , heterogeneities , or specific plastic rearrangement centers are described in a ( presumably ) space - averaged manner .      a schematic mct model for the time - dependent rheology of colloidal suspensions",

    "the microscopic theory implies a relation between @xmath21 and @xmath24 that involves an integration over wave vectors , including nontrivial weights that depend on time since density fluctuations are advected by shear .",
    "it is therefore plausible to extend the original schematic model by allowing for a prefactor @xmath25 that depends on time through the accumulated strain @xmath26 , @xmath27 symmetry dictates that the direction of the strain does not matter , leading to an even function @xmath28 .",

    "the time - dependent modulus becomes negative and the stress - strain curve exhibits an overshoot with its peak at the critical strain .",

    "it is this history dependence that causes the bauschinger effect and similar pre - shear - dependent phenomena in the model , rather than spatial anisotropies induced by the pre - shear ( since no information on spatial variation of fluctuations is kept ) .",
    "this is in alignment with the microscopic mct and molecular - dynamics simulations of the sheared thermal fluid @xcite , where it was found that the steady state exhibits almost isotropic ( one - time ) pair correlation functions .",
    "this may be different in the athermal limit .",
    "it does , however , qualitatively explain the disappearance of the stress overshoot , and our findings for the tagged - particle correlation functions and mean - squared displacements . immediately",
    ", this discussion predicts , that inserting a waiting time between the opposing flows would cause the bauschinger effect to weaken and go away . any quiescent waiting period before shear - reversal would enable relaxation to proceed and would ultimately lead to startup curves from the quiescent state . when shear is started from the quiescent equilibrium configuration ,",
    "nearest - neighbor cages need to be broken before the accumulated strain becomes effective in enhancing the relaxation dynamics .",
    "the critical strain is hence connected to a typical cage size ; some percent of the particle diameter following a lindemann - type criterion for melting . the sheared steady state is then characterized by less strong cages , and the directionality of the flow does not play a major role in this weakening effect .",
    "hence , subsequent shear in the opposite direction will lead to an earlier and more gradual relaxation of correlation functions ( cf .",
    "[ fig : fsqt_shear ] ) .",
    "the mean - squared displacements , observed to follow the unsheared equilibrium curve up to times corresponding to the critical strain in the case of startup shear , remain much closer to the sheared steady - state ones in the case of flow reversal from such a steady state .",
    "as a consequence , the sharp upturn observed for the startup case , connected to superdiffusive motion and a stress overshoot , vanishes .    at present , the analysis of the initial stress overshoot after startup of steady shear is based on a schematic model that does have a number of fit parameters whose numerical ratio has to be determined phenomenologically .",
    "however , the model is rooted in an understanding of the microscopic mct @xcite . in simplifying the latter to arrive at a schematic model , one aims to keep those essential features of the solutions qualitatively alike that the model shall describe ;",
    "in this sense , the model used here is a minimal model containing stress - overshoot phenomena .",
    "it is important to note that the subsequent description of the fate of the stress overshoot under time - varying flow drops out naturally from the equations of motion . in this sense , the comparisons presented in figs .",
    "[ fig : stressstrain ] and [ fig : bauschinger ] are qualitatively different ",
    "the first can be viewed as a model - motivated parametrization of the simulation data .",
    "the second  the comparison with the data on the bauschinger effect  entails a parameter - free theoretical prediction .",
