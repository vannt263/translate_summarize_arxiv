    "dynamical maps ( also known as superoperators ) describe generalized linear transformations that can be performed on density matrices .",
    "it has been shown that dynamical maps that preserve the trace of density matrix can be performed by an unitary transformation by adding an ancillary system of a given size  @xcite .    in the related problem of measurement",
    ", generalized measurements would be described by a set of linear maps , where each individual map acting on the density matrix would not preserve its trace , much like a projection acting on a hilbert space ray would not preserve its norm .",
    "it has been shown that if the maps can be described by one - dimensional operations , then it can always be performed as a projection in a larger system ( ie . with a suitable ancillary system ) .    in this paper , we show that any set of non - trace preserving maps can be performed by making unitary transformations and von - neumann ( projective ) measurements in a larger system .",
    "this result shows that all linear transformations and measurements on density matrices can always be performed by unitary transformations and von - neumann measurements , by coupling an ancillary system of appropriate size to the original system .",
    "we will begin by re - deriving the result that a dynamical map can be performed by a unitary transformation in a larger system , and we will show that this proof can be easily extended to a set of maps .",
    "a dynamical map is linear and maps valid density matrices to valid density matrices :    @xmath2 = tr[\\rho ] \\rightarrow \\sum_r   \\lambda_{rr',rs ' } = \\delta_{r',s'}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the map should also be completely positive to preserve the positivity of the density matrix .",
    "a map acting on a @xmath3 density matrix can be written as a @xmath4 hermitian matrix , and therefore it has a canonical decomposition with @xmath5 eigen - operators and real eigenvalues ( see  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite ) :    @xmath6    the condition that the map preserves the trace requires :    @xmath7    let us consider a transformation @xmath8 acting on a larger system , which consists of the original system coupled with an ancillary system of @xmath9 dimensions .",
    "this larger hilbert space is spanned by a basis @xmath10 .",
    "let @xmath8 be given by :    @xmath11_{rr ' } |r^a\\rangle|\\alpha^b\\rangle\\ ] ]    the superscript @xmath12 labels the original system , and the superscript @xmath13 labels the ancillary system .",
    "at this point , we have not yet specified how @xmath8 transforms the states @xmath14 for @xmath15 , however we notice that @xmath8 preserves the orthornormality between states @xmath16 and @xmath17 if :    @xmath18_{s'r }   \\left[l_\\alpha\\right]_{rr ' } = \\delta_{r',s'}\\ ] ]    this is nothing more than the condition that the map preserves the trace , equation  [ norm ] .",
    "so @xmath8 can be easily `` completed '' into a unitary transformation by simply making sure that the states @xmath19 are unitarily transformed into the space orthorgonal to the space spanned by @xmath20 .",
    "exactly how @xmath8 transforms those states is unimportant , so many choices of @xmath8 exist .",
    "now if we take our original density matrix @xmath21 and couple it to an ancillary system of dimensions @xmath9 , initially in the state @xmath22 , the unitary transformation @xmath8 acting on this overall state gives :    @xmath23_{rr ' } \\rho_{r 's ' } \\left[l_\\beta^\\dagger\\right]_{s 's }     tracing over the ancillary system @xmath13 will give us the desired transformation @xmath24 .",
    "therefore , we see that any trace - preserving map can be thought of as the contraction of a unitary transformation acting on a larger system , by suitably coupling an ancillary system of dimension @xmath5 to the original system .",
    "a generalized measurement can be described by a set of maps @xmath25 , where the probability of the ith outcome is @xmath26 $ ] and the state of the system if the ith outcome is obtained ( post - selection ) is @xmath27 $ ] .",
    "individually , the maps @xmath28 would not preserve the trace of density matrix , but if the measurement is complete ( ie .",
    "total probability is 1 ) then the overall map @xmath29 will preserve the trace of the density matrix .",
    "let us decompose the maps into their eigen - operators and eigenvalues :    @xmath30    the condition that the trace is preserved gives :    @xmath31    let us define a transformation @xmath32 in a larger space :    @xmath33_{rr ' }      the ancillary system here is now labelled with 2 indices @xmath34 , and its size is given by the number of operators @xmath35 .",
    "this size is bounded by @xmath1 , where @xmath0 is the number of maps @xmath28 , since each map @xmath36 has at most @xmath37 eigen - operators .    as in the previous section",
    ", we have not defined the transformation on a complete set of states , but it preserves the orthornormality between the states @xmath38 and @xmath39 :    @xmath40^*_{rr ' } \\left[l^{(i)}_\\alpha\\right]_{rs ' } =   \\delta_{r ' s'}\\ ] ]    the last equality is obtained by applying equation  [ sum ] .",
    "we can therefore complete @xmath32 into a unitary transformation as in the previous section .",
    "now @xmath32 acting on the initial state @xmath41 will give :    @xmath42_{rr ' } \\rho_{r ' s ' } \\left[l^{(j)}_\\beta\\right]^*_{ss ' }     if we make a von - neumann measurement on the ancillary system , given by the projections @xmath43 , the ith outcome would give @xmath44 .",
    "we had required in the last section that the combination of all the maps , @xmath29 , preserves the trace of the quantum state , so it would represent a complete measurement . if @xmath29 does not preserve the trace , we need only add a map @xmath45 into the set of maps to be performed .",
    "any outcome due to this extra map is discarded , this has the effect of reducing the trace of the quantum state .    in the case where we want to perform a dynamical map @xmath46 that does not preserve the trace",
    ", we can perform the measurement procedure as outlined in the last section on the set of maps @xmath47 , and discard the outcome if @xmath48 is obtained .",
    "we have shown that all linear measurements and transformations on density matrices can be accomplished by `` traditional '' von - neumann measurements and unitary transformations , when performed in a suitably large system .",
    "we would like to thank anil shaji and todd tilma , for their help and insightful discussions ."
