    "<S> since similar magnetic anisotropy is also observed in the paramagnetic tetragonal phase of superconducting bafe@xmath8ni@xmath9as@xmath10 , our results suggest that the spin excitation anisotropy in superconducting iron pnictides originates from similar anisotropy already present in their parent compounds . </S>"
