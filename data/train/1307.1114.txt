    "kac s  @xcite question can one hear the shape of a drum ?  is part of the scientific pop culture  @xcite .",
    "the technical side of the question concerns our ability to completely specify  the geometry of a domain from the eigenvalues of its laplacian .",
    "the question has been reinterpreted in the study of schrdinger operators on metric graphs by gutkin and smilansky  @xcite and restated in algebraic graphs theory as which graphs are determined by their spectrum ?  by van dam and haemers  @xcite .",
    "( through this work , the _ spectrum _ of a matrix @xmath0 , denoted by @xmath1 , is the set of its eigenvalues . ) while we commonly employ different types of matrices to encode the structure of graphs , none has yet been shown to efficiently provide a _ complete graph invariant _ , _",
    "i.e. _ , a parameter that does not change under a permutation of the vertex labels . the spectrum of the adjacency matrix , for example , is a common invariant and easily seen to satisfy the if  part of this statement ; however , it is not a complete invariant , given the fact that co - spectral non - isomorphic graphs are abundant  @xcite ( see for instance supplementary information section a ) . in the same spirit , physical scenarios have suggested various notions of refined spectra as a tool for distinguishing graphs , with partial degrees of success  @xcite .",
    "a common intersection for these approaches is quantum mechanics , arguably due to the popularization of quantum dynamics on graphs at the beginning of the last decade  @xcite .",
    "it is interesting , not only from the historical point of view , to observe that the strong link between physics and graphs is via the ising model , perhaps the most studied model in statistical mechanics .",
    "originally proposed in 1925  @xcite as a simplified description of the magnetic properties of materials , the ising model has found a vast number of applications from biology to solid state physics .",
    "its great importance is emphasized by exact solutions and numerical techniques for the identification of phase transitions and critical phenomena  @xcite .",
    "the ising model framework seems particularly suitable to observe differences between classical and quantum mechanics in terms of spectral information , since the quantum case is directly obtained by adding an appropriate ( transverse )  magnetic field to the classical hamiltonian .    in what follows ,",
    "we map a graph into an ising model and interpret its energy spectrum as a graph invariant , before and after the switch  from classical to quantum mechanics .",
    "we demonstrate with exhaustive numerical examples that the quantum spectrum is a stronger invariant and propose a general framework to define physically meaningful graph polynomials .",
    "determining whether the quantum energy spectrum is a complete invariant remains an open problem .",
    "we perform experiments on a programmable annealer with superconducting flux technology  @xcite .",
    "our purpose is to hear the shape of an ising model , by generating statistics of low energy states as the outcome of a noisy evolution .",
    "the experiment is run disregarding whether or not the state of the device follows an adiabatic path along its instantaneous ground state , therefore against the prescription for successful annealing  @xcite .",
    "in other words , we are not only interested in the ground state but , unconventionally , in the full output of a noisy computation .",
    "we obtain data on non - isomorphic graphs that are distinguished by their quantum energy spectra but not by the classical ones .",

    "@xcite , which is a fundamental invariant that determines many parameters including girth , chromatic number , _",
    "etc_. remarkably , the jones polynomial of a knot is contained in the tutte polynomial  @xcite .",
    "recall that , formally , @xmath3 and @xmath29 are _ isomorphic _ if they are the same graph up to a relabeling of the vertices .",
    "this is denoted by @xmath30 .",
    "it is not hard to find graphs with the same tutte polynomial ( t - equivalent ) that are not isomorphic  @xcite :  for example , all trees on the same number of vertices .",
    "observe that two graphs @xmath3 and @xmath29 have the same partition function if and only if they share the same spectrum of the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ eq : isinghamiltonian ] ) ( _ i.e. _ @xmath31 ) .",
    "we say that @xmath3 and @xmath29 are _ co - ising _ if @xmath32 . since the tutte polynomial is a generalization of the partition function , if two graphs are t - equivalent then they share the same energy spectrum and thus are co - ising .",
    "thus , we know the following:@xmath33    intuitively , we may attempt a refinement by adding a longitudinal field .",
    "the hamiltonian of the _ ising model on _ @xmath3 _ with longitudinal field _ is defined by the diagonal matrix @xmath34 where @xmath35 is a @xmath10 matrix , with @xmath36 , @xmath37 if @xmath38 and @xmath39 otherwise .",

    "the following equation summarizes what we know about graphs with this property ( see supplementary information section a and b for examples):@xmath44    from the diagonal matrices @xmath21 and @xmath0 , we can define the _ energy _ and _ magnetization _ vectors as @xmath45 and @xmath46 , where @xmath47 runs over the classical states of the ising model on @xmath3 , where @xmath48 denotes the ground state . with the use of these vectors ,",
    "the _ bivariate ising polynomial _ is defined as  @xcite : @xmath49 notice that the spectrum @xmath50 can be obtained from @xmath51 for all values of the constants @xmath20 and @xmath43 , since a change in these parameters is just a rescaling of the coefficients @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "the ising polynomial generalizes the partition function in eq .   because @xmath54 , encodes the matching polynomial , is related to the van der waerden polynomial , and is contained in a more general polynomial introduced by goldberg , jerrum and paterson  @xcite .",
    "the bivariate ising polynomial in eq .",
    "can be intuitively generalized by working with _ any _ physical observable in addition to energy and magnetization .",
    "if we denote by @xmath55 the eigenvalues of a diagonal matrix ( or observable ) @xmath56 , we can then define a multivariate polynomial @xmath57 an example is given by the ( permutationally invariant ) spin - glass order parameter used by hen and young  @xcite . + * quantum cospectrality . *",
    "the invariants that we have so far considered belong to classical physics .",
    "we can now move into a quantum mechanical regime by adding a further field .",
    "the hamiltonian of the _ quantum ising model _ on @xmath3 , as proposed by lieb , schultz , and mattis  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) is defined by the matrix @xmath58 where @xmath59 is a transverse external magnetic field ; here @xmath60 is a @xmath10 matrix , with @xmath61 , @xmath62 if @xmath38 and @xmath63 otherwise . as in the longitudinal case , @xmath64 does not depend on @xmath3 .",

    "the quantum partition function is defined analogously to the classical one : @xmath67 two graphs are quantum co - ising if and only if they have the same quantum partition function .",

    "the whole spectrum is obtained iteratively . the statement above and its proof are valid only for systems of finite size .",
    "it is a well - known fact that different hamiltonians can have the same partition function in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "we tested numerically the converse of this fact by computing the smallest eigenvalue for @xmath73 .",
    "we tested all graphs with @xmath74 , all bipartite graphs with @xmath75 , all vertex transitive graphs with @xmath76 , all regular graphs with @xmath75 , and all trees with @xmath77 ( also considered in  @xcite ) .",
    "we failed to find a counterexample .",

    "we can not generalize directly the quantum partition function to a generating ising polynomial as done in the classical case  when eigenvalues are integers ( for @xmath79 )  although we can use the well - known suzuki - trotter formalism to obtain a classical approximation  @xcite ; the direct calculation of the eigenvalues is notoriously expensive , due to the size of the problem , and prone to errors , making it difficult to numerically show the existence of non - isomorphic quantum co - ising graphs . a reasonable first approximation for this task",

    "temperature and environment will usually excite the system . while these effects are disruptive in the standard applications of quantum annealing , we regard such a non - ideal implementation as a way to generate the statistics of low energy states on which we measure the corresponding observables . for this purpose , we run experiments on a d - wave vesuvius  programmable annealer .",

    "quantum effects on the chip are currently under investigation and there is evidence of quantum annealing on random spin glass problems  @xcite . the hamiltonians that can be realized with the device are exactly of the type in eq .  , where @xmath95 is a non - linear function of time .",
    "the most general form of the final hamiltonian @xmath96 is given by an ising model whose possible spin interactions are constrained by the chip architecture .",
    "a particular limitation of the hardware is that measurements can be performed only at the end of the evolution .",
    "thus , the maximal information that we can extract is encoded in the multivariate polynomials of eq .  .",
    "on the other hand , the final state of the chip is a result of a dynamics also governed by the transversal field @xmath64 .",
    "in fact , our experiments attempt to identify the effects of @xmath64 in the final statistics after the measurement outcomes are filtered out using various type of multivariate polynomials .",
    "we have tested the annealer on two pairs of non - isomorphic graphs @xmath3 and @xmath29 ( @xmath97 and @xmath98 , @xmath99 and @xmath100 , in supplementary information section b and c ) such that @xmath101 , @xmath42 , and @xmath102 , _",

    "these are respectively the smallest and the largest values that can be reliably set on the hardware .",
    "the final states are organized according to the values of the two observables . as a consequence of the fact that the two graphs are co - ising ,",
    "the measured values of the pairs \\{energy , magnetization } are the same , and can not be used to distinguish the two graphs . moreover , the shape of the two distributions is also the same up to statistical errors .",
    "the shape of this distribution is assumed to be a consequence of ( noisy ) open system quantum dynamics  @xcite ( see supplementary information section d for a comparison between experimental and thermal statistics ) .",
    "this means that we are not able to identify differences in the final distributions that may arise due to the different quantum spectra , _",
    "i.e. _ due to non - equivalent quantum evolution along the annealing schedule .    the graphs are indistinguishable by measuring energy and magnetization only .",
    "however , they become distinguishable in figure  [ data13b ] by measuring the triplet \\{energy , magnetization , @xmath103 } , as clearly visible in the statistics obtained with the chip .",
    "the pair @xmath106 is not distinguished by the triplet on the experimental data , as showed in figure  [ data27 ] .",
    "it should be possible , in principle , to classically distinguish these graphs with the introduction of additional observables .",
    "similarly to what happens for the @xmath97 pair , there are no noticeable differences in the shape of the final distributions that can detect differences in the quantum spectra .",
    "the interplay between combinatorics and the classical ising model is well - established .",
    "we have introduced a general family of physically meaningful graph polynomials suggesting a hierarchy of graph invariants .",
    "we have demonstrated that the quantum ising model is a finer sieve to distinguish graphs than its classical analogue by considering the quantum partition function as a graph invariant .",
    "we have tested experimentally its distinguishability power on a d - wave programmable annealer , by taking graphs with different quantum spectra and the same classical ising partition function .",
    "we used the hardware unconventionally to generate the statistics of low energy eigenvalues rather than focusing on the ground state .",
    "the data obtained can distinguish one pair of graphs when measuring with respect to a classical refinement of the partition function .",
    "we did not find any measurable difference in the statistics of measurement outcomes of the two pairs that can be related to non - equivalent quantum dynamics .",
    "notice that the transverse field spectra are very similar ( fig .  9 in the supplementary material ) .",
    "of course , differences expected in an ideal quantum system are possibly lost due to decoherence when approaching the classical regime at the end of the adiabatic evolution .    going beyond the scope of this work",
    ", it would be interesting to compare the experimental data with numerical simulations of the corresponding open quantum spin system at finite temperature  @xcite .",
    "we propose two approaches to amplify the differences in the quantum spectra : ( a ) reduce substantially the annealing time ; ( b ) perform measurements when the transverse field is on .",
    "both approaches require a modification of the current control of the hardware .",
    "another interesting goal is to define other efficient observables , such as @xmath107 , that would amplify the possible differences in the measurement statistics . from the theoretical point of view",
    "a natural open question is whether the transverse field alone is sufficient to define a complete spectral graph invariant .",
