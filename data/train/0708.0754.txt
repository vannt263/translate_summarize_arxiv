    "hexagonal ymno@xmath0 is one of the most well - known examples of multiferroics , a material that possesses both ferroelectricity and magnetism .",
    "the ferroelectric ( fe ) transition occurs at a relatively high temperature above 900 k. below the curie temperature the compound crystallizes in a hexagonal structure with the space group @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the mn@xmath7 ( @xmath8=2 ) ions form nearly triangular networks in @xmath9=0 and @xmath9=1/2 layers which stack in the abab sequence along the @xmath9 axis with a wide separation introduced by the intervening y and o ions @xcite .",
    "this suggests a predominant two - dimensional ( 2d ) character in the @xmath10 plane . for this system the geometrical frustration of",
    "the antiferromagnetic ( af ) spins on the triangular lattice results in the @xmath11 spin ordering below the nel temperature @xmath1 @xmath12 70 k.    the curie - weiss ( cw ) temperature deduced from susceptibility measurements is approximately ten times higher than @xmath1 @xcite and the magnetic moment is lower than the expected value from the fully polarized mn@xmath7 @xcite .",
    "this reduction in @xmath1 and magnetic moment is consistent with strong spin fluctuations due to geometrical frustration and/or low dimensionality .",
    "the coexistence of novel magnetism and ferroelectricity suggests a peculiar interaction between the spins and the lattice degrees of freedom , although the low @xmath1 , compared to the ferroelectric transition , infers weak coupling between magnetism and ferroelectricity . although various crystallographic , optical and magnetic structural studies have been performed to characterize independently the fe and magnetic properties @xcite , only a few ones have been directed to understand their interrelation .",
    "dielectric constant @xcite , specific heat @xcite and thermal conductivity @xcite experiments revealed a spin - lattice coupling whose understanding remains an open question .",
    "as far as magnetism is concerned , neutron scattering studies @xcite have reported the presence of unconventional spin fluctuations both above and below @xmath1 that could be related to the anomalous increase of the thermal conductivity upon magnetic ordering @xcite .",
    "however , the question of coexistence of long - range order with significant spin - fluctuations in the nel state for the triangular lattice remains .",
    "the symmetry of the order parameter and the nature of the universality class associated with the @xmath11 spin structure are also not resolved up to now .    to investigate the coupling between magnetism and the lattice degrees of freedom in ymno@xmath0 , we report an ultrasonic investigation of the elastic moduli of a single crystal in the temperature range 2 - 150 k , both above and below the spin ordering temperature @xmath1 .",
    "although elastic anomalies at @xmath1 are observed on all studied moduli , an important coupling of the magnetic order parameter is only obtained with an in - plane strain field .",
    "a landau free energy expansion is used to interpret these anomalies and a critical analysis of the temperature behavior just below @xmath1 is tentatively given .",
    "small temperature hysteretic effects are observed indicating a domain structure .",
    "a peculiar temperature profile above @xmath1 for two moduli is discussed in relation with the magnetic fluctuation issue .",
    "high quality ymno@xmath0 single crystals are grown using the standard floating zone technique .",
    "powder x - ray diffraction measurements confirmed that the crystal investigated here has the @xmath6 hexagonal structure at room temperature ( @xmath13=@xmath14=6.1380(1) , @xmath15=11.4045(1) ) .",
    "a single crystal was then oriented with a back laue x - ray diffraction technique and cut with a wire - saw to obtain two sets of parallel faces respectively oriented perpendicular ( separation distance 3.29 mm ) and parallel ( 3.54 mm ) to the hexagonal @xmath15 axis .",
    "the faces were subsequently polished to obtain a mirror like aspect .",
    "we used a pulsed - echo ultrasonic technique in the reflection mode to measure the velocity and amplitude of longitudinal and transverses waves propagating along both directions .",
    "the plane acoustic waves were generated with linbo@xmath0 piezoelectric transducers ( fundamental frequency 30 mhz and odd overtones ) bonded to one parallel face with silicon seal .",
    "the technique consists in measuring the phase shift and the amplitude of the first elastic pulse reflected from the opposite parallel face .",
    "doing so , this technique yields only velocity and attenuation variations ; an absolute value of the velocity is obtained by measuring the transit time between different reflected echoes .",
    "the crystal was mounted in a variable temperature insert ( vti ) ; the useful temperature range was 2 - 150 k , the maximum value being imposed by phase transformation of the silicon seal around 200 k. a magnetic field up to 14 tesla could be applied along different directions .    for a crystal having hexagonal symmetry",
    "the elastic modulus matrix has only five non - zero independent components @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "four of these components can be obtained by propagating ultrasonic waves parallel and perpendicular to the hexagonal @xmath15 axis and by measuring the velocity of these waves with various polarizations ( longitudinal and transverse ) . for propagation along @xmath15 ,",
    "the longitudinal and transverse velocities are respectively given by @xmath17 and @xmath18 ; for the perpendicular direction , besides the longitudinal one , two transverse velocities ( polarization @xmath19 and @xmath20 ) are obtained : @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 . by using the density @xmath24 g/@xmath25 and the experimental velocities ,",
    "the four @xmath16 are obtained .",
    "we notice that @xmath26 and @xmath27 are equal if the crystal is correctly oriented , a situation that was checked in our experiment .",
    "the absolute values of the moduli at low temperatures are given in table i.    .[table1]elastic moduli of ymno@xmath0 ( units @xmath28 ) at 4k . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we have then tried to analyze the variation of the elastic moduli @xmath3 , @xmath29 and @xmath4 relative to their value at @xmath1 by fitting the order parameter to @xmath30 near the critical temperature @xmath1 .",
    "@xmath31 where @xmath32 is a constant depending on @xmath33 .",
    "this analysis for @xmath3 and @xmath4 is surely more valid than for @xmath29 since the anomalies are at least 10 times larger at @xmath1 .",
    "the results of this analysis are presented in figure 4 on a log - log scale .",
    "not only the overall temperature dependence appears very similar for @xmath3 and @xmath4 , but the same exponent @xmath34 is obtained with @xmath1 = 72.43(5 ) .",
    "surprisingly the same exponent is also found for @xmath29 , what means that the overall temperature profile of the background near @xmath1 is not important to determine the critical behavior .",
    "also hysteresis effects were found to only affect @xmath1 ( fig.3 ) , not the exponent .",
    "the value @xmath35 , which is obtained over only two decades of the reduced temperature , is neither consistent with chiral xy ( 0.25 ) and chiral heisenberg ( 0.30 ) universality classes or with xy ( 0.35 ) and heisenberg ( 0.36 ) ones @xcite .",
    "although this appears to contradict our previous observation pertaining to the coupling constants , it is clear from fig.4 that the same physical phenomenon is at the origin of the elastic anomalies on @xmath3 and @xmath4 , and by extension on the other two moduli .",
    "the af magnetic order parameter @xmath36 has been associated with 3d heisenberg or 3d xy symmetry classes from specific heat @xcite and muon - spin relaxation @xcite studies ; our study is however not able to resolve this issue .",
    "finally , the sharp downward step observed on @xmath3 ( fig.3a ) could be consistent with the prediction of eq.(6 ) .",
    "on the one hand , the observation of hysteresis in the vicinity of this peak could be consistent with weak ferromagnetism , although this has been observed only in scmno@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , coupling between magnetic and electric domains in ymno@xmath0 has been reported by imaging with optical second harmonic generation @xcite ; it has been suggested that the small anomaly observed on the in - plane dielectric constant @xcite could result from such coupling effects on domain walls @xcite .",
    "the small peak on @xmath3 at @xmath1 together with the observation of hysteresis could result from an interaction between in - plane compression waves and the domain walls .",
    "variation of the attenuation @xmath37 of in - plane compression waves a function of temperature at two frequencies , 103 and 168 mhz.,width=321 ]    previous neutron scattering studies @xcite reported the presence of unconventional spin fluctuations both above and below @xmath1 .",
    "these fluctuations could explain the anomalous behavior of @xmath3 ( and by extension @xmath4 ) well above @xmath1 as shown in figure 3a .",
    "since similar effects are not observed for @xmath38 and @xmath29 , fluctuations preferentially 2d - like associated to in - plane exchange constants are likely responsible .",
    "the ultrasonic attenuation is generally more sensitive to fluctuations since it is a dissipative phenomenon .",
    "these attenuation variations @xmath39 are difficult to obtain with precision on a wide temperature range and this is why they must be interpret with great care .",
    "we present in figure 5 the variation of the attenuation associated to the @xmath3 modulus as a function of temperature at two frequencies .",
    "as the temperature is decreased from high temperature , the attenuation generally decreases because the scattering of the acoustic waves by phonons is reduced . here",
    "the attenuation shows a minimum at a rather high temperature near 110 k for both frequencies and it increases for lower temperatures , a behavior that is not consistent with decreasing phonon scattering . at 103 mhz ,",
    "the af magnetic ordering produces a very sharp peak at @xmath1 but does not change significantly the monotonous increase of the attenuation that begun near 110 k and the attenuation increases down to the lowest temperature . at 168 mhz , the temperature profile from 150 k to 72 k is conserved ; however , the peak is more important at @xmath1 and the attenuation decreases rapidly below the nel temperature . at lower temperature , there is no saturation of the attenuation but a small increase below 30 k is observed .",
    "these attenuation data strongly suggest that spin degrees of freedom , in other words magnetic fluctuations both above ( at least up to 110 k ) and below @xmath1 , dissipate acoustic energy . at @xmath1 ,",
    "the sharp increase is due to the spontaneous strain yielding to eq.(6 ) and for which hysteresis is observed . below @xmath1 ,",
    "spin degrees of freedom are lost when 3d af ordering occur and the attenuation decreases rapidly .",
    "the data reveal an increase of attenuation at temperatures much higher than @xmath1 and a reduction below when 3d af magnetic ordering occurs .",
    "although this reduction increases rapidly in amplitude with frequency , dissipation still occurs well below @xmath1 .",
    "these observations are consistent with _ extraordinary spin - phonon interactions _ deduced from thermal conductivity data @xcite .",
    "how these fluctuations are related to the domain structure remains an open question .",
    "the presence of domains and fluctuations near @xmath1 could complicate the analysis of the critical behavior presented in fig.4 and affect the determination of the exponent @xmath5 .",
    "relative variation of @xmath3 as a function of the magnetic field at two temperatures well below and above @xmath1.,width=321 ]    the magnetic character of the peculiar behavior of @xmath3 above @xmath1 can also be revealed by a magnetic field analysis . up to 14 tesla",
    "we did not find any measurable variation of @xmath1 whatever the orientation of the field relative to the @xmath15 axis was .",
    "this probably implies that the amplitude of the magnetic order parameter below @xmath1 is highly rigid relative to the magnetic field .",
    "nevertheless some magnetic field effects can be measured on @xmath3 over the 2 - 150 k temperature range .",
    "these are presented in figure 6 as @xmath3 variations relative to the value at zero field .",
    "the data are presented as a function of @xmath40 at two temperatures , 10 k well below @xmath1 and 100 k well above for a field applied parallel to the @xmath15 axis .",
    "the field profile is very similar for both temperatures and the absolute value has not even decreased by a factor 2 when the temperature has been multiplied by ten .",
    "these effects have thus to be related to the overall background : a magnetic field enhances the softening of @xmath3 both above and below @xmath1 confirming the existence of important magnetic fluctuations in this geometrically frustrated magnet , fluctuations that are likely enhanced by a magnetic field .",
    "it has been suggested from heat capacity data @xcite that a single einstein contribution could adequately fit the low - temperature deviation , indicating that there is no evidence of a anomalous magnetic contribution for @xmath41 .",
    "our data do not support this suggestion .",
    "in conclusion , our ultrasonic experiments have identified an important coupling between the af magnetic order parameter and the lattice in hexagonal ymno@xmath0 . this coupling yield important stiffening anomalies below @xmath1 only for in - plane elastic deformations , compression and shear .",
    "this implies that the coupling is established via the modulation of the in - plane exchange interactions .",
    "the critical exponent @xmath5 for the af order parameter near @xmath1 is found higher than the expected value from xy and 3d heisenberg universality classes .",
    "this situation favors a conventional antiferromagnetic long range ordering as suggested from other measurements .",
    "however , the data confirm important spin fluctuations over a wide temperature range above and below the nel temperature .",
    "finally , a sharp step appearing on @xmath3 at @xmath1 , for which hysteresis is observed , could be consistent with a weak coupling between ferroelectricity and magnetism at domain walls .",
