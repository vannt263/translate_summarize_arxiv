    "the importance of supernova ( sn ) blastwaves to the interstellar medium ( ism ) has been appreciated for many decades @xcite . in recent years , it has become increasingly clear that accurate treatment of supernova remnant ( snr ) evolution and other energy inputs from massive stars is crucial not just for detailed models of the ism and star formation , but also for models of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "sne are believed to play the predominant role in creating the hot phase and shaping the large - scale structure of the multiphase ism , in driving turbulence in diffuse gas ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "particularly important , as we shall discuss below , is the momentum injected to the ism over the lifetime of a snr .",
    "the role of sne in dense , star - forming molecular clouds is less clear ; due to the time delay before sne occur , other forms of star formation `` feedback '' including protostellar outflows , the pressure of ionized gas in regions , forces from direct and dust - reprocessed radiation , and the pressure of shocked stellar winds may be of comparable or greater importance in driving turbulence and destroying massive molecular clouds ( see * ? ? ?",

    "the expansion of snrs in a uniform medium has been extensively studied via spherically symmetric models and is well characterized by several familiar stages .",
    "the sn explosion event ejects material into interstellar space with typical kinetic energy of @xmath6 and mass of @xmath7-@xmath8 .",
    "the ejecta expand freely as long as the mass swept up by the forward shock is smaller than the ejecta mass ( the free expansion stage ) . as the reverse shock heats up the interior ,",
    "the hot gas temperature and pressure become very high , and expansion into the ambient medium proceeds with negligible radiative cooling .",
    "this is the well known phase of evolution analyzed by @xcite and @xcite ( the st stage ) . in the st stage ,",
    "the outer shock radius varies as @xmath9 , and self - similar solutions describe the interior structure very well .",
    "as the temperature drops , radiative cooling becomes important , and a thin and dense shell is formed at the outer edge of the snr where the temperature is lowest and the density is highest .",
    "after shell formation , a pressure - driven snowplow ( pds ) stage occurs while the interior hot gas has non - negligible pressure ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "after the interior pressure is exhausted , the shell continues to expand and sweep up ism gas as a momentum - conserving snowplow .",
    "one - dimensional , spherical hydrodynamic simulations of snrs with radiative cooling confirm these main stages , also showing that simple treatments of the pds stage ( assuming adiabatic evolution of the hot interior ) are inadequate ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "although spherical models of snr evolution in a uniform medium are well developed , direct application to the ism is questionable since the ism in reality is highly inhomogeneous . without sne , the neutral atomic ism would consist of two distinct phases , with dense cold neutral medium ( cnm ) clouds surrounded by a diffuse warm neutral medium ( wnm ) , as a result of thermal instability @xcite .",
    "where the cnm collects into a large enough cloud that the interior is shielded from uv , it becomes molecular ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , and molecular clouds themselves are highly inhomogeneous because they are pervaded by highly supersonic turbulence .",
    "the addition of sn - driven shocks to the ism makes its inhomogeneity even more extreme , producing a third phase of extremely tenuous gas .",
    "although observational estimates are difficult , the hot ism is believed to fill a fraction @xmath10 of the milky way disk s volume , with the majority filled by wnm ( and embedded cold clouds ) .",
    "since cnm clouds are two orders of magnitude denser than the intercloud wnm but the cold and warm mass fractions of the atomic ism are comparable @xcite , snr expansion will be altered compared to spherical models .",
    "understanding the effects of cloudy structure on snr evolution requires multi - dimensional numerical simulations . as early efforts , effects of cloud compression and evaporation",
    "have been implicitly considered in spherical numerical simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , most multi - dimensional numerical simulations have focused on the detailed evolution and fate of individual shocked clouds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) rather than snr evolution as a whole within the cloudy ism",
    ".    the dearth of systematic studies of the snr evolution in the multiphase ism via direct numerical simulations has also had a serious impact on larger scale simulations . without a model for blastwave propagation in an inhomogeneous medium during weakly radiative stages , the momentum injection from sn feedback is sometimes severely underestimated by considering just the momentum of the immediate ejecta ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "when sn feedback is modeled by thermal energy injection , insufficient numerical resolution leads to the so - called `` overcooling - problem '' ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which artificially suppresses the dynamical impact of sn feedback to the surrounding medium .",
    "although it has long been considered a serious problem in galaxy formation simulations , firm resolution requirements to avoid overcooling have not yet been quantified . instead",
    ", many studies simply adopt a prescription in which cooling is artificially turned off for a period of time ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , this delayed - cooling prescription has the opposite problem of extending the st phase to unrealistically long times .",
    "the method adopted in @xcite , widely used in subsequent studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , disables cooling for the merging time of @xcite , which exceeds the shell formation time by an order of magnitude .",
    "this results in the substantial overestimate of the momentum injection and hot gas production by sne . to address some of these issues",
    ", @xcite have recently developed a ( two - phase ) subgrid model to follow feedback effects from superbubbles , in which the proportions of hot and cold subgrid phases are controlled by thermal conduction , and both phases cool radiatively .",
    "for the purposes of building analytic models of the ism and star formation , and as inputs to subgrid feedback models in numerical simulations of galaxy formation , two important quantities are the total momentum injected by a snr , and the mass of hot gas that it produces .",
    "the momentum , which is transferred to the warm and cold gas , determines the amplitude of turbulence in the volume - filling ism , and also enters inversely in determining the large - scale star formation rate ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the hot gas produced by snrs is important because it may be able to escape the galaxy s gravitational potential and drive a wind ( e.g. * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "although both quantities are important , momentum is more easily characterized as it is conserved at late times , whereas the mass of hot gas steadily declines once cooling has begun .    in this paper , we investigate the momentum injection to the multiphase ism by sne , using direct three dimensional hydrodynamic simulations with cooling .",
    "we shall show that the total momentum injection to an inhomogeneous medium is similar to that in a homogeneous medium , with both comparable to the radial momentum at the end of the st stage .",
    "this is an order of magnitude larger than the initial momentum of the sn ejecta",
    ". we shall also provide firm numerical conditions for resolving the st stage ( thereby obtaining the correct momentum injection and early evolution of the hot medium ) using standard finite - volume methods for hydrodynamics on a grid .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : theory ] , we first summarize theoretical models of spherical snr evolution .",
    "we provide analytic estimates of the shell formation time and key quantities ( size , mass , velocity , momentum , temperature ) of the snr at this epoch .",
    "we then carry out three different sets of simulations , with numerical prescriptions as described in section  [ sec : method ] .",
    "we present results from three - dimensional , hydrodynamic simulations for single sne in a uniform background in section  [ sec : single ] .",
    "we delineate the detailed evolution and compare numerical results to analytic models in section  [ sec : single_ref ] , and provide a systematic parameter study to find numerical convergence conditions in section  [ sec : single_conv ] . in section  [ sec : single_2p ] , we perform a similar systematic study for single sne in the two - phase ism .",
    "an initial exploration of effects of multiple correlated sne in the two - phase ism is presented in section  [ sec : multi_ti ] .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : sumndis ] , we summarize our results and discuss their implications .",
    "here , we also relate our work to other recent studies , and discuss physical limitations of our models and their potential impact on our conclusions . in the appendix , we present results from magnetohydrodynamic models analogous to those of section  [ sec : single ] , with a range of background magnetic field strengths .",
    "in this section , we briefly review analytic theories for the dynamics of radiative snrs . here",
    "we consider the simplest case of spherical expansion , for sn energy @xmath11 and ejecta mass @xmath12 in a uniform medium with density of @xmath13 ( see @xcite for a more comprehensive review ) . in simple analytic models , each evolutionary stage of the snr expansion",
    "can be approximated by a power law expansion of the snr radius in time as @xmath14 .",
    "the value of the power law exponent @xmath15 distinguishes four main stages of the expansion ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : free expansion ( @xmath16 ) , sedov - taylor ( @xmath17 ) , pressure - driven snowplow ( @xmath18 ) , and momentum - conserving snowplow ( @xmath19 ) . at each successive stage ,",
    "the exponent decreases as the available power to drive expansion declines .    in the initial stage of evolution ,",
    "the mass of the ejecta dominates the mass of material that has been swept up from the circumstellar medium .",
    "thus , the ejecta expands ballistically into the circumstellar medium with nearly constant velocity @xmath20 so that @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "the free expansion stage ends when the swept - up mass @xmath23 becomes comparable to the ejecta mass . by equating @xmath24",
    ", we obtain the end of the free expansion stage as @xcite @xmath25 for the snr radius of @xmath26 here , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 where the hydrogen number density of the ambient medium is @xmath29 for 10% helium abundance .",
    "after the reverse shock heats up the ejecta , the evolution of the snr for @xmath30 is well described by evolution of an idealized , point source explosion since the pressure of the snr far exceeds the ambient medium pressure . to a good approximation , in this stage",
    "we can neglect the ejecta mass , energy losses , and the pressure of the ambient medium , and the solution depends only on @xmath11 and @xmath13 ; this defines the st stage .",
    "simple dimensional arguments imply that any length scale in the solution at a given time @xmath31 should be proportional to @xmath32 .",
    "the internal structure of the snr in the st stage is therefore given by a similarity solution with a similarity variable @xmath33 .",
    "a detailed solution gives @xmath34 at the shock radius , when the specific heat ratio is @xmath35 .",
    "we thus have the shock radius , shock velocity , and the immediate postshock temperature during the st stage given by : @xmath36 @xmath37 @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the mean mass per particles , and @xmath40 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "when radiative energy losses are no longer negligible , the st stage ends .",
    "cooling is strongest immediately behind the shock where the density is the highest , and a cool dense shell bounding the snr forms .",
    "the shell formation time can be defined as the time at which the first shocked gas parcel cools ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "a gas parcel shocked at @xmath45 cools down during @xmath46 and forms a shell at @xmath47 .",
    "the time for first shell formation can be obtained by substituting for @xmath48 from equation ( [ eq : tst ] ) in equation ( [ eq : tcool ] ) and then finding the time @xmath45 that minimizes @xmath49 : @xmath50 here , we have used an approximate power - law cooling function @xmath51 with @xmath52 and @xmath53 that gives a fairly good fit for our adopted cooling function in a range of @xmath54 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "note that alternative approximations for the cooling function with @xmath55 change the exponents for energy and density only slightly , in the range 0.21 to 0.24 and -0.57 to -0.53 , respectively . at the time of shell formation",
    ", the outer radius , velocity , postshock temperature , and total swept - up mass are given by : @xmath56 @xmath57 @xmath58 @xmath59 it is notable that the velocity , post - shock temperature , and total swept - up mass of the remnant at the time of shell formation are insensitive to the ambient density .",
    "physically , this is simply because cooling becomes quite strong when the temperature falls below @xmath60k and c and o acquire electrons that can be collisionally excited ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; reaching this temperature ( and the corresponding shock speed ) essentially defines the radiative stage of a snr @xcite .    at shell formation , the shock stalls , and the hot gas in the outer portion of the snr",
    "is rapidly compressed into a cold thin shell .",
    "after shell formation , the shell is still pushed outward by overpressured hot gas in the interior of the snr . under certain idealizations",
    ", this leads to a so - called pressure - driven snowplow ( pds ) stage .",
    "the equation of the motion for the thin shell in the idealized pds stage can be written as @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the mass of the shell and @xmath63 is the expansion velocity of the snr .",
    "if the radiative cooling of the hot interior gas is negligible ( i.e. only the gas immediately behind the shock is assumed to cool ) and the mass of hot gas is assumed to be constant , the interior pressure would drop only from adiabatic expansion as @xmath64 .",
    "for @xmath35 , setting @xmath65 and dropping @xmath66 on the right - hand side leads to a self - similar solution with @xmath18 ( see @xcite for possible variations of this equation with other terms ) .",
    "for the idealized pds solution , the snr interior is treated as uniform , with a mean pressure @xmath67 with @xmath68 where @xmath69 .",
    "note that the mean pressure is about a half of the post - shock pressure .",
    "the final classical stage of a snr begins when the interior pressure @xmath70 has decreased sufficiently that it no longer exceeds the pressure of the ambient medium @xmath66 , making the right hand side of equation ( [ eq : shell ] ) zero .",
    "this leads to the constant radial momentum and a self - similar expansion with @xmath19 .",
    "we now summarize the momentum injection to the ism from each of the above snr expansion stages . in the free expansion stage ,",
    "all the momentum is contained in the ejecta , and the magnitude of the radial momentum is @xmath71 since free expansion by definition assumes negligible interaction with the circumstellar and/or interstellar medium , the ambient medium acquires no momentum at this stage .    in the st stage , the propagating strong shock heats and accelerates the ambient medium . using the st self - similar solutions ,",
    "the total radial momentum of the shocked hot gas can be obtained as @xmath72 the momentum at the time of shell formation ( the end of the st stage ) is obtained by substituting equation ( [ eq : tsf ] ) in equation ( [ eq : pst ] ) : @xmath73 we note that this is nearly linear in the sn energy , and is quite insensitive to the ambient density .",
    "this is because the momentum of the snr during the st stage is @xmath74 , and the expansion velocity at the time of shell formation from equation ( [ eq : vsf ] ) is very insensitive to both total energy and ambient density , @xmath75 .    in the pds stage , the mass and radial momentum in the snr",
    "are dominated by the shell . under the assumption that the interior expands adiabatically ( which is not in fact satisfied ; see below ) , the momentum that would be acquired in an idealized pds stage after @xmath49 can be obtained by integrating equation ( [ eq : shell ] ) , leading to total momentum : @xmath76 }   = { p_{\\rm sf}}{\\left[{1 + 4.6(t_*^{1/7}-1)}\\right]},\\ ] ] where @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "although equation ( [ eq : ppds ] ) suggests only a very slow growth of momentum with time , the increase over @xmath79 would in principle be substantial if the interior of the remnant remained hot for @xmath80 .",
    "however , the above idealized treatment of the post - shell - formation evolution does not agree with detailed time - dependent solutions , and momentum injection in practice increases only modestly subsequent to shell formation . as we shall show in the following sections ( see also * ? ? ? * ) , the classical pds assumption of a hot , adiabatic interior with no mass loss does not apply .",
    "in fact , the mass of hot gas interior to the shell steadily decreases in time , because the outermost part flows into the shell and cools .",
    "since the pressure decreases more rapidly than the simple adiabatic expectation , there is only a brief , cooling - modified pds stage . the momentum injection after shell formation is quite limited , amounting to only @xmath81 of @xmath79 .",
    "we solve the hydrodynamics equations with cooling using the _ athena _ code , which employs an unsplit godunov algorithm @xcite . among the various solvers provided , we utilize the simple muscl - hancock type predictor - corrector scheme ( van leer integrator ; @xcite ) .",
    "for robustness , we utilize piecewise linear spatial reconstruction and roe s riemann solver with h - correction @xcite and first order flux correction @xcite .",
    "we apply h - correction only for zones with maximum signal speed difference ( @xmath15-coefficient in @xcite ) larger than @xmath82 , to avoid artificial diffusion at the interface of the cnm and wnm where the signal speed difference is about @xmath83 .",
    "we solve the cooling term in an operator split manner using a fully implicit method , with newton - raphson root finding .",
    "in addition to the courant condition , the time step is also limited by the cooling solver , which allows only a factor of two variation in the local temperature from the value at the previous time step @xcite .",
    "the governing equations are @xmath84 @xmath85 and @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the mass density , @xmath88 is the velocity , @xmath89 is the total energy density , @xmath90 is the gas pressure , and @xmath91 is the ratio of specific heats .",

    "since the hot gas mass drops very rapidly , the duration of the `` classical '' pds stage is negligible .",
    "as most of the hot gas has already piled into the shell by @xmath154(2 - 3)@xmath49 , the hot gas pressure is no longer high enough to drive the shell outward and add appreciable momentum ( cyan and magenta lines in figure  [ fig : rprof](b ) ; figure  [ fig : tevol](e ) ) .",
    "in addition , the shell becomes thicker at this stage so that the thin shell approximation is no longer valid .",
    "the shell is broken up in this high resolution simulation ( fourth column of figure  [ fig : snap ] ) due to the pressure - driven thin shell overstability and/or nonlinear thin - shell instability @xcite . although we do not explicitly assign perturbations to our models , at the initial interface between the snr and ism there are unavoidably grid - scale nonlinear perturbations due to the mapping of a sphere to cartesian coordinates .",

    "since the normalization factors are close to the analytic estimates from the st solution and the early evolution is expected to converge to the st solution , this agreement is trivial at @xmath163 .    however , even though the classical pds solution is not realized in the numerical models , the characteristic behavior after shell formation is nevertheless essentially the same over a wide range of densities .",
    "model evolution is thus `` congruent '' for varying ambient density when rescaled relative to the snr properties at @xmath124 .    in order to describe the transition between st and pds phases smoothly",
    ", @xcite introduced an analytic description using an offset power - law for radius and a complex fitting model for the thermal energy with additional time dependence .",
    "since energy loss by radiative cooling begins somewhat earlier than the shell formation , they also arbitrarily defined a pds time @xmath164 . here , instead of using the approach of @xcite , we introduce a simpler analytic formula to describe the post - shell formation phase separately .",
    "as already seen in figure  [ fig : tevol ] , the evolution of radius agrees reasonably well with the classical pds solution .",
    "we thus simply adopt @xmath165 ( other exponents between 0.4 and 0.25 give similar results ) .",
    "following @xcite , we describe the evolution of thermal energy after shell formation with an additional time dependence as @xmath166 where @xmath167 is the thermal energy at the st stage , and the factor `` 0.8 '' arises from precooling before the shell formation ( see dotted lines in figure  [ fig : tevol_norm](c ) ) .",

    "concerns about the inefficacy of sne has prompted increased attention to other modes of feedback , a valuable development in itself ( especially for understanding the evolution of molecular clouds at stages prior to the first sn ) . however , these concerns are to some extent misplaced , and reflect numerical rather than physical limitations .",
    "in particular , it can be difficult to capture the crucial ( but spatially small scale )",
    "st stage of evolution  when most of the momentum is imparted  in simulations that must follow extremely large spatial scales and can not afford high resolution for the ism . in item 4",
    "below , we summarize the numerical requirements for properly resolving sn momentum injection . + one reason for the current uncertainty about feedback from sn is that the real ism is far from homogeneous , whereas previous focused studies of snr expansion have mostly considered homogeneous ( or at least isotropic ) environments .",
    "for example , @xcite applied only the initial ejecta momentum @xmath297 rather than the momentum at the end of st phase @xmath79 or the final momentum in the momentum conserving phase @xmath175 , citing concerns regarding inhomogeneity of the site of sn explosion .",
    "however , as seen in section  [ sec : single_2p ] , inhomogeneity of the background medium does not significantly affect the total momentum injection compared to the uniform - medium case .",

    "although different groups have considered different environments and physical ingredients in their simulations , all have reached similar conclusions : the final injected momentum in a homogeneous and inhomogeneous medium are comparable to each other , and in good agreement with the results of our simulations .",
    "this result is irrespective of initialization methods to impose inhomogeneity ; we begin with a two - phase cloud / intercloud medium produced by thermal instability , while @xcite adopt a lognormal density distribution , @xcite adopt a fractal density structure , and @xcite initialize based on a turbulent velocity field .",
    "the latter two studies also consider sne within radially stratified clouds . @xcite and @xcite",

    "this leads to the oft - cited `` overcooling problem , '' namely that the energy of a sn is radiated away without having much impact on the ism , if it is initially deposited in too large an initial volume or mass .",

    "the criterion @xmath215 , equivalent to @xmath307 , corresponds to an enclosed mass of @xmath308 for @xmath309 - 0.1 .",
    "interestingly , this is similar to the condition adopted in @xcite , who argued that @xmath310 would yield an initial temperature in the range of @xmath311-@xmath312 , for which the cooling rate would not be excessive .",

    "however , these models did not include self - gravity , which can lead to higher densities at the sites of sn events such that @xmath313 grid resolution would be marginal or insufficient ( considering that @xmath314 for @xmath309 ) ; alternative approaches are discussed below .",

    "+ if ambient densities are not too high , and the grid is sufficiently fine , the needed resolution requirements @xmath215 ( or @xmath307 ) and @xmath315 can be met , and both the hot gas evolution and momentum injection of a sn can be properly followed by injecting thermal energy and allowing the snr to progress through st and radiative stages .",
    "we recommend this approach for best fidelity in modeling sn feedback .",
    "however , this is not always possible in numerical simulations , even with adaptive mesh refinement techniques .",
    "+ in situations where it is impossible or impractical to resolve snr evolution including the st stage , an alternative is to inject momentum directly to the gas surrounding the feedback site .",
    "this will miss the direct effects of hot gas in the ism ( including potential losses of this gas as a galactic wind ) , but it will still drive turbulence in the warm and cold phases of the ism , which enables star formation to be correctly self - regulated @xcite . to allow for the ( modest ) dependence of momentum injection on ambient conditions , we recommend that equation ( [ eq : pfinal_2p ] ) be used to set the value of the momentum after the mean density in the numerical feedback region is measured . + in a spirit similar to the approach that we recommend , resolution - conditioned approaches to feedback in galaxy formation simulations have been implemented recently by @xcite and @xcite . in both studies ,",

    "the strong magnetic pressure within the compressed shell results in a thicker shell and recompresses hot gas in the later times .",
    "@xcite followed the long - term evolution of a snr in a magnetized medium using axisymmetric two - dimensional simulations , and showed that the magnetic tension force also helps broaden the shell and compress the hot gas ( see also * ? ? ?",

    "magnetic fields play an important role in determining the volume of the hot gas in very late stages of a snr , and therefore affects the porosity of the ism .    here , we are interested in assessing potential effects of magnetic fields on momentum injection by snrs in the ism .",
    "we have re - run the set of su models , but now include a uniform magnetic field in the @xmath328-direction @xmath329 .",
    "the magnetic field strength is set by using the plasma beta @xmath330 where the thermal pressure of the ism in our models varies with the mean density , @xmath331 , as @xmath332 . for reference , the magnetic field strength is @xmath333    figure  [ fig : tevol_mhd ] plots time evolution of physical properties of the snr in models su - n1 with @xmath289 , 1 , 10 , and @xmath334 .",
    "all models follow almost the same evolution except at late time in the model with @xmath289 .",
    "it is obvious that the magnetic energy in the shell becomes comparable to the thermal energy of the shell only for @xmath289 after shell formation ( see figure  [ fig : tevol_mhd](c ) ) .",
    "as reported in earlier work , a strong magnetic field within the shell recompresses the interior hot gas ( smaller @xmath335 at late time for @xmath289 ) , leading to larger @xmath137 and @xmath70 at late times ( see figure  [ fig : tevol_mhd](d ) and ( f ) )",
    ". however , the radial momentum is almost the same for all cases .",
    "this is because the majority of the momentum is injected to the ism before the magnetic energy in the shell is very large . even for the @xmath289 case ,",
    "full momentum is acquired by ( 2 - 3)@xmath49 , when the magnetic energy just begins to dominate the thermal energy .",
    "figure  [ fig : snap_mhd ] displays the structure of the model with @xmath301 and @xmath289 in the yz plane . early evolution is the same as for the unmagnetized model ( left three columns , see figure  [ fig : snap ] ) , while non - spherical structure emerges in the latest stage ( rightmost column ) .",
    "the outer shock can propagate farther in the direction perpendicular to the magnetic fields ( fast mode ) , while shell broadening results in compression of the interior hot gas .",
    "we have also performed simulations analogous to models su - n0.1 , su - n10 , and su - n100 with @xmath289 , 1 , and 10 .",
    "we find that the normalized evolution for all cases is `` congruent '' ( as in unmagnetized models ) up to 2 or 3 @xmath49 , so that the final momentum remains unchanged .",
    "this suggests that ism magnetic fields with reasonable strengths of @xmath336 may be able to alter late time evolution and porosity of the hot gas , but would not significantly affect the injected momentum ( see also * ? ? ?"
