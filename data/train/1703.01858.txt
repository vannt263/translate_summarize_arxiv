    "matrix models in which a fixed matrix is perturbed by a random one appear frequently in specialist literature , see e.g. @xcite . the papers @xcite are a direct motivation for the present work .",

    "here @xmath4 are random hankel matrices @xmath5 are fixed low rank hankel matrices and increasing the sampling rate leads to increasing the dimension @xmath6 .",
    "we will return to this topic in example [ euu ] below .",
    "we also refer to @xcite for other matrix models of noise and information .",
    "all above mentioned papers have inspireded us to provide a general framework for a spectral analysis of low rank matrix polynomial @xmath7 $ ] perturbed by a random matrix polynomial @xmath8 $ ]",
    ". we will be interested in large @xmath6 asymptotic of the resolvent and the spectrum of @xmath9 .",
    "in addition to this , several studies have addressed the canonical forms of nonrandom structured matrices and matrix polynomials @xcite and their change under a low - rank perturbation , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "some of the results we obtain , especially those from section [ s3 ] , are similar to the first order perturbation theory , i.e. to the study of the eigenvalues of @xmath10 as functions of a scalar parameter @xmath11 , see e.g. @xcite . in",
    "what follows the polynomial @xmath12 is always a singular polynomial , while @xmath13 and @xmath9 are regular polynomials , which brings us close to the setting of @xcite .",
    "however , let us stress that in our paper the dependence on @xmath11 is replaced by dependence on @xmath14 . hence",
    ", the current paper is a bridge between the spectral theory of random matrices and the perturbation theory for nonrandom structured matrix polynomials .",
    "the necessary condition for techniques we are using is the knowledge of the limit in @xmath6 of the resolvent of the random polynomial @xmath15 . since the seminal work of wigner @xcite and marchenko and pastur @xcite , spectral theory of random matrices has attracted wide interest .",
    "however , only recently scientists have begun to investigate the limit of the resolvent of the random matrix ( @xcite ) .",
    "currently the only known example of a matrix polynomial for which the resolvent converges is @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is either a generalised wigner or a generalised marchenko - pastur matrix .",
    "namely , it is known that @xmath18 for any @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is some scalar function and @xmath21 belongs to some rectangle in the upper half - plane @xmath22 .",
    "note that in the formula above one controls both the convergence rate and the probability .",
    "we refer to definition [ defiso ] for a precise way of handling this issue .",
    "there are three main outcomes of the present paper :    * extension of the knowledge of limit laws for the resolvents by providing new limit laws for the resolvents of polynomials of type @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 where @xmath27 is a low rank and non - symmetric matrix and @xmath28 and @xmath29 are scalar polynomials ; * analysis of limits in @xmath6 of spectra of polynomials of the above type , with a special emphasis on investigating the convergence rates ; * providing a general framework for further extensions .",
    "in the future , employing results for non - symmetric matrices or structured matrix polynomials would be most desirable , see e.g. @xcite for applications in neural networks .",
    "however , the limit laws for the resolvent have not been discovered yet , see @xcite for a review .",
    "nonetheless , the general scheme we propose in section [ sm ] is perfectly suited for studying those as well .",
    "we present now the promised details of the application of our work in signal processing .",
    "[ euu ] let a finite real signal @xmath30 be given .",

    "may follow the way proposed in @xcite and construct pad approximants @xmath41 of the z - transform of the signal .",
    "it was observed in @xcite that the points @xmath40 are eigenvalues of the hankel pencil @xmath42 where @xmath43 indeed , @xmath44 however , in real life the pencil @xmath45 is not known .",
    "the accessible quantities are the eigenvalues @xmath46 of the pencil @xmath47 .",
    "the ( random ) pencil @xmath48 corresponds to the noise @xmath33 and constructed analogously .",
    "the task can be now expressed as estimating the impact of the random perturbation @xmath49 on the ( searched ) eigenvalues @xmath40 .",
    "current numerical simulations support the conjecture that @xmath50 for @xmath21 in a compact set not intersecting the unit circle , where @xmath51 is an orthonormal matrix such that @xmath52 is the @xmath53-th vector of the canonical basis . under this conjecture",
    "the pencil @xmath54 fits the setting of theorem [ thres ] , which allows us to localize the perturbed eigenvalues @xmath40 with high probability .",

    "the paper is organised as follows .",

    "although the low - rank perturbations of wigner matrices were considered in many papers , see e.g. @xcite , the novelty here lies in studying non - symmetric perturbations and obtaining precise convergence rates of the eigenvalues depending on the jordan structure of the matrix @xmath67 .",
    "in fact , we estimate the rate of this convergence by @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the size of the largest jordan block of @xmath67 .",
