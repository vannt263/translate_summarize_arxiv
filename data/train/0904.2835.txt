    "recently , hoava ( based on the pioneering work of @xcite has proposed @xcite a model for quantum gravity which is power - counting renormalizable and hence potentially ultra - violet ( uv ) complete .",
    "this model does not have the complete diffeomorphism invariance of general relativity , but the action has a fixed point in the infrared ( ir ) which is that of general relativity with a negative cosmological constant . in the uv , however , the theory flows to a different fixed point , a fixed point at which space and time scale differently and which has much better uv behavior of perturbation theory .",
    "since hoava s theory is modelled after a scalar field model studied by lifshitz @xcite in which the full lorentz symmetry also only emerges at an ir fixed point , the theory is now called hoava - lifshitz gravity .",
    "specific solutions of the simplest version of hoava - lifshitz gravity have recently been analyzed . in @xcite ,",
    "homogeneous vacuum solutions with gravitational waves were studied . in @xcite , cosmological solutions with matter were explored , and in @xcite , black hole solutions were analyzed , as pointed out in @xcite , the analogs of the friedmann equations in hoava - lifshitz gravity include a term which scales as dark radiation and contributes a negative term to the energy density .",
    "thus , it is possible in principle to obtain a nonsingular cosmological evolution with the big bang of standard and inflationary cosmology replaced by a bounce .    in @xcite",
    ", it was argued that the different ultraviolet behavior of the theory might provide an alternative to cosmological inflation for solving the problems of standard cosmology such as the horizon and flatness problems .",
    "specifically , the divergence of the speed of light in the far ultraviolet leads to the possibility of solving the horizon problem as proposed a while back in @xcite . in @xcite",
    "it was emphasized that if the wavelength of fluctuations penetrates the uv region , then the usual arguments for the origin of a scale - invariant spectrum of cosmological perturbations from an inflationary phase might break down , as suggested more generally in the context of the  trans - planckian problem \" for inflationary fluctuations @xcite .",
    "however , if hoava - lifshitz cosmology leads to a cosmological bounce , then it is not necessary to invoke a period of inflationary expansion to produce the observed spectrum of cosmological perturbations .",
    "the purpose of this note is to point out that hoava - lifshitz cosmology may provide a uv - complete realization of the  matter bounce \" scenario ( see @xcite for an introduction to this scenario ) , an alternative to cosmological inflation for explaining the origin of the observed structure in the universe .",
    "as realized in @xcite , perturbations which start out as quantum vacuum fluctuations and exit the hubble radius during a matter - dominated phase of contraction acquire a scale - invariant spectrum . given a non - singular bouncing background cosmology ,",
    "the fluctuations can be followed unambiguously through the bounce .",
    "if the energy density at which the bounce occurs is smaller than the planck scale , then the wavelength of the fluctuations which are being probed in today s observations are in the far ir ( they are a fraction of a @xmath0 ) .",
    "hence , the equations which describe these fluctuations are those of the ir fixed point of the theory , which is the einstein action in the case of hoava - lifshitz cosmology .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that , provided the duration of the bounce phase is short compared to the wavelength of the fluctuations being considered , then the spectrum of curvature fluctuations is not changed during the bounce .",
    "thus , a scale - invariant spectrum of curvature perturbations will persist in the post - bounce expanding phase .",
    "specific predictions of the matter bounce scenario include a specific form on the non - gaussianities as measured by the amplitude and shape of the bispectrum @xcite .",
    "in this note we give an overview of the hoava - lifshitz matter bounce cosmology , leaving details for future investigations .",
    "we begin with a space - time sketch depicting the relevant phases ( figure 1 ) .",
    "the vertical axis is time , with @xmath1 denoting the bounce time . in some early phase of contraction , the equation of state of matter",
    "is assumed to be dominated by non - relativistic pressure - less matter , in the same sense that our current expanding universe is . for times between @xmath2 and the bounce ,",
    "the equation of state can be different from that of pressure - less matter .",
    "the horizontal axis denotes co - moving spatial coordinates .",
    "vertical lines correspond to fixed co - moving wavelengths , the dashed line is the co - moving hubble radius @xmath3 .",
    "fluctuations which cross the hubble radius during the matter phase of contraction acquire a scale - invariant spectrum , those which cross later have a non - trivial spectral slope whose magnitude depends on the specific equation of state ( see e.g. @xcite ) .    the outline of this note is as follows .",
    "we first review the action of hoava - lifshitz gravity .",
    "next , we review the equations for cosmological solutions and study the possibility of obtaining a bouncing cosmology with a matter - dominated phase of contraction . in section 4",
    "we review the evolution of fluctuations in the contracting phase of the matter bounce scenario , and in section 5 we study how fluctuations pass through the bounce in hoava - lifshitz cosmology .",
    "we conclude with a discussion of some of the many open issues .     being the bounce time .",
    "the horizontal axis denotes co - moving distance .",
    "the curve with the label @xmath4 is the hubble radius @xmath3 - in co - moving coordinates , the vertical line labeled by @xmath5 denotes the co - moving wavelength of a fluctuation mode .",
    "this mode crosses the hubble radius in the contracting phase before the time @xmath6 , when the period of matter - domination ends . ]",
    "we begin with a brief review of hoava - lifshitz gravity the dynamical variables are the lapse and shift functions @xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively , and the spatial metric @xmath9 ( roman letters indicate spatial indices ) in terms of these fields , the full metric is ds^2 = - n^2 dt^2 + g_ij ( dx^i + n^i dt ) ( dx^j + n^j dt ) , where the indices of @xmath7 are raised and lowered using the spatial metric @xmath9 .",
    "the scaling symmetry of the coordinates in the simplest version of hoava - liftshitz gravity is ( we are following the notation of @xcite ) t l^3 t and x^i l x^i .",
    "the full action of this version of hoava - lifshitz gravity is s & = & dt d^3x n , where k_ij = ( - _ i n_j - _ j n_i ) , and @xmath10 is the cotton tensor c^ij = _ k ( r^j_i - r ^j_i ) . the tensor @xmath11 is the totally antisymmetric unit tensor , @xmath12 is a dimensionless constant and @xmath13 is related to the cosmological constant in the ir limit .",
    "the variables @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are constants with mass dimensions @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively .    in the ir limit",
    ", the action reduces to s_e = dt d^3x n , with & = & + & = & and + & = & - 3 ^2 . in order to obtain the einstein action , we require @xmath20 . in this case , the variables of the hoava - lifshitz action go over into the following expressions for the speed of light @xmath21 , newton s gravitational constant @xmath22 and the effective cosmological constant @xmath23 : c & = & , + 16 g & = & , + _ e & = & - , in the following we will consider scalar field matter in the contracting phase . the action for matter is s_m = dt d^3x n _ m , where the matter lagrangian @xmath24 depends on the scalar matter field @xmath25 and the metric . in the ir limit",
    ", this action reduces to the usual scalar field matter action in curved space - time .",
    "the form of the scalar field lagrangian valid also in the uv is given in @xcite but will not be used in this note .",
    "to obtain the equations for hoava - lifshitz cosmology we assume that the metric is homogeneous and isotropic , i.e. n = n(t ) , n_i = 0 and g_ij = a^2(t ) _ ij , where @xmath26 is a maximally symmetric constant curvature metric .",
    "we will denote the spatial curvature parameter by @xmath27 .",
    "the equations of motion are obtained by varying the action with respect to @xmath7 , @xmath28 , and @xmath25 , and setting @xmath29 at the end of the calculation .",
    "the resulting equations are h^2 & = & - - - + , [ heq ] + & = & - - + + , [ acceq ] and + 3 h + v^ = 0 , [ mattereq ] where @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the pressure and energy density of the scalar matter field , respectively , a prime denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath25 , the dimensionless constant @xmath33 = is the coefficient of the @xmath34 term in the gravitational action , and the dimensionless constant @xmath35 is given by = - .",
    "the key new term in the cosmological equations of motion is the second to last term on the right - hand sides of ( [ heq ] ) and ( [ acceq ] ) .",
    "this term corresponds to  dark radiation \" with a negative energy density .",
    "this term is present only if the spatial curvature of the metric is non - vanishing .",
    "if the energy density of regular matter increases less fast than @xmath36 as the scale factor decreases , the dynamics will lead to a cosmological bounce provided that [ cond ] ( - p ) > 0 .    to obtain a bounce in hoava - lifshitz cosmology we will assume that matter in the pre - bounce epoch is described by a scalar field @xmath25 with a potential v ( ) = m^2 ^2 .",
    "as studied in detail in quintom bounce @xcite scenarios , we take the scalar field to be oscillating during the contracting phase , with an amplitude @xmath37 .    as the universe contracts , the amplitude @xmath38 will increase . once the amplitude reaches the value _ crit = ( 12 ) ^-1/2 m_pl , where @xmath39 is the planck mass , then the field oscillations will stop and @xmath25 will enter a  slow climb \" phase , the time reversal of the inflationary slow - roll phase . during this phase , the matter energy density is approximately constant but the scale factor is rapidly decreasing . hence , the dark radiation term in the hubble equation rapidly catches up with the matter energy term . since in the slow climb phase the pressure of matter is negative , the condition ( [ cond ] ) is satisfied .",
    "thus , we obtain a cosmological bounce .",
    "note that the  slow climb \" phase is unstable with respect to the presence of the second mode in the scalar field equation of motion , a mode which is exponentially decaying in an inflationary slow - roll phase and thus ensures that the slow - roll trajectory in large - field inflation is a local attractor @xcite . in the  slow climb \" phase , the second mode is increasing .",
    "the  slow climb \" trajectory is a repeller .",
    "however , coming out of the oscillatory phase , the initial amplitude of the unstable mode is sufficiently small such that the instability does not have time to develop before the bounce takes place .",
    "in the following we assume that the contracting phase before the bounce was first dominated by cold matter , matter with an equation of state @xmath40 , where @xmath15 is the ratio of pressure @xmath31 divided by energy density @xmath32 .",
    "we will now review how an initial vacuum spectrum of cosmological perturbations on sub - hubble scales in the contracting phase develops into a scale - invariant spectrum for wavelengths which exit the hubble radius in the matter - dominated phase .    as has proven to be convenient in inflationary cosmology , we track the cosmological fluctuations in terms of the variable @xmath41 , the curvature fluctuations in co - moving coordinates @xcite .",
    "this variable is conserved at phase transitions and is constant on super - hubble scales in an expanding universe .",
    "if we work in longitudinal gauge in which the metric in the absence of anisotropic stress takes the form ds^2 = a^2 ( ) , where @xmath33 is conformal time , @xmath42 are co - moving spatial coordinates ) and @xmath43 describes the metric fluctuations , then @xmath41 is given by ( modulo terms which are suppressed on super - hubble scales ) = ( ^ + ) + , @xmath44 denoting the hubble expansion rate in conformal time and a prime indicating the derivative with respect of @xmath33 .",
    "the variable @xmath41 is closely related to the variable @xmath45 ( see @xcite for an in depth review of the theory of cosmological fluctuations and @xcite for an introductory overview ) in terms of which the action for cosmological fluctuations has canonical kinetic term : [ zeta ] r = where @xmath46 is a function of the background which is proportional to the scale factor @xmath28 as long as the equation of state of matter in constant .",
    "the equation of motion for the fourier mode @xmath47 of @xmath45 is v_k^  + ( k^2 - ) v_k = 0 .",
    "this shows that on length scales larger than the hubble radius , where the @xmath48 term is negligible , @xmath45 does not oscillate , its time evolution being determined by the the gravitational background , whereas on sub - hubble scales @xmath47 is oscillating with approximately constant amplitude .    on super - hubble scales , the equation of motion for @xmath47 in a universe which is undergoing matter - dominated contraction is v^_k = 2 ^-2 v_k , which has the general solution v_k ( ) = c_1 ^-1 + c_2 ^2 , where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are constants .",
    "since for a matter dominated phase a ( ) ~ ^2 it follows that the @xmath50 mode is the mode for which @xmath41 is constant on super - hubble scales , whereas for the @xmath49 mode @xmath41 scales as @xmath51 , which is decaying in an expanding universe but growing in a contracting phase .",
    "it is this growth which is responsible for turning an initial vacuum spectrum of fluctuations into a scale - invariant one .    to see this ,",
    "let us compute the power spectrum of @xmath41 on super - hubble scales late in the contracting phase : p_r(k , ) & ~ & k^3    & ~ & k^3 |v_k(_h(k))|^2 ( ) ^2 ~ k^3 - 1 - 2 + & ~ & const . in this first step",
    ", we have used the definition of the power spectrum , replaced @xmath41 by @xmath45 via ( [ zeta ] ) and used the scaling @xmath52 . in the second step",
    ", we made use of the growth of the @xmath49 mode , the dominant mode , to relate the value of @xmath45 at late times to its value at the time @xmath53 when the mode @xmath5 crosses the hubble radius . finally , in the last step we insert the vacuum spectrum for @xmath45 on sub - hubble scales and the hubble radius crossing condition @xmath54 .",
    "if the bounce phase is short compared to the wavelength of the fluctuations which are being followed , then the spectrum of @xmath41 is unchanged through the bounce .",
    "this result can be obtained by explicitly evolving fluctuations through a non - singular bounce using the equations of motion for fluctuations which follow from einstein s theory ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this result also agrees with what is obtained by replacing the bounce phase by a matching surface and making use of the hwang - vishniac @xcite ( durrer - mukhanov @xcite ) matching conditions .",
    "if the energy density at the bounce is of the order of @xmath55 , the wavelength of a mode which corresponds to the current hubble radius is about @xmath56 , i.e. in the far ir .",
    "since in the hoava - lifshitz bounce , the bounce time is set by the uv scale , it is well justified to assume that in the context of the use of the einstein equations for the gravitational fluctuations the spectrum of @xmath41 does not change across the bounce .",
    "in addition , again since the scales we are interested in are in the far ir , it should be justified to use the ir limit of hoava - lifshitz cosmology to propagate the fluctuations    thus , we argue that the scale - invariance of the spectrum of cosmological perturbations will be scale - invariant after the bounce . since @xmath41 is constant on super - hubble scales in the post - bounce expanding phase , it then immediately follows that the spectrum of fluctuations at late times will be scale - invariant .",
    "a bouncing cosmology in the context of hoava - lifshitz gravity can thus provide an alternative to inflation for providing a scale - invariant spectrum of cosmological perturbations , provided that we begin in the contracting phase with quantum vacuum fluctuations and provided that the relevant scales exit the hubble radius in a period of cold matter domination ( the case of initial thermal fluctuations in analyzed in @xcite ) .",
    "since the curvature perturbation @xmath41 grows on super - hubble scales , a matter bounce leads to a larger amplitude of non - gaussianities than slow - roll single - field inflation .",
    "since it is a different mode of @xmath41 which dominates , the shape of the non - gaussianities is also different from what is obtained in slow - roll single - field inflation models .",
    "the specific predictions for the amplitude and shape of the three - point function ( the  bispectrum \" ) were worked out in @xcite . in particular , the predicted amplitude of the bispectrum is very close to the level which could be detected using the planck satellite experiment .",
    "in this paper we have shown how to obtain a  matter bounce \" if hoava - lifshitz gravity .",
    "such a bounce is obtained because of a ",
    "dark radiation \" term which appears in the equations of motion for cosmological solutions , a term which stems from the terms in the quantum gravity theory which appear in the uv and help render the theory renormalizable .",
    "note , however , that the presence of the dark radiation term requires non - vanishing spatial curvature .    to obtain a cosmological bounce",
    "it is important that no source of matter is present which redshifts equally fast or faster than that of the dark radiation term . only in this case",
    "the energy density of dark radiation can grown with respect to the regular matter energy , a condition which is required to obtain a bounce .",
    "this condition appears to be rather restrictive since it even rules out regular radiation before the bounce .",
    "we have presented a model in which a bounce can be obtained . in this model ,",
    "matter is modeled by a scalar field with a standard mass term .",
    "the scalar field oscillates at early times in the contracting phase , leading to a matter equation of state which is that of cold matter .",
    "once the amplitude of scalar field oscillations reaches a critical value , the field enters a deflationary slow - climb phase during which its energy density is approximately constant and its pressure is negative .",
    "hence , a bounce occurs .    in the matter bounce model",
    "thus constructed , initial quantum vacuum fluctuations which exit the hubble radius in the contracting matter - dominated phase acquire a scale - invariant spectrum of curvature fluctuations , as already envisioned in @xcite and recently studied in detail in @xcite .",
    "thus , one of the main messages of this note is that it is not necessary to force a period of inflationary expansion into hoava - lifshitz cosmology .",
    "the alternative matter bounce scenario predicts an amplitude of the normalized bi - spectrum is the order of @xmath19 , and a specific shape of this three - point function , as studied in detail in @xcite .",
    "these specific predictions are potentially within the reach of upcoming cmb missions such as planck .    to obtain a successful late - time cosmology ,",
    "the model presented here must be supplemented with a mechanism to transfer the energy at late times to standard model matter and radiation .",
    "if we include such matter in the basic lagrangian , then an initial condition problem arises : in order for a bounce to occur , the initial energy density of radiation must be so low that the radiation never comes to dominate during the contracting phase .",
    "all of these issues deserve further study .",
    "while this note was being prepared for submission , a very interesting paper by mukohyama @xcite appeared showing that in the uv region , fluctuations of a scalar field in hoava - lifshitz gravity acquire a scale - invariant spectrum , a spectrum which can be later transformed to curvature fluctuations via a transfer from entropy to adiabatic modes such as the curvaton mechanism .",
    "thus , one can obtain a scale - invariant spectrum of cosmological fluctuations .",
    "an advantage of this mechanism is that it also operates in a background cosmology without a bounce ( e.g. in the case of zero spatial curvature ) .",
    "however , in the case of a matter bounce background , it is unclear whether the scaling of the correlation functions used in @xcite would extend to the large ir scales required to match with observations , the scales on which our mechanism works nicely .    the author wishes to thank g. calcagni , p. hoava and s. mukohyama for comments on the draft of this note .",
    "this work is supported by an nserc discovery grant and by the canada research chairs program .",
    "the author wishes to acknowledge the hospitality of the institute of high energy physics in beijing , where a lot of the initial work on the matter bounce scenario was developed , and of the cern theory division , where the ideas presented here were worked out .",
