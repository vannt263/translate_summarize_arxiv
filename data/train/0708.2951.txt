    "recently , the report of the top - quark mass measurements from the cdf and d0 experiments at fermilab , presents the preliminary world average mass of the top quark is @xmath9 , which corresponds to a @xmath10 precision improvement relative to the previous combination@xcite . due to",
    "the huge top - quark mass being much heavier than the @xmath11-boson , before the top - quark hadronization it undergoes dominantly the weak decay via @xmath12@xcite , that has two important consequences different with other quarks , the narrow resonance around the energy @xmath13 is absent and the perturbative qcd is reliable to study all the threshold region .",
    "we believe the large top mass value will open up new vistas of electroweak physics and possibilities for probing the effects beyond the @xmath2 . for example , since the higgs mechanism in the @xmath2 and other extended models predicts that the strength of quark - higgs yukawa coupling is proportional to the quark mass@xcite , one can measure top - quark yukawa couplings in high precision to probe the @xmath2 or discover new physics .",
    "there have been many works concerning the study of the top - quark physics at colliders @xcite .",
    "all those indicate that the precise study of the top physics is accessible . in the proposed and planned experiments , such as at the cern lhc and the ilc ,",
    "more interests are focused on the developing and understanding top physics and top characteristics .",
    "the future @xmath14 linear collider(lc ) not only can be designed to operate in @xmath15 collision mode , but also can be operated as a @xmath16 collider .",
    "this is achieved by using compton backscattered photons in the scattering of intense laser photons on the initial @xmath15 beams .",
    "the top - quark pair production at photon - photon collider is also useful for top - quark physics study .",
    "it has been found that the @xmath17 production rate with high @xmath16 colliding energy , is much larger than that from the direct @xmath18 production due to the s - channel suppression of later process @xcite .    at the future international @xmath15 linear collider ( ilc ) , the colliding center - of - mass - system ( c.m.s . )",
    "energy can be raised up to @xmath7 . at @xmath19",
    "scale high colliding energy , the final states will be very complex and expected to be in multi - particles or jets with large production rates , and top and higgs signatures naturally are included in these processes .",
    "for these processes with large cross sections , a leading order analysis is not adequate to make detailed predictions for their cross sections .",
    "in fact , the processes with multiple final particles are particularly interesting , since such processes often proceed through one or more resonances that subsequently decay , or they represent an irreducible background to such resonance processes .",
    "for example , the associated production @xmath20 is an important process in probing top - higgs yukawa coupling in high precision , and was already studied in ref.@xcite .",
    "but after higgs boson and top - quark decay , the @xmath21 associated production process at @xmath16 collider would have the same final states ( @xmath22 ) as the process @xmath8 .",
    "therefore , it is important to emphasize that the ability to distinguish top , higgs boson or other new particle signatures at linear colliders , crucially depends on the understanding of the corresponding backgrounds of the corresponding processes with multi - particle final states . in order to exert all the abilities of future colliders , precise theoretical predictions including higher order corrections to multi - particle production processes are necessary .    in previous work",
    ", people used `` double - pole approximation '' ( dpa ) @xcite to handle the evaluations of complete one - loop strong and electroweak calculation for process including four particle final states .",
    "recently , the methods for the calculation of scalar and the tensor 6-point integral functions were provided@xcite . with the approach provided in ref.@xcite , the complete electroweak corrections to the @xmath23 processes , which are relevant for w - pair production , was presented by a. denner , s. dittmaier , m. roth , l.h .",
    "wieders , and the results were compared with those in ref.@xcite by using dpa method .    in this paper",
    "we present the calculations of the cross sections of the process @xmath8 at the leading - order(lo ) ( @xmath24 ) and qcd next - to - leading - order(nlo ) ( @xmath25 ) . the paper is organized as follow :",
    "the tree - level analytical calculation of the cross section for the process @xmath8 is given in section ii .",
    "in section iii the analytical calculation of the nlo qcd corrections is presented .",
    "the numerical results and discussions are given in section iv .",
    "finally , a short summary is given in section v.",
    "the process @xmath8 can be induced via @xmath27 and @xmath28channel at the tree - level . in this section",
    "we consider the tree - level@xmath29 contribution to the cross section for the process @xmath8 .",
    "we denote the process as @xmath30 where the four - momenta of incoming photons are denoted as @xmath31 and @xmath32 , and @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 represent the four - momenta of the final particles .",
    "the feynarts3.2 package@xcite is adopted to generate tree - level feynman diagrams and convert them to corresponding amplitudes .",
    "we present the t - channel tree - level feynman diagrams involving strong interaction for the process @xmath8 in fig.1 .",
    "the u - channel diagrams , which can be obtained by exchanging initial photons of the corresponding t - channel ones , are not drawn there .",
    "the tree - level amplitude @xmath37 of the process @xmath8 at the @xmath38 order , is then expressed as below . @xmath39 where the amplitudes ( @xmath40 ) correspond to the diagrams in fig.[fig1](1 - 10 ) respectively .",
    "then we get the differential cross section for the process @xmath8 at the tree - level as @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the four - body phase space element .",
    "the summation is taken over the spins and colors of final states , and the bar over the summation in eq.([sig ] ) recalls averaging over initial spin states .",
    "the calculation of the amplitudes of tree - level diagrams for @xmath8 process is implemented by using formcalc4.1 package@xcite .",
    "the integration program of the four - body phase space is based on the formcalc4.1 package , and created by using the factorization expression of four - body phase space element@xcite , @xmath43 where @xmath44 and the actual integration of three - body phase space element @xmath45 is parameterized using 2to3.f program in formcalc4.1 package@xcite , and the complete integration over the four - body phase space is performed using monte carlo integrator vegas .",
    "the two - body phase space @xmath46 is given as @xmath47 where the kinematical function @xmath48 is defined by @xmath49    in order to check our four - body phase space integration program , we calculated the lo cross section of @xmath50 process by adopting fixed - width method and the same input parameters as used in ref.@xcite . in table",
    "[ tab1 ] we list the the lo cross sections obtained from ref.@xcite , by using grace2.2.0 system@xcite , and by adopting our 4-body phase space integration program together with feynarts3.2 and formcalc4.1 , respectively .",
    "it demonstrates the numerical integration results by using our created program are in good agreement with others .",
    ".[tab1 ] the comparison of the numerical results of the lo cross section for @xmath51 process by using grace2.2.0 system and our integration program with those presented in ref.@xcite . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the renormalization scale dependence of both the lo and nlo qcd corrected total cross sections for the process @xmath8 with @xmath52 , is plotted in fig.[fig4 ] . in this figure",
    "the scale is parameterized as @xmath53 and the full - line and dashed - line correspond to the lo and the nlo qcd corrected cross sections , respectively .",
    "we can see from the figure that in the region @xmath54 the nlo qcd correction obviously improves the independence of the renormalization scale @xmath3 .",
    "therefore , we can conclude that the uncertainty of the cross section for process @xmath8 due to the variation of renormalization scale @xmath3 , can be reduced by considering the nlo qcd corrections .",
    "the lo and nlo qcd corrected cross sections for the @xmath8 process as the functions of renormalization scale @xmath55 . ]    the distributions of the transverse momenta of top- and bottom - quark(@xmath56 and @xmath57 ) with the colliding energy @xmath52 , are depicted in fig.[fig5](a ) and fig.[fig5](b ) separately . in fig.[fig5](a ) , we can see that the nlo qcd correction obviously enhances the differential cross section predicted in the @xmath2 at tree - level when the @xmath56 value is less than @xmath58 .",
    "our analysis shows that in the region @xmath59 , the large correction to the distribution of @xmath56 comes mainly from the contribution of the hard gluon emission process .",
    "but when @xmath60 , the correction to the distribution of @xmath56 from the hard gluon emission process , is largely cancelled by the negative correction from virtual gluon and soft gluon emission contributions , then the @xmath56 distribution corrections become to be much smaller .",
    "that means the absolute correction ( @xmath61 ) is enhanced at low @xmath56 and reduced at large @xmath56 due to the momentum balance between top particles and gluons radiated from top quarks at the nlo , which reduces the momenta of the top quarks .",
    "for b - quark , we can see from fig.[fig5](b ) that the large enhancement of the qcd corrected differential cross section(@xmath62 ) , which can nearly double the lo differential cross section somewhere , can be appeared in the @xmath57 value range between @xmath63 and @xmath64 , while in the range of @xmath65 the nlo qcd correction becomes to be very small .",
    "similar with the discussion for the distribution of @xmath56 , that is also the consequence of the momentum balance between bottom particles and gluons radiated from bottom quarks at the nlo .",

    "in this paper we calculate the complete one - loop qcd corrections to the process @xmath8 at a photon - photon collider .",
    "we present the dependence of the nlo qcd correction of process @xmath8 on colliding energy @xmath66 in the @xmath2 , and find that nlo qcd correction can generally increase the lo cross section .",
    "it shows that in the @xmath16 colliding energy range of @xmath67 , the corresponding k - factor goes down from @xmath4 to @xmath5 .",
    "we find that the nlo qcd correction can obviously improve the independence of the cross section for process @xmath8 on the renormalization scale @xmath3 , and the nlo qcd correction also changes obviously the distributions of transverse momenta of the final top- and bottom - quark states .",
