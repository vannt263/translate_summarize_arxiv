    "the term `` auction '' refers to a mechanism of allocating single or multiple resources to one or more agents ( or bidders )  @xcite . in recent years ,",
    "computer scientists , rather than just economists , are interested in auctions .",
    "the increase in computing power and improved algorithms have paved the way for combinatorial auctions . here",
    "multiple items are for sale by the auctioneer and bidders can bid for a bundle of items ( also called packages ) . in a multi - agent system ( mas ) , we consider these bidders and the auctioneer as autonomous agents who act in a self - interested manner in their dealings with one another .",
    "similarly , even in mas dealing with resource allocation other than by auction , there are self - interested autonomous agents  .",
    "we study a framework where optimality is a desirable property but fairness is a required property .",
    "an excellent example of such a framework is a combinatorial auctioning system ( cas ) where the two most important issues pertaining to resource allocation are optimality and fairness . a cas is a kind of mas whereby the bidders can express preferences over combinations of items  @xcite .",
    "we assume in this paper that an agent s valuation of an item does not change based on other agents private information ( i.e. , some evidence which affects the valuation of an agent ) , that utilities are quasilinear ( i.e. , utility is linear in terms of money ) , and that there are no externalities ( i.e. , an agent that does not win an item neither cares which other agent wins it , nor worries about how much other agents pay for it )  @xcite .",
    "this is realistic , as seen for example in relation to the nigerian communications commission auction described below , where , `` the decision to charge bidders what they bid was accepted by bidders and observers as fair and transparent despite the difference in some of the payments for identical licenses . ''",
    "@xcite in such scenarios , each agent holds different preferences over the various possible allocations and hence concepts like individual rationality , fairness , optimality , efficiency , etc .",
    ", are important  .",
    "we introduce the concept of fairness in the auction mechanism .",
    "although the notion of fairness is of course well known in general , it does not seem to have been clearly defined with respect to auction processes in particular .",
    "we propose two types of fairness , namely _ basic fairness _ and _ extended fairness_. we explain basic fairness using the concept of equitable distribution along with the respective preferences .",
    "extended fairness is explained such that envy - freeness prevails in the allocation and the entire resource is allocated to the winning bidder .",
    "we introduce a _ fairness table _ consisting of fair values as perceived by bidders and auctioneer ; this is sealed at the start of the bidding process .",
    "we give emphasis to fairness , unlike the classical approach where revenue maximization is the only goal required in auctions . to achieve fairness",
    ", the proposed algorithm explains a novel payment scheme which is applied at the end of the bidding process , where we determine the final amount payable to the auctioneer by the winning bidder .",
    "we ensure that this process is considered to be fair by both bidders and the auctioneer by means of extended fairness .",
    "we handle the special case of a tie in the bidding process using equitable distribution , and ensure that basic fairness is achieved .",
    "the mathematical formulations of fairness concepts in combinatorial auctions are explained , and a detailed analysis is presented to highlight some of the properties exhibited by our payment scheme .    in our mechanism , there are self - interested bidders and an auctioneer , who express their perceptions of the fair value of the resources through a data structure called the fairness table .",
    "here an auctioneer acts as a facilitator to ensure that an item achieves its fair value .",
    "we consider optimality as the desired property and fairness as the required property .",
    "we illustrate this using a combinatorial auction framework , in which multiple items are simultaneously up for sale and a bidder can bid for any bundle of items .",
    "the optimal allocation of resources is discussed using an algorithm of sandholm where we obtain the winning bidders .",
    "the incentives to the winning bidders are provided through the generalized vickrey auction ( gva ) and algorithm  [ algorithm1 ] .",
    "we apply the fairness concept using the fairness table and algorithm  [ algorithm1 ] .",
    "the auctioning of the electromagnetic spectrum is one of the well - known applications of combinatorial auctions .",
    "the first - ever combinatorial auctioning of the radio spectrum was held in nigeria in 2002  @xcite . a single - round sealed - bid combinatorial auction ( not the simultaneous multiple round auctions ( smra ) used in other countries )",
    "was conducted for regional fixed wireless access ( fwa ) licenses ; the decision for this format was made as smra was impractical in nigeria due to its insufficient communication infrastructure , and as the ncc did not wish to have a lengthy auction . some 67 out of the 80 licenses available were allocated , with successful bids amounting to 3.78 billion naira ( 38 million us dollars ) . here",
    ", the complimentarity and substitutability of licenses were the important factors for choosing a combinatorial auction .",
    "the cost of the allocation process was an important factor , and the nigerian communications commission ( ncc ) did not want to discourage smaller bidders , with its primary goal being efficiency and transparency .",
    "we find in the case of the combinatorial auction conducted by ncc the following problem : `` the final choice of auction design rested heavily on information revealed about the regional structure of demand from initial applications .",
    "it was therefore critical that the application process created incentives for bidders to reveal such information . ''",
    "@xcite this problem is taken care of in our approach as we introduce the fairness table which is to be populated at the beginning of the auctioning process .",
    "this table allows us to see the regional structure of demands through the fair values assigned to the resources .",
    "we provide higher rewards for bidders who truthfully give their fair values , by theorems  [ thm1 ] and  [ thm2 ] .",
    "it was also observed by the ncc that bidders defaulted on their winning bids in a significant number of cases , though not enough to undermine the overall process  @xcite .",
    "we can decrease the number of bidders defaulting provided we satisfy theorem  [ thm2 ] .",
    "this makes it less rewarding for bidders to bid way beyond their capacity , which in turn decreses the possibility of winning bidders defaulting .",
    "since the importance here is on transparent and fair allocation , we can apply our method to ensure fairness in combinatorial auctions .",
    "we start with introducing some of the related work in section  [ related ] .",
    "next , we explain different notions of fairness with formal definitions in section  [ definitions ] .",
    "this is followed by our study of cas in section  [ faircas ] ; algorithm  [ algorithm1 ] in section  [ algo ] is used to extend the payment scheme to achieve fairness in cas with an example .",
    "section  [ analysis ] gives a detailed analysis of fairness using mechanism design under quasilinear settings  @xcite .",
    "we conclude with section  [ conclusion ] , which offers some conclusions about our efforts , and some suggestions for further work along these lines .",
    "in this section , we review different definitions of fairness as they have been proposed in the multi - agent literature .",
    "the problem of fair allocation is being resolved in various mas by using different procedures , depending upon the technique of allocation of goods and the nature of goods .",
    "its welfare implications in different systems were explored by rabin  @xcite .",
    "brams and taylor give an analysis of procedures for allocating divisible and indivisible items and for resolving disputes among the self - interested agents  @xcite .",
    "one of the procedures described by them is the `` divide and choose '' method of allocation of divisible goods among two agents to ensure the fair allocation of goods which also exhibits the property of `` envy - freeness , '' a property first introduced by foley  @xcite .",
    "lucas method of markers , and knaster s method of sealed bids are described for mas comprising more than two players and for the division of indivisible items .",
    "the adjusted - winner ( aw ) procedure is also defined by brams  @xcite for envy - freeness and equitability in two - agent systems .",
    "various other procedures like moving - knife procedures for cake cutting are defined for the mas comprising three or more agents  @xcite .",
    "the auction mechanism proposed by biggart  @xcite provides an economic sociology perspective .",
    "there , fairness can mean different things for bidders and auctioneer . the auctioneer may consider a process fair which in fact only gives him the maximum revenue , whereas the bidders may consider a process fair which only gives the auctioneer the least return on all items .",
    "the most important consideration overall is to sustain the community s faith in the fairness of the process .",
    "this does not mean that buyers and sellers can not press their advantage , but they are allowed to do so only insofar as the community as a whole considers their actions appropriate and acceptable .",
    "a concept of verifiable fairness in internet auctions has been proposed by liao and hwang  @xcite .",
    "this was to promote trust in internet auctions .",
    "the scheme proposed provides evidence regarding policies implemented so that the confidence of bidders increases and they consider it to be fair .",
    "most of these auctions see transparency in the auctioning process and rules as the basis for ensuring fairness in the system , but clarity regarding fairness still remains wanting .",
    "the nash bargaining concept is used by many economists . in nash",
    "bargaining , there is no particular winner against a bargain .",
    "if the amount requested is within the total amount available at the owner then they get their share , but if the demand is more then they get nothing . in our case",
    ", this is not the case as we have a winner in all circumstances even if the auctioneer is facing a loss .",
    "also the extended fairness concept is not present in nash bargaining to acquire a desired product whereas in our case bidders pay a price to achieve extended fairness .",
    "the game - theoretic concept of shapley value  @xcite describes the fairest allocation of collectively - gained profits between several collaborative agents .",
    "this is one approach used in coalitional games .",
    "though this deals with fair allocation , it is restricted to a mechanism where the actors contribute in a coalition .",
    "the profits obtained are allocated in a fair manner .",
    "the shapley value is different from our approach , as we do not take into account prior understanding or coalition among the bidding agents in our discussion .",
    "fairness as a collective measure has been considered by moulin  @xcite , who proposes aggregate or collective welfare which is measured in terms of an objective standard or index that assumes equivalence between this measure and a particular mix of economic and non - economic goods which gives happiness to a varying set of individual utility functions .",
    "this tries to capture social welfare and commonwealth to be incorporated into every individuals happiness equations .",
    "though debatable , it provides an excellent introduction to the concept of fairness .",
    "a distributed combinatorial auctioning system ( dcas ) consisting of auctioneers and bidders who communicate by message passing has been proposed  @xcite .",
    "their work uses a fair division algorithm that is based on dcas concept and model .",
    "it also discusses how basic and extended fairness implementations may be achieved in distributed resource allocation .",
    "the fair package assignment model proposed by lahaie and parkes  @xcite is defined on items having pure complements or super additive valuations .",
    "this model does not address combinatorial package assignments which involve both complements and substitutes in general .",
    "their model provides fairness to a `` core '' which contains a set of all distributions which are considered competitive ",
    "no fairness is posited for other distributions .",
    "hence the bidders whose distributions lie outside the core do not get the benefits of fair assessment . in the case of multiple - round combinatorial auctions , for example , bidders whose bids are not in the core during earlier rounds are not in contention in later ones . this scheme seems unfair in a fundamental way , as it effectively discriminates against bidders who can not make it into the core . in our model only truthfulness in bidding is considered , and no bidders are distinguished based on whether their bids lie inside or outside a putative core .",
    "however , the term _ fairness _ is defined differently in various mas with regard to the resource allocation . in some mas",
    ", it can be defined as equitable distribution of resources such that each recipient believes that he receives his fair share .",
    "thus , no agent wants somebody else s share more than its own share ; such division is therefore also known as envy - free division of resources  @xcite .",
    "thus fair allocation is achieved if it is efficient , envy - free and equitable  @xcite .",
    "our additional notions of fairness in various mas are basic fairness and extended fairness .",
    "this section defines the various notions about fairness in combinatorial auctions in a mas .",
    "let our cas be a mas which is defined by the following entities :    1 .   the total number of resources is represented by @xmath0 and the total number of bidders by @xmath1 .",
    "the set @xmath2 is a set of @xmath0 resources @xmath3 , and @xmath4 denotes the power set of @xmath5 .",
    "the set @xmath6 is a set of @xmath1 bidders @xmath7 .",
    "4 .   @xmath8 is the auctioneer who initially owns all the resources .",
    "a package @xmath9 is some subset of the set of resources , i.e. , @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath11 is the set of real numbers .",
    "for instance , consider a cas that comprises three bidders @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , an auctioneer denoted as @xmath8 , and three resources @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 .",
    "each bidder is privileged to bid upon any combination of these resources .",
    "we denote the combinations or subsets of these resources as \\{@xmath15 } , \\{@xmath16 } , \\{@xmath17 } , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 .    [ ex3 ]    a package for a bidder winning the subsets \\{@xmath15 } and \\{@xmath16 } is defined as @xmath22 .",
    "we also consider the concept of weight while assigning the fair value . here",
    ", weight is not the physical weight but is used as a multiplicative factor for describing the desirability of the package by the bidder .",
    "if a higher weight is assigned to a package , then it will result in a higher fair value .",
    "this expresses the well - known fact that a bidder is likely to assign a higher fair value to a resource that is desired or needed than to one that is not , even when the two resources have the same intrinsic value ( e.g. , a starving man is likely to assign a far higher value to a meal than to any other commodity of equivalent intrinsic worth ) .",
    "[ def3 ]    let us define some important terms used in our later discussion , as follows :    1 .",
    "the _ initial value _ of an item is defined as @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the initial amount attached by bidder @xmath25 to a resource @xmath26 .",
    "the _ weight _ a package is defined as @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the weight for bidder @xmath25 of package @xmath9 .",
    "the _ fair value _ for a resource is defined as @xmath29 , where @xmath30 for a bidder @xmath25 on resource @xmath26 .",
    "+ the fair value for a package is defined as @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the value obtained as @xmath33 .",
    "the _ bid value _ of a package is defined as @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the amount that the bidder @xmath25 is willing to give in exchange for the package @xmath9 .",
    "the _ utility value _ of a package is defined as @xmath36 , where @xmath37 .",
    "the _ package cost _ is defined as @xmath38 , where @xmath39 gives the final winning amount for bidder @xmath40 on package @xmath9 after the bidding has ended .",
    "assume that the auctioneer and each bidder all have fair values for each of the individual resources ( say , in dollars ) as shown in table  [ tab : fairtable ] .",
    "every bidding process will have a base value initially assigned to an item from where the bidding proceeds .",
    "the fair values by a bidder and an auctioneer for each resource represent their measures of its actual value , and depend on their weights and their initial values ( definition  [ def3 ] ) .",
    "thus , a bidder is willing to consider a resource at his fair value .",
    "similarly , the auctioneer is willing to sell a resource at _ his _ fair value .",
    "however , bid value may be higher or lower than fair value and hence result in higher or lower utility values ( definition  [ def3 ] ) depending on the need of the resource .",
    "fair value for a combination of resources in the fairness table can be calculated as the sum of the fair value for each of the resources in that combination ( fair values are considered additive where as the bid values are combinatorial in nature and not additive ) .",

    "this means that bidder @xmath12 is willing to pay $ 5 for @xmath15 , $ 8 for @xmath16 , and $ 8 also for @xmath17 ; @xmath12 believes that no loss is incurred by the auctioneer in this trade .",
    "the fair value for the subset @xmath41 for the bidder @xmath12 is calculated as the sum of his the fair values for @xmath15 and @xmath17 , i.e. , $ 5 + $ 8 = $ 13 .",

    "a bidder participates in the bidding process by quoting his bid for the packages .",
    "let the bids raised by the bidders for the individual resource and different combination of resources be as given in table @xmath42 .",
    "it can be seen that the bids raised by each of the bidder for different sets of resources may or may not be equal to the fair value of the respective set of resources .",

    ", there occurs a need of allocating the resources in an equitable manner , i.e. , each agent gets an equitable share of the resources .",
    "such allocations leave the agents with a feeling that they have received a fair share  @xcite .",
    "for example , if we consider a method that would leave two agents feeling as if they had received @xmath43% of the good then we would call it equitable .",
    "if one felt to be favored and had received @xmath44% while the other agent believed to have received @xmath43% then it would not be equitable  @xcite .",
    "this is quite difficult to access and tends to quite subjective in many cases .",
    "we give a mechanism where this applies only in case of a tie , hence we consider a divisible resource which does not lose its value upon division and divide it equitably among bidders in proportion to their assigned weights .",
    "each agent has a set of allocations he deems fair .",
    "an allocation is then is said to achieve basic fairness in resource allocation if all agents deem it fair .    each bidder @xmath40 wants to maximize his chances of procuring the resource and individual utility given by @xmath45 represents the satisfaction of obtaining the resource .",

    "we can represent the table [ tab : bidtable ] as a bid tree using an algorithm of sandholm  @xcite .",
    "we can also carry out some preprocessing steps to make the steps faster without compromising the optimality  @xcite .",
    "thus we can determine the winning bidders .",
    "however , besides optimality , another key issue desired by some auctioning systems is fairness . to incorporate this significant property in this resource allocation procedure",
    ", we propose an algorithm which uses the concept of extended fairness for each agent with basic fairness in case of a tie and determines the final payment made by the winning bidders .",
    "the algorithm that we describe is based upon a cas that uses an algorithm of sandholm for achieving optimality , and an incentive compatible mechanism called generalized vickrey auction ( gva ) along with algorithm [ algorithm1 ] as the pricing mechanism that determines the payments to be given by the winning bidders .",
    "the generalized vickrey auction ( gva ) has a payoff structure that is designed in a manner such that each winning agent gets a discount on its actual bid .",
    "this discount is called a vickrey discount , and is defined by  @xcite as the extent by which the total revenue to the seller is increased due to the presence of that winning bidder , i.e. , the marginal contribution of the winning bidder to the total revenue .",
    "the gva framework requires significant transfer payments from bidders to auctioneer hence a redistribution mechanism is required to reduce the cost of implementation  @xcite .",
    "hence , after we obtain winning bidders from the algorithm of sandholm , the gva mechanism can be applied to get package cost ( definition [ def3 ] ) and algorithm [ algorithm1 ] can be used for redistribution of payments back to the bidders to achieve fair allocation .",
    "we give mathematical formulations to show that both kinds of fairness can be achieved in cas .      1 .",

    "we consider these cases in our algorithm to provide basic fairness to the bidders . in case of a tie",
    ", we shall measure the utility value of the resource to each bidder in the tie .",
    "the utility value of a resource to a bidder is the quantified measure of satisfaction or happiness derived by the procurement of the resource ( definition  [ def3 ] ) .",
    "the bidders maximize this utility value to quantify the importance and their need for the resource .",
    "thus , the higher the utility value , the greater is the need for the package . in such a case",
    ", fairness can be achieved if the package @xmath9 is divided among all the bidders in a proportional manner , i.e. , in accordance to the utility value attached to the package by each bidder .",
    "[ ex5 ]    let us consider the same example to explain the concept of basic fairness in our system . from table  [ tab : bidtable",

    "thus , the utility value of the package @xmath9 for the bidder @xmath12 and @xmath13 is as follows :    for bidder @xmath12 , @xmath123 , and    for bidder @xmath13 , @xmath124 .    hence , the package @xmath9 is divided among bidders @xmath12 and @xmath13 , in the ratio of @xmath125 . in other words , bidder @xmath12 gets @xmath126% and bidder @xmath13 gets @xmath127% of the package @xmath84 .",

    "the bidders @xmath12 and @xmath13 make their respective payments in the ratio of @xmath125 to make up a total of $ @xmath120 for the auctioneer , i.e. , bidder @xmath12 pays $ @xmath128 and bidder @xmath13 pays $ @xmath129 to the auctioneer for their respective shares .",
    "hence , we see that extended fairness as well as basic fairness are achieved in a cas using our approach . we take into account the fair estimates of the auctioneer and the bidders for each resource to ensure that fairness is achieved to auctioneer as well as the bidders .",
    "a detailed analysis of our mechanism is in the following section .",
    "using the solution concept of dominant strategies and mechanism design with quasilinear preferences , we can analyze the following .",
    "we say that the agents preferences are quasilinear when they satisfy the conditions given below : first we are in a setting where the mechanism can choose to charge or reward an agent an arbitrary amount .",
    "second , and more restrictive , is that an agent s utility of a choice can not depend on the money that he has , i.e. , his value is the same whether he is rich or poor . finally , the agents care only about the choice selected and their own payments , i.e. , they are not concerned about monetary payments made or received by other agents .",
    "we say that extended fairness is achieved when a bidder procures a resource for an amount that is equal to his estimate of fair value of that resource .",
    "in such a case , the bidder believes that the resource was procured by it at a fair amount irrespective of other bidders estimate of fair value of that resource .",
    "this is according to the last condition of quasilinear preference .",
    "thus , the allocation is believed to be extendedly fair as per the estimates of the winning bidder .",
    "we also see that basic fairness is achieved in our system when there is more than one bidder who has raised equal bid for the same set of resources .",
    "in such a case , we divide the set of resources among all the bidders so as to ensure fairness to all the bidders in a tie .",
    "however , this division of resources set is done in a proportional manner .",
    "we intend to divide the resource such that the bidder holding highest utility value to it should get the biggest share . to ensure this",
    ", we calculate the utility value ( i.e. , @xmath130 of the set of resources to each bidder and divide the set in the ratio of these values among the respective bidders .",
    "thus , we see that each bidder procures his basic share of the set of resources in accordance to the basic importance attached by the bidder to the set of resources . due to the achievement of fairness through our payment scheme ,",
    "the bidders are expected to show willingness to participate in the auctions .      here",
    "we show that a bidder is encouraged to bid higher as he gets rewards proportional to his bids which are fair .",

    "he has to distribute @xmath159 which is greater than @xmath65 .",
    "therefore , the extra amount to be distributed would be added to @xmath83 and hence ends up paying higher amount without any rewards .",

    "let us denote the strategy choosen by @xmath40 .",
    "i.e. , @xmath170 to be @xmath171 which is a dominant strategy as per our assumption ( line 10 in algorithm [ algorithm1 ] and theorem [ thm2 ] ) .",
    "assume that the bidder @xmath40 would be better off declaring a fair value @xmath172 instead of @xmath167 to our mechanism .",
    "this implies that @xmath40 has chosen a different strategy @xmath173 instead of @xmath171 which is not in equilibrium , contradicting our assumption that @xmath171 is the dominant strategy for @xmath40 .",
    "this means that here the only action available to an agent is to reveal his private information .",
    "any solution to a mechanism design problem can be converted into one in which agents always reveal their true preferences , if the new mechanism `` lies for the agents '' in just the way they would have chosen to lie to the original mechanism .",
    "thus the new mechanism is dominant - strategy truthful  @xcite .    in our algorithm",
    "the bidder or auctioneer benefit only when they give their fair value truthfully as in cases where @xmath174 and @xmath175 , where he gets the incentives as profits are distributed .",
    "but if the fair value is not truthful then he risks going to the case @xmath176 and @xmath177 where naturally he is denied of any benefits . thus if he lies to the mechanism to gain profits he would not succeed as he would have chosen a strategy which leads to loss",
    "consider the efficiency with respect to the package won by the bidder @xmath40 denoted by @xmath84 .",
    "we define @xmath178 as a subset of resources which are not won by the bidder @xmath40 .",
    "consider the following definition by  @xcite .",
    "[ effdef ]    a quasilinear mechanism is _ strictly pareto efficient _ , or just _ efficient _ , if in equilibrium it selects a choice @xmath84 such that @xmath179    ( note that  @xcite uses @xmath180 for what we denote by @xmath84 . )    [ effthm ] in our mechanism , the bidder @xmath40 s equilibrium strategy is to select choice @xmath84 such that @xmath179 so it is efficient .",
    "assume a bidder @xmath25 has chosen a dominant strategy @xmath171 selects a choice @xmath84 such that @xmath181 .",
    "this implies that sum of fair values of items in selected package @xmath84 , is not more efficient than the sum of items not in package @xmath84 .",
    "thus there is another strategy @xmath173 which selects a choice @xmath178 which is more efficient than @xmath84(theorem [ thm1 ] ) .",
    "hence , @xmath171 was not in equilibrium as @xmath173 is the dominant strategy .",
    "this is a contradiction to our assumption that @xmath171 was the dominant strategy .",
    "an efficient mechanism selects the choice which maximizes the sum of the agents utilities , disregarding the the monetary payments they are required to pay .",
    "this can be shown in our algorithm concept where the choice is made on the agents fair values which helps in maximizing its profits .",
    "thus , the efficiency is defined in terms of the true fair values and not the declared value in the bid table ( table  [ tab : bidtable ] ) .",
    "the combinatorial auction can be made incentive compatible using the generalized vickrey auction ( gva ) and algorithm [ algorithm1 ] .",
    "the payment using gva can be explained by assuming that all agents follow their dominant strategies and declare their values truthfully .",
    "each agent is made to pay his social cost ; the aggregate impact that his participation has on other agents utilities  @xcite .",
    "the payment mechanism described in our system is incentive compatible , i.e. , they fare best when they reveal their private information truthfully in certain cases .",
    "as shown in theorem [ thm1 ] and theorem [ thm2 ] the bidders following dominant strategies in algorithm [ algorithm1 ] is bound to get higher incentives .",
    "thus the gva and algorithm [ algorithm1 ] enables our mechanism to be incentive compatible .",
    "optimality is a significant property that is desired in a cas .",
    "we ensure this property by the use of an algorithm of sandholm  @xcite in our system .",
    "it is used to obtain the optimum allocation of resources so as to maximize the revenue generated for the auctioneer .",
    "thus , the output obtained is the most optimal output and there is no other allocation that generates more revenues than the current allocation .",
    "we have shown that fairness can be incorporated in cas from our methodology .",
    "extended fairness as well as basic fairness can be attained through our payment mechanism .",
    "optimal allocation is obtained through an algorithm of sandholm , and the other significant properties like allocative efficiency and incentive compatibility are also achieved .",
    "this is an improvement because in the existing world of multi - agent systems , there do not seem to be many studies that attempt to incorporate optimality as well as fairness .",
    "the present paper addresses this lack in a specific multi - agent system , namely , the cas .",
    "the nigerian communications commission ( ncc ) faced problems in giving incentives to bidders who divulge their preferences and bidders were not keen on divulging it since it may lead to more adverse competition .",
    "our algorithm for extended fairness takes care of this problem as bidders receive more incentives with higher bids . since the preferences given by the bidders in the fairness table is confidential and sealed , they need not worry about their preferences being disclosed to competitors .",
    "the framework described can also be extended in several ways : first is to de - centralize the suggested algorithm , to avoid use of a single dedicated auctioneer . especially in distributed computing environments",
    ", it would be best for there to be a method to implement the suggested algorithm ( or something close to it ) without requiring an agent to act as a dedicated auctioneer  @xcite .",
    "a second important extension would be to find applications for the work .",
    "some applications that suggest themselves include distribution of land ( a matter of great concern for governments and people the world over ) in a fair manner . in land auctions where a tie occurs , no pre - defined or idiosyncratic method need be used to break the tie ; rather , the allocation can be done fairly in the manner suggested .",
    "a third important extension is to experiment with the grid computing framework  . the applicability of fairness scheme in grid computing while allocating resources and its impact on the expected revenue would be an interesting application area .",
    "fairness is also an important and pressing concern in the computing sciences and information technology , particularly , in distributed computing  @xcite .",
    "it is therefore also of interest to see how our method for achieving fairness could be applied in such contexts .",
