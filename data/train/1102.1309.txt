    "planetary nebulae ( pns ) are the descendants of asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars . according to the interacting stellar wind ( isw ) model @xcite ,",
    "an agb star loses most of its envelope mass with a slow stellar wind ( agb wind ) until the hot core is exposed . after reaching the pn nucleus stage ,",
    "a new faster wind ( post - agb wind ) sweeps up the circumstellar material originating in the slow wind and forms the high - density and ionized nebular shell .",
    "most pns are not spherical and exhibit complex shapes : round , elliptical , butterfly , bilobed , and irregular .",

    "* hereafter bss ) examined the morphology of nine pns with a center star ( cs ) whose proper motions exceeded 0.015 arcsec yr@xmath0 and found that seven of the examined pns interact with the ism .",
    "they also examined the morphology of large , nearby pns , and found that many were asymmetric .",
    "@xcite presented a ccd imaging atlas of large pns ( @xmath1 ) and found that 21 of 27 pns in their sample revealed significant interaction with the ism .",
    "using deep narrowband ccd images of the nine largest , nearby pns , @xcite found that eight pns in their sample revealed features indicating an interaction between the pns and the ism .",
    "more recently , @xcite presented mid - infrared images for five pns which appear to interact with the ism . using the data of the int photometric h@xmath2 survey ( iphas ) @xcite ,",
    "@xcite identified 21 objects as possible pns interacting with the ism .    on the theoretical side ,",
    "the first theoretical study of the interaction between pns and ism was made by @xcite . using a thin - shell approximation and simple analytic formulae",
    ", @xcite found that the motion of a pn through the ism would be expected to cause a shift of the cs toward the leading surface of the interacting pn and ism .",
    "bss used simple analytical estimates to study the interaction between a moving pn and the ism and found that the interaction produces asymmetries in the surface brightness of the pn . using a two - dimensional numerical hydrodynamic code , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter sbs ) simulated the interaction between the pn and the ism .",
    "they considered two limiting cases : adiabatic and isothermal models . in their adiabatic model , a pn moves with large relative velocity ( @xmath3 km s@xmath0 ) within the ambient ism with low density so that the cooling time is larger than the flow time .",
    "the adiabatic model is relevant for pns moving in the galactic halo . in the isothermal model , which is relevant for pns in the galactic disk , the pn moves through the high - density ism with moderate relative velocity @xmath4 km s@xmath0 and",
    "the cooling is very effective .",
    "the isothermal model of sbs validates the thin - shell approximation originally developed by @xcite .",
    "sbs also found that the simple analytic model breaks down in their adiabatic model in which a rayleigh - taylor ( rt ) instability develops , leading to shell fragmentation , while the isothermal model shows no sign of the rt instability .",
    "@xcite studied the interaction of a pn with a magnetized ism and showed that the ism magnetic field , which was not incorporated in the numerical simulations of sbs , can lead to the development of rt instability even in the isothermal environment .    according to the simple thin - shell model for the pns moving through the ism",
    ", the interaction between pns and ism can be divided into three phases @xcite .",
    "first , when the density of the young pn is much larger than that of the ambient ism , the pn will expand freely .",
    "second , when the pn density drops below a critical value , the ism pressure becomes comparable to the one in the pn shell and the upstream side of the pn shell will be compressed and the surface brightness in the interaction region will increase . when the density in the pn shell has dropped to a lower value , the shape of the pn shell will be significantly distorted and the cs of the pn will move close to the upstream edge . finally , the cs of the pn will move outside of the pn shell , and the pn shell will be stripped and mixed with the ism .    in the pn - ism interaction models of bss and sbs",
    ", they have assumed that the pn shell has formed before the interaction with the ism and the interaction only be observable during the late stage of the pn evolution .",
    "moreover , high ism density , large relative velocity , or both explain the observed asymmetry in the external shell of a pn . @xcite performed two - dimensional numerical simulations of the evolution of an agb star moving through its surrounding ism .",
    "they found that during the early stage of the evolution of an agb star , the slow agb wind can interact with the ism .",
    "the pn forms later when the fast post - agb wind sweeps up the stellar material in the slow agb wind .",
    "a spherical innermost shell shaped by the fast post - agb wind and an external shell with a bow shock character can form . in simulations",
    "@xcite adopted two low ism densities and a very conservative relative velocity of the pn , 20 km s@xmath0 .",
    "thus , high ism density , large relative velocity , and a magnetic field are not necessary to explain the observed asymmetries in the external shells of pns .",
    "moreover , interaction can occur even during early agb evolution , which is in agreement with the observed common asymmetries relating to the interaction with ism in most of the halos of pns , not just in those of old pns .    considering a wide range of pn velocities , mass - loss rates of the cs and ism densities , (",
    "* hereafter wzo ) performed three - dimensional hydrodynamic simulations , from the beginning of the slow agb wind phase to the end of the post - agb / pn phase .",
    "they developed a `` triple - wind '' model including a slow agb wind , a fast post - agb wind , and a third wind reflecting the movement through the ism .",
    "wzo found that the ism interaction strongly affects the outer structures of pns .",
    "the pn - ism interaction process can be divided into four stages ( wzo 1  4 ) . in the first stage ( wzo 1 ) , the pn expands freely within the bubble of the undisturbed slow agb wind material and is unaffected by the agb wind - ism interaction . in the second stage ( wzo 2 ) , the pns interact with the bow shock formed during the agb wind - ism interaction process , and the density and the emission in the upstream side increase accordingly . the third stage ( wzo 3 )",
    "is defined by the geometric center of the pn moving downstream away from the cs . in the fourth and final stage ( wzo 4 ) ,",
    "the pn is completely disrupted and the cs is outside the pn .",
    "the relative velocity of the pn and the ism density are important parameters for us to consider in order to model and understand the pn - ism interaction processes .",
    "both of these parameters are relevant to the galactic orbits of pns .",
    "the orbital parameters can also be used to distinguish different populations in the galaxy @xcite , but the available orbital parameters for pns in the galaxy are very rare .",
    "@xcite calculated the orbit of pg @xmath5 and found that this pn is in an advanced stage of interaction with the ism .",
    "@xcite calculated the orbits of four pns and confirmed that the motion of the pn shell through the ism is the origin of the pn - ism interaction process . in this research , using improved observation data , we calculated the galactic orbits for eight nearby pns , which doubles the number of pns whose orbits are available . using the derived orbital parameters of those pns , we also discuss the pn - ism interaction processes in our sample in detail .",
    "we present the derived galactic orbits of our pn sample in section 2 . in section 3 , for each pn in our sample , using the derived kinematical data , we discuss the interaction between the pn and the ism .",

    "can be underestimates .",

    "the derived errors in @xcite are 2  3 times smaller than those in @xcite .",

    "the other one is the  triple - wind \" model presented by wzo . in their model , the slow agb wind formed in the early evolution phase of the agb star interacts with the ism , and then the pn interacts with the bow shock formed during the agb wind - ism interaction .",

    "compared with the observed electron densities of other pns which have evolved into their later stages , the derived electron densities of these two pns are reasonable . for the above four pns ,",
    "the models of bss and sbs yield consistent results from the model of @xcite , but for sh 2 - 216 and a21 , the derived local densities of ism in the vicinity of these two pns with the models of bss and sbs are larger than those derived from the model of @xcite .",
    "for sh 2 - 216 , considering a magnetic field in the position of this pn in the models of bss and sbs can explain the observed pn - ism interaction .",

    "<S> we present and analyze the orbits of eight nearby planetary nebulae ( pns ) using two different galactic models . </S>",
    "<S> the errors of the derived orbital parameters are determined with a monte carlo method . </S>",
    "<S> based on the derived orbital parameters , we find that sh 2 - 216 , deht 5 , ngc 7293 , a21 , and ton 320 belong to the thin - disk population , and pg 1034 + 001 and a31 belong to the thick - disk population . </S>",
    "<S> puwe 1 probably belongs to the thick - disk population , but its population classification is very uncertain due to the large errors of its derived orbital parameters . </S>",
    "<S> the pn - ism interactions are observed for the eight pns in our sample . </S>",
    "<S> the position angles of the proper motions of the pns are consistent with the directions of the pn - ism interaction regions . </S>",
    "<S> the kinematic ages of pns are much smaller than the time for them to cross the galactic plane . using the models of borkowski et al . and soker et al . </S>",
    "<S> , the pn - ism interaction can be used to derive the local density of ism in the vicinity of evolved pns . according to the three - dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of wareing et al . </S>",
    "<S> ( wzo ) , sh 2 - 216 , a21 , and ton 320 are in the wzo 3 stage , pg 1034 + 001 and ngc 7293 are in the wzo 1 stage , and puwe 1 is in the wzo 2 stage . </S>"
