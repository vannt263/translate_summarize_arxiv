    "informally , every vertex of @xmath0 is _ represented _ by one or more vertices in @xmath1 such that the following holds : whenever two nodes @xmath2 and @xmath3 are adjacent in  @xmath0 , any node representing @xmath2 in @xmath1 has _ at least one _ ( in case of an emulator ) or _",

    "conversely , no node representing @xmath2 in @xmath1 has a neighbor representing @xmath3 if @xmath4 are nonadjacent in  @xmath0 .",
    "coarsely speaking , the mutually similar concepts of planar covers and planar emulators both `` preserve '' the local structure of a graph @xmath0 while `` gaining '' planarity for it .",
    "of course , the central question is which nonplanar graphs do have planar covers or emulators .",

    "the class of planar - coverable graphs is relatively well understood .",
    "at least , we have the following :    [ conj : negami ] a graph has a ( finite ) planar cover if and only if it embeds in the projective plane .",
    "yet , this natural ( see below ) and firmly believed conjecture is still open today despite of more than 20 years of intensive research .",
    "see @xcite for a recent survey .    on the other hand , it was no less natural to assume @xcite that the property of being planar - emulable coincides with planar - coverability . by definition ,",
    "the latter immediately implies the former . for the other direction",
    ", it was highly counterintuitive to assume that , having more than one neighbors in @xmath1 representing the same adjacent vertex of @xmath0 , could ever help to gain planarity of  @xmath1such `` additional '' edges seem to go against euler s bound on the number of edges of a planar graph .",
    "hence , it was widely believed :    [ conj : fellows ] a graph has a ( finite ) planar emulator if and only if it embeds in the projective plane .    perhaps due to similarity to covers , no significant effort to specifically study planar - emulable graphs occurred during the next 20 years after fellows manuscript  @xcite .    today",
    ", however , we know of one important difference between the two cases : conjecture  [ conj : fellows ] is false ! in 2008 , rieck and yamashita  @xcite proved the truly unexpected breakthrough result that there are graphs which have planar emulators , but no planar covers and do not embed in the projective plane ; see theorem  [ thm : rieck ] .",
    "this finding naturally ignited a new research direction , on which we report herein .",
    "we show that the class of planar - emulable graphs is , in fact , _ much larger _ than the class of planar - coverable ones ; that the concept of projective embeddability seems very out - of - place in the context of planar emulators ; and generally , how poorly planar emulators are yet understood .",
    "apart from its pure graph theoretic appeal , research regarding planar emulators and covers may in fact have algorithmic consequences as well : while negami s main interest @xcite was of pure graph theoretic nature , fellows ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and personal communication ) considered computing motivation for emulators .",
    "additionally , we would like to sketch another potential algorithmic connection ; there are problems that are np - hard for general graphs , but polynomial - time solvable for planar graphs ( e.g. , maximum cut ) , or where the polynomial complexity drops when considering planar graphs ( e.g. , maximum flow ) . yet , the precise breaking point is usually not well understood .",
    "considering such problems for planar - emulable or planar - coverable graphs may give more insight into the problems intrinsic complexities .",
    "before this can be investigated , however , these classes first have to be reasonably well understood themselves .",
    "our paper aims at improving upon this latter aspect of planar emulators .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : section  [ sec : emulators ] discusses all the major prior findings w.r.t .",

    "we would particularly like to mention a very small and nicely - structured emulator of the notoriously difficult graph @xmath6 in  [ fig : k1222emul ] .",

    "consider a cube ; it has 8 corners , 12 ridges ( we avoid the term _ edge _ here ) , and 6 facets . interpreting the corners , ridges , and facets of any convex polyhedron as the vertices , edges , and faces gives a planar graph ; geometrically , we obtain a plane drawing of the cube graph by choosing a perspective projection from a point close to one of the cube facets",
    ".    then we may truncate ( `` cut '' ) each of the eight corners of the cube ( geometrically , to obtain a _ truncated hexahedron _ , an * archimedean solid * ) , and represent each of the eight @xmath160-cycle ( but triangle - shaped ) faces of the emulator from  [ fig : e2_final ] at each of the truncated corners .",
    "we place , among those @xmath160-faces , pairs of the same type at the opposite corners of the cube .",
    "then we add the respective missing edges along the cube ridges , and finally we place the remaining vertices representing @xmath158 into the six octagonal facets of the body , which correspond to the rich gray faces from  [ fig : e2helper ] .        by proposition  [ prop :",
    "clydelta ] , the property of having a planar emulator is closed under taking @xmath41-transformations .",
    "moreover , the proof is constructive , and we may use it to mechanically produce new emulators from existing ones ( this principle goes even slightly beyond straightforward @xmath161-transformations , see section  [ sec : forbminors ] ) . therefore we can easily obtain an alternative emulator for @xmath6(cf .  theorem  [ thm : rieck ] ) which is significantly smaller and simpler than the original one in  @xcite .",
    "the emulator is presented in  [ fig : k1222_final ] .",
    ", height=264 ]    , height=264 ]    , height=264 ]    furthermore , in the same mechanical way , we can obtain planar emulators for other members of the `` @xmath6-family '' ; namely for @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath27 in  [ fig:32nonproj ] .",
    "several more interesting planar emulators can be straightforwardly obtained from that of @xmath155by means of @xmath161-transformations .",
    "see these emulators in figures  [ fig : b7_final],[fig : c3_final],[fig : d2_final ] .",
    "on the other hand , finding a planar emulator for the last member , @xmath26 , seems to be a more complicated case  the smallest one currently has @xmath162 vertices and we postpone its description to the appendix .",
    "consider the graph @xmath163drawn and labeled as in figure  [ fig : c4 ] , and observe that it is constructed of the cube graph with all nodes except for two ( say @xmath158 and @xmath164 ) in the opposing corners of the cube adjacent to an additional vertex @xmath56 .",

    ".[fig : c4gadget],height=151 ]    .[fig : c4emul],height=340 ]    the arising , triangular - shaped gadget allows an intuitive notion of _ outside _ ( nodes on the outer face ) and _ inside _",

    "now , to obtain an emulator for @xmath163 , we construct a graph embedded on a _ cuboctahedron _ ( the archimedean solid with 8 triangular and 6 square facets ) : clearly , we can draw its wire - frame structure planarly .",
    "note that each of the polyhedron s ridges is neighbored by one triangular and one square facet .",
    "we label all corners of this polyhedron with @xmath158 , and insert a ( properly rotated , see below ) copy of our gadget into each of the polyhedron s triangular facets .",
    "we can uniquely label the ridges of the polyhedron with @xmath140 , @xmath160 , or @xmath39 , depending on which of these nodes appear on the gadget s side along that ridge .",
    "all nodes @xmath158 have their required neighbors , and we can place a node representing @xmath56 into each square face and connect it with the nodes along its ridges .",

    "figure  [ fig : c4emul ] .",
    "already the survey @xcite  when commenting on the surprising rieck ",
    "yamashita construction  stressed the importance of deciding whether the graph @xmath156is planar - emulable .",
    "its importance is tied with the structural search for all potential nonprojective planar - emulable graphs ; see @xcite and section  [ sec : forbminors ] for a detailed explanation . briefly saying ,",
    "@xmath156(and its `` family '' of @xmath171 , @xmath172 , @xmath173 ;  [ fig:32nonproj ] ) are the only projective forbidden minors which have planar emulators and are not `` internally @xmath146-connected '' .",
    "in fact , for several reasons we believed that @xmath156cannot have a planar emulator , and so it came as another surprise when we have just recently discovered one .",
    "planar emulator : on the left , only vertex 2 misses an a - neighbor and 1,3 miss a b - neighbor .",

    "analogically on the right .",
    "the right - most picture shows the skeleton of the emulator in a `` polyhedral '' manner.,title=\"fig:\",height=113 ]    , constructed from the blocks in  [ fig : k7-c4_cells ] .",
    "the skeleton representing the central vertices is drawn in bold.,height=264 ]    in order to describe our planar emulator construction for @xmath156 , it is useful to divide the vertex set of @xmath156into three groups : the triple of _ central vertices _ ( named @xmath174 in  [ fig : k7-c4_final ] left ) adjacent to all other vertices , and the two vertex pairs ( named @xmath175 and @xmath176 ) each of which has connections only to its mate and to the central triple .",
    "this view allows us to identify a _ skeleton _ of the potential emulator as the subgraph induced on the vertices representing the central triple  @xmath174 and place the remaining vertices representing @xmath175 and @xmath176 into the skeleton faces , provided certain additional requirements are met .",
    "this simple idea leads to the introduction of basic building blocks ( see figure  [ fig : k7-c4_cells ] ) , each of which `` almost '' emulates the subgraph induced on 1,2,3,a , b and 1,2,3,c , d , respectively .",
    "the crucial property of the blocks is that the vertices labeled a , b or c , d have all the required neighbors in place . finally , four copies of each of the blocks can be arranged in the shape of an _ octahedron _ such that all missing requirements in the blocks are satisfied .",
    "the resulting planar emulator is in figure  [ fig : k7-c4_final ] .",
    "similar , though much more involved , procedures lead to constructions of planar emulators for the graphs @xmath171 , @xmath172 , @xmath173(which are @xmath41-transformable to @xmath156 ) .",
    "those emulators have 126 , 138 , and 142 vertices , respectively , and we refer interested readers to the appendix .",
    "emulator for @xmath156has a similar property as the one for @xmath155",
    ". we can embed it into a polyhedron  an octahedron in this case .",
    "we may then take 8 cells from figure  [ fig : k7-c4_cells ] and call them _ ab / cd cells_. three out of six outer vertices of each cell have both inner vertices as their neighbors ( they are _ ab or cd - satisfied _ ) and the remaining three have one ( they are _ ab or cd - half - satisfied _ ) .",
    "we take four cells of each kind and join the outer vertices such that every _ ab / cd cell _ will represent one facet of an octahedron and no two cells of the same kind will be adjacent .",
    "notice that the _ central vertices _ in the middle of each ridge of the octahedron are incident to two facets and _ central vertices _ on the corners of the octahedron are incident to four facets .",
    "we now rotate the _ ab / cd cells _ such that vertices on corners are twice _ ab - half - satisfied _ and twice _ cd - half - satisfied _ , every time by a different vertex , and vertices on the ridges are _ ab - satisfied _ by one of two incident facets and _ cd - satisfied _ by the other .",
    "such a construction is an emulator for @xmath156and can surely be drawn planarly ( see figure  [ fig : k7-c4_final ] ) .      once we can emulate @xmath156 , the natural question to ask is if this construction can be extended to @xmath171 , a graph which is created by applying a single @xmath177 transformation on @xmath156(replacing one triangular face of @xmath156by a vertex of degree 3 ) - see figure  [ fig : d3 ] . clearly , the same construction does not work , because of a special property of vertex 1 , which will be discussed later .",
    "again , we call again three vertices labeled 1,2,3 the _ central vertices _ and two other components _ abc and de_. we will consider an extra edge between vertices 1 and 3 , because it does not influence the property of having an emulator in this case ( see section 5 ) .",

    "nevertheless , we can take a @xmath156emulator as a core and `` fix '' the properties of such vertices .",
    "let s have two building blocks as in the @xmath156case and define two other supporting cells , _ abc - small - cell _ and _ de - small - cell _ ( see figure  [ fig : d3_cells ] ) . these will help us overcome the above mentioned drawback .",
    "we take one half of the emulator for @xmath156and upgrade the two _ ab cells _ to _ abc cells_. now we surround the graph with four _ abc - small - cells _ and four _ de - small - cells _ , such that the _ central vertices _ have all desired neighbors among @xmath178 and the outer vertices of the new expanded graph have better properties concerning the number and kind of neighbors ( see figure  [ fig : d3_help ] ) .",
    "we can observe that all vertices labeled with 3 are _ abc - satisfied _ or _ de - satisfied _ , but do not have one of the _ central vertices _ as a neighbor , vertices labeled with 1 are _ abc - satisfied _ and _ de - half - satisfied _ or _ de - satisfied _ and vertices with label 2 are _ de - satisfied _ and _ abc - half - satisfied _ or _ abc - satisfied_. additionally , if there is an edge between marginal vertex 1 and 2 , then they miss some neighbors from the component of the same kind .",
    "this fact enables us to copy the whole graph in figure  [ fig : d3_help ] and join it in a smart way with the original graph to obtain an emulator .",
    "if we identify pairs of vertices with label 3 from those two copies ( such that vertices that have only vertices 1 as a neighbor will be identified with the vertex which have the opposite problem ) , we get 4 empty hexagons , whose borders are made of two vertices with label 3 , which are _ completely satisfied _ , two vertices with label 1 , which are _ abc - satisfied _ and _ de - half - satisfied _ and two vertices with label 2 , which are _ abc - satisfied _ ( it holds for two of those hexagons , for the other two the _ abc and de - satisfactory _ properties are switched ) .",
    "thus these hexagons can be easily filled with the simple pattern for the border vertices to meet the required conditions ( see figure  [ fig : d3_hex ] ) .",
    "the final emulator for @xmath171is presented in figure  [ fig : d3_final ] and the above described approach is clearly visible ( two identical components derived from an emulator for @xmath156connected together ) .    ,",
    "width=453 ]      the construction of an emulator for @xmath173follows the same pattern as building an emulator for @xmath171 .",
    "in fact , the emulator for @xmath173was found first by the above mentioned construction and the emulator for @xmath171resulted from a simplification of an emulator for @xmath173 , ( @xmath171results from @xmath173by taking a @xmath179 transformation , which is trivial to perform in the emulator ) .",
    "therefore we present only the final emulator picture ( see figure  [ fig : f1_final ] ) .",
    "emulator , height=188 ]    built upon a `` half '' of a @xmath156emulator and 8 small cells for the outer vertices to have the best possible properties , height=245 ]    in order to obtain an emulator for @xmath172 , we again take one half of the emulator for @xmath156(as in the @xmath171case ) and replace _ ab / cd cells _ by _",
    "abc / def cells_. let s call this construction a _ core_. as in @xmath171case , we consider an additional edge 13 , which is not present in @xmath172but makes the pictures easier to understand .",
    "similarly , we use some smaller additional cells to improve the properties of the outer vertices of the _ core _ ( see figure  [ fig : e5_cells ] ) .",
    "since @xmath172is slightly different from @xmath173(both come from @xmath156 , but two @xmath177 transformations took place in different triangle faces , so there exists a vertex ( labeled 2 ) in @xmath172which is adjacent to two new vertices of degree 3 , but is not present in @xmath173 ) , the use of the supporting small cells is quite different as well .",
    "we surround the _ core _ as showed in figure  [ fig : e5_help ] . in this way",
    "we arrive to better properties of the outer vertices of the new graph .",
    "outer vertices labeled 1 are _ completely satisfied _ , vertices 2 are _ half - abc - satisfied _ and _ half - def - satisfied _ and vertices 3 are _ abc - satisfied _ and _ def - half - satisfied _ or vice versa .",
    ", width=453 ]    now we use a similar tool as in the previous cases of @xmath171and @xmath173 we duplicate the graph and connect the two copies in a clever way so that vertices 1 get the desired neighbor 2 as well and four new hexagons are created .",
    "the vertices surrounding each hexagonal face are missing some neighbors of the same component .",
    "we fill each face with a _ abc or def cell _ to satisfy all the remaining vertices .",
    "now we have a complete emulator for @xmath172(see figure  [ fig : e5_final ] ) .",
    "[ sec : forbminors ] until now , we have presented several newly discovered planar emulators of nonprojective graphs . unfortunately , despite the systematic construction methods introduced in section  [ sec : construct ] , we have got nowhere closer to a real understanding of the class of planar - emulable graphs .",
    "it is almost the other way round ",
    "the new planar emulators evince more and more clearly how complicated the problem is .",
    "hence , we also need to consider a different approach .",
    "the structural search method , on which we briefly report in this section , is directly inspired by previous @xcite ; we refer to  @xcite for closer details which can not fit into this paper .",
    "the general idea can be outlined as follows : if @xmath1 is a mysterious nonprojective planar - emulable graph , then @xmath1 must contain one of the projective forbidden minors , say @xmath48 , while @xmath48 can not be among those forbidden minors not having planar emulators ( theorems  [ thm:2kgraphs ] ,  [ thm : k35noemul ] ) .",
    "now there are basically three mutually exclusive possibilities :    a.   @xmath1 is a planar expansion of a smaller graph .",
    "a graph @xmath1 is a _ planar expansion _ of @xmath0 if it can be obtained by repeatedly substituting a vertex of degree @xmath180 in @xmath0 by a planar subgraph with the attachement vertices on the outer face .",
    "b.   @xmath1 contains a nonflat @xmath39-separation .",
    "a separation in a graph is called _ flat _ if one of the sides has a plane drawing with all the boundary vertices on the outer face . c.   @xmath1 is _ internally @xmath146-connected _ ,",
    "i.e. , it is @xmath39-connected and each @xmath39-separation in @xmath1 has one side inducing the subgraph @xmath181 ( informally , @xmath1 is @xmath146-connected up to possible degree-@xmath39 vertices with stable neighborhood ) .",
    "we denote by @xmath182 the _ family of @xmath29_. the underlying idea is that all the graphs in a family are @xmath41-transformable to the family s base graph .",
    "particulary the family of @xmath29 comprises all the projective forbidden minors in question which are not internally @xmath146-connected .",
    "see in  [ fig:32nonproj ] .    in the case ( i. ) above",
    ", we simply pay attention to the smaller graph @xmath0 . in the case ( ii . ) , one can argue that either the projective forbidden minor @xmath48 ( in  @xmath1 ) itself contains a nonflat @xmath39-separation ( so @xmath183 ) , or @xmath48 is internally @xmath146-connected and @xmath1 then is not planar - emulable ( a contradiction ) .",
    "the former is left for further investigation . finally , in the case ( iii .",
    ") we may apply a so - called _",
    "splitter theorem _ for internally @xmath146-connected graphs @xcite , provided that @xmath48 is also internally @xmath146-connected .",
    "this leads to a straightforward computerized search which has a high chance to finish in finitely many steps , producing all such desired internally @xmath146-connected graphs  @xmath1 .",
    "actually , when the aforementioned procedure was applied to the planar cover case in @xcite , the search was so efficient that the outcome could have been described by hand ; giving all @xmath184 specific graphs that potentially might be counterexamples to conjectures  [ conj : negami ] . in our emulator case",
    ", we get the following :    [ thm : our_result ] let @xmath1 be a nonprojective planar - emulable graph .",
    "then , @xmath1 is a planar expansion of one of specific @xmath185 internally 4-connected graphs , or @xmath1 contains a minor isomorphic to a member of @xmath186 .    up to this point , we have not been successful in finishing the computations for the graphs @xmath187 and @xmath155 , due to the high complexity of the generated extensions .",
    "yet , we strongly believe that it is possible to obtain finite results also for those cases , perhaps with the help of an improved generating procedure . on the other hand , the cases starting with @xmath188 will need an alternative procedure , e.g. , using so - called `` separation bridging '' .",
    "this is subject to future investigations .",
    "while our paper presents new and surprising findings about planar - emulable graphs , the truth is that these findings are often negative in the sense that they bring _ more intriguing questions than answers_. of course , the fundamental open question in the area is to find a characterization of the class of planar - emulable graphs in terms of some other natural ( and preferably topological ) graph property . even coming up with a plausible conjecture ( cf",
    ".  conjecture  [ conj : negami ] ) would be of high interest , but , with our current knowledge , already this seems to be out of reach yet .    instead",
    ", we suggest to consider the following specific ( sub)problems :    * is there a planar emulator of the graph @xmath22 ? we think the answer is _ no _ , but are currently unable to find a proof , e.g.  extending the arguments of  @xcite . *",
    "the emulators shown in section  [ sec : construct ] suggest that we can , in some mysterious way , reflect @xmath177-transformations in emulator constructions ( i.e. , the converse direction of proposition  [ prop : clydelta ] ) .",
    "such a claim can not be true in general since , e.g. , a @xmath41-transformation of the graph @xmath189 (  [ fig:32nonproj ] ) leads to a strict subgraph of @xmath190 , which therefore has a two - fold planar cover while @xmath189 is not planar - emulable by theorem  [ thm:2kgraphs ] .",
    "but where is the precise breaking point ?",
    "* the two smallest projective forbidden minors are on @xmath164 vertices , @xmath29 ( missing four edges of a cycle ) and @xmath6 ( missing three edges of a matching ) . both of them , however , have planar emulators while their common supergraph @xmath153 does not .",
    "what is a minimal subgraph of @xmath153 not having a planar emulator ?",
    "can we , at least , find a short argument that the graph @xmath191 has no planar emulator ?",
    "* finally , conjecture  [ conj : negami ] can be reformulated in a way that a graph has a planar cover iff it has a two - fold planar cover .",
    "the results of @xcite moreover imply that the minimal required fold number for planar - covers is bounded by a constant .",
    "although , in the emulator case , the numbers of representatives for each vertex of the emulated graph differ , there is still a possibility of a fixed upper bound on them : is there a constant @xmath192 such that every planar - emulable graph @xmath1 has a planar emulator with projection @xmath193 such that @xmath194 for all @xmath13 ? a computerized search as in section  [ sec : forbminors ] would be of great help in this task .",
