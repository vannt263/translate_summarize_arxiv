    "there is no need to explain the importance of the kondo problem for condense matter physics .",
    "it is relevant to the magnetic impurities in metals , heavy fermion compounds @xcite , tunneling phenomena in quantum dots @xcite , correlated lattice fermion systems @xcite , and many other physical systems .",
    "the problem of magnetic impurity in a two - dimensional ( 2d ) insulating system with long range antiferromagnetic order has also attracted great interest .",
    "this includes an impurity spin with an on - site @xcite and sublattice symmetric @xcite coupling , as well as an isolated ferromagnetic bond @xcite .",
    "because of adler s relation for the impurity - spin - wave interaction these systems have no nontrivial infrared dynamics at zero temperature in spite of the gapless spectrum of goldstone spin waves @xcite .",
    "this makes the impurity problem for the insulating state much simpler than the kondo one .",
    "however it has been realized recently @xcite that in the case when the 2d magnetic insulating system is close to the quantum critical point the infrared dynamics of the impurity is highly nontrivial and to a large extend is similar to that for the kondo problem .",
    "the quantum critical impurity problem has been very recently addressed by vojta , buragohain , and sachdev @xcite .",
    "they demonstrated that there are nontrivial critical indexes for the impurity green s function and for magnetic susceptibilities . in the present work we consider the same quantities calculating more accurately the critical indexes and in some cases the prefactors .",
    "in addition we consider specific heat and interaction of the impurities @xcite .",
    "to be specific we consider a magnetic impurity in two coupled heisenberg planes .",
    "the two coupled heisenberg planes is an ideal example of a 2d critical system which can be described by o(3 ) nonlinear @xmath0-model .",
    "the two planes model is very well studied at zero temperature both numerically @xcite and analytically @xcite .",
    "finite temperature properties are also well understood @xcite .",
    "hamiltonian of the system with impurity is of the form @xmath1 here @xmath2 is spin 1/2 on the square lattice .",
    "the index @xmath3 numerates cites , and the index @xmath4 numerates planes .",
    "@xmath5 is an antiferromagnetic coupling in the plane , and @xmath6 is an antiferromagnetic coupling between the planes .",
    "spin of the impurity , @xmath7 , is coupled to one of the planes .",
    "it is known that in this system at @xmath8 @xcite there is a quantum phase transition from quantum disordered state to the neel state . in the present work we consider only the quantum disordered phase including the critical point . as we have already pointed out",
    "an interesting regime arises only close to the critical point and therefore we concentrate on the vicinity of this point .",
    "note that in terms of the non - linear @xmath9 @xmath0-model an effective lagrangian of the system is @xmath10 , @xmath11 , where the parameters can be expressed in terms of parameters of the original hamiltonian ( [ h1 ] ) . in our considerations",
    "we will use only the original hamiltonian ( [ h1 ] ) .    using bond operator representation @xcite @xmath12 the two plane hamiltonian @xmath13 from ( [ h1 ] ) can be rewritten in terms of the operators @xmath14 , and then diagonalized by a combination of the fourier and bogoliubov transformations with account of the hard core constraint , see refs .",
    "@xcite : @xmath15 where @xmath16 are bogoliubov parameters .",
    "the operator @xmath17 creates quasiparticle of the system . this quasiparticle has spin 1 and we call it spin wave or magnon . near the critical point",
    "the spin - wave excitation energy is @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the spin - wave gap and @xmath20 is the spin - wave velocity .",
    "the function @xmath21 in the vicinity of the critical point is q - independent : @xmath22 .    in the bond operator representation",
    "the impurity hamiltonian is of the form @xmath23 here we have dropped the term @xmath24 .",
    "the matter is that we are interested in nontrivial long - range dynamics , but one can prove that all diagrams generated by the @xmath24 term are infrared convergent , and therefore its contribution is less important .",
    "an alternative way is to redefine @xmath25 as @xmath26 , then the @xmath24 term is canceled out exactly . note that for an integer impurity spin the @xmath24 term could be much more important because it can give a bound state of the spin wave with the impurity , and hence can lead to the full screening of the impurity .",
    "using ( [ huv ] ) we rewrite @xmath25 in terms of quasiparticle operators @xmath27 .",
    "@xmath28 where @xmath29 is the impurity pauli matrix .",
    "hereafter we set @xmath30 , so all energies are measured in units of @xmath5 .",
    "let us calculate the impurity self energy @xmath31 shown in fig . 1 .    in single loop approximation , see fig.1a , using eq .",
    "( [ himp1 ] ) we find @xmath32 close to the critical point @xmath33 , and hence simple integration gives for @xmath34 ( i.e. at the position of the quasiparticle pole ) @xmath35 here @xmath36 is dimensionless coupling constant , and @xmath37 is the ultraviolet cutoff .",
    "similar calculation for the second order self energy shown in fig.1b gives @xmath38 as soon as @xmath39 the second order self energy is small compared to the first order one , @xmath40 , and hence the perturbation theory is justified .",
    "however at @xmath41 the expansion does not converge and hence one has to sum all orders of perturbation theory .",
    "exactly at the critical point , @xmath42 , the expansion diverges at arbitrary small @xmath43 .",
    "the problem under consideration has a small parameter which is independent of the interaction .",
    "this is 1/n , where n=3 is number of components of the spin - wave excitation ( o(n ) @xmath0-model ) . in the leading in n approximation",
    "only the rainbow diagrams contribute to the impurity self energy .",
    "summation of these diagrams leads to the usual noncrossing approximation (= self consistent born approximation ) for the impurity green s function @xmath44 @xmath45 it is convenient to rescale the variables : @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 . in the new variables @xmath43 disappears from the eqs .",
    "( [ dy],[sb ] ) .",
    "dependence on @xmath43 remains only in the limits of @xmath50-integration : @xmath51 , where @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "consider first the critical point , i.e. @xmath54 in this case eqs .",
    "( [ dy],[sb ] ) can be solved analytically .",
    "the answer is @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the impurity binding energy .",
    "( [ g1 ] ) is valid if @xmath57 . for illustration",
    "we present in fig . 2 spectral function , @xmath58 , obtained by direct numerical solution of eqs . ( [ dy],[sb ] ) at @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "agreement with analytical solution ( [ g1 ] ) is perfect . at the large @xmath53 the impurity binding energy @xmath61 . in the original variables it means that @xmath62 , when @xmath63 .",
    "as one shall expect the green s function ( [ g1 ] ) has no quasiparticle pole .",
    "however the pole appears away from the critical point when the spin - wave gap is nonzero . for illustration we present in fig .",
    "3 the spectral functions obtained by numerical solution of eqs .",
    "( [ dy],[sb ] ) for @xmath64 , @xmath59 , and @xmath64 , @xmath65 .",
    "it is clear that the quasiparticle peak absorbs spectral weight of the incoherent green s function ( [ g1 ] ) from the area @xmath66 .",
    "therefore the quasiparticle residue @xmath67 ( c.f . with ref .",
    "slightly more detail analysis of the eqs .",
    "( [ dy],[sb ] ) shows that @xmath68    we have considered above the leading in n approximation .",
    "let us estimate now @xmath69 correction which is due to the single loop contribution to the impurity - magnon vertex function shown in fig.4 .",
    "taking into account the algebraic relation for the pauli matrices , @xmath70 , we find the vertex function given by fig .",
    "4 @xmath71 here @xmath72 and @xmath73 are energies of incoming impurity and spin wave correspondingly , and @xmath74 is the bare vertex given by eq .",
    "( [ himp1 ] ) . taking @xmath75 and using green s function ( [ g1 ] ) we find after integration in ( [ v1 ] ) @xmath76",
    "this is the the first term of @xmath69 expansion , and keeping in mind scaling behavior we find @xmath77    the impurity self energy is given by the diagram presented in fig .",
    "it differs from ( [ sb ] ) by the vertexes : the bare vertexes are replaced by the `` exact '' ones given by eq .",
    "( [ v3 ] ) . effectively this introduces an additional factor @xmath78 in the integrand in eq .",
    "( [ sb ] ) .",
    "assuming power behavior of the green s function @xmath79 and performing integration we find @xmath80 substitution of this self energy into dyson equation ( [ dy ] ) gives the following condition of self consistency @xmath81 therefore the green s function critical index with account of the leading @xmath69 correction is @xmath82    away from the critical point the quasiparticle pole appears in the greens function .",
    "it absorbs spectral weight of the incoherent green s function ( [ g2 ] ) from the area @xmath83 .",
    "therefore the quasiparticle residue scales as @xmath84",
    "following vojta , buragohain , and sachdev @xcite we consider two different types of the magnetic interaction .",
    "the first one is an interaction when the magnetic field @xmath85 interacts only with the impurity @xmath86 the second case is homogeneous magnetic field @xmath87    it is clear that in the first case the renormalized magnetic moment is proportional to the quasiparticle residue @xmath88 , and hence , according to ( [ zz1 ] ) it scales as @xmath89 if we consider the system exactly at the critical point , but at finite temperature , then the effective spin - wave gap is equal to the temperature , see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite : @xmath90 together with ( [ m1 ] ) this gives the following dependence of the impurity magnetic susceptibility on temperature .",
    "@xmath91    for homogeneous magnetic field the impurity magnetic moment",
    "is not renormalized because the interaction ( [ hm2 ] ) is proportional to the total spin which is conserved .",
    "the magnetic moment is certainly redistributed over the volume of size @xmath92 , but the value is conserved . for this reason",
    "the impurity susceptibility is given by usual the curie law .",
    "@xmath93 this conclusion is not quite trivial since the magnon cloud size @xmath94 at @xmath95 . besides eq .",
    "( [ xi11 ] ) does not agree with a conclusion from the paper @xcite .",
    "therefore in the next section we also present a diagrammatic prove of our statement .",
    "it is rather technical section and a reader who is satisfied by the general arguments can skip it .",
    "in the present section only homogeneous magnetic field ( [ hm2 ] ) is considered , therefore to simplify notations we omit the superscript ( ii ) .",
    "we restrict our consideration by single loop corrections , and follow the way used in ref .",
    "@xcite for calculation of the spin - wave magnetic moment .",
    "first we discuss a zero temperature case .",
    "single loop self energy is given by eq .",
    "( [ s11 ] ) .",
    "this as a simple perturbation theory in @xmath43 , but one can also consider this as a contribution to renormalization group equations with running coupling constant @xmath43 and running infrared cutoff @xmath96 .",
    "anyway , correction to the quasiparticle residue due to ( [ s11 ] ) is following @xmath97 the impurity magnetic moment is renormalized according to the diagrams shown in fig . 6 .    first contribution comes from the correction to the quasiparticle residue : @xmath98 .",
    "straightforward calculation gives @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "altogether this gives @xmath101 so as one shall expect there is no renormalization of the magnetic moment .    at finite temperature the relation ( [ dmu1 ] ) remains valid since the only thing we have to do is to replace @xmath102 .",
    "however at finite temperature there are also additional diagrams which are due to the heat bath of the excited magnons @xcite . first of all these are the two contributions to the self energy shown in fig .",
    "7    both contributions are proportional to the magnon mean occupation number @xmath103 but they are of the opposite sign and exactly cancel each other .",
    "so they do not influence the position of the quasiparticle pole .",
    "however these diagrams contribute equally to the quasiparticle residue @xmath104 this gives a correction to the inpurity magnetic moment .",
    "other thermally induced corrections to the magnetic moment are given by diagrams presented in fig .",
    "straightforward calculation gives @xmath105 $ ] , and + @xmath106 $ ] .",
    "total thermally induced correction to the impurity magnetic moment is equal to @xmath107 together with eq .",
    "( [ dmu1 ] ) this proves that the impurity magnetic moment is not renormalized .",
    "thus , in spite of the cloud of virtual and thermal magnons , effectively the impurity in the external magnetic field can be described as a spin 1/2 system with unrenormalized magnetic moment .",
    "hence we immediately come to eq .",
    "( [ xi11 ] ) .",
    "we would like to stress that the arguments related to the magnetic moment guarantee only singular in @xmath108 part of the susceptibility , therefore instead of ( [ xi11 ] ) it is more correct to write @xmath109 .",
    "binding energy of the impurity has been calculated in section iii . exactly at the critical point , at zero temperature , and at small coupling constant , @xmath63 ,",
    "the binding energy is @xmath62 .",
    "a finite spin - wave gap @xmath96 pushes the position of the quasiparticle pole up , see fig .",
    "3 . for a small gap the dependence of @xmath56 on the gap is linear , and the coefficient of",
    "the proportionality is approximately 2 : @xmath110 the origin of @xmath96 in this equation is not important : whether @xmath96 is nonzero because the system is away from the critical point , or the system is at the critical point , but @xmath96 is nonzero because of temperature . in the later case we can use eq . ( [ gt ] ) for the gap and hence the impurity specific heat is @xmath111 note that this is highly unusual result because @xmath112 at @xmath95 . for comparison :",
    "the bulk specific heat of a 2d antiferromagnet at the quantum critical point is quadratic in temperature , @xmath113 , see e.g. refs",
    ". @xcite . from ( [ cimp ] )",
    "one concludes that the impurity entropy is @xmath114 . strictly speaking this is nonsense because it gives @xmath115 .",
    "this probably indicates that there is a small nonzero critical index @xmath116 in the specific heat dependence : @xmath117 .",
    "equation ( [ e00 ] ) has been derived in the noncrossing approximation .",
    "one can check that single loop vertex corrections considered at the end of the section iii do not change this equation .",
    "it probably means that nonzero @xmath116 can appear only due to the two loop corrections , @xmath118 .",
    "there is no doubt that this is a very interesting problem which deserves further analytical analysis and which can be also studied in numerical simulations .",
    "interaction between two impurities is given by diagram shown in fig .",
    "since the impurities are localized , we have to integrate over all possible momenta transfer q. away from the critical point there are two distinct regimes : @xmath119 and @xmath120 , where @xmath121 is distance between the impurities and @xmath122 is the spin - wave velocity . in the first regime",
    "the interaction drops down exponentially with distance and it is not an interesting case .",
    "we consider only @xmath120 case which is also relevant to the critical point .",
    "we also assume that the coupling constant is strong enough : @xmath41 .",
    "the impurity - magnon interaction is given by the hamiltonian ( [ himp1 ] ) .",
    "according to the consideration in section iii it is renormalized as @xmath123 , where @xmath124 is quasiparticle residue ( [ zz ] ) , and @xmath125 is the vertex ( [ v3 ] )",
    ". therefore the interaction corresponding to the diagram fig.9 is of the form @xmath126 ^ 2 e^{i{\\bf q r}}}\\over{\\omega_{\\bf q}^2}}{{d^2 q}\\over{(2\\pi)^2}},\\ ] ] where @xmath127 and @xmath128 are the impurities pauli matrixes .",
    "one power of @xmath129 in the denominator appears because of the spin - wave propagator and another power is due to the bare interaction ( [ himp1 ] ) . with account of ( [ al ] ) , ( [ zz ] ) , and ( [ v3 ] )",
    "this gives @xmath130 this is a long range ferromagnetic interaction .",
    "an interesting fact is that the interaction is independent of the bare coupling constant @xmath43 . another",
    "interesting fact is that there is no renormalization of the power in the @xmath131 dependence .",
    "however we stress that these facts have been proven only in the one loop approximation ( one loop above the leading noncrossing approximation ) .",
    "the dynamics of the magnetic impurity in a 2d antiferromagnet close to the critical point is highly nontrivial . to some",
    "extend it is similar to the dynamics in the kondo problem . in the present paper we have considered spin 1/2 impurity .",
    "we have calculated indexes for critical behavior of the green s function , vertexes , magnetic moments and magnetic susceptibilities .",
    "we have also considered the impurity specific heat and long range interaction between two impurities which is due to the spin - wave exchange .",
