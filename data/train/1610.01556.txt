    "quantum nature of vacuum is still one of the most relevant features of quantum field theory ( qft ) due to theoretical and also technological implications . from a conceptual point of view",
    ", understanding the physical properties of vacuum at the quantum level is unavoidable in a wide range of areas , from quantum optics@xcite and condensed matter@xcite to astrophysics and cosmology@xcite . on the other hand , from a practical point of view ,",
    "novel experiments measuring forces@xcite and heat transfer at the nanoscale@xcite shows that , exploiting all these features , a new generation of technological improvements is coming@xcite .    for these reasons , study quantum vacuum fluctuations ( going from casimir - van der waals interactions to quantum friction )",
    "is of main interest . in particular ,",
    "casimir forces arising from the physical adaptation of a quantum field to the presence of arbitrary - shaped objects acting as boundaries , are still a source of abundant scientific research . since the foundational paper by casimir@xcite , where the force between two perfect conductor plates was studied , numerous subsequent works pointed in the direction to study different aspects of these vacuum phenomena more related to realistic experimental scenarios . the natural step and",
    "one of the most remarkable works in this sense , is the work by lifshitz@xcite , where dissipation and noise were included for the first time in the calculation of the casimir force between dielectric plates at zero temperature through an approach based on stochastic electrodynamics , resulting in the celebrated lifshitz formula for the force .",
    "this work also set the basis for the so - called fluctuational quantum electrodynamics ( fqed ) as it is currently known .",
    "few years later , in ref.@xcite , a formal approach based on qft at finite temperature was developed to study thermal corrections on computing the force , arriving to a more sophisticated and complete form of the lifshitz formula at thermal equilibrium .",
    "after these works , the study of different features of the casimir effect had a significant growth going beyond fundamental physics and entering chemistry and biology@xcite . moreover , a new generation of extremely accurate experiments ( see for example ref.@xcite ) gave rise to the study of the forces between objects of different geometries , dynamical phenomena ( such as the dynamical casimir effect and quantum friction , which both involve particle creation by moving boundaries ) and heat transfer at the nanoscale@xcite .",
    "several discussions have taken place due to the introduction of models for real materials , exposing the discrepancies between the theoretical models and its constrast with experiments , such as the drude vs plasma controversy@xcite .",
    "in fact , some of these discussions are currently open yet and are awaiting for solution .",
    "beyond all these advances , addressing non - equilibrium scenarios from both theory and experiments was a significant debt for a long time . in recent years , it gained great attention due to its potential applications@xcite .",
    "one of the first and remarkable works in the area is given by ref.@xcite , which study the casimir force between two slabs characterized by arbitrary frequency - dependent permittivity functions .",
    "however , the approach employed is more an extension to non - equilibrium scenarios of the lifshitz s method than a fully quantization scheme , and then takes part of the mentioned fqed approaches . as far as we know",
    ", a full quantum approach based on qft for these situations was given subsequently in refs.@xcite .",
    "in these works , the huttner - barnett ( hb ) microscopic model ( consisting in the 3 + 1 electromagnetic ( em ) field interacting with material polarizable bodies described by polarization degrees of freedom coupled to thermal baths in each point of space@xcite ) is fully quantized by the closed time path ( ctp ) or schwinger - keldysh functional formalism@xcite . implementing the influence functional to treat the field as an open quantum system , the field correlation can be calculated exactly and the result of ref.@xcite is recovered . nevertheless ,",
    "although both results agree , from a conceptual point of view , they present very subtle differences .    in ref.@xcite the steady ( non - equilibrium ) state",
    "is taken as an assumption and introduced in the calculations through implicitly assuming time - invariance for the heisenberg equations when giving its fourier transform as the starting point .",
    "considering that , in fact , the heisenberg equations are always subjected to initial conditions , which are discarded here by the ` steadiness ' assumption , in this sense we can say that the scheme is a ` steady quantization scheme ' . moreover ,",
    "the material bodies are described by the macroscopic frequency - dependent ( complex ) permittivity function and the fluctuations of the polarization sources inside , relating both by a fluctuation - dissipation relation containing the correct quantum thermal properties . as the relation is established separately for each point of each body , different temperatures for each body are easily introduced and the ` steadiness ' of the non - equilibrium scenario is quite reasonable and physically consistent . then , non - equilibrium forces between two half - spaces and between two slabs ( finite width ) are analyzed . in the first case , the force results to be a sum of the contributions of each half - space , each one characterized by the respective temperature .",
    "for the two slabs case , the force present analog contributions ( coming from each slabs ) but , since the bodies configuration is surrounded by vacuum , the radiation ( coming from distant sources ) impinging on the external surfaces also contribute to the force experienced by each slab .",
    "therefore , contributions from this radiation enter the force .",
    "for these terms , the same expressions deduced exclusively for dissipative materials are employed for the vacuum ( dissipationless ) external regions , taking advantage implicitly of the continuity of the dissipative result with the dissipationless one when the damping constant is taken to zero ( as it is done also in ref.@xcite ) . apart from the calculations ,",
    "all the framework and picture constitutes a fqed scheme at a steady scenario rather than a purely quantum one .",
    "on the other hand , in refs.@xcite , the situation arises in another way .",
    "the ctp formalism implemented does not assume a steady situation .",
    "on the contrary , is built for study the full time evolution from given initial conditions at time @xmath0 , being closely related to the full solution of the heisenberg equations . in this context",
    ", the steady situation emerges as the long - time limit of the full time evolution , i.e. , by taking @xmath1 in all the expressions .",
    "regarding the materials , in these works , a microscopic quantum model ( similar to the hb model ) is introduced to describe the internal dynamics of the degrees of freedom and thermal baths at each point of the dielectric bodies . before the initial time @xmath0 , all the parts of the total system ( field and materials ) are not interacting . at time",
    "@xmath0 , all the interactions begin and the system start to evolve .",
    "thus , the macroscopic em properties of the material result from tracing out the internal degrees of freedom and the thermal baths during the interaction with the em field . in this way , the steady situation is deduced and the fluctuation - dissipation relation results naturally from the open quantum system framework . in ref.@xcite ,",
    "a correspondence between this quantum model and a stochastic description is fully demonstrated , exposing the existing connection between fqed and a fully quantum theory . in principle , three contributions are shown to appear for every case , each one associated to each field s sources resulting from the interactions present .",
    "one is associated to the thermal baths , another one to the internal degrees of freedom and the last one to the initial conditions of the field . in ref.@xcite ,",
    "the formalism is applied to the study of the non - equilibrium half - space problem .",
    "the steady situation is deduced and it is shown that the only contribution present in this case is the one associated to the baths .",
    "moreover , it gives exactly the same result as the one obtained from the fqed approach at ref.@xcite .",
    "however , related to the results of ref.@xcite , it is suggested from the calculations that for the case of slabs ( finite width ) , in addition to the baths , the initial conditions would contribute to the long - time regime .",
    "this would be entirely related to the presence of infinite - size dissipationless regions , which causes that the initial free field fluctuations survive the damping in the dissipative material bodies to conform the vacuum modified modes when reaching the steady situation .",
    "in other words , the modified modes would be the steady result of the dynamical adaptation process of the initial free field modes ( without boundaries ) to the appearance of the material boundaries , giving a non - vanishing initial conditions contribution at the long - time regime . in this train of thought , for the case of half - spaces",
    ", there is no initial conditions contribution since , on the contrary , dissipation overcomes free - field fluctuations .",
    "in fact , in the framework of ref.@xcite , the initial conditions contribution would matched with the distant - sources contribution , although in this approach the radiation is related to the quantum fluctuations of the field already adapted to the boundaries .",
    "moreover , it would also be matched with the homogeneous solution commented in ref.@xcite , obtained from a ` steady path integral quantization ' scheme .",
    "on the other hand , in a ` steady canonical quantization ' scheme , this homogeneous solution is quantized in a specific hilbert space with its own creation and annihilation operators for the vacuum modes .",
    "all in all , the results of refs.@xcite are suggesting , indeed , that these operators are defined at the initial time , i.e. , they are the creation and annihilation operators of the free field although they are used to quantize the homogeneous contribution when the boundaries are present .    in this sense ,",
    "one of the main results of the present work is to show that all the mentioned suggestions and correspondences are true for arbitrary material configurations , validating the physical mechanism described above . for these purposes",
    ", we developed the canonical quantization version of ref.@xcite , where the material model mentioned above is considered in interaction with a scalar field .",
    "clearly , the approach presented here can be extended to the em case but for simplicity in the calculations we considered a one dimensional scalar field .",
    "we will proceed to solve the full dynamics of the total system , regarding the field correlation , which allow us to study the expectation values of the energy momentum tensor and , consequently , the casimir force .",
    "we obtain the three mentioned contributions and we deduce its steady expressions by taking the long - time limit @xmath1 . at this point , all the results are given for a general configuration . in this way , we are able to study the scalar field dynamics at any non - equilibrium scenario for this composite system . as far as we know , this kind of approach to non - equilibrium situations is completely new and its advantage is to be very suitable for computing the force and every quantity that can be obtained from the field operator .",
    "this is the main contribution of this work from a purely conceptual point of view .",
    "nevertheless , one of the practical advantages of this approach is that it gives the chance to study the quantities for non - classical initial states of the field . in quantum optics and cavity qed , squeezed",
    "states are the most common non - classical field states considered@xcite .",
    "for example , in quantum communications using this state , quantum uctuations of one of its quadrature components can be lower than that of the corresponding part in a coherent state , while the other component is higher .",
    "this gives the possibility of tuning the signal - to - noise ratios of its quadrature components , giving the chance to use one of the quadratures to absorb the quantum noise , while the other can be implemented to transmit an extremely well - dened signal .",
    "in several applications , the quantum em field inside a cavity is in a squeezed state .",
    "the squeezing can be generated through interacting with atoms inside the cavity@xcite , which also open the way to study other different quantum phenomena as decoherence and teleportation@xcite .",
    "hence , understanding the physics of the interactions pertaining the field inside a cavity and involving non - classical states is necessary to the development of new quantum technologies .",
    "although the cavity is made of a good ( but not perfect ) conductor , it is common in the analysis to consider it as made of perfect materials , disregarding any corrections due to dissipation and non - equilibrium thermal effects@xcite .",
    "it is clear that the effectiveness of this approximation depends on the experimental conditions achieved .",
    "therefore , it is of great interest to include these effects accurately . in this work",
    "we give light on how to address these calculations .",
    "we calculate the casimir force between two dissipative material slabs ( playing the role of cavity ) when the field is in a squeezed state and each slabs has its own temperature .",
    "this greatly improve the results found in a previous work@xcite , where the casimir force between two perfect conductor plates is calculated when the field is in a squeezed state .",
    "moreover , our present result could be also implemented to enter the discussion given in ref.@xcite about the spatial properties of the squeezing of vacuum , including realistic details as thermal imbalance between the plates and the effect of dissipation , which escapes the scope of this work .    with the aim of focusing the main text of the work and the calculations on the mentioned results , we have left large calculations and deductions to several appendices at the end of the paper .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the next section we describe the model and write the field equation with its solution .",
    "the full derivation of the field equation is left to appendix [ appa ] . in section [ cfo ]",
    ", we study the long - time limit of the contributions to the field operator , with the main features of each one and the relation to other works .",
    "the analytical technique ( including a general discussion of different configurations ) along with the derivation of the long - time limit for each contribution are left to appendices [ appb ] , [ appc ] and [ appd ] .",
    "then , in section [ cemt ] , it is shown that two contributions take part on the expectation values of the energy - momentum tensor at the steady state and each contribution is worked out . for the baths contribution ,",
    "thermal states are considered . for the initial conditions contribution ,",
    "the expectation values are computed both for thermal and also squeezed initial state of the field with the implementation of time - average .",
    "section [ cffwpc ] is devoted to the calculation of the total casimir force for the finite width plates configuration , deriving general expressions for each contribution the force . in appendix [ appe ]",
    "we give the homogeneous solutions and the green function needed for the calculations of the section , while in appendix [ appf ] we show how our result recovers the dissipationless limit and the lifshitz formula at thermal equilibrium . in section [ cbcftss ] ,",
    "we present a comparison between the casimir forces obtained by taking a thermal state for the field and an squeezed one , when the baths keep the same temperature . finally , section [ fr ] summarize our findings .    throughout the paper , for simplicity",
    ", we have set @xmath2 .",
    "with the aim of including effects of dissipation and noise in the evaluation of the casimir energy or force , we will use the theory of open quantum systems , having in mind the paradigmatic example of the quantum brownian motion ( qbm ) @xcite .",
    "the model is a simplified version of the hb model , consisting of a system composed of two parts : a massless scalar field and dielectric material which , in turn , are described by their internal degrees of freedom ( a set of harmonic oscillators ) .",
    "both sub - systems conform a composite system which is coupled to a second set of harmonic oscillators , that plays the role of an external environment or thermal bath . for simplicity we will work in @xmath3 dimensions . in our toy model the massless field represents the electromagnetic field , and the first set of harmonic oscillators directly coupled to the scalar field represents the polarizable volume elements of the material .    considering the usual interaction term between the electromagnetic field and the ordinary polarizable matter , the coupling between the field and the volume elements of the material will be taken as a current - type one , where the field couples to the velocity of variation of the volume elements degrees of freedom .",
    "the coupling constant for this interaction is the electric charge @xmath4 .",
    "we will also assume that there is no direct coupling between the field and the thermal bath . the lagrangian density is therefore given by :    @xmath5    where we have stressed the fact that @xmath6 and @xmath7 have a dependence on position as a label identifying the point of space as which they are located but without being dynamical variable ( as it happens for the scalar field ) .",
    "it is clear that each atom interacts with a thermal bath placed at the same position .",
    "we have denoted by @xmath8 the density of the degrees of freedom of the volume elements .",
    "the constants @xmath9 are the coupling constants between the volume elements and the bath oscillators .",
    "it is implicitly understood that eq.([lagrangianatotal ] ) represents the lagrangian density inside the material , while outside the lagrangian is given by the free field one .",
    "the quantization of the theory is straightforward .",
    "it should be noted that the full hilbert space of the model @xmath10 , where the quantization is performed , is not only the field hilbert space @xmath11 ( as is considered in others works where the field is the only relevant degree of freedom ) , but also includes the hilbert spaces of the volume elements degrees of freedom @xmath12 and the bath oscillators @xmath13 , in such a way that @xmath14 .",
    "we will assume , as frequently done in the context of qbm , that for @xmath15 the three parts of the systems are uncorrelated and not interacting .",
    "interactions are turned on at @xmath16 .",
    "therefore , the initial conditions for the operators @xmath17 , @xmath18 must be given in terms of operators acting in each part of the hilbert space .",
    "the interactions will make that initial operators to become operators over the whole space @xmath10 .",
    "the initial density matrix of the total system is of the form :    @xmath19    so , in principle , each part can be in any state .",
    "once the model of the interaction between the field and the matter is properly described , the equations of motion can be obtained . solving the respective equations for the bath oscillators and the volume elements , an equation of motion for the field can be deduced . in appendix",
    "[ appa ] , this work is done in the context of the open quantum system s framework , showing that the field equation is given by :    @xmath20=4\\pi\\eta ec(x)\\left[\\dot{g}_{1}(t - t_{0})\\widehat{r}_{x}(t_{0})+\\dot{g}_{2}(t - t_{0})\\frac{\\widehat{p}_{x}(t_{0})}{m } + \\int_{t_{0}}^{t}d\\tau~\\dot{g}_{2}(t-\\tau)\\frac{\\widehat{f}_{x}(\\tau - t_{0})}{m}\\right ] , \\label{ecmovcampototalknoll}\\ ] ]    where @xmath21 is the susceptibility function with @xmath22 the plasma frecuency .",
    "it is worth noting that we have included an spatial label denoting the straightforward generalization to inhomogeneous media , where each point of the material can have different properties .",
    "beyond this dependence , the boundaries of the material bodies enters through the spatial material distribution function @xmath23 , which is zero in free space points .",
    "the regions filled ( and the contours ) with real material are defined by this function .",
    "this is clearly essential for the determination of the field s boundary conditions .",
    "this equation ( like all heisenberg equations ) is clearly subjected to initial conditions , in this case , free field conditions :    @xmath24^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\left(\\widehat{a}_{k}(t_{0})~e^{i(kx-\\omega_{k}t_{0})}+\\widehat{a}_{k}^{\\dag}(t_{0})~e^{-i(kx-\\omega_{k}t_{0})}\\right ) , \\label{condinicampototal}\\ ] ]    @xmath25^{\\frac{1}{2}}i\\omega_{k}\\left(-\\widehat{a}_{k}(t_{0})~e^{i(kx-\\omega_{k}t_{0})}+\\widehat{a}_{k}^{\\dag}(t_{0})~e^{-i(kx-\\omega_{k}t_{0})}\\right ) , \\label{condinidercampototal}\\ ] ]    where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the annihilation and creation operators for the free field at the initial time , and @xmath28 .    to solve the equation ,",
    "the retarded green function can be employed , in such a way that the associated equation for @xmath29 reads :    @xmath30    subjected to the following initial conditions :    @xmath31    in such a way that the field can be written as :    @xmath32    which is the general solution for the field operator of the full time - dependent problem from given initial conditions .",
    "as it expected , the field operator presents three parts , each one consisting in a operator acting in one of the three hilbert spaces of the total hilbert space .",
    "as it was recently stressed , the last equation of the preceding section means that the field operator begins at the initial time @xmath0 as an operator on @xmath11 .",
    "nevertheless , the switching - on of the interactions causes the field operator to become an operator on the full hilbert space @xmath10 during the time evolution :    @xmath33    as we are interested in evaluating the casimir force in non - equilibrium but steady situations , we have to investigate the long - time limit ( @xmath1 ) of these three contributions .",
    "although the field operator will remain as an operator in the full hilbert space @xmath10 , as we will see , the casimir force not necessarily contains contributions associated to each part of @xmath10 .",
    "this will depends on the internal dynamics of the material and the initial state @xmath34 but also strongly on the boundaries configuration considered , as it was commented in refs.@xcite .",
    "let us consider the field operator s contribution associated to the initial conditions . since the initial conditions are written in terms of the creation and annihilation operators of the free field through eqs.([condinicampototal ] ) and ( [ condinidercampototal ] ) , the contribution can also be written in terms of these operators .",
    "hence , the contribution splits into @xmath35 , with @xmath36 due to the fact that the retarded green function @xmath37 is real and the hermiticity of the initial free - field operators .",
    "therefore , @xmath38 is associated to the free - field annihilation operator @xmath26 and @xmath39 to the free - field creation operator @xmath27 . moreover , given eqs.([ecmovgreen ] ) and ( [ condinicialesgreen ] ) , the initial conditions problem can be solved by laplace transform . therefore , the equation of motion for the retarded green function s laplace transform @xmath40 is given by :    @xmath41    with @xmath42 the refraction index at the point @xmath43 :    @xmath44    the last equation is valid for every spatial dependence on the material properties and also for every configuration of boundaries . for a given material s distribution @xmath45 , the boundary conditions are determined through integrating the equation ( it is worth noting that the laplace transform @xmath46 turns out to be the green function associated to the operator @xmath47 . ) .",
    "once we have obtained @xmath46 in the @xmath48-space , we can go back to the coordinate retarded green function @xmath37 via the laplace anti - transform ( or mellin s formula , see refs.@xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the field operator can be written in terms of the laplace transform of the retarded green function :    @xmath49    to find the green function @xmath46 , we use the technique found in ref.@xcite , where the green function of the sturm - liouville differential equation can be obtained from two solutions of the associated homogeneous equation , each one satisfying the boundary conditions on each side of the interval where the variable takes values .",
    "then , we perform spatial integration for the general case of arbitrary number of interfaces . finally , analyzing the complex - analytical properties given by the poles configuration , the long - time ( steady ) operator for this contribution can be worked out exactly by assuming causality as the only physical requirement .",
    "all this laborious task can be found in appendix [ appb ] , where it is shown that the final and most general expression for the long - time operator is given by :    @xmath50^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\widehat{a}_{k}(-\\infty)\\left[e^{-ikt}~\\theta(k)~\\phi_{-ik}^{>}(x)+e^{ikt}~\\theta(-k)~\\left(\\phi_{-ik}^{<}(x)\\right)^{*}\\right]\\nonumber\\\\ & & + ~\\left[\\text{time and spatial independent oscillatory term}\\right ] .",
    "\\label{longtimefieldoperatoric}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the first term of this expression is exactly the one suggested as an ansatz in the steady situation in ref.@xcite , based on the solution obtained for the dissipationless material case in ref.@xcite .",
    "this also includes and confirm the result shown in ref.@xcite for the initial condition contribution in the case of a single delta plate ( which verifies the ansatz of ref.@xcite ) .",
    "it also includes the case of one thick plate analyzed in ref.@xcite .",
    "in fact , this demonstration proves the general case based on canonical quantization scheme , extending to all the variety of situations .",
    "the functions @xmath51 correspond to the modified modes for positive frequencies while @xmath52 are the modes for the negative ones . the dynamical appearance and physics of these modes from a transient stage to a steady situation",
    "were commented briefly in ref.@xcite and deeper in ref.@xcite , although in the @xmath53 electromagnetic lifshitz problem ( two parallel half - spaces separated by a distance ) analyzed in that work there was no modified modes at all . here we have the same result for the lifshitz problem of a @xmath3 scalar field .",
    "clearly , the physics are the same .",
    "the modified modes appears in situations where there is an infinite - size dissipationless region , since the free fluctuation of the quantum field prevails over the dissipation in the finite regions occupied by materials , achieving a non - vanishing steady contribution at the long - time limit .",
    "inversely , if there is no infinite - size dissipationless region , the initial conditions contribution vanishes at the long - time limit , since dissipation overcomes free fluctuation in finite regions and the contribution is damped .",
    "the second term , which is oscillatory and also time ( and spatial ) independent , will have no relevance on the calculation of the energy - momentum tensor expectation values since it involves time and spatial derivatives of the field operator .    as a final comment for this section , it is worth noting that the present demonstration is valid for every material represented by a refraction index @xmath54 , which enters the laplace transform of the retarded green function s via eq.([ecmovgreenlaplace ] ) .",
    "then , the deduction only stands on the green function s properties , but without any restriction on the material model in addition to causality and physical consistence ( which implies poles with non - positive real part ) .",
    "the information about the material is indeed contained in the specific form of the refraction index , which is the result of the interaction between the materials and the quantum field . here ,",
    "as it happens in ref.@xcite , this is related to the definition of the susceptibility function @xmath55 , obtained from solving the heisenberg equations of motion for the material s degrees of freedom ( volume elements plus thermal baths ) . in the ctp - integral formulation of ref.@xcite ( and",
    "ref.@xcite for the electromagnetic version ) , the refraction index is directly related to the dissipation kernel generated by the material .",
    "however , as we have seen , that the initial conditions contribution does not vanish in the steady regime is more related with the existence of infinite - size dissipationless regions rather than the material properties .",
    "now , we consider the field operator s contribution associated to the volume elements .",
    "since this contribution contains the volume elements initial conditions @xmath56 , the operator of this part always acts on the volume elements hilbert spaces .",
    "these operator can always be expressed in terms of the annihilation and creation operators :    @xmath57    we can write this contribution as splitted in terms of the annihilation and creation operators of each volume element , @xmath58 . from eq.([operadorcampototalgreen ] ) , we have :    @xmath59    where , for simplicity , we have omitted the spatial labels on the volume elements properties , such as the parameters ( frequency , mass and density ) , or green functions of the material ( @xmath60 ) . however",
    ", all the calculations will be valid considering this spatial dependence .",
    "again , the crucial point is to deduce the long - time limit for this operator contribution .",
    "the green function can be written in terms of its laplace transform and analyzing the poles configuration .",
    "the steady expression can be obtained by only involving assumptions related to causality .",
    "this work is realized at appendix [ appc ] .",
    "therefore , the long - time limit ( @xmath1 ) of the operator is :    @xmath61    which is a time- and space - independent operator .    at first glance , is clear that the presence of the material distribution @xmath62 causes that the integration is over the regions containing material .",
    "however , since the energy - momentum tensor is constructed from expectation values of binary products of the field operator derivatives , the time and space independence of the long - time limit of the field operator makes the volume elements to not contribute at the steady situation for the physical dynamical quantities of interest .",
    "this is clearly in accordance with the results obtained in refs.@xcite for different situations .",
    "this also shows how the approximation considered in refs.@xcite , where this contribution is discarded , is not correct at the operator level but turns out to be valid when calculating energy - momentum tensor expectation values .    as a final comment",
    ", it should be noted that the behaviour of the volume elements contribution and the fact that it does not join the steady situation , is directly related with the material model considered .",
    "the dissipative dynamics of each volume element , considered effectively as a quantum brownian particle , makes the contribution vanishes at the long - time limit .",
    "nevertheless , if the material model for the volume elements were taken to be quantum systems with non - dissipative dynamics , therefore a contribution at the steady situation would be present .",
    "this will be the case of the contribution of the baths of the next section .",
    "moreover , this also be the case if , for example , we set the dissipation parameter @xmath63 equal to zero , i.e. , if we put every coupling constant between the baths and the volume elements equal to zero .",
    "the permittivity will be plasma - like and , in addition to the pole at @xmath64 , two more poles with zero real part ( @xmath65 ) will contribute to the volume elements field operator that reach the steady situation .",
    "for the drude model , the situation goes back to the case where @xmath64 is the only pole , although the expression of the long - time limit of the field operator changes slightly .      from eq.([operadorcampototalgreen ] ) , the baths contribution is given by :    @xmath66    in contrast with how we proceeded for the other contributions , the full expression can be worked out now , instead of considering the annihilation contribution separated .",
    "however , the same methodological approach as for the other two contributions can be implemented .",
    "the crucial point is that , due to the dissipationless dynamics of the harmonic oscillators of the baths , the long - time limit of the solution is an operator that depends on both time and space .",
    "this work is shown in detail on appendix [ appd ] , giving that the long - time contribution in this case reads :    @xmath67    which has exactly the same form as the expression achieved in ref.@xcite for the em field using a stochastic electrodynamics framework for the ( quantum ) lifshitz problem .",
    "it is also clear that the presence of the matter distribution @xmath23 makes the spatial integration to be carried out over the regions occupied by the material bodies , which in fact can be inhomogeneous since the local properties of the material can change in each point of space .",
    "this is why the integration over @xmath68 contains every factor in the r.h.s . , to eventually consider inhomogeneous materials .",
    "this last expression also has the time and space dependence suggested in refs.@xcite for the so - called langevin contribution associated to the baths and consisting in outgoing waves from the material bodies .",
    "this last feature is verified through the time dependence , while the space dependence is correctly supported by the spatial dependence of the field s retarded green function transform @xmath69 .    as a final comment to this section ,",

    "therefore , for large @xmath168 , the squeezing approaches to zero and the value of the contribution for the squeezed state gets closer to the thermal value . at first glance , this seems natural since the initial conditions contribution at zero temperature result from putting @xmath188 for every @xmath136 .",
    "but , in our case , we are comparing the contribution for a squeezed state with the value for a thermal one with @xmath178 instead of zero temperature . however , the integrand of the initial conditions contribution does not change significantly for different values of temperature because @xmath189 $ ] in eq.([casimirforceicfull ] ) is different from zero when the thermal factor @xmath190 is close to 1 .",
    "this means that the initial conditions contribution is insensitive to the chosen temperature .",
    "thus , the ratio between the initial conditions contributions for a thermal state with @xmath178 and for a squeezed state with large bandwidth @xmath168 ( which approaches the result with @xmath191 ) is logically close to 1 .",
    "a similar argument also explains the fact that the curves in fig.[fig:1]a are not ordered according to its values of @xmath167 for the values of @xmath168 shown in the figure .",
    "the point is that for a fixed @xmath168 , different values of @xmath167 enhance ( through the squeezing factor ) different parts of the spectrum of the integrand .",
    "therefore , the final value of the contribution to the force strongly depends on the chosen @xmath167 for a narrow bandwidth @xmath168 .",
    "however , for large @xmath168 , the enhanced parts of the integrand are very similar , independently of the chosen value of @xmath167 and the final value of the contributions approach and get ordered according to it .",
    "this can be seen at the end of the curves and it was checked for higher values of @xmath168 .    on the other hand , the behaviour of the curves for very small @xmath168 is explained by another feature of the squeezing distribution @xmath153 .",
    "as the bandwidth becomes narrower , the contribution for the modes inside it gets greatly enhanced since the squeezing parameter is given by @xmath170 .",
    "therefore , although the number of enhanced modes is lower , its contributions to the integral grow strongly .",
    "therefore , the final contributions to the force also grow , getting numerically divergent values when the bandwidth approaches zero .",
    "therefore , the ratio for the contributions of the force in the different situations tends to zero .",
    "however , it should be noted that this is in fact a numerical limitation instead of a correct result .",
    "the limit of @xmath176 is well - defined analytically .",
    "as we mentioned before , the choice of the squeezing distribution was to describe an imperfect squeezing of a mode of frequency @xmath167 characterized by a bandwidth @xmath168 , in such a way that the perfect squeezing on the mode @xmath167 only could be obtained through the limit of null bandwidth .",
    "if we like to obtain this result , we should go to eq.([continuumsinglemodesqueezedstate ] ) and set @xmath192 .",
    "then , the full calculation of the initial conditions contribution is straightforward , obtaining that it corresponds to the evaluation of the integrand at eq.([casimirforceicfull ] ) on the chosen frequency @xmath167 , which a well - defined finite result .",
    "it is clear that this value strongly depends on the chosen frequency , however it remains always finite .",
    "beyond all these features , although the final value of the initial conditions contribution to the force seems to vary significantly , it does for a small interval of @xmath168 ( until @xmath193 in unit of @xmath144 for the given curves )",
    ". then , it seems to be insensitive to the changes of @xmath168 for a wide range of values .",
    "this is because we are comparing the initial conditions contributions only .",
    "however , while the baths contributions to the total force ( based on the expelled field by the materials of the plates ) tends to separate the plates , the initial conditions contribution tends to attract them .",
    "then , the total force results from a substraction which is more sensitive to the changes of @xmath168 .",
    "this is observed in fig.[fig:1]b , where the approach to an asymptotic value ( also from below ) of the ratio of the total forces for the squeezed and thermal states occurs for values of @xmath168 four orders of magnitude larger ( until @xmath194 in units of @xmath144 approximately ) .",
    "it should be noted that for the baths in each plate , the temperatures were all equal to @xmath195 .",
    "thus , for the thermal case , the total force is the one at thermal equilibrium .",
    "contrary to what we have when comparing the initial conditions contributions separately , the curves are ordered by its value of @xmath167 . for the large-@xmath168 behaviour ,",
    "the asymptotic value is close to 1 but it is not equal to it .",
    "this shows that the ratio of the total forces is sensitive to the chosen temperature .",
    "on the other hand , the behaviour of the curves for small @xmath168 present the same troubles that mentioned for the other figure .",
    "again , the limit @xmath176 can be studied analytically .",
    "all in all , the ratio between the total forces when the initial conditions contributions are different seems to allow tuning the force by modifying the squeezing properties ( the bandwidth @xmath168 and the frequency @xmath167 ) of the field state in a wide range of values .",
    "as the ratio is smaller than 1 , the tuning could intensify the ( always attractive ) total force from a minimum value defined by the temperature of the plates .",
    "in this work we have study several aspects of the casimir forces in different out of equilibrium situations , analyzing its value in some remarkable situations , elucidating the steady dynamics of different non - trivial scenarios for the chosen model .",
    "specifically , from a conceptual point of view , we have achieved a well - defined and consistent approach for the study of the casimir forces at completely general scenarios .",
    "we developed a first - principles canonical quantization formalism for the study of the interaction between a quantum scalar field and dissipative - material polarizable bodies .",
    "these are locally modeled as complex quantum systems in each point of space , formed by a quantum harmonic oscillators describing the volume elements of the polarizable body which are coupled to its own thermal bathm , as it commonly used since ref.@xcite . in analogy to the results obtained through the ctp integral formulation given in refs.@xcite , we have obtained a full equation of motion for the field interacting effectively with the material bodies . however , as in ref.@xcite , the equation stands for the quantum field operator and ( as every heisenberg equation ) is subjected to initial conditions , which for simplicity we took as free field operators .",
    "the solution for this equation is given in terms of the green function and all the sources included in the problem that generate field due to the interactions between the different parts of the total system .",
    "it is important to remark that the interactions are switched - on at a given initial time @xmath0 , being a sudden start analog to a quench . for arbitrary time , we obtain three contributions to the field operator , each one associated to a specific part of the total system .",
    "one is associated to the volume elements , another one is associated to the baths and , finally , there is a contribution entirely related to the field initial conditions",
    ". as the parts of the total system are initially free , the field operator separate in three contributions , each one acting on the respective hilbert space ( @xmath196 ) .",
    "this splitting is critical for study the long - time limit ( @xmath1 ) of each contribution separately .",
    "we achieved expressions for the long - time contribution to the field operator of each part of the total system , showing that at the steady situation only two of them contribute to the expectation values of the energy - momentum tensor components .",
    "there is no long - time contribution from the volume elements .",
    "moreover , we showed that the baths contribution to the long - time field operator matches with the one considered in ref.@xcite from a fqed approach , while the one associated to the initial conditions have the form of the homogeneous solutions considered in previous works for other steady quantization schemes .",
    "in fact , this contribution also agree with the result obtained in ref.@xcite and the mechanism described in ref.@xcite , where this was suggested but not fully demonstrated . here",
    ", we describe clearly how the existence of infinite - size regions without dissipation for the field are directly related to a non - vanishing long - time contribution of the initial conditions . all in all , as refs.@xcite but this time from a canonical quantization scheme , our general result close a conceptual hole between the full quantum theory and the fqed approaches .",
    "the matching between both and how fqed is related to quantum fluctuations is clearly explained .",
    "once exploring the general features of the developed approach , the other main result of the work is based on taking advantage of the results obtained for the expectation values of the energy - momentum tensor components of general material configurations .",
    "we proceed to fully calculate the force between two slabs of different material and temperatures but the same width .",
    "the initial conditions contribution was evaluated for two types of states , thermal and continuum - single - squeezed . for the latter ,",
    "time - average was required to determine the value of the force and write the two cases in a unified way .",
    "then , for the squeezed case , we showed how to recover the results at ref.@xcite of the force between perfect conductor plates .",
    "however , our result is the out of equilibrium generalized version to dissipative materials and squeezed states for the field .",
    "therefore , we proceed to compare this case with the result at thermal equilibrium , taking @xmath178 . from fig.[fig:1]a",
    ", we showed that the initial conditions contribution is sensitive to the change on the bandwidth of squeezed modes @xmath168 only for small values of the bandwidth , regardless on the centering frequency @xmath167 .",
    "moreover , the contribution results insensitive when changing the temperature .",
    "nevertheless , in fig.[fig:1]b , we showed that when comparing the total force for each case , the sensitivity is increased in four orders of magnitude when changing the values of @xmath168 .",
    "we also showed that the total force is also sensitive when changing the temperature .",
    "all in all , considering a constant squeezing for given @xmath168 and @xmath167 , we showed that the change of @xmath168 allow to tune the value of the ( always attractive ) casimir force from a minimum value defined by the temperature of the plates .",
    "this could be of great interest for application in technological improvements .",
    "as a final comment , it should be noted that this results can be easily extended to the three - dimensional case , and also to the em field , where two kind of modes enter , the evanescent and the propagating . for our case of a one - dimensional scalar field",
    ", we only deal with propagating modes .",
    "however , this is left as pending work . moreover , out of thermal equilibrium forces and heat transfer can be studied from the present results .",
    "also the situation of changing suddenly the distance between the plates , which is related to the dynamical casimir effect .",
    "this can be achieved by employing the long - time field operator for a given configuration of the plates as the initial condition for a new configuration .",
    "this is also left as pending future work .",

    "we go a step further and give a demonstration for the long - time limit of this operator for a completely general case .",

    "therefore , solving the full time evolution of the contribution to the field operator of eq.([fieldoperatorgreenlaplaceannihilation ] ) implies knowing the poles configuration of all of the terms of eq.([intgretexp ] ) .",

    "in fact , as it is was pointed out in ref.@xcite , the steady situation will be determined by the poles with zero real part , i.e. , purely imaginary poles .",
    "nevertheless , the causality property implies that the poles of the laplace transform of the retarded green function @xmath40 have negative real part .",
    "the only pole with zero real part is the one at @xmath64 provided by the wronskian .",
    "therefore , the long - time limit will be defined by the poles resulting from the spatial integration .",
    "these poles are provided by @xmath260 in each region .    in first place , it turns out that if a given region @xmath261 is filled with a dissipative material ( @xmath262 ) , then @xmath260 has no poles with zero real part .",
    "therefore , those terms associated to filled regions will not contribute to the steady state , i.e. , it result vanishes in the long - time limit .    thus , in principle , only regions filled with dissipationless materials may contribute to the steady situation .",
    "in particular , the vacuum regions , where @xmath263 , and the denominator reads @xmath264 , providing its roots as candidate to poles ( @xmath265 ) . however , if an intermediate region of finite lenght is considered ( @xmath266 ) , the corresponding term after spatial integration contains a factor @xmath267 , with @xmath268 the corresponding limit of integration of the given term .",
