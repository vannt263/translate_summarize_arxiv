    "the additional @xmath21 in the mertens - euler relationship appears , because the integer @xmath21 is not included in the set of critical points .",

    "its morse cohomology is equivalent to simplicial cohomology . while this is not surprising given that the result holds in the continuum , it is crucial to have the right definitions of stable and unstable manifolds at critical points and a correct notion of morse - smale in the discrete .",
    "it turns out that these definitions can be done for general finite simple graphs regularized by their barycentric refinement .",
    "the set of morse functions might be pretty limited but if the graph is a @xmath51-graph meaning that every unit sphere is a ( purely graph theoretically defined ) @xmath54-sphere called * evako sphere * , then the notion of morse - smale pretty much looks like the one in the continuum : every critical point must have the property that @xmath55 are spheres and that the corresponding stable and unstable manifolds for two different critical points @xmath56 of index @xmath57 intersect transversely or are disjoint .",
    "this allows to define an intersection number @xmath58 of two critical points through stable and unstable manifolds and an exterior derivative just like in the continuum .",

    "the morse complex is then defined exactly as in the continuum : the vector space @xmath66 of functions on critical points of @xmath8 is filtrated by morse index : @xmath67 is the set of functions on critical points of morse index @xmath32 and admits an exterior derivative @xmath68 given by @xmath69 .",
    "morse cohomology is useful , as it is easier to compute as simplicial cohomology . in the discrete ,",
    "it is also equivalent to ech cohomology which is the simplicial cohomology of a nerve graph .",
    "the morse function does the job of triangulating the graph .",
    "we expect morse functions in the discrete to be abundant : any injective function @xmath8 on the vertex set of a geometric graph @xmath10 should have a natural extension to its barycentric refinement @xmath70 , where it is morse in the sense that adding a new vertex @xmath25 in the morse filtration @xmath23 is either a homotopy deformation or then adds a handle in form of a graph theoretical @xmath41-ball @xmath71 , meaning that the level surface @xmath72 for @xmath73 is always a graph theoretical sphere near the critical point @xmath25 .",

    "this is a well developed theory by morse , thom , milnor , smale or floer .",
    "for a general theory for finite simple graphs , we need to restrict the morse functions to a discrete class of morse - smale functions and verify that the morse cohomology obtained is equivalent to simplicial cohomology on the graph .",
    "since as just pointed out , there is always at least * one * morse function , we only have still to establish conditions under which deforming @xmath8 keeps the exterior derivative defined and the corresponding cohomologies unchanged .",

    "the * witten deformation * argument actually shows more : the heat flow of any of the deformed laplacian @xmath90 defined by @xmath8 not only defines the hurewicz homomorphism from the fundamental groups to the cohomology groups @xmath91 , it can be used to match a harmonic form representing a cohomology class with the sphere @xmath77 defined at the critical point @xmath25 of @xmath8 as in the limit @xmath92 the support of any harmonic @xmath41-form is on the union of @xmath41-spheres associated to critical points .",

    "<S> the morse inequalities link number theoretical quantities like the prime counting functions relevant for the distribution of primes with cohomological properties of the graphs . </S>",
    "<S> the just given picture is a special case of a discrete morse cohomology equivalent to simplicial cohomology . </S>",
    "<S> the special example considered here is a case where the graph is the barycentric refinement of a finite simple graph . </S>"
