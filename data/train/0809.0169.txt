    "exploring nuclei far from the stability line is one of the most actively studied fields in nuclear physics .",
    "the exotic nuclei have revealed many features of atomic nuclei that are quite different from stable nuclei .",
    "examples are the emergence of the neutron halo  @xcite and the skin  @xcite structures , the soft dipole excitations  @xcite , the modifications of some magic numbers  @xcite and the appearance of new magic numbers instead  @xcite , the onset of new regions of deformation  @xcite .",
    "these new features are strongly connected with the presence of the loosely bound neutrons and the coupling with the positive energy continuum states . under the new environment , the nuclear many - body correlations such as the pairing and the deformation could have also unique features in exotic nuclei  @xcite .    for describing multipole responses in exotic nuclei in the region of medium - heavy systems ,",
    "there have been many attempts employing the particle - hole random phase approximation ( rpa )  @xcite or the quasiparticle - rpa ( qrpa )  @xcite on top of the self - consistent hartree - fock ( hf ) or hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) mean fields .",

    "recently , low - lying rpa modes in deformed neutron - rich nuclei have been investigated by several groups  @xcite .",
    "these calculations , however , do not take into account the pairing correlations , or rely on the bcs approximation for pairing , which is inappropriate for describing the pairing correlations in drip line nuclei due to the unphysical nucleon gas problem  @xcite .    in order to discuss simultaneously effects of nuclear deformation and pairing correlations including the unbound quasiparticle states , we have developed in ref .",
    "@xcite a calculation scheme that carried out the deformed qrpa calculation based on the coordinate - space hfb formalism .",
    "the residual interaction in the particle - hole ( p - h ) channel was a simplified skyrme interaction neglecting the momentum dependence  @xcite while a deformed woods - saxon potential was employed for the mean field . in ref .",
    "@xcite , one step further was accomplished by using a self - consistent skyrme - hfb deformed mean field while the p - h residual interaction corresponding to the same skyrme force was approximated by its landau - migdal ( lm ) form  @xcite .",
    "however , the resulting energy - weighted sum rule ( ewsr ) for the isovector dipole response was not fulfilled very accurately .",
    "a full consistency between the qrpa and hfb calculations is required for a quantitative description of the multipole strengths in exotic nuclei .",
    "this means that the same effective interaction or the same energy density functional is used for both calculations .",
    "we note that fully consistent hfb+qrpa calculations with the gogny effective interaction for deformed nuclei are now available  @xcite , but the use of a harmonic oscillator basis is a drawback for describing the unique spatial structure of quasiparticle wave functions near the fermi level in neutron drip - line nuclei .",
    "we therefore develop in this article a new method for solving the skyrme - hfb - qrpa problem in deformed systems while keeping the full velocity dependence of the p - h residual interaction . the skyrme - hfb mean field",
    "is calculated in the coordinate - space representation .",
    "numerical calculations are performed in order to investigate the effects of the explicit treatment of the momentum - dependent terms of the effective interaction on the ewsr of multipole responses and on the moments of inertia of deformed neutron - rich nuclei .",
