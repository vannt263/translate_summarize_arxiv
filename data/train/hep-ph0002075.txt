    "the discovery of the @xmath1 meson ( the lowest pseudoscalar @xmath5 state of the @xmath6 system ) has been reported in 1998 by the cdf collaboration in the 1.8 tev @xmath7 collisions at the fermilab tevatron @xcite .",
    "the mass has been measured to be @xmath8 gev .",
    "the fact that the mass of the quarks of quark  antiquark systems built up by @xmath9 and @xmath10 quarks is much larger than the typical binding energy suggests that these systems are non - relativistic , i.e. that the heavy - quark velocity @xmath11 is small .",
    "the typical scales of these systems are the binding energy @xmath12 and the momentum transfer @xmath13 ; moreover , because of the non - relativistic nature of the system , @xmath14 ( for the purpouses of this discussion @xmath15 and @xmath11 can be identified with the mass and the velocity of the lightest component of the bound state respectively ) .",
    "let us call @xmath16 the scale at which non - perturbative effects become important .",
    "if @xmath17 , then the scale @xmath18 can be integrated out order by order in @xmath19 at a scale @xmath20 .",
    "the system is described up to order @xmath0 by a potential which is entirely accessible to perturbative qcd and at the leading order is the coulomb potential .",
    "non - potential effects start at order @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "this kind of system is called coulombic .",
    "non - perturbative effects are of non - potential type . in the particular situation",
    "@xmath22 they can be encoded into local condensates @xcite .",
    "this condition seems to be fulfilled by the bottomonium ground state , which has been studied in this way in @xcite .",
    "also the charmonium ground state has been analysed as a coulombic bound state by the same authors .",
    "in both cases ( but with caveats ) the non - perturbative corrections  la voloshin  leutwyler , i.e. in terms of local condensates , have been claimed to be under control @xcite .    for heavy quarkonium states higher than the ground state the condition @xmath17 is not fulfilled and non - perturbative terms affect the potential .",
    "the system is no longer coulombic .",
    "traditionally the energy of these systems has been calculated within qcd - inspired confining potential models .",
    "a large variety of them exists in the literature and they have been on the whole quite successful ( cf .",
    "@xcite for some recent reviews ) . however , the usual criticisms apply .",
    "their connection with the qcd parameters is hidden , the scale at which they are defined is not clear , they can not be systematically improved and they usually contain a superposition by hand of perturbative and non - perturbative effects .",
    "for this reason a lot of effort has been devoted , over the years , to obtaining the relevant potentials from qcd by relating them to some wilson loops expectation values @xcite .",
    "anyway , these have to be eventually computed either via lattice simulations or in qcd vacuum models @xcite . in the specific situation",
    "@xmath23 the scale @xmath24 can still be integrated out perturbatively , giving rise to a coulomb - type potential .",
    "non - perturbative contributions to the potential will arise when integrating out the scale @xmath16 .",
    "this situation has been studied in @xcite .",
    "we will call quasi - coulombic the systems described by the situation @xmath25 , when the non - perturbative piece of the potential can be considered small with respect to the coulombic one and treated as a perturbation .",
    "the only available theoretical predictions ( to our knowledge ) of the @xmath1 mass resort to ( confining ) potential models or to the lattice . in this work we will carry out the calculation of the perturbative @xmath1 mass up to order @xmath0 . we will call it @xmath26 ) may be seen as a definition of what we call here perturbative @xmath1 mass .",
    "analogous definitions have to be understood for the perturbative @xmath27 and @xmath28 masses . ] .",
    "this calculation will be relevant to a qcd determination of the @xmath6 ground state if this system is coulombic or at least quasi - coulombic .",
    "moreover , in the way we are doing the calculation , we also assume the @xmath28 and the @xmath27 to be coulombic or at least quasi - coulombic systems .",
    "the question if these assumptions correspond to the actual systems can not be settled at this point . on the other hand",
    "there is no _ a priori _ reason to rule them out .",
    "let us consider , for instance , the argument used in @xcite for the @xmath27 .",
    "lattice data show that the static potential clearly deviates from a @xmath29 behaviour for distances larger than 1 gev@xmath30 ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "therefore the @xmath27 is coulombic or quasi - coulombic if the characteristic scale of the bound state , @xmath31 , is bigger than 1 gev .",
    "if we assume @xmath32 gev and if we fix that scale on the bohr radius , @xmath33 , of the @xmath27 , @xmath34 , then we get @xmath35 gev . since this scale falls into the energy window between the mass scale @xmath36 and 1 gev , these figures are consistent with a coulombic or quasi - coulombic picture of the @xmath27 .",
    ", as we will see later on in this paper , the expansion that we get shows a still convergent behaviour . ]",
    "the main problem of the calculation of the perturbative @xmath1 mass is the well - known bad convergence of the perturbative series when using the pole mass .",
    "this is due to a renormalon cancellation occurring between the pole mass and the static coulomb potential @xcite .",
    "we handle the problem by expressing the @xmath10 and the @xmath9 pole mass in the perturbative expression of the @xmath1 mass as half of the perturbative mass of the @xmath27 ( @xmath37 ) and the @xmath28 ( @xmath38 ) respectively .",
    "this corresponds to using the quark mass in the so - called @xmath2 scheme introduced in @xcite . in this way , by expressing @xmath26 in terms of quantities that are infrared safe at order @xmath39 ( the @xmath40 perturbative masses ) , the pathologies of the perturbative series , due to the renormalon ambiguities affecting the pole mass , are cured .",
    "we will explicitly show that , in fact , we obtain a better convergence of the perturbative expansion and a stable determination of the perturbative mass of the @xmath1 , just in the energy range that the above discussion on the @xmath27 suggests to be also the relevant one for the @xmath1 .",
    "non - perturbative terms are of potential type in the quasi - coulombic situation and of non - potential type in the coulombic situation .",
    "they affect the identification of the perturbative masses @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath26 with the corresponding physical ones . if we aim at obtaining a good estimate of the physical @xmath1 mass , it is not important for each of these contributions to be individually small , as long as the sum of them in the @xmath1 mass is small . as we will discuss at the end , a picture with non - perturbative corrections to",
    "the @xmath1 mass of a not too large size ( @xmath41 mev ) seems to be consistent with the experimental data and with the potential models .",
    "the paper is organized in the following way . in the next section we set up the formalism and",
    "perform the calculation of the perturbative @xmath1 mass . in section 3",
    "we briefly discuss the non - perturbative corrections and compare our result with other determinations of the @xmath1 mass available in the literature .",
    "in order to calculate the @xmath1 mass in perturbation theory up to order @xmath0 , we need to consider the following contributions to the potential : the perturbative static potential at two loops , the @xmath42 relativistic corrections at one loop , the spin - independent @xmath43 relativistic corrections at tree level and the @xmath44 correction to the kinetic energy .",
    "we will not consider here effects due to a non - zero charm quark mass on the @xmath9 ( and the @xmath45 system ) of the type discussed in @xcite .",
