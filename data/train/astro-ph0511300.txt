    "the shear viscosity of dense stellar matter ( at densities @xmath11 g  @xmath1 ) is important for a number of astrophysical problems , including the viscous damping of oscillations in white dwarfs and in envelopes ( crusts ) of neutron stars .",
    "the total shear viscosity can be presented as a sum of various matter components . in the outer crust of a neutron star or in the core of a white dwarf , it is determined by electrons and ions , @xmath12 . in the inner crust of a neutron star",
    "it is necessary to add a contribution of free neutrons , @xmath13 . under formulated conditions ,",
    "the electrons are strongly degenerate and form an ideal fermi gas , while the ions are fully or partially ionized and form a strongly nonideal coulomb fluid or coulomb crystal . in this case",
    "the electrons become the most important carriers of heat , charge ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , and momentum .",
    "the main process of electron scattering which determines kinetic coefficients ( thermal conductivity , electrical conductivity , and viscosity ) is the scattering of electrons by ions ( atomic nuclei ) .",
    "the shear viscosity of dense stellar matter determined by electron - ion scattering has been considered in a number of papers .",
    "for example , the electron viscosity of a strongly nonideal coulomb liquid was calculated in refs . from variational principle .",
    "the results of these calculations are in good agreement .",
    "however , they were carried out neglecting the quasi - ordering of ions , which is important near the melting point .",
    "the inclusion of this quasi - ordering in a liquid together with multiple - phonon process of electron scattering in a crystal led to the disappearance of appreciable ( by a factor of two to four ) jumps in the electrical and thermal conductivities @xcite .",
    "previous calculations of the viscosity were carried out in the born approximation . however , the non - born corrections are important for calculating the electrical and thermal conductivities of the matter containing chemical elements with high charge numbers @xmath14 ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "we include these corrections and show that they are equally important for calculations of the viscosity .    while studying oscillations of neutron star envelopes , it is necessary to know the viscosity of the matter with the density @xmath15 g  @xmath1 . for @xmath16 g  @xmath1 ,",
    "the sizes of atomic nuclei become comparable to the distances between them , and it is necessary to take into account the distribution of proton charge within the nuclei .",
    "this effect was included in the calculation of the electrical and thermal conductivity by introducing form factors of atomic nuclei .",
    "such calculations have not been carried out yet for the viscosity .    in this paper , we have calculated the shear viscosity taking into account non - born corrections and the form factor of the nuclei , the quasi - ordering in a coulomb liquid , and multi - phonon processes in a coulomb crystal .",

    "various types of oscillation modes can be excited in neutron stars . generally speaking ,",
    "these oscillations carry important information on the internal structure of neutron stars .",
    "specific types of oscillations ( such as r modes ) can be accompanied by the radiation of gravitational waves .",
    "since neutron stars are relativistic objects , their oscillations should be analyzed in the framework of general relativity .",
    "the relativistic theory of oscillations was developed in a series of papers by thorne and coauthors @xcite .",
    "in particular , the rapid ( @xmath10 s ) damping of p - modes with multipolarity @xmath17 owing to gravitational radiation was demonstrated in ref .",
    "an exact inclusion of general - relativistic effects is complicated , but , in many cases , it is possible to use the relativistic cowling approximation @xcite .",
    "a comprehensive analysis of various oscillation modes and mechanisms of their dissipation was carried out in ref .",
    "we also note the recent review of stergioulas @xcite , which contains an extensive bibliography . as a rule ,",
    "oscillations with low values of @xmath18 have been considered in the literature .",
    "although neutron stars are in the final stage of stellar evolution , they can be seismically active for many reasons .",
    "possible mechanisms for the generation of oscillations have been widely discussed in the literature ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "much attention has recently been paid to r modes  vortex oscillations that can be generated in rapidly rotating neutron stars and are accompanied by powerful gravitational radiation . in addition , oscillations can be excited in neutron stars , for example , during x - ray bursts ( nuclear explosions on the surfaces of accreting neutron stars ) , bursting activity of magnetars ( anomalous x - ray pulsars and soft gamma - ray repeaters ; see , e.g. , ref .",
