    "herbig ae / be ( haebe ) stars are young stellar objects ( ysos ) of intermediate mass , characterized by large infrared excesses due to the presence of circumstellar discs , and are believed to be the more massive analogues of t tauri stars ( herbig 1960 , strom et al .",
    "the presence of discs around isolated haebe stars has been mainly inferred by modeling their spectral energy distribution ( sed ) at millimetre , submillimetre , infrared , and optical wavelengths ( e.g. , dullemond , dominik & natta 2001 ; natta et al .",
    "2001 , 2004 ; meeus et al . 2001 ; dominik et al . 2003 ; dullemond & dominik 2004 ; acke , van den ancker & dullemond 2005 ; hernndez et al .",
    "however only a few of these dust / gas structures have been ( marginally ) spatially resolved ( sizes @xmath10 2@xmath11beam ; eg . , mannings & sargent 1997 ) .",
    "as a continuation of a survey program to study the circumstellar dust / gas around isolated haebe stars ( including submillimetre wavelength co observations ) performed by dent , greaves & coulson ( 2005 ) , we have searched at the vla archive for centimetre / millimetre wavelength continuum observations toward those stars where submillimetre co emission was detected",
    ". the main goal of that search was to identify dust disc candidates which may be resolvable through future high angular continuum observations . by reducing and analyzing the available vla archive data on these sources , we have found in particular that the haebe star hd169142 is associated with strong 7  mm continuum emission ( data presented in this paper ) .",
    "the a5ve star hd169142 is a relatively nearby ( @xmath12 = 145 pc ) example of an isolated haebe star ( dunkin , barlow & ryan 1997 , van den ancker 1999 , meeus et al .",
    "it has significant far - infrared emission as well as a mid - infrared excess ( malfait , bogaert & waelkens 1998 ) , and is one of the brightest such objects at submillimetre wavelengths ( sylvester et al .",
    "the absence of large - scale nebulosity or extended molecular gas in the region suggests no nearby on - going star formation and that hd169142 is a relatively evolved haebe star .",
    "hd169142 also shows a bright and narrow submillimetre emission co line ( greaves , mannings & holland 2000 ; dent , greaves & coulson 2005 ) , as well as a narrow optical oi line profile ( acke , van den ancker & dullemond 2005 ) .",
    "these results indicate that any circumstellar disc around the star must be close to face - on , with an inclination angle of @xmath0 10@xmath13 ( dent , greaves & coulson 2005 ) .",
    "attempts to resolve the continuum emission have resulted in an upper limit to the mid - infrared disc radius of 150 astronomical units ( au ) ( jayawardhana et al .",
    "2001 ) , although there is evidence of polarized near - infrared emission extending to @xmath0 200 au ( kuhn , potter & parise 2001 ) .",
    "an unpublished submillimetre common - user bolometer array ( scuba ) map from the james clerk maxwell telescope ( jcmt ) archive shows unresolved emission at 850 and 450 @xmath9 m , with a deconvolved upper limit to the size of @xmath0 4@xmath1 ( fwhm ) ( or a radius of @xmath0 300 au ) in the dust continuum at 450 @xmath9 m .",
    "finally , observations of the 3.3 @xmath9 m feature of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) show that this emission arises from an extended region , with a size of @xmath0 @xmath14 , or 43  au ( habart , natta & krugel 2004 ) .    in this paper we present 3.5 cm and 7  mm continuum observations carried out with the vla toward the source hd169142 .",
    "we discuss in   2.1 the nature of its continuum emission at cm / mm wavelengths .",
    "in addition to the vla data , in   2.2 we compile data from the literature to construct the sed of hd169142 over a wide range of wavelengths , from radio to near - ultraviolet . in   3 we compare the sed with a grid of self - consistent irradiated accretion disc models from dalessio et al .",
    "our studies imply that a disc with mass @xmath0 0.04  m@xmath8 and a population of grains grown to a maximum radius of @xmath0 1  mm surrounding a star with an age of 10 myr can reasonably explain the main characteristics of the observed sed .",
    "the 3.5 cm and 7 mm wavelength continuum observations were carried out with the vla of the national radio astronomy observatory ( nrao ) in the b ( 2005 may 15 ) and cnb ( 2002 september 22 - 23 ) configurations , respectively .",
    "for both wavelengths , a bandwidth of 100 mhz and two circular polarizations were used .",
    "all data were reduced with the astronomical image processing system ( aips ) of nrao using standard vla procedures .",
    "the absolute amplitude calibrator was 3c286 , with assumed flux densities of 5.2 jy ( @xmath15=3.5  cm ) and 1.5 jy ( @xmath15=7  mm ) , while the phase calibrators were 1911@xmath16201 ( for the @xmath15=3.5 cm observations , with a bootstrapped flux density of 2.4  jy ) and 18210@xmath1625282 ( for the @xmath15=7  mm observations , with a bootstrapped flux density of 0.6  jy ) .",
    "cleaned maps were made by fourier transforming the ( @xmath17,@xmath18 ) data with natural weighting using the imagr task of aips .",
    "the resulting synthesized beam sizes and rms sensitivities of the maps were @xmath0 @xmath19 ( pa = 8@xmath13 ) and @xmath0 25  @xmath9jy  beam@xmath7 at 3.5  cm wavelength , and @xmath0 @xmath20",
    "( pa = @xmath21 ) and @xmath0 300  @xmath9jy  beam@xmath7 at 7  mm wavelength , respectively ( table 1 ) .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     @xmath22obtained by modeling the observed sed ( see   3 ) .",
    "the sed of hd169142 has been modeled by dominik et al .",
    "( 2003 ) using a passive disc and dust grains with size @xmath23 m . to fit the sed , dominik et al .",
    "used a power - law radial distribution of surface density , with a very steep dependence , @xmath24 ; in contrast , in the model outlined above the surface density is calculated self - consistently assuming an @xmath4-disc model and goes to a @xmath25 dependence at large radii ( dalessio et al .",
    "in addition , dominik et al . had to adopt a @xmath26 dependence for the opacity in the millimetre range , which in our case arises naturally from the grain size distribution .",
    "moreover , their predicted sed had significant silicate emission , while the large value of the grain maximum size of our adopted dust mixture consistently predict no emission in this feature . in fact , the large grain sizes , lack of silicate emission , and the low height of the wall at the dust destruction radius , all seem to suggest a large degree of grain coagulation and settling has occured in the inner disc of hd169142 .",
    "this is generally consistent with the predictions from models of the distribution of solids in proto - planetary discs ( weidenschilling 1997 ; dullemond & dominik 2004 , 2005 ) .",
    "grains are shown to grow and settle very rapidly , possibly leaving a disc atmosphere dominated by smaller dust .",
    "the small grains can be replenished through mutual collisions . however , in the case of hd169142 , the absence of silicate feature suggests that few grains smaller than @xmath27  3@xmath9 m exist in the disc atmosphere .",
    "the maintenance of relatively large grains in the atmosphere would require an efficient stirring mechanism ; alternatively the dust could be depleted in silicate for some reason .",
    "why the mm - sized grains have not settled further in such an old disc is unclear . however , the results of dullemond & dominik ( 2004 ) suggest that it is possible for a thin disc of relatively large grains to reach a semi - equilibrium state , given a suitably efficient stirring mechanism .",
    "finally , it is important to mention that the current model for hd169142 may not be unique , and that a model with a lower accretion rate ( @xmath28 yr@xmath7 ) and a smaller value of the viscosity parameter ( @xmath29 ) might be also feasible . in this sense",
    ", we also note that the slope of the model sed in the far - ir to submm range is somewhat steeper than observed , suggesting that the power - law index of the dust grain size distribution is shallower than the value of @xmath163.5 adopted here .",
    "nevertheless , as pointed out by dalessio et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , to find an unique model , additional observational constraints such as spatial distribution profiles at various wavelengths are needed .",
    "in fact , the strong 7  mm dust continuum emission reported in this paper makes this source an excellent candidate to resolve its dust disc contents both at that particular wavelength with the vla in its a configuration ( angular resolution @xmath0 01 ) , as well as with the expanded submillimeter array ( esma = jcmt+sma ) at submillimetre wavelengths .",
