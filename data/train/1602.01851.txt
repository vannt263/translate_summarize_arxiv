    "although data from the k2 mission @xcite has only been available for six months , it has already led to several notable exoplanet discoveries .",
    "for example , a sub - neptune orbiting a bright star ( using only the 9 days of engineering test data * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , three super - earths orbiting a bright m dwarf star @xcite , a disintegrating rocky planet with a cometary head and tail @xcite , two super - earth planets orbiting a nearby cool star @xcite and two additional planets orbiting the known hot jupiter host star wasp-47 @xcite . based on the campaign  1 photometry ,",
    "the first lists of planetary candidates have been produced @xcite .",
    "as part of the _ equipo de seguimiento de planetas rocosos interpretando sus trnsitos _ ( esprint ) project ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we present our radial velocity follow - up measurements of three campaign  1 planet candidates ( epic 201295312 , epic 201546283 , and epic 201577035 ) , making use of the fies @xcite , harps - n @xcite and harps @xcite spectrographs .",
    "measurements of masses for planets smaller than @xmath9 are notoriously difficult @xcite , but are of importance to constrain interior models for sub - neptune planets ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in the next section we present our analysis pipeline for k2 photometry , including aperture photometry , light curve detrending and planet search algorithms ( the python code used for the analysis is publicly available on github ) .",
    "we describe the planet characterization via spectroscopic observations in section  [ sec : spectroscopy ] , and discuss the results in section  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "unlike for the primary _ kepler _ mission , k2 photometry is primarily delivered in the form of pixel files without mission - defined aperture masks , and the task of finding planet candidates rests upon the community rather than upon the mission team . because the mission operates with only two functioning reaction wheels @xcite the pointing stability is more limited , which affects the photometric precision .",
    "correction methods make use of the center - of - light offset @xcite or use trends which are common to many stars @xcite .    we have developed a photometry pipeline consisting of the following independent modules : ( 1 ) extract aperture photometry ; ( 2 ) perform light curve detrending ; and ( 3 ) search for transits and perform time - domain transit modeling .",
    "we describe these steps in the next sections .",
    "our analysis starts from k2 pixel mask files which can be downloaded from the mast archive .",
    "we perform simple aperture photometry on these pixel masks .",
    "first we sum the flux per pixel over the full time series of the k2 campaign .",
    "subsequently , the median flux over the different pixels is calculated . as long",
    "as the field is not too crowded the median flux is a fairly good estimate of the background flux .",
    "the stellar flux can then be identified as the flux that exceeds the background flux by some predetermined threshold ( typically @xmath10 ) .",
    "we include the pixels exceeding the threshold and group them according to whether they are spatially adjacent .",
    "if two or more spatially disjoint groups are detected , the largest pixel group is selected ( the other , smaller groups are assumed to be caused by other stars and are ignored ) .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ fig : aperture ] for the three stars discussed in this work . once the aperture is selected in this way , for each time step the total flux is calculated by summing the flux of all pixels in the aperture , and the flux centroid position is calculated based on the flux - weighted mean @xmath11 and @xmath12 coordinates of the group of pixels .",
    "we also subtract the background flux , which is estimated as the median of the pixels after iteratively clipping all @xmath13 outliers .    for the light curve detrending , we use a linear fit to the centroid positions , a technique first used successfully for _ spitzer _ transit observations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and which is similar to techniques developed for k2 photometry by others @xcite . in summary ,",
    "the light curve is divided into chunks of specified length ( typically 300 data points ) , and a polynomial function of centroid position and time is fitted to the flux in each chunk .",
    "more precisely , for centroid coordinates @xmath14 and @xmath15 ( calculated relative to the mean centroid position ) , time @xmath16 , and flux @xmath17 , we fit the model @xmath18 :    @xmath19    where @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are fitting parameters . for each chunk , the light curve flux",
    "is then divided by the model to remove variability caused by spacecraft pointing variations ( which cause flux variations due to different pixel sensitivities ) as well as long - term astrophysical variations .",
    "we have compared this technique with the ones employed by @xcite and @xcite , and found the light curve quality and the transit parameters to be similar .",
    "to search for transit events we subsequently run a `` box least square '' search on the light curves @xcite , which detects periodic transit - like events .",
    "these are then visually inspected in order to check if they are indeed transit - shaped .    based on an initial analysis of the light curves and ground based imaging , interesting planets were selected for spectroscopic follow - up .",
    "bright planet candidates were observed using the fastcam ( fc ) lucky imaging camera at the 1.5-m carlos sanchez telescope ( tcs ) in tenerife .",
    "all images were bias subtracted and then shifted and co - added using fc specific software to produce a final , high snr , high resolution image .",
    "objects that appeared to be isolated , were then moved forward in the confirmation process to be observed with fies .",
    "we obtained observations ( 45 - 60 minute exposures ) with the fies spectrograph for a first detailed stellar characterization and a small number of radial velocities ( rvs ) .",
    "systems which show rv scatter less than 20ms@xmath24 are selected for further observations . for campaign  1 , these efforts were focused on epic  201295312 , epic  201546283 , and epic  201577035 .",
    "these systems were recently discussed by @xcite .",
    "epic  201577035 was validated as a genuine planet ( also called k2 - 10b in the nasa exoplanet archive ) , but high - resolution adaptive optics images conducted by these authors revealed faint stellar companions for epic  201295312 and epic  201546283 , at distances of 3 and 8 arcsec respectively .",
    "this complicates the planet validation because k2 apertures span many pixels ( see figure  [ fig : aperture ] ; each pixel measures @xmath25 arcsec )",
    ". therefore it can be difficult to be certain that the target star is truly the host of the transiting planet candidate .",
    "consequentially , @xcite were unable to validate the planetary candidates ( despite assigning false positive probabilities below @xmath26 in both cases ) .",
    "we measured rvs using the standard data reduction pipelines for the harps and harps - n spectrographs . for the case of fies we used the approach described in @xcite .    to derive stellar parameters , to measure stellar reflex motion and finally to determine the planetary mass we observed these three systems throughout spring 2015 with the harps - n spectrograph mounted on the tng on lapalma and the harps spectrograph on eso s 3.6 m telescope at lasilla .",
    "the exposure times varied between 15min and 45min for the different systems and instruments , and we used standard setups .",
    "all rvs for the three systems are available in electronic form from the apj webpage .",
    "before modeling the rvs we co - added the available spectra for each system to derive the stellar atmospheric parameters using the vwa software developed by @xcite .",
    "this approach includes systematic errors in the uncertainty estimate . for the signal - to - noise ratio in our combined spectra ,",
    "the uncertainty in the stellar parameters is dominated by this systematic noise floor rather than by photon noise , so that the uncertainties in parameters for different stars are sometimes very similar . with obtained values of the effective stellar temperature ( @xmath27 ) , the stellar surface gravity ( @xmath28 ) , and metallicity ( [ fe / h ] ) as input",
    ", we then used basti evolution tracks to infer the stellar mass , radius , and obtain an age estimate .",
    "here we used the shotgun method @xcite .",
    "in parallel we also obtained spectra with the high dispersion spectrograph ( hds ) mounted to the subaru telescope , one spectrum for each system .",
    "these spectra have been analyzed following @xcite ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "there is agreement between the set of parameters obtained with the two different data sets and methods , with one important exception , i.e.  the stellar radius of epic 201295312 ( the hds radius is @xmath29 , the vwa radius is @xmath30 ) .",
    "this is an important parameter , because any uncertainty or error in this parameter translates directly into the planetary radius and the planetary density .",
    "however , we have not been able to track down the cause for this disagreement .",
    "here we just note that the two methods agree well on all other stellar parameters and for the other systems and that for evolved stars ( such as epic 201295312 ) , different isochrones can lay close to each other , complicating the stellar characterization . because the hds spectrum has a lower signal - to - noise ratio than the combined harps - n spectrum",

    "we use the transit model by @xcite and a simple keplerian rv model .",
    "the transit model used was binned to 30 minutes , to match the integration time of the _ kepler _ observations .",
    "the model parameters mainly constrained by photometry ( see figure  [ fig : transits ] ) include the orbital period ( @xmath31 ) , a particular time of mid - transit ( @xmath32 ) , the stellar radius in units of the orbital semi - major axis ( @xmath33 ) , the planetary radius in units of the stellar radius ( @xmath34 ) , and the cosine of the orbital inclination ( @xmath35 ) .",

    ", we use @xmath42 and @xmath43 to avoid boundary issues ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "in particular we placed a gaussian prior on @xmath44 with a width of @xmath45 .",
    "the difference @xmath46 was held fixed at the tabulated value , since this combination is weakly constrained by the data . the stellar density obtained from the analysis of the stellar spectra (",

    "this impacts the confidence intervals we obtain for @xmath40 and @xmath41 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "unfortunately the harps data points have been taken after the fies and harps - n campaigns were finished .",
    "this complicates the characterization of the long term trend , as potential offsets in the rv zero points of the spectrographs could lead to biases .",
    "however , previous studies , such as @xcite ( 55cnc ) and @xcite ( hip11952 ) found that the rvs of harps and harps - n agree within their uncertainties . in this study",
