    "shapley ( 1938 ) discovered the sculptor dwarf spheroidal ( dsph ) galaxy  the first example of this type of galaxy in the vicinity of the milky way  on a plate with a 3  hour exposure time taken with the bruce telescope .",
    "shapely notes `` ... that systems such as the sculptor cluster may not be uncommon ; their luminosity characteristics would enable them to escape easy discovery . ''",
    "since the detection of sculptor , astronomers have identified eight other dsphs .",
    "sculptor is at a celestial location of @xmath11 ( j2000.0 ; mateo 1998 ) , which corresponds to galactic coordinates of @xmath12 .",
    "thus , sculptor lies nearly at the south galactic pole .",
    "kaluzny  ( 1995 ) searched for variable stars in a @xmath13 field centered approximately on the dsph by taking @xmath14 and @xmath15band images with the 1-m swope telescope at las campanas observatory over a period of more than two months .",
    "the search resulted in the identification of 226 rr  lyr stars .",
    "the average @xmath16 magnitude of the rr  lyr stars gives a distance modulus of @xmath17 , which corresponds to a heliocentric distance of 87  kpc .",
    "this estimate is practically the same as that obtained by hodge ( 1965 ) ; it is consistent with the estimate of baade & hubble ( 1939 ) , but somewhat larger than the estimate of kunkel & demers ( 1977 ) .",
    "this study adopts the estimate of kaluzny ( 1995 ) for the distance to sculptor .",
    "irwin & hatzidimitriou ( 1995 ) derives the most comprehensive set of structural parameters for sculptor  and seven other dsphs  using star counts from uk schmidt telescope plates . with a luminosity of @xmath18  l@xmath19 ,",
    "sculptor is among the most luminous dsphs .",
    "its major - axis core and limiting radii are @xmath20  arcmin and @xmath21  arcmin , respectively , which are in good agreement with the values derived by demers , kunkel , & krautter ( 1980 ) .",
    "however , they differ from the values derived by eskridge ( 1988a ) , who also uses star counts from uk schmidt telescope plates .",
    "the discrepancy is likely due to an underestimation of the central density in the latter study for reasons that are discussed in irwin & hatzidimitriou ( 1995 ) .",
    "the isopleth map of sculptor ( panel ( f ) of figure  1 in irwin & hatzidimitriou 1995 ) shows that the ellipticity of the isodensity contours increases with increasing projected radius from the center of the dsph : the ellipticity is consistent with 0 in the inner 10  arcmin and smoothly increases to a value of 0.32 in the outermost region .",
    "the study observes that sculptor `` ... looks remarkably similar to numerical simulations of dsph galaxies that are tidally distorted . ''",
    "the position angle of the major axis is @xmath22  degrees .",
    "eskridge ( 1988b ) finds asymmetric `` structure '' in sculptor in an isopleth map of the difference between the stellar surface density and a fitted 2-d model .",
    "in contrast , irwin & hatzidimitriou ( 1995 ) finds only the increase of the ellipticity with projected radius in a similar map .",
    "the left panel in figure  [ fig : fields ] shows a 30  arcmin @xmath23 30  arcmin region of the sky centered on sculptor .",
    "the dashed ellipse is the boundary of the core .",
    "walcher  ( 2003 ) studies the structure of sculptor  together with those of carina and fornax  using @xmath24-band images taken with the mpg / eso 2.2-m telescope at la silla .",
    "the images have an areal coverage of 16.25  square degrees and reach a limiting magnitude of @xmath25 .",
    "the study derives major - axis core and limiting radii of @xmath26  arcmin and @xmath27  arcmin , respectively , using a king ( 1962 ) model , as did irwin & hatzidimitriou ( 1995 ) .",
    "the 1-@xmath28 disagreement between the two derived core radii is perhaps larger than expected from two data sets that have many stars in common .",
    "the apparently more serious disagreement between the two limiting radii is most likely due only to a larger true uncertainty in the limiting radius caused by uncertainties in the background surface density and the poor fit of the model to the outer part of the surface density profile .",
    "walcher  ( 2003 ) confirms that the ellipticity of the surface - density contours increases with increasing projected radius ; the contours also suggest `` extensions '' from the ends of the major axis that are interpreted as tidal tails .",
    "the radial projected density profile shows a `` break ''  a departure from the fitted king model  at around 30  arcmin , which the study interprets as evidence for the existence of an extended stellar component .",
    "walcher ( 2003 ) uses the relation between the king - model tidal radius , the mass , and the perigalacticon of a galactic satellite developed by oh , lin , & aarseth ( 1992 ) to deduce that sculptor has a perigalacticon of 28  kpc .",
    "a recent article by coleman  ( 2005 ) does not confirm the finding in walcher  ( 2003 ) that sculptor has tidal tails and an extended stellar component .",
    "instead , the analysis of photometric data in the @xmath24 and @xmath29 bands for a @xmath30 field shows that a king model with a limiting radius of @xmath31  arcmin is a satisfactory fit to the radial profile of stars that lie on the giant branch .",
    "the limiting magnitudes of the photometry are @xmath32 and @xmath33 , respectively .",
    "the study notes that oversubtracting the field population in its data produces a radial profile with the smaller fitted limiting radius and significant extratidal structure found in walcher  ( 2003 ) .",
    "using additional information from the spectroscopy of 723 stars selected from the red giant branch , coleman  ( 2005 ) derives an upper limit of @xmath34 for the contribution from stars beyond the tidal boundary to the total mass of sculptor .",
    "the study does not find any conclusive evidence for tidal interaction between the milky way and sculptor .",
    "in contrast , westfall  ( 2005 ) does find evidence .",
    "this study uses imaging in the @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 bands to separate member giants from foreground dwarfs in a 7.82 degrees@xmath38 area that covers the eastward side of sculptor including the central region .",
    "candidate members are also selected from the region of the blue horizontal branch in the color - magnitude diagram .",
    "the selection of members is checked with spectroscopy for 147 candidates .",
    "the study finds members up to 150 arcmin from the center of sculptor  the spatial extent of the survey and beyond the tidal boundary if that is identified with the measured king limiting radius of 80  arcmin .",
    "several of these stars are spectroscopically - confirmed members .",
    "the radial surface brightness profile shows a break to a shallower slope at a radius of about 60  arcmin , which resembles the radial profiles seen in simulations of satellites interacting with the milky way ( johnston  1999 ) .",
    "thus , westfall  ( 2005 ) argues in favor of a significant tidal interaction between the milky way and sculptor .",
    "it is beyond the scope of this work to resolve the apparent conflict between coleman  ( 2005 ) and westfall  ( 2005 ) by judging the merits of the analyses presented in both articles .",
    "needless to say , a disagreement exists about the effect of the galactic tidal field on the structure of sculptor ; measuring the proper motion of the dsph may allow us to impose constraints on this effect .",
    "armandroff & da costa ( 1986 ) measured the radial velocities of 16 giants in sculptor which average to produce a systemic heliocentric velocity of @xmath39  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "this measurement alleviated the large uncertainty in this quantity , which existed due to mutually contradictory estimates from hartwick & sargent ( 1978 ) and richter & westerlund ( 1983 ) .",
    "more recently , queloz , dubath , & pasquini ( 1995 ) measured the radial velocities of 23 giant stars .",
    "the sample includes 15 stars observed previously by armandroff & da costa ( 1986 ) .",
    "the implied systemic heliocentric velocity of @xmath40  km  s@xmath1 ( after excluding two stars that are likely binaries ) agrees within the quoted uncertainties with the measurement of armandroff & da costa ( 1986 ) .",
    "our article adopts a mean velocity of @xmath40  km  s@xmath1 for calculating the space velocity of sculptor .",
    "queloz , dubath , & pasquini ( 1995 ) finds no apparent rotation of the dsph around its minor axis .",
    "tolstoy  ( 2004 ) measured radial velocities for 308 potential members of the dsph and find a systemic velocity of 110  km  s@xmath1 .",
    "there is no discussion of rotation , but figure  4 in that article shows that the velocity dispersion does not increase with radius , as would be expected if there were a net rotation larger than the central dispersion .",
    "interestingly , the study finds that the red horizontal branch stars have a more compact spatial distribution and a smaller velocity dispersion than the older and more metal - poor blue horizontal branch stars .",
    "the two most recent photometric and spectroscopic surveys by coleman  ( 2005 ) and westfall  ( 2005 ) confirm the greater central concentration of the more metal - rich stars .",
    "the two studies also find no evidence for rotation .    the mass - to - light ratio , @xmath41 , of sculptor is larger than a typical value for a galactic globular cluster",
    "; it is , however , smaller than the @xmath42s for some other galactic dsphs .",
    "armandroff & da costa ( 1986 ) derives a central @xmath43 of @xmath44 and queloz , dubath , & pasquini ( 1995 ) determines the somewhat larger value of @xmath45 , in solar units .",
    "both studies note that the measured @xmath42 does not imply unequivocal support for dark matter in sculptor .",
    "the stars of sculptor are old .",
    "fitting isochrones to the principal sequences in the color - magnitude diagram , da costa ( 1984 ) finds that the majority of the stars are younger by `` 23  gyr than galactic globular clusters of similar metal abundance provided the helium abundances and the cno / fe ratios are also similar . ''",
    "da costa ( 1984 ) also detects `` blue stragglers '' and estimates their age to be about 5  gyr under the assumption that they are `` normal '' main - sequence stars , i.e. , stars which did not acquire mass from a companion .",
    "no stars younger than 5  gyr exist in sculptor , indicating an absence of ongoing or recent star formation .",
    "however , sculptor contains hi gas .",
    "carignan  ( 1998 ) and later bouchard  ( 2003 ) detect two distinct clouds of hi that are diametrically opposite to each other almost along the minor axis and 20  30  arcmin from the center of the dsph .",
    "these clouds are within the tidal radius .",
    "the hi gas is very likely to be associated with sculptor because its mean heliocentric velocity is similar to that of the dsph .",
    "carignan  ( 1998 ) discusses mechanisms that might account for the existence of the clouds .",
    "removing the gas from the dsph by a time - dependent tidal force due the milky way is one possibility .",
    "carignan  ( 1998 ) suggests that the alignment between the proper motion vector from schweitzer  ( 1995 ) and a line passing through the two clouds supports this hypothesis for the origin of the clouds .",
    "however , if the tidal force affects the hi , it should also affect the stars and the possible signatures of tides in the stellar component of sculptor are either absent or inconsistent with the direction of the schweitzer  ( 1995 ) proper motion vector .",
    "for example , the increasing ellipticity of isodensity contours with increasing projected radius could be due to tides ( e.g. , johnston , spergel , & hernquist 1995 ) , but then the major axis should be along the proper motion vector .",
    "the possible `` tidal extensions '' reported by walcher  ( 2003 ) are at the ends of the major axis .",
    "if these extensions are a continuation of the increasing ellipticity , they also argue for an orbital plane parallel to the major axis .",
    "walcher  ( 2003 ) claims that the eastern extension bends to the south , i.e. , parallel to the minor axis and so argues that the orbital plane is aligned in the north - south direction .",
    "however , this alignment is inconsistent with the increasing ellipticity being due to the tidal force since , given the large distance of sculptor , the sun is nearly in the orbital plane and so the increasing ellipticity should be aligned with the tidal extensions .",
    "schweitzer  ( 1995 ) reports the first measurement of the proper motion for sculptor : @xmath46  mas  century@xmath1 .",
    "this value includes contributions from the motions of the sun and lsr ; this article refers to this quantity as the  measured proper motion . \"",
    "the measurement derives from 26 photographic plates imaged with a variety of ground - based telescopes using either a `` blue '' , b , or v filter .",
    "the earliest epoch is 1938 and the latest is 1991 .",
    "the study estimates , among other quantities , the perigalacticon of the implied orbit .",
    "the best estimate ranges from 60  kpc for the `` infinite halo '' potential of the milky way to 78  kpc for the `` point mass '' potential .",
    "if the perigalacticon is no smaller than 60  kpc , then the galactic tidal force has not played a significant role in the evolution of sculptor .",
    "numerical simulations of piatek & pryor ( 1995 ) or oh , lin , & aarseth ( 1995 ) show that for a typical dsph , even with a @xmath47 as low as 3 , a perigalacticon of 60  kpc is too large for tides to have an important effect .    motivated by the idea that some of the galactic dsphs and globular clusters may be pieces of a tidally - disrupted progenitor satellite galaxy ,",
    "several studies propose that they form `` streams '' in the galactic halo .",
    "lynden - bell ( 1982 ) hypothesizes that fornax , leo i , leo ii , and sculptor are members of the `` fls stream . ''",
    "majewski ( 1994 ) adds the newly - discovered sextans to the fls stream and recalculates its common plane  naming it the `` fl@xmath38s@xmath38 plane . ''",
    "the fls and the fl@xmath38s@xmath38 planes differ only slightly . in a more extensive study , lynden - bell & lynden - bell ( 1995 ) infers",
    "that sculptor may belong to one of three possible streams ( see their table  2 ) .",
    "stream # 2 contains the lmc , smc , draco , ursa minor , and , possibly , sculptor and carina ; stream # 4a contains sextans , sculptor , pal 3 , and , possibly , fornax ; finally , stream # 4b contains sextans , sculptor , and , possibly , fornax . for each stream , lynden - bell & lynden - bell ( 1995 ) calculates the expected proper motion of sculptor .",
    "kroupa  ( 2004 ) notes that the 11 dwarf galaxies nearest to the milky way form a disk with a thickness to radius ratio of @xmath48  0.15 .",
    "the article argues that the distribution expected for such nearby substructure in a cold - dark - matter universe is spherical , that the observed distribution is not , and , thus , that these objects are the tidal debris from the disruption of a larger satellite galaxy .",
    "in contrast , kang  ( 2005 ) and zentner  ( 2005 ) find that a planar distribution of nearby galactic satellites is actually common in numerical simulations of galaxy formation .",
    "a direct comparison between the results of the simulations and the distribution of nearby satellites finds that they are consistent .",
    "a test of the reality of streams or planar alignments is to measure the space motions of the satellites .",
    "piatek  ( 2005 ; p05 ) reports a proper motion for ursa minor .",
    "the implied orbit for ursa minor is not in the plane defined by kroupa  ( 2004 ) .",
    "the proper motion also rules out membership in the stream proposed by lynden - bell & lynden - bell ( 1995 ) .",
    "the measured proper motion for carina ( piatek  2003 ; p03 ) does not agree well with the predictions of lynden - bell & lynden - bell ( 1995 ) , but is not precise enough to rule out membership in a stream .",
    "piatek  ( 2002 ; p02 ) finds that a preliminary proper motion for fornax is inconsistent with the predictions of lynden - bell & lynden - bell ( 1995 ) and that its direction is also inconsistent with an orbit in the fl@xmath38s@xmath38 plane .",
    "dinescu  ( 2004 ) reports an independent measurement of the proper motion of fornax .",
    "this motion is consistent , within its uncertainty , with the predictions of lynden - bell & lynden - bell ( 1995 ) and the direction of this motion is along the great circle defined by the fl@xmath38s@xmath38 plane .",
    "dinescu  ( 2004 ) notes that the proper motion for sculptor in schweitzer  ( 1995 ) is inconsistent with the fl@xmath38s@xmath38 plane .",
    "this article reports a second independent measurement of the proper motion for sculptor and discusses the implications of the derived space motion on the dsph - galaxy interaction .",
    "section  [ sec : data ] describes observations and the data .",
    "the following section describes the analysis of the data leading to the derivation of the proper motion .",
    "section  [ sec : pmm ] compares the proper motion from schweitzer  ( 1995 ) with the one reported in this article .",
    "the next section , section  [ sec : orbit ] , integrates and describes the orbit of sculptor .",
    "section  [ sec : disc ] discusses the implications of the orbit for the importance of the galactic tidal force on the structure and internal kinematics of sculptor , for the star formation history , and for the membership of sculptor in the proposed streams of galaxies and globular clusters in the galactic halo .",
    "the final section is a summary of the main results and conclusions .",
    "the hubble space telescope ( hst , hereafter ) imaged two distinct fields in sculptor using the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis , hereafter ) in imaging mode with no filter ( 50ccd ) .",
    "each field contains a known quasi - stellar object ( qso , hereafter ) , which serves as a reference point .",
    "the left panel of figure  [ fig : fields ] depicts the locations of the two fields on the sky : two small squares  one inside and the other outside of the core .",
    "the name of the field inside the core is scl  @xmath49 , which derives from the iau designation of the qso in this field .",
    "tinney  ( 1997 ) confirms the identity of this qso : it is at @xmath50 ( j2000.0 ) , has a redshift @xmath51 , and has a magnitude @xmath52 .",
    "the observations of the scl  @xmath49 field occurred on september 24 , 2000 and on september 26 , 2002 . at each epoch , there are three exposures at each of the eight dither pointings for the total of 24 images .",
    "the `` orientat '' angle  the position angle of the y axis of the ccd measured eastward from north  is the same to within one - tenth of a degree for all of the exposures and equal to -67.5 degrees .",
    "the top - right panel in figure  [ fig : fields ] shows the scl  @xmath49 field .",
    "the qso is in the cross - hair .",
    "the name of the field outside of the core is scl  @xmath53 .",
    "the qso in this field , also confirmed by tinney  ( 1997 ) , is at @xmath54 ( j2000.0 ) , has a redshift @xmath55 , and has a magnitude @xmath52 .",
    "@xmath56 observed this field on september 13 , 1999 ; september 28 , 2000 ; and on september 28 , 2002 . at each of the three epochs ,",
    "there are three exposures at each of the eight dither pointings for a total of 24 images .",
    "the `` orientat '' angle is the same to within one - tenth of a degree and equal to -69.3 degrees for all of the exposures for this field .",
    "the bottom - right panel of figure  [ fig : fields ] shows the scl  @xmath53 field .",
    "the qso is in the cross - hair .",
    "owing to its greater distance from the center of the dsph , the scl  @xmath53 field contains fewer stars than does the scl  @xmath49 field .",
    "bristow ( 2004 ) and p05 discuss the effect of the decreasing charge transfer efficiency of the stis ccd on astrometric measurements . if not accounted for , the decreasing charge transfer efficiency may introduce a spurious contribution to a measured proper motion .",
    "bristow & alexov ( 2002 ) developed computer software which approximately restores an image taken with stis to its pre - readout condition .",
    "all of the results that this article reports are based on images restored using the program of bristow & alexov ( 2002 ) .",
    "p02 describes our method of deriving a proper motion from images taken with _",
    "hst _ and containing at least one qso .",
    "fundamental to the method is the concept of an effective point - spread function ( epsf , hereafter ) , which anderson & king ( 2000 ) describes in detail .",
    "the subsequent two articles in this series , p03 and p05 , expand and improve upon the basic method .",
    "the analysis reported here incorporates only minor new features into the method ; thus , the reader should consult those earlier articles for the details .",
    "instead , this study mentions the major elements of the method alongside figures depicting key diagnostics of the performance of the method and briefly describes the new features .",
    "equation 22 in p02 defines a `` flux residual '' diagnostic , @xmath57 .",
    "it is the measure of how the shape of the constructed epsf matches the shape of an image of an object . in the case of a perfect match ,",
    "@xmath58 ; if the epsf is narrower , @xmath59 ; otherwise , @xmath60 .",
    "several factors affect the shape of the psf for an object .",
    "1 . type of an object .",
    "a psf for a galaxy is generally wider than that for a star , all else being equal .",
    "2 . color of an object .",
    "because of diffraction and aberrations , the width of the psf is color - dependent .",
    "tilt or curvature of the focal plane .",
    "the psf varies with location because the ccd surface and focal plane do not coincide everywhere .",
    "4 . thermal expansion . because the _ hst _ moves in and out of the earth s shadow , its temperature is continuously changing .",
    "these changes cause the telescope to expand or contract , affecting its focal length .",
    "charge traps in the ccd .",
    "as the packets of charge representing an object move along the @xmath61 axis ( the direction of readout for stis ) , those on its leading side fill partially each trap encountered , so that there are fewer traps available to remove charge from subsequent packets ( bristow & alexov 2002 ) .",
    "this non - uniform loss of charge across the object changes its psf .",
    "given the aforementioned factors affecting the shape of the psf , a plot of @xmath62 _ versus _ the @xmath63- or @xmath61-coordinate of an object will , in the best case , show that the points scatter around @xmath64 . in a less desirable case , the points may show trends with @xmath63 or @xmath61 or both .",
    "these trends signal that the true psf varies with location .    because of the scarcity of stars in the observed fields , our method constructs a single and constant epsf for a given field and epoch .",
    "a constant epsf is one that does not vary with either @xmath63 or @xmath61 .",
    "figures [ fig : rf - scl1 ] and [ fig : rf - scl2 ] show plots of @xmath62 _ versus _",
    "@xmath63 ( panels in the left - hand column ) and @xmath62 _ versus _",
    "@xmath61 ( panels in the right - hand column ) for the scl  @xmath49 and scl  @xmath53 fields , respectively .",
    "the rows of panels from top to bottom are each one epoch , arranged in chronological order .",
    "the filled squares in a plot correspond to the qso .",
    "note that the number of @xmath62 values for a given object may be equal to the number of exposures  individual images  at a given epoch , or be less if the object is not measured in one or more exposures .",
    "no panel in figure  [ fig : rf - scl1 ] , except for the top - left one , shows a trend between @xmath62 and @xmath63 or @xmath62 and @xmath61 .",
    "the top - left panel shows that the mean @xmath62 decreases linearly with @xmath63 , implying that the shape of the true psf becomes progressively narrower and more peaked than that of the constructed epsf with increasing @xmath63 .",
    "we are unable to trace the origin of this dependence .",
    "the values of @xmath62 for the qso are larger than those for other objects at both epochs and are all positive , implying that the true psf for the qso is wider than the constructed epsf and than that for a star .",
    "no panel in figure  [ fig : rf - scl2 ] shows a trend as conspicuous as the one in the upper - left panel of figure  [ fig : rf - scl1 ] .",
    "nevertheless , the left - hand panel in the middle row does show a hint of variability of the true psf with location .",
    "the psf of the qso in the scl  @xmath53 is similar to that of a star .",
    "the values of @xmath62 , though still biased towards positive values , are comparable to those for bright stars .",
    "there are two reasons why the psf of a qso can be different from that of a star .",
    "1 . the underlying galaxy can broaden the image of a qso .",
    "the color of a typical qso is bluer than that of a typical star .",
    "so , particularly for the unfiltered stis imaging , the true psf is narrower for a bluer object .",
    "thus , depending on the interplay between the distance to a qso and its color , the values of @xmath62 for the qso can average more positive than , more negative than , or the same as those for a bright star . visual inspection of the qso in the scl  @xmath49 field shows what appears to be a single spiral arm or tidal feature extending from its image , suggesting that the underlying galaxy is indeed the cause of the large positive values of @xmath62 for this qso .",
    "experience with the data for other dsphs ( p02 , p03 , and p05 ) has shown that trends in the @xmath62 values with position do not necessarily produce systematic errors in the positions of objects .",
    "the next section searches for such systematic errors in the position .",
    "fitting an epsf to the science data array of an object ( the @xmath65 array of pixels representing an object ; see p02 for more detail on this array and our procedures ) determines its centroid . with 24 images per field and epoch , there can be up to 24 measurements of the centroid .",
    "the actual number will be smaller than 24 if an object is flagged out from one or more images because its array is corrupted by cosmic rays or hot pixels . the dithering , rotation , and change of scale ( e.g. , due to `` breathing '' of the _ hst _ ) between any two images cause the centroid of an object measured in these two images to differ .",
    "therefore , at each epoch , every field has a fiducial coordinate system that coincides with the coordinate system of the first image in chronological order .",
    "the adopted transformation from the coordinate system of each subsequent image to the fiducial system contains a linear translation , rigid rotation , and a uniform scale change .",
    "let @xmath66 be the centroid of object @xmath67 at epoch @xmath68 in image @xmath69 transformed to the fiducial coordinate system and the mean centroid of object @xmath67 in the fiducial coordinate system of epoch @xmath68 be @xmath70 .",
    "define position residuals , @xmath71 and @xmath72 , for an object @xmath67 as @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "ideally , @xmath75 for all @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "random noise causes @xmath71 and @xmath76 to differ from zero , but it does not cause any trends with respect to other quantities . however , systematic errors can cause such trends .",
    "anderson & king ( 2000 ) demonstrates that a mismatch between the true psf and the epsf causes @xmath71 and @xmath72 to depend on the location of a centroid within a pixel  the pixel phase @xmath77 or @xmath78 . by definition , @xmath79 and @xmath80 , where the function @xmath81 returns the integer part of the variable @xmath82 .",
    "figure  [ fig : rxry - scl1 ] plots @xmath83 and @xmath84 _ versus _ @xmath77 or @xmath78 for the scl  @xmath49 field .",
    "the plots in the panel [ rx - ry-9-scl1 ] are for the 2000 epoch and those in the panel [ rx - ry-10-scl1 ] are for the 2002 epoch .",

    "these arguments , together with the agreement within 4  km  s@xmath1 of the radial velocity of the hi and the radial velocity of sculptor make a strong case for the physical association of the clouds with the dsph .",
    "the gas is in two clouds .",
    "figure  [ fig : gas ]  shows the distribution of hi on the sky in the direction of sculptor based on the australia telescope compact array data from bouchard ( 2003 ) .",
    "the asterisk marks the optical center of sculptor and the two clouds are about 2030  arcmin from the center , one to the northeast and one to the southwest .",
    "the masses of the clouds are @xmath161",
    "m@xmath162 and @xmath163  m@xmath162 , respectively .",
    "the two clouds lie nearly along the minor axis of the dsph ; the orientation of sculptor is shown in figure  [ fig : gas ]  by the ellipse representing the optical boundary .",
    "although the association between the gas and the dsph seems well - established , why sculptor still has gas when most of the other galactic dsphs do not and the cause of the observed configuration of the gas are debated .",
    "mayer  ( 2005 ) studies the loss of gas from dwarf galaxies in the local group using numerical simulations that include ram pressure stripping .",
    "it quantifies the expected result that a galaxy with a deeper potential well or with a larger perigalacticon is more likely to retain its gas .",
    "the orbit of sculptor is similar to those of carina and ursa minor , which suggests that differences in the degree of tidal shocking or ram pressure stripping are not the reason for the difference in gas retention .",
    "however , note that the 95% confidence intervals for the perigalacticons of all three orbits are still too large to make a conclusive statement",
    ". the larger mass of sculptor compared to carina and ursa minor is the most likely reason why it was able to retain gas .",
    "mechanisms that could affect the distribution of hi within the dsph are tidal interaction , ram pressure , and forces from supernovae or winds from young stars . tidal interaction and ram pressure tend to spread the gas in the plane of the orbit .",
    "the two arrows in figure  [ fig : gas ]  represent the galactic - rest - frame proper motions as measured by schweitzer  ( 1995 ; dashed ) and this study ( solid ) .",
    "the ratio of their lengths is the same as the ratio of the magnitudes of the proper motions .",
    "the dotted line is a section of a great circle that passes through sculptor and fornax ; its position angle is 99  degrees .",
    "the schweitzer  ( 1995 ) proper motion ( dashed arrow ) is nearly aligned with the line that connects the centers of the clouds .",
    "carignan  ( 1998 ) notes this alignment and suggests that it may indicate a `` tidal '' origin for the clouds : presumably , the galactic tidal force stretches the gas , initially centered within the dsph , into its observed distribution .",
    "the most serious problem with such a picture is that the tidal force would stretch the distribution of both the stars and the gas , which then aligns the major axes of the gaseous and stellar distributions from our perspective as an observer nearly in the plane of the orbit of sculptor .",
    "they are not aligned , perhaps because the motion of the gas is governed by both gravitational forces and pressure gradients . as was noted in section  [ sec : tides ] ,",
    "if the observed ellipticity of sculptor is due to the tidal force , then the galactic - rest - frame proper motion should be aligned with the major axis .",
    "figure  [ fig : gas ]  shows that the solid arrow , our measurement , is closer to such an alignment than the dashed arrow . because the tidal force is zero at the center of a dsph , it can not by itself separate a single cloud centered on the dsph into two clouds .",
    "thus , within the context of a picture in which tides have had an important effect on sculptor , our proper motion is more plausible than that of schweitzer  ( 1995 ) .",
    "however , is our proper motion consistent with the geometry of the two clouds ?",
    "we think yes .",
    "first , the two clouds are elongated in the direction of our proper motion ( see particularly figure  1 in bouchard  2003 ) .",
    "the observed elongation could be due to ram pressure from the motion through a gaseous galactic halo .",
    "second and more speculatively , the two clouds could be due to the rayleigh - taylor instability when the hi in sculptor moves through the hot and low - density gaseous halo . or",
    "the gas could have been squeezed out perpendicular to the direction of motion by the compressive tidal shock when sculptor crosses the galactic disk .",
    "expansion combined with infall of the gas forms a ring that looks like two clouds in projection .",
    "estimates of the @xmath47 for sculptor range from @xmath164 and estimates of the limiting radius range from about @xmath165  arcmin .",
    "the estimates of @xmath42 assume that mass follows light .",
    "if this is true , then the implied mass of sculptor must be large enough , given our orbit , to produce a tidal radius that is at least as large as the observed limiting radius . equating the tidal radius and",
    "the limiting radius predicts a value for @xmath42 , which should agree with the measured value . also , the dsph must have a mass and , hence , @xmath42 large enough for it to have survived destruction by the galactic tidal force on our orbit .    in lieu of numerical simulations ,",
    "an approximate analytical approach is to calculate the tidal radius , @xmath166 , beyond which a star becomes unbound from the dsph . for a logarithmic galactic potential , @xmath166",
    "is given by ( king 1962 ; oh , lin , & aarseth 1992 ) @xmath167\\ln[(1+e)/(1-e ) ] + 1 } \\ , \\frac{m}{m_g}\\right)^{1/3 } a. \\label{eq : rtidal}\\ ] ] here @xmath168 is eccentricity of the orbit , @xmath169 is the semi - major axis ( @xmath170 ) , @xmath35 is the mass of the dsph , and @xmath171 is the mass of the galaxy within @xmath169 .",
    "equating @xmath166 with the observed limiting radius derived by fitting a king ( 1966 ) model , @xmath172 , gives a value for @xmath47 for a given orbit .",
    "if @xmath173  arcmin , then 28% of the orbits in monte carlo simulations have @xmath174 and 10% of the orbits have @xmath175 .",
    "if @xmath176  arcmin , then 100% of the orbits have @xmath177 .",
    "these results show that the global @xmath42 of sculptor is probably larger than the measured @xmath42 , if the larger of the measured limiting radii is identified with the tidal radius .",
    "the @xmath42 calculated assuming that mass follows light underestimates the true global @xmath42 if sculptor contains dark matter that is more spatially extended than the luminous matter ( e.g. , pryor & kormendy 1990 ) .",
    "however , equation  [ eq : rtidal ]  shows that @xmath178 , so the values for @xmath42 derived using this equation are sensitive to the measured value of the limiting radius . until kinematic measurements definitively identify the tidal radius , an @xmath42 derived with the above argument",
    "should be treated with caution .",
    "the average of the measured values of @xmath47 for galactic globular clusters is 2.3 ( pryor & meylan 1993 ) .",
    "could the true @xmath47 of sculptor be similar to this average ?",
    "numerical simulations by oh , lin , & aarseth ( 1995 ) and piatek & pryor ( 1995 ) show that the ratio of the limiting radius derived by fitting a theoretical king model ( king 1966 ) , @xmath172 , to the tidal radius defined by equation  ( [ eq : rtidal ] ) is a useful indicator of the importance of the galactic tidal force on the structure of a dsph .",
    "these simulations show that : if @xmath179 , the galactic tidal force has little effect on the structure of the dsph ; at @xmath180 , the effect of the force increases rapidly with increasing @xmath181 ; and , for @xmath182 , the dsph disintegrates in a few orbits . assuming that @xmath183 and @xmath173  arcmin , @xmath184 for 6% of the orbits generated in monte carlo simulations . if @xmath176  arcmin , the fraction is 100% .",
    "thus , it is possible that sculptor could have survived for a hubble time on its current orbit if it only contains luminous matter .",
    "we conclude that measured orbit of sculptor does not require it to contain dark matter .",
    "sculptor is bound gravitationally to the milky way .",
    "the galactocentric space velocity of the dsph imposes a lower limit on the mass of the milky way within the present galactocentric radius of the dsph , @xmath131 . assuming a spherically symmetric mass distribution and zero for the total energy of the dsph , the lower limit for the mass of the milky way is given by @xmath185 setting @xmath186  kpc and using the values from table  4 for @xmath126 and @xmath187 , @xmath188 .",
    "this lower limit is consistent with other recent estimates of the mass of the milky way , such as the mass of @xmath189 within @xmath190  kpc found by sakamoto , chiba , & beers ( 2003 ) .",
    "the milky way potential adopted in section  [ sec : orbit ] has a mass of @xmath191 out to @xmath186  kpc .",
    "this article presents a measurement of the proper motion of sculptor using data taken with _",
    "hst _ and stis in imaging mode . using this measurement",
    ", it derives the orbit and discusses : membership in proposed streams , tidal interaction with the milky way , the relation between the orbit and the star - formation history , the hi gas associated with the dsph , the dark matter content , and a lower limit on the mass of the milky way .",
    "the list below enumerates our findings .",
    "\\2 . removing the contributions to the measured proper motion from the motions of the sun and of the lsr",
    "gives a galactic - rest - frame proper motion of @xmath193  mas  cent@xmath1 in the equatorial coordinate system for an observer at the location of the sun but at rest with respect to the galactic center . in the galactic coordinate system",
    "this motion is @xmath194  mas  cent@xmath1 .",
    "the best estimate of the orbit shows that sculptor is approaching its apogalacticon of @xmath197  kpc on a polar orbit with eccentricity @xmath198 .",
    "the perigalacticon of the orbit is @xmath199  kpc and the orbital period is @xmath200  gyr .",
    "sculptor is not a member of streams  2 and 4a proposed by lynden - bell & lynden - bell ( 1995 ) .",
    "it could be a member of stream  4b , though the proper motion of fornax measured by dinescu  ( 2004 ) makes the physical reality of this stream doubtful .",
    "the pole of the orbit of sculptor is 26  degrees from the pole of the plane of the galactic dsphs noted by kroupa  ( 2004 ) .",
    "this difference is much larger than the uncertainty in the pole of the orbit , but is probably within the uncertainty of the definition of the plane of the dsphs .",
    "a comparison of the orbit of sculptor to those of other dsphs does not provide a clear reason for why sculptor contains hi while the others do not .",
    "the origin and distribution of hi remain puzzling .",
    "this article proposes that , while the line connecting the two clouds of hi is nearly perpendicular to our galactic - rest - frame proper motion , some combination of ram pressure , tidal interaction , and rayleigh - taylor instability could produce this geometry .",
