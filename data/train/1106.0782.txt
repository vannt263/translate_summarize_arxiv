    "black holes are born when a massive star exhausts its nuclear burning processes , leading to a runaway collapse where gravity dominates over all other interactions .",
    "they can also be produced by the merger of binary systems containing compact stellar remnants , such as neutron stars or smaller black holes .",
    "stellar collapse and binary mergers resulting in black holes are astrophysical processes where it is expected that gravitational effects are strong , resulting in regions of high curvature .",
    "observations of such processes would provide a strong test of general relativity .",
    "gravitational wave astronomy will provide a powerful tool for investigating astrophysical processes involving highly curved regions of spacetime . in the absence of external fields and matter , black hole binary mergers are completely invisible in the electromagnetic spectrum , and no light can reach observers from the interior of a massive star undergoing core collapse . in these situations gravitational waves",
    "are expected to carry away as much as a few percent of the total mass energy of the system , and can provide direct information about these otherwise unobservable events ( see e.g @xcite ) .    in this study , we focus on the gravitational wave signal produced in the final stages of the birth of a black hole , when the gravitational waves can be described using linear perturbation theory on the kerr spacetime .",
    "measurement of such waves could provide a key test of the so called `` no - hair theorem '' of general relativity .",
    "the no - hair theorem is the statement that stationary black hole spacetimes are described completely using only a few parameters , namely mass , spin , and electric charge .",
    "this theorem has been proved for the case of einstein - maxwell black hole solutions , through the uniqueness theorem for the kerr - newman black holes @xcite .",
    "thus , when a black hole is born in a merger or stellar collapse , the resulting object must radiate away all of its multipole moments @xmath0 over the course of a ringdown phase .",
    "this phase involves emission of gravitational waves in a well known spectrum of exponentially decaying frequency modes , called the quasinormal modes ( qnms ) @xcite , and also late time `` tails '' which have a power - law fall - off in time .",
    "observed deviation from qnm oscillation in the ringdown phase would be indicative that the spacetime is not represented by perturbations on a kerr spacetime , and so would be a violation of the no - hair theorem @xcite .",
    "in addition to this test , detailed study of qnm ringdown is a key component in detection of gravitational waves in the first place .",
    "accurate theoretical and numerical gravitational waveforms are necessary for the success of the method of matched filtering , which will be used to extract the faint signal from the noise in these experiments . matched filtering uses a gravitational wave template to filter the noise and determine if the wave is present .",
    "accurate modeling of the ringdown phase is then necessary to build useful theoretical templates .    in this study",
    "we focus on black hole mergers , which provide a cleaner system with definite numerical predictions , and for which the possibility of detection is higher .",
    "the recent strides in numerical relativity @xcite have allowed several groups to solve the problem of binary inspiral and merger completely for the first time ( see @xcite for recent reviews ) .",
    "such simulations have provided enormous insight into binary mergers , and indeed they can serve as a test bed for the theory of black hole perturbations , in addition to providing complete theoretical gravitational wave templates . however , the computational expense of such simulations prohibits their use in generating a large bank of templates for use in matched filtering . as such , a three stage",
    ", semianalytic approximation scheme has been developed to treat binary inspirals .",
    "this method has the advantage of reducing the computational expense for template generation . also , analytic methods help to build intuition into the physical processes of the merger .",
    "the first stage is the long , quasistatic decay of the orbit of the binary , which is treated using the post newtonian approximation to general relativity .",
    "the next phase is the rapid merger of the binary , requiring full numerical treatment ( though various methods have been employed to approximate the entire merger , e.g. @xcite ) . finally ,",
    "once the two compact objects are surrounded by a common horizon , the system can be approximated by the evolution of perturbations of the final kerr spacetime .",
    "the radiation generated in this phase is governed by the teukolsky equation @xcite .",
    "the qnm frequencies are given by the allowed spectrum of the teukolsky equation , when physically appropriate boundary conditions are imposed .",
    "the qnms are located at the poles in the green s function of the radial teukolsky equation , and are found using a variety of methods ( see e.g. @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "generally , it has been assumed that the qnms make up the entire spectrum of oscillations during the ringdown phase after merger .",
    "here we seek a new frequency , characterized by the properties of the kerr horizon .",
    "we are inspired by a study by mino and brink @xcite , which investigated the radiation of a point particle falling into a kerr black hole , using a near horizon expansion to find the radiation analytically .",
    "as the infalling particle approaches the horizon , its trajectory in boyer - lindquist coordinates asymptotes to pure angular motion around the black hole with frequency @xmath1 , @xmath2 here @xmath3 is the spin parameter , @xmath4 is the mass , and @xmath5 is the boyer - lindquist radius of the outer horizon . from the viewpoint of an observer at infinity ,",
    "the particle is frozen at the horizon , corotating with it and sourcing radiation at its rotation frequency .",
    "calculations by mino and brink show that the radiation arrives at future null infinity with an exponential decay , @xmath6 here @xmath7 encodes the out - going radiation , as discussed fully in section ii , and @xmath8 is the azimuthal quantum number of the radiation .",
    "the decay rate @xmath9 is the surface gravity , given by @xmath10 the frequency here does not depend on details of the particle s energy and momentum , because the particle s late - plunge trajectory is essentially universal in the boyer - lindquist coordinate system .",
    "this suggests that this oscillation mode , the `` horizon mode , '' may be more general than this single case considered by mino and brink .",
    "if we take the naive point of view that the late stages of the merger can be approximated by gravitational perturbations falling onto a final black hole , then we have a situation where the infalling perturbations will source out - going waves like point particles .",
    "though this viewpoint is crude , it does suggest a search for this new frequency mode in post - merger ringdowns .    in this paper we will argue for the existence of a horizon mode ( hm ) with a frequency of @xmath11 and a decay constant which we find to be an integer multiple of @xmath12 .",
    "we find that the particular decay rate depends on our model for how the spacetime transitions from the nonlinear merger into the regime of first order perturbations on the kerr spacetime .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : section iia provides a simple argument for the presence of this frequency . in section",
    "iib we derive this mode through a direct construction , using a simple model for the transition from merger to ringdown . in section iic , we explore the consequences of a different model for the transition . in section iii ,",
    "we reconcile our results with those of mino and brink . in order to test the utility of this new hm , in section",
    "iv we use the hm in combination with the qnms to fit a waveform generated by full numerical general relativity , and compare fits that include the hm to fits with the qnms alone .",
    "we first present a heuristic argument for the presence of a hm analogous to that of equation in the solutions to the teukolsky equation .",
    "we then derive the hm by evolving initial data for the teukolsky equation in a near horizon approximation .",
    "finally , we investigate the consequences of a different model for the transition of the spacetime into the regime of linear perturbation theory .      in the boyer - lindquist ( bl ) coordinate system , the components of the weyl tensor which represent out - going perturbations of the kerr spacetime are represented compactly by the newman - penrose curvature scalar , @xmath13    note that we use a metric signature of @xmath14 , and use the appropriate conventions of @xcite for newman - penrose ( np ) quantities such as @xmath7 .",
    "we use the kinnersley null tetrad @xcite , @xmath15 where @xmath16 and the overbar represents complex conjugation .    with these choices , @xmath7 satisfies a separable linear wave equation @xcite , and can be written as @xmath17 here , @xmath18 are the spin - weighted spheroidal harmonics @xcite , with the appropriate spin weight for @xmath7 , @xmath19 . in the limit @xmath20 ,",
    "they reduce to the spin - weighted spherical harmonics @xmath21 .",
    "the radial function @xmath22 is the solution to the radial teukolsky equation @xcite .",
    "note that @xmath7 vanishes in the background kerr spacetime , and its perturbed value is independent of tetrad perturbations and gauge transformations .",
    "we can see the relationship between the scalar @xmath7 and the out - going gravitational waveform via its asymptotic form near future null infinity . in this limit , for asymptotically flat spacetimes ( see , e.g. @xcite ) ,",
    "@xmath23 here the @xmath24 and @xmath25 indicate the polarization of the gravitational waves",
    ".    in the bl coordinates , using the kinnersley tetrad , the asymptotic behavior near the horizon of the two homogeneous radial solutions are @xmath26 with @xmath27 .",

    "one of these two solutions is selected out as unphysical , based on its behavior near the event horizon . here",
    "we repeat an argument first presented by teukolsky @xcite .",
    "we demand that fields neither vanish exactly nor diverge at the horizon when measured by a physical observer . near the horizon",
    ", the trajectory of any freely falling observer will approximately match that of an in - going null geodesic ( see e.g. @xcite ) , independent of the observer s energy or angular momentum , with @xmath32 this means that for distant observers , the infalling trajectory does not appear to enter the horizon , but instead asymptotes to it while circulating around the horizon with a constant frequency .",
    "a more natural set of coordinates is in - going kerr coordinates , @xmath33 , where @xmath34 , and @xmath35 .",

    "however , even in these coordinates , the kinnersley tetrad used to define @xmath7 becomes singular at the horizon .",
    "this can be repaired by using a lorentz transform to boost into the reference frame of an infalling observer who carries a nonsingular tetrad , namely @xmath38 here the subscript `` in '' indicates the regular in - going tetrad .",

    "the second diverges at the horizon , and so is selected as unphysical . in other words ,",
    "if waves emerge from the horizon , then the in - going observers will see a diverging curvature due to blueshift effects .",
    "note that while it is a particular observer that carries the tetrad of equation near the horizon , these general results hold for all physical observers .",
    "this is because the tetrad that another physical observer carries can be related to that in equation through nonsingular lorentz transformations .",
    "however , if the frequency @xmath43 is complex , this divergence can be removed . to see this , we let @xmath44 , and seek an appropriate @xmath45 ( the real part of the frequency is chosen so that the observer does not measure increasingly rapid oscillations when approaching the horizon ) .",
    "we note that near the horizon , @xmath46 . for the physical observer , then ,    @xmath47    we see from this that if @xmath48 this solution remains regular at the horizon , and the solution decays along the observer s worldline in just such a way that the growth is compensated for .",
    "this particular frequency is selected out by a physically allowed solution of the teukolsky equation , and so we must consider its place in the usual qnm spectrum .",
    "modes with @xmath49 decay exponentially for the physical observer . in this sense ,",
    "the decay rate of equation gives the least damped , physically reasonable mode in this simple argument .      with our heuristic argument in hand",

    "physically , we postulate that just after the merger of the binary , the perturbations are concentrated in a small region near the horizon , so that the initial data used in the green s function evolution only has support in a small region near the horizon .",

    "this indicates that the corresponding decay rate of the waves as @xmath72 is that of equations - .",
    "however , this argument lacks the detailed calculations of mino and brink , who found a mode with a slower decay rate . under examination",
    ", however , it is an error in @xcite which leads to a mode with a spuriously low decay rate .",
    "we discuss this in the next section .",
    "we turn now to the study by mino and brink , which we abbreviate as mb . in this study ,",
    "the source term is evolved using the green s function method much as section ii of our study , resulting in an integrand for the integral which has a pole at @xmath127 , i.e. equation ( mb 3.7 ) . the pole then selects out this oscillation frequency for the out - going radiation at infinity .",
    "however , it turns out that this pole is canceled out by terms in the amplitude @xmath124 , when an error in mb is corrected for .",
    "we find this error in going from ( mb a14 ) to ( mb b4 ) .",
    "the first equation gives a piece of the fourier decomposition of the source term @xmath133 , and is drawn from @xcite , equations ( 2.21 ) and ( 2.25 ) therein .",
    "taking the leading order contribution of ( mb a14 ) , we find that ( mb b4 ) should read at leading order @xmath173 \\nonumber \\\\   & & \\times \\frac{r_+ - i a \\cos \\theta_0}{r_+ + i a \\cos \\theta_0 } \\sin^2 \\theta_0 s_{\\sub } \\epsilon^{-1 } \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath174 is the value of @xmath175 that the point particle asymptotes to on the horizon , and @xmath176 contains information on the particle s constants of motion . this equation differs from mb by the factor of @xmath177 in front of the term @xmath178 .",
    "when this difference is accounted for , we have for ( mb 3.6 ) @xmath179 the first root of @xmath124 then cancels the pole in the denominator of ( mb 3.7 ) .",
    "it also appears that the second root removes the frequency mode our rough argument in section iiia suggests .",
    "however , holds only to first order , and at second order there are additional terms not proportional to these roots . while a second surprising cancellation can only be ruled out by a careful study of the mb analysis at second order ( or an equivalent formulation ) , it would seem unlikely that the next order of frequency mode would vanish as well .",
    "such a careful study goes beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "however , investigation does indeed show that at second order there is a hm with a decay rate of @xmath180 @xcite .",
    "( dashed ) and the first four qnms , with @xmath181 ( solid).,width=3 ]     ranges in the overlap integral . here",
    "we give both the real ( solid ) and imaginary ( dashed ) portions of @xmath182.,width=324 ]    in the previous sections we argued for the presence of a hm in the ringdown spectrum . in this section",

    "we use the publicly available waveform generated by scheel _ et .",

    "first we compute the overlap between the final portion of the numerical waveform and either a combination of qnm oscillations , or a combination of qnm oscillations and the hm , in order to see if the given combination is a good fit to the waveform .",
    "next , we use a best - fit of the overlap to extract the mass and spin of the black hole from the waveform .",
    "again , we compare the extraction using just the qnms with an extraction which includes the hm .    for our hm , we focus on the less damped of the two frequencies discussed in section ii , @xmath183",
    ". this mode agrees with the frequency mode from the point particle plunge discussed in section iii , and also from the more physically motived model of the perturbed black hole s transition into the linear perturbation regime , discussed in section iic . throughout this section",
    "we will discuss only the dominant @xmath184 , @xmath185 mode in the spherical harmonic decomposition of the waveform .",
    "note that , because of the rotation of the kerr black hole , there is a zeeman - like splitting of the qnms into modes which corotate with the black hole and modes which counter - rotate with the hole .",
    "the counterrotating mode frequencies are equivalent to the @xmath186 qnm frequencies , but with a negative real part of the frequency , @xmath187 ( see @xcite for a detailed discussion ) .",
    "each additional overtone we consider in the numerical analysis in the following sections thus adds two distinct modes .",
    "figure [ fig : frequencyplot ] compares the real and imaginary parts of @xmath92 with those of the first four qnm for @xmath184 ,   @xmath185 ( corotating modes ) and @xmath186 ( counterrotating modes ) , as a function of @xmath188 .",
    "these qnm frequency values are drawn from @xcite and calculated using the methods discussed in @xcite , whose values are used throughout this study .",
    "note also that while many studies refer to @xmath189 as the slowest decaying qnm , here we count overtones from @xmath122 .",
    "the corotating qnms generally have a higher frequency than the hm , and the first two qnms have slower decay rates .",
    "the third corotating qnm has a comparable decay rate , and the fourth decays faster than the hm .",
    "meanwhile , the counterrotating qnms decrease in frequency with increasing @xmath188 , until they oscillate slower than the hm .",
    "the decay rates of the counterrotating qnms also remain nearly constant over the whole range of @xmath188 , and so in this case the third and fourth qnms both decay more quickly than the hm over a large range of @xmath188 .",
    "as @xmath188 goes to zero , @xmath92 ceases to drive oscillations , and the hm simply decays exponentially .",
    "also , we see that as @xmath188 goes to zero , the degeneracy between co and counterrotating modes is restored .",
    "finally , in table [ t : qnms ] we give numerical values for the qnms , evaluated at @xmath190 for the final , merged black hole whose spectrum we study @xcite ( in units of the initial adm mass of the binary ) , as well as the value of the hm at this spin parameter .",

    "using two methods , we have found an additional ringdown mode for the kerr black hole .",
    "this hm depends only on the fundamental properties of the black hole : it oscillates at the horizon frequency of the black hole , and decays at a rate proportional to the surface gravity of the black hole .",
    "it will arise when generic initial perturbations source linear gravitational radiation , a situation that would occur as the spacetime transitions from a regime of stronger , nonlinear perturbations into a final ringdown phase .",
    "this occurs at the last stage of a compact binary merger , or stellar core collapse resulting in a black hole .",
    "we emphasize that this mode is not in the qnm spectrum which is generally taken as the complete spectrum for the ringdown of a black hole . at the same time , this oscillation mode is part of what is normally considered the `` ringdown '' phase of an event that results in a final black hole , since it arises in linearized perturbation theory about the final black hole .",
    "in fact we have discussed two possible decay rates for the hm , each dependent on our model of how the spacetime transitions from nonlinear evolution into the linear regime .",
    "one mode , found using a naive model of transition at a set time slice , decays rapidly .",
    "the second was found by noting that nonperturbative regions of the spacetime should be bounded by in - going and out - going characteristics , and is physically better motivated .",
    "it has a decay rate @xmath201 , approximately the same decay rate as the @xmath202 qnm .",
    "we find that this mode has the same influence on overlap calculations as the @xmath203 pair of qnms , though it does not appear to improve parameter extraction over the use of an additional qnm pair with @xmath204 .",
    "due to its comparable decay rate to the @xmath205 qnms , it should be considered in the construction of waveform templates that use @xmath206 qnms .",
    "the hm should also be included as part of the ringdown spectrum when considering the potential use of an observed ringdown signal as a test of the no - hair theorem .",
    "otherwise , the presence of this non - qnm oscillation in the spectrum might lead one to conclude that the signal was emitted from an object other than a kerr black hole .",
    "the analytic approach presented here also builds some intuition into the origin of various frequency modes of linear perturbations of the kerr spacetime .",
    "the hm studied here arises when the influence of perturbations near the horizon are considered .",
    "integration of these initial perturbations using the green s function approach results in the presence of a pole in the frequency integral of equation .",
    "this mode depends only on the properties of the black hole which govern its near horizon geometry .",
    "meanwhile , the usual qnms arise because of the poles in the wronskian of the radial green s function , equations - . in our model , these modes arise due to the interaction of the initial perturbations with the complicated potential of the wave equation present further from the event horizon , a situation analogous to that explored for schwarzschild black holes by price @xcite . in this work , decaying perturbations on the surface of a collapsing star",
    "are associated with out - going radiation ; comparison of our results with @xcite indicates that our hm is associated with the decaying mode at the stellar surface , but that the rotation of the kerr black hole in our case guarantees that this mode oscillates with the horizon frequency in addition to its simple decay .",
    "we have also reviewed the problem of gravitational radiation from a point particle infalling near the horizon .",
    "previous work @xcite both motivated this study and guided our investigation .",
    "however , our results conflict with those of the motivating study . in investigating this discrepancy",
    ", we have found an error in the original calculation of @xcite , the correction of which cancels the first order results for the radiation at infinity .",
    "we have also argued that the form of the next order correction agrees with our results for vacuum perturbations .",
    "we leave the detailed calculation of the correct second order terms to a future study @xcite .    future study using a variety of numerical waveforms will be key in determining the importance of the hm in template generation and gravitational wave detection . in a simulation where the excitation of slowly decaying qnms is suppressed , we would expect the hm to be a clear component of the ringdown .",
    "future study of how one might suppress this qnm excitation would be valuable , and such simulations would provide the best testing ground for the presence of the hm in numerical simulations .",
    "in addition , the properties of the near horizon region , the hm itself , and the regularity conditions on the initial data discussed here may be of interest in the mathematical study of the stability of the kerr black hole ( see e.g. @xcite and the references therein ) .",
