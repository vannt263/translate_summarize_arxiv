    "there are however some phenomena which are difficult to explain in this framework , such as the matter abundance of our universe .",
    "we need therefore a new physics beyond the sm to explain them .    as an efficient way to probe the new physics",
    ", we have the electric dipole moment ( edm ) of @xmath0hg atom .",
    "the edm is an observable sensitive to the violation of parity and time - reversal symmetry .",
    "the current experimental data of the @xmath0hg atomic edm are very accurate ( @xmath1 ) @xcite . the sm contribution to the @xmath0hg edm",
    "is known to be very small ( @xmath2e cm ) , which renders it an excellent probe of new physics .    among the new physics candidates , the supersymmetric extension of the sm , the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) is the most leading .",
    "the supersymmetric extension of the sm allows baryon / lepton number violating interactions , so we must impose the _ r - parity _ ( @xmath3 ) to forbid them .",

    "the purpose of this discussion is then to analyze the _ one - loop level _ contribution of the rpvmssm to the p- , cp - odd four - quark interaction to obtain bounds on the rpv couplings .",
    "our talk is organized as follows .",
    "we first briefly review the r - parity violation and calculate its contribution to the atomic edm at the one - loop level , then compare it with the new experimental data to obtain bounds on rpv couplings and finally summarize our results .",
    "in the first step we construct the p- , cp - odd four - quark interaction at the one - loop level within rpvmssm . the rpv lagrangian used in this discussion",
    "is given as follows : @xmath4 with @xmath5 . here",
    "the indices @xmath6 denote the generations and the sum over them is taken .",
    "many of these rpv interaction terms are constrained phenomenologically @xcite .    by considering these rpv interactions",
    ", we can construct the one - loop contribution to the p- , cp - odd four - quark interaction . in enumerating the diagrams",
    ", we must exclude those which can be neglected or need not be taken into account : vertex corrections ( renormalization of the tree level rpv coupling ) ; diagrams with the same rpv couplings as the tree level ( small , since constrained at the tree level @xcite ) ; diagrams with yukawa couplings of the 1st or 2nd generation ( small contribution ) . with these rules",
