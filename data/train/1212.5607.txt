    "one way to simulate magnetism for cold atoms is to set the complete system in uniform rotation around a fixed axis  @xcite .",
    "this approach , however , is severely limited in experiment as it requires , for example , axial symmetry which is not present in optical lattice experiments .",
    "recently , it was experimentally demonstrated that artificial gauge potentials for cold atoms may also be generated using laser beams  @xcite .",
    "the atom experiences an effective gauge field due to light - induced couplings between different atomic internal states .",
    "this leads to a dressed basis of states , and if the atom - light coupling is spatially modulated the moving atom picks up a geometric phase  @xcite .",
