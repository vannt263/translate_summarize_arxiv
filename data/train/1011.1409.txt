    "in the standard model(sm ) , the fermions and gauge bosons get masses through higgs mechanism with a single weak - isospin doublet higgs field . after the electroweak symmetry breaking",
    ", three goldstone modes are absorbed to build up the longitudinal w and z gauge bosons , and only one physical scalar called the sm higgs boson is physical .",
    "since the exact breaking mechanism is not very clear and the higgs havent been detected yet , many extension models have been proposed .",
    "one of the simplest extension of the sm is to add an extra higgs doublet motivated from spontaneous @xmath0 violation(scpv)@xcite .",
    "it has been shown that if one higgs doublet is needed for the mass generation , then an extra higgs doublet is necessary for the spontaneous @xmath0 violation to explain the origin of @xmath0 violation in sm .",
    "in such a model , the @xmath0 violation is originated from a single relative phase of two vacuum expectation values , which not only gives an explanation for the kobayashi - maskawa @xmath0-violating mechanism@xcite in the sm , but also leads to a new type of @xmath0-violating source@xcite .",
    "such a two higgs doublet model(2hdm ) is also called type iii 2hdm to distinguish from the type i and ii 2hdm .",
    "the common feature of the three types 2hdm is that after @xmath2 gauge symmetry spontaneous breaking , there are three neutral higgs and one pair charged higgs . as shown in our previous work@xcite , the neutral higgs bosons decay to @xmath3 when their mass are light , which is difficult to be detected due to the strong background at the lhc .",
    "therefore the charged higgs boson ( @xmath4 ) is of special interest , since there are no charged scalars in the sm and thus its discovery would constitute an indisputable proof of physics beyond the standard model . thus the hunt for charged higgs bosons will play a central role in the search for new physics at the lhc experiments .",
    "currently , the limit or constrain to the charged higgs mass is not very strong and is also model - dependent .",
    "the best model - independent direct limit from the lep experiments is @xmath5 ( 95% cl)@xcite with assuming only the decays @xmath6 and @xmath7 . and as the charged higgs will contribute to flavor - changing neutral currents(fcnc ) at one loop level , the indirect constrain can be extracted from b - meson decays . in type ii model ,",
    "the constraint is @xmath8 for @xmath9 larger than 1 , and even stronger for smaller @xmath9@xcite .",
    "however , as the phases of the yukawa couplings in type iii model are free , @xmath10 can be as low as 100gev@xcite . in this note",
    "we take it as free from 150gev to 500gev .    at the lhc ,",
    "the interesting channels for the charged boson production are @xmath11 for @xmath12 and @xmath13 for @xmath14 @xcite.in these channels , the leptonic decay @xmath15 seems most promising for detecting light charged higgs , while the hadronic decay @xmath16 may be hopeful above threshold with efficient b - tagging @xcite .",
    "another interesting channel is to produce the @xmath17 in association with @xmath1 bosons , and the leptonic decays of the w - boson can serve as a trigger for the @xmath4 boson search .",
    "this channel can also cover the transition region search , @xmath18 .",
    "the dominant channels for @xmath19 production are @xmath20 at tree level and @xmath21 at one - loop level .",
    "@xmath19 production at hadron colliders in type ii 2hdm and mssm has been extensively studied in @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 violation effect is also explored at muon collider @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we will study it in the type - iii 2hdm with spontaneous @xmath0 violation(scpv ) @xcite .",
    "the discovery of relative light charged higgs boson with @xmath22 distinguishes from the type ii 2hdm .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the section",
    "ii , we shall first give a brief introduction of the 2hdm with scpv and some conventions .",
    "then calculations are outlined in section iii and numerical results are shown in section iv .",
    "finally , we come to our conclusions .",
    "we begin with a brief introduction to the model by showing the spontaneous cp violation and its difference to type i and type ii models .",
    "the two complex higgs doublets are generally expressed as @xmath23 and the potential is @xmath24 + [ ( \\lambda_{6}\\phi_{1}^{\\dagger}\\phi_{1 } + \\lambda_{7 } \\phi_{2}^{\\dagger}\\phi_{2})(\\phi_{1}^{\\dagger}\\phi_{2 } ) + { { \\rm h.c } } ] .",
    "\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath25 non - zero and real , cp violation can arise from non - zero values of one or more of @xmath26 , @xmath27 or @xmath28 . if these three ( and @xmath25 ) are all real , cp violation can occur spontaneously @xcite when @xmath29 , because of the relative phase between the vacuum expectation values .",
    "the most interesting case is that only the dimension-2 term @xmath26 is complex , which is known as a soft cp - violating phase",
    ". then it can easily be demonstrated that once all other couplings in the higgs potential are required to be positive real , the relative cp - violating phase of two vacuum expectation values is solely determined by the explicit soft cp - violating phase@xcite via the minimal conditions of higgs potential . in this case , the cp violation remains originating from the spontaneous breaking of symmetry in vacuum , while it can avoid the so - called domain - wall problem .",
    "the yukawa interaction terms have the following general form @xmath30 where @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are all real yukawa coupling constants to keep the interactions @xmath0-invariant .",
    "the above interactions may lead to flavor - changing neutral currents(fcnc ) at the tree level through the neutral higgs boson exchanges as the yukawa matrices may not be diagonal .",
    "fcnc processes should be strongly suppressed based on the experimental observations .",
    "usually , an _ ad hoc _ discrete symmetry @xcite is often imposed : @xmath35 which correspond to type - i and type - ii 2hdm relying on whether the up- and down - type quarks are coupled to the same or different higgs doublet .",
    "some interesting phenomena for various cases in such types of models without fcnc have been investigated in detail in @xcite . when the discrete symmetry is introduced in the potential eq.([eq : potential ] ) , it leads to @xmath36 and @xmath37 and then no spontaneous @xmath0-violation any more @xcite .",
    "since the fcnc is observed in experiments in the weak interactions though it is strongly suppressed , we shall abandon the discrete symmetry and consider the small off - diagonal yukawa couplings . the naturalness for such small yukawa couplings",
    "may be understood from the approximate global u(1 ) family symmetries @xcite . as if all the up - type quarks and also the down - type quarks have the same masses and no mixing , the theory has an u(3 ) family symmetry for three generation , while when all quarks have different masses but remain no mixing , the theory has the @xmath38 family symmetries and the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa quark - mixing matrix is a unit matrix , in this case both the direct fcnc and induced fcnc are absent . in the real world , there are some fcnc processes observed , thus the u(1 ) family symmetries should be broken down .",
    "as all the observed fcnc processes are strongly suppressed , the theory should possess approximate u(1 ) family symmetries with small off - diagonal mixing among the generations . in this sense , the approximate u(1 )",
    "family symmetries are enough to ensure the naturalness of the observed smallness of fcnc .    as in the potential eq.([eq : potential ] ) , the neutral higgs bosons will get the vacuum expectation values as follows @xmath39 where one of the phases can be rotated away due to the global u(1 ) symmetry in the potential and yukawa terms . without losing generality , we may take @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "it is then convenient to make a unitary transformation @xmath42 where @xmath43 . after making the above transformation and redefining the @xmath44",
    ", we can re - express the higgs doublets as follows : @xmath45 with @xmath46 and @xmath47 which is the same as in the standard model .",
    "thus in this new basis , only the higgs doublet @xmath48 gives masses to the gauge bosons , quarks and leptons .",
    "the higgs field @xmath49 are the goldstone particles absorbed by the gauge bosons , while @xmath17 are mass eigenstates of the charged scalar higgs .",
    "@xmath50 are the neutral higgs bosons in the electroweak eigenstates . in general , they are not the same as the physics higgs bosons @xmath51 in the mass eigenstates , but related via an orthogonal so(3 ) transformation @xmath52 where @xmath53 depends on the @xmath54 and @xmath55 in the higgs potential . when there is no mixing between @xmath56 and @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 are then corresponding to @xmath60(cp - even ) and @xmath61(cp - odd ) in the literature , respectively . for later discussion convenience , we will denote the mixing angle @xmath62 of @xmath63 and @xmath59 by meaning that @xmath64 in the new basis of eq.([eq : higgs ] ) , the yukawa interaction terms in eq.([eq : oyukawa ] ) , can be re - expressed as @xmath65 where @xmath66 and @xmath67 are fermion mass matrices .",

    "it is convenient to parameterize the yukawa couplings @xmath87 by using the quark mass scales@xcite , @xmath88 where the @xmath89 are the flavor indexes(for @xmath90 and for @xmath91 ) . and",
