    "thermal transport in nanostructured semiconductor systems is important for the continued development of nanoscale electronics.@xcite a number of recent experimental@xcite and theoretical@xcite studies contributes to an emerging understanding of interesting science issues and potential technology problems . opto- and",
    "power - electronics devices generate significant heat that must be dissipated to avoid degradation of the device performance,@xcite and similar problems increasingly affect also more standard electronics applications .",
    "the thermal transport in semiconductor structures is dominated by phonons and measurements on bulk samples would indicate excellent thermal transport properties due to the material hardness and purity .",
    "however , typical device designs involve necessary nanostructuring , for example , the construction of material heterostructures that define quantum wells or traps a transport channel below an oxide and above a doped substrate .",
    "the associated formation of interfaces is documented to effectively suppress the thermal transport both parallel @xcite and perpendicular  @xcite to the materials boundaries due to the phonon knudsen flow  @xcite and the phonon reflection  @xcite effects , respectively .",
    "both types of interface mechanisms lie outside the traditional fourier analysis@xcite of heat conduction but produce a suppression of the effective thermal conductivity within a region extending to about one phonon mean - free path @xmath1 from the interface .",
    "the interface impact of scattering can even cause crossovers in the nanostructure conductivity such that a material with high bulk thermal conductivity is not necessarily the best thermal conductor upon nanostructuring.@xcite while thermal - conductivity suppressions can work to improve the efficiency of both thermoelectric and thermoionic cooling,@xcite room - temperature estimates,@xcite @xmath2 , also testifies to some adverse effects even for present devices .",
    "worse , the quest to nanosize modern electronics can only exacerbate the thermal dissipation problems@xcite since the increase in packing density simultaneously will produce a further degradation in the effective thermal - transport properties .",
    "in this paper we illustrate the general nature of this knudsen effect on the effective lattice thermal conductivity of semiconductor devices by documenting the effects on two simple sample structures : thin semiconducting wire@xcite and multilayered systems,@xcite fig .  [ layer ] .",
    "semiconductor wires and layers represent examples of semiconductor nanostructures that are interesting in themselves .",
    "they can also be viewed as typical building blocks in general semiconducting devices that typically have transport channels sandwiched between an oxide and substrate .",
    "figure  [ layer ] shows schematics of both types of nanostructures ; the light regions in the schematics represent the transport active systems of high thermal conductivity while the dark regions illustrate the processed surrounding which may be oxides or heavily doped materials . in both systems the oxide or the dopants will inhibit or limit the thermal transport in the processed regions and move the phonon transport to the transport active wire or layer .",
    "however , the interface scattering suppresses the thermal transport even in the ( pure ) transport channel where the scattering causes a knudsen flow.@xcite    we obtain analytical results for the thermal - transport suppression given by special functions in both the wire and ( multi)layer cases .",
    "the analytical results hold exactly when the phonon mean - free path @xmath1 can be approximated as constant@xcite and simplify the thermal - transport calculations for wires and multilayers to simple frequency integrals in the more general case when @xmath1 depends on mode @xmath3 and momentum @xmath4. we thus extend previous investigations@xcite by efficient evaluations of the wire and layer thermal conductivities @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and by ( analytical ) results for the layer knudsen flow that arises when the nature of interface scattering differs at the two materials boundaries in a multilayer structure .",
    "these results also permit an efficient evaluation of the multilayer thermal transport .",
    "we find that the knudsen flow effect  @xcite is important in nanosized wires and multilayered structures formed from typical semiconductor materials due to the very large phonon mean - free paths .",
    "we test the accuracy of the approximations used to calculate the phonon knudsen flow by comparing our results to experimental measurements for a nanosized si wire.@xcite we further investigate the phonon knudsen flow in typical multilayer structures , including a simplified model of a nanosize transistor transport channel,@xcite and demonstrate a breakdown of the traditional fourier analysis@xcite for some semiconductor nanostructures at and below room temperature .",
    "finally we suggest an indirect but in - situ probe@xcite for the oxidation progress in sic ( and si ) materials .",
    "figure  [ conductivity ] summarizes the predicted suppression in the lattice thermal conductivity of general semiconductor wire and layer nanostructures .",
    "we stress that there is a difference in thermal - conductivity range used to present the results for sic , si , and gaas materials but that the overall physical behavior and consequences for semiconductor nanostructures remain unchanged in all materials .",
    "the _ left _ panels show @xmath5 ( dashed curves ) and @xmath6 ( solid curves ) for varying thickness @xmath7 for sic , si , and gaas at @xmath8 k. the dotted lines identify the experimentally observed value of the bulk - material thermal conductivities from which we also extract the listed values of the phonon mean - free paths @xmath1 .",

    "finally , the _ lower right _ panel shows the calculated temperature variation in the phonon mean - free path @xmath9 for sic , si , and gaas .",
    "the phonon knudsen - flow effect on the thermal transport arises because this @xmath9 approaches the microscale at lower temperatures and may even at room temperature exceed the typical separation between boundaries in modern and future semiconductor devices .",

    "the corresponding curve for ge coincides almost exactly with that for gaas because of the similarity in sound velocities and in measured values for the bulk thermal conductivities .",

    "the _ upper panel of fig .  1",
    "_ illustrates two possible realizations of wire systems  @xcite which could be embedded in an oxide or could exists as a free - standing object .",

    "the surrounding materials ( and/or vacuum ) suppress the average transport not only because they have inferior conductivities themselves but also because their material boundaries cause a knudsen - flow suppression even in the transport channel .",
    "again , two types of scattering events are possible and phonons are assumed to scatter specularly from the upper ( lower ) interface with probability @xmath47 and diffusively with probability @xmath48 , respectively",
    ". the value of @xmath49 will generally differ from @xmath50 as , for example , an oxide interface is rough ( @xmath51 ) whereas the interface to an underlying ( doped or undoped ) substrate may be very smooth ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "the phonon - boundary scattering off interface / surface defects becomes dominant when the phonon mean - free path exceeds the dimensions of the material.@xcite to analyze the general situation we introduce @xmath53 ( @xmath54 ) to denote the component of the phonon momentum @xmath4 that is perpendicular to the material boundary @xmath55 ( parallel to the thermal gradient , @xmath23 ) .",
    "specular phonon scattering has only indirect effects on the overall transport because the phonons will have the same momentum component @xmath54 in the direction of the thermal gradient @xmath23 as before the scattering event .",
    "for such specular scattering we have @xmath56 in contrast , diffusive interface scattering causes a significant transport suppression as the phonon emerges with a random direction given by the local thermal distribution .",
    "the implicit thermalization ensures @xmath57 and this boundary condition affects the distribution also away from the interface .    to calculate the resulting impact on the thermal transport for our low - dimensional structures we solve the l - bte @xmath58 subject to the boundary conditions eqs .",

    "furthermore , the form of the l - bte  ( [ eq : btegeneral ] ) permits us to express the relative suppression in terms of an amplitude @xmath61 and an exponential decay @xmath62 the amplitudes @xmath63 are fixed by analysis of the boundary conditions.@xcite    figure  [ deviation ] illustrates the general nature of the knudsen flow in the phonon distribution , @xmath64 , as functions of the momentum angle @xmath65 ( top panel ) and of the spatial coordinate @xmath66 across the diameter ( bottom panel ) .",

    "the calculated suppression applies for all phonon momenta ( and modes ) for wires when , as we typically do , we approximate the phonon mean - free path as constant . more generally , the figure illustrates the universal effect in the knudsen flow with a suppression of distribution changes extending far away from the boundaries ; similar momentum and spatial variation curves result both under more general assumptions for the mean - free path and in the case of multilayered semiconductor nanostructures .",
    "the resulting effect on the thermal conductivity @xmath72 can be summarized by averaging the relative suppression @xmath73 over the cross section ( perpendicular to @xmath23 ) . for every phonon @xmath4 and @xmath3",
