    "a _ knot _ is either an embedding of the @xmath0-dimensional sphere into the @xmath1-dimensional sphere or its image .",
    "two knots are _ equivalent _ if they are mutually transformed by an orientation - preserving self homeomorphism of the @xmath1-dimensional sphere .",
    "it is a fundamental problem on knot theory to determine whether given two knots are equivalent .",
    "since a knot itself is homeomorphic to the @xmath0-dimensional sphere , we can not distinguish them by itself .",
    "then we observe the exterior of the knot .",
    "if two knots are equivalent , then their exteriors are orientation - preserving homeomorphic .",
    "conversely , by the gordon ",
    "luecke s knot complement theorem ( @xcite ) , if the exteriors of two knots are orientation - preserving homeomorphic , then they are equivalent",
    ". therefore , the fundamental problem on knot theory arrives at the homeomorphism problem of knot exteriors .",
    "since the homeomorphism problem of knot exteriors is a intrinsic problem , it is an efficient decisive condition what can exist in the knot exterior .",
    "then we shall consider an embedding of a surface into the knot exterior as we consider a simple closed curve on a surface .",
    "if two knot exteriors are homeomorphic , then an embedding of a surface into one knot exterior which has some property moves to one of another knot exterior .",
    "therefore , we can consider the homeomorphism problem of knot exteriors by considering an embedding of a surface into the knot exterior .",
    "thus , it is an efficient means for the fundamental problem on knot theory to consider a problem of embeddings of surfaces into knot exteriors toward the embedding problem as knots .",
    "the transversality theorem is most fundamental and important for handling surfaces embedded in knot exteriors . by the transversality theorem",
    ", the intersection between two surfaces embedded in a knot exterior can be transverse , and it becomes a @xmath0-dimensional manifold .",
    "this is a point of departure for research in surfaces embedded in knot exteriors .",
    "if two surfaces are essential in the knot exterior , then the @xmath0-manifold obtained as the intersection of them can be essential in both surfaces ( the essential transversality theorem ) . in the case that two surfaces intersect essentially in this way , one can often reach an efficient conclusion since the @xmath0-manifold obtained as the intersection of them has a limitation on the surface .",
    "there is no intersection if only one essential surface is given in the knot exterior . in this case",
    ", we try to find some other convenient surface and consider the intersection with it . for any knot , by using a morse function on the @xmath1-sphere or the knot exterior",
    ", one can consider the intersection with the heegaard surface as a level surface or the bridge decomposing sphere . in this case , the intersection with the level surface can be essential and all saddle points can be essential ( essential morse position ) .",
    "also , for alternating knots , there is a standard position which is introduced by menasco ( @xcite ) . by inserting small @xmath1-dimensional balls ( bubbles ) in each crossing on a regular diagram of a knot",
    ", one can consider the intersection with the @xmath2-sphere on which the regular diagram lies and the boundary of bubbles .",
    "it is still efficient to consider two surfaces and their intersection even if no essential surface is given in the knot exterior .",
    "for example , the gordon  luecke s knot complement theorem was proved by using the level sphere obtained from some minimal one among morse positions ( thin position ) as the settlement of the property r conjecture by gabai ( @xcite ) . specifically , by supposing that the theorem did nt",
    "hold and suppose that there exist two knots which have the homeomorphic exteriors , we have level spheres which are obtained from each morse positions . by a deep consideration on the graph which is obtained from the intersection between two planar surfaces which are obtained by restricting them on the knot exteriors , a contradiction can be reached .",
    "also , the tait s flipping conjecture that any reduced alternating regular diagrams of a prime alternating knot are mutually transformed by flippings was proved by menasco ",
    "thistlethwaite by considering the intersection between two checkerboard surfaces which are obtained from two alternating regular diagrams ( @xcite ) .",
    "we stated as above the case that two essential surfaces or only one essential surface are given and the case that no essential surface is given .",
    "next , let s consider that case that many surfaces are contained without intersection",
    ". one can consider that the knot exterior is a large space and the knot itself is complicated as much as there exist mutually disjoint , mutually not parallel many essential surfaces in the knot exterior .",
    "can we take the number of such essential surfaces as infinitely large ?",
    "in fact , by the kneser ",
    "haken s finiteness theorem ( @xcite , @xcite ) , if the number of mutually disjoint essential surfaces in a @xmath1-manifold exceeds a constant number depending on the manifold , then they become to be mutually parallel .",
    "this constant is called a haken number , and it is a standard for measuring the range of manifolds . in general , there are infinitely many essential surfaces in a @xmath1-manifold .",
    "but floyd  oertel showed that there exists a set of finitely many branched surfaces such that any essential surface can be obtained from their branched surfaces ( @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , a study of essential surfaces in knot exteriors arrives at a study of branched surfaces which give them . by hatcher ",
    "thurston , for essential surfaces in the @xmath2-bridge knot exteriors , branched surfaces are given ( @xcite ) .",
    "the criterion of the fundamental classification on essential surfaces in knot exteriors is either the number of boundary components , the boundary slopes , and the genus etc .",
    "the surfaces mainly dealt on study of knots are classified into the following four types on the relation between a knot @xmath3 and a surface @xmath4 .",
    "they are a closed surface which is disjoint from the knot ( @xmath5 ) , a tangle decomposing sphere which intersects the knot transversely ( @xmath6 ) , a seifert surface whose boundary is the knot ( @xmath7 ) , and a closed surface which contains the knot , called a coiled surface ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "the above four types of surfaces are summarized in the below table . for each types",
