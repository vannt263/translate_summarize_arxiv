    "muon capture reactions on light nuclei have been studied intensively , both experimentally and theoretically , for many years .",
    "earlier achievements were summarized in refs .",
    "more recent theoretical work focused on the @xmath5 and @xmath6 reactions and was described in refs .",
    "the calculation of ref .",
    "@xcite was performed both in the phenomenological and the `` hybrid '' chiral effective field theory ( @xmath7eft ) approach , initiated in ref .",
    "it was based on hamiltonians comprising two - nucleon ( 2n ) as well as three - nucleon ( 3n ) potentials .",
    "the weak current operator included not only the single nucleon contribution but also meson - exchange currents ( mec ) as well as currents arising from the @xmath8-isobar excitation  @xcite .",
    "later these two reactions were studied in a `` non - hybrid '' @xmath7eft approach  @xcite , where both potentials and currents are derived consistently from @xmath7eft .",
    "the results obtained within different approaches agree with each other and described the available experimental data well .    in ref .",
    "@xcite we joined our expertise : from the momentum space treatment of electromagnetic processes @xcite and from the potential model approach developed in ref .",
    "we found that new results for the @xmath5 and @xmath6 reactions calculated in the momentum space were in good agreement with those of ref .",
    "@xcite , which had been obtained using the hyperspherical harmonics formalism .",
    "thus we could make the first step to establish a theoretical framework which can be extended to all the @xmath9 muon capture reactions , including three - body break - up of the @xmath10 systems . by using the faddeev equation approach",
    ", we provided , for the first time , predictions for the total and differential capture rates of the @xmath3 and @xmath4 break - up reactions , calculated with the full inclusion of final state 2n and 3n interactions .",
    "although we incorporated selected mec in the momentum space treatment of the @xmath5 and @xmath6 capture reactions , in the calculations of the break - up channels in muon capture on @xmath1he we restricted ourselves to the single nucleon current , with the weak nucleon form factors from ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "muon capture on @xmath1h has attracted less attention .",
    "this reaction , with all uncharged particles in the final state , would be very difficult to measure because of the radioactivity of the target and due to the meso - molecular complications  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath11 capture process presents , however , interesting features which make this process worth investigating : it allows one to study the neutron - neutron interaction and the three - neutron force acting exclusively in the total isospin @xmath12 state . besides , its study is the natural next step after the @xmath13 reaction has been considered .",
    "theoretical studies of muon capture on @xmath1h were started in the seventies of the 20th century  @xcite .",
    "those early calculations were performed predominantly in configuration space , using the 2n potential models available at that time . in ref .",
    "@xcite a separable potential of the yamaguchi type was employed in the calculations based on amado s method  @xcite and thus the final state interaction ( fsi ) was taken into account .",
    "actually that paper focused on the three different muon capture reactions in @xmath1he and the information about the capture rate on @xmath1h was extracted from the total isospin @xmath12 rate calculated for the three - body breakup of @xmath1he .",
    "the fsi effects and meson exchange currents were neglected in ref .",
    "@xcite but some observations about the reaction mechanism proved to be correct .",
    "in particular the authors predicted that inclusion of fsi would lead to an enhancement of the muon capture rate .",
    "a better calculation scheme was introduced in ref .",
    "the authors presented a general method to deal with transitions from a 3n bound state to scattering states caused by a weakly acting hamiltonian and applied it to muon capture on @xmath1h .",
    "they obtained results not only under plane wave ( pw ) approximation but also including 2n interactions ( in the form of the supersoft - core nucleon - nucleon potential  @xcite ) in the three - neutron continuum .",
    "more recent theoretical investigations were conducted in ref .",
    "the authors used the method of hyperspherical functions in coordinate space and employed four different central potentials in their calculations . as in ref .",
    "@xcite , they found fsi effects to be very important .",
    "their results were sensitive to the form of the 2n potential used in the calculations .",
    "table  i in ref .",
    "@xcite nicely summarized all the early theoretical predictions .    in this paper",
    "we extend our investigations of the @xmath3 and @xmath4 capture reactions presented in ref .",
    "@xcite to describe also the @xmath0 process .",
    "this reaction is studied under full inclusion of final state interactions , employing the av18 2n potential  @xcite alone or together with the urbana  ix 3n force @xcite .",
    "our results are based on the single nucleon weak current operator including relativistic corrections  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized in the following way : in sec .",
    "[ section2 ] we briefly introduce the elements of our formalism .",
    "our main results are shown in sec .",
    "[ section3 ] , where we discuss various predictions obtained with different dynamics for the @xmath0 reaction .",
    "we show our results for the differential and integrated rates and compare them with earlier theoretical predictions .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , we are for the first time able to include final state interactions based on modern 2n and 3n forces in a way consistent with the bound state calculations . in all cases",
    "we show separate results for the capture rates from the two hyperfine states , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , of the muon - tritium atom .",

    "we omit many - nucleon contributions to @xmath39 and restrict ourselves to two forms of the single nucleon current operator . the first one , @xmath40 , is strictly nonrelativistic , with the following momentum - space matrix elements of its time and space components  @xcite : @xmath41 and @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the mean value of the proton ( @xmath44 ) and neutron ( @xmath45 ) masses , @xmath46",

    "they are clearly visible in the peak areas , where the predictions including the 3n force drop by approximately 20  % .",
    "these peak reductions are quite similar to the two - body and three - body break - up cases studied in ref .",
    "@xcite for muon capture on @xmath1he . in these calculations",
    "the same single nucleon current operator including relativistic corrections is used . note that the pw results are obtained with the initial 3n bound state calculated solely with the 2n forces .",
    "it is interesting to trace back the origin of such large 3n force effects . to this end in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we display results of four different calculations with the same single nucleon current operator .",
    "we can neglect the 3n force both in the 3n bound and scattering states , include it only in the initial state , only in the final state and finally use it consistently in the 3n bound state and in the 3n continuum .",
    "for all the three differential rates 3n force contributions to the final three - neutron scattering state are very small and do not reach even 1  % . only the inclusion of the 3n force in the initial bound state is decisive for the calculations . therefore in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we see two groups of curves , each obtained with the same initial bound state .    it is clear that quantities like the differential capture rates @xmath149 would be extremely hard to measure .",
    "more realistic is to expect that the capture rates @xmath152 ( @xmath153 is the final neutron energy ) will be accessed experimentally .",
    "such measured rates will be in practice averaged over certain intervals of the neutron energies . in order to calculate the corresponding theoretical rates we do not introduce any dedicated kinematics but use the same steps as required to obtain the total rates according to eq .",
    "( [ gnnn ] ) .",
    "thus we are sure that the calculations of the ( averaged ) differential rates @xmath148 are consistent with the calculation of the total rate @xmath141 , where we obtain first the capture rates @xmath144 at 36 values of the final neutrino energy , solving for each of them the corresponding faddeev - like equation ( [ u ] ) .",
    "these neutrino energies are distributed with special emphasis on the region in the vicinity of the maximal neutrino energy .",
    "therefore we use the same formulas and codes as for the total @xmath154 capture rate , performing integrals over the whole phase space .",
    "however , the contribution to a given neutron energy interval comes only from the integrand with a proper kinematical `` signature '' @xcite .",
    "this kinematical `` signature '' is easy to obtain because the individual momenta of the three outgoing neutrons can be evaluated from eqs .",
    "( [ pq ] ) @xmath155 since the outgoing neutrons are identical , we have actually three possibilities to calculate the final neutron energy : @xmath156 , @xmath157 .",
    "this can be used as a nontrivial test of the final state antisymmetrization .    in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] the capture rates : @xmath146 , @xmath147 and @xmath148 , averaged over 5  mev neutron energy bins are shown both on a linear and a logarithmic scale .",
    "the reason for that is that the rates change by several orders of magnitude in the allowed interval of the neutron energy .",
    "these results are obtained with the full inclusion of the 3n force .",
    "the three curves denote the results , where the energy of nucleon  1 , nucleon  2 and nucleon  3 is taken as the neutron energy @xmath153 .",
    "the three lines completely overlap , which confirms the proper antisymmetrization of the final three - neutron states . in these calculations",
    "we use thus 36 @xmath125 points , 36 @xmath158 points , 36 @xmath159 points , 36 @xmath160 points and also 36 values of the magnitude of the relative @xmath105 momentum .",
    "note that due to the rotational invariance of the unpolarized rate , we may choose @xmath161 .",
    "these numbers of points are sufficient to get smooth curves for the 5  mev neutron energy bins . in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] we show the same capture rates as in fig .  [ fig4 ]",
    "but now they are averaged over smaller 2  mev neutron energy bins . from the wavy character of some lines ( visible on the logarithmic scale )",
    "one can infer that an average over smaller than 5  mev energy intervals requires a finer grid of @xmath125 points .",
    "we supplement the results presented in figs .",
    "[ fig1][fig5 ] by giving the corresponding values of integrated capture rates in table  [ tabbr ] , together with earlier theoretical predictions of refs .",
    "@xcite . from the first two rows of this table",
    "it is clear that final state interactions taken in the form of 2n forces enhance the plane wave results ( given in brackets ) by 3438  % .",
    "this effect is similar for the nonrelativistic single nucleon current operator and for the current operator containing relativistic corrections .",
    "the relativistic corrections reduce the @xmath14 rate by approximately 3.4  % and raise the @xmath79 by more than 6  % .",
    "the effect on the total rate is weaker : this rate is reduced by approximately 2.6  % .",
    "( all these changes are discussed for the `` full 2nf '' results . )",
    "note that this effect is slightly larger than for the @xmath162 process , for which the total capture rate , calculated with the av18 2n potential  @xcite augmented by the urbana  ix 3n force  @xcite , is reduced by 1.6  % , when the relativistic corrections are included in the single - nucleon current .",
    "this information was already obtained by one of the authors ( l.e.m . ) , when the calculations published in ref .",
    "@xcite were performed , but it was not included in the publication .",
    "the inclusion of the 3n force decreases all the three rates .",
    "this reduction is stronger for the @xmath14 and total rates ( approximately 12  % ) than for the @xmath79 one ( approximately 7.5  % ) .",
    "the reduction due to the 3n force is a common feature of the muon capture on the @xmath10 systems .",
    "already in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that there is a significant correlation between the total capure rate for the @xmath162 reaction and the @xmath10 binding energies .",
    "it is very interesting to notice that much earlier theoretical predictions agree quite well with our new results .",
    "this is true not only for the plane wave results but also for the calculations that consistently used 2n forces in the initial and final 3n states .",
    "results of our most advanced approach ( the av18 nucleon - nucleon potential augmented by the urbana  ix 3n force and the single nucleon current operator containing relativistic corrections ) are given in the third row of table  [ tabbr ] and read @xmath163 , @xmath164 and @xmath165 .",
    "this paper constitutes an important step towards a consistent framework for calculations of all muon capture processes on the deuteron and @xmath10 nuclei .",
    "this requires that the initial and final nuclear states are calculated with the same hamiltonian and that the weak current operator is fully consistent with the nuclear forces .",
    "results of such calculations can be then compared with precise experimental data to improve our understanding of muon capture and other weak reactions .    in the present paper",
    "we study the @xmath0 process in the framework close to the potential model approach of ref .  @xcite but with the single nucleon current operator .",
    "this is a continuation of our work from ref .",
    "@xcite , where other capture reactions : @xmath166 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 were described in the same momentum space framework .",
    "we use the results of ref .",
    "@xcite on the partial wave decomposition of the single nucleon current operator , the number of partial wave states necessary to reach convergence of the results and the simple method to obtain the averaged capture rates from the calculations of the total rate .",
    "it is quite understandable that also for this reaction the nonrelativistic kinematics can be safely used .",
    "using for the first time modern semi - phenomenological 2n and 3n forces , we give predictions for the differential @xmath167 capture rates as well as for the corresponding integrated capture rates @xmath141 and the averaged @xmath168 capture rates , taking additionally into account the @xmath14 and @xmath79 hyperfine states of the muon - tritium atom .",
    "our best numbers ( from the calculations employing the av18 2n potential and the urbana  ix 3n force and using the single nucleon current operator containing relativistic corrections ) are : @xmath163 , @xmath164 and @xmath165 .",
    "our predictions obtained with the 2n force alone are in a rather good agreement with much older theoretical predictions from refs .",
    "our results can not be confronted with experimental data at the moment .",
    "it is clear that a measurement of the reaction considered in this paper would be extremely difficult .",
    "however , due to the presence of three neutrons in the final state and their two- and three - body interactions , theoretical and experimental investigations of this reaction are very interesting and important .",
    "we are well aware that the full understanding of the muon capture processes requires the inclusion of at least 2n contributions to the nuclear current operators .",
    "first steps in this direction were made in ref .",
    "we do hope that , even in the present shape , our predictions will serve as an important benchmark . in the near future we plan to perform more complete calculations using the locally regularized chiral 2n potential  @xcite , supplemented by the consistently regularized chiral 3n forces  @xcite and electroweak current operators  @xcite .",
