    "crum s seminal paper of 1955 @xcite has played an essential role in elucidating the structure of one - dimensional quantum mechanical systems in general and exactly solvable ones , in particular . throughout this paper ,",
    "we mean ` exact solvability ' in the schrdinger picture , namely a quantum system is exactly solved when the complete set of eigenvalues and eigenfunctions are known .",
    "many exactly solvable quantum mechanical hamiltonians were constructed and investigated by combining shape invariance @xcite and crum s theorem @xcite , or the factorisation method @xcite or the method of the so - called supersymmetric quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that most of these shape invariant systems are also solvable in the heisenberg picture @xcite .",
    "exactly solvable quantum mechanical systems of one and many degrees of freedom are not only important in their own right but also have fundamental applications in various disciplines of physics / mathematics , _",
    "e.g. _ the fokker - planck equations @xcite and their discretised version , birth and death processes @xcite , to name a few .",
    "shape invariance is a sufficient condition for exactly solvable quantum mechanical systems .",
    "the number of shape invariant systems , however , was quite limited ; only about a dozen until the recent discovery @xcite of the several types of infinitely many shape invariant hamiltonians @xcite which led to the infinitely many exceptional laguerre , jacobi , wilson and askey - wilson polynomials .",
    "many methods were proposed to derive exactly solvable but non - shape invariant quantum mechanical systems from known shape invariant ones @xcite .",
    "( we apologise to those whose work we have missed . ) among them krein - adler s modification @xcite of crum s theorem is the most comprehensive way to generate infinitely many variants of exactly solvable hamiltonians and their eigenfunctions , starting from an exactly solvable one . the derived system is _ iso - spectral _ with the original one except that a finite number of energy levels are deleted",
    ". if the original system has polynomial eigenfunctions , as is usually the case , the derived systems have also polynomial eigenfunctions . by construction , these polynomials constitute a complete set of orthogonal functions .",
    "but they do not qualify to be called _ exceptional orthogonal polynomials _",

    "are retained in the discrete version .",
    "the eigenfunctions of the exactly solvable one - dimensional discrete quantum mechanics are the askey - scheme of hypergeometric orthogonal polynomials and their @xmath2-versions @xcite , _",

    "these examples are all shape invariant and they are also solvable in the heisenberg picture @xcite .",
    "the dynamical symmetry algebra of these algebras are the askey - wilson algebras @xcite and degenerations , which contain the @xmath2-oscillator algebra @xcite .",
    "the discrete version of crum s theorem was also established recently @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we present the discrete quantum mechanics version of adler s modification @xcite of crum s theorem .",
    "it allows to generate an infinite variety of exactly solvable discrete quantum hamiltonian systems . the insight obtained from crum s theorems and their modification , in",
    "the ordinary and the discrete quantum mechanics , is essential for the recent derivation of the infinite numbers of shape invariant systems and the new exceptional orthogonal polynomials @xcite",
    ". we will discuss the main results , the specialisation to the cases of polynomial eigenfunctions and simplest example for various exactly solvable cases ; first for the ordinary quantum mechanics and then for the discrete versions .",
    "the reason is two - fold ; firstly to introduce appropriate notion and notation in the familiar cases of the ordinary quantum mechanics . secondly we choose to reveal the underlying logical processes which are not easy to fathom in adler s paper @xcite or in crum s original article @xcite .",
    "as seen in the subsequent sections , the logical structures of the associated hamiltonian systems and their modification by _ deletion _ of energy levels are shared by the ordinary and the discrete quantum mechanics .",

    "appendix a provides three examples from the ordinary quantum mechanics , the harmonic oscillator , the radial oscillator , the darboux - pschl - teller potential .",
    "appendix b is for the four examples from the discrete quantum mechanics , the hamiltonians of the meixner - pollaczek , the continuous hahn , the wilson and the askey - wilson polynomials @xcite , which are known to reduce to the hermite , the laguerre and the jacobi polynomials in certain limits , respectively .",
    "let us start with a generic one - dimensional quantum mechanical ( qm ) system having discrete semi - infinite energy levels only : @xmath4 here we have chosen the constant part of the hamiltonian so that the groundstate energy is zero .",
    "then the hamiltonian is _ positive semi - definite _ and can be factorised , @xmath5 here a real and smooth function @xmath6 is called a _ prepotential _ and it parametrises the groundstate wavefunction @xmath7 , which has _ no node _ and can be chosen real and positive : @xmath8 it is trivial to verify @xmath9 in one dimension all the energy levels are non - degenerate . by construction",

    "a few exactly solvable examples are given in appendix .",
    "let us choose a set of @xmath3 distinct non - negative integers @xmath15 , satisfying the condition @xmath16 this condition means that the set @xmath17 consists of several clusters , each containing an _ even number _ of _ contiguous _ integers @xmath18 where @xmath19 .",

    "see adler s paper @xcite for a proof .",
    "the situation is essentially the same in the discrete qm .",
    "however , in the dqm to be discussed in the subsequent section , due to the lack of general theorem , the interlacing of the zeros of the two neighbouring eigenfunctions @xmath21 and @xmath22 must be verified for each specific hamiltonian . deleting an arbitrary number of contiguous energy levels starting from the groundstate ( @xmath20 )",
