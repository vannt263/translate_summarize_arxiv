    "in the very high energy ( vhe ) region above 100 gev , positive detections of radiation at a high confidence level have been reported from the direction of the crab , b1706 - 44 , and vela pulsars ( bowden et al .",
    "1993 ; nel et al . 1993 ; edwards et al . 1994 ; yoshikoshi et al . 1997",
    "; see also kifune 1996 for a review ) , by virtue of the technique of imaging cerenkov light from extensive air showers .",
    "however , as for _ pulsed _ tev radiation , only the upper limits have been obtained from these pulsars .",
    "if the vhe emission originates the pulsar magnetosphere , rather than the extended nebula , significant fractions of them are expected to show a pulsation . therefore , the lack of _ pulsed _ tev emissions provides a severe constraint on the modeling of particle acceleration zones in pulsar magnetospheres .    in the picture of cheng , ho , and ruderman ( 1986a ,",
    "b ) , who developed a version of an outer magnetosphere @xmath0-ray emission zone , the magnetosphere should be optically thick for pair production in order that the tev flux is absorbed to be unobservable .",
    "this , in turn , requires very high luminosities of infrared photons , which are generally orders of magnitude larger than the observed values ( usov 1994 ) .",
    "we are therefore motivated by the need to contrive an outer gap model which produces less tev emission with a moderate infrared luminosity .",
    "more recently , romani ( 1996 ) showed that the pulsed tev flux can be somewhat less than @xmath1 of the pulsed gev flux , assuming the functional form of the acceleration field as @xmath2 , where @xmath3 denotes the distance from the star .",
    "subsequently , hirotani ( 1999 , paper iv ) revealed semi - analytically that the tev fluxes from outer gaps are unobservable , by considering a gap closure condition so that a single pair produces copious @xmath0-rays one of which materialize as a pair on average ( see also zhang & cheng 1998 for another kind of closure condition ) . in this letter , instead of imposing the closure condition , we investigate the spatial distribution of @xmath4 , by solving the poisson equation and the boltzmann equations simultaneously .",
    "this method was first developed by beskin et al .",
    "( 1992 ) for black - hole magnetospheres and applied to pulsar magnetospheres by hirotani & shibata ( 1999a , b , c ; hereafter paper i , ii , iii ) .",
    "we formulate basic equations in   2 ,",
    "demonstrate the invisibility of pulsed tev fluxes in   3 , and discuss the validity of assumptions in   4 .",
    "to simplify the geometry , let us introduce a rectilinear coordinates for a region around the null surface .",
    "suppose that the magnetic field lines are straight lines parallel to the @xmath5 axis , where @xmath5 increases outwardly .",
    "we approximate that the null surface ( @xmath6 ) is perpendicular to the @xmath5 axis .",
    "it is convenient to non - dimensionalize the length scales by a typical debey scale length @xmath7 ( see the discussion in  3.1 in paper  i for details ) , where @xmath8 @xmath9 refers to the magnitude of the charge on the electron , @xmath10 the angular frequency ( @xmath11 ) of the neutron star in @xmath12 unit , @xmath13 the velocity of light , and @xmath14 the magnetic field strength ( @xmath15 ) at @xmath6 in @xmath16 g unit . then the dimensionless coordinate variable becomes @xmath17    assuming the trans - field thickness is comparable to or greater than the longitudinal width , we fourier - analyze the poisson equation in the trans - field directions to obtain ( paper i , ii , iii ) @xmath18 @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 ; @xmath22 is a typical gap thickness in the trans - field directions and @xmath23 the electrostatic potential .",
    "the particle densities are normalized in terms of a typical value of the goldreich ",
    "julian density as @xmath24 where @xmath25 are the spatial number density of @xmath26 s .",
    "we evaluate it with the newtonian value as @xmath27 } ,    \\label{eq : rhogj}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 refers to the inclination angle of the magnetic moment , @xmath29 the clatitude angle of the position at which @xmath30 is measured , @xmath31 the distance from the rotation axis , and @xmath32 the light - cylinder radius .",
    "let us first introduce the following dimensionless @xmath0-ray densities in the dimensionless energy interval between @xmath33 and @xmath34 : @xmath35 where @xmath36 are the distribution functions of @xmath0-ray photons having momentum @xmath37 in this letter , we set @xmath38 ; therefore , the lowest @xmath0-ray energy considered is @xmath39 . in this letter",
    ", we divide the @xmath0-ray spectra into @xmath40 energy bins as follows : @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 .",
    "assuming for simplicity that both electrostatic and curvature - radiation - reaction forces cancel out each other , we obtain the following continuity equations for particles ( eqs . [ 31 ] and [ 32 ] in paper iii ) : @xmath54 ,    \\label{eq : basic-3}\\ ] ] @xmath55 the factor @xmath56 denotes the projection effect due to the three - dimensional motion of the particles , which was not considered in papers i , ii , and iii .",
    "since the electric field is assumed to be positive in the gap , @xmath57 s ( or @xmath58 s ) migrate outwards ( or inwards ) .",
    "the x - ray field affects the gap structure through the pair - production rate @xmath59 .",
    "putting @xmath60 , we can evaluate @xmath59 as @xmath61 where @xmath62 denotes the number density of the x - rays between energies @xmath63 and @xmath64 ; @xmath65 is the pair production cross section when two photons collide with an angle @xmath66 ( berestetskii et al . 1989 ; eqs .",
    "[ 21]-[23 ] in paper ii ) . for surface blackbody x - rays ,",
    "we obtain @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the aberration angle . for power - law , magnetospheric x - rays , we assume @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is the full gap width , for both inwardly and outwardly propagating @xmath0-rays . as the lower bound of the integral , the threshold energy , @xmath71 , for pair production appears .",
    "a combination of the two continuity equations ( [ eq : basic-3 ] ) gives the current density @xmath72 , which is constant for @xmath73 .",
    "when @xmath74 , the current density equals the typical goldreich  julian value , @xmath75 .",
    "we next consider the boltzmann equations for @xmath0-rays .",
    "integrating the @xmath0-ray boltzmann equations between @xmath33 and @xmath34 , we obtain ( eq .  [ 39 ] in paper  iii ) @xmath76 where @xmath77 .",
    "the @xmath0-ray production rate via curvature radiation , @xmath78 , are defined by equation ( 40 ) in paper iii .",
    "the particle motion is assumed to be mono - energetic and the lorentz factor saturates in a balance between electrostatic acceleration and the curvature drag force ( see eq . [ 19 ] in paper iii ) .      in the same manner as in papers i , ii , and iii ,",
    "we impose the boundary conditions at the inner ( @xmath79 ) and outer ( @xmath80 ) boundaries as follows : @xmath81 @xmath82 @xmath83 where @xmath84 .",
    "we have totally @xmath85 boundary conditions ( [ eq : bd-1])([eq : bd-3 ] ) for @xmath86 unknown functions @xmath23 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 .",
    "thus two extra boundary conditions must be compensated by making the positions of the boundaries @xmath90 and @xmath91 be free .",
    "the two free boundaries appear because @xmath92 is imposed at the _ both _ boundaries and because @xmath93 is externally imposed .",
    "the pair production cascade is primarily described by the curvature - radiated , gev @xmath0-rays .",
    "therefore , the tev emission due to compton upscatterings is energetically negligible and can be computed passively from the electrodynamic structure of the gap .",
    "assuming that the azimuthal gap width is @xmath94 rad , we can evaluate the ratio between the tev flux and the infrared one as ( see  2.7 in paper v ) @xmath95 where @xmath96 refers to the solid angle in which photons with energy @xmath97 are emitted ; @xmath98 is assumed for simplicity . to estimate the upper bound , we take @xmath99 .",
    "the inequality comes from the fact that the scattered photon energy can not exceed the particle energy .",
    "it is noteworthy that it is the infrared photons with energy @xmath100 ev that contribute most effectively as the target photons of comptonization .",
    "neither the higher energy photons like surface blackbody x - rays nor the lower energy photons like polar - cap radio emission contribute as the target photons , because they have either too small cross sections or too small energy transfer when they are scattered .",
    "substituting the x - ray fields , @xmath11 and @xmath101 of individual pulsars into the differential equations , we can solve @xmath102 and hence @xmath103 ; equation ( [ eq : tev_flux_2 ] ) then gives @xmath104 as a function of @xmath105 and @xmath93 .",
    "in this section , we apply the theory to seven rotation - powered pulsars .",
    "we first present the observed x - ray properties of individual pulsars as input parameters in order of spin - down luminosity in table  1 .",
    "the x - ray spectrum of each pulsar is approximated by separating into a soft blackbody component with temperature @xmath106 and emitting area @xmath107 , a hard blackbody one with @xmath108 and @xmath109 , and a power - law one with @xmath110 ( @xmath111 ) , where @xmath112 and @xmath113 are assumed for homogeneous discussion .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ , < \" , ]     @xmath114 @xmath70 indicates the full gap width .",
    "+ @xmath115 @xmath116 .",
    "in summary , we have developed a one - dimensional model for an outer - gap accelerator .",
    "as the inclination angle ( @xmath105 ) increases , the gap center ( where @xmath117 vanishes ) shifts starwards to be illuminated by a strong x - ray field , which reduces the pair production mean free path and hence the gap longitudinal width , @xmath70 . at the same time , the starwardly shifted gap has a strong magnetic field , which increases the acceleration field ( see eq . [ [ eq : basic-2 ] ] ) . as a result",
    ", the tev flux increases with increasing @xmath105 , even though @xmath70 decreases .",
    "however , it is difficult to detect the tev flux , even when @xmath105 is as large as @xmath118 .",
    "we can therefore conclude that the difficulty of excessive tev emission , which appears in the picture of cheng , ho , and ruderman ( 1986a , b ) , does not arise in the present outer gap model .",
    "it is seemingly possible to obtain observable tev fluxes , if @xmath105 exceeds @xmath118 . in this case , the outer gap is located close to the polar cap ; the distance from the star is within @xmath119 of @xmath120 .",
    "the magnetic field there is so strong that the synchrotron ( or synchro - curvature ) process becomes important in general ; this could be verified by computing the pitch angle evolution of particles created in the gap ( see  5.3 in paper i ) .",
    "such a polar - gap - like outer gap will be discussed in a separate paper .    for middle - age pulsars",
    "b0656 + 14 and geminga , there is no stationary solution that satisfies the boundary conditions presented in  [ sec : bd ] .",
    "however , if we allow an external electric current flowing into the gap at the outer boundary , there exists a branch of solutions . in this case , the gap is no longer located around the null surface but shifts starwards .",
    "interestingly , when the external current density approaches the goldreich - julian value , the outer gap is found to shift to the polar cap and have a similar electrodynamic structure of scharlemann , arons , & fawley ( 1978 ) .",
    "such a unification of the outer gap and polar cap accelerators will be discussed in separate papers .",
