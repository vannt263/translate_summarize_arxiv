    "understanding brain function requires knowing connections between neurons . however , experimental studies of inter - neuronal connectivity are difficult and the connectivity data is scarce . at the same time",
    "neuroanatomists possess much data on cellular morphology and have powerful techniques to image neuronal shapes .",
    "this suggests using morphological data to infer inter - neuronal connections .",
    "such inference must rely on rules which relate shapes of neurons to their connectivity .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to derive such a rule for a frequently encountered feature in the brain organization : a topographic projection .",
    "two layers of neurons are said to form a topographic projection if adjacent neurons of the input layer connect to adjacent neurons of the output layer , figure  [ fig : cd ] . as a result ,",
    "output neurons form an orderly map of the input layer .",
    "i characterize inter - neuronal connectivity for a topographic projection by divergence and convergence factors defined as follows , fig .",
    "[ fig : cd ] . _ divergence _",
    ", @xmath0 , of the projection is the number of output neurons which receive connections from an input neuron . _ convergence _ , @xmath1 , of the projection is the number of input neurons which connect with an output neuron .",
    "i assume that these numbers are the same for each neuron in a given layer .",
    "furthermore , each neuron makes the required connections with the nearest neurons of the other layer . in most cases ,",
    "this completely specifies the wiring diagram .    a typical topographic wiring diagram shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cd ] misses an important biological detail . in real brains ,",
    "connections between cell bodies are implemented by neuronal processes : axons carrying nerve pulses away from the cell bodies and dendrites carrying signals towards cell bodies.@xcite therefore each connection is interrupted by a synapse which separates an axon of one neuron from a dendrite of another .",
    "both axons and dendrites branch away from cell bodies forming arbors .    in general , a topographic projection with given divergence and convergence",
    "may be implemented by axonal and dendritic arbors of different sizes , which depend on the locations of synapses .",
    "for example , consider a wiring diagram with @xmath2 and @xmath3 , figure  [ fig : menorah]a .",
    "narrow axonal arbors may synapse onto wide dendritic arbors , figure  [ fig : menorah]b or wide axonal arbors may synapse onto narrow dendritic arbors , figure  [ fig : menorah]c .",
    "i call these arrangements type i and type ii , correspondingly",
    ". the question is : which arbor sizes are preferred ?",
    "i propose a rule which specifies the sizes of axonal arbors of input neurons and dendritic arbors of output neurons in a topographic projection : _ high divergence / convergence ratio favors wide axonal and narrow dendritic arbors while low divergence / convergence ratio favors narrow axonal arbors and wide dendritic arbors .",
    "_ alternatively , this rule may be formulated in terms of neuronal densities in the two layers : _ sparser layer has wider arbors .",
    "_ in the above example , divergence / convergence ( and neuronal density ) ratio is 1/6 and , according to the rule , type i arrangement , figure  [ fig : menorah]b , is preferred .    in this paper",
    "i derive a quantitative version of this rule from the principle of wiring economy which can be summarized as follows .",
    "@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite space constraints require keeping the brain volume to a minimum .",
    "because wiring ( axons and dendrites ) takes up a significant fraction of the volume , evolution has probably designed axonal and dendritic arbors in a way that minimizes their total volume .",
    "therefore we may understand the existing arbor sizes as a result of wiring optimization .    to obtain the rule",
    "i formulate and solve a wiring optimization problem .",
    "the goal is to find the sizes of axons and dendrites which minimize the total volume of wiring in a topographic wiring diagram for fixed locations of neurons .",
    "i specify the wiring diagram with divergence and convergence factors . throughout most of the paper",
    "i assume that the cross - sectional area of dendrites and axons are constant and equal .",
    "therefore , the problem reduces to the wiring _ length _ minimization .",
    "my results are trivially extended to the case of unequal fiber diameters as shown below .",
    "purves and coworkers@xcite,@xcite,@xcite have previously reported empirical observations which may be relevant to the present theory .",
    "they found a correlation between convergence and complexity of dendritic arbors in sympathetic ganglia .",
    "conclusive comparison of this data with the theory requires establishing topographic ( or some other ) wiring diagram and measuring axonal arbor sizes in this system .    in the next section",
    "i consider a one - dimensional version of the problem . in this case , wirelength is minimized by wide dendritic and no axonal arbors ( type i ) for divergence less than convergence and by no dendritic and wide axonal arbors ( type ii ) in the opposite case . in section [ sec:2d",
    "] , i consider a two - dimensional version of the problem .",
    "if both convergence and divergence are much greater than one , the optimal ratio of dendritic and axonal arbors equals to the square root of convergence / divergence ratio .",
    "i test the rule on the available anatomical data in section [ sec : data ] . for several projections between retinal and cerebellar neurons ,",
    "arbor sizes agree with the rule . in section [ sec : other ] i consider other factors which may affect arbor sizes .",
    "consider two parallel rows of evenly - spaced neurons , figure  [ fig : cd ] , with a topographic wiring diagram characterized by divergence , @xmath0 , and convergence , @xmath1 .",
    "the goal is to find axonal and denritic arbor sizes which minimize the combined length of axons and dendrites .",
    "i compare different arbor arrangements by calculating wirelength per unit length of the rows , @xmath4 .",
    "i assume that input / output rows are close to each other and include in the calculation only those parts of the wiring which are parallel to the neuronal rows .",
    "i start by considering a special case where each input neuron connects with only one output neuron ( @xmath2 ) , figure  [ fig : menorah]a . there are two limiting arrangements satisfying the wiring diagram : type i has wide dendritic arbors and no axonal arbors , figure  [ fig : menorah]b ; type ii has wide axonal arbors and no dendritic arbors , figure  [ fig : menorah]c . intuitively , the former arrangement has smaller wirelength : short axons synapsing onto a common bus - like dendrite is better than long axons from each input neuron synapsing onto a short dendrite . to confirm this",
    "i calculate wirelength in the two extreme arrangements for @xmath2 , see methods .",
    "@xmath5 @xmath6    these results show that for @xmath2 and @xmath7 the two arrangements have the same wirelength . for @xmath2 and @xmath8 the arrangement with wide dendritic arbors and no axonal arbors ( type i ) has smaller wirelength than the arrangement with wide axonal arbors and no dendritic arbors ( type ii ) .",
    "i can readily apply this result to another special case , @xmath9 , by invoking the symmetry of the problem in respect to the direction of the signal propagation .",
    "i can interchange words `` axons '' and `` dendrites '' and variables @xmath0 and @xmath1 in the derivation and use the above argument . for @xmath9 and @xmath10 the two extreme arrangements have the same wirelength , while for @xmath11 the arrangement with wide axonal arbors ( type ii ) has shorter wiring than the arrangement with wide dendritic arbors ( type i ) .",
    "next , i consider the case when both convergence and divergence are greater than one ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "for the two extreme arrangements i get ( see methods ) : @xmath13 @xmath14 comparison of the two expressions reveals the following .",
    "if divergence is less than convergence then the optimal arrangement has wide dendritic and no axonal arbors ( type i ) .",
    "if divergence is greater than convergence then the optimal arrangement has wide axonal and no dendritic arbors ( type ii ) .",
    "if convergence and divergence are equal both arrangements have the same wirelength .",
    "i can restate this result by using the identity between the divergence / convergence ratio and the neuronal density ratio ( see methods ) : in the optimal arrangement the sparser layer has wide arbors , while the denser layer has none .",
    "so far i compared extreme arrangements with wide arbors in one row and none in the other .",
    "what about intermediate arrangements , with both axonal and dendritic arbors of non - zero width ? to address this question",
    "i consider the limit of large divergence and convergence factors ( @xmath15 .",
    "i find wirelength as a function of the axonal arbor size @xmath16 ( see methods ) : @xmath17 because @xmath18 i find the following .",
    "if @xmath19 then the minimal wirelength is achieved when @xmath20 , arrangement with wide dendritic and no axonal arbors ( type i ) .",
    "if @xmath21 then the minimal wirelength is achieved when @xmath22 , arrangement with wide axonal and no dendritic arbors ( type ii ) .",
    "if @xmath23 then all possible axonal arbor widths give the same wirelength .",
    "this proves that for @xmath24 extreme arrangements minimize wirelength . in cases of small @xmath1 and",
    "@xmath0 i checked intermediate solutions one by one . in many cases intermediate arrangements",
    "have the same wirelength as the extreme solution .",
    "however , only for a few `` degenerate '' @xmath25 pairs there are equally good intermediate arrangements with the reverse ratio of average axonal and dendritic arbor sizes relative to the extreme solution .",
    "my results are conveniently summarized on the phase diagram , figure  [ fig : phase ] , which shows optimal arrangements for various pairs of divergence and convergence factors .",
    "i mark the `` degenerate '' @xmath25 pairs by diamonds on the phase diagram , figure  [ fig : phase ] .",
    "what if axons and dendrites have different crossectional areas ?",
    "the principle of wiring economy requires that wire volume rather than wire length should be minimized .",
    "i can modify the arguments of this section by including the cross - sectional areas of the processes .",
    "i find for @xmath26 that if divergence / convergence ratio is less than the ratio of axonal and dendritic cross - sections then the optimal arrangement has wide dendritic and no axonal arbors ( type i ) . in the opposite case",
    "i find wide axonal and no dendritic arbors ( type ii ) .",
    "consider two parallel layers of neurons with densities @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "the topographic wiring diagram has divergence and convergence factors , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , requiring each input neuron to connect with @xmath0 nearest output neurons and each output neuron with @xmath1 nearest input neurons .",
    "again , the problem is to find the arrangement of arbors which minimizes the total length of axons and dendrites . for different arrangements i compare the wirelength per unit area , @xmath4 .",
    "i assume that the two layers are close to each other and include only those parts of the wiring which are parallel to the layers .",
    "i start with a special case where each input neuron connects with only one output neuron ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "consider an example with @xmath29 and neurons arranged on a square grid in each layer , figure  [ fig : por]a .",
    "two extreme arrangements satisfy the wiring diagram : type i has wide dendritic arbors and no axonal arbors , figure  [ fig : por]b ; type ii has wide axonal arbors and no dendritic arbors , figure  [ fig : por]c .",
    "i take the branching angles equal to @xmath30 , an optimal value for constant crossectional area.@xcite assuming `` point '' neurons the ratio of wirelength for type i and type ii arrangements : @xmath31    thus , the type i arrangement with wide dendritic arbors has shorter wire length .",
    "this conclusion holds for other convergence values much greater than one , provided @xmath2 . however , there are other arrangements with non - zero axonal arbors that give the same wire length",
    ". one of them is shown in figure  [ fig : por]d .",
    "degenerate arrangements have axonal arbor width @xmath32 where the upper bound is given by the approximate inter - neuronal distance .",
    "this means that the optimal arbor size ratio for @xmath2 @xmath33    by using the symmetry in respect to the direction of signal propagation i adapt this result for the @xmath9 case . for @xmath34 ,",
    "arrangements with wide axonal arbors and narrow dendritic arbors ( @xmath35 ) have minimal wirelength .",
    "these arrangements have arbor size ratio @xmath36    next , i consider the case when both divergence and convergence are greater than one . due to complexity of the problem",
    "i study the limit of large divergence and convergence ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "i find analytically the optimal layout which minimizes the total length of axons and dendrites .",
    "unlike the one - dimensional projection , optimal sizes of both axons and dendrites turn out to be non - zero .",
    "notice that two neurons may form a synapse only if the axonal arbor of the input neuron overlaps with the dendritic arbor of the output neuron in a two - dimensional projection , figure  [ fig : ar4 ] .",
    "thus the goal is to design optimal dendritic and axonal arbors so that each dendritic arbor intersects @xmath1 axonal arbors and each axonal arbor intersects @xmath0 dendritic arbors .    to be specific , i consider a wiring diagram with convergence exceeding divergence , @xmath37 ( the argument can be readily adapted for the opposite case ) .",
    "i make an assumption , to be verified later , that dendritic arbor diameter @xmath38 is greater than axonal one , @xmath16 . in this regime",
    "each output neuron s dendritic arbor forms a sparse mesh covering the area from which signals are collected , figure  [ fig : ar4 ] .",
    "each axonal arbor in that area must intersect the dendritic arbor mesh to satisfy the wiring diagram .",
    "this requires setting mesh size equal to the axonal arbor diameter .    by using this requirement",
    "i express the total length of axonal and dendritic arbors as a function of only the axonal arbor size , @xmath16 .",
    "then i find the axonal arbor size which minimizes the total wirelength .",
    "details of the calculation are given in methods .",
    "here , i give an intuitive argument for why in the optimal layout both axonal and dendritic size are non - zero .",
    "consider two extreme layouts . in the first one , dendritic arbors have zero width , type ii . in this arrangement axons",
    "have to reach out to every output neuron . for large convergence , @xmath39 , this is a redundant arrangement because of the many parallel axonal wires whose signals are eventually merged . in the second layout , axonal arbors are absent and dendrites have to reach out to every input neuron . again , because each input neuron connects to many output neurons ( large divergence , @xmath40 ) many dendrites run in parallel inefficiently carrying the same signal .",
    "a non - zero axonal arbor rectifies this inefficiency by carrying signals to several dendrites along one wire .",
    "i find that the optimal ratio of dendritic and axonal arbor diameters equals to the square root of the convergence / divergence ratio , or , alternatively , to the square root of the neuronal density ratio : @xmath41    since i considered the case with @xmath37 this result also justifies the assumption about axonal arbors being smaller than dendritic ones .    for arbitrary axonal and dendritic cross - sectional areas , @xmath42 and @xmath43",
    ", expressions of this section are modified .",
    "the wiring economy principle requires minimizing the total volume occupied by axons and dendrites resulting in the following relation for the optimal arrangement : @xmath44 notice that in the optimal arrangement the total axonal volume of input neurons is equal to the total dendritic volume of the output neurons .",
    "this theory predicts a relationship between the con-/divergence ratio and the sizes of axonal and dendritic arbors .",
    "i test these predictions on several cases of topographic projection in two dimensions .",
    "the predictions depend on whether divergence and convergence are both greater than one or not .",
    "therefore , i consider the two regimes separately .",
    "first , i focus on topographic projections of retinal neurons whose divergence factor is equal or close to one . because retinal neurons use mostly graded potentials the difference between axons and dendrites is small and i assume that their cross - sectional areas are equal .",
    "the theory predicts that the ratio of dendritic and axonal arbor sizes must be greater than the square root of the input / output neuronal density ratio , @xmath45 ( eq.[sql ] ) .",
    "i represent the data on the plot of the relative arbor diameter , @xmath46 , vs. the square root of the relative densities , @xmath47 , ( figure  [ fig : data ] ) . because neurons located in the same layer may belong to different classes , each having different arbor size and connectivity , i plot data from different classes separately .",
    "all the data points lie above the @xmath48 line in agreement with the prediction .",
    "second , i apply the theory to cerebellar neurons whose divergence and convergence are both greater than one .",
    "i consider a projection from granule cell axons ( parallel fibers ) onto purkinje cells .",
    "ratio of granule cells to purkinje cells is 3300,@xcite , indicating a high convergence / divergence ratio .",
    "this predicts a ratio of dendritic and axonal arbor sizes of 58 .",
    "this is qualitatively in agreement with wide dendritic arbors of purkinje cells and no axonal arbors on parallel fibers .",
    "quantitative comparison is complicated because the projection is not strictly two - dimensional : purkinje dendrites stacked next to each other add up to a significant third dimension .",
    "naively , given that the dendritic arbor size is about 400@xmath49 m eq.[res ] predicts axonal arbor of about 7@xmath49 m .",
    "this is close to the distance between two adjacent purkinje cell arbors of about 9@xmath49 m . because the length of parallel fibers is greater than 7@xmath49 m absence of axonal arbors comes as no surprise .    in general , application of the rule",
    "requires some care because it was derived for a simplified model .",
    "i considered a topographic projection only between a single pair of layers .",
    "however , neurons often make connections to different layers .",
    "in particular , dendritic arbors of the output layer may be determined by connections other than to the input layer .",
    "for example , consider the topographic projection from thalamus to the primary visual cortex .",
    "one may think that because the density of magnocellular thalamic afferents is smaller than neurons in layer 4c@xmath50 ( @xmath51 compared with @xmath52)@xcite then the axonal arbors should be wider than the dendritic ones .",
    "although this is true ( @xmath53@xcite compared with @xmath54@xcite ) the majority of inputs to layer 4c@xmath50 are intra - cortical.@xcite therefore , the dendritic arbor size may be determined by these other projections .",
    "one may argue that dendrites and axons have functions other than linking cell bodies to synapses and , therefore , the size of the arbors may be dictated by other considerations .",
    "although i can not rule out this possibility , the _ primary _ function of axons and dendrites is to connect cell bodies to synapses in order to conduct nerve pulses between them . indeed ,",
    "if neurons were not connected more sophisticated effects such as non - linear interactions between different dendritic inputs could not take place .",
    "hence the most basic parameters of axonal and dendritic arbors such as their size should follow from considerations of connectivity .",
    "another possibility is that the size of dendritic arbors is dictated by the surface area needed to arrange all the synapses .",
    "this argument does not specify the arbor size , however : a compact dendrite of elaborate shape can have the same surface area as a wide dendritic arbor .",
    "finally , agreement of the predictions with the existing anatomical data suggests that the rule is based on correct principles .",
    "further extensive testing of the rule is desirable .",
    "violation of the rule in some system would suggest the presence of other overriding considerations in the design of that system , which is also interesting .    in conclusion ,",
    "i propose a rule relating connectivity of neurons to their morphology based on the wiring economy principle .",
    "this rule may be used to infer connections between neurons from the sizes of their axonal and dendritic arbors .",
    "i frequently use the following identity@xcite relating convergence / divergence ratio and neuronal densities ratio : @xmath55 to prove it , i calculate the number of connections ( or synapses , if connections are monosynaptic ) per unit length in two ways .",
    "the number of connections ( or synapses ) is the number of input neurons , @xmath27 , times divergence , @xmath0 . at the same time , the number of connections ( or synapses ) is the number of output neurons , @xmath28 , times convergence , @xmath1 .",
    "since the answer should not depend on the argument , @xmath56 and eq.[cnd ] follows trivially .",
    "first , consider the case of @xmath2 .",
    "in type i arrangement ( figure [ fig : menorah]b ) , the size of a dendritic arbor , @xmath38 , is the inter - neuronal spacing @xmath57 times the number of inter - neuronal intervals covered by the arbor , @xmath58 : @xmath59 the number of dendritic arbors per unit length is equal to the density of output neurons @xmath28 . the combined dendritic arbor length per unit length is @xmath60 . since the axonal arbors do not contribute , the total wire length per unit length : @xmath61 by using eq.[cnd ] and recalling that @xmath2 i get eq.[li ] .    in type ii arrangement ( figure  [ fig : menorah]c ) ,",
    "the wire length is equal to the sum of the lengths of axons converging on each output neuron multiplied by the neuronal density in the output layer @xmath28 : @xmath62 using eq.[cnd ] i express the result in terms of convergence alone @xmath63 and get eq.[lii ] .    now consider the case of @xmath12 . by using eq.[cnd ]",
    "i find from eq.[lnn ] that @xmath64 this is eq.[dd ] of the main text . by using the symmetry in respect to the direction of signal propagation",
    "i find eq.[cc ] of the main text .",
    "next , i consider an arrangement with arbitrary sizes of axonal , @xmath16 , and dendritic , @xmath38 , arbors , figure  [ fig : ar1 ] , in the limit of @xmath26 . to satisfy the wiring diagram",
    "each input neuron must connect with @xmath0 output neurons and each output neuron must connect with @xmath1 input neurons .",
    "this places a constraint on the sum of axonal and dendritic arbor widths : @xmath65    therefore , axonal arbor width can take values @xmath18 .",
    "the total wirelength per unit length is : @xmath66 using eq.[cnd],[ss ] i get eq.[cll ] of the main text .",
    "i consider the case of @xmath67 , fig.[fig : ar4 ] .",
    "the following calculation is valid to the leading order in @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "i omit numerical factors of order one which depend on the precise geometry of axonal and dendritic arbors .",
    "the total length of a dendritic arbor , @xmath68 , is equal to the number of periods in the mesh @xmath69 times the mesh size , @xmath16 : @xmath70    the size of the dendritic arbor , @xmath38 follows from expressing convergence as the product of the area covered by the dendritic arbor times the density of input neurons @xmath71 : @xmath72 substituting this into eq.[sa ] i find : @xmath73 the length of an axonal arbor is approximately given by its size : @xmath74 then the total wirelength per unit area is : @xmath75    in order to find the optimal axonal arbor size @xmath16 , i differentiate wirelength in respect to @xmath16 and set the derivative to zero .",
    "@xmath76 solution of this equation gives the optimal size of an axonal arbor , @xmath16 : @xmath77 by using eq.[la ] i get the size of the dendritic arbor , @xmath78 the last two equations combined give eq.[res ] of the main text .",
