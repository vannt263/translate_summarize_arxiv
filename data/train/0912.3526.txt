    "in the past decade , high resolution x - ray observations have revealed an abundance of density and temperature discontinuities known as cold fronts ( cfs ) .",
    "they are broadly classified as merger cfs ( not discussed here ) and cool core cfs ; for review , see @xcite .",
    "core cfs are observed in more than half of the otherwise relaxed , cool core clusters ( ccs , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , in distances up to @xmath1 from the center .",
    "they are usually nearly concentric or spiral , and multiple cfs are often observed in the same cluster .",
    "the temperature contrast across such a cf is @xmath2 @xcite , where inside / outside subscripts @xmath3 refer to regions closer to / farther from the cluster center , or equivalently below / above the cf .",
    "the plasma beneath the cf is typically denser , colder , lower in entropy and higher in metallicity than the plasma above it .",
    "usually , little or no pressure discontinuity is identified across these cfs , suggesting negligible cf motion @xcite .",
    "such cfs were modeled as associated with large scale `` sloshing '' oscillations of the intracluster medium ( icm ) driven , for example , by mergers ( * ? ? ?",
    "* henceforth m01 ) , possibly involving only a dark matter subhalo @xcite , or by weak shocks / acoustic waves displacing cold central plasma @xcite .",
    "we argue that a tangential shear flow across and beneath cfs is ubiquitous in ccs .",
    "one line of argument relies on thermodynamic profiles across cfs found in the literature .",
    "we show that all these profiles reveal a distinct deviation from hydrostatic equilibrium , and argue that this can be naturally interpreted only as shear .",
    "an independent indication for the presence of shear across cc cfs is their remarkable sharpness and stability , which implies strong magnetic fields along the cf plane . in the absence of radial cf motion ,",
    "the most natural explanation for the persistence of such fields is shear across the cf .",
    "in  [ sec : deviations ] we show that deviations from hydrostatic equilibrium , previously reported in two cc cfs , are common among such cfs , and argue in  [ sec : differentialrotationacrosscf ] that this directly gauges bulk tangential flows and shear along and beneath these cfs . in  [ sec : magneticamplification ] we show that such shear can magnetize the core , and produce near - equipartition fields along cfs , thus stabilizing them .",
    "we summarize and discuss the implications of our model in  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "we assume a hubble constant @xmath4 .",
    "error bars are @xmath5 confidence levels .",
    "the mass density @xmath6 and pressure @xmath7 radial profiles near cfs in rx j1720 + 26 and a1795 were reported to be inconsistent with hydrostatic equilibrium ( m01 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . indeed , assuming such equilibrium , @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the radial acceleration and @xmath10 is newton s constant , would imply an unphysical gravitating mass profile @xmath11 that becomes abruptly larger just outside the cf . in rx j1720 , @xmath12 derived from the above assumption jumps by a factor of 5 ( at a @xmath13 confidence level ) at the cf , and there is marginal evidence for a pressure discontinuity which translates to radial cf motion with mach number @xmath14 @xcite . in a1795 ,",
    "@xmath12 jumps by a factor of 2 ( @xmath13 ) and the pressure appears continuous across the cf ( figure [ fig : cfjump ] , inset ; see m01 ) .    to investigate the prevalence of this phenomenon",
    ", we calculate the pressure acceleration discontinuity @xmath15 across various cfs for which deprojected thermodynamic profiles have appeared in the literature . here",
    "we defined @xmath16 ( for any quantity @xmath17 ) and @xmath18 ( typically @xmath19 ) , with @xmath20 being the boltzmann constant , @xmath21 being the average particle mass ( assumed constant ) , and @xmath22 being the proton mass .",
    "the gravitating mass @xmath11 is assumed to be continuous everywhere .",
    "we extract all the thermodynamic profiles across cfs in cool cluster cores from the literature .",
    "we select only profiles that have been deprojected along the line of sight , where at least two radial bins exist on each side of the cf such that @xmath23 can be estimated . when possible , we omit radial bins which are very far ( @xmath24 times in radius ) from the cf , to avoid excessive contamination .",
    "we end up with six cf profiles in which @xmath25 can be calculated based on 2 - 3 radial bins on each side of the front , supplemented by three cfs for which only the density has been deprojected .",
    "we present the ( dimensionless ) normalized acceleration discontinuity @xmath26 in figure [ fig : cfjump ] , along with the literature references . here , @xmath27 is the sound velocity , with @xmath28 being the adiabatic index .",
    "all the @xmath29 values we find are negative , and inconsistent with zero at confidence levels ranging between @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "the cf data points shown in figure 1 are consistent with a best fit @xmath32 , _ i.e. _ nonzero at @xmath33 ( the average is not necessarily physically meaningful ) . as a sanity check ,",
    "we apply the exact same procedure to parts of the same deprojected thermodynamic profiles where no cf is present .",
    "this is possible in a few cases , where the profiles extend sufficiently far from the cf , shown in figure  ( [ fig : cfjump ] ) as empty cyan symbols .",
    "these continuum @xmath34 values are consistent with zero or are slightly positive ( within @xmath13 from zero ; a resolution effect explained below ) .",
    "overall , they are best fit by @xmath35 .",
    "this indicates that the @xmath9 discontinuity at cfs is real .",
    "furthermore , the effect is qualitative and robust .",
    "as @xmath36 jumps by a factor of @xmath37 as one crosses outside the cf , hydrostatic equilibrium would require a slower radial decline of pressure outside the cf , @xmath38 .",
    "however , the pressure profile typically _ steepens _ outside the cf .",
    "hence , two phenomena contribute to the @xmath39 discontinuity : the density drop , and the pressure steepening .",
    "neither of these effects can be inverted by spherical deprojection .",
    "the differentiation procedure used to estimate @xmath40 removes long wavelength errors , so the significance of @xmath34 is probably better than that estimated above . finally , note that resolution effects introduce an opposite bias , toward positive @xmath29 , as @xmath41 typically declines with increasing @xmath42 .",
    "this accounts for the slight tendency of continuum regions toward @xmath43 .",
    "we conclude that deviations from hydrostatic equilibrium are common in cc cfs , with less pressure support below the cf , @xmath39 , such that if the plasma above the cf is in equilibrium , the plasma below should be falling .",
    "this phenomenon , previously reported in rx j1720 and in a1795 , has been interpreted as evidence that the core is sloshing , with plasma near the cf _ radially _ accelerating in some phase of the oscillation cycle .",
    "for the apparently stationary cf in a1795 , cool plasma would then be sloshing at its maximal radial displacement , where it has zero radial velocity but nonzero radial acceleration ( m01 ) .",
    "we note , however , that in this picture , without additional effects , the discontinuity in radial acceleration @xmath44 would cause an unphysical gap to open along the cf . a different interpretation of the observations is therefore required . below",
    "we argue that the most natural interpretation of the data involves a noncontinuous ( within the observational resolution ) centripetal acceleration of flow along the curved cf .",
    "consider an infinitesimal , two - dimensional piece @xmath45 of the cf plane , and an inertial `` cf frame '' @xmath46 instantaneously comoving with @xmath45 perpendicular to the cf plane , as illustrated in figure [ fig : cfillustration ] .",
    "let @xmath47 be an arc in @xmath45 parallel to the local flow beneath the cf .",
    "we may approximate @xmath47 as a segment of a large circle with radius @xmath48 .",
    "consider the spherical coordinate system @xmath49 with @xmath47 lying at radius @xmath50 and colatitude @xmath51 .",
    "its origin , the center of the circle , is typically close but not necessarily coincident with the cluster center .",
    "the @xmath52 component of the velocity @xmath53 measured in @xmath46 must vanish at @xmath45 , @xmath54 , as @xmath55 is perpendicular to the discontinuity .",
    "the @xmath52 component of the acceleration is continuous across @xmath45 , @xmath56 .",
    "hence , taking the difference in the @xmath52 component of the euler ( momentum ) equation between the two sides of @xmath45 yields @xmath57 where the pressure @xmath58 may include thermal and nonthermal components , @xmath59 , and we assumed slow changes in the cf pattern , @xmath60 .",
    "note that although @xmath53 is confined to the cf plane , it does not have to be parallel on the two sides of @xmath45 .",
    "equation ( [ eq : momentum_r_cf ] ) indicates that the observed discontinuity @xmath61 must be balanced by a discontinuously larger centripetal acceleration @xmath62 beneath the cf .",
    "the discontinuity can not be plausibly attributed to @xmath63 , because the continuous @xmath64 , noncontinuous @xmath65 combination observed would then require predominantly nonthermal pressure at large , sometimes @xmath66 radii , which is unlikely ( _ e.g. , _ * ? ? ?",
    "henceforth we neglect @xmath63 .",
    "we conclude that shear flow across cfs is the most natural interpretation of the observations .",
    "thus @xmath67 where @xmath68 .",
    "hence , cfs are tangential discontinuities , with shear and faster tangential flow beneath the cf , @xmath69 .",
    "in particular , @xmath70 , where @xmath71^{1/2}$ ] is measurable .    in terms of the local sound velocity , equation  ( [ eq : pressure_term_discontinuity ] ) becomes @xmath72 typically the @xmath73 slopes are @xmath74 , steepening to @xmath75 above the cf , so a subsonic flow in the cf frame ( @xmath76 ) requires @xmath77 .",
    "indeed , @xmath78 is observed in cc cfs @xcite . assuming the subsonic flow and continuous pressure , equation  ( [ eq : u2_jump ] )",
    "also imposes an upper limit on the velocity above the cf , @xmath79 .    as an example , consider the cf in a1795 .",
    "the @xmath12 discontinuity was previously interpreted as reflecting radial acceleration , @xmath80 . interpreted as tangential flow",
    ", this corresponds to @xmath81 , uncertain to within a factor of @xmath82 .",
    "this velocity difference constitutes a considerable fraction of the sound velocity , @xmath83 .",
    "it places a lower limit @xmath84 on the ( tangential ) mach number beneath the cf , and an upper limit @xmath85 on the ( nonzero ) shear across it . assuming @xmath86",
    ", it also imposes an upper limit @xmath87 on the flow above the cf .",
    "note that the tangential flow inferred from @xmath88 may coexist with perpendicular ( radial ) motion of the cf through the icm , inferred from an apparent pressure discontinuity , for example in rx j1720 + 26 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath11 profile near a cf can be compared to other , equidistant regions in the core , preferably on the opposite side of the cluster , that do not harbor discontinuities . in both cases",
    "examined , a1795 ( figure [ fig : cfjump ] , inset ) and rx j1720 + 26 , @xmath89 is similar on both sides of the cluster above the cf radius @xmath90 , but inertia appears to be missing ( @xmath12 is too small ) in most of the volume beneath the cf . in the tangential flow picture",
    ", the missing inertia region beneath the cf corresponds to an extended tangential bulk flow .",
    "consider again the cf lying @xmath91 south of the center of a1795 . here , inertia appears to be missing in a considerable , @xmath92 region , involving @xmath93 of the gas in that sector .",
    "there is no evidence for inertia discrepancy below @xmath94 .",
    "hence , plasma within the discrepant radii range can not be uniformly flowing ; shear must be present .",
    "the existence and extent of the shear flow region are also gauged by nearly radial optical ( and sometimes x - ray ) filaments that lie below some cfs . in a1795 ,",
    "a pair of filaments extend out to @xmath95 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , just beneath the shear region . in m87 ,",
    "the south - west filaments @xcite extend out to @xmath94 .",
    "they are nearly radial out to @xmath96 , but have some curvature at @xmath97 which may be driven by shear .",
    "the ( sometimes curved ) termination of filaments just below the shear region suggests that they may have been eroded by the shear .",
    "an independent argument implying shear across cfs stems from their remarkable sharpness and stability .",
    "stationary cfs are stable against rayleigh - taylor instabilities , as the inside plasma has lower entropy .",
    "however , particle diffusion , heat conduction , and instabilities such as kelvin - helmholtz ( khi ) and richtmyer - meshkov , could potentially broaden and deteriorate the cf on short , subdynamical time scales .",
    "in contrast , observations indicate that cfs are not only stable over cosmological time scales , but in fact the transition in thermodynamical properties subtends a small fraction of the coulomb mean free path of protons @xcite .",
    "this suggests that transport across cfs is magnetically suppressed .",
    "such suppression is expected in cfs that move through the icm , due to draping of magnetic fields and possibly the formation of a magnetic barrier ( plasma depletion layer ) , as found in observations of planetary magnetospheres and in simulations ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "however , the processes that suppress transport in the more common , stationary type of cfs , were thus far unknown .",
    "here we argue that shear magnetic amplification near cfs naturally sustains the strong magnetic fields parallel to the cf needed to suppress radial transport .",
    "consider first the limit where cfs are infinitely sharp tangential discontinuities .",
    "the magnetic field perpendicular to such a cf must vanish , and there is no shear magnetic amplification .",
    "however , in this limit the stability against khi inferred from observations requires a strong magnetic field @xmath98 , as shown by @xcite for the merger cf in a3667 .",
    "namely , the shear velocity difference must be smaller than an effective alfvn velocity @xcite , @xmath99 and in addition @xmath100 { \\mbox { , } } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath101 , @xmath102 , and @xmath103 , with @xmath104 being the particle number density .",
    "equation ( [ eq : khi1 ] ) imposes a lower limit on @xmath105 , @xmath106 the large shear velocities derived in  [ sec : differentialrotationacrosscf ] thus imply large @xmath105 , up to @xmath107 of its equipartition value @xmath108 for which @xmath109 .",
    "an asymmetry @xmath110 would require @xmath98 well aligned with @xmath111 . in the case",
    "@xmath112 , @xmath113 , @xmath114 with @xmath115 being the angle between @xmath98 and @xmath111 , so stronger fields are needed if misaligned with the shear .",
    "a magnetic , plasma depleted barrier may form . as long as its temperature",
    "does not greatly exceed @xmath116 , it remains strongly magnetized .",
    "note that the corresponding density drop could possibly be observed more easily here than in merger - type cfs , as there is no confusion with a stagnation region .",
    "as shown below , equipartition fields are expected only very close to the cf , so @xmath63 can still be neglected at @xmath117 distances , as assumed in ",
    "[ sec : differentialrotationacrosscf ] .",
    "how did strong magnetic fields form along stationary cfs , and how are they sustained over cosmological time scales ?",
    "perpendicular transport suppression could preserve such fields practically indefinitely in the absence of large perturbations ( _ e.g. , _ mergers ) and disruptive kinetic plasma effects .",
    "hence , they could be remnants of an early stage where the cf was formed .",
    "but if such initial fields are absent or decay , shear driven magnetic amplification can naturally generate or replenish @xmath118 , by stretching @xmath119 magnetic structures advected by the flow via line freezing , @xmath120{\\mathbf{u}}$ ] .",
    "consider a weakly magnetized , @xmath121 stage where the kinematic viscosity @xmath122 is a fraction @xmath123 of its spitzer value .",
    "the velocity discontinuity across such a cf is gradually smoothed out , forming a transition layer of thickness @xmath124 beneath the cf at time @xmath125 , where @xmath126 and @xmath127 .",
    "this enables rapid shear magnetic amplification , on an e - fold time scale @xmath128 . equating the viscous and amplification times",
    "suggests that a magnetization layer of thickness @xmath129 develops over a very short time scale @xmath130 with @xmath131 being the growth factor .",
    "typically @xmath132 ; @xmath133 may suffice in the case of a weakening magnetic barrier .    the high @xmath134 estimates above hold only in the vicinity of cfs , where fast shear is measured .",
    "as mentioned in ",
    "[ sec : differentialrotationacrosscf ] , evidence suggests that the associated shear involves a fair fraction of the plasma beneath the cf .",
    "shear amplification may thus effectively magnetize the entire core , at least beneath the outermost cf . for a simple model where the shear is constant in a layer of thickness @xmath135 beneath the cf",
    ", the energy of the magnetic field is amplified in proportion to @xmath136 , where @xmath137 saturation of this process depends on the flow details .",
    "for example , in a spiral flow there is a characteristic cutoff time when magnetic structures leave the shear region .",
    "we have seen that cfs are strongly magnetized , and that the associated shear flow can magnetize much of the plasma beneath them .",
    "magnetic processes should therefore be enhanced below , and in particular near cfs .",
    "this naturally explains the recently discovered coincidence between cfs and the edges of radio minihalos ( mh ) @xcite ; see @xcite .",
    "we interpret deviations from hydrostatic equilibrium previously observed near cfs as evidence for centripetal acceleration .",
    "this reveals a tangential shear flow , nearly sonic at the cfs and extending well beneath them .",
    "such behavior is shown to be common among cc cfs , as illustrated in figure [ fig : cfjump ] .",
    "the measured discontinuity @xmath138 , given by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : pressure_term_discontinuity]-[eq : u2_jump ] ) , constrains the shear and inside flow , @xmath139 , and imposes an upper limit on @xmath140 .",
    "the apparent cf stability against khi suggests near - equipartition magnetic fields along the cf ( eqs .",
    "[ eq : khi3]-[eq : khi4 ] ) ; this could manifest in a shear - amplified , @xmath0 magnetic layer .",
    "shear magnetic amplification could rapidly magnetize the entire core up to the cfs , and explain some of the observed properties of radio mhs .    in our model ,",
    "core cfs are part of extended tangential discontinuities seen in projection .",
    "they directly trace both the orientation and approximate magnitude of bulk flows in the icm .",
    "cfs are usually nearly concentric , so @xmath98 should be nearly tangential and the polarization radial .",
    "note that this magnetic configuration differs from the predictions of magnetic compression models , where @xmath98 is typically isotropic ( _ e.g. , _ * ? ? ? * ) or radial @xcite , but is similar to the saturation of heat flux driven buoyancy instabilities in the core @xcite . in mhs , we predict detailed morphological correlations with x - ray gradients , which trace projected cfs , and radio polarization parallel to these gradients .",
    "such fast , extended flows would modify the energy budget of the core and could alter its structure , for example by distributing heat and relaxing the cooling problem .",
    "@xcite pointed out that the absence of resonant features in the x - ray spectrum in perseus indicates motions with at least @xmath141 in the core .",
    "although initially interpreted as turbulent motion , this may reflect the bulk motions discussed here .",
    "the presence of such flows could be tested , for example using high resolution spectroscopy and future x - ray polarization measurements ( _ e.g. , _ * ? ? ?",
