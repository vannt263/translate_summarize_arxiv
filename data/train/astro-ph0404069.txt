    "finally primary results are summarized in @xmath12 6 .",
    "we obtained time series ccd images of ngc 5466 for 22 nights from february 8th , 1999 to march 23rd , 2002 .",
    "total observing time is 27.1 and 133.7 hours for @xmath13 and @xmath14 bands , respectively .",
    "a total of 48 and 944 frames were obtained for @xmath13 and @xmath14 bands , respectively . because the observations were performed under various seeing ( 0.9@xmath154.5 arcsec ) and weather conditions , we adjusted exposure times depending on the seeing and transmission of the night sky .",
    "the observation log is listed in table 1 .",
    "the ccd images were obtained with a thinned site 2k ccd camera attached to the 1.8 m telescope at the bohyunsan optical astronomy observatory ( boao ) in korea .",
    "the field of view of a ccd image is @xmath16@xmath17@xmath18 ( @xmath19 arcsec pixel@xmath20 ) at the f/8 cassegrain focus of the telescope .",

    "we selected nine and five frames for @xmath14 and @xmath13 bands , respectively , taken under good seeing conditions on march 12 , 2002 .",
    "the derived transformation equations are @xmath25 @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are instrumental magnitudes of @xmath14 and @xmath13 bands , respectively .",
    "the color coefficients are average values for nine frames for @xmath14 band and five farmes for @xmath13 band , respectively .",

    "are clearly seen on both panels .",
    "in addition , there are about 60 stars at the brighter and bluer region above the ms turnoff ( represented by boxes on both panels ) , which are blue stragglers .",
    "we applied the ensemble normalization technique @xcite to normalize instrumental magnitudes between time - series ccd frames .",
    "we used about a hundred normalizing stars ranging from 13.7 mag to 19.0 mag for the @xmath14 band and from 13.7 mag to 18.5 mag for the @xmath13 band .",
    "we exclude variable stars and stars located within r = 0.@xmath345 to avoid the crowding effects . for @xmath13 band data ,",
    "we use them only for obtaining mean magnitudes , because the data quality was not good enough to apply frequency analysis .",
    "the normalization equation we used is @xmath36 where @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath37 are the standard and instrumental magnitudes of the normalizing stars , respectively .",

    "after photometric reduction of the time - series frames , we inspected by eyes luminosity variations for about 10,600 stars in the entire field to search for variable stars . from this we have detected nine sx phoenicis stars .",
    "six of them are previously known , and three are newly discovered in this research .",
    "we also recovered previously known 19 rr lyrae stars , three eclipsing binaries and a cepheid .    among the nine sx phoenicis stars , the three newly discovered ones are designated by sxp1 , sxp2 and sxp3 .",
    "sxp1 is located near a bright star , and sxp2 and sxp3 are located very close to the center of the cluster and have very low amplitudes ( see figure 3 ) .",
    "although seven of the nine sx phoenicis stars are located in the central region at r@xmath48 , we could detect them easily due to the sparseness of the cluster .",
    "for the globular clusters m53 @xcite and m15 @xcite , we found sx phoenicis stars only in the outer region at r@xmath49 ; those clusters have very crowded central regions , so it is very difficult to detect sx phoenicis stars in their central regions .    the coordinates , mean magnitudes and color indices of the nine sx phoenicis stars are listed in table 2 .",
    "the right ascension and declination coordinates ( j2000.0 ) of the stars in table 2 were obtained from the astrometry using the guide star catalogue ( version 1.1 ) .",
    "figure 3 displays @xmath14 band light curves of the sx phoenicis stars . in each panel",
    "we show a mean photometric error of each observing night by an errorbar in the left - lower corner .",
    "although ngc 5466 has a well resolved structure , all the sx phoenicis stars except for nh39 suffer still from contamination effects due to neighbor stars .",
    "some photometric data for the four sx phoenicis stars located near the cluster center were lost by poor seeing and/or bad sky conditions caused by moon lights or thin clouds .",
    "the light curves in figure 3 show typical characteristics of sx phoenicis stars , i.e. , short periods and low amplitudes .",
    "we have performed multiple - frequency analysis to determine pulsating frequencies of the nine sx phoenicis stars , using the discrete fourier transform and linear least - square fitting methods @xcite .",
    "figure 4 displays the power spectra of the light curves for the nine sx phoenicis stars .",
    "each panel shows the prewhitening process to derive each peak in the power spectrum with window spectra represented in the inner panels .",
    "low frequencies detected in all the sx phoenicis stars in ngc 5466 except for nh49 and sxp2 have resulted from variable seeing condition and/or drift during long observing runs from 1999 to 2002 .",
    "synthetic light curves obtained from these analyses are superimposed on the data in figure 3 , and they fit the data well",
    ". some unrealistic light curves of nh38 around hjd 2452069.0 are resulted from high - order fitting to small number of data .",
    "the results of the multiple - frequency analysis for the nine sx phoenicis stars are summarized in table 3 .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratios are defined to be the square root of the ratio of the power for each frequency to the average power after prewhitening all frequencies .",
    "we assume a real frequency to have the amplitude signal - to - noise ratio larger than 4.0 as done by @xcite . during the analysis we detected many harmonic frequencies and probable nonradial frequencies in addition to the primary frequencies of each star .",
    "most of the frequencies have been affected by 1 cycle day@xmath20 alias effect .",
    "the primary period modes for these sx phoenicis stars range from 0.0386 days to 0.0552 days , and the semi - amplitudes of the variability range from 0.023 mag to 0.221 mag .",
    "we divide the sample of sx phoenicis stars into three groups : 1 ) double - radial mode sx phoenicis stars ( sxp2 , sxp3 , nh35 , nh38 and nh39 ) , 2 ) single - radial mode sx phoenicis stars with long - term variations ( sxp1 and nh29 ) , and 3 ) single - radial mode sx phoenicis stars without long - term variations ( nh27 and nh49 ) .",
    "individual sx phoenicis stars in each group are described in appendix .",
    "double - radial mode stars are very useful to identify the pulsating modes of sx phoenicis stars .",
    "sxp3 , nh35 and nh39 show the double - radial mode oscillations .",
    "their period ratios are @xmath50 = 0.7979 , 0.7825 and 0.7826 respectively .",
    "the first radial modes are @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath51 of sxp3 , nh35 and nh39 , respectively .",
    "the double - radial mode features of these three stars are considered to be intrinsic ones .",
    "interestingly , nh39 shows the combination frequencies of the two radial modes ; @xmath53 and @xmath54 corresponding to @xmath55 and @xmath56 , respectively . for nh35 @xmath53",
    "is a suspected harmonic frequency of @xmath57 affected by 1 cycle day@xmath20 aliases .",
    "the period ratios help us to identify their pulsation modes with confidence",
    ". the period ratios of sxp3 , nh35 and nh39 are close to the theoretical ratios of the fundamental and first overtone mode for sx phoenicis stars with extremely low metal abundance@xcite . in figure 5",
    "we compare the period ratios of sxp3 , nh35 and nh39 with the theoretical period ratios for various @xmath58 l / l@xmath59 with z=0.0001 and m / m@xmath59=1.0 by @xcite .",
    "figure 5 shows that the two double - radial mode sx phoenicis stars , nh35 and nh39 , are located on the @xmath58 l / l@xmath59=0.8 line , and that sxp3 is consistent with the @xmath58 l / l@xmath59=0.6 line .",
    "using table 2 of @xcite we estimate the temperatures of all these three stars to be about 7700k .",
    "sxp2 and nh38 in table 3 are also suspected double - radial mode pulsators .",
    "but we could not obtain precise frequencies for the secondary radial modes because of the poor data quality .",
    "their period ratios @xmath50 are 0.764 and 0.810 , respectively .",
    "these values depart from the theoretical ranges for the ratio of @xmath50 .",
    "the frequencies of the suspected to be secondary radial modes are probably real ones , according to the amplitude signal - to - noise ratios ( see table 3 ) and features of power spectra in figure 4 .",
    "if we assume that they are affected by the 1 cycle day@xmath20 aliases , the period ratios of sxp2 and nh38 can be 0.781 and 0.798 , respectively , which are well consistent to the theoretical @xmath50 .",
    "we consider sxp2 and nh38 to be candidates of double - radial mode sx phoenicis stars .",
    "sxp1 and nh29 show distinct low frequencies , 1.5616 and 0.4268 cycle day@xmath20 , and their @xmath14 amplitudes are 0.076 and 0.158 mag , respectively .",
    "the low frequencies are clearly identified in the power spectra of figure 4 and in light curves of figure 3 .",
    "their amplitude signal - to - noise ratios are 8.7 and 18.2 , respectively .",
    "we have checked an existence of bad pixels on the ccd images , finding no bad pixels near these stars .",
    "we propose cautiously that the low frequencies of sxp1 and nh29 are caused by a nonradial @xmath60-mode and a contact binary , respectively .",
    "sxp1 is a very interesting pulsator , if their nonradial mode is real .",
    "this is the first discovery in globular clusters for a pulsator which possesses @xmath61-mode ( characterized by an sx phoenicis star ) and @xmath60-mode ( characterized by a @xmath62 doradus star ) , simultaneously . as an example for this type of pulsators",
    ", @xcite found the characteristics of @xmath63 scuti and @xmath62 doradus type pulsations for a field binary hd 209295 . but @xcite found that a long - term period component of hd 207651 , 1.3598 cycle day@xmath20 = 0.73540 day , was not resulted from @xmath62 doradus type term but the ellipticity effect . from the spectoscopic observations",
    "an eclipsing period was twice the period of the long - term period seen in the photometry .",
    "figure 6 is a phase diagram of the long period of 2.3430 days for nh29 .",
    "it shows a distinct light variation .",
    "if this is a contact eclipsing binary star , the total period will be about two times of the long - term period .",
    "otherwise , it could be a g - mode frequency similar to the long - term variation of sxp1 .",
    "unfortunately the data are not good enough for accurate frequency analysis .",
    "in figure 7 , we show the position of the nine sx phoenicis stars in the color - magnitude diagram of ngc 5466 , listing their mean magnitudes and color indices in table 2 .",
    "figure 7 shows that all the sx phoenicis stars are located in the blue straggler region , brighter and bluer than the main sequence turnoff point .",
    "it is known that all the known sx phoenicis stars in globular clusters are bsss , but there are non - variable stars among the bsss . in figure 8",
    "we have compared the @xmath14 amplitudes and periods of the sx phoenicis stars in ngc 5466 ( filled circles ) with those of sx phoenicis stars in other globular clusters , field sx phoenicis stars and @xmath63 scuti stars .",
    "it includes the sx phoenicis stars in m53 ( star symbols ) and m15 ( a cross ) discovered by our previous searches for variable blue stragglers in globular clusters @xcite .",
    "the sources of the data in figure 8 are @xcite for field sx phoenicis stars and @xmath63 scuti stars , and @xcite for sx phoenicis stars in galactic globular clusters .",
    "figure 8 shows that the @xmath14 amplitudes and periods of the sx phoenicis stars in ngc 5466 are consistent with those for sx phoenicis stars in other globular clusters ; the @xmath14 amplitudes increases steeply with increasing period , and the @xmath14 amplitudes of sx phoenicis stars are larger than those of @xmath63 scuti stars with the same period .",
    "a method for mode identification is to use a pulsation constant , @xmath64 , denoted as @xmath65 where @xmath66 and @xmath67 are the period and mean density of variable stars , respectively .",
    "@xmath64 values of overtone mode are smaller than that of the fundamental mode @xcite .",
    "@xmath64 values can be derived using a photometric method such as strmgrem _",
    "uvby h@xmath68 _",
    "observation @xcite .",
    "another photometric method is to use sx phoenicis stars with double - radial mode , but the sx phoenicis stars with double - radial mode are rare .",
    "fortunately , five ( including two candidates ) of the sx phoenicis stars in ngc5466 are found to have double - radial modes , so their modes are identified clearly .",
    "all the double - radial mode stars ( sxp2 , sxp3 , nh35 , nh38 and nh39 ) show the fundamental and first overtone modes , as described in @xmath12 3.1 .",
    "the mode of the rest of the sx phoenicis stars can be identified using the amplitude , period and luminosity .",
    "nh27 is identified as the first overtone mode because of its @xmath14 amplitude , 0.246 mag , being slightly lower , and especially the position in the period - magnitude diagram as shown in figure 9 .",
    "sxp1 has a high amplitude , and is located in the fundamental region in the period - magnitude diagram .",
    "so it is a fundamental mode star . in table 3 , nh35 , nh38 , nh39 and nh49 show harmonic frequencies supporting asymmetric sinusoidal features .",
    "moreover their total light amplitudes have a range of 0.282 @xmath15 0.730 mag , which are characteristics of high amplitude @xmath63 scuti ( hads ) stars .",
    "so , their mode are clearly identified to be fundamental radial oscillations .",
    "their primary and secondary radial periods correspond to the fundamental and first overtone radial modes , respectively .",
    "nh29 is the first overtone mode star according to its low amplitude ( 0.142 mag ) , well defined sinusoidal feature in the light curve ( see figure 3 ) and the location in the period - magnitude diagram .",
    "seven of nine sx phoenicis stars in ngc 5466 show the fundamental mode or double - radial mode with the fundamental and first overtone modes .",
    "they are displayed by open and filled circles in the color - magnitude diagram in figure 7 , respectively .",
    "two filled triangles denote the first overtone mode stars .",
    "the identified radial modes are listed in the last column of table 3 .",
    "@xcite suggested that the light amplitude and the degree of asymmetry of the light curves are useful parameters for identifying the pulsating modes .",
    "generally this method is very useful for systems with a small number of pulsators and/or no double - radial mode stars therein .",
    "however , in many cases these criteria do not give a unique solution to identify pulsating modes , especially for sx phoenicis stars with very low amplitudes and short periods such as sxp2 and sxp3 in ngc5466 .",
    "the p - l relation of sx phoenicis stars in the globular clusters is very useful to obtain the distance moduli of the clusters and nearby galaxies @xcite .",
    "however , it is not easy to define well the p - l relation from the observations , because there are often a mixture of different pulsation modes @xcite .",
    "but we can easily identify the pulsating mode using the double - radial mode stars as described in the previous section .",
    "figure 9 presents the p - l relation for the sx phoenicis stars in ngc 5466 .",
    "it shows that the sample can be separated into two discrete groups ; one is identified as a fundamental mode group ( filled circles ) , and the other is a first overtone mode group ( filled triangles and open triangles ) .",
    "the solid line represents the fundamental p - l relation , and the line is shifted to the dashed line corresponding to the first overtone mode stars by the ratio @xmath69 .",
    "the p - l relation for fundamental mode in ngc 5466 is derived to be @xmath70 which corresponds to @xmath71 for an adopted distance modulus of @xmath72 and @xmath73 @xcite ,    the empirical p - l relations have been obtained using field hads stars and/or cluster sx phoenicis stars identified by their pulsating modes .",
    "the slopes derived by field hads stars and sx phoenicis stars in @xmath74 cen show on the whole steeper ones up to 4.66 @xcite , whereas @xmath63 scuti stars , sx phoenicis stars in other globular clusters and theoretical results show flatter slopes up to 2.88 @xcite .",
    "the slope of @xmath75 for ngc 5466 is in a good agreement with the results for m53 @xcite and m55 @xcite .",
    "@xcite obtained a slope of @xmath76 for the fundamental mode stars in m53 and @xcite derived a slope of @xmath77 for the fundamental mode and a slope of @xmath78 for the first overtone mode stars in m55 .",
    "the slope for ngc 5466 derived in this study agrees also well with the theoretical values of 3.04 by @xcite and 3.05 by @xcite .",
    "through time - series ccd photometry of the globular cluster ngc 5466 , we detect three newly discovered and six known sx phoenicis stars . owing to the extremely open , well - resolved structure of ngc 5466",
    ", we could detect easily many short period variable stars such as sx phoenicis stars and eclipsing binaries even in the central region .",
