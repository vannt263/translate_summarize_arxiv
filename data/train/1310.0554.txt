    "the determination of the mass of the pulsars psr j1614 - 2230 with @xmath6 @xcite and psr j0348 - 0432 with @xmath7 @xcite has brought the necessity to re - examine many aspects of the physics of neutron stars ( nss ) . in particular",
    ", these observations revived the discussions about whether compact stars are purely hadronic , may have quark - matter cores in their interior , or may be pure strange quark stars @xcite .",
    "in fact , several authors have looked along the years for features that may allow to distinguish unequivocally these stars through e.g. the analysis of the mass - radius relationship and the cooling behaviour since both aspects strongly depend on the microscopic composition . in the case of the mass - radius relationship",
    "a discrimination is not easy because the stellar radius is difficult to determine observationally .",
    "moreover , at present , most observed compact stars have masses in a range where many models for hadronic , hybrid and strange stars overlap in the @xmath8 diagram .",
    "cooling studies rely on the fact that the neutrino emission , the specific heat , the thermal conductivity , and other relevant quantities strongly depend on the microscopic composition",
    ". however , while different models lead to different thermal evolution , there are many degrees of freedom in the problem and a univocal interpretation of observed data is difficult .    on the other hand ,",
    "it is now clear that the increase in sensitivity of gravitational wave ( gw ) detectors such as advanced ligo and advanced virgo will bring within the next few years the science of gravitational radiation to a mode of regular astrophysical observation @xcite .",
    "since nss can be conspicuous emitters of gravitational radiation , gws of nss will provide in the near future an important piece of information about several aspects of ns physics .",
    "in particular , transient phenomena involving the excitation of oscillation modes have long been considered as an important tool for the exploration of ns s interiors because several oscillation modes may emit gravitational waves @xcite .",
    "a lot of work has been carried out in the last three decades in order to describe the non - radial oscillatory properties of nss ; however , these studies employed equations of state that in most cases render maximum stellar masses below @xmath9 .",
    "recent observations have shifted the maximum stellar mass above @xmath9 and therefore it is worth re - examining the oscillation spectra because the change in the allowed equations of state may bring new ways to distinguish hadronic , hybrid and strange stars .    in this work ,",
    "we study the @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath4 modes of hadronic , hybrid and pure self - bound strange quark stars with maximum masses above 2 @xmath12 within the relativistic cowling approximation .",

    "the equations of non - radial oscillations were integrated within the cowling approximation in order to determine the frequency of the @xmath10 , @xmath1 and @xmath4-modes .",
    "we find that the fundamental mode is sensitive to the internal composition , but due to the uncertainties in the equations of state , there is an overlapping of the curves corresponding to hadronic , hybrid and strange quark stars for stellar masses larger that @xmath20 . as a consequence",
    "it would be difficult to distinguish hybrid and hadronic stars through the @xmath10-mode frequency , even if the mass or the surface @xmath21 of the object is determined concomitantly with @xmath22 .",
    "however , there are features that in some cases may allow a differentiation between strange stars and hadronic / hybrid stars . for example",
    ", strange stars can not emit gravitational waves with frequency below @xmath23 khz for any value of the mass .",
    "also , sources with a mass in the range @xmath24 emitting a signal in the range @xmath25 khz would be strange stars .",
    "the frequency of the @xmath1 mode is much more affected by the internal composition of the star . for hadronic and hybrid stars , we find that @xmath26 is in the range @xmath27 khz for objects with masses in the range @xmath28 , but for strange quark stars it is always significantly larger than @xmath29 khz .",
    "thus , a compact object emitting a signal above @xmath29 khz could be identified as a strange star even if its mass or gravitational redshift are unknown .",
    "high frequency @xmath4-modes are only present in hybrid stars and fall in the range @xmath5 khz .",
    "thus , they are clearly distinguishable from the fundamental mode , and of low - frequency @xmath4-modes associated with chemical inhomogeneities in the outer layers or thermal profiles .",
    "our results are summarized in table [ table2 ] and show that based on the simultaneous analysis of the frequency of the @xmath10 , @xmath1 and @xmath4-modes it would be possible to discriminate between hadronic , hybrid and strange quark stars .",
    "the spectrum of a pulsating compact star is very rich and therefore the possibility of having other kind of modes in the same frequency range of the above studied fluid modes should be studied in more detail in the light of modern equations of state leading to stellar models compatible with the recent observations of psr j1614 - 2230 and psr j0348 - 0432 .",
    "if other modes are present in the same range , the criterion presented above may be less effective .",
    "additionally , rotation is known to change the frequency range of the modes , but these modifications are not expected to alter qualitatively the scenario presented in this paper .",
    "in particular , it looks quite robust the conclusion that compact objects emitting a signal above 6 khz should be interpreted as strange quark stars and those emitting a signal in the range @xmath30 khz should be interpreted as hybrid stars .",
