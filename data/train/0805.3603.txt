    "only a minority of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) harbour relativistic radio - jets .",
    "the mechanism that drives the jet production in these radio - loud objects is unknown and constitutes an important issue in the study of accreting black holes .",
    "as both jets and x - ray emission originate close to the central black hole , it is clear that insight into this problem can be gained by comparing the x - ray properties of radio - loud and radio - quiet objects ( see ballantyne 2007 for a recent review ) .",
    "such studies of radio - loud and radio - quiet agn , as well as galactic black holes in their different states , have shown that radio - loud objects generally have weaker reflection features ( as measured by the fe  k@xmath1 line and compton hump ) and narrower fe lines than their radio - quiet counterparts ( see e.g woniak et al .",
    "1998 ; eracleous , sambruna & mushotzky 2000 ; grandi , malaguti & fiocchi 2006 for agn and fender , belloni & gallo 2004 for galactic black holes ) .",
    "explanations for these findings include highly ionized accretion discs ( ballantyne , ross & fabian 2002 ) and dilution by jet emission ( e.g. page et al . 2005 ) , but the usually favoured interpretation is that the thin accretion disc in radio - loud objects is truncated at large radii and replaced by an advection - dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) .",
    "the latter explanation is especially appealing in terms of jet production , as adafs are thought to naturally lead to bipolar outflows ( narayan & yi 1994 , 1995 ) .",
    "while adafs are expected to exist within objects with very low accretion rates ( @xmath2 , rees et al .",
    "1982 ) , such as low - luminosity agn and galactic black holes in their low / hard states , they are unlikely to be present in radio - loud quasars , which generally have higher accretion rates .    over the past few years",
    "there have been several reports of radio - loud objects , most of them quasars , where the presence of very broad fe lines suggest that the accretion disc extends close or all the way in to the innermost stable orbit .",
    "examples include the radio - loud agn 4c  + 74.26 ( ballantyne & fabian 2005 ) , 3c  273 ( trler et al .",
    "2006 ) , pg  1425 + 267 ( miniutti & fabian 2006 ) , 3c  109 ( allen et al . 1997 ; miniutti et al . 2006 ) and 3c  120 ( kataoka et al .",
    "2007 ) , as well as the galactic black hole gx 339 - 4 in its low / hard state ( miller et al . 2006 ) .",
    "these findings strongly indicate that a truncated thin disc is not a necessary condition for jet formation , and in particular not appropriate for objects with relatively high accretion rates .",
    "in this paper we will present the analysis of a new _ suzaku  _ observation of one of these objects , 4c  + 74.26 .",
    "4c  + 74.26 is a broad line radio galaxy ( blrg ) located at @xmath3 ( riley et al .",
    "its radio luminosity is on the boarder of frii and fri but its morphology is clearly that of an frii object ( riley et al .",

    "based on the flux - limit for a counter jet , pearson et al .",
    "( 1992 ) find that the inclination of the source axis must be less than @xmath4 to the line of sight .",
    "the bolometric luminosity of the source is around @xmath5 , making it a low - luminosity quasar ( woo & urry 2002 ) .",
    "the same authors also estimate a black hole mass of @xmath6 , which means that the source is operating at an eddington ratio of @xmath7 .",
    "4c  + 74.26 was first detected in the x - rays in the rosat all - sky survey , but the first observation that allowed a detailed spectral analysis was carried out with _",

    "brinkmann et al .",
    "( 1998 ) detected an fe line with @xmath8  ev but could not determine if the line was broadened .",
    "the continuum could be well fitted with a model consisting of a power law and cold reflection ( with a large reflection fraction of @xmath9 6 ) , modified by absorption at low energies .",
    "the _ asca  _ data were later re - analysed by sambruna , eracleous & mushotzky ( 1999 ) , who favoured a double power - law model for the continuum , in which the hard power law was attributed to emission from a jet . for the double power - law model the fe line was found to be broad ( @xmath10  kev ) and the equivalent width higher ( @xmath11  ev ) .",
    "the spectrum of a subsequent _ _ b__eppossax observation could be described with a similar model as the one presented by brinkmann et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , but with a significantly smaller reflection fraction of around 1 ( hasenkopf , sambruna & eracleous 2002 ) .",

    "our main goal is to try and determine the inner radius of the accretion disc .",
    "this paper is organised as follows : section [ observations ] describes the observations and the data reduction , section [ variability ] describes the variability and section [ spectra ] describes the spectral analysis .",
    "we finally discuss our results in section [ discussion ] and present our conclusions in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "4c  + 74.26 was observed by _",
    "suzaku  _ between 2007 october 2830 for a total duration of 158 ks .",
    "event files from version 2.1.6.16 of the _ suzaku _ pipeline processing were used and spectra were extracted using xselect .    for each xis , source spectra were extracted from circular regions of 4.3 arcmin radius centred on the source ( which was observed off - axis in the hxd nominal position ) .",
    "background spectra were extracted from two circular regions with the same total area as the source region , avoiding the chip corners with the calibration sources .",
    "response matrices and ancillary response files were generated for each xis using xisrmfgen version 2007 - 05 - 14 and xissimarfgen version 2007 - 09 - 22 .",
    "the arf generator should account for the hydrocarbon contamination on the optical blocking filter ( ishisaki et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "the net exposure time of all three xis detectors is 92  ks and the 210  kev count rates are @xmath13(xis0 ) , @xmath14 ( xis1 ) and @xmath15 ( xis3 ) .",
    "because of the very similar spectra of the two front - illuminated ( fi ) detectors ( xis0 and xis3 ) , their spectra were co - added for the spectral analysis , and their response files were combined accordingly .",
    "for the hxd / pin detector , a model for the non - x - ray background ( nxb ) was provided by the hxd team .",
    "source and background spectra were constructed from identical good time intervals , and the exposure time of the background spectrum was increased by a factor of 10 ( to account for the fact that the background model was generated with 10 times the actual count rate in order to minimize the photon noise ) .",
    "the source spectrum was corrected for dead time , leaving a total net exposure time of 86  ks .",
    "the response file appropriate for the hxd aim point was used ( ae_hxd_pinhxnome4_20070914.rsp )    the total pin count rate over the 1430 kev energy range is @xmath16 , compared to @xmath17 for the background . since the background is so much brighter than the source , the accuracy of the background model is very important for our results . according to mizuno et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , the one - sigma uncertainly of version 2 background models is around 3 per cent .",
    "it is often possible to determine the accuracy of the background model in a given observation more precisely by comparing it with the night earth spectrum .",
    "however , in the case of 4c  + 74.26 the pin field of view was never completely obscured by the earth , and such a comparison is not possible .",
    "some information on the accuracy of the background can also be obtained by comparing the light curves of the source and the background .",
    "this will be carried out in section [ variability ] .",
    "the background model discussed above does not include the contribution from the cosmic x - ray background ( cxb ) . in order to account for this",
    "we simulate the spectrum of the cxb and add it to the spectrum of the non - x - ray background . for the simulation of the cxb spectrum we use a model of the form @xmath18 , which is based on the heao - a1 spectrum , renormalized to the hxd field of view .",
    "the cxb count rate in the 1430  kev band is about 6 per cent of the count rate of the total background ( nxb + cxb ) .",

    "fig . [ xislc ] shows the 0.510  kev xis light curve from the _ suzaku  _ observation of 4c  + 74.26 .",
    "the light curve was obtained by adding the light curves of all three xis detectors , using fully - exposed 1 ks bins .",
    "the source brightens by about 20 per cent during the observation .",
    "we also note that the 210  kev flux has gradually increased by about a factor of two since the source was observed by _",
    "asca  _ in 1996 , as summarized in table [ longterm ] . the flux in the soft band in the _ asca  _ observation was also found to be two times higher than in a rosat observation in 1993 ( when the source was in the field of view of an observation targeted at the cataclysmic variable vw cep , brinkmann et al . 1998 ) . the 210  kev flux in the _ suzaku  _ observation is @xmath19 , corresponding to a luminosity of @xmath20 .",

    "for all three xis we see that the spectrum tends to harden as the count rate increases , although within a fairly large spread . in agreement with this",
    ", we find that a positive correlation is a better fit than a constant for all three data sets .",
    "according to an f - test , the improvement in the fit for un - binned ( binned ) data is significant at 91 ( 93 ) per cent ( xis0 ) , 99 ( 99 ) per cent ( xis1 ) and 98 ( 87 ) per cent ( xis3 ) .",
    "the fact that the positive correlation is highly significant only in xis1 is presumably due to the higher effective area at low energies in this detector , which reduces the error on the count rate in the soft band .",
    "we next consider the root - mean - squared ( rms ) spectrum , which , for a given time - scale , shows the fractional variability as a function of energy .",

    "the rms variability clearly increases with energy up to about 4  kev , at which point it flattens out and shows some evidence of decreasing .",
    "in the spectral analysis of the _ suzaku  _ data we will concentrate on the 210  kev ( xis ) and 1430  kev ( pin ) energy ranges .",
    "we find that the agreement between the fi xis is very good in the 210  kev range , and we therefore add their spectra , as previously mentioned in section [ observations ] and recommended in the _ suzaku  _ data reduction guide .",
    "the spectrum of xis1 , on the other hand , differs significantly from the fi xis spectra in the fe  k@xmath1 region ( the line energy and width are inconsistent with the fi xis values ) , and we do not include it in our spectral analysis .",
    "because of inconsistencies between the xis detectors at low energies ( presumably due to the modelling of the contamination ) , we do not extend the spectral analysis below 2  kev at this time .",
    "we note , however , that the low - energy spectrum is characterized by absorption in excess of the galactic value ( see fig .",

    "all spectral fits were performed using xspec version 11.3.2aj .",
    "errors on model parameters are quoted at the 90 per cent confidence level and energies of spectral features are quoted for the rest frame of the source .",
    "all fits include galactic absorption fixed at @xmath23 ( dickey & lockman 1990 ) .      in order to look for the presence of a broad fe line we start by fitting the spectrum with a power law , excluding the 47  kev energy band , where the line emission should dominate .",
    "[ ratio ] shows the data as a ratio to the power - law fit ( which has @xmath24 ) , clearly revealing that a broadened line is present .",
    "the fact that the line is broadened is confirmed when we add a gaussian line to the power - law model .",
    "if we let the width of the line be a free parameter we find an excellent fit of @xmath25 for 1509 degrees of freedom ( d.o.f . ) , compared to @xmath26 if we force the line to be narrow ( @xmath27  ev ) .",
    "the broad line has @xmath28  kev and @xmath29  ev .",
    "the results of these fits as well as all other spectral fits discussed in this section are presented in table [ results1 ] .",
    "broad fe lines are often found to have a narrow component originating from distant matter .",
    "to check for such a component in 4c  + 74.26 we add a narrow line at 6.4  kev to the model with the broad gaussian .",
    "this improves the fit by only @xmath30 for 2 fewer degrees of freedom , and the narrow line is found to have a very low equivalent width of @xmath31  ev .",
    "we thus conclude that a narrow component to the fe line is not required .",
    "we next replace the broad gaussian with a laor line ( laor 1991 ) , which models the fe line emission from an accretion disc around a kerr black hole .",
    "we fix the energy of the line at 6.4  kev , the outer radius of the disc at @xmath32 ( where @xmath33 is the gravitational radius ) , and the emissivity index of the disc at @xmath34 ( the emissivity follows the form @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the radius of emission , and @xmath34 is expected from gravitational energy release ) .",

    "we find an excellent fit of @xmath39 with @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "the relatively low inclination obtained in this fit implies that the source is extremely large ( of the order of 3  mpc ) .",

    "we will discuss the possible origin of this feature in section [ strangeline ] below .",
    "in addition to the interpretation that the inner disc is missing , there are several possible scenarios that could explain the large values obtained for @xmath45 in our best - fitting models .",
    "for example , extreme ionization of the inner disc would lead to a nearly featureless reflection spectrum that would be hard to disentangle from the power law continuum .",
    "in fact , adding an inner reflector with @xmath84 fixed at @xmath92 ( the highest allowed value ) to our best - fitting reflection model results in an acceptable fit , although the quality of the data is not good enough to constrain the fit parameters .",
    "another possible reason for the large value of @xmath45 is that the illumination of the disc results in an emissivity index that deviates from our assumed value of @xmath34 . the quality of the data does not allow us to constrain this parameter if all other parameters are left free",
    "however , when fixing the other reflection parameters at their time - averaged values , we find that the model with @xmath93 improves significantly with a flatter emissivity of @xmath94 .",
    "such a flat emissivity would be expected ( at least in an average sense ) if the disc is illuminated from a great height ( @xmath95 ) in a lamp post geometry ( see also vaughan et al .",
    "2004 ) , or if the power - law emission originates in the base of a jet , which is beamed away from the inner disc .",
    "a contribution from a jet in 4c  + 74.26 has previously been suggested for the _ asca  _ observation of the source ( sambruna et al .",

    "[ refmodels ] reveal a narrow feature around 7.27.4  kev ( 6.56.7  kev in the observed frame ) . depending on the underlying model , this feature",
    "can be modelled either as a 7.40  kev emission line or as a 7.17  kev absorption line .    for the model consisting of a power law and a broad gaussian ,",
    "the best fit is obtained with a narrow emission line at @xmath96  kev ( the fit improves by @xmath97 for 2 fewer degrees of freedom when the line is added , and ew@xmath98  ev ) .",
    "the same is true for the laor and reflection models in table [ results1 ] that have @xmath37 as a free parameter .",
    "none of the best - fitting parameter values change significantly when the line is added to these models .",
    "an absorption line at @xmath99  kev results in a very small improvement of the fit for these models , and we especially note that the addition of the line does not significantly affect the inclination .",
    "this is also true if the absorption line is identified with fe xxvi at 6.97  kev and we add a fe xxv line ( rest energy 6.7  kev ) with the same blueshift .    for the models where @xmath100 and a narrow 6.4  kev line is included , we find that the narrow feature can be equally well fitted with a @xmath99  kev absorption line as with a @xmath96  kev emission line .",
    "specifically , in the case of the model which consists of a power law , a laor line and a 6.4  kev line , we find that the absorption line improves the fit by @xmath101 for 2 fewer degrees of freedom and has ew@xmath102  ev , while the emission line results in @xmath103 for 2 fewer degrees of freedom and has ew@xmath104  ev . no model that includes",

    "this is higher than the upper limit of @xmath4 placed by doppler boosting arguments ( pearson et al .",
    "1992 ) .    we have ruled out an instrumental origin for the lines , which suggests that they ( if real ) are due to highly blueshifted fe emission .",
    "for example , identification of the 7.17  kev absorption line with fe xxv at 6.70  kev would imply an outflow velocity of about @xmath106 .",
    "this extreme velocity together with the relatively low significance of the lines suggests that they are probably not real .",
    "however , it is interesting to note that robinson et al .",
    "( 1999 ) detected a redshifted h@xmath1 line in polarised light in this source , indicating that an outflow with a velocity greater than @xmath107 is present .",

    "we note that the study of the pin light curves in section [ lightcurves ] showed that the background has probably been underestimated , suggesting that the real value is closer to the lower ( red ) data points .",
    "this also agrees with the predictions of the reflection models that were found to fit the 210  kev data . for the model where @xmath45 is a free parameter",
    "we get a best 230  kev fit of @xmath108 if the background is increased by 2 per cent .",
    "similarly , for the model with @xmath100 , we get a best chi - squared of @xmath109 if the background is increased by 12 per cent .",
    "the relative contribution from the reflection component is usually measured by the reflection fraction , which is the ratio of the total reflected emission to the power - law emission . for an isotropic source illuminating an infinite plane of gas the reflection fraction",
    "we estimate the reflection fraction of our models by measuring the the unabsorbed fluxes in the two components within xspec .",
    "for the two models presented above the reflection fractions are 0.3 and 0.5 , respectively , assuming that the power law emission extends all the way up to the upper boundary for the reflion model . on the other hand , assuming an upper cutoff for the power law of 150  kev ( as previously found for _ beppossax _ data , grandi et al .",
    "2006 ) we find slightly higher reflection fractions of 0.4 and 0.7 . in either case",
    ", it is clear that the reflection fraction is less than 1 , implying e.g. that the illumination is anisotropic , that the disc is truncated or that an unreflected component ( such as a jet ) contributes to the spectrum .",
    "4c  + 74.26 is included in both the _ swift _ bat 9-month agn catalog ( tueller et al .",
    "2007 ) and the _ integral _ general reference catalog ( bodhagee et al . 2007 ) . in order to further investigate the high - energy properties of 4c  + 74.26 we briefly investigate the spectra from these catalogs in this section .",
    "the data from the bat catalog are publicly available and the _ integral _ spectrum was provided by the _ integral _",
    "agn team ( the _ integral _ data is also analysed in molina et al .",
    "2008 , in prep ) .    a simple power - law fit to the data yields @xmath110 for _ swift _ ( 14195  kev ) and @xmath111 for _ integral _ ( 20100  kev ) .",
    "this should be compared with @xmath112 in the 1430  kev range for the _ suzaku  _ pin detector .",
    "no clear evidence for a cutoff of the power law is seen in any of the spectra .",
    "based on the power - law fits the inferred 1430  kev fluxes are @xmath113 ( _ swift _ ) @xmath114 ( _ integral _ ) and @xmath115 ( _ suzaku  _ pin ) . as the observations are not simultaneous and the source appears to be getting brighter ( as shown in table [ longterm ] ) , it is not surprising that the photon indices and fluxes differ somewhat .",
    "in order to check if the _ swift _ and _ integral _ data are consistent with a reflection model , we fit them with our best - fitting 210  kev reflection model , leaving only the cross - normalizations between the detectors as free parameter . as shown in fig .

    "the spectra are shown as a ratio to a power - law fitted to the _ xmm - newton  _ data , excluding the 47  kev energy range .",
    "it is clear from the plot that the continuum is somewhat steeper in the _ suzaku  _ observation ( @xmath133 ) , while the fe line profiles are very similar in both spectra .    in order to to try and",
    "find a spectral model for both observations we performed simultaneous fits to the spectra , using the two different reflection fits obtained for the _ suzaku  _ data as a starting point .",
    "experimentation showed that very good joint fits could be obtained for both models if all parameters apart from the slope and the normalization of the power law were tied between the two spectra .",
    "the results of the fits are presented in table [ jointresults ] .",
    "we see that the model where @xmath134 is a free parameter is still a somewhat better fit than the model with @xmath135 ( @xmath136 compared to 2431/2537 ) . in both models",
    "the photon index of the power law is 0.1 steeper for _ suzaku  _ than for _ xmm - newton  _ .",
    "the only tied parameters that differ significantly from the values obtained when fitting only the _ suzaku  _ data are @xmath134 , @xmath38 and fe of the first model .",
    "the values of these parameters have all increased ( especially note that the inclination now has a more reasonable value of @xmath137 ) but they are all still consistent ( within the errors ) with the _ suzaku  _ fits . as in the case of",
    "the _ suzaku  _ fits , we also find that both models agree well with the high - energy pin data , and that the best agreement is found if we assume that the background model has been underestimated by 23 per cent .",
    "we stress that the reflection normalization is tied in these fits and that letting it vary independently for the two spectra does not improve the quality of the fits .",
    "the same is true for the normalization of the narrow 6.4  kev line .",
    "we thus conclude that the difference between the _ suzaku  _ and _ xmm - newton  _ observations can be well described in terms of a power law that has increased in normalization and also become slightly steeper .    as a final comment",
    "we note that there is evidence for a narrow 6.2  kev line in the _ xmm - newton  _ spectrum ( ew  @xmath920  ev , as previously noted by ballantyne & fabian 2005 ) but not in the _ suzaku  _ spectrum . the origin of this line is unclear but ballantyne & fabian ( 2005 ) suggested that it and the 6.4  kev line could form the red and blue horns of a diskline originating in the outer disc .",
    "due to the long duration of the _ suzaku  _ observation , we have for the first time detected variability in the light curve of 4c  + 74.26 .",
    "we find that the source brightens by about 20 per cent during the observation , implying a doubling time of @xmath138  ms .",
    "there is evidence for a positive correlation between the hardness ratio and the count rate , although this is only significant at the 99 per cent level in the case of xis1 .",
    "we also find that the rms variability increases with energy up to about 4  kev , at which point it flattens out and shows evidence of decreasing .",
    "this spectral variability is rather different from that observed in typical radio - quiet seyfert galaxies , which generally exhibit spectral softening with increasing count rate and rms variability decreasing with energy above @xmath138  kev ( e.g. papadakis et al . 2002 ; markowitz & edelson 2004 ) .",
    "one possible explanation for the spectral variability observed in 4c  + 74.26 is that a jet contributes to the spectrum .",
    "this is possible even if the inclination of the jet to the line of sight is fairly large , as the base of the jet may not be well collimated . in this picture , our measured photon index of @xmath139 would be due the combined contributions from a hard component associated with the jet , and a softer component associated with comptonized emission from the corona , as previously suggested for an _",
    "asca  _ observation of the source ( sambruna et al .",
    "the fact that the source is harder when it is brighter would then indicate that the relative contribution from the jet is higher when the flux increases , assuming that the intrinsic slopes of the two power laws do not vary significantly .",
    "such a model could in principle be tested by investigating the difference spectrum between high- and low - flux spectra . however , due to the limited amplitude of the variability in 4c  + 74.26 we find that the difference spectrum is not of sufficient quality to discriminate between models .      in our spectral analysis of the _ suzaku  _ data of 4c  + 74.26",
    "we clearly detect a broad fe line , as previously seen by _ xmm - newton  _ ( ballantyne & fabian 2005 ) .",
    "our best fits to the fe line profile suggest that the line originates outside about 50  @xmath0 and that the inclination to the line of sight is around @xmath140 .",
    "this inclination implies that the source is around 3  mpc across , which is extremely large even for a giant radio galaxy .",
    "although it is possible that the source actually is this large , we note that an almost equally good fit can be obtained if the inclination is fixed at a larger value . for this scenario",
    "the inner radius of emission is outside 100  @xmath0 .",
    "we also managed to find a good fit with a model in which @xmath134 was fixed at @xmath141 .",
    "this model has the advantage of a higher inclination of around @xmath142 , but is a worse fit in the fe line region and also relies on the presence of a narrow fe  k@xmath1 line , which is not required in any other model .",
    "overall it seems like the first model is a better approximation of the real conditions .",
    "the perhaps simplest explanation for these findings is that the inner accretion disc is missing , as suggested for many other radio - loud agn ( e.g. eracleous et al . 2000 ) .",
    "it is also possible , however , that the inner disc is highly ionized or not strongly illuminated .",
    "the latter explanation seems more likely , as the former model would require a very sharp transition from an extremely ionized to a nearly neutral disc .",
    "a plausible explanation for why the inner disc is not strongly illuminated is that the corona , where the power law originates , is located high above the disc .",
    "the coronae of agn are widely believed to be powered by magnetic fields in their accretion discs . as magnetic fields",
    "are thought to be important for jet formation ( e.g. blandford & payne 1982 ) , it is likely that the properties and structure of the magnetic fields in radio - quiet and radio - loud objects are different .",
    "the strong reflection features often seen in radio - quiet agn indicate that their inner discs are strongly illuminated , implying that the magnetic energy is dissipated close to the disc .",
    "it is conceivable that the magnetic field structure in radio - loud objects leads to the energy being dissipated at larger heights , possibly in a region moving away from the disc , thus resulting in less illumination of the inner disc and weaker reflection features .",
    "it is also possible that emission from the jet itself contributes to the spectrum , as tentatively suggested by the variability properties described above .",
    "we explicitly tested for the presence of a jet in the _ suzaku  _ spectrum by adding a second , hard power law to the power law + reflection model .",
    "the results were inconclusive , however , as we found that we could not constrain the properties of the second power law .",
    "a much longer observation would be needed to put constraints on the possible jet component in 4c  + 74.26 .",
    "the difference between the 2007 _ suzaku  _ and 2004 _ xmm - newton  _ spectra can be well modelled with a power law that has increased in normalization and become slightly steeper .",
    "the reflected emission is consistent with staying constant between the observations , and the best - fitting disc parameters in the joint fits are similar to those found when only fitting the _ suzaku  _ data .",
    "a possible explanation for this behaviour is that the increase in flux between the two observation is mainly due to the ( unreflected ) emission from the jet increasing , in combination with the slope of the coronal and/or jet power laws steepening somewhat .",
    "we have analysed a 92  ks exposure _ suzaku  _ observation of the radio quasar 4c  + 74.26 .",
    "our main results can be summarized as follows :    * the 210  kev flux measured by _",
    "suzaku  _ is @xmath143 , which is the highest flux observed to date .",
    "the source has gradually brightened by about a factor of two since it was first observed by _",
    "asca  _ in 1996 . + * due to the long observation , we have for the first time detected variability in the light curve of 4c  + 74.26 .",
    "we find that the count rate increases by about 20 per cent during the observation .",
    "+ * there is evidence for spectral hardening as the count rate of the source increases .",
    "we also find that rms variability increases with energy up to about 4  kev , where it flattens out and shows some evidence of decreasing .",
    "+ * we clearly detect a broadened fe  k@xmath1 line .",
    "when fitted with a simple gaussian , it has @xmath144  ev and @xmath145  kev . + * the entire 2 - 30  kev energy range can be well fitted with a power law ( @xmath146 ) and near - neutral reflection from an accretion disc .",
    "no reflected emission inside about 50  @xmath0 is required by the fe line profile , although a model with @xmath147 provides a good fit if a narrow fe  k@xmath1 line is included .",
    "the reflection fraction is found to be in the range @xmath1480.7 , depending on the model . +",
    "* the high - energy _",
    "swift _ bat and _ integral _ spectra show a somewhat steeper continuum slope ( @xmath149 ) but can nevertheless be well described with the power - law + reflection models described above . + * the difference between the _ suzaku  _ and _ xmm - newton  _",
    "210  kev spectra can be well explained with a power law that has increased in normalization and become slightly steeper .",
    "the spectral variability properties described above can be explained in a model where the relative contribution from a hard jet increases with increasing flux .",
    "however , because of the limited variability amplitude and spectral quality , we are not able to constrain the possible contribution from a jet in 4c  + 74.26 .",
    "the best - fitting reflection model implies that the inner disc is either truncated at large radii or not strongly illuminated .",
    "we suggest that the latter scenario may be due to the power - law source being located high above the disc , e.g. as a result of the magnetic field structure .",
