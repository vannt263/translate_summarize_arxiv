    "the new tetrads introduced in @xcite , yield maximum simplification in the expression of a non - null electromagnetic field in a curved spacetime , for instance .",
    "it is through this simplified expression of the electromagnetic field that we will get to the geometry associated with the lorentz equation and its solutions .",
    "it is the purpose of this manuscript two - fold .",
    "on one hand we will prove that the lorentz equation has its origin in the fermi - walker transport of the electromagnetic tetrads already mentioned .",
    "on the other hand we will study different kinds of solutions to the lorentz equation from a geometric point of view through the use of the electromagnetic tetrads previously introduced .",
    "if @xmath0 is the electromagnetic field and @xmath1 is the geometrized electromagnetic field , then the einstein - maxwell equations can be written ,    @xmath2    where @xmath3 is the dual tensor of @xmath4 .",
    "the symbol @xmath5 stands for covariant derivative with respect to the metric tensor @xmath6 . at every point in spacetime",
    "there is a duality rotation by an angle @xmath7 that transforms a non - null electromagnetic field into an extremal field ,    @xmath8    the local scalar @xmath9 is known as the complexion of the electromagnetic field .",
    "extremal fields are essentially electric fields and they satisfy ,    @xmath10    they also satisfy the identity given by equation ( 64 ) in @xcite ,    @xmath11    as antisymmetric fields the extremal fields also verify the identity ,    @xmath12    where @xmath13 according to equations ( 39 ) in @xcite .",
    "@xmath14 is assumed not to be zero , because we are dealing with non - null electromagnetic fields .",
    "@xmath15 is the electromagnetic stress - energy tensor @xcite . in geometrodynamics ,",
    "the maxwell equations ,    @xmath16    are telling us that two potential vector fields exist ,    @xmath17    we can define then , a tetrad ,    @xmath18    the four vectors ( [ uo]-[wo ] ) have the following algebraic properties ,    @xmath19    using the equations ( [ i1]-[i2 ] ) it is simple to prove that ( [ uo]-[wo ] ) are orthogonal . when we make the transformation ,    @xmath20    @xmath4 remains invariant , and the transformation ,    @xmath21    leaves @xmath22 invariant , as long as the functions @xmath23 and @xmath24 are scalars .",
    "schouten defined what he called , a two - bladed structure in a spacetime @xcite .",
    "these blades are the planes determined by the pairs ( @xmath25 ) and ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "it was proved in @xcite that the transformation ( [ g1 ] ) generates a `` rotation '' of the tetrad vectors ( @xmath25 ) into ( @xmath27 ) such that these `` rotated '' vectors ( @xmath27 ) remain in the plane or blade one generated by ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "it was also proved in @xcite that the transformation ( [ g2 ] ) generates a `` rotation '' of the tetrad vectors ( @xmath26 ) into ( @xmath28 ) such that these `` rotated '' vectors ( @xmath28 ) remain in the plane or blade two generated by ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "once we introduced all these elements found in @xcite , we state the purpose of this manuscript . a particle of charge @xmath29 and mass @xmath30 in the presence of the electromagnetic field @xmath4 is going to follow a timelike curve determined by the lorentz equation @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "it will be proved that the set of all curves that satisfy the lorentz equation can be generated through fermi - walker transport .",
    "the frenet - serret formulae for a tetrad associated for instance with a timelike curve @xmath31 in spacetime @xcite@xcite are ,    @xmath32    where @xmath33 is the unit timelike tangent vector to the curve .",
    "the triad @xmath34 is formed by unit spacelike vector fields .",

    "if @xmath38 , then we can define the fermi - walker transport of a vector @xmath39 as ,    @xmath40    where @xmath41 and @xmath35 are the first normal and first curvature to the timelike curve @xmath42 .",
    "the `` absolute derivative '' @xmath43 is defined in @xcite .",
    "analogously , fermi - walker transport of a vector @xmath39 can be defined along a spacelike curve as @xcite ,    @xmath44    fermi - walker transport given by ( [ fws ] ) is along the spacelike curve @xmath45 , whose unit spacelike tangent vector is @xmath46 . in @xcite",

    "the result follows the same lines @xcite .",
    "therefore we can write ,    @xmath71    the transformation of the two tetrad vectors @xmath72 on blade two , given in ( [ zo]-[wo ] ) by the `` angle '' @xmath55 , can be expressed as ,    @xmath73    we can define then , a `` rotated '' orthonormal tetrad with respect to the tetrad ( [ uo]-[wo ] ) , along the integral timelike curve as ,    @xmath74    where @xmath68 is the tangent along the timelike curve",

    "we solve this particular problem as an example in the next section . as a comment",
    "we can say that if we replace the two tetrad vectors ( [ uzo]-[uwo ] ) for the vectors ( [ zo]-[wo ] ) , we would have an orthonormal tetrad too .",

    ", we are going to study the frenet - serret formulae associated to the timelike curve on blade one , whose tangent at every point is given by the unit timelike vector @xmath97 .",

    ". then , there are no solutions to the `` pure '' blade one lorentz equation problem .",
    "it is our objective to find special congruences of solutions to the lorentz equation through fermi - walker transport , as a more general example .",
    "we are increasing the level of complexity following a pedagogical scheme .",

    "it can be supplemented by different additional equations , for instance , @xmath125 .",
    "each possible choice for an additional equation yields different solutions @xmath112 to the lorentz equation .",
    "the problem is posed as follows .",
    "first , we are supposed to know the tetrad vectors and their covariant derivatives from solutions to the einstein - maxwell equations ( [ em1]-[em3 ] ) .",
    "second , we solve equations ( [ scalar1],[scalar2 ] ) for the scalars @xmath124 .",

    "other future applications are possible .",

    "if there is a geometry such that the gradient of the complexion is a timelike vector field , then there would be the possibility of finding a slicing such that the leaves of constant complexion foliate spacetime , and potentially could be a simplification tool .",
