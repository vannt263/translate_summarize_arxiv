    "the collision of relativistic heavy ions remains the only practical way to study hot and dense strongly interacting matter in the laboratory , and a vigorous experimental program at the energy frontier is currently being pursued at rhic , and another will soon begin at the lhc .",
    "the study of in - medium properties of vector mesons is a topic of continuing interest , as their spectral properties can be linked directly to the electromagnetic emissivity of the strongly interacting medium @xcite .",
    "as real and virtual photons leave their production site essentially unscathed , they represent penetrating probes that can reveal what conditions existed when they were emitted .",
    "note however that electromagnetic signals are continuously being generated : a reliable interpretation of experimental measurements still hinges on our understanding of the space - time evolution of the source .",
    "many recent theoretical studies have concentrated on the lower mass vector mesons i.e. @xmath1 and @xmath2 ( see @xcite and references therein ) , owing partly to the availability of precise heavy ion data @xcite in this invariant mass range . in this work ,",
    "we calculate the in - medium modifications of the properties of the @xmath0 meson .",
    "this resonance offers the advantage of a well - defined and narrow distribution , making it a good candidate for precision measurements . on the theory front",
    ", some previous investigations have been pursued in various limits of temperature and density with different techniques .",
    "a non - exhaustive list of those tools includes : qcd sum rules @xcite , effective hadronic lagrangians @xcite , and the nambu - jona - lasinio lagrangian @xcite .",
    "estimates of the kinematical broadening of the @xmath0 have also been done @xcite .",
    "experimentally , rhic measurements have concentrated up to now on the bulk behavior of the @xmath0 @xcite , even though some spectral information is emerging @xcite . in this context",
    ", a tantalizing result is that of the kek - ps e325 collaboration @xcite which claims to have measured the first experimental evidence of in - medium modification of the @xmath0 meson in nuclear matter .",
    "the goal of this work is not yet to directly compare with experimental measurements of the properties of the @xmath0 in relativistic nuclear collisions . as a first step",
    ", the size of expected in - medium modifications should be investigated at finite temperatures and densities , in a simpler equilibrium setting : we report here on such an investigation .",
    "the paper is organized in the following way : in section ii we discuss the formalism used to calculate the self - energy , together with the connection to the forward scattering amplitude ( fsa ) . in section iii",
    ", the methodology to calculate the fsa is given , and the next section features results .",
    "we conclude in section v.",
    "for a @xmath0 meson interacting with hadron @xmath3 in the medium , the retarded self - energy can be expressed as @xcite @xmath4 f_{\\phi a}\\left(\\frac{m_\\phi}{m_a}\\omega\\right)\\ ] ] to leading order in the density of scatterers , in the rest frame of @xmath3 , and on the mass shell of the @xmath0 meson . in the above",
    ", @xmath5 is the momentum of the @xmath0 meson , @xmath6 , @xmath7 is the amplitude for the forward scattering of @xmath0 with the field of type @xmath3 , and @xmath8 is the temperature .",
    "also , @xmath9 , with @xmath3 a boson .",
    "if @xmath3 is a fermion with a chemical potential @xmath10 , the argument of the logarithm becomes @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "turning first to the zero temperature part of the self - energy , we identify two contributions .",
    "the first is calculated through the interaction of the @xmath0 meson with a @xmath1 and @xmath12 , and is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ pic : phi_self ] ( a ) .",
    "meson . ]    this interaction is well described by the wess - zumino lagrangian term , with @xmath2-@xmath0 mixing @xcite : @xmath13 where @xmath14 using the wess - zumino interaction , we calculate the vacuum self - energy of the @xmath0 meson : @xmath15 + c \\label{eq : self - rho - pi}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using the experimentally measured branching ratio , the coupling constant in a given isospin channel is determined to be @xmath16 mev , while the mixing angle is @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "note that @xmath18 , @xmath19 is the invariant mass of the @xmath0 meson , and @xmath20 is the euler - mascheroni constant .",

    "the second contribution to the vacuum self - energy is given in fig .",
    "[ pic : phi_self ] ( b ) .",
    "such an interaction is described by the lagrangian of the form @xcite : @xmath23 where @xmath24 in the complex charged kaon field , @xmath25 is the @xmath0 field strength and @xmath26 is the covariant derivative .",
    "the vacuum self - energy for the @xmath27 interaction is : @xmath28 + \\frac{8 m^2_k}{m^2 } + \\bar{c}\\right\\ } \\label{eq : self - kk}\\ ] ] where the kaon mass is either @xmath29 gev or @xmath30 gev for the charged and neutral kaons respectively .",
    "the values of the coupling are @xmath31 and 1.682 for the charged and neutral kaons @xcite .",
    "finally , @xmath32 is determined the same way as @xmath21 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : self - rho - pi ] ) .",
    "the net self - energy is given by summing over all target species and including the vacuum contributions : @xmath33 the individual contributions to the self - energy contain the appropriate spin / isospin symmetry factors .",
    "note that the functional dependence of the self - energy in the vacuum case is different than that at finite temperature : the vacuum part of @xmath34 can solely depend on the invariant mass , @xmath35 .",
    "the matter parts do not have such a restriction and in general depend on both @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "however , in this study , the scattering amplitudes are evaluated on the mass shell of the @xmath0 meson .",
    "therefore , the vacuum contribution is evaluated at @xmath38 and the matter self - energies are only @xmath37-dependent .",
    "we only consider interactions with pions ( @xmath12 ) and nucleons ( @xmath39 ) as scatterings of the @xmath0 meson contributing to its self - energy . to describe @xmath0 s self - energy , a two - component approach @xcite",
    "is used ( see also @xcite ) : while ordinary reggeons are dual to s - channel resonances , the pomeron is dual to the background under the resonances . the low energy fsa is therefore composed of two parts , namely a resonance contribution and a background pomeron term . in the center of mass ( cm ) frame",
    "the low energy fsa reads @xcite @xmath40 here the sum ranges over resonances that decay into the @xmath0 meson and the particle @xmath3 , which is either a nucleon or a pion .",
    "the mass of the resonance @xmath41 is @xmath42 and its total width is @xmath43 . as usual",
    ", @xmath44 is the mandelstam variable , and the magnitude of the center of mass momentum can be re - expressed in terms of masses and @xmath44 .",
    "spin / isospin statistics are taken care of by using the averaging factor @xmath45 , with @xmath46 being the spin of particle @xmath47 , and @xmath48 , the isospin .",
    "this averaging procedure will wash out the distinction between longitudinal and transverse spin directions , and also the difference between different charge states .    the partial width for a resonance to decay into the @xmath49 channel is denoted by @xmath50 in eq.([eq : f_low ] ) .",
    "in the case were @xmath3 is a nucleon , the effective width can not be obtained directly from experiment @xcite , as no resonances that decay directly into @xmath0 and @xmath39 have yet been observed @xcite . a scaling law first proposed by lipkin @xcite in order to infer the effective width of @xmath50 is used .",
    "lipkin found that the ratio @xmath51 is a constant that quantifies the experimental deviation from the ideal su(3 ) octet - singlet mixing .",
    "we will be using the average value of @xmath52 ( averaged over the range @xmath53 gev ) , henceforth denoted @xmath54 .",
    "_ @xcite have recently obtained @xmath55 via analysis of @xmath0 and @xmath2 production in @xmath56 and @xmath57 reactions .",
    "it is assumed that resonances that can connect to an @xmath58 state @xcite will also have a @xmath59 interaction , with the appropriate kinematic adjustments .",
    "however , those resonances will have a reduced branching ratio @xmath60 by @xmath54 , i.e. @xmath61 . similarly to what was previously done @xcite , @xmath62 is expressed as : @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the total width of the resonance @xmath41 , @xmath65 is the branching ratio of the decay @xmath66 , we take the average value @xmath67 , @xmath68 \\left [ m^{2}_{r } - \\left ( m_\\phi - m_a \\right)^2 \\right ] } } { m_{r } } $ ] , and @xmath69 is the smallest relative angular momentum between @xmath0 and @xmath39 .    reactions proceeding via the strong interaction",
    "conserve parity ; we use this fact to determine @xmath69 .",
    "the parity conservation can be stated as @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the parity of the resonance , @xmath72 is the parity of the @xmath0 meson , @xmath73 is the parity of the nucleon , and @xmath74 is the parity of the wavefunction describing the relative angular momentum of @xmath0 and @xmath39 .",
    "parity conservation determines only whether @xmath69 is even or odd . to determine minimum @xmath69",
    ", we need to use spin and angular momentum addition rule .",
    "this rule looks as follows : @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the total spin operator of the resonance @xmath41 , @xmath77 is the angular momentum operator , @xmath78 is the spin operator of the @xmath0 meson , and @xmath79 is the spin of the nucleon .",
    "the non - vanishing clebsch - gordan coefficients will determine the possible values @xmath69 can take in the even / odd number region delimited by parity conservation equation .",
    "we keep only the smallest @xmath69 that satisfies both spin and parity conditions .",
    "the above approach to determine spin and parity is general and also applicable for interactions with pions ( instead of nucleons ) .    besides the above - threshold resonances , it is also necessary to include subthreshold resonances for they also make a contribution to the fsa .",
    "their contribution however is relatively small . indeed , including subthreshold resonances changes the imaginary part of the fsa by at most 2% in the @xmath80 gev energy range .",
    "the change to the real part of the fsa due to subthreshold effects is significantly larger reaching 50% in the same energy range .",
    "hence it is important to include the subthreshold resonances in the fsa .",
    "note that the overall magnitude of the real part of the fsa in that region is quite small ( see fig .",
    "[ pic : re_im_f ] ) , so the aforementioned 50% change is not as dramatic as might first appear . to estimate their widths we assume that the vector meson dominance model ( vmd ) is valid . as in @xcite , we write the partial width of the subthreshold resonances as @xmath81 and @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is the @xmath84 center of mass momentum .",
    "vmd allows us to relate @xmath85 ( with @xmath86 ) to @xmath87 as follows @xcite : @xmath88 one may evaluate the value of the couplings @xmath89 by first writing down the vmd lagrangian @xcite which governs the electromagnetic decay of vector mesons : @xmath90 where @xmath91 .",
    "the fermionic field for lepton @xmath69 is @xmath92 , @xmath93 is the photon field with the corresponding field strength tensor @xmath94 , @xmath95 are the different vector meson fields , namely @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath0 fields , with the field strength tensor written in an analogous fashion to the photon case and @xmath96 is the electromagnetic fine - structure constant . finally , the different @xmath97 ( with @xmath47 generic ) are the masses of the different particles involved .",
    "the coupling constants are then easily determined by evaluating the decay width into a lepton pair @xmath98 which stems from the feynman amplitude of fig .",
    "[ pic : em_decay ] .",
    "the values obtained are @xmath99 , @xmath100 , and @xmath101 @xcite .",
    "inspired by the quark model it is estimated that @xmath102 @xcite .",
    "further , using the scaling law proposed by lipkin , the relation @xmath103 is invoked .",
    "these statements allow to simplify eq .",
    "( [ subth_gamma ] ) : @xmath104 where @xmath105 , with @xmath106 being the experimental values quoted in ref .",
    "a summary of all the resonances that decay into @xmath59 is presented in table [ table : phi_n ] .",
    ".baryon resonances , both above and below threshold , included in the calculation of the @xmath59 fsa . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ table : width_phi_t ]",
    "we have calculated the mass shift and width broadening as a function of momentum for the @xmath0 meson using the scheme developed in @xcite .",
    "this approach has the great advantage to be model - independent since experimental data are taken as input to calculate the fsa .",
    "our results show that pion interactions contribute to reduce the pole mass of the @xmath0 whereas nucleons act in the opposite way hence increasing the pole mass .",
    "the mass shift overall is small and about a few tens of mev at most .",
    "also , we have found a significant increase of the width of the @xmath0 meson from its vacuum value of 4.26 mev . hence the spectral density , which is related to the dilepton production ,",
    "was considerably broadened .",
    "these results will be important for understanding possible in - medium modifications of the @xmath0 meson in strongly interacting environments .",
