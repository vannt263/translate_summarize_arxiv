    "neutron stars ( nss ) , with typical masses @xmath2 and radii @xmath3 km , are natural laboratories for investigating exotic phenomena that lie outside the realm of terrestrial laboratories .",
    "they have been arousing tremendous interest since they are related to many branches of contemporary physics as well as astronomy ( haensel et al .",
    "in particular , nss play the role of connecting nuclear physics with astrophysics , since they realize one of the densest forms of nuclear matter in the observable universe .",
    "concerning nss , important astrophysical quantities can be measured with increasing accuracy , such as mass , radius , surface temperature , spin period and spin - down , which provide valuable information and knowledge about these objects . on the theoretical side ,",
    "much attention has been paid to the equation of state ( eos ) of dense matter , including superfluid states , and cooling mechanisms via neutrino emission to understand the ns thermal evolution ( haensel et al .",
    "2006 ) .    nowadays",
    ", the measurements on the ns surface temperature such as cas a ( heinke & ho 2010 , posselt et al . 2013 ) , allow us to investigate the thermal evolution of nss more deeply ( page et al .",
    "2011 ; shternin et al .",
    "2011 ; blaschke et al .",
    "2012 , 2013 ; sedrakian 2013 ; newton et al . 2013 ; bonanno et al . 2014 ) .",
    "since the thermal evolution is quite sensitive to the equation of state ( eos ) of ns matter , in particular to its composition and superfluidy states , one may grasp the crucial information and knowledge on the ns interior from this study .",
    "thus , the exploration of the ns cooling might solve some difficult issues in nuclear physics , for instance , the density dependence of symmetry energy at supranuclear densities .",
    "the ns cools down via neutrino emission from the stellar interior in the first @xmath4 years ( yakovlev & pethick 2004 ) , and several types of neutrino sources in the ns cores have been proposed as cooling mechanisms , such as the direct urca ( du ) , modified urca ( mu ) processes and nucleon - nucleon bremsstrahlung ( see the review articles , yakovlev et al . 1999 , 2001 ; page et al .",
    "2004 , 2006 ) .",
    "it has been stressed that the ns cooling relies on many factors ( yakovlev et al .",
    "1999 ) , including the neutrino emission mechanisms , heat capacity , thermal conductivity and reheating mechanisms in dense and superfluid states of matter .",
    "the latter has to be described as a quasi - degenerate fermi system characterized by a large depletion of the fermi surface due to the strong short - range correlations of nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath5 ) interaction ( migdal 1967 ) .",
    "the @xmath0-factor , that measures the deviation from a perfect fermi gas described by the fermi - dirac distribution ( @xmath6 ) can take values much less than one .",
    "this fact influences the level density of nucleons around the fermi surface that controls many properties of fermion systems related to particle - hole excitations around the fermi energy . in our previous work ,",
    "the @xmath0 factor effect on the @xmath1 superfluidity of pure neutron matter was studied ( dong et al .",
    "2013 ) and found that the gap was dramatically reduced . in this work",
    ", we generalize the previous approach to investigate the neutron @xmath1 superfluidity of asymmetric nuclear matter and @xmath7-stable matter .",
    "the ns interior is assumed to be made of @xmath8 matter without exotic degrees of freedom .",
    "in such a context the @xmath0 factor effects on various neutrino processes and heat capacity , and on ns cooling are calculated .",
    "the material is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , superfluidity , various neutrino processes and heat capacity affected by the fermi surface depletion are respectively calculated and analyzed .",
    "based on those results as inputs , the ns cooling is discussed in sec .",
    "finally a summary is given in sec .",
    "the deviation of a correlated fermi system from the ideal degenerate fermi gas is measured by the quasiparticle strength ( migdal 1967 ) @xmath9_{\\omega=\\epsilon(k)}^{-1},\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is the self - energy as a function of momentum @xmath11 and energy @xmath12 . according to the migdal - luttinger theorem ( migdal 1960 ) , the @xmath0 factor at the fermi surface equals the discontinuity of the occupation number at the fermi surface .",
    "we calculated the @xmath0 factors in the framework of the brueckner - hartree - fock ( bhf ) approach by employing the av18 two - body force with a microscopic three body force ( li et al .",
    "the self - energy is truncated to the fourth order of the expansion in powers of g - matrix , namely , @xmath13 ( jeukenne et al .",
    "figure  [ fig : occupation ] displays , for the sake of illustration , the occupation probability of neutrons and protons in strongly asymmetric nuclear matter .",
    "the momentum distribution around the fermi surface significantly departs from the typical profile of a degenerate fermi system especially at high densities , which is attributed to the strong short - range correlations . in figure",
    "[ fig : z ] , we show the @xmath0 factors at the fermi surface @xmath14 calculated for nuclear matter in a @xmath7-stable state , suitable for application to nss .",
    "the fraction of each component is determined by the eos of nuclear matter from a bhf calculation .",
    "in @xmath7-stable nuclear matter , the effect of the neutron - proton @xmath15sd@xmath16 coupling tensor channel ( namely , @xmath17 sd channel where @xmath18 is the total isospin of two nucleons ) of the nuclear interaction drives the deviation of neutron and proton z - factors vs. total density . at very low density",
    "the system is mainly composed of neutrons and the neutron @xmath14 is that of a degenerate fermi gas weakly interacting with few protons . on the contrary ,",
    "the very diluted proton fraction is strongly interacting , via the @xmath17 force , with large neutron excess , resulting into a strong depletion of the proton momentum distribution at low density . as the total density increases , also the proton fraction density increases for the competition with @xmath19 force inducing an increasing @xmath14 value .",
    "therefore , from the interplay between the two mechanisms the proton @xmath14 first increases and then decreases as shown in the figure .",
    "the calculated @xmath0 factor will be used in the following calculations .     and density @xmath20 @xmath21 .",
    "( a color version of this figure is available in the online journal.),scaledwidth=40.0% ]     factors vs density in @xmath7-stable matter .",
    "the fraction of each component is determined by symmetry energy from the bhf approximation.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]      the superfluidity gap at the fermi surface quenches all processes that involve elementary excitations around the fermi surface , which could lead to an remarkable effect on the ns cooling .",
    "the @xmath1 superfluidity in pure neutron matter has been investigated in a previous work with the inclusion of the @xmath0 factor ( dong et al .",
    "here we generalized the investigation to isospin - asymmetric nuclear matter in @xmath7-stable condition .",
    "the @xmath1 pairing gaps are determined by the following coupled equations @xmath22 with @xmath23^{2}+\\delta _ { k}^{2}}$ ] and",
    "@xmath25 is the matrix element of the realistic @xmath5 interaction including three - body forces . here",
    "the angle - average approximation is adopted , and the relation between the gap at @xmath26 and the critical temperature @xmath27 is given by @xmath28 ( baldo et al .",
    "1992 ) .",
    "gap vs. total baryonic density in @xmath7-stable nuclear matter .",
    "the calculations with @xmath6 and @xmath29 are shown for comparison.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the calculated neutron @xmath1 gaps for the @xmath7-stable matter are depicted in figure  [ fig : n3pf2-beta ] , with @xmath6 ( upper ponel ) and @xmath29 ( lower panel ) .",
    "similar to the case of the pure neutron matter ( dong et al .",
    "2013 ) , the @xmath0 factor effect quenches the peak value by about one order of magnitude , and it is extremely sizable at higher densities . ding et al .",
    "( 2015 ) calculated the influence of short - range correlations on the @xmath1 pairing gap in pure neutron matter at high density with a different method , and also found that the gap is strongly suppressed .",
    "the peak value drops to 0.04 mev and the superfluidity domain shrinks to @xmath30 @xmath21 .",
    "such a weak superfluidity is not expected to explain the observed rapid cooling of nss in the case of cas a via the enhanced neutrino emission from the onset of the breaking and formation of neutron @xmath1 cooper pairs .",
    "therefore , the role of the @xmath1 superfluidity in ns cooling is limited .",
    "the @xmath1 pairing gaps do not change very much , even if the fraction of each component is controlled by a soft symmetry energy , such as in the case of apr eos ( akmal et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "gap as a function of nucleonic density in asymmetric matter for various isospin asymmetries @xmath7.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    to further explore the @xmath1 superfluidity , the neutron gaps as a function of the total nucleonic density @xmath31 for different isospin asymmetries @xmath7 were calculated , and the results are shown in figure  [ fig : n3pf2 ] . the isospin asymmetry is defined as @xmath32 , where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the neutron and proton density , respectively . as @xmath7 increases ,",
    "the neutron density for a given total nucleonic density increases either .",
    "accordingly , the peak value of the gap increases and their corresponding location shifts to lower density , that is primarily attributed to the decrease of the neutron @xmath0 factor for increasing @xmath7 . anyway , due to the departure of the system from the ideal degenerate limit , the neutron @xmath1 gap is dramatically suppressed and the peak value is no more than 0.05 mev . for the nuclear matter with small isospin asymmetry , the gap may be vanishingly small .",
    "therefore , in finite nuclei , the pairing comes from the @xmath1 channel is completely negligible .",
    "since the deformation of the fermi surface hinders particle - hole excitations around the fermi level , the neutrino emission is accordingly expected to be depressed . to determine the neutrino emissivity , the key step is to derive the nucleon momentum distribution @xmath35 @xmath36 at finite temperature @xmath37 and @xmath0 ( kadanoff & baym 1962 ) .",
    "the spectral function @xmath38 is a weighting function with total weight unity .",
    "@xmath39 $ ] is fermi distribution with temperature @xmath37 and chemical potential @xmath40 .",
    "in the limit when @xmath11 is extremely close to the fermi momentum , the spectral function @xmath38 can be expressed as @xmath41 as a consequence , the momentum distribution function @xmath35 of nucleon close to the fermi surface is given as @xmath42    the most efficient neutrino emission is provided by du processes in the ns core @xmath43 which correspond to neutron beta decay and proton electron capture , respectively .",
    "the du process occurs only if the proton fraction is sufficiently high .",
    "we derive the neutrino emissivity @xmath44 of the du process under the beta - equilibrium condition with the inclusion of the @xmath0 factor .",
    "it is given by @xmath45 \\left ( 1-f_{l}\\right ) , \\label{b}\\ ] ] where @xmath46 is the beta decay differential probability , @xmath47 is the distribution function of nucleons including the @xmath0 factor , and @xmath48 the fermi - dirac distribution function of leptons .",
    "since the main contribution to this integral stems from the very narrow regions of momentum space close to the fermi surface of each particle , the distribution function of equation ( [ a ] ) can be employed here , and thus the above equation ( [ b ] ) reduces to @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the neutrino emissivity of the du process without introducing the @xmath0 factor , which has been well studied ( see , e.g . , the review papers , yakovlev et al . 1999 , 2001 ) .        it is usually believed that one of the main neutrino energy loss processes in nss are the mu process , which are several orders of magnitude less efficient than the du processes .",
    "the mu processes differ from the direct one by a bystander nucleon required to allow momentum conservation @xmath51 where @xmath52 denotes neutron or proton .",
    "it is labeled by the superscript @xmath53 , where @xmath54 denotes the neutron ( proton ) branch of the mu processes .",
    "analogously to the procedure for the du processes , we derive the neutrino emissivity under the condition of beta equilibrium @xmath55    the nucleon - nucleon bremsstrahlung process @xmath56 is another neutrino process based on neutral current that produces @xmath57 pairs to take away the neutron star thermal energy , but is much less efficient than the mu processes .",
    "the corresponding neutrino emissivities with the inclusion of the @xmath0 factor are @xmath58    the onset of pairing also opens a new channel of neutrino emission due to the continuous formation and breaking of cooper pairs @xmath59 + \\nu + \\overline{\\nu } , \\ ] ] that leads to energy release via @xmath57 emission , being analogous to the nucleon - nucleon bremsstrahlung process .",
    "it is very intense at temperatures slightly below the critical temperature @xmath27 ( page et al .",
    "2006 , 2009 ) , and it can be one order of magnitude more efficient than the pairing unsuppressed mu processes ( page et al .",
    "this cooper pair breaking and formation ( pbf ) process due to neutron @xmath1 pairing may be employed to explain the observed rapid cooling of the neutron star in cas a ( page et al . 2011 ) . with the inclusion of @xmath0 factor ,",
    "the neutrino emissivity @xmath60 is given as @xmath61    figure  [ fig : emission ] displays the calculated @xmath62 for the du , mu , and bremsstrahlung processes as a function of density @xmath31 .",
    "the du process occurs just when the proton fraction exceeds a critical threshold , and the threshold relies on the density dependence of the symmetry energy at high densities .",
    "a stiff symmetry energy , such as that from the brueckner theory , gives a low threshold .",
    "( 2008 ) showed that the modification of the nucleon momentum distribution due to the short - range correlations results in a significant enhancement of the neutrino emissivity of the du process , and the du process has a probability of being opened even for low proton fractions .",
    "however , our calculations reveal that the neutrino emissivity is reduced by more than @xmath63 , that is in complete contrast to their conclusion .",
    "we stress that , the short range correlations responsible of the fermi surface depletion should be embodied in the quasiparticle properties , because the real system is actually a degenerate system of quasiparticles with the same fermi momentum as the previous one",
    ". therefore the kinematic conditions giving rise to threshold for du process does not change .",
    "the beta decay of neutrons and its inverse reaction can be cyclically triggered just by thermal excitation , and thus @xmath64 and @xmath65 states do not participate into the du process because the thermal energy @xmath66 is too low to excite those states .",
    "accordingly , the occupation probability of proton hole for the thermal excitation , namely @xmath67 $ ] , should be employed in equation ( [ b ] ) , instead of @xmath68 $ ] .",
    "the neutrino emissivity for the mu processes are reduced by @xmath69 for the neutron branch and @xmath70 for the proton branch . because the proton @xmath0 factor is lower than the neutron one , as shown in figure  [ fig : z ] ,",
    "the @xmath71 of proton branch is more intensively depressed by the fermi surface depletion . at high densities such as @xmath72 @xmath21 , the @xmath71",
    "is reduced by one order of magnitude .",
    "similarly , the nucleon - nucleon bremsstrahlung for @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 are reduced more distinctly at high densities .",
    "the computed @xmath62 for those processes do not rely on whether or not the superfluidity set on .",
    "the @xmath62 with a soft symmetry energy from apr ( akmal et al .",
    "1998 ) does not provide very different results compared with those within bhf for the mu , nucleon - nucleon bremsstrahlung and pbf processes , but the threshold of the du process is much larger due to the softer symmetry energy .",
    "the specific heat capacity of the stellar interior is the sum of the contributions of each fraction @xmath76 ( leptons and nucleons ) ( page et al .",
    "2004 ) @xmath77 @xmath78 and @xmath79 are effective mass and fermi momentum of particle @xmath76 .",
    "this equation is obtained under the assumption of non - correlated gas described by the fermi - dirac distribution .",
    "if the effect of the fermi surface depletion is included , the specific heat of the nucleon@xmath76 is given by @xmath80 the heat capacity can be still altered by strong superfluidity .     factors , with @xmath0 factors only in superfluidity , with @xmath0 factors both in superfluidity and neutrino emission and with @xmath0 factors in the three inputs are shown for comparison . the inset shows the neutron and proton @xmath0 factors vs density in @xmath7-stable matter , the fraction of each component being determined by the apr eos .",
    "( a color version of this figure is available in the online journal . ) , scaledwidth=45.0% ]",
    "to show the influence of the @xmath0-factor induced reduction of the above three inputs afore discussed , namely , pairing gaps , neutrino emissivity and heat capacity , on ns cooling , we calculated the cooling curve for canonical neutron stars using the publicly available code nscool@xmath81}$ ] .",
    "we employ the minimal cooling paradigm ( page et al .",
    "2006 ) without fast neutrino emission , with no charged meson condensate , no hyperons , no confinement quarks in canonical nss .",
    "therefore , we select the apr eos and the above results as inputs , and the cooling curves are displayed in figure  [ fig : cooling ] .",
    "the @xmath0 factor suppressing the neutron @xmath1 superfluidity , retards the neutron star cooling for the first @xmath82 years but accelerates the cooling thereafter .",
    "the critical temperature @xmath27 for neutron @xmath1 superfluidity is quite low as a result of the inclusion of @xmath0 factor .",
    "therefore , the pbf cooling channel opens as soon as the stellar tempereture falls below the @xmath27 , which leads to a relatively fast cooling because it is more efficient than mu processes .",
    "the weak neutron @xmath1 superfluidity , dramatically quenched by the fermi surface depletion , can not play a significant role in cooling of young nss .",
    "the @xmath0 factor substantially reduces the neutrino emission of mu , nucleon - nucleon bremsstrahlung and pbf processes , and thus it slows down the thermal energy loss .",
    "therefore , it significantly retards the cooling .",
    "the heat capacity of the neutron star is reduced by the @xmath0 factor , with the result that the thermal energy turns lower than in the case of excluding of the @xmath0-factor effect . as a consequence ,",
    "the ns cooling turns out to be enhanced , but this effect is not so sharpt , as shown in figure  [ fig : cooling ] .",
    "it is well - known that the neutrino emission and heat capacity are sensitive to the superfluidity of stellar interior .",
    "however , due to the weak neutron @xmath1 superfluidity reduced by the @xmath0 factor , neutrino emissivity and heat capacity can not be suppressed . in a word ,",
    "the effect of the fermi surface depletion of nucleons on ns cooling can not be neglected , when an accurate theoretical study of the cooling is performed , as in the case of the cooling of the ns remnant of cas a.",
    "we have investigated the superfluidity , neutrino emissivity for du , mu , nucleon - nucleon bremsstrahlung and pbf processes and heat capacity , taking into account the fermi surface depletion characterized by the @xmath0 factor .",
    "the @xmath0 factor is calculated in the framework of the bhf approach using the two body av18 force plus a microscopic three body force .",
    "the superfluidity , neutrino emissivity and heat capacity are reduced by the @xmath0 factor , specially at high baryonic density .",
    "the effect of the fermi surface depletion is needed to be included in a theoretically rigorous exploration of the ns thermal evolution , such as for the ns remnant in cas a whose cooling rate was measured .",
    "finally , based on the above results , we calculated the cooling curve for canonical nss using the apr eos , and we found that the fermi surface depletion visibly affects the ns cooling .",
