    "despite recent improvements in simulations of core - collapse supernova ( ccsn ) explosions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) the understanding of supernova still has major gaps , and observations of sn and their ejecta still provide many puzzles ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "of particular importance may be the assymmetric nature of the explosion and the hydrodynamic development of the layers ejected after the explosion ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "several types of pre - solar grains from primitive carbonaceous meteorites that are associated with sn nucleosynthesis due to their isotopic ratios ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) provide constraints on these explosions .",
    "pre - solar grains carry the signatures of their stellar origin , and their interpretation may help to guide ccsn models .",
    "silicon carbide is one of the types of stardust grains that have been identified in primitive meteorites ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . while most of these so - called presolar sic grains originate in asymptotic giant branch stars , there are two rare sub - types of sic grains that have a ccsn origin .",
    "type x grains ( about 1% of all presolar sic grains ) , have large excesses in @xmath3si .",
    "this signature and evidence for the initial presence of @xmath4ti in a subset of these grains is proof of their sn origin : both isotopes are predicted to be abundant in the si / s zone of supernovae @xcite .",
    "more recently , @xcite , hereafter p13 , showed that @xmath3si and @xmath4ti may also be produced at the bottom of the he shell exposed to high shock velocities and/or high energies , reproducing several isotopic abundance patterns typical of sic x grains and graphites from sne .",
    "silicon carbide grains of type c are even rarer ( about 0.1% of all sic grains ) than sic x grains .",
    "they have a large excess in @xmath5si and @xmath6si and most of them have been found by automatic searches in the nanosims detection apparatus . some of these grains contain extinct @xmath4ti , similar to sic - x grains .",
    "just over a dozen of these grains have been identified , and nine have been analyzed for their s isotopic ratios , showing large @xmath0s excesses , with @xmath0s/@xmath7s ratios ranging up to 16 times solar @xcite .",
    "this is puzzling , because in existing sn models the only zone with large @xmath0s excesses is the si / s zone @xcite , which has large @xmath3si excesses , whereas zones with @xmath3si depletions ( i.e. , @xmath8si excesses ) are predicted to have also @xmath0s depletions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite have invoked element fractionation between sulfur and silicon by molecule chemistry in the sn ejecta to explain this result . however",
    ", this ad hoc explanation can not explain all the data , especially the s isotopic composition of one c grain with @xmath9(@xmath10s/@xmath0s ) and @xmath9(@xmath11s/@xmath0s ) values being as low as -940  @xcite , even more extreme than those of s in the si / s zone .",
    "in this paper we propose that the @xmath0s excesses in c grains are due to the radioactive decay of short - lived @xmath0si ( @xmath12 years , * ? ? ?",
    "we present models of explosive nucleosynthesis in the inner part of the he / c zone where @xmath5si and @xmath6si as well as @xmath0s excesses can be produced while maintaining a c - rich environment .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in  [ sec : models_description ] we describe the stellar models and the nucleosynthesis calculations , in  [ sec : comparison ] we compare theoretical results with measurements for c grains . finally , in ",
    "[ sec : summary ] we give our conclusions .",
    "this investigation is based on seven sn explosion models for a @xmath13 , @xmath14 star , three of which were introduced in p13 .",
    "the pre - supernova evolution is calculated with the code genec @xcite .",
    "the explosion simulations include the fallback prescription by @xcite , and are performed for a case with recommended initial shock velocity and six cases where the latter is reduced by a factor of 2 , 4 , 5 , 10 , 20 and 100 , respectively ( models 15r , 15r2 , 15r4 , 15r5 , 15r10 , 15r20 and 15r100 ) .",
    "the standard initial shock velocity used beyond fallback is @xmath15 .",
    "the kinetic explosion energy for these 15 m@xmath16 models ranges from @xmath17 to less than @xmath18 .",
    "the post - processing code mppnp is used to calculate the nucleosynthesis in the star before and during the explosion ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for the present study we focus only on the c -",
    "rich explosive he burning layers , including the he / c zone and a small part of the o / c zone .",
    "the abundances of key species and @xmath19si are reported in fig.[fig : si_chain ] for models 15r and 15r4 .",
    "results are similar for the intermediate model 15r2 .",
    "the bottom of the he / c zone is strongly affected by the explosion . while @xmath20c is not significantly modified ,",
    "@xmath21o is depleted and feeds the production of heavier @xmath22-isotopes , including @xmath3si .",
    "this stellar region was defined as the c / si zone in p13 .",
    "the main reason for this behavior is the higher @xmath22-capture rates starting from the @xmath21o(@xmath22,@xmath23)@xmath24ne reaction than that of the @xmath20c(@xmath22,@xmath23)@xmath21o reaction at explosive he shell temperatures ( as explained by p13 ) .",
    "models with lower shock velocities show weaker explosion signatures .",
    "in particular , model 15r100 does not show any significant departures from pre - explosive abundances during the explosion in the c - rich region .    along the si neutron capture chain , @xmath25si and heavier unstable si species",
    "are produced efficiently by neutron captures starting from @xmath3si .",
    "the larger explosion temperatures in model 15r than in model 15r4 are pushing the production peaks of different si neutron - rich species to larger mass coordinates , not significantly affecting their absolute abundance . therefore , abundance yields for the si isotopes in the explosive he shell result from the interplay between @xmath22-captures and neutron captures , triggered by activation of the @xmath26ne(@xmath22,n)@xmath27 mg neutron source ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "the main abundance features and dominating nucleosynthesis fluxes for two different times of the sn explosion are given in fig.[fig : abund_and_flux ] , in the so - called c / si zone ( m @xmath28 2.95 m@xmath16 , model 15r , see also p13 ) .",
    "in the early stages of the explosion , depending on the available @xmath26ne , the @xmath22-capture path starting from @xmath21o is accompanied by ( n,@xmath23)(@xmath22,n ) sequences , producing the same @xmath22-species .",
    "an example is @xmath24ne(@xmath22,@xmath23)@xmath29 mg and @xmath24ne(n,@xmath23)@xmath30ne(@xmath22,n)@xmath29 mg . during the later stages of the explosion and/or low @xmath26ne abundances , the ( @xmath22,@xmath23 ) fluxes become dominant .",
    "note that for explosive he burning conditions the ( @xmath22,p ) fluxes are compensated by their reverse reactions , and proton captures on the abundant @xmath22-isotopes do not affect the abundance of their parent species because of the efficient reverse ( @xmath23,p ) photodisintegrations .",
    "in the present calculations , we use for the ( n,@xmath23 ) reactions on unstable si species the rates from hauser - feshbach ( hf ) calculations by the non - smoker code @xcite , available in jina reaclib v1.1  ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the uncertainties of the neutron capture rates in the mass region of @xmath0si are very large .",
    "figure  [ fig:32sihf_and_siresonances ] , upper panel , shows the maxwellian averaged cross section ( macs ) for neutron capture on @xmath0si as calculated from the hf codes coh@xmath31  @xcite and talys 1.4  @xcite , and non - smoker . at a temperature near 90 kev ( @xmath32 )",
    "we see a difference of almost two orders of magnitude between the highest ( from coh@xmath31 ) and the lowest calculated values ( talys 1.4 ) .",
    "notice , however , that these theoretical predictions are still consistent within the large uncertainty of the @xmath0si(n,@xmath23)@xmath10si rate .",
    "the large uncertainty is due to the nuclear level density being too low to apply the hf model for neutron - rich isotopes of si .",
    "the model relies on the statistical averaging over levels in the compound nucleus and thus a sufficiently high nuclear level density is required at the compound formation energy  @xcite .",
    "the endf / b - vii.1 library of  @xcite provides the location of neutron capture resonances for even - even nuclei near @xmath0si , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:32sihf_and_siresonances ] , lower panel .",
    "while no data are available on @xmath0si neutron capture resonances , the neighboring even - even nuclei @xmath6si and @xmath3si give an indication of the number of levels accessible at different incident particle energies . above an energy of @xmath33",
    "kev statistical methods become appropriate . for this reason , we considered an uncertainty of a factor of 100 for the @xmath0si neutron capture cross section .",
    "the impact of this uncertainty is presented in  [ sec : comparison ] .    where experimental knowledge of the single resonances has been obtained , such as in the case of @xmath3si and @xmath6si",
    ", uncertainties may still arise from the precise location and strength of each resonance .",
    "however , uncertainties from experiment are expected to be much lower than those introduced by the use of hf calculations in an inappropriate region .",
    "we compare in fig.[fig : si_s_delta_grains ] the abundances from the c - rich ejecta from our models (  [ sec : models_description ] ) originating from the c / si zone , the whole he / c zone and the c - rich part of the he / n zone , with isotopic ratios of single sic x and c grains from the st .",
    "louis presolar grains database @xcite .",
    "no mixing between layers is considered and sic - x and c grains with @xmath20c/@xmath34c lower than solar are excluded .",
    "they are not reproduced by these models that have high c isotopic ratio .",
    "the standard model ( 15r , upper panel , layer 1 fig.[fig : si_s_delta_grains ] ) shows a strong @xmath3si and @xmath0s production and absence of @xmath0si in the c / si zone during the explosion ( see also p13 ) .",
    "outward , in the inner part of the he / c zone , the lower explosion temperatures and the neutron burst triggered by the @xmath26ne(@xmath22,n)@xmath27 mg ( @xmath35 process , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) gradually reduce @xmath3si- and @xmath0s - enrichments , whereas @xmath0si is synthesized and accumulated according to its neutron capture cross section ( as discussed in  [ sec : models_description ] ) .",
    "the outer parts of the he / c zone show mild enrichments of the stable neutron - rich si and s isotopes due to pre - explosive @xmath36-processing .",
    "the @xmath3si - excess observed in sic x grains are reproduced in parts of the c / si zone for the models 15r and 15r2 ( e.g , layer @xmath37 of model 15r , fig.[fig : si_s_delta_grains ] , lower panel ) .",
    "sic c grains show larger @xmath0s - excesses than sic x grains , and positive @xmath9(@xmath6si ) .",
    "such a signature is consistent with abundance predictions from more external zones in the c - rich he shell . in models 15r4 - 15r20",
    "the shock temperature is not sufficient to reproduce the @xmath3si - excess observed in sic x grains ( see also p13 ) .",
    "conversely , the presented models can reproduce the si and s isotopic ratios in the c grains over a large range in initial shock velocities .",
    "also in case of contamination or mixing with isotopically more normal material ( see p13 ) , the grain signatures can be explained since @xmath9(@xmath6si ) values up to @xmath28 15000@xmath3820000 ( e.g. , models 15r , 15r2 and 15r4 , zones `` 2 '' and `` 3 '' ) are associated with large @xmath0s enrichments ( @xmath9(@xmath11s ) @xmath28 @xmath381000 , fig.[fig : si_s_delta_grains ] , lower panel , outside the plot range ) . for most of the he shell material",
    "the @xmath0si signature dominates s isotopic anomalies , assuming an arbitrary si / s fractionation of 10@xmath39 during grain formation ( fig.[fig : si_s_delta_grains ] , lower panel ) .",
    "this assumption expresses the hypothesis that all @xmath0s observed in c grains originates from the decay of @xmath0si ( see below for details ) .",
    "only little s condenses into sic grains , justifying the assumed elemental fractionation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : si32dsi28 ] , upper panel , we show the @xmath0si/@xmath3si isotopic ratios from different models described in  [ sec : models_description ] , comparing them with the ratios inferred for c grains from the radiogenic @xmath0s .",
    "we estimated the ratio of the radioactive @xmath0si ( @xmath0s@xmath40 ) to @xmath3si and thus the original @xmath0si/@xmath3si ratio by assuming that all the s ( s@xmath41 ) in the grains was either @xmath0s@xmath40 or isotopically normal s ( s@xmath42 ) from contamination .",
    "the latter assumption is based on the fact that s is volatile and is not likely to condense into sic .",
    "the grains are therefore expected to contain only marginal intrinsic s. second , the s concentrations are low in the he shell layers with no @xmath3si enrichment .",
    "finally , some of the s isotopic images of the c grains measured showed @xmath11s to be more abundant at the edges of the grains and @xmath0s excesses to be higher in interior than in border regions .",
    "we determined the atomic @xmath0si/@xmath3si ratios by applying a s@xmath43/si@xmath43 sensitivity factor of 3 , inferred from measurements of si and s ion yields on synthetic sic and mundrabilla fes , respectively @xcite . since @xmath0s@xmath41 = @xmath0s@xmath40+@xmath0s@xmath42 and @xmath0s@xmath40 = @xmath44s@xmath45(@xmath0s@xmath40+@xmath0s@xmath42 )",
    ", we obtained the @xmath0s@xmath40/@xmath3si ratios by multiplying @xmath0s/@xmath3si with @xmath44s . here",
    "@xmath0s@xmath42 is @xmath0s of the isotopically normal component s@xmath42 ( assumed to be contamination ) .",
    "for @xmath9s we took the average of @xmath9(@xmath10s/@xmath0s ) and @xmath9(@xmath11s/@xmath0s ) . within errors the latter two values are equal for all measured grains , providing additional evidence that we are dealing just with an excess in @xmath0si . in fig .",
    "[ fig : si32dsi28 ] , we show that the observed range of @xmath0si/@xmath3si ratios is matched by predictions from stellar models at different energies , in agreement with fig.[fig : si_s_delta_grains ] .",
    "typical conditions required for matching the inferred @xmath0si/@xmath3si ratios ( e.g. , at m = 3.4 m@xmath16 for models 15r4 and 15r5 ) have a peak temperature of @xmath46 and a neutron density peak of @xmath47 , with a @xmath3si mass fraction of @xmath48 .",
    "the models 15r-15r5 with the highest explosion temperatures also fit the observed @xmath0si/@xmath3si ratio deeper in the he shell ( e.g. , at m = 3.05 m@xmath16 for model 15r and 15r2 ) , with a @xmath3si mass fraction of @xmath49 . in these cases ,",
    "the temperature peak is about @xmath50 , with a neutron density peak of a few @xmath51 for few 10@xmath52 , dropping quickly to densities more typical of the @xmath35 process .",
    "since the grains may contain some normal component ( p13 ) , the inferred @xmath0si/@xmath3si needs to be considered a lower limit of the original ratio in the he shell material . in fig .",
    "[ fig : si32dsi28 ] , lower panel , we show that increasing the neutron capture cross section of @xmath0si by a factor of 100 ( see discussion in  [ sec : models_description ] ) does not change our results . by reducing the @xmath0si maxwellian - averaged cross section ( macs ) of the same factor the @xmath0si/@xmath3si ratio increases by less than 10% , since the @xmath0si macs adopted in our models is already lower than 1 mb , behaving as a bottle - neck in the neutron capture flow feeding heavier si species .",
    "note that at the temperatures of explosive he - burning the half - life of @xmath0si can be reduced down to few days ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , the timescale of the explosive nucleosynthesis is less than @xmath28 0.3 secs , and the impact of the @xmath0si half - life in the calculations is negligible .",
    "we have shown that ccsn models can explain the large @xmath0s - excess measured in sic c grains by the radioactive decay of the unstable isotope @xmath0si after grain formation .",
    "furthermore , in sic c grains most of the remaining s is coming from contamination .",
    "we have identified two typical conditions where the correct @xmath0si/@xmath3si ratio can be obtained , depending on the explosion temperature and on the abundance of @xmath3si .",
    "we have compared the isotopic signatures in presolar sic grains of type c with nucleosynthesis predictions for ccsn ejecta exposed to different shock velocities .",
    "we propose that the seemingly incompatible si and s isotopic ratios in these grains are explained by assuming that the @xmath0s excess observed today originates from radioactive @xmath0si that condensed into the forming sic grains , and decayed into @xmath0s at later stages .",
    "assuming that all the remaining s is due to contamination , we estimated the @xmath0si/@xmath3si ratio in the parent ccsn ejecta , ranging from a few 10@xmath53 to a few 10@xmath54 .",
    "we propose this ratio to be a lower limit of its original value in the explosive he shell layers , depending on the level of contamination or mixing with more normal material for each c grain .",
    "such ratios can be produced for different shock velocities and/or explosion energies .",
    "two typical conditions reproducing directly the observed @xmath0si/@xmath3si ratios are : one with high temperature and large @xmath3si abundance ( @xmath55 and @xmath49 , respectively ) , and one with temperature @xmath56 and @xmath3si abundance @xmath48 . in the first case the neutron density reaches a peak of a few @xmath51 for few 10@xmath52 , rapidly dropping to values more typical of the @xmath35-process neutron - burst . in the second case ,",
    "the neutron density peak is on the order of 10@xmath57 .    in conclusion ,",
    "c grains carry a record of the neutron density reached in the explosive he shell of the ccsn where they formed .",
    "we showed that the theoretical nuclear reactions in the @xmath0si mass region have large uncertainties , but our results are not significantly affected .",
