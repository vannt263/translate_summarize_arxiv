    "measurements of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix elements @xcite are of great importance , being fundamental parameters of the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "the matrix elements display a strong hierarchy , and the smaller off - diagonal terms can be expressed as higher powers of an expansion parameter @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "one of the smallest elements is @xmath4 , being of order @xmath12 and with a magnitude @xmath13 .",
    "although the measurement of @xmath5 is very challenging , in recent years its precision has been reduced to @xmath14 at the @xmath7 factories .",
    "two ways to measure @xmath5 have been utilized : inclusive semi - leptonic decays ( @xmath15 ) and exclusive semi - leptonic decays ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "these two approaches provide independent measurements of @xmath5 , which are currently not in total agreement , but have roughly the same precision .",
    "both of these methods can be employed at high - luminosity @xmath7 factories , and the experimental error in the determination of @xmath5 will decrease with increasing integrated luminosity and improved analysis techniques .",
    "the inclusive and exclusive determinations of @xmath5 have independent theoretical errors , and it is acknowledged that a concurrent reduction of this theoretical error ( i.e. comparable in degree to that for the experimental error ) is more challenging ( e.g. see @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , as emphasized in @xcite it is important to consider alternative methods of measuring @xmath5 for which the theoretical error is known to be very small , even if the experimental error for such a method is currently large .",
    "one such approach is the branching ratio ( br ) of the purely leptonic decay @xmath17 .",
    "the unprecedented data samples provided by the @xmath7 factories have enabled the first measurements of @xmath17 @xcite despite its relatively small br and challenging signature .",
    "the current world average of br(@xmath17 ) has an error of @xmath18 , although proposed high - luminosity flavour factories could reach a precision of @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "a measurement of @xmath20 can be obtained from this decay , where @xmath21 is the decay constant for the @xmath22 meson , which has been calculated by lattice quantum chromodynamics ( lqcd ) .",
    "an average of two unquenched calculations @xcite of @xmath21 gives @xmath23 mev @xcite , i.e. a precision of @xmath24 .",
    "hence the decay @xmath17 ( and its companion decay @xmath25 , which is yet to be observed ) , could provide complementary ( and possibly competitive ) measurements of @xmath5 at high - luminosity flavour factories .    however , despite the impressive improvement in the precision of calculations of @xmath21 by lqcd , it is important to extract @xmath5 with minimal theoretical error ( i.e. with minimal dependence on parameters like @xmath21 , which are determined by the strong interaction ) .",
    "it was pointed out long ago @xcite that a double ratio of the leptonic decays @xmath26 and @xmath3 has essentially no dependence on the absolute values of the decay constants .",
    "the decay constants in this double ratio appear as @xmath27 , and such a quantity is numerically very close to 1 , with a very small error .",
    "hence such a double ratio can be used to obtain a measurement of @xmath5 with a small theoretical error @xcite . at the time of writing of @xcite ,",
    "only one of the four decays had been measured ( @xmath3 ) . at present ,",
    "three of the four decays have been observed , and the prospect of precise measurements of all four decays in this double ratio motivates us to quantify the expected precision for a measurement of @xmath5 using this method .",
    "the decays @xmath2 @xcite , @xmath28 @xcite and @xmath29 @xcite have been measured with @xmath14 precision at cleo - c and the @xmath7 factories , and the ongoing bes - iii experiment will reduce the error in all these decays to maybe @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "the current measurements of @xmath17 , @xmath2 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are in agreement with the sm prediction , within the errors of the decay constants .",
    "an upper limit exists for the decay @xmath31 ( @xmath32 at 95 c.l .",
    "@xcite ) and this is the only decay in the double ratio which has not been observed . at the cern lhc , the lhcb experiment is expected to achieve sensitivity to the sm prediction of br(@xmath31 ) @xmath33 .",
    "therefore the first measurement of the double ratio will be possible by combining the measurements of these four leptonic decays from three distinct experimental facilities .",
    "the above purely leptonic decays are sensitive to new physics particles which arise in supersymmetric ( susy ) models , such as charged higgs bosons ( @xmath34 ) , neutral higgs bosons @xmath35 and @xmath36 , and charginos ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "the decays @xmath17 , @xmath2 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are sensitive to @xmath34 at the _ tree level _ @xcite .",
    "the largest effect is for @xmath17 and the current measurement of this br , although in agreement with the sm prediction , does not preclude a large contribution from @xmath34@xcite on @xmath17 is now possibly disfavoured by considering the contribution of @xmath34 on other decays such as @xmath38 . ] .",
    "the effect of @xmath34 on @xmath28 and @xmath29 is much smaller @xcite , but can be of the order of the current experimental precision @xcite .",
    "the contribution of @xmath34 to @xmath2 is negligible .",
    "the decay @xmath31 , which proceeds via higher - order diagrams in perturbation theory , can be greatly enhanced by contributions from neutral higgs bosons and chargino - stop loops .",
    "the contributions from susy grow with @xmath39 , which can lead to an enhancement of br(@xmath31 ) by an order of magnitude with respect to the sm expectation @xcite .",
    "since the decays involved in the leptonic double ratios can receive substantial contributions from higgs bosons and supersymmetric particles , another possible application of the double ratio is to constrain susy parameters .",
    "the absence of an explicit dependence on the decay constants makes the double ratio a particularly attractive quantity with which to probe susy . in this case",
    ", @xmath4 is an input parameter and is the only major source of uncertainty .",
    "information on @xmath4 is available from both direct measurements ( the aforementioned inclusive and exclusive semileptonic decays , the latter having some dependence on lqcd ) and from global sm fits .",
    "in contrast , the calculation of decay constants is reliant on lqcd .",
    "consequently , due to its reduced theoretical uncertainties the double ratio constitutes a cleaner observable than the individual decays , and can provide competitive constraints on susy parameters .    the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 the conventional ways to measure @xmath5 are briefly summarized and the double ratio of leptonic decays is introduced . in section 3 ,",
    "the decay rates of the leptonic decays are presented and the experimental prospects for their measurements are discussed .",
    "the current upper limit on the double ratio is derived , as well as the anticipated error in a measurement of @xmath5 at future experimental facilities using the double ratio .",
    "section 4 contains a numerical study of the double ratio as a probe of the susy parameter space in two distinct models .",
    "conclusions are given in section 5 .",
    "currently there are two methods which are used to measure @xmath5 .",
    "both methods use a semi - leptonic decay channel of the @xmath40 meson for which the decay rate depends on @xmath41 .",
    "one method ( `` inclusive approach '' ) is to measure the branching ratio of the inclusive decay @xmath42 while the other method ( `` exclusive approach '' ) is to measure the branching ratio of the exclusive decays @xmath16 and @xmath43 .",
    "the value of @xmath5 is then extracted from these measurements , with an additional error from the theoretical calculation of the decay rate , which is independent for the two decays .",
    "currently there is a small disagreement between the values of @xmath5 extracted from these distinct approaches .",
    "the main difficulty with the inclusive determination of @xmath5 is the fact that the decay @xmath44 has a branching ratio about fifty times larger than that of @xmath42 ( because @xmath45 ) . in order to reduce this background and isolate the signal from @xmath42 ,",
    "kinematical cuts are applied .",
    "one approach is to select charged leptons @xmath46 with greatest energy ( the `` endpoint region '' ) . for an energy @xmath47 gev",
    "the background from @xmath44 is very small , but the theoretical prediction for the decay rate of @xmath42 in this endpoint region has sizeable errors , which are summarized in @xcite . the most significant error is from the non - perturbative `` shape function''@xcite .",
    "fortunately , the leading shape function is universal in @xmath40 decays .",
    "therefore the dependence of the decay rate of @xmath42 ( in the endpoint region ) on the leading shape function can be eliminated by using data from other @xmath7 decays ( such as @xmath48 ) .",
    "however , `` sub - leading shape functions '' break this universality of the shape function , and so the process of eliminating its effect on @xmath42 brings in additional errors .",
    "in @xcite it is suggested that this error from sub - leading shape functions might limit the ultimate precision in such measurements of @xmath5 to around @xmath49 .",
    "alternatively , the dependence of the decay rate of @xmath42 on the shape function can be reduced by applying a less energetic cut on @xmath46 ( e.g. @xmath50 gev ) , but the background from @xmath44 then becomes much larger .",
    "there are several measurements of @xmath5 from the inclusive method , and different kinematical cuts are applied . in order to reduce the background from @xmath44 , most measurements select only a small fraction ( partial rate ) of the total inclusive rate of @xmath42 . the value of @xmath5 is then extracted in the context of several theoretical prescriptions , which treat the various theoretical errors ( including the dependence on the shape function ) in distinct ways .    a recent measurement by the belle collaboration @xcite applies a much lower cut on the energy of @xmath51@xmath52 gev ) , which keeps @xmath53 of the total inclusive rate of @xmath42",
    ". such an approach substantially reduces the theoretical error ( especially that from the shape function ) in the extraction of @xmath5 , and it is suggested in @xcite that this method is the most promising one for a precise measurement of @xmath5 from inclusive @xmath42 at a high - luminosity @xmath7 factory .",
    "the current measurement of @xmath5 from inclusive decays uses eight independent measurements of @xmath42 , and is an average over the results of the four theoretical prescriptions @xcite : @xmath54 in eq.([vub - inclusive ] ) the theoretical error and experimental error have been combined , and the experimental error ( @xmath55 ) is smaller than the theoretical error .",
    "the decays @xmath16 and @xmath43 have both been measured , but the former is much more favourable for extracting @xmath5 , both experimentally and theoretically .",
    "there are two search strategies for @xmath16 .",
    "one technique tags the other @xmath40 in the event , while the other technique does not .",
    "currently these techniques have comparable precisions , but it is suggested that the tagged method ( e.g. as used by belle in @xcite ) will afford the greatest precision at a high - luminosity @xmath7 factory .",
    "extracting the value of @xmath5 requires theoretical input distinct from that used in the inclusive approach .",
    "the decay @xmath16 only depends on one hadronic form factor @xmath56 ( where @xmath57 is the momentum of @xmath46 ) which can be calculated in lqcd for @xmath58 gev@xmath59 and by soft collinear effective theory ( scet ) for @xmath60 gev@xmath59 .",
    "the world average measurement of @xmath5 from exclusive decays is @xcite : @xmath61 a recent babar measurement alone @xcite gives @xmath62 .",
    "therefore both the inclusive and exclusive measurements of @xmath5 have comparable experimental and theoretical errors , but there is a disagreement of the central values . however , the average of the inclusive and exclusive measurements is @xmath63 @xcite , which agrees quite well with the values of @xmath5 extracted from two independent global sm fits , the latter being @xmath64 @xcite and @xmath65 @xcite .",
    "although the experimental prospects for both the inclusive and exclusive approaches to measure @xmath5 are good , the question of the magnitude of the theoretical error will remain .",
    "a complementary technique for which the theoretical error is known to be small is particularly attractive . in this regard",
    ", the use of double ratios of leptonic decays to measure @xmath5 was proposed in @xcite .",
    "one such double ratio is defined by : @xmath67    the quantity @xmath66 deviates from unity by small corrections of the form @xmath68 and @xmath69 , and importantly such a double ratio does not have a dependence on the absolute values of the decay constants .",
    "a calculation in @xcite gives @xmath70 , and subsequent works @xcite also give values very close to 1 , with a very small error . in our numerical analysis",
    "we will take @xmath71 .",
    "therefore eq .",
    "( [ doub - rat ] ) can be used to measure @xmath5 with essentially no dependence on non - perturbative techniques such as lqcd .",
    "this amounts to using the decay @xmath17 to measure @xmath5 , with the dependence on @xmath21 ( i.e. the dependence on non - perturbative techniques ) being removed by forming the double ratio of decay constants . in eq .",
    "( [ doub - rat ] ) , the product of ckm elements @xmath72 is known with high precision if one assumes that the ckm matrix is unitary .",
    "the left - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ doub - rat ] ) is taken from experiment , and thus a measurement of @xmath5 can be extracted when all four decays have been measured .",
    "the drawback of this approach is that accurate measurements of all four decays are required . at the time of writing of @xcite",
    "only one decay had been measured . at present , three of the decays in eq .",
    "( [ doub - rat ] ) have been measured , while an upper limit exists for @xmath1 .",
    "evidently , the double ratio can not yet provide a measurement of @xmath5 because one of the decays has not been measured .",
    "however , the experimental prospects for reasonably precise measurements of all four decays are quite good , and eventually a measurement of @xmath5 using eq .",
    "( [ doub - rat ] ) will be possible .",
    "other double ratios can be defined , such as replacing @xmath73 in eq .",
    "( [ doub - rat ] ) by @xmath29 , both of these decays having comparable experimental precision at present ( and similar precision is expected for both decays at the bes - iii experiment @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , the decay @xmath25 is expected to be observed at a high - luminosity @xmath7 factory , which would provide an independent measurement of @xmath20 , and enable a measurement of a double ratio in which @xmath17 is replaced by @xmath25 .",
    "we note that a sm - like rate for the decay @xmath74 will be measured at the bes - iii experiment , but its precision will always be inferior to that for @xmath75 @xcite , and so it is preferable to use this latter decay in the definition of double ratios .    in the context of models beyond the sm ,",
    "the double ratio is sensitive to new physics particles . assuming that the partial widths for each decay are multiplied by scale factors , the right - hand side of the double ratio in eq .",
    "( [ doub - rat ] ) is modified by a ratio of scale factors : @xmath76 in the next section we will give the explicit form of each of the scale factors appearing in @xmath77 , in the context of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) .",
    "in following subsections we present the theoretical expressions for the decay rates of the leptonic decays in the double ratio , and discuss the experimental prospects for their measurements .",
    "the current upper bound on the double ratio is derived by combining statistically the existing measurements of the individual decays .",
    "finally , the attainable experimental precision for @xmath5 from a measurement of the double ratio at the next generation of experiments is estimated .      in the sm this decay",
    "is mediated by @xmath78 and is helicity suppressed , whereas there is no such suppression for the scalar @xmath34 exchange , whose contribution is proportional to the @xmath79 quark and @xmath80 lepton yukawa couplings . in the limit of high @xmath39",
    "such yukawa couplings are enhanced , and the contribution from @xmath34 can be comparable in magnitude to that of @xmath78 @xcite .",

    "the two measurements by babar @xcite have used a large amount ( @xmath96 ) of the available data taken at @xmath97 .",
    "the two measurements by belle @xcite are with 414 fb@xmath98 and 605 fb@xmath98 , and so these could be significantly updated with the total integrated luminosity of 1000 fb@xmath98 . a high - luminosity @xmath7 factory with around 50 ab@xmath98 could measure @xmath17 to a precision of around @xmath99 ( e.g. see @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , with 50 ab@xmath98 the decay @xmath25 ( for which there is currently an upper limit ) could be measured with about the same precision as @xmath17 .",
    "hence a precision of around @xmath30 for @xmath20 could achieved from each decay at a high - luminosity @xmath7 factory . a combination of the measurements of @xmath20 from @xmath17 and @xmath25 would ( presumably ) further reduce the uncertainty .      in analogy to the case for @xmath17 , singly charged higgs bosons",

    "note that the magnitude of the @xmath34 contribution depends on the ratio of quark masses @xmath116 , and an analogous uncertainty is not present for the @xmath34 contribution to the decay @xmath117 .",

    "this additional freedom implies in particular that the charged higgs mass can be considered as a free parameter .    to investigate the parameter spaces of the cmssm and nuhm we generate 300,000 random points scanning over the ranges @xmath175 $ ] gev , @xmath176 $ ] gev , @xmath177 $ ] gev , @xmath178 $ ] with positive @xmath173 in cmssm and @xmath179 $ ] gev and @xmath180 $ ] gev in nuhm . for each point",
