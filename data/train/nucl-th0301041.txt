    "an alternate title could be `` surprises in the proton '' .",
    "this talk owes its existence to the precise , stunning and exciting recent experimental work on measuring @xmath0 ( or @xmath1 ) for the proton and @xmath3 for the neutron .",
    "my goal here is to interpret the data .",
    "symmetries including poincar invariance and chiral symmetry will be the principal tool i ll use .",
    "this talk is based on three papers @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .    if , a few years ago , one had asked participants at a meeting like this about the @xmath4 dependence of the proton s @xmath0 or @xmath1 .",
    "almost everyone one have answered that for large enough values of @xmath4 , @xmath0 would be flat and @xmath1 would fall with increasing @xmath4 .",
    "the reason for the latter fall being conservation of hadron helicity .",
    "indeed , the shapes of the curves have been obtained in the new measurements , except for the mis - labeling of the ordinate axes .",
    "the expected flatness of @xmath0 holds for @xmath1 , and the quantity @xmath0 falls rapidly and linearly with @xmath4 .",
    "this behavior needs to be understood !",
    "i will begin with a brief introduction to light front physics .",
    "then i will discuss a particular relativistic model of the nucleon , and proceed to apply it to the proton form factors , with the aim of providing a qualitative understanding of the salient experimental features .",
    "the same model fails to reproduce the neutron @xmath5 unless the effects of the pion cloud are included . the combination of relativistic effects with those of the pion cloud lead to a model that is able to reproduce all of the nucleon electromagnetic form factors .",
    "light - front dynamics is a relativistic many - body dynamics in which fields are quantized at a `` time''=@xmath6 .",
    "the @xmath7-development operator is then given by @xmath8 .",
    "these equations show the notation that a four - vector @xmath9 is expressed as @xmath10 one quantizes at @xmath11 which is a light - front , hence the name `` light front dynamics ''",
    ". the canonical spatial variable must be orthogonal to the time variable , and this is given by @xmath12 .",
    "the canonical momentum is then @xmath13 .",
    "the other coordinates are @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "the most important consequence of this is that the relation between energy and momentum of a free particle is given by : @xmath16 a relativistic kinetic energy which does not contain a square root operator .",
    "this allows the separation of center of mass and relative coordinates , so that the computed wave functions are frame independent .",
    "the use of the light front is particularly relevant for calculating form factors , which are probability amplitudes for an nucleon to absorb a four momentum @xmath17 and remain a nucleon .",
    "the initial and final nucleons have different total momenta .",
    "this means that the final nucleon is a boosted nucleon , with different wave function than the initial nucleon . in general , performing the boost is difficult for large values of @xmath18 .",
    "however the light front technique allows one to set up the calculation so that the boosts are independent of interactions .",
    "indeed , the wave functions are functions of relative variables and are independent of frame .",
    "let us define the basic quantities concerning us here .",
    "these are the independent form factors defined by @xmath19 u_\\lambda ( p ) . \\ee",
    "the   sachs form factors are defined by the equations : \\bea g_e = f_1 - { q^2 \\over 4m_n^2}\\kappa f_2,\\ ;   g_m = f_1 +   \\kappa f_2\\label{sachsdefs}.\\eea    there is an alternate     light front interpretation , based on field theory , in which one uses the   `` good \" component   of the current , $ j^+,$ to    suppress   the effects of quark - pair terms .",
    "then , using nucleon light - cone   spinors :   \\begin{eqnarray } f_1(q^2 ) = { 1 \\over 2p^+}\\langle n,\\uparrow\\left| j^+\\right| n , \\uparrow\\rangle , \\quad q\\kappa   f_2(q^2 ) = { -2m_n \\over 2p^+}\\langle n,\\uparrow\\left| j^+\\right| n,\\downarrow\\rangle . \\end{eqnarray } the form factor $ f_1 $ is obtained from the non - spin flip matrix element , while $ f_2 $ is obtained from the spin - flip term .",
    "\\section { three - body variables and boost } we use   light front coordinates for the momentum   of each of the $ i$ quarks , such that $ { \\bf p}_i = ( p^+_i,{\\bf p}_{i\\perp } ) , p^-=(p_\\perp^2+m^2)/p^+.$ the   total ( perp)-momentum is   $ \\bf { p}= { \\bf p}_1+{\\bf p}_2 + { \\bf p}_3,$ the plus components of the momenta are denoted as   \\be \\xi={p_1^+\\over p_1^++p_2^+}\\ ; , \\qquad \\eta={p_1^++p_2^+\\over p^+},\\ee and the perpendicular relative coordinates are given by \\be { \\bf k}_\\perp = ( 1-\\xi){\\bf p}_{1\\perp}-\\xi { \\bf p}_{2\\perp}\\ ; , \\quad { \\bf k}_\\perp = ( 1-\\eta)({\\bf p}_{1\\perp } + { \\bf p}_{2\\perp})-\\eta { \\bf p}_{3\\perp}.\\ee in   the   center of mass   frame we find : \\be { \\bf p}_{1\\perp}={\\bf k}_\\perp+\\xi { \\bf k}_\\perp,\\;\\;\\quad { \\bf p}_{2\\perp}=-{\\bf",
    "k}_\\perp+(1-\\xi){\\bf k}_\\perp\\;,\\quad   { \\bf p}_{3\\perp}=-{\\bf k}_\\perp .\\ee the coordinates $ \\xi,\\eta , \\bfk,\\bfk$ are all relative coordinates so that one obtains a    frame independent wave function     $ \\psi({\\bf k}_\\perp,{\\bf k}_\\perp,\\xi,\\eta).$        now consider the computation of a form factor , taking quark 3 to be the one struck by the photon .",
    "one works in a special set of frames with $ q^+=0 $ and $ q^2=\\bfq_\\perp^2 $ , so that the value of $ 1-\\eta$ is not changed by the photon .",
    "the coordinate $ \\bfp_{3\\perp}$ is changed to $ \\bfp_{3\\perp}+\\bfq_\\perp,$ so   only one relative momentum , $ \\bfk_\\perp$ is changed : \\bea{\\bfk'}_\\perp = ( 1-\\eta)({\\bf p}_{1\\perp } + { \\bf p}_{2\\perp})-\\eta ( { \\bf p}_{3\\perp}+{\\bf q}_\\perp)\\ ; = \\bfk_\\perp-\\eta\\bfq_{\\perp},\\quad \\bfk'_\\perp=\\bfk_\\perp,\\qquad   \\eea    the arguments of the spatial wave function are taken as the mass - squared operator for a non - interacting system : \\be m_0 ^ 2\\equiv\\sum_{i=1,3 } p^-_i\\;p^+-p_\\perp^2= { k_\\perp^2\\over \\eta(1-\\eta)}+ { k_\\perp^2+m^2\\over \\eta\\xi(1-\\xi ) } + { m^2\\over 1-\\eta}. \\ee this   is a relativistic version of the   square of   the center - of - mass   kinetic energy , expressed in terms of light - front variables .   note that       the absorption of a photon   changes the   value to : \\be{{m_0}'}^2= { ( k_\\perp-\\eta q_\\perp)^2\\over \\eta(1-\\eta)}+ { k_\\perp^2+m^2\\over \\eta\\xi(1-\\xi ) } + { m^2\\over 1-\\eta}.\\ee    \\section { wave function } our wave function is based on symmetries . the wave function is anti - symmetric , a function of relative momenta , independent of reference frame , an eigenstate of the spin operator and rotationally invariant ( in a specific well - defined sense ) .",
    "the use of symmetries is manifested in the construction of such   wave functions , as originally described by   terent'ev \\cite{bere76 } ,                coester\\cite{chun91 } and their   collaborators .",
    "a schematic   form of the wave function is   \\be \\psi(p_i)=\\phi(m_0 ^ 2 ) u(p_1 ) u(p_2 ) u(p_3)\\psi(p_1,p_2,p_3),\\quad p_i=\\bfp_i   s_i,\\tau_i\\ee where $ \\psi$ is a spin - isospin color amplitude factor , the $ p_i$ are expressed in terms of relative coordinates ( for example , $ { \\bf p}_{3\\perp}=-{\\bf k}_\\perp$ ) ,   the $ u(p_i)$ are ordinary     dirac spinors and $ \\phi$ is a spatial wave function .",
    "the ordinary dirac spinors depend on the third or $ z$ component of the momenta and this is given , for example , by $ p_{3z}= { 1\\over2}[m_0(1-\\eta)-{m^2+k_\\perp^2\\over(1-\\eta)m_0}]$.     we take the the spatial wave function from   schlumpf\\cite{schlumpf : ce } : \\bea \\phi(m_0)={n\\over ( m^2_0+\\beta^2)^{\\gamma}}\\ ; ,    \\beta = 0.607\\;{\\rm gev } , \\ ; \\gamma=3.5,\\ ; m = 0.267\\ ; { \\rm gev}. \\label{params}\\eea   the value of   $ \\gamma$ is chosen that $ q^4g_m(q^2 ) $    is approximately   constant for $ q^2>4\\ ; { \\rm gev}^2 $ in accord with experimental data .",
    "the parameter   $ \\beta$ helps govern the values of the perp - momenta allowed by the wave function $ \\phi$ and is closely related to the   rms charge radius , and $ m$ is mainly determined by the magnetic moment of the proton .    at this point",
    "the wave function and the calculation   are   completely defined .",
    "one could evaluate the form factors as $ \\langle \\psi\\vert j^+\\vert \\psi\\rangle$ and obtain the results .",
    "actually the first results were obtained in 1995\\cite{frank:1995pv } , and are given as figs.~10,11 in that reference .",
    "it is clear that the model predicted that $ g_e$ falls off much more rapidly with increasing $ q^2 $ than does $ g_m$.   the result that $ q^4g_m$ is flat at high $ q^2 $ is a   consequence of using schlumpf 's wave function ,   but our values of $ g_e$ for large $ q^2 $ were a prediction .",
    "so we had this   early prediction , which was   confirmed by experimental measurements .",
    "but we did n't present an explanation of the numerical results .",
    "this is the next task .",
    "\\section { simplify   calculation- light cone spinors }    the evaluation   of the operator $ j^+\\sim \\gamma^+$   is simplified by using light cone spinors .",
    "these       solutions of the free dirac equation , related to ordinary dirac spinors by a unitary transformation ,    conveniently satisfy : \\bea \\bar u_l(p^+,\\bfp',\\lambda')\\gamma^+u_l(p^+,\\bfp , \\lambda)= 2\\delta_{\\lambda\\lambda'}p^+ .",
    "\\eea   to take advantage of this , re - express the wave function in terms of light - front spinors using the   completeness relation :   $ 1= \\sum_\\lambda u_l(p,\\lambda)\\bar u_l(p,\\lambda).$ we then find    \\bea & & \\psi(p_i)=u_l(p_1,\\lambda_1 ) u_l(p_2,\\lambda_2 ) u_l(p_3,\\lambda_3 ) \\psi_l(p_i,\\lambda_i),\\\\ & & \\psi_l(p_i,\\lambda_i)\\equiv [ \\bar u_l(\\bfp_1,\\lambda_1)u(\\bfp_1 , s_1 ) ] [ \\bar u_l(\\bfp_2,\\lambda_2)u(\\bfp_2 , s_2)]\\nonumber\\\\ \\times & & [ \\bar u_l(\\bfp_3,\\lambda_3)u(\\bfp_3 , s_3)]\\ ; \\psi(p_1,p_2,p_3).\\eea this is the   very same   $ \\psi$ as before , it is just that now it is easy   to compute the matrix elements of the $ \\gamma^+$ operator .",
    "the   unitary transformation is   also known as the melosh rotation .",
    "the basic point is that one may evaluate the coefficients in terms of pauli spinors : $ \\vert \\lambda_i\\rangle,\\vert s_i\\rangle,$ with $ \\langle \\lambda_i\\vert { r}_m^\\dagger(\\bfp_i)\\vert s_i\\rangle \\equiv \\bar u_l(\\bfp_i,\\lambda_i)u(\\bfp_i , s_i)$. it is easy to show that    \\be \\langle \\lambda_3\\vert   { r}_m^\\dagger(\\bfp_3)\\vert s _",
    "3\\rangle= \\langle \\lambda_3\\vert \\left [ { m+(1-\\eta)m_0+i{{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ \\sigma$}}}\\cdot({\\bf n}\\times { \\bf p}_3)\\over \\sqrt{(m+(1-\\eta)m_0)^2+p_{3\\perp}^2}}\\right]\\vert s_3\\rangle . \\label{melosh}\\ee \\ ] ] the important effect resides in the term @xmath20 which originates from the lower components of the dirac spinors .",
    "this large relativistic spin effect can be summarized : the effects of relativity are to replace pauli spinors by melosh rotation operators acting on pauli spinors . thus _",
    "i_m^(_i ) , _ 3.in the non - relativistic limit , the melosh rotation matrices become unit operators and one recovers the familiar @xmath21 quark model .",
    "the analytic insight is based on eq .",
    "( [ melosh ] ) . consider high momentum transfer such that @xmath23 mev . _",
    "each _ of the quantities : @xmath24 can be of order @xmath25 so the spin - flip term is as large as the non - spin flip term . in particular , ( @xmath26 ) may correspond to ( @xmath27 , so the spin of the struck quark @xmath28 proton spin .",
    "this means that there is no hadron helicity selection rule@xcite .",
    "the effects of the lower components of dirac spinors , which cause the spin flip term @xmath29 , are the same as having a non - zero @xmath30 , if the wave functions are expressed in the light - front basis .",
    "we may now qualitatively understand the numerical results , since @xmath31 where the @xmath32 represents common factors .",
    "the term @xmath33 is a spin - non - flip term and @xmath34 depends on the spin - flip term . in doing the integral each of the momenta , and",
    "@xmath35 can take the large value @xmath36 for some regions of the integration .",
    "thus in the integral _ 3_3~qq,_3_3~qq , so that @xmath37 and @xmath38 have the same @xmath4 dependence .",
    "this is shown in fig .  1 .",
    "indeed , for @xmath4 greater than about 2 gev@xmath39 , the ratio @xmath40 varies very little with increasing @xmath4 .",
    "( 10,8)(0,-8 . )",
    "the neutron has no charge , @xmath41 , and the square of its charge radius is determined from the low @xmath4 limit as @xmath42 the quantity @xmath43 is well - measured@xcite as @xmath44fm@xmath39 .",
    "the galster parameterization@xcite has been used to represent the data for @xmath46 .",
    "our proton respects charge symmetry , the interchange of @xmath47 and @xmath48 quarks , so it contains a prediction for neutron form factors .",
    "this is shown in fig .  2 .    ( 10,8)(0,-8 )    [ fig:2 ]",
    "the resulting curve labeled relativistic quarks is both large and small .",
    "it is very small at low values of @xmath4 .",
    "its slope at @xmath49 is too small by a factor of five , if one compares with the straight line .",
    "but at larger values of @xmath4 the prediction is relatively large .",
    "our model gives @xmath50 fm@xmath39 , about five times smaller than the data .",
    "the small value can be understood in terms of @xmath51 .",
    "taking the definition ( [ sachsdefs ] ) for small values of @xmath4 gives -q^2r^2/6=-q^2r_1 ^ 2/6 -_n q^2/4m^2=-q^2r_1 ^ 2/6 -q^2r_f^2/6,where the foldy contribution , @xmath52 , is in good agreement with the experimental data . that a point particle with a magnetic moment can explain the charge radius has led some to state that @xmath5 is not a measure of the structure of the neutron",
    "however , one must include the @xmath4 dependence of @xmath37 which gives @xmath53 . in our model",
    "@xmath54 which nearly cancels the effects of @xmath55 .",
    "isgur@xcite showed that this cancellation is a natural consequence of including the relativistic effects of the lower components of the dirac spinors .",
    "thus our relativistic effects are standard .",
    "we need another source of @xmath43 .",
    "this is the pion cloud .",
    "the effects of chiral symmetry require that sometimes a physical nucleon can be a bare nucleon immersed in a pion cloud .",
    "an incident photon can interact electromagnetically with a bar nucleon , a pion in flight or with a nucleon while a pion is present .",
    "these effects were included in the cloudy bag model@xcite , and are especially pronounced for the neutron . sometimes the neutron can be a proton plus a negatively charged pion .",
    "the tail of the pion distribution extends far out into space ( see figs . 10 and 11 ) of ref.@xcite , so that the square of the charge radius is negative .",
    "it is necessary to modernize the cloudy bag model , so as to make it relativistic .",
    "this involves using photon - nucleon form factors from our model , using a relativistic @xmath56-nucleon form factor , and treating the pionic contributions relativistically by doing a light front calculation .",
    "we define the resulting model as the light - front cloudy bag model lfcbm .    the calculation is implemented by evaluating the relevant feynman diagrams of fig .",
    "[ fig : diagrams ] by integrating over @xmath57 analytically ( @xmath58 is the momentum of the emitted virtual pion ) and the other three components numerically ; see ref .  @xcite .",
    "thus the feynman graphs , fig .",
    "[ fig : diagrams ] , are represented by a single @xmath7-ordered diagram .",
    "the use of @xmath59 and the yan identity@xcite @xmath60 allows one see that the nucleon current operators appearing in fig.[fig : diagrams]b act between on - mass - shell spinors .",
    ".9 cm    ( 5,5)(0.9,7.0 )    there are four model parameters:@xmath61 , with @xmath62 representing the cut - off in the pion - nucleon form factor .",
    "including the effects of the pion cloud gives contributions to the magnetic moments of the proton and neutron , so it is necessary to re - fit the parameters .",
    "a sample of the values of the parameters is given in table  1 .",
    ".different parameter sets , units in terms of @xmath63 [ cols=\"<,>,>,>,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     the result is termed the light front cloudy bag model@xcite ( even though there is no bag ) , and results are shown in fig .  4 .",
    "we see that the pion cloud effects are important for small values of @xmath4 and , when combined with those of the relativistic quarks coming from the bare nucleon , leads to a good description of the low @xmath4 data .",
    "the total value of @xmath5 is substantial for large values of @xmath4 .",
    "( 10,8)(0,-8.5 )    [ fig : ratio ]    one might ask how the effects of the pion cloud influence the results shown in fig .",
    "1 . they do not change the picture very much .",
    "the pion cloud effects influence the low momentum transfer properties , but vanish at large momentum transfer .",
    "1 shows @xmath1 which vanishes at @xmath64 , so the influence of pion cloud effects is hidden .",
    "we have shown one ratio and one form factor .",
    "but there are four nucleon electromagnetic form factors .",
    "the remaining two are shown in figs .  5 and 6 .",
    "( 10,8)(-1.0,2.5 )    [ fig : gmp ]    ( 10,8)(1.0,-9.5 )    [ fig : gmn ]    speaking in a general fashion , i can say that good descriptions of @xmath65 are obtained .",
    "if one looks closely there are disagreements with the data .",
    "one sees , at very large values of @xmath4 , that our value of @xmath66 is too small , and this allows room for the effects of perturbative qcd @xcite . that have been neglected .",
    "the wiggles at low values of @xmath4 are also worthy of comment .",
    "these arise because the effects of the pion field fall off faster with increasing @xmath4 than the dipole form used for comparison .",
    "our result for @xmath67 shows too deep a dip at low @xmath4 in comparison with recent data@xcite .    the axial form factor",
    ", @xmath68 is not calculated here .",
    "schlumpf s model obtained an excellent reproduction of existing data@xcite , and our parameters are similar to his .",
    "the lowest - order effect of the pion cloud vanishes , so the principal difference between @xmath69 of our model and that of ref .",
    "@xcite is that our quark masses have larger values .",
    "this increases the computed value of @xmath70 for a bare nucleon by about @xmath71 .",
    "but this is opposed by the need to multiply the bare nucleon result by the renormalization factor @xmath72 of about @xmath73 .",
    "thus our results for @xmath68 should be similar to those of @xcite .",
    "these calculations show that the combination of invariance and pion cloud effects , is sufficient to describe the existing experimental data up to about @xmath74 .",
    "this is somewhat surprising as the model keeps only two necessary effects .",
    "configuration mixing of quark@xcite , the variation of the quark mass with @xmath4@xcite , exchange currents@xcite and an intermediate @xmath75@xcite have not been included .",
    "these effects either have modest influence , are incorporated implicitly through the choice of parameters , or will help to remove any remaining differences with experiment .",
