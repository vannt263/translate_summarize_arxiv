    "in the classical quark models , each baryon is made of three constituent quarks  @xcite .",
    "the pattern of the spectra and the static properties of the ground and low - lying excited states of baryons can be described reasonably well within these models . however , there are large deviations between the predictions from these models and the experimental data  @xcite , such as the strong coupling of @xmath1 to the strangeness , and the mass order between @xmath1 and @xmath2 . in the classical 3-quark models ,",
    "the @xmath1 with @xmath3-quarks is expected to be lighter than @xmath2 with @xmath4-quarks .",
    "this problem may be solved by the penta - quark picture for these excited baryons . in the penta - quark models , the @xmath1 with @xmath5[ds]\\bar{s}$ ]",
    "is naturally heavier than the @xmath2 with @xmath6[sq]\\bar{q}$ ]  @xcite .",
    "actually , the conventional orbital excitation energy of a original constituent quark in a baryon is already comparable to drag out a @xmath7 pair from the gluon field . as a result",
    ", some excited baryons are proposed to be meson - baryon dynamically generated states  @xcite or states with large ( @xmath8 ) components  @xcite .",
    "but because of the same resonances predicted by different models are in the similar energy region , there are always some adjustable ingredients in each model to fit the experimental data .",
    "thus it is difficult to pin down the nature of these baryon resonances .",
    "one way to avoid such difficulty is to replace light flavor @xmath7 in these baryons by @xmath9 .",
    "brodsky @xmath10",
    "@xcite proposed in the early 1980s that there are about @xmath11 @xmath12 components in the proton .",
    "recently , refs.@xcite have used different methods to predict some narrow hidden charm @xmath13 and @xmath14 resonances with masses above 4 gev and widths smaller than 100 mev .",
    "these resonances , if observed , absolutely can not be ascribed to the conventional 3-quark states . therefore , it is important to investigate the extent to which the predicted @xmath13 and @xmath14 resonances can be further firmly established .    in this work we focus on the predictions  @xcite from a beijing - valencia collaboration .",
    "their results are from solving the following algebraic coupled - channel equations @xmath15 where @xmath16 , and @xmath17 is the square of the c.m . energy . in eq.([eq : vi - eq ] ) the meson - baryon potential is based on the vector meson - exchange mechanisms of ref.@xcite and is written in the following separable form @xmath18 where the @xmath19 is the on - shell energy of the @xmath20 channel s meson , and @xmath21 is the mass of exchange vector . the factorized propagator @xmath22 is calculated from either using the dimensional regularization or introducing a cutoff parameter @xmath23 @xmath24\\big\\}\\    \\label{eq : vi - g1 } \\\\",

    "it was found that the solutions of the above equations yield few narrow resonances above 4.0 gev .    as discussed in ref.@xcite , eqs.([eq : vi - eq])-([eq : vi - g2 ] ) are derived from making approximations on the bethe - salpeter ( bs ) equation .",
    "schematically , the bs equation is ( omitting the channel indices ) @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the total four momentum of the system , @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the relative momenta . for the considered vector meson - exchange ,",
    "the interaction kernel is @xmath33 where @xmath34 is a coupling constant . the complications in solving eq.([eq : bs - eq ] )",
    "is well known , as discussed in , for example , ref.@xcite for @xmath35 scattering . thus approximations , such as those used  @xcite in obtaining eqs.([eq : vi - eq])-([eq : vi - g2 ] ) , are needed for practical calculations .",
    "there exist other approximations to solve bs equations and alternative approaches to derive practical hadron reaction models from relativistic quantum field theory .",
    "it is thus necessary to investigate the extent to which the results from ref.@xcite depend on the approximations employed .",
    "this is the objective of this work .",
    "we will consider several coupled - channel models derived from using a unitary transformation method  @xcite and the three - dimensional reductions  @xcite of bethe - salpeter equation .",
    "these formulations have been used in studying @xmath35 scattering  @xcite , @xmath36 scattering  @xcite , and coupled - channel @xmath35 and @xmath37 reactions in the nucleon resonance region  @xcite .    in section",
    "ii , we present the considered coupled - channel formulations and discuss their differences with eqs.([eq : vi - eq])-([eq : vi - g2 ] ) . the numerical procedures for solving the considered coupled - channel equations are described in section iii .",
    "we then investigate in section iv , the numerical consequences of the differences between different coupled - channel models in predicting the resonance positions and the reaction cross sections .",
    "a summary is given in section v.",
    "following ref.@xcite , we assume that the interactions between the considered meson - baryon ( @xmath26 ) channels are due to the vector meson - exchange mechanism and can be calculated from the following interaction lagrangian @xmath38 with @xmath39\\rangle\\nonumber\\\\ { \\cal l}_{ppv}&=&-ig\\langle v^\\mu[p,\\partial_\\mu p]\\rangle\\nonumber\\\\ { \\cal l}_{bbv}&=&g ( \\langle\\bar{b}\\gamma_\\mu [ v^\\mu , b]\\rangle+\\langle\\bar{b}\\gamma_\\mu b\\rangle\\langle v^\\mu\\rangle)\\ \\label{eq : lag-1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 and @xmath40 stand for the pseudoscalar and vector mesons of the 16-plet of su(4 ) , respectively , and @xmath41 stands for the baryon .",

    "the solid line is for the full potential , corresponding to a in table  [ osettab ] ; the dashed line is for the neglect of spin of baryons , corresponding to @xmath66 in table  [ osettab ] ; the dot - dashed line is for the neglect of both spin of baryons and momentum of exchange vector , corresponding to @xmath67 in table  [ osettab ] . ]    besides ref.@xcite , there are two later publications  @xcite also predicting the existence of @xmath68 around 4.3 gev with hidden charm .    in ref.@xcite , the s - wave @xmath69 and @xmath70 states with isospin i=1/2 and spin s=1/2 are dynamically investigated within the framework of a chiral constituent quark model by solving a resonating group method ( rgm ) equation .",
    "the calculation not only includes vector mesons ( @xmath71 and @xmath72 ) exchange , but also scalar(@xmath73 ) meson exchange , which provides an additional attractive force .",
    "therefore , the binding energy in ref.@xcite is larger than that in this work .",

    "the heavy mass of particles with the @xmath81 or @xmath82 components would make the attractive potential stronger than the case with only light flavors .",
    "the widths of these resonances are very narrow in our models , because they need heavy vector meson @xmath83 exchange to decay to open channels .",
