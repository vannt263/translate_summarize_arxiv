    "the independent - particle approximation and the associated one - electron orbital picture forms the basis of our understanding of chemical bonding and electronic energy levels in solids and molecules .",
    "the most widely used approximations of this type are hartree - fock ( hf ) and density functional theory ( dft)@xcite . although the single - particle orbitals derived from such schemes do not have physical meaning ,",
    "apart from the fact that the exact dft orbitals generate the exact groundstate density , they are routinely used to calculate and interpret physical quantities of various types .",
    "in strongly correlated systems such an approach clearly breaks down .",
    "however , even in weakly correlated systems where the single - particle picture is valid , there is no guarantee that the orbitals generated by the standard one - electron schemes are those which best resembles the true many - body excitations .",
    "quasiparticle ( qp ) wave functions provide a rigorous generalization of the concept of single - particle orbitals to interacting electron systems .",

    "the qp energies represent the possible energies of a particle ( electron or hole ) added to the @xmath4-particle groundstate , and the qp wave function describes the probability amplitude for finding the added particle at a given position .",
    "( a precise definition and interpretation of the qp energies and wave functions will be given later in this paper . )",
    "the gw approximation@xcite to @xmath3 ( both in its self - consistent and non self - consistent form ) has been succesfully used to calculate qp energies of solids@xcite , molecules@xcite , and more recently solid - molecule interfaces@xcite .",
    "the latter class of systems is particularly challenging to describe due to its highly inhomogeneous nature : since the qp states describe the charged excitations , the qp energies of an adsorbed molecule are strongly affected by the metal surface through long range polarization effects ( image charge effects ) which decay as @xmath5 with @xmath6 being the distance to the surface , see fig .",
    "the inability of any available dft functional to account for this renormalization of molecular energy levels , reflects the highly non - local nature of the phenomenon .",
    "we stress that this does not imply that the single - particle picture is invalid in such cases ; only that the correct ( qp ) orbitals and energies can not be obtained from a simple mean field potential .",

    "most applications of the qp equation have focused on the qp _ energies _ while the qp wave functions have been much less studied .",
    "in fact it is very often assumed that the latter , apart from normalization , are identical to the orbitals obtained from dft ( @xmath7 . under that assumption , qp energies can be obtained from first order pertubation theory involving only the diagonal matrix elements @xmath8 thus greatly reducing the computational cost of solving the qp equation .    as an example where the shape of the qp wave functions play a key role we consider the case of electron transport through a molecule connected to metallic electrodes .",
    "the conductance of the junction depends mainly on two factors , namely ( i ) the position of the molecule s frontier ( qp ) energy levels relative to the metal fermi energy and ( ii ) the overlap between the molecule s frontier ( qp ) orbitals and the extended states in the electrodes .",
    "the importance of ( i ) has been studied in detail using scissors operator techniques to correct the dft energy levels while keeping the dft orbitals fixed@xcite .",
    "in contrast , the question of how well the dft orbitals resemble the true qp orbitals and the consequences for charge transport has only been indirectly studied@xcite .    in this paper",
    "we show , using many - body perturbation theory in the gw approximation , that the qp wave functions of a molecular wire in contact with a metal surface can be qualitatively different from those obtained from an independent - particle approximation . while the latter method yields orbitals that remain delocalized over the molecule upon coupling to the surface ,",
    "our gw calculations show that image charge effects not only causes a reduction of the qp energies as previously demonstrated , but also renormalize the molecular orbitals .",
    "orbitals with energy close to the fermi level are pulled more towards the surface while higher and lower lying orbitals are pushed away . as a result ,",

    "the hf orbitals are completely delocalized over the molecule and are essentially identical to the orbitals of the freemolecule .",
    "this is in sharp contrast to the orbitals derived from gw which are localized on different parts of the molecule .",
    "the localization of the qp wave functions occur because of the interaction between the hole on the molecule and the image charge that it induces in the metal surface .",
    "this is a highly non - local correlation effect and is completely missed by the hf approximation .",
    "it is clear that the orbitals belonging to the narrower b band become more localized than the orbitals belonging to the wider a band .",
    "this is because it is energetically cheaper to redistribute the orbitals of a narrow band .",
    "focusing on the b1-b4 states we observe a clear trend in the localization : the closer the energy of an orbital is to @xmath69 , the closer to the surface is the orbital localized . due to the image charge effect",
    "it is always energetically favorable for the hole to reside closer to the surface . on the other hand",
    ", the qp orbitals should remain ( almost ) orthogonal , at least when the qp picture applies as is the case here , and this prevents that all orbitals contract towards the surface .",
    "we recall from eq .",
    "( [ eq.qpen1 ] ) that occupied qp orbitals , @xmath70 , lying closer to @xmath69 correspond to many - body excitations , @xmath71 , with lower energy .",
    "the observed trend in the localization then follows from the variational principle applied to the may - body states @xmath71 .",
    "the unoccupied orbitals are affected by the metal surface in a similar way with orbitals lying closer to @xmath69 becoming localized more towards the surface and experiencing a larger energy shift toward @xmath69 . the fact that the sign of the image charge shift of the energy of empty and occupied orbitals is different shows that the effect can not be mimicked by a local @xmath72 potential .",
    "such a potential would shift all orbitals in the same direction ( downwards ) . to mimick the image charge potential",
    "would instead require a non - local potential of the form @xmath73 where @xmath74 and @xmath75 project onto the subspace of occupied and unoccupied molecular orbitals , respectively . from this property of the image charge potential",
    ", it is clear that the effects presented in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] can not be captured by a local potential  even the exact xc - potential of dft .    from fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we see that not only the qp peak positions but also the width of the resonances is affected by the image charge effect .",
    "this is particularly pronouned for the a1 orbital which becomes significantly broadened due to the increased weight of the orbital at the carbon atom connected to the metallic chain . for the b orbitals , which have very little weight on the contacting carbon atom , the small increase in the gw peak width relative to hf comes from the ( small ) imaginary part of the gw self - energy .",
    "( color online ) the size of the image charge effect is plotted for the orbitals a1-a4 and b1-b4 against the center of the qp orbital along the axis of the molecule , @xmath76 .",
    "the degree of localization quantified as the second moment @xmath77 , is indicated by a horizontal line for each orbital . ]",
    "the qp energies include correlations in addition to the exchange effects described at the hartree - fock level .",
    "the correlation energy contains contributions from the coulomb interactions internally on the molecule ( internal screening ) as well as the interactions between metal and molecule ( image charge screening ) . from calculations for the molecule in the gas - phase",
    "we have verified that the contribution from internal screening is almost the same ( between 0.4 and 0.6 ev ) for the different molecular orbitals .",
    "hence , apart from this constant , the difference between the qp energy and the hf energy represents the shift in the energy level due to the image charge effect .    in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we plot the image charge shift for the a and b orbitals against the center of the qp orbital along the axis of the molecule ( the @xmath78-axis ) .",
    "the center is defined as the first moment , @xmath79 .",
    "the vertical dashed line indicates the center of the molecule which coincide with the center of the hf orbitals . for each orbital , the degree of localization , quantified as the second moment @xmath80 , is indicated by a horizontal line .",
    "the vertical dashed line indictaes the center of the molecule which coincide with the center as expected there is a clear correlation between the size of the image charge shift and the orbital center , in particular for the highly localized b orbitals .",
    "the orbitals a2-a4 are all pushed slightly away from the surface .",
    "[ fig4 ] compares the image charge shifts obtained using three different strategies for calculating the gw self - energy and solving the qp equation : ( i ) full solution of the qp equation with a self - consistent gw self - energy ( ii ) full solution of the qp equation with a one - shot g@xmath81w@xmath81 self - energy with @xmath82 from hartree - fock , and ( iii ) first - order perturbation theory applied to the g@xmath81w@xmath81 self - energy , i.e. @xmath83 . as expected , the first - order approximation ( iii ) does not perform well in cases where the qp orbitals deviate significantly from the hf orbitals , i.e. for b1-b4 and a1 .",
    "in particular , for the b1-b4 orbitals the first - order approach predicts similar image charge shifts whereas the shifts obtained with methods ( i ) and ( ii ) vary due to the variation in the distance of the qp orbitals to the surface . as a general trend , the self - consistent treatment of the gw self - energy leads to larger image charge shifts ( smaller homo - lumo gaps ) in agreement with findings for isolated molecules@xcite .",

    "the reason is that the effective potential defining the mean field hamiltonian does not `` know '' how an additional particle on the molecule becomes screened by the metal . under",
    "some limiting conditions , however , the effect of image charge interaction can be simulated using mean field methods to compute the total energy with an extra particle explicitly present on the molecule@xcite .",
    "we have discussed the general mathematical and physical meaning of quasiparticle ( qp ) wave functions in inhomogeneous systems . for the specific case of a molecule adsorbed on a metal surface",

    "in contrast , the hartree - fock single - particle orbitals remain delocalized and identical to those of the isolated molecule .",
