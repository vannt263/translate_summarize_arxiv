    "a monolayer of graphite , commonly known as graphene , the first truly two - dimensional crystal ( one - atom - thick ) , which became experimentally available in the last years.@xcite today , graphene is at the focus of many research activities worldwide .",
    "remarkable electronic properties of graphene make this material a promising candidate for a large variety of electronic applications.@xcite    there have been a number of publications focused on theoretical investigation of covalent- , ionic- and metal - bonded impurities on graphene ( for example , see refs . ) .",
    "these studies are primarily based on the density functional theory ( dft ) combined with standard functionals for electronic exchange - correlation effects , such as local density approximation ( lda ) and generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) .",
    "the employment of ( semi-)local approximations looks quite reasonable so far as the systems with either covalent or metallic bonding are concerned .",
    "however , in the case of weakly bounded systems , such as molecules or molecular compounds , dispersion forces play a significant role .",
    "such interactions are essentially nonlocal and therefore can not be properly taken into account using local or semi - local density functionals .    in this work , we will focus on molecular impurities on graphene .",
    "in particular , we consider diatomic halogen molecules on an ideal graphene lattice .",
    "the motivation for this choice is the following .",
    "first , these molecules themselves are covalently bonded and represent an example of realistic weakly reactive adsorbates .",
    "second , because of the relative chemical inertness of the molecules , the interaction between these molecules and the graphene sheet is rather weak and can not be properly described within the electronic structure methods widely used nowadays in condensed matter physics ( such as conventional lda or gga approximations in the density functional theories ) .",
    "accurate calculations of the adsorption energies , which are necessary to judge how the impurities can be removed from the surface , are beyond these standard approaches which make their calculation a challenging problem .",
    "last but not least , among the fundamental aspects of studying impurities on graphene , in some cases molecularly doped graphene represents itself an unavoidable outcome of its production processes .",
    "recently windekvist _ _ et al.__@xcite have reported a method of graphene fabrication based on sonochemical exfoliation of bromine - intercalated graphite .",
    "it was shown that ultrasonic treatment of graphite with absorbed bromine molecules results in intensive graphene - flakes formation .",
    "it is worth mentioning that intercalated graphite by itself has many potential applications.@xcite    in this paper we show that the adsorption of halogens on graphene is determined generally by the van der waals ( vdw ) interactions . besides the vdw interaction we also found a considerable ionic contribution for f@xmath0 and i@xmath0 adsorbates .",
    "we demonstrate that the ionic component of the interaction arises due to the electronic transfer from graphene to the molecules .",
    "furthermore , the ionic interaction gives rise to a long - range tail of adsorption curves , which determines the adsorption at large distances .    in this work",
    "we also apply a van der waals density functional approach ( vdw - df)@xcite to investigate structural and energetic properties of graphite intercalated by different diatomic halogen molecules .",
    "we show that the interlayer distance and binding energies in graphite are also dependent on the exchange - correlation functional . using vdw - df method",
    "we have calculated interplanar binding of graphite layers in the presence of halogen molecules , which was found to be significantly weaker than the binding in pure graphite .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we briefly describe methods of the calculations . in sec .",
    "iii we present the results of adsorption of f@xmath0 , cl@xmath0 , br@xmath0 , and i@xmath0 on graphene .",
    "section iv is devoted to the analysis of electronic structure and ionic interaction between graphene and its adsorbates .",
    "the results of graphite intercalation by halogen molecules and corresponding discussion are given in sec .",
    "v. in sec .",
    "vi we briefly summarize our results .",
    "the structure of the systems under consideration was modelled using a supercell approach .",
    "the supercell consists of one graphene layer with a molecule on the top and a vacuum region to avoid spurious interaction between periodic images of the supercell in @xmath1-direction . in order to examine the effects of impurity concentration two supercells containing 24 and 32 carbon atoms per single molecule",
    "were considered .",
    "the corresponding graphene layers were constructed from rectangular @xmath2 and @xmath3 unit cells , respectively .",
    "the height of the supercells perpendicular to the surface was chosen to be 40  .",
    "investigating the supercells of such a size allows us to judge how the interactions between molecules can affect the system properties .",
    "we used the lattice constant of graphene equal to @xmath4=2.459 in accordance with experimentally obtained value for graphite at low temperatures.@xcite the distortion of graphene layer in the presence of adsorbates was not taken into account . since the interaction between the molecules and graphene is pretty weak the distortions of carbon lattice is supposed to be small , anyway .",
    "interatomic distances in the halogen molecules were also taken from the experimental data.@xcite    both in - plane and perpendicular - to - plane orientations of the molecules on graphene have been investigated .",
    "we considered five in - plane and three perpendicular - to - plane configurations corresponding to high - symmetry adsorption sites as illustrated in fig.[structures ] .",
    "-axis , ( e ) a bridge site along _ y_-axis .",
    "molecules perpendicular to the surface are located above : ( f ) a bridge site , ( g ) a hollow site , ( h ) a top site.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]      ground - state energies and electronic density distributions have been calculated using the plane - wave pseudopotential method as implemented in the quantum - espresso simulation package.@xcite exchange and correlation effects have been generally taken into account using vdw - df nonlocal functional ( see the next subsection for details ) . in order to obtain some comparative results the gga functional in pedrew - burke - ernzerhof ( pbe ) parametrization@xcite also was used .    in our calculations we employed an energy cutoff of 30 ry for the plane - wave basis and 300 ry for the charge density .",
    "self - consistent calculations of the kohn - sham equations were carried out employing the convergence criterion of 10@xmath5 ry .",
    "for accurate brillouin - zone integration the tetrahedron scheme@xcite and ( 16 @xmath6 16 @xmath6 1 ) monkhorst - pack * k*-point mesh @xcite were used .",
    "geometry optimization algorithms were not used in our study .",
    "atoms in graphene layer and interatomic distances in the molecules were assumed to be fixed . in order to find equilibrium distances of adsorbates we performed a set of explicit energy calculations for different separations from the surface .",
    "the most stable positions of the molecules were determined comparing the energies of different high - symmetry adsorption sites .      in the recent years",
    "several reasonable methods have been developed to improve the performance of dft in description of sparse matter.@xcite most of them are based on the adiabatic connection fluctuation - dissipation framework ( acfd ) , which is a computationally very demanding approach and , in practice , is limited to small systems only.@xcite    here , to calculate adsorption energies , we use an approach proposed by dion _",
    "et al_.@xcite the main idea of the method is that the acfd correlation energy can be significantly simplified by applying a series of reasonable approximations resulting in the expression dependent on the electronic density only .",
    "although being developed only recently , up to now this method has been widely verified on a large variety of examples and shows the transferability across a broad spectrum of interactions , such as ionic , covalent , and vdw.@xcite        in the vdw - df method , the exchange - correlation energy functional consists of several contributions , @xmath7=e_x^{revpbe}[n]+e_c^{lda}[n]+e_c^{nl}[n ] , \\label{exc}\\ ] ] where the first term corresponds to the exchange part of the revised pbe ( revpbe ) functional,@xcite @xmath8 is the lda correlation energy , and @xmath9 $ ] is the nonlocal correlation correction , which is calculated in the following way : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the electronic density and @xmath12 is a function incorporating many - body density response ( for details see ref . ) .",
    "it should be emphasized that in our work we evaluate the nonlocal correction ( eq.[nonlocal ] ) in a perturbative way , i.e. using only gga - based ( semi - local ) electronic density distribution .",
    "this choice looks quite reasonable since it has been previously shown that the effects due to the lack of self - consistency are negligible.@xcite",
    "as we have already mentioned , we consider two different sizes of the supercell in order to figure out the influence of intermolecular binding on the investigated properties .",
    "we found that the adsorption energy at higher concentrations of halogens is slightly lower , however , this difference does not exceed 10 mev and could be considered as insignificant . due to this fact we do not expect any considerable changes in adsorption for different molecular concentrations . in the rest of this section we present the results only for the smaller supercell containing 24 carbon atoms .",
    "we found the in - plane bridge position ( fig.[structures]a ) to be the most stable configuration for all the molecules under consideration .",
    "the binding energies for this particular geometry are shown in fig.[ad_curves ] as a function of the distance between the surface and the center of mass of the molecule .",
    "it is clear from fig.[ad_curves ] that the account of the vdw interaction gives a considerable contribution to the binding energy for each molecule examined .",
    "one can see that the larger the radii of atoms in the molecule the stronger is the vdw binding to the surface .",
    "this fact can be easily figured out using the interpretation of the vdw interaction as an interaction of induced dipoles .",
    "one can see from fig.[ad_curves ] that the binding energy of the molecules decreases quite slowly with the distance .",
    "this fact is the most evident for the fluorine molecule ( fig.[ad_curves]a ) , due to the relatively small energy scale .",
    "moreover , the behavior of fluorine binding with graphene at large distances is fairly close to inverse proportionality and , therefore , indicates the presence of a strong ionic interaction . indeed , at the distance of several angstroms the electronic density of graphene does not overlap with that of adsorbed molecules , which means that covalent interaction can not occur in this case .",
    "furthermore , the slowly vanishing tail of adsorption curves remains , even without taking into account the vdw correction , which confirms the ionic nature of such long - range interaction .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     it was recently demonstrated that graphene sheets are impermeable even to light gases including helium.@xcite for this reason , we can not expect that the intercalation of halogen molecules in graphite is a result of a penetration of the molecules underneath the top surface layer . on the contrary",
    ", we suppose that the formation of intercalated graphite involves a consecutive exfoliation of the whole graphite structure .    in table",
    "[ grt_table ] we summarize equilibrium distances , absorption energies , and interlayer binding energies calculated for the investigated systems.@xcite the interlayer distance in intercalated graphite is approximately twice larger than in the pure case .",
    "we note , however , that the estimation of the interlayer spacing is not very accurate since we ignore in our calculations a distortion of the intercalated graphite lattice , which will inevitably take place in the real situation .",
    "the absorption energies given in table [ grt_table ] are positive because their calculation involves a positive energy of the exfoliation process .",
    "it should be pointed out that among the other considered molecules , iodine molecule has a minimal absorption energy value .",
    "the binding energies obtained for the pure graphite are in a good agreement with the previous vdw - df calculations.@xcite comparing the interlayer binding for the pure and for the intercalated graphite , we conclude that the binding becomes significantly weaker in the presence of halogen molecules . moreover , the binding energy is lower for the more massive molecules because of their stronger interaction with the carbon layers , as discussed in sec.iii .",
    "our results are in a qualitative agreement with the previous lda calculations for bromine - intercalated graphite.@xcite although the interlayer binding for our particular impurity concentration seems to be overestimated ( in absolute values ) in comparison with the lda results , the general tendency is reproduced quite well and allows to confirm the interpretation of the experiment on sonochemical exfoliation of intercalated graphite given in ref ..",
    "we have performed a first - principles investigation of the adsorption of diatomic halogen molecules on graphene .",
    "we have shown that a major part of the binding energy in the system corresponds to van der waals interaction , and , therefore , can not be properly described by means of standard ( semi-)local approximations to exchange - correlation energy .",
    "it has been found that even at the large distances ( up to 10  ) there is a non - zero interaction between graphene and f@xmath0 , br@xmath0 , i@xmath0 molecules .",
    "this interactions are of ionic nature and arise due to the charge transfer from graphene to the molecules .",
    "in contrast to f@xmath0 and cl@xmath0 adsorbates , the densities of states for graphene in the presence of br@xmath0 and i@xmath0 molecules exhibit impurity bands right above the fermi level , which can result , for large enough concentration , in the metallization of graphene .",
    "moreover , the width of the impurity band is directly dependent on the impurity concentration .",
    "finally , investigating properties of intercalated graphite we have found that interlayer binding becomes significantly weaker than in pure graphite .",
    "this is in agreement with the previous experimental and theoretical investigations of intercalated graphite .",
    "we would like to thank irina grigorieva and tim wehling for helpful discussions .",
    "we also appreciate the assistance of claudia ambrosch - draxl and dmitrii nabok for providing a very efficient algorithm for the calculation of vdw - df correlation energies by monte - carlo method .",
