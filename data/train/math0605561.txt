    "the standard taylor - dispersion problem ( taylor ( 1953 ) ) is to determine the approximate long - time distribution of some passive tracer with density @xmath0 in a channel or pipe @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is some connected smooth one- or two - dimensional manifold .",
    "the governing equation in pde form is @xmath3 where @xmath4 is time , @xmath5 is the velocity field , and @xmath6 is the diffusivity , usually with zero - flux boundary conditions on the walls . here",
    "we focus on the case where @xmath7 $ ] and the component of the velocity along the channel is a periodic function of time .    the early work on oscillatory flows focused on flow in pipes ( aris ( 1960 ) ) , and much later work on oceanographic applications in unbounded flows ( young et .",
    "al . ( 1982 ) ) , but more recently there has been interest in biomechanics , notably schmidt et",
    "( 2005 ) , and the references therein , who studied consequences of oscillatory flows on nutrient transport in bone during physical activity and ultrasonic therapy . in these biomechanical applications ,",
    "the flow is probably better modelled by a combination of shear- and pressure - driven flows , and natural questions are whether these contributions interact , and whether the phase difference between the two components is important .",
    "also in this study we find an expression for the taylor dispersivity that is more appropriate for use with computer algebra packages .",
    "this extends the work of jansons and rogers ( 1995 ) , by providing a more accessible version of the solution in a form that could be easily applied by people not familiar with the theory of stochastic processes , although it uses stochastic calculus in its derivation .    using computer algebra",
    ", we then find the general expression for the taylor dispersivity at zero reynolds number for sinusoidal shear and poiseuille flow with arbitrary phase difference , and show in particular that the taylor dispersivity is independent of this phase difference .",
    "this extends the work of claes and van de broeck ( 1991 ) .",
    "we also find exact expressions for the taylor dispersivity at zero reynolds number for several pressure - driven power - law fluid flows .",
    "we suppose that the _ vertical _ diffusion @xmath8 is confined to the interval @xmath9 $ ] , which in it form is governed by @xmath10 where @xmath11 is a standard brownian motion ( that is , it has diffusivity @xmath12 ) , and @xmath13 and @xmath14 are local - time terms to keep the particle in the interval .",
    "( the local times change only when @xmath8 hits a boundary . ) the above equation describes , in fluid mechanical terms , a particle with diffusivity @xmath15 and vertical drift @xmath16 . for simplicity",
    ", we take @xmath17 to be constant , as it is in almost all applications , though this condition could easily be relaxed , and we also , for simplicity , assume that @xmath16 is bounded .    as is usual in taylor - dispersion problems , we neglect the effect of particle diffusion in the @xmath18 direction , though it would not be difficult to include this effect if it were considered useful . thus the _ horizontal _ displacement is given by @xmath19 where @xmath20 is a periodic function of time , with period @xmath21 say , and `` @xmath22 '' means equal by definition .    from",
    ", we see that the stationary vertical density @xmath23 is given by @xmath24   = \\alpha \\exp\\left(\\int_0^y \\frac{2v(\\eta)}{\\sigma^2 } d\\eta\\right)\\,dy,\\ ] ] where @xmath25 is a normalization constant ( so @xmath26 ) .",
    "the part of the horizontal displacement due to the cross - channel mean of horizontal advection is trivial , and unimportant in the long - time limit as it is bounded , so we remove this contribution from the problem by replacing @xmath27 with @xmath28 .    to find the variance of @xmath29 ,",
    "apply it s formula : @xmath30 for some function @xmath31 to be identified .",
    "now take @xmath32 for all @xmath4 to remove the local - time terms , and @xmath33 where @xmath31 is taken to be an oscillatory function of @xmath4 , with period @xmath21 .",
    "this gives @xmath34 where @xmath35 the integral term can be rewritten , namely @xmath36 where @xmath37 is a standard brownian motion .",
    "then the ergodic theorem tell us that in the limit @xmath38 , @xmath39 first observe that @xmath40/t = \\lim_{t\\to\\infty}e[x'_t]/t,\\ ] ] and second that @xmath31 is bounded .",
    "thus , , together with the other observations , implies that the taylor dispersivity is given by @xmath41/t = \\frac\\omega{2\\pi}\\int_0^{2\\pi/\\omega}\\int_0^a \\left(\\frac{\\partial      f}{\\partial y}(t , y)\\right)^2 q(y ) dy \\ , dt.\\ ] ] furthermore , in the limit @xmath38 , @xmath42 in distribution .",
    "throughout this section , we assume that the vertical advection @xmath43 . furthermore , suppose that the horizontal advection has the form @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are both periodic functions of time with period @xmath21 , and , for all @xmath4 and @xmath47 , that @xmath48 , and @xmath49 , where again the dashes denote that the @xmath47 means have been removed . in this case , since is linear , @xmath31 can be split into @xmath50 and @xmath51 forced respectively by @xmath52 and @xmath53 , and inheriting the same symmetries in @xmath47 .",
    "thus implies that @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the taylor dispersivities respectively for @xmath45 and @xmath46 , since @xmath57 and @xmath58 as the integrand is an odd function of @xmath59 .",
    "note that does not hold in general for arbitrary @xmath16 , unless the periods of the two oscillations are different .",
    "we now consider several example flows in which it is possible to find the taylor dispersivity exactly .",
    "we begin by considering the way in which shear- and pressure - driven flows interact in the case of a newtonian fluid , and then consider several cases of power - law fluid flows . in these examples ,",
    "the vertical advection velocity @xmath16 is zero .",
    "the former , in effect , provide solutions to the hele - shaw cell model of the corresponding porous material system , namely a microscopic flow driven by shearing the whole porous material , and a pressure - driven flow for a fixed porous material . for biomechanical applications , see schmidt et .",
    "( 2005 ) .",
    "in general we need to solve , and the algebra is very messy even in simple cases",
    ". if @xmath16 , the vertical advection velocity , is non - zero , even if it is constant , the corresponding expressions for taylor dispersivity @xmath60 are too complicated to show here , even for simple horizontal flows . however , using symbolic algebra packages , it is possible to find simple exact expressions for @xmath60 in some cases .    for simplicity in the rest of this section , we choose units that make @xmath61 , and @xmath62 .",
    "also in these special cases @xmath63 , so reduces to @xmath64 with @xmath65 for all @xmath4 . since @xmath43 and @xmath62",
    ", we find @xmath66 , which slightly simplifies . with this non - dimensionalization ,",
    "the time - scale for the cross - channel relaxation to occur is @xmath67 , and the time - scale of the oscillations is @xmath68 . in the following examples ,",
    "@xmath69 is proportional to @xmath70 .",
    "thus , when doing the computer algebra , we can consider @xmath69 and @xmath31 to be the real parts of functions proportional to @xmath71 .      for @xmath72 , using computer algebra , we find from and @xmath73 where @xmath74 ( see figure [ plot1 ] ) . in the limit of small @xmath75 ,",
    "@xmath76 in the limit of large @xmath75 , @xmath77 this is in agreement with the result of claes and van de broeck ( 1991 ) .",
    "this is almost , but not exactly , the result previously found by young et .",
    "al . ( 1982 ) and extended by jansons and rogers ( 1995 ) for the case of unbounded flow .",
    "it differs by a factor of @xmath78 from the result of young et .",
    "al . ( 1982 ) , which is explained by jansons and rogers ( 1995 ) , and lacks the oscillatory term of jansons and rogers ( 1995 ) .",
    "the large @xmath75 result here is , as expected , the average of the result for the unbounded case .",
    "similarly for @xmath79 , and solving for @xmath60 using computer algebra , we find @xmath80 ( see figure [ plot1 ] ) . in the limit of small @xmath75 ,",
    "@xmath81 in the limit of large @xmath75 , @xmath82 this agrees with the result obtained by claes and van de broeck ( 1991 ) .",
    "we now extend the work of claes and van de broeck ( 1991 ) , and consider a flow driven by both a moving upper boundary and a pressure gradient , but not necessarily in phase , namely @xmath83 where @xmath84 is a constant . from , and , we find @xmath85 notice that this result does not depend on the phase shift , which could be important in some applications .      the same approach can be used to quickly find exact expressions for some non - newtonian flows . here",
    "we consider power - law fluid flows , driven by pressure gradients .",
    "however , most of the results are too complex to give here , and are essentially useful only in computer programs . however , with the procedure given here , the reader can quickly recalculate them with the help of computer algebra .",
    "these flows are of the following form : @xmath86 where the constant is fixed by the boundary conditions which may be no - slip or partial slip .",
    "( note that @xmath87 is not the defining parameter of a power - law fluid , but it is more convenient here . )",
    "however the results for the taylor dispersivity does not depend on the constant .",
    "exact expressions for the taylor dispersivity can be found for some values of @xmath87 .",
    "however , the expressions for integer @xmath87 seem to be by far the simplest , and we give a few examples of these below .",
    "we were unable to find the solution for general @xmath87 .",
    "as these flows are symmetrical about @xmath88 , we solve in a half range which means we avoid the singularity at @xmath88 , which is problematic for computer algebra .    in the following results , we do not take account of the relaxation times for the fluid , so we must assume that the time - scale of the oscillation is long compared with these .",
    "the case @xmath89 is a rescaling of the newtonian shear - flow result above : @xmath90    the case @xmath91 is for a newtonian fluid , already considered above ( see ): @xmath92    the case @xmath93 : @xmath94    the case @xmath95 : @xmath96    the case @xmath97 : @xmath98    the case @xmath99 : @xmath100    notice that in each case @xmath101 tends to a constant as @xmath102 .",
    "there is little point in going beyond @xmath99 as it is almost plug flow , with almost all the dispersion occurring near the boundaries .",
    "the above results suggest that in the case of integer @xmath87 there is probably some not too complex generating function for the taylor dispersivities , but was unable to work through the necessary algebra",
    ". however , since it would need computer algebra to unpack the generating function , one is probably better off computing the required taylor dispersivity directly .    a plot of all the results of this section are given in figure [ plot2 ] .",
    "notice that even though we have considered only integer @xmath87 , the curves are sufficiently close that interpolation would be expected to well approximate intermediate values over the interesting part of the @xmath75 range .",
    "also , given that the case @xmath91 is known , the fact that the other plots are close to this , and occur in the expected order , is a good consistency check on the other results .      from we can see that , for small @xmath75 , the approximate balance is @xmath103 and",
    "therefore the taylor dispersivity is approximately the time - average of the non - oscillatory taylor dispersivities for the instantaneous flows . in the sinusoidal case",
    "this is just @xmath12 of the non - oscillatory taylor dispersivity for the peak @xmath69 .    for large @xmath75 ,",
    "the approximate balance is @xmath104 giving an asymptotic taylor dispersivity @xmath105 where @xmath106 is defined by @xmath107 .",
    "we have shown that the alternative method for determining the taylor dispersivity for an oscillatory flow lends itself to exact evaluation using computer algebra .",
    "figure [ plot1 ] shows that for the two simple flows considered , namely an oscillatory simple shear flow and an oscillatory poiseuille flow , both have a strong frequency- dependent taylor dispersivity .",
    "these systems therefore could be used for measuring particle diffusivities more accurately by choosing a frequency that moves the corresponding taylor dispersivities into the sensitive range .",
    "alternatively , the same physical system could be used for separating particles of different diffusivities .",
    "experimentally the oscillatory simple shear flow is particularly easy to set up in a laboratory .",
    "one interesting direction for future research is applications to transport in bones , and other connective tissues , subjected to oscillatory stresses ( for example due to exercise or during ultra sound therapy ) .",
    "it appears that physical processes of the type discussed here are essential for normal function , and a better understanding could result in more effective treatment .",
    "these applications however involve much more complex geometries , although would be expected to be qualitatively similar .",
    "the solutions here are in effect those for the hele - shaw cell model of a porous material .",
    "given we have shown that the taylor dispersivities for shear- and pressure - driven flows do not interact in a channel flow , it is a natural question to ask if this carries over ( at least approximately ) to these biomechanical applications , where both effects are likely to be present .",
    "it is clear that many more non - newtonian examples are possible with this approach .",
    "however , it is less clear if there are any nice exact expressions for flows with a non - zero vertical ( i.e. cross - channel ) component .",
    "the intermediate expressions in these cases are much more complex , with more branch cuts , but there does appear to be hope .",
    "this is one area in which computer algebra is currently weak ."
