    "such estimation was mathematically confirmed for some small knots .",
    "diao proved that the minimum step number of any non - trivial knot type is at least 24 and only @xmath0 can be realized with 24 steps @xcite .",

    "the _ lattice stick number _ @xmath16 of a knot type @xmath3 is defined to be the minimal number of sticks required to construct a lattice knot of the knot type .",

    "since @xmath25 is properly leveled and @xmath57 , it has only four @xmath29-levels and therefore only four @xmath29-sticks , namely @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 , where each @xmath62 denotes the @xmath29-stick between two @xmath29-levels @xmath36 and @xmath37 . for brevity of notation ,",

    "the proper leveledness of @xmath25 , the two vertices @xmath75 and @xmath76 should be connected by a portion of @xmath25 which is contained in a single @xmath28-level .",
    "in fact the connecting arc should contain more than one of the @xmath29-sticks which are @xmath60 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 .",
    "similarly for the connection of @xmath77 and @xmath74 , we need more than one @xmath29-stick , which is a contradiction .",
    "now assume that their intersection contains a line segment . without loss of generality",
    "we may assume that the related two sticks are @xmath28-sticks .",
    "because of the proper leveledness of @xmath25 , the two @xmath28-sticks are connected by a portion of @xmath25 , namely @xmath78 , which is contained in a single @xmath27-level , that is , @xmath78 includes only @xmath28-sticks and @xmath29-sticks .",
    "if @xmath78 contains @xmath61 , then it should be @xmath61 itself .",
    "this implies that the number of sticks of @xmath25 can be reduced by @xmath35 as depicted in figure [ fig:2]-(b ) , contradicting the irreducibility of @xmath25 .",
    "thus @xmath78 consists of three @xmath29-sticks @xmath60 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 , and two more @xmath28-sticks between them alternately . now consider a connected portion of @xmath25 which is obtained by deleting @xmath78 and two @xmath28-sticks attached to @xmath78 .",

    "the resulting polygon represents the same knot as @xmath25 , but has fewer sticks .",

    "now assume that it has only one transversal double point .",
    "@xmath82 separates the @xmath68-plane into two regions @xmath83 and @xmath84 one of which is unbounded .",
    "then @xmath85 and @xmath86 lie inside the same region , say @xmath83 .",
    "if another point @xmath87 lies inside @xmath83 , we can isotope two subarcs @xmath88 and @xmath89 of @xmath25 on the planes @xmath81 and @xmath90 respectively so that their projections do not meet each other and also @xmath82 except for their endpoints .",
    "this implies that the knot @xmath25 has a diagram with only one crossing , that is , @xmath25 is trivial . if @xmath87 lies inside @xmath84 , we can similarly isotope @xmath88 and @xmath89 so that their projections do not meet each other and each projection meets transversely @xmath82 exactly once .",
    "thus the knot @xmath25 has a diagram with @xmath91 crossings , that is , @xmath25 is trivial or @xmath0 .",
    "both cases contradict the irreducibility of @xmath25 .",
    "now we observe @xmath82 on the square lattice @xmath92 of the @xmath68-plane which is @xmath93 , more precisely on @xmath94 \\times \\{1,2,3,4,5\\ } ) \\cup ( \\{1,2,3,4,5\\ } \\times [ 1,5])$ ] .",
    "also we indicate an over / under - crossing at each crossing point so that @xmath95 goes over @xmath96 .",
    "suppose that there is a pair of subarcs of @xmath96 and @xmath95 so that they meet exactly twice , one arc consists of only one stick and the other consists of three sticks , and the region bounded by these two subarcs has no place to put a @xmath29-stick in its interior as in figure [ fig:3 ] .",
    "then we isotope @xmath25 by using a reidermeister move ii and rearrange the related @xmath27 or @xmath28-levels so that @xmath25 is still properly leveled . from now on we assume that there is no such pair of subarcs .",
    "assume for contradiction that it contains a pair of subarcs of type-1 or 2 . to simplify the proof",
    ", we also assume that both subarcs of the pair intersect each other on their end sticks .",
    "let @xmath97 be the pair of subarcs of @xmath98 whose projection is the previous pair of subarcs of type-1 or 2 .",
    "first we will show that @xmath97 consists of either six or eight sticks .",
    "each subarc is an array of @xmath27-sticks and @xmath28-sticks connected alternately .",
    "two sticks producing a double point are exactly one @xmath27-stick and one @xmath28-stick",
    ". then obviously @xmath97 uses the same number of @xmath27-sticks and @xmath28-sticks , so an even number of sticks .",
    "clearly a @xmath97 of either type needs at least six sticks . also the number of sticks of @xmath98 is at most eight because @xmath25 has exactly four @xmath29-sticks , and each of @xmath88 and @xmath89 on the boundary levels consists of either one or two sticks .",
    "now consider the other two subarcs of @xmath99 .",
    "one subarc consists of @xmath61 and some @xmath27 or @xmath28-sticks , and the other consists of @xmath59 , @xmath58 , @xmath60 and some @xmath27 or @xmath28-sticks . in the latter case",
    "we need at least two @xmath27 or @xmath28-sticks because any two @xmath29-sticks can not be adjoined .",
    "note that if @xmath97 has eight sticks , then @xmath99 consists of exactly one @xmath27-stick , one @xmath28-stick and four @xmath29-sticks .",
    "thus one component of @xmath99 is just one stick @xmath61 .    without loss of generality",
    "we say @xmath100 .",
    "first assume that @xmath97 is of type-1 .",
    "then it consists of eight sticks .",
    "since one subarc of @xmath99 is just @xmath61 , @xmath82 is one of the two cases as drawn in figure [ fig:5 ] .",
    "as mentioned in the statement before lemma [ lemma : no ] , we disregard the cases producing such a pair of subarcs as in the leftmost figure in figure [ fig:3 ] . in each figure",
    "@xmath61 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 are placed at the points @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 , respectively .",
    "furthermore @xmath95 is the subarc from @xmath75 to @xmath76 and @xmath96 is the arc from @xmath75 to @xmath77 . in both cases @xmath88 and @xmath89 are just one stick . thus @xmath58 must be placed at either @xmath74 or @xmath101 in the left case , and either @xmath102 or @xmath103 in the right case . but @xmath58 can not be placed at @xmath74 , @xmath101 , and @xmath102 .",
    "also if @xmath58 is placed at @xmath103 in the right case , then @xmath25 is reducible , a contradiction .",
    "now assume that @xmath97 is of type-2 .",
    "if @xmath97 consists of eight sticks , one subarc of @xmath99 is just @xmath61 .",
    "this means that @xmath82 is obtained from @xmath104 by adding one point @xmath105 .",
    "but this is impossible because two end points of each subarc of @xmath104 lie on different sides of the circle in @xmath104 .",
    "therefore @xmath97 consists of six sticks , and so @xmath82 is one of the four cases as drawn in figure [ fig:6 ] . in each figure",
    "the arc from @xmath75 to @xmath76 is a subarc of @xmath95 and the arc from @xmath77 to @xmath74 is a subarc of @xmath96 .",
    "since @xmath97 consists of @xmath91 @xmath27-sticks and @xmath91 @xmath28-sticks , @xmath99 consists of @xmath106 @xmath27-sticks , @xmath106 @xmath28-sticks and @xmath107 @xmath29-sticks . in each of the four figures ,",
    "if one subarc of @xmath99 connects @xmath75 and @xmath77 , it must consist of one @xmath27-stick , one @xmath28-stick and some @xmath29-sticks since we also need at least one @xmath27-stick and one @xmath28-stick to connect @xmath76 and @xmath74 .",
    "therefore this subarc must go through the point @xmath101 , so @xmath25 is reducible .",
    "thus one subarc of @xmath99 should run from @xmath75 to @xmath74 , and also it must go through the point @xmath102 .",
    "there are two possibilities .",
    "this subarc is either consisting of @xmath91 sticks which are an @xmath27-stick , a @xmath28-stick and @xmath61 in this order or consisting of @xmath108 sticks which are @xmath59 , an @xmath27-stick , @xmath58 , a @xmath28-stick and @xmath60 in this order . in both cases",
    "@xmath25 is reducible .",
    "now we prove lemma [ lem : main ] . by lemma [ lemma :",
    "no ] , @xmath82 after deleting an arc portion of itself near @xmath105 is of the form with @xmath33 crossings as in figure [ fig:7]-(a ) .",
    "let @xmath109 be the @xmath110 regions bounded by these two arcs .",
    "now draw the whole @xmath82 by adding the deleted portion .",
    "since @xmath105 should be located in the unbounded region outside @xmath111 , the added arc divides the region into two regions @xmath112 and @xmath113 , and the two points @xmath85 and @xmath86 lie in @xmath114 .",

    "then , as illustrated in figure [ fig:8 ] , we can isotope each of the subarcs @xmath88 , @xmath72 and @xmath89 along its respective @xmath29-level so that @xmath70 meets @xmath69 in at most one point , and each of @xmath117 and @xmath118 meets @xmath79 in at most one point .",
    "the latter is possible because @xmath112 and @xmath113 are adjacent to each other .",
    "this means that @xmath25 has a diagram with at most @xmath91 crossings , a contradiction .",
    "therefore @xmath87 lies in one of @xmath119 s , say @xmath120 .",
