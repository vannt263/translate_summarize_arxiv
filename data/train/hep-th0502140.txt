    "topological strings on calabi - yau manifolds describe certain solvable sectors of superstrings and as such provide simplified toy models of string theory .",
    "there are two inequivalent ways to twist the calabi - yau sigma model .",
    "this yields topological theories known as the a - model and the b - model , which at first sight depend on different degrees of freedom : the a - model apparently only involves the khler moduli and the b - model only the complex moduli .",
    "however , this changes once branes are included , and it has been conjectured that there is a version of s - duality which maps the a - model to the b - model @xcite . subsequently , several authors found evidence for the existence of seven and/or eight dimensional theories that unify and extend the a and b - model @xcite .",
    "this was one of our original motivations to take a closer look at string theory on seven - dimensional manifolds of @xmath0 holonomy , and to see whether it allows for a topological twist , though we were motivated by other issues as well , such as applications to m - theory compactifications on @xmath0-manifolds , and as a possible tool to improve our understanding of the relation between supersymmetric gauge theories in three and four dimensions .",
    "the outline of this note is as follows .",
    "we will first review sigma - models on target spaces of @xmath0 holonomy , and the structure of chiral the algebra of these theories .",
    "the latter is a non - linear extension of the @xmath1 @xmath2 superconformal algebra that contains an @xmath2 subalgebra with @xmath3 .",
    "this describes a minimal model , the tricritical ising model , which plays a crucial role in the twisting .",
    "we then go on to describe the twisting , the brst operator , the physical states , and we end with a discussion of topological @xmath0 strings . here",
    "we briefly summarize our findings .",
    "a more detailed discussion will appear elsewhere @xcite .",
    "there is extensive literature about string theory and m - theory compactified on @xmath0 manifolds .",
    "the first detailed study of the world - sheet formulation of strings on @xmath0 manifolds appeared in @xcite .",
    "the world - sheet chiral algebra was studied in some detail in @xcite . for more about type",
    "ii strings on @xmath0 manifolds and their mirror symmetry , see e.g. @xcite . a review of m - theory on @xmath0 manifolds with many references can be found in @xcite .",
    "we start from an @xmath4 sigma model describing @xmath5 chiral superfields @xmath6 s= d^2z   d^2  ( g _ + b _ ) d_^d_| ^. the super stress - energy tensor is given by @xmath7 .",
    "this @xmath4 sigma model can be formulated on an arbitrary target space . however , the target space theory will have some supersymmetry only when the manifold has special holonomy .",
    "this condition ensures the existence of covariantly constant spinors which are used to construct supercharges .",
    "the existence of a covariantly constant spinor on the manifold also implies the existence of covariantly constant _ p - forms _ given by [ peeform ] _",
    "( p)=^t _ i_1 ",
    "i_p  dx^i_1 dx^i_p .",
    "this formal expression may be identically zero .",
    "the details of the target space manifold dictate which p - forms are actually present",
    ". if the manifold has special holonomy @xmath8 , the non - vanishing forms ( [ peeform ] ) are precisely the forms that transform trivially under @xmath9 .",
    "the existence of such covariantly constant p - forms on the target space manifold implies the existence of extra elements in the chiral algebra .",
    "for example , given a covariantly constant @xmath10 form , @xmath11 satisfying @xmath12 , we can construct a holomorphic superfield current given by @xmath13 which satisfies @xmath14 on shell . in components , this implies the existence of a dimension @xmath15 and a dimension @xmath16 current .",
    "for example , on a kahler manifold , the existence of a covariantly constant kahler two form @xmath17 implies the existence of a dimension 1 current @xmath18 and a dimension @xmath19 current @xmath20 , which add to the @xmath21 superconformal currents @xmath22 and @xmath23 to give a @xmath24 superconformal algebra .",
    "a generic seven dimensional riemannian manifold has @xmath25 holonomy .",
    "a @xmath26 manifold has holonomy which sits in a @xmath0 subgroup of @xmath25 . under this embedding ,",
    "the eight dimensional spinor representation @xmath27 of @xmath25 decomposes into a @xmath28 and a singlet of @xmath0 , and the latter corresponds to the covariantly constant spinor .",
    "the @xmath10-form ( [ peeform ] ) is non - trivial only when @xmath29 . in other words , there is a covariantly constant 3-form @xmath30 .",
    "the hodge dual 4-form is then also automatically covariantly constant .    by the above discussion",
    ", the 3-form implies the existence of a superfield current @xmath31 .",
    "explicitly , @xmath32 is a dimension @xmath19 current @xmath33 and @xmath34 is its dimension 2 superpartner @xmath35 .",
    "similarly , the 4-from implies the existence of a dimension 2 current @xmath36 and its dimension @xmath37 superpartner @xmath38 .",
    "the chiral algebra of @xmath0 sigma models thus contains 4 extra currents on top of the two @xmath39 that constitute the @xmath2 superconformal algebra .",
    "these six generators form a closed quantum algebra which appears explicitly e.g. in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "an important fact , which will be crucial in almost all the remaining analysis , is that the generators @xmath32 and @xmath36 form a closed sub - algebra : if we define the supercurrent @xmath40 and stress - energy tensor @xmath41 we recognize that this is the unique @xmath2 super - conformal algebra of the minimal model with central charge @xmath42 known as the _ tri - critical ising model_. this sub - algebra plays a role similar to the @xmath43 r - symmetry of the @xmath44 algebra in compactifications on calabi - yau manifolds .",
    "in fact , with respect to the conformal symmetry , the full virasoro algebra decomposes in two commuting algebras",
    ". the full @xmath45 structures do not commute .",
    "for example the superpartner of @xmath32 with respect to the full @xmath2 algebra is @xmath34 whereas its superpartner with respect to the @xmath2 of the tri - critical ising model is @xmath36 . ]",
    "virasoro algebras : @xmath46 with @xmath47 this means we can classify conformal primaries by two quantum numbers , namely its tri - critical ising model highest weight and its highest weight with respect to @xmath48 : @xmath49 .",
    "perhaps it is worth emphasizing the logic here : classically , we find a conformal algebra with six generators in sigma - models on manifolds of @xmath0 holonomy . in the quantum theory",
    "we expect , in the absence of anomalies other than the conformal anomaly , to find a quantum version of this classical algebra . in @xcite",
    "all quantum extensions were analyzed , and a two - parameter family of quantum algebras was found . requiring that the quantum algebra has the right central charge ( necessary to have a critical string theory ) and that it contains the tricritical ising model ( necessary for space - time supersymmetry ) fixes the two - parameters .",
    "this motivates why this is the appropriate definition for string theory on @xmath0 manifolds .",
    "unitary minimal models are labeled by a positive integer @xmath50 and occur only on the  discrete series \" at central charges @xmath51 .",
    "the tri - critical ising model is the second member ( @xmath52 ) which has central charge @xmath3 .",
    "it is at the same time also a minimal model for the @xmath45 superconformal algebra .",
    "the conformal primaries of unitary minimal models are labeled by two integers @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "the weights in this range are arranged into a  _ kac table _ \" .",
    "the conformal weight of the primary @xmath55 is @xmath56 ^ 2 - 1}{4p(p+1)}.$ ] in the tri - critical ising model @xmath57 there are 6 primaries of weights @xmath58 .",
    "below we write the kac table for the tricritical ising model . beside the identity operator @xmath59 and the @xmath2 supercurrent @xmath60 the ns sector ( first and third columns )",
    "contains a primary of weight @xmath61 and its @xmath2 superpartner @xmath62 .",
    "the primaries of weight @xmath63 are in the ramond sector ( middle column ) .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the hilbert space of the theory decomposes in a similar way , @xmath64 .",
    "a central theme in this work relies on the fact that since the primaries @xmath55 form a closed algebra under the ope they can be decomposed into _ conformal blocks _  which connect two hilbert spaces .",
    "conformal blocks are denoted by @xmath65 which describes the restriction of @xmath66 to a map that only acts from @xmath67 to @xmath68 .",
    "an illustrative example , which will prove crucial in what follows , is the block structure of the primary @xmath69 of weight @xmath70 .",
    "general arguments show that the fusion rule of this field with any other primary @xmath55 is @xmath71 the only non - vanishing conformal blocks in the decomposition of @xmath69 are those that connect a primary with the primary right above it and the primary right below in the kac table , namely , @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "this can be summarized formally by defining the following decomposition and does not necessarily hold for other primaries which may contain other blocks . ]",
    "[ updown ] _ 2,1=_2,1^ _",
    "2,1^. similarly , the fusion rule of the ramond field @xmath74 with any primary is @xmath75 showing that it is composed of two blocks , which we denote as follows @xmath76 conformal blocks transforms under conformal transformations exactly like the primary field they reside in but are usually not single - valued functions of @xmath77 .      the chiral - algebra associated with manifolds of @xmath0 holonomy algebra \" but it should not be confused with the lie algebra of the group @xmath0 . ] allows us to draw several conclusions about the possible spectrum of such theories .",
    "it is useful to decompose the generators of the chiral algebra in terms of primaries of the tri - critical ising model and primaries of the remainder .",
    "the commutation relations of the @xmath0 algebra imply that the some of the generators of the chiral algebra decompose as @xcite : @xmath78 and @xmath79\\otimes\\psi_{\\frac{14}{10}},$ ] with @xmath80 primaries of the indicated weights in the @xmath48 cft and @xmath81 constants .",
    "ramond ground states of the full @xmath82 scft are of the form @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "the existence of the @xmath83 state living just inside the tricritical ising model plays a crucial role in the topological twist .",
    "coupling left and right movers , the only possible rr ground states compatible with the @xmath0 chiral algebra . ] are a single @xmath85 ground state and a certain number of states of the form @xmath86 . by studying operator product expansions of the rr ground states we get the following  special \" nsns states @xmath87 corresponding to the 4 ns primaries @xmath88 with @xmath89 in the tri - critical ising model .",
    "note that for these four states there is a linear relation between the kac label @xmath90 of the tri - critical ising model part and the total conformal weight @xmath91 .",
    "in fact , it can be shown that , similar to the bps bound in the @xmath44 case , primaries of the @xmath0 chiral algebra satisfy a ( non - linear ) bound of the form [ bound ] h_i + h_r . which is precisely saturated for the four ns states listed above",
    ". we will therefore refer to those states as ",
    "chiral primary \" states .",
    "just like in the case of calabi - yau , the @xmath92 field maps ramond ground states to ns chiral primaries and is thus an analogue of the  spectral flow \" operators in calabi - yau .",
    "to construct a topologically twisted cft we usually proceed in two steps .",
    "first we define a new stress - energy tensor , which changes the quantum numbers of the fields and operators of the theory under lorentz transformations .",
    "secondly , we identify a nilpotent scalar operator , usually constructed out of the supersymmetry generators of the original theory , which we declare to be the brst operator .",
    "often this brst operator can be obtained in the usual way by gauge fixing a suitable symmetry .",
    "if the new stress tensor is exact with respect to the brst operator , observables ( which are elements of the brst cohomology ) are metric independent and the theory is called topological . in particular , the twisted stress tensor should have a vanishing central charge .",
    "in practice @xcite , for the @xmath93 theories , an n - point correlator on the sphere in the twisted theory can conveniently be defined as a correlator in the _ untwisted _ theory of the same n operators plus two insertions of a spin - field , related to the space - time supersymmetry charge , that serves to trivialize the spin bundle . for a calabi - yau 3-fold target space",
    "there are two @xmath94 invariant spin - fields which are the two spectral flow operators @xmath95 .",
    "this discrete choice in the left and the right moving sectors is the choice between the @xmath96 twists @xcite which results in the difference between the topological @xmath97 models .    in @xcite",
    "a similar expression was written down for sigma models on @xmath0 manifolds , this time involving the single @xmath0 invariant spin field which is the unique primary @xmath74 of weight @xmath92 .",
    "it was proposed that this expression could be a suitable definition of the correlation functions of a putative topologically twisted @xmath0 theory . in other words",
    "the twisted amplitudes are defined as [ twicorsphere ] v_1(z_1)  v_n(z_n)_()v_1(z_1)  v_n(z_n)(0)_. in @xcite further arguments were given , using the coulomb gas representation of the minimal model , that there exists a twisted stress tensor with vanishing central charge .",
    "this argument is however problematic , since the twisted stress tensor proposed there does not commute with felder s brst operators @xcite and therefore it does define a bona fide operator in the minimal model .",
    "in addition , a precise definition of a brst operator was lacking .",
    "we will proceed somewhat differently .",
    "we will first propose a brst operator , study its cohomology , and then use a version of ( [ twicorsphere ] ) to compute correlation functions of brst invariant observables .",
    "we will then comment on the extension to higher genus and on the existence of a topologically twisted @xmath0 string .",
    "our basic idea is that the topological theory for @xmath0 sigma models should be formulated not in terms of local operators of the untwisted theory but in terms of its ( non - local ) . ]",
    "conformal blocks .    by using the decomposition ( [ updown ] ) into conformal blocks ,",
    "we can split any field whose tri - critical ising model part contains just the conformal family @xmath69 into its _ up _ and _ down _ parts . in particular , the @xmath2 supercurrent @xmath22 can be split as [ gmsplit ] g(z)=g^(z ) + g^(z ) .",
    "we claim that @xmath98 is the brst current and @xmath99 carries many features of an anti - ghost .    the basic @xmath2 relation g(z)g(0)= ( g^(z)+g^(z ) ) ( g^(0)+g^(0))~+ proves the nilpotency of this brst current ( and of the candidate anti - ghost ) because the rhs contains descendants of the identity operator only and has trivial fusion rules with the primary fields of the tri - critical ising model and so @xmath100 .",
    "more formally , denote by @xmath101 the projection operator on the sub - space @xmath102 of states whose tri - critical ising model part lies within the conformal family of one of the four ns primaries @xmath88 .",
    "the 4 projectors add to the identity [ j11 ] p_1+p_2+p_3+p_4=1 , because this exhaust the list of possible highest weights in the ns sector of the tri - critical ising model for @xmath103 and @xmath104 , so that we can simply write @xmath105 instead of ( [ j11 ] ) . ] .",
    "we can now define our brst operator in the ns sector more rigorously [ brstop ] q = g_-12^_n p_n+1 g_-12 p_n. the nilpotency @xmath106 is easily proved q^2 = _",
    "n p_n+2 g_-12 ^ 2 p_n = _ n p_n+2 l_-1 p_n=0 , where we could replace the intermediate @xmath107 by the identity because of property [ gmsplit ]  and the last equality follows since @xmath108 maps each @xmath102 to itself .    @xmath109 does not commute with the local operator @xmath110 @xmath111 and @xmath112 corresponding to the chiral states @xmath113 ( for brevity we will denote those 4 local operators juts by their minimal model kac label @xmath114 however , it can be checked that the following blocks , [ cpbloc ] _",
    "n=_m^p_n+m-1_np_m , which pick out the maximal  down component \" of the corresponding local operator , do commute with @xmath109 and are thus in its operator cohomology .",
    "thus the chiral _ operators _  of the twisted model are represented in terms of the blocks [ cpbloc ]  of the local operators corresponding to the chiral _",
    "states_. furthermore , it can be shown easily that those chiral operator form a ring under the ope .    by doing a calculation at large volume , we see that the brst cohomology has one operator of type @xmath115 , @xmath116 of type @xmath117 , @xmath118 of type @xmath119 , and one of type @xmath120 .",
    "the total brst cohomology is thus precisely given by @xmath121 .",
    "also , one finds that the @xmath122 operators of type @xmath117 are precisely the geometric moduli of the @xmath0 target space moduli corresponding to the @xmath123-field . ] .    in the topological @xmath0 theory , genus",
    "zero correlation functions of chiral primaries between brst closed states are position independent . indeed , the generator of translations on the plane , namely @xmath108 , is brst exact    \\",
    "{ g^_-12,g^_-12}=_np_ng_-12 ( p_n-1 + p_n+1)g_-12 p_n=_np_nl_-1p_n=l_-1 .",
    "this is a crucial ingredient of topological theories .",
    "moreover , it can be shown @xcite  that the upper components @xmath124 correspond to exactly marginal deformations of the cft preserving the @xmath0 chiral algebra , completely in agreement with the identification of them as the geometric moduli of the theory . focusing momentarily on the left movers ,",
    "we can show that @xmath125= \\partial\\mathcal{a}_2 $ ] was defined in ( [ cpbloc ] ) .",
    "] so that the very same deformation is physical , namely q exact , also in the topological theory .",
    "note that the deformation is given by a conventional operator that does not involve any projectors . combining with the right - movers , we find that the deformations in the action of the topological string are exactly the same as the deformations of the non - topological string as is expected because both should exist on an arbitrary manifold of @xmath0 holonomy .",
    "most correlation functions at genus zero vanish .",
    "the most interesting one is the three - point function of three operators @xmath126 .",
    "these correspond to geometric moduli .",
    "if we introduce coordinates @xmath127 on the moduli space of @xmath0 metrics , then we obtain from a large volume calculation @xmath128 one might expect , based on general arguments , that this is the third derivative of some prepotential if suitable ` flat ' coordinates are used .",
    "we do not know the precise definition of flat coordinates for the moduli space of @xmath0 metrics , but if we take for example @xmath129 and take coordinates such that @xmath130 is linear in them , then we can verify @xmath131 the prepotential appearing on the right hand side is exactly the same as the action functional introduced by hitchin in @xcite .",
    "a similar action was also used as a starting point for topological m - theory in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "this strongly suggests that our topological @xmath0 field theory is somehow related to topological m - theory .",
    "in the case of @xmath132 theories , the computation of correlation functions at genus zero outlined above can be generalized to higher genera @xcite .",
    "an n - point correlator on a genus - g riemann surface in the twisted theory can be defined as a correlator in the untwisted theory of the same n operators plus @xmath133 insertions of the spin - field that is related to the space - time supersymmetry charge . for a calabi - yau 3-fold target space on a riemann surface with @xmath134 , the meaning of",
    "the above prescription is to insert @xmath135 of the conjugate spectral flow operator .    to generalize this to the @xmath0 situation",
    ", we would like to have something similar .",
    "however , there is only one @xmath0 invariant spin - field .",
    "this is where the decomposition in conformal blocks given in section  [ tim ] is useful : the spin - field @xmath69 could be decomposed in a block @xmath136 and in a block @xmath137 . at genus zero",
    "we needed two insertions of @xmath136 , so the natural guess is that at genus @xmath138 we need @xmath135 insertions of @xmath137 .",
    "however , this is not the full story .",
    "we also need to insert @xmath139 copies of the anti - ghost and integrate over the moduli space of riemann surfaces to properly define a topological string theory .",
    "the anti - ghost is very close to @xmath99 , and the fusion rules of the tri - critical ising model tell us that there is indeed a non - vanishing contribution to correlation functions of @xmath135 @xmath137 s and @xmath139 @xmath99 .",
    "this prescription would therefore work very nicely if we would have found the right anti - ghost .",
    "the candidates we tried so far all seem to fail in one way or another .",
    "one possible conclusion might be that a twisted stress tensor does not exist and that there is only a sensible notion of topological @xmath0 sigma models but not of topological @xmath0 strings .",
    "the fact that so far so many properties of the @xmath93 topological theories appeared to hold also in our @xmath0 model leads us to believe that a sensible extension to higher genera indeed exists . identifying the correct twisted stress tensor remains an open problem . barring this important omission the coupling to topological",
    "gravity goes pretty much along the same lines as for the @xmath44 topological string ( details can be found in @xcite ) .",
    "an important application of topological strings stems from the realization @xcite that its amplitudes agree with certain amplitudes of the physical superstring .",
    "just like @xmath93 topological strings compute certain f - terms in four dimensional @xmath93 gauge theories , one might wonder whether the @xmath0 topological string similarly computes f - terms in three dimensional @xmath93 gauge theories .    since @xmath0 manifolds are ricci - flat we can consider compactifying the type ii superstring on @xmath140 where @xmath141 is a 7 dimensional manifold of @xmath0 holonomy .",
    "this reduces the supersymmetry down to two real supercharges in 3 dimension from each worldsheet chirality so we end up with a low energy field theory in 3 dimensions with @xmath93 supergravity . by studying amplitudes in some detail",
    "we observe that , except perhaps at genus zero , the amplitudes do involve a sum over conformal blocks , and the topological @xmath0 string therefore seems to compute only one of many contributions to an amplitude .",
    "this is in contrast to the four dimensional case where the possibility to look only at the ( anti)-self dual gravitons allowed to isolate the topological contributions .",
    "nevertheless , we believe that topological @xmath0 strings are worthwhile to study .",
    "they may possibly provide a good definition of topological m - theory , and a further study may teach us many things about non - topological @xmath0 compactifications as well .",
    "we leave this , as well as the generalization to @xmath142 compactifications @xcite  and the study of branes in these theories to future work .",
