    "over the past decade , the physical characteristic of the entanglement of quantum - mechanical states , both pure and mixed , has been recognized as a central resource in various aspects of quantum information processing .",
    "significant settings include quantum communication  @xcite , cryptography  @xcite , teleportation  @xcite , and , to an extent that is not quite so clear , quantum computation  @xcite . given the central status of entanglement , the task of quantifying the degree to which a state is entangled is important for quantum information processing and , correspondingly , several measures of it have been proposed .",
    "these include : entanglement of formation  @xcite , entanglement of distillation  @xcite , relative entropy of entanglement  @xcite , negativity  @xcite , and so on .",
    "it is worth remarking that even for the smallest hilbert space capable of exhibiting entanglement , i.e. ,  the two - qubit system ( for which wootters has determined the entanglement of formation  @xcite ) , there are aspects of entanglement that remain to be explored .    among the family of mixed quantum mechanical states , special status should be accorded to those that , for a given value of the entropy  @xcite , have the largest possible degree of entanglement  @xcite .",
    "the reason for this is that such states can be regarded as mixed - state generalizations of the bell states , the latter being known to be the maximally entangled 2-qubit pure states .",
    "the notion of maximally entangled mixed states was introduced by ishizaka and hiroshima  @xcite in a closely related setting , i.e. , that of 2-qubit mixed states whose entanglement is maximized at fixed eigenvalues of the density matrix ( rather than at fixed entropy of the density matrix ) .",
    "evidently , the entanglement of the maximally entangled mixed states of ishizaka and hiroshima can not be increased by any _",
    "global _ unitary transformation . for these states , it was shown by verstraete et al .",
    "@xcite that the maximality property continues to hold if any of the following three measures of entanglement  entanglement of formation , negativity , and relative entropy of entanglement  is replaced by one of the other two .",
    "the question of the ordering of entanglement measures was raised by eisert and plenio  @xcite and investigated numerically by them and analytically by verstraete et al .",
    "it was proved by virmani and plenio  @xcite that all good asymptotic entanglement measures are either identical or fail to uniformly give consistent orderings of density matrices .",
    "this implies that the resulting maximally entangled mixed states ( mems ) may depend on the measures one uses to quantify entanglement .",
    "moreover , in finding the form of mems , one needs to quantify the _ mixedness _ of a state , and there can also be ordering problems for mixedness .",
    "this implies that the mems may depend on the measures of mixedness as well .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we begin , in secs .",
    "[ sec : mems ] and [ sec : measofmix ] , by reviewing several measures of entanglement and mixedness . in the main part of the paper , sec .",
    "[ sec : frontier ] , we consider various entanglement - versus - mixedness planes , in which entanglement and mixedness are quantified in several ways . our primary objective , then",
    ", is to determine the _ frontiers _ ,",
    "i.e. , the boundaries of the regions occupied by physically allowed states in these planes , and to identify the structure of these maximally entangled mixed states . in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclude ] we make some concluding remarks .",
    "it is well known that there are a large number of entanglement measures @xmath0 . for a state described by the density matrix",
    "@xmath1 a good entanglement measure must satisfy , at least , the following conditions  @xcite : + c1 .",
    "( a )  @xmath2 ; ( b )  @xmath3 if @xmath1 is not entangled  @xcite ; and ( c )  @xmath4",
    ". + c2 .  for any state @xmath1 and any local unitary transformation ,",
    "i.e. , a unitary transformation of the form @xmath5 , the entanglement remains unchanged .",
    "local operations , classical communication and postselection can not increase the expectation value of the entanglement .",
    "entanglement is convex under discarding information : @xmath6 .",
    "+ the entanglement quantities chosen by us satisfy the properties c1c4 . here",
    ", we do not impose the condition that any good entanglement measure should reduce to the _ entropy of entanglement _ ( to be defined in the following ) for pure states .",
    "the first measure we shall consider is the entanglement of formation @xmath7  @xcite ; it quantifies the amount of entanglement necessary to create the entangled state .",
    "it is defined by @xmath8 where the minimization is taken over those probabilities @xmath9 and pure states @xmath10 that , taken together , reproduce the density matrix @xmath11 ( usually called the _ entropy of entanglement _ ) measures the entanglement of the pure state @xmath12 and is defined to be the von neumann entropy of the reduced density matrix @xmath13 , i.e. , @xmath14    for two - qubit systems , @xmath7 can be expressed explicitly as  @xcite    @xmath15 \\right ) , \\label{eqn : wootters } \\\\",

    "@xmath21 , @xmath16 , and the _ tangle _ @xmath22 are equivalent measures of entanglement , inasmuch as they are monotonic functions of one another .",
    "a measure associated with the entanglement of formation is the entanglement cost @xmath23  @xcite which is defined via @xmath24 this is the asymptotic value of the average entanglement of formation .",
    "@xmath23 is , in general , difficult to calculate .",
    "related to the entanglement of formation is the entanglement of distillation @xmath25 @xcite , which characterizes the amount of entanglement of a state @xmath1 as the fraction of bell states that can be distilled using the optimal purification procedure : @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the number of copies of @xmath1 used and @xmath28 is the maximal number of bell states that can be distilled from them .",
    "the difference @xmath29 can be regarded as _",
    "undistillable entanglement_. @xmath25 is a difficult quantity to calculate , but the relative entropy of entanglement @xmath30  @xcite , which we shall define shortly , provides an upper bound on @xmath25 and is more readily calculable than it .",
    "for this reason , it is the second measure that we consider in this paper .",
    "it is defined variationally via @xmath31 where @xmath32 represents the ( convex ) set of all separable density operators @xmath33 . in certain ways ,",
    "the relative entropy of entanglement can be viewed as a _ distance _ @xmath34 from the entangled state @xmath1 to the closest separable state @xmath35 .",
    "we remark that for pure states of two - qubit systems the relative entropy has the same value as the entanglement of formation .",
    "the third measure that we shall consider is the _ negativity_.",
    "the concept of the negativity of a state is closely related to the well - known peres - horodecki condition for the separability of a state @xcite .",
    "if a state is separable ( i.e. , not entangled ) then the partial transpose of its density matrix is again a valid state , i.e. , it is positive semi - definite .",
    "it turns out that the partial transpose of a non - separable state has one or more negative eigenvalues .",
    "the negativity of a state @xcite indicates the extent to which a state violates the positive partial transpose separability criterion .",
    "we will adopt the definition of negativity as twice the absolute value of the sum of the negative eigenvalues : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the sum of the negative eigenvalues of @xmath38 .",
    "in @xmath39 ( i.e. , two - qbit ) systems it can be shown that the partial transpose of the density matrix can have at most one negative eigenvalue ( see app .",
    "[ app : oneneg ] ) .",
    "it was proved by vidal and werner  @xcite that negativity is an entanglement _ monotone _ , i.e. , it satisfies criteria c1c4 and , hence , is a good entanglement measure .",
    "we remark that for two - qubit pure states the negativity gives the same value as the concurrence does .",
    "the bures metric of entanglement is defined as @xmath40where @xmath41 is the _",
    "fidelity_. in the same way that relative entropy can , this entanglement measure can be viewed as the distance from the closest separable state to the entangled state considered , where the distance is now defined by @xmath42  @xcite .",
    "we remark that for two - qubit pure states the bures metric reduces to the tangle defined in sec .",
    "[ sec : ef ] .",
    "it was shown by lewenstein and sanpera  @xcite that any density matrix @xmath1 has a decomposition into two parts : @xmath43 where @xmath44 is separable , @xmath45 is entangled , and the weight @xmath46 is maximal , in which case the decomposition is unique .",
    "they refer to @xmath44 as the _ best separable approximation _ ( bsa ) to @xmath1 .",
    "it should be pointed out that , in general , it is nontrivial to establish the decomposition , even in the simplest relevant setting of @xmath39 systems",
    ". evidently , @xmath46 and @xmath45 contain information about the entanglement of @xmath1 .",
    "karnas and lewenstein  @xcite later showed that the quantity @xmath47 , which we will call _ the ls entanglement _ , satifies the above criteria , and hence is a good entanglement measure . for @xmath39 systems it turns out that @xmath48 is a pure state , i.e. , @xmath49 , and in this case it suggests that the quantity @xmath50 , defined via @xmath51 may also be a good entanglement measure .",
    "we remark that the for two - qubit case the entanglement measure ( @xmath52 ) is known to be equal to the schmidt measure introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite .    even though the ls decomposition is not , in general , straightforward to find for the states in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : ansatz ] ) , the ls decomposition reads @xmath53 where @xmath54 ( with @xmath55 ) , @xmath56 , and we consider only @xmath57 ( as for @xmath58 the whole density matrix is separable ) .    if we compute the concurrence of the state in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : ansatz ] ) , we find @xmath59 .",
    "it is interesting to note that the ls entanglement gives , for the ansatz states in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : ansatz ] ) , the same value as the concurrence does ; but for an arbitrary state this is not , in general , true  @xcite .",
    "we now pause to touch on certain difficulties posed by the task of ordering physical states using entanglement . as first discussed and explored numerically by eisert and plenio  @xcite , and subsequently investigated analytically by verstraete et al .",
    "@xcite , different entanglement measures can give different orderings for pairs of mixed states .",
    "this can be seen , e.g. , from the plot of concurrence versus negativity , fig .",
    "[ fig : cvsn ] .",
    "the upper boundary is readily seen to be @xmath60 whereas the lower boundary can be derived , giving @xmath61 ; see ref .",
    "@xcite .    hence , when we wish to explain maximally entangled mixed states we need to be very explicit about the measure of entanglement ( and also mixedness",
    "; see the following section ) .",
    "different measures are likely to lead to different classes of mems states .",
    "we end this section by mentioning the three entanglement measures that we shall use to compute the entanglement - mixedness frontiers : entanglement of formation , negativity , and relative entropy of entanglement .",
    "the first two of these are straightforward to compute , at least in two - qubit settings . for the third ,",
    "certain results are available  @xcite that ease the computation of mems .",
    "we have also reviewed four additional measures ( entanglement cost , entanglement of distillation , ls entanglement , and the bures metric ) .",
    "of these , however , the first two are rather difficult to compute , let alone maximize ; the third is also difficult to compute , at least in practice . as for the fourth , calculating the entanglement involves finding the closest separable states ( as is required for the case of relative entropy ) .",
    "in the entanglement - measure literature , two measures of mixedness have basically been used : @xmath62\\big)$ ] and the von neumann entropy . whereas the latter has an natural significance stemming from its connections with statistical physics and information theory ,",
    "the former is substantially easier to calculate .",
    "of course , for density matrices that are almost completely mixed , the two measures show the same trend .",
    "the von neumann entropy , the standard measure of randomness of a statistical ensemble described by a density matrix , is defined by @xmath63 where @xmath64 are the eigenvalues of the density matrix @xmath1 and the @xmath65 is taken to base @xmath66 , the dimension of the hilbert space in question .",
    "it is straightforward to show that the extremal values of @xmath67 are zero ( for pure states ) and unity ( for completely mixed states ) . to compute the von neumann",
    "entropy it is necessary to have the full knowledge of the eigenvalue spectrum .",
    "as we shall mention in the following subsection , there is a linear entropy threshold above which all states are separable .",
    "qualitatively identical behavior is encountered for the von neumann entropy . in particular , as we shall see in sec .",
    "[ sec : efsv ] , for two - qubit systems all states are separable for @xmath68 .",
    "the second measure that we shall consider is called the _ linear entropy _ and is based on the purity of a state , @xmath69 $ ] , which ranges from 1 ( for a pure state ) to @xmath70 for a completely mixed state with dimension @xmath66 .",
    "the linear entropy @xmath71 is defined via @xmath72 ) ,   \\label{eqn : linearentropy}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which ranges from 0 ( for a pure state ) to 1 ( for a maximally mixed state ) .",
    "the linear entropy is generally a simpler quantity to calculate than the von neumann entropy as there is no need for diagonalization . for @xmath39 systems",
    "the linear entropy can be written explicity as @xmath73).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    a related measure , which we shall not use in this paper ( but mention for the sake of completeness ) , is _ the inverse participation ratio_. defined via @xmath74 $ ] , it ranges from @xmath75 ( for a pure state ) to @xmath66 ( for the maximally mixed state ) .",
    "an attractive property of the inverse participation ratio is that all states with @xmath76 are separable  @xcite , which implies all states with a linear entropy @xmath77 ( which is @xmath78 when @xmath79 ) are separable .",
    "the aim of this subsection is to illustrate the difference between the linear and von neumann entropies .",
    "we shall do this by considering the @xmath79 hilbert space , and seeking the highest and lowest von neumann entropies consistent with a given value of linear entropy . before restricting @xmath66 to 4",
    ", the corresponding stationarity problem reads : @xmath80 where @xmath81 and @xmath82 are , respectively , langrange multipliers that enforce the constraints that linear entropy be fixed and that @xmath1 be normalized .",
    "thus , we arrive at the engaging self - consistency condition @xmath83 in which @xmath82 and @xmath81 can be fixed upon implementing the constraints .    by hypothesizing certain relationships among the eigenvalues of the density matrix , we have been able , for the case of @xmath79 , to find certain solutions of the self - consistency condition and , hence , a candidate for the boundary of the region of @xmath71 vs.  @xmath67 plane ( see fig .  [ fig : svsl ] ) corresponding to legitimate density matrices . these solutions , when given in terms of eigenvalues , read    @xmath84    [ eqn : svslsolutions ]    and they correspond to the upper boundary , and the lowest , middle , and highest pieces of the lower boundary , respectively .",
    "note that the lower boundary comprises three ( in general , @xmath85 ) segments that meet at cusps .",
    "we remark , parenthetically , that the solutions with zero eigenvalues correspond to extrema within some subspace spanned by those eigenvectors with nonzero eigenvalues , and therefore only obey the stationarity condition  ( [ eqn : stationarity ] ) within the subspace .",
    "is there any significance to the boundary states ?",
    "boundary segment  ( a ) includes the werner states defined in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : werner ] ) .",
    "boundary segment  ( b ) includes the first branch of the mems for @xmath7 and @xmath71 specified below in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : mems ] ) .",
    "the segment  ( c ) includes the states @xmath86states on segment  ( d ) are all unentangled .",
    "of course , the boundary segments include not only the specified states but also all states derivable from them by global unitary transformation .    as for the interior",
    ", we have obtained this numerically by constructing a large number of random sets of eigenvalues of legitimate density matrices , and computing for each the two entropies . as fig .",
    "[ fig : svsl ] shows , no points lie outside the boundary curve , providing confirmatory evidence for the forms given in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : svslsolutions ] ) .",
    "the fact that the bounded region is two - dimensional indicates the lack of precision with which the linear entropy characterizes the von neumann entropy ( and vice versa , if one wishes ) .",
    "in particular , the figure reveals an ordering difficulty : pairs of states , @xmath87 and @xmath88 , exist for which @xmath89 and @xmath90 differ in sign .",
    "worse still , states having a common value of @xmath67 have a continuum of values of @xmath71 , and vice versa .",
    "we now attempt to identify regions in the plane spanned by entanglement and mixedness that are inhabited by physical states ( i.e. , characterized by legitimate density matrices ) .",
    "we shall consider the various measures of entanglement and mixedness discussed in the previous section .",
    "of particular interest will be the structure of the states that inhabit the _ frontier _ , i.e. , the boundary delimiting the region of physical states .",
    "frontier states are maximal in the following sense : for a given value of mixedness they are maximally entangled ; for a given value of entanglement they are maximally mixed .",
    "the aim of this subsection is to derive the general form of the maximal states given in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : rhomems ] ) , which is what we will use to parametrize maximal states . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is shown that , given a fixed set of eigenvalues , all states that maximize one of the three entanglement measures ( entanglement of formation , negativity or relative entropy ) automatically maximize the other two .",
    "it was further shown that the global unitary transformation that takes arbitrary states into maximal ones has the form @xmath91 where @xmath92 and @xmath93 are arbitary local unitary transformations , @xmath94 @xmath95 is a unitary diagonal matrix , and @xmath96 is the unitary matrix that diagonalizes the density matrix @xmath1 , i.e. , @xmath97 , where @xmath98 is a diagonal matrix , the diagonal elements of which are the four eigenvalues of @xmath1 listed in nonincreasing order ( @xmath99 ) .",
    "hence , the general form of a density matrix that is maximal , given a set of eigenvalues , is ( up to local unitary transformations ) @xmath100 this matrix is locally equivalent to the form @xmath101with @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 , and @xmath105 .",
    "the above derivation justifies the ansatz form  ( [ eqn : ansatz ] ) used in ref .",
    "@xcite to derive the entanglement of formation vs.  linear entropy mems .",
    "we remark that one may as well use the four eigenvalues @xmath64 s as the parametrization .",
    "nevertheless , the form  ( [ eqn : rhomems ] ) , as well as ( [ eqn : ansatz ] ) , can be nicely viewed as a mixture of a bell state @xmath106 with some diagonal separable mixed state .",
    "we begin by measuring mixedness in terms of the linear entropy , and comparing the frontier states for various measures of entanglement .",
    "the characterization of physical states in terms of their entanglement of formation and linear entropy was introduced by munro et al .  in ref .",
    "( strictly speaking , they considered the tangle rather than the equivalent entanglement of formation . )   here , we shall consider yet another equivalent quantity : concurrence ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : ef ] ) . in order to find the frontier , munro et al .  proposed ansatz states of the form @xmath107 where @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "they found that , of these , the subset    @xmath110    [ eqn : mems ]    lies on the boundary in the tangle vs.  linear - entropy plane and , accordingly , named these mems , in the sense that these states have maximal tangle for a given linear entropy .",
    "we remark that at the crossing point of the two branches , @xmath111 , the density matrices on either side coincide .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : csl ] we plot the entanglement of formation / concurrence vs.  linear entropy for the family of mems  ( [ eqn : mems ] ) ; this gives the frontier curve .",
    "for the sake of comparison , we also give the curve associated with the family of werner states of the form @xmath112 evidently , for a given value of linear entropy these mems ( which we shall denote by @xmath113 ) achieve the highest concurrence . as the tangle @xmath114 and entanglement of formation @xmath7 are monotonic functions of the concurrence , eq .",
    "( [ eqn : mems ] ) also gives the boundary curve for these measures .",
    "this raises an interesting question : is ( [ eqn : mems ] ) optimal for other measures of entanglement ?      to find the frontier states for the relative entropy of entanglement we again turn our attention to the maximal density matrix ( [ eqn : rhomems ] ) . for this form of density matrix",
    "the linear entropy is given ( with @xmath115 expressed in terms of @xmath116 ) by @xmath117 to calculate the relative entropy of entanglement , we need to determine the closest separable state to ( [ eqn : rhomems ] ) .",

    "[ fig : nsl ] , and compelling evidence for the maximality of the negativity is furnished by the fact that no points lie beyond the frontier .",

    "( [ eqn : mems ] ) . here , we see that maximally entangled mixed states change their form when we adopt a different entanglement measure .",
    "we continue this section by choosing to measure mixedness in terms of the von neumann entropy , and comparing the frontier states for various measures of entanglement .      to find this frontier , we consider states of the form  ( [ eqn : rhomems ] ) , and compute for them the concurrence and the von neumann entropy :    @xmath169    [ eqn : cnsv ]    note that the parameters obey the normalization constraint @xmath170 .",
    "as we remarked previously , the rank  2 mems is always a candidate . for the rank-3 case , we can set @xmath118 in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : cnsv ] ) . by maximizing @xmath149 at fixed @xmath67",
    ", we find a stationary solution : + ( i )  @xmath171 , @xmath172 , and @xmath173 ; the resulting density matrix is @xmath174for the rank-4 case ( @xmath175 ) , the stationarity condition can be shown to be    @xmath176    where @xmath177 , @xmath178 , and @xmath179 .",
    "there are two solutions , due to the two - to - one property of the function @xmath180 for @xmath181 .",
    "the first one is ( @xmath182 ) .",
    "+ ( ii )  @xmath183 , and @xmath184 , which can readily be seen to be a werner state as in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : werner ] ) or , equivalently , @xmath185being the concurrence , @xmath149 is restricted to the interval @xmath186 $ ] .",
    "the second solution is transcendental , but can be solved numerically .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : csv ] we compare the four possible candidate solutions , and find that the global maximum is composed of only ( i ) and  ( ii ) .",
    "we summarize the states at the frontier as follows : @xmath187 note the crossing point at @xmath188 , at which extremality is exchanged , so the true frontier consists of two branches .",
    "it is readily seen that @xmath189 is the solution of the equation @xmath190 , and the approximate numerical values of @xmath189 and the corresponding @xmath191 are @xmath192 and @xmath193 , respectively .",
    "the resulting form of mems states is peculiar , in that , even at the crossing point of two branches on the entanglement - mixedness plane , the forms of matrices on the two branches are not equivalent ( one is rank  3 , the other rank  4 ) .",
    "this is in contrast to the @xmath113 .",
    "this peculiarity can be partially understood from the plot of the two mixedness measures , fig .",
    "[ fig : svsl ] : as the value of the von neumann entropy rises , there are fewer and fewer rank-3 entangled states , and above some threshold , no more rank-3 states exist , let alone entangled rank-3 states .",
    "there are , however , still entangled states of rank 4 .",
    "hence , if rank-3 states attain higher entanglement than rank-4 states do when the entropy is low , a transition must occur between mems states of rank  3 and rank  4 .    from fig .",
    "[ fig : csv ] it is evident that beyond a certain value of the von neumann entropy no entangled states exist .",
    "this value can be readily obtained by considering the mems state  ( [ eqn : rhoii ] ) at @xmath194 , @xmath195for which @xmath196 .    as an aside",
    ", we mention a tantalizing but not yet fully developed analogy with thermodynamics  @xcite . in this analogy ,",
    "one associates entanglement with energy and von neumann entropy with entropy , and it is therefore tempting to regard the mems just derived as the analog of thermodynamic equilibrium states .",
    "if we apply the jaynes principle to an ensemble in equilibrium with a given amount of entanglement then the most probable states are those mems shown above .",
    "let us now find the frontier states for the case of relative entropy of entanglement . to do this",
    ", we first consider the rank-3 states in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : rank2n3 ] ) , for which the relative entropy is given by eq .",
    "( [ eqn : er3 ] ) . for these states ,",
    "the von neumann entropy is given by @xmath197 where the @xmath65 function is taken to be base four . even though the @xmath65 functions in @xmath67 and @xmath30 use different bases , the stationary condition for the parameters @xmath121 and @xmath120 does not change , because the difference can be absorbed by a rescaling of the constraint - enforcing lagrange multiplier .",
    "thus , in maximizing @xmath30 at fixed @xmath67 , we arrive at the stationarity condition @xmath198 we can solve for the parameter @xmath120 as a function of @xmath199 $ ] , at least numerically ; the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : asverofr ] , along with @xmath67 and @xmath30 .    turning to the rank-4 case , it is straightforward , if tedious , to show that the werner states satisfy the corresponding stationarity conditions . in order to ascertain",
    "which rank gives the mems for a given @xmath67 , we compare the stationary states of rank 2 , 3 , and 4 in fig .",
    "[ fig : resv ] .",
    "thus , we see that for @xmath200 the frontier states are given by the rank-3 states , whereas for @xmath201 the frontier states are given by the werner states  ( [ eqn : werner ] ) with the parameter @xmath121 ranging from approximately 0.6059 down to 0 . at the crossing point , @xmath202 , the mems undergo a discontinuous transition ; recall that we encountered a similar phenomenon in the case of entanglement of formation vs.  von neumann entropy .",
    "we saw in sec .",
    "[ sec : nsl ] that there is a pair of families of mems which differ in rank but give the identical frontier in the @xmath159 vs.  @xmath71 plane .",
    "it is interesting to see what happens for the combination of negativity and von neumann entropy .",
    "once again , we begin with states of form  ( [ eqn : rhomems ] ) , for which the negativity and the von neumann entropy are given in eqs .",
    "( [ eqn : negativity ] ) and  ( [ eqn : s_v ] ) , respectively . by making @xmath159 stationary at fixed @xmath67",
    ", we are able to find only one solution ( in addition to the rank-2 candidate ) : @xmath203 . expressing the resulting density matrix , as we may , in terms of the single parameter @xmath121",
    ", we arrive at the following candidate for the frontier states : @xmath204 where @xmath205 , i.e. , the werner states .    the resulting frontier in the negativity vs.  von - neumann - entropy plane is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : nsv ] which , for comparison , also shows the curve for the rank-2 candidate .",
    "in this paper we have determined families of maximally entangled mixed states ( mems , i.e. , frontier states , which possess the maximum amount of entanglement for a given degree of mixedness ) . these states may be useful in quantum information processing in the presence of noise , as they have the maximum amount of entanglement possible for a given mixedness .",
    "we considered various measures of entanglement ( entanglement of formation , relative entropy , and negativity ) and mixedness ( linear entropy and von neumann entropy ) .",
    "we found that the form of the mems depends heavily on the measures used .",
    "certain classes of frontier states ( such as those arising with either entanglement of formation or relative entropy of entanglement vs.  the von neumann entropy ) behave discontinously at a specific point on the entanglement - mixedness frontier . under most of the settings considered ,",
    "we have been able to explicitly derive analytical forms for the frontier states .    for entanglement of formation and relative entropyand for most values of mixedness",
    ", we have found that the rank-2 and rank-3 mems have more entanglement than werner states do . on the other hand , at fixed entropy no states have higher negativity than werner states do . at small amounts of mixedness , the @xmath113 states lose  entanglement with increasing mixedness at a substantially lower rate than do the werner states .",
    "however , when the entanglement is measured by the relative entropy , the difference in loss - rate is significantly smaller .    from eq .",
    "( [ eqn : lsdecomp ] ) it is tempting to assert that in the case of ls entanglement vs.  mixedness the frontier states should be the same as those in the case of entanglement of formation vs.  mixedness .",
    "however , as we do not know whether eq .",
    "( [ eqn : ansatz ] ) ( up to local unitary transformations ) exhausts all maximal states for ls entanglement , further investigation of this point is needed .",
    "having characterized the mems for various measures , it is worthwhile considering them from the perspective of bell - inequality violations . to quantify the violation of bell s inequality",
    ", it is useful to consider the quantity @xmath206 where @xmath207 and the vectors @xmath208 and @xmath209 ( @xmath210 and @xmath211 ) are two different measuring apparatus settings for observer a ( observer b ) . if @xmath212 then the corresponding state violates bell s inequality . for the density matrix of the form  ( [ eqn : rhomems ] ) it is straightforward  @xcite to show that the quantity @xmath88 is given by @xmath213 in fig .  [ fig : bell ] , we plot @xmath88 vs.  linear and von neumann entropies for several families of frontier states . as a comparison",
    ", we also draw the violation by the following rank-2 state ( which is diagonal in the bell basis ) : @xmath214.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this state , although not belonging to any of the families of frontier states derived previously , turns out to achieve the maximum possible violation , as a function of linear entropy . on the other hand ,",
    "the werner states appear to achieve maximal violation in the case of von neumann entropy .",
    "ekert s application of bell s inequalities to quantum cryptography  @xcite , together with the discussions of the present paragraph , suggests that mems may be relevant to quantum communication .",
    "another natural application for which entanglement is known to be a critical resource is quantum teleportation .",
    "how do these frontier mems teleport , compared with the werner and rank-2 bell diagonal states ?",
    "if we restrict our attention to high purity situations ( i.e. , to states with only a small amount of mixedness ) then it is straightforward to show that , e.g. , @xmath113 states teleport average states better than the werner states do , but worse than the rank-2 bell diagonal state does .",
    "part of the explanation for this behavior is that standard teleportation is optimized for using bell states as its core resource .",
    "it is also interesting to note that for certain combinations of entanglement and mixedness measures , as well as the bell inequality violation , the rank-2 candidates fail to furnish mems .",
    "thus , these states seem to be less useful than other mems .",
    "however , from the perspective of distillation , these states are exactly quasi - distillable  @xcite , and can be useful in the presence of noise because they can be easily distilled into bell states .",

    "in this appendix we address the result that for @xmath39 systems the partial transpose of any density matrix @xmath1 has at most one negative eigenvalue .",
    "in fact , we shall consider the result from two perspectives .",
    "first , we build upon results ( theorem 3 , in particular ) contained in ref .",
    "@xcite , from which it follows that it is sufficient to consider ( i )  bell diagonal states and ( ii )  states of the form @xmath215 for the latter case , straightforward calculation shows that the partially transposed matrix can have one negative eigenvalue when @xmath216 and that it does not have negative eigenvalues when @xmath217 . for the former case , suppose that the bell diagonal state has the four eigenvalues @xmath218 , @xmath219 , @xmath220 , @xmath221 , in nonincreasing order .",
    "then it is straightforward to see that the corresponding partially transposed matrix has the four eigenvalues @xmath222 , @xmath223 , @xmath224 , @xmath225 .",
    "thus , it can have at most one negative eigenvalue .    a second perspective is provided by first invoking the ls decomposition  ( [ eqn : lsdec ] ) and then making a schmidt decomposition , via the local unitary transformation @xmath226 , of the pure entangled part @xmath227 . in this way ,",
    "the pure part becomes @xmath228 where @xmath229 .",
    "meanwhile , @xmath1 is transformed into @xmath230 where @xmath231 is still separable , and its partial transpose remains positive semi - definite .",
    "taking , then , the partial transpose , the density matrix is transformed into @xmath232 and we note that the last matrix has eigenvalues @xmath233 , @xmath234 , @xmath235 , @xmath236 in ( as @xmath237 ) nonincreasing order . as the hermitian matrix @xmath238 retains positive - semi - definiteness , we can employ a well - known result in matrix analysis  @xcite that for @xmath239 hermitian matrices @xmath87 and @xmath88 , with @xmath88 being positive semi - definite , the eigenvalues of @xmath240 and @xmath87 , when arranged in non - ascending order , obey @xmath241 hence , identifying @xmath88 with @xmath242 and @xmath87 with the product of @xmath243 and the matrix in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : rhotb ] ) , we immediately see that @xmath244 and , thus , @xmath245 ( or equivalently @xmath246 ) can have at most one negative eigenvalue .",
    "thus , the negativity for @xmath39 systems can then be written as @xmath247 .",
