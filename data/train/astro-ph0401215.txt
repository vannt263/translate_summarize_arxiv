    "understanding the evolution , star - formation and assembly histories of early type galaxies up to their highest redshifts of formation is a crucial observational question that remains unsolved . passively evolving",
    ", massive spheroidal galaxies appear to be common up to @xmath5 with little evolution , if any , from present days @xcite .",
    "it is not well constrained yet if and how many passive spheroids exist at higher redshifts , @xmath62 .",
    "moreover , it is unclear up to what redshift most precursors of spheroids maintain the low - redshift signatures of morphological and stellar population properties . approaching their formation epoch",
    ", spheroid progenitors will appear as star - forming and possibly morphologically irregular galaxies .",
    "therefore , identifying the precursors of todays ellipticals close to their most interesting formation or assembly phases requires to rely on independent and alternative signatures than their morphologies or old stellar population properties .",
    "( heavy symbols ) , we show relevant measurements taken from the literature : ellipticals at @xmath7 from @xcite , optically selected galaxies at @xmath8 from @xcite , eros and radio galaxies at @xmath2 from @xcite , @xmath1 lbgs from @xcite and @xmath95 lbgs from @xcite ]    spheroids inhabit preferentially the densest environment in the local universe .",
    "they have the largest correlation lengths among galaxies in the present day universe and up to @xmath2 @xcite . _",
    "searching for the most clustered population at any redshift is therefore a natural way to locate such progenitors and to investigate their properties .",
    "_    this view is supported by model predictions for the redshift evolution of the correlation length of halos hosting today massive ellipticals ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , based on @xcite ) .",
    "halos clustered with @xmath1010 in the local universe , are predicted to have @xmath118 1 mpc even at @xmath12 .",
    "being referred to halos , these predictions could represent only lower limits for galaxies that , at the relatively small scales probed by high-@xmath0 measurements , can have enhanced correlations due to large halo occupation numbers ( e.g. ) .    in practice , it is impossible to observationally preselect a population by its clustering properties and one has to look at the clustering properties of the available classes of high-@xmath0 galaxies to find putative progenitors .",
    "extremely red objects ( eros ) and giant @xmath2 radio galaxies , as well known , have an high clustering and therefore are good candidate progenitors of local ellipticals @xcite , in agreement with some significant fraction of these objects being passive spheroids ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "measurements for the highest redshifts ( @xmath135 ) star - forming galaxies @xcite of @xmath146 may be consistent with the predictions for forming spheroids .",
    "this is also in qualitative agreement with the observation that the oldest stars ( thus the ones formed at the highest redshifts ) are nowadays in spheroids .",
    "typical @xmath1 lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) appear instead to start falling short of the expected clustering level of ellipticals progenitors , with the best current estimates of @xmath15 1 mpc @xcite and with fainter lbgs having even much weaker clustering @xcite .",
    "in fact the clustering of observed lbgs at @xmath1 is much lower than that of @xmath2 eros , suggesting that possibly a large fraction of them do not evolve into eros and ellipticals .",
    "overall , the observed clustering of optically selected ( i.e. actively star forming ) galaxies from @xmath16 to @xmath17 @xcite is in very good agreement with the model predictions of @xcite .",
    "the comparison of the two set of predictions of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , diverging below @xmath13 , also confirm that by @xmath18 ordinary star formation has began producing stars that have mainly ended in today later type or less massive galaxies .",
    "should it be possible to isolate the progenitors of local spheroids as a class of galaxies at @xmath19 , their clustering would be expected to be fairly strong , in the cited range @xmath148 1 mpc or even more .",
    "new populations of k - selected , @xmath43 galaxies possibly satisfying those clustering requirements were recently reported by the fires and k20 surveys @xcite . along with scuba sources ,",
    "these galaxy populations represent the best candidates so far identified for the precursors of massive spheroids .",
    "the fires survey of the hdf - south @xcite has produced the first large sample of about 120 @xmath21-selected galaxies in the ( photometric ) redshift range @xmath12 . from the analysis of their correlation properties",
    "@xcite , these @xmath1 k - selected galaxies appear more strongly clustered than lbgs ( at a fixed number density ) , although the comparison suffers from the small area of hdfs .",
    "a significant result was the detection in the fires sample of a strong color dependence of clustering , in the usual way that redder galaxies appear more clustered ( but a previously unobserved effect at any @xmath22 ) .",
    "the clustering depends primarily on the @xmath20 color , which brackets the balmer ( or 4000 ) break at @xmath23 , suggesting the effect could be due to age .",
    "intriguingly , the existence of populations older and more clustered than lbgs could solve the paradox that @xmath1 lbgs are too young to be direct progeny of @xmath246 star forming galaxies @xcite .",
    "the galaxies with the reddest ( @xmath25 ) colors at @xmath23 have an angular two - point correlation function consistent with @xmath26 1 mpc ( using a typical slope @xmath27 ) , although a weaker @xmath28 1 mpc could be made consistent with the data assuming enhanced small scale correlations in the `` halo occupation distribution '' framework @xcite .",
    "overall , these clustering strengths of 58 1 mpc are at the level expected for the progenitors of ellipticals seen at @xmath29 ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the first handful spectroscopic redshifts for this class of @xmath20 red galaxies @xcite are grouped in a single redshift spike , a feature that support the presence of strong clustering .",
    "k - selected galaxies ( top , from @xcite ) is compared to the reddest and bluest composite spectrum of lbgs ( center and bottom , from @xcite ) .",
    "the strong ly@xmath30 emission is from the bluest lbg spectrum . ]",
    "the k20 survey resulted in the observation of a significant high redshift tail of @xmath31 galaxies with bright near - ir magnitudes ( @xmath32 , @xcite ) .",
    "the vast majority of such galaxies appear to be actively star - forming , reddened , morphologically irregular and massive objects @xcite .",
    "remarkably , 6 out of the 9 galaxies with measured spectroscopic redshift belong to spikes with @xmath33 km / s of redshift separation . assuming a random redshift selection function within the @xmath31 range such a level of pairing has a probability of about @xmath34 , a clear evidence of clustering .",
    "it is intriguing that even for eros a similarly strong level of redshift pairing is not observed .",
    "we performed monte carlo simulations building samples of clustered populations ( using the method presented in @xcite ) in order to see what correlation length is necessary to produce a similar redshift pairing in our small sample .",
    "it is found that in order to have a 5% or more probability to find as many pairs as in the observed sample , @xmath35 1 mpc is required . the fraction of close pairs in a survey is directly related to the integral of the real space two - point correlation function , and has little dependence on the correlation slope @xmath36 .",
    "the pairing evidence thus suggest that these near - ir bright @xmath4 galaxies are consistent with having a high - level of clustering , like the one expected for the progenitors of local ellipticals seen at @xmath4",
    ". it would be extremely interesting to spectroscopically confirm a much larger samples , in order to obtain improved estimates for the clustering of this galaxy population .",
    "galaxies at @xmath4 with bright k - band magnitudes were unknown before @xcite and @xcite , and actually most theoretical models had predicted that they should not exist at all ( see e.g. @xcite for relative references ) . as they appear to be actively star - forming , just like lbgs , it is interesting to assess whether these k - selected galaxies are just a special subsample ( the brightest tip of the iceberg ) of lbgs , or a different population .",
    "this is especially important as now large samples of @xmath39 lbgs have been assembled down to @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "[ fig3 ] shows that the coadded spectrum of @xmath41 k - selected galaxies is remarkably redder than typical lbgs at @xmath1 , even for the reddest among them . for a more direct comparison to lbgs",
    ", we used the available multicolor photometry in the cdfs / goods area to determine the synthetic _",
    "g _ and _ r _ magnitudes of our 9 @xmath41 objects , matching the @xmath41 selection criterion of @xcite ( the available u - band data closely match the system of @xcite ) .",
    "although the procedure is a bit uncertain , the _ g_@xmath42_r _ colors of near - ir bright @xmath4 objects appear again generally much redder than what required by the lbg selection criterion in the same redshift range @xcite .",
    "these near - ir bright @xmath41 galaxies are thus a new population of high-@xmath0 galaxies , that can not be selected with the usual lbg criterion .",
    "as they are only @xmath43% of the population in a k - limited sample at @xmath44 , it would be very useful to have an alternative method to distinguish them from lower redshift field galaxies .",
    "using the highly complete spectroscopic sample of the k20 survey we have calibrated a very efficient two color criterion : galaxies with @xmath45 have an high probability to be star - forming objects at @xmath462.5 ( fig .  [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "we are currently using this _ bzk _ criterion to build up a much larger sample of spectroscopically identified near - ir bright @xmath41 galaxies .",
    "this will be crucial in order to understand their properties and the role played in the formation history of galaxies and to confirm their nature of possible star forming progenitors of local spheroids .",
