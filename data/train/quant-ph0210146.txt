    "the various quantum - state reconstruction techniques developed during recent years have made it possible to completely reconstruct an unknown state of a quantum mechanical system provided that many identical copies of the state are available .",
    "these reconstruction methods are nowadays routinely applied to the evaluation of the experiments where quantum states are generated , manipulated and transmitted .",

    "an estimation method based on statistical maximum - likelihood principle has been devised for the reconstruction of a generic quantum state .",
    "this approach guarantees the positive semidefiniteness and trace normalization of the reconstructed density matrix .",
    "these necessary conditions are incorporated as constraints , so as a certain prior information from the statistical point of view .",
    "remarkably , the maximum likelihood estimation can be interpreted as a genuine generalized quantum measurement @xcite and can be related to the information gained by optimal measurement and the fisher information @xcite .",
    "given current interest in the quantum - information processing , it is of paramount importance to reconstruct not only the quantum states but also the transformations of these states  the quantum mechanical processes .",
    "the examination of quantum communication channels and the evaluation of the performance of quantum gates are the examples of practical applicability of quantum - process reconstruction .",
    "all necessary properties of the deterministic quantum transformations , namely the complete positivity and trace preservation can be again incorporated within the maximum - likelihood approach as the appropriate constraints @xcite .",
    "compared with other reconstruction methods the maximum - likelihood approach seems to be computationally more difficult .",
    "therefore several simplifications and approximations of the maximum - likelihood technique have been suggested recently @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we present a unified approach to the maximum - likelihood reconstruction of quantum states and quantum processes .",
    "extremal equations for the reconstructed quantum state and for quantum process are derived in section ii .",
