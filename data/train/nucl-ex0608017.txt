    "in this paper , i will present an overview of recent results on strangeness production from the star collaboration at rhic .",
    "the data will be split into two main sections , the first part details data at low p@xmath0 , which drives the bulk observables ( such as integrated yields and elliptic flow ) .",
    "the second part of this paper discusses strangeness production mechanisms at intermediate p@xmath0 in the form of yields , ratios and two - particle azimuthal correlations .",
    "due to the high statistics data - sets available at rhic , star has collected a large body of data on strange particles . using this data",
    ", we can compare many observables as a function of system size and energy .",
    "figure [ fig : ratios ] shows one such observable , the evolution of the strange anti - baryon / baryon ratios as a function of energy in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "it is evident that the evolution of the ratios is smooth with energy , over almost two orders of magnitude .",
    "this in turn is a reflection of the fact that there is a smooth change in the net - baryon density at mid - rapidity in the collision , going from near - zero at the top rhic energies to large net - baryon densities at sps energies .",
    "the ratios also exhibit an ordering with strangeness content ( where @xmath1/@xmath2 ) .",
    "this is as expected as neither the @xmath3 nor the @xmath1 share a valence quark with the incoming nucleons and so are not as affected by the net - baryon density as is the @xmath4",
    ".          one of the original proposed signatures of de - confinement was that of an enhancement of the production of strange particles in heavy - ion collisions relative to more elementary systems  @xcite .",
    "this enhancement is due to a lower threshold energy for producing strangeness in a de - confined medium ( twice the strange quark mass ) , together with the extra gluonic channels available for strange quark production .",
    "the enhancement is expected to be smaller for collisions at larger @xmath5 and should be greater for particles containing more ( anti)strange quarks .    figure [ fig : enhancecomp]a shows the enhancement of strange baryons and anti - baryons as a function of centrality as measured by star for au+au collisions at @xmath6 = 200 gev and by na57 for pb+pb collisions at @xmath6 = 17.3 gev  @xcite .",
    "the enhancement of the star data is relative to p+p collisions , whilst the na57 data is relative to p+be collisions .",
    "the enhancement of the @xmath7 from star is shown here for the first time .",
    "it is immediately obvious that there is very little difference between the two systems ( apart from the case of the @xmath4 ) .",
    "this is also the same for lower energy sps data which is in contradiction to the energy dependence which was predicted  @xcite .",
    "any difference arising from comparison to p+be collisions instead of p+p collisions has been shown to be negligible  @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : enhancecomp]b shows the star enhancement data only , overlaid with three theory curves  @xcite .",
    "these curves represent the evolution with collision participants ( @xmath8 ) of the expected enhancement factors assuming that a chemical freeze - out of 165 mev is applicable at all times and in all systems .",
    "the model incorrectly assumes a zero net - baryon density , which is why there is no difference in the curves for both particles and anti - particles .",
    "the volume is calculated as : v = a@xmath9v@xmath10 , where a = n@xmath11/2 and v@xmath10 = 4/3.@xmath12r@xmath13 , where r is the radius of the proton . as indicated on the figure",
    ", the three curves correspond to values of @xmath14 of 1 , 2/3 and 1/3 respectively .",
    "the curve which fits the shape of the data the best is for the case of @xmath14 = 1/3 .",
    "this can be thought of as representing the path length which the participant nucleon  sees \" in the colliding nucleus . in the case of the @xmath15",
    ", the line goes through all the data points whereas for the @xmath4 , it has the correct shape but the wrong magnitude , indicating , perhaps , that different particles have different freeze - out temperatures .",
    "two of the interesting strangeness measurements at low-@xmath16 have been those of radial and elliptic flow ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "a hydrodynamically inspired fit to the data shows that the radial flow component of the multi - strange baryons ( @xmath15 and @xmath3 ) is lower than that of the more abundant particles ( @xmath18 ) whilst at the same time , their thermal freeze - out temperature is somewhat higher  @xcite .",
    "however , the @xmath17 values of the multi - strange hadrons are consistent with that of the light hadrons .",
    "as @xmath17 is a quantity which integrates over the lifetime of the collision , coupled with the knowledge that they freeze - out thermally earlier than the more abundant particles , the non - zero measurement of the @xmath17 of the multi - strange hadrons can be interpreted as a manifestation of flow in the @xmath19 stage of the collision .",
    "although elliptic flow is often thought of as a bulk measurement , star has measured @xmath17 out to high-@xmath16 . at lower @xmath16",
    ", the @xmath17 for all particle species rises with increasing @xmath16 and is approximately the same , though some mass ordering is observed . at higher @xmath16 ( @xmath20 2 gev / c ) , as shown in figure [ fig : v2]a , the @xmath21 @xmath17 lies below the @xmath17 of the grouping of baryons . to exploit this fact , figure [ fig :",
    "v2]b shows the @xmath17 of the hadron , scaled by the number of valence quarks , plotted versus the @xmath16 of the hadron scaled by the same number .",
    "these data are fit by a polynomial and the lower panel shows the deviations of the different particles to the fit .",
    "although there are some small deviations , above a @xmath22 of 1 gev / c , the fit does a reasonably good job .",
    "this feature can be interpreted as further evidence for partonic collectivity and that @xmath23 represents the value of the partonic @xmath17 .",
    "one of the first indications that particle production at transverse momenta above 2 gev / c was not purely from modified jet fragmentation came in the form of baryon / meson ratios .",
    "the @xmath24 ratio showed an increase to a value consistent with unity for @xmath25 3 gev / c  @xcite , a value much higher than that observed in elementary collisions  @xcite .",
    "the measurement of the baryon / meson ratio was then measured out to higher @xmath26 by the star experiment  @xcite , which showed that the ratio reaches a maximum value of about 1.8 at @xmath16 = 2.8 gev / c , before turning over and decreasing to a value close to that observed in elementary collisions . the lack of statistics in this data - set mean that a statement on the @xmath26 where this comes together can not be made .",
    "figure [ fig : lamk0s]a shows the @xmath27 ratio in au+au collisions at @xmath6 = 200 gev .",
    "the data from year 2 is plotted to the left of the vertical line at @xmath16 = 3.5 gev / c , the a+a data to the right of this line represents the extension with the year 4 data - set . whilst the lower statistics data - set extended above a @xmath16 of 3.5 gev / c , above this point , the statistics are poor .    with the extension of the @xmath16 range using the year 4 data",
    ", one can see that by @xmath16 = 6",
    "gev / c , the @xmath27 ratio is similar for all centralities and is consistent with the measurement in the p+p data - set .",
    "another way of looking at this effect is by measuring the ratio of particle yields in central collisions relative to peripheral collisions , scaled by the relative number of binary collisions .",
    "this ratio is commonly referred to as the @xmath28 and is shown in the right panel of figure [ fig : lamk0s ] for both strange and non - strange particles",
    ". an @xmath28 value of 1 means that particle production simply scales with the number of binary collisions in the system , something which would be expected at high-@xmath26 if there are no medium effects . as observed in the year 2 data ,",
    "there is a splitting in the distributions , with the mesons having a smaller @xmath28 than baryons in the range 2 @xmath29 @xmath26 @xmath29 6 gev / c . above this value",
    ", they show the same suppression .    in this @xmath26 range ( known as intermediate @xmath26 ) ,",
    "models with novel hadronization mechanisms are required to reproduce these data . the majority of models used to describe the data use the recombination / coalescence ( reco ) mechanism to form hadrons  @xcite . in these models ,",
    "heavy @xmath30constituent@xmath31 quarks are combined to form hadrons - 3 for baryons and 2 for mesons .",
    "this mechanism naturally leads to a larger baryon - to - meson ratio due to the larger number of quarks at lower @xmath26 . in the models ,",
    "this mechanism is dominant when the parton @xmath26 distribution is an exponential , when it behaves as a power - law , then fragmentation dominates .",
    "there are a number of variations of this model which differ in small ways , the models which best describe the data only allow the recombination of thermally produced partons .",
    "those which allow for recombination between thermal partons and those coming from jets substantially over - predict both the magnitude of the ratio and the turn - over @xmath16 .",
    "one of the interesting topics in strangeness is to investigate in what systems and energies these phenomena are prevalent .",
    "although the cross - section for high-@xmath16 processes is lower at the cern - sps , the @xmath27 ratio has been studied out to a @xmath16 of 3 gev / c  @xcite .",
    "this also shows a rise with increasing @xmath16 as has been observed at rhic , but is at a much larger value due to the larger net - baryon density .",
    "in order to make comparisons between different energies feasible , it was suggested to instead plot the @xmath32 ratio which plots the relative difference between the @xmath27 ratio in central and peripheral event classes .",
    "this was first suggested elsewhere where year 2 au+au data was plotted on top of the pb+pb data at @xmath6 = 17.2 gev from na57 and it showed remarkable agreement  @xcite . in figure [ fig : rcplamk0s ] we again plot this data , but also add the year 4 au+au data together with data from au+au collisions at @xmath6 = 62 gev .",
    "ratio as a function of @xmath26 for three different collision systems.,scaledwidth=50.0%,scaledwidth=35.0% ]    as can be seen , there is very good agreement between all three different systems which may be indicative of the same hadroniazation mechanism for all three energies .",
    "the system size dependence of this ratio can be tested once the cu+cu data at both @xmath6 = 200 gev and @xmath6 = 62 gev have been analysed by star .      as well as determining differences between baryons and mesons using particle spectra and ratios ,",
    "it is also possible to examine these effects using identified two - particle azimuthal correlations .",
    "two - particle azimuthal correlations have oft been used to substitute for full jet reconstruction in high - multiplicity environments .",
    "star has previously shown that in p+p and d+au collisions , peaks in the correlation are seen for @xmath33 = 0 and @xmath33 = @xmath12 , indicating the near - side and away - side jets respectively  @xcite . here",
    ", we discuss in detail properties of near - side correlation peaks using identified strange trigger particles . in figure",
    "[ fig : rawcorr ] , we plot example raw correlation functions with @xmath4 , @xmath34 and @xmath21 trigger particles , associated with an unidentified charged particle , for both the 0 - 5@xmath35 and 30 - 40@xmath35 most central events respectively . in each case , 3 @xmath29 @xmath36 @xmath29 3.5 gev / c , 1 @xmath29 @xmath37 @xmath29 2 gev / c and @xmath38 @xmath29 1 .",
    "all correlation functions are normalised to the number of triggers and have been corrected for elliptic flow background , non - uniformities in detector geometry and reconstruction inefficiency of the associated particles .",
    "the data are fit with two gaussians ( near - side and away - side ) on top of a flat background and the associated yield is determined by the area under the gaussian peak .    using these correlation functions",
    ", it is possible to measure any differences between baryon- and meson - triggered correlations .",
    "these may be expected if the production of particles comes from different sources ( e.g. @xmath4 from both @xmath39 and @xmath40 jets , @xmath41 predominantly from @xmath40 jets ) .",
    "figure [ fig : nearsidecorr ] shows the yields / trigger of the near - side correlation for different trigger @xmath16 ranges for d+au collisions ( left panel ) and central ( 0 - 5@xmath35 ) au+au collisions ( right panel ) .",
    "although there is an increase of 3 to 4 in the near - side yields going from d+au to au+au , in each system , there is no discernible difference , outside the statistical error , for the baryon- , anti - baryon- , or meson - triggered correlations .",
    "this is further evidence to suggest that for the @xmath36 analysed , particle production is not yet dominated by jet fragmentation .",
    "if particle production is not coming from fragmentation , then there must be an alternative mechanism to produce azimuthal correlations .",
    "this can be achieved in a reco model by allowing the coalescence of a soft  thermal \" parton with that of a hard  shower \" parton ( in the case of a meson ) .",
    "predictions are shown in figure [ fig : recocorr]b from a reco model for the @xmath28 ratio of the near - side yields of unidentified two - particle azimuthal correlations  @xcite .",
    "on the figure , the model is compared to star preliminary data from year 2 ( low statistics data - set ) .",
    "figure [ fig : recocorr]a shows the ratio for both unidentified and identified correlations from the high statistics year 4 data - set and is plotted on the same scale as the predictions in the right panel .",
    "there is a small difference in both the @xmath36 range as well as the centrality , though this should have little effect on the prediction . in order to increase statistics",
    ", the @xmath4 and @xmath34 correlations have been added together , this is possible as no difference is observed between the separate correlations . the prediction and the data are in very good agreement in this @xmath36 range",
    ", however this must be analysed more closely .",
    "it has been shown that the @xmath33 correlations contain a large component of background made up of long range correlations in @xmath42 .",
    "these contributions are @xmath36 dependent and are most dominant at low @xmath36 and once taken into account , will lead to a flatter ratio .",
    "these correlations are not present in the model presented here so any agreement could be purely accidental .",
    "these correlations ( referred to as a  ridge@xmath31 ) are also probably responsible for the difference in the near - side yields between the au+au and d+au data presented in figure [ fig : nearsidecorr ] .    as well as this ratio ,",
    "the model has also made predictions regarding @xmath43 and @xmath3 production which state that contributions from thermal quarks will dominate up to a @xmath16 of 8 gev / c .",
    "two consequences of this prediction are that the measured @xmath44 ratio should show a linear rise with @xmath16 and that any @xmath3- or @xmath43-triggered two particle correlations are suppressed and not observed .",
    "whilst the @xmath3- and @xmath43-triggered correlations are still being studied , the @xmath44 ratio was presented elsewhere at this conference  @xcite .",
    "this ratio does rise up to a @xmath16 of 4 gev / c at which point it starts to turn - over .",
    "the difference in shape and the level of uncertainties on this do not allow for a strong conclusion to be made .",
    "in summary , we have presented recent results on strangeness production at rhic as measured by the star experiment . by fitting statistical models to the data , it was shown that the enhancement of the strange particles can be reproduced using the assumption that the volume scales with @xmath45 . at intermediate-@xmath16 ,",
    "measurements of identified particle @xmath17 , the @xmath27 ratio and the identified particle @xmath28 all point to models of hadronization other than jet fragmentation . in identified two - particle azimuthal correlations",
    ", we found that there is no dependence on the trigger species in either d+au or au+au collisions and when calculating a ratio of near - side yields , this was in agreement with a recombination model which allows for the recombination of thermal and shower particles .",
    "one crucial test of this model will be correlations with multi - strange particles .",
    "star will be able to perform this analysis when the full year 4 statistics have been analysed .",
