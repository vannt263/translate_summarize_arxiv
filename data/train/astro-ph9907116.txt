    "starburst galaxies are characterized by a nebular emission - line spectrum at optical and an absorption - line spectrum at ultraviolet wavelengths .",
    "this dichotomy arises because starbursts are powered by massive stars ( m@xmath11 10 m@xmath8 ) .",
    "these stars emit photons with energies of a few tens of ev which are absorbed and re - emitted in their stellar winds , producing ultraviolet resonance transitions , and thus , an ultraviolet absorption line spectrum .",
    "however , most of the ionizing photons emitted by the stars can travel tens of pc or more before they are absorbed by the surrounding interstellar gas .",
    "then , this ionized gas emits a nebular emission - line spectrum , mainly at optical and near - infrared wavelengths .",
    "however , around the balmer jump the spectra can show absorption features formed in the photospheres of massive stars .",
    "the radiative properties of starburst galaxies are determined by their massive stellar content .",
    "o , b and a stars can dominate the optical continuum emission of starburst galaxies .",
    "the spectra of the early - type stars are characterized by strong hydrogen balmer and neutral helium absorption lines and with only very weak metallic lines ( walborn & fitzpatrick 1990 ) . however , the detection of these stellar features at optical wavelengths in the spectra of starburst galaxies is difficult because h and hei absorption features are coincident with the nebular emission - lines that mask the absorption features .",
    "even so , the higher - order terms of the balmer series and some of the hei lines are detected in absorption in many starburst galaxies ( storchi - bergmann , kinney , & challis 1995 ; gonzlez - delgado et al .",
    "1995 ) , in seyfert 2 galaxies with their ultraviolet and optical continuum dominated by a nuclear starburst ( shields & filippenko 1990 ; gonzlez delgado et al . 1998 ; cid fernandes , storchi - bergmann , & schmitt 1998 ) , or even in the spectra of giant hii regions ( e.g. ngc 604 , terlevich et al .",
    "these features can be seen in absorption because the strength of the balmer series in emission decreases rapidly with decreasing wavelength , whereas the equivalent width of the stellar absorption lines is constant or increases with wavelength .",
    "thus , the net effect is that h@xmath12 , h@xmath0 and h@xmath1 are mainly seen in emission , but the higher - order terms of the series are seen in absorption . very often ,",
    "h@xmath12 , h@xmath0 , h@xmath1 and h@xmath2 show absorption wings superposed on the nebular emission .",
    "a similar effect occurs for the hei lines .",
    "the strongest nebular emission occurs in the hei @xmath35876 and hei @xmath36678 whereas the stellar absorption features are very weak .",
    "meanwhile , the equivalent width of the nebular emission of hei @xmath34471 or hei @xmath34026 ( @xmath6 6  , izotov , thuan , & lipovetsky 1997 ) is similar or even smaller than that of the stellar absorption lines .",
    "thus , they can be easily detected in absorption .",
    "models of the h balmer series and hei lines of a stellar population in a starburst galaxy can be used to predict the evolutionary state of a starburst , the effect of the initial mass function ( imf ) and corrections to the nebular h and hei emission - lines .",
    "accurate measurements of the nebular emission lines are needed to estimate the amount of internal interstellar reddening , star formation rate , excitation parameter and chemical abundances ( in particular in the determination of the primordial helium abundance ) in starburst galaxies .",
    "all these estimations are affected by the underlying h and hei stellar absorption .",
    "the internal interstellar reddening is derived using the balmer decrement .",
    "the emission - line ratios ( h@xmath12/h@xmath0 , h@xmath1/h@xmath0 , h@xmath2/h@xmath0 , ... ) are clearly affected by the stellar absorption .",
    "they are not affected equally because nebular emission decreases with wavelength .",
    "reddening and underlying absorption affect line ratios such as [ oii ] @xmath33727 + [ oiii ] @xmath35007/h@xmath0 and [ oiii ] @xmath35007/h@xmath0 which are used to estimate chemical abundances and the excitation parameter in starburst galaxies .",
    "the strength of the collisionally - excited emission - lines with respect to h@xmath0 can be used to estimate the evolutionary state of starburst galaxies ( garca - vargas , bressan , & daz 1995 ; garca - vargas et al .",
    "1997 ; gonzlez delgado et al .",
    "1999 ) ; higher line ratios are derived if h@xmath0 is not corrected for the stellar absorption .",
    "the underlying stellar absorption in the hei lines leads to an understimate of the he abundance in starburst galaxies , and potentially of the determination of the primordial helium abundance . however , high resolution spectra are needed to isolate the absorption lines from the nebular emission .    on the other hand ,",
    "the strength of the higher - order lines of the balmer series and some of the hei lines ( e.g. hei @xmath34026 , @xmath33819 ) , which are likely to be detected in absorption in starburst galaxies can be used to obtain information about the age and imf of their stellar population .",
    "it has been suggested that starburst galaxies have a deficit of intermediate and low - mass stars ( rieke et al .",
    "1980 ; viallefond & thuan 1983 ; augarde & lequeux 1985 ; scalo 1990 ) .",
    "however , the evidence in favor of this top - heavy imf in starburst galaxies is ambiguous ( satyapal et al 1995,1997 ) .",
    "it should be expected that the strength of the balmer absorption lines depends on the low mass cut - off because these lines are stronger in a stars .",
    "thus , if the mass of the starburst is distributed following a top - heavy imf , we expect that the h balmer lines are weaker than for the population with a non - truncated salpeter imf .",
    "h balmer and hei lines of a stellar population can be predicted using the evolutionary synthesis technique , a powerful tool to derive the properties of a stellar population taking as a free parameter the star formation history of the starburst ( age , imf , star formation rate ) .",
    "this technique has been used previously to derive the strength of the balmer and he i absorption lines of star forming regions .",
    "daz ( 1988 ) used the synthetic profiles of h@xmath12 , h@xmath0 , h@xmath1 and h@xmath2 computed by kurucz ( 1979 ) .",
    "she followed the evolution of the stellar cluster up to 40 myr and found that the profiles are rather insentive to the age and imf .",
    "olofsson ( 1995 ) computed the equivalent widths of the hydrogen ( h@xmath12 , h@xmath0 , h@xmath1 , h@xmath2 and l@xmath12 ) and hei ( @xmath34026 , 4387 , 4471 and 4921 ) lines of a single - burst star forming regions at three different metallicities ( @xmath13)=0.001 , 0.008 and 0.020 ) , and followed the evolution up to 15 myr .",
    "he used the synthetic models of kurucz ( 1993 ) and auer & mihalas ( 1972 ) at a resolution of 5  .",
    "he found that the equivalent width of the balmer lines increases during the course of the evolution , while hei decreases monotonically .",
    "the strength of these lines are very sensitive to the imf and insensitive to the metallicity . he suggested that balmer lines are prominent even if the low mass cut - off is as high as 10 m@xmath8 .",
    "cananzi , augarde & lequeux ( 1994 ) predict the balmer lines ( h@xmath0 , h@xmath1 and h@xmath2 ) using stellar spectra of o to g type observed at a spectral resolution of 2   ( cananzi , augarde , & lequeux 1993 ) .",
    "they conclude that the equivalent widths of the lines are more sensitive to the low than to the high - mass cut - off of the imf .",
    "the results seem contradictory : it is not yet clear if the imf parameters have an effect on the strength of the h balmer and hei lines . on the other hand , none of the previous studies made predictions for the strength of the higher - order balmer series lines ( h8 to h13 ) which are least affected by the emission and the most useful to obtain information on the evolutionary state of the starburst . due to the coincidence of the nebular emission and absorption lines in the observed spectra of starbursts , models that compute the profiles of these lines at high spectral resolution",
    "are required to predict the underlying absorption through the analysis of the absorption wings .",
    "to archieve this goal , we have built a stellar library of synthetic spectra with a sampling of 0.3  , effective temperature from 50000 to 4000 k and gravity between 0.0@xmath6log g@xmath65.0 ( gonzlez delgado & leitherer 1999 , paper i ) .",
    "the profiles are computed using a set of programs developed by hubeny and collaborators ( hubeny 1988 ; hubeny & lanz , 1995a , b ; hubeny , lanz , & jeffery , 1995 ) in three stages . for t@xmath14 25000 k ,",
    "the code tlusty is used to compute nlte stellar atmosphere models .",
    "these models together with kurucz ( 1993 ) lte stellar atmosphere models ( for t@xmath7 25000 k ) are used as input to synspec , the program that solves the radiative transfer equation .",
    "finally , the synthetic spectrum is obtained after performing the rotational and instrumental convolution .",
    "this library has been included in our evolutionary synthesis code ( starburst99 , leitherer et al 1999 ) to predict the strength of the balmer and he i lines for a stellar population .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : section 2 describes the models , the assumptions and computational techniques .",
    "section 3 deals with the results and discusses the effects of the imf parameters and metallicity on the strength of the lines .",
    "we compare the equivalent widths of the balmer and hei absorption lines with the values predicted for the nebular recombination emission - lines in section 4 . in section 5 ,",
    "the models are compared with observations of stellar clusters of the large magellanic clouds , the super - star clusters in the starburst galaxy ngc 1569 , the nucleus of the dwarf elliptical galaxy ngc 205 and a luminous `` e+a '' galaxy .",
    "the summary and the conclusions are in section 6 .",
    "the stellar library of synthetic spectra which covers the main hydrogen balmer and neutral he lines ( paper i ) , has been implemented in our evolutionary synthesis code starburst99 ( leitherer et al .",
    "the synthesis is done in two steps .",
    "first , the code computes the population of stars in the cluster as a function of age and imf ; then the profiles of the lines are synthesized by adding the different contributions from stars .",
    "two limiting models of the star formation history are considered : an instantaneous burst and star formation proceeding continuously at a constant rate . in the instantaneous burst , all the stars are formed at the same time on the zero - age - main - sequence ( zams ) , and then evolve in the hertzsprung - russell diagram ( hrd ) until 1 gyr .",
    "these models are normalized to a total mass of 10@xmath4 m@xmath8 .",
    "the star formation rate of the continuous model is 1 m@xmath8 yr@xmath15 ; they extend to 1 gyr .",
    "the models are generated for different assumptions about the imf , which is parameterized as a power law , @xmath16(m)= c m@xmath17 ; where the constant @xmath18 is determined by the total gas mass converted into stars .",
    "the reference model is a power law with exponent @xmath12=2.35 , and with low - mass and high - mass cut - off masses of m@xmath19= 1 m@xmath8 and m@xmath20= 80 m@xmath8 . for comparison ,",
    "we have computed models with @xmath12= 3.3 and @xmath12= 1.0 between @xmath21= 1 m@xmath8 and @xmath22= 80 m@xmath8 ; and a truncated salpeter ( @xmath12 = 2.35 ) imf between @xmath21= 1 m@xmath8 and @xmath22= 30 m@xmath8 , @xmath21= 5 m@xmath8 and @xmath22= 80 m@xmath8 , and @xmath21= 10 m@xmath8 and @xmath22= 80 m@xmath8 .",
    "the models are computed with the isochrone synthesis method .",
    "thus , continuous isochrones are calculated by interpolating between the tracks in the hrd on a variable mass grid .",
    "the stars evolve from the zams following the new set of evolutionary tracks of the geneva group ( schaller et al .",
    "1992 , schaerer et al .",
    "1993a , b , charbonnel et al .",
    "1993 , meynet et al .",
    "1994 ) , with standard - mass loss rate .",
    "the time resolution of the models is 0.01 myr ; however , the profile of the lines are given only at time steps during which significant changes occur .",
    "for every step , the luminosity , effective temperature , radius and surface gravity are calculated for each star .",
    "then a spectrum of our stellar library is assigned to each star .",
    "the corresponding synthetic spectrum is flux calibrated using the stellar atmosphere grid compiled by lejeune et al ( 1997 ) .",
    "this compilation which includes the 20   resolution kurucz ( 1993 ) stellar atmospheres is supplemented by schmutz , leitherer , & gruenwald ( 1992 ) models for stars with expanding envelopes .",
    "the flux of the continuum is assigned to each normalized spectrum by fitting a first order polynomial to the plane ( f@xmath23 , log @xmath3 ) , where f@xmath23 is the distribution of the continuum flux of the corresponding low resolution stellar atmosphere model .",
    "the fit is done taking points of the continuum adjacent to the absorption lines h@xmath0 , h@xmath1 , h@xmath2 and hei @xmath34471 for the spectral ranges 4820 - 4950  , 4270 - 4430  , 3990 - 4150   and 4420 - 4580  , respectively . to calibrate the stellar spectra between 3720 and 3920  , we use the result of the fit in the wavelength range of h@xmath2 ( if t@xmath14 12000 k ) or h@xmath0 ( if t@xmath7 12000 k ) extrapolated to those wavelengths . the calibration was chosen to achieve consistency between the distribution of the continuum flux of our synthesized high - resolution spectra and the spectral energy distribution which is also predicted by our code at a resolution of 20   ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "the nebular continuum has been added to the synthesized spectra .",
    "we have assumed that all the stellar far - uv photons below 912   are absorbed by gas and converted into continuous and line emission at longer wavelengths .",
    "we have computed the synthesized profiles for two metallicities , @xmath13=0.02 ( z@xmath8 ) and z=0.001 ( 1/20 z@xmath8 ) .",
    "while the input stellar evolutionary tracks are different for these two metallicities , we use the same stellar library ( generated assuming solar metallicity ) because the profiles of the balmer lines of individual stars do not change significantly with metallicity for t@xmath14 7000 k ( see paper i ) .",
    "figure 2 shows the synthetic spectra for a star cluster formed instantaneously 3 , 50 and 500 myr ago .",
    "the imf is salpeter with @xmath21= 1 m@xmath8 and @xmath22= 80 m@xmath8 ; the metallicity is solar .",
    "the general tendency is that the strength of the balmer lines increases with the evolution until 500 myr , and the hei lines until 30 - 40 myr .",
    "the equivalent widths of the balmer ( table 1 and 2 ) and he i ( table 3 and 4 ) lines are measured in the windows indicated in the figure 2 .",
    "two different measurements are made , one integrating the flux from the continuum set to unity and the other from a pseudo - continuum .",
    "this pseudo - continuum is found fitting a first - order polynomial ( except for the spectral range 3720 - 3920  , for which we use a third - order fit ) to the continuum windows defined in table 3 of paper i. the absolute values of the equivalent widths depend on the continuum level and on the width on the windows used to measure the strength of the lines . however , the relative behavior of the equivalent width with age of the star cluster is independent of the continuum and of the width of the windows .",
    "we plot the equivalent widths measured from the pseudo - continuum because these measurements are more representative of the equivalent widths we can measure in observed spectra .",
    "first , we discuss the profiles and equivalent widths of h balmer and he i lines for the reference model ( salpeter imf , m@xmath19= 1 m@xmath8 and m@xmath20= 80 m@xmath8 ) for an instantaneous burst and for continuous star formation .",
    "then , the effect of the imf parameters and finally the effect of the metallicity are discussed .",
    "the full data set is available for retrieval at http://www.iaa.es/ae/e2.html and at http://www.stsci.edu / science / starburst/.      figure 3 shows the equivalent widths of the balmer lines as a function of the age for an instantaneous burst .",
    "we plotted the equivalent width measured from the pseudo - continuum and integrating the flux in the windows of 60   for h@xmath0 , h@xmath1 and h@xmath2 , and 30   for h8 , h9 and h10 , respectively .",
    "all the balmer lines have similar behavior ; the equivalent widths are in the range between 2   to 16  . during the first 4 myr , the equivalent width does not change , with h@xmath0 , h@xmath1 and h@xmath2 @xmath24 3  , which is very similar to the values predicted by olofsson ( 1995 ) , and very similar to the value estimated ( @xmath24 2  ) for the balmer absorption in giant hii regions ( shields & searle 1978 , mccall , ribsky , & shields 1985 ) .    the equivalent width increases with the age of the burst until 500 myr ;",
    "then , it decreases .",
    "the maximum is at 500 myr since the turn - off stellar population in the cluster are stars of type a2v that have a life - time of several hundreds myr .",
    "these stars have t@xmath25 of 9000 k , and at this t@xmath25 the strength of the balmer lines peaks ( see e.g. figure 2 in paper i ) .",
    "the predicted value at 500 myr ( the equivalent width of h@xmath0= 11 - 12  ) is , e.g. , in agreement with the values measured in the super star clusters of ngc 1275 ( brodie et al .",
    "1998 ) and the values predicted by population synthesis models using stellar clusters ( bica & alloin 1986a ) .    for continuous star formation ,",
    "the strength of the lines increases with time until 500 myr ; then , the equivalent widths are constant ( figure 4 ) .",
    "the equivalent widths range from 3 to 10  .",
    "they are very similar to the burst models at the begining of the evolution ( about 3   for continuous star formation lasting for 4 myr ) . however , the equivalent width increases less rapidly with time than in the burst model .",
    "the reason is the dilution of the balmer lines by o stars which have weaker balmer lines than a stars and which are continuously forming in the cluster .",
    "figure 5 shows the equivalent width of some of the hei lines .",
    "hei @xmath34471 and hei @xmath34026 are the strongest lines ; they have equivalent widths that range between 0.5   and 1.1  .",
    "hei @xmath34922 , hei @xmath34388 and hei @xmath33819 are about a factor two weaker than hei @xmath34471 and hei @xmath34026 .",
    "this result is opposite to that found by olofsson ( 1995 ) .",
    "however , observations of individual galactic b stars ( lennon , dufton , & fitzsimmons 1993 ) show that the lines hei @xmath34471 and hei @xmath34026 have both similar strength and are about a factor of two stronger than hei @xmath34922 and hei @xmath34388 ( these two lines have also similar strength ) .",
    "we found the same result examining the spectral atlas of walborn & fitzpatrick ( 1990 ) .",
    "the equivalent width of the hei lines is almost constant for bursts younger than 4 myr , with hei @xmath34471 and hei @xmath34026 being about 0.5  , and hei @xmath34922 , hei @xmath34388 and hei @xmath33819 about 0.3  .",
    "after 4 myr , the equivalent width increases with age ( but not monotonically ) until the burst age reaches 30 - 40 myr due to the contribution of early - type b stars that show the strongest hei absorption .",
    "this result is opposite to that found by olofsson ( 1995 ) .",
    "he followed the evolution of the starburst until 15 myr , and he found that the maximum strength of the hei lines is at 2 myr , no hei absorption is formed in his models burst older than 10 myr .",
    "lennon et al ( 1993 ) show that stars from o9 to b2 have similar strengths of the hei @xmath34471 and hei @xmath34026 lines ; these are weaker in stars hotter than o9 and cooler than b2 . by definition hei lines",
    "are not formed in the photosphere of stars cooler than b9 .",
    "these observations are in agreement with the results found in our stellar grid ( see figure 4 of paper i ) and explain why the equivalent width of these lines in the integrated light of a stellar cluster have their maximum values between 10 and 40 myr , when the cluster is dominated by early b stars .",
    "hei absorption is not formed for bursts older than 100 myr because the life - time of b9 stars is about this age .",
    "the equivalent width has some local maximum between 5 and 20 myr .",
    "this is due to the presence of post - main sequence stars with t@xmath78000 k that contribute significantly to the integrated light of the cluster at these ages ( figure 6 ) .",
    "these are the blue loops of the red super - giant in the tracks .",
    "these stars do not produce hei lines but show many metal lines close to the hei lines ( figure 7 ) .",
    "these metal lines are in the spectral windows used to measure the equivalent width .",
    "they depress the continuum and contribute to the integrated profile making it broader and asymmetric ( figure 8) .",
    "a similar effect is also seen in the h balmer lines . however , the contribution of these metallic lines to the equivalent width of the window where the balmer lines are measured is less than to the windows of the hei lines because the balmer lines are relatively stronger .    for continuous star formation , the equivalent width ranges between 0.5 to 0.9    ( for hei @xmath34471 and hei @xmath34026 ) .",
    "the strength of these lines increases with time until @xmath9 100 myr ; then , the equivalent widths decrease with time ( figure 9 ) .",
    "40 myr after the onset of the star formation , the equivalent widths of the lines ( hei @xmath34471 and hei @xmath34026 ) is 0.8  .",
    "they are weaker than in the instantaneous burst model of the same age . however , due to the presence of b stars in the cluster , the hei lines are stronger in the continuous star formation scenario than in the instantaneous burst after 100 myr .",
    "we study the influence of the slope and the low and high mass cut - off of the imf on the profile and equivalent width of the hydrogen balmer and hei lines in a single stellar population .",
    "the models computed have imf slopes @xmath12= 1.0 and @xmath12= 3.3 , low mass cut - offs @xmath21= 5 m@xmath8 and @xmath21= 10 m@xmath8 and high mass cut - offs @xmath22= 30 m@xmath8 with respect to the reference model ( @xmath12= 2.35 , @xmath21= 1 m@xmath8 and @xmath22= 80 m@xmath8 ) .",
    "figure 10 shows the change of the profiles of h@xmath2 and hei ( @xmath34026 , 4009 and 4143 ) with the slope of the imf for a 2 myr old burst .",
    "clusters formed with an imf flatter than salpeter produce hydrogen balmer lines weaker than in the reference model because more massive stars are formed in the cluster . at 2 myr ,",
    "these stars dilute the strength of the balmer and hei lines since these lines are weaker in o than in b stars .",
    "however , after 4 myr the relative number of massive stars still on the main sequence with respect to b and a stars is very low . at that epoch ,",
    "the profiles and equivalent widths of these lines are almost the same as those of the reference model ( figure 11 ) .",
    "hei lines are also weaker than in the reference model if the cluster is younger than 4 myr",
    ". these lines are slightly stronger if the cluster is between 20 and 100 myr old ( figure 12 ) . during the post - starburst phase ,",
    "the integrated light is dominated by b stars , and for a flatter imf , the relative number of b stars with respect to a stars is slightly higher than in the reference model .",
    "this effect , however , is very small .",
    "the opposite result is found if the imf is steeper than the salpeter imf . in this case",
    "the balmer and he i lines are stronger than in the reference model if the burst is younger than 4 myr .",
    "between 20 and 100 myr , hei lines are weaker than in the salpeter model , because fewer b stars contribute to the integrated light of the cluster . however ,",
    "at these ages the change of the strength of these lines ( figure 12 ) is less important than at ages younger than 4 myr , when the equivalent width can change by almost a factor of 2 ( figure 11 and 12 ) .",
    "figure 13 shows the change of h@xmath2 and hei ( @xmath34026 , 4009 and 4143 ) with @xmath21 and @xmath22 for a 2 myr old burst .",
    "the h@xmath2 and hei lines are stronger if @xmath22= 30 m@xmath8 than in the reference model ; but they are very similar to those predicted by the reference model if @xmath21= 5 m@xmath8 .",
    "this result holds as long as the burst is younger than 5 myr because the life - time of stars with mass higher than 30 m@xmath8 is less than 5 myr .",
    "thus , if the cluster is younger than 5 myr and the mass is distributed following a standard salpeter imf , the integrated light should be dominated by stars more massive than 30 m@xmath8 .",
    "these stars have balmer and hei lines that are weaker than stars less massive than 30 m@xmath8 . in this case",
    ", the balmer and hei lines are diluted with respect to the truncated ( @xmath22=30 m@xmath8 ) imf .",
    "however , after 5 myr , all the stars more massive than 30 m@xmath8 have evolved from the main sequence and the integrated light shows balmer and hei lines of the same strength .",
    "if the cluster is formed following a truncated salpeter imf with @xmath21=5 m@xmath8 , the integrated light shows the balmer and hei lines at a similar strength as in a cluster formed following the standard salpeter imf .",
    "the life - time of stars with mass of 5 m@xmath8 is about 100 myr .",
    "clusters formed without stars less massive than 5 m@xmath8 will fade after 100 myr when all the stars have evolved from the main - sequence",
    ". a stronger effect of a truncated imf is found if @xmath26 5 m@xmath8 . in these cases , balmer and hei lines",
    "are always weaker than in the reference model because fewer b and a stars are formed .",
    "the main effect of changing the parameters of the imf is observed in the first 4 myr of the evolution of the starburst .",
    "if the imf is steeper than the reference one or the upper mass cut - off is much lower than 80 m@xmath8 , fewer o stars are formed and the balmer and hei lines are stronger . if the imf is flatter than salpeter or if the low mass cut - off is higher than 5 m@xmath8 , more o stars are formed relative to b and a stars , and the lines are weaker . however , the ability of the balmer and hei lines to constrain the imf depends strongly on the resolution of the observations , and on the spatial distribution of the stellar cluster with respect to the nebular emission , because at ages younger than 5 myr starbursts show very strong hei and balmer emission - lines that fill in the absorptions .",
    "a nearby starburst , that can be spatially resolved , and where the core stellar cluster shines through a hole of nebular emission produced by the stellar winds , will show a spectrum with absorption wings around the balmer emission and with the hei lines in absorption ; ngc 604 is a good example of this ( see figure 9 in terlevich et al 1996 ) .",
    "in this cases , the hei lines that are fainter in emission ( e.g. , hei @xmath34026 , @xmath34388 and @xmath34026 ) can be dominated by the stellar absorption . thus , under these circumstances , the equivalent widths of these lines and the wing absorption profiles of the higher terms of the balmer series can be used to constrain the imf ( gonzlez delgado & prez 1999 , in preparation ) . when these circumstances do not occur",
    ", the total integrated spectrum of a starburst will be dominated by the nebular emission while it is younger than 5 myr ( see also section 4 ) , and the stellar lines will not be detected ; therefore , any information about the starburst will be obtained through the analysis of the emission - lines .",
    "in paper i we demonstrated that the strengths of the balmer and hei lines in _ individual _ stars hotter than 7000 k do not depend on metallicity .",
    "however , the strength of these lines in the _ integrated _ light of a stellar cluster depends on metallicity due to the metallicity dependent stellar population . at low metallicity ,",
    "a star of a given zams mass is hotter and evolves more slowly in the hrd diagram , explaining why the balmer lines are weaker at z= 0.001 than at solar metallicity ( figure 14 , table 5 ) . at any age",
    "younger than 500 myr , main - sequence stars that dominate the luminosity of the cluster have higher effective temperature at z= 0.001 than at solar metallicity .",
    "after 500 myr , stars hotter than 9000 k are still in the main sequence at z= 0.001 metallicity .",
    "therefore , the equivalent width of the balmer lines can still increase with the age of the cluster .",
    "in contrast , at solar metallicity , main - sequence stars have effective temperature lower than 9000 k. as a result , the equivalent width decreases with age .",
    "the effect is similar for the hei lines . for ages younger than 20 myr ,",
    "the lines are weaker at z= 0.001 than at solar metallicity , but between 50 - 300 myr there are still main - sequence stars with effective temperature hotter than 12000 k that contribute significantly to the formation of the hei lines .",
    "therefore , the equivalent width of the hei lines in this age range is higher at z= 0.001 than at solar metallicity ( figure 15 , table 6 ) .",
    "in this section , we compare the equivalent width of the nebular h balmer series and hei lines and the stellar absorption lines . the goal is to quantify the effect of the stellar absorption on the strength of the nebular lines and determine the evolutionary stages of the starburst during which this effect is important .",
    "this will also show which of the balmer and hei lines are more useful to age - date starbursts .",
    "we calculate the equivalent width of the h balmer and hei nebular emission - lines as the ratio of the luminosity of the emission - line to the continuum , which is estimated from the continuum adjacent to the line and includes the luminosity of the stellar and nebular continuous emission .",
    "the luminosities of the h balmer nebular lines is calculated from the relationship between the intensity of the line and the number of lyman continuum photons and the theoretical ratios ( assuming case b ; osterbrock 1989 ) h@xmath1/h@xmath0 ( 0.469 ) , h@xmath2/h@xmath0 ( 0.259 ) and h8/h@xmath0 ( 0.105 ) .",
    "the luminosity of the hei recombination lines have been calculated from the ratio hei @xmath34471/h@xmath0 and the theoretical ratio hei @xmath34026/hei @xmath34471 ( 0.474 ) , hei @xmath34922/hei @xmath34471 ( 0.274 ) and hei @xmath33819/hei @xmath34471 ( 0.264 ) .",
    "we estimate the ratio hei @xmath34471/h@xmath0 using the photoionization code cloudy ( ferland 1997 ) .",
    "the models are computed assuming that the gas is ionization bounded and is spherically distributed around the ionizing cluster with a constant density of 100 @xmath27 .",
    "the chemical composition of the gas is solar and the ionizing photon luminosity is fixed to the values predicted by the evolutionary synthesis models .",
    "we take as the radiation field the spectral energy distribution predicted by starburst99 ( leitherer et al .",
    "models are computed for an instantaneous burst with age between 0 and 20 myr and continuous star formation lasting up to 100 myr .",
    "tables 7 and 8 show the ratio hei @xmath34471/h@xmath0 and the equivalent width of the h and hei lines for burst and continuous star formation , respectively .",
    "the ratio hei @xmath34471/h@xmath0 decreases with the age of the instantaneous burst , and drops to zero for a burst older than 5 myr .",
    "these clusters do not harbor stars that produce a significant number of photons to ionize he into he@xmath28 ; therefore , the ratio should be zero .",
    "csf models lasting for more than 5 myr predict a hei @xmath34471/h@xmath0 ratio which is constant with time , because after this age the number of stars able to ionize he is constant since births and deaths are in equilibrium .",
    "the stellar absorption is more important for the higher terms of the balmer series and for older instantaneous bursts than for the csf scenario ( figure 16 ) .",
    "h@xmath0 is dominated by the stellar absorption if the burst is older than 8 myr ; however , the effect of the stellar absorption is small if the star formation proceeds continuously .",
    "thus , at 100 myr , the strength of the h@xmath0 stellar absorption is less than 20@xmath10 of the strength of the nebular emission .",
    "however , the effect of the stellar absorption is more dramatic for the higher terms of the balmer series .",
    "h@xmath2 and h8 are dominated by the stellar absorption if the burst is older than 4 and 5 myr , respectively .",
    "if the star formation proceeds continuously , after 30 myr and 100 myr , the strengths of the stellar absorption lines are equal to those of the nebular emission - lines h8 and h@xmath2 , respectively .",
    "the hei nebular emission - lines are more affected by the stellar absorption lines than the hydrogen balmer lines ( figure 17 ) .",
    "bursts older than 5 myr do not show hei in emission , and after this age they can be in absorption ( figure 17a ) .",
    "hei @xmath33819 is more affected by the stellar absorption than the other lines .",
    "the equivalent width of the emission - line equals the absorption equivalent width when the burst is only 3 myr old . as with the balmer lines ,",
    "hei lines are less affected by the absorption if the star formation proceeds continuously ( figure 17b ) .",
    "hei @xmath34471 is very little affected by the absorption ; however , the equivalent width of the emission - line hei @xmath33819 equals the stellar absorption line equivalent width at 20 myr for continuous star formation , and after this time hei @xmath33819 is dominated by the stellar absorption .",
    "thus , as we anticipated , the high - order terms of the balmer series and hei @xmath33819 in absorption are good indicators of the evolutionary state of the starburst , because the nebular emission is weaker and the lines are dominated by the stellar component .",
    "in this section , we compare the profile and equivalent width of the balmer lines of our models with observations of stellar clusters in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) , the super - star cluster b in the starburst galaxy ngc 1569 , the nucleus of the dwarf elliptical galaxy ngc 205 , and a luminous `` e+a '' galaxy to test the applicability of our models .",
    "bica & alloin ( 1986b ) observed clusters in the lmc with ages between 10 and 500 myr .",
    "the data were grouped in four different types , called y1 , y2 , y3 and y4 , corresponding to ages of 10 myr , 25 myr , 80 myr and 200 - 500 myr , respectively .",
    "these spectra are public ( leitherer et al 1996 ) .",
    "the spectral range covers 1200 to 9800  , with a resolution in the range 7 - 17  . at optical wavelengths ,",
    "the template y1 contains the cluster ngc 2004 ( age= 8 myr , [ z]=-0.25 ) ; y2 contains ngc 1847 ( age= 25 myr , [ z]=-0.4 ) , ngc 2157 ( age= 30 myr , [ z]=-0.6 ) and ngc 2214 ( age= 40 myr , [ z]=-1.2 ) ; y3 contains ngc 1866 ( age= 86 myr , [ z]=-1.2 ) ; and y4 contains ngc 1831 ( age= 300 myr , [ z]=-1.0 ) and ngc 1868 ( age= 500 myr , [ z]=-1.1 ) .",
    "figure 18 compares the equivalent width of the balmer lines of the four templates measured in the same windows as the models .",
    "the figures show the model results for a single burst assuming that the mass of the cluster is distributed with a salpeter imf between 1 and 80 m@xmath8 at z@xmath8 ( full line ) and z= 0.001 ( dashed line ) metallicity .",
    "the observations and the models are in very good agreement",
    ". however , the equivalent widths of the higher terms of the balmer series of the template y4 ( age=200 - 500 myr ) are weaker than in the models ( figure 18 c y d ) .",
    "the discrepancy could be related to the poor spectral resolution of the observations .",
    "decreased spectral resolution artificially decreases the continuum level ; thus , decreasing the equivalent width of the observed lines .",
    "this effect is more important for template y4 because the balmer lines are stronger and broader for ages between 200 and 500 myr .",
    "super - star clusters ( ssc ) are highly compact ( diameter a few pc ) , massive ( 10@xmath29 - 10@xmath4 m@xmath8 ) , young ( age younger than 1 gyr ) clusters . there are suggestions that sscs represent the present - day analogs of young globular clusters because their masses and sizes are comparable to those of milky way globular clusters ( oconnell , gallagher , & hunter 1994 ; ho & filippenko 1996 ) .",
    "they represent a basic mode of star formation in starburst galaxies ( meurer et al .",
    "1995 ) and are building blocks of these objects . the clusters can be approximated by a coeval , single metallicity stellar population .",
    "hst images of the dwarf starburst galaxy ngc 1569 suggest that the ssc b has an age of 15 - 300 myr ( oconnell et al .",
    "1994 ) and ground - based optical spectra suggest an age of 10 myr ( gonzlez delgado et al . 1997 ) .",
    "the latter result is based on the analysis of the optical spectral energy distribution and on the strength of the caii triplet ( see also prada et al .",
    "1994 ) . to test our models ,",
    "we have compared the synthetic profiles of the balmer lines with the observations ( see gonzlez delgado et al 1997 for details of the observations ) .",
    "the models are binned to the spectral resolution of the observations ( the dispersion is 1.4  / pix ) .",
    "the balmer lines are partially filled with nebular emission ; therefore the fitting has to be done based on the wings of the absorption features .",
    "this effect is less important for the higher terms of the balmer series because the nebular emission drops quickly with decreasing wavelength .",
    "figure 19 plots the observed lines and the synthetic models for a burst of 10 and 50 myr at z@xmath8/5 metallicity ( assuming salpeter imf , @xmath21=1 m@xmath8 and @xmath22=80 m@xmath8 ) .",
    "the profiles indicate that the balmer lines are more compatible with a 10 myr old burst than with one that is 50 myr old .",
    "ages older than 10 myr produce profiles which are wider than the observed ones .",
    "this comparison confirms the result of gonzlez delgado et al .",
    "( 1997 ) that the age of the ssc b is about 10 myr and shows that this technique can discriminate well between a young and an intermediate - age population .",
    "we have observed the nucleus of the dwarf elliptical galaxy ngc 205 to provide a spectral template of an intermediate age population in order to analyze the stellar population of a sample of seyfert 2 nuclei ( gonzlez delgado et al 1998 ) .",
    "the equivalent widths of the balmer lines measured in our spectrum ( ew(h@xmath0)=7.7  , ew(h@xmath1)=7.4  , ew(h@xmath2)=8.8  , ew(h@xmath30)=7.4  ) are weaker than the values predicted by a population in the range 100 - 500 myr ( see figure 14 ) .",
    "bica , alloin , & schmidt ( 1990 ) have undertaken the population synthesis of the integrated optical light of the nucleus of ngc 205 .",
    "they conclude that the dominant population is in the range 100 - 500 myr ; however , this population only produces @xmath9 50@xmath10 of the optical light .",
    "the remaining 50@xmath10 is due to young ( @xmath9 10 myr ) , intermediate ( 1 - 5 gyr ) and old ( @xmath11 10 gyr ) components that contribute with 10@xmath10 , 20@xmath10 and 20@xmath10 of the optical light , respectively .",
    "these populations have equivalent widths of the balmer lines that are weaker than the intermediate population of 100 - 500 myr ( at these ages , the balmer lines have their maximum strength ) .",
    "thus , the equivalent width of the balmer lines is diluted by the contribution of the other components with respect to a single population of several hundred myrs .",
    "we have combined our models contributing to the total light in the fraction derived by bica et al ( 1990 ) and we found that the combined synthesis profile fits very well the observations ( figure 20 ) .",
    "oegerle , hill , & hoessel ( 1991 ) reported the serendipitous discovery of a relatively low redshift galaxy in the post - starburst phase that is one of the best examples of the so - called `` e+a '' galaxies ( dressler & gunn 1983 ) .",
    "the spectra of these galaxies show very strong balmer absorption lines produced by a large number of a stars .",

    "models are generated using the isochrone synthesis method assuming that stars evolve from the zams following the set of evolutionary tracks of the geneva group . at each age , the spectrum is computed assigning the corresponding high - resolution spectrum from our stellar library to each star .",

    "high spectral resolution profiles of these lines ( in the models and observations ) are required to constrain the evolutionary state of a very young stellar population through the analysis of the balmer absorption wings under the nebular emission - lines .",
    "evolutionary synthesis profiles of the higher terms of the balmer series are very useful , as anticipated , to age - date the starburst because the nebular balmer decrement decreases very rapidly with decreasing wavelength whereas the equivalent widths of the stellar balmer absorption lines are almost constant with wavelength .",
    "a 4 myr old burst shows a h8 stellar line of equal strength to the nebular emission - line ; in contrast , at this age h@xmath0 is dominated by nebular emission .",
    "hei @xmath33819 is also very useful to age - date starbursts because the nebular emission is weaker than in the other hei lines and is dominated by the stellar absorption if the burst is older than 3 myr .",

    "their equivalent widths increase with age until about a few hundred myr when the stellar population is dominated by early - a type stars ; they range between 2 and 16   if the cluster is formed at solar metallicity . during the first 4 myr , the balmer lines are not sensitive to the age because the equivalent widths of the lines are almost constant , h@xmath0 , h@xmath1 and h@xmath2 @xmath9 3  , and h9 and h10 @xmath9 2  , respectively",
    ". the balmer lines are always weaker than 6   if the starburst is in the nebular phase ( younger than 10 myr old ) .",
    "balmer lines are also sensitive to the change of the imf parameters during the first 4 myr of the evolution of the starburst .",
    "stronger lines are formed in the cluster if the mass of the cluster is distributed following a truncated salpeter imf with @xmath22=30 m@xmath8 or if the imf is steeper than salpeter .",
    "however , the strength of the lines is less sensitive to the low mass cut - off , contrary to previous suggestions .",
    "balmer lines are prominent ( @xmath9 2  ) even when the low mass cut - off is as high as 10 m@xmath8 .",

    "<S> we present evolutionary stellar population synthesis models to predict the spectrum of a single - metallicity stellar population , with a spectral sampling of 0.3   in five spectral regions between 3700 and 5000  . </S>",
    "<S> the models , which are optimized for galaxies with active star formation , synthesize the profiles of the hydrogen balmer series ( h@xmath0 , h@xmath1 , h@xmath2 , h8 , h9 , h10 , h11 , h12 and h13 ) and the neutral helium absorption lines ( hei @xmath34922 , hei @xmath34471 , hei @xmath34388 , hei @xmath34144 , hei @xmath34121 , hei @xmath34026 , hei @xmath34009 and hei @xmath33819 ) for a burst with an age ranging from 10@xmath4 to 10@xmath5 yr , and different assumptions about the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) . </S>",
    "<S> continuous star formation models lasting for 1 gyr are also presented . </S>",
    "<S> the input stellar library includes nlte absorption profiles for stars hotter than 25000 k and lte profiles for lower temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature and gravity coverage is 4000 k @xmath6t@xmath750000 k and 0.0@xmath6log g@xmath65.0 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the metallicity is solar .    </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the balmer and hei line profiles are sensitive to the age , except during the first 4 myr of the evolution , when the equivalent widths of these lines are constant . at these early stages of the evolution , the profiles of the lines are also sensitive to the imf . </S>",
    "<S> however , strong h balmer and hei lines are predicted even when the low mass cut - off of the imf is as high as 10 m@xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> the equivalent widths of the balmer lines range from 2 to 16   and the hei lines from 0.2 to 1.2  . during the nebular phase ( cluster younger than about 10 myr ) , h@xmath0 ranges from 2 to 5   and hei @xmath34471 between 0.5 and 1.2  . </S>",
    "<S> the strength of the lines is maximum when the cluster is a few hundred ( for the balmer lines ) and a few ten ( for the hei lines ) myr old . in the continuous star formation scenario , </S>",
    "<S> the strength of the balmer and hei lines increases monotonically with time until 500 myr and 100 myr , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> however , the lines are weaker than in the burst models due to the dilution of the balmer and hei lines by the contribution from very massive stars .    </S>",
    "<S> the high spectral resolution of the profiles is useful to reproduce the absorption wings observed in regions of recent star formation and to estimate the effect of the underlying absorption on the nebular emission - lines . </S>",
    "<S> the strength of the nebular emission balmer and hei lines compared with the stellar absorption components indicates that h@xmath2 and the higher - order terms of the balmer series and hei are dominated by the stellar absorption component if an instantaneous burst is older than @xmath9 5 myr . some of the hei lines ( e.g. hei @xmath33819 , hei @xmath34922 ) are more favorable than others </S>",
    "<S> ( e.g. hei @xmath34471 ) for the detection of stellar features in the presence of nebular emission . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate that the correction to the hei @xmath34471 nebular emission line due to the stellar absorption is between 5 and 25@xmath10 , if the nebular emission has equivalent width between 10 and 2.5   ( corresponding to a burst age between 1 - 3 myr ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the models can be used to date starburst and post - starburst galaxies until 1 gyr . </S>",
    "<S> they have been tested on data for clusters in the lmc , the super - star cluster b in the starburst galaxy ngc 1569 , the nucleus of the dwarf elliptical ngc 205 and a luminous `` e+a '' galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> the full data set is available for retrieval at http://www.iaa.es/ae/e2.html and at http://www.stsci.edu/science/starburst/ , or on request from the authors at rosa@iaa.es </S>"
