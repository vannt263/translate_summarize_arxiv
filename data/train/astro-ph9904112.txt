    "cir  x-1 is one of the most puzzling x - ray binaries known . like the peculiar systems",
    "ss 433 and cyg x-3 , it can not easily be classified into any of the major categories of x - ray binaries .",
    "indeed , there is even doubt as to whether it is a high - mass ( hmxb ) or low - mass x - ray binary ( lmxb ) .    since its discovery in early 1970s ,",
    "cir  x-1 has been studied intensively at x - ray wavelengths .",
    "the x - ray properties of cir  x-1 were found to differ dramatically each time it was observed ( see for example kaluzienski et  al .",
    "1976 , tennant 1988 , tsunemi et  al .",
    "1989 , shirey et  al .",
    "periodic modulation of the x - ray flux was found at a period of 16.6  d @xcite .",
    "a radio counterpart was found @xcite , and was found to flare at the same period as the x - ray modulation @xcite .",
    "these flares were initially detected at peak flux levels of @xmath3jy ; since the 1970s , the flux of the source has decreased dramatically , and it has only occasionally been detected above @xmath4mjy @xcite .",
    "this radio source is located @xmath5  from the centre of the supernova remnant g321.9@xmath60.3 , and is apparently connected to the remnant by a radio nebula @xcite .",
    "stewart et  al .",
    "have imaged arcmin - scale collimated structures within the surrounding nebula , suggesting an outflow from the x - ray binary .",
    "fender et  al .",
    "have imaged an arcsec - scale asymmetric jet aligned with these larger structures , raising the possibility that the outflow from the system is relativistic . recently ,",
    "case & bhattacharya have revised the estimated distance to g321.9@xmath60.3 ( and hence to cir  x-1 , assuming they are associated ) to @xmath7kpc , which is substantially smaller than the original suggested distance to cir  x-1 of @xmath8kpc @xcite .",
    "the discovery of type i x - ray bursts @xcite suggests that the compact object is probably a weakly - magnetised neutron star .",
    "the close association of cir  x-1 with the supernova remnant suggests that the system may be a young ( @xmath9  y old ) runaway system from a supernova explosion @xcite .",
    "the optical counterpart to cir  x-1 was identified as a highly - reddened star with strong h@xmath0  emission @xcite .",
    "this object was later shown to consist of three stars within a radius of 15 , the southernmost of which is the true counterpart ( @xcite ) .",
    "the long orbital period and periodic x - ray activity suggested a high - mass system in an eccentric orbit @xcite ; however , the variability of the optical emission , the faintness of the optical counterpart , and several of its x - ray characteristics suggest that the companion is a low - mass star .",
    "the lack of spectroscopic studies in the optical band means that most of the fundamental orbital parameters of cir  x-1 have not been determined .",
    "moreover , cir  x-1 shows very different properties from time to time .",
    "this make it difficult to construct a coherent picture for the system from observations of different wavelengths at different epochs .",
    "here we present new spectroscopic observations of cir  x-1 , and use these , together with analysis of archival observations of the system , to suggest a more coherent model for the system .",
    "cir  x-1 was observed on 1997 june 4 using the 3.9  m anglo - australian telescope ( aat ) .",
    "the mean orbital phase of the observation was 0.51 , calculated according the ephemeris of stewart et  al .   .",
    "the rgo spectrograph was used in combination with the tek 1k ccd in the 82  cm camera and a grating of 270 grooves@xmath10  in first order , resulting in a dispersion of @xmath11  over a wavelength range 60607165@xmath12 .",
    "the spatial scale was @xmath13 ; the spectral resolution , measured from the arc lines , was @xmath14 .",
    "a @xmath15-wide slit was used , oriented north - south so both cir  x-1 and star 2 of moneti were in the slit .",
    "the atmospheric seeing was about @xmath16 .",
    "five 1800@xmath12s integrations were taken , interspersed with cuar arc - lamp exposures , before cloud prevented the acquisition of any more data .    the bias and pixel - to - pixel gain variations were removed from each exposure using standard procedures in iraf .",
    "cosmic rays were removed using the method of croke to compare adjacent frames .",
    "because of the presence of the nearby confusing star ( moneti s star 2 ) , special care needed to be taken to measure the flux from our object . at every position along the dispersion direction , we fit two gaussian profiles , with fixed widths ( fwhm=5.6  pixels ) and separation ( 6 pixels ) , to the sky - subtracted frames .",
    "the amplitude of these gaussians was used as the estimate of the flux from cir  x-1 and star  2 at each wavelength .",
    "we then determined the wavelength calibration using the cuar arc lamp exposures .",
    "we fit a low - order polynomial to the arc line wavelengths as a function of pixel number : the rms scatter of the fits was @xmath17  of a pixel .",
    "a rough flux - calibration was performed by comparing with the spectrum of the observed flux standard ltt  4364 , though since the night was non - photometric , this flux calibration should be considered only approximate .",
    "@xmath18-band spectroscopy of cir  x-1 was obtained using the cryogenic array spectrometer / imager ( caspir ) on the anu 2.3  m telescope at siding spring observatory on the night of 1997 june 20 .",
    "the @xmath18  grism was used with the sbrc @xmath19  insb array , giving a dispersion of @xmath20  @xmath21  over a wavelength range of 1.942.49@xmath22 .",
    "the spatial scale was @xmath23 .",
    "a @xmath24  slit was used , oriented east - west : note that this means that moneti s stars 2 and 3 both contributed light in our spectrum .",
    "the telescope was nodded by @xmath25  along the slit to provide sky frames at the same position as the object .",
    "argon lamp spectra were taken to perform wavelength calibration , and two nearby bright stars ( bs  5699 and bs 5712 ) were observed in order to remove atmospheric spectral features and perform flux calibration .",
    "standard data reduction procedures were followed , using the local caspir package running in iraf .",
    "bias and dark frames were used to linearise all frames , the sky background was subtracted from the object frames , and pixel - to - pixel variations were corrected .",
    "the chip distortion was corrected in order to align the dispersion and spatial directions along rows and columns of the chip ; the sky background was then subtracted and spectra extracted .",
    "a low - order polynomial was fit to the argon lines , and these calibrations applied to the object spectra .",
    "flux calibration was achieved by dividing the observed spectra by the spectrum of a nearby mid g - type star and then multiplying by a model for the absolute flux distribution of the calibrator .",
    "residual terrestrial atmospheric features were then corrected using an early - type star .",
    "the optical spectrum is shown in fig .  [ fig : spectrum ] .",
    "the spectrum clearly shows three narrow emission lines  h@xmath0   @xmath266563 , he@xmath27i  @xmath266678 , and he@xmath27i  @xmath267065  as well as a broad component to the h@xmath0  line which is blue - shifted with respect to the narrow component .",
    "we fit gaussian models to these lines , using the specfit package in iraf .",
    "after normalising the spectrum by a low - order polynomial fit to the continuum , we fit a single gaussian to each of the helium lines and two gaussians to the h@xmath0  line .",
    "the velocities and widths of the three narrow lines are consistent with being the same ; we therefore constrained them to be equal .",
    "the details of the fit are shown in table  [ tab : optspec ] .",
    "the narrow lines show a velocity of @xmath28  and a width of @xmath29 , or @xmath30 , while the broad component to the h@xmath0  line has a very different velocity ( @xmath31 , or @xmath32  with respect to the narrow lines ) and width ( @xmath33 , or @xmath34 ) .",
    ".fit to the optical spectrum .",
    "the spectrum was normalised by a low - order polynomial fit to the continuum , and four gaussians were fit to the lines , subject to the constraint that the velocity and width of the three narrow lines were the same .",
    "the table shows the resultant velocities , fwhms , equivalent widths @xmath35  of the gaussians , and the de - reddened line luminosities , assuming a reddening of @xmath36  ( predehl & schmitt 1995 ) and a distance of @xmath7kpc ( case & bhattacharya 1998 ) . [ cols=\"<,>,<,>,<,>,<,^ \" , ]",
    "initially , it was suggested that cir  x-1 is a high mass binary consisting of a compact star ( either a neutron star or black hole ) and an ob supergiant companion star ( @xcite ) .",
    "its x - ray properties imply a very eccentric binary orbit .",
    "the 16.6-day modulation in the x - ray luminosity is due to orbital variations in the mass accretion of the compact star .",
    "the x - ray and radio bursts occur when the compact star encounters the dense stellar wind from the supergiant @xcite , or when tidal mass transfer is induced during the periastron passage @xcite .",
    "the type i x - ray bursts that were discovered in a brief epoch in the mid-1980s @xcite indicated that the compact star is a neutron star .",
    "recent observations ( e.g.  @xcite ) indicate that the companion star is unlikely to be a massive supergiant star .",
    "no type i bursts have yet been reported in rxte observations .    here , we propose a low - mass binary model , where the system consists of a neutron star orbiting around a subgiant companion star of about 3 to 5  ( fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] ; see also tennant & wu 1998 ) .",
    "the orbital eccentricity is @xmath370.9 . during the periastron passage ,",
    "the companion star overfills its roche - lobe , causing a transfer of mass at a super - eddington rate onto the neutron star . as cir x-1 is a x - ray burster ,",
    "the magnetic field of the neutron star is relatively weak , and so the accretion flow is probably quasi - spherical during the periastron passage . because of the large radiative pressure of emission from the neutron star , there must also be a strong ( anisotropic ) matter outflow .",
    "the inflow / outflow geometry may be related to the larger scale jets observed from the system , with symmetrical collimated outflows along some preferred axis .",
    "after the periastron passage , the companion star is detached from its critical roche - surface , and mass transfer ceases .",
    "accretion continues as the neutron star captures the residual matter in its roche - lobe .",
    "an accretion disc is gradually formed .",
    "the disc is geometrically thick , because the accretion rate is sufficiently high and is close to the eddington limit .",
    "the accretion becomes more steady when disc accretion takes over from the less stable super - eddington quasi - spherical accretion .",
    "accretion via a disc continues to operate till the next periastron passage , where the accretion disc is disrupted by tidal interaction . when the periastron passage proceeds , the companion star overfills its roche - lobe again , leading to another cycle of super - eddington mass transfer , formation of the accretion disc , steady accretion via the disc and disruption of the accretion disc .",
    "the periodic x - ray light curve of cir x-1 has changed dramatically since its discovery in the 70s ( e.g.   @xcite ) .",
    "this indicates that the accretion mode has varied substantially in the last 25 years . despite the fact that the h@xmath0  lines in the optical spectra obtained in the 70s and 90s show certain similarities , such as an asymmetric profile with a broad blue wing , it is inappropriate to assume that the optical spectra are the same at the same orbital phases in the 70s and the 90s .",
    "the fwhm of the red ( narrow ) component of the h@xmath0  line seems to decrease from @xmath38  in the 70s to @xmath39  in the 90s .",
    "the central wavelength , however , does not show significant velocity variation , and its average value is @xmath40 .",
    "our interpretation is that the red ( narrow ) component is emitted from irradiatively - heated matter which is relatively stationary with respect to the centre of mass of the system and has a low velocity dispersion .",
    "one of the natural choices is the heated surface of the companion star , on which the projected velocity of the matter is much less than the flow velocity near the neutron star .. however , we argue that the mass transfer rate has varied so much over the 21  y spanned by the observations that it is misleading to try to compare the equivalent widths . indeed , if we consider three groups of spectra near to each other in time ( 19761977 , 1978 , and 19951997 ) there is a ( slight ) tendency for the equivalent width to be highest at phase 0.5 .",
    "such a relation certainly needs to be confirmed . ]",
    "the velocity of the sharp red component of the h@xmath27i  br@xmath41  and the he@xmath27i  @xmath42  lines is @xmath43 , which is consistent with that for the optical lines .",
    "thus , the lines must also be emitted from a region relatively stationary to the centre - of - mass of the binary .",
    "the width of the ir lines , however , is much larger than the width of the optical lines .",
    "it is therefore unlikely that the emission site is the surface of the companion .",
    "one possibility is that these ir lines are emitted from a heated dust shell  the residue of ejecta from previous epochs .",
    "the observations accumulated since the 70s show that the broad component is blueward of the narrow component , except ( possibly ) in the 1978 april observation .",
    "the line widths were generally above 1000@xmath2 , and it was even larger than 2000@xmath2  in the 1976 and 1997 observations . although the line centre velocities appear to show large variations ( from @xmath44  to @xmath45 ) , they show no obvious correlation with orbital phase .",
    "we suspect that the broad component is related to the high velocity flow from regions near the neutron star .",
    "x - ray observations have shown that the rate of mass accretion onto the neutron star is above the eddington limit ( e.g.  inoue 1989 ) .",
    "it is therefore possible that an outflow is driven by the eddington luminosity .",
    "as we only see the blueward component , the lines are probably emitted from the optically thick outflowing matter , of which the red - shifted components are heavily absorbed or obscured .",
    "the changes in the line centre velocities and widths deduced from the fits are probably the result of the changes in optical depth over the different observational epochs .",
    "the quality of our data precludes us performing a fit of this model to the line profile ; rather , we present it as a possible explanation for the observed asymmetric line profile . we have constructed a simple toy model to demonstrate the asymmetric line profile that might be observed from such an outflow . in our model the broad line emission region is a spherically symmetric extended envelope , with outer and inner radii @xmath46  and @xmath47  respectively .",
    "the envelope encloses an opaque sphere with radius equal to @xmath47 .",
    "we have considered various functional forms for the velocity , emissivity and absorption coefficient distribution , and have found that models with a power - law velocity profile generally can produce a broad line profile similar to the observations ( see appendix ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : sim - main ] , we show a simulated a blue - shifted broad line from an expanding envelope with outer and inner radii , @xmath48  and @xmath49  respectively . the radial expanding speed @xmath50  has a power - law profile with an index of + 1 , and it is normalised such that its value is 1 at @xmath46 .",
    "the normalised local doppler width of the line is 0.1 .",
    "the emissivity is uniform within the emitting region , with @xmath51 . the continuum and line absorption coefficients are uniform , and their ratio @xmath52 .",
    "the total effective absorption optical depth @xmath53  is such that @xmath54 .",
    "as the narrow line is emitted from the heated companion star , we simply assume it is a gaussian with a width of 0.123 and a norm of 4.0 . this will give an approximate ratio of 2/3 for the equivalent widths of the simulated broad and narrow line components .",
    "as shown , the resultant line profiles resembles the h@xmath0  line observed in our june 1997 data .",
    "if we fit the simulated line with two gaussians and a constant , the relative widths and shifts of the two gaussian components are in good agreement with the fitted parameters of the june 1997 data ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sim - main ] ) .    the blue components of the h@xmath27i",
    "br@xmath41  and the he@xmath27i  @xmath55  lines have a velocity shift of @xmath56  and a width of @xmath57 .",
    "if we interpret the blue component of the ir lines as being emitted from the vicinity of the neutron star , the difference in the velocities between the optical and ir lines is due to optical depth effects and/or the uncertainties in determining the central velocities of the lines with the spectral resolution of the ir spectrum .",
    "murdin et  al",
    ".   assumed a 1  compact star , and by comparing the radius of various classes of stars with the separation of the two component star at periastron , they estimated the mass of the companion star and the orbital eccentricity for which tidally induced mass transfer can occur during the periastron passage . in our model , the mass transfer is driven by the overflow of the mass - donor star s roche - lobe instead of the stellar wind from the star , and it therefore requires the companion star to fill its roche - lobe at periastron , i.e.  the star s radius @xmath58  to be equal to or larger than its ` instantaneous ' critical roche - lobe surface .",
    "it is beyond the scope of this paper to derive an exact phase - dependent effective roche - lobe surface .",
    "however , as a first approximation , if we simply take the expression of the roche - lobe radius for circular systems ( see kopal 1959 ) and replace the orbital separation term by the separation between the two stars of cir x-1 at periastron , then we can obtain an effective roche - lobe radius at periastron ( phase  0 ) : @xmath59\\ ] ] where the mass ratio @xmath60  and @xmath61  is the semi - major axis . using this approximate expression for @xmath62 , we can constrain the appropriate parameter space ( @xmath63 ; @xmath64 , @xmath65 ) where roche - lobe overflow occurs during the periastron passage for various types of mass - donor stars .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : rlradius ] we show the mass - radius relation for supergiant , giant and main - sequence stars , together with @xmath66  for eccentric systems with a 16.6 day period and a 1.4  neutron star primary .",
    "if the companion star is a main sequence star , its mass is about 10  and the orbital eccentricity @xmath67  in order to fill its roche - lobe at periastron .",
    "a sub - giant star with @xmath68@xmath69  can easily fill its roche - lobe for an orbital eccentricity of about 0.70.9 .",
    "the argument for a low mass system is generally consistent with the combined results of our spectroscopic observations and the study on the effects of supernova kicks on neutron star binaries .",
    "a simulation study @xcite showed that the eccentricity of hmxbs ( with @xmath70 ) and lmxbs ( with @xmath71@xmath69 ) resulting from supernova explosions with isotropic kicks will be about 0.5 ( @xmath72 ) and 0.8 ( @xmath73 ) respectively if the final orbital period is about 16 days .",
    "the corresponding centre - of - mass velocities are 50 ( @xmath74 ) and 150 ( @xmath75)@xmath2 .",
    "if we accept the interpretation that the narrow line components originate from the heated companion star , the line - of - sight component of the centre - of - mass velocity of the system is about 350@xmath2 , or 430@xmath2after applying a correction for galactic rotation ( using the rotation curve of clemens 1985 ) .",
    "this correction was made assuming that the position of g321.9@xmath60.3 was the birthplace of cir  x-1 , but this makes little difference to the resulting correction . by combining with the transverse velocity ( @xmath76@xmath30 ) inferred from the age and the distance of the supernova remnant g321.9@xmath60.3 @xcite we obtain an estimated centre - of - mass velocity of @xmath77 .",
    "this velocity could be substantially higher , as it depends on the ( very uncertain ) age estimate of the supernova remnant ; transverse velocities as high as 1600@xmath2are possible @xcite .",
    "a velocity of @xmath77  is about 3@xmath78  from the mean centre - of - mass velocities obtained from the simulation study by brandt & podsiadlowski .",
    "such high velocities are not at all consistent with the simulations for high mass systems : even the low velocity is about 13@xmath78   above the mean velocity predicted for a high - mass system .",
    "the implied velocity for cir  x-1 makes it one of the fastest moving binaries known : radial velocities of @xmath79  have been measured for a handful of other lmxbs , e.g.  4u  1556@xmath6605 @xcite , gx  349 + 02 @xcite , 4u  1957 + 11 @xcite ; see johnston for a discussion .",
    "such velocities strengthen the identification of cir  x-1 as a low - mass system , as the fastest moving hmxbs have velocities @xmath80 .",
    "if the transverse velocity is similar to the radial velocity , this implies a proper motion of 15  @xmath81 ; in an ongoing project to measure the proper motion of the radio counterpart to cir  x-1 , we can measure a relative positional accuracy of around 40  mas , so we should measure the proper motion in a couple of years .",
    "an alternative simulation by shirey also concluded that cir  x-1 is a low - mass system .",
    "however , his simulation requires the system to be old ( @xmath82  y ) , which seems difficult to reconcile with the observations that cir  x-1 is associated with the supernova remnant g321.9@xmath60.3 .",
    "the rxte observations show that the current x - ray luminosity is quite steady in the orbital phases around 0.51.0 .",
    "the cycle - to - cycle variations are insignificant in comparison with the those at the earlier orbital phases .",
    "we interpret the steady accretion as due to the presence of an accretion disc .",
    "the erratic cycle - to - cycle luminosity variations are the consequence of the absence of the disc acting as a buffer ; cf .",
    "the rms fluctuations in the rxte data at phases 0.15 and 0.5 @xcite .",
    "moreover , we do not see double - horn features in the h@xmath0  line , such as those often observed in cataclysmic variables ( e.g.  @xcite ) or black hole binaries ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "this , together with the near - eddington luminosity of the x - rays during the disc - accretion phase , implies that the disc is non - keplerian and it is both geometrically and optically thick .",
    "as the matter is not tightly bound by the gravity of the neutron star , the large variation in the tidal force when the neutron star approaches periastron could easily disrupt the disc , causing a short temporal decrease in the accretion luminosity of the system .",
    "what constraints can we put on the age of the system ? in our model , mass transfer at periastron does not begin until the star has evolved from the main - sequence towards the giant branch . for a 35   star ,",
    "the subgiant stage may last @xmath83  y. if cir x-1 is associated with the nearby supernova remnant g321@xmath60.3 , then the implied age of the system as an eccentric neutron star binary is @xmath84  y. the eddington limit for the rate of mass transfer onto a neutron star is @xmath85 , giving a mass transfer time scale of @xmath86  y. since the companion star in cir x-1 can lose mass at a rate greater than this as an average in each orbital cycle , the life - span of the system as an x - ray binary is correspondingly shorter , but still comfortably above either the evolution time scale of the companion star or the age of the supernova remnant .",
    "we have detected strong optical and infrared emission lines in the spectrum of cir  x-1 ; the h@xmath0  and infrared lines are asymmetric , with a narrow component at a velocity of @xmath87  and a broader , blue - shifted component .",
    "archival optical observations show that an asymmetric h@xmath0  emission line has been in evidence for the past twenty years , although the shape of the line has changed significantly .",
    "the narrow component is always seen redwards of the broad component , at a velocity around 200@xmath30 ; the broad component has a much larger scatter of velocities .",
    "these properties are not consistent with the interpretation of mignani et  al .   , who suggested that the narrow component arises in an accretion disc , with the absence of a red component due to a phase - dependent shadowing effect .    instead , we suggest that the narrow component arises from the heated surface of the companion star , which is a subgiant of about 35 , while the broad component arises in an optically thick , high velocity outflow driven by super - eddington accretion onto the neutron star . during periastron passage , the companion star overfills its roche - lobe , causing a transfer of mass at a super - eddington rate , which in turn drives a strong matter outflow .",
    "after periastron , mass transfer from the companion ceases , but accretion continues at a near - eddington rate as the neutron star captures the residual matter in its roche - lobe .",
    "an accretion disc gradually forms , which is non - keplerian and geometrically thick .",
    "this change between quasi - spherical and disc accretion causes the change between strong x - ray variability near phase 0 and steady accretion between phases 0.51.0 .",
    "thus our observations are in general consistent with a low - mass binary model for the system . in this model ,",
    "the velocity of the narrow component reflects the space velocity of the binary ; the implied radial velocity ( + 430@xmath2 ) makes cir  x-1 one of the fastest moving binaries known .",
