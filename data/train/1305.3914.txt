    "research on those topics are being led by collaborations such as the araucaria @xcite , s@xmath4es @xcite , and carnegie hubble projects @xcite .",
    "the latter is the next generation follow - up to the hst key project to measure @xmath4 , and aims to reduce existing uncertainties ( @xmath5% ) to less than @xmath6% .",
    "the carnegie hubble project is relying partly on cepheids belonging to open clusters to achieve that objective @xcite , since the addition of such calibrators reduces uncertainties tied to extragalactic distances computed via leavitt s law .",
    "concerns regarding spurious cluster cepheids are warranted , and the calibration is under constant revision .",
    "however , those concerns can be mitigated by favoring calibrators exhibiting matching cluster and irsb distances @xcite , unless overwhelming evidence exists supporting the cluster cepheids in question ( e.g. , radial velocities and multiband photometry ) .",
    "considerable work remains to bolster the cluster cepheid calibration , and that includes improving parameters for existing cluster cepheids and searching for new calibrators @xcite .",
    "those objectives motivate the present study , as questions linger concerning qz nor , v340 nor , gu nor , and their link to ngc 6067 .",
    "@xcite hinted that gu nor may be a cluster member , but advocated that a reliable cluster distance and set of velocities were ultimately needed to reach a conclusion .",

    ". however , new irsb distances for qz nor @xcite are inconsistent with the distance to ngc 6067 , and four recent studies on cluster cepheids were split on overlooking @xcite or including qz nor as a calibrator @xcite .",
    "the first iteration of the carnegie hubble project likewise bypassed qz nor , but v340 nor was adopted as a calibrator .",
    "v340 nor lies near the center of ngc 6067 , whereas qz nor is offset by @xmath1 .",
    "that latter separation helped foster concerns regarding the cepheid s status as a cluster member .    in this study",

    "fourth , new @xmath10 photometry from the du pont telescope at las campanas observatory , in concert with new @xmath11 near - infrared @xmath12 photometry , are employed to establish a precise independent cluster distance , as sizable offsets exist between the @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite distances for ngc 6067 .",
    "the @xmath11 survey is a near - infrared campaign sampling part of the 4@xmath13 galactic quadrant where ngc 6067 is located @xcite .",

    "the analysis will dictate whether qz nor , v340 nor , or gu nor should be adopted as calibrators to anchor the cosmic distance scale ( e.g. , for the araucaria and s@xmath4es projects ) .",
    "such stars are an important means for establishing distances to local group galaxies and beyond @xcite , benchmarking standard candles and assessing the impact of compositional differences between target and calibrating stars @xcite , precisely defining the galactocentric metallicity and age gradients of the milky way and m31 @xcite , and constraining the behaviour of intermediate mass stars ( * ? ? ?",

    "data for gu nor were obtained by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "radial velocity measurements for the cepheids were phased with an arbitrary ephemeris , and corrections were made to adjust for period changes owing to stellar evolution @xcite .",
    "the pulsation periods adopted are from @xcite and @xcite .",

    "the fourier function applied is described by : @xmath14 .",
    "mean radial velocities determined for qz nor , v340 nor , and gu nor are : @xmath15 km / s .",
    "formal uncertainties deduced from the fourier fits for those velocities are misleading owing to potential offsets stemming from inhomogeneous standardization ( different instrumentation and reductions , e.g. , coravel cross - correlation ) , and binarity .",
    "qz nor and v340 nor exhibit @xmath16 km / s scatter in the denser sampled regions of the velocity curves , and that value is a more apt indication of the uncertainty . concerning gu nor , the phase coverage for the velocity data is nt satisfactory , and the fourier fit may misrepresent the extrema .",

    "* see the velocity curve for the cepheid dl cas ) .",
    "alternatively , it has been suggested that the radial velocity offset for gu nor could indicate that the star was ejected from ngc 6067 .",

    "radial velocities for younger stellar targets can be a reliable distance indicator along certain sight - lines , provided the objects partake in galactic rotation : @xmath19 , where @xmath20 .",
    "the velocity - distance gradient is rather steep ( @xmath21 km / s / kpc ) for the line of sight toward ngc 6067 ( @xmath9 , fig .",

    "conversely , certain sight - lines , such as toward the cluster westerlund 2 ( @xmath22 ) , display rather shallow gradients and velocity - distance degeneracies ( fig .  [ fig - rvp ] ) . hence determining the distance to westerlund 2 based on kinematic evidence",
    "is somewhat more complicated , a fact which is partly responsible for the spread in cited cluster distances ( 2 - 8 kpc , * ? ? ? * and discussion therein ) . for the present analysis",
    "the absolute value from the velocity - distance correlation is unimportant , as various uncertainties promulgate into the determination ( e.g. , distance to the galactic center and the rotation model adopted , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "rather it is the magnitude of the velocity - distance gradient that is pertinent .",
    "a steep gradient implies that two objects along the sight - line that share common velocities are nearly equidistant .",
    "a pronounced gradient likewise mitigates uncertainties arising from typically imprecise velocity determinations for earlier - type cluster stars associated with cepheids , since those stars exhibit broad spectral lines ( rotation and v - iv luminosity class ) .",
    "the latter is nt relevant here given the cluster ( conveniently ) hosts numerous red giants @xcite , which were used to compute a precise mean velocity .        figs .",
    "[ fig - rvc ] and [ fig - rvp ] imply that qz nor , v340 nor , and ngc 6067 are nearly equidistant , whereas gu nor lies in the foreground .",
    "that conclusion is supported by evaluating first - order distances to the cepheids using existing period - wesenheit ( @xmath23 ) relations , which provide a consistency check .",
    "a recent iteration of the galactic @xmath23 wesenheit function is that cited by @xcite ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . that iteration is tied principally to the efforts of fellow researchers : the cluster cepheid calibrators of @xcite , and the hst parallax cepheid calibrators of @xcite",
    "parameters for the cluster cepheids tw nor , su cas , @xmath24 cep , and @xmath25 gem have since been revised ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and continued revisions are expected .",
    "nevertheless , to avoid biasing the analysis , distances are computed using a wesenheit function tied solely to the @xcite data .",
    "the resulting distances are 1.9 kpc , 1.8 kpc , and 1.4 kpc for v340 nor , qz nor ( first overtone ) , and gu nor ( fundamental ) accordingly ( formal uncertainties are on the order of @xmath26 kpc ) . photometry used to compute those distances was taken from the compilation of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the wesenheit distances are sensitive to the pulsation mode adopted .",
    "v340 nor ( @xmath27 ) is a fundamental mode pulsator , since overtone pulsators terminate near @xmath28 in the magellanic clouds ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* see the latter s figs .  5 & 6 ) , and the longest - period overtone pulsator _ known _ in the galaxy may be v440 per ( @xmath29 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for qz nor ( @xmath30 )",
    "the matter is more complicated .",
    "the lightcurve describing qz nor is sinusoidal - like ( fig .",
    "[ fig - lc ] ) , which is often argued to be a signature of overtone pulsation ( * ? ? ?",

    "* and discussion therein ) .",
    "su cas also features a sinusoidal - like lightcurve ( fig .",
    "[ fig - lc ] ) , and is constrained to be an overtone pulsator via its membership in alessi 95 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* see also @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , the _ majority _ of magellanic cloud cepheids exhibiting sinusoidal - like lightcurves occupy the wesenheit locus tied to overtone pulsators . however , there are instances ( owing to photometric contamination , peculiarities , or otherwise ) whereby sinusoidal - like magellanic cloud cepheids lie on the wesenheit ridge tied to fundamental mode cepheids .",
    "there exists also the cases of the enigmatic galactic cepheids ff aql and polaris , which some argue to be fundamental mode pulsators despite displaying sinusoidal - like lightcurves .",
    "the @xcite hst parallax implies that ff aql is a fundamental mode pulsator , while the hipparcos parallax favors overtone pulsation @xcite .",
    "similarly , @xcite argue on the basis of spectroscopic line ratios that polaris @xmath31 value is indicative of fundamental mode pulsation , whereas the hipparcos parallax supports overtone pulsation @xcite . however , the velocity evidence ( fig .",
    "[ fig - rvc ] ) and velocity - distance gradient ( fig .",
    "[ fig - rvp ] ) constrain qz nor as an overtone pulsator , given its similar velocity to v340 nor and ngc 6067 . in  [ s - parameters ]",
    ", it is shown that new multiband photometry implies a distance for ngc 6067 of @xmath32 kpc , which matches the aforementioned ( first - order ) wesenheit distances .",
    "qz nor lies @xmath1 from the center of ngc 6067 , and that separation has helped fuel concerns toward adopting the cepheid as a calibrator .",
    "the cluster s extent was evaluated as follows .",
    "2mass data were used for the analysis since the cluster s brighter b - type stars , which rise prominently above the field in the color - magnitude diagram , are saturated in the deeper @xmath11 data .",
    "the b - stars emerge over the field population partly because of the imf ( initial mass function ) , which dictates that such stars are rare relative to later - type stars .",
    "later - type cluster dwarfs are typically more difficult to separate from field stars . thus to construct the radial profile , and increase the contrast with the background population , only earlier b - type stars were used .",
    "@xmath10 data were not examined since that photometry is restricted to a smaller field of view , whereas 2mass is all - sky .",
    "an analysis of the 2mass data reveals that the cluster exhibits both a sizable demographic and extent ( fig .",
    "[ fig - r ] ) .",
    "the richness of the cluster ensures that the statistics are sufficient to extract solid conclusions . at the position of qz nor , some @xmath1 from cluster center , the population of ngc 6067 is larger than the background .",
    "the counts do not level - off sharply , which may indicate the breadth of the cluster s coronal region @xcite and its dissolution into the field .",

    "@xcite determined the distance to ngc 6067 based on zams fitting , kinematic evidence , and spectroscopic parallaxes .",

    "the latter applied the color ratio extrapolation method to mid - infrared wise - spitzer data .      to determine the cluster distance an isochrone was shifted in magnitude space to match the observed data , since the color - excess was determined above and abundance estimates for the cluster cepheids are near solar @xcite .",
