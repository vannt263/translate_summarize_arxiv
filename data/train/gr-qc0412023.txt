    "various studies of the dynamics of scalar fields in black hole spacetimes have been done by many researchers in literature .",
    "most of these that relate to super - radiance and unstable behavior have been performed in the frequency - domain @xcite@xcite , while time - domain based work has only recently picked up momentum @xcite @xcite @xcite .",
    "consider the scattering of a wave ( massless scalar , electromagnetic or gravitational ) off a kerr black hole .",
    "generically , we expect that the incident wave would be partly reflected by the hole and propagate outward while the remaining would go down into the hole",
    ". however , under conditions of super - radiance , the reflected wave emerges amplified compared to the original incident wave ! in this case of super - radiant scattering , energy and angular momentum flow out of the hole and it has been proposed @xcite to use this effect to create a `` black hole bomb '' . to create a bomb , one places `` mirrors '' surrounding the kerr hole , and they cause the amplified scattered outgoing wave to simply get reflected back to the hole which causes amplification again .",
    "this process continues on and we ultimately obtain an unbounded growth in the amplitude of the wave . in the next section of this article",
    "we demonstrate this effect using a massless scalar and also an electromagnetic wave packet in kerr spacetime using time - domain black hole perturbation theory ( teukolsky equation @xcite ) .    it has also been shown that if one uses a massive scalar field instead , the mass of the field itself provides a natural mirror @xcite@xcite .",
    "the main reason for this can be seen by examining the form of the potential function for large @xmath0 .",
    "if we write the klein - gordon equation in a black hole background in terms of a function that scales the field by a factor of @xmath0 , its radial part resembles the 1-dimensional wave equation with a potential , @xmath1 . at large @xmath0 , @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the frequency of the field and @xmath4 its mass .",
    "if @xmath5 then the field would be outgoing , i.e. @xmath6 , however , if @xmath7 then the field would fall off at large @xmath0 , i.e. @xmath8 . now ,",
    "if the super - radiant condition is satisfied then the field is amplified , but can not be radiated away ( assuming @xmath9 ) thus causing the instability .    in this article , we will study this instability arising from the super - radiant scattering of a massive scalar field off a kerr black hole .",
    "we perform this study using black hole perturbation theory in the time - domain i.e. using a numerical teukolsky code @xcite .",
    "we present temporal profiles of the unstable scalar field and also estimate the growth rate of the instability .",
    "we compare our time - domain based results with past results based on frequency - domain calculations .",
    "in this section , we will demonstrate the unbounded growth of the amplitude of a massless scalar and also an electromagnetic wave packet in the context of super - radiant scattering off a kerr black hole which is surrounded by perfect mirrors .",
    "we will solve the teukolsky equation to study the behavior of the fields in the time - domain .",
    "this equation in boyer - lindquist coordinates , appears below .",
    "@xmath10 \\partial_{tt}- \\frac{4 m a r}{\\delta}\\partial_{t\\varphi } -2s\\left[r+ia\\cos\\theta-\\frac{m(r^2-a^2)}{\\delta}\\right]\\partial_t \\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\,\\delta^{-s}\\partial_r\\left(\\delta^{s+1}\\partial_r\\right ) + \\frac{1}{\\sin\\theta}\\partial_\\theta\\left(\\sin\\theta\\partial_\\theta\\right ) + \\left[\\frac{1}{\\sin^2\\theta}-\\frac{a^2}{\\delta}\\right ] \\partial_{\\varphi\\varphi } \\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\ , 2s \\left[\\frac{a ( r - m)}{\\delta } + \\frac{i \\cos\\theta}{\\sin^2\\theta } \\right ] \\partial_\\varphi -\\left(s^2 \\cot^2\\theta -s \\right)\\biggr\\}\\psi=0,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is the mass of the black hole , @xmath12 its kerr parameter , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 is the spin - weight of the field .",
    "we use a @xmath16 dimensional teukolsky evolution code @xcite in which one performs the numerical integration of the resulting equation upon decomposing the above equation into azimuthal angular modes .",
    "the boundary conditions used by the numerical code correspond to `` ingoing '' fields at the horizon and zero ( `` perfect mirror '' ) at the outer - boundary .",
    "this code exhibits convergence as has been indicated before in the literature @xcite .",
    "next , we will discuss the condition of so - called , super - radiance . if we consider a wave of frequency @xmath3 at the horizon , its spatial dependence is of the form , @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the azimuthal mode of the wave and @xmath19 is the angular velocity of the event horizon of the hole , given by @xmath20 ( where @xmath21 ) .",
    "for the physical boundary condition of `` ingoing '' wave , we insist on a negative group velocity , and therefore choose the fields to have a form , @xmath22 .",
    "however , note that if @xmath23 then the phase velocity will be positive ! this is the super - radiance condition and it implies that energy and angular momentum are being extracted from the hole .    imposing a condition on frequency is difficult when attempting a time - domain evolution , however we use the idea of an `` almost monochromatic '' wave - packet as presented in @xcite .",
    "specifically , we assume that the initial pulse ( @xmath24 ) is centered far away from the hole at @xmath25 and that the modulation frequency is @xmath3 .",
    "therefore , @xmath26 in our evolutions , we chose @xmath27 , @xmath28 and a black hole background with @xmath29 .",
    "note that the @xmath3 chosen is in the super - radiant regime .",
    "the wave packet should have a wide spatial spread , so as to minimize the frequency overlap with the non - super - radiant regime .",
    "therefore we chose , @xmath30 .",
    "the initial time derivative of the field was chosen so as to make this packet `` ingoing '' .",
    "the numerical code related parameters , i.e. location of the inner boundary and the location of the outer boundary , where chosen to be @xmath31 and @xmath32 respectively .",
    "typical grid resolution used for the radial coordinate was @xmath33 , while it was @xmath34 for the polar angle coordinate .",
    "the results of our computation appear in figures 1 and figures 2 below .",
    "the plotted waveforms were extracted at @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "it clear from the results that when @xmath3 is chosen to be in the super - radiance regime , a black hole bomb is created .",
    "the amplitude of the fields clearly grows without bound .",
    "[ mirror1 ]     [ mirror2 ]",
    "in this section , we will demonstrate the unbounded growth of the amplitude of a massive scalar wave packet in the context of super - radiant scattering off a kerr black hole .",
    "we use the same basic formalism as in the previous section .",
    "we simply add a mass term to the teukolsky equation of the form @xmath37 and use the same numerical code with this minor modification .",
    "we conducted a detailed convergence test on this modified code . in summary ,",
    "the code exhibits second - order convergence to about @xmath38 , and then its convergence order decreases slowly and settles to a bit above first - order at very late times .. ]    to witness the instability in this case , in addition to satisfying the super - radiance condition , @xmath39 , the frequency of the wave - packet also needs to satisfy the condition , @xmath40 . as argued in the introduction section of this article , this is necessary because it ensures that the field can not be radiated away .",
    "the condition @xmath9 forces the fields at large @xmath0 to decay exponentially with @xmath0 , thereby `` trapping '' it in the system i.e. the mass plays the role of a natural mirror .",
    "the field grows because of super - radiance , but is a bound - state , and that is the reason it becomes unstable .    for the initial pulse , again we chose data of the form indicated in equation [ i d ] .",
    "this time , we chose @xmath41 , @xmath28 and a black hole background with @xmath29 .",
    "the mass of the scalar field is chosen to be @xmath42 , and with these choices the conditions for instability are satisfied .",
    "we again chose the wave - packet to have a wide spread , @xmath30 .",
    "the location of the inner boundary and the location of the outer boundary , where chosen to be @xmath31 and @xmath43 respectively .",
    "the outer boundary condition was chosen to be that for `` outgoing '' fields .",
    "note that as much as possible , we use frequencies that are integer multiples of each other to avoid excessive mixing or `` beats '' because that makes studying the late - time behavior of the fields difficult .    the results from this evolution ( @xmath24 ) appear in figure 3 .",
    "the data has been extracted from the spatial location , @xmath44 and @xmath36 .",
    "the plot clearly demonstrates the presence of an instability although its growth is very slow .",
    "because of the slow growth , it is difficult to judge the functional form of the growth ( exponential , power - law , etc . )",
    "however , one can obtain the `` local '' linear growth rate by computing the slope of the envelope of the depicted growing oscillations .",
    "we estimate that this rate to be about @xmath45 from our results .",
    "if we assume that the growth is actually exponential , this would translate to an e - folding time of about @xmath46 . from the perspective of the size of our computation ( recall",
    ", we are evolving a @xmath16 dimensional code ) this e - folding time is very large . it would take a non - trivial effort to make suitable modifications to the numerical method used by our code to accurately run that long .",
    "it would also require tremendous amount of computational power .",
    "therefore , we leave that open for sometime in the future . we may also attempt a survey of the parameter space , in order to understand the dependence of the growth rate on the parameters , although that may be best done in the frequency - domain ( see , for example @xcite ) .",
    "also , it should be noted that the results we have appear to be two orders of magnitude larger than the approximate growth rates that have been computed from the frequency - domain based computations . in particular ,",
    "the e - folding time can be computed @xcite , using @xmath47 which turns out to be @xmath48 for the parameters relevant to our case .",
    "we attribute this apparent discrepancy to the use of the approximation , @xmath49 used in deriving above expression which does not quite apply to our choice of parameters .",
    "unfortunately , we are unable to make a comparison with a significantly lower value of @xmath50 because that would increase the e - folding time tremendously , and we would be unable to make an estimate of such a small growth rate because of the relatively short time - scale of our evolutions .",
    "[ instability ]    we also show results from the case in which the only change we make is changing the sign of the frequency of the initial wave packet i.e. set @xmath51 .",
    "this @xmath3 violates the super - radiance condition and therefore , we no longer expect to see an instability . and",
    "that is indeed what the figure 4 indicates .",
    "[ noinstability ]    in figure 5 we show similar results from the evolution of the @xmath52 mode .",
    "we used @xmath53 , @xmath54 and all the other parameters were left at the same values as before .",
    "the growth rate of the instability in this case , is about an order of magnitude lower than the @xmath24 case above .",
    "[ instability2 ]",
    "using a time - domain @xmath16 dimensional teukolsky code we have been able to demonstrate that under conditions of super - radiance , a black hole bomb can be constructed using `` artificial '' or `` natural '' mirrors .",
    "we demonstrated that massless scalar and electromagnetic wave packets grow without bound if they satisfy the condition of super - radiance , as they scatter off a kerr hole that is surrounded by mirrors .",
    "we also demonstrated the result of using a natural mirror , i.e. the mass of a scalar field to the achieve the same effect .",
    "unfortunately , since the growth rate of the instability is very low , it was only possible to make a very crude estimate of the e - folding time .",
    "however , even with the results we obtained , it seems that the growth rate of the instability could be two orders of magnitude larger than what was known before , which could have some interesting astrophysical implications .",
