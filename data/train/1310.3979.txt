    "the study of the influence of random impurities , disorder and random anisotropy on the magnetic properties of crystalline materials is an often studied and therefore an extremely well established subject of condensed matter physics @xcite . in contrast , the theoretical study of the consequences of glassy randomness on the interaction between mechanical and magnetic properties in amorphous solids like metallic glasses is still in its infancy . in this paper",
    "we study an interesting effect that has been discovered in our group via numerical simulations ; an amorphous magnetic solid with random local anisotropy quenched from the liquid in the presence of a magnetic field has an initial magnetic moment ( which is zero in the absence of magnetic field ) , cf .",
    "[ numeffect ] .",
    "but when subjected to an external mechanical strain the magnetic moment can increase with the accumulation of plastic events .",
    "the magnetization increases to a steady state level that depends on the relative magnitude of the magnetic field compared to the other parameters in the problem .",
    "needless to say , this effect is particular to glassy systems in which the position of particles is free to adjust under mechanical strains and plastic irreversibility ; its study requires models that combine glassiness , magnetism and randomness .    in sect . [ model ]",
    "we present the model that we use to study the interaction between mechanical and magnetic responses in amorphous solids @xcite . in sect .",
    "[ effect ] we present the numerical results of the effect under discussion .",
    "we show that when the magnetic field is non - zero , the magnetization increases to a steady - state value that depends on the magnetic field . in sect .",
    "[ ss ] we offer a theory for the steady - state value of the magnetization . in sect .",
    "[ mvsg ] we present a mean field theory for the actual trajectory of the magnetization as a function of external strain , and present some non - trivial predictions of the theory . sect .",
    "[ conclude ] contains a summary of the paper and some concluding remarks .",
    "the model we employ is in the spirit of the harris , plischke and zuckerman ( hpz ) hamiltonian @xcite but with a number of important modifications to conform with the physics of amorphous magnetic solids @xcite .",
    "first , our particles are not pinned to a lattice .",
    "we write the hamiltonian as @xmath0 where @xmath1 are the 2-d positions of @xmath2 particles in an area @xmath3 and @xmath4 are spin variables .",
    "the mechanical part @xmath5 is chosen to represent a glassy material with a binary mixture of 65% particles a and 35% particles b , with lennard - jones potentials having a minimum at positions @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 for the corresponding interacting particles @xcite .",
    "these values are chosen to guarantee good glass formation and avoidance of crystallization .",
    "the energy parameters chosen are @xmath9 @xmath10 , in units for which the boltzmann constant equals unity .",
    "all the potentials are truncated at distance 2.5@xmath11 with two continuous derivatives .",
    "particles a carry spins @xmath4 ; the b particles are not magnetic .",
    "we choose the spins @xmath4 to be classical @xmath12 spins ; the orientation of each spin is then given by an angle @xmath13 .",
    "we also denote by @xmath14 the local preferred easy axis of anisotropy , and end up with the magnetic contribution to the potential energy in the form @xcite : @xmath15 here @xmath16 and the sums are only over the a particles that carry spins . for a discussion of the physical significance of each term the reader is referred to ref .",
    "it is important however to stress that in our model ( in contradistinction with the hpz hamiltonian @xcite and also with the random field ising model @xcite ) , the exchange parameter @xmath17 is a function of a changing inter - particle position ( either due to external strain or due to non - affine particle displacements , and see below ) .",
    "thus randomness in the exchange interaction is coming from the random positions @xmath18 , whereas the function @xmath17 is not random .",
    "we choose for concreteness the monotonically decreasing form @xmath19 where @xmath20 with @xmath21 .",
    "this choice cuts off @xmath22 at @xmath23 with two smooth derivatives . in our case @xmath24 .",
    "another important difference is that in our case the local axis of anisotropy @xmath25 is _ not _ selected from a pre - determined distribution , but is determined by the local structure : define the matrix @xmath26 : @xmath27 the matrix @xmath26 has two eigenvalues in 2-dimensions that we denote as @xmath28 and @xmath29 , @xmath30 .",
    "the eigenvector that belongs to the larger eigenvalue @xmath28 is denoted by @xmath31 .",

    "( [ kk ] ) ensures that for an isotropic distribution of particles @xmath36 . due to the glassy random nature of our material the direction",
    "@xmath25 is random .",
    "in fact we will assume below ( as can be easily tested in the numerical simulations ) that the angles @xmath25 are distributed randomly in the interval @xmath37 $ ] .",
    "it is important to note that external straining does not change this flat distribution and we will assert that the probability distribution @xmath38 can be simply taken as @xmath39 the last term in eq .",

    "we have chosen @xmath41 in the range [ -0.08,0.08 ] . at the two extreme values",
    "all the spins are aligned along the direction of @xmath42 .",
    "the novel effect that is the subject of this paper is described as follows : we prepare the system described by the hamiltonian ( [ umech ] ) in a fluid state at a high temperature ( @xmath43 in units of @xmath44 where the boltzmann constant is fixed at unity ) . in this paper",
    "the system is 2-dimensional , containing @xmath45 particles .",
    "the system is then quenched to @xmath46 with molecular dynamics , and finally brought to an inherent state using gradient energy minimization @xcite _ in the presence of a magnetic field @xmath40 directed in the @xmath47 direction _ .",
    "all the subsequent simulation are performed at @xmath46 .",
    "we strain the system using simple shear , such that at each step of strain @xmath48 the particles are first subjected to an affine transformation @xmath49 where @xmath50 .",
    "subsequent to the affine step the system is again relaxed to equilibrium using energy gradient minimization @xcite .",
    "this procedure of athermal , quasi - static strain ( aqs ) is continued until we reach the desired values of the strain @xmath51 .",
    "the procedure is applied either in the absence of magnetic field ( @xmath52 ) or at any chosen value of @xmath42 which is always directed in the @xmath47 direction .",
    "immediately after the quench from the liquid at @xmath53 the magnetic moment @xmath54 has a value that depends on the magnetic field @xmath40 , @xmath55 . denoting the number of spin carrying particles as @xmath56 we write",
    "quite generally @xmath57 the effect of interest here is what happens to @xmath54 as we begin to strain the system in the aqs procedure .",
