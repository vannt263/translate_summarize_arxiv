    "the application of the constituent quark model to mesons and baryons has been very successful , in spite of various nonrelativistic approximations .",
    "how much is neglected in these approximations ?",
    "generalization of the ordinary schrdinger equation to a relativistic covariant form results in the well - known bethe - salpeter equation ( bse ) , which differs from the nonrelativistic equation in two respects .",
    "firstly , the dependence of the bound state wave function on the relative three - momentum @xmath0 becomes a dependence on the four - momentum @xmath1 .",
    "secondly , covariance requires that for fermions the full dirac structure is taken into account , so for quarks not only the positive energy states are to be considered , but also their negative energy states must be included . in this paper",
    "we investigate the effect on the meson mass spectrum of the inclusion of these negative energy states in the relativistic constituent quark model .",
    "quasi - potential ( qp ) approximations to the bse exist which eliminate the @xmath2-dependence of the quark - propagators , and moreover circumvent the problem of introducing a confining potential in the full minkowski space .",
    "the covariant dirac structure is kept in these . in previous work",
    "@xcite , to which we shall refer as i and ii , we used two qp models to calculate the full meson mass spectrum .",
    "one of the biggest differences found with the schrdinger approach was the much stronger confinement needed and the sensitivity of the mass spectrum to small vector contributions to the confining potential .",
    "to get some more insight about the various aspects we have performed calculations in the same framework but with leaving out various negative energy states .",
    "this enables us to trace back and understand the origin of the phenomena found in i and ii and to establish the importance of the negative energy states . for simplicity",
    "the calculations are restricted to the equal mass case .    in the next section the model",
    "is briefly summarized and some of the qp equations properties which give upper bounds on the parameters of the potential are discussed . section iii deals with the truncation of the relativistic qp equations in the coordinate represention with regards to the negative energy spinor states .",
    "it also presents the comparison of the calculations with corresponding nonrelativistic predictions .",
    "in particular the u and cc spectra are considered in various approximations to various qp models .",
    "differences in the spectra are discussed .",
    "finally , the paper closes with some concluding remarks .",
    "we briefly describe the relativistic constituent quark model as was studied in i and ii .",
    "the model consists of two point - like fermions bound together by a phenomenological potential @xmath3 to form a meson .",
    "the meson wave function @xmath4 satisfies @xmath5 the dependence of the propagator @xmath6 on the relative four - momentum @xmath1 has been simplified to a dependence on the three - momentum . in i",
    "we studied two qp approximations which eliminate the dependence of the equation on @xmath2 , the blankenbecler - sugar - logunov - tavkhelidze ( bslt ) approximation @xcite , and an equal - time ( et ) approximation @xcite .",
    "they give for quarks of equal mass in the center of mass system @xmath7,\\ ] ] and @xmath8 where @xmath9 , and @xmath10 , @xmath11 being the total meson mass .",
    "the @xmath12 project upon positive and negative energy states , @xmath13 with @xmath14 let us define the eigenstates of these projection operators by @xmath15 the subscript @xmath16 is used to distinguish these plane wave states from the canonical positive and negative states defined through @xmath17 which correspond to the various combinations of upper and lower components of the dirac spinors .",
    "clearly @xmath18    the instantaneous interaction @xmath3 between the quarks is modeled as the sum of a coulomb - like part describing the one - gluon - exchange ( oge ) interaction and a linearly rising part for the confinement .",
    "it takes in coordinate space the form @xmath19 . \\label{pp5}\\ ] ] the vector contribution to the interaction is studied in the feynman gauge as well as in the coulomb gauge : @xmath20.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this defines the relativistic quasi - potential model . note that we do allow for a fraction @xmath21 of vector - confinement .",
    "the running coupling constant behaves as @xmath22 for small distances @xmath23 , and grows to some maximum saturation value @xmath24 for large separations , according to the interpolation given in i.    the resulting wave equation were studied extensively in coordinate space .",
    "it should be noted that certain difficulties as found in the one particle dirac equation should be expected in such a relativistic quasi - potential approach .",
    "let us for a moment consider one fermion in an external potential .",
    "if this particle experiences a potential which fluctuates more strongly than @xmath25 over a distance shorter than its compton length @xmath26 new fermion - antifermion pairs can be created .",
    "this phenomenon can not correctly be described by the dirac equation which describes a one - particle theory and thus misses the interactions between the newly created pair and the starting particle .",
    "since the dirac equation does allow for antifermion components , solutions in this potential can have an unbound number of non - interacting fermions and antifermions thus being unnormalizable and unphysical .",
    "this break - down of the dirac equation is well - known as the klein paradox @xcite .",
    "similar flaws emerge in the qp equations of this work since they also contain negative energy components . in view of the complexity of the various two - body equations we do not fully analyze under what conditions they break down . instead , let us note that unbound solutions can be expected if the confining strength becomes too strong , @xmath27 or @xmath28 .",
    "this domain can be reached in light meson systems .",
    "the condition on @xmath29 depends on the fraction @xmath21 of vector confinement as indicated by the discussion in i. similarly , if the oge potential becomes too strong , @xmath30 or @xmath31 , irregular solutions may be expected .",
    "mesons with high orbital angular momenta are less sensitive to this effect because the centrifugal barrier prevents them from entering the short distance region .",
    "if a running coupling constant is taken instead of a fixed one then the irregular solutions disappear and the singular behavior becomes less . whereas the upper bound on @xmath29 disappears as the negative energy components are removed , the upper bound on @xmath32 is shifted upward but still present , reflecting that only positive energy states can also tumble in a oge potential .",
    "detailed discussions on the short distance behavior was given in i and ii .",
    "since the wave equations as described in the previous section are solved in the coordinate space using the representation of the canonical states eq .",
    "( [ can ] ) , a convenient way to switch off the coupling to the negative energy plane wave states is to explicitly project out these states in the interaction .",

    "if @xmath35 is put to zero then the single negative energy states are projected to zero , provided @xmath36 , and similarly for @xmath37 when we want to drop the coupling to the @xmath38 states in the calculations .",
    "one can rewrite the et equation in a similar way : @xmath39 \\psi = } \\nonumber\\\\ & & -\\left [ \\lambda^{++ } + i_\\flat(\\lambda^{+-}+\\lambda^{-+ } ) + i_{\\flat\\flat}\\lambda^{-- } \\right ] \\gamma_0^{(1 ) } \\gamma_0^{(2 ) } v \\psi .",

    "this gives a set of coupled integral - differential equations which are reduced to a set of linear equations by expanding the wave function on a set of spline functions .",
    "the resulting matrix equation for the various spline coefficients can be solved straightforwardly by standard methods . as a check on the accuracy of our calculational procedures we used this method to calculate the charmonium mass spectrum in the model of hirano _ et@xmath40al .",

    "it is given by @xmath65.\\ ] ] this potential , however , does not give an accurate approximation since for large distances @xmath66 is not a small enough parameter to expand in .    to obtain the explicit form of the bslt propagator we may replace @xmath67 this leads to the bslt equation restricted to only positive energy states . figs .",
    "1d and 2d show how the masses are increased .",
    "figure 1e shows the effect of the introduction of the single negative energy states @xmath68 and @xmath69 . for the light mesons we do not show this case since for some mesons",
    "it leads to unbound systems , similar to the klein paradox mentioned in the previous section .",
    "the introduction of these states leads to an increase of the cc spectrum by up to 0.10 gev .",
    "they are mostly made out of @xmath70 and @xmath71 states which have a negative expectation value of scalar confinements , eq .",
    "( [ pp6 ] ) .",
    "together with the negative propagation of these states this leads to a positive interaction which raises the mass levels .    finally , if the @xmath38 states are included",
    ", one arrives at the full bslt spectra shown in figs .",
    "1f and 2e . the inclusion of these states changes little ( @xmath72 1 mev for cc ) , as could be expected from their smallness . the lowest lying mesons , however ,",
    "are considerably influenced what is related to the singular behavior of the wave function at small distances .",
    "the oge potential concentrates the wave function to small distances with strong potential , thus lowering the mass levels .",
    "the singular behavior becomes stronger if more negative energy states are included or if the level of excitation is less .",
    "1 g shows the charmonium spectrum in the salpeter approximation , which includes only the @xmath41 and @xmath38 states .",
    "the small masses for the low lying excitations are still present , but the increase associated with the single negative states is absent .",
    "let us briefly discuss what effects are found if we use the equal time ( et ) propagator . in fig .  3",
    "is shown the corresponding charmonium spectrum calculated with the same parameters as fig .  1 .",
    "three differences can be noted .",
    "firstly , the et spectrum is lowered as compared to the bslt one .",
    "this is a consequence of the different propagators for the @xmath41 states [ cf .",
    "( [ pp7 ] ) ] .",
    "secondly , the introduction of the single negative energy states causes a shift upwards in the et model which is approximately twice that seen in bslt .",
    "this is due to the fact that these states are roughly twice as important in the et wave function as in the bslt one in view of a twice as large propagator for these states , @xmath73 versus @xmath74 .",
    "thirdly , the @xmath38 energy states lower the singlet states much more strongly in the et model than in bslt . again , this is a consequence of the importance of these states in the et wave function .",
    "they are larger due to the large @xmath75 propagator .",
    "as already remarked in @xcite , this is a defect of the et equation when an unretarded potential is used , and this disappears if the proper retardation is inserted in the matrix elements for @xmath3 that connect to double negative energy states .",
    "however , it should be stressed that there is no unambigious extension of the instantaneous confining potential to retarded times .",
    "in i we discussed the large raising of the light meson spectrum when a part of vector confinement is added to a scalar confining potential .",
    "4 shows the u spectrum for various dynamical models using scalar confinement without and with a vector contribution .",
    "when only positive energy states are taken the raising is even more stronger , and can almost double some meson masses .    in fig .",
    "4 are also shown the same spectrum if the vector contribution is taken in the feynman gauge , eq .",
    "( [ pp8 ] ) . in this gauge",
    "the spin - spin interaction is less suppressed so the vector contribution has more effect .",
    "in summary , we have calculated for the light and charmonium systems mass spectra using the ( relativized ) schrdinger equation and the relativistic quasi - potential equations of i and ii , which differ from the schrdinger approach in that no @xmath46 approximation is made , and that the qp equations contain the full dirac structure of positive and negative energy states .",
    "we studied the importance of these differences by solving the qp equations while leaving out negative energy components .",
    "we find that the projection of the confining potential on positive energy states leads to a considerably lower confinement strength than the nonrelativistic potential gives .",
    "this is partly compensated for by the introduction of the single negative energy states which are more bound than the positive states , and hence increase the masses .",
    "finally we find that the double negative energy states have little influence except for short distances where the singular behavior of the mesons is strengthened .",
    "the total picture stongly suggests that the differences here studied are important for determining the parameters of the qq interaction , especially the confinement strength @xmath29 . yet",
    "the global structure of the spectrum level ordening , relative sizes of splittings remains rather untouched under the relativistic modifications .",
    "this confirms the conclusion drawn from the success of nonrelativistic quark models that most relativistic effects in qq spectroscopy can be mimicked by employing nonrelativistic dynamics together with effective parameters .",
    "it will be interesting to study whether the relativistic modifications to meson wave functions will lead to sizeable changes in cross section for processes such as e.m .",
    "ones involving these mesons .    in this paper",
    "we have studied relativistic effects within the framework of quasi - potential equations . in so doing",
    "we have not addressed entirely the role of the relative energy variable @xmath2 .",
    "apart from the complexity of a calculation including this say in a bethe - salpeter equation approach , a more fundamental obstacle is posed by the extension of the definition of the confining potential , as we have used here , to a four - momentum dependence .",
    "the confining potential is only known for the static case .",
    "there is at this moment no underlying theory which can give a prescription on how to extend it to a covariant form .",
    "let us illustrate this considering the commonly used generalization of the potential @xmath76 which reads in momentum space @xmath77,\\ ] ] but its fourier transform yields @xmath78 = \\infty,\\ ] ] ( with @xmath79 ) which is clearly physically unacceptable .",
    "exploring qcd may lead to ways of reconstructing such a confining force , which can be used in such an off mass shell approach as we have discussed here .",
