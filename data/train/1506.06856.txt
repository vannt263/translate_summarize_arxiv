    "hence the above mentioned procedure , which was followed for the ferromagnetic systems to subtract the fragile mode contributions , is not valid .",
    "[ [ section-26 ] ]    moreover at any finite temperature above @xmath13 , it is to be kept in mind that not all vortices / merons are freely moving and that bound vortex - anti - vortex pair density remains finite .",

    "furthermore , it contributes negligibly to the total integrated intensity @xmath118 and hence the nature of the convoluted total integrated intensities at different temperatures turns out to be quite similar to that of the convoluted in - plane integrated intensities .",
    "however , the detailed quantitative comparison between the theoretical results and the experimental results corresponding to the total integrated intensities @xmath118 reveals that even though our  semi - classical like \" theory is able to predict the occurrence of the central peak , the magnitudes of the @xmath118 for finite values of energy transfer , obtained from theoretical analysis , differ by a huge factor from the corresponding experimental values .",
    "moreover , apart from the spin dynamics induced by the mobile topological excitations , the fragile magnons and multi - magnon modes are quite likely to make important contribution towards this dynamics .",
    "it is a well known fundamental fact that the spin - dynamical structure function ( dsf ) and hence the integrated intensity corresponding to all real magnetic systems must be positive definite @xcite .",
    "our detailed calculations and analysis however , brings out an important fact that for quasi - two dimensional low - spin anti - ferromagnetic systems , the semi - classical treatment of ideal gas of mobile vortices / merons ( anti - vortices / anti - merons ) leads to negative values of total integrated intensities even in the low energy regime , when convoluted with commonly used resolution functions .",
    "similar results were obtained for @xmath123 layered ferromagnets @xcite .",
    "such a behaviour is purely unphysical .",
    "these facts highlight the inapplicability of the semi - classical vortex / meron gas phenomenology to the quasi - two dimensional ( or rather layered ) low - spin anti - ferromagnetic systems very strongly and necessitates the demand for a full quantum treatment of the problem .",
    "let us further point out that the value of @xmath17 at which the onset of such unphysical behaviour occurs depends on the value of the spin @xmath132 .",
    "it has been shown in the case of ferromagnetic systems that the regime over which this unphysical behaviour persists , shrinks as the value of @xmath122 increases @xcite .",
    "similar behaviour is expected in the anti - ferromagnetic systems also .",
    "this may be verified from the studies on the compounds based on gd and mn .",
    "+    [ [ section-32 ] ]    to the best of our knowledge there are no materials based on @xmath133 ( spin @xmath134 ) which can be modelled by 2d xxz hamiltonian ( xy anisotropic heisenberg hamiltonian ) .",
    "however , some high spin magnetic systems such as @xmath135 , both being spin @xmath136 compound , turn out to be a layered heisenberg afm with ising like anisotropy @xcite . in this case",
    "the bkt scenario does not hold . on the other hand applicability of the berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless scenario on triangular chromium - lattice afm with @xmath137",
    "has been investigated only via electron spin resonance ( esr ) technique @xcite . in this regard",
    "it is worthwhile to mention that the spin dynamics in a @xmath138 based spin @xmath136 honeycomb lattice anti - ferromagnetic material @xmath3 has been investigated via ins experiment @xcite .",
    "the critical properties of this material have been reported to be well described by 2d xxz hamiltonian ( anisotropy parameter being equal to 0.998 ) only in the low @xmath139 regime .",
    "we have performed an initial study towards the calculation of dsf for @xmath3 using our model and this reveals that the semi - classical bkt phenomenology is producing a much better agreement with the experimental data corresponding to this material at 85 k @xcite .",
    "the agreement is only in terms of peak position and the range of energy transfer over which we get acceptable ( positive ) values of dsf .",
    "this range encompasses a considerable portion of the range of experimental interest .",
    "regardless of this , the possibility of meron dynamics in this material can not be adequately described with the available ins data . to be very specific , the available ins data is at 85 k whereas , the critical dynamics is completely confined within the plane ( and therefore , corresponding to a perfect 2d system ) only above 105 k @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in this material @xmath140 and therefore , above @xmath13 and below @xmath116 well defined magnon modes persist which is in contrast to the case corresponding to @xmath16 .",
    "[ [ section-33 ] ]    presently it seems that there is a scarcity of ins data in search for the spin dynamics induced by topological excitations corresponding to xy anisotropic ( easy plane anisotropic , i.e. , xxz type ) layered heisenberg anti - ferromagnetic materials having higher values of spin .",
    "more ins experiments on this type of materials ( in a suitable temperature range ) would be quite interesting in view of the fact that it would serve as a good testing ground for the applicability of such a conventional semi - classical theory of spin dynamics induced by topological excitations .",
    "[ [ section-34 ] ]    it is also very important to emphasize the fact that in our calculational analysis the structure of the classical vortex / meron has been built in the background of the n@xmath2el state ( see ( [ eq:2 ] ) of section ii ) .",
    "since the n@xmath2el state is not an exact ground state for the two - dimensional quantum anti - ferromagnetic spin systems , such a choice further adds to the reasons for the above mentioned unphysical behaviour .",
    "[ [ section-35 ] ]    keeping aside the occurrences of unphysical negative values of the integrated intensities obtained from the conventional semi - classical - like theory , the results agree with those from the experiment quite well in terms of the existence of the central peak . however , this peak is a genuine one only in the sense that it occurs well within the experimental resolution width .",
    "[ [ section-36 ] ]    moreover , quantitative disagreement , at the finite values of energy transfer , between the magnitudes of the theoretically calculated integrated intensities and those obtained experimentally strongly indicates that formation of the topological excitations from fragile collective modes and interactions between them can play a very crucial role in the spin dynamics .",
    "the values of the moment at different temperatures further strongly suggest the same .",
    "therefore , the interplay between the fragile single magnons or multi - magnon composites and the topological excitation is very crucial for the proper understanding of the dynamics induced by free movement of the latter in the quasi - two - dimensional low - spin anti - ferromagnetic systems .",
    "this further takes care of the fragile magnon contributions to the total integrated intensities as well which has not been filtered out from the experimental data ( for the reasons stated earlier in the section iii ) .",
    "in addition , the severe inadequacy of the semi - classical treatment in the case of quantum anti - ferromagnet may also contribute to such quantitative disagreement for the integrated intensities .",
    "[ [ section-37 ] ]    our investigations presented in this communication establish the fact that a complete quantum treatment is essential to describe the detailed features of the dynamics of mobile topological excitations corresponding to the quasi - two - dimensional low - spin anti - ferromagnetic systems , by taking into consideration the vortex / meron - fragile magnon interactions as well .",
    "this further brings out the possibility of a characterization of different layered materials into two classes , viz .",
    ", conventional bkt - like and quantum corrected bkt - like .",
    "moreover , since the n@xmath2el state is not an exact ground state for the two - dimensional quantum spin systems , the construction of the quantum vortices / merons in the complete quantum treatment has to be supplemented with proper choice of the ground state too .",
    "however , calculation of the dynamical structure function in a completely quantum mechanical framework is highly non - trivial .",
    "earlier attempts towards this goal could not explain the occurrence of the  central peak \" in the dsf obtained in the ins experiment performed on several quasi - two - dimensional materials @xcite .",
    "quite recently a theoretical framework had been developed based on the spin coherent state path integral formalism to describe the topological properties of static vortices and anti - vortices @xcite .",
    "an extension of this framework to the case of mobile spin vortices / merons ( and anti - vortices / anti - merons ) is crucial for quantum mechanical calculations of the dsf and the integrated intensity as well .",
    "insights from quantum monte carlo calculations may be quite useful in this endeavour @xcite .",
    "this would be taken up in future .",
    "more importantly the short range 2d anti - ferromagnetic spin - spin correlation persists even in the superconducting phase of the underdoped cuprates .",
    "this has been investigated and verified via ins experiments @xcite .",
    "moreover it has been shown very recently that the spin fluctuations in the afm quantum critical region of the fe based superconductors and some heavy fermion compounds can be modelled by dissipative quantum xy model and hence , the static and dynamics of topological excitations are the key factors for 2d spin - spin correlations @xcite .",
    "therefore , this investigation of the dynamics of the bkt vortices / merons may also contribute substantially to the microscopic understanding of lightly doped anti - ferromagnetic cuprates and the above mentioned other systems as well @xcite .",
