    "the inspiral of compact objects such as neutron stars and black holes are expected to be a major source of gravitational waves ( gw ) for the ground - based detectors ligo , virgo , geo600 and tama  @xcite , as well as for the future planned space - based detector lisa  @xcite . due to the effect of radiation reaction",
    ", the orbit of the binary system slowly decays over time . as this happens the amplitude and frequency of the waveform increases emitting a ` chirp ' waveform .",
    "there have been many efforts to create templates which will approximate a possible signal to high accuracy .",
    "on one hand we have the post - newtonian ( pn ) expansion of einstein s equations to treat the dynamics of the system  @xcite .",
    "this works well in the adiabatic or slow - motion approximation for all mass ranges . on the other hand",
    "we have black hole perturbation theory  @xcite which works for any velocity , but only in situations where the mass of one body is much greater than the other .",
    "while templates have been generated to 5.5 pn order for a test - mass orbiting a schwarzschild black hole  @xcite , and to 3.5 pn order for non - spinning binaries of comparable mass  @xcite , a number of difficulties still need to be tackled .",
    "the main problem is that both templates are a function of the orbital energy and gw flux functions . in the test - mass case , an exact expression in known for the orbital energy , but we have a pn expansion for the flux function . in the comparable - mass case , a pn expansion is known for both functions .",
    "it has been shown that the convergence of both methods is too slow to be useful in creating templates that can be confidently used in a gw search  @xcite .",
    "we also know that the pn approximation begins to break down when the orbital separation of the two bodies is @xmath3  @xcite .",
    "this means that as we approach the last stable orbit ( lso ) the templates begin to go out of phase with a possible signal due to the increase of relativistic effects .",
    "as most search methods are based on matched filtering , any mismatch in phase between our templates and a signal will result in a loss of recovered signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) and an increase in the error in the estimation of parameters .",
    "it was shown  @xcite that templates based on resummation methods such as pad approximation have a faster convergence in modelling the gravitational waveform .",
    "the pad based templates were then used to partially construct effective one body templates  @xcite which went beyond the adiabatic approximation and modelled the waveform into the merger phase .",
    "other more phenomenological templates such as the bcv  @xcite templates seem to be excellent at detecting gw , but are not necessarily the best template to use in the extraction of parameters .",
    "in this paper we focus on the inspiral of imri sources .",
    "these sources encompass the inspiral of a neutron star ( ns ) into a black hole with masses of 10s to 100s of solar masses ( which should be observable in the ground based detectors ) , to the inspiral of a low mass supermassive black hole ( @xmath4 ) into a more massive black hole ( @xmath5 ) as should be observable with future space based detectors .",
    "we do nt believe that the pn approximation used here will be sufficiently accurate to model emri sources , and expect that other methods such as analytic and numerical kludge waveforms  @xcite will be used to properly model emri waveforms .",
    "on the other hand , we fully believe that this method of resumming the pn series using chebyshev polynomials will be also applicable to the comparable mass case  @xcite .    throughout the paper we use the units @xmath6 .      the problem with expansions like a taylor series is that they are based on weierstrass s theorem , which assumes that there are enough terms in the expansion to sufficiently model the function we are approximating .",
    "we know from previous studies that the 11 term expansion for the flux function for test - mass systems may not be sufficient . a more promising possibility is based on getting close to the minimax polynomial by using the family of ultraspherical ( or gegenbauer ) polynomials which are defined by @xmath7 where @xmath8 is a constant .",
    "these polynomials are orthogonal over @xmath9 $ ] with respect to the weight function @xmath10 .",
    "a feature of the polynomials @xmath11 is that they have @xmath12 distinct and real zeros and exhibit an oscillatory behaviour in the interval @xmath13 $ ] . for @xmath14",
    "the amplitude of the oscillations remain constant throughout the interval and is conducive to trying to find an `` equal - ripple '' error curve , which is integral to the minimax polynomial .",
    "this value of @xmath15 corresponds to the chebyshev polynomials of the first kind , @xmath16 , ( hereafter chebyshev polynomials ) .",
    "these polynomials are closely related to the minimax polynomial due to the fact that there are @xmath17 points in [ -1,1 ] where @xmath16 attains a maximum absolute value with alternating signs , i.e. @xmath18  @xcite .",
    "it can be shown  @xcite that the chebyshev polynomials exhibit the fastest convergence properties of all of the ultraspherical polynomials .    for our purposes ,",
    "we need to approximate polynomials which are a function of the dimensionless velocity @xmath19 in the domain @xmath20 $ ] , where @xmath21 is the velocity at the lso for a test - particle orbiting a schwarzschild black hole . in this case",
    "we use the shifted chebyshev polynomials , designated @xmath22 .",
    "we can also transform from the interval @xmath23 $ ] to an arbitrary interval @xmath24 $ ] using @xmath25 , s\\in[-1,1].\\ ] ] in this case we have @xmath26.\\ ] ] we can now write the shifted chebyshev polynomials in the form @xmath27 and the recurrence relation as @xmath28 such that the shifted polynomials have the initial conditions @xmath29",
    "in the stationary phase approximation the fourier transform for positive frequencies is given by  @xcite @xmath30 } , \\label{d4.6a}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 is a normalization constant .",
    "the phase of the fourier transform in the stationary phase approximation , @xmath32 , is found by solving the set of @xmath33 order odes given by @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the total mass , @xmath36 is the instantaneous velocity , @xmath37 is the derivative of the orbital energy with respect to the velocity @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the angular velocity as observed at infinity and @xmath40 is an invariant velocity parameter observed at infinity .",
    "finally , @xmath41 is the gravitational wave flux function .    for a test - mass particle in circular equatorial",
    "orbit about a schwarzschild black hole , an exact expression for the orbital energy exists  @xcite .",
    "its derivative with respect to the velocity is given by @xmath42 where we have introduced a finite - mass dependence through the reduced mass ratio , @xmath43 . from this equation",
    "the lso is found by demanding @xmath44 , giving @xmath45 .",
    "for the flux function we only have a pn expansion of the form @xmath46 , \\label{eq : flux}\\ ] ] where @xmath47 is the dominant _ newtonian _ flux function given by @xmath48 and the coefficients in the expansion of the flux function are given by  @xcite .",
    "we begin to encounter logarithmic terms at @xmath49 and above .",
    "it is well know that terms such as these can destroy the convergence of a power series expansion .",
    "the pad approximant to the flux is defined as @xmath50 p^{n}_{m}\\left[\\sum_{k=0}^{11}\\,f_{_{k}}v^{k}\\right],\\ ] ] where @xmath51 is the pad operator , @xmath52 is the velocity at the photon ring and the coefficients @xmath53 and @xmath54 are related to the coefficients in the original pn expansion .",
    "after factoring out the logarithmic term and introduce a linear term into the non - logarithmic series , the next step is to expand both power series in the above equation in terms of the shifted chebyshev polynomials .",
    "this is done by writing each monomial in the power series in terms of the shifted chebyshev polynomials and substituting back into the series above .",
    "so , for example , starting with equations  ( [ eqn : rec ] ) and ( [ eqn : init ] ) , we can invert each expression for the monomials in @xmath19 , i.e. @xmath55 ... \\ ] ] and so on .    proceeding like this for all monomials",
    ", it then allows us to write the power series in the pn expansion solely in terms of the shifted chebyshev polynomials .",
    "the first advantage the chebyshev approximation has over both the pn and pad approximations is that we can also expand the power series appearing in the logarithmic terms as a chebyshev series .",
    "substituting for the monomials , we can write @xmath56 as the expression for both series in terms of the coefficients @xmath57 , @xmath58 are long so we will omit them here .",
    "we should emphasise the fact here that although the values of the coefficients @xmath53 are zero up to @xmath49 , the chebyshev expansion includes terms from @xmath59 .",
    "this allows us to define the chebyshev approximation to the gravitational wave flux function as @xmath60 \\left[\\sum_{k=0}^{11}\\,\\lambda_{_{k}}t_{n}^{*}(v)\\right],\\ ] ] where we re - introduce the pole at the photon ring .",
    ".the top two lines give the truncation errors associated with each order of approximation for both the pn and chebyshev flux functions at the lso , where the error in the approximation is greatest .",
    "the bottom two lines give the total truncation error incurred as we reduce the order of approximation from 5.5 to 2 pn . [",
