    "we use a geometric system of units in which @xmath7 .",
    "metric ( [ 1 ] ) can be reduced to a conformally - flat metric by introducing a conformal time @xmath8 defined by @xmath9 .",
    "it brings ( [ 1 ] ) to ds^2=a^2_dy^dy^ , where @xmath10 , @xmath11 is the minkowski metric .",
    "the cosmological time @xmath2 is physical and can be measured by the hubble observers with the help of clocks while the conformal time @xmath12 is merely a convenient coordinate parameter@xcite .",
    "typically , the cosmological metric ( [ q1 ] ) is applied to describe the properties of spacetime on cosmological distances .",
    "we shall assume that metric ( [ q1 ] ) describes the background geometry of spacetime on all scales .",
    "the einstein equivalence principle ( eep ) states that at each point on a manifold with an arbitrary gravitational field , it is possible to chose local inertial coordinates such that , within a sufficiently small region of the point in question , the laws of nature take the same form as in non - accelerated cartesian coordinates@xcite . according to eep each hubble observer carries out local inertial coordinates ( lic ) , @xmath13 such that the physical metric @xmath14 , given by ( [ q1 ] ) , is reduced to the minkowski metric , @xmath1 , and the affine connection is nil on the worldline of the observer .",
    "eep also asserts that free fall of electrically - neutral test particles and photons is geodesic and their equations of motion in lic are given locally by the same equation = 0 , where @xmath15 is the coordinate time of the lic , with all tidal terms being neglected .",
    "eep is not hold in conformal spacetime as shown in eq .",
    "( 6 ) below .",
    "let us construct lic in the vicinity of the worldline of a hubble observer who is located at the origin of lic , @xmath16 .",
    "the observer carries out an ideal clock that measures the parameter on the observer s worldline which is identified with the cosmic time @xmath2 in ( [ 1 ] ) .",
    "eep suggests that the physical spacetime interval ( [ q1 ] ) written down in lic , reads ds^2=_dx^dx^ , where we neglected all tidal terms . in the linearised hubble approximation the metric ( [ act6 ] )",
    "can be obtained from ( [ q1 ] ) with the help of special conformal transformation y^=^-1(x)(x^-b^x^2 ) , where @xmath17 , @xmath18 is four - velocity of observer in local frame , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 is the hubble constant .",
    "all operations of rising and lowering indices are completed with the minkowski metric .",
    "it can be checked that with sufficient accuracy @xmath22 .",
    "the reader should notice that transformation ( [ c4 ] ) yields @xmath23 on the worldline of the observer , defined by @xmath16 .",
    "however , @xmath24 for light geodesics , because @xmath25 on the light cone . comparison of these two equations reveals that when @xmath26 on time - like geodesic , the parameter @xmath27 on light geodesic , and it does not coincide with the proper time @xmath15 of the observer .",
    "the above consideration suggests that equation of light geodesic parametrized with the proper time @xmath15 of the observer reads = h(-u^ ) .",
    "the christoffel symbols entering this equation are not all nil .",
    "they can be deduced from the optical metric d s^2=-a^2()d^2+_ijdx^i dx^j .",
    "this metric is degenerated in the sense that it is applied only to the events located on the light cone hypersurface connected by the condition @xmath28 .",
    "solution of this equation for a radial propagation of light from / to the origin of the coordinates is r = r_0 + 2 ^ 2 , where @xmath29 sign corresponds to outgoing and incoming light ray respectively , @xmath30 , @xmath31 corresponds to the position of the light - ray particle at the instant of time , @xmath32 .",
    "the coordinate speed of light for outgoing ray , @xmath33 , exceeds the fundamental value @xmath34 for @xmath35 .",
    "there is no violation of special relativity here because this effect is non - local .",
    "the local value of the speed of light measured at time of emission , @xmath32 , is equal to @xmath34 .",
    "a monochromatic electromagnetic wave propagates on a light cone hypersurface of a constant phase @xmath36 .",
    "the wave vector is @xmath37 , and frequency of the wave measured by an observer moving with 4-velocity , @xmath38 , is@xcite @xmath39 .",
    "we denote the point of emission @xmath40 , the point of observation @xmath41 , and the emitted and observed frequencies as @xmath42 and @xmath43 , respectively .",
    "their ratio @xmath44 quantifies the doppler effect .",
    "locally , four - velocity of static observers , @xmath18 .",
    "hence , = , where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the instants of time of emission and observation of light respectively . the parallel transport of @xmath47 along the light geodesic is computed with the optical metric ( [ fe3 ] ) .",
    "equation of the parallel transport of @xmath48 in the local coordinates is a light - like geodesic that reads @xcite = -12 k_k _ , where @xmath49 is the affine parameter along the light ray , the wave vector of light @xmath50 solution of this equation is @xmath51 .",
    "it yields the doppler shift of frequency of electromagnetic wave in expanding universe as measured in the local inertial frame = = 1+h(_2-_1 ) .",
    "this equation tells us that the cosmological doppler shift in the local coordinates is _ blue _ ( @xmath52 ) because @xmath53 and @xmath54 due to the hubble expansion",
    ". this may be the reason for the anomalous doppler shift measured in pioneer spacecraft mission@xcite .",
    "it is tempting to apply the optical metric formalism to microwave cavity resonator .",
    "one might expect the same doppler drift of the resonator s frequency as given in ( [ d5a ] ) . at the same time ,",
    "frequency of atomic clock is not affected by the hubble expansion@xcite .",
    "this type of experiment has been conducted by storz @xcite .",
    "they did not find any relative drift between the two frequencies .",
    "the reason is that microwave in the cavity is a standing wave that is locked to the boundary of the cavity . as the size of the cavity",
    "is not affected by the hubble expansion locally@xcite , the frequency of the standing wave remains constant .",
