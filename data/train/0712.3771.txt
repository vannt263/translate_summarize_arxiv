    "surface plasmon - polaritons ( spps ) are electromagnetic modes originated from the interaction between light and mobile surface charges , typically the conduction electrons in metals @xcite .",
    "because of the so - called `` excess of momentum '' with respect to light of the same frequency , spps can not propagate away from a planar surface and are thus bound to and guided by it . as a consequence of such binding , spp modes can be laterally confined below the diffraction limit , which has raised the prospect of spp - based photonic circuits @xcite . to build up this kind of circuits",
    "one would require a variety of components in which incident light would be first converted in spps , propagating and interacting with different devices before being recovered as freely propagating light .",
    "hence , a great deal of attention has been recently devoted to the creation of optical elements for spps @xcite , as well as to the efficient coupling of freely - propagating light into and out of them .",
    "this latter issue constitutes the fundamental bottleneck that must be overcome in order to fully exploit the potential of spps , given that established techniques for spp generation ( which make use of prism @xcite , grating @xcite or nanodefect @xcite coupling ) require that the system s size be well out of the sub - wavelength scale in order to obtain a neat spp signal . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath0-polarized back - side illumination of sub - wavelength apertures in optically thick metal films @xcite prevents both damping and signal blinding but it does not ensure a unique propagation direction for the generated spps .    in a previous work @xcite , we proposed a novel back - side slit - illumination method based on drilling a periodic array of indentations at one side of the slit .",
    "it was demonstrated that the spp beam emerging from the slit to its corrugated side can be back - scattered in such a way that it interferes constructively with the one propagating in the opposite direction , thus obtaining a localized unidirectional spp source . here",
    ", we provide a comprehensive version of our proposal and discuss in some extent its range of validity .",
    "additional experimental measurements will be also presented .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in we summarize the key concepts of our proposal and focus in some quantitative aspects of spp generation and reflection . the validity of our simple wave interference model is discussed in .",
    "finally , experimental results are presented in , prior to general conclusions .",
    "defining the geometry of the system are also shown.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=84.0% ] +    a picture of the proposed structure is shown in .",
    "a periodic array of one - dimensional ( 1d ) indentations is fabricated at the output metal surface close and parallel to the illuminated slit .",
    "the starting point for such a design can be found in a previous work on 1d spp scattering by means of a modal expansion formalism @xcite . in order to cope with spp launching",
    ", we considered a single slit flanked by an array of indentations ( rectangular grooves ) placed in the output surface of a thick metallic film .",
    "eventually , the distance between the slit and indentations was taken to be infinity . in this way",
    ", the slit merely played the role of a theorist s spp - launcher , as far as it can be shown that the field created by the slit corresponds to spp illumination into the grooves . besides , we also found a simple geometrical condition for the groove array to behave as a perfect bragg mirror , associated to the low-@xmath1 edge of the plasmonic band gap for the periodic system . combining these two elements",
    ", one can obtain a remarkably simple scheme to modulate the spp coupling - in at a real back - side illumination experiment : given an incident wavelength , let us design a groove array for which spp reflectance rises to a maximum and place it at a distance @xmath2 from the slit ( situation b of ) .",
    "hence , any outgoing spp generated at the same side of the slit will be mainly back - scattered by the grooves and interfere either constructively or destructively with the one that is generated at the opposite side .",
    "this interference can be tuned by adjusting the separation @xmath2 between the slit and the first groove of the array , defined centre to centre .",
    "the total phase difference , @xmath3 , between the interfering spps will then consist of the phase change upon reflection plus the additional shift resulting from the two different path lengths along the metal : @xmath4 d ,   \\label{eqphi}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 holds for in - plane plasmon wave - vector . according to ,",
    "constructive or destructive interference should occur for those phase values equal to , respectively , even or odd multiples of @xmath6 .",
    "it is clear that , as will be discussed in , several objections may arise against this very simplified model , but before we turn to its validity , let us take a closer look at the two ingredients on which it is based : the generation of spps at a sub - wavelength aperture and the phase they acquire as a result of bragg reflection .",
    "|$ ] distribution at the output surface of an au film perforated by a single slit ( situation a of ) .",
    "incident light is @xmath0-polarized and impinges normally onto the back side of the metal surface at @xmath7 nm . here , slit width @xmath8 nm and film thickness @xmath9 nm.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=84.0% ] +    renders a finite - difference time - domain ( fdtd ) @xcite simulation of the electromagnetic ( em ) field distribution originated from @xmath0-polarized back - side illumination of a sub - wavelength slit on a thick au film . as can be seen , the most of the field is diffracted away , but a significant fraction appears to be bound to the metallic surface at each side of the aperture .",
    "however , to what extent is that a confined state of surface plasmon ?",
    "such an assessment requires that analytical expressions for the em field distribution created by the slit be obtained without any a priori assumption about the presence of spps . for that purpose ,",
    "we have made use of the above - mentioned modal expansion technique .",
    "given that it has been extensively described elsewhere @xcite , let us just briefly summarize its basic ingredients : the em fields are expanded in terms of the eigenmodes in each spatial region ( plane waves at input / output regions and waveguide modes inside the indentation ) and then the expansion coefficients are obtained by just matching appropriately the parallel components of the fields at the two metal - dielectric interfaces .",
    "the dielectric response of the metal is taken into account by applying surface impedance boundary conditions ( sibc ) @xcite to the tangential components of the em fields at the metallic surface . for a non - magnetic medium , @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 is the unitary vector normal to the surface directed into the metal half - space .",
    "however , sibc are not applied at the vertical walls defining the slit but for the calculation of propagating constants along the @xmath13 direction .",
    "this choice allows us to express the em fields inside in terms of the waveguide eigenmodes of a perfect conductor ( pc ) , which are known analytically .",
    "although the absorption inside the cavities is therefore neglected , one can expect this not to be a serious shortcoming when considering sizes much greater than the skin depth .",
    "the end product of our expanding and matching is a linear system of algebraic equations that connect the modal amplitudes of the @xmath14 field at the input and output openings of the slit .",
    "once those self - consistent amplitudes are found , it is straightforward to obtain the em fields at any desired point .    by imposing the constraint that incident light impinge in `` classical mounting '' ( ie . within the @xmath15 plane ) , we just have to concern ourselves with the @xmath16-component of the magnetic field . from a mathematical point of view , @xmath17 at the output side is obtained by integrating all across the slit every considered eigenmode @xmath18 multiplied by a scalar 1d green s function and then weighting each contribution with the corresponding amplitude @xmath19 at the output opening : @xmath20 where @xmath13 stands for the distance from the output surface .",
    "this closely resembles the huygens - fresnel description of wave propagation in terms of a set of punctual emitters , but we have to keep in mind that all those `` emitters '' are self - consistently connected .",
    "however , the information on the character of the generated field is contained neither in the modes nor in their amplitudes , but in the propagator itself : @xmath21}{\\sqrt{k_0 ^ 2-k^2 } + k_0z_s } , \\label{def_g}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 . despite its impressive appearance",
    ", @xmath23 just computes the projection of em fields at the opening of the slit onto all possible diffracted waves , whether they are propagating or evanescent .",
    "bound - to - interface contributions are incorporated into the picture as a consequence of finite @xmath24 , which makes the difference with respect to perfect conductor approximation : for @xmath25 , transforms into an integral representation of the 0th - order hankel function of the first kind ( ie . the well - known green s function for two - dimensional helmholtz operator @xcite ) , otherwise it has to be evaluated numerically .",
    "such numerical inspection reveals that @xmath23 tends to the pc result for @xmath26 irrespective of @xmath24 @xcite . on the other hand , in the regime where @xmath27 , oscillatory contributions within the kernel of mutually cancel everywhere but in the region close to the integrand singularities at @xmath28 , with @xmath5 satisfying @xmath29 this is , by the way , the spp dispersion relation of a flat metal - dielectric interface within the sibc . in that asymptotic limit",
    ", the green s function can be explicitly approximated as @xmath30 therefore , and even in the presence of absorption , spps govern the em coupling along the surface at a distance of several wavelengths , whereas `` pc - like '' behaviour is observed at the close vicinity of the slit .",
    "it is worth mentioning that this simple fact is completely misinterpreted in several recent papers , as pointed out in a previous work @xcite . in any case , the existence of these two regimes have also been remarked by introducing a `` creeping wave contribution '' that rapidly vanishes for increasing distances and is explicitly defined as the difference between total and spp fields along the metal - dielectric interface @xcite .    in order to determine the precise range of distances for the em field at to be dominated by either `` pc - like '' or spp contribution ,",
    "we have calculated @xmath31|$ ] at the metal surface for @xmath24 values corresponding to that of au at 800 and 1500 nm .",
    "each calculation was carried out for the exact , asymptotic and pc versions of green s function .",
    "as can be seen in , comparison with the exact result in the near - infrared ( nir ) shows that the asymptotic limit is already reached for a distance of about @xmath32 from the center of the slit , which is increased up to @xmath33 when the incident wavelength falls within the telecom range .",
    "consequently , it is only for greater distances that we can unambiguously establish a one - to - one correspondence between fields at the interface and spps .",
    "+    in we present the fraction of the output current that is transferred into spps ( @xmath34 ) and scattered out of the plane ( @xmath35 ) for the same @xmath24 parameters as in all across the sub - wavelength regime . given",
    "that spps gradually attenuate when propagating along the metal , the values for @xmath34 are calculated at @xmath36 in order to compare with those of @xmath35 . as the slit width increases , the out - of - plane radiation is clearly favored at the expense of the coupling into spps , which can be easily found to be proportional to @xmath37/k_p\\ , a_0)^2 $ ] because of the geometry of the system @xcite . for typical experimental width @xmath38 nm , no more than @xmath39 of the output energy",

    "the spectral locations of these edges can be approximated by folding the dispersion relation of spps for a flat metal surface into the first brillouin zone @xcite . within the sibc , such folding results in @xmath44 p = m \\pi , \\quad m=1,2 \\ldots\\ ] ] where @xmath45 is the period of array and @xmath46 .",
