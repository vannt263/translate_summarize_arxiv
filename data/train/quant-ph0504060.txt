    "it is well known that the decay of an unstable system can be slowed down , or even fully stopped in the ideal case , if one checks frequently whether the system is still undecayed .",
    "the first proper statement of this fact is due to beskow and nilsson @xcite and a rigorous mathematical proof was given by friedman @xcite , but it became popular only after misra and sudarshan @xcite invented the name `` quantum zeno effect '' for it . in recent years",
    "this subject attracted a new wave of interest  a rich bibliography can be found , e.g. , in @xcite .",
    "the motivation of this interest is twofold . on one hand",
    "the progress in experimental methods makes real the possibility to observe the effect as a phenomenon really existing in the nature , and ultimately to make use of it . on the other hand ,",
    "the problem presents also interesting mathematical challenges .",
    "the most important among them is obviously the question about the _",
    "quantum zeno dynamics : _ if the perpetual measurement keeps the state of the system within the hilbert space associated with the unstable system , what is then the time evolution of such a state ? some recent results @xcite give partial answers to this question , which we shall describe below , and there are counterexamples @xcite , see also ( * ? ? ?",
    "2.4.9 ) , which point out the borders beyond which it has no sense .    in this note",
    "we are going to address a different question .",
    "suppose that at the beginning the interaction responsible for the decay is absent , so state vectors evolve within the mentioned space which we below call @xmath0 .",
    "switching the interaction with the `` environment '' in , we allow the system to decay which means the state vectors may partially or fully leave the space @xmath0 .",
    "if we now perform the zeno - style monitoring , the system is forced to stay within @xmath0 and to evolve there , but what is in this case the relation of its dynamics to the original `` stable '' one ?",
    "a general answer to this question is by no means easy and we do not strive for this ambitious goal here .",
    "our aim is to analyze a simple example which involves a schrdinger operator in @xmath1 with a singular interaction supported by a line and a finite family of points @xcite .",
    "this model is explicitly solvable and can be regarded as a caricature description of a system consisting of a quantum wire and dots which are not connected mutually but can interact by means tunneling .",
    "the main result of this paper given in theorem  [ compar ] below is that in the model _ the two dynamics do not differ significantly during time periods short at the scale given by the lifetime of the system unperturbed by the perpetual observation . _",
    "let us briefly summarize the contents of the paper .",
    "first we recall basic notions concerning zeno dynamics ; we will prove the needed existence result in case when the state spece of the unstable system has a finite dimension .",
    "sections 35 are devoted to the mentioned solvable model .",
    "we will introduce its hamiltonian and find its resolvent .",
    "then we will show that in the `` weak - coupling '' case when the points are sufficiently far from the line the model exhibit resonances , and in sec .",
    "5 we will treat the model from the decay point of view , showing how the point - interaction eigenfunctions dissipate due to the tunneling between the points and the line ; in the appendix we demonstrate that in the weak - coupling case the decay is approximately exponential .",
    "the main result is stated and proved in sec .",
    "following general principles of quantum decay kinematics ( * ? ? ? * chap .",
    "1 ) we associate with an unstable system three objects : the state hilbert space @xmath2 describing all of its states including the decayed ones , the full hamiltonian @xmath3 on @xmath2 and the projection @xmath4 which specifies the subspace of states of the unstable system alone .",
    "@xmath3 is , of course , a self - adjoint operator , we need to assume that it is _ bounded from below .",
    "_    the question about the existence of zeno dynamics mentioned above can be then stated in this context generally as follows : does the limit @xmath5 hold as @xmath6 , in which sense , and what is in such a case the operator @xmath7 ?",
    "let us start from the end and consider the quadratic form @xmath8 with the form domain @xmath9 which is closed but in general it may not be densely defined .",
    "the classical results of chernoff @xcite suggest that the operator associated with this form , @xmath10 , is a natural candidate for the generator of the zeno dynamics , and the counterexamples mentioned in the introduction show that the limit may not exist if @xmath7 is not _ densely defined , _",
    "so we adopt this assumption .",
    "notice that the operator @xmath7 is an extension of @xmath11 , but in general a nontrivial one .",
    "this can be illustrated even in the simplest situation when @xmath12 , because if @xmath3 is unbounded @xmath13 is a proper subspace of @xmath14 .",
    "take @xmath15 such that @xmath16 is nonzero , and let @xmath4 refer to the one - dimensional subspace spanned by @xmath17 .",
    "this means that @xmath11 can not be applied to any nonzero vector @xmath18 of @xmath0 while @xmath19 is well defined and nonzero .",
    "it is conjectured that formula ( [ prod ] ) will hold under the stated assumptions in the strong operator topology .",
    "proof of this claim remains an open question , though .",
    "the best result to the date @xcite establishes the convergence in a weaker topology which includes averaging of the norm difference with respect to the time variable .",
    "while this may be sufficient from the viewpoint of physical interpretation , mathematically the situation is unsatisfactory , since other results available to the date require modifications at the left - hand side of ( [ prod ] ) , either by replacement of the exponential by another kato function , or by adding a spectral projection interpreted as an additional energy measurement  see @xcite for more details .",
    "there is one case , however , when the formula can be proven , namely the situation when @xmath20 and the density assumption simply means that @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the form domain of @xmath3 .",
    "since this exactly what we need for our example , let us state the result .",
    "[ zeno - fin ] let @xmath3 be a self - adjoint operator in a separable hilbert space @xmath2 , bounded from below , and @xmath4 a finite - dimensional orthogonal projection on @xmath2 . if @xmath21 , then for any @xmath23 and @xmath24 we have @xmath25 uniformly on any compact interval of the time variable @xmath26 .    the claim can be proved in different ways , see @xcite and @xcite . here",
    "we use another argument the idea of which was suggested by g.m .",
    "graf and a.  guekos @xcite .",
    "notice first that without loss of generality we may suppose that @xmath3 is strictly positive , i.e. @xmath27 for some positive number @xmath28 .",

    "next we note that @xmath38 by definition , and consequently , the expression contained in ( [ aux1 ] ) tends to zero weakly as @xmath32 , however , in a finite dimensional @xmath0 the weak and operator - norm topologies are equivalent .",
    "it is clear that the finite dimension of @xmath4 is essential for the proof .",
    "the same results holds for the backward time evolution , @xmath39 .",
    "moreover , the formula ( [ prod - fin ] ) has non - symmetric versions with the operator product replaced with @xmath40 and @xmath41 tending to the same limit ",
    "see @xcite .",
    "before coming to the proper decay problem let us describe the general setting of the model . we will consider a generalized schrdinger operator in @xmath42 with a singular interaction supported by a set consisting of two parts .",
    "one is a straight line , the other is a finite family of points situated in general outside the line , hence formally we can write our hamiltonian as @xmath43 where @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 .",

    "the latter has by assumption the dimension @xmath184 and it is straightforward to check that @xmath185 .",

    "taking into account the unitarity of its parts together with a functional calculus estimate based on @xmath192 we find that the norm of @xmath193 remains small as long as @xmath194 .",
    "thus to check ( [ timeest ] ) we have to estimate norm of the operator @xmath195 acting in @xmath196 ; in the basis of the vectors @xmath197 it is represented by @xmath198 matrix with the elements @xmath199 where @xmath200 . using the representation ( [ efs ] )",
    "we obtain @xmath201 where @xmath202 is a shorthand for @xmath203 . to proceed",

    "the rest is dealt with by means of the residue theorem in the usual way : we can extend the integration to the whole real line and perform it by means of the integral over a closed contour consisting of a real axis segment and a semicircle in the lower halfplane , using the fact that the contribution from the latter vanishes when the semicircle radius tends to infinity .",
    "it is clear that only the @xmath115 poles in ( [ specder ] ) contained in the lower halfplane contribute , the @xmath270-th one giving @xmath271 ; an argument similar to lemma  [ ldecay1 ] shows that the integral over @xmath272 vanishes as @xmath219 , and likewise , the integral over semicircle vanishes in the limit of infinite radius .",
