    "however , the weak 1.6  @xmath3 ch@xmath31 feature present in the synthesized binary spectrum ( also seen in the spectrum of sdss  j0805 + 4812 ) is not present in the spectrum of 2mass  j1126@xmath05003 .",
    "furthermore , this combination does not reproduce the optical spectrum of 2mass  j1126@xmath05003 , as illustrated in figure  [ fig_doubleopt].5003 is compared to a binary template constructed from data for 2mass  j0036 + 1821 @xcite and the t4.5 2mass  j05591914 - 1404488 @xcite , as no optical t4 spectrum was available .",
    "the component spectra were scaled to the measured @xmath52 magnitudes of these sources ( 16.41@xmath10.02 and 19.11@xmath10.07 , respectively ; @xcite ) . ] in this case , the t dwarf secondary contributes negligibly to the optical flux of the binary , and as a result the hybrid spectrum is nearly identical to that of 2mass  j0036 + 1821 ( with the notable exception of weaker tio absorption at 8400   ) and inconsistent with that of 2mass  j1126@xmath05003 .",
    "binaries with later - type primaries provide a better match at optical wavelengths , but result in stronger ch@xmath31 absorption at 1.6 and 2.2  @xmath3 ( figure  [ fig_double ] ) .",
    "similar results were found for alternate l and t dwarf absolute magnitude / spectral type relations @xcite .",
    "we therefore find no reasonable combination of normal l and t dwarf spectra that can simultaneously reproduce the optical and near - infrared spectrum of 2mass  j1126@xmath05003 , confirming the conclusion of @xcite that this source is likely to be single .",
    "it is of course possible that 2mass  j1126@xmath05003 is a binary with peculiar components .",
    "however , this scenario is less compelling than that in which 2mass  j1126@xmath05003 is a solitary peculiar l dwarf .",
    "a common explanation for the spectral peculiarities of blue l dwarfs is that their atmospheres are metal - depleted , causing a relative enhancement in collision - induced h@xmath2 absorption that preferentially suppresses flux at @xmath53-band @xcite .",
    "this , along with a general reduction in metal opacity at shorter wavelengths , results in bluer @xmath4 colors . indeed ,",
    "blue near - infrared colors are common for metal - poor m- and l - type subdwarfs @xcite .",
    "low temperature metal - poor dwarfs also tend to exhibit stronger metal hydride bands and single metal lines due to the greater relative reduction in metal oxide absorption ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this trend is also consistent with enhanced feh and @xmath33-band alkali line absorption observed in the near - infrared spectra of 2mass  j1126@xmath05003 @xcite and other blue l dwarfs .",
    "in addition , l subdwarfs exhibit surprisingly enhanced tio absorption , unexpected for a metal - depeleted atmosphere but consistent with reduced condensate formation @xcite .",
    "2mass  j1126@xmath05003 appears to exhibit this trait as well ( figure  [ fig_optspec ] ) .",
    "however , it is clear that the sources shown in figure  [ fig_blue ] are not as metal - poor as currently known l subdwarfs , given that the latter have far bluer near - infrared colors ( @xmath54 ) and more peculiar optical and near - infrared spectral morphologies @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the , and lines in the 78008600   spectral band are similar in strength to those of both 2mass  j2224 - 0158 and 2mass  j1507 - 1627 ( figure  [ fig_alkalines ] ) , making it unlikely that 2mass  j1126@xmath05003 is significantly metal - poor relative to these sources .    can the spectral peculiarities seen in blue l dwarf spectra nevertheless be the result of modest subsolar metallicities ; e.g. , [ m / h ] @xmath26 -0.5 ? to address this question , we examined trends in the most recent theoretical spectral models from @xcite .",
    "while these models do not as yet reproduce the near - infrared spectra of l dwarfs in detail ( cf . , @xcite ) , trends as a function of metallicity can be examined and compared to the deviations observed between normal and blue l dwarfs .",
    "figure  [ fig_modelzcomp ] illustrates this , comparing two normalized and smoothed condensate cloud models , both assuming t@xmath46 = 1700  k , @xmath55 = 5.5 ( cgs ) and a modal grain size @xmath56 = 100  @xmath3 , but differing in metallicity : [ m / h ] = 0 and -0.5 .",
    "consistent with the arguments above , the lower metallicity model exhibits both a bluer spectral energy distribution and enhanced 0.99  @xmath3 feh absorption , as observed in the blue l dwarfs .",
    "however , no enhancement in the 1.4  @xmath3 h@xmath2o band is seen , as its opacity is uniformly reduced across most of the near - infrared spectral region .",
    "this inconsistency suggests that subsolar metallicity alone can not explain the spectral peculiarities of blue l dwarfs , even if this is a characteristic trait of such sources .",
    "surface gravity influences the emergent spectral energy distribution of a late - type dwarf by modulating the photospheric gas pressure , affecting both pressure - sensitive features and gas / condensate chemistry .",
    "spectral signatures of low surface gravity , including weakened alkali lines , enhanced metal oxide absorption and reduced h@xmath2 absorption ( resulting in redder near - infrared colors ) , have all been used to identify and characterize young brown dwarfs ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "as blue l dwarfs tend to have opposing spectral peculiarities , it is reasonable to consider that these sources may have high surface gravities , a result of being both older and more massive than their equivalently classified counterparts .",
    "as discussed in @xmath6  3.4 , there is kinematic evidence to support this idea .",
    "2mass  j1126@xmath05003 , 2mass  j1300 + 1921 and 2mass  j1721 + 3344 all have estimated @xmath34 @xmath43 100  km  s@xmath18 @xcite , at the 3@xmath39 tail of the l dwarf @xmath34 distribution of @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite have argued that the large space velocities of blue l dwarfs indicate that they may be members of the old disk or thick disk populations and , as such , are older and more massive than the average field l dwarf .",
    "the 2  gyr lower age limit of 2mass  j1126@xmath05003 based on the absence of absorption in its optical spectrum is further evidence that this source is relatively old and has a high surface gravity .",
    "however , surface gravity effects alone also fail to explain the spectral peculiarities of 2mass  j1126@xmath05003 and other blue l dwarfs .",

    "an increase in surface gravity in the burrows et al .",
    "models results in similar qualitative trends as decreased metallicity , namely bluer near - infrared colors and somewhat stronger feh and alkali line absorption .",
    "however , increasing the surface gravity from @xmath55 = 5.0 to 5.5 does not appear to change the depth of the 1.4  @xmath3 h@xmath2o band in any way .",
    "the marley et al .",
    "models do show a change in h@xmath2o band strength with higher surface gravity , but in the opposite sense as observed in the blue l dwarfs ; the absorption becomes weaker .",
    "the reduction in the h@xmath2o band contrast appears to be due to increased condensate opacity in the higher surface gravity models , affecting the flux peaks but not the deep molecular bands @xcite .",
    "stronger condensate absorption at @xmath33-band counteracts the increased h@xmath2 absorption at @xmath53-band , such that @xmath4 colors are only modestly affected by changes in surface gravity in these models ( see figure  8 in @xcite ) .",
    "hence , while blue l dwarfs like 2mass  j1126@xmath05003 may have higher surface gravities than normal field dwarfs , this trait alone does not explain the spectral peculiarities observed .",
    "a fourth possibility is that the condensate clouds of blue l dwarfs are somehow thinner or less opaque than those of normal field l dwarfs @xcite . reduced condensate opacity in the 1  @xmath3 spectral region allows other features such as feh and alkali line absorption to appear stronger at these wavelengths , much as reduced metal oxide absorption allows metal hydride bands and alkali lines to emerge in the red optical spectra of l dwarfs @xcite and late - type m subdwarfs @xcite .",
    "reduced condensate opacity also increases the contrast between the @xmath33-band peak and the base of the 1.4  @xmath3 h@xmath2o band , producing a deeper feature ; and between the @xmath33 and @xmath53-band peaks ( the latter dominated by h@xmath2 opacity ) , resulting in bluer near - infrared colors .",
    "many of the spectral peculiarities observed in blue l dwarfs can be qualitatively explained by a reduction in condensate opacity .",

    "subsolar metallicities and high surface gravities in of themselves can not reproduce the observed spectral peculiarities of these sources .",
