    "little higgs ( lh ) models offer an alternative to the standard model in which no fundamental scalars need be introduced ( for reviews see @xcite ) .",
    "generally , in lh models the higgs is a composite particle , bound by interactions that become strong at a scale @xmath0 .",
    "the mass of the higgs is much less than @xmath0 as the higgs is a pseudo - goldstone boson ( pgb ) of broken global symmetries in the theory of the new strong interaction .",
    "the global `` flavor '' symmetry @xmath1 of these models has a subgroup @xmath2 that is weakly gauged . in the absence of this weak gauge force",
    ", the flavor symmetry is broken spontaneously to a subgroup @xmath3 due to hyper - strong interactions at the scale @xmath0 . as a result , there are massless goldstone bosons that are coordinates on the @xmath4 coset space",
    ". since the weakly gauged @xmath2 force breaks the flavor symmetry explicitly , including its effects leads to some of the goldstone bosons ( the would - be goldstone bosons ) being eaten by the higgs mechanism and the rest becoming pgbs acquiring small masses of order @xmath0 times a small symmetry breaking parameter , the weak gauge coupling constant .",
    "the higgs is the lightest pgb in lh models , and its mass is naturally much less than @xmath0 ( and the other pgbs ) : due to the collective symmetry breaking mechanism its mass arises only at two loops .",
    "additional interactions must be included in lh models to account for quark and lepton masses . at low energies they reproduce the yukawa couplings of the standard model .",
    "since these interactions also break the flavor symmetry , they contribute to the masses of the pgbs . in order to ensure that the higgs remains much lighter than @xmath0",
    ", the quark interactions are designed to implement the collective symmetry breaking mechanism again .    in this paper",
    "we observe that the quark interactions introduced in the littlest higgs@xcite model ( @xmath5 ) and variants are secretly fine tuned to ensure the higgs remains light . in the @xmath5  we will show that radiative effects force the coupling of the top - quark ` triplet ' to split into two terms , disrupting the collective symmetry mechanism .",
    "we will argue that therefore combining the two terms into a single one was the result of an implicit fine tuning .",
    "we then show that the generic coupling of the top - quark and partners , as allowed by symmetry , induces unsuppressed , order @xmath0 higgs masses .",
    "in other words , the top - quark couplings are usually taken to implement the collective symmetry mechanism .",
    "but there is no underlying symmetry that enforces this choice , which must therefore result only from fine tuning .",
    "this defeats the purpose of introducing the model in the first place .",
    "we present some details on the original @xmath5model , and then proceed to show that the problem is generic .    can not one avoid this problem by gauging the collective symmetry ?",
    "after all , if the symmetry is gauged then the restricted form of the quark coupling is a result of the gauge symmetry .",
    "for example one may construct a model based on @xmath6 with @xmath7 .",
    "the vacuum aligns@xcite so that @xmath2 breaks to the electroweak subgroup @xmath8 at the scale @xmath0 , and the spectrum has a light higgs doublet plus many heavier pgbs .",
    "could the gauged @xmath9 now play the role of the collective symmetry for the top quark mass ?",
    "the problem with this is that the gauge symmetry is broken and the would be higgs is eaten .",
    "this model is higgsless .",
    "this is also generic : the collective symmetry must act nonlinearly on the higgs , and therefore it must be broken . gauging it eats away the higgs .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : llh ] we review and explain the problem in the @xmath5model .",
    "the @xmath5  itself is phenomenologically disfavoured @xcite by ewpd , and it is for this reason that alternatives , like models with custodial symmetry@xcite or with t - parity@xcite , have been introduced . rather than investigating these models individually",
    "we show in sec .",
    "[ sec : no - go ] that the problem is generic .",
    "we first give a very explicit proof for models with @xmath10 ( and @xmath11 ) vacuum manifold .",
    "we then generalize , which does not require much additional work .",
    "a brief recap is in sec .",
    "[ sec : conc ] .",
    "to establish notation we briefly review elements of the @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "it has @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "symmetry breaking @xmath15 is characterized by the goldstone boson decay constant @xmath16 .",
    "the embedding of @xmath2 in @xmath1 is fixed by taking the generators of @xmath17 and @xmath18 to be @xmath19 and the generators of the @xmath20 and @xmath21 @xmath22    the vacuum manifold is characterized by a unitary , symmetric @xmath23 matrix @xmath24 .",
    "we denote by @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) the gauge couplings associated with @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "if one sets @xmath29 the model has an exact global @xmath9 symmetry ( acting on the upper @xmath30 block of @xmath24 ) , while for @xmath31 it has a different exact global @xmath9 symmetry ( acting on the lower @xmath32 block ) .",
    "either of these exact global @xmath9 would - be symmetries guarantee the higgs remains exactly massless . hence , the higgs mass should vanish for either @xmath29 or @xmath31 .",
    "the perturbative quadratically divergent correction to the higgs mass must be polynomial in the couplings and can involve only one of the couplings at one loop order .",
    "hence it must vanish at one loop .",
    "this is the collective symmetry mechanism that ensures the absence of 1-loop quadratic divergences in the higgs mass .",
    "it is standard to introduce the top quark so that the collective symmetry argument still applies .",
    "the third generation doublet @xmath33 is a doublet under @xmath17 and a singlet under @xmath18 .",
    "introduce additional @xmath34-singlet spinor fields : @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "the third generation right handed singlet is a linear combination of @xmath37 and @xmath35 .",
    "the charges of these under @xmath38 are listed below , in .",
    "their couplings are taken to be @xmath39 where the indexes",
    "@xmath40 run over 1,2,3 , the indexes @xmath41 over @xmath42 and the triplet @xmath43 is @xmath44 the collective symmetry argument now runs as follows .",
    "if @xmath45 then @xmath46 in is constructed so that it exhibits an explicit global @xmath9 symmetry , a subgroup of @xmath12 . under this , the fields @xmath47 in and @xmath48 transform as triplets ( on @xmath49 ) .",
    "since this would - be exact global symmetry is spontaneously broken it guarantees that the higgs field remains an exactly massless goldstone boson .",
    "similarly , if @xmath50 then there is no coupling of the quarks to the goldstone bosons , which therefore remain massless .",
    "hence , the mass term must vanish as either @xmath51 or @xmath52 are set to zero , and since the quadratic divergence is polynomial in the couplings , it can only arise at two loops .",
    "the gauge and top - quark interactions generate an effective , coleman - weinberg potential which determines the vacuum orientation . if the gauge couplings are strong enough@xcite , @xmath53.\\ ] ] where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are unknown dynamical constants of order unity , the vacuum alignment is @xmath56 leading to the gauge - symmetry breaking into the electroweak subgroup , @xmath57 .",
    "as we just saw , the top quark lagrangian @xmath46 in is constructed so that it exhibits an explicit global @xmath9 symmetry . however",
    ", this is a symmetry of the lagrangian only for @xmath58 .",
    "there is in fact no symmetry reason for the fields in @xmath47 to combine into a triplet .",
    "given that the effective lagrangian is restricted only by the non - linear realization of the symmetry ( by parametrizing @xmath4 ) and by the requirement of explicit gauge invariance under @xmath2 , the coupling in is more generally of the form @xmath59 only when @xmath60 ( and @xmath58 ) do we recover the global @xmath9 symmetry of the collective symmetry mechanism .",
    "the main observation of this work is that the relation @xmath60 , assumed throughout the little higgs literature , is unnatural .",
    "we refer to this as the hidden fine tuning problem .",
    "although @xmath61 is natural in the absence of the gauge interactions , these are already present in the uv completion .",
    "below we comment in slightly more detail on how radiative effects explicitly introduce @xmath9 breaking into the yukawa couplings",
    ".    it should be evident that for @xmath62 the collective symmetry argument is spoiled .",
    "a straightforward computation gives a quadratically divergent correction to the higgs mass , @xmath63 where @xmath0 is a uv cut - off .",
    "the severity of the fine tuning can now be explored . if we insist that the higgs mass should be naturally of order of @xmath64  gev , while @xmath65  tev , then , not surprisingly , @xmath66 .",
    "the lagrangian in is not the most general one consistent with symmetries to lowest order in the chiral expansion .",
    "if @xmath9 were a good symmetry one could add to the lagrangian a term of the form @xmath67 one can also freely replace @xmath68 in eqs .   and  , and then , of course , split each @xmath9 invariant term into a sum of @xmath8 invariant terms .",
    "there is no reason a priori why these terms should be ignored , but they are not dangerous .",
    "in fact , they are inevitable , as they are generated radiatively , many of them already at one loop @xcite .",
    "imposing @xmath69 is not only a fine tuning , it is unnatural .",
    "since the symmetry is broken by marginal operators , the renormalization group evolution of the difference @xmath70 takes it away from zero , even if it is chosen to be zero at some arbitrary renormalization point  @xmath71 .     and @xmath72 .",
    "the wavy line represents a gauge boson of @xmath20 and the solid and doted lines a spinor and a pgb , respectively.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    as a check we have computed explicitly the one loop renormalization group equations for these couplings ( see fig .  [ fig : lambda - renor ] ) : @xmath73 here @xmath74 is the charge of @xmath35 under @xmath21 .",
    "details of the calculation will be presented elsewhere@xcite .",
    "if @xmath75 then we can write the solution in terms of the running coupling : @xmath76    the numerical value for @xmath77 can be obtained from the standard @xmath78 beta function ( see @xcite ) @xmath79 to compute this , we need to introduce the yukawa - type coupling for all the other standard model quarks .",
    "we will follow perelstein @xcite by noting that there is no need for implementing collective symmetry breaking for the other standard model quarks due to their small yukawa couplings .",
    "thus the other `` up '' type quarks yukawa interaction can be introduced by @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the quark family index . similarly the other `` down '' type quark interactions",
    "can be introduced by @xmath82 here @xmath83 if we take @xmath84 , then the @xmath85 charge of all the particles involved are @xmath86 thus we get @xmath87 .",
    "however , we note that the @xmath74 can be arbitrary .    we do not dwell on the numerics , since there are too many adjustable parameters ( the choice of @xmath74 , the value of @xmath88 couplings and @xmath89 which however must satisfy , the value of the cutoff @xmath0 ) .",
    "we simply note that @xmath90 .",
    "hence , even fine tuning @xmath91 generically produces a difference @xmath92 in excess of 1% .",
    "note also that the same behavior must occur in the uv completion of the @xmath5   model .",
    "after all , the terms in the lagrangian that break @xmath1-symmetry model the effects of symmetry breaking interactions at short distances , that is , in the uv completion .",
    "the interactions in the uv completion that are responsible for the quark yukawa couplings can not be taken to respect the @xmath9 symmetry required for the collective symmetry argument .",
    "the breaking of the @xmath9 symmetry in the uv completion is naturally much larger than in since neither the @xmath20 gauge coupling nor the yukawa couplings are asymptotically free .",
    "in this section we show the impossibility of constructing a theory that implements without fine tuning the collective symmetry mechanism on the terms responsible for quark and lepton masses .",
    "let us begin by stating in general terms what is required in order to implement the collective symmetry mechanism .",
    "any given term in the lagrangian has to be symmetric under a subgroup @xmath93 of the flavor group @xmath1 under which the higgs field transforms non - linearly , and in particular , with a transformation that includes a constant shift .. ] in addition , there must not be any one loop divergent radiative corrections that involve the coupling constants for two different terms .",
    "of course there are additional requirements on each individual term in the lagrangian .",
    "in particular any one term must be invariant under @xmath2 , the gauged subgroup of @xmath1 .",
    "we do not wish to specify this gauge group , since one could look for realizations of the collective symmetry mechanism in gauge groups other than the one of the @xmath5 .",
    "below we will only need to use the fact that this group contains the electroweak gauge group , @xmath94 , that this symmetry is linearly realized , _",
    "i.e. _ , that @xmath95 so it remains unbroken at the scale at which @xmath1 breaks to @xmath3 , and that the higgs field must transform as a doublet with hypercharge 1/2 under the electroweak group .",
    "the hidden fine tuning problem in the quark sector of the @xmath5resulted from the fact that @xmath96 is not a symmetry of the yukawa term , because @xmath93 does not commute with @xmath2 .",
    "the yukawa term in the lagrangian is actually a sum of terms that are separately invariant under the gauge group and the collection of terms can only be symmetric under @xmath93 by fine tuning the separate coupling constants at one scale .",
    "there are two ways that immediately come to mind in which one could try to extend the @xmath5  model to get around this problem .",
    "either extend the gauge group so that @xmath93 itself is gauged or obtain @xmath93 as an accidental symmetry .",
    "these , or other strategies can not work : below we will prove in generality that the collective symmetry mechanism can not work for terms other than the kinetic terms in the lagrangian .",
    "it is simpler to understand the general case by first looking at an explicit example .",
    "we can motivate this by the following observation .",
    "if the @xmath9 collective symmetry that acts on the first three rows and columns of @xmath24 is elevated to a gauge symmetry , then the equality @xmath60 is natural . of course",
    ", in the @xmath5  model this wo nt work because the @xmath9 is broken at the scale @xmath0 at which @xmath98 breaks to @xmath99 , and the higgs is eaten at this scale .",
    "but perhaps one can construct a theory based on a larger @xmath1 symmetry group with @xmath9 gauged and the higgs still transforming non - linearly under some @xmath93 subgroup of @xmath1 .",
    "for example , one may consider a nonlinear sigma model based on @xmath6 ( with spinor fields in non - trivial representations of the hyper - strong gauge group so that the @xmath88 in @xmath100 is non - anomalous ) .",
    "assume the @xmath101 is broken to @xmath102 by a symmetric condensate , which transforms under @xmath101 as @xmath103 . now gauge a @xmath7 subgroup of @xmath101 .",
    "the @xmath9 factor is precisely the gauged version of the top - block collective symmetry group , under which the royal triplet @xmath47 transforms as an actual triplet .",
    "it is a straightforward , if lengthy , exercise to show that the vacuum aligns correctly , that is , @xmath2 breaks to the electroweak subgroup .",
    "one can identify @xmath104 , and related entries , with the higgs doublet . by suitably choosing the generators of the gauged @xmath105 symmetry one finds that the higgs field is the only light pgb .",
    "now introduce top quark couplings in a manner consistent with the collective symmetry and without fine tuning of yukawa couplings . just as in the @xmath5  model , in addition to the third generation quark doublet @xmath33 and singlet @xmath35 , introduce a pair of weak singlet weyl fermions @xmath36 and @xmath37 that transform as @xmath106 under @xmath107 . the singlet @xmath36 is combined with the doublet @xmath33 into a triplet of the gauged @xmath9 , precisely as in . by suitably choosing the transformation properties under the @xmath105 we can ensure that the most general yukawa lagrangian consistent with the symmetries , to lowest order in the chiral expansion , is @xmath108 where the indexes @xmath40 run over @xmath109 and @xmath41 over @xmath110 .",
    "the problem with this model is that the @xmath9 symmetry does not protect the higgs .",
    "the collective symmetry required is an @xmath111 acting on the top - left @xmath112 block of @xmath24 .",
    "this in turn requires enlarging the true triplet to a four - plet , which allows for more terms in the lagrangian , which are related by the @xmath113 symmetry .",
    "however , this is not a good symmetry of the lagrangian and the added terms are related to the ones above only by imposing unnaturally a collective symmetry .",
    "this is precisely the same problem we encountered with the @xmath5 .",
    "let us generalize this to models with @xmath10 vacuum manifold , parametrized by the @xmath114 symmetric unitary matrix @xmath24 .",
    "we assume there is an @xmath8 gauged subgroup of @xmath115 . without loss of generality we can take its embedding in @xmath116 as follows : @xmath117 with @xmath118 .",
    "we assume further that the whatever other interactions exist they align the vacuum along ( with the proper interpretation for the dimensions of the 0 blocks and the center unit block ) .",
    "then , as usual , @xmath119 , where in the last step we have chosen the broken generators to satisfy @xmath120",
    ". the @xmath121 doublets @xmath122 with @xmath123 and @xmath124 , have hypercharge @xmath125 .",
    "so any one of these for which @xmath126 is a prospective higgs doublet .    under an infinitesimal @xmath116 transformation , @xmath127",
    ", the matrix of goldstone bosons transforms as @xmath128 where the ellipses stand for terms at least linear in the fields .",
    "we are interested in finding a subgroup @xmath93 of @xmath116 under which the higgs field transformation includes a constant shift . however",
    "any such transformation does not commute with @xmath8 . without loss of generality",
    "we assume that the third entry has zero hypercharge , @xmath129 , so that @xmath130 is the prospective higgs doublet",
    ". then @xmath93 must contain generators @xmath131 or @xmath132 with @xmath133 a complex two component vector .",
    "both of these give the same linear shift on the prospective higgs field , as can be verified by computing @xmath134 .",
    "it follows that for either one of these generators we have @xmath135=x'\\ ] ] where @xmath136 is a generator of the form of @xmath137 .",
    "this means that the @xmath137 generators transform under @xmath138 as a tensor operator ; they are in fact complex doublets with hypercharge 1/2 , just like the higgs .",
    "now , there are additional generators in @xmath93 : at the very least it contains the @xmath9 subgroup generated by the top - left or bottom right @xmath139 blocks .",
    "together , @xmath137 and these additional generators transform as a _ reducible _ representation of the electroweak subgroup .",
    "it follows that a gauge invariant term in the lagrangian that is also invariant under @xmath93 is a sum of terms that are individually gauge invariant .",
    "the only exception is when the term is constructed of fields that are separately @xmath138 invariant , as is the case of the @xmath52 mass term , in , in the @xmath5model .",
    "but it is unnatural to choose the coefficients of these various terms to make their sum @xmath93 invariant .",
    "this is because the gauge interactions always break the symmetry .",
    "gauge boson exchange feynman diagrams like that of fig .",
    "[ fig : lambda - renor ] give divergent corrections to these couplings , and the corrections do not preserve the @xmath93 invariance .",
    "we can relax one assumption above slightly .",
    "we do not need to assume the vacuum alignment @xmath140 is along . in order to have a collective symmetry argument that one can already apply in the gauge sector",
    "one needs the first and last two rows and columns to be as in .",
    "but the central @xmath141 block does not have to be a diagonal matrix , only a unitary , symmetric matrix .",
    "however , the argument goes through as before : the components of @xmath142 that we identify with the higgs are changed in precisely the way that the shifts in are modified and the rest of the argument goes through unchanged .",
    "the explicit proof for the case @xmath143 is completely analogous .",
    "we turn now to the general case .",
    "we assume that @xmath2 contains the electroweak gauge group @xmath144 , with @xmath145 .",
    "we further assume that a subset of goldstone bosons can be identified with the higgs field .",
    "we consider a term in the lagrangian that is both symmetric under @xmath146 and has a collective symmetry @xmath93 .",
    "we show in the appendix that we only need to consider semi - simple @xmath93 , which we assume henceforth .    that the higgs transforms linearly under the electroweak gauge group means that there is a doublet @xmath147 in @xmath142 that transforms as @xmath148 under @xmath8 . under a group @xmath149 @xmath147",
    "transforms non - linearly , @xmath150 where the implicit sum over @xmath151 is over all generators in @xmath93 , for some two component complex vectors @xmath152 and the ellipses stand for terms at least linear in @xmath147 .",
    "one can redefine the basis of generators in @xmath93 so that @xmath153 for @xmath154 and @xmath152 for @xmath155 are unit vectors , with @xmath156 real and @xmath157 purely imaginary .",
    "now consider the commutator , @xmath158 the commutator is again a non - linear transformation , a linear combination of the same four generators in @xmath93 that shift the higgs . in terms of the lie algebra of @xmath1 , denoting these generators by @xmath159 , with runs over 1,2 because the hermitian matrices break into a symmetric and an antisymmetric part , corresponding to the two real and two imaginary components of @xmath152 , and also to the real and imagnary components of the higgs doublet . ] @xmath123 and the generators of @xmath146 by @xmath160 and @xmath161 , we read off @xmath162=\\frac{i}2(\\tau^a)^{ij}x^j,\\qquad [ y , x^i]=\\frac{i}2x^i\\ ] ] this is precisely the statement in eq .",
    ", derived there from the explicit form of matrices , that the generators transform as tensors of @xmath146 with the same quantum numbers as the higgs doublet , but we see now that it holds more generally , independently of those explicit matrix representations .    since there is no semi - simple lie algebra of rank 4 , there must be additional generators , and @xmath163 $ ] must give some of these additional generators .",
    "denote a non - vanishing commutator by @xmath164 $ ] . using the jacobi identity",
    "we see that @xmath165&=[q^a,[x^i , x^j]]\\\\    & = [ x^i,[q^a , x^j]]-[x^j,[q^a , x^i]]\\\\    & = \\frac{i}2(\\sigma^a)^{jk}x^{ik}-\\frac{i}2(\\sigma^a)^{ik}x^{jk}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] so these generators also satisfy an equation like but transform in a representation in the tensor product of two doublets . continuing this way",
    ", considering commutators of the generators we have so far , we can eventually generate the complete lie algebra and find that it breaks into sectors classified by irreducible representations under @xmath146 .",
    "we can use this to show that invariants under @xmath93 break into a sum of terms separately invariant under @xmath146 .",
    "any non - trivial invariant must be a product of two combination of fields , one transforming in some irreducible representation @xmath166 of @xmath93 and the other as the complex conjugate @xmath167 .",
    "but from the previous paragraph it follows that under @xmath146 the representation @xmath166 breaks into a direct sum @xmath168 of at least two irreducible representations of @xmath146 .",
    "therefore the product @xmath169 , contains the sum of at least two invariants under @xmath146 , @xmath170 and @xmath171 . since @xmath93 is not a symmetry of the theory ( because the kinetic energy term for the goldstone bosons is not invariant )",
    ", the two ( or more ) @xmath146 invariants can be summed into a @xmath93 invariant only by fine tuning coefficients in the lagrangian .",
    "this completes the argument",
    ".    it may not be self - evident that any non - trivial representation of @xmath93 breaks into two or more representations under @xmath146 .",
    "this can be shown by noting that the roots of the lie algebra , that is the weights of the adjoint representation , of @xmath93 break into a sum of irreducible representations of @xmath146 , precisely the same representations that the generators fall into .",
    "of the generators of @xmath1 , with @xmath172\\rangle$ ] .",
    "then @xmath173 and so on for the other generators of @xmath93 . ]",
    "then by following the same procedure as in establishing branching rules for representations of lie algebras , that is , introducing projection operators in weight space , and using the fact that the roots form irreducible representations , one obtains that every representation of @xmath93 is decomposed into a sum of irreducible representations of @xmath146 .",
    "we remarked above that @xmath88 factors in @xmath93 are ignored .",
    "this requires some explanation .",
    "after all , one could conceivably take the four broken generators to generate a collective symmetry group of dimension 4 , say @xmath174 or @xmath8 .",
    "but the @xmath88 symmetries do not help insure the higgs remains massless .",
    "it is easy to see why by considering first the familiar @xmath5  case .",
    "the @xmath51 and @xmath72 terms of that need to be related by collective symmetry to obtain necessary cancellations in one loop graphs can be made separately invariant under several @xmath88 symmetries .",
    "in fact , the situation is reversed from the semi - simple group case , where a representation @xmath166 of @xmath93 is a direct sum of at least two irreducible representation of @xmath146 .",
    "since the irreducible representations of @xmath88 are one dimensional , it is @xmath146 that relates several irreducible representation of @xmath88 , and forces them together into a term in the lagrangian .",
    "it is easy to see that the top quark couplings of the @xmath5  model are fine tuned in order to preserve collective symmetry .",
    "renormalization effects break the symmetry .",
    "these effects must also be present in the underlying uv completion so they can not be dismissed as small . in any case , they are generically too large for successful phenomenology even purely in the context of the fine tuned @xmath5model .",
    "the problem can not be circumvented by enlarging the model to one with a larger underlying flavor symmetry group .",
    "gauging collective symmetry is not an option : it either gives a higgsless model or again requires fine tuning to avoid quadratically divergent radiative corrections to the higgs mass .",
    "we have shown that the collective symmetry argument can not be implemented on the yukawa couplings of little higgs models without fine tuning .",
    "of course , no - go theorems are only as good as its assumptions .",
    "we did not prove that no model exists that can both include top quarks and solve the little hierarchy problem .",
    "for example , one can presumably partially supersymmetrize the model to ensure the cancellation of top loop induced quadratic mass divergences , at least at one loop .",
    "still , in the absence of a novel mechanism to suppress the quadratic divergences in the top quark induced radiative corrections to the higgs mass without fine tuning , much of the allure of these models is past .",
    "we show that the four generators @xmath159 in @xmath93 that produce the non - linear transformations of the four real components of the higgs field are in a subalgebra that generates a semi - simple subgroup of @xmath93 .",
    "our starting point are the commutation relations @xmath162=r(q^a)^{ij}x^j,\\qquad [ y , x^i]=r(y)^{ij}x^j.\\ ] ] these are part of the algebra of @xmath1 .",
