    "* background : * full - duplex ( fd ) communication , allowing devices to transmit and receive in the same frequency band at the same time , is a promising technology to double the spectral efficiency of future wireless communication systems  @xcite .",
    "recent studies have shown the performance improvement achievable with fd communication both theoretically  @xcite and experimentally  @xcite . the key challenge in realizing the benefits of fd communication is cancellation of the self - interference signal , which significantly corrupts the desired signal at the receiver  @xcite .",
    "there are two main approaches used in the literature to deal with this problem : ( i ) _ passive _ self - interference cancellation techniques , which attempt to isolate the transmit and receive antennas  @xcite and ( ii ) _ active _ self - interference cancellation techniques which use the knowledge of the self - interference signal to cancel the interference in the digital or the analog domain  @xcite .",
    "although the power of the self - interfering signal is reduced by passive techniques , the residual power can still distort the desired signal significantly .",
    "hence , it is important to have an accurate active cancellation stage .",
    "* motivation : * active cancellation requires additional processing of the received signal compared to passive cancellation . for this reason and to have an effective active cancellation , accurate knowledge of the desired and the self - interference channels should be obtained  @xcite .",
    "the approach commonly used in the literature is to use pilots and to silence the transmitting node while estimating the self - interference channel , i.e. , self - calibration .",
    "once the self - interference channel is estimated , pilots are transmitted for the estimation of the communication channel  @xcite .",
    "a semi - blind approach for channel estimation in full duplex communication systems is proposed in  @xcite , which still requires a few data - aided pilots to be transmitted .",
    "data - aided piloting is a type of pilot - based estimation , where pilots symbols and data symbols are sent in different time slots .",
    "hence , extra bandwidth is needed to estimate the channels  @xcite .",
    "since fd communication requires two channels to be estimated , blind channel estimators with no data - aided piloting are more attractive as they can significantly improve bandwidth efficiency .",
    "blind channel estimation for conventional half - duplex ( hd ) communication systems has been thoroughly investigated in the literature .",
    "it is well - known that blind estimators can only estimate the channel up to a scaling factor and can not recover the channel phases .",
    "the degree of this ambiguity can be determined using identifiability analysis , which determines whether a parameter can be uniquely estimated without any ambiguity  @xcite .",
    "recently , blind estimators have been proposed for emerging systems such as amplify and forward two way relay networks ( af - twrn )  @xcite and interference limited networks  @xcite .",
    "a shortcoming of recent research into blind estimators is a lack of parameter identifiability analysis , which has inhibited achieving ambiguity - free blind channel estimation .",
    "blind channel estimation in fd communication similarly requires a thorough identifiability analysis , with appropriate performance bounds and estimators .    * paper contributions : * blind channel estimation is investigated in a single - input single - output ( siso ) full duplex ( fd ) communication system .",
    "the novel contributions include :    * _ identifiability analysis : _ the condition for identifiability of channel parameters in fd communication systems is derived as theorem  [ theorem : identifiability ] , from which it follows that asymmetric modulation sets can be used for ambiguity - free channel estimation for communication systems involving two channels ( e.g. , fd communication , twrn , and interference limited systems ) without the need for data - aided piloting . *",
    "_ proposed modulation sets _ : based on theorem  [ theorem : identifiability ] , we propose ( i ) a shifted modulation set constructed by applying a constant shift to symmetric modulation sets such as @xmath0-ary phase shift keying ( @xmath0-psk ) and quadrature amplitude modulation ( qam ) , and ( ii ) a rotated modulation set constructed by applying an asymmetric rotation around the origin to symmetric modulation sets . * _ proposed estimators : _ we propose two estimators for simultaneous estimation of both interfering and communication channels using the new modulation sets : ( i ) a computationally efficient expectation maximization ( em ) estimator to numerically obtain maximum likelihood ( ml ) channel parameter estimates , and ( ii ) a closed form minimum mean square error ( mmse ) estimator to take advantage of known channel statistics , if available .",
    "the choice of mmse estimator is motivated as follows : ( i ) prior information about the communication and the self - interference channels may be available  @xcite , ( ii ) bayesian estimators are known to minimize the bayes risk cost function , i.e. , average mean square error ( mse ) , which is an important performance metric for assessing the performance of estimators  @xcite , and ( iii ) the mmse estimator is closed form , which in turn means it does not suffer from convergence issues and does not require initialization as opposed to the em estimator .",
    "since the non - data aided cramr - rao lower bound ( crlb ) or the bayesian crlb ( bcrlb ) are intractable , we derive the data - aided crlb and the data - aided bcrlb to assess the performance of these estimators .",
    "we will also show that in contrast to the proposed estimators , direct pilot - based techniques either require a synchronized receiver and transmitter with orthogonal piloting or self - calibration . * _ results : _ simulations show that proposed estimators ( i ) reach the performance of their corresponding lower variance bounds , ( ii ) are robust to an increasing self - interference power , ( iii ) can reach theperformance of corresponding data - aided bounds , when a rotated modulation set is used .",

    "<S> we consider blind channel estimation in a single - input single - output full - duplex communication system , where both the self - interference and the communication channels need to be accurately estimated . in this context , </S>",
    "<S> blind estimators are attractive as they improve bandwidth efficiency , but they suffer from a phase ambiguity problem . in this paper , we first formally define and analyse this ambiguity and mathematically show that asymmetric constellations with respect to the origin can be used for blind channel estimation with no phase ambiguity . </S>",
    "<S> we present examples that involve shifted and rotated modulation sets . </S>",
    "<S> we propose an expectation maximization ( em ) iterative estimator and a closed form minimum mean square error ( mmse ) estimator for the asymmetric modulation sets . </S>",
    "<S> since the non - data aided cramr - rao lower bound ( crlb ) and the bayesian crlb ( bcrlb ) are intractable , we derive their data - aided crlbs and bcrlbs to assess their performance . </S>",
    "<S> simulations of shifted modulation sets show that the proposed estimators ( i ) approach the performance of their corresponding lower bounds , ( ii ) are robust to self - interference of the full - duplex signal , ( iii ) using rotated modulation sets reach data - aided estimation performance .    </S>",
