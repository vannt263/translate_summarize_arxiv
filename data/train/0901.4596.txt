    "besides the gravity , only sm gauge singlets can propagate in the bulk not to violate the charge conservation  @xcite . the gauge - singlet dirac fermions @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) are introduced in the bulk which contain the right - handed neutrinos and their chiral partners .",

    "the heavy neutrino interactions to the sm fields are determined by the mixing matrix @xmath57 both in the gauge and higgs vertices .",
    "the @xmath67 matrix @xmath57 is determined by the matrix forms of neutrino masses in the original lagrangian @xmath68 .",
    "the matrix elements in @xmath57 have the experimental upper bounds from electroweak physics , as will be seen later .",
    "another important constraint on @xmath57 comes from the low - energy neutrino experiments , namely , the seesaw - induced masses should be of the order of ev scale , which in turn specifies the scale of heavy neutrino masses @xmath52 .",
    "this can be seen from the definition of @xmath57 by rewriting it with the light and heavy neutrino mass eigenvalues @xmath69 where @xmath70 is an arbitrary @xmath67 matrix with @xmath71 .",
    "therefore one naively expects that , with a fixed order of @xmath72 and @xmath73 for the discovery of experimental signatures of heavy neutrinos , their masses should be very light and satisfy @xmath74  kev ( this does not necessarily mean the seesaw operation is not justified as @xmath75 is fixed ) . the previous collider studies on tev - scale right - handed neutrinos  @xcite did not impose the seesaw relation   and have to rely on some assumptions for suppressing the necessarily induced masses @xmath49 . for example , the neutrino mass matrix has some singular generation structure , otherwise it leads to the decoupling of seesaw neutrinos from collider physics .",
    "a possible scenario for observable heavy neutrinos is to take a specific value of bulk majorana masses .",
    "here we assume that bulk dirac masses vanish but it is easy to include them by attaching wavefunction factors in the following formulas .",
    "the equations of motion without bulk majorana masses are solved by simple oscillators and the mass matrices in four - dimensional effective theory are found @xmath76    m_{k_{mn } } & = \\ ; \\frac{n}{r}\\delta_{mn}\\ , , & \\qquad\\;\\ ;    m_{l_{mn } } & = \\ ; \\delta_{mn}(m_a - m_v).\\end{aligned}\\]]from these , we find the seesaw - induced mass matrix and the mixing with heavy modes : @xmath77    \\nu & = & u_\\nu\\nu_d \\,+\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi r}}\\,m^\\dagger\\bigg[\\ ,    \\,\\frac{1}{m_a+m_v}\\,\\epsilon n_r^{\\,0\\ , * }    \\nonumber \\\\    & & \\qquad\\qquad    + \\sum_{n=1}\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{x^{2*}\\!-(n / r)^2}\\ ,    \\big[(m_a - m_v)^*\\epsilon n_r^{\\,n\\,*}+    \\frac{n}{r}\\,n_l^{\\,n}\\big]\\,\\bigg],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath78 . the effect of infinitely many numbers of kk neutrinos appears as the factor @xmath79 .",
    "an interesting case is that ( the eigenvalue(s ) of ) @xmath80 takes a specific value @xmath81 where @xmath82 contains half integers  @xcite : the seesaw - induced mass matrix @xmath49 is suppressed by the tangent factor ( not only by a large majorana mass scale ) , on the other hand , the heavy mode interaction @xmath57 is un - suppressed .",
    "this fact realizes the situation that right - handed neutrinos in the seesaw mechanism are observable at sizable rates in future collider experiments .",
    "one of the most exciting signals of higher - dimensional theory at collider experiments is the production of kk excited states .",
    "the signals could be observed at the lhc if new physics , which is responsible for the generation of neutrino masses , lies around the tev scale , and large yukawa couplings are allowed that lead to a sizable order of mixing between the left- and right - handed neutrinos .",
    "an immediate question is what processes we should pay attention to find out the signals .",
    "one important possibility is the like - sign di - leptons signal , @xmath83 , because the sm background against the signal is enough small .",
    "unfortunately , this process violates the lepton number which should be proportional to tiny majorana neutrino masses , and is therefore difficult to be observed at the lhc . in this letter",
    "we thus focus on lepton number preserving processes . while there are various types of such processes related to heavy neutrino productions , most of these would not be observable due to huge sm backgrounds .",
    "as we will see in the following , an exception suitable for the present purpose is the tri - lepton signal with large missing transverse energy ; @xmath84 and @xmath85 ( fig .",
    "[ fig:3leptons ] ) .",
    "they are possibly captured at the lhc since only small fractions of sm processes contribute to the background against the signal .        to investigate the signal quantitatively",
    ", we consider the five - dimensional seesaw theory as a simple example for providing realistic seesaw neutrino masses and observable collider signatures .",
    "the right - handed majorana masses are @xmath86 and @xmath87 and diagonalized in the generation space . in this letter",
    "it is assumed that these masses are also generation independent .",
    "as mentioned before , the effective neutrino majorana masses become tiny for @xmath88 , and thus , the right - handed neutrino masses can be @xmath89 , while keeping a non - negligible order of yukawa couplings and sizable electroweak gauge vertices for the heavy kk neutrinos .",
    "we parametrically introduce a small quantity @xmath90 as @xmath91 summing up the effects of heavy neutrinos,@xmath92 we obtain the seesaw - induced mass @xmath93 .",
    "a vanishing value of @xmath90 makes the light neutrinos exactly massless , where the complete cancellation occurs in the effects of heavy neutrinos which exhibit the dirac nature in this case .",
    "the @xmath66-th excited kk mode spectrum is @xmath94 .",
    "the electroweak gauge and higgs vertices are also evaluated from the lagrangian given in the previous section .",
    "for example , the neutrino yukawa matrix @xmath95 in the model is expressed as @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the @xmath98 orthogonal matrix , which generally comes in reconstructing high - energy quantities from the observable ones  @xcite .",
    "that corresponds to the matrix @xmath70 in .",
    "the model therefore contains the parameters @xmath8 , @xmath90 , @xmath75 , @xmath99 , and @xmath97 .",
    "the neutrino mass differences and the generation mixing parameters have been measured and we take their typical experimental values  @xcite : @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 , @xmath103 , and @xmath104 . in this letter",
    "we consider the neutrino mass spectrum with the normal hierarchy .",
    "the other cases of the inverted and degenerate mass patterns can also be analyzed in similar fashion .",
    "the majorana phases in @xmath99 have no physical relevance in the present work and are set to be zero .",
    "the remaining quantities suffer from experimental constraints in low - energy physics .",
    "in particular , the dominant constraint is found to come from the experimental search for lepton flavor - changing processes  @xcite .",
    "for a real orthogonal matrix @xmath97 , the limits imposed by lepton flavor conservation are summarized as @xmath105 which shows that the most severe limit is given by the 1 - 2 component , i.e.  the @xmath106 search .",
    "we fix @xmath107 as a typical example , and accordingly the dirac cp phase in @xmath99 is @xmath108 such that the effect of lepton flavor violation is minimized .",
    "it then turns out from that all the constraints are satisfied for @xmath109 . finally , the sm higgs mass is to be @xmath110 gev in evaluating the decay widths of heavy kk neutrinos ( @xmath111 ) .     with a fixed value @xmath112 ev.,height=264 ]",
    "now we are at the stage of investigating the tri - lepton signal of heavy neutrino productions at the lhc .",
    "since the tau lepton is hardly detected compared to the others , we consider the signal event including only electrons and muons .",
    "there are four kinds of tri - lepton signals : @xmath113 , @xmath114 , @xmath115 , and @xmath116 . in this work ,",
    "we use two combined signals which are composed of @xmath117 ( the @xmath118 signal ) and @xmath119 ( the @xmath120 signal ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : xsection ] shows the total cross sections for these signals from the 1st kk mode productions at the lhc .",
    "they are described as the functions of the compactification scale @xmath8 with @xmath121 being 10 ev .",
    "it is found from the figure that the cross section for the @xmath120 signal is about one order of magnitude larger than the @xmath118 signal .",
    "signal cross section becomes larger than the @xmath120 one .",
    "] we have also evaluated the cross sections of tri - lepton signals from heavier kk neutrinos and found that they are more than one order of magnitude smaller than the above and are out of reach of the lhc machine . a high luminosity collider with clean environment such as the international linear collider ( ilc )",
    "would distinctly discover the signatures of kk mode resonances .     and",

    "the integrated luminosity is taken to be 30 fb@xmath122.,height=264 ]    to clarify whether the tri - lepton signal is captured at the lhc , it is important to estimate sm backgrounds against the signal .",
    "the sm backgrounds which produce or mimic the tri - leptons final state have been studied  @xcite , and for the present purpose a useful kinematical cut is discussed to reduce these sm processes  @xcite . according to that work , we adopt the following kinematical cuts ;    * the existence of two like - sign charged leptons @xmath123 , @xmath124 , and an additional one with the opposite charge @xmath125 . *",

    "the results are depicted by assuming the integrated luminosity 30 fb@xmath122 . in order to estimate the efficiency for signal events due to the cuts",
    ", we have used the monte carlo simulation using the calchep code  @xcite . since the event numbers of sm backgrounds after the cut are about 260 for the @xmath118 signal and 110 for the @xmath120 signal  @xcite",

    "it is found that if @xmath132 is less than about 250 gev , the signals will be observed at the early run of the lhc , while a larger luminosity is needed for a smaller size of extra dimension to find its signals .",
    "we have discussed a seesaw scenario where right - handed neutrinos are around tev scale , accessible in near future particle experiments .",
    "the seesaw - induced mass scale is of the order of ev , while the right - handed neutrinos have sizable gauge and yukawa couplings to the sm sector .",
    "the scenario is a five - dimensional extension of the sm with right - handed neutrinos , where the ordinary sm particles locally live in four dimensions and the right - handed neutrinos exist in the bulk .",
    "the light neutrinos obtain tiny majorana masses due to the small lepton number violation , and therefore the same - sign di - lepton processes can not be observed .",
    "we have analyzed , as the most effective lhc signal , the lepton number preserving processes with tri - lepton final states , @xmath140 .",
    "it is found that the scenario gives enough excessive tri - lepton events beyond the sm backgrounds in wide regions of parameter space , and the lhc would discover the signs of tiny neutrino mass generation and extra dimensions .",
    "the possible experimental detections of neutrino mass generations have been discussed in other seesaw scenarios  @xcite . in the present analysis , only the 1st excited mode contributes to the signals .",
    "the observation of higher kk modes is expected to be within the reach of future collider experiments such as the ilc , which result makes the scenario substantially confirmed .",
