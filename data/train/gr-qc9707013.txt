    "random thermal fluctuations are expected to be the dominant noise source for the first interferometers in the laser interferometer gravitational wave observatory ( ligo ) at frequencies between @xmath5 and @xmath6 hz .",
    "this thermal noise is generally decomposed into a suspension thermal noise and an internal thermal noise for the test masses .",
    "the former can be traced back to the friction in the test masses pendular suspension system ; the latter is due to internal damping inside the test masses themselves .",
    "traditionally , themal noise calculations have been based on a normal - mode expansion @xcite,@xcite .",
    "however , gonzalez and saulson have also performed an exact calculation of the suspension thermal noise by applying directly the fluctuation - dissipation ( fd ) theorem @xcite in it s most general form , due to h.  b.  callan and t.  a.  welton @xcite . the purpose of this paper is to use the general method of gonzales and saulson to calculate the internal thermal noise .    in section",
    "ii we analyze a general situation when a measuring device ( e.g. a laser interferometer ) monitors the displacement of the surface of a test mass whose internal degrees of freedom are in themal equilibrium with each other .",
    "we develop a general formalism for using the fd theorem to calculate the thermal noise in the most general surface readout quantity . in brief",
    "our method is as follows :    to work out the thermal noise at a particular frequency @xmath7 , one should mentally apply pressure oscillating at this frequency to the observed surface of the test mass .",
    "the spatial variation of this pressure should mimic that of the light beam intensity ( for example , in the case of a gaussian beam this oscillating pressure has a gaussian profile of the same widthi as the beam ) .",
    "the thermal noise is then given by @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the boltzmann s constant and the temperature of the mirror respectively , @xmath11 is the amplitude of the oscillating force applied to the surface ( i.e. the pressure integrated over the surface ) , and @xmath12 is the time - averaged power dissipated in the test mass when this oscillating pressure is applied .    to demonstrate the computational power of this general approach , in section iii we consider the case of a cylindrical fused silica test mass monitored by a circular gaussian laser beam . for the case",
    "when the radius of the beam is much less then the size of the test mass and the dissipation is uniformly distributed throughout test mass volume , we derive an analytical expression for the thermal noise [ cf .",
    "( [ eq : tn3 ] ) of section iii ] : @xmath13 .",

( [ eq : ym ] ) ] of the test - mass material , @xmath4 is the radius of the laser beam ( which is defined here as a radius at which the intensity of light is @xmath17 of the maximum intensity ) , @xmath18 is a characteristic size of the test mass , and @xmath19 in the case of a gaussian beam .",
    "putting numbers in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : tn1 ] ) and ( [ eq : tn2 ] ) , we find that our results are in agreement with those of raab and gillespie @xcite , who used the more complicated and computationally involved method of normal - mode decomposition .",
    "it is interesting to note that as @xmath20 tends to zero , our simple analytical formula becomes more precise , whereas the more complicated and computationally involved method of normal - mode decomposition requires summing over a larger number of modes and thus becomes computationally more expensive .    not only can the normal - mode decomposition be computationally expensive , it can also be misleading .",
    "we demonstrate this point in section iv by considering a test mass which has a lossy surface , e.g. due to a lossy mirror coating .",
    "we estimate the contribution of the surface to the thermal noise using the general method of section ii , and show that it differs from the estimate obtained by the method of normal modes ( which gives a result too small by a factor of at least @xmath21 ) .",
    "this breakdown of the normal - mode analysis will in general happen when the sources of friction are not distributed homogeneously over the test mass .",
    "the fundamental reason is that in this case different normal modes can have a common langevin driving force ( which is not so if the defects are distributed homogeneously ) .",
    "our analysis shows that thermal noise due to surface losses near the laser beam spot scales as @xmath22 , whereas thermal noise due to volume losses scales as @xmath3 .",
    "correspondingly , for small beam spots the surface losses could become significant . to protect against this",
    ", it is important to keep the surface near the laser beam spot as free of potential sources of friction as possible .",
    "for concreteness , consider a situation where ligo s laser beam is shining on the circular surface of one of ligo s cylindrical test masses .",
    "the phase shift of the reflected light contains information about the motion of the test mass s surface .",
    "the variable read out by this procedure can be written as @xmath23 here @xmath24 is the transverse location of a point on the test - mass surface , and @xmath25 is the displacement of the boundary along the direction of the laser beam at point @xmath24 and time @xmath26 .",
    "the form factor @xmath27 depends on the laser beam profile and is proportional to the laser light intensity at the point @xmath24 @xcite ; it is normalized by @xmath28 .",
    "the internal thermal noise of the test mass is defined as the fluctuations in @xmath29 , and our objective is to find the spectral density @xmath1 of these fluctuations .",
    "we assume that the test mass is in thermal equilibrium at temperature @xmath10 .",

    "this complex impedance can be understood and computed as follows .",
    "introduce a special set of generalized coordinates for the test mass s degrees of freedom  a set for which @xmath33 is one of the coordinates .",
    "( since @xmath33 is not the coordinate of a normal mode of the test mass , these generalized coordinates will not be the usual ones associated with normal modes . )",
    "apply to the test mass a generalized force @xmath34 that drives the generalized momentum conjugate to @xmath33 but does not drive any of the other generalized momenta .",
    "this generalized force will show up as the following interaction term in the test mass s hamiltonian : @xmath35 this driving force , together with the test mass s internal elastic forces and internal dissipation , will generate a time evolution @xmath29 of the observable @xmath33 .",
    "denote by @xmath36 and @xmath37 the fourier transforms of the ( arbitrary ) driving force @xmath34 and the observable s response @xmath29 .",
    "then the impedance that appears in the thermal noise formula eq .",

    "( [ eq : impedance1 ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ eq : fd1 ] ) , we get @xmath47    equation ( [ eq : fd2 ] ) is the most important equation of this paper .",

    "2 .   work out the average power @xmath44 dissipated in the test mass under the action of this oscillatory pressure .",
    "3 .   use @xmath11 and @xmath44 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fd2 ] ) to calculate @xmath1 .",
    "this procedure is different from the one employed in previous calculations of internal thermal noise for the ligo and virgo test masses @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the previous authors decomposed a test mass s motion into normal elastic modes ; then they calculated the contribution of each mode to @xmath49 independently and added up these contributions .",
    "this method of `` normal - mode decomposition '' works fine in many cases , but it has two drawbacks :    1 .",
    "the fundamental assumption in this method is that different normal modes have independent langevin forces .",
    "this assumption is correct only if the sources of friction are homogeneously distributed over the test - mass volume .",
    "it breaks down if the defects are more concentrated in one place than in others for example , when there is significant damping concentrated in the test - mass surface .",
    "we will return to this in section iv .",
    "2 .   for a small laser beam diameter",
    "the sum over normal modes converges very slowly , so one has to sum over many modes , which may be computationally expensive .",
    "by contrast , using the new method described in this paper , one can write down a simple analytic expression for the low - frequency noise in the case of a narrow laser beam . in the next section",
    "we derive this expression and make comparison with the normal - mode decomposition results derived in @xcite .",
    "consider the case where all the friction in the test mass comes from homogeneously distributed damping .",
    "it is conventional to characterize such friction by an imaginary part of the material s young s modulus : @xmath50 ; \\label{eq : ym}\\ ] ] @xmath51 is called the material s `` loss angle '' .",

    "see @xcite for some healthy scepticism ) . in this @xmath7-independent case",

    "( [ eq : tn3 ] ) can only be used for order - of - magnitude estimates . to work out the exact value of the internal thermal noise",

    "( [ eq : wdiss1 ] ) and ( [ eq : fd2 ] ) , @xmath49 .",
    "the exact answer for the mirror and light spot parameters given above is @xmath73 which is consistent ( better than expected ) with our analytical approximation .",
    "the purpose of the present section is to convince the reader that the method presented in this paper is correct and could be computationally cheaper than the normal - mode expansion .",
    "the next section concentrates on the cases where a direct application of the fd theorem can be crucial for getting the right results , and the method of normal - mode decomposition fails .",
    "in this section we study thermal noise due to surface losses  caused , e.g. , by inadequate polishing or by a lossy mirror coating .    from eq .",
    "( [ eq : fd2 ] ) we see that the key quantity in the thermal noise calculation is the power dissipated in the test mass when an oscillating pressure is applied to the laser beam spot on the test - mass surface .",
    "the power dissipated at each point of the material is proportional to the square of the stress at this point .",
    "most of the surface stress is in or near the spot to which the pressure is applied , so @xmath74 thus the thermal noise due to the surface damping scales like @xmath75 for comparison , the thermal noise due to bulk damping [ eq .",
    "( [ eq : tn3 ] ) ] scales as @xmath76 thus as the spot size decreases , the thermal noise due to surface damping grows faster than that due to bulk damping .",
    "contrast this conclusion with the intuition one gets from normal - mode decomposition . there one is concerned with how much the surface contributes to the quality factors ( @xmath77 s ) of the normal modes . for a typical mode",
    "the strain at the surface is at most of the same order as the characteristic strain inside the test mass ( likely , much less for first few modes  because of the free boundary condition ) .",
    "therefore , one would presume that the surface contributes no more than some mode - independent fraction of the test mass s @xmath77 s . in order of magnitude",
    "this fraction should be the ratio of the power dissipated in the surface to that in the bulk if one applies an oscillating pressure uniformally to the whole surface , which in the context of our method corresponds to a beam radius of @xmath18 .",
    "therefore the normal - mode estimate of the surface thermal noise is at least @xmath20 less than the correct value .",
    "current experiments show that the mirror coating does not contribute significantly to the @xmath78 of the test - mass normal modes .",
    "the conclusion commonly made is that coating is also not likely to contribute significantly to the internal thermal noise .",
    "the above analysis shows that this conclusion is not justified and that there might be a significant contribution of the coating to the internal thermal noise , despite the fact that @xmath77 s are not significantly changed .",
    "the normal - mode decomposition of the thermal noise is exact when the defects are distributed homogeneously through the volume of the test mass .",
    "however , as was shown explicitly in section iv for the case of surface losses , when the defect distribution is not homogeneous , the normal - mode decomposition may be misleading , and a direct application of the fluctuation - dissipation theorem is required .",
    "thermal noise is ultimately linked to friction in the test mass ; this friction is caused by various ( structural and otherwise ) defects .",
    "those defects which are closer to the beam spot will contribute more to the thermal noise that is read out by the laser beam s phase shift .",
    "although this fact is a direct consequence of the formalism developed in this paper , we would like to give an intuitive example in order to emphasize this point .",
    "consider , for the sake of simplicity , a one dimensional elastic test mass with two identical defects a and b , as shown on fig .  1 ; a is closer to the beam spot than b. each of these defects creates a random stress which pushes apart or pulls together the left and right ( relative to the defect ) parts of the test mass .",
    "by conservation of momentum , the part of the test mass which is lighter will respond more to the random stress than the other part ; therefore defect a will have a larger effect on the optical readout than the b.    note that if the defects a and b are positioned symmetrically with respect to the centre of the test mass , they will have the same effect on the @xmath77 s of all elastic modes ( we assume for simplicity that only one - dimensional longitudinal modes are present  and all of them are either symmetric or antisymmetric with respect to the centre ) .",
    "the normal - mode decomposition applied to the test - mass with just one defect  a or b  would give the same result for the thermal noise as read by the laser .",
    "clearly , we have found yet another illustration of the breakdown of the normal - mode decomposition .",
    "the considerations presented above lead to the following advice for real experiments : keep the neighbourhood of the laser beam spot as clean of defects as possible .",
    "not only does our direct applicatin of the fluctuation - dissipation theorem have broader validity than the normal - mode decomposition ; it is also be computationally simpler . in the case of",
    "homogeneous structural damping it yields a simple analytical expression for the internal thermal noise spectrum [ cf .",
    "( [ eq : tn3 ] ) ] : @xmath79 .",
    "\\label{eq : tn4}\\ ] ] this result is consistent with the numerical sum - over - modes done in ref .",
    "@xcite and is accurate when the radius of the laser beam is small relative to the size of the test mass , i.e. in the regime when the sum over modes converges especially slowly .",
    "when @xmath20 is not small , a numerical solution of the elasticity equations to deduce the dissipation power @xmath44 , and thence the thermal noise ( 10 ) , is straightforward and is probably also much simpler than performing a sum over modes .",
    "this work would not have been possible without discussions and help from vladimir braginsky , ron drever , darrell harrington , nergis mavalvala , fred raab , glenn soberman and kip thorne . in particular , glenn soberman suggested the method of integration in eq .",
