    ", one can redefine the above invariants specifically for the canonical contact structure @xmath1 on the link of a complex surface singularity ( cf .",

    "we find this result interesting since there are other instances in geometric - topology , where the `` complex representatives '' are minimizers .",

    "so a compact manifold with boundary ( and a complex structure @xmath83 on its interior ) is a stein domain if it admits a proper plurisubharmonic function @xmath84 which is constant on the boundary .",
    "then the complex line distribution induced by @xmath83 is a contact structure @xmath9 on @xmath3 . in this case",
    "we say that the contact @xmath0-manifold @xmath70 is _ stein fillable _ and @xmath85 is a called a _ stein filling _ of @xmath86 .",
    "it is a deep result of eliashberg and gromov @xcite that every stein fillable contact structure is tight .",
    "recall that a knot in a contact @xmath0-manifold is called legendrian if it is everywhere tangent to the contact planes . in order to have a better understanding of the topological constructions in the later sections , we discuss a standard way to visualize legendrian knots in @xmath87 ( actually in @xmath88 ) equipped with the standard contact structure @xmath89 .",
    "consider a legendrian knot @xmath90 and take its _ front _ projection , i.e. , its projection to the @xmath91-plane .",
    "notice that the projection has no vertical tangencies ( since @xmath92 ) , and for the same reason at a crossing the strand with smaller slope is in front .",
    "it turns out that @xmath4 can be @xmath93-approximated by a legendrian knot for which the projection has only transverse double points and _ cusp _ singularities ( see @xcite , for example ) .",
    "conversely , a knot projection with these properties gives rise to a unique legendrian knot in @xmath94  define @xmath95 from the projection as @xmath96 . since any projection can be isotoped to satisfy the above properties , one can easily see that every knot can be isotoped to legendrian position .",

    "another invariant , the _ rotation number _",
    "@xmath101 can be defined by trivializing @xmath102 along @xmath4 and then taking the winding number of @xmath103 . for this invariant to make sense we need to orient @xmath4 , and the result will change sign when reversing orientation . since @xmath104 , this number will be independent of the chosen trivialization . for the rotation number",
