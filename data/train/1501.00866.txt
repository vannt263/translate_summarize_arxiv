    "recently , there has been a renewed interest in investigating electrostatic disturbances in pair - plasmas and , in particular , plasmas with a pair of ions @xcite . however",
    ", nonthermal pair plasmas may frequently occur not only in semiconductors in the form of electron and ion holes , but also in many astrophysical environments , e.g. , pulsars , magnetars , as well as in the early universe , active galactic nuclei and supernova remnants in the form of electrons and positrons @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "a number of experiments have been conducted to create pair - ion plasmas using fullerene as ion source @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it has been observed that the dust particles injected into a pair - ion plasma ( e.g. , @xmath0 plasmas ) can become positively charged when the number density of negative ions greatly exceeds that of electrons ( @xmath1 ) @xcite .",
    "these pose some possibilities to investigate collective behaviors as well as the formation of nonlinear coherent structures in pair - ion plasmas under controlled conditions .",
    "the formation of phase space holes in pure pair - ion plasmas @xcite as well as ion holes in dusty pair - ion plasmas @xcite in the propagation of large amplitude electrostatic waves have been investigated in the recent past in which ions have been treated as trapped in self - created localized electrostatic potentials as prescribed by schamel @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we present a theoretical study on the formation and the dynamics of small - amplitude solitary structures in a dusty plasma composed of charged dust particles and a pair of ions without electrons . in our theoretical model",
    "the massive charged dusts are described by a set of fluid equations , while the dynamics of both positive and negative ions are governed by kinetic vlasov equations . using the reductive perturbation technique",
    "we show that the evolution of small - amplitude electrostatic waves can be described by a korteweg - de vries ( kdv)-like equation with a complex coefficient of the nonlinearity .",
    "a stationary as well as numerical solutions of the kdv equation are obtained and analyzed with the effects of external magnetic field , the dust pressure as well as different mass and temperatures of ions .",
    "we consider the nonlinear propagation of dust - acoustic ( da ) solitary waves in a magnetized dusty plasma which consists of positively or negatively charged mobile dusts and a pair of trapped ions with vortex - like distributions .",
    "the dust particles are assumed to have equal mass and constant charge .",
    "the collisions of all particles are also neglected compared to the dust plasma period .",
    "furthermore , in dusty pair - ion plasmas the ratio of electric charge to mass of dust particles remains much smaller than those of positive and negative ions .",
    "we also assume that the size of the dust grains is small compared to the average interparticle distance .",
    "the static magnetic field is considered along the @xmath2-axis , i.e. , @xmath3 . while the dynamics of massive charged dusts in the propagation of da waves ( @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the thermal velocity of j - th species particles and @xmath6 is the phase velocity of the wave ) is described by a set of fluid equations and , the dynamics of singly charged positive and negative ions are described by the vlasov equations .",
    "@xmath7 @xmath8 @xmath9 the system of equations is then closed by the poisson equation @xmath10 in eqs . - ,",
    "@xmath11 and @xmath12 respectively , denote the charge , number density ( with its equilibrium value @xmath13 ) , velocity , velocity distribution function , and mass of @xmath14-species particles .",
    "also , @xmath15 with @xmath16 denoting for positively / negatively charged dusts and @xmath17 the charge state .",
    "also , @xmath18 is the electric field with @xmath19 denoting the electrostatic potential and @xmath20 is the dust thermal pressure given by the adiabatic equation of state @xmath21 . here , @xmath22 is the adiabatic index for three - dimensional configuration and @xmath23 is the equilibrium dust pressure with @xmath24 denoting the boltzmann constant and @xmath25 the thermodynamic temperature of @xmath14-species particles .",
    "furthermore , the ion densities are given by @xmath26 in what follows , we recast eqs . - in terms of dimensionless variables .",
    "to this end the physical quantities are normalized according to @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 with @xmath30 denoting the elementary charge , @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the dust - acoustic speed with @xmath33 and @xmath34 denoting , respectively , the dust plasma frequency and the plasma debye length .",
    "the space and time variables are normalized by @xmath35 and @xmath36 respectively .",
    "thus , from eqs . - we have following set of normalized equations .",
    "@xmath37 @xmath38 @xmath39 @xmath40 @xmath41 where @xmath42 , @xmath43 for positively / negatively charged dusts , @xmath44 is the dust - cyclotron frequency normalized by the dust plasma frequency , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 for positive / negative ions and @xmath48 are the density ratios @xmath49 which satisfy the following charge neutrality condition at equilibrium : @xmath50        we neglect the ion inertial effects compared to the charged dusts , i.e. , @xmath51 in eq . .",
    "the distribution functions @xmath52 for positive and negative ions , which are constant of motion of the vlasov eq .",
    ", are chosen @xcite for the excitation of localized solitary waves so that ( i ) they are continuous , and both the free particle distributions are maxwellian distribution where @xmath53 at @xmath54 and trapped particles are absent , ( ii ) both trapped particle distributions are maxwellian ( with also negative temperatures ) .",
    "thus , @xmath52 ( for free and trapped particles ) are ( with a suitable choice of the normalization constants ) @xcite for positive ions @xmath55,~|v|>\\sqrt{-2\\phi } , \\label{dist - fpf}\\ ] ] @xmath56,~|v|\\leq\\sqrt{-2\\phi } , \\label{dist - fpt}\\ ] ] and for negative ions @xmath57,~|v|>\\sqrt{2\\phi / m } , \\label{dist - fnf}\\ ] ] @xmath58,~|v|\\leq\\sqrt{2\\phi / m } , \\label{dist - fnt}\\ ] ] where @xmath59 is the mass ratio , @xmath60 is the temperature ratio and @xmath61 , for @xmath62 , measure the inverse of the trapped positive and negative ion temperatures which may be negative @xmath63 corresponding to a depression in the trapped particle distribution .",
    "the case of @xmath64 represents the plateau ( constant or flat - topped ) and @xmath65 corresponds to the boltzmann distribution of ions .",
    "next , integrating the particle distribution functions - over the velocity space , i.e. , using eq .",
    "we obtain the number densities @xmath66 for positive and negative ions as @xmath67 @xmath68 where @xmath69 $ ] .",
    "the error and dawson functions @xmath70 and @xmath71 are , respectively , given by @xmath72 in the small amplitude limit @xmath73 , so that @xmath74 , we obtain from eqs . and the following expressions for the number densities @xcite @xmath75 @xmath76",
    "in order to derive the evolution equation for the da waves , we transform the space and time variables according to @xcite @xmath77 where @xmath78 is a small parameter measuring the strength of nonlinearity . the dependent variables are expanded as @xcite @xmath79 the anisotropy in eq . for the transverse velocity components of dust fluids",
    "is introduced on the assumption that the dust gyromotion is a higher - order effect than the motion parallel to the magnetic field .",
    "next , we substitute eqs . and into eqs .",
    "- and equate different powers of @xmath78 successively . in the lowest order @xmath80 , we obtain the following first - order quantities @xmath81 @xmath82 and the dispersion relation for the nonlinear wave speed given by @xmath83 replacing @xmath84 by @xmath85 , one can obtain the same dispersion relation after fourier analyzing the linearized basic equations - , i.e. , assuming the perturbations as oscillations with the wave frequency @xmath86 and the wave number @xmath87 .",
    "we find that the phase speed @xmath84 ( normalized by the dia speed @xmath88 ) can be larger or smaller than the unity depending on the choice of the parameter values .",
    "the value of @xmath84 increases with increasing values of both @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "however , its values can slowly decrease with increasing values of the density ratios @xmath91 as well as the temperature ratio @xmath92 . from eq .",
    ", collecting the coefficients of @xmath93 we obtain @xmath94 similarly , equating the coefficients of @xmath95 from the @xmath96- and @xmath97-components of eq . , and the coefficients of @xmath93 from the @xmath2-component of eq .",
    "we successively obtain @xmath98 , \\label{moment - xy-2nd}\\ ] ] @xmath99 from the coefficients of @xmath95 of eq .",
    ", we obtain an equation in which @xmath100 is eliminated by the use of eqs . , and , and the coefficient of @xmath101 vanishes by eq . .",
    "thus , arranging the terms and using eq .",
    "one obtains the following kdv - like equation @xmath102 where @xmath103 .",
    "it follows that eq .",
    "has a complex solution for @xmath104 .",
    "typically , for @xmath105 , where @xmath106 is a real function of @xmath107 and @xmath108 , and @xmath109 is a constant , one can have @xmath110 .",
    "thus , eq . can be written as @xmath111 where the coefficients of nonlinearity @xmath112 and dispersion @xmath113 are given by @xmath114 @xmath115.\\ ] ] the nonlinear coefficient @xmath116 becomes complex due to vortex - like distributions of two oppositely charged particles . in absence of one of them , @xmath116 becomes real , and one can then obtain solitary waves with positive or negative potential . a stationary soliton solution of eq .",
    "can easily be obtained with its absolute value as ( for details see appendix a ) @xmath117,\\label{soliton - sol}\\ ] ] where @xmath118 is a constant , and @xmath119 and @xmath120 are the amplitude and width of the soliton respectively .",
    "we numerically analyze the solution with different plasma parameters as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : figure1 ] . since @xmath121 represents the reciprocal temperature of the trapped positive and negative ions , and can be allowed from their negative to positive values corresponding to different trapped particle distributions , we consider negative , zero as well as positive values of @xmath61 .    from fig .",
    "[ fig : figure1](a ) , it is seen that as @xmath61 increases from @xmath122 ( corresponding to a constant or flat - topped distribution of ions ) to @xmath123 ( corresponding to the boltzmann distributions of ions ) , both the amplitude and width of the soliton increase ( see the solid and dashed lines ) .",
    "note here that the values of @xmath124 , for which the influence of the trapped ions are inverted , may be physically unrealistic as those correspond to a more steepened wave which can become unstable due to more peaked bump of the ion distributions .",
    "however , as the absolute value of @xmath116 starts increasing for @xmath125 , which corresponds to a depression in the trapped particle distribution , both the amplitude and width of the soliton are reduced ( see the dotted line ) .",
    "the same can further be enhanced for values of @xmath61 satisfying @xmath126 ( see the dash - dotted line ) .",
    "figure [ fig : figure1](b ) shows the soliton profile with the influence of the external magnetic field . since @xmath127 contributes only to the dispersive coefficient @xmath128 of eq . , the effect of the magnetic field with increasing its intensity is to reduce the width ( without changing the amplitude ) of the soliton .",
    "thus , the external magnetic field makes the solitary structure more spiky .",
    "however , for stronger magnetic fields with @xmath129 , the width remains almost unaltered as in this case @xmath130 .",
    "the thermal effects of charged dusts are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : figure1](c )",
    ". it is found that the effect of the dust thermal pressure @xmath90 is to enhance both the amplitude and width of the soliton .",
    "the enhancement is due to the fact that as @xmath90 increases , the values of @xmath131 @xmath113 decrease ( increase ) , and hence the increase in both the amplitude and width",
    ". however , an opposite trend occurs by the effects of the positive to negative ion temperature ratio @xmath92 ( not shown in the figure ) .",
    "typically , it reduces both the soliton amplitude and width significantly with a small increment of its value .",
    "figure [ fig : figure1](d ) exhibits the effects of the obliqueness of propagation @xmath89 and the relative ( to dusts ) concentration of positive ions @xmath132 .",
    "we find that both the amplitude and width of the soliton are greatly enhanced by a small increment of @xmath89 [ since @xmath133 @xmath113 is inversely ( directly ) proportional to @xmath89 ] .",
    "however , as the positive ion concentration increases , the amplitude gets reduced but the width increases .",
    "next , we numerically solve eq . by the runge - kutta scheme with an initial condition of the form @xmath135 and time step @xmath136 .",
    "the development of the wave form @xmath137 after a finite interval of time is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : figure2 ] .",
    "the parameter values are considered as the same as for the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : figure1](d ) .",
    "it is seen that the leading part of the initial wave steepens due to positive nonlinearity .",
    "as the time goes on the pulse separates into solitons and a residue due to the wave dispersion [ see the subplots ( a ) and ( b ) ] .",
    "it is found that once the solitons are formed and separated , they propagate in the forward direction without changing their shape due to the nice balance of the nonlinearity and dispersion [ see the subplots ( c ) and ( d ) ] .",
    "we have investigated the nonlinear propagation of dust - acoustic waves in a magnetized plasma which consists of warm positively charged dusts and a pair of free , as well as , trapped ions .",
    "we have shown that the evolution of small - amplitude da waves can be described by a kdv - type equation with a complex coefficient of the nonlinearity .",
    "such complex coefficient appears due to vortex - like distributions of both the ion species .",
    "the kdv equation is solved both analytically and numerically .",
    "the properties of the absolute value of @xmath104 are only exhibited graphically .",
    "it is shown that while the external magnetic field only influences the width of the soliton , the trapped ion temperatures , the thermal pressures of ions and dusts , the relative concentration of positive ions as well as the obliqueness of propagation have significant effects on both the amplitude and width of the solitons .",
    "we stress that other solutions @xcite than those presented here of the complex kdv equation could of interest but beyond the scope of the present work . to conclude , the present results should be useful in understanding the nonlinear features of electrostatic localized disturbances in laboratory and space plasmas .",
