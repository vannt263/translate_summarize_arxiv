    "ii ) _ on the signal frequency , at fixed signal and noise levels . the possible use of sr in connection with _ weak _ signal detection experiments has been repeatedly suggested .",
    "the only meaningful comparison between different detection strategies is to compare the related detection probabilities at the same level of false alarm probabilities and available signal - to - noise ratios . in this connection ,",
    "as demonstrated in @xcite and @xcite , sr based detectors do _ not _ outperform matched filters . in @xcite",
    "it was further shown that using sr as a pre - processor ( signal - to - noise ratio enhancer ) does _ not _ improve the performance of a matched - filter detector .",
    "nonetheless , strobed sign counting detectors could be interesting as computationally cheap alternatives to noncoherent correlators , as discussed in @xcite and summarized in the next section .",
    "the possibly simplest sr - paradigm is the langevin system @xcite : \\ {    l = -+a(_s t+)+n(t ) , +   + x(0)=x_0 ,    .",

    "symmetry breaking of the output pdf is perhaps @xcite the most natural signature of @xmath6 in ( [ eq : lang ] ) . in @xcite",
    "we gave a thorough evaluation in terms of receiver ( detection ) operating characteristics ( henceforth rocs ) of the possibly simplest non - parametric detector based on the above symmetry - breaking , where from the output samples ( [ eq : strob_tim ] ) , one forms the time series x_k=(-)^k x(t_k ) , and compares n_+=_k=0 ^ 2n-1 u(x_k ) [ eq : known_phi ] where @xmath7 is heaviside s step function , to a suitable threshold @xmath8 .",
    "the above will be henceforth referred to as strobed sign - counting stochastic resonance detector ( ssc - srd ) .",

    "the related rocs are typically worse by @xmath12 as compared to those of the matched filter @xcite .    generalization to the case where the initial phase of the sought signal is unknown is straightforward , by letting :    n_+=_m ( 0,n_s ) _",

    ". optimum benchmark detector for signals with unknown initial phase ) .    on the other hand , the ssc - srd is computationally _ extremely cheap",
    "_ , requiring only binary and/or integer arithmetics , and thus quite appealing .    the obvious question is now related to the _ rejection properties _ of the above detector , namely to its ability to _ discriminate _ between spectrally nearby signals ( sought and unwanted ) with comparable amplitudes .",
    "note in this connection that the frequency response of the ssc - srd depends very little on the _ stochastic resonance _",
    "condition , as shown in fig . 1 ( see @xcite ) , where the steady - state value of @xmath15=\\max_t[\\mbox{prob}(x(t ) > 0)]$ ] is displayed for several values of the @xmath16 as a function of @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the signal angular frequency and @xmath19 is the kramers time .",
    "in fig . 1 @xmath20 is the normalized potential - barrier height",
    ".    a numerical investigation of this issue will be the subject of the next section .",
    "in order to evaluate the performance of the above described ssc - srd in the presence of spectrally nearby signals with comparable amplitude , we introduce the following dimensionless parameters : _ s= ,   = | | ,   = _ w-_u , representing the unwanted - to - wanted ( sought ) signal - to - signal ratio ( @xmath21 ) , the ( scaled ) frequency difference , and the phase lag , where the suffixes @xmath22 and @xmath23 refer to the wanted and unwanted signal , respectively . more or less obviously , we also define the false - alarm ( @xmath24 and false - dismissal ( @xmath25 ) probabilities as follows : = \\ { n_+ > | s_w(t)=0  and  s_u(t ) 0 } , = \\ { n_+ < |",
    "s_w(t ) 0  and  s_u(t ) 0 } .",
    "representative numerical simulations @xcite are accordingly summarized in fig.s 2 to 5 below .",
    "figure 2 describes a situation where @xmath26 , and the unwanted signal frequency is pretty close to the sought one ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "only two detection characteristics are displayed , corresponding to @xmath28 for the sake of readability , together with the limiting curve corresponding to the absence of the unwanted signal ( dashed line ) .",
    "it is seen that the detector s performance is only slightly deteriorated due to the presence of the unwanted signal .    in fig .",
    "3 the @xmath21 is fixed at ( @xmath29 ) , and two different ( normalised ) frequency separations @xmath30 are considered . the limiting curve corresponding to the absence of the unwanted signal ( dashed line ) is also included . again , the detector s performance is not appreciably spoiled .    in fig .",
    "4 the unwanted signal amplitude and spectral separation are fixed , @xmath29 and @xmath27 , and two values of the phase lag are considered , @xmath31 . once more , the detector s performance is negligibly affected .",
    "finally , fig .",
    "5 shows the key role played by the number of strobed samples used in ( [ eq : pick_max ] ) at fixed @xmath29 , @xmath27 , @xmath32 on the ssc - sr detector s rejection performance .",
    "it is seen that the unwanted signal is rejected for @xmath33 , for which the time series length corresponds to the spectral width required to separate the wanted and unwanted signals .",
    "this shows that the rejection properties are essentially related to the spectral filtering inherent to the strobing process .",
    "numerical simulations suggest that strobed - sign - counting stochastic - resonance - based detectors besides being computationally cheap , and nearly as much performing as the standard non - coherent correlator , do display nice rejection properties in the presence of spectrally nearby signals with comparable amplitudes .",
    "further study is under way to evaluate the potential of ssc - sr detectors in connection , e.g. , with the search of weak nearby quasi - monochromatic signals in the context of the search of gravitational waves .",
