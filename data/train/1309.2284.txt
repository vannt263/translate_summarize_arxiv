    "a merger between two galaxies , each with its own central supermassive black hole ( smbh ) , results in a merger - remnant galaxy hosting two smbhs . as these smbhs orbit in the potential of the host galaxy , they are dragged closer together by dynamical friction from the surrounding stars , form a gravitationally - bound binary system , and ultimately merge @xcite . while the smbhs are at kiloparsec ( kpc ) scale separations , before they are bound as a binary system , they are known as dual smbhs .",
    "gas churned up by the galaxy merger may accrete onto the dual smbhs , and cases where one or both of the smbhs fuel active galactic nuclei ( agns ) are known as offset agns and dual agns , respectively .",
    "these offset and dual agns , which we refer to here as having separations @xmath9 kpc , have valuable potential as new observational tools for studies of galaxy evolution , including measurements of galaxy merger rates , smbh mass growth , and smbh merger rates .    however ,",
    "because of their small spatial separations from the host galaxy centers , offset and dual agns are challenging to identify . as a consequence , early discoveries of offset agns and dual agns were serendipitous @xcite . while ultra - hard x - rays have been used to uncover a handful of dual agns @xcite , serendipitous discoveries of dual agn candidates continue today ( e.g. , @xcite ) . to accelerate the discovery rate of offset and dual agns , a new systematic approach was developed to identify candidates in spectroscopic surveys of galaxies .",
    "this technique uses galaxy spectra to select offset and dual agn candidates as narrow agn emission lines with line - of - sight velocity offsets of a few hundred km s@xmath10 relative to the host galaxy stellar absorption features .",
    "offset agn candidates display velocity offsets in single - peaked narrow agn emission lines relative to stellar absorption lines , while the dual agn candidates have double - peaked narrow lines .",
    "numerical simulations of agn activity in galaxy mergers show that these double - peaked lines are indeed useful selectors of dual agns @xcite .",
    "the velocity - offset approach was first applied systematically to the deep2 galaxy redshift survey , where it was used to identify 30 offset agn candidates @xcite and two dual agn candidates @xcite at @xmath11 .",
    "subsequently , it was used in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) to uncover 340 unique double - peaked agns at @xmath12 @xcite and 131 double - peaked quasars at @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "these double - peaked agns have been a reservoir for follow - up studies aimed at distinguishing line profiles produced by dual agns from those produced by narrow - line region kinematics ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "some of these observations have resulted in confirmations of dual agns @xcite , but the majority of double - peaked agns are likely produced by gas kinematics associated with a single agn ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    given the successes of using velocity - offset agn emission lines to select offset and dual agn candidates in deep2 and sdss , it is a natural extension to apply the same approach to other large spectroscopic surveys of galaxies , such as the agn and galaxy evolution survey ( ages ) . a search for offset and dual agn candidates in ages , at a mean redshift of @xmath14 , would fill the gap between the lower redshift sdss ( @xmath15 ) and higher redshift deep2 ( @xmath16 ) samples of dual smbh candidates , enabling dual smbhs to be used for studies of galaxy evolution across the full range of @xmath17 .    here",
    "we present the results of our systematic search for velocity - offset narrow agn emission lines in ages galaxy spectra , which uncovered five offset agn candidates and two dual agn candidates .",
    "these galaxies , at @xmath18 , are promising candidates for follow - up observations that will definitively determine whether they host offset and dual agns .",

    "ages determined spectroscopic redshifts for 18,163 galaxies to a limiting magnitude of @xmath25 .    since we will use the , , , and @xmath26emission lines to diagnose agn activity ( see section  [ agn ] ) , we select the galaxy spectra where all four of these emission lines are within the ages wavelength range .",
    "this cut results in 8136 spectra at @xmath27 , and this sample is the focus of our analysis as described below .",
    "while redshifts for the ages galaxies have already been measured by cross correlation with emission and absorption line galaxy and agn template spectra @xcite , these redshifts may be weighted towards the emission lines and hence not true representations of the stellar absorption redshifts .",

    "we measured the wavelength of each emission line as the mean and standard deviation of the wavelength centroids determined from the 100 realizations of adding noise to each spectrum .",

    "the three surveys do not probe the same spatial scales ( sdss uses @xmath157 fibers , which corresponds to 5.5 kpc at typical redshift @xmath158 ; ages uses @xmath22 fibers , which corresponds to 5.0 kpc at typical redshift @xmath159 ; and deep2 uses slits with 1@xmath160 widths and 7@xmath160 average lengths , which correspond to 7 kpc and 50 kpc , respectively , at typical redshift @xmath161 of the double - peaked and offset sample ; @xcite ) , allowing the possibility that the double peaks in each survey are produced by effects on different spatial scales .",
    "although deep2 can probe scales of 50 kpc , the sources of the double - peaked emission exist on @xmath162 kpc scales .",
    "the two double - peaked agns in deep2 correspond to double emission components with spatial separations of 1.2 kpc and 2.3 kpc @xcite , and long - slit observations of 81 double - peaked agns in sdss showed that the double emission components have a typical separation of 1.1 kpc ( with a range of 0.2 kpc to 5.5 kpc , where the maximum is 15 kpc for a @xmath157 sdss fiber ; @xcite ) . as a result , the different spatial scales explored by sdss , ages , and deep2 should not significantly bias the relative numbers of offset and dual agn candidates found in each .    finally , the deep2 search was limited to red galaxies . if we match the ages agn sample to the color ( @xmath163 ) and absolute magnitude ( @xmath164 ) range of the deep2 sample , we find zero double - peaked system out of 70 agns .",
    "we also find five offset agn candidates , which is @xmath165 of our sample of 173 type 2 agns at @xmath0 . for comparison ,",
    "the fraction is @xmath166 ( 30/91 ) for offset agn candidates in the deep2 sample of type 2 agns in red galaxies at @xmath148 @xcite .",
    "a major source of this discrepancy is that the deep2 spectra have five times the spectral resolution ( @xmath155 ) of the ages spectra ; the deep2 offset agn candidates have velocity offsets down to 37 km s@xmath10 with @xmath111 significance , whereas the ages offset agn candidates have velocity offsets down to 98 km s@xmath10 with @xmath111 significance .",
    "a more accurate comparison is the @xmath167 ( 14/91 ) fraction of deep2 type 2 agns that have velocity offsets @xmath168 km s@xmath10 to the @xmath169 ( 2/70 ) fraction of offset agn candidates in an ages agn sample that is matched in color and absolute magnitude ( as described in the previous paragraph ) to the deep2 sample .",
    "when the ages and deep2 samples are matched in color , absolute magnitude , and minimum velocity offset , there is clear evidence for redshift evolution in the fractions of offset and dual agn candidates . for the subsamples matched in this way",
    ", the fraction of offset ( dual ) agn candidates increases with redshift , from @xmath170 ( @xmath171 ) in ages at @xmath0 and mean redshift @xmath14 , to @xmath172 ( @xmath173 ) in deep2 at @xmath174 and mean redshift @xmath16 . when the offset and dual agn candidates are combined , the overall fractions increase by a factor of @xmath3 from @xmath4 ( 2/70 ) in ages to @xmath5 ( 16/91 ) in deep2 .",
    "this trend is similar to the increase in galaxy merger fraction ( e.g. , @xcite ) with increasing redshift over this redshift range , as expected if these candidates are indeed offset and dual agns .",
    "if the five ages candidates are offset agns , then we expect there to be equal numbers of redshifted and blueshifted agns , as was the case for the offset agn candidates in deep2 @xcite . in ages ,",
    "@xmath175 ( 1/5 ) of the candidates exhibit redshifted velocity offsets and @xmath176 ( 4/5 ) of the candidates exhibit blueshifted velocity offsets .",
    "given the small sample size , this could be roughly consistent with an even distribution , or it could be an indication of agn outflows biasing the sample .",
    "agn outflows are known to produce an overabundance of observed blueshifted emission lines , since redshifted lines are often obscured by the agn torus ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we have searched 8136 ages galaxy spectra at @xmath0 for spectroscopic signatures of dual smbhs .",
    "dual smbhs that are accreting gas as dual agns can produce double - peaked agn emission lines , while an offset agn , which is a dual - smbh system where only one smbh is active , can produce agn emission lines with bulk line - of - sight velocity offsets relative to the host galaxy stellar absorption features . out of 173 type 2 agn spectra at @xmath0 , we find two double - peaked agns and five offset agn candidates .",
    "the two double - peaked agns have line - of - sight velocity separations between their double peaks of 246 km s@xmath10 and 358 km s@xmath10 , while the five offset agn candidates have velocity offsets of @xmath113 km s@xmath10 @xmath114 km s@xmath10 .",
    "we find that @xmath146 of the ages agns are double - peaked agns and @xmath165 are offset agn candidates . when the ages and deep2 samples are matched in color , absolute magnitude , and minimum velocity offset , the dual supermassive black hole candidate fraction increases by a factor of @xmath3 ( from 2/70 to 16/91 , or @xmath4 to @xmath5 ) from the ages sample at a mean redshift of @xmath14 to the deep2 sample at @xmath16 .",
    "this trend could be understood if velocity - offset narrow agn emission lines are associated with galaxy mergers , since the galaxy merger fraction also increases with redshift over this range .    in an additional sign of a link between velocity offsets and galaxy mergers ,",
    "we find tentative evidence that the offset and dual agn candidates are @xmath6 times more likely ( 2/7 , or @xmath8 ) to be hosted by galaxies with a companion within @xmath123 than the parent ages agn population ( 16/173 , or @xmath7 ) .",
    "since our sample consists of only seven offset and dual agn candidates , a larger sample is needed to confirm this result .",
    "further , we find that two of the offset agn candidates have companions , and one of the companions may host an offset agn itself that has a similar velocity offset to the primary galaxy s agn",
    ". both sets of primary and companion galaxies also have morphological signs of disturbance , suggesting that they have already interacted . in the dual smbh scenario ,",
    "such an interaction could perturb the central agn to a different velocity than systemic .    while the seven objects we find are compelling candidates for offset and dual agns , their line profiles could also be produced by kinematics in the narrow - line region such as outflows and rotating disks ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "follow - up studies of the sdss double - peaked agns have showcased the utility of long - slit spectroscopy @xcite , integral - field unit spectroscopy @xcite , near - infrared imaging @xcite , radio observations @xcite , and x - ray observations @xcite in distinguishing narrow - line region kinematics from bona fide dual agns . while radio and x - ray observations are particularly promising avenues for confirmations of dual agns , the _ chandra _ observations to date have underscored the difficulties in identifying dual agns when the agns are closely separated and faint or have high x - ray obscurations @xcite .",
    "building on the strategies honed for sdss double - peaked agns , careful follow - up observations of the ages offset and dual agn candidates presented here would pinpoint which systems are dual smbhs , which would help clarify our understanding of spectroscopic signatures of dual smbhs and advance these systems as new probes of galaxy evolution .",
