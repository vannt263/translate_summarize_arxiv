    "@xmath14 has to be modified by considering the coupling of the first and last oscillator to hard walls i.e. @xmath22 .",
    "next , we want to study the non - equilibrium steady state ( ness ) of this network driven by a pair of langevin reservoirs set at temperatures @xmath23 and @xmath24 ( we assume @xmath25 ) , and coupled to the first @xmath26 and last @xmath27 masses with a constant coupling strength @xmath28 . the corresponding equations of motion that describe also the coupling to the bath are @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is delta - correlated white noise @xmath31 .",

    "intuitively expected , @xmath42 is larger for modes that have larger amplitudes at the boundaries and couple thus more strongly with the reservoirs .",

    "both in ( a ) and ( b ) we have used eq .",
    "( [ current1 ] ) in order to evaluate the heat current @xmath1 .",
    "we separate out the random component of the spring constants and re - write them as @xmath50 where now @xmath51 $ ] .",
    "the force matrix @xmath14 can be decomposed into a constant matrix @xmath52 and a random part @xmath53 as @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the @xmath56 unit matrix , @xmath57 is a matrix whose all elements are equal to unity i.e. @xmath58 , @xmath59 is a diagonal matrix with @xmath60 , and @xmath61 is a random matrix defined below .",
    "the above decomposition allow us to distinguish the various contributions .",
    "the matrix @xmath61 can be treated as a `` standard '' rmt ensemble ( note though that it has zero diagonal elements ) .",
    "it is convenient to rewrite it as @xmath62 where @xmath63 is a rm with elements having unit variance where @xmath64 .",

    "now consider adding to @xmath52 the random matrix @xmath61 , i.e. we neglect for the moment @xmath59 and consider @xmath72 already for an arbitrary small @xmath48 , the @xmath69 degeneracy will be removed and the corresponding eigenvectors will be those of a @xmath73 random matrix . the @xmath74-time degenerate level is broadened into a band of width @xmath75 .",
    "the perturbation theory applies for @xmath76 i.e. for @xmath77 .",
    "however even for larger @xmath48 the rmt still applies because then we can simply neglect the matrix @xmath52 in eq .",
    "( [ phi_prime ] ) . in short , for small @xmath48 we have an rmt for @xmath74-rank matrices ( the contribution to current of the level with @xmath78 can be neglected , in comparison to the @xmath74-levels ) , whereas for large @xmath48 we have an rmt for @xmath0-rank matrices .",
    "thus , in the large @xmath0 limit we treat eq .",

    "( [ current2 ] ) are statistically independent we get @xmath85 comparison of these theoretical predictions with a direct numerical evaluation of the mean and the variance of heat current @xmath1 via eq .",
    "( [ current1 ] ) ( see fig . [",
    "fig1]b ) leads us to conclude that standard rmt considerations describe well the scaling of the _ average _ current but _ not the variance_. to obtain the correct description of the variance , it is necessary to treat the full force matrix , as given in eq .",
    "( [ phi ] ) .",
    "below we show that the matrix @xmath49 induces strong correlations between different @xmath84 s , thus , invalidating the assumption which led to eq .",
    "( [ current_rmt ] ) for the variance @xcite .",
    "we now consider the ensemble of matrices given by eq .",
    "( [ phi ] ) . again for large @xmath0 , the matrix @xmath52 has no effect , so it is enough to understand the eigenvectors of the random matrix @xmath53 .",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath59 are of order @xmath86 , so that they occupy a band of order @xmath87 and are separated by a typical energy interval @xmath88 .",
    "the same is true for the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath61 . in this sense @xmath59 and @xmath61",
    "are  of the same strength \" and neither can be treated as perturbation to the other .",
    "however , the qualitative understanding of the eigenvectors of the combined matrix @xmath53 is along the following lines : the eigenvectors of @xmath59 are localized on the individual sites i.e. the @xmath89th eigenvector is @xmath90 .",
    "the matrix @xmath61 mixes these eigenvectors , so that eigenvectors of @xmath53 are spread over all sites and resembles those of a standard rmt .",
    "therefore @xmath5 is qualitatively not different from the standard rmt result of eq .",
    "( [ current_rmt ] ) .",
    "the only difference is that the coefficient @xmath91 now assumes the numerical value @xmath92 ( see fig .",

    "( [ current_rmt ] ) .",
    "it turns out that in this case each eigenvector of @xmath53 `` remembers '' the set @xmath94 of the eigenvalues of @xmath59 so that correlations between different eigenvectors of @xmath53 are significantly stronger than those for the standard rmt .",
    "namely the mode - mode correlations between the different @xmath84 s of the matrix @xmath53 are described by @xcite @xmath95 where @xmath96 is a constant .",
    "( [ correlations ] ) we calculate the variance @xmath97 of the random variable @xmath98 ( see eq .",
    "( [ current2 ] ) ) : @xmath99 expressing @xmath93 in terms of @xmath98 via eq .",
    "( [ current2 ] ) we get @xmath100 direct numerical evaluation of the variance @xmath93 based on eq .",
    "( [ current1 ] ) confirms the above theoretical estimates . in fig .",
    "[ fig1]b we show some of our numerical results for rescaled variance @xmath101 .",
    "the data clearly indicate that @xmath93 is scale invariant for any disorder strength @xmath48 .",
    "further @xmath102 numerical analysis allow us to extract the asymptotic value @xmath103 .",
    "we have also checked that correlations between the matrices @xmath59 and @xmath61 do not play a role in our arguments .",
    "detail numerical analysis indicates that if instead of the actual @xmath59 ( i.e. @xmath104 ) we consider a diagonal random matrix completely independent of @xmath61 so that @xmath105 $ ] , we still obtain the same behavior for @xmath5 and @xmath93 ( dashed lines in fig . [ fig1]b ) .",
    "we remark that this kind of ensembles , with strongly fluctuating diagonal elements , ( @xmath49-rmt ensembles ) have previously appeared in the context of mescoscopic physics @xcite .",
    "finally we investigate the effect of b.c . on the statistics of heat flux .",
    "we consider the other limiting case of fixed b.c .",
    "we assume that the first and the last oscillator are coupled to the left and right walls with spring constants @xmath106 and @xmath107 respectively which are taken from the same ensemble of random springs as the ones in the bulk of the network .",
    "the random components are then included in the matrix elements @xmath108 and @xmath109 , respectively .",
    "the constant matrix @xmath52 also changes to @xmath110 where @xmath111 .",
    "this results in a slight shift of the zero mode @xmath67 of the matrix @xmath52 together with a  deformation \" of the @xmath112 eigenvector .",
    "contribution of this level to the total current is of order @xmath102 , and it is disregarded below .     versus disorder strength for various system sizes @xmath0 .",
    "in the main panel we scale the @xmath113-axis as @xmath114 while in the inset ( rmt domain ) we scale it as @xmath115 .",
    "( b ) the same as in subfigure ( a ) but now for the rescaled variance @xmath116 .",
    "the various symbols correspond to different system sizes @xmath0 as indicated in fig .",
    "the dashed lines are the predictions of d - rmt ( see also fig.[fig1]b ) while the solid lines represent the theoretical predictions of eq .",
    "( [ av2],[var2 ] ) . ]    in addition two new levels emerge from the @xmath69 degenerate subspace of the matrix @xmath52 .",
    "the first one has the highest energy @xmath117 with a corresponding eigenmode @xmath118 .",
    "this is an exact eigenvalue and eigenvector of @xmath119 .",
    "the second level is slightly lower than @xmath120 ( approximately by @xmath121 ) and its eigenvector is symmetric i.e. @xmath122 with @xmath123 .",
    "below we refer to these states as  surface \" modes .",
    "it turns out that for a network described by the constant force matrix @xmath119 , most of the current is carried by the two surface modes . using eq .",
    "( [ current1 ] ) we find that @xmath124 . at the same time , the remaining @xmath125 degenerate modes _ does not contribute _ to the current ( in the large @xmath126limit ) .",
    "since any of these eigenvectors @xmath127 has to be orthogonal to both @xmath128 and @xmath129 we get that @xmath130 and @xmath131 .",
    "these two constrains are satisfied simultaneously only if @xmath132 for any @xmath133 .",
    "thus the total heat current is @xmath134 the above result will still hold as long as the random matrix @xmath53 does not destroy the pair of states @xmath128 and @xmath129 . as @xmath48 increases we observe a coupling of the two states towards a linear combination i.e. @xmath135 $ ] .",
    "the origin of this re - organization is traced to the matrix @xmath59 which in the @xmath136 subspace , would produce a pair of eigenvalues separated by a distance of order @xmath87 .",
    "this has to be compared to the separation of order @xmath102 between the surface mode eigenvalues @xmath137 and @xmath138 of the matrix @xmath119 .",
    "when @xmath48 reaches a value @xmath139 the two `` surface '' eigenstates are destroyed giving rise to a set of new modes that have components @xmath140 and @xmath141 i.e. they are localized asymmetrically at the reservoir sites .",
    "consequently , the average current will drop to approximately a zero value . as the disorder continues to increase ,",
    "the matrix @xmath61 lifts the degeneracy of the @xmath125 levels centered around @xmath142 and creates a spectral band of size @xmath143 . for some critical value of @xmath144",
    "the bandwidth @xmath145 becomes as broad as the gap that separates the degenerate states from the surface states .",
    "the latter now merge with the continuum of states in the band , and the rmt results are recovered .    for disorder strength such that the dominant contribution comes only from the two surface states , a quantitative description of the heat transport can be achieved by considering a simple two level system .",
