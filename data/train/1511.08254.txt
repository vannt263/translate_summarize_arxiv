    "the degree of non - locality of such superpositions is generally different at different energy levels .",
    "this non - local network of states can be engaged by transferring quantum amplitudes from qubit states to higher energy states temporarily .",
    "as we will demonstrate , one of the most effective ways to accomplish this is to design continuous - time quantum walks @xcite through these networks of states . in what follows ,",
    "we first introduce terminology .",
    "we , then , show how multiqubit gates can be performed via pulse sequences addressing always interacting auxiliary states .",
    "this approach , when optimized , can provide some gate compression but is limited because the structure of nonlocal states involving multiple qubits is not used .",
    "the pulse - sequence approach is used further as a benchmark to suggest increased efficiency of the proposed quantum - walk - based scheme .",
    "in order to illustrate the concept we will focus on one of the simplest systems necessary : a collection of four - state quantum systems coupled to a single cavity mode of frequency @xmath3 [ see fig .",

    "such configuration can be realized in a number of currently most advanced qubit architectures @xcite .",
    "generalization to larger number of states and other types of interaction is possible .",
    "we set each individual four - state qubit system ( qs ) to encode a qubit via the two lowest energy states @xmath4 , and use two additional states , @xmath5 , as auxiliary states .",

    "this means that each qs is isolated and is not affected by the state of the rest of the system  only single - qubit manipulations are possible .",
    "when , on the other hand , the cavity mode is _ in resonance _ with at least one of the transitions in each qs and the corresponding matrix elements are non - negligible , the degeneracy can be lifted  a change in the state of one of the qubits can affect the entire system .",
    "as the result , entanglement can be modified , but single- ( or few- ) qubit operations are difficult to perform .",
    "we will label the superposition states @xmath18 at @xmath25 the same way as the states from which they originate when @xmath26 is adiabatically increased from zero .    for the purpose of this investigation we will focus on the simplest case , when the cavity has non - negligible and identical matrix elements for transitions between states in each individual qs .",
    "this assumption simplifies the discussion because in this case it suffices to only discuss frequency resonance conditions and detunings that are independent of the details of qubit - cavity interactions in each individual physical system . on the other hand , this imposes the limit on how many qubits can be coupled this way until spectral crowding introduces unacceptable levels of cross - talk noise .",
    "this limit can be partially or completely lifted by using multiple cavities , each coupled to only few qss , as will be briefly discussed at the end of this paper .    in the systems described by hamiltonian of type ( [ eq : h ] ) and with the assumptions stated above , a combination of both resonance and off - resonance limits  an _ intermediate resonance regime _",

    "the cavity mode is somewhat away from resonance with every qubit system , and the decrease of qubit - cavity interactions ( degree of non - locality ) is different for different types of qubit - cavity states .",

    "we can also quantify the detuning of qubit transitions that belong to different qubits from each other by @xmath33 , i.e. , @xmath34 for @xmath35 and specific choice of @xmath36 .",

    "the irr is achieved at some finite values of @xmath33 ( and an appropriate choice of @xmath3 @xcite ) when @xmath38 while the irr , as obtained in ref .  ,",
    "is specific to qs coupled via cavity modes , a similar structure with condition ( [ eq : irr ] ) can be present when interactions between qss occur via other mechanisms .",
    "in this section we give a brief overview of a standard @xmath1-system approach to two - qubit quantum gates to introduce concepts used in the other sections . this approach ( and its variations )",
    "is used in different qubit architectures , e.g. , in ion traps @xcite or in quantum dots @xcite , to manipulate entanglement .",
    "the key ingredient is a non - local auxiliary state that has non - zero matrix element for transitions involving at least one of the basis states in the two - qubit system , e.g. , @xmath39 , as in fig .",
    "[ fig : mqb - scheme1](a ) .",
    "the state is non - local if it is formed as the result of interaction between qubits , either direct or mediated via a cavity field .",

    "we begin with the simplest multiqubit entangling gate  a three - qubit toffoli gate @xcite .",
    "the toffoli gate can be decomposed into @xmath50 or represented by six cnot gates @xcite . here",
    "@xmath51 is a hadamard operation @xcite applied to @xmath23-th qubit , and @xmath52 is a control - not operation . the control - z gate with one ( two ) control qubits and one target qubit is denoted by cz ( ccz ) .",
    "note that control - z operations with arbitrary number of control qubits , [ c]@xmath53z , are diagonal identity matrices with , e.g. , one diagonal entry set to @xmath54 .",

    "the population left on the excited auxiliary states by the first pulse can not be transfered to higher energy states by the second pulse , because @xmath32 is not negligible due to condition ( [ eq : irr ] ) .",

    "implicit integration techniques can partially mitigate this problem , however development of appropriate probability - conserving numerical approaches are needed to correctly account for large number of accessible transitions without artificial cutoffs . in order to guarantee acceptable levels of numerical error , we chose anharmonicity that is about three times larger than what is expected for a transmon @xcite .",

    "in realistic systems of transmons one can have @xmath140 , @xmath141 , and can set the scaling factor to about @xmath142 .",
    "this produces the limit of @xmath143 .",
    "in addition , the effective interaction must be kept larger than all decoherence rates @xmath144.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this limits usable coupling strength between qss at the opposite ends of the spectrum as @xmath145 $ ] .",
    "the above limitation on @xmath139 stems from the fact that we have considered a simplified model to introduce a new approach for entanglement - manipulating gates based on quantum walks .",
    "specifically , the operation of the gate was demonstrated analytically based on spectral selectivity that relies on frequency detuning . in actual physical systems selectivity of pulses",
    "is determined not only by detuning , but also by the magnitude of the transition matrix elements present for the given pulse field distribution and the wave functions involved in the transition of interest .",
    "in other words , if the pulse field does not overlap with the states involved in the given transition it does not affect that transition even if it is in or near resonance with the pulse frequency .",
    "this makes transitions corresponding to different edges of the graph , e.g. , in fig .",
    "[ fig : graphs](a ) , individually addressable even when the corresponding transition frequencies are near resonance with each other .",
    "furthermore , in many architectures scalable qubit registers would involve multiple cavities carrying interaction between different parts of the system , rather then a single quantum resonator coupled to every qs .",
    "this introduces larger number of addressable auxiliary states , hence generating larger graphs with addressable edges . as the result",
    ", restrictions ( [ eq : multi : cond ] ) and ( [ eq : multi : geff ] ) no longer apply to the entire qubit register , although , they can still be important locally .",
    "this situation is ideal for the proposed approach of using continuous time quantum walks to manipulate entanglement in multiqubit systems .",
    "investigation of quantum walk properties in this context , particularly `` return '' quantum walks discussed here , is an interesting direction of further research , which , however , goes beyond the scope of the present paper . finally , we note that the evolution through networks of auxiliary states is also affected by decoherence .",
    "this can potentially limit sizes of the graphs involved in entangling gates . at the same time , small decoherence can , in some cases , enhance quantum propagation through networks @xcite .",
