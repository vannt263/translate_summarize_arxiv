    "monte carlo ( mc ) methods have become more powerful tools with the development of faster and more accessible computers .",

    "the melting behavior of the hard - disk system @xcite is one of such subjects which has been studied with monte carlo methods @xcite .",
    "consider the hard - disk system with @xmath0 particles .",
    "the monte carlo method for the hard - disk system has the following steps .",
    "first , choose one particle randomly , _",
    "i.e. _ choose it with a probability of @xmath1 . then choose a new position for the center of the chosen particle , the new position is chosen uniformly in the circle with radius @xmath2 centered on the original position of the particle .",
    "the trial move is accepted when the new position has no overlap with other particles , otherwise , the trial move is rejected .",
    "the mc methods introduced above have been used to obtain the equilibrium state of the system . to study the equilibrium state of the system , the value of @xmath2 , the trial step length ,",
    "is often chosen in order that the rejection rate is near 50% .",
    "recently , watanabe _",
    "et al_. @xcite studied the hard - disk system by observing nonequilibrium behavior using a molecular dynamics ( md ) method . in order to compare the results of md and mc",
    ", we have to consider the dynamics of the mc method .",
    "the dynamics of the mc method for the hard - disk system can be understood as a brownian motion , like pollen particles in a fluid .",
    "the value of @xmath2 corresponds to the amplitude of the external random force .",
    "therefore , it determines a time scale of this system .",
    "if values of @xmath2 are not identical for all densities , we can not compare the dynamics , like relaxation phenomena and fluctuations , between different densities .",
    "however , keeping @xmath2 fixed leads to high rejection rates in the monte carlo at high densities .",
    "a similar problem occurs for spin systems both at low temperatures and in a strong external field : a rejection rate becomes very high , so a huge number of trials is required to make a change .",
    "this problem can be avoided using a different technique called the rejection - free monte carlo ( rfmc ) method .",
    "the rfmc method was first constructed for discrete spin systems @xcite , for a review see @xcite .",
    "miyashita and takano @xcite applied the rfmc method to the kinetic ising model in order to study dynamical critical behavior .",

    "a monte carlo method is an implementation of a markov process on a computer , and hence is sometimes called a markov chain monte carlo .",
    "the monte carlo method calculates various physical quantities by updating states of a system using random variables .",
    "these updating processes can be illustrated by a markov chain ( see the schematic in fig .  [ fig_markov ] ) .",
    "let the current state be at @xmath3 and the states possible to move from @xmath3 are denoted by @xmath4 .",
    "define @xmath5 as the energy of the state @xmath6 .",
    "the new state @xmath7 will be chosen with probability @xmath8 .",
    "one way to ensure that the system will relax to the equilibrium state is to insist that the probability @xmath8 satisfy the detailed balance condition @xcite .",
    "one of the well - known ways @xcite to satisfy the detailed balance condition is to use a heat - bath transition probability . in the heat - bath method ,",
    "the probability @xmath8 is defined to be @xmath9 . when a system has a continuous degree of freedom , the summation of eq .",
    "( [ eq_heatbath ] ) becomes an integration which is generally difficult to calculate analytically .",
    "another popular way to satisfy the detailed balance condition is a metropolis method . in this method , each step contains two parts ; selecting a new state and accepting or rejecting the trial to move to the selected state .",
    "first , pick up a state @xmath6 from all possible states to move to with uniform probability @xmath10 .",
    "the probability @xmath8 to move from @xmath3 to @xmath6 is defined to be @xmath11 when @xmath12 , otherwise it is @xmath13 with the energy difference @xmath14 .",
    "therefore , the probability @xmath8 in the metropolis method is @xmath15 when a trial is rejected , the configuration of the system is not updated . the probability @xmath16 to stay in the current state after the trial is given by the expression @xmath17 for some parameters , _",
    "e.g. _ under a strong external field and at an extremely low temperature , the value of @xmath18 can be very nearly @xmath11 .",
    "in such cases , most of computational time is spent on calculating trials which will be rejected .",
    "this rejection rate drastically decreases the efficiency of the computation .    in order to overcome this problem ,",
    "a rejection - free monte carlo ( rfmc ) method is proposed .",
    "it is an example of an event driven algorithm  @xcite and has also been called a waiting time method @xcite .",
    "each steps of the rfmc method involves first computing the time to leave the current state ( the waiting time @xmath19 ) , and then choosing a new state to move to with the appropriate probability .",
    "it does not contain the judgment to accept or reject a trial , and , therefore , it achieves rejectionless updates of the system in each algorithmic step .",
    "the waiting time @xmath19 is calculated using a ( pseudo ) random variable .",
    "the probability @xmath20 to keep staying at the current state for @xmath21 steps decays exponentially , @xmath22 with @xmath18 defined in eq .",
    "( [ deflambda ] ) .",
    "note that @xmath23 since @xmath24 .",
    "inversely , the time @xmath21 to stay in the current state is determined with a uniform random number @xmath25 on @xmath26 to be @xmath27 where @xmath28 denotes the integer part of @xmath29 and the rounding down is introduced to express the discrete time step in mc @xcite .",
    "after the time of the system is advanced by @xmath19 , a new state @xmath6 is chosen from the all states possible to move to except for the current state with the probability proportional to @xmath8 @xcite . since all values of @xmath8 are required to proceed one algorithm step in the rfmc , the computational cost of one step is higher than the normal mc .",
    "however , the waiting time @xmath19 , the time which can be advanced in one algorithmic step , becomes large at low temperatures , and consequently the efficiency of the rfmc can become better than that of standard mc .",
    "consider a hard disk system with @xmath0 particles with the radius @xmath30 . a standard mc method for the system involves choosing a particle , and trying to move the chosen particle within a circle with radius @xmath2 centered on the original position of the chosen particle .",
    "to apply a rfmc method to the hard - disk system , define @xmath31 as the probability that a trial to move particle @xmath32 is rejected ( given that particle @xmath32 was chosen as the particle to attempt a move ) . using the definition of @xmath31",

    "4 .   choose the new position of the chosen particle @xmath32 uniformly from all the points to which the particle @xmath32 is allowed to move .",
    "the steps described above are the same as the rfmc for continuous spin systems @xcite , but the algorithms to calculate @xmath31 and to determine a new position of the chosen particle are unique to the hard - disk system .",
    "the probability @xmath31 can be calculated to be , @xmath35 with an area @xmath36 into which the particle @xmath32 is allow to move ( see fig .",
