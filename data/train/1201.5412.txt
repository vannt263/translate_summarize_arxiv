    "to date , nasa s _ kepler _  mission has announced the discovery of nearly a thousand candidate exoplanet systems including a significant number of systems with multiple transiting objects @xcite .",
    "such a large sample of exoplanet candidates can provide valuable insight into the nature of the general population of planets and planetary systems , even if there were a sizeable fraction that are false - positive signals .",
    "nevertheless , a sample of systems that are known with high confidence to be planetary enables a significant amount of additional science both for individual objects and for the planet population generally .",
    "moreover , it yields more efficient use of resources in these endeavors by indicating those systems where supplementary observations will likely be most fruitful .",
    "historically , planetary systems have been confirmed primarily by making dynamical measurements of the planet mass and orbital properties via radial velocity ( rv ) measurements .",
    "more recently @xcite , this mass measurement has been accomplished by detailed modeling of transit timing variations , or ttvs  the deviations from a constant period that result from gravitational perturbations among multiple planets and their host star @xcite .",
    "another contemporary development is the validation of planets by the process of elimination  excluding false positive signals by scrutinizing a wide variety of data on individual systems ( e.g. , ` blender ` @xcite ) .",
    "yet detailed dynamical modeling of systems , the gathering of rv and other complementary data , and the synthesis of this information is time consuming for individual systems and is prohibitive for the entirety of the list of _ kepler _  objects of interest ( kois ) .",
    "the development of simpler , and more rapid , validation techniques is crucial for the timely advancement of the exoplanetary science enabled by _",
    "kepler_.    in this work , we present a method to confirm the planetary nature of candidates in multiple transiting systems .",
    "complementary methods with the same goal are simultaneously being developed by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "these methods are specifically intended to confirm planetary systems using a small number of assumptions and easily implemented analysis .",
    "the method presented here broadly uses conservation of energy and dynamical stability to show that alternative ( non - planetary ) explanations of the observed photometric data are excluded with high confidence and that the objects must be both dynamically interacting and planetary in mass .",
    "specifically , the properties of the ttv signature for the multiple candidates and the maximum allowed masses for objects in the systems demonstrate that exoplanet candidates in several _ kepler _  systems are indeed planets . generally speaking , it is difficult to construct astrophysical false positives that can mimic a multi - transiting system @xcite .",
    "yet , the analysis presented herein does not invoke this enhancement in planet likelihood , and we confirm the discovery of 8 total planets in the systems kepler25  ( koi 244 , kic 4349452 ) , kepler26  ( koi 250 , kic 9757613 ) , kepler27  ( koi 841 , kic 5792202 ) , and kepler28  ( koi 870 , kic 6949607 ) .",
    "this paper will proceed as follows .",
    "first , we discuss the essential components of the photometric data reduction and the stellar properties (  [ photometry ] ) . the analysis method is discussed in  [ method ] .",
    "the results of the analysis for the various systems is found in  [ results ] .",
    "we discuss the implications of these results in  [ discussion ] .",
    "finally , additional obervational information and photometric diagnostics for some of the systems are given in  [ extradata ] .",
    "the kepler mission was designed to detect terrestrial - size planets in the habitable zone of the host star , necessitating both a large sample size and sensitivity to a much larger range of orbital distances than ground - based surveys @xcite .",
    "the instrument is a differential photometer with a wide ( @xmath0 square degrees ) field - of - view ( fov ) that continuously and simultaneously monitors the brightness of approximately 150,000 main - sequence stars .",
    "a discussion of the characteristics and on - orbit performance of the instrument and spacecraft is presented in @xcite .",
    "each of the systems considered here was found using the transiting planet search pipeline ( tps ) which identifies significant transit - like features , or threshold crossing events ( tce ) , in the kepler light curves @xcite .",
    "data showing tces are then passed to the data validation ( dv ) pipeline @xcite .",
    "the dv pipeline fits a transiting planet model to the data , removes it from the light curve , and returns the result to tps in an effort to find additional transit features .",
    "dv also completes a suite of statistical tests that are applied to the data after all tces are identified in an effort to assess the likelihood of false - positives .",
    "the results of these diagnostic tests are consistent with the planet interpretation and do not warn of potential pitfalls .",
    "after pipeline data processing and the photometry extraction , the time series is detrended as described in @xcite in order to measure important stellar and planet candidate parameters . a first estimate for the stellar mass and radius ( @xmath1 and @xmath2 )",
    "is obtained by comparing the stellar @xmath3 and @xmath4 values derived from an analysis of the stellar spectrum or from the kepler input catalog ( kic , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to a set of cesam ( code devolution stellaire adaptatif et modulaire , @xcite ) stellar evolution models computed in steps of @xmath5 for solar composition .    with @xmath1 and",
    "@xmath2 fixed to their initial values , a transit fit is then computed to determine the orbital inclination , planetary radius , and depth of the occultation ( passing behind the star ) assuming a circular orbit .",
    "the transit lightcurve is modeled using the analytic expressions of @xcite using non - linear limb darkening parameters derived for the kepler bandpass @xcite .",
    "the best fit model is found using a levenberg - marquardt minimization algorithm @xcite .",
    "the best fit transit model is then removed from the lightcurve and the residuals are used to fit for the characteristics of next transiting candidate identified by tps .",
    "the transit times obtained from these model fits are used in our analysis below and a brief excerpt is given in table [ tabtts ] . since these systems show visible ttvs we display their light curves in figures  [ lc244 ] , [ lc250 ] , [ lc841 ] , and [ lc870 ] , where data are prepared ( with ttvs corrected ) as described in @xcite .",

    "+   +                a centroid measurement , which gives the displacement of the flux centroid during transit compared with the flux centroid in data taken out of transit , is calculated for each candidate planet .",
    "the proper interpretation of the value derived for the centroid motion requires knowledge of the positions and brightnesses of the stars near the target .",
    "motion can result in two different ways ; a nearby star with the transit signature or a nearby star ( or stars ) that dilute the light from the target star , which has the transit signal . an analysis of the centroid motion can give important information in identifying the host of the transiting object and can help disentangle complicated , projected systems blended within the target aperture .",
    "one target star kepler25  is very bright ( kp = 10.7 ) and saturates the central pixels of its image on the photometer .",
    "thus , the centroid information can only identify displacements of the size of a pixel and is of limited use .",
    "the centroid of a second target , kepler27 , does displace significantly from the nominal location during transit .",
    "the dimness of kepler27  ( kp = 15.9 ) presents a challenge to the centroid analysis .",
    "a higher - resolution image of the target taken in the j band with the united kingdom infrared telescope ( ukirt ) shows a faint , neighboring star ( kp = 19.5 ) that is 2 arcseconds to the northeast of the target and that is not identified in the kic ( see figure [ ukirt841 ] ) .",
    "the centroid motion induced by this faint star is consistent with the interpretation that the faint star has constant brightness and the transit event arises from the target .",
    "the centroid analysis of the remainder of the eight planets shows no displacement beyond the 3@xmath9 radius of confusion for each target and therefore do not raise concern . when modeling the planet and stellar properties for each of these systems , additional light from neighboring stars has been accounted for .",
    "the _ kepler _  follow - up observing program ( fop ) has obtained spectra of the host stars for three of the four systems ( kepler25 , kepler26 , and kepler27 ) .",
    "the spectra were inspected for a prominent second set of spectral lines which would indicate the presence of an additional star .",
    "for host stars with modest snr follow - up spectroscopy ( roughly 20 per resolution element from the 1.5 m tillinghast reflector at flwo ) , we fit spectra to a library of theoretical spectra using the tools of @xcite . for host stars with high - snr follow - up spectroscopy from keck ,",
    "we also report stellar parameters derived from a spectroscopy made easy ( sme ) analysis @xcite with mass and radius estimates generated from yonsei - yale isochrones . in cases without follow - up spectroscopy",
    ", we adopt the stellar parameters from the kic @xcite .",
    "the adopted stellar parameters are given in table [ tabstars ] along with the estimate of contamination from nearby stars derived from the kic ."
