    "the atlas and cms collaborations have recently presented the first indication for a higgs boson with a mass about @xmath13  gev , consistent with the allowed window of higgs masses @xmath14 gev @xcite . in general , these results have generated much excitement in the community , and already there are a number of papers discussing the implications of such a higgs boson @xcite .",
    "many of these studies focus on the possibility that the higgs boson arises from a supersymmetric standard model ( ssm ) .",
    "however there are several ssms which are capable of giving rise to a sm - like higgs boson and it is interesting to survey some leading possibilities .    in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm )",
    "the lightest higgs boson is lighter than about 130 - 135 gev , depending on top squark parameters ( see e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "a 125 gev sm - like higgs boson is consistent with the mssm in the decoupling limit . in the limit of decoupling the light higgs",
    "mass is given by @xmath15 where @xmath16 is dominated by loops of heavy top quarks and top squarks and @xmath4 is the ratio of the vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) of the two higgs doublets introduced in the mssm higgs sector . at large @xmath4 , we require @xmath17  gev which means that a very substantial loop contribution , nearly as large as the tree - level mass , is needed to raise the higgs boson mass to 125 gev . in the next - to - minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , the spectrum of the mssm is extended by one singlet superfield  @xcite ( for reviews see @xcite ) . in the nmssm",
    "the supersymmetric higgs mass parameter @xmath18 is promoted to a gauge - singlet superfield , @xmath19 , with a coupling to the higgs doublets , @xmath20 , that is perturbative up to unified scales . in the pure nmssm values of @xmath21 do not spoil the validity of perturbation theory up to the gut scale only providing @xmath22 , however the presence of additional extra matter allows smaller values of @xmath23 to be achieved @xcite .",
    "the maximum mass of the lightest higgs boson in the nmssm is @xmath24 where here we use @xmath25  gev . for @xmath26 ,",
    "the tree - level contributions to @xmath27 are maximized for moderate values of @xmath4 rather than by large values of @xmath4 as in the mssm .",
    "for example , taking @xmath28 and @xmath29 , these tree - level contributions raise the higgs boson mass to about 112 gev , and @xmath30 is required .",
    "this is to be compared to the mssm requirement @xmath31 .",
    "the difference between these two values ( numerically about 30 gev ) is significant since @xmath32 depends logarithmically on the stop masses as well as receiving an important contribution from stop mixing .",
    "this means for example , that , unlike the mssm , in the case of the nmssm maximal stop mixing is not required to get the higgs heavy enough .    in the exceptional supersymmetric standard model ( e@xmath0ssm ) @xcite ,",
    "the spectrum of the mssm is extended to fill out three complete 27-dimensional representations of the gauge group e@xmath0 which is broken at the unification scale down to the sm gauge group plus one additional gauged @xmath33 symmetry at low energies under which right - handed neutrinos are neutral , allowing them to get large masses .",
    "each @xmath34-plet contains one generation of ordinary matter ; singlet fields , @xmath35 ; up and down type higgs doublets , @xmath36 and @xmath37 ; charged @xmath38 coloured exotics @xmath39 , @xmath40 .",
    "the extra matter ensures anomaly cancellation , however the model also contains two extra su(2 ) doublets , @xmath41 and @xmath42 , which are required for gauge coupling unification @xcite . to evade rapid proton decay either a @xmath43 or @xmath44 symmetry",
    "is introduced and to evade large flavour changing neutral currents an approximate @xmath45 symmetry is introduced which ensures that only the third family of higgs @xmath46 and @xmath47 couple to fermions and get vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) .",
    "similarly only the third family singlet @xmath48 gets a vev , @xmath49 , which is responsible for the effective @xmath18 term and d - fermion mass .",
    "the first and second families of higgs and singlets which do not get vevs are called `` inert '' .",
    "the maximum mass of the lightest sm - like higgs boson in the e@xmath0ssm is @xcite @xmath50 where the extra contribution relative to the nmssm value in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hmassnmssm ] ) is due to the @xmath33 d - term",
    ". the higgs mass can be larger due to two separate reasons , firstly the value of @xmath51 may be larger due to the extra matter , and secondly due to the @xmath33 d - term contribution equal to @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) gev for low ( high ) @xmath4 .",
    "for example for large @xmath4 , where the nmssm term @xmath54 is unimportant , the e@xmath0ssm requires @xmath55  gev as compared to @xmath17  gev in the mssm .    in a previous paper we considered a constrained version of the e@xmath0ssm with universal gaugino mass @xmath56 , soft scalar mass @xmath57 , and soft trilinear mass @xmath58 at the unification scale @xmath59 @xcite .",
    "previous studies of the ce@xmath0ssm have focussed on regions of ce@xmath0ssm parameter space which could have led to a discovery with the first lhc data @xcite via the characteristic lhc signatures of the model @xcite .",
    "these `` early '' benchmark points are by now excluded by lhc searches for susy and @xmath3 bosons .",
    "the main purpose of the present paper is to consider the ce@xmath0ssm in the light of the higgs signal near 125 gev , taking into account the latest lhc constraints on squarks , gluinos and @xmath1 following the 7 tev run .",
    "we find that there are huge unexplored regions of parameter space in the ce@xmath0ssm which are consistent with a sm - like higgs boson with a mass in the allowed window @xmath14 gev .",
    "the ce@xmath0ssm parameter space consistent with correct electroweak symmetry breaking , is represented here by scans in the @xmath2 plane for fixed @xmath3 mass and @xmath4 , with squark , gluino and higgs masses plotted as contours in this plane .",
    "if the higgs mass is determined accurately then this will narrow down the preferred regions of parameter space considerably .",
    "for example , we find that a 125 gev higgs mass only arises for a sufficiently large @xmath3 mass , mostly above current limits , and for particular regions of squark and gluino masses corresponding to multi - tev squark masses , but with lighter gluinos typically within reach of forthcoming lhc 8 tev or 14 tev runs .",
    "successful dark matter relic abundance may be achieved over all the parameter space , assuming a bino - like lsp with a nearby heavier inert higgsino doublet and decoupled inert singlinos , resulting in conventional gluino decay signatures .",
    "a set of typical benchmark points with a higgs near 125 gev is provided which exemplifies these features and demonstrates the huge unexplored range of parameter space in this model with multi - tev @xmath3 and squark masses but with lighter gluinos , winos and binos , as well as possibly light coloured exotic @xmath60 fermions .",
    "the layout of the rest of the paper is as follows . in section [ ce6ssm ]",
    "we review the ce@xmath0ssm . in section [ constraints ]",
    "we discuss existing lhc constraints arising from higgs searches , sparticle searches , exotica searches and @xmath3 searches . in section [ dm ]",
    "we show that successful dark matter relic abundance may be achieved over all the parameter space , assuming a bino - like lsp with a nearby heavier inert higgsino doublet and decoupled inert singlinos , resulting in conventional gluino decay signatures . in section",
    "[ results ] we provide detailed scans of the parameter space the ce@xmath0ssm , presenting the results in the @xmath2 plane for fixed @xmath3 mass and @xmath4 , with squark , gluino and higgs masses plotted as contours in this plane .",
    "we also present new heavy benchmarks for the model and discuss their phenomenology .",
    "section [ conclusions ] concludes the paper .",
    "the e@xmath0ssm is a supersymmetric model based on the @xmath61 gauge group which is a subgroup of @xmath62 .",
    "the extra @xmath33 symmetry is the combination @xmath63 with @xmath64 . in order to ensure anomaly cancellation the particle content of the e@xmath0ssm",
    "is extended to include three complete fundamental @xmath34 representations of @xmath62 .",
    "in addition the low energy particle spectrum of the e@xmath0ssm is supplemented by @xmath65 doublet @xmath41 and anti - doublet @xmath66 states from the extra @xmath67 and @xmath68 to preserve gauge coupling unification .",
    "these components of the @xmath62 fundamental representation originate from @xmath69 of @xmath67 and @xmath70 of @xmath68 by construction .",
    "the analysis performed in @xcite shows that the unification of gauge couplings in the e@xmath0ssm can be achieved for any phenomenologically acceptable value of @xmath71 consistent with the measured low energy central value , unlike in the mssm which , ignoring the effects of high energy threshold corrections , requires significantly higher values of @xmath71 , well above the experimentally measured central value . because supermultiplets @xmath41 and @xmath66 have opposite @xmath72 and @xmath73 charges their contributions to the anomalies are cancelled identically .",
    "thus , in addition to a @xmath3 associated with the @xmath33 symmetry , the e@xmath0ssm involves extra matter beyond the mssm with the quantum numbers of three @xmath74 representations of @xmath75 plus three @xmath75 singlets with @xmath33 charges .",
    "the matter content of the e@xmath0ssm with correctly normalized abelian charges of all matter fields is summarised in table  [ charges ] .",
    "the presence of a @xmath3 boson and exotic quarks predicted by the e@xmath0ssm provides spectacular new physics signals at the lhc which were discussed in @xcite .",
    ".__the @xmath76 and @xmath73 charges of matter fields in the e@xmath0ssm , where @xmath77 and @xmath78 are here defined with the correct @xmath62 normalisation factor required for the rg analysis . _ _ [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     notice that while increasing @xmath79 pushes up the lower limit on @xmath57 ( below this the inert higgs run below their lep limit and rapidly become tachyonic ) , and the upper limit on @xmath56 ( above which no solution satisfying both ewsb and universality conditions can be found ) also increases , low @xmath56 is always possible and is only bounded by the constraints from gauginos ( the update of which we will discuss shortly ) .",
    "therefore squark / gluino searches can always impact part of the parameter space for any value of @xmath79 albeit an increasing small fraction of the total parameter space as we go up in @xmath79 .",
    "note also that in addition to some regions being sparsely populated , the reasons for which are explained above , we also see a significant gap in the plot of allowed solutions for each value of @xmath79 .",
    "interestingly the solutions for @xmath80 ( not shown here ) although covering a substantially smaller region of the parameter space do tend to cover these gap regions .",
    "now we want to understand how the squark / gluino searches and higgs limits constrain the parameter space and where ( or if ) we can fit the tentative higgs signal .    in fig .",
    "[ tb10s5 ] , the squark and gluino contours are shown ( left ) beside the higgs masses ( right ) for @xmath81 tev .",
    "the squark contours are specifically of the left handed squark mass for the first two generations ( it is contours of this squark mass which were plotted on the atlas and cms papers ) . both those and the gluino contours are formed by selecting points from the scans where the mass lies in a suitably narrow range such that the width of the contour gives a resolvable line for the scale of the plot .",
    "cc    for any given gluino mass we find that squark masses must be substantially heavy .",
    "for example if we take the latest limits on the gluino coming from the lhc which apply in the large @xmath57 region , which is about @xmath82 gev as described in section [ sparticle_searches ] , then we find no solutions with squarks below @xmath83 tev , rendering the larger limits found for the cmssm ( see fig .",
    "7a of ref .",
    "@xcite ) in the low @xmath57 region irrelevant .",
    "therefore we conclude that the squark and gluino constraints place a limit on @xmath56 at around @xmath84 tev .",
    "the right plot showing higgs masses gives a very different picture .",
    "the higgs mass varies over the plane ( driven to a substantial degree by the variation of @xmath51 ) in a very non trivial manner .",
    "different values of the higgs mass are plotted where the values quoted in the key are the central values in bin with a @xmath85 gev width .",
    "remarkably the higgs mass varies over the plane within a very narrow set of values that include the mass of the tentative signal .",
    "a substantial region of the parameter space is ruled out by having @xmath27 in the range @xmath86 gev ( red ) and @xmath87 gev ( pink ) .",
    "however , in addition to the @xmath88 gev ( grey ) gap in the lower mass exclusion , there is still a significant region towards the centre of the plot which is allowed and even where the tentative signal can be matched .",
    "this is mainly for higgs masses of 124 gev , as 125 gev only gives a small region and a @xmath89 gev higgs can not be realised for these choices of @xmath79 and @xmath4 .",
    "if we also take into account the new lhc gluino constraints one can see that little of the @xmath90 gev signal is affected while most of the available space for a @xmath91 gev higgs is removed .",
    "however there are still strong constraints on the parameter space coming from the higgs limits alone , and it is clear one must be careful to apply both of these complimentary constraints in order to understand where the viable regions are .    so while @xmath92 tev has a substantial portion of allowed parameter region which can accommodate the tentative higgs signal , a measurement of the higgs mass of 126 gev , could potentially rule this out .",
    "therefore it is important to consider other slices of our four dimensional parameter space .    in fig .",
    "[ tb10s10 ] we increase @xmath79 to @xmath93 tev , but keep @xmath94 and from the left plot we can see that again the squark and gluino search constraints can all be satisfied by a simple cut on @xmath56 at @xmath84 tev , but now there is a substantially greater proportion of the parameter space which is above this limit since the upper limit on @xmath56 is increasing with @xmath79 .",
    "additionally , in the right plot , we also see that all masses of the tentative higgs signal region can be comfortably accommodated and this region fills most of allowed the parameter space that is above the @xmath95 tev limit we have set from squark and gluino searches .    cc    cc    in fig .  [ tb10s20 ]",
    "we see that if we increase the singlet vev further to @xmath96 tev then we are no longer restricted by the lower limits on the higgs mass , with only a few points having a higgs mass of @xmath97 gev , but now there is a substantial region ruled out by the upper limit @xmath98 set by cms .    cc    figs .",
    "[ tb10s50 ] and [ tb10s100 ] demonstrate that even with very heavy @xmath79 values , such that the @xmath1 is well beyond reach of the lhc , not only is there still a small region of parameter space where the gluino is observable , but additionally a higgs mass measurement would yield useful information about the parameter space well above what can actually be constrained from direct searches .",
    "this illustrates the significance of the higgs to providing constraints and measurement of ce@xmath0ssm parameters .",
    "cc    notice also that while in much of the parameter space new physics states are out of reach , reducing the @xmath99 coupling such that the inert higgsinos are observable would not perturb the rg evolution much , so these plots remain a very good approximation .",
    "thus they reveal an interesting potential scenario where only the inert higgsinos and the sm - like higgs are discovered , but an accurate higgs mass measurement would give a great deal of information on the parameter space .    finally we comment on the @xmath4 dependence of these results .",
    "the form of the squark and gluino contours is not substantially modified by changing @xmath4 so we do not reproduce these plots here .",
    "however the allowed region of parameter space is dramatically changed , as are the higgs masses .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ s10tb3 - 30 ] where we plot the allowed region of the parameters space for @xmath100 tev and @xmath101 ( left ) and @xmath102 ( right ) . here",
    "we see that the combination @xmath100 tev and @xmath101 is almost entirely ruled out with only the @xmath88 gev window left . on the other hand for @xmath102",
    "most of the parameter space is compatible with the tentative higgs signal and , in particular , a higgs of @xmath89 gev appears very typical .",
    "however the overall allowed region of the parameter space has significantly shrunk in comparison to the @xmath103 case .",
    "cc      we have chosen five benchmark points that reproduce a higgs mass of around @xmath104gev , in order to demonstrate significant and interesting features that may arise in the ce@xmath0ssm .",
    "these benchmarks are given in table  [ table : benchmarks ] , labelled hbm1 to hbm5 ( for heavy bench - mark ) .",
    "all of these benchmarks evade current experimental constraints , but predict new particle states that may be found at the lhc .",
    "they represent a wide selection of different scales for the scalar vev , with @xmath79 ranging from @xmath105tev up to @xmath106tev .",
    "as discussed in the last section , low @xmath4 has difficulty reproducing a @xmath107 higgs boson , while high @xmath4 suffers from a restricted parameter space due to the requirements of correct ewsb , so for all these benchmarks we adopt a medium value of @xmath108 .",
    "all benchmarks have a reasonably low value for the mass of the lightest neutralino , which is a consequence of choosing reasonably low values of @xmath56 thereby ensuring a small bino mass within reach of the lhc ( in these scenarios , the lightest neutralino is always predominantly a bino ) .",
    "this also means that the gluino stays reasonably light in all these scenarios too ( though still above current lhc exclusion ) .",
    "furthermore , all five benchmarks conform to the condition of eq .",

    "further studies on these benchmarks will be facilitated by the implementation of the e@xmath0ssm into codes like sarah @xcite and calchep @xcite , which are in preparation @xcite and also an extension of tools developed for ref .",
    "@xcite to include all exotic states in the e@xmath0ssm .",
    "in this paper we have studied the parameter space of the constrained exceptional supersymmetric standard model ( ce@xmath0ssm ) consistent with a higgs signal near 125 gev and the lhc searches for squarks , gluinos and @xmath1 .",
    "the ce@xmath0ssm parameter space consistent with correct electroweak symmetry breaking , is represented by scans in the @xmath2 plane for fixed @xmath3 mass and @xmath4 , with squark , gluino and higgs masses plotted as contours in this plane .",
    "although the heaviest higgs masses are achievable for the largest values of @xmath51 , ewsb is achieved in the ce@xmath0ssm for smaller values of @xmath51 .",
    "this is because ewsb requires reasonably large values of @xmath169 which drive @xmath171 negative , and such values of @xmath169 restrict the values of @xmath51 that can be achieved consistent with these couplings remaining perturbative .",
    "this means that in practice , the tree - level contribution to the higgs mass in the ce@xmath0ssm is only slightly larger than in the mssm , so that a 125 gev higgs mass requires a very large loop contribution , similar to the case of the mssm .",
    "for this reason we have focussed on values of @xmath103 , avoiding the very large values of @xmath172 that may raise other phenomenological issues arising from processes such as @xmath173 .",
    "we find that a 125 gev higgs mass only arises for a sufficiently large @xmath3 mass , mainly above current limits . to be precise , the value of @xmath174 tev corresponding to @xmath175 tev only has a very small region of parameter space consistent with a 125 gev higgs boson , although there is a larger region available for a 124 gev or lighter higgs bosons .",
    "as expected , heavier higgs bosons are more easily achieved over large regions of parameter space for larger values of @xmath176 tev . for each of these cases",
    "there are two distinct regions of the @xmath2 plane consistent with a 125 gev higgs boson , where both regions correspond to multi - tev squark masses , but with one of the regions always extending down to relatively light gluinos , winos and binos , where the gluinos are typically within reach of the lhc in the 8 tev or forthcoming 14 tev runs .",
    "successful dark matter relic abundance may be achieved over all the parameter space , assuming a bino - like lsp with a nearby heavier inert higgsino doublet , about 10 gev heavier , and decoupled inert singlinos .",
    "this scenario will therefore result in conventional gluino decay signatures similar to those of the mssm in the region of parameter space with lighter gluinos and very heavy squarks and sleptons .",
    "this is similar to the focus point of the mssm , but with the relic abundance here resulting from the nearby inert higgsinos ( about 10 gev heavier than the bino ) which provide the distinguishing phenomenological prediction of the ce@xmath0ssm in this scenario .",
    "a set of benchmark points with a higgs near 125 gev has been provided which exemplifies the above features and in addition highlights other features of phenomenological interest such as exotic @xmath60 fermions within reach of the lhc .",
    "all these benchmarks also exhibit gluinos , winos and binos and inert higgsinos , within reach of the forthcoming runs of the lhc , providing the exciting possibility of susy discovery even for squarks and sleptons outside the range of the lhc .",
    "these results show that there is still a vast parameter space of the ce@xmath0ssm to be explored , with heavier squarks and sleptons and lighter gauginos remaining a firm prediction of the model .",
