    "coupled systems describing interaction of oscillating or scattering subsystems and the corresponding operators have been widely used in classical and quantum mechanics .",
    "for example , coupled harmonic oscillators have been studied in quantum information theory , quantum optics ( photonic crystals ) , and for describing phonons in a crystal  @xcite .    in a previous paper  @xcite",
    ", we initiated the analysis of such systems as a wigner quantum system ( wqs )  @xcite .",
    "the system studied in  @xcite consists of a string or chain of @xmath0 identical harmonic oscillators , each having the same mass @xmath3 and frequency @xmath4 .",
    "the position and momentum operator for the @xmath5th oscillator ( @xmath6 ) are given by @xmath7 and @xmath8 ; more precisely @xmath7 measures the displacement of the @xmath5th mass point with respect to its equilibrium position .",
    "the oscillators are coupled by some nearest neighbor coupling , represented by terms of the form @xmath9 in the hamiltonian . in  @xcite , we considered such a system with periodic boundary conditions , where the last oscillator is again coupled to the first one ( i.e.  @xmath10 ) .",
    "in other words , the oscillators are on a circle rather than on a line .",
    "the hamiltonian of this system will be denoted by @xmath11 . in the present paper",
    "we will reconsider this system , and at the same time also concentrate on a second type of boundary conditions : fixed wall boundary conditions .",
    "for this second case , the first and last oscillator are coupled to a fixed wall ( i.e.  @xmath12 ) ; the hamiltonian of this second system will be denoted by @xmath13 .    the original contribution of  @xcite consisted of the treatment of the system described by @xmath11 as a wigner quantum system  @xcite .",
    "this quantization procedure is based upon the compatibility of hamilton s equations and the heisenberg equations . in this procedure",
    ", one does not require the canonical commutation relations ( ccrs ) , but instead uses more general relations describing the before mentioned compatibility . as a consequence ,",
    "one obtains different classes of solutions for the system , of which the canonical solution is only one . for a more detailed description of wqss ,",
    "see  @xcite and references therein .",
    "the main feature of this treatment is that the ccrs are replaced by these compatibility conditions ( ccs ) . for the hamiltonian @xmath11 ,",
    "these ccs are triple relations in terms of operators @xmath14 ( @xmath6 ) , involving both commutators and anti - commutators . herein , the operators @xmath14 are certain linear combinations of the position and momentum operators . in  @xcite",
    "we showed that these triple relations have a solution in terms of certain generators of the lie superalgebra @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we considered a class of fock representations  @xcite of @xmath1 and analysed the energy spectrum and the position operator spectrum in these fock representations @xmath15 .",
    "these fock representations are rather restricted , however , and do not illustrate the features of general unitary irreducible representations  @xcite of @xmath1 ( more precisely , of its compact form @xmath16 ) .    in the present paper",
    ", we consider a more general class of @xmath1 representations , the so - called ladder representations @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "these representations are also easy to describe , but more importantly they show interesting properties of the physical quantities ( energy spectrum , position operator spectrum ) of the system , far more general than those of the fock representations @xmath15 .",
    "a second original contribution of this paper is that we show how also the second system ( fixed wall boundary conditions ) described by @xmath13 can be treated as a wigner quantum system .",
    "in fact , we show that at the algebraic level the two hamiltonians give rise to the same triple relations , but with different constants . as a consequence",
    ", the two systems can be treated similarly , both having solutions in terms of the lie superalgebra @xmath1 .",
    "the contents of the paper is as follows . in section  2",
    "we shortly review the treatment of @xmath11 as a wqs  @xcite , and then analyse the hamiltonian @xmath13 of the fixed wall boundary case in a similar way .",
    "as the algebraic triple relations are , up to different constants , the same , we describe the @xmath1 solution in a subsection .",
    "special attention is paid to determining the critical value for the coupling constant @xmath17 , for which a @xmath1 solution exists in the fixed wall boundary case .",
    "we also describe briefly the new class of representations @xmath2 , the ladder representations , and the explicit action of @xmath1 generators on simple basis vectors @xmath18 of @xmath2 . in section  3 we determine the spectrum of the hamiltonians @xmath11 and @xmath13 in the representations @xmath2 . due to the fact that these hamiltonians have a diagonal action in the current model , their spectrum is easy to determine .",
    "we compare the two cases , and discuss some aspects of degeneracy of the energy levels .",
    "the mathematically more difficult problem is that of determining the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the position operators @xmath7 , for these representations @xmath2 , since @xmath7 is a general odd operator of @xmath1 with a nondiagonal action on the standard basis of @xmath2 .",
    "fortunately , we have managed to give a general treatment ( and procedure ) of how to construct such eigenvalue spectrum and eigenvectors for an arbitrary odd element of @xmath1 in an arbitrary unitary representation in  @xcite . using the techniques of  @xcite",
    ", we manage to determine the eigenvalues of @xmath7 for both systems in section  4 , and to construct the eigenvectors of @xmath7 in section  5 .",
    "in fact , the eigenvalues of @xmath7 for the system described by @xmath11 were already given in  @xcite as an example of the new technique , so only those for the second system described by @xmath13 are new .",
    "we also give some plots of the spectrum of the position operators , as a function of the coupling constant  @xmath17 , and make some observations related to these plots .",
    "section  5 is devoted to computing position probability distributions for the two systems under consideration .",
    "since the techniques of  @xcite allow us to give an explicit expansion of the normalized eigenvectors of @xmath7 , for any of its eigenvalues @xmath19 , in terms of the stationary states @xmath18 , we can invert these relations and express the stationary states @xmath18 in terms of the eigenvectors of @xmath7 ( for any particular @xmath5 ) . the square moduli of the coefficients in these expressions have the usual quantum theory interpretation as the probability of finding the @xmath5th oscillator in position @xmath19 when the system is in its stationary state @xmath18 .",
    "we compute these probabilities analytically ( for small @xmath20-values ) , and numerically for some examples .",
    "we also give a number of plots of such probability distribution functions .",
    "these yield the `` spacial properties '' of the oscillators .",
    "the results are quite interesting , and show some analogy of what one would expect of the system from a classical treatment . for the ground state ( stationary state of lowest energy ) , the position with highest probability ( for each oscillator ) is the equilibrium position ( corresponding to @xmath21 ) , with strongly decreasing probability as the ( discrete ) eigenvalue is further away from 0 .",
    "for the most excited state ( stationary state of highest energy ) , the position with highest probability is away from 0 ( symmetrically to the left and the right ) .",
    "the higher the coupling constant , the further away this highest probability position .",
    "the probability of the equilibrium position is zero here .",
    "all oscillators have the same position probability distribution in the periodic boundary case , as they are all equivalent ( completely symmetric on a circle ) .",
    "in the case of fixed wall boundary conditions , the behavior also follows the classical properties , with the first and last oscillators ( those fixed to the wall ) `` oscillating less '' compared to those away from the wall .",
    "we end the paper by some concluding remarks in section  6 .",
    "in this subsection , we briefly recall the algebraic treatment of the hamiltonian for a system consisting of coupled harmonic oscillators , with periodic boundary conditions , treated as a wigner quantum system  @xcite .",
    "in several models  @xcite such a quantum system consisting of a linear chain of @xmath0 identical harmonic oscillators coupled by springs is used .",
    "the hamiltonian of such a system is given by : @xmath22 where each oscillator has mass @xmath3 and frequency @xmath4 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 stand for the position and momentum operator for the @xmath5th oscillator ( or rather , @xmath23 measures the displacement of the @xmath5th mass point with respect to its equilibrium position ) , and @xmath25 is the coupling strength . in the case of periodic boundary conditions ( indicated by the index in @xmath26 ) , one assumes in   @xmath27 with these periodic boundary conditions one can think of the oscillators as being located on a circle , as the last oscillator is again coupled to the first one .    in  @xcite , it was shown that one can relax the canonical commutation relations for the operators @xmath23 and @xmath24 , leading to a larger class of solutions for the system described by  .",
    "this is known as a wigner quantum system approach  @xcite . in this approach ,",
    "one imposes the compatibility of hamilton s equations @xmath28 ( formal derivatives ) and the heisenberg equations @xmath29 , \\quad       { \\dot{\\hat{q}}}_r = \\frac{i}{\\hbar}[\\hat{h}_p,\\hat{q}_r ]   \\qquad        ( r=1,2,\\ldots , n )       \\label{heis}\\ ] ] when viewed as operator equations . these compatibility conditions ( ccs )",
    "read @xmath30 & = -\\frac{i\\hbar } { m } \\hat{p}_r , \\label{ccpq1}\\\\ { }     [ \\hat{h}_p,\\hat{p}_r ] & = -i\\hbar cm\\,{\\hat q}_{r-1}+i\\hbar m(\\omega^2 + 2c)\\,{\\hat q}_r - i\\hbar cm \\,{\\hat q}_{r+1 } , \\label{ccpq2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 . under the canonical commutation relations , the ccs   and   are automatically satisfied . but the system  - , with @xmath11 given by  , has other interesting solutions  @xcite .    to study these other solutions ,",
    "one introduces discrete fourier transforms of the ( self - adjoint ) operators @xmath23 and @xmath24 by @xmath34 where @xmath35 are positive numbers with @xmath36 and @xmath37 are operators satisfying @xmath38 . in terms of these new operators ,",
    "the hamiltonian reads  @xcite @xmath39 note that we no longer require the canonical commutation relations for the operators @xmath23 and @xmath24 , so also the operators @xmath37 no longer satisfy the usual boson relations @xmath40=0 $ ] and @xmath41=\\delta_{jk}$ ] . in the wqs approach ,",
    "the relations that should be satisfied follow from  - , and read explicitly  @xcite : @xmath42= \\pm 2 \\omega_k a_k^\\pm , \\quad \\ ( k=1,2,\\ldots , n )",
    ".   \\label{algrelations1}\\ ] ]      in this subsection we consider a similar system , again consisting of coupled harmonic oscillators , but this time with fixed wall boundary conditions .",
    "now the hamiltonian reads : @xmath43 with the same data as in  , but @xmath44 in other words , we assume that the first and last oscillator ( i.e.  the oscillators numbered @xmath45 and @xmath0 ) are attached to a fixed wall .",
    "the treatment of this hamiltonian in the wqs approach is very similar to the previous subsection .",
    "in fact , the ccs  - remain the same ( with @xmath26 replaced by @xmath46 , but with @xmath47 ) .",
    "these different boundary conditions lead to a different type of transform . instead of a discrete fourier transform , we now use a discrete sine transform .",
    "more explicitly , we introduce the following transformations of the ( self - adjoint ) operators @xmath7 and @xmath8 : @xmath48 where the @xmath49 are positive numbers given by @xmath50 the operators @xmath51 satisfy the adjointness conditions @xmath52 in terms of these new operators , the hamiltonian   is given by : @xmath53 and the compatibility conditions become @xmath54= \\pm 2 \\tilde\\omega_k a_k^\\pm , \\quad \\ ( k=1,2,\\ldots , n ) .",
    "\\label{algrelations2}\\ ] ]    so the algebraic expression of the hamiltonian , and the ccs , are the same in the two cases considered , apart from the replacement @xmath55 .",
    "this implies that the algebraic solutions will be similar , even though the conclusions about physical properties will be different due to the different numerical values of the numbers @xmath35 and @xmath49 .      in was shown in  @xcite that the triple relations   involving both anti - commutators and commutators have a solution in terms of generators of the lie superalgebra @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "more explicitly , let @xmath1 be the lie superalgebra with standard basis elements @xmath56 ( @xmath57 ) where @xmath58 and @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) are odd elements ( @xmath61 ) and the remaining basis elements are even ( having degree 0 ) , with bracket @xmath62 and star condition @xmath63 .",
    "then a solution of  ( [ algrelations1 ] ) is provided by @xmath64 where @xmath65 all these numbers @xmath66 should be nonnegative . by the periodic boundary conditions , the @xmath66 s satisfy @xmath67 , and @xmath68",
    "it was analysed in  @xcite that all these @xmath66 s are indeed positive provided the coupling constant @xmath17 lies in a certain interval @xmath69 , with @xmath70 some critical value depending upon @xmath0 .    in the case of fixed wall boundary conditions , the analysis is slightly different .",
    "a solution of  ( [ algrelations2 ] ) is given by @xmath71 where in this case @xmath72 again , all these numbers @xmath73 should be nonnegative . first , note that for @xmath25 one has that @xmath74 and hence that @xmath75 thus all @xmath73 are positive if and only if @xmath76 is positive .",
    "secondly , for @xmath77 one has that @xmath78 , and since @xmath76 is a continuous function of @xmath17 there exist positive values of @xmath17 such that @xmath79 .",
    "thus , there exists ( in general ) a critical value @xmath80 such that each @xmath81 for @xmath82 and such that for @xmath83 one has that @xmath84 .",
    "the same upper bound on the critical value @xmath80 applies as on @xmath70 in periodic boundary conditions case since one can mimic the proof of  ( * ? ? ? * proposition 2 ) . since for @xmath85",
    "we have that @xmath86 there are no conditions on @xmath17 in this case . also for @xmath87 there are no conditions since one can verify ( numerically ) that in this case @xmath88 . in table",
    "[ tab : crit ] , we compare the critical values @xmath89 of the periodic boundary conditions case with the critical values @xmath90 .",
    "one notices that these critical values are interleaved , and that they become more and more similar as the number of oscillators @xmath0 increases .",
    ".critical values @xmath89 ( periodic boundary conditions ) and @xmath90 ( fixed wall boundary conditions ) .",

    "this follows immediately from the inequalities  .",
    "of course , these eigenvalues are always nondegenerate .",
    "we now turn to the study of the spectrum of the position operators @xmath7 , which are , under the solutions   or  , quite arbitrary odd elements of the lie superalgebra @xmath1 .",
    "this is precisely the topic of  @xcite where the eigenvalues ( and eigenvectors ) of the position operators @xmath7 were determined for arbitrary unitary irreducible representations of the lie superalgebra @xmath1 .",
    "thus the method developed there will be applied both to the case of periodic and fixed wall boundary conditions .",
    "the position operator @xmath7 , given by  , can be written as @xmath93 where we use the notation @xmath94 the odd @xmath1 operators @xmath95 are part of a more general set of operators @xmath96 where @xmath97 is a unitary @xmath98 matrix determined by the coefficients in   and in @xmath99 for @xmath100 .",
    "the new operators @xmath101 and @xmath102 satisfy the same defining relations as the elements @xmath103 and @xmath104 ; in other words , they generate the lie superalgebra @xmath105  @xcite .",
    "thanks to the introduction of these new operators , one can determine the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the position operators @xmath7 .",
    "this follows from the observation that   is essentially an element of @xmath106 in the decomposition @xmath107 .",
    "the following result was obtained in  @xcite :    in the representation @xmath2 , all operators @xmath7 ( @xmath6 ) have the same spectrum .",
    "the operator @xmath23 has @xmath108 distinct eigenvalues given by @xmath109 the multiplicity of the eigenvalue @xmath19 is @xmath110 .",
    "let us also briefly describe the corresponding orthonormal eigenvectors @xmath111 ( with @xmath112 a multiplicity label ) corresponding to the eigenvalue @xmath19 ( see  @xcite for the details ) . for @xmath113 ,",
    "one has : @xmath114 where @xmath115 . for the eigenvalue  0 ( @xmath116 ) ,",
    "the eigenvectors read @xmath117 we still need to describe the vectors @xmath118 of @xmath2 in terms of the basis vectors @xmath18 . essentially , the vectors @xmath118 are chosen in such a way that the action of the `` new '' @xmath1 elements @xmath119 on @xmath118 are the same as the action of the `` old '' @xmath1 elements @xmath56 on @xmath18 . for the new highest weight vector , one has : @xmath120 the remaining vectors",

    "some specific properties of the spectrum of @xmath7 will be considered together with those for the fixed wall boundary conditions , in the next subsection .",
    "the expressions for the eigenvectors will be used in the following section , where position probability distributions are studied .",
    "the formal part of the analysis will be rather similar to that of the previous case of periodic boundary conditions .",
    "but the outcome will show one major difference : the spectrum of @xmath7 is now dependent ( albeit in a simple way ) on the position @xmath5 of the oscillator in the chain .",
    "this result is completely in accordance with physical intuition as the oscillators in the chain are clearly no longer equivalent , since we have two distinguished ( and equivalent ) oscillators which mark the beginning and the end of the chain .    under the solution   of",
    ", the position operator @xmath7 , which is given by  , becomes @xmath123 here , we used the abbreviations @xmath124 comparing with  , it is clear that @xmath125 is obtained from @xmath126 by performing the substitutions @xmath127 the same substitution can be used for @xmath128 and @xmath129 .",
    "then the analysis of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of @xmath7 is determined by the same technique as in the previous subsection .",
    "in particular :    in the representation @xmath2 , the operators @xmath7 ( @xmath6 ) have a spectrum depending upon @xmath5",

    "although the spectrum of @xmath7 is now dependent on the position of the oscillator in the chain ( i.e.  on @xmath5 ) through the constant @xmath134 in  , one still has the expected symmetry that the spectra of @xmath7 and @xmath135 coincide , since @xmath136 .    the dependence on @xmath5 of the spectrum of @xmath7 is completely determined by @xmath134 , which on its turn depends on the coupling constant  @xmath17 . in figure  [ fig : spec - q ] , we will plot some of these eigenvalues as a function of  @xmath17 . for these plots ,",

    "this means that the spectrum of oscillators close to the wall is more centered around their equilibrium positions than for oscillators in the middle of the chain .",

    "this effect could be related to an increasing effect of `` collective '' motions ( lattice vibrations ) as the coupling constant becomes larger .    in the above figures , we have concentrated on a particular @xmath149-value , i.e.  on a particular eigenvalue .",
    "of course , the complete spectrum of each @xmath7 operator is easy to describe : it is simply a constant times @xmath150 , @xmath151 .",
    "this is a simple distribution that will be depicted in the figures of the following section .",
    "in this section , we shall establish some facts about the position probability distributions of the two systems .",
    "it is a well known fact ( postulate ) of quantum mechanics that when measuring an observable , the measurement always yields an eigenvalue of the ( self - adjoint ) operator associated with that observable .",
    "the probability of measuring a certain eigenvalue when the system is in a certain state is determined by the expansion of that state in terms of ( orthonormal ) eigenvectors of the operator at hand .",

    "in other words we plot the position probability distribution function when the system is in a fixed stationary state @xmath18 .",

    "the position and momentum operators are ( odd ) elements of the lie superalgebra @xmath1 .",
    "the physical properties of the system then follow from the representations of @xmath1 considered . here , we have introduced the rather simple ladder representations @xmath2 , a class of unitary irreducible representations of @xmath1 ( or rather , of its compact form @xmath16 ) .",
    "for these representations , we have determined the energy spectrum , which was rather easy due to the simple action of the hamiltonian operator in the standard basis of @xmath2 .",
    "we have also determined the spectrum of the position operators ; this task was more difficult because of the more complicated action of these operators in the basis of @xmath2 .",
    "the techniques developed in  @xcite allow to construct explicitly the eigenvectors of the position operators , for both systems under consideration",
    ".    the analysis of the spectrum of the position operators , and their probabilities when the system is in a certain stationary state , lead to interesting properties .",
    "the spectrum is discrete , centered around the equilibrium position ; the number of possible position values depends on @xmath20 ( it is @xmath108 ) .",
    "the width of this discrete support depends on the coupling constant @xmath17 , and  only in the case of fixed wall boundary conditions  on the order @xmath5 of the oscillator in the chain of @xmath0 oscillators .",
    "the position probability distributions , discussed in detail in the previous section , have properties similar to those of a classical system of coupled oscillators .",
    "the current paper was still dealing with solutions arising from the lie superalgebra @xmath1 , although a different class of representations was considered than in  @xcite . as indicated in a previous paper  @xcite , also other types of solutions for the compatibility conditions",
