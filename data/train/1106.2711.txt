    "<S> we consider the observables of the decay @xmath16 theoretically . compared with the mass of @xmath8 meson , both the masses of muon and electron are very small , so the analysis of @xmath17 is almost the same as @xmath0 .    in the sm for @xmath18 </S>",

    "<S> this operator is from the loop suppressed flavor changing neutral current , the value of @xmath27 is much smaller than those of the coefficients @xmath28 of tree operators , and thus only marginally affecting our numerical estimates . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the contribution of diagram 1(b ) has been neglected safely in this work . in diagram 1(c ) , the @xmath8 meson decays to a @xmath29 meson by exchanging a @xmath3 boson , where the photon can be emitted from either of the five crosses in diagram . </S>",
    "<S> when a photon is emitted from the @xmath3 boson , the diagram will be highly suppressed by the two @xmath3 propagators and because of the large @xmath3 mass . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we ignore this contribution in our calculation , too . </S>",

    "<S> explicitly , we have found that the branching ratio is @xmath115 and the forward - backward asymmetry is zero at the tree level . </S>",
    "<S> it is clear that such an order of magnitude for branching ratio could be well measured at the ongoing @xmath8 factories and large hadron collider as well as future super-@xmath8 factories . </S>"
