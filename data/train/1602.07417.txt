    "recently , graphene , a two - dimensional dirac material@xcite becomes an attractive research field due to its exotic quantum properties , such as the unconventional quantum hall effect , the klein paradox @xcite , the josephson effect @xcite , and the n - p junction @xcite .",
    "bilayer graphenes are weakly - coupled two single - layer graphene by interlayer carbon hopping , typically arranged in the bernal ( ab ) stacking arrangement .",
    "in addition to the interesting underlying physics properties , bilayer graphenes have the potential electronics applications , owing to the possibility of controlling both the carrier density and energy band gap through doping or gating @xcite .",
    "a dual - gated structure allows electrical and independent control of the perpendicular electric field and the carrier density @xcite .",
    "intrinsic bilayer graphene has no band gap between its conduction and valence bands and the low - energy dispersion is quadratic with massless chiral quasiparticles@xcite .",
    "this is in contrast to what is observed in the monolayer which has a linear dispersion with massless quasiparticles .    in this paper",
    ", we consider a bilayer graphene with asymmetry line defects and study the defect states and the electric conductivity using the landauer - bttiker theory .",
    "this nontrivial physics properties of the defect states may be applied to a new type of devices based on the bilayer graphene .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : firstly , we introduce the tight - binding hamiltonian of the bilayer graphene .",
    "secondly , we calculate the energy structure of bilayer graphene with line lattice defects .",
    "next , we show the effects of the line defects on the electric conductance , including the effects of defect - line number and the vertical electric field .",
    "finally , summary and conclusions are provided .",
    "bilayer graphene can be classified according to the stacking type . generally , we focus on ab stacking , with an arrangement that was experimentally verified in epitaxial graphene by ohta et al @xcite .",
    "fig.1(a ) is an illustration of a bilayer graphene , that consists of four sublattices @xmath0 @xmath1 @xmath2 @xmath3 and the lattice constant is set to unit . to study the system simply , we mainly focus on the non - interaction case ,",
    "of which an ab - stacked bilayer graphene model only contains first nearest - neighbor ( nn ) intralayer hopping and nn interlayer hopping .",
    "the tight - binding hamiltonian is given by @xmath4 here , @xmath5 is the annihilation operator at sublattice @xmath6 at site @xmath7 where @xmath8 represents the upper layer and @xmath9 represents the lower layer of the bilayer material .",
    "the first term in the hamiltonian describes intralayer nearest - neighbor coupling inside the layer , the second term describes the interlayer coupling between the sublattice of the lower layer @xmath3 and the sublattice of the upper layer @xmath10 and here we set @xmath11 ev , @xmath12 ev ) @xcite .    due to spacial translation symmetry , intrinsic bilayer graphene can be described in momentum space and the number of sites in a primitive cell is four .",
    "owing to the inversion symmetry in neutral bilayer graphene , there exists the degeneracy of the highest valence and lowest conduction bands .",
    "if the inversion symmetry is broken , an mass gap opens in the low energy spectrum @xcite .",
    "when we assume that the upper and lower layers are at different electrostatic potentials @xmath13 ( normally called bias potentials ) , the inversion symmetry is broken .",
    "hence , the energy difference between the two layers is parameterized by the energy @xmath13 .",
    "then , the hamiltonian becomes @xmath14where @xmath15 is the external electrostatic potential .",
    "here , we consider a staggered energy potential for bilayer graphene with @xmath16 on the upper layer and @xmath17 on the lower layer , where @xmath18 is a controllable constant quantity .",
    "in this paper , we assume that a line - lattice defect lies on the upper layer , as represented by the highlighted red line marked in fig.1(b ) , which is a zigzag lattice chain . to study the line defects on bilayer graphene",
    ", we simulate lattice defects on bilayer graphene by the following method : for a target lattice site @xmath19 on line defects , we set all the coupling hopping parameters connected to the site @xmath19 to @xmath20 and the local on - site energy potential @xmath21 to be a relatively larger value . to study the energy spectrum we assume the bilayer graphene is semi - infinite , that is , the system is finite along the @xmath22-direction and infinite along the @xmath23-direction .",
    "thus , the line defect is an infinite zigzag chain along the @xmath23-direction . to study the localized states induced by line defects , we use    the period boundary conditions ( pbc ) along the @xmath22-direction which makes the system a nanotube . by performing fourier analysis and diagonalization",
    ", we may obtain the eigenvalues ( or energy spectrum ) @xmath24 and the corresponding eigenstates .",
    "the effects of the line defects and vertical electric potential are shown in fig.2 , fig.3 , fig.4 , respectively .",
    "for the case of @xmath25 , there exists bulk energy gap , and the value of the gap becomes larger with an increase of @xmath13 .",
    "in particular , a line defect leads to localized states ( or defect states ) .",
    "we consider a line defect on the upper layer and set the total number of zigzag chain ( parallel to the red zigzag line in fig.1(b ) ) along @xmath22-direction to be @xmath26 .",
    "when @xmath27 there exist defect states ( marked by the red solid line and green solid line in fig.2(a ) ) and zero - energy states , which has a flat band . for this case , the wave function of zero - energy state is localized around the defects ( fig.2(b ) ) .",
    "the length - scale of the localized states along @xmath23-direction is @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the energy gap of bulk system . for the case of @xmath25",
    ", we also have the localized states around line defects . for this case",
    ", a bulk gap appears and the defect states becomes dispersive .",
    "the probability density of zero - energy wave function @xmath30 becomes extended on both upper layer and lower layer of the bilayer graphene , and the maximum value of @xmath30 is on the corresponding positions on lower layer .",
    "furthermore , we can also study the cases with several parallel line defects .",
    "for two parallel line defects on the upper layer , there exists localized defect states which are located around corresponding line defects , and the electric field induces a finite bulk energy gap ( fig.4 ) .",
    "bilayer graphene exhibits nontrivial transport properties owing to its unusual band structure where the conduction and valence bands touch with quadratic dispersion .",
    "one of the earliest theoretical papers studying the conductivity through ab - stacked bilayer graphene was ref .",
    "@xcite where it was assumed that the band structure of the bilayer is described by two bands closest to the dirac point energy .",
    "transport properties and the nature of conductivity near the dirac point were probed experimentally @xcite and investigated theoretically @xcite .",
    "we use the well - known landauer - bttiker equation to obtain the electric conductivity . to show the effect of the line defect on the electric conductance",
    ", we seperate the original system into three parts : left lead , right lead and the center device area , as shown in the schematic diagram in fig.5 .",
    "the left and right leads are semi - infinite and the center device area has finite size . the number of primitive cells along the @xmath23-direction is @xmath31 ; the number of zigzag chain along the @xmath22-direction is @xmath32 . here",
    ", it is a zigzag edge along the @xmath23-direction and an armchair edge along the @xmath33-direction .",
    "hence , for the lead - center - lead bilayer graphene system , the zero - temperature conductance is calculated using the landauer - bttiker formalism @xcite:@xmath34    where @xmath35 is the transmission from the incoming state @xmath36 in the left lead to the outgoing state @xmath37 in the right lead .",
    "the terminal electric conductance can be written as @xmath38 and the transmission probability @xmath39 through it is @xmath40,\\]]where @xmath41 @xmath42 is the left ( right ) coupling matrix , and @xmath43 @xmath44 is the retarded ( advanced ) green s function of the center part of the system .",
    "the single particle green s function of the center devise area @xmath45 is defined as @xmath46^{-1}\\]]where @xmath47 is the energy of the particle , @xmath48 is a positive infinitely - small real number , @xmath49 represents the identity matrix , and @xmath50 is the hamiltonian of the center devise area . @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) are the contact self - energies reflecting the effect of coupling of the center part of the graphene to the left ( right ) leads .",
    "we obtain the expressions for the self - energies of the two leads as @xmath53where @xmath54 @xmath55 is the coupling matrix of the center part to the right ( left ) lead .",
    "subsequently , we can successfully calculate the electron transmission probability using @xmath56 @xmath57 @xmath58 .",
    "@xmath59 are the surface green s functions of the right ( left ) leads .",
    "hence , we can determine the conductivity in the presence and absence of line defects .    to compare with the electrical transport effects of the line defects ,",
    "the electric conductance of perfect bilayer graphene devices is also given ( fig.6 ) .",
    "we use pbc along the @xmath22-direction , that is , the center devices area is a bilayer graphene nanotube . when @xmath60 , the value of @xmath61 near @xmath62 is @xmath63 , which is double to the value of one layer graphene @xmath64 owing to the degeneracy of the highest valence and lowest conduction bands . when @xmath25 , the value of @xmath61 at @xmath62 approaches zero , which indicates that the system generates a bulk energy gap , and the larger @xmath13 results in a larger width of gap",
    ". however , the electric conductance shows additional features induced by the line defects as shown in fig.7 . when @xmath60 the value of @xmath61 near @xmath62 is about @xmath64 .",
    "when @xmath25 there is @xmath65 , and from the contrast of pure bilayer graphene and symmetric defects it is clear that this is the result of the particle - hole symmetry breaking by the asymmetric defects @xcite .",
    "now , the degeneracy of the zero energy is left and the energy spectrum becomes asymmetry .",
    "hence , the conductance can be controlled by the vertical electric potential and the line defects in this case . as a result , this one - dimensional line electric channel has the potential to be applied in the nanotechnology engineering .",
    "in this paper , we studied the physics properties of a bilayer graphene with line defects , including the defect - induced localized states and the electric conductivity .",
    "we found that the line defect on a certain layer of the bilayer graphene leads to an electric channel .",
    "when @xmath60 , the localized states on single layer has a flat band with zero energy . when @xmath25 the system becomes gapped and the localized modes have the distribution on both layers",
    "the additional conductance @xmath61 from line defect is obtained . this effect from line defects may be applid in electronic devices based on bilayer graphene .",
