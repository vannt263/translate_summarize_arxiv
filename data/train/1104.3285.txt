    "in a recent paper @xcite , by using regge pole techniques , we have developed a new and universal description of the absorption problem for a massless scalar field propagating in static spherically symmetric black holes of arbitrary dimension endowed with a photon sphere .",
    "we have shown , in particular , that the high - energy absorption cross section is well approximated , in the eikonal regime , by the sum of two contributions : the geometrical cross section of the black hole photon sphere ( i.e. , the so - called capture cross section of the black hole ) and a sinc function involving the geometrical characteristics ( orbital period and lyapunov exponent ) of the null unstable geodesics lying on this photon sphere .",

    "more precisely , in section 2 , from a numerical analysis , we shall first show that , beyond the eikonal description , the absorption cross section of the schwarzschild black hole presents a simple fine structure .",

    ", we shall extend the previous considerations to static spherically symmetric black holes endowed with a photon sphere and apply the formalism developed to the five- and six - dimensional schwarzschild - tangherlini black holes and to the four - dimensional reissner - nordstrm black hole . in a brief conclusion ( our section 4 )",
    ", we shall consider some possible consequences of our present work and show numerically , for the schwarzschild black hole , the existence of a complicated hyperfine structure lying beyond the fine structure .",
    "finally , in a much more technical appendix , we shall provide some asymptotic expansions for the regge poles and for the corresponding residues of the greybody factors which are useful to describe analytically the fine structure and which could be helpful to analyze the hyperfine structure .    throughout this paper , we shall use units such that @xmath0 and we shall assume a harmonic time dependence @xmath1 for the fields .",

    "it is important to recall that ( [ sigma_abs_sc3 ] ) converges very rapidly and that the contribution of the regge poles with @xmath46 is practically negligible ( see figure 2 of ref .",
    "so , by using the rough approximations @xmath47 and @xmath48 and taking into account only the contribution of the first regge pole , we obtained from ( [ sigma_abs_sc3 ] ) the eikonal approximation ( [ sigma_abs_pr_a_app ] ) for the fluctuations of the absorption cross section ( [ sigma_abs ] ) .    of course , approximations ( [ prapproxwkb_rough ] ) and ( [ resapproxwkb_rough ] ) are too rough to permit us to understand the existence of the fine structure .",

    "it is now important , from a physical point of view , to note that the fine structure , as the eikonal contribution , is only due to the  surface wave \" trapped near the photon sphere which is associated with the first regge pole ( for the interpretation of regge poles in terms of  surface waves \" , we refer to refs .",
