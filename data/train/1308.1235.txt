    "anti - de sitter ( ads ) spacetime is the unique maximally symmetric solution of the vacuum einstein equations @xmath0 with negative cosmological constant @xmath1 .    geometrically ,",
    "ads@xmath2 can be thought of as being wrapped infinitely many times around hyperboloid @xmath3 embedded in flat , @xmath4 invariant space , with a line element @xmath5 parametrization @xmath6 with @xmath7 yields induced metric on the hyperboloid in the form @xmath8 this metric is indeed a solution to the vacuum einstein equations with .",
    "conformal infinity for this metric , located at @xmath9 is the timelike cylinder @xmath10 with the boundary metric @xmath11 .",
    "asymptotically anti - de sitter ( aads ) spacetimes ( that is spacetimes which share the conformal boundary with ads but may be very different in the bulk , in particular may contain horizons ) have come to play a central role in theoretical physics , prominently due to the ads / cft correspondence which conjectures a duality between gravity in the ads bulk and a quantum conformal field theory with a large number of strongly interacting degrees of freedom living in the spacetime corresponding to the ads conformal boundary@xcite . by the positive energy theorem ,",
    "ads spacetime is a ground state among aads spacetimes , much as minkowski spacetime is a ground state among asymptotically flat spacetimes .",
    "the evolution of small perturbations of these ground states are different . in the case of minkowski",
    ", small perturbations disperse to infinity and the spacetime is asymptotically stable @xcite .",
    "in contrast , asymptotic stability of ads is precluded because the conformal boundary acts like a mirror at which perturbations propagating outwards bounce off and return to the bulk that results in complex nonlinear wave interactions in an effectively bounded domain .",
    "understanding of these interactions is the key to the problem of stability of ads spacetime .",
    "a recent numerical and analytic study of the four dimensional spherically symmetric einstein - massless scalar field equations with negative cosmological constant indicated that ads space may be unstable against the formation of a black hole under large class of arbitrarily small perturbations @xcite .",
    "qualitatively the same results were obtained later in higher dimensions @xcite . although gravitational collapse seems to be a generic fate of a small perturbation of ads , it was suggested in @xcite that there may also exist a set of initial data for which the evolution remains globally regular in time .",
    "this conjecture was substantiated in @xcite , where the evidence for the existence of globally regular , nonlinearly stable , time - periodic solutions in the einstein ads - massless scalar field system was given .",
    "similar class of globally regular , nonlinearly stable , asymptotically ads solutions , namely boson stars was studied in @xcite .",
    "the similar behavior is expected for the pure vacuum case with simplifying symmetry assumptions @xcite and with no symmetry assumptions @xcite .",
    "the outcome of all these studies suggests that the structure of phase space for gravity with negative cosmological constant is complicated and probably for still some time numerical simulations will be the key tool to investigate this problem and to assist analytic attempts like @xcite . thus in this short lecture notes we will concentrate on numerical tricks and details used in numerical codes of @xcite that are usually omitted in research papers , however crucial they are for stable long - time numerical simulations of aads spacetimes .",
    "to make the long - time numerical investigation of ads stability tractable we assume spherical symmetry . since by birkhoff s theorem spherically symmetric vacuum solutions are static , we need to add matter to generate dynamics .",
    "a simple matter model is the minimally coupled massless scalar field in @xmath12 spacetime dimensions @xcite : @xmath13 let us recall that in the asymptotically flat case ( @xmath14 ) this model has led to important insights , such as the proof of the weak cosmic censorship by christodoulou @xcite and the discovery of critical phenomena at the threshold for black hole formation by choptuik @xcite .",
    "we parametrize the @xmath15dimensional asymptotically ads metric by the ansatz @xmath16 where @xmath17 , @xmath18 is the round metric on @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 , @xmath23 are functions of @xmath24 . for this ansatz",
    "the evolution of a self - gravitating massless scalar field @xmath25 is governed ( see the accompanying mathematica notebook ` equations.nb ` @xcite ) by the following system ( using units in which @xmath26 ) @xmath27    \\label{ms_in_ads_d+1:eq_00 }    a ' \\!&= \\!\\frac{d-2 + 2\\sin^2{\\!x } } { \\sin{x}\\cos{x } } \\ , ( 1-a ) -    \\sin{x}\\cos{x } \\ , a \\left ( \\phi^2 + \\pi^2 \\right ) ,    \\\\[1ex ]    \\label{ms_in_ads_d+1:eqs_10_11 }    \\delta ' \\!&=\\ ! - \\sin{x}\\cos{x } \\left ( \\phi^2 + \\pi^2 \\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 note that the length scale @xmath31 drops out from the equations .",
    "this system has a one - parameter family of static solutions ( @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 ) which are schwarzschild - ads black holes for @xmath35 and the pure ads for @xmath36 . in analogy to the schwarzschild - ads black hole",
    "the mass function for the system can be defined as @xmath37 .",
    "we restrict our attention to smooth solutions with a finite mass @xmath38 smoothness at spatial infinity and the requirement of the total mass ( [ mass ] ) to be finite , imply that near @xmath39 ( using @xmath40 ) ( see the accompanying mathematica notebook ` boundary.nb ` @xcite ) @xmath41 where the subsequent terms in the expansions are expressed by constant @xmath42 and the functions @xmath43 , @xmath44 and their derivatives .",
    "these are in turn uniquely determined by the evolution of initial data .. ] thus in this particular model if we require the total mass to be finite it implies the mass to be conserved as well .",
    "the local well - posedness of the above initial - boundary value problem was proved in @xcite .",
    "it is important to stress that for _ odd _",
    "@xmath45 higher even terms in the expansion for @xmath46 do not vanish ( they vanish identically _ only _ in the limit @xmath47 ) . * exercise  1 : * verify this statement using ` boundary.nb ` notebook . thus for @xmath48 @xmath45 the boundary behavior of the scalar field is not compatible with eigenfunctions of the linear self - adjoint operator , that governs the evolution of a massless scalar field on a _ fixed _ ads@xmath49 background .",
    "this operator reads @xmath50 .",
    "its spectrum is given by @xmath51 , @xmath52 and the eigenfunctions read @xmath53 where @xmath54 are the jacobi polynomials . these eigenfunctions form an orthonormal base in the hilbert space of functions @xmath55 , \\ , ( \\tan x)^{d-1 } \\ , dx\\right)$ ] .",
    "below we denote the inner product on this hilbert space by @xmath56 .",
    "we solve the system ( [ ms_in_ads_d+1:eq_wave])-([ms_in_ads_d+1:eqs_10_11 ] ) numerically using a fourth - order accurate finite - difference approximation for spatial derivatives in evolution equations .",
    "for the general introduction to finite difference approximation see hirotada okawa s lecture in this volume . to integrate the evolution equations in time we use the method of lines and a 4th - order runge - kutta ( rk4 ) scheme , where at each time step the metric functions are updated by solving constraint equations : the hamiltonian constraint ( [ ms_in_ads_d+1:eq_00 ] ) and the slicing condition ( [ ms_in_ads_d+1:eqs_10_11 ] ) with rk4 in space .",
    "the ( adjustable ) time step @xmath57 is kept @xmath58 for the constant spatial grid spacing @xmath59 .",
    "preservation of the momentum constraint @xmath60 can be monitored to check the accuracy of the code .",
    "this ( fully constrained ) scheme allows for stable long - time evolution .",
    "another crucial ingredient of stable evolution of nonlinear evolution equations on compact domains is careful treatment of boundaries of numerical domain . here as method of thumb we avoid nonsymmetric stencils at the boundary .",
    "instead we try to put as much analytic information as we have into the code .",
    "that is we use :    1 .",
    "symmetry of the function .",
    "if we know that the function is symmetric or antisymmetric with respect to the boundary of numerical domain we use this information in finite - difference approximation for the derivatives of this function at the boundary .",
    "for example in the 4th order finite difference approximation for the 1st derivative of the function @xmath61 at @xmath62 @xmath63 we can put @xmath64 for symmetric and antisymmetric functions respectively .",
    "taylor expansion of the function . if we know the taylor expansion of the function at the boundary of numerical domain we can use this information to express the function at the boundary with its values inside the domain .",
    "for example if the function @xmath61 has the following taylor expansion at @xmath62 @xmath65 , then from the set of linear equations @xmath66 for @xmath67 we can get the coefficients @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 and in particular @xmath71 .",

    "it often happens that the right hand side of evolution equations at the boundary is of the form @xmath72 ( as happens here for @xmath73 in ( [ ms_in_ads_d+1:eq_wave ] ) at @xmath62 and @xmath9 ) .",
    "a useful numerical trick to deal in such case is to use de lhspital s rule .",
    "for example suppose that @xmath74 . then to deal with numerical instabilities produced by @xmath75 at small",
    "@xmath76 one can use the identity @xmath77 , where the instabilities coming from small denominators are suppressed by the small factor @xmath76 comparing to the leading term @xmath78 .",
    "we have learned this useful trick from anil zenginolu during his stay in cracow in 2010 .    in particular , in our code numerical boundaries ( @xmath62 and @xmath9 )",

    "if the de lhspital trick is not applied at @xmath62 then one should use the equation for @xmath79 in the form ( [ ms_in_ads_d+1:eq_wave ] ) , as the form ( [ ms_in_ads_d+1:eq_wave(2 ) ] ) is numerically unstable ( ! ) in the symmetry center .",

    "if it drops below a certain threshold ( that we set to be @xmath93 on the grid with @xmath94 points , with @xmath95 ) we say that an apparent horizon forms and we stop the evolution .    if transfer of energy to higher modes of linearized problem is present during the evolution of initial data , then higher spatial resolution may be needed .",
    "if that happens we perform global mesh refinement from @xmath96 to @xmath97 grid spacing .",
    "this brute force approach requires a lot of computational power and should be replaced with some more subtle algorithm in the future . at this point",
    "the brute force is supplied with parallel computing .",
    "we use mpi library ( for a concise introduction to mpi programming see @xcite ) . while stepping in time in evolution equations ( [ ms_in_ads_d+1:eq_wave ] )",
    "is naturally suited for parallelization , solving the constraints ( [ ms_in_ads_d+1:eq_00 ] , [ ms_in_ads_d+1:eqs_10_11 ] ) can be a thin throat for parallel computing .",
    "we solve this problem in the way , that processors are not synchronized on the grid .",
    "that is , while solving a constraint equation ( what is being done in sequence from @xmath62 to @xmath9 ) a processor waits only for its nearest left - hand neighbor on the grid to complete the task . as a result processors",
    "are not synchronized and these starting solving the constraints ( at @xmath62 in our case ) can be a few steps in time ahead comparing to those finishing a given time step ( on a part of the grid close to @xmath9 in our case ) . in this setting , time step and horizon formation control that requires exchange of information between non - neighboring processors is realized with non - blocking mpi library procedures ` mpi_isend ` and ` mpi_irecv ` . in this way we get a scaling with the factor of two with the number of cores .",

    "we numerically evolve initial data of the form @xmath101 with fixed width @xmath102 and varying amplitude @xmath103 . for such data",
    "the scalar field is well localized in space and propagates in time as a narrow wave packet .",
    "we look at the ricci curvature in the center , @xmath104 , that can serve as a good indicator for the onset of instability .",
    "this quantity oscillates with frequency @xmath105 ( as it takes time @xmath106 for the wave packet to make the round trip from and back to the center ) . an upper envelope of the oscillations of @xmath107 is shown in fig .",
    "we see that after some time , when the amplitude remains approximately constant , there begins a subsequent phases of ( roughly ) exponential growth , until finally the solution collapses .",
    "it can be seen that the time of onset of the subsequent phases scales as @xmath108 ( see fig .",
    "indeed , after the rescaling @xmath109 all curves of fig .",
    "1a seem to converge to some universal curve ( for this family of initial data with @xmath110 fixed to @xmath111 ) , that means that arbitrarily small perturbations eventually start growing .",
    "note that this behavior is morally tantamount to instability of ads space , regardless of what happens later , in particular whether the solution will collapse or not .",
    "in the second part of @xcite we sketched the mechanism behind this numerically discovered instability of ads in the framework of weakly nonlinear perturbation theory ( that we previously extensively used to predict nonlinear tails of dispersing solution in asymptotically flat case ) . to summarize there are two key ingredients to the mechanism of the instability of ads :    1 .",
    "* conservation of the total mass of the system*. the first crucial ingredient is conservation of the total mass of the system , that ( opposite to a flat case ) can not be dispersed to infinity .",
    "conformal structure of ads space makes it effectively bounded and to make the initial - boundary value problem well posed setting boundary conditions may be needed . in the model at hand reflecting boundary conditions at conformal infinity follow directly from the regularity of solutions of einstein equations at the boundary and the requirement of the total mass ( [ mass ] ) to be finite .",
    "more general models , like conformally coupled scalar field or ads - einstein - yang - mills system , allow for more freedom in setting boundary conditions , where the conservation of the total mass at conformal infinity can be picked up as physically natural boundary condition .",
    "however one should keep in mind that other choices are possible as well .",
    "we are grateful to helmut friedrich for stressing this point .",
    "* resonant spectrum*. the second crucial ingredient for instability is the resonant spectrum of the wave operator on the _ fixed _ ads background ( see the previous section ) . that is the spectrum consists of equidistantly",
    "spaced real numbers .",
    "once the modes of the corresponding wave operator are coupled through gravity ( or nonlinearity ) it results in resonant coupling between the modes that generically , efficiently transfers ( conserved ) energy into higher and higher modes .",
    "we call this process a turbulent transfer of energy , in analogy to navier - stokes equations that transfer the eddies to smaller and smaller spatial scales . in the case of einstein equations",
    "this process is ultimately cut by a black hole formation , but mind the special case of @xmath112 @xcite .",
    "interestingly , it seems that _ asymptotically _ resonant spectrum is also good enough for such turbulent transfer of energy to take place , see @xcite .    to demonstrate the transfer of energy to higher frequencies we define the fourier coefficients @xmath113 and @xmath114 and express the total ( conserved ) mass as the parseval sum @xmath115 , where @xmath116 is the @xmath117-mode energy .",
    "the evolution of the energy spectrum , that is the distribution of mass among the modes , is depicted in fig .  2 for gaussian initial data with @xmath99 .",
    "initially , the energy is concentrated in low modes ; the exponential cutoff of the spectrum expresses the smoothness of initial data . during the evolution",
    "the range of excited modes increases and the spectrum becomes broader . just before horizon formation the spectrum exhibits the power - law scaling @xmath118 with exponent @xmath119 .",
    "this value seems to be universal , i.e. , the same for all initial data , but it changes with dimension  @xmath45 .",
    "our preliminary guess based on studying the instability in @xmath120 is that @xmath121 note that the formation of a black hole provides a cutoff for the turbulent energy cascade ( in amusing analogy to viscosity for the turbulent cascade in fluids ) .",
    "clearly , the formation of the power - law spectrum reflects the loss of smoothness of the solution during collapse ; it would be very interesting to compute @xmath122 analytically .    the plot in fig .",
    "2 was made for the instants of time when the scalar field was imploding through the center , and decaying exponentially fast at infinity ( because we started with compactly supported initial data ) .",
    "mind that , in @xmath48 number of spatial dimensions @xmath45 , if we expressed the total mass as the parseval sum over the modes at instants of time when the scalar pulse is concentrated close to infinity ( with a polynomial decay according to ) we would get steep but still polynomial tail of energy spectrum just because of the fact that the basis of the eigenfunctions of the wave operator on a _ fixed _ ads background is incompatible ( in _ odd _ d ) with the boundary behavior of the massless scalar field in the self - gravitating case . of course , such polynomial decay would have nothing to do with the effect depicted in fig .  2 and",
    "would just illustrate the fact that the @xmath123 base is not well adapted to self - gravitating case in _",
    "odd _ number of spatial dimensions .    .",
    "the fit of the power law @xmath124 at time @xmath125 gives the slope @xmath119 . ]",
    "this section is in fact only a short overview of the paper @xcite , covering the second lecture delivered by one of the authors at nr / hep2 school @xcite .",
    "however weakly nonlinear perturbation theory provides a good hint for explanation of the mechanism of ads instability it fails to provide quantitative predictions for a given initial data , like time of the black hole formation , its initial radius , _ etc .",
    "_ still it proved to be extremely useful in perturbative construction of time - periodic solutions .",
    "it turns out that negative cosmological constant allows for stable , globally regular time - periodic solutions @xcite . in that paper",
    "we constructed time - periodic solutions with two independent methods .",
    "perturbative method consists in representing the time - periodic solution as a perturbative series in the amplitude of a mode dominating perturbative solution .",
    "the subsequent terms in this expansion are determined by removing resonant terms that generically arise .",
    "numerical construction is build upon new spectral code well suited to study the solutions that do not collapse .",
    "convergence of results of these two independent methods makes us feel confident in the results",
    ". moreover numerical evolution of the initial data for a time - periodic solutions found with those methods reproduces this solution .",
    "this is a strong evidence that those time - periodic solutions are nonlinearly stable .",
    "after these lectures had been delivered it was shown in@xcite , that the initial data ( [ idata ] ) with @xmath126 are immune to the turbulent instability .",
    "we are building - up the evidence @xcite that the explanation to this immunity comes from the existence of nonlinearly stable time - periodic solutions in the system .",
    "namely , for the initial data ( [ idata ] ) there is a window in @xmath110 , where they belong to the stability island of time - periodic solution bifurcating from the @xmath127 mode of the massless scalar field propagating on a _ fixed _ ads@xmath128 background .",
    "in these lecture notes we discussed recently conjectured instability of anti - de sitter space , highlighting numerical techniques used in the study of spherically symmetric einstein - massless scalar field system with negative cosmological constant@xcite .",
    "this case is a neat example of the fact that from numerical explorations of einstein s equations there can grow understanding , conjectures , roads to proofs and phenomena that would not have been imaginable in the pre - computer era .",
    "the role of computation in general relativity seems destined to expand in future , playing a role of a telescope for a theoretical physicist .",
    "the dynamics of aads turns out to be an exceptional meeting point of fundamental problems in general relativity , pde theory , theory of turbulence , and high energy physics .",
    "understanding of these connections is still at its infancy .",
    "the issues discussed here raise probably more questions than give answers .",
    "* the proofs of instability of ads and the existence of time - periodic solutions are still lacking .",
    "there is a natural question here : what makes the ads spacetime unstable , while making some other aads solutions@xcite stable . probably it would be rewarding to understand the resonant coupling between the modes and the energy spectrum in more detail .",
    "there is also some tension between numerical@xcite and heuristic results@xcite to what extent only _ asymptotically _ ( that is for high wave numbers ) resonant spectrum is good enough for a turbulent transfer of energy to take place .",
    "* so far , our studies have been restricted to spherical symmetry ( or other effectively @xmath129 dimensional settings ) . thus relaxing symmetry assumptions",
    "should be the next step .",
    "the heuristic arguments@xcite suggest that the similar picture of instability , with some basins of attraction of some stable aads solutions emerges also outside spherical symmetry .",
    "the numerical studies of axially symmetric aads spacetimes containing a black hole have been initiated in@xcite but to build a code capable of evolving small perturbations of ads and detecting eventual black hole formation there is still some way to go . * the next question ( closely related to the previous point ) is about the end state of evolution .",
    "the ads - schwarzschild solution , being stable @xcite , is a natural candidate in spherical symmetry .",
    "however outside spherical symmetry , the problem is more delicate as small ads - kerr black holes are expected to be unstable due to superradiant instability@xcite * there are some more general models like conformaly coupled scalar field or einstein - yang - mills system , allowing for more freedom in prescribing boundary conditions at the timelike boundary of aads .",
    "we are currently studying these more general boundary conditions .",
    "* it might be rewarding to understand better ads / cft counterpart of stable aads solutions .",
    "hopefully we will see some advances at least on the part of these problems in not too far future .",
