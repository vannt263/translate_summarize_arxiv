    "the development of methods for reconstructing the topologies of real networks from the observable data , is of great interest in modern network science .",
    "topology , in combination with the inter - node interactions , determine the function of complex networks  @xcite .",
    "reconstruction methods are often developed within the contexts of particular fields , relying on domain - specific approaches .",
    "these include gene regulations  @xcite , metabolic networks  @xcite , neuroscience  @xcite , or social networks  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "theoretical reconstruction concepts are based on paradigmatic dynamical models such as phase oscillators  @xcite , some of which have been experimentally tested  @xcite . in a similar context ,",
    "techniques for detecting hidden nodes in networks are being investigated  @xcite .",
    "a class of general reconstruction methods exploit the time series obtained by quantifying the network behaviour .",
    "some of them assume the knowledge of the internal interaction functions  @xcite , while others do not  @xcite .",
    "network couplings can be examined via information - theoretic approach  @xcite .",
    "advantage of these methods is that they are _ non - invasive _ , i.e. require no interfering with the on - going network dynamics .    reconstruction methods are often based on examining the inter - node correlations  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "universal network models such as eq.[eq-1 ] , are based on expressing the time derivative of a node as a combination of a local and a coupling term .",
    "inspired by this , we propose a non - invasive reconstruction method , departing from the concept of _ derivative - variable correlation_. our method assumes the dynamical time series to be available as measured observables , and the interaction functions to be known .",
    "we present our theory in a general form , extending our initial results  @xcite .",
    "as we show , our approach allows for the reconstruction precision to be estimated , indicating the level of noise in the data , or possible mismatches in the knowledge of the interaction functions .",
    "we consider a network of @xmath0 nodes , described by their dynamical states @xmath1 .",
    "its time evolution is governed by : @xmath2 where the function @xmath3 represents the local dynamics for each node , and @xmath4 models the action of the node @xmath5 on other nodes .",
    "the network topology is encoded in the adjacency matrix @xmath6 , specifying the strength with which the node @xmath5 acts on the node @xmath7 .",
    "we assume that : ( _ i _ ) the interaction functions @xmath3 and @xmath8 are precisely known , and ( _ ii _ ) a discrete trajectory consisting of @xmath9 values @xmath10 is known for each node .",
    "the measurements of @xmath11 are separated by the uniform observation interval @xmath12 defining the time series resolution .",
    "we seek to reconstruct the unknown adjacency matrix @xmath13 under these two assumptions .",
    "the starting point is to define the following correlation matrices , using the observable @xmath14 whose role will be explained later : @xmath15 where @xmath16 denotes time - averaging @xmath17 . inserting into the eq.[eq-1 ] , we obtain the following linear relation between the correlation matrices : @xmath18 which is our main reconstruction equation , applicable to any network with dynamics given by eq.[eq-1 ] .",
    "time series are to be understood as the available observables , allowing for matrices in eq.[eq-2 ] to be computed for any @xmath19 . for the infinitely long dynamical data ,",
    "reconstruction is always correct for any generic @xmath19 . for short time",
    "series , representing experimentally realistic scenarios , the reconstruction is always approximate , and its precision crucially depends on the choice of @xmath19  , for which the subtraction of averages is not needed . ] .    to be able to quantify the reconstruction precision , we need to equip ourselves with the adequate measures . to differentiate from the original adjacency matrix @xmath20 , we term the reconstructed matrix @xmath21 , and express the matrix error as : @xmath22 of course , each @xmath23 is computed according to eq.[eq-3 ] in correspondence with the chosen @xmath19 .",
    "however , since the matrix @xmath20 is unknown , we have to introduce another precision measure , based only on the available data . a natural test for each @xmath23",
    "is to quantify how well does it reproduce the original data @xmath24 .",
    "we apply the following procedure : start the dynamics from @xmath25 and run it using @xmath23 until @xmath26 ; denote thus obtained values @xmath27 ; re - start the run from @xmath28 and run until @xmath29 , accordingly obtaining @xmath30 , and so on .",
    "the discrepancy between the reconstructed time series @xmath31 and the original @xmath24 is an explicit measure of the reconstruction precision , based solely on the available data .",
    "we name it trajectory error @xmath32 , and define it as follows : @xmath33 different choices of the observable @xmath19 lead to different @xmath23 , with different precisions expressed through errors @xmath32 and @xmath34 . as we show below",
    ", these two error measures are related , meaning that small @xmath32 suggests small @xmath34 .",
    "the function @xmath19 hence plays the role of a tunable parameter , which can be used to optimize the reconstruction . by considering many @xmath23-s obtained through varying @xmath19",
    ", we can single out @xmath23-s with the minimal @xmath32 to obtain the best reconstruction .      to illustrate the implementation of our method ,",
    "we begin by constructing a network with @xmath35 nodes by putting 17 directed links between randomly chosen node pairs . as our first example , we consider the hansel - sompolinsky model , describing the firing rates in neural populations  @xcite .",
    "it is defined by the interaction functions @xmath36 and @xmath37 which are fixed for all nodes .",
    "the adjacency matrix is specified by assigning positive and negative weights to the networks links , randomly chosen from @xmath38 $ ] , as shown in fig.[figure-1]a .",
    "for the first example ( a ) , and the second example ( b ) .",
    "colorbars ( shades ) indicate the interaction strength .",
    "two different colorbars in ( b ) stand for two different interaction types ( see text).,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    starting from random initial conditions , the resulting system is integrated from @xmath39 to @xmath40 . during the run",
    ", 20 values of @xmath11 are stored for each node , equally spaced with @xmath41 .",
    "the obtained time series , shown in fig.[figure-2 ] , are rather short compared to the characteristic time scale and the network size .",
    "a ( black dots ) .",
    "bars denote the added white noise of strength @xmath42 ( see text , cf .",
    "fig.[figure-5]a).,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    we now use these data to reconstruct the original adjacency matrix by employing the procedure described above .",
    "we consider a set of @xmath43 test - functions @xmath19 , each composed of first 10 fourier harmonics @xmath44 \\ ; .\\ ] ] the coefficients @xmath45 and @xmath46 are randomly selected from @xmath47 $ ] with the log - uniform probability .",
    "this is implemented by selecting each fourier coefficient via @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is a random number between 0 and 1 .",
    "a typical function thus constructed for each choice of @xmath45 and @xmath46 will have all 10 fourier components , but one ( or at most few ) will be well pronounced .",
    "functions are then normalized to the range of time series values . given relatively smooth timeseries , lower harmonics are expected to generally extract more features from data , which is why we limit ourselves to the first 10 harmonics .",
    "to improve the stability of the derivative estimates , we base our calculations on the set of time points @xmath50 . for each @xmath19 , the matrix @xmath23 is obtained via eq.[eq-2 ] and eq.[eq-3 ] , with the invertibility of each @xmath51 checked by virtue of the singular value decomposition . the errors @xmath32 and @xmath34 are then calculated for each @xmath23 , and reported as a scatter plot in fig.[figure-3]a .     and",
    "@xmath34 , in relation with the first and second example , in ( a ) and ( b ) , respectively .",
    "best 1% of @xmath23-s with the minimal @xmath32 , are represented by the dots left of the vertical dashed line.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    the main result of this analysis is a clear correlation between @xmath32 and @xmath34 , particularly pronounced for smaller values of errors .",
    "this confirms that the best @xmath23 are among those that display minimal @xmath32 .",
    "in order to identify the best reconstruction and estimate its precision , we focus on the 1% of matrices @xmath23 with the minimal @xmath32 , as illustrated in fig.[figure-3]a by the dashed vertical line . the variability of @xmath23 within this group can be viewed as the reconstruction precision .",
    "small variability indicates the invariance of @xmath23 to the choice of @xmath19 , which suggests a good reconstruction",
    ". large variability of @xmath23 implies its drastic dependence on @xmath19 , indicating a bad precision .",
    "we quantify this by computing the mean and the standard deviation for each matrix element of @xmath23 within this group , and identify them , respectively , with the best reconstruction value and its precision . in fig.[figure-4]a",
    "we report the original @xmath20 and the best reconstruction , along with the respective errorbar for each matrix element , describing the reconstruction precision .",
    "the reconstruction is indeed very good for both zero and non - zero weights ( i.e. for non - linked and linked node pairs in the network ) .",
    "( circles ) , and the best reconstruction ( crosses ) , with the corresponding errorbars . first and second example in ( a ) and ( b ) , respectively.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    as our second example , we consider a dynamical model describing gene interactions , with the coupling functions of two types : activation @xmath52 and repression @xmath53  @xcite .",
    "local interaction are again modeled via @xmath54 .",
    "the adjacency matrix is based on the same network , and defined by assigning a random weight from @xmath55 $ ] for each link , as shown in fig.[figure-1]b .",
    "the nodes 1 - 3 ( respectively , 4 - 6 ) act activatorily ( repressively ) on all nodes that they act upon .",
    "again , we run the dynamics from @xmath39 to @xmath40 , obtaining another set of time series with 20 points ( not shown ) .",
    "the same reconstruction procedure is applied , yielding the @xmath32 vs. @xmath34 scatter plot shown in fig.[figure-3]b .",
    "using the same procedure , we obtain the best reconstruction and show it in fig.[figure-4]b .",
    "again , the precision is very good .",
    "note that our method thus applies also in cases of strongly non - linear interaction functions , which capture most real dynamical scenarios .      in order to model the real applicability of our method ,",
    "we test its robustness to possible violations of the initial assumptions , focusing on the first example ( fig.[figure-1]a ) .",
    "we start with the scenario when the interaction functions are not precisely known ",
    "we assume a small mismatch in their mathematical form ( _ model error _ ) . instead of the original @xmath36 and @xmath37 , we take @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "the measurements of @xmath32 now can not be expected to converge to zero .",
    "nevertheless , we apply the same procedure , and find ( a weaker ) correlation between @xmath32 and @xmath34 , as shown ( by black dots ) in fig.[figure-5]a . to see the worsening of the precision clearly , grey dots show the original non - perturbed scatter plot from fig.[figure-3]a . dashed",
    "vertical line shows the part of the error @xmath32 which is unavoidable due to the presence of the perturbation . we compute it as the difference between the original and the perturbed interaction functions , averaged over the range of time series .",
    "we isolate this part of the trajectory error , since it is not due to the properties of our method .",
    "its size indicates that the remaining part of the @xmath32 is similar to the @xmath32 occurring in the non - perturbed case .",
    "this demonstrates that our method works optimally even under perturbed conditions .",
    "the worsening of the reconstruction precision is what expected from the nature of the perturbation , meaning that our method makes no additional `` unexpected '' errors in the perturbed conditions .",
    "the best reconstruction and the corresponding errorbars are computed as before and shown in fig.[figure-6]a .",
    "the errorbars are larger and the reconstruction precision worsens .",
    "still , the essential fraction of elements of @xmath20 are within the respective errorbars .",
    "the decline of precision is controllable , since it is clearly signalized by the size of the errorbars .",
    "this could be used to generalize the method in the direction of detecting the interaction functions as well .",
    "each best @xmath23 would be accompanied by the best guesses for @xmath58 and @xmath8 , meaning that different network topologies , reproducing the data equally well , would come in combination with different @xmath58 and @xmath8 .     and",
    "@xmath34 ( black dots ) , for the model error scenario in ( a ) and the observation error scenario in ( b ) .",
    "original non - perturbed scatter plot from fig.[figure-3]a is shown in gray for comparison .",
    "vertical dashed lines depicts the part of the @xmath32 error which is unavoidable in the presence of the perturbation ( see text).,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    to test the second assumption of our theory , we take the time series to be not precisely known due to _",
    "observation errors_. uncorrelated white noise of intensity @xmath42 is added , perturbing each value of the time series . instead of the original data , we now consider one realization of the noisy data , as illustrated in fig.[figure-2 ] ( interaction functions are the original ones ) .",
    "the central problem now is the computation of the derivatives , which are extremely sensitive to the noise .",
    "we employ the savitzky - golay smoothing filter  @xcite as a standard technique of data de - noising , which allows for a good derivative estimation .",
    "since the time series are short , we apply the smallest smoothing parameters . the reconstruction procedure is applied as before , using smoothed derivatives to compute matrix @xmath59 in eq.[eq-2 ] .",
    "the scatter plot of @xmath32 vs @xmath34 is shown in fig.[figure-5]b , again compared with the original plot , and with the perturbation - induced unavoidable error indicated by the vertical line .",
    "the worsening of the precision is of a similar magnitude as in the model error scenario .",
    "the best reconstruction and the corresponding errorbars are reported in fig.[figure-6]b .",
    "note that the precision is again correctly reflected by the size of the errorbars . in two cases from fig.[figure-6 ]",
    ", the precision does not decline uniformly for all links .",
    "the analysis above shows that our reconstruction method is reasonably robust to both model and observation error .",
    "we found this robustness to be qualitatively independent of the realization of both these errors .",
    "( circles ) , and the best reconstruction ( crosses ) , with the corresponding errorbars ( first example ) .",
    "model error and observation error scenarios in ( a ) and ( b ) , respectively.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]",
    "we presented a method of reconstructing the topology of a general network from the dynamical time series with known interaction functions . through",
    "conceptually novel approach , our method is formulated as an inverse problem using linear systems formalism  @xcite . rather than relying on the correlations between the observed variables , it is based on the correlations between the variables and their time derivatives .",
    "our method involves two important factors : it applies to the data that is relatively short , i.e. of the length comparable to the network size and to the characteristic time scale ; and , it yields the errorbars as a by - product , correctly reflecting the reconstruction precision .",
    "on the other hand , our theory relies on knowing ( at least approximately ) both the dynamical model eq.[eq-1 ] and the interaction functions .",
    "while these assumptions might limit the immediate applicability of our method , our idea presents a conceptual novelty , potentially leading towards a more general and applicable reconstruction method .",
    "for example , we expect applicability in studies of interacting neurons in slices or cultures , where the properties of the individual neurons ( i.e. functions @xmath60 and @xmath61 ) can be relatively well established , while the adjacency matrix is unknown .",
    "in contrast , the application to problems such as brain fmri activity patterns , where even the existence of a dynamical model like eq.[eq-1 ] is questionable , appears at present not possible .",
    "our theory includes choosing the tunable observables @xmath19 , which allow for the reconstruction to be optimized within the constrains of any given data .",
    "the question of constructing the optimal @xmath19 which extracts the _ maximal _",
    "extractable information , remains open .",
    "our algorithm can be reiterated : once the 1% of the best @xmath23-s are found , one can examine the functions @xmath19 leading to those 1% , and repeat the procedure , sampling only the neighboring portion of the functional space .",
    "alternatively , various evolutionary optimization algorithms could be used  @xcite . an important factor for the method",
    "s applicability is the dynamical regime behind the time series , which could be regular ( periodic ) or chaotic ( transiental ) .",
    "the former case is less reconstructible , because of a poor coverage of the phase space . in particular , the synchronized dynamics , being essentially non - sensitive to the variations of the coupling coefficients , offers very little insight into the structure of the underlying network .",
    "increasing the time series length is obviously of no help  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the latter case contains more network information , and is potentially more reconstructible .",
    "another issue is the applicability to large networks @xmath62 , and in particular , the dependence of precision on relationship between @xmath0 and @xmath9 .",
    "this relates to the possibility of quantifying the network information content of the available data .",
    "relevant here is also the performance of our method for varying types of network topologies ( random , scalefree etc . ) .",
    "this is a matter of ongoing research to be reported elsewhere .",
    "another limitation of our theory comes from the form of eq.[eq-1 ] .",
    "a similar theory could be developed for alternative scenarios , such as @xmath61 specified by both source and target nodes .",
    "the real challenge here are the networks with non - additive inter - node coupling ( i.e. , the dynamical contribution to the node @xmath7 is not a mere sum of neighbours inputs ) .",
    "the key practical problem is that the mathematical forms of @xmath60 and @xmath61 are not ( precisely ) known for many real networks , although for certain systems they can be inferred with a reasonable confidence  @xcite .",
    "noise always hinders the reconstruction , specially via derivative estimates .",
    "however , longer time series not only bring more information , but also allow for a better usage of smoothing .",
    "finally , we note that the network reconstruction problem is opposite of the network design problem .",
    "our method could be employed to design a network that displays given dynamics .",
    "however , while any network with @xmath63 solves the design problem , in the reconstruction theory this creates the permanent issue of isolating the true network among those that exhibit @xmath64 .",
