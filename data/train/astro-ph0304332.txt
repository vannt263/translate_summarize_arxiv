    "with the launch of the x - ray satellites _ chandra _  ( weisskopf et  al .  2002 ) and _ xmm - newton _  ( jansen et  al .",
    "2001 ; den herder et  al .",
    "2001 ) , high - resolution x - ray spectroscopy of diverse astrophysical objects has now become routine .",
    "x - rays , due to their origin in extreme astrophysical environments as well as their significant penetrating ability , can potentially provide a wealth of information about these sources .",
    "their penetration power , in particular , implies that x - ray emitting plasmas are often optically thin . in such cases ,",
    "complicated radiative transfer is negligible , allowing for particularly simple astrophysical models .",
    "there are two main types of x - ray line - emitting plasmas : ( 1 ) hot plasmas , which are mechanically heated through collisions and therefore have temperatures comparable to the observed line energies , and which produce x - ray line emission predominantly through radiative decay following electron impact excitation ( hereafter , `` collision - driven '' ) , and ( 2 ) photoionized plasmas , which are irradiated by a powerful external source and have subsequently lower temperatures consistent with photon heating ( including both photoelectric and compton heating ) , and which produce x - ray line emission through recombination / radiative cascade following photoionization , and radiative decay following photoexcitation ( hereafter , `` radiation - driven '' or `` photoionized '' ) .",
    "hot plasmas are produced in the coronae of stars ( including the sun ) , in shock - heated environments ( such as supernovae , cataclysmic variables , and stellar winds of early - type stars ) , and in the intracluster media of clusters of galaxies .",
    "photoionized plasmas have recently been unambiguously confirmed in x - ray binaries ( liedahl & paerels 1996 , cottam et  al .",
    "2001 ) , agn  outflows ( sako et  al .",
    "2000 , kinkhabwala et  al .  2002 ) , cataclysmic variables ( mukai et  al .",
    "2003 ) , and even in the stellar wind of the wr+o binary @xmath0 velorum ( dumm et  al .",
    "hybrid plasmas , in which both collision - driven and radiation - driven processes are important , can also exist .",
    "so far , hybrid x - ray - line - emitting plasmas have not yet been unambiguously detected in any astrophysical source , but they are expected to play an important role in accretion disks , for example , which are strongly irradiated ( implying radiation - driven processes are important ) but also have high densities ( implying collision - driven processes are important as well ) . finally , we note that the mechanisms driving x - ray emission ( either collision - driven or radiation - driven ) in the two vastly different regimes of gamma - ray - burst ( grb ) afterglows and the intergalactic medium ( igm ) are still largely unknown .",
    "grb afterglows may harbor hot plasmas produced through shocks and/or photoionized plasmas located in the ejecta or surrounding interstellar medium and powered by radiation from the burst and afterglow radiation . similarly",
    ", the igm may harbor hot plasmas from shocks due to structure formation and/or photoionized plasmas powered by radiation from active galactic nuclei ( agn ) or starbursts .",
    "calculations of x - ray line emission from hot , collision - driven plasmas have been discussed in great detail by several authors , including raymond & smith ( 1977 ) , mewe , gronenschild , & van den ooord ( 1985 ) , mewe , lemen , & van den oord ( 1986 ) , kaastra ( 1992 ) , liedahl , osterheld , & goldstein ( 1995 ) , and smith et  al .",
    "discussions of line formation in x - ray photoionized plasmas have also been presented by several authors , including tarter , tucker , & salpeter ( 1969 ) , halpern & grindlay ( 1980 ) , krolik , mckee , & tarter ( 1981 ) , kallman & mccray ( 1982 ) , netzer ( 1993 ) , kallman et  al .",
    "( 1996 ) , and liedahl ( 1999 ) ; however , spectral predictions made in these works have not yet been compared in detail with real astrophysical x - ray spectra .",
    "in contrast , the assumptions and calculations we describe here for photoionized plasmas were made and tested in the process of analyzing high - resolution x - ray spectra from various astrophysical sources .",
    "below , we present atomic structure and transition calculations using the publicly - available atomic code fac  ( gu 2002 ; gu 2003 ) for all ionic transitions relevant for the x - ray regime .",
    "atomic data values for some especially important transitions ( in particular , more accurate wavelengths ) and for some photoelectric edges are taken from other atomic databases , as will be described below . using these data ,",
    "we have fully characterized all significant line and edge absorption from the full range of included ions .",
    "we have also fully characterized the x - ray spectral emission features for radiative recombination forming the important h - like and he - like ions , as well as both radiative and dielectronic recombination forming l - shell ions .    in order to attempt to explain real astrophysical spectra from photoionized plasmas , we have created a simple model of a cone of ions irradiated by a source located at its tip .",
    "photoionization in the cone is balanced by recombination / radiative cascade and photoexcitation is balanced by radiative decay .",
    "this model has been incorporated into xspec  ( arnaud 1996 ) as the additive model photoion .",
    "for convenience , we have also created the abbreviated additive model phsi for a single ion , and the multiplicative models mpabs ( multi - ion absorption ) and siabs ( single - ion absorption ) for pure absorption studies .",
    "our calculations invoke the following basic assumptions : ( 1 ) all ions are in their ground states .",
    "x - ray transitions are generally much faster than the relevant rates for radiation - driven and collision - driven processes , making this typically a safe assumption .",
    "( 2 ) collisional excitation and collisional ionization are negligible .",
    "due to the low temperatures and densities of photoionized plasmas , these processes are typically insignificant for driving x - ray transitions .",
    "( 3 ) we assume the entire medium is in a global steady state .",
    "( note that we do not require the more restrictive assumption of _ local _ steady state conditions everywhere in the medium . ) furthermore , for the medium as a whole , we assume the total ionization rate equals the total recombination rate between all _ neighboring _ charge states .",
    "( 4 ) all relative ion ratios are constant throughout the medium . or , more approximately , all ion ratios are constant over regions with size comparable to the continuum optical - depth length scale ( defined as the length over which the continuum is reduced by a few or more percent ) . for a mildly - absorbed medium ,",
    "this length scale is equal to the entire medium , and this assumption is trivially valid .",
    "interestingly , recent observations of the prototypical seyfert  2 galaxy , ngc  1068 , show that an inherent , relatively scale - free density distribution ( over a few orders of magnitude ) at each radius is more important than the radial distribution in setting the range in ionization parameter ( brinkman et  al .",
    "2002 ; ogle et  al .",
    "2003 ) , suggesting that even in moderately or highly absorbed media this approximation may still be valid .",
    "( 5 ) the irradiated medium can be modeled as a relatively narrow isotropic cone with the source of radiation located at its tip .",
    "this cone is completely specified by its opening angle , ionic column densities , representative ionic recombination temperatures , and a simple velocity structure , characterized by a global radial velocity shift and gaussian width , and a global transverse ( perpendicular to the cone ) velocity shift and gaussian width .",
    "( 6 ) the emitting plasmas are optically thin to their own emission . because x - ray radiative cross - sections are generally weaker than longer wavelength cross - sections ( e.g. , in the uv or optical ) , a given medium remains optically thin to x - rays out to significantly higher column densities .",
    "furthermore , in the context of our assumption of a _ narrow _ cone geometry , even with large radial ionic column densities and corresponding radial optical depth , the transverse optical depth is smaller than the radial optical depth by roughly the length - to - width ratio of the cone .",
    "observationally , optical thinness has been demonstrated for the line emitting regions of ngc  1068 using a simple line conversion diagnostic ( see kinkhabwala et  al .",
    "2002 and  [ sec : reemission ] below ) .",
    "our paper is organized as follows .",
    "starting from the most general ionic rate equations in  [ sec : master ] , we describe how the above assumptions are employed to simplify these equations for generic astrophysical plasmas in  [ sec : simp ] and then for purely radiation - driven plasmas in  [ sec : rad ] . here",
    ", we also describe our calculations of important diagnostics for h- and he - like ion emission , as well as the specifics of all of our atomic calculations with fac . in order to explain real astrophysical spectra",
    ", we present our model of a cone of ions irradiated by a point source located at its tip in  [ sec : cone ] , obtaining the final expression for the rate equations , which serve as the basis for photoion . in  [ sec : examples ] , we provide examples of the capabilities of photoion .",
    "finally , in  [ sec : dis ] , we discuss our results .",
    "presented below is a completely general analysis of the ionic rate equations for astrophysical plasmas ( including all possible collision - driven and radiation - driven processes ) .",
    "this analysis is undertaken for two reasons .",
    "first , we are unaware of any similarly general analysis in the literature and hope to motivate studies along similar lines . and , second , this analysis most clearly brings out all the assumptions that are made in the formulation of our final rate equations for a radiation - driven medium .    an extremely general form for the rate equation pertaining to population / depletion of ions @xmath1 of element @xmath2 ( atomic number ) with @xmath3 electrons in atomic level @xmath4 and immersed in a generic gas or plasma",

    "because only one element at a time is concerned , we have dropped the atomic number @xmath2 in the ion density subscripts on the rhs of the equation for conciseness , i.e. , @xmath6 .",
    "the full time derivative on the lhs can be written as the usual convective derivative : @xmath7 , which allows for the possibility of bulk motion ( e.g. , due to agn  outflow or stellar wind ) .",
    "equation  [ eq : master ] includes all radiation - driven and collision - driven processes , i.e. , all plausibly significant interactions with photons , electrons , ions , molecules , and dust grains and all possible excited - state decays .",
    "it therefore provides a good starting point for examination of most astrophysical plasmas , excluding only plasmas where coherent quantum effects are important , such as extremely - high - density plasmas ( e.g. , neutron star atmospheres ) or coherent emission from masers or lasers ( discussed further in the next paragraph ) .",
    "the notation is as follows : @xmath8 ( radiative decay rate ) , @xmath9 ( `` collision - driven '' coefficients ) , @xmath10 ( `` radiation - driven '' coefficients ) , @xmath11 ( autoionization rate ) , @xmath12 ( grain / molecule spontaneous disintegration rate ) , and parentheses ( implying notation refers to all @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 terms contained within ) , with the initial level as subscript and the final level as superscript for a particular transition between members of the ionic series ( _ a la _ einstein 1917 ) .",
    "for example , @xmath13 implies a transition from a @xmath3-like ion ( e.g. , @xmath14 for a he - like ion ) in level @xmath4 to a @xmath15-like ion in level @xmath16 .",
    "@xmath17 refers to the set of products of all collision - driven rate coefficients times their corresponding population densities @xmath18 for interactions with ions , molecules , and dust grains ( _ not _ including electrons ) .",
    "the right hand side , term - by - term , corresponds to @xmath19-body recombination @xmath20 ( usually only two - body recombination is important , though three - body recombination ",
    "i.e. , two electrons and one ion  is significant at high densities ) , charge transfer @xmath20 , ionization @xmath21 , excitation / deexcitation / spontaneous decay @xmath22 , excitation / deexcitation / spontaneous decay @xmath23 , @xmath19-body recombination @xmath24 , charge transfer @xmath24 , ionization @xmath25 , molecule / grain destruction @xmath26 , molecule creation / grain adsorption @xmath27 , and molecule / grain spontaneous disintegration @xmath26 . a similar rate equation to eq .",
    "[ eq : master ] but for molecules or grains is straightforward to write down as well . in light of the simplistic approach and corresponding assumptions adopted in this paper",
    ", we do not investigate the coupling of eq .",
    "[ eq : master ] with any force laws , electrodynamic equations , or thermodynamic relations .",
    "the particular process of photoexcitation requires further elaboration . for photon - atom interactions near an atomic resonance ( bound - bound )",
    ", there are two possible regimes .",
    "one is the `` classical '' damped - oscillator regime ( wigner & weisskopf 1930 ; weisskopf 1931 ) , in which it is possible to separately consider the quantum processes of absorption ( photoexcitation ) and reemission driven by spontaneous decay .",
    "this entire process can be thought of as `` inelastic scattering . ''",
    "we have implicitly assumed this regime in our presentation of the ionic rate equations .",
    "the alternate regime is resonance scattering , in which these two processes can not be separated out , and which always produces an outgoing photon with energy equal to the incident photon in the center - of - momentum frame ( `` elastic scattering '' ) . to determine which is the valid regime requires consideration of the interaction timescale with the incident radiation field and the relative strength of the transition",
    "incident monochromatic light ( formally infinite interaction time ) yields energy - preserving resonance scattering for any transition strength .",
    "however , the continuous spectrum ( short interaction time ) or even absorbed power - law spectrum typical of photoionizing radiation and the predominance of absorption by relatively strong transitions appears to validate the `` classical '' regime ( e.g. , sakurai 1967 ) .",
    "observationally , the difference between the `` classical '' and resonance - scattering regimes is significant only in the details of the emission line profiles and in the expected degradation of higher - transition - energy photons to lower - transition - energy photons in the `` classical '' regime .",
    "the @xmath9 coefficients refer to all collision - driven processes , i.e. , all processes driven by collisions of the particle of interest ( usually an ion ) with a secondary particle ( usually a free electron ) .",

    "the @xmath10 coefficients refer to all radiation - driven processes , i.e. , all processes driven by the local radiation field .",
    "these coefficients depend solely on the spectrum of the local radiation field and the given interaction cross section .",

    "the photon flux spectrum at position @xmath42 is @xmath43 ( e.g. , with in units of photons @xmath44 s@xmath45 kev@xmath45 ; throughout this paper all luminosities and fluxes will be expressed in photon units , _ not _ the usual energy units )",
    ". the photon flux spectrum may include radiation from a source external to the emission region as well as any other sources of radiation produced in the photoionized plasma itself .",
    "the total radiative cross section for transition @xmath34 is given by @xmath46_a^b(e,\\vec{r})$ ] , which is already convolved with the local velocity distribution function at @xmath42 of the particle population under consideration .",
    "most of the calculational complexity of generic plasmas is reflected in @xmath43 , which , through radiative transfer , is coupled to the density and velocity distributions ( thermal or non - thermal ) of all interacting particles .",
    "however , for the special case of optically thin plasmas , radiative transfer is negligible , simplifying calculations enormously ( as is demonstrated below ) .",
    "we now make two assumptions valid for many typical astrophysical plasmas : ( 1 ) the only important collisional interactions involve an ion with a single free electron , and ( 2 ) radiation - driven and collision - driven ionizations remove only one electron ( this does _ not _ include subsequent electron ejection through autoionization , which is retained in the @xmath11 coefficients ) .",

    "there are only a few processes which contribute significantly .",
    "these are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : grotrian ] and explained below .",
    "the most important collision - driven process is recombination , including both radiative and dielectronic recombination .",
    "we presently discuss only radiative recombination . using the principle of detailed balance embodied in the milne relation ( milne 1924 )",
    ", the radiative recombination cross section for electrons at temperature @xmath39 can be related to the photoionization cross section : @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the electron kinetic energy , @xmath56 is the threshold photonionizing photon energy , @xmath57 is the photon energy , and the @xmath58 are the ionic level degeneracies . combining eq .",
    "[ eq : rrsigma ] with eq .",
    "[ eq : collcoeff ] allows for calculation of the radiative recombination coefficients .",
    "the two most important radiation - driven processes are photoexcitation and photoionization . for the photoexcitation cross section , convolution of a line profile with the velocity distribution",
    "simply yields the voigt profile ( voigt 1912 ) : @xmath59 where @xmath60 and @xmath61 is the voigt function with @xmath62 ( where @xmath8 denotes the sum of all radiative and autoionizing decay rates from level @xmath4 ) and @xmath63 .",
    "the voigt profile is used for both absorption and reemission line profiles ( though with the possibility of different velocity distributions due to differing bulk motion distributions ) .",
    "the photoionization cross section @xmath64 is calculated explicitly by fac .",
    "we convolve the photoionization cross section with the same @xmath65 used above for the photoexcitation cross section .",
    "the total cross section for photoionization and photoexcitation is taken to be a sum of the individual cross sections .",
    "for photoexcitation , this simply means that we consider each transition ( oscillator ) decoupled from all other transitions ( oscillators ) : a more accurate treatment would use the full kramers - heisenberg - like cross section with appropriate radiation damping ( e.g. , sakurai 1967 ) , but this level of accuracy is rarely , if ever , needed for astrophysical sources .",
    "the continuous and discrete line cross sections can therefore be taken one by one in eq .",
    "[ eq : radcoeff ] to calculate all of the necessary photoionization / photoexcitation coefficients . finally , we note that photoexcitation and photoionization ( as well as dielectronic recombination ) can sometimes place electrons in levels capable of autoionization , as is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : grotrian ] .      returning to the ionic rate equations given in eqs .",
    "[ eq : intgeng ] and [ eq : intgeni ] , we now make two modifications . first , introducing a powerful simplification , we assume that all ionic excited levels are short - lived compared to the relevant radiation - driven and collision - driven excitation / ionization timescales .",
