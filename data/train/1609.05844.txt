    "rotating neutron stars are today known to be accompanied by pulsed non - thermal high- and very high energy ( vhe ) gamma - ray emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "while these observations point to the presence of highly energetic charged particles in the pulsar environment , the origin of these particles is still an open question ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "according to the standard theory of pulsars , primary particles are uprooted from the star s surface by means of strong longitudinal ( along the magnetic field line ) electrostatic fields @xcite and efficiently accelerated in a region between the surface and the light cylinder ( lc ) area ( a hypothetical zone where the linear velocity of rotation matches the speed of light ) . in order to produce vhe emission up to tev energies , as e.g. seen in the case of the crab pulsar , electrons would need to achieve high lorentz factors of the order of @xmath2 .",
    "it is still not known which mechanism of acceleration is responsible for that and where in the magnetosphere this process may take place . in the framework of e.g. polar cap models longitudinal electrostatic fields",
    "are presumed to allow significant particle acceleration along open magnetic field lines close to the neutron star ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , the acceleration efficiency is usually found to be too strongly limited by curvature and/or inverse compton radiation processes @xcite in order to account for the production of tev particles . to overcome these difficulties , alternative ( so - called outer gap ) models might be invoked ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where particles are accelerated in the outer parts of the magnetosphere . yet the anticipated radiation reaction forces along with the relatively short gap sizes still impose severe constraints on maximum attainable particle energies .",
    "a number of different approaches have been considered to improve on these problems .",
    "@xcite for example , have examined the intermediate formation of an electron - positron bound state that could possibly prevent an early screening of the gap electric field .",
    "@xcite , on the other hand , have extended the pulsar s electrodynamics by taking into account general relativistic effects . although these mechanisms allowed to slightly increase the gap size and thus led to more energetic particles , the corresponding energies are still not high enough when put in the context of recent vhe observations .    in general ,",
    "the pulsar magnetosphere is characterized by extremely strong magnetic fields , which in the case of the crab pulsar are believed to be of the order of @xmath3 g close to star s surface .",
    "this in turn means that charged particles very efficiently emit synchrotron radiation with an associated cooling timescale @xmath4 ( where @xmath5 , @xmath6 is the electron s lorentz factor and mass , respectively , @xmath7 is the speed of light , @xmath8 is the single particle synchrotron power and @xmath9 is the electron s charge ) that is by many orders of magnitude smaller than the kinematic timescale @xmath10 , where @xmath10 is the rotation period , i.e. @xmath11 sec in the case of the crab pulsar ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "hence , charged particles injected into the magnetosphere will quickly transit to the ground landau level and start sliding along the magnetic field lines . as the field lines co - rotate with the star , the particle dynamics",
    "is then expected to be strongly influenced by the effects of centrifugal acceleration and the synchrotron losses do not impose constraints on the maximum attainable energies of particles .",
    "it is clear that these effects might be extremely efficient close to the lc zone . in the context of the crab ,",
    "the possible role of the centrifugal mechanism to generate the pulsar s emission has been examined by @xcite . in particular , he has argued that the co - rotation of plasma particles in the pulsar s magnetosphere could `` create '' an efficient energy transfer channel from the rotator into the kinetic energy of plasma particles .",
    "motivated by this , a simplified model of centrifugal acceleration was developed by @xcite , who considered a rectilinear rotating channel with a body , freely sliding inside it . in the framework of special relativity they showed for the first time that the incorporation of relativistic effects of rotation can lead to radial deceleration , which is at first sight a rather uncommon phenomenon , yet",
    "already known from general relativity @xcite .",
    "since then , centrifugal particle acceleration has been studied in a variety of contexts and used to e.g. , predict the location to frequency mapping in the case of multi - second pulsars @xcite or to analyse the origin of the variable high energy emission from the rotating jet base in active galactic nuclei ( agn ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the results illustrated amongst other the particular role of inverse compton scattering on the efficiency of centrifugal acceleration . in a direct application of centrifugal acceleration to crab - like pulsars we have shown that close to the lc area electrons could achieve lorentz factor up to @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "the analysis of different radiation processes suggested that inverse compton scattering in the crab pulsar s magnetosphere could lead to detectable pulsed vhe emission in the tev band .",
    "based on the mhd approximation , a detailed investigation of magneto - centrifugal acceleration of plasma bulk motion close to the light cylinder has been recently presented by @xcite , extending an earlier approach developed in @xcite .",
    "the results are of particular interest as they lead to very similar expectations in the case of the crab pulsar . in that approach",
    "the dynamics of the particles has been investigated for different 3dim - configuration of magnetic field lines and it was shown that close to the lc area particles can achieve extremely high lorentz factor following a scaling as previously employed .",
    "the aforementioned works are especially interesting in the context of the latest results by the magic collaboration reporting the detection of pulsed vhe emission up to 1.5 tev from the crab pulsar , the highest ever detected @xcite .",
    "the vhe pulse profiles revealed two narrow peaks p1 ( located at a phase close to @xmath13 ) and p2 ( located at a phase close to @xmath14 ) that appear synchronised with those seen by fermi - lat in the gev domain .",
    "their detection significance ( in @xmath15h of data ) is different , though , with only p2 being significantly detected ( @xmath16 ) at energies above @xmath17 gev .",
    "the phase - folded pulse spectra are compatible with power - law functions over a range of @xmath18 gev up to @xmath0 tev , with photon indices @xmath19 ( for p1 ) and @xmath20 ( for p2 ) , and tev flux levels @xmath21 @xmath22 tev @xmath23s@xmath24 ( p1 ) and @xmath25 tev @xmath23s@xmath24 ( p2 ) , respectively",
    ". it is worth noting that this is the first clear detection of a pulsed emission component from the crab in the tev regime .",
    "unpulsed ( steady ) tev emission , attributed to its nebula , has been detected quite some time ago ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) whereas early evidence for pulsed gamma - ray emission ( above a few tens of gev ) has been related to an inverse compton ( ic ) origin in the pulsar wind zone some tens of light cylinder radii away @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we reconsider the role of the magneto - centrifugal acceleration for the crab pulsar in the light of the latest vhe findings , applying and extending results previously obtained @xcite .",
    "we show that the agreement with observations is successfully close to encourage further modelling .",
    "the paper is organized in the following way . in section  ii ,",
    "basic results of centrifugal acceleration are recaptured and discussed .",
    "section  iii then presents an application to the crab pulsar , while conclusions are summarised in section  iv .",
    "in this section we consider the dynamics of centrifugally accelerated particles close to the lc surface . as noted above , synchrotron losses will ensure that a charge particle quickly transits to the ground landau level and starts to slide along the field line . under such conditions",
    "it can be shown that the lagrangian of a single relativistic massive particle ( with rest mass @xmath6 ) moving along a co - rotating field line located in the equatorial plane can be written as @xcite @xmath26 where ( @xmath27 ) , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are respectively the radial and tangential components of velocity , @xmath30 is the pulsar s angular velocity of rotation , and @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the corresponding components of the magnetic field , respectively . since the lagrangian is not explicitly time - dependent , the related hamiltonian @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the generalized momentum , is a constant of motion ( noether s theorem ) . using eq .",
    "( [ l ] ) one finds @xmath35 accordingly , in the presence of a dominant radial field , the radial behaviour of the lorentz factor for a particle injected at @xmath36 with initial lorentz factor @xmath37 becomes @xcite @xmath38 where @xmath39 denotes the light cylinder radius .",
    "a charged particle following the field will thus dramatically increase its lorentz factor upon approaching the light cylinder ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "using eq .",
    "( [ gr ] ) and the general definition of @xmath5 , the characteristic acceleration timescale can be expressed as @xmath41    in principle , the lorentz factor dependence , eq .",
    "( [ gr ] ) , can also be obtained within the fluid dynamical framework of the mhd approximation . as shown recently by @xcite , the relativistic dynamics of particles following a rotating field line with a general 3d - shape in a plasma satisfying the",
    "frozen - in condition obeys the equation @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the dimensionless radial coordinate , @xmath44 is the total particle velocity , @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the unit vectors along the radial coordinate and along the direction of the magnetic field line , respectively , @xmath47 is the angle between @xmath45 and @xmath48 , @xmath48 is the unit tangential vector , @xmath49 is the drift velocity and @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the electric and magnetic field vectors , respectively . as discussed by @xcite , on approaching the lc ( @xmath52 ) the second term of the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ b1 ] ) remains finite , while the first term diverges .",
    "therefore , the aforementioned equation reduces to @xmath53 which no longer depends on the concrete shape of the field line ( as long as it is positively twisted ) and has the solution expressed in eq .",
    "( [ gr ] ) . identifying possible sites in numerical simulations and adopting parameters characteristic for the crab pulsar",
    ", @xcite found that lorentz factor up to @xmath54 ( at the alfvnic surface ) could be achieved by magnetocentrifugal acceleration .",
    "on crossing the light cylinder , magnetic field lines frozen into the plasma are generally expected to approach an archimedean spiral shape with the plasma flowing in it at constant lorentz factor , i.e. the archimedean spiral becomes an attractor @xcite .",
    "this compares well with the analysis of @xcite who , in an extension of the work by @xcite , examined curved rotating channels in the equatorial plane and studied the relativistic dynamics of a particle sliding inside this channel .",
    "as seen by a laboratory observer , the effective angular velocity of a particle can be written as @xcite @xmath55 where the shape of the channel is given in polar coordinates in terms of @xmath56 .",
    "on the other hand , since we observe plasma particles escaping the inner magnetosphere , the particle dynamics is expected to tend to the force - free regime . as a consequence the effective angular velocity has to vanish eventually and",
    "the particle s radial velocity should saturate .",
    "this in turn means that the physically interesting `` trajectories '' are those with @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is a constant .",
    "together with @xmath59 this explicitly defines the asymptotic velocity as @xmath60 obviously , if the initial velocity of the particle coincides with @xmath61 , its dynamics will be force - free from the very beginning .",
    "it seems interesting to study what happens if the initial velocities are different . for this purpose one can consider the metric tensor on the archimedean field lines @xcite @xmath62 where @xmath63 with indices @xmath64 and using @xmath65 .",
    "then , by introducing the lagrangian of a particle ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath66 one can see that @xmath67 is a cyclic parameter for which the associated conjugate momentum is conserved .",
    "therefore , one can show that the proper energy of the particle ( per unit rest mass ) given by @xmath68 is a conserved quantity .",
    "here we have employed the fact that based on the normalisation of the 4-velocity , the lorentz factor of the particle in terms of the radial velocity is given by @xmath69 .",
    "equation  ( [ ener ] ) then leads to the following relation for the radial velocity @xmath70}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] the characteristic behaviour of @xmath71 is shown for different initial conditions . for illustration and in order to facilitate a comparison with @xcite , a small ( asymptotic ) lorentz factor @xmath72 has been employed for the archimedean spiral . as can be seen , even if the particles are initially not in the force - free regime , they asymptotically tend to it .",
    "a similar investigation but for 3-dim geometry has been recently performed by @xcite .    in @xcite it has been argued that efficient magnetocentrifugal acceleration occurs close to the alfvnic region ( an area where the alfvnic velocity equals that of plasma particles ) . by estimating the corresponding distance in the case of the crab pulsar and using eq .",
    "( [ gr ] ) a maximum attainable value for the lorentz factor , @xmath73 has been inferred .",
    "as discussed in @xcite and considered in more detail in the following , the aforementioned value could in principle be slightly reduced by means of energy losses .",
    "in the envisaged scenario , centrifugal particle acceleration can occur as long as the inertia of the plasma particles does not counteract efficient co - rotation with the magnetic field .",
    "this is satisfied if the magnetic field energy density @xmath74 exceeds the plasma energy density , @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the goldreich - julian number density @xcite close to the star , i.e. the number density of primary particles , @xmath77 is the multiplicity factor @xcite and @xmath78 is the inclination angle between the axis of rotation and the magnetic dipole . for the crab pulsar one has @xmath79 sec , a nominal light cylinder scale @xmath80 cm , an effective radial distance @xmath81 and a surface magnetic field @xmath82 g. for a dipolar field approximation , the magnetic field then scales as @xmath83 g in the lc area . for these parameters ,",
    "the requirement of efficient co - rotation leads to a constraint on the maximum lorentz factor of @xmath84 where the initial injection lorentz factor has been normalized on @xmath85 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "it is generally assumed that the high energy emission is generated by particles sliding along open field lines . in the framework of the present model ,",
    "these field lines are almost straight in a sense that their curvature radius exceeds the nominal light cylinder radius . yet , in the laboratory frame of reference particles will almost rigidly rotate on the lc surface @xcite .",
    "therefore , curvature emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) could be of significance in limiting the maximum attainable energies . for lorentz factor of the order of @xmath86 the characteristic peak frequency , @xmath87 , with @xmath88 ,",
    "in the case of the crab pulsar becomes @xmath89 which corresponds to photon energies of the order of @xmath90 gev .",
    "hence curvature emission could in principle lead to a detectable , pulsed gev contribution .",
    "note that in principle some mild variation in curvature radii @xmath91 may occur that could be determined within a more detailed approach ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we may estimate achievable energies in the presence of curvature losses by equating the associated cooling time scale @xmath92 , where @xmath93 is the single particle curvature energy loss rate , i.e. @xmath94 with the acceleration timescale ( i.e. , eq .",
    "[ [ tacc ] ] with @xmath95 replaced by @xmath96 ) as applied to the crab pulsar , @xmath97 yielding maximum attainable lorentz factor @xmath98 where we have employed @xmath99 . since @xmath100 ,",
    "the relevant constraint is thus essentially imposed by the requirement of co - rotation and not by curvature losses . in the approach described here",
    ", efficient particle acceleration is thus taking place in the lc zone , the energisation being mediated by centrifugal effects and not magnetic field - aligned electric fields ( cf . also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in the considered framework ,",
    "the high energy radiation is generated in a thin shell of thickness @xmath101 close to the lc surface @xcite .",
    "for a quasi - monoenergetic particle distribution the total luminosity could be approximated by @xmath102 , where @xmath103 is the corresponding volume , @xmath104 is a dimensionless factor depending on the topology of magnetic field lines , @xmath105 is the azimuthal length scale involved in this process , @xmath106 is the corresponding angle , where @xmath107 is an approximate value for the pulse duration inferred from the light curve observed @xcite , and where we have taken into account that the pulsar emits in two channels . combining the noted values , the pulsed luminosity generated due to curvature emission at energy @xmath108 in the gev band would be of the order of @xmath109 the specific amount and the spectral shape will depend on the real ( space - energy ) distribution of particles and the range of curvature radii involved , and will need detailed modelling . given the magnitude of eq .",
    "( [ lc ] ) and the fact that the emission is expected to be significantly focused ( beamed ; see also below ) , curvature radiation is likely to be of prime relevance for understanding the origin of the @xmath5-ray emission as seen by fermi - lat @xcite .",
    "given the generic constraints for curvature emission ( e.g. , eq .  [ [ nuc ] ] ) , it is usually believed that inverse compton ( ic ) scattering is responsible for the vhe emission in millisecond pulsars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "to this , in principle a variety of soft photons fields could contribute , e.g. the thermal emission of the neutron star or secondary synchrotron emission . as shown in @xcite , in the centrifugal - type approach following @xcite",
    ", the contribution of the star s thermal photon field to the ic process becomes of relevance as the particle - soft photon interaction angle is not negligible but of order @xmath110 .",
    "for the crab pulsar , the surface temperature is of the order of @xmath111 k ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , corresponding to photon energies of @xmath112 kev .",
    "ic up - scattering of thermal photons to the vhe regime will thus occur in the klein - nishina regime .",
    "one could verify that the associated electron inverse compton losses will not impose further restrictions on the maximum attainable energies by recourse to the single particle emission power ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "( [ tacc ] ) , decreases as @xmath120 .",
    "the noted ic scattering is thus not expected to impose constraints on the acceleration efficiency .",
    "up - scattering of thermal photons could , however , lead to pulsed @xmath5-ray emission in the vhe domain as pointed out in @xcite .",
    "the scattered photons could well reach energies of the order of @xmath121 tev .",
    "the magic experiment has recently reported pulsed vhe emission with an energy flux level for the higher peak p2 of @xmath122tev @xmath23s@xmath24 in the interval @xmath123 $ ] gev @xcite , corresponding to an isotropic equivalent ( spectral ) luminosity of @xmath124 erg / s at a distance of @xmath125 kpc . in the considered framework ,",
    "this emission would be generated by relativistic particles with lorentz factors @xmath126 .",
    "we may again roughly estimate the possible order of magnitude for the spectral ic luminosity at @xmath127 tev expected in the centrifugal model by multiplying the single particle power @xmath128 , eq .",
    "( [ pkn ] ) , with the relevant particle number @xmath129 ( two channels ) to obtain @xmath130 one could use this expression to evaluate the degree of focusing and estimate a fiducial solid angle for the corresponding ic emission cone of @xmath131 sr if a dipolar field scaling @xmath132 close to the lc surface is employed . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] a sketch of the magnetospheric - centrifugal pulsar model is shown . following the approach developed by @xcite centrifugally accelerated particles in the lc zone have large azimuthal velocities and",
    "thus approximately emit along a tangent to the lc surface .",
    "it seems evident that in this approach the peaks in the light curves are in phase for all energy regimes that are rotationally produced sufficiently close to the lc area .    a priori",
    ", the radiating particle distribution is not expected to be mono - energetic , but instead to have some distribution in energy .",
    "this is a complicated issue and , amongst others , likely to be sensitive on the magnetic field topology , the injection spectrum and radiation reaction effects .",
    "nevertheless , one can still evaluate some simple characteristics : suppose electrons are injected ( by inner gap - type processes ) into the magnetosphere at a rate @xmath133 with some lorentz factor @xmath37 and centrifugally accelerated along a magnetic field line until co - rotation breaks down and they escape further acceleration by crossing the lc surface .",
    "then to first order , the differential particle density distribution @xmath134 along a field line in the steady state can be approximated by @xcite @xmath135 using that @xmath136 , eq .",

    "particles with higher @xmath5 are located closer to the lc surface and occupy a thinner shell of width @xmath137 , eq .",

    "it is likely that modifications in , for example , the magnetic field topology and a detailed treatment of the particle particle injection and transport , aberration and travel time effects will lead to some index variation around this main spectral value but full modelling would be required to infer its plausible range .",
    "the recent detection of pulsed vhe emission from the crab pulsar @xcite has opened new avenues in pulsar research .",
    "the apparent synchronisation of the pulse profile at gev and tev energies suggests a common property such as a very similar location of production , the transparency for @xmath5-ray photons hints to an outer magnetospheric region , while the expected ic origin points to the presence of very energetic particles with lorentz factors of at least @xmath149 .",
    "such characteristics are challenging to accommodate in traditional emission models . in the present paper",
    "we have argued that magneto - centrifugal particle acceleration may offer an interesting means to account for the noted characteristics . in this framework , efficient particle acceleration takes place in the vicinity of the light cylinder , with the high - energy @xmath5-ray emission related to curvature radiation and the vhe emission ( above some tens of gev ) generated by inverse compton ( ic ) upscattering in the klein - nishina regime .",

    "<S> the crab pulsar has been recently detected at very high energies ( vhe ) with its pulsed vhe emission reaching up to @xmath0 tev . </S>",
    "<S> the vhe peaks appear synchronised with the peaks at gev energies and show vhe spectra following hard power - law functions . </S>",
    "<S> these new findings have been interpreted as evidence for a gamma - ray production that happens very close to the light cylinder . </S>",
    "<S> motivated by these experimental results we consider the efficiency of magnetocentrifugal particle acceleration in the magnetosphere of the crab pulsar , reexamining and extending results obtained in a previous work @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that efficient magnetocentrifugal acceleration close to the light cylinder could provide the required electron lorentz factors of @xmath1 and that the resulting inverse compton ( ic ) scattering off thermal photons might explain the enigmatic tev emission of the pulsar . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate the corresponding vhe luminosity and provide a derivation of its spectral characteristics , that appear remarkably close to the observational results to encourage further studies .    </S>",
