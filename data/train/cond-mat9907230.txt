    "many important properties of superconductors are related to surfaces and interfaces , the josephson and proximity effects being well - known examples . in recent years",
    ", new rich surface physics has been found in high - t@xmath4 oxides after the identification of the d - symmetry of the order parameter . on the theoretical side , studying an interface poses certain problems : the method of the quasiclassical green s functions @xcite ( for a recent review see @xcite ) which is the main tool in the superconductivity theory , can not be directly applied here since the quasiclassical condition is violated by fast change of the potentials on the atomic distances in the vicinity of the interface . as shown by zaitsev @xcite",
    ", the abrupt changes at a specular partially transparent interface can be incorporated into a boundary condition for the quasiclassical green s functions ; the condition is a third order equation for the matrix green s function near the interface .",
    "various forms of the boundary condition have been discussed in more recent papers @xcite .",
    "new difficulties arise when one attempts to describe the coherent reflection / transmission by many interfaces , e.g. in a multi - layer mesoscopic structures or grain boundaries network in high - tc s . in this case",
    ", zaitsev s third order boundary condition must be satisfied on each interface , and one encounters the problem of solving a system of cubic matrix equations .",
    "it is not obvious that a solution to the system of equations exists and is unique if it exists .",
    "moreover , some authors @xcite doubt the very applicability of the quasiclassical scheme in the many interface geometry : they argue that the quasiclassical normalization , which is a vital part of the quasiclassical scheme , is not possible in a double layer system with partially reflective interface .    the purpose of the present paper is to re - examine the theory of the interface in the quasiclassical description of superconductivity . a new scheme which allows one to incorporate specular as well as diffusive interface(s ) into the quasiclassical theory",
    "is suggested . to make the presentation self - contained , we start with a short introduction to the quasiclassical theory of superconductivity .    as first shown by bardeen , cooper , and schrieffer ( bcs ) @xcite ,",
    "the phenomenon of superconductivity can be understood in the framework of a mean - field type scheme where the cooper correlations are introduced through the pair potential @xmath5 ( generally , a function of the momentum @xmath6 ) which is related to electron - electron interaction by a self - consistency condition . the mean field @xmath5 may be introduced directly as a kind of hartree - type potential , or it can be derived in the framework of a more sophisticated eliashberg theory where the pair potential comes as the anomalous self - energy in the gorkov equations for the green s function .",
    "this truly microscopic approach allows one to perform all the normalizations in the spirit of the landau theory of fermi liquid and to consider superconductors with a strong coupling ( see seren and rainer @xcite and references therein . )",
    "whatever the method of derivation , the gorkov equation for the matrix green s function gives the basis for studying the bcs - type superconductivity .",
    "the quasiclassical theory of superconductivity offers an approximate simplified scheme of solving the gorkov equation . to clarify physics behind the approximations ,",
    "we analyze first the bogoliubov - de gennes equation @xcite that is the effective `` schrdinger equation '' corresponding to the gorkov equation ( in the weak coupling limit ) .",
    "it is well  known that cooper s pairing in the superconducting state is conveniently described in the language of the electron - hole coherence . on the mean field level ,",
    "the ground as well as an excited states of the system are products of single particle states , each of them a quantum superposition of electron and hole .",
    "the electron , @xmath7 , and hole , @xmath8 , amplitudes in the superposition comprise the 2-component single particle wave function , @xmath9 .",
    "it obeys the bogoliubov - de gennes equation @xcite , @xmath10 where @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 being the electron band energy and the chemical potential , respectively , @xmath14 is the magnetic vector potential ; @xmath15 is the potential energy .",
    "the pairing potential @xmath16 , and , in principle , all other potentials must be found self - consistently .    for future needs",
    "we note that in the vicinity of the the fermi surface @xmath17 , the electron ( hole ) with the momentum @xmath18 moves with the fermi velocity @xmath19 .",
    "the particle energy is close to the fermi energy @xmath20 , and the de - broglie wave length is @xmath21 is of order of @xmath22 , @xmath23 being a typical momentum on the fermi surface .    in the superconductors which are good metals in the normal state , the potentials are semiclassical ( excluding interfaces and disorder which are discussed later ) _",
    "i.e. _ they are slowly varying functions of the coordinate on the scale of the wave length @xmath21 .",
    "indeed , the pair potential @xmath5 changes at the coherence length @xmath24 , and one estimates the ratio @xmath25 as @xmath26 . also , the validity of a semiclassical treatment of magnetic field @xmath27 requires that @xmath28 , @xmath29 being the magnetic length , @xmath30 .",
    "since superconductivity exists only at @xmath31 , the ratio @xmath32 never exceeds @xmath33 . seeing that @xmath34 , the semiclassical conditions @xmath35 are equivalent to the requirement that @xmath36 . in accordance with the landau theory of fermi liquid",
    ", this condition is always is satisfied if the normal state is metallic .",
    "most of the physical effects in metals and superconductors ( the hall and thermoelectric effects being notable exceptions ) can be described in the simplest approximation where all the corrections of order @xmath37 are neglected _ i.e. _ in the limit @xmath38 .",
    "this is the approximation where the quasiclassical theory of superconductivity is valid @xcite .",
    "since @xmath39 , the limit is equivalent to @xmath40 or large mass @xmath41 . in this limit of quantum mechanics of noninteracting particles , wave packets do not suffer quantum broadening and dynamics becomes completely classical : the particle moves along a trajectory , position @xmath42 and momentum @xmath43 being well defined .",
    "below we analyse how the electrons - hole coherence in the superconducting state changes the situation .",
    "first , we consider in more detail the classical dynamics of the electron and hole separately .",
    "the bogoliubov - de gennes equation where we put @xmath44 for the moment , reads @xmath45{\\psi_{e}}\\;\\ ; , \\;\\ ;   i \\hbar { \\partial { \\psi_{h}}\\over{\\partial t}}=   -\\left[\\xi \\left(\\hat{\\bbox{p}}+ e \\bbox{a}\\right ) +   u \\right]{\\psi_{h}}\\label{oka}\\ ] ] the two equations transform into each other after the substitution @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "this means that given a solution @xmath48 corresponding to the vector potential @xmath14 , the function latexmath:[${\\psi_{e}}(\\bbox{r},-t    the vector potential @xmath14 .",
    "therefore , @xmath50 provided @xmath51 @xcite .    if @xmath40 , the centre of electron or hole wave packets moves in the @xmath52 space along the trajectory specified by the coordinate @xmath53 and momentum @xmath54 as a function of time @xmath55 .",
    "the relation between electron- and hole - trajectories can be expressed in the following way .",
    "let @xmath56 together with @xmath57 be the trajectory of the electron ( hole ) in the magnetic field @xmath58 . from eq.([oma ] ) one can conclude that the corresponding classical dynamics of electrons and holes are related to each other in the following way : @xmath59 provided the electron and hole trajectories pass through the same point @xmath60 and @xmath61 at @xmath62 .",
    "one sees from here that if the magnetic field is absent , @xmath63 , or its influence on the classical dynamics is negligible , then @xmath64 that is the electron and hole move in opposite directions along the _ same _ line ( path ) in the @xmath52 space .",
    "however , to the extent the magnetic field influences the orbits , the electron and hole paths are _ different _ @xcite .",
    "( obviously , the role of the magnetic field may play any perturbation violating the time reversal symmetry . )",
    "now we are in position to analyse how the electron - hole mixing ( _ i.e. _ @xmath65 in eq.([ooa ] ) ) changes propagation of the wave packets .",
    "consider a wave packet which is initially purely electronic ( @xmath66 ) , and assume for the moment that eq.([orc ] ) is valid .",
    "the electron moves classically on a trajectory in the @xmath52 space , and provides a source , @xmath67 , in the equation for @xmath8 ( see eq.([ooa ] ) ) generating a hole wave .",
    "since @xmath5 is a slowly varying field , the source @xmath68 and @xmath69 are peaked at the same point of the @xmath52 space .",
    "in other words , the hole is created at the point of the current position of the electron and with the instantaneous electron momentum .",
    "then , by virtue of eq.([orc ] ) , the secondary hole moves backwards along the path of the primary electron .",
    "in turn , the hole creates new electrons which move along the same path _ etc_. it is very important that the multiple processes of the electron - hole conversion keep the packet on a line in the @xmath52 space which is nothing but the classical trajectory .",
    "however , the width of the packet _ along _ the trajectory grows linearly in time @xmath70 ( at times @xmath71 ) due to the reverse of the velocity under the electron@xmath72hole conversion processes .",
    "one sees that , the wave packet in a superconductor experiences broadening even in the limit @xmath40 , and , therefore , a quantum description is unavoidable . nevertheless ,",
    "the notion of the classical trajectory as a line in the @xmath52 space remains meaningful because the quantum broadening occurs only along the line .",
    "ultimately , this important feature is due to the time reversal symmetry .",
    "it holds to the extent eq.([orc ] ) is accurate _",
    "i.e. _ when one can neglect the magnetic lorentz force in the classical dynamics .",
    "note the peculiar role of a magnetic field : the difference in the magnetic bending of electron and hole trajectories results in the broadening of the coherent electron - hole wave packet in the direction transverse to the classical trajectory . at energies @xmath73 where the electron and hole components have comparable weight ,",
    "the significance of the lorentz force can be estimated @xcite from the ratio @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the cyclotron frequency . since @xmath76",
    ", one can consistently neglect the lorentz since the quasiclassical theory is effectively a theory of infinitely heavy particles , @xmath77 as discussed before .",
    "it seems that in general case the lorentz force can be incorporated in a theory of superconductivity only by a full quantum approach ( see , however , kopnin s quasiclassical theory of the hall effect @xcite ) .",
    "sometimes , the magnetic broadening may turn out to be non - crucial , e.g. in a spatially homogeneous case , and then certain simplifications may be possible ( see e.g. @xcite ) .    a more formal and rigourous analysis of electron - hole coherence on classical trajectories can be done using a method first suggested by andreev @xcite .",
    "the stationary state wave function is written as @xmath78 where @xmath79 is a slowly varying function ( provided @xmath80 ) . plugging @xmath81 into the bogoliubov - de gennes equation eq.([ooa ] ) , and using the approximation @xmath82 where the small terms of order @xmath83 are neglected , one gets the andreev equation . rearranging terms ,",
    "the andreev equation may be written in the following form @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the velocity at the point @xmath86 of the fermi surface , @xmath87 denotes @xmath88 and for simplicity @xmath89 ( as it usually the case because of the efficient screening ) .",
    "the most important feature here is that the derivative @xmath90 couples the value of the wave function only on straight lines in the direction of the velocity @xmath85 ; the lines are the classical trajectories when @xmath89 @xcite . in this approximation ,",
    "the quantum coherence exists only along the classical trajectories without any coupling between neighbouring paths .",
    "these properties are in agreement with the qualitative picture of the wave packet spreading along the classical trajectory , discussed previously .",
    "one may call the envelope function @xmath91 in eq.([5db ] ) the wave function on the classical trajectory .    after this short review of the quasiclassical approximation ,",
    "our next step is to include the interface into the scheme . in this introductory part of the paper , we present main ideas using the language of the wave functions on classical trajectory ; a more general approach of 2-point trajectory green s function is presented in section [ green ] .",
    "the reflection / transmission on an isolated interface ( a specular one , to begin with ) mixes together semi - infinite pieces of classical trajectories ( see fig.[cross ] ) .",
    "each of the pieces is characterized by the fermi surface momentum @xmath86 , and the corresponding velocity is @xmath85 ; the arrows indicate the direction of the velocity . on pieces of trajectories 1 and 2",
    "the velocity is directed towards the interface , and we call them in - coming trajectories ( or channels ) ; correspondingly , 1 and 2 are outgoing ( pieces of ) trajectories . throughout the paper , the out - going `` channels '' , alias for `` trajectory '' ,",
    "are marked by `` prime '' .",
    "note that the in / out classification of the trajectories in accordance with the direction of the fermi surface velocity is unique but it is arbitrary because the electron and hole belonging to same channel have the opposite directions of their velocities .",
    "for instance , the electron coming to the interface on via e.g. the channel 2 ( see fig .",
    "[ cross ] ) may go away as the electron on trajectories 1 and 2 as well as a hole along nominally in - coming trajectory 1 .",
    "we will call `` knot '' the region inside of which scattering occurs and the pieces of the classical trajectories get `` tied '' together on the interface @xcite .",
    "usually the typical thickness of the interface region is of atomic scale , and only the wave function in the outer region is of interest .",
    "then , on the quasiclassical level of accuracy , the interface ( the knot ) can be described by the scattering matrix @xcite    in general , the knot may tie together arbitrary number , @xmath92 , of ballistic in - channel to the same number @xmath92 of the out - channels . for a specular interface , number of channels",
    "@xmath92 equals to 2 , and rough interfaces may be modelled by knots with @xmath93 .",
    "the waves generated by a source , e.g. on path 1 in fig.[cross ] , spread to all other paths 1 , 2 , and 2 coupled by the knot . in the presence of an interface ,",
    "the wave function on trajectory remains a valid concept if one interprets the notion of trajectory in a broader sense as a set of the points on all the ballistic paths coupled by the knot .",
    "for instance , in fig.[cross ] , one understands paths 1 , 2 , 1 , 2 as the parts of a single geometrical object , which we also call a `` trajectory '' .",
    "the spatial argument of the wave function will span the generalized trajectory .",
    "similar constructions are known in the literature : see , e.g. ref.@xcite where the schrdinger equation is solved on graphs ( networks ) .",
    "the case of many interfaces requires some preliminary remarks .",
    "consider as an example a two layer system fig.[loop1 ] . _ if _ the layers are of the same thickness and the reflections are exactly specular , the two outgoing path 1 and 2 meet together again on the upper knot , forming a loop _",
    "i.e. _ a pair of interfering paths .",
    "this causes a major difficulty for the quasiclassical theory : indeed , the envelope function @xmath94 obeying the andreev equation is introduced when the phase factor @xmath95 , @xmath96 being the distance along the path , is singled out of the full wave function .",
    "when loops are present and there is more than one path connecting any 2 points , the distance @xmath97 is ill - defined , and the procedure of constructing the envelope @xmath94 becomes non - unique and dubious . besides , the interference phase factors like @xmath98 , @xmath99 being the lengths of the interfering paths , crucially sensitive to the value of @xmath23 and can not be found in the quasiclassical limit where @xmath100 .    to overcome the difficulty we note the following : the interference leads to fabri - perot type geometric resonances and related fluctuations of various physical quantities , perhaps locally strong .",
    "however , in the limit @xmath40 , the resonances are _ close _ to each other in the configuration space , and , therefore , the fluctuations are expected to be effectively averaged out when one calculates observables : the latter are given by certain integrals and thus are sensitive mainly to coarse - grain features in the configuration space .",
    "further , the coarse - grain features ( like e.g. the angular - resolved local density of states averaged in small volume ( @xmath101 ) ) or small interval of directions ) are more than likely not perceptive to small variations of geometry shifting the positions of the resonances .",
    "hence , it seems plausible to assume that the coarse - grain structure can be faithfully reproduced if one introduces `` virtual roughness '' , which is small ( @xmath102 ) and not noticeable quasiclassically , and performs averaging with respect to the roughness ( kind of ergodic hypothesis ) . in other words , on the course - grain level , an ideal surface is expected to be indistinguishable from a `` virtually rough '' _ i.e. _ a random surface with roughness @xmath103 ( see fig.[loop2 ] ) small on the typical quasiclassical scale , @xmath104 .    for a rough surface , the picture of trajectories shown in fig.[loop1 ] _",
    "almost _ never occurs : in the quasiclassical approximation , the trajectories are lines with zero ( @xmath105 ) width , and the condition that the trajectories 1 and 2 cross each other again exactly at the interface ( up to @xmath105 ) , is very restrictive . for this , the surfaces must be strictly parallel and the reflections 1@xmath106 3 and 2@xmath1064 must be specular ( identical ) with high precision . qualitatively",
    ", the argument here is the same as in the billiard theory where closed orbits are known to be rare exceptions .",
    "as long as the loops are absent , solutions to the andreev equation , vary smoothly when parameters of the trajectory ( e.g. its direction ) or the surface roughness are changed and have certain limit when the virtual roughness tends to zero .",
    "hence , the averaging with respect to the virtual roughness is trivial : it amounts to neglecting it in any calculation provided the topology of the trajectories is single - connected . the virtual roughness ( tending to zero )",
    "is needed here only as a mean to eliminate the geometric resonances which are not of interest because they are not seen on the coarse - grain level of description .",
    "( another line of reasoning could be to say that any real sample is always microscopically rough so that loops are statistically impossible ) .    by these arguments",
    ", one comes to the important conclusion that due to the virtual ( or real ) roughness the paths tied together by a knot do not show any further correlations and do not ( _ typically _ ) meet each other on other knots .",
    "this seems to be an analog to the impurity averaging .",
    "effectively , it allows one to average over the fermi wave length scale from the very beginning .",
    "uncorrelated multiple collisions with interfaces transform a ballistic trajectory into a tree - like geometrical object . to give a general idea of what we mean by a tree",
    ", the topological structure of one of the possible trees with n=2,3 knots is shown in fig.[3-fig ] . the tree corresponding to a real physical situation will be presented later .",
    "the main feature of the tree - like trajectory is its one - dimensional character , the property which can equivalently formulated as ( i ) there is no loops or interfering paths ; ( ii ) there is only one path connecting any two points of the tree ; ( iii ) the cut of any line produces two disconnected pieces .",
    "since the tree is effectively 1-dimensional , one is able to repeat andreev s procedure on a tree - like trajectory defining the slowly varying envelope wave @xmath107 by the formula @xmath108 , where @xmath109 spans the points on the tree , and @xmath110 is the coordinate along the tree counted off a point . in between knots ,",
    "the andreev equation eq.([5db ] ) is valid and the values of the wave function on a knot are coupled by the scattering s - matrix ( see section [ knot ] ) .",
    "the purpose of present paper is to extend the existing quasiclassical green s function theory of superconductivity to the case of multi - interface geometry .",
    "in essence , the standard quasiclassical ( `` @xmath111-integrated '' ) theory of superconductivity is the green s function version of the andreev equation : again , the quantum coherence of the electron and hole residing on the same trajectory is taken into full consideration whereas the coherence between particles occupying different trajectories is neglected .",
    "the paths are coupled to each other only by the self - consistent effective potentials like various self - energies ( impurity , phonon ) and the pair potential @xmath5 .",
    "the green function technique has obvious advantages for one is able to perform the disorder averaging , include the inelastic scattering and the strong - coupling effects _",
    "etc_.    although the potential due to crystal imperfections like impurities is far not slowly varying , this does not invalidates the quasiclassical scheme if one is interested only in the disorder averaged properties .",
    "it is well - known that the disorder averaging amounts to the impurity self - energy term in the gorkov equation which effect is similar to that of the potential energy .",
    "the self - energy varies on the same spatial scale as other self - consistent potential and as such does not violate classicality . of course",
    ", the imaginary part of the self - energy must be small so that the mean free path @xmath112 is large , @xmath113 .",
    "the quantum localization corrections controlled by the parameter @xmath114 are ignored , which again is consistent with the limit @xmath40 or @xmath115 accepted in the quasiclassical theory .",
    "we use the version of the quasiclassical theory @xcite where the main object is the 2-point green s function on classical trajectories . in our opinion",
    ", this approach is most adequate to the above physical picture of the electron - hole phase coherence spreading along classical trajectories .",
    "as has already been discussed , in the many - interface geometry the classical trajectory becomes tree - like .",
    "accordingly , the arguments of the 2-point green s function are points on a tree . in the present paper",
    ", we restrict ourselves to the stationary case , and our main concern is the retarded green s function of the keldysh technique .    the paper is organized as follows . in sect.[green ] , we review the quasiclassical theory in the formulation based on the 2-point green s function . the connection to the standard technique",
    "is discussed in sect.[1point ] . in sect.[motion ] , we briefly show the connection to the riccati equation technique @xcite , as well as suggest a general method for the case of a periodic potential . in sect.[knot ]",
    ", we derive the boundary conditions for the green s function on the knot ( interface ) with arbitrary number of channels . in sect.[andreev ] , a solution to the multi - channel problem of the andreev reflection as well as the bound states , is given .",
    "in sect.[match ] , we derive the interface boundary condition for the riccati equation . in sect.[transs ] , the boundary condition for the green s function in terms of the transfer matrix is derived . in sect.[layer ] , we show the usage of the general approach applying the theory for studying simple examples : ( i ) a film separated by a partially transparent interface from of a bulk material superconductor ; ( ii ) two layers of a finite thickness . motivated by the recent theory of the paramagnetic effect @xcite , we pay most attention to the case when the phases of the order parameter in the two superconductors differ in @xmath1 ; numerical data for the density of states and superfluid density are presented .",

    "a convenient starting point is the formulation of the quasiclassical technique in terms of the 2-point green s function on classical trajectories ; the method was first suggested in @xcite ( `` @xmath55-representation '' ) , and in a different form developed in @xcite .",

    "therefore , our data support the recent idea put forward by fauchere , belzig , and blatter @xcite about the paramagnetic instability near the surface where the order parameter changes its sign .",
    "however , one sees in fig.[sandwich ] that the effect is very sensitive to the presence of the partially reflective interface : reflection with the probability as low as 4 percent makes @xmath572 positive at any temperature .",
    "in this paper we have reconsidered the part of the quasiclassical theory of superconductivity which concerns interfaces between superconductors ( sis ) or a normal metal and a superconductors ( nis ) .",
    "since the interface violates the condition of applicability of the quasiclassical approximation , the reflection and transmission processes must be included via a boundary condition . in the approach taken in the paper , the master boundary condition in eq.([wsa ] ) is formulated for the effective wave functions factorizing the 2-point green s function . in the boundary condition , the two - component amplitudes in n in - coming and n out - going channels are related to each other via the s - matrix .",
    "the latter is sensitive to microscopic details of the interface and is considered as an input in the quasiclassical theory .",
    "the theory is equally applicable to specular interfaces ( @xmath352 ) , as well as to the many channel case which models a rough surface or interface . in sections",
    "[ andreev ] , [ match ] , and [ transs ] , the master boundary condition is reformulated in various forms , suitable for the one or the other application .    in sect.[andreev ] , we have presented a general solution to the ballistic problem of the scattering of electron - and hole - like _",
    "excitation_. this result extends the theory of the nis interface @xcite to the many channel situation ; sis case is also included . as in ref.@xcite ,",
    "the solution is general in the sense that it expresses the full amplitude of the multiple processes of the andreev electron @xmath306 hole conversion and ordinary scattering via the amplitudes of the elementary processes . by this ,",
    "the problem is split into independent and more simple problems .",
    "the theory of multi - channel bound states is also considered .",
    "the formulation which operates with excitations rather than bare particles , is especially convenient for the kinetic theory in the framework of the boltzmann - type equations , for which it provides the boundary condition for the distribution function of the excitations @xcite .    for a general case _",
    "i.e. _ when the disorder and inelastic collisions are allowed , the boundary value of the 2-component wave functions @xmath592 factorizing the trajectory green s function are found in sect.[match ]",
    ". since the mean field equations are linear , this result can be recast as the boundary condition for the andreev amplitudes @xmath593 of the riccati equation approach . in a most compact and symmetric form",
    ", the boundary condition is given by eq.([87a ] ) .",
    "for the specular interface , the boundary condition for the riccati equation is given by eq.([a8a ] ) , or explicitly by eqs.([b8a1 ] ) , and ( [ b8a ] ) .",
    "one more form of the boundary condition is presented in sect.[transs ] , where the expression for the transfer matrix is derived .",
    "the transfer matrix , which couples the wave functions or the 1-point green s functions on the chosen pair of in- and out - channels , absorbs information about all other @xmath594 channels .",
    "this modification of the boundary condition is convenient when one solves the eilenberger equations for the 1-point green s function . in the simplest 2-channel case ( specular reflection )",
    ", this boundary condition reproduces zaitsev s results @xcite .",
    "the new form seems to be more flexible and convenient .    for the derivation",
    ", we use the technique of the 2-point green s function . in our opinion",
    ", the technique provides an adequate language to discuss the semiclassical physics in superconductors which we qualitatively considered in section [ intro ] .",
    "the 2-point green s function gives a full description of the coherent propagation of electron and hole along a common classical path . in spite of the fact that observables can be expressed via the 1-point green s function",
    "only , the language of the quasiclassical 2-point green s function on is not redundant : offering a physically transparent formalism , it is free from some uniqueness problems which plague the standard `` @xmath111-integrated '' formulation . note also that with all possible simplifications already done , the quasiclassical 2-point green s function obeys eqs.([vra1 ] ) , and ( [ vra ] ) which , unlike the eilenberger equations , have a familiar form of an equation for a propagator .",
    "therefore , one may directly apply the intuition and experience gained in other fields of the quantum theory .    another attractive feature of the 2-point green s function technique is that it allows one to define effective wave functions .",
    "the latter factorize the green s function averaged with respect to disorder or phonons .",
    "although these `` wave functions '' have usual quantum mechanical meaning only in ballistic case , it seems to be advantageous that one may use the unified language of trajectories and wave functions discussing both the ballistic motion and the propagation in the presence of disorder or inelastic collisions .    the effective wave function",
    ", @xmath595 obeys the linear andreev - type equation eq.([xra ] ) .",
    "there is a variety of methods one can chose to solve the system of two linear differential equations for @xmath596 and @xmath120 .",
    "one of them is to derive the equation for the ratio @xmath593 which turns out to be the riccati equation suggested in @xcite .",
    "as the logarithmic derivative @xmath597 in the usual schrdinger equation does , the choice of the ratio @xmath593 has the indisputable practical advantage which is due to insensitivity of the ratio to the normalisation of @xmath155 .",
    "the riccati equation approach which has proven to be very convenient and efficient for numerics , finds rather natural physical interpretation in the 2-point green s function technique of the present paper .",
    "( for the latest development of the riccati equation approach including the interface boundary condition see e - preprint of m. eschrig @xcite . )",
    "an important part of this paper is the understanding that the classical trajectory transforms to a topologically 1-dimensional simply connected tree in the case of many interfaces and/or boundaries .",
    "the extended arguments in favour of this point of view have been presented in section [ intro ] .",
    "although , this assertion may look wrong in simple idealized geometries , like e.g. , a sandwich with strictly parallel outer and the interface planes fig.[loop1 ] , we argue that small deviations from the perfection eliminate accidental crossings of trajectories ( as in non - integrable billiards ) . in our opinion ,",
    "the difficulties with the quasiclassical theory encountered in @xcite are due to the fact that some interference contributions survive the procedure of the integration with respect to the layer thickness : indeed , rigid variations of the layer thickness do not eliminate all the loops .",
    "we believe that some roughness , larger then the fermi wave length but small and invisible on the quasiclassical scale , will restore the quasiclassical results .",
    "to show the new theory in action , we solve in sect.[layer ] two simple problems : ( i ) a film separated from a bulk material by a partially transparent interface ; ( ii ) a two layer system with arbitrary transparent interface . ( the latter was classified in @xcite as quasiclassically unsolvable . ) motivated by recent ideas about the origin of the paramagnetic effect @xcite , we evaluate the density of states and the superfluid density when the phase of the order parameters in the layers differs in @xmath1 , a scenario of paramagnetic instability suggested in @xcite .",
    "our results confirm the very possibility that the superfluid density @xmath572 may be negative ( meissner _ `` anti - screening '' _ ) but we observe also that @xmath572 is strongly affected by reflection on the interface : when the probability of the reflection @xmath598 , the meissner _ screening _ is restored .",
    "the implications of these results for a realistic theory of the paramagnetic instability requires further studies .",
    "we are thankful to w. belzig and c. bruder for discussions , and to d. rainer for very useful comments .",
    "this study begun during the stay of one of us ( a.s ) at the institut fr theorie der kondensierten materie , universitt karlsruhe , and a.s . would like to thank all the stuff for hospitality and der deutschen forschungsgemeinschaft ( sfb 195 ) for support . in part",
    "this work was supported by the swedish natural science research council .",
    "the advanced green s function @xmath599 is constructed in the same manner as the retarded one : one finds @xmath600 from eq.([xra ] ) with @xmath146 substitutes for @xmath147 and builds the green s function as in eqs.([7ra ] ) , ( [ 44a ] ) and ( [ fsa ] ) .    combining eqs.([i5a ] ) and ( [ zra ] ) , one can see that the @xmath601 with @xmath602 from eq.([xra ] ) satisfies the corresponding equation in the a - case .",
