    "in this paper , all graphs are simple , undirected and finite . for notation and terminology",
    "we follow the book @xcite .",
    "an @xmath18 for a graph @xmath1 is a mapping from the edges of @xmath1 to a finite number of colors . in the early days ,",
    "many classical colorings were put forward and studied such as proper edge - coloring , list edge - coloring , acyclic edge - coloring and so on .",
    "recently , based on a variety of application instances in different fields , a number of new edge - colorings were put forward .",
    "for example , the rainbow edge - coloring has received wide attention due to its close connection with network security and many valuable results were derived in the papers such as @xcite and the book @xcite .    in this paper , we want to specify more about another kind of edge - coloring , that is , the @xmath19 , which was first introduced in @xcite .",
    "assume that a group of @xmath12 computers , each has @xmath0 ports on the back , are needed to build a network .",
    "there are @xmath10 kinds of connections altogether and every two distinct computers can build at most one connection between them .",
    "it is necessary to use every port so that the fail - safe connections would be maximized .",
    "furthermore , distinct computers must have different numbers of types of connections so that the computer engineer is able to distinguish them .",
    "the above fact is an application instance for kaleidoscopic coloring .",
    "actually it can model a lot of situations and can be applied to many fields such as computer science and telecommunications .",
    "next we will give the definition of kaleidoscopic coloring .",
    "for an @xmath0-regular graph @xmath1 , we define an edge - coloring to its edges with the colors @xmath20=\\{1,2,3,\\cdots , k\\ } \\ ( k\\geq3)$ ] such that any vertex in @xmath1 is incident to at least one edge of each color . for a color set @xmath21",
    ", the @xmath22-tuple of a vertex @xmath6 is defined as @xmath23 , where @xmath24 denotes the number of edges with color @xmath25 which are incident with @xmath6 in @xmath1 . in particular , the _ multiset - color @xmath5 _ of the vertex @xmath6 is an @xmath22-tuple for @xmath26 $ ] .",
    "then this edge - coloring @xmath2 is called a _",
    "@xmath10-kaleidoscopic coloring _ of @xmath1 if every two distinct vertices in @xmath1 have different multiset - colors and in this way the graph @xmath1 is a @xmath10-@xmath27 .",
    "as one knows that a proper edge - coloring of a graph @xmath1 is to factorize the edge set of @xmath1 into @xmath28 such that @xmath29 is an independent edge set , what we need for the kaleidoscopic coloring is a factorization that enables distinct vertices have distinct @xmath20$]-tuples , which is defined as @xmath30 for the vertex @xmath6 in @xmath1 .",
    "it is well known that every connected graph has at least two vertices with the same degree .",
    "actually there are exactly one connected graph @xmath1 of order @xmath12 containing only two vertices of the same degree .",
    "we then describe the graph as follows .",
    "label the vertices of @xmath1 as @xmath31 , and add an edge @xmath32 if and only if @xmath33 , it is obvious that @xmath34 and @xmath35 share the same degree of @xmath36 .",
    "therefore for any decomposition of any @xmath0-regular graph @xmath1 into two graphs @xmath37 and @xmath38 , at least two vertices @xmath39 and @xmath6 have the property : deg@xmath40(u)=deg@xmath40(v ) and deg@xmath41(u)=deg@xmath41(v ) .",
    "so any @xmath0-regular graph @xmath1 is definitely not a @xmath42-kaleidoscope , thus our discussion starts with the integer @xmath14 .",
    "it can be easily seen that @xmath43 is required for an @xmath0-regular graph to be a @xmath10-kaleidoscope according to the definition .",
    "but in fact @xmath44 holds since @xmath45 would imply that at most @xmath10 different @xmath20$]-tuples satisfy the demand of at least @xmath46 distinct @xmath20$]-tuples for the vertices in @xmath1 , a contradiction . combining with the above",
    ", we come to the conclusion that for an @xmath0-regular graph @xmath1 of order @xmath12 , the integer @xmath10 for @xmath1 to be a @xmath10-kaleidoscope can only be integers chosen from @xmath14 to @xmath47 .",
    "in @xcite , the author solved the cases for @xmath10 to be @xmath14 or @xmath47 when @xmath1 is complete .",
    "and they also posed the following conjecture .",
    "@xcite[conjecture1.1 ] for integers @xmath12 and @xmath10 with @xmath48 , the complete graph @xmath11 is a @xmath10-kaleidoscope .",
    "another concerning problem in @xcite is the maximum order for the @xmath0-regular @xmath14-kaleidos- copes .",
    "a simple calculation shows that there are @xmath49 different @xmath50$]-tuples altogether for an @xmath0-regular graph .",
    "so the number of vertices in an @xmath0-regular graph can not exceed @xmath49 as long as it is a @xmath14-kaleidoscope according to the definition .",
    "since for the integer @xmath51 , @xmath49 is odd , so there is no @xmath0-regular graph with order @xmath49 .",
    "thus the largest possible order for an @xmath0-regular @xmath14-kaleidoscope is @xmath15 .",
    "the author in @xcite proved that for any @xmath52 such that @xmath53 , there exists an @xmath0-regular @xmath14-kaleidoscope of order @xmath49 .",
    "furthermore , the following conjecture was posed in the same book .",
    "@xcite[conjecture1.2 ] for each integer @xmath54 where @xmath55 , there is an @xmath0-regular @xmath14-kaleidoscope of order @xmath15 .    in this paper , we solve these two conjectures , and give their proofs respectively in sections @xmath42 and @xmath14 .",
    "before we give the proof of conjecture [ conjecture1.1 ] , two auxiliary lemmas are stated as follows .",
    "* proof of conjecture [ conjecture1.1 ] : * the case when @xmath59 is verified in lemma [ lemma2.1 ] . for the complete graph @xmath11 ,",
    "we give our proof by induction on @xmath12 .",
    "the case when @xmath60 can easily be verified that it satisfies conjecture [ conjecture1.1 ] according to lemma [ lemma2.1 ] .",
    "we suppose that @xmath61 is a @xmath10-kaleidoscope for any @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is any integer smaller than @xmath12 .",
    "we distinguish two cases to clarify .",
    "* when @xmath64 , we all know that for @xmath65 , @xmath66 can be decomposed into @xmath67 hamiltonian cycles @xmath68 and a perfect matching @xmath69 .",
    "we then put the @xmath70-kaleidoscopic coloring for @xmath71 to be an @xmath70-kaleidoscope depicted in the proof of lemma [ lemma2.2 ] here .",
    "when @xmath12 is even , for each @xmath72 , we give a proper coloring to @xmath73 with the colors @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "furthermore , we assign the color @xmath47 to all edges in @xmath69 . as for @xmath76 containing vertices @xmath77 in the clockwise order . we assign the color @xmath78 to the two edges incident with @xmath79 in @xmath76 .",
    "while when @xmath80 is odd , let @xmath81 , then @xmath82 can be decomposed into @xmath83 hamiltonian cycles @xmath84 and a perfect matching @xmath69 , then color the edges of @xmath85 and @xmath69 as above . for @xmath86 containing @xmath87 in the clockwise order , assign the color @xmath88 to the edge @xmath89 and the color @xmath47 to all the rest edges . at last",
    "give the color @xmath88 to the edge @xmath90 , assign the color @xmath91 to the edge @xmath92 and give the color @xmath47 for the rest of edges in @xmath1 .",
    "we denote the coloring depicted above by @xmath2 and we give a @xmath10-kaleidoscopic coloring @xmath93 on the foundation of @xmath2 for @xmath94 .",
    "that is : @xmath95 this solution can easily be observed since the @xmath20$]-tuples for distinct vertices are different in their former @xmath96 positions , so we can still distinguish them after we combine the latter colors into one .",
    "* subcase 1 .",
    "* when @xmath12 is even .",
    "we first consider the case when @xmath98 .",
    "separate the @xmath12 vertices into two @xmath99s denoted by @xmath100 and @xmath101 respectively with all edges between them . according to our induction",

    "display the vertices of @xmath135 according to their degrees in the nondecreasing order and label them as @xmath104 in @xmath136 and @xmath105 in @xmath137 .",

    "assign the color @xmath14 to edges of @xmath140 and the color @xmath141 to the remaining edges in @xmath142s .",
    "the rest edges are colored as the above description except for a little change that the color of @xmath143 is @xmath42 instead of @xmath116 .",
    "the checkout is similar .",
    "* subcase 2 .",
    "* when @xmath12 is odd .",
    "the simplest condition is @xmath133 and @xmath144 . in this case , split the graph @xmath11 into @xmath145 and @xmath146 with all edges between them . give a @xmath14-kaleidoscopic coloring respectively to @xmath145 and @xmath146 using the colors @xmath42 , @xmath14 and @xmath141 . and assign the color @xmath116 to all edges between them .",
    "for the case that @xmath98 and @xmath144 , label the vertices of @xmath145 and @xmath146 respectively as @xmath147 and @xmath148 , furthermore we each give them a @xmath149-kaleidoscopic coloring using the colors from @xmath150 if @xmath151 and each give them a @xmath14-kaleidoscopic coloring using colors from @xmath152 if @xmath153 .",
    "for the former case , @xmath154 is assigned to the color @xmath155 if @xmath156 while in the latter case , @xmath154 has the color @xmath157 if @xmath158 .",
    "only three particular conditions are left .",
    "that is , @xmath133 when @xmath160 and @xmath133 or @xmath161 when @xmath162 . like our discussion in subcase 1",
    ", we again find the three unique connected spanning subgraph @xmath163 , @xmath164 and @xmath165 with only two vertices of the same degree contained in @xmath166 , @xmath167 and @xmath168 appearing in the decomposition of @xmath169 and @xmath170 .",
    "similarly , the vertices of @xmath163 , @xmath164 and @xmath165 are ordered in nondecreasing sequence according to their degrees as @xmath171 , @xmath172 and @xmath173 .",
    "let @xmath174 , @xmath175 and @xmath176 .",
    "assign the edges in @xmath177 with color the @xmath116 and all the remaining edges in @xmath178 the color @xmath42 .",
    "thus @xmath118 and @xmath179 , @xmath180 and @xmath181 , @xmath120 and @xmath182 , @xmath183 and @xmath184 , @xmath185 and @xmath186 , in addition with @xmath187 and @xmath188 , these @xmath189 couples have the same @xmath109-tuples . as a result",
    ", we only need to provide a coloring to the edges of @xmath190 or @xmath159 using the colors @xmath191 and to the edges of @xmath159 using the colors @xmath192 such that the above six couples can not have the same @xmath193-tuples or @xmath152-tuples .",
    "and it goes without saying that the vertices in figure [ fig1 ] can be matched properly to @xmath171 , @xmath194 or @xmath195 so that the six couples would not have the same multiset - colors .",
    "thus , our proof is done .      for a fixed integer @xmath196 , note that @xmath197 .",
    "so for @xmath198 , let @xmath73 be a set of @xmath199 vertices , and for each @xmath73 , order the vertices as @xmath200 .",
    "then we arrange these vertices in @xmath201 in the shape of an equilateral triangle .",
    "that is , the distance between any couple of nearest vertices is @xmath116 .",
    "we put an example of the location of the vertices for @xmath202 in figure [ fig2]@xmath203 .",
    "we then rotate the triangle around the center vertex anticlockwise through an angle of @xmath204 and denote like above as @xmath205 and @xmath206 . in the same way @xmath207 and @xmath208 are obtained after a rotating of @xmath209 .",
    "we denote by @xmath210 the edge @xmath211 , @xmath212 the edge @xmath213 , and @xmath214 the edge @xmath215 . for any point @xmath216 inside of the triangle",

    "thus every vertex is endowed with a unique coordinate @xmath227 .",
    "we are going to give a coloring that enables any vertex @xmath216 to have @xmath228 edges with the color @xmath9 .",
    "firstly we remove the vertex @xmath230 . for each @xmath231",
    ", we construct the unique connected graph with only two vertices of the same degree satisfying that @xmath232 . and put @xmath233 . for @xmath234 , @xmath235 . and @xmath236 .",

    "the edges in @xmath237 , @xmath238s and @xmath135s are all given the color @xmath116 .",

    "then any vertex @xmath216 has @xmath247 neighboring edges with the color @xmath42 except @xmath248 and @xmath249 with a difference of @xmath116 respectively .",
    "so we add an edge @xmath250 and give it the color @xmath42 .",
    "since the vertex @xmath251 has been removed , take the vertex @xmath252 in place of @xmath251 ( @xmath252 is used twice , both in @xmath253 and @xmath254 ) .",
    "then @xmath255s in @xmath256s , @xmath257 , @xmath258s and @xmath259 are obtained after the same procedure as @xmath135s in @xmath73s , @xmath260 , @xmath238s and @xmath261 .",
    "the number of the edges with the color @xmath14 incident to @xmath262 is @xmath263 and the number of @xmath252 is @xmath264 .",
    "so remove the edge @xmath265 and add the edge @xmath266 with the color @xmath14 .",

    "the construction for the @xmath0-regular graph is complete and the coloring is given .",
    "it can be easily verified that this construction satisfies our demands .",
