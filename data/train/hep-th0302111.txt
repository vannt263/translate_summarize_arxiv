    "the quest for a quantum theory of gravity is now several decades old and has been studied with approaches ranging from string theory and non - commutative geometry to loop quantum gravity , spin foams , and discrete models of planck - scale spacetime .",
    "most of these take different interpretations of what a quantum theory of gravity should achieve , but with one thing in common : that it should be some merger of general relativity and quantum theory",
    ". the final goal has not yet been achieved , but all these approaches have brought to us new understandings of the problem .    we come to the motivation for this paper by putting together a consistent list of features , selectively chosen from among the various indications of what a quantum theory of gravity may be .",
    "such a list is by no means unique , but we will find that it is fruitful ; it leads to a new notion of quantum cosmology and a new formulation of evolution in a planck - scale theory .",
    "our list is the following : 1 ) at energies close to the planck scale , the description of spacetime as a continuous , @xmath0-dimensional manifold breaks down ; this is the usual idea for regularization of quantum field theory .",
    "2 ) causality is still present in planck - scale geometry .",
    "3 ) quantum theory is valid in planck - scale physics .",
    "4 ) in a fundamental theory of the universe , there should be a finite number of degrees of freedom in any finite region of the universe ; this is supported by black hole entropy calculations from both string theory and loop quantum gravity , and bekenstein s physical arguments .",
    "5 ) the theory should be background independent .",
    "quantum causal histories ( qch ) were introduced in @xcite as a formalism for quantum cosmology that realizes most of the above assumptions .",
    "the idea is to use a causal set ( locally finite , partially ordered set ) as the description of the causal structure of the universe .",
    "quantum theory is present through the assignment of finite - dimensional hilbert spaces to these events .",
    "they can be regarded as representing the fundamental building blocks of the universe at the planck scale .",
    "the composite hilbert space for two spacelike separated events is the tensor product of the individual hilbert spaces .",
    "evolution is implemented by unitary operators between complete pairs , special cases of sets of spacelike separated events which can be understood as isolated planck - scale systems , or the discrete equivalent of successive cauchy surfaces of an isolated component of spacetime .    clearly , this implements the first four properties above .",
    "the fifth is more difficult ( and will not be resolved here ) .",
    "because it involves a fixed causal structure , a qch is not a completely background independent description .",
    "nevertheless , all other degrees of freedom are quantum , and with the algebraic treatment presented here this may be a step toward a truly background independent model .",
    "quantum causal histories can also describe causal spin foam models ( see the review @xcite ) .",
    "these are pre - spacetime models ; that is , gravity and the familiar spacetime manifold are meant to be derived as the low - energy continuum approximation of such models .",
    "a particular example of a qch is a causal spin network @xcite and this was a principal motivation for the introduction of qch s .",
    "a variation on the idea of a qch was applied to a spin foam model in @xcite .    however , as was already discussed in @xcite , the definition of qch there does not adequately take into account the causal structure of the underlying causal set . in particular , the unitary evolution operators in that definition are indifferent to the individual relations interpolating between the ingoing and outgoing events .",
    "the same unitary evolution is admitted regardless of these individual relations .",
    "this means that the quantum evolution does not respect the underlying causal structure .",
    "further , given two related events , there might not be a complete pair containing them , in which case we can not say anything about the relation between states at the two events .",
    "these issues are discussed in detail in the next section .    in this paper",
    "we address all of the above issues by giving a revised definition for a quantum causal history in which the causal structure is faithfully reflected in the quantum causal history .",
    "we find that doing so requires working with algebras of operators , instead of hilbert spaces , on the events . following the above idea of local finiteness at the fundamental level ,",
    "these algebras are simple matrix c@xmath1-algebras .",
    "we find that a causal relation in the causal set corresponds to a completely positive map in the qch .",
    "this is not surprising , since this is the most general kind of physical transformation allowed by quantum theory .",
    "we also show that these maps can be regarded as fundamental and the unitary operators of the original definition can be reconstructed from them with no loss of information .    as a quantum cosmology ,",
    "a qch is most naturally interpreted as describing the universe as a very large collection of open quantum mechanical building blocks .",
    "unitary evolution arises only where there is a complete pair , which is the discrete analogue of an isolated system .",
    "this is much more general than a wheeler - dewitt type of quantum cosmology . that `` canonical '' approach to quantum gravity is strongly dependent on global hyperbolicity and cauchy surfaces .",
    "in contrast , qch s allow that hyperbolicity may dissolve in the quantum foam .",
    "this seems more likely to describe the apparent non - unitarity of black hole evaporation than does the more traditional approach .",
    "a qch is also especially suited for describing the evolution of localized quantities without having to refer to a path integral or hamiltonian constraint for the entire universe .",
    "aside from cosmology , we see with hindsight that there are several further ways of interpreting a qch ; we discuss these in section [ qft ] and the conclusions .",
    "concretely , the present paper is an in - depth analysis of qch s and opens up several new possibilities for the concrete implementation of models of that type .",
    "for example , it is interesting , and potentially practical , that evolution in a qch is almost identical to the quantum information theoretic description of quantum noise . also , the continuous time analogue of the completely positive evolution in a qch , is a master equation , already extensively used in quantum cosmology .",
    "we comment on these connections in the conclusions .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in section [ qch ] , we review the original definition of quantum causal histories given in @xcite , as well as the definitions of the basic structures in a causal set that are needed for the rest of the paper .",
    "one of our main results is that the relations in a causal set correspond to completely positive maps in the qch . in order to give the reader some intuition about these maps before they have to face the precise definition of a qch and the following proof that unitary evolution can be reconstructed from them , we give in section [ cpmaps ] a basic introduction to completely positive maps and a simple example .",
    "section [ ach ] is the revised , complete definition of a qch .",
    "although this was not a motivation for this work , this definition can be understood as an algebraic quantum field theory on a causal set , with the operator algebras being simple matrix c@xmath1-algebras .",
    "we explain this in section [ qft ] . in section",
    "[ proof ] , we show that nothing is lost in going from the unitary operators of the original definition to the completely positive maps , since the former can be reconstructed from the latter , up to irrelevant phase factors .",
    "we discuss the interpretation of our results and future directions in the conclusions .",
    "in this section we review quantum causal histories .",
    "they were defined in @xcite as a general formalism for causal spin foams in quantum gravity @xcite .",
    "an important and distinguishing feature of the geometry of spacetime ( as opposed to space ) is causal structure .",
    "if a spacetime is time - orientable and has no closed timelike curves , then its causal structure can be completely described as a partial order relation on the events ( points ) of the spacetime .",
    "the definition of the relation is that @xmath2 ( `` @xmath3 precedes @xmath4 '' ) if there exists a future - directed non - spacelike curve from @xmath3 to @xmath4 .",
    "this relation is transitive , i.e. , if @xmath2 and @xmath5 then @xmath6 , because future - directed curves can be concatenated .",
    "the assumption that there exist no closed timelike curves means precisely that @xmath2 and @xmath7 if and only if @xmath8 .",
    "these are the defining properties of a _ partial order relation_.    we are concerned here with a discrete analogue of a smooth spacetime .",
    "causal set _",
    "@xmath9 is a locally finite , partially ordered set .",
    "that is , for any two events @xmath10 , there exist ( at most ) finitely many events @xmath11 such that @xmath12 .",
    "if either @xmath2 or @xmath7 , then we say that the events @xmath3 and @xmath4 are _",
    "related_. if two events are not related , then we say that they are _ spacelike separated _ and write @xmath13 .    an _ acausal set _ is a subset @xmath14 such that all events in @xmath15 are spacelike separated to one another , i.e. , @xmath16 .",
    "acausal sets play the role of spacelike hypersurfaces in causal sets .",
    "a causal set can usefully represented by the ( directed ) graph of elementary relations ( fig .",
    "[ cpairs ] ) .",
    "the set of vertices is simply @xmath9 .",
    "there is an edge @xmath17 if @xmath2 but there does not exist any @xmath11 such that @xmath12 .",
    "there is a simple analogue of a future - directed non - spacelike curve in a causal set .",
    "a _ future - directed path _ is a directed path through the graph , that is , a sequence of events such that there exists an edge from each event to the next .",
    "a future - directed path is _ future ( past ) inextendible _ if there exists no event in @xmath9 which is in the future ( past ) of the entire path .",
    "note that this graph generates the partial ordering : @xmath2 if and only if there exists a future directed path from @xmath3 to @xmath4 .    from this",
    ", we can define complete future and past .",
    "an acausal set @xmath15 is a _ complete future _ of an event @xmath3 if @xmath15 intersects any future - inextendible future - directed path that starts at @xmath3 .",
    "similarly , an acausal set @xmath15 is a _ complete past _ of an event @xmath3 if @xmath15 intersects any past - inextendible future - directed path that ends at @xmath3 .    in order to describe a local quantum structure on our causal set , we would like a ( finite - dimensional ) hilbert space @xmath18 for every event @xmath19 . for two spacelike",
    "separated events @xmath20 , the composite state space for @xmath21 is @xmath22 .",
    "more generally , for any acausal set @xmath23 , @xmath24 .    in quantum mechanics ,",
    "time evolution is unitary evolution between the hilbert spaces at different times . when should we expect unitary maps between the hilbert spaces for different acausal sets @xmath25 ?",
    "unitarity can be interpreted as meaning that no information is lost or added .",
    "we can only expect that no information is lost in evolving from @xmath15 to @xmath26 if @xmath26 is a complete future of @xmath15 ; otherwise , information coming from @xmath15 might `` miss '' @xmath26 .",
    "likewise , we can only expect a state at @xmath26 to be completely determined by one at @xmath15 if @xmath15 is a complete past of @xmath26 . when both of these conditions are satisfied",
    " @xmath15 is a complete past of @xmath26 and @xmath26 is a complete future of @xmath15  we call @xmath15 and @xmath26 a complete pair and write @xmath27",
    ". we should expect a unitary map @xmath28 if and only if @xmath27 .",
    "one can think of a complete pair as successive cauchy surfaces of an isolated component of spacetime , or of all spacetime ( see fig .",
    "[ cpairs ] ) .",
    "this leads to the definition of a quantum causal history given in @xcite .",
    "it consists of a causal set @xmath9 , a finite - dimensional hilbert space @xmath18 for every @xmath19 , and a unitary map @xmath29 for any complete pair @xmath27 , such that for @xmath30 , @xmath31    with this definition , the unitary maps on the complete pairs tell us very little about the causal relations between the two acausal sets",
    ". there can be many configurations of the interpolating causal relations in a complete pair , for example :        the rules of a quantum causal history tell us that there is a unitary map @xmath32 , but not how it should depend on the interpolating causal relations .",
    "this is insufficient .",
    "consider for example the complete pair :        if we start with an unentangled pure state @xmath33 , then this will evolve to @xmath34 .",
    "the state at @xmath35 is described by a density matrix , @xmath36 . with this causal structure",
    ", the state at @xmath35 should be completely determined by that at @xmath4 . in other words",
    "@xmath37 should be independent of @xmath38 .",
    "however , with the above definition of a quantum causal history , there is no restriction on @xmath39 that would prevent @xmath37 from depending upon @xmath38 .",
    "another problem with this definition is the reliance on complete pairs . given two related events @xmath2 , there may not exist a complete pair containing these events .",
    "if so , with this definition of a quantum causal history , we do not know anything about the relation between states at @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "there should be some relation , and the concept of quantum causal history must be refined to provide this .    in this paper",
    "we address all of the above issues by giving a revised definition of a quantum causal history in which the causal structure of @xmath9 is faithfully reflected in the quantum causal history .",
    "we will define the qch as an assignment of completely positive maps to pairs of causally related events .",
    "these maps relate the local observables at the causally related events . in the next section",
    "we introduce the definition of a completely positive map on open quantum mechanical systems , in order to provide some intuition for the evolution in qch before giving the new definition and results in sections [ ach ] and [ proof ] .",
    "an ordinary quantum mechanical system may be isolated , or it may be coupled to some environment .",
    "the states of the system can be described with density matrices and the most general evolution that quantum mechanics allows for such a system is a linear , trace - preserving , completely positive ( cp ) map . in this section",
    "we define cp maps and discuss their physical interpretation .",
    "consider a system @xmath40 in some mixed state given by @xmath41 , a density matrix on its hilbert space .",
    "let @xmath40 interact with an environment @xmath42 , also in a mixed state @xmath43 .",
    "the evolution of the joint system is given by a unitary operator @xmath44 .",
    "the process could be such that it is not feasible to extract the system @xmath40 again , but instead we extract @xmath45 , which has a density matrix @xmath46 .",
    "see fig.[cpex ] .",
    "the transformation from @xmath41 to @xmath46 is given by a map @xmath47 of the form @xmath48.\\ ] ]    such generic transformations from a quantum system to another are maps from the set of density matrices on @xmath40 to the set of density matrices on @xmath45 that satisfy the following conditions :    _ linear on the set of density matrices : _ a probabilistic mixture of inputs leads to a probabilistic mixture of outputs , i.e. , for probabilities @xmath49 , @xmath50    _ trace - preserving : _",
    "this simply means that the normalization is preserved for any density matrix .",
    "the total probability for _ anything _ to happen is , and remains , @xmath52 .    _",
    "positive : _ probabilities are never negative , and so a density matrix has to be a positive operator ( i.e. , self - adjoint with only non - negative eigenvalues ) in order to describe a physical system .",
    "this is preserved by @xmath53 : if @xmath41 is positive , then @xmath54 is also positive .",
    "note that this implies that @xmath55 for any matrix @xmath56 .",
    "_ completely positive : _ it turns out that positivity is not enough for @xmath53 to describe a physical process .",
    "suppose that we couple the system @xmath40 to another system @xmath42 that has trivial dynamics , @xmath57 .",
    "for all such trivial extensions , @xmath58 should also be positive .",
    "this is the condition of complete positivity .",
    "complete positivity ensures that the evolution of @xmath40 is extendible in a trivial way to a physical evolution in a larger system @xmath59 .",
    "it is useful because it covers the case where @xmath40 is initially entangled with some distant isolated system .",
    "a completely positive map on density matrices is equivalent to a completely positive map of observable operators in the opposite direction ( in this case , backwards in time ) .",
    "a trace - preserving cp map of density matrices is dual to a unital . ]",
    "cp map of observables .",
    "the most general setting for completely positive maps is between c@xmath1-algebras ( see @xcite ) . in that context",
    ", there are many important tools for working with cp maps .",
    "in particular , the stinespring construction shows that any unital cp map from a c@xmath1-algebra to the algebra of bounded operators on a hilbert space can be written in a universal form , as a representation of the c@xmath1-algebra on a larger hilbert space , composed with the projection onto the smaller hilbert space .",
    "a quantum causal history can be reexpressed in terms of matrix algebras . nothing is lost but trivial phase factors .    to any event @xmath60 , we associate the algebra , @xmath61 \\mbox,\\ ] ] of matrices acting on @xmath18 .",
    "likewise , for any acausal @xmath62 there is the algebra , @xmath63 = \\bigotimes_{x\\in\\xi } { \\mathcal{a}}(x ) \\mbox.\\ ] ] the inner products on the hilbert spaces lead to involutions on the algebras . in this way , they can be regarded as c@xmath1-algebras .",
    "what do the unitary maps @xmath64 give us ?",
    "for a complete pair @xmath27 , @xmath64 determines a @xmath65-isomorphism , @xmath66 if we are only interested in states ( and not phase - factors ) , then @xmath53 does not lose any important information from @xmath64 .",
    "note that the maps @xmath53 are directed backward in time .",
    "this is because we are regarding the matrix algebras as consisting of observable operators acting on the hilbert spaces of local states .",
    "this is equivalent to a map of states ( density matrices ) in the other direction .",
    "indeed , states should evolve into the future .",
    "however , because the unitary maps we are starting with are invertible , everything that we are doing can be expressed equivalently with time reversed .    what does @xmath64 give us more locally ?",
    "if @xmath67 , then @xmath68 can be naturally thought of as a unital subalgebra of @xmath69 .",
    "thus , when @xmath27 and @xmath67 , there is a unital @xmath65-homomorphism , @xmath70 , given by restricting @xmath71 to @xmath68 .",
    "however , this is as far as homomorphisms will go . for @xmath72 and @xmath67",
    "the naturally induced map @xmath73 is not a homomorphism ; it is only completely positive .",
    "see fig.[maps1 ] .    before describing the construction , we should note some properties of the algebras that we are working with .",
    "they are simple , finite - dimensional matrix algebras defined on hilbert spaces . as such , they can be viewed in several ways and have convenient structures that are not available with most infinite - dimensional algebras .",
    "we have already noted that they are c@xmath1-algebras .",
    "they are also vonneumann algebras , and because they are simple , they are ( type i ) vonneumann factors .",
    "we will make use of the trace on such an algebra ; however , we will take advantage of the finiteness and use the normalized trace , given by the formula , @xmath74 the advantage of this will be to maintain the time - reversal symmetry of the formalism as explicitly as possible ; the disadvantage is a slightly unorthodox normalization for density matrices ( @xmath75 is correctly normalized ) .    using the trace and the involution",
    ", we can construct an inner product on a matrix algebra , @xmath76 making the algebra into a hilbert space as well . since our algebras are hilbert spaces , the linear maps among them have adjoints .",
    "in particular , if @xmath77 is a linear map respecting the involution @xmath65 , the definition of its adjoint , @xmath78 reduces to the property that for any @xmath79 and @xmath80 , @xmath81=\\tau_b[v(a)b]$ ] .",
    "we denote the adjoint of a map with a dagger to avoid confusion with the c@xmath1-algebra involution @xmath82 .",
    "the adjoint of a homomorphism will not generally be a homomorphism , however , it will be a completely positive ( cp ) map .",
    "the adjoint of any cp map is cp .",
    "if @xmath77 is cp , and @xmath83 and @xmath84 are subalgebras , then define the _ reduction _ of @xmath85 to @xmath86 to be the cp map @xmath87 , where @xmath88 and @xmath89 are the inclusions . @xmath90",
    "a quantum causal history thus leads to cp maps for pairs of events . specifically , if @xmath27 , @xmath72 , and @xmath67 , then @xmath91 is the reduction of @xmath71 .",
    "maps for pairs of related events give a more local description of a quantum causal history than maps for complete pairs of acausal sets . in a local description",
    ", we should regard the maps @xmath92 as fundamental , and specify consistency conditions on them .",
    "this leads to two questions , do local consistency conditions exist , and is any information lost in going from global homomorphisms to local cp maps ? the answers , we will show , are yes and no .    there is one circumstance in which the adjoint of a homomorphism is another homomorphism .    [ unitary ]",
    "if @xmath93 is an isomorphism , then @xmath94 is its inverse ( also an isomorphism ) .",
    "homomorphisms in this category are trace - preserving .",
    "so , for @xmath95 and @xmath80 , @xmath96 = \\tau_b\\left[v(a\\,v^{-1}(b))\\right ]      = \\tau_a[a\\,v^{-1}(b ) ]      \\mbox.\\ ] ] thus @xmath97 .",
    "so , for @xmath27 , @xmath71 and @xmath98 are both isomorphisms .",
    "there is thus a time - reversal covariance ; this should be reflected in our axioms .",
    "states on matrix algebras are all given by density matrices .",
    "specifically , a density matrix is a positive matrix @xmath41 with @xmath99 ; the expectation value of a matrix @xmath56 is @xmath100 . the map of algebras @xmath101 induces a pullback map from states at @xmath3 to states at @xmath4 .",
    "this is simply the adjoint @xmath102 applied to density matrices .",
    "when the map of algebras is a homomorphism , the map of states will take pure states to pure states .",
    "suppose that @xmath15 and @xmath26 are acausal sets , not necessarily a complete pair , but that @xmath26 is a complete future of @xmath15 . in this case , no information should be lost in going from @xmath15 to @xmath26 , and pure states should map to pure states .",
    "thus , there should be a homomorphism @xmath103 .",
    "conversely , if instead @xmath15 is a complete past of @xmath26 , then there should exist @xmath103 such that @xmath98 is a homomorphism .",

    "some of the standard arguments about the properties of the local vonneumann algebras are valid for causal sets ; some are not .",
    "the algebras should all be simple ( i.e. , vonneumann factors ) because the theory would otherwise have local superselection sectors . for continuous spacetime",
    "it is believed that the local algebras should be type iii@xmath144 hyperfinite factors ; however , the reasoning involves the assumption that there exists a good ultraviolet scaling limit .",
    "this does not apply here ; the small - scale structure of a causal set is discrete and not self similar at all .",
    "instead , it seems reasonable ( following property 4 in the introduction ) that only a finite amount of structure should be entrusted to each event . in other words ,",
    "each vonneumann algebra should be a finite - dimensional matrix algebra . in vonneumann algebra terms",
    ", these are finite type i factors .",
    "consider the causal completion @xmath145 of a finite acausal set @xmath15 ; @xmath146 should be generated by the algebras @xmath112 for @xmath72 .",
    "in fact , these algebras should commute , and therefore @xmath147 evolution by homomorphisms is sometimes possible . if @xmath15 and @xmath26 are acausal sets such that @xmath148 , then @xmath149 and so @xmath150 .",
    "this inclusion is the evolution homomorphism when @xmath15 is a complete past of @xmath26 .",
    "not surprisingly , simple matrix algebras are much easier to work with than type iii vonneumann factors . using the ( unique ) normalized trace , any state is given by a density matrix .",
    "recall that the adjoint maps @xmath102 in a quantum causal history are the induced maps on density matrices .",
    "suppose that @xmath151 is a density matrix at @xmath3 .",
    "the density matrix @xmath152 is the best approximation to @xmath41 among density matrices at @xmath4 , in the sense that it minimizes the trace norm of the difference .",
    "the trace norm metric on density matrices is equal to the metric on states induced by the operator norm on observables .",
    "so , we see that the obvious notion of an algebraic quantum field theory on a causal set , with the physically reasonable assumption of finite algebras on events , gives the structure of a qch .",
    "the two concepts intersect , but are not equivalent .",

    "et cetera _ and consider a field theory with infinite algebras on events ; however , depending upon the choice of algebras , even this might be described by some suitable generalization of a qch .",
    "likewise , a given qch can not necessarily be derived from an algebraic quantum field theory .",
    "this does mean that the structure of a qch encompasses a reasonable notion of a quantum field theory , and hence is capable of describing matter degrees of freedom .",
    "it also indicates how quantum fields on curved spacetime might be obtained as a limit of some quantum gravity model based on qch s .",
    "finally , this gives the skeptical reader another possible motivation for considering quantum causal histories .",
    "in this section we show that , if we start with the cp maps on the causal relations as the fundamental evolution operators , we can recover the unitary operators between the complete pairs .",

    "lemma [ reconstruction ] implies the uniqueness of the @xmath206 in axiom 1 .",
    "if @xmath15 is a complete past of @xmath26 , then if a homomorphism @xmath207 exists with the @xmath125 s ( for @xmath67 ) as its reductions , it can be reconstructed by multiplying the @xmath125 s together , so @xmath208 is unique .",
    "conversely , because of axiom 2 , we _ can _ multiply together the @xmath209 s to define @xmath208 .",

    "because all homomorphisms in this category are injective , the existence of homomorphisms in both directions between @xmath126 and @xmath69 shows that they are of equal dimension and therefore isomorphic .",
    "these homomorphisms must therefore be isomorphisms .",
    "so , @xmath212 is an isomorphism , and by theorem  [ unitary ] , @xmath210 is its inverse .",
    "the reductions of @xmath210 are the same as for @xmath208 and as it is a homomorphism , the above uniqueness implies @xmath213 .",
    "now suppose that @xmath30 .",
    "let @xmath72 and @xmath214 .",
    "by what we have proven so far , @xmath215 is a reduction of @xmath216 . by axiom 3 , @xmath217 .",
    "so , @xmath111 is a reduction of @xmath218 . by lemma [ reconstruction ] ,",
    "since the reductions are the same , we must have that @xmath219 .",
    "using lemma [ reconstruction ] again , this shows that @xmath155 .",
    "we have then shown that the system of isomorphisms associated to complete pairs can be reconstructed from the local information of cp maps associated to pairs of events .",
    "because @xmath9 is assumed to be locally finite , there is no problem in going from these isomorphisms of algebras to a system of unitary maps satisfying the original definition of a quantum causal history ; the only arbitrariness is a choice of irrelevant phase factors .    on the other hand ,",
    "the local formulation is restrictive . not",
    "every choice of unitary maps for complete pairs can be expressed in terms of cp maps in this way .",
    "this formulation enforces local causality .",
    "in this paper , we have provided a complete definition of a quantum causal history , a pre - spacetime framework for a quantum theory of gravity in which there is a simple matrix algebra of operators for every event in the universe ( represented by a causal set ) and a completely positive evolution map for every causally related pair of events .",
    "these represent the transfer of quantum information between events in the quantum spacetime .",
    "we showed that the axioms in the definition allow us to reconstruct the unitary evolution between complete pairs , a necessary step since complete pairs correspond to isolated systems .    in the picture of the universe as a qch",
    ", it can be thought of as a very large collection of quantum - mechanical building blocks .",
    "everything is ( locally ) finite , both the dimensionality of these systems as well as the causal set .",
    "we regard this as a simple way to model the idea that there is a finite number of fundamental degrees of freedom in a finite region of the universe .",
    "although there is certainly no hard evidence for this , such ideas are supported by bekenstein s arguments , by the black hole entropy calculations from both string theory and loop quantum gravity , and is related to holographic ideas and the arguments for a many - hilbert space m - theory in @xcite .",
    "even independent of such motivations , finiteness allows significant simplifications which we have been able to exploit in this paper .    it may be possible to generalize a qch to use some infinite - dimensional algebras .",
    "theorem [ main ] may extend to type ii@xmath144 vonneumann factors , which have finite traces .",
    "however , we have not investigated this possibility in detail because the physical motivations for using matrix algebras are much stronger .",
    "it is interesting to note the multiple ways that quantum causal histories can be motivated , including :    1 .   the original definition considering them as the general formalism for causal spin networks @xcite .",
    "2 .   as an algebraic quantum field theory on a causal set ( section [ qft ] ) .",
    "3 .   as an alternative to the usual quantum cosmology of a wavefunction of the universe evolving according to the wheeler - dewitt equation . a qch is a framework for quantum cosmology that is not restricted to globally hyperbolic spacetimes , as is the case with a wdw - type quantum cosmology .",
    "this is discussed in more detail in @xcite .",
    "the local evolution in a qch is well - suited for addressing the important problem of identifying localized propagating degrees of freedom in a spin foam , without having to use the entire partition function .",
    "precisely the same objects that we used ( matrix algebras and cp maps ) are basic tools in quantum information theory .",
    "conceptually , this suggests that the universe modeled as a qch is nothing but a background - independent quantum computer . more practically , the analogue of the much sought - after propagating `` particle '' in a spin foam , in quantum information theoretic language , is a quantum channel .",
    "tools such as the operator - sum representation of cp maps , and even ideas from the theory of error - correction in quantum computation , might be used to identify such objects .",
    "there is an important clarification we should make .",
    "if quantum causal histories are motivated via 2 above , then this is not gravity , but a kind of quantum field theory on a peculiar background .",
    "this is related to the issue of the _ given _ causal set that a qch is built on .",
    "if the procedure is simply `` given a causal set @xmath9 , a qch is constructed via the procedure of section [ ach ] , '' then this can not have much to do with a dynamical theory of space - time . unless , somehow , all the gravitation degrees of freedom are in the algebras and @xmath9 is some auxiliary background , but we are not aware of such a scheme . in the quantum causal histories motivated from spin foams in quantum gravity ( 4 above ) , there is an further step .",
    "the partition function for a ( causal ) spin foam model includes a sum over all causal sets .",
    "this is the usual path integral formulation of quantum gravity , with each term in the path integral being a qch .",
    "it would be very interesting to understand if there is a way for a qch to be a dynamical quantum space - time without the summation of a path integral .",
    "for this , one would need the causal set and the algebras to `` interact '' with each other .",
    "the reason why there are so many ways to understand quantum causal histories is partly the general nature of a cp map .",
    "it is , after all , the most general physical transformation allowed by quantum theory .",
    "completely positive maps already appear in several places in quantum cosmology and we close this paper by referring to a few examples .    in the context of continuous time evolution , master equations are the familiar tools used to describe quantum noise , for example in quantum optics .",
    "these are differential equations , governing the non - unitary evolution of the density matrices of dissipative quantum systems ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "when a master equation is integrated , the evolution of the density matrix for a finite time - step is given by a completely positive map .",
    "another interesting comparison is between our cp maps and decoherence .",
    "the term decoherence is used in the literature both to describe quantum noise , and the more specific process of phase damping that is believed to play a role in the emergence of classicality ( see , for example , @xcite ) . using decoherence to mean the second",
    ", we note that it is possible to incorporate processes of that type in a quantum causal history . in @xcite , an interesting scheme for describing decoherence",
    "was proposed that is closely related to quantum causal histories .    in this new formulation , with the completely positive maps as the fundamental evolution operators , we obtain a quantum cosmology in which the universe is simply a very large collection of finite quantum systems .",
    "the information gets shuffled around , according to the causal structure .",
    "local observers can lose information simply because , by causality , it is not available to them .",
    "this is much like information loss due to the presence of a horizon .",
    "finally , we note that there are several tools that can be used for the practical implementation of cp maps in a specific model .",
    "these include the operator - sum representation that is frequently used in quantum information theory ( see @xcite , chapter 8 and @xcite for excellent reviews , and , for example , @xcite for the case of dimensionality change from input to output ) , and the stinespring construction in operator algebras @xcite .",
