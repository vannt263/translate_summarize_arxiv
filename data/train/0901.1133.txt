    "while internal shocks resolve the variability and agree with other properties of grb light curves ( e.g. @xcite ) they suffers from several drawbacks .",
    "first and foremost is their low efficiency ( @xcite see however , @xcite ) .",
    "this is particularly troublesome in view of the high efficiency implied from comparison of the prompt @xmath0-rays luminosity and the kinetic energy that remains in the outflow .",
    "detailed models for the emission mechanisms of the prompt @xmath0-rays pose other problems @xcite .",
    "external shocks can produce highly variable light curves if the outflow is slowed down by small external clumps .",

    "however , this process will inevitably be inefficient @xcite as the overall covering factor of the emitting regions is @xmath1 ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the pulses and the burst s durations ) .",
    "observed values of @xmath4 are typically @xmath5 and in can be as low as @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "lyutikov & blandford ( 2002 , 2003 ) ( see also @xcite [ l05 ] , @xcite , @xcite ) proposed that variability can be recovered while maintaining high efficiently it the shell that moves with a bulk lorentz factor @xmath7 contains emitting clumps ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : kinemticmodel ] ) that move with random macroscopic relativistic velocities ( with a lorentz factor @xmath8 ) .",
    "a clump is observed only when its radiation cone ( with an opening angle of the order of @xmath9 in the lab frame ) points towards the observer .",
    "the filling factor of the clumps may be unity , recovering high efficiency .",
    "however , as only a small fraction of the clumps are observed at any given time , the light curve can show rapid variability .",
    "the overall duration of the burst , is the larger between the angular time and the shell s light crossing time ( @xmath10 ) , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the shell s radius and width respectively and @xmath13 is the light speed , allowing for emission radii much larger than @xmath14 , required in the internal shocks model .",
    "the temporal variability is then dictated by the random lorentz factor , @xmath8 , reflecting the activity of the emitting region and not those of the inner engine .",
    "while it is unclear how macroscopic random relativistic motion can be generated , we assume that it does and examine , using two simplified toy models that includes the essential ingredients , the conditions under which the temporal features of the observed light curve can be produced ( see l05 ) .",
    "we describe our first toy model , which we call here relativistic turbulence , and derive analytic constraints and numerical light curves in  [ sec : the - relativistic - turbulence ] . in  [ sec : fundamental - emitters ] we consider a second toy model proposed by lyutikov ( 2006 ) that is based on sub - jets and compare it with the first one .",

    "the emitters change their direction of motion continuously , as expected in a turbulent medium . since the emitters exhibit a coherent macroscopic motion",
    ", we require that each emitter is causally connected , and that it changes its direction on times longer than the causal time scale but shorter than the shell crossing time .",
    "the length scale of the emitter in its own rest frame , @xmath16 , is assumed to be similar in all three dimensions , and it emits isotropically in this frame .",
    "we define a dimensionless scale @xmath17 , which is the angular scale of an emitter that points towards the observer ( see inset of fig [ fig : kinemticmodel ] ) .",
    "the emitters radiate as the shell moves from @xmath18 to @xmath19 . due to the turbulent motion the positions and directions of the emitters change with time .",
    "we model this by a set of successive shells between @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "each new shell is constructed with randomly distributed emitters , representing the random changes in direction of the turbulent motion .",
    "the time difference between two shells is , @xmath20 , the time it takes for the emitters to turn an angle of @xmath21 ( in the shell frame ) .",
    "note that there are three frames : the lab frame ; the shell s frame , denoted by a prime , which is boosted radially with a lorentz factor @xmath7 relative to the lab ; and the frame of each emitter , denoted by two primes , which is boosted by ( randomly oriented ) @xmath8 relative to the shell frame .",
    "the observer is , of course , at rest relative to the lab frame .",
    "however , the observer time , namely the arrival time of photons ( denoted @xmath22 ) differs from the lab time by the usual time of flight arguments @xcite .",

    "the flux that reaches the observer from this emitter is : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the specific intensity and the second relation holds for a small enough emitter ( @xmath28 is the distance to the observer ) .",

    "define @xmath31 as the angle between the line that connects the origin and the emitter and the line that connects the origin and the observer ( see inset of fig [ fig : kinemticmodel ] ) .",
    "the maximal doppler boost , @xmath32 , is obtained for emitter at @xmath33 that moves along the line of sight .",
    "the flux decreases like @xmath34 plus a k correction .",

    "what is then the probability that an emitter at angle @xmath31 is observed , @xmath36 ?",

    "the arrival time from an emitter at @xmath42 is : @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the distance of the emitter from the front of the shell .",

    "\\(i ) the duration over which the emitter points towards the observer , namely the duration over which the direction of motion varies by an angle @xmath9 in the lab frame ( @xmath52 in the shell s frame ) .",
    "as the emitter is confined to the shell it should make at least a @xmath53 turn during @xmath54 , implying that the time to turn by @xmath52(shell s frame ) , @xmath20 , is shorter than @xmath55 .",
    "causality puts a lower limit on @xmath20 of @xmath56 .",
    "therefore : @xmath57 in the observer s frame , this translates to : @xmath58    \\(ii ) the emitter s light crossing time in the lab frame ( in the direction along the line of sight ) . for an emitter moving towards the observer",
    "this time is @xmath59 .",
    "( iii ) the angular time scale  at the largest possible angle , where the emitter is still visible by the observer , @xmath60 , the time difference between the first and the last photon would be @xmath61 .",

    "the relativistic turbulence model the emitter was radiating long before its velocity pointed towards the observer and it continues to emit long after it moves away from the observer .",
    "there is no reason ( on average ) for a difference between the rising and falling phases of an individual pulse will result in a strong signature differentiating between early and late phases of the overall light curve , which is not observed . on the other hand non - systematic variations ( e.g. , deceleration and acceleration )",
    "are expected to result in similar affects on the temporal structure of rising and decaying parts of pulses . ] .",
    "this is not a problem in the sub - jets model in which the onset of the pulse corresponds to the beginning of the activity of the emitter .",
    "( ii ) the temporal structure of the first and second halves of grb light curves are similar @xcite .",
    "the light curves produced in the two models have an overall envelope that favors stronger pulses earlier and weaker ones later .",
    "this might be resolved by a combination of several emitting shells or with very wide shells , but here fine tuning is required in the turbulent model in order to keep @xmath125 .",
    "( iii ) weaker and denser pulses ( arriving from emitters not moving directly towards the observer ) continues at @xmath128 producing the typical envelope of high latitude emission @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with rapid declines seen in some the early afterglows .",
    "however in many cases the decline is faster . in the internal shocks model",
    "this is attributed to the dominant contribution of a late pulse , that shifts the zero point of the time .",
    "such an option does not arise here unless , once more , we allow for several shells or a single wide shell .",
    "( iv ) the duration of an observed pulse is correlated with the preceding interval @xcite .",
    "there is no reason that such correlation should appear in both models .",
    "( v ) these models predict a doppler induced correlation between the intensity and @xmath129 . while stronger peaks are typically harder , it is not clear whether this specific relationship is satisfied .",
