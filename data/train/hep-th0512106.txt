    "due to such unique properties as the high intensity , high degree of collimation , and wide spectral range ( see @xcite-@xcite and references therein ) synchrotron radiation ( sr ) serves as an extraordinary research tool for advanced studies in both the fundamental and applied sciences .",
    "nowadays it is used worldwide by thousands of scientists in many disciplines like physics , chemistry , material science and structural biology .",
    "these applications motivate the importance of analyzing various mechanisms for control of sr parameters . from this point of view",
    "it is of interest to study the influence of medium on spectral and angular distributions of sr .",
    "investigations of this kind are also important for a number of astrophysical problems @xcite .",
    "the characteristics of high - energy electromagnetic processes in the presence of material are essentially changed by giving rise to new types of phenomena , the well - known examples of which are cherenkov @xcite-@xcite and diffraction radiation .",
    "the operation of many devices intended for production of electromagnetic radiation is based on interactions of relativistic electrons with matter ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .    as was shown in @xcite , where sr from a charged particle rotating in a homogeneous medium was considered",
    "( see also @xcite ) , the interference between sr and cherenkov radiation ( cr ) had interesting consequences .",
    "new interesting phenomena occur in case of inhomogeneous media .",
    "a well - known example here is the transition radiation . in particular ,",
    "the interfaces between media can be used for monitoring the flows of radiation emitted in various systems . in a series of papers initiated in @xcite-@xcite",
    "it was shown that the interference between sr and cr induced at boundaries of spherical or cylindrical configuration leads to interesting effects .",
    "investigations of radiation from a charge rotating along an equatorial orbit about / inside a dielectric ball showed @xcite that when the cherenkov condition for the ball material and particle speed is satisfied , there appear high narrow peaks in the spectral distribution of the number of quanta emitted to outer space at some specific values of the ratio of ball - to - particle orbit radii . in the vicinity of these peaks",
    "the radiated energy exceeds the corresponding value for the case of homogeneous and unbounded medium by several orders of magnitude .",
    "however in @xcite the phenomena of absorption and dispersion of electromagnetic waves inside the ball material were not taken into account . the allowance for these phenomena",
    "was made in @xcite . in the present paper",
    "a new characteristic feature of such a high power radiation was revealed and a simple model that disclosed the physical cause of its generation was suggested .",
    "it is worthwhile to point out that a similar phenomenon ( less pronounced ) takes place in the cylindrical symmetry case @xcite-@xcite .",
    "e.g. , the radiation emitted ( i ) from a longitudinal charged oscillator moving with constant drift velocity along the cylinder axis , and ( ii ) from a charged particle moving along a circle around a dielectric cylinder or ( iii )  along a helical orbit inside the cylinder are investigated in @xcite-@xcite , @xcite and @xcite-@xcite respectively .",
    "the latter type of motion is used in helical undulators for generating electromagnetic radiation in a narrow spectral interval .",
    "it is shown that under similar cherenkov condition for permittivity of cylinder and the particle speed , high narrow peaks are present in the spectral - angular distribution for the number of radiated quanta . in the vicinity of these peaks",
    "the radiated energy exceeds the corresponding value for homogeneous medium case by several orders of magnitude .",
    "the content of paper is organized as follows : in section [ section2 ]  the description of problem is given , and in section [ section3 ] the method of solution is described and the final analytical expression for the intensity of radiation from a relativistic particle rotating about a ball is given .",
    "numerical results are presented in section [ section4 ] .",
    "the characteristic features of phenomenon are discussed in section [ section5 ] .",
    "the cause of radiation amplification is established in section section6 .",
    "similar processes of amplification typical for a chain of equidistant particles / bunches , are considered in the next section . in the last section",
    "the main results of paper are summarized .",
    "now consider the uniform rotation of relativistic electron in the equatorial plane of a dielectric ball in the magnetic field in empty space ( see fig . [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the permittivity of medium is the following step function of radial coordinate r:@xmath0where @xmath1 is the radius of ball , and @xmath2 is the complex valued permittivity of the ball material .",
    "we assume that the braking of electron due to the emission of radiation is compensated by an external influence ( e.g. , the electric force ) that compels the particle to turn uniformly in a circle .",
    "it is convenient to introduce the following dimensionless quantity:@xmath3@xmath4(the number of emitted quanta ) .",
    "here w@xmath5  is the energy radiated at frequency @xmath6 during one period @xmath7 of electron gyration , @xmath8 is the harmonic number , and @xmath9  is the energy of corresponding electromagnetic wave quantum .",
    "it is known @xcite that if the space as a whole is filled with a transparent substance ( with constant @xmath10 ) then@xmath11@xmath12 ,   \\label{nkinfinity}\\]]where @xmath13  , @xmath14v@xmath15  and @xmath16  is the bessel function of integer order .",
    "the case @xmath17 of this formula corresponds to the synchrotron radiation in vacuum ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we aimed at :    * calculation of @xmath18 , when @xmath19  is the step function ( [ epsr ] ) and * demonstration that in case of weak absorption of radiation in the ball material and at special choice of the values of @xmath1  and @xmath20  , the number of emitted quanta @xmath21",

    "now consider the radiation generated by the electron at some harmonic @xmath37 , e.g. , for @xmath38 .    in fig.[fig2 ]",
    "the number @xmath39  of emitted quanta was plotted versus the ratio @xmath40  of ball to electron orbit radii .",
    "the energy and the orbit radius of the particle were taken to be @xmath41  and  @xmath42 respectively . here",
    "corresponding to the 8th harmonic is the radiation at frequency @xmath43  and wavelength @xmath44 ( in vacuum ) .",
    "the number of quanta was calculated in @xcite by formula ( [ nkball ] ) with due regard for the dispersion and dielectric losses of energy inside the substance of ball under the assumption that the ball is made of melted quartz , the value of permittivity of which is @xcite : @xmath45 according to ( [ nkinfinity ] ) the number of quanta emitted on the 8th harmonic by electron with above values of @xmath46  and @xmath47  at rotation in a continuous , infinite and transparent medium with @xmath48would be @xcite @xmath49(the horizontal dashed line in fig.[fig2 ] ) . if the particle did not rotate , but moved rectilinearly in the same medium with energy @xmath41 , then during the period of time @xmath7  it would have emitted in a narrow frequency band @xmath50 @xmath51quanta ( see , e.g. , @xcite-@xcite ) .",
    "it is evident that @xmath52 . in the absence of ball ( synchrotron radiation @xcite-@xcite ) @xmath53    according to fig.[fig2 ] , @xmath54  practically for all @xmath55 except for @xmath56  and @xmath57",
    ". there are peaks in these ranges and for the highest one    @xmath58    here more than 30-fold magnification of @xmath59  ( from  @xmath60 to @xmath61 ) is due to the forced uniform rotation of electron around the ball under the action of an external energy source .",
    "the corresponding value of ball radius @xmath62  and , consequently , the distance @xmath63  between the rotating electron and the ball surface should be @xmath64 .",
    "apparently , @xmath65    similar results may be obtained for a series of other values of @xmath66 , as well as for electrons with @xmath67  energy and balls with @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "it is significant that the condition @xmath70holds    \\(a ) only for a number of values of @xmath71  and also    \\(b ) when simultaneously the cherenkov condition @xmath72for speed v@xmath73v@xmath74  of particle `` image '' on the ball surface ( see .",
    "fig.[fig3 ] ) and the real part @xmath75 of the permittivity of ball material is satisfied .    for all peaks ( [ nkball - nkinfinity ] ) the characteristic propagation lengths @xmath76 , after passage of which the amplitude of electromagnetic oscillations decreases in @xmath77 times , are always many times greater than the ball radius:@xmath78for this reason the third condition may be formulated as :    \\(c ) inside the ball the electromagnetic oscillations may pass the distances that exceed many times the radius @xmath1  of ball ( before oscillations are absorbed or leave the boundaries of ball ) .",
    "if the electron is relativistic , then in addition to the synchrotron radiation it may also generate cherenkov radiation .",
    "its rise is attributed to the fact that the field coupled with the relativistic electron partially penetrates the ball and rotates together with the particle . at small distances from the surface of ball : @xmath79 , the speed of this field displacement inside the ball may be larger than the phase speed @xmath80  of light in the ball material , and then cr with wavelengths @xcite-@xcite @xmath81is generated inside the ball . in this section for visual explanation of numerical results given in sections [ section4],[section5 ] we shall avail of the following simplified model .",

    "fig.[fig3 ] ) .    at this instant",
    "the electron generates cr along with the synchrotron radiation , or to be more exact , generates cr pulse @xmath85 ( the wavy line ) in the vicinity of point @xmath84  inside the ball near the surface .",
    "the direction of cr is characterized by some radiation angle @xmath86 .",
    "we shall use the following ansatz that @xmath86is determined by the cherenkov condition@xmath87by analogy with the case of faster - than - light particle propagating rectilinearly in a continuous and infinite dielectric medium @xcite-10 . in ( [ costet ] ) v@xmath88v@xmath89  is the speed of particle `` image '' on the surface of ball . according to such a simplified approach",
    ", the condition b of section [ section5 ] establishes that the electron generates cr inside the dielectric ball .",
    "the pulse @xmath85  travels the distance @xmath90  to the vicinity of point @xmath91 by the surface of ball and is partially absorbed by the ball material . in ( [ costet ] )",
    "@xmath92and , consequently , at least some part of radiation with the wavelength @xmath93(according to the laws of geometrical optics ) will be subjected to an `` almost total '' internal reflection at @xmath86  angle .",
    "this process will continue till @xmath94 is totally absorbed and/or leaves the ball . at @xmath95  ( small adsorption ) the pulse @xmath96  `` will have time '' to reflect from the internal surface of ball @xmath97times and , consequently , to travel the distance @xmath98 inside the ball in agreement with condition c of the previous section . over the period of time @xmath99 , during which the oscillation amplitude in the pulse @xmath96 decreases in @xmath77 times",
    ", the electron will make @xmath100 = \\left [ \\varepsilon _ { b}^{^{\\prime } } /\\pi k\\varepsilon _ { b}^{^{\\prime \\prime } } \\right ] > > 1 \\label{number of revolution}\\]]revolutions along the orbit ( @xmath101 $ ] means the integer part of number @xmath102 ) . in this process",
    "the electron will appear in the vicinity of point @xmath83 many times at instants @xmath103 ; @xmath104 ;   @xmath105 , and",
    "its image will appear in the vicinity of point @xmath84  as much times again and each time will generate cr pulse .",
    "all  @xmath106 pulses @xmath107  with @xmath108  will propagate inside the confined space ( ball ) along identical `` trajectories '' . for the highest peak in fig.[fig2 ] @xmath109  and @xmath110    the aforesaid is applicable to each point along the electron orbit .",
    "being superimposed in the confined space ( ball ) , the electromagnetic oscillations of numerous cr pulses will , naturally , damp each other . in this case the influence of ball will be small and the total radiation will not differ strongly from the synchrotron radiation .",
    "this is precisely the case for the most values of @xmath55 ( see fig.[fig2 ] ) .",
    "however , in some special cases the deviations from such a picture are possible . these take place in ranges @xmath111  and @xmath57 shown in fig.[fig2 ] . inside these ranges at some special choice of @xmath112(cf . with condition",
    "a in section [ section5 ] ) the superposition of electromagnetic oscillations will be close to the in - phase one . in this case",
    "the total field may prove considerably more strong than that at @xmath113 .",
    "the force that brakes the gyration of electron will also increase and _ the extra work of external force compelling the electron to rotate uniformly along the orbit will be spent for generation of more powerful cr .",
    "_ this is precisely the case at @xmath114  in fig.[fig2 ] .    in section [ section4 ]",
    "we determined the values of @xmath115  from the requirement of the presence of peak , @xmath116 , by numerical calculations by formula ( [ nkball ] ) , disregarding ( [ costet ] ) and neglecting the laws of geometrical optics .    1 .",
    "thus , in general , the influence of ball on radiation from the particle is small and the total radiation differs slightly from synchrotron radiation .",
    "2 .   however , at some special values of the ratio @xmath117 high power cr will be generated .",
    "3 .   its rise is due to the fact that the electromagnetic oscillations of cr induced by the particle  along all the trajectory are partially locked inside the ball and are superimposed in nondestructive way .",
    "in 1996 and 1997 prof . wiedemann with co - workers experimentally observed a similar phenomenon for transition radiation ( tr ) from a chain of relativistic electron bunches of sub - picosecond duration from the stanford university short intense electron source ( sunshine ) .    at the output of tr radiator ( metallic foil ) the radiation from one electron bunch was directed with the help of a special system of mirrors ( influence of boundaries ) back to the radiator so , that the radiation pulse arrived there at the instant of incidence of the other electron bunch to generate new tr pulse .",
    "so , a superposition of electromagnetic pulses emitted at different moments of time took place within the formation zone of radiation .    in the case of ball",
    ", the superposition of electromagnetic pulses emitted at different moments of time also takes place in the radiation zone .",
    "however , the pulses are emitted by the same particle ( not different particles ) .",
    "[ section7.2 ]    let us consider cr from a chain of equidistant charges moving along the axis of circular section waveguide filled with transparent and nondispersive dielectric ( e.g .. , teflon in the range of wavelengths @xmath118 26,27 ) .    in fig.[fig4 ] the first charge",
    "is shown to be in point @xmath83 .",
    "let us trace the propagation of cr pulse @xmath119 induced by the first charge and emitted in small vicinity of point @xmath83 at the instant @xmath120 ( wave line in fig.[fig4 ] ) . at its propagation",
    "the pulse @xmath121  at some instant @xmath122  will cross the trajectory of charges ( axis of waveguide ) in the vicinity of some point @xmath123  at the same angle @xmath86 , at which it was emitted . at that moment @xmath119",
    "will fall behind its faster - than - light source that will be found more to the right at some point @xmath124 .",
    "the second charge of the chain is more to the left at the distance of @xmath125 from the first one and if @xmath126  it will cross the vicinity of point @xmath91  simultaneously with the pulse @xmath127 .",
    "cr pulse @xmath128 generated by the second charge in the vicinity of point @xmath91  will be formed and simultaneously interfere with @xmath119 for all @xmath129 .",
    "if the direction of cr @xmath130v@xmath131 , and the radius @xmath132 of waveguide are known , one can easily calculate the distance @xmath133of a pulse @xmath119  from its source at the instant @xmath122 .",
    "it is clear that at  @xmath134 the generation of pulses in regions adjacent to the second , third and subsequent charges will take place simultaneously with their interference with the pulses emitted earlier by charges propagating ahead of them .",
    "note , that a similar process may take place for all _ d _ multiple to the length of @xmath135 and , in particular , at @xmath136 .",
    "the superposition of pulses may be accompanied by their suppression or amplification depending on this or that value of the phase difference .",
    "for some values of @xmath137 the in - phase superimposition of oscillations is possible .",
    "analytical and numerical calculations carried out in @xcite have shown that the in - phase superposition takes place if    * @xmath138 ( the case of power quasi - monochromatic cr ) and * @xmath139  ( powerful cr in wider frequency band ) .    in both the cases the pulses",
    "are superimposed in - phase in regions directly adjacent to the radiating charges .",
    "but for all that the superimposed pulses are generated by different charges . in case of ball the pulses are emitted by the same particle .",

    "in addition to the synchrotron radiation the electron may also emit cherenkov radiation .",

    "are investigated theoretically .",

    ". e.g. , an electron of @xmath143 energy uniformly rotating at the distance of @xmath64 from the surface of fused quartz ball with radius @xmath62 will generate approximately one quantum @xmath144 of electromagnetic field at the wavelength @xmath145  ( 8th harmonic ) during one revolution ( see the highest peak in fig.fig2 ) .",
    "this value is more than 30-fold greater than the similar value  of @xmath146 for electron rotating in a continuous , infinite and transparent medium having the same real part @xmath147  of permittivity as that for the ball ( see ( [ nkbesk ] ) and the dashed line in fig.[fig2 ] ) .",
    "\\3 ) such a magnification of @xmath148 is due to the presence of external source of energy stimulating a uniform rotation of electron around the ball .",
    "it is possible only if    * the ratio between the radius of ball and that of electron orbit takes on a number of fixed values ( see , e.g. , ( [ n8ball / n8infinity ] ) ) * the cherenkov condition ( [ cherenkov ] ) for the speed of particle image  on the ball surface and the ball material is satisfied and * inside the ball the cherenkov radiation field passes the distances that are many times greater than the radius @xmath1 of ball ( before the radiation will be absorbed or leave the ball boundaries ) .",
    "\\4 ) high power radiation rises due to the fact that electromagnetic oscillations of cherenkov radiation induced by the particle along all its trajectory are partially locked inside the ball and are superimposed in nondestructive way ( section [ section6 ] ) .",
