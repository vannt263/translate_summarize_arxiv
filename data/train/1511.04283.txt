    "in a recent paper  @xcite , we performed a detailed study of the phenomenology of a supergravity model of supersymmetry breaking  @xcite , having a metastable de sitter ( ds ) vacuum with a tiny ( tunable ) cosmological constant , independent of the supersymmetry breaking scale .",
    "the model is based on a shift symmetry associated to a string modulus ( dual to a two - index tensor ) that we consider to be in the dilaton supermultiplet for definiteness , which is gauged using a vector multiplet .",
    "depending on the khler basis , the shift symmetry becomes a gauged r - symmetry that fixes the form of the superpotential as a single exponential and allows for the presence of a fayet - iliopoulos ( fi ) term .",
    "the model has thus three parameters : the strengths of the superpotential and the fi - term , and the exponent of the exponential superpotential .",
    "the first two can be tuned to fix the vacuum energy at a tiny positive value , while the latter determines the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the dilaton .",
    "the overall scale then controls the supersymmetry breaking , or equivalently the gravitino mass , driven by expectation values of both f- and d - auxiliary components of the chiral and vector multiplet .",
    "the model can be easily coupled to an observable sector containing a supersymmetric extension of the standard model ( mssm ) . to avoid anomalies  @xcite",
    ", we considered all mssm fields inert under the shift symmetry , in a khler basis where the @xmath7 is not an r - symmetry , and a constant ( modulus independent ) gauge kinetic function . in the simplest case however scalar masses are tachyonic which can be avoided , without modifying the main properties of the model , by introducing either a new ` hidden sector ' field participating in the supersymmetry breaking , similar to the polonyi field  @xcite , or dilaton dependent matter kinetic terms  @xcite . in both cases ,",
    "an extra parameter is introduced with a narrow range of values , in order to satisfy all required constraints .",
    "all scalar soft masses and trilinear a - terms are generated at the tree - level and are universal under the assumption that matter kinetic terms are independent of the ` polonyi ' field , while gaugino masses are generated at the quantum level , via the so - called anomaly mediation contributions  @xcite , and are naturally suppressed compared to the scalar masses .",
    "it follows that the low energy spectrum is very particular and can be distinguished from other models of supersymmetry breaking and mediation , such as msugra and mamsb .",
    "it consists of light neutralinos , charginos and gluinos , where the experimental bounds on the ( mostly bino - like ) lsp and the gluino force the gravitino mass to be above 15 gev and the squarks to be very heavy , with the exception of the stop which can be as light as 2 tev .    in this work ,",
    "we study the possibility that the gauged shift symmetry is identified with a known global symmetry of the standard model ( sm ) , or more generally its supersymmetric extension , keeping the nice properties of the model , namely the existence of the metastable ds vacuum with a tunable cosmological constant and a viable spectrum of superparticles consistent with all experimental constraints .",
    "a particular attracting possibility is to use a symmetry that contains the usual r - parity , or matter - parity ( depending on the khler basis ) of the mssm .",
    "we find that this is indeed possible and analyze explicitly the anomaly free symmetry @xmath8 ( when adding three right - handed neutrinos ) , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 stand for the baryon and lepton number respectively , or the combination @xmath11 which has the advantage of forbidding all dimension - four and dimension - five operators violating baryon or lepton number in mssm .",
    "it turns out that the phenomenology of these two cases is similar to the results we found in the case where sm fields are inert under the shift symmetry  @xcite , with a few minor differences , such as that the stop squark can become lighter to about 1.5 tev",
    ". actually the model contains an extra parameter , the unit of @xmath8 charge @xmath12 for the sm fields , that allows to extrapolate between the present analysis and the one of ref .",
    "it turns out though that @xmath12 is bounded from the requirement of existence of the electroweak vacuum .",
    "we also address the question if the problem of tachyonic scalar masses can be solved without adding extra field or modifying the matter kinetic terms , by appropriately choosing the transformations of the mssm fields , due to the extra d - term contribution in the scalar potential since sm fields are now charged under the @xmath7 .",
    "however , the answer turns out to be negative due to constraints arising from the existence of the usual electroweak vacuum .",
    "finally , we analyze the phenomenological implications of the extra @xmath7 and we find that its coupling is too small to have possible experimental signatures in colliders at present energies .",
    "the outline of the paper is the following . in section  2 , we present a short review of our model and give our conventions . in section  3 ,",
    "we analyze the possibility of identifying the gauged shift symmetry with the @xmath8 ; subsection  3.1 contains a short review of r - parity versus matter - parity for self - completeness , while in subsection  3.2 , we work out the model and its phenomenology ; we also comment on the case of @xmath11 but we do nt repeat the analysis , since the results are very similar . in section  4 , we consider the most general global symmetry and address the question of tachyonic scalar masses without extra field or modification of the matter kinetic terms .",
    "section  5 contains a brief summary of our results and the main conclusions . finally , there are three appendices .",
    "appendix  [ appendix : anomalies ] contains the computation of anomalies , their cancellation and the one - loop corrections to the gaugino masses . in appendix",
    "[ appendix : p2 ] , we study a possible leftover case from our past analyses , where the @xmath7 gauge kinetic term is linear ( allowed by the shift symmetry ) and the coefficient of the logarithm in the dilaton khler potential is @xmath13 ( instead of @xmath14 ) , implied by the tunability of the cosmological constant  @xcite ; we find that actually this is not a phenomenologically viable possibility . in appendix",
    "[ appendix : nonzerobeta ] we verify the assumption made in section  [ sec : other ] that the linear contribution to the gauge kinetic function is very small .",
    "in this section we review a class of metastable de sitter vacua proposed in @xcite and further analyzed in @xcite , which have a tunable ( infinitesimally small ) value of the cosmological constant and a tev gravitino mass .",
    "the minimal version of the model consists , in addition to the supergravity multiplet , of a chiral multiplet @xmath15 and a vector multiplet associated with a shift symmetry of the scalar component @xmath16 of the chiral multiplet @xmath17 the khler potential , superpotential and gauge kinetic function are given by @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are constants which can be tuned to allow for an infinitesimally small cosmological constant and a tev gravitino mass .",
    "the gauge kinetic function can in principle be any real constant @xmath21 .",
    "however , as far as the minimization of the potential is concerned , this constant can be put to 1 by a rescaling of @xmath20 .",
    "the scalar potential is given by @xmath22 where the f - term contribution is given by @xmath23 and the d - term contribution to the scalar potential is given by @xmath24 here the indices @xmath25 label the chiral multiplets , the indices @xmath26 indicate the different gauge groups and @xmath27 is the inverse of the reduced planck mass , @xmath28 tev .",
    "the khler covariant derivative and moment maps are given by @xmath29 the fayet - iliopoulos contributions @xmath30 are fixed by the relation @xmath31 where @xmath32 are the killing vectors .    for @xmath33",
    "this scalar potential always allows for an anti - de sitter ( ads ) minimum .",
    "we therefore focus on the case @xmath34 , where it was shown in @xcite that this model allows for an infinitesimally small cosmological constant @xmath35 by tuning the parameters @xmath36 such that @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the negative root of @xmath39 close to 0.23 .",
    "a problem arises when this model is used as a hidden sector for supersymmetry breaking that is then communicated to the mssm via gravity mediation : it turns out that the resulting soft scalar masses for the mssm fields are tachyonic .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that this problem can however be avoided by introducing an extra polonyi - like field @xmath40 ( see eqs .",
    "( [ model : polonyi ] ) ) or by allowing a non - canonical khler potential for the mssm superfields ( see eqs .",
    "( [ model_noncan ] ) ) , while maintaining the desirable properties of the scalar potential , such as an infinitesimally small cosmological constant and a separately tunable gravitino mass .",
    "the model including an extra polonyi - like field has a khler potential , superpotential and gauge kinetic function given by @xmath41 the scalar potential is @xmath42 where @xmath43 the role of the extra hidden sector field @xmath40 is to give a ( positive ) f - term contribution to the scalar potential , which in turn gives a positive contribution to the soft mass squared for the mssm - like fields at the cost of introducing an extra parameter @xmath44 to the model .",
    "this parameter is however very constrained : @xmath45 0.5 , 1.707 \\right [ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the lower bound arises due to an instability of the potential when the imaginary part of @xmath40 acquires a vev , and the upper bound arises from the requirement of the tunability of the scalar potential . when experimental constraints are taken into account , in particular the gluino mass lower limit , the lower bound on",
    "the parameter @xmath44 rises to about @xmath46 .",
    "a careful tuning of the parameters then allows us to obtain a tunably small and positive value of the minimum of the potential by @xmath47 + \\frac{2 \\alpha^2}{(\\alpha-1)^2 } \\frac{\\kappa^4 \\lambda}{a^2 b^2 } , \\label{polonyi : vacuum}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we focus on real @xmath48 and @xmath49 for a given @xmath44 , only one free parameter remains in the model , which can be taken to be the gravitino mass @xmath50 , given by @xmath51 the masses of the hidden sector particles ( including the gauge boson of the extra @xmath52 ) ) the shift symmetry is technically not an r - symmetry , we will continue to label it with the index @xmath53 throughout this paper . ]",

    "another possible solution to the negative scalar soft masses squared involves a non - canonical khler potential for the mssm superfields , and the model is given by @xmath56 since the low energy phenomenology of this model is comparable with the one above with an extra parameter @xmath57 instead of @xmath44 , we do not further discuss this model .    in section [ sec :",
    "b - l ] we investigate the effects of allowing a charge proportional to b - l for the mssm superfields in the model with the extra polonyi - like field , while in section [ sec : other ] we show that a third possible solution to the tachyonic masses including a d - term contribution to the scalar soft masses squared does not contain viable solutions to the rge ( renormalization group equations ) .",
    "the problem with tachyonic masses can in principle also be solved by taking a linear gauge kinetic function @xmath58 and @xmath13 in @xmath59 . however , in the appendix [ appendix : p2 ] we show that this leads to an unacceptable high value of the gravitino mass .",
    "in the context of mssm , a global r - parity is usually imposed to forbid terms in the lagrangian that may lead to proton decay .",
    "although it is widely known @xcite that r - parity can be formulated in such a way that it is not an r - symmetry in the technical sense of the word , for self - contained presentation and benefit of the reader , we remind below of this fact .",
    "the most general gauge - invariant and renormalizable superpotential for the mssm would not only include the usual terms @xmath60 but also the following baryon- and lepton - number violating interactions @xmath61 the chiral superfields carry baryon number @xmath62 for @xmath63 , @xmath64 for @xmath65 and @xmath66 for all the others .",
    "similarly , @xmath67 and @xmath68 carry lepton number @xmath69 and @xmath70 , respectively , while all other superfields have vanishing lepton number . since the baryon and lepton number violating processes ( [ deltabl ] ) are not seen experimentally , these terms should be absent ( or sufficiently suppressed ) .",
    "this is usually done by imposing that a discrete r - parity is preserved .",
    "the r - parity of a field is given by @xmath71 with @xmath16 its spin .",
    "note that the standard model particles and higgs bosons carry @xmath72 , while the sparticles ( squarks , sleptons , gauginos and higgsinos ) have @xmath73 .",
    "also , since every interaction vertex contains an even number of @xmath74 particles , this implies that the lightest sparticle ( lsp ) with @xmath75 must be absolutely stable .",
    "if this lsp interacts only weakly with ordinary matter it can be an excellent dark matter candidate .",
    "note also that since the different fields of the same multiplet carry a different r - parity , this symmetry does not commute with supersymmetry .",
    "although this assignment appears to be quite natural in a supersymmetric context , it should be stressed that one can equivalently forbid the terms ( [ deltabl ] ) by imposing conservation of matter parity @xcite .",
    "the matter parity @xmath76 of a superfield ( as opposed to r - parity , which is defined separately on each component field ) is defined as @xmath77 note that since the matter parity of all fields within a given supermultiplet is the same , this symmetry does commute with supersymmetry .",
    "since for the scalar components ( @xmath78 ) the matter parity is the same as the r - parity , it is completely equivalent to impose either matter parity or r - parity as a symmetry on the theory .",
    "moreover , r - parity and matter parity only differ by the fermion number , which is an exact parity symmetry by itself .",
    "we conclude that imposing matter parity or r - parity is completely equivalent .",
    "while the r - parity interpretation can be useful to easily abstract its phenomenological consequences , from a model building point of view it is far more natural to impose matter parity ( [ matterparity ] ) , since ( in contrast with r - parity ) it commutes with supersymmetry .",
    "in fact , since r - parity is equivalent to the ( non - r ) matter parity , this shows that there is nothing intrinsically r about r - parity .",
    "matter parity is nothing else but @xmath79 , it therefore seems an obvious choice in our context to see whether one can consistently use it as the @xmath7 symmetry we need in our toy model of supersymmetry breaking , by giving a charge proportional to @xmath8 to the mssm superfields , as to exclude also the terms ( [ deltabl ] ) from the superpotential and thus taking over the role of r - parity .    it should however be noted that in principle one can also have dimension 5 operators that violate baryon and/or lepton number ( see for example @xcite and references therein ) @xmath80 here the various couplings @xmath81 have inverse mass dimensions and can be generated by a high - energy microscopic theory , such as a supersymmetric grand unified theory or string theory . while r - parity forbids the terms in the last line of eq .",

    "however , in contrast with a gauged @xmath8 which can be made anomaly - free upon the inclusion of three right - handed neutrinos , a gauged @xmath11 contains a cubic @xmath86 , and mixed @xmath87 and @xmath88 anomalies which should be canceled by a green - schwarz mechanism .      as discussed above",
    ", we now explore the possibility to give the mssm superfields ( denoted by @xmath89 ) a charge @xmath90 under the extra @xmath52 , proportional to @xmath8 , extending the model  ( [ model : polonyi ] ) .",
