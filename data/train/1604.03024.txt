    "the ( generalized ) korteweg - de vries equation @xmath2 is a basic model in the theory of water waves .",
    "in fact , this is one of the most ubiquitous models in the theory of partial differential equations , modeling the unidirectional motion of waves in shallow water .",
    "its cauchy problem has been comprehensively studied in the last 50 years .",
    "our interest is in a related model , which takes into account the effect of a ( small ) rotation force acting on the fluid .",
    "more specifically , @xmath3 note that we consider on a finite nterval , with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the problem on the whole line case certainly makes sense physically , as an approximation of situations where the motion takes place on long intervals .",
    "we will however only consider the periodic case henceforth .",
    "we refer to as the regularized short pulse equation ( rspe ) , when @xmath4 . in @xcite",
    "the authors have constructed traveling wave solutions of on the whole line by employing variational methods .",
    "they have also studied the stability of such solutions by following the grillakis - shatah - strauss arguments .",
    "further results on the stability of these traveling waves were obtained in @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors have constructed pulse solutions of , for small values of @xmath5 , via singular perturbation theory . in @xcite , they have shown the existence of multi - pulse solutions .",
    "the stability of these waves remains an interesting open problem .",
    "an interesting special model occurs in the absence of a kdv regularization - in other words , @xmath6 .",
    "this is referred to in the literature , depending on the form of the non - linearity @xmath7 , as the reduced ostrovsky or ostrovsky - hunter or short pulse model .",
    "namely , after scaling all parameters to one , we have @xmath8 the model , with various form of the nonlinearity has rich history , most of it unrelated to the its connections to kdv .",
    "ostrovsky , @xcite in the late 70 s has introduced the first model of this sort . in the early 90 s , vakhnenko , @xcite proposed an alternative derivation , while hunter , @xcite proposed some numerical simulations .",
    "the well - posedness questions were investigated by boyd , @xcite ; schaefer and wayne , @xcite ; stefanov - shen - kevrekidis , @xcite .",
    "liu , pelinovsky and sakovich , @xcite have studied wave breaking , which was later supplemented by the global regularity results for small , in appropriate sense data , of grimshaw - pelinovsky , @xcite .",
    "there are numerous works on explicit traveling wave solutions of these models , @xcite .",
    "one should note that some of this solutions are not classical solutions , but rather a multi - valued ones , @xcite .",
    "several authors have also explored the integrability of the ostrovsky equation , @xcite . in particular , they have managed to construct the traveling waves by means of the inverse scattering transform . in this regard ,",
    "it is worth mentioning the very recent work @xcite , where the authors study small periodic waves of the quadratic and cubic models in the form .",
    "they show orbital stability of such waves ( with respect to all subharmonic perturbations ! ) by adapting the methods of @xcite for periodic waves of the defocussing cubic nls .",
    "their proof makes sense of a representation of these waves as unconstrained minimizers of appropriate functionals .",
    "another recent development in the area is our recent paper , @xcite , which gives an explicit construction of peakon type solutions and establishes their stability .",
    "our main interest in this paper is the stability of explicit traveling waves for the short pulse equation . more precisely , we follow the recent work of @xcite , who construct the solutions of , for @xmath9 , in terms of jacobi elliptic functions , after a ( solution dependent ) change of variables .",
    "we consider these solutions and we show their spectral stability with respect to co - periodic perturbations ( i.e. with respect of perturbations of the same period ) . in addition , we construct a family of explicit solutions in the cubic case as well .",
    "their spectral stability for co - periodic perturbations is established as well . in all our considerations ,",
    "we consider the linearized problems after the change of variables , where we get eigenvalue problems in the form @xmath10 where @xmath11 is a second order hill operator , subject to periodic boundary conditions .",
    "clearly , is a non - standard eigenvalue problem , for which we develop appropriate methods to study its stability .",
    "we now continue on to derive the profile equations and the linearized equations .",
    "as we have alluded above , we consider with quadratic and cubic non - linearity .",
    "even though , one can mostly proceed to derive the profile equation with the general non - linearity @xmath12 , we prefer to use the explicit form in the two cases , since the specific , solution dependent transformation ( see @xcite ) , depends in a significant way on the particular form of @xmath7 .      in order to derive the profile equations ,",
    "we follow the approach of @xcite .",
    "our first consideration is the quadratic model @xmath13 , the so - called ostrovsky equation .",
    "it reads @xmath14 using the traveling wave ansatz , @xmath15 , for an unknown periodic function @xmath16 , we arrive at the ode , @xmath17 clearly , , being a fully nonlinear equation , is not a very nice object to deal with .",
    "thus , we perform a ( solution dependent ) change of variables , namely @xmath18 if @xmath16 is an even function , so is @xmath19 and then naturally @xmath20 is an odd function .",
    "compute @xmath21 so that @xmath22 thus , @xmath23 . taking another derivative in @xmath24 ,",
    "@xmath25 we are thus lead to the profile equation @xmath26 clearly , is a standard schrdinger equation , which is much easier to study .",
    "we do so in section [ sec:3 ] below , where an explicit expression for @xmath19 is found .",
    "one has to keep in mind however , that the solutions of are equivalent , so long as the transformation is invertible .",
    "this is clearly requiring that the function @xmath27 is monotone or equivalently , from , that either @xmath28 for each @xmath29 $ ] or @xmath30 for each @xmath29 $ ] .",
    "if that is the case , we have an interval @xmath31 $ ] , so that @xmath32\\to [ -l , l]$ ] is a diffeomorphism and the profile equation has to be considered with periodic boundary conditions on @xmath31 $ ] .    our next task is to derive the linearized problem for such solutions @xmath16 - assuming that they exist and the transformation is invertible in the appropriate interval . to this end , we take the ansatz @xmath33 in and ignore all quadratic terms . we obtain the following linearized equation @xmath34 next , we turn into an eigenvalue problem , by letting @xmath35 $ ] .",
    "this results in @xmath36 note that guarantees that @xmath37 is an exact derivative , which justifies our next change of variables @xmath38 . here",
    ", we can assume that @xmath39 .",
    "this can be of course always be achieved and in fact , it fixes the function @xmath40 .",
    "thus , we reduce matters to @xmath41 an integration in @xmath24 ( and taking into account that @xmath42 ) allows us to transform the last equation into the equivalent one @xmath43 indeed , in the last equation , the constant of integration is zero , since we have an exact derivative on the left - hand side and a function of mean value zero on the right - hand side .",
