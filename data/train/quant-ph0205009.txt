    "interplay between classical information and quantum state shows non - trivial and remarkable aspects when quantum entanglement is involved . in quantum teleportation @xcite , one qubit in an unknown quantum state",
    "can be transmitted from a sender ( alice ) to a receiver ( bob ) by a maximally entangled quantum channel and two classical bit ( cbit ) communication . in order to teleport a quantum state in a @xmath0-dimensional space , @xmath1 qubits",
    ", alice needs to transmit @xmath2 cbits of classical information to bob .",
    "this is actually the minimum amount of classical communication , which can be shown by combining teleportation protocol with another striking scheme utilizing quantum entanglement , superdense coding @xcite .    in teleportation",
    ", neither alice nor bob acquires any classical knowledge on teleported states .",
    "the teleportation protocol is said to be oblivious to alice and bob . in remote state preparation ( rsp )",
    ", however , it is assumed that alice has complete classical knowledge on the state that is to be prepared by bob @xcite .",
    "the central concern has been whether quantum and classical resources can be reduced by alice s knowledge on the state . in this respect",
    ", lo has conjectured that rsp for a general state requires at least as much as classical communication as teleportation @xcite .",
    "an experimental implementation of rsp scheme has also been reported @xcite .",
    "recently , leung and shor @xcite showed that the same amount of classical information as in teleportation needs to be transmitted from alice to bob in any deterministic and exact rsp protocol that is oblivious to bob . here the assumption that a protocol is oblivious to bob means specifically two things : first , the probability that alice sends a particular classical message to bob , does not depend on the state to be transmitted .",
    "second , after bob s quantum operation to restore the state , the ancilla system contains no information on the prepared state .    in this paper",
    "we will study exact and deterministic rsp protocols for a general state , but not necessarily oblivious to bob .",
    "first we will show that bob s quantum operation can be assumed to be a unitary transformation .",
    "we then derive an equation that is a necessary and sufficient condition for such a protocol to exist . by studying this equation ,",
    "we show that in order to remotely prepare one qubit in a general state , alice needs to transmit 2 cbits of classical information to bob , which is the same amount as in teleportation , even if the protocol is not assumed oblivious to bob . for a general dimensional case ,",
    "it is still open whether the amount of classical communication can be reduced by abandoning oblivious conditions .",
    "in this paper we only consider rsp protocols that are exact and deterministic .",
    "the diagram of protocol is depicted in fig . 1 .",
    "the prior - entangled state shared by alice and bob is assumed to be a maximally entangled state in space ab defined by @xmath3 where system a and b are @xmath0-dimensional hilbert spaces , with an orthonormal basis @xmath4 .",
    "writing @xmath5 , we note that @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "given a pure state @xmath8 randomly chosen from an input state space of @xmath0 dimension , alice performs a povm measurement on system a with @xmath9 possible outcomes : @xmath10 remember that since alice is assumed to have complete knowledge of state @xmath8 , the dependence of povm elements @xmath11 on @xmath12 is not limited .",
    "the probability for alice to obtain outcome @xmath13 is given by @xmath14 in this paper we do not assume the probability @xmath15 is independent of @xmath12 , implying the protocol may not be oblivious to bob . with outcome @xmath13 ,",
    "bob s system b is given by @xmath16 receiving a classical message @xmath13 ( @xmath17 ) from alice , bob performs a trace - preserving quantum operation @xmath18 on his subsystem b to restore the state @xmath8 : @xmath19",
    "in this section we will show that bob s quantum operation @xmath18 is actually a unitary operation @xmath20 , if the rsp protocol works for any state @xmath8 .",
    "first we observe the following theorem .",
    "let @xmath21 be a trace preserving quantum operation .",
    "if for any state @xmath8 there exists a density operator @xmath22 such that @xmath23 , then the quantum operation @xmath21 is a unitary operation @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is a unitary operator .    before proving the theorem , we note two general properties of density operator , which will be used in the proof .",
    "the first one is that if @xmath26 , then @xmath27 and @xmath28 are identical and pure , which can be shown by the cauchy - schwarz inequality .",
    "next , let @xmath29 be a density operator of a system consisting of subsystems q and r. then the second property used in the proof is that if @xmath30 is pure , then @xmath31 , where @xmath32",
    ". this can be seen by observing subadditivity and the triangle inequality of von neumann entropy @xmath33 , by which we find @xmath34 this means that equality in subadditivity holds as @xmath35 , which is true only if @xmath31 .",
    "now we will prove the theorem given in the above .    in the unitary model of a quantum operation ,",
    "the assumption in the theorem is stated as follows : for any @xmath8 there exists a density operator @xmath22 such that @xmath36 where @xmath37 is a standard pure state of ancillary system e and @xmath38 is a unitary operator on the combined system . as we have noted , if a subsystem is pure after tracing out the ancilla system , it is already pure in the combined system and therefore we have @xmath39 we will show that @xmath40 is actually pure and independent of @xmath12 . introducing an orthonormal basis @xmath4 , we write @xmath41 multiplying the above eq.([eq_k ] ) of index @xmath42 with the one of index @xmath43 and taking trace of the product , we find @xmath44 this equation implies that the @xmath0 density operators @xmath45 s have orthogonal supports in the @xmath0-dimensional space .",
    "this is possible only if @xmath46 , where the set @xmath47 is an orthonormal basis of the space .",
    "we also find that @xmath48 is pure , since @xmath49 .    in the same way as we obtained eq.([eq_kl ] ) , we find @xmath50 summing this equation over @xmath42 and using @xmath51 , we obtain @xmath52 which implies that @xmath53 is pure and given by @xmath54 from this we conclude that @xmath48 is independent of @xmath42 and furthermore @xmath53 for a general @xmath8 has no state dependence either .",
    "writing @xmath55 , we thus have @xmath56 sandwiching this between @xmath57 and @xmath37 gives @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "it is clear that the operator @xmath25 must be a unitary operator since @xmath61 is a density operator for any state @xmath8 . since eq.([eq_uni ] ) holds for any @xmath8 , we conclude that the quantum operation @xmath62 is a unitary operation : @xmath63 @xmath64    now remember that bob receives classical message @xmath65 from alice and performs a quantum operation @xmath18 on the state @xmath66 to restore the state @xmath8 that alice wants him to prepare : @xmath67 since this should hold for any state @xmath8 , by the theorem we have just proved , @xmath18 turns out to be a unitary operation : @xmath68 where @xmath69 is unitary .",
    "we also note that we did not assume @xmath70 , the state of ancilla system e after bob s quantum operation , is independent of @xmath8 ( oblivious condition ) .",
    "but it was shown that @xmath70 should be independent of @xmath8 in the proof of the theorem .",
    "now that we have shown that bob s quantum operation is a unitary operation , we can derive an equation that is a necessary and sufficient condition for rsp protocols .    from eq.([eq_pm ] ) and eq.([eq_rhom ] ) , we obtain @xmath71 which means that the density operator of system b should not change by alice s povm measurement on system a as long as an outcome of the measurement is unspecified . using the result from the preceding section @xmath72 , we get @xmath73 here @xmath69 s are unitary and @xmath15 is the probability of outcome @xmath13 of alice s povm measurement , therefore @xmath74 and @xmath75 . and we note that this should hold for any state @xmath8 .",
    "it is important that eq.([eq_rspb ] ) is also a sufficient condition for rsp protocols .",
    "let us assume that eq.([eq_rspb ] ) holds in space b for some unitary operators @xmath69 s and for some probability distribution @xmath15 , then the same equation holds also in space a : @xmath76 since the dimension is the same for spaces a and b , where we wrote @xmath77 for convenience . here for a state @xmath78",
    ", we introduce the state @xmath79 defined as @xmath80 .",
    "then it is clear that the following relation also holds : @xmath81 from this relation we can construct povm measurement elements as @xmath82 evidently each @xmath83 is a positive operator and @xmath84 . since alice is assumed to be given complete classical knowledge on state @xmath8 , she can in principle implement this povm measurement .",
    "the probability of an outcome @xmath13 is calculated as @xmath85 . and with an outcome being given by @xmath13 , the resultant state of b is given by @xmath86 receiving classical message @xmath13 from alice",
    ", bob can restore the state @xmath8 by a single unitary operation as @xmath87 .",
    "thus eq.([eq_rspb ] ) is a necessary and sufficient condition for rsp protocols and will be called rsp equation hereafter in this paper .",
    "we will study the rsp equation ( [ eq_rspb ] ) , which is a necessary and sufficient condition for rsp protocols : @xmath88 here superscripts a or b are omitted , since the equation should hold in either @xmath0-dimensional space .",
    "first we study the case that the probability @xmath15 is independent of @xmath8 , which is assumed in the paper by leung and shor @xcite .",
    "we write the @xmath89-element of eq.([eq_rsp ] ) explicitly : @xmath90 where @xmath91 s are amplitudes of @xmath8 , @xmath92 .",
    "it is convenient to introduce an @xmath9 by @xmath93 matrix @xmath94 by @xmath95 and we can further rewrite eq.([eq_explicitrsp ] ) as @xmath96 remember that @xmath91 s are arbitrary apart from the normalization condition and the matrix @xmath94 is assumed to be independent of @xmath91 . therefore the matrix @xmath97 must be a unit matrix : @xmath98 .",
    "this implies the rank of @xmath94 is @xmath93 and consequently @xmath99 .",
    "therefore the minimum amount of classical information , that alice needs to transmit to bob , is at least @xmath100 cbits in this oblivious case .",
    "this is the same amount of classical information as the one in the teleportation . in the case of @xmath101",
    ", @xmath102 implies @xmath103 , from which we obtain @xmath104 therefore solutions are given by a set of unitary operators that are complete and orthonormal with respect to the hilbert - schmidt inner product .",
    "as shown by leung and shor @xcite , this gives a teleportation protocol , which is also oblivious to alice .",
    "this is because alice s povm measurement eq.([eq_povm ] ) can be implemented as a state - independent projective measurement on a combined system of a and input space i : @xmath105 where @xmath106 and it is easy to verify that @xmath107 are complete and orthogonal projectors .",
    "one of the sets of @xmath69 s satisfying eq.([eq_trum ] ) are shift operators in coordinate and momentum spaces @xcite : @xmath108 where operators @xmath109 and @xmath110 are defined as @xmath111 and `` momentum '' eigenstates @xmath112 s are given by @xmath113    next we will study the case the probability @xmath15 may depend on the state @xmath8 that is to be remotely prepared .",
    "the question is whether this dependence can reduce the minimum amount of classical communication . in the case of one qubit rsp ( @xmath114 )",
    ", we will show that this is not the case : the minimum amount of classical information turns out to be @xmath115 cbits as in teleportation .",
    "unfortunately for general dimension @xmath0 , however , we have only limited results : the rsp equation ( [ eq_rsp ] ) immediately tells us that @xmath116 , which is known as holevo s bound @xcite , since the equation requires that @xmath117 is complete in the @xmath0-dimensional space .",
    "we can also show that @xmath118 .",
    "suppose that the rsp equation ( [ eq_rsp ] ) holds for @xmath119 . generally in a @xmath0-dimensional space ,",
    "the relation @xmath120 is satisfied if and only if the states @xmath121 s are orthonormal .",
    "therefore when @xmath122 , the inner product @xmath123 should vanish for any @xmath8 , implying @xmath124 .",
    "this , however , contradicts unitarity of @xmath69 s .",
    "now we return to the qubit case ( @xmath0=2 ) .",
    "the bloch sphere representation is convenient for a pure qubit state @xmath125 : @xmath126 where @xmath127 is a 3-dimensional unit vector and @xmath128 and @xmath129 are the pauli matrices .",
    "we also introduce a 3 by 3 rotation matrix @xmath130 for each unitary operator @xmath69 through @xmath131 the rsp equation is then reduced to @xmath132 which should hold for any unit vector @xmath127 and we emphasize again that the probability @xmath133 may depend on @xmath127 .",
    "it can be readily seen that if eq.([eq_rspn ] ) holds for a set of rotation matrices @xmath130 and some probability @xmath134 , it is also satisfied by a set of transformed rotations @xmath135 , with @xmath33 and @xmath136 being any rotation matrices , and the probability @xmath137 . with this freedom",
    ", we can safely assume that @xmath138 is a unit matrix , @xmath139 is a rotation about the @xmath140 axis , and @xmath141 is a rotation about an axis in the @xmath142 plane .    now suppose that eq.([eq_rspn ] ) holds for @xmath143 and take @xmath144 ( the unit vector along the @xmath140 axis ) , then we find @xmath145 since @xmath146 is a probability distribution , this equation is satisfied only when @xmath147 , namely @xmath141 is a rotation of @xmath148 about the @xmath149 axis . by a similar argument with @xmath150 ( the unit vector along the @xmath149 axis ) , @xmath139 turns out to be a rotation of @xmath148 about the @xmath140 axis .",
    "therefore , for a general unit vector @xmath151 , eq.([eq_rspn ] ) with @xmath143 takes the following matrix form : @xmath152 this equation has only a trivial solution @xmath153 for @xmath127 with @xmath154 , since the determinant of the matrix in the equation is @xmath155 .",
    "thus we conclude that in order to remotely prepare a general qubit state ( @xmath114 ) , alice needs to transmit @xmath156 cbits of classical information to bob .",
    "in this paper we studied rsp schemes without assuming the protocol is oblivious to bob .",
    "bob s quantum operation was shown to be just a unitary operation , if the protocol works for a general state . in this sense ,",
    "bob s operation is necessarily oblivious to himself .",
    "using this fact we have derived the rsp equation , which is a necessary and sufficient condition for such an rsp protocol to exist . by studying this equation , it was shown that in order to remotely prepare one qubit in a general state , alice needs to transmit 2 cbits of classical information to bob , which is the same amount as in teleportation , even if the protocol is not assumed oblivious to bob .",
    "so , for one - qubit rsp , lo s conjecture @xcite has been proved without oblivious conditions .",
    "unfortunately generalization to higher dimensions is not straightforward . though it is not yet clear whether the amount of classical communication can be reduced by abandoning oblivious conditions in higher dimensions .",
    "we believe that the rsp equation will be a key to obtain some insights for further study in this direction .    in this paper the input ensemble , from which the state @xmath8 is randomly chosen ,",
    "is assumed to be the entire hilbert space of @xmath0 dimensions .",
    "we remark that if the state is chosen from a sub - ensemble of the space , the rsp equation should still hold in the sub - ensemble , as long as bob s action can be assumed to be a unitary operation . in the case of qubits on the equatorial circle of the bloch sphere",
    "@xcite , the rsp equation ( [ eq_rspn ] ) with @xmath157 is satisfied as @xmath158 where @xmath127 is a unit vector on the equator , @xmath138 is a unit matrix , and @xmath139 is a rotation of @xmath148 about the @xmath159 axis .",
    "generalizations of the equator and the polar great circle to higher dimensions have been discussed by zeng and zhang @xcite .",
    "we can also verify that corresponding rsp equations with @xmath119 are satisfied for those ensembles ."
