    "<S> the mpge is a photocurrent generation driven by absorption of radiation in qws in the presence of a magnetic field .  </S>",

    "<S> for the boltzmann distribution of carriers relevant to experiments at room temperature the mpge current is proportional to @xmath32 but independent of the electron mobility .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite thus , in order to compare the sia and bia contributions to mpge in different samples it is sufficient to normalize the photocurrents by the electron density @xmath32 .    </S>",

    "<S> ( [ mpge_second ] ) demonstrating that the longitudinal current in this experimental geometry is solely due to bia and the transverse current is caused by sia only . in additional experiments </S>",
    "<S> we applied the magnetic field @xmath52 along the @xmath53-direction . </S>",
    "<S> we observed that while the data on the transverse current remained the same the longitudinal photocurrent inverted its sign in all samples . </S>",
    "<S> this observation is also in agreement with eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ phen0 ] ) yielding for @xmath54 that the photocurrent is given by @xmath55 and @xmath56 .    </S>",
    "<S> the fact that the longitudinal current in both experimental geometries is independent of @xmath49 is expected for bia - induced effects which are obviously insensitive to the magnitude and the sign of @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> the transverse current , in contrast , is caused by sia and is very sensitive to the impurity potential . </S>",
    "<S> the variation of @xmath49 affects the degree of asymmetry and even changes the sign of the transverse photocurrent due to sia for @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> our results show that for @xmath57 the asymmetry is dominated by the potential of impurities placed on the left ( substrate ) side of the qw . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig2]b demonstrates that in order to obtain a vanishing value of sia ( 001)-oriented samples must be asymmetrically doped , so that the @xmath5-doping layer on the substrate side is placed at a larger distance than that to the right of the qw ( @xmath58 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this observation is attributed to the segregation of si - impurities during the structure growth and is in contrast to ( 110)-grown structures , where symmetrical doping results in a vanishing sia .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite this essential difference stems from the difference in growth conditions . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the growth temperature of high - quality ( 001)-oriented qws is typically higher than 600@xmath30c , while ( 110)-structures are grown at 480@xmath30c .  @xcite the high growth temperature of ( 001)-oriented heterostructures leads to substantial dopant migration in the growth direction during the growth process ( segregation ) which affects mostly the substrate side of a qw and results in sia in symmetrically doped qws . in order to suppress the segregation we grew a symmetrically doped sample with reduced temperature during the @xmath5-doping ( @xmath59c ) </S>",
    "<S> we find in this case that the mpge current perpendicular to @xmath52 , which is caused solely by sia , is almost equal to zero . </S>",
    "<S> thus , our result clearly demonstrates that the reduced growth temperature suppresses segregation , which , therefore , does not introduce additional structure inversion asymmetry .    </S>",
    "<S> the next important observation is that for @xmath60 ( sample 4 ) and @xmath61 ( samples 6 and 7 ) @xmath62 ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2]a ) indicating that sia and bia have equal strengths . in such samples </S>",
    "<S> the effects due to sia and bia , e.g. band spin - splitting , cancel each other in either @xmath63 $ ] or [ 110 ] crystallographic directions depending on the relative sign of sia and bia terms .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for the transverse photocurrent caused by magnetic field applied along one of @xmath64-axes the phenomenological theory yields @xmath65 , where the two signs correspond to the two magnetic field orientations . at @xmath66 </S>",
    "<S> one can expect substantial difference in transverse photocurrents at @xmath67 applied along [ 1@xmath680 ] and [ 110 ] . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , this anisotropy was observed : e.g. in sample  4 characterized by close sia and bia strengths we found that the transversal signal changes its magnitude by a factor of six under rotation of in - plane magnetic field @xmath69 by 90 degrees .    </S>",
    "<S> to conclude , we investigated sia and bia in ( 001)-oriented gaas / algaas qws at room temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the observed modulation of the sia / bia - ratio by a shift of the doping position demonstrates that the impurity position plays an important role in the sia . </S>",
    "<S> we show that high growth temperatures of high - quality ( 001)-oriented gaas qws add an additional factor to the sia due to impurity segregation . </S>",
    "<S> our measurements based on the mpge demonstrate that this method can be successfully applied to study sia and bia in qw structures . </S>",
    "<S> we emphasize that the method can be applied even at room temperature , where many other methods can not be used . by investigating samples with a different @xmath5-doping profile we obtained qws with almost equal magnitudes of rashba and dresselhaus constants which should be characterized by extraordinary long spin relaxation times .    </S>",
