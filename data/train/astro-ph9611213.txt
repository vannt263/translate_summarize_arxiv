    "the ryle telescope ( rt ) is being used to carry out a major programme of observations of sunyaev - zeldovich ( s - z ) decrements @xcite towards clusters of galaxies .",
    "this interferometer array consists of 8 , 13-m diameter dishes , currently operating at 15 ghz with a 50-k system temperature , and a 350-mhz bandwidth correlator .",
    "interferometers have certain advantages over switched - beam instruments for observations of cmb anisotropy , such as the filtering - out of much of the atmospheric noise , the lack of need for highly stable amplifiers because only correlated power is measured , and the fact that contaminating radiosources can be recognised and subtracted using the longer baselines at the same time and at the same frequency as the s - z signal is measured  see e.g. @xcite ad infinitum .",
    "the rt itself has two features that make it particularly suitable for s - z work .",
    "first , its dishes are small : observations at cm - wavelengths are required to make the source contamination manageable , and the angular scales of s - z decrements thus imply small baselines .",
    "second , the achievement of very long integrations without systematic offsets was a critical goal throughout all stages of the signal - processing design and construction .",
    "our main s - z programme is targetting an unbiased sample of rosat - selected clusters with x - ray luminosities @xmath4 w ( 0.5 - 2.5 kev ) and with source contamination at 15 ghz of less than 5 mjy . to date we have successful observations of a dozen clusters ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "i would like to stress that there are of course firm s - z detections from other instruments , including the ovro 40-m ( e.g. @xcite ) , the ovro 5-m @xcite , the ovro interferometer @xcite and suzie @xcite .",
    "there is agreement in observation from a range of techniques , and the business of s - z observation has moved on from its checkered history to a stage at which observation , though still challenging , is secure .",
    "a key feature of s - z astronomy is that , for a given integral of pressure @xmath5 along the line - of - sight through the cluster , the decrement is independent of redshift @xmath6 . given that the x - ray surface brightness is a line integral involving @xmath7 rather than @xmath8 , combination of x - ray image , s - z image and @xmath9 ( from x - ray spectroscopy ) gives the line - of - sight depth through the cluster . if one can turn this length into one in the plane of the sky , then , knowing @xmath6 and the angular size , one has a determination of @xmath0 .",
    "the effect of the uncertainty in the change of view from the 90-degree turn is reduced if a suitable sample of clusters is used ; the best estimate of @xmath0 is then the geometric mean of the estimates for each cluster .",
    "this is one reason why our s - z programme concentrates on clusters selected by x - ray luminosity .    in practice",
    ", we fit a king profile for @xmath8 to the x - ray image to give a best - fit gas distribution , simulate the visibilities the rt would measure from this distribution as a function of @xmath0 , and compute the likelihood function for @xmath0 .",
    "details of the method are given in @xcite , which describes its application to a2218 .",
    "a2218 seemed to us a sensible choice as our first target for this type of analysis .",
    "it is almost circular in projection , so that there is reason to assume its size may be similar along the line - of - sight .",
    "it contains no cooling flow .",
    "indeed , on the scales to which the rt is sensitive , it is isothermal and is fitted well by a king distribution .",
    "we obtained a value for @xmath0 of @xmath10  km  s@xmath11  mpc@xmath11 .",
    "the individual errors ( see below ) have been combined in quadrature .",
    "we have applied these methods to another cluster in our sample , a1413 at @xmath12 .",
    "its s - z decrement and other properties are described in @xcite .",
    "it differs from a2218 in two ways .",
    "it has a cooling flow . and",
    "it is elliptical in projection , with an axial ratio of 1.3 .",
    "we are engaged in developing more - sophisticated methods for handling such clusters , but i report here the result of what i emphasise is our first attempt ( see @xcite ) to measure @xmath0 from a1413 .",
    "the error budget is as follows ( all errors are 1-@xmath13 ) .",
    "there is an error in @xmath0 of 5% from the 3c48/3c286 calibrators ( including variability ) , 25% from rt noise , 10% from source subtraction , 12% from the asca estimate of @xmath9 , and perhaps 4% from a kinetic s - z contribution .",
    "we allow the line - of - sight length to vary between the extreme projected values .",
    "finally there is the issue of gas clumping : the cooling flow implies clumping , and simulations by steve allen ( private communication ) imply the gas temperature may be underestimated by as much as 1 kev , corresponding to an underestimate of @xmath0 by up to 10% . with all errors combined in quadrature , we find from a1413 that @xmath0=@xmath14 km s@xmath11 mpc@xmath11 .",
    "it is worth noting that both a2218 and a1413 ( despite its cooling flow ) have `` well - behaved '' x - ray properties on the relevant angular scales .",
    "we have not so far been able to make @xmath0 determinations for other clusters in our sample because of the lack of available x - ray observations , though this situation is fortunately changing .",
    "our best estimate of @xmath0 is thus the geometric mean of the values for the two clusters .",
    "it will come as no surprise to many ( see @xcite ) that this is 42 .",
    "the redshift - independence of s - z has an even more direct implication : if they exist , one should indeed be able to detect clusters that are too distant to be seen optically or in x - rays .",
    "sunyaev ( see e.g.@xcite ) has long emphasised that deep observation of a patch of sky should reveal an `` integrated '' s - z effect from distant clusters .",
    "the observational difficulty is that there are no telescopes with the requisite combination of sensitivity and field of view to have a significant chance of detecting a ( proto- ) cluster in one pointing .",
    "we therefore have used the rt to look in the directions of three radio - quiet quasars which , for different reasons , we judged may lie in clusters .",
    "we found a decrement towards one of these systems , the quasar pair pc1643 + 4631a&b which have redshifts of 3.79 and 3.83 and lie 198  apart ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the 6-@xmath13 detection is shown in fig .",
    "1 . the signal is consistently present in different phase and primary - beam pointings and in time - splits of the data , and checks reveal no correlator offsets .",
    "what kind of system might produce this decrement ?",
    "such an s - z signal from the rt gives a _ lower _ limit to the line integral of pressure through the ( proto- ) cluster .",
    "this is because the least - massive system that can produce such an s - z effect is one which just fills the synthesised beam : if the cluster is smaller than the beam , there is beam dilution and the `` true '' s - z effect and hence cluster mass increase ; if the cluster is bigger than the beam , the cluster tends to be resolved out and _ again _ the `` true '' s - z effect and cluster mass increase .",
    "now , if the cluster has @xmath9 @xmath15 5 kev ( like the clusters we know about ) , then , given the relation between angular size and @xmath6 , a baryon mass of @xmath16 m@xmath17 within a 1-mpc radius at @xmath18 is the way to produce the s - z effect that requires the least mass . given a ratio of total mass to baryon mass of 10 ,",
    "the cluster mass is at least @xmath19  m@xmath17 .    the next question : is there evidence to support the notion that the massive cluster _ is _ distant ?",
    "evidence so far comes from two fronts .",
    "first , pc1643 + 4631a&b lies on the edge of a pointed rosat pspc field ; the upper limit to its x - ray flux corresponds to a luminosity of @xmath20 w ( similar to the luminosities of nearby clusters in which we see s - z decrements ) at @xmath2 .",
    "second , we have obtained deep @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 images of the field with the wht and ukirt ; there is nothing near the decrement that looks like a cluster at @xmath24 .",
    "it thus appears that , if the cluster is like known luminous clusters , it must lie at @xmath2 and may be an embarrassment to our standard view of structure formation . or it may be that the cluster is nearer , in which case it contains far fewer luminous galaxies than known clusters , has gas more rarefied than known clusters ( to reduce the x - ray luminosity ) , yet has a higher gas temperature ( to maintain the s - z ) .",
    "a system of @xmath19 m@xmath17 will gravitationally lens objects behind it .",
    "we have carried out simple modelling of the lensing , assuming ( and this is not critical ) that the lens lies at @xmath25 and that the gas fits the standard @xmath26-model . with a total mass of @xmath27  m@xmath17 within 1  mpc of the centre , the source ( true ) positions of quasars",
    "a and b almost coincide , despite their observed positions being 3 apart .",
    "a tiny adjustment to the gas distribution model would make the source positions coincident .",
    "if a and b really are two images of one quasar , then their spectra should be identical  with two exceptions .",
    "absorption / scattering may be different along the two paths from source to image , and the travel time is likely @xmath28 years different so that source variability will affect the images .",
    "we have obtained high quality optical spectra of a and b : they are remarkably similar , though there are narrow absorption features in them that have the same one - percent redshift difference .",
    "we are currently considering a model in which the absorbing gas is in the broad - line region , and that the broad - line velocities we see have not only a keplerian component but also a bulk one that changes with time ."
