    "a mechanical interpretation of the entropy production rate in nonequilibrium systems interacting with thermostats and possibly subject to external non conservative ( `` stirring '' ) forces has emerged from simulations and studies on nonequilibrium statistical mechanics since the early 1980 s , @xcite .",
    "it is interpreted as phase space contraction rate , as defined by the divergence of the equations of motion which we write symbolically @xmath0 , @xmath1 .",
    "general thermostats acting on a mechanical system , on which also external non conservative forces may act , will be modeled as described in fig.1 and illustrated in the caption , @xcite :    fig.1 :  the @xmath2 boxes @xmath3 contain @xmath4 particles , of mass @xmath5 , whose positions and velocities are denoted @xmath6 , and @xmath7 respectively . the @xmath8",
    "denote external , non conservative , forces and the multipliers @xmath9 model the thermostats and are so defined that the kinetic energies @xmath10 are exactly constants of motion with values @xmath11 , @xmath12 boltzmann s constant , @xmath13 .",
    "the energies @xmath14 should be imagined as generated by pair potentials @xmath15 short ranged , smooth , or with a singularity like a hard core .",
    "to imply @xmath16 in the above model the multiplier @xmath9 has to be @xmath17 , where    q_jdef=-_j_*x*_j w_0,i(*x*_0,*x*_j)[e1.2]is naturally interpreted as the _ heat _ ceded per unit time to the thermostat @xmath18 .",
    "the phase space contraction rate , neglecting for simplicity @xmath19 , is computed from the equation in fig.1 to be    ( x)=_j[e1.1](each addend should be multiplied by the factor @xmath20 if @xmath19 is not neglected ) .    of course @xmath21 depends upon the metric used on phase space and on the density giving the volume element : both are arbitrary and eq.([e1.1 ] ) yields the contraction rate for the euclidean metric and density @xmath22 : for the liouville volume . because of such ambiguity @xmath21 _ can not _ have an immediate physical meaning .",
    "however its time average , and the fluctuations of its finite time averages over long time intervals , have an intrinsic meaning , independent of the choices of the metric and the density , @xcite , at least if the motions are `` chaotic '' , see below",
    ".    some interesting concrete examples of the above systems are illustrated in fig.2 and fig.3 .",
    "fig2 . a modern version of the classical drude s model for electric conductivity .",
    "in fig.2 @xmath23 and this is an electric conduction model of @xmath24 charged particles ( @xmath25 in the figure ) in a constant electric field @xmath8 and interacting with a lattice of obstacles ( circles in the figure ) ; it is `` autotermostatted '' ( because @xmath26 and @xmath27 coincide ) in @xmath28 dimensions .",
    "this is a model that appeared since the early days ( drude , 1899 , @xcite ) in a slightly different form ( in dimension @xmath29 and with the thermostatting realized by replacing the @xmath30 force with the prescription that after collision with an obstacle velocity is rescaled to @xmath31 .",
    "the thermostat forces are a model of the effect of the interactions between the particle ( electron ) and a background lattice ( phonons ) .",
    "this model is remarkable because it is the first nonequilibrium problem that has been treated with real mathematical attention and for which the analog of ohm s law for electric conduction has been proved if @xmath32 , @xcite .",
    "another example is a model of thermal conduction , fig.3 :    fig3 . a model for thermal and electric conduction .",
    "in which @xmath33 hard disks interact by elastic collisions with each other and with other hard disks ( @xmath34 in number ) in the containers labeled by their temperatures @xmath35 : the latter are subject to elastic collisions between themselves and with the disks in the central container @xmath26 ; the separation reflect elastically the particles when their _ centers _ reach them , thus allowing interactions between the thermostats and the main container particles .",
    "interactions with the thermostats take place only near the separating walls .    if one imagines that the upper and lower walls of the central container are identified ( realizing a periodic boundary condition ) and that a constant field of intensity @xmath36 acts in the vertical direction then two forces conspire to keep it out of equilibrium , and the parameters @xmath37 characterize their strength : matter and heat currents flow .",
    "the case @xmath38 has been studied in simulations to check that the thermostats are `` efficient '' : that the simple interaction , via collisions taking place across the boundary , is sufficient to allow the systems to reach a stationary state , @xcite .",
    "thermostat models similar to the above have been considered in the literature , @xcite .",
    "a fundamental problem with the model in fig.1 is that it is not clear which detailed assumptions have to be made on the interactions to insure that almost all initial conditions evolve staying in a bounded region in phase space so that they can be expected to determine a stationary state .",
    "this can be called the `` thermostat efficiency problem '' and it is , for nonequilibrium , the analogue of the hamiltonian stability problem in equilibrium , @xcite .",
    "the experiment in @xcite encourages the idea that the assumptions could be very general and fairly simple . in @xcite a model like the one in fig.3 was studied but the confinement difficulty was avoided by requiring that also the total kinetic energy @xmath39 in the central container was constant thanks to an extra thermostatting force @xmath40 with a properly chosen @xmath41 .    the model in fig.3 _ without _ thermostatting forces to keep @xmath42 constant , hence with a purely hamiltonian evolution , has been carefully studied in @xcite which also gives the clearest account on the so called `` transient fluctuation theorem '' improving and extending its earlier formulation in @xcite , and obtains implicitly also a transient version of the result on fluctuation patterns , analogous to the one derived earlier for steady states in @xcite .    in @xcite",
    "there is also a careful analysis of the model in fig.3 with the aim of obtaining results for stationary states : stationarity is made possible by taking the thermostats infinitely large stressing the ( formidable ) problems that one should encounter in attempting a rigorous proof .    in this paper ( and in all my preceding ones )",
    "i have chosen to consider only finite thermostats with empirical thermostat forces and studied a few problems by introducing a single assumption , the chaotic hypothesis .",
    "microscopic motions are in all possible empirical senses `` chaotic '' .",
    "the paradigm of chaotic motions are the hyperbolic transitive systems : these are smooth systems whose evolution can be intuitively described by saying that each phase space point moves being seen by the comoving neighboring points as a hyperbolic fixed point .",
    "another intuitive way to look at such systems is to say that the phase space points can be coded into sequences @xmath43 of symbols , say the digits @xmath44 @xmath45 , in such a way that the dynamics becomes the trivial shift of the sequence @xmath46 , and all sequences which satisfy @xmath47 represent one phase space point , @xmath48 being a `` compatibility matrix '' with elements @xmath49 which is transitive ( @xmath50 for some @xmath51 ) .",
    "there may be ambiguities , different sequences may represent the same point , but this can happen on a zero volume set of points only , in close analogy with the familiar ambiguity in the representation of number by digits ( where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the same number ) .",
    "it is natural , at least for some @xcite , to imagine that motions of complex systems , like gases or liquids , are chaotic in the simplest sense ( which is also the strongest ) of being hyperbolic transitive on the attracting sets ( also called anosov systems ) .",
    "the _ chaotic hypothesis _",
    ", proposed in @xcite , see also @xcite , reflects this remark .    * chaotic hypothesis * _ attracting sets for mechanical systems are smooth surfaces on which motion is smooth , hyperbolic and transitive .",
    "_    this is an hypothesis that has to be considered in the same sense as the ergodic hypothesis for equilibrium statistical mechanics , @xcite .",
    "hence _ it might be at first disturbing_.",
    "however disturbing assumptions are common in the literature and , nevertheless , are often fruitful .",
    "i just mention the assumption of periodicity with equal period ( `` monocyclicity '' ) of the motions of mechanical systems : it was employed in the derivation of the second law from the action principle in boltzmann , @xcite : this assumption was considered also by clausius , maxwell , helmholtz and was the basis of the early works on the mechanical interpretation of the second law , @xcite . at the time there must have been objections to such a bold assumption and someone must have declared , as it was done a little later about its modification into the ergodic hypothesis ( and as it is done today about the chaotic hypothesis ) , that it is `` a strong assumption as the periodicity ( or ergodicity ) hypothesis raises the question of which systems of practical interest are `` periodic '' ( `` ergodic '' ) , since almost none of them is actually such '' , see @xcite .",
    "similar statements can be found in the literature , even in good papers .",
    "chaotic systems ( in the above sense ) admit a statistics ( called srb statistics , @xcite ) , a probability distribution @xmath54 on each attracting set which , by integration , gives the average values of the observables @xmath55 on trajectories whose initial data @xmath56 are randomly chosen , near enough to an attracting set , with a distribution with some ( arbitrary ) density :    = _",

    "remarks : _ ( 1 ) the hypothesis holds also in equilibrium ; if the system admits a dense trajectory in phase space it implies the classical ergodic hypothesis . + ( 2 ) if the observable @xmath66 has nonzero srb - average it is convenient to consider instead the observable @xmath67 because it is dimensionless , just as in the case of @xmath68 it is convenient to consider the dimensionless observable @xmath69 .",
    "+ ( 3 ) if the dynamics is _ reversible _ , there is a smooth , isometric , map @xmath70 of phase space such that @xmath71 and @xmath72 or in the discrete case @xmath73 , then any _ time reversal odd _ observable @xmath66 , with non zero average and nonzero dispersion @xmath64 , is such that the interval of @xmath62 of large deviations for @xmath74 is at least @xmath75 provided there is a dense orbit ( which also implies existence of only one attracting set ) .",
    "+ ( 4 ) the systems in the thermostats model of sec.[sec1 ] are all reversible with @xmath70 being the ordinary time reversal , change in sign of velocity with positions unaltered , and the phase space contraction @xmath21 is odd under time reversal , see eq.([e1.1 ] ) .",
    "therefore if @xmath76 it follows that the observable    p=1_j=0 ^ -1 [ e2.5]has domain of large deviations of the form @xmath77 and contains @xmath75 .",
    "+ ( 5 ) since by eq.([e1.1 ] ) @xmath78 differs from @xmath79 by the time derivative of an observable , it follows that the finite or infinite time averages @xmath80 and of @xmath81 have , for large @xmath60 , the same distribution .",
    "therefore the same large deviations function @xmath82 controls the fluctuations of @xmath83 above and of    p=1_j=0 ^ -1 , _ + _ srb=_srb,[e2.6]and it has been shown , @xcite and in a mathematical form in @xcite , that under the chaotic hypothesis and reversibility of motions on the attracting set , the function @xmath82 has the symmetry property    ( -p)=(p)-p_+ ,  p(-p , p)[e2.7]and @xmath84 . this is the _ fluctuation theorem _ of @xcite ( it requires a proof and therefore it should not be confused with several identities , see for instance @xcite , with which , for reasons that i fail to understand , it has been often identified ) .",
    "the interest of the theorem is that it is _ universal _ , model independent yielding a parameter free relation which deals with a quantity which has the physical meaning of entropy production rate and therefore has an independent macroscopic definition and is accessible to experiments .",
    "+ ( 6 ) eq.([e2.7 ] ) is closely related to the theorem in @xcite , from which it differs only because it deals with finite thermostats assuming the ( strong ) chaotic hypothesis , rather than dealing with infinite thermostats and assuming ( strong ) ergodicity properties . in spite of the latter work several paper have appeared in the literature trying to get rid of the chaotic hypothesis without adding much ( if anything ) to the lucid discussion in @xcite about the necessity of suitable assumptions in order to allow extending a transient fluctuation relation ( which is an identity , requiring no assumption , on the full phase space , @xcite ) to a stationary one ( which deals with properties that hold on a subset of zero probability with respect to the initial data sampling ) .",
    "+ ( 7 ) the fluctuation theorem has several extensions including a remarkable , parameter free relation that concerns the relative probability of patterns of evolution of an observable and their reversed patterns , @xcite , related to the onsager  machlup fluctuations theory , which keeps being rediscovered in various forms and variations in the literature .",
    "another consequence of the fluctuation theorem are the onsager reciprocity and green - kubo formulae for the infinitesimal deviations from equilibrium , @xcite ; the latter can be independently derived ( in a simpler way ) from the chaotic hypothesis and time reversal symmetry assumed only at equilibrium , @xcite , as it will be shown in the concluding comments , or as discussed from a somewhat different viewpoint in @xcite .    here",
    "the aim is to show that _ the green - kubo formulae , hence onsager s reciprocity , can be regarded as the version at zero forcing of the fluctuation theorem for stationary states_.    in the case in which @xmath85 and @xmath86 the system is in thermal equilibrium and its state is characterized by a probability distribution @xmath87 which invariant under the time evolution @xmath58 generated by the equations in fig.1 . setting @xmath88",
    "it is remarkable that the distribution can be explicitly found , @xcite , as    @xmath89 ( _ j>0(k_j-32 n_j t))(_j0 d_j d * x*_j)[e3.1]where @xmath90 ( neglecting @xmath19 for simplicity ) .",
    "calling the `` unperturbed '' energy @xmath91 and @xmath92 , eq.([e3.1 ] ) , written more compactly , is    _ 0(dx)= conste^-h_0(x ) _ j>0(k_j(x),t)dx[e3.2]which is a distribution in an ensemble which , for the system in @xmath26 , is equivalent to the canonical one ( for @xmath93 if @xmath94 is the side of the container ) .    we now want to compare the average values of various currents that are switched on when @xmath8 , the external forces , become non zero and the temperatures of the thermostats become different : @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "more precisely we look for the relations between infinitesimal forcing _ actions _ and the corresponding _ currents _ , the susceptibility coefficients .",
    "the currents are related to the average values of the derivatives of the entropy production with respect to the forces ( material currents ) or to the temperature inequalities ( heat currents ) .",
    "_ however _ the arbitrariness inherent in the phase space contraction generates interesting questions : for instance in the model in fig.1 the phase space contraction with respect to the liouville volume _ is independent of the external forces @xmath8 _ , see eqs.([e1.2]),([e1.1 ] ) , so that @xmath97 , while it is _ obvious _ that the external forces generate material currents , being non conservative .    on the other hand even in equilibrium a thermostatted system exchanges heat with the thermostats :",
    "hence there is a production of entropy which has a zero average but which is not zero and equal to @xmath98 .",
    "it is therefore interesting to see , first , why in equilibrium ( when the thermostats have all the same temperature and no external forces act ) the srb - average of @xmath99 vanishes , @xcite .",
    "this is the case because the latter quantity is the derivative of @xmath100 .",
    "in fact the derivative @xmath101 is @xmath102 times the work done on the system by the forces @xmath103 which equals @xmath104 .",
    "this means that @xmath105 and therefore    _",
    "j>0 = h_0(x)-_j>0 [ e3.3]and the r.h.s . is a time derivative , hence it has @xmath106 time average .",
    "when the system is out of equilibrium ( @xmath107 and @xmath108 ) the heat currents flowing into the thermostats divided by the temperature are generated by the entropy production rate @xmath109 , while the material currents through the system are defined by minus the derivatives with respect to the acting forces of the work per unit time that they do , given by the corresponding derivatives of @xmath110 .",
    "thus given arbitrarily @xmath102 the quantity    ( x)=(x)-h_0(x)[e3.4]generates all currents up to a proportionality factor ( here @xmath102 is arbitrary ) .",
    "it can be computed as    ( x)=_j>0 - * e*_0-_j>0(q_j+u_j)[e3.5]because , by the equations in fig.1 , @xmath111 and therefore @xmath112 , see eq.([e1.2 ] ) .",
    "hence , discarding the time derivatives terms involving the @xmath113 ( parameters independent ) , the currents ( at infinitesimal forcing ) can be generated by the function    _ 0(x)=_j>0 q_j(1k_b",
    "t_j-1k_b t)-*e*_01k_b t[e3.6 ]    the generating function @xmath114 is odd under time reversal and _ vanishes at equilibrium _",
    "@xmath115 if @xmath116 is chosen @xmath117 ; its derivatives with respect to the forcing parameters @xmath118 generate the heat and material currents and , at the same , time @xmath119 differs from the phase space contraction by a time derivative .",
    "note that @xmath120 is also the phase space contraction of the volume in phase space , _ provided _ the latter is measured by the distribution    ( dx)= conste^-h_0(x ) _ j>0(k_j(x),t_j)dx[e3.7 ] in @xcite a reversible system ( like the model in fig.1 ) , has been considered in which the generating function for the currents _ @xmath114 vanishes for vanishing `` thermodynamic forces '' @xmath121 _ and satisfies the fluctuation relation or , better , its extension in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* eq.(14 ) ) , has been considered .    and",
    "it has been shown , @xcite , that the products of the currents , generated by the thermodynamic forces , times @xmath90 , and defined by    j_m=_f_r(x)_f_r_0(x)[e3.8]are such that their averages @xmath122 have susceptibilities @xmath123 which satisfy    l_mp= 12_-^ dt ( j_m(s_t ) j_p()_srb- j_m_srbj_p_srb ) |_*f*=*0*[e3.9 ] if the parameter @xmath102 is properly chosen as mentioned above , @xmath124 ( and only if so chosen ) , @xmath114 will vanish when @xmath125 .",
    "since @xmath126 and @xmath114 differ by a time derivative they can be interchangeably used in the theory of the srb distribution and therefore @xmath114 satisfies the fluctuation theorem ( because @xmath126 does ) ; the assumptions in the derivation in @xcite apply and therefore eq.([e3.9 ] ) yields onsager s reciprocity @xmath127 , and green  kubo formula .",
    "\\(1 ) this extends considerably the results in @xcite removing the restriction on the phase space contraction to be the generating function of the currents .",
    "the key is that the phase space contraction is only defined up to a time derivative of an observable and the generating function of the currents coincides with the phase space contraction only if the observable is properly chosen .",
    "\\(2 ) it is worth stressing that the extension of the fluctuation theorem needed to derive from it onsager reciprocity is an important one : in @xcite it was further extended to show ( _ conditional reversibility theorem _ ) that there is a simple relation between the probability that an observable @xmath128 , even or odd under time reversal ( for simplicity ) , follows in a time interval @xmath129 a `` pattern '' @xmath130 or the `` reversed pattern '' @xmath131 _ provided _ the entropy production rate is fixed , @xcite . a statement that can be colorfully quoted as _ .. relative probabilities of patterns observed in a time interval of size @xmath60 and in presence of an average entropy production @xmath132 are the same as those of the corresponding anti - patterns in presence of the opposite average entropy production rate _ , @xcite , or also @xcite , or _",
    "... it `` suffices '' to change the sign of the entropy production to reverse the arrow of time _ , or also _",
    "... a waterfall will go up , as likely as we see it going down , in a world in which for some reason , or by the deed of a daemon , the entropy creation rate has changed sign during a long enough time _ , @xcite .",
    "we can also say that the motion on an attractor is reversible , even in the presence of dissipation , once the dissipation is fixed .",
    "again variations of this property keep being rediscovered , see for instance @xcite .",
    "\\(3 ) in the case of systems in contact with a single thermostat but in a stationary nonequilibrium because of the action of external forces the above analysis has also interesting consequences .",
    "the phase space contraction can be written as @xmath133 , as in eq.([e1.1 ] ) , or by adding to it a time derivative as @xmath134 which in this case is simply @xmath135 .",
    "therefore the fluctuation theorem , as pointed out by bonetto : see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* eq.(9.10.4 ) ) , yields the following `` _ work theorem _ ''    _ srb=1 , wdef= 1_0^w(s_tx ) dt[e4.1]in the sense that the logarithm of the l.h.s",
    ". divided by @xmath60 tends to @xmath106 as @xmath136 .",
    "more generally the identity up to a time derivative of @xmath78 , @xmath126 , @xmath137 and @xmath138 , see eqs.([e3.3])-([e3.6 ] ) , implies that , in the same sense as in eq.([e4.1 ] ) , the finite time average @xmath139 of _ any _ of the latter four quantities , denoted @xmath140 , over a time @xmath60 will satisfy    _",
    "srb=1,pdef= 1_0^(s_tx)[e4.2]which can be called an `` _ entropy theorem _ '' : not only remarkable because it involves quantities that can be measured in experiments , @xcite , but also because here @xmath102 can be taken _ arbitrary _ , so that eq.([e4.2 ] ) is an infinite number of relations . actually if @xmath141 the large deviations of @xmath132 satisfy the fluctuation theorem symmetry eq.([e2.7 ] ) .",
    "note however that all such relations are special cases of the theorem in @xcite .",
    "\\(4 ) a further alternative method to derive the green - kubo relations is in @xcite .",
