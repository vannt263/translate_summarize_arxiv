    "decays of @xmath8 mesons to three - body charmless hadronic final states have attracted considerable attention in recent years . an amplitude analysis for a number of three - body final states has been performed ( for example , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 ) , where branching fractions for many quasi - two - body intermediate states have been measured for the first time or with a significantly improved accuracy .",
    "in addition to providing a rich laboratory for studying @xmath8 meson decay dynamics , three - body charmless final states open new possibilities for @xmath12 violation studies .",
    "several new ideas utilizing three - body final states have been proposed  @xcite .",
    "experimentally , studies of @xmath12 violation have been done with most of the final states mentioned above , yielding some interesting results .",
    "for example , the first evidence for direct @xmath12 violation in charged @xmath8 meson decays to the @xmath13 final states has been recently found through the amplitude analysis of the three - body @xmath14 decay  @xcite .",
    "time - dependent @xmath12 violation was measured in @xmath15  @xcite and @xmath16  @xcite three - body decays , which occur dominantly via the @xmath17 penguin transition .",
    "measurements of @xmath18 in @xmath17 penguin - dominated decays provide an important test of the standard model .",
    "the quasi - two - body @xmath19 channel that contributes to the three - body @xmath20 final state is also expected to be dominated by the @xmath17 penguin transition and thus has been used for the measurement of @xmath18  @xcite . however , since the @xmath21 has a significant natural width , nearby resonant states ( for example the @xmath22 is particularly important as the combined @xmath12 parity of the @xmath23 is opposite to that of the @xmath19 ) might contribute to the @xmath21 mass region and an accurate estimation of these contributions is required for a correct interpretation of the results .",
    "this can only be done via an amplitude ( dalitz ) analysis of the three - body @xmath0 decay .    in this paper",
    "we report first results of a dalitz plot analysis of the three - body charmless @xmath0 decay .",
    "the analysis is based on a @xmath24 data sample containing @xmath25 @xmath1 pairs , collected with the belle detector operating at the kekb asymmetric - energy @xmath3 collider  @xcite with a center - of - mass ( c.m . )",

    ", we use a data sample ( that amounts to about 10% of the on - resonance sample ) taken 60  mev below the @xmath2 resonance .",
    "the belle detector  @xcite is a large - solid - angle magnetic spectrometer based on a 1.5  t superconducting solenoid magnet .",
    "charged particle tracking is provided by a silicon vertex detector and a 50-layer central drift chamber ( cdc ) that surround the interaction point .",
    "charged hadron identification is provided by @xmath27 measurements in the cdc , an array of 1188 aerogel erenkov counters ( acc ) , and a barrel - like array of 128 time - of - flight scintillation counters ( tof ) ; information from the three subdetectors is combined to form a single likelihood ratio for each pair of hadron species that is then used for pion , kaon and proton discrimination .",
    "electromagnetic showering particles are detected in an array of 8736 csi(tl ) crystals ( ecl ) that covers the same solid angle as the charged particle tracking system .",
    "electron identification is based on a combination of @xmath27 measurements in the cdc , the response of the acc , and the position , shape and total energy deposition of the shower detected in the ecl .",
    "the electron identification efficiency is greater than 92% for tracks with @xmath28  gev/@xmath29 and the hadron misidentification probability is below 0.3% .",
    "the magnetic field is returned via an iron yoke that is instrumented to detect muons and @xmath30 mesons .",
    "we use a geant - based monte carlo ( mc ) simulation to model the response of the detector and determine its acceptance  @xcite .",
    "candidate charged pions from @xmath8 meson decay are required to be consistent with having originated from the interaction point and to have momenta transverse to the beam greater than 0.1  gev/@xmath29 . to reduce the combinatorial background ,",
    "we impose a requirement on the particle identification variable that has 93% efficiency and about 15% fake rate from misidentified kaons .",
    "tracks that are positively identified as electrons or protons are excluded .",
    "we fit these candidate pions to the common vertex to determine the @xmath8 meson decay vertex .",
    "neutral kaons are reconstructed via the decay @xmath31 .",
    "the invariant mass of the two oppositely charged tracks is required to be within 12  mev/@xmath32 of the nominal @xmath33 mass .",
    "the direction of flight of the @xmath33 candidate is required to be consistent with the direction of its vertex displacement with respect to the @xmath8 decay vertex .",
    "@xmath8 candidates are identified using two kinematic variables : the beam - constrained mass @xmath34 and the energy difference @xmath35 where the summation is over all particles from a @xmath8 candidate ; @xmath36 and @xmath37 are their c.m .",
    "three - momenta and masses , respectively ; @xmath38 is the beam energy in the c.m . frame .",
    "the signal @xmath39 resolution is mainly determined by the beam energy spread and amounts to 2.9  mev/@xmath32 .",
    "the signal @xmath40 shape is fit to a sum of two gaussian functions ( core and tail ) with a common mean .",
    "distribution for the @xmath0 candidate events with @xmath41  mev/@xmath32 .",
    "points with error bars are data ; the upper curve is the fit result ; the hatched histograms are various background components.,scaledwidth=49.0% ]    the dominant background is due to @xmath42 ( @xmath43 and @xmath29 quarks ) continuum events .",
    "we suppress this background using variables that characterize the event topology .",
    "since the two @xmath8 mesons produced from an @xmath44 decay are nearly at rest in the c.m .",
    "frame , their decay products are uncorrelated and the event tends to be spherical . in contrast , hadrons from continuum @xmath45 events tend to exhibit a two - jet structure .",
    "we use @xmath46 , which is the angle between the thrust axis of the @xmath8 candidate and that of the rest of the event , to discriminate between the two cases .",
    "the distribution of @xmath47 is strongly peaked near @xmath48 for @xmath45 events and is nearly flat for @xmath49 events .",
    "we require @xmath50 eliminating about 83% of the continuum background while retaining 79% of the signal events .",
    "for further suppression of the continuum background , we use a fisher discriminant formed from 11 variables : nine variables that characterize the angular distribution of the momentum flow in the event with respect to the @xmath8 candidate thrust axis , the angle of the @xmath8 candidate thrust axis with respect to the beam axis , and the angle between the @xmath8 candidate momentum and the beam axis .",
    "use of such a fisher discriminant rejects about 89% of the remaining continuum background with 53% efficiency for the signal .",
    "a more detailed description of the background suppression technique can be found in ref .",

    "we veto these backgrounds by requiring @xmath54  mev/@xmath32 , @xmath55  mev/@xmath32 and @xmath56  mev/@xmath32 , with a muon mass assignment used here for the pion candidates . to suppress the background due to @xmath57 misidentification , we exclude candidates that are consistent with the @xmath58 hypothesis within 15  mev/@xmath32 ( @xmath59 ) , regardless of the particle identification information .",
    "there is also a large background from the @xmath60\\pi$ ] channel and from the @xmath61 channel with a subsequent semileptonic @xmath62 decay .",
    "however , these modes do not peak in the signal region and contribute mainly to the @xmath63 region . the most significant backgrounds from charmless @xmath8 decays originate from @xmath64{\\ensuremath{k^0_s}}$ ] and @xmath65 decays .",
    "in the latter case an additional soft pion is randomly picked up to form a @xmath20 combination .",
    "we determine the @xmath40 shape for these backgrounds from mc simulation and take them into account when fitting the data .    the @xmath40 distribution for @xmath20 combinations that pass all the selection requirements is shown in fig .",

    "hence , the invariant mass of at least one pair of particles is in the low mass region .",
    "in addition , it is often the case that two high momentum particles are combined with a low momentum particle to form a @xmath8 candidate . in this case",
