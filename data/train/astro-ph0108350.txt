    "the recent null detection of hot jupiters in the globular cluster 47 tucanae @xcite is an important puzzle .",
    "this search for planetary systems was sensitive to the detection of gas - giant planets in orbits of less than five days ( @xmath4au ) about a main - sequence parent star : the so - called `` hot jupiters '' .",
    "if the frequency of hot jupiters in the solar neighbourhood holds for 47 tuc then simulations suggested that approximately 20 should have been unearthed by the survey @xcite .",
    "the @xcite survey has led to a number of analytical and statistical studies concerning the fate of planetary systems in star cluster environments @xcite .",
    "@xcite estimate that only planets that form in orbits with semi - major axes , @xmath5 , less than @xmath6au will survive in a globular cluster but that even planets with @xmath7au would be broken - up in the high density core . in the case of 47 tuc",
    "the question then seems to be : were all the surveyed stars resident in the cluster core for a significant fraction of the cluster evolution or , did the planets not form in the first place ?",
    "@xcite have suggested that in the early globular cluster environment the natal disk from which planets form may be truncated inside the region where gas - giant planets are believed to form . in the solar neighbourhood",
    "the parent stars of planets tend to be considerably richer in metals than average @xcite .",
    "this lends support to the hypothesis that a lower abundance of metals in proto - planetary nebulae causes a lower frequency of planet formation as a result of fewer dust grains for nucleation ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references within ) .",
    "the metallicity of 47 tuc is a factor of five less than solar @xcite .    if we assume that a population of planets does form with orbital separations in the range @xmath8 then @xcite",
    "show that 50% of these planets will be liberated from their parent star in a globular cluster and 27% will be liberated in the less - dense surroundings of an open cluster .",
    "_ however , these authors also claim that in an open cluster only 0.5% of these liberated planets will stay in the cluster for more than a crossing - time .",
    "_ this increases to 30.1% for a typical globular cluster .    in the case of m22",
    "it is the liberated , or free - floating , planets that are of particular interest .",
    "the microlensing of background stars by compact objects in globular clusters has been analyzed in detail by @xcite .",
    "possible targets mentioned for a hubble space telescope ( hst ) study are m22 with the galactic bulge background and 47 tuc with the small magellanic clouds as background .",
    "the advantage here is that the probability of lensing is high and accurate knowledge of the distances and kinematics of the sources and lenses leads to better lense - mass estimates .",
    "@xcite attribute six possible gravitational microlensing events to planetary - mass objects and only one event to a star , the mass of which is @xmath9 , based on hst observations of m22 .",
    "if these free - floating planetary - mass objects are jupiters then their relative size suggests that there must be 60 jupiters per star in m22 and therefore that they constitute @xmath10 of the cluster mass @xcite .",
    "if they are earth - like objects then the number increases to 600 per star , but they comprise only 0.3% of the cluster mass .",
    "the central density of m22 is roughly @xmath11stars@xmath12 , a factor of 10 less than 47 tuc , which still places it clearly within the globular cluster regime .",
    "factoring in the 50% liberation rate for planets effectively doubles the number of planets required per star .",
    "furthermore , the relative time spent in the cluster by the liberated planets is then a critical factor in estimating the microlensing rate .",
    "interestingly the metallicity of m22 is a factor of 10 lower than that of 47 tuc @xcite .",
    "a large fraction of the stars that we observe are found in gravitationally bound star clusters .",
    "in fact , it is entirely possible that all stars were born in a star cluster of some sort @xcite .",
    "clusters are crowded stellar environments , ranging in density from @xmath13stars@xmath12 to as high as @xmath14stars@xmath12 in the cores of the densest globular clusters , which complicates matters for the evolution of their members . encounters between stars can lead to collisions and , in the case of binary stars or planetary systems , an exchange interaction or disruption of the orbit .",
    "for this reason , amongst others , it is desirable to model the evolution of a star cluster using a direct @xmath0-body method in which the individual orbits of each star are followed in detail _ and _ the internal evolution of each star is also taken into account @xcite .",
    "we have instigated a study of the behaviour of planetary systems in star clusters using a state - of - the - art @xmath0-body code in conjunction with the powerful grape-6 special purpose computer @xcite .",
    "this detailed project will ultimately involve a large number of @xmath0-body simulations covering a wide range of initial conditions , e.g. metallicity , binary fraction , stellar number density , and multiple planets per star .",
    "however , for now we have simply looked at the case of jupiters in single - planet systems within moderate density cluster conditions .",
    "furthermore , we do not consider whether planets should form at all in star clusters ( * ? ? ?",
    "* for example ) , especially in low - metallicity and/or high density environments , but simply ask the question : what happens if they do ? even though this project is in its infancy the possible discovery of free - floating planets in m22 @xcite makes publication of the initial results very timely .",
    "to model the evolution of star clusters we use the aarseth nbody4 code @xcite .",
    "simulations are performed on a prototype grape-6 board located at the american museum of natural history .",
    "this special purpose hardware , which acts as a newtonian force accelerator for @xmath0-body calculations , performs @xmath15tflops ( @xmath16gflop per chip ) .",
    "it represents a factor of 100 increase in computing power compared to its predecessor the grape-4 @xcite and has brought the possibility of modelling globular clusters on a star - to - star basis within reach for the first time .",
    "the simulations performed so far have involved @xmath17 stars with a 10% primordial binary fraction .",
    "initial conditions relating to the masses , positions and velocities of the stars , as well as the orbital characteristics of the binaries , are the same as for the @xmath18 star simulations described in detail by @xcite . in particular",
    ", a realistic initial - mass function is used to distribute the stellar masses @xcite , and the cluster is subject to a standard galactic tidal field .",
    "the distribution of orbital separations for the primordial binaries is log - normal with a peak at @xmath19au , and spans the range @xmath20 to @xmath21au .",
    "the eccentricity of each binary orbit is taken from a thermal distribution @xcite .",
    "positions and velocities of the stars are assigned according to a plummer model @xcite in virial equilibrium .",
    "we include the outcome of three simulations in the results presented here ( see table  [ t : table2 ] ) .",
    "the first had a metallicity of @xmath22 , relevant to 47 tuc , and included @xmath23 planets of jupiter mass .",
    "each planet was placed in a circular orbit about a randomly chosen parent star at a separation taken from a uniform distribution between 1 and @xmath1au .",
    "the second simulation involved @xmath24 jupiters with the lower limit of the separation distribution reduced to @xmath25au and the final simulation differs from this only in the use of @xmath26 .",
    "each simulation was evolved to an age of @xmath27gyr when @xmath28 of the initial cluster mass remained and the binary fraction was still close to 10% .",
    "typically the velocity dispersion of the stars in these model clusters was @xmath29 with a core density of @xmath30stars@xmath12 .",
    "the density of stars at the half - mass radius is generally a factor of 10 less than this .",
    "table  [ t : table3 ] shows , as a function of time , the number of planets that are liberated from their parent stars during the simulation , the number of planetary systems that escape from the cluster , and the number of planets that are exchanged from their original orbit into orbits about another parent star . also shown are the number of planets swallowed by their parent star simply as a result of nuclear driven expansion of the stellar envelope .",
    "these are averaged results from the three simulations .",
    "we find a weak preference for planets in wide orbits to be liberated from their parent star : planetary systems with a @xmath1au separation are 10 times more likely to be broken - up than those with @xmath31au ( see figure  [ f : fig1 ] ) .",
    "@xcite showed that the cross - section for a binary to undergo an exchange interaction , which also serves as a likelihood - of - disruption indicator , scales linearly with the orbital separation .",
    "this has been confirmed by @xcite in the case of planetary systems .",
    "the fact that we do not observe this relation is primarily a result of the large fraction of escaping systems which deprives the cluster of orbits to break - up .",
    "another factor is the relatively weak binding energy of the planetary systems compared to that of the binaries .",
    "it is evident from figure  [ f : fig1 ] that we are limited at this stage to a fairly low number of systems per orbital separation bin and not until we can saturate the distribution with a large number of systems , all situated in the core of the cluster , will we be able to fully test the statistical results mentioned above .",
    "planetary systems primarily escape from a cluster owing to stripping of stars in the outer cluster regions by the galactic tidal field . as a natural consequence of mass - segregation",
    "there is a preference for systems with low parent star mass to escape .",
    "planetary systems of all orbital separations are equally likely to escape ( as planets just `` tag along for the ride '' , see figure  [ f : fig1 ] ) .",
    "it is also possible for stars to be ejected from the cluster due to close encounters with other stars or binaries but in the case of planetary systems the encounter more likely results in liberation of the planet .",
    "_ we find that a large fraction of the liberated planets are retained in the cluster for much longer than a crossing - time .",
    "_ the typical crossing - time for these simulations is @xmath32myr .",
    "figure  [ f : fig2 ] shows the distribution of time spent in the cluster by the free - floating planets .",
    "the planets are preferentially liberated in the cluster core and 46% are liberated with a velocity less than the cluster escape velocity ( see figure  [ f : fig3 ] ) .",
    "the velocity dispersion of the free - floating planets is approximately twice that of the cluster stars .",
    "we expect this to have only a minimal effect on the determination of the lensing mass in m22 @xcite .",
    "so the planets generally begin their free - floating existence deep within the potential well of the cluster and will then journey towards the outer regions of the cluster driven by the effect of two - body relaxation .",
    "@xcite derive the timescale for mass - segregation to be directly related to the relaxation timescale of the cluster but with an inverse dependence on stellar mass .",
    "therefore we would expect the planets to take much longer to reach the tidal boundary of the cluster than low - mass stars .",
    "this is not what we see in figure  [ f : fig4 ] which illustrates the average position within the cluster over time for various mass groups . as expected the @xmath33 group , which always contains the average stellar mass , shows little movement . for the remaining stellar mass groups",
    "there is a strong correlation between deviation from the average stellar mass and the rate of mass - segregation , whether it be inwards for high - mass or outwards for low - mass .",
    "this clearly demonstrates that equipartition of energy is dominating the dynamical evolution .",
    "the picture is complicated for the planets because , in this case , the core population is replenished over time and their velocity distribution is detached from that of the stars . from figure",
    "[ f : fig4 ] we see that the average position of the free - floating planet population remains roughly constant , lying just outside the half - mass radius .",
    "the planets take approximately @xmath34myr , comparable to the half - mass relaxation timescale of the cluster , to move from inside the core to outside the half - mass radius .    for the non - escaping planetary systems we find that marginally more planets are liberated than suggested by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* @xmath35 compared to 27% ) and that a much larger fraction of free - floating planets are retained ( @xmath36 compared to 0.5% ) .",
    "if this trend continues into the globular cluster regime , and we expect that it will , then these early results have an important bearing on the interpretation of the m22 observations . in particular it is not as surprising as one might have originally thought that there are many free - floating planets in m22 .",
    "we note that @xcite only considered equal - mass stars : they studied cases of @xmath37 and @xmath38 separately . in this respect the velocity distribution shown in figure  [ f : fig3 ] is more representative of the real picture and this goes some way towards explaining our vastly different results for the retention of planets .",
    "@xcite also note that changes in the planet mass can critically affect the velocity distribution .",
    "table  [ t : table3 ] shows that the current number of planets in the cluster is decreasing with time but the escaping planetary systems are distorting the results .",
    "for the same reason our numbers concerning the liberation of planets must be taken as lower limits .",
    "however , when comparing these numbers to the work of @xcite we note that they used a separation distribution uniform in log space for their planetary systems and thus we have a higher proportion of initially wide orbits .",
    "the effect of escaping systems must be addressed in future simulations , possibly by placing planets primarily around stars with mass close to the average for the cluster stars .",
    "a significant number of planetary orbits are altered during the simulations .",
    "orbits of all sizes expand when the parent star evolves off the main - sequence and begins to lose mass non - conservatively in a stellar wind .",
    "weak perturbations from passing stars can cause the orbital period to decrease : this affects roughly 15% of systems with @xmath39au .",
    "we do not see any orbital migration of planetary systems with initial orbital separations less than this .",
    "system is defined as having an orbit with a binding energy greater than that of the mean kinetic energy of the cluster stars @xcite .",
    "it is then expected that owing to close encounters during the cluster evolution hard systems will become harder , i.e. orbital migration inwards , and _ soft _ systems will be broken - up . the hard / soft limit for binaries in our cluster simulations is roughly @xmath40au and for the planetary systems it is more like @xmath41au .",
    "considering this in conjunction with the relatively low number density of stars in the simulations performed so far it is not surprising that we have yet to observe hardening of close planetary orbits .",
    "exchange interactions alter the observed distribution of orbital characteristics in a fairly random manner although it is more likely for a wide system to be involved in such an event .",
    "contrary to recent claims @xcite we find that free - floating planets can form a significant population in stellar clusters .",
    "this is based on the results of open cluster size @xmath0-body simulations but is expected to be even more likely in the case of globular clusters . while it should be stressed that the detection of free - floating planets in m22 is preliminary , and also speculative , it suggests that at least 100 planets were formed for every star .",
    "this may sound implausible but is in fact supported by recent simulations .",
    "@xcite have shown that in a protoplanetary disk where the surface density of the solid component is low , the isolation mass of planets is small and many terrestial planets can form .",
    "it is also possible that protoplanetary disks having lower metallicity than solar would form many earth - like planets - perhaps 50 - 100 per star ( shigeru ida , private communication ) .",
    "a population of free - floating sub - stellar objects has also been detected in the young cluster @xmath42 orionis @xcite .",
    "the possibility has been raised that these may be formed as such @xcite , i.e. not attached to a parent star .",
    "we agree with @xcite that subsequent surveys for planetary systems should be conducted in clusters less dense that 47 tuc , such as metal - rich open clusters .",
    "observations of a metal - rich globular cluster should help determine whether the lack of planetary systems in 47 tuc is due to the metallicity of the cluster or dynamical interactions .",
    "we note that a planet has been detected within a binary pulsar system in m4 @xcite which is metal - poor compared to 47 tuc @xcite .",
    "as we expand the parameter space of our @xmath0-body study many of the interesting issues regarding planetary systems in star clusters will be addressed .",
    "of particular importance will be the inclusion of systems with multiple planets per star @xcite .",
    "full realisation of the capabilities of the grape-6 hardware when the @xmath31tflop board becomes available will allow larger particle numbers , and consequently more planetary systems , to be studied per simulation .",
    "this will improve the statistical significance of our results considerably . moving to simulations that operate at globular cluster number densities",
    "will make it possible to look for orbital migration in small - period planetary systems .",
    "hence this study will have implications for future planet searches in globular clusters , especially if hot jupiter planetary systems can not form directly in such an environment .",
