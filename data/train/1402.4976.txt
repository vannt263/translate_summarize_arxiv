    "observations suggest that the negative radial metallicity gradient , @xmath4[fe / h]@xmath5 , measured in the solar neighborhood close to the plane , flattens or even attains positive values if we select stars at higher @xmath6 from the galactic plane or with high [ @xmath7/fe ] abundances ( allende prieto et al . 2006 ; boeche et al .",
    "2013 , anders et al . 2013 ; hayden et al .",
    "this effect can be a signature of a positive radial gradient in the thick disk population , as derived by marsakov & borkova ( 2005 ) and by carrell et al .",
    "( 2012 ) , who analyzed kinematically selected thick disk samples .",
    "alternatively , a similar feature can be simply produced by the variation of the fraction of thin disk and thick disk stars due to their different scale - height and scale - length ( anders et al .",
    "this scenario is indeed consistent with the short scale - length , @xmath8 kpc , recently estimated for @xmath7-enhanced stars by bensby et al .",
    "( 2011 ) and cheng et al .",
    "furthermore , there is observational evidence indicating that the milky way ( mw ) is a barred galaxy .",
    "non - axisymmetric structures in the disk ( such as bars and spiral arms ) drive galaxy evolution : they redistribute angular momentum among the different galactic components and can enhance radial migration inside the disk .",
    "it is still matter of debate the amount of impact that these secular processes can have on the formation of the thick disk and on its chemical and kinematical properties @xcite .",
    "this work is aimed at analyzing whether dynamical effects can be responsible for the non - negative radial metallicity gradients observed today in the mw thick disk , and suggests that such gradient can be regarded as a cosmological feature .",
    "we use an @xmath0-body disk that develops a bar and whose final population displays a radial metallicity gradient ; this is obtained from an initial axisymmetric disk with a positive radial metallicity gradient for @xmath9 kpc , which has dynamically evolved for 6.1 gyr .",
    "this secular evolution model was recently proven @xcite to reproduce the observed velocity - metallicity correlation in the thick disk @xcite . in this letter , we show that the positive slope of the chemical radial gradient in the mw thick disk observed today in the solar neighborhood might be a signature remaining from the primordial population of disk stars .",
    "the simulation used in this work was presented in @xcite ; it is an exponential disk with structural parameters appropriate for a mw - like dm halo at redshift @xmath10 .",
    "the disk , having a mass of @xmath11 and scale length h=3.5 kpc , is embedded in a navarro , frenk and white ( nfw ) dark matter halo @xcite with @xmath12 particles having mass @xmath13 and concentration @xmath14 ( see * ? ? ? * for details ) .",
    "we ran the simulation using the public parallel treecode gadget2 @xcite on the cluster matrix at the caspur ( consorzio interuniversitario per le applicazioni del supercalcolo ) consortium , rome .",
    "our simulation can be considered as an evolving thick disk model , consistent with the scenario where the thick disk is originated from gas accreted in a chaotic period at high redshift and with short star formation timescales @xcite .",
    "the initial radial metallicity distribution of the disk can be seen as the link between our isolated simulated disk and the cosmological scenario , as we explain in the following paragraphs .    in order to avoid the effect of relaxation of the initial conditions",
    ", we let the dynamical system evolve for 1 gyr .",
    "then the time is set to zero and each particle in the disk is tagged with a [ fe / h ] label , according to the initial radial function shown in figure [ fig : initialdist ] .",
    "this function is based on model s2it from @xcite .",
    "we assign metallicities with a dispersion @xmath15}=0.1 $ ] dex , which represents the variation of the median chemical profile over 1 gyr , according to @xcite . regarding the metallicity distribution as a function of the height , @xmath16 , from the galactic plane ,",
    "no initial vertical gradient has been included in our simulation .",
    "the positive slope of the function for @xmath9 kpc is justified with an inside - out disk formation model : at early epochs the efficiency of chemical enrichment in the inner regions of the disk is low due to a large amount of infalling primordial gas .",
    "this scenario is consistent with recent results published by @xcite , who found evidence for an `` inverse '' ( i.e. positive ) metallicity gradient in a sample of galaxies with stellar mass @xmath17 , at @xmath18 .",
    "they conclude that this is produced by the accretion of primordial gas @xcite , which diluted the abundance of elements heavier than helium in the center of the galaxies .",
    "the simulation produces a bar at around 2 gyr which persists throughout .",
    "the radial migration , illustrated in figure [ fig : migration ] , redistributes the angular momenta of the orbits inside and outside the bar . in figure",
    "[ fig : migration ] we can see to what extent the radius of each particle in the simulation has changed from @xmath19 , at the start of the dynamical time , to @xmath20 : 1.9 , 3.7 or 6.1 gyr later . the stars with @xmath21 have moved towards inner regions , whereas the other stars have migrated further away .",
    "thus , while the particles in the inner parts have a tendency to go towards the center , the outer regions of the disk are expanding .",
    "as for the distribution perpendicular to the plane of the disk , we observe a similar behaviour : the internal regions tend to compact with time along @xmath6 , whereas , in the external regions the disk particles increase their median @xmath22 ( e.g. * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the profile @xmath22 at 6 gyr is the result of the formation of a boxy bulge , probably due to buckling instabilities , although further analysis is needed in order to provide a full consistent explanation .",
    "figure [ fig : initialdist ] shows the median radial chemical distribution at four different dynamical epochs : @xmath23 , 1.9 , 3.7 and 6.1 gyr .",
    "the radial migration flattens out the initial chemical profile in the disk outer region , while it does not induce major modifications in the inner regions .",
    "the peak in the metallicity distribution , initially at @xmath24 kpc , shifts to @xmath25 kpc after @xmath26 6 gyr ; also the value of the [ fe / h ] peak varies from an initial value of @xmath27 dex kpc@xmath28 to @xmath29 dex kpc@xmath28 .",
    "these relatively small changes point out the fact that dynamics alone can only marginally affect the initial radial chemical distribution .",
    "figure [ fig : metdist ] shows the radial chemical distribution of the simulated disk particles after 6.1 gyr of dynamical evolution .",
    "the particles are taken within a few kpc from the solar circle ( between @xmath30 kpc and @xmath31 kpc ) , at different intervals of @xmath6 .",

    "we have measured @xmath32}/dr$ ] by calculating the median of the chemical distribution in bins of @xmath36 kpc in @xmath2 and fitting a straight line to those medians , taking into account the 1-@xmath37 width of the distribution of the data in each bin ; the gradient uncertainties are taken as the 1-@xmath37 error of the fit to the medians .",
    "recently , @xcite examined the metallicity distribution ( in @xmath2 and @xmath6 ) in the galactic thick disk , using f , g and k dwarf stars selected from sdss dr8 .",
    "we compare our simulation with their sample of kinematically selected thick disk stars . here",
    "we consider only the results derived by carrell et al .",
    "( 2012 ) for @xmath38 kpc , in order to minimize the contamination of thin disk stars ( bensby et al . 2011 ) .",
    "@xcite measured the metallicity gradient in the radial directions for stars in the annular region ( @xmath39 kpc @xmath40 kpc from the galactic center ) and at several distances from the galactic plane . for thick disk stars they obtained an increasing @xmath32}/dr$ ] with @xmath6 , from @xmath41 dex kpc@xmath28 for @xmath42 kpc@xmath43 kpc to @xmath44 dex kpc@xmath28 for @xmath45 kpc @xmath46 kpc ( isochrone distance method ) .",
    "these results are consistent , within 1-@xmath37 uncertainties , with a constant positive slope of @xmath47 dex kpc@xmath28 for the isochrone distance method and a slope of @xmath48 dex kpc@xmath28 for the photometric distance method .",
    "a mild positive gradient of @xmath49 dex kpc@xmath28 was also measured by @xcite , among @xmath7 -enhanced stars with @xmath50 located between @xmath51 kpc and @xmath52 kpc .",
    "our results suggest a mildly decreasing positive slope of the order of @xmath53 dex kpc@xmath28 .",
    "the evolution of the radial gradients in the solar neighborood is illustrated in figure [ fig : grad_evol ] .",
    "the initial radial gradients are given by the model we use to assign the metallicities and , as there is no initial dependence on @xmath6 , the radial gradients at different @xmath6 have approximately the same values .",
    "these profiles reach a substantial stability between @xmath54 and 6 gyr , for 0 kpc @xmath55 2.5 kpc .    after 6 gyr of evolution of our model galaxy",
    ", we do not see any obvious trend in the vertical metallicity gradients as a function of radial distance from the galactic center . we find a significant , but tiny , positive @xmath32}/d|z| $ ] of @xmath56 dex kpc@xmath28 for the stars in the radial and vertical ranges @xmath39 kpc @xmath40 kpc and @xmath57 kpc @xmath58 kpc . on the other hand @xcite measured @xmath32}/d|z| = -0.113\\pm0.010 $ ] dex kpc@xmath28 for the whole sample of thick disk stars in the same spatial region .",

    "the crucial role of a positive slope @xmath32}/dr$ ] in the inner disk for the primordial chemical distribution to produce a positive rotation - metallicity correlation in the thick disk @xcite was already shown in @xcite . in this work",
    "we have analyzed how the same cosmologically motivated chemical distribution allows us to constrain the influence of the dynamical evolution on the metallicity gradients observed today in the mw thick disk .",
    "we have drawn the radial and vertical chemical distributions from the same simulated mw galaxy used in @xcite , which includes a _ positive _ radial chemical gradient in the inner disk . at 6.1 gyr , within the solar neighborhood ( @xmath39 kpc @xmath65 kpc )",
    ", we still obtain a positive slope for the radial chemical distribution in the inner region .",
    "this slope decreases in going from @xmath66 kpc to the region @xmath45 kpc @xmath58 kpc ( @xmath32}/dr = 0.016\\pm0.002 $ ] dex kpc@xmath28 and @xmath32}/dr = 0.011\\pm0.007 $ ] dex kpc@xmath28 , respectively ) .",
    "the radial chemical gradients predicted by the model are at most within a factor of 2 of those observed by @xcite , with the photometric distance method , and by @xcite .",
    "our final positive radial gradients are a direct consequence of our initial conditions , that include a positive radial gradient in the inner disk .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : grad_evol ] , the radial gradients in the solar neighborhood are of the same order from 1.8 gyr to 6.1 gyr , independently of the layer in @xmath6 ( although some redistribution appears to take place ) .",
    "such a stability seen between @xmath67 and @xmath68 gyr is consistent with the stability of the rotation - metallicity correlation pointed out by @xcite in the same time range .",
    "furthermore , the vertical gradient in the final configuration of our simulation is very close to zero .",
    "this originates from the fact that we do not impose any dependence on @xmath6 in the initial chemical distribution .",
    "the lack of a @xmath6-dependence is also responsible from the lack of a trend for the radial gradients to increase with @xmath6 .",
    "we conclude that the secular disk evolution does _ not _ appear to be able to modify significantly the disk global chemical profiles , suggesting that the radial and vertical chemical distribution of the thick disk is likely to be a fossil signature of the original distribution .",
    "our results indicate that , if the positive radial metallicity gradient in the solar neighborhood will be confirmed by the observations of the milky way thick disk , this is consistent with a thick disk population showing an early positive [ fe / h ] radial gradient in the inner disk ( @xmath69 kpc ) and negative in the outer disk ( @xmath70 kpc ) . in the context of the inside - out formation scenarios of the galactic disk @xcite ,",
    "such a gradient `` inversion '' derives from the strong infall of primordial gas that can occur at early times in the inner disk .",
