    "in multi - agent pursuit - evasion problems one or more pursuers try to maneuver and reach a relatively small distance with respect to one or more evaders , which strive to escape the pursuers .",
    "this problem is usually posed as a dynamic game @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "thus , a dynamic voronoi diagram has been used in problems with several pursuers in order to capture an evader within a bounded domain @xcite , @xcite . on the other hand , @xcite presented a receding - horizon approach that provides evasive maneuvers for an unmanned autonomous vehicle ( uav ) assuming a known model of the pursuer s input , state , and constraints . in @xcite ,",
    "a multi - agent scenario is considered where a number of pursuers are assigned to intercept a group of evaders and where the goals of the evaders are assumed to be known .",
    "cooperation between two agents with the goal of evading a single pursuer has been addressed in @xcite and @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we consider a zero - sum three - agent pursuit - evasion differential game .",
    "a two - agent team is formed which consists of a target ( @xmath0 ) and a defender ( @xmath1 ) who cooperate ; the attacker ( @xmath2 ) is the opposition .",
    "the goal of the attacker is to capture the target while the target tries to evade the attacker and avoid capture .",
    "the target cooperates with the defender which pursues and tries to intercept the attacker before the latter captures the target .",
    "cooperation between the target and the defender is such that the defender will capture the attacker before the latter reaches the target .",
    "such a scenario of active target defense has been analyzed in the context of cooperative optimal control in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "indeed , sensing capabilities of missiles and aircraft allow for implementation of complex pursuit and evasion strategies @xcite , @xcite , and more recent work has investigated different guidance laws for the agents @xmath2 and @xmath1 .",
    "thus , in @xcite the authors addressed the case where the defender implements command to the line of sight ( clos ) guidance to pursue the attacker which requires the defender to have at least the same speed as the attacker . in @xcite the end - game for the tad scenario",
    "was analyzed based on the minimization / maximization of the attacker / target miss distance for a _ non - cooperative _ target / defender pair .",
    "the authors develop linearization - based attacker maneuvers in order to evade the defender and continue pursuing the target . a different guidance law for the target - attacker - defender ( tad ) scenario was given by yamasaki _ et.al .",
    "_ @xcite , @xcite .",
    "these authors investigated an interception method called triangle guidance ( tg ) , where the objective is to command the defending missile to be on the line - of - sight between the attacking missile and the aircraft for all time , while the target aircraft follows some predetermined trajectory .",
    "the authors show , through simulations , that tg provides better performance in terms of defender control effort than a number of variants of proportional navigation ( pn ) guidance laws , that is , when the defender uses pn to pursue the attacker instead of tg .",
    "the previous approaches constrain and limit the level of cooperation between the target and the defender by implementing defender guidance laws without regard to the target s trajectory .",
    "different types of cooperation have been recently proposed in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite for the tad scenario . in @xcite optimal policies ( lateral acceleration for each agent including the attacker ) were provided for the case of an aggressive defender , that is , the defender has a definite maneuverability advantage .",
    "a linear quadratic optimization problem was posed where the defender s control effort weight is driven to zero to increase its aggressiveness . the work @xcite provided a game theoretical analysis of the tad problem using different guidance laws for both the attacker and the defender .",
    "the cooperative strategies in @xcite allow for a maneuverability disadvantage for the defender with respect to the attacker and the results show that the optimal target maneuver is either constant or arbitrary .",
    "shaferman and shima @xcite implemented a multiple model adaptive estimator ( mmae ) to identify the guidance law and parameters of the incoming missile and optimize a defender strategy to minimize its control effort .",
    "in the recent paper @xcite the authors analyze different types of cooperation assuming the attacker is oblivious of the defender and its guidance law is known .",
    "two different one - way cooperation strategies were discussed : when the defender acts independently , the target knows its future behavior and cooperates with the defender , and vice versa .",
    "two - way cooperation where both target and defender communicate continuously to exchange their states and controls is also addressed , and it is shown to have a better performance than the other types of cooperation - as expected .    our preliminary work @xcite , @xcite considered the cases when the attacker implements typical guidance laws of pure pursuit ( pp ) and pn , respectively . in these papers , the target - defender team solves an _ optimal control _ problem that returns the optimal strategy for the @xmath3 team so that @xmath1 intercepts the attacker and at the same time the separation between target and attacker at the instant of interception of @xmath2 by @xmath1 is maximized .",
    "the cooperative optimal guidance approach was extended ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) to consider a differential game where also the attacker missile solves an optimal control problem in order to minimize the final separation between itself and the target . in this paper , we focus on characterizing the region of the reduced state space formed by the agents initial positions for which survival of the target is guaranteed when both the target and the defender employ their optimal strategies . the optimal strategies for each one of the three agents participating in the active target defense differential game are provided in this paper as well .    the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : problem ] describes the engagement scenario .",
    "section [ sec : analysis ] presents optimal strategies for each one of the three participants in order to solve the differential game discussed in the paper .",
    "the target escape region is characterized in section [ sec : escape ] .",
    "examples are given in section [ sec : example ] and concluding remarks are made in section [ sec : concl ] .",
    "the active target defense engagement in the realistic plane @xmath4 is illustrated in figure [ fig : problem description ] .",
    "the speeds of the target , attacker , and defender are denoted by @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 , respectively , and are assumed to be constant .",
    "the simple - motion dynamics of the three vehicles in the realistic plane are given by : @xmath8 where the headings of @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 are , respectively , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 .",
    "in this game the attacker pursues the target and tries to capture it .",
    "the target and the defender cooperate in order for the defender interpose himself between the attacker and the target and to intercept the attacker before the latter captures the target .",
    "thus , the target - defender team searches for a cooperative optimal strategy , optimal headings @xmath12 and @xmath13 , to maximize the separation between the target and the attacker at the time instant of the defender - attacker collision .",
    "the attacker will devise its corresponding optimal strategy , optimal heading @xmath14 , in order to minimize the terminal @xmath15 separation / miss distance . define the speed ratio problem parameter @xmath16 .",
    "we assume that the attacker missile is faster than the target aircraft , so that @xmath17 . in this work",
    "we also assume the attacker and defender missiles are somewhat similar , so @xmath18 .    in the following sections",
    "this problem is transformed to an aimpoint problem where each agent finds is optimal aimpoint .",
    "furthermore , it is shown that the solution of the differential game involving three variables ( the aimpoint of each one of the three agents ) is equivalent to the solution of an optimization problem in only one variable .",
    "we now undertake the analysis of the active target defense differential game .",
    "the target ( @xmath0 ) , the attacker ( @xmath2 ) , and the defender ( @xmath1 ) have  simple motion \" @xmath19 la isaacs @xcite .",
    "we also emphasize that @xmath0 , @xmath2 , and @xmath1 have constant speeds of @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "we assume that @xmath20 and the speed ratio @xmath21 .",
    "we confine our attention to point capture , that is , the @xmath22 separation has to become zero in order for the defender to intercept the attacker . @xmath0 and @xmath1 form a team to defend from @xmath2 .",
    "thus , @xmath2 strives to close in on @xmath0 while @xmath0 and @xmath1 maneuver such that @xmath1 intercepts @xmath2 before the latter reaches @xmath0 and the distance at interception time is maximized , while @xmath2 strives to minimize the separation between @xmath0 and @xmath2 at the instant of interception .",
    "since the cost is a function only of the final time ( the interception time instant ) and the agents have simple motion dynamics , the optimal trajectories of each agent are straight lines .    in figure [",
    "fig : one ] the points @xmath2 and @xmath1 represent the initial positions of the attacker and the defender in the reduced state space , respectively .",
    "a cartesian frame is attached to the points @xmath2 and @xmath1 in such a way that the extension to infinity of the segment @xmath23 in both directions represents the @xmath24-axis and the orthogonal bisector of @xmath23 represents the @xmath25-axis .",
    "the state variables are @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 .",
    "notice that all points in the left - half - plane ( lhp ) can be reached by the defender before the attacker does ; similarly , all points in the right - half - plane ( rhp ) can be reached by the attacker before the defender does .    in this paper",
    "we focus on the case where the target is initially closer to the attacker than to the defender ; in other words , assume that @xmath29 .    with respect to figure [ fig : one ] we note that the defender will intercept the attacker at point @xmath30 on the orthogonal bisector of @xmath23 at which time the target will have reached point @xmath31 .",
    "the attacker aims at minimizing the distance between the target at the time instant when the defender intercepts the attacker , that is , the distance between point @xmath31 and point @xmath30 on the orthogonal bisector of @xmath23 where the defender intercepts the attacker ; the points @xmath0 and @xmath31 represent the initial and terminal positions of the target , respectively .      when @xmath29 the attacker and the target are faced with a maxmin optimization problem : the target chooses point @xmath32 and the attacker chooses point @xmath33 on the y - axis , see figure [ fig : maxminej ] .",
    "additionally , the defender tries to intercept the attacker by choosing his aimpoint at point @xmath34 on the y - axis .",
    "thus , the optimization problem is @xmath35 where the function @xmath36 represents the distance between the target terminal position and the point where the attacker is intercepted by the defender .",
    "the target tries to cross the orthogonal bisector of @xmath23 into the lhp where the defender will be able to allow it to escape by intercepting the attacker at the point @xmath37 on the orthogonal bisector of @xmath23 .",
    "therefore , the defender s optimal policy is @xmath38 in order to guarantee interception of the attacker .",
    "the optimality of this choice by the defender will be shown in proposition [ prop : spxtg0 ] .",
    "since the defender s optimal policy is @xmath39 , the decision variables @xmath33 and @xmath32 jointly determine the distance @xmath40 between the target terminal position @xmath31 and the point @xmath37 where the attacker is intercepted by the defender .",
    "this distance is a function of the decision variables @xmath33 and @xmath32 .",
    "thus , the attacker and the target solve the following optimization problem @xmath41 now , let us analyze the possible strategies . if the target chooses @xmath32 , the attacker will respond and choose @xmath33 . if @xmath42 the target would correct his decision and choose some @xmath43 such that @xmath44 , as shown in figure [ fig : maxminej ] for the case where @xmath45 and in figure [ fig : maxminej2 ] for the case where @xmath46 .",
    "in general , choosing @xmath42 is detrimental to the attacker since his cost will increase .",
    "thus , the attacker should aim at the point @xmath32 which is chosen by the target , that is , @xmath47 .",
    "given the cost / payoff function @xmath48 , the solution @xmath49 and @xmath50 of the optimization problem @xmath51 is such that @xmath52 moreover , when @xmath29 , the attacker strategy is @xmath47 so that it suffices to solve the optimization problem @xmath53 where @xmath54",
    "we assume that the attacker is faster than the target , for otherwise the target could always escape without the help of the defender .",
    "thus , we assume that the speed ratio @xmath55 . also , we assume that @xmath29 .",
    "the target needs to be able to break into the lhp before being intercepted by the attacker for the defender to be able to assist the target to escape , by intercepting the attacker who is on route to the target .",
    "thus , a solution to the active target defense differential game exists if and only if the apollonius circle , which is based on the segment @xmath56 and the speed ratio @xmath57 , intersects the orthogonal bisector of @xmath23 .",
    "this imposes a lower limit @xmath58 on the speed ratio , that is , we need @xmath59 .",
    "the critical speed ratio @xmath58 corresponds to the case where the apollonius circle is tangent to the orthogonal bisector of @xmath23 . and",
    "if the speed ratio @xmath60 the target always escapes and there is no need for a defender missile , that is , no target defense differential game is played out .",
    "the optimal strategies for the case @xmath61 can be obtained in a similar way as shown in this paper and the critical speed ratio is @xmath62 .    assume that @xmath29 .",
    "then , the critical speed ratio @xmath58 is a function of the positions of the target and the attacker and is given by @xmath63    _ proof_. the attacker s initial position , the target s initial position , and the center @xmath64 of the apollonius circle are collinear and lie on the dotted straight line in figure [ fig : one ] whose equation is @xmath65 the geometry of the apollonius circle is as follows : the center of the circle , denoted by @xmath64 , is at a distance of @xmath66 from @xmath0 and its radius is @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the distance between @xmath2 and @xmath0 and is given by @xmath69 hence , the following holds @xmath70    % \\label{eq : circleeq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and we calculate the coordinates of the center of the apollonius circle @xmath71 consequently , the critical speed ratio @xmath58 is the positive solution of the quadratic equation @xmath72 which is given by .",
    "@xmath73    in general , it can be seen from figure [ fig : one ] that if @xmath61 then @xmath62 as well .",
    "we will assume @xmath59 , so that a solution to the active target defense differential game exists ; otherwise , if @xmath74 , the defender will not be able to help the target by intercepting the attacker before the latter inevitably captures the target ; and if @xmath60 then the target can always evade the attacker and there is no need for a defender .",
    "when the target is on the side of the attacker , the target chooses its aimpoint , denoted by @xmath30 , on the orthogonal bisector of @xmath23 in order to maximize its payoff function , the final separation between target and attacker , and where @xmath75 represents the coordinate of the aimpoint @xmath30 on the orthogonal bisector of @xmath23 .",
    "this is so because the attacker will aim at the point @xmath30 . in order to minimize",
    "the optimal strategy of the attacker is to choose the same aimpoint @xmath30 on the orthogonal bisector of @xmath23 , where it will be intercepted by the defender .    in order to find the maximum of we differentiate eq . in @xmath75 and set the resulting derivative equal to zero @xmath76 the following quartic equation in @xmath77 is obtained @xmath78    in the sequel we focus on the case @xmath55 .",
    "in addition and without loss of generality assume that @xmath79 .",
    "let us divide both sides of eq .",
    "by @xmath80 and set @xmath81 , @xmath82 , and @xmath83 , whereupon the quartic equation assumes the canonical form @xmath84 we are interested in the real and positive solutions @xmath85 of the canonical quartic equation .",
    "has two real solutions , @xmath86 when @xmath87 , has two repeated solutions at @xmath88 and two complex solutions @xmath89 .    _",
    "remark_. writing the quartic equation as @xmath90 we see that @xmath91 , @xmath92 , and @xmath93 . therefore , equation has two real solutions .",
    "equation has a real solution @xmath94 and an additional real solution @xmath95 , provided that @xmath96 .",
    "note that the quartic equation is parameterized by @xmath97 , so whether @xmath29 or @xmath61 makes no difference as far as the solutions to the quartic equation are concerned .",
    "however , if @xmath61 the applicable real solution is @xmath98 , whereas if @xmath29 the applicable real solution is @xmath99 .",
    "when @xmath29 , by choosing his heading , the target ( and the defender ) thus choose the coordinate @xmath75 to maximize @xmath100 ; that is , @xmath75 is the target s ( and defender s ) choice .",
    "then the payoff is given by eq . and",
    "the expression for @xmath101 was shown in .",
    "the second derivative of the payoff function @xmath102 the target is choosing @xmath75 to maximize the cost @xmath100 .",
    "now , the attacker reacts by heading towards the point @xmath30 on the orthogonal bisector of @xmath23 where , invariably , he will be intercepted by the defender .",
    "both the target and the attacker know that the three points @xmath103 must be collinear .",
    "the defender will not allow the attacker to cross the orthogonal bisector because then the attacker will start to close in on the target .",
    "the optimal coordinate @xmath104 is the solution of the quartic equation such that the second - order condition for a maximum holds on @xmath105 . in view of",
    "we know that @xmath106 and inserting into yields @xmath107 we have that @xmath105 if and only if @xmath108 hence , the first real solution @xmath109 of the quartic equation does not fulfill the role of yielding a maximum and the second real solution @xmath110 of is the candidate solution . it is the target who chooses @xmath104 to maximize the payoff @xmath100 .",
    "note that @xmath111 and @xmath112 , where @xmath113 and @xmath114 are the real solutions of .",
    "inserting eq . into eq .",
    "yields the target and defender payoff @xmath115 and using @xmath116 @xmath117 when @xmath118 we have that @xmath119 .",
    "hence , the solution @xmath110 of the quartic equation must satisfy @xmath120 this situation is illustrated in figure [ fig : opsol ] where the three points @xmath0 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 are collinear .",
    "concerning expression , we also need the solution of the quartic equation to satisfy @xmath121 the second real solution @xmath122 of the quartic equation must satisfy    @xmath123    the points of intersection of the apollonius circle with the @xmath75-axis ( the orthogonal bisector ) are @xmath124 and @xmath125 , where @xmath124 and @xmath125 are the solutions of the quadratic equation @xmath126 where the distance @xmath127 and the apollonius circle s center coordinates are given by .",
    "we have that @xmath128 where @xmath129 because @xmath118 and , from , we have that @xmath130 .",
    "hence , @xmath131 which results in @xmath132 the target s choice of the optimal @xmath104 , namely , the solution @xmath122 of the quartic equation must satisfy the inequalities @xmath133    [ prop : spxtg0 ] ( saddle point equilibrium ) . consider the case @xmath29 .",
    "the strategy @xmath104 of the target , where @xmath104 is the real solution of the quartic equation which maximizes , and the strategy of the defender of heading to the point @xmath134 , together with the strategy of the attacker of aiming at the point @xmath134 , constitute a strategic saddle point , that is @xmath135",
    "in this section we analyze the target s escape region for given target and attacker speeds , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "in other words , for given speed ratio @xmath16 . consider the active target defense differential game where the attacker and the defender missiles have the same speeds .",
    "when @xmath29 , the critical value of the speed ratio parameter @xmath58 can be obtained as a function of the attacker s and the target s coordinates @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 such that the target is guaranteed to escape since the defender will be able to intercept the attacker before the latter reaches the target .",
    "now , for a given target s speed ratio , @xmath57 , and for given attacker s initial position , @xmath26 , we wish to characterize the region of the reduced state space for which the target is guaranteed to escape . in other words",
    ", we want to separate the reduced state space into two regions : @xmath136 and @xmath137 .",
    "the region @xmath136 is defined as the set of all coordinate pairs @xmath4 such that if the target s initial position @xmath138 is inside this region , then , it is guaranteed to escape the attacker if both the target and the defender implement their corresponding optimal strategies .",
    "the region @xmath137 , represents all other coordinate pairs @xmath4 in the reduced state space where the target s escape is not guaranteed .    for given speed ratio @xmath57 and for given attacker s initial position @xmath26 in the reduced state space , the curve that divides the reduced state space into the two regions @xmath136 and @xmath137 is characterized by the right branch of the following hyperbola ( that is , @xmath139 ) @xmath140    _ proof_. the requirement for the target to escape being captured by the attacker",
    "is that the apollonius circle intersects the y - axis .",
    "the radius of the apollonius circle is @xmath141 and the x - coordinate of its center is @xmath142 if @xmath143 , we need @xmath144 for the defender to be of any help to the target .",
    "thus , @xmath145 , @xmath146 , and @xmath29 must satisfy the condition @xmath147 equivalently , @xmath148 which is also equivalent to @xmath149 when the ` greater than ' sign in inequality is changed to ` equal ' sign , the resulting equation defines the curve that divides the reduced state space into regions @xmath136 and @xmath137 . additionally , since the symmetric case @xmath150 can be treated in a similar way as the case @xmath79 , we do not need to restrict @xmath28 to be greater than or equal to zero .",
    "thus , the coordinate pairs @xmath4 such that @xmath151 can be written in the hyperbola canonical form shown in .",
    "@xmath73    _ remark_. note that for a given speed ratio @xmath57 , the family of hyperbolas characterized by different values of @xmath145 shares the same center which is located at @xmath152 , and the same asymptotes which are given by the lines @xmath153 and @xmath154 .",
    "one can also see that , for @xmath55 , the slope of the asymptotes increases as @xmath57 decreases and viceversa .",
    "this behavior is expected since a relatively faster target will be able to escape the attacker when starting at the same position as a relatively slower target .",
    "it is important to emphasize that if @xmath155 then capture of the target by the attacker is guaranteed if the attacker employs its optimal strategy . in this case",
    "the optimal strategies described in section [ subsec : optimal ] will result in @xmath156 .",
    "@xmath157 being negative makes sense in terms of the differential game formulated in this paper ( recall that the attacker tries to minimize @xmath100 ) .",
    "however , the cost / payoff function @xmath100 represents a distance and it does not make sense for it to be negative in the real scenario where the attacker tries to capture the target , i.e. the terminal separation @xmath56 should be zero instead of negative . based on the solution of the differential game presented in section [ subsec : optimal ] , the attacker is able to redefine its strategy and capture the target , that is , to obtain @xmath158 .",
    "the new strategy is as follows .",
    "the attacker , by solving the differential game and obtaining the optimal cost / payoff , realizes that @xmath156 , then , it simply redefines its optimal strategy to be @xmath159 .",
    "the details when the optimal strategies of section [ subsec : optimal ] result in @xmath156 are as follows .",
    "@xmath0 chooses his aimpoint to be @xmath160 that lies on the apollonius circle . @xmath2",
    "realizes that @xmath156 ( equivalently , the apollonius circle does not intersect the y - axis ) and chooses his aimpoint @xmath161 also on the apollonius circle - see figure [ fig : jneg ] . given @xmath0 s choice of @xmath160 , the soonest @xmath2 can make @xmath158 is by capturing @xmath0 on the apollonius circle ( otherwise the target will exit the apollonius circle and the defender may be able to assist the target ) .",
    "thus , @xmath159 .",
    "similarly , @xmath0 solves the differential game and obtains @xmath156 .",
    "this information is useful to @xmath0 and it realizes that @xmath1 is unable to intercept @xmath2 . thus , @xmath0 will be prepared to apply passive countermeasures such as releasing chaff and flares .",
    "@xmath0 can also change its objective and find some @xmath162 in order to optimize a different criterion such as to maximize capture time ; however , this topic falls outside the scope of this paper .",

    "<S> the aircraft is however aided by a defender missile launched by , say , the wingman , to intercept the attacker before it reaches the target aircraft . </S>",
    "<S> thus , a team is formed by the target and the defender which cooperate to maximize the separation between the target aircraft and the point where the attacker missile is intercepted by the defender missile , while the attacker simultaneously tries to minimize said distance . </S>",
    "<S> this paper focuses on characterizing the set of coordinates such that if the target s initial position belong to this set then its survival is guaranteed if both the target and the defender follow their optimal strategies . </S>",
    "<S> such optimal strategies are presented in this paper as well . </S>"
