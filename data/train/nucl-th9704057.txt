    "while it is generally accepted that quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) provides a basic framework for all reactions involving strongly interacting particles , we still seem to be very far away from implementing qcd in practical calculations aimed at describing the findings of experiments from low to intermediate energies of up to a few gev . instead , effective fieldtheoretical descriptions in terms of purely hadronic degrees of freedom are usually employed , where qcd is assumed to provide the justification for the parameters or cutoff functions assumed in the various approaches .",
    "central to our ability to describe experiments in these effective terms  and , most importantly , central to our ability to tell when this effective approach would no longer be applicable  is a detailed understanding of the most basic hadronic interactions , namely the reaction dynamics of nucleons , pions , and photons .",
    "it is the purpose of the present paper to provide a comprehensive theoretical description of the production of pions due to the interactions of incident photons with nucleons .",
    "the history of such descriptions goes back to the fifties , and indeed many of the ( global ) basic relations have been well - known for about forty years ( see @xcite and , in particular , @xcite , and references therein ) . in recent years , the attention has focused on approaches attempting to take into account the fact that all hadrons involved in the reaction have an internal structure @xcite .",
    "the present investigation would like to add to the latter approaches by providing a detailed theoretical framework for the gauge - invariant interactions of physical  i.e. , fully dressed  hadrons with photons .",
    "the description is given in terms of an effective field theory where the ( at present , in detail unknown ) quark and gluon degrees of freedom are parametrized by the bare quantities of the effective lagrangian . since many of the most basic relations governing the interactions of hadrons and photons relate electromagnetic to purely hadronic entities ( the most important example being the ward - takahashi identities @xcite ) , it seems obvious that a comprehensive formulation can only be achieved if the purely hadronic sector of the problem is treated completely consistently with the subsequent electromagnetic interaction .",
    "therefore , in order to be able to develop the present description from the ground up , we will , in sec .",
    "ii , provide a recapitulation of the interactions of nucleons and pions that will form the basis for the ensuing investigations regarding the photoproduction of pions .",
    "the formulation given here for @xmath0 is a nonlinear one where the full solution of the hadronic scattering problem couples back into the driving term of the reaction . despite the practical complications entailed by nonlinear @xmath3 scattering equations , we feel very strongly that , from both formal and practical points of view , the nonlinear approach is better suited to exhibit the true dynamics of the interaction , and as a consequence , if a problem needs to be treated as a linear one because of practical considerations , starting from the full nonlinear set of equations usually will suggest an approximation strategy closer to the true underlying physical mechanisms than starting from linearized assumptions from the very beginning .    the physical currents for all processes contributing to the pion production amplitude are derived here via their corresponding hadronic @xmath2-point green s functions .",
    "however , instead of the usual procedure ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) of employing minimal substitution and a subsequent functional derivative with respect to the electromagnetic field @xmath4 , we introduce an equivalent , but practically simpler , mathematical operation called a `` gauge derivative '' which allows one to obtain currents directly from the momentum - space versions of the respective green s functions .",
    "the technical details of this are explained in the appendix . using the hadronic results of sec .",
    "ii as a starting point for the definitions of all relevant @xmath2-point green s functions , we arrive in sec .",
    "iii at a consistent formulation of the pion photoproduction process where all reaction mechanisms are given in terms of fully dressed hadronic propagators and vertex functions .",
    "the electromagnetic current for the physical ( i.e. , dressed ) nucleon , in particular , contains all contributions from the nucleon s self - energy .",
    "again , the results are found to be highly nonlinear and , hence , the proof of gauge invariance of the formalism can only be one of self - consistency , where we show , in sec .",
    "iv , that assuming the validity of the ward - takahashi identities @xcite will provide a gauge - invariant pion photoproduction amplitude which in turn will allow us to get back the ward - takahashi identities for the dressed hadron currents in a self - consistent manner . in performing this proof , we observe that the gauge - invariance conditions for all current mechanisms inside of a hadronic interaction region  as opposed to pieces arising from the photon s interaction with external legs of the reaction  take the form of continuity equations with `` surface '' terms . using the example of the electromagnetic current associated with the bare vertex as a starting point , in sec .",
    "v , it is shown in the concluding sec .",
    "vi how one can turn this into a consistent approximation scheme that allows one to preserve the gauge invariance of the formalism even if one chooses to linearize the problem by altering appropriately the driving terms for the underlying @xmath5 scattering problem .",
    "this approximation scheme is one of the most important practical results of the present investigation .",
    "while , at first glance , some of the resulting expressions might look similar to ohta s @xcite way of dealing with extended nucleons , it will be seen that there are considerable differences in detail which even leads to a simpler implementation in practice ( with , for example , none of the problems pointed out in ref .",
    "moreover , we also argue in sec .",
    "vi that the approximation scheme suggested here for the @xmath3 system can also be used for other reactions irrespective of the type or number of contributing hadrons .",
    "as explained in the introduction , the basis of a consistent treatment of the reaction dynamics of pions , nucleons , and photons is a complete formulation of the purely hadronic sector of the problem , i.e. , @xmath0 . to simplify the presentation , we will in the following only consider pion - nucleon interactions proceeding through the @xmath7 and the @xmath8 channels .",
    "moreover , the only bound or resonance states taken into account in these channels will be the nucleon , @xmath9 , and the delta , @xmath10 , respectively .",
    "also , we will allow for @xmath11 interactions that give rise to @xmath12 and @xmath13 degrees of freedom .",
    "other meson contribution will not be treated here .",
    "we thus keep the reaction dynamics simple enough to be amenable to a concise presentation , yet sufficiently detailed to avoid being trivial .",
    "however , we emphasize that none of these restrictions are essential ; a more elaborate dynamical picture can easily be obtained following the lines presented here .",
    "many , if not most , aspects of the following treatment of hadronic @xmath3 dynamics are well known ( see refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "nevertheless , we feel that it is necessary to recapitulate them here in order to provide a completely consistent background against which the investigations of secs .",
    "iii and iv regarding the gauge invariance of the pion photoproduction amplitude needs to be seen .",
    "generically , the bare lagrangian for the nucleon is given by @xcite    @xmath14    where the index @xmath15 stands for `` bare '' and @xmath16 includes all the interactions relevant for the nucleon ; in general , @xmath16 will also contain other fields .",
    "we assume here that the bare quantities have been obtained from qcd , subsuming the quark and gluon degrees of freedom that can not be described by purely hadronic dynamics . at the hadronic level , for the nucleon",
    "the only remnants of this procedure are the bare mass , @xmath17 , and a bare vertex function for @xmath18 , @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the bare coupling constant and @xmath21 the coupling operator .",
    "the function @xmath22  which in practical terms is free input , since the qcd problem has not ( yet ) been solved  provides the necessary cutoff to make all integrals convergent .",
    "for @xmath21 we are only going to consider pseudoscalar , @xmath23 , or pseudovector , @xmath24 , couplings .",
    "( again , a more general coupling structure can easily be accommodated following the outline given here . )",

    "v , this will have some bearing on the investigation of gauge invariance of the pion photoamplitude .    renormalizing the lagrangian in the usual way @xcite by    @xmath28    yields    @xmath29    the inverse of the corresponding momentum - space propagator",

    ", the bare vertex ( [ eq1 - 1 ] ) and the renormalization conditions ( [ eq7 ] ) and ( [ eq8 ] ) need to be modified accordingly .",
    "the conditions for a resonance , rather than a bound state , are obtained by replacing the self - energy by its real part and the bound - state mass by the real part of the resonance position .",
    "also , the spin1/2 propagator needs to be replaced by one for spin3/2 .",
    "since it has no direct bearing on the treatment given here , we will not go into further details .      in complete analogy to the preceding nucleon treatment",
    ", one may derive a dressed pion propagator @xmath43 given by @xcite @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the ( physical ) pion mass , @xmath46 the pion self - energy , and @xmath47 the renormalization of the pion field .",
    "however , for the present report , the details of this dressing are not important ; we merely require that @xmath46 be such that the dressed pion propagator allows for a ward - takahashi identity @xcite in analogy to what will be derived for the nucleon .",
    "we emphasize that this can indeed be achieved quite straightforwardly by applying to the pion the corresponding steps outlined below for the nucleon .",
    "for all practical purposes , we may even replace @xmath10 by the bare pion propagator @xmath48 , @xmath49 without changing any of the findings reported here .      in a graphical picture , for each of the two channels considered here for @xmath50 scattering , there will be infinitely many graphs contributing to each @xmath38-matrix arising from the nucleon lagrangian ( [ eq1 ] ) and its delta counterpart .",
