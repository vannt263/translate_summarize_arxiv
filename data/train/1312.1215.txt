    "the dynamics of polymer barrier crossing has attracted considerable attention in recent years , not only for basic understanding of numerous biological processes , but also for many practical applications .",
    "biopolymers often need to surmount an entropic or energetic barrier for biological functions and in biotechnological applications , such as gene therapy , protein translocation , etc  @xcite .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite studied the transport of double - stranded dna ( dsdna ) molecules through a fabricated channel of alternating thickness , driven by electric field . within the relatively wide channels of",
    "one micron thick , the dna are trapped in a coiled conformation . when an electric field drives the dna into narrow channels , the chain , being severely confined and suffering a free energy barrier , becomes stretched .",
    "they found counterintuitively that the longer dna molecules move faster than the shorter ones .",
    "the authors explained it is attributable to the fact that longer dnas have larger contact area with the thin region and thus higher probability to escape the free energy barrier .",
    "the origin of the free energy barrier is the competition between the electric potential energy and the confinement entropy characteristic of the polymer .",
    "a similar effect has been reported for polymer translocation through long nanoscale channels @xcite .",
    "this transport process can be viewed as an extension of the famous kramers problem  @xcite of a brownian particle crossing an activation energy barrier . as an interconnected many - particle system ,",
    "the long chain polymer manifests cooperative dynamics in the presence of internal noise and external fields . depending upon various length scales such as the chain contour length , radius of gyration , stretching and bending stiffnesses and other relevant parameters ,",
    "many features emerge . for contour length much smaller than the width of a metastable potential as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : potential ] , park and sung  @xcite developed multi - dimension generalization of the kramers rate .",
    "they found that the rate of polymer crossing the barrier is enhanced due to its flexibility .",
    "in particular , the flexibility enables the chain coiled in the well to stretch at the barrier top , which significantly lowers the activation energy , and enhances the barrier crossing rate .",
    "also similar features were found in a double well potential , both for the flexible  @xcite and semiflexible ring polymers @xcite . in the opposite regime where the contour length is much larger than the potential width , sebastian _ et al . _",
    "@xcite suggested that the flexible polymers cross the barrier by excitation and motion of a kink and an anti - kink pair along the contour .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite studied a similar mechanism for semiflexible polymers . because the kinks are a local property of the chain , activation energies are independent of the contour length and the barrier crossing rate monotonically decreases with the polymer contour length . for the intermediate cases of the semiflexible and self - avoiding polymers where the radii of gyration are comparable to the width of the potential barrier , crossing dynamics",
    "has not yet been studied either analytically or numerically .",
    "computer simulation is a useful tool to study complex systems , complementing analytical methods .",
    "since the rate of polymer crossing over the barrier can become very small for high barriers or long chains , conventional simulations using either molecular dynamics or brownian dynamics are impractical because of long computing time required . to overcome this limitation , voter  @xcite proposed the so - called hyperdynamics ( hd ) simulation method of accelerating the rate by raising the well bottom with an appropriate correction factor for the cases where the transition state theory ( tst ) is valid .",
    "recently , two groups ( @xcite , @xcite ) introduced the path integral hyperdynamics ( pihd ) method , for the langevin dynamics of a single brownian particle .",
    "unlike hd , pihd allows an _ exact _ correction of accelerated dynamics without the tst assumption . in the present work",
    "we extend the pihd method to a chain of many - particle systems , namely , polymers , where the internal degrees of freedom contribute significantly to the total free energy of the system .",
    "we examine flexible , semiflexible , and self - avoiding polymers escaping a metastable well using the pihd method .",
    "we consider the polymer s radius of gyration @xmath2 that is either smaller or comparable to the width of the potential well .",
    "we focus on the dependence of the escape rates on the contour length @xmath1 ( or bead number @xmath3 ) , chain stiffness , and excluded volume effect .",
    "we study how the chain s conformation and its transition affects the crossing rates .",
