    "some nir flares have been found to be highly polarized .",
    "most flares normally have x - ray counterparts , which strongly suggests synchrotron or synchrotron self compton ( ssc ) processes as the radiation mechanism .",
    "nir spectroscopic observations have shown that the observed spectra of nir flares can be fitted well with a power - law , @xmath3 ( where @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the flux density , frequency and spectral index respectively ) .",

    "as we will discuss later , in our modeling the main flare is caused by a local event close to the marginally stable orbit ( mso ) which spreads out via a shock wave and produces a temporary hot torus around the black hole ( fig .",

    "the starting engine of the event could be magnetic reconnections , stochastic acceleration of electrons due to mhd waves or magneto rotational instabilities ( mri ) inside the plasma .",

    "as part of a large observing campaign , sgr  a * was observed in may 2007 and july 2005 using the vlt .",
    "the observations of sgr  a * were carried out in the nir k@xmath8-band ( 2.0 - 2.36@xmath9 m ) using the nir camera conica and the adaptive optics ( ao ) module naos on the european southern observatory s very large telescope ut4 on paranal , chile , during the nights between 29 and 30 july 2005 as well as 14 and 15 may 2007 . the infrared wavefront sensor of naos was used to lock the ao loop on the nir bright ( k - band magnitude @xmath106.5 ) supergiant irs  7 , located about @xmath11 north of sgr  a*. therefore the ao module was able to provide a stable correction with a high strehl ratio .",

    "as mentioned above we interpret qpos according to the existence of an orbiting asymmetry in the flaring region of the accretion disk close to the mso of the black hole .",
    "the fact that the frequency of these qpos is comparable to the mso s dynamical time for a black hole with the mass of sgr  a * , gives more strength to the assumption of an orbiting bright region ( so called `` spots '' ) . in our modeling",
    "we simulate the relativistic effects by using the ky code ( dovciak et al .",
    "it takes into account the relativistic effects ( relativistic beaming , redshifts and blue - shifts , lensing , time delays , change of the emission angle and change of polarization angle ) using a slim disk approximation .",
    "this allows us to fit the model parameters to the actual data .",

    "the magnetic field configuration is such that the resulting projected e - vector is always perpendicular to the equatorial plane ( see also shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) . as a second configuration we have allowed for a global toroidal magnetic field .    by using a simple approach which considers only the rise and fall times of the observed flux",
    ", one can put an upper limit on the characteristic size of the emitting region . for a shakura - sunyaev - type accretion disk and in case that self gravity effects can be neglected ( very close to the black hole ) , we can use the standard one - zone approximation of the vertical hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "this approximation relates the azimuthal velocity , the sound velocity , the thickness of the disk , and the radius to each other ( see the discussion by meyer et al .",
    "2006 ) . in order to assign an upper limit to the size of the emitting region @xmath17",
    ", we use the minimum of a stable dynamical time related to the maximally rotating black hole ( @xmath18 ) , @xmath19  min , and typical observed rise time of the flux , @xmath20 min . for a geometrically thin disk ( @xmath21 )",
    "this leads to @xmath22 .",
    "evidence from mhd simulations indicates that the dynamical transition from rotational support to free fall which occurs in the vicinity of the mso could be the source of magnetic or thermal instabilities ( krolik & hawley 2002 ) .",
    "together with the assumption that the radiation edge of the accretion disk is located very close to the marginally stable orbit ( krolik & hawley 2002 ) , one could put a constraint on the spin of the black hole . if the observed 20 min nir modulations are related to the orbiting spots",
    ", the radius of their orbit must be much smaller than the marginally stable orbit of a schwarzschild black hole .",
    "the above considerations imply that the dimensionless spin parameter reaches a minimum value of 0.5 ( see also eckart et al .",
    "2004 , meyer et al .",
    "2006a , b ) .",
    "since we focus only on modeling of the nir flares , it is sufficient to pick up the simple power - law model for the non - thermal electrons energy distribution : @xmath23 , with a sharp cut - off energy @xmath24 .",
    "this leads to a simple formula for the synchrotron emission : @xmath25 , where @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the normalization constant , the number density of the electrons , the spectral energy index and perpendicular component of the magnetic field projected onto the plane of an observer co - moving with the plasma , respectively .",
    "@xmath30 is the first stokes parameter . since it is proved observationally that there exists a turn - over frequency in the sub - millimeter to nir range , by using the turn - over ferquency formula one could assign an upper limit on @xmath31 .",
