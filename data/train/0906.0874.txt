    "in recent years , the theory of optimal transport has been actively studied . in particular ,",
    "properties of the optimal transport map on riemannian manifolds are well established .",
    "the existence and uniqueness theorem for the optimal transport map on riemannian manifolds was proved by @xcite ; this result extended the pioneering work of @xcite for the euclidean case .",

    "it is useful to consider convex combinations of convex functions in order to construct various probability density functions ( @xcite , @xcite ) . in this paper",
    ", we show that when the underlying space is the sphere , the convex combination of cost - convex functions is actually cost - convex ( lemma  [ lem : convex ] ) and the jacobian determinant of the resultant gradient map is log - concave with respect to the convex combination ( theorem  [ thm : jacobian ] ) .",
    "this result is an extension of the jacobian interpolation inequality shown by @xcite .",
    "we refer to our jacobian inequality as _ the jacobian inequality _ throughout this paper , for simplicity .",
    "our result is related to the regularity theory of optimal transport maps .",
    "here we consider some recent studies in this field .",
    "@xcite showed that regularity of the transport map for general cost functions on euclidean space is assured if a geometrical quantity called the _ cost - sectional curvature _ is positive .",
    "conversely , @xcite showed that non - negativity of the cost - sectional curvature is necessary for regularity .",
    "he also showed that non - negativity of the cost - sectional curvature implies non - negativity of the usual sectional curvature if the cost function is the squared distance on a riemannian manifold .",

    "we define a probability density function on the sphere by the gradient maps of cost - convex functions .",
    "although , in the context of optimal transport , one usually considers push - forward of probability densities , we construct a family of densities by means of _ pull - back _ of probability densities .",
    "this follows from the fact that a pull - back density has an explicit expression for the likelihood function needed for statistical analysis .",
    "the density function does not need any special functions such as the modified bessel function , which usually appear in directional statistics .",
