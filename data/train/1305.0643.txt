    "by using dual - plane leakage radiation microscopy we have fully quantified the key parameters characterizing two important dielectric - loaded surface plasmon polariton routing devices : linear couplers and 90@xmath46 curved waveguides .",
    "we unambiguously demonstrated the added - value of performing momentum - space spectroscopy .",
    "the degeneracy lift for strongly coupled waveguides and the symmetry of the split modes can be directly visualized and quantified .",
    "the wave - vector distribution associated to the curved section of the waveguide was also readily observed .",
    "we developed a numerical and an analytical analyzis to understand the experimental momentum distribution .",
    "we found that for large radii ( vanishing bending loss ) , we can link the plasmon signature in fourier space with the geometrical and modal properties of the bend structure .",
    "the radial dependence of the wave - vector distribution is governed by the phase difference @xmath108 . for smaller radii of curvature",
    "the bend loss need to be accounted for by developing an approach including realistic field shape .",
