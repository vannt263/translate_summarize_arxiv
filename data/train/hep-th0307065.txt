    "the scalar dilaton field arised as companion of the metric tensor in ( super)string theories and is associated with the scale invariance of these theories @xcite .",
    "thus it is interesting to study classical field theory solutions coupled to a dilaton . in most studies ,",
    "the dilaton was assumed to be massless while , however , from the viewpoint of a realistic theory the dilaton should be massive in order to avoid long - range scalar forces . in @xcite",
    "a dilaton potenial of liouville type was introduced to take into account the effects of a specific symmetry - breaking mechanism which gives mass to the dilaton .",
    "this type of potential has a constant prefactor which in the limit of vanishing dilaton coupling reduces to a cosmological constant .",
    "it was found that there exist no asymptotically flat/ de sitter/ anti - de sitter solutions for non - vanishing potential @xcite .",
    "rotating generalisations of the black hole solutions found in @xcite have been constructed in @xcite .",
    "volkov argued recently @xcite that if @xmath0 is a symmetry of the einstein - yang - mills ( eym ) system in ( @xmath1 ) dimensions , where @xmath2 is the coordinate associated with the @xmath3th dimensions , than the ( @xmath1)-dimensional eym system reduces effectively to a ( @xmath4)-dimensional eymhd system with a specific coupling between the dilaton field and the higgs field .",
    "the generalisation of this ( @xmath4)- dimensional eymhd model was consequently studied in @xcite .    in this paper , we study spherically symmetric solutions of the ( @xmath4)-dimensional eymhd model deduced from the ( @xmath1)-dimensional eym system including a cosmological constant .",
    "the dimensional reduction then leads to a liouville - type potential in the @xmath5-dimensional model . in section 2 , we present both the five - dimensional model and the from this deduced and then generalised @xmath5-dimensional eymhd model . in section 3 , we discuss the solutions for the case of vanishing dilaton coupling , especially , we present our numerical results for the generic solutions in this case . in section 4 ,",
    "we discuss possible solutions for the generic case of non - vanishing dilaton coupling .",
    "our conclusions are presented in section 5 .",
    "we start with the einstein - yang - mills lagrangian in five dimensions including a cosmological constant given by :    @xmath6    with the su(2 ) yang - mills field strength @xmath7 , the gauge index @xmath8 and the space - time index @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath10 and @xmath11 denote respectively the 5-dimensional newton s constant and the coupling constant of the gauge field theory .",
    "@xmath10 is related to the 5-dimensional planck scale @xmath12 by @xmath13 .",
    "@xmath14 is the 5-dimensional cosmological constant .",
    "if both the matter functions and the metric functions are independent on @xmath2 , the @xmath3-dimensional fields can be parametrized as follows @xcite : @xmath15 and @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the @xmath18-dimensional metric tensor and @xmath19 plays the role of the dilaton .",
    "in @xcite it was shown that for @xmath20 the classical equations are equivalent to those of a four - dimensional einstein - yang - mills - higgs dilaton theory . in this paper",
    ", we consider the case with a cosmological constant .",
    "we then choose the generalised @xmath5-dimensional action to be : @xmath21 with the gravity lagrangian : @xmath22 and @xmath23 denoting the 4-dimensional newtons constant .",
    "the matter lagrangian @xmath24 reads : @xmath25 with the higgs potential @xmath26 the non - abelian field strength tensor @xmath27 and the covariant derivative of the higgs field in the adjoint representation @xmath28 the gauge field coupling constant is denoted @xmath29 , @xmath30 is the higgs field coupling constant and @xmath31 the vacuum expectation value of the higgs field .",
    "note that we have introduced a coupling @xmath32 specific to the dilaton field by setting @xmath33 .",
    "this will allow to study the influence of the dilaton systematically .",
    "we remark that the @xmath3-dimensional cosmological constant has through dimensional reduction led to a liouville potential in the dilaton field with coupling constant @xmath34 . for @xmath35 ,",
    "@xmath34 is proportional to the four - dimensional cosmological constant",
    ".      for the metric the spherically symmetric ansatz in schwarzschild - like coordinates reads @xcite : @xmath36 with @xmath37 in these coordinates , @xmath38 denotes the ( dimensionful ) mass of the field configuration . for the gauge and higgs fields",
    ", we use the purely magnetic hedgehog ansatz @xcite @xmath39 @xmath40 @xmath41 the dilaton is a scalar field depending only on @xmath42 @xmath43 inserting the ansatz into the lagrangian and varying with respect to the matter fields yields the euler - lagrange equations , while variation with respect to the metric yields the einstein equations .      with the introduction of dimensionless coordinates and fields @xmath44 the lagrangian and the resulting set of differential equations depend on the following coupling constants : @xmath45 where @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 . with the rescalings ( [ scale ] ) and ( [ coupling ] ) ,",
    "the dimensionless mass of the solution is given by @xmath49 .",
    "note that we have rescaled the cosmological constant in order to obtain the equations of a conventional ( 3 + 1)-dimensional einstein - yang - mills - higgs model including a cosmological constant in the limit of vanishing dilaton coupling .",
    "with ( [ scale ] ) and ( [ coupling ] ) the euler - lagrange equations read : @xmath50 @xmath51 @xmath52 \\ , \\label{dgl3 } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the prime denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath53 , while we use the following combination of the einstein equations @xmath54 @xmath55 to obtain two differential equations for the two metric functions : @xmath56 @xmath57 @xmath58    note that the equations of the original five dimensional theory are recovered by using the following specific choice of the coupling constants : @xmath59    the case @xmath60 was previously studied in @xcite .",
    "if in addition @xmath61 , the equations of the einstein - yang - mills - higgs equations are recovered @xcite .",
    "choosing @xmath62 ( assuming @xmath63 as well ) , the model reduces to the yang - mills - higgs - dilaton system studied in @xcite .",
    "we will first discuss the solutions in the case @xmath64 .",
    "the equation of the dilaton field can then be decoupled and @xmath65 . we will study solutions of this system which are regular at the origin this implies the following conditions @xmath66 finiteness of the adm mass requires that the fields approach particular values asymptotically , namely : @xmath67    for @xmath68 the metric function @xmath69 has a zero at a finite value of @xmath53 , say @xmath70 .",
    "this is the so - called `` cosmological horizon '' .",
    "the value @xmath71 depends on the actual values of the coupling constants .      setting @xmath64",
    "the system admits embedded abelian solutions , the so - called ( anti- ) de sitter - reissner - nordstrm solutions : @xmath72 the metric function @xmath69 has a physical singularity at the origin @xmath73 which is evident from the kretschmann scalar @xmath74 : @xmath75 depending on the choice of the sign of the cosmological constant , up to @xmath18 zeros of @xmath69 can exist .",
    "@xmath76 of the @xmath18 zeros correspond to horizons since the first zero has always negative value and thus has no physical meaning .",
    "the two inner horizons @xmath77 , @xmath78 with @xmath79 correspond to the well known cauchy , respectively event horizon of the reissner - nordstrm solution , while the third outer horizon @xmath80 exists only for positive cosmological constant .",
    "extremal black hole solutions - like in the asymptotically flat space - are possible",
    ". then , we have @xmath81 with @xmath82 .",
    "this leads to the equation : @xmath83 this is solved by : @xmath84 and @xmath85 for @xmath68 , the solution with the plus sign is the outer , cosmological horizon @xmath71 , while the inner , event horizon @xmath86 is the solution with the minus sign .",
    "obviously , the appearance of horizons in ds space is restricted by @xmath87 . the corresponding mass of the extremal solution is given by : @xmath88 apparently , the @xmath60 limit is ill - defined .",
    "however , for @xmath89 we find @xmath90 which for @xmath91 obviously leads to the corresponding values of the well - known asymptotically flat reissner - nordstrm solution .",
    "since gravitating monopoles in anti - de sitter space have been studied previously @xcite , we concentrate here on monopoles in de sitter space . to our knowledge , these type of solutions have not been studied previously .    in the absence of a cosmological constant ,",
    "the flat space magnetic monopole @xcite is deformed by gravity and exist up to a critical value of @xmath92 where the solution bifurcates with the branch of extremal reissner - nordstrm solutions @xcite .",
    "for instance in the bps limit ( @xmath93 ) the gravitating monopole bifurcates with this branch at @xmath94 .    now analysing the equations in the presence of a cosmological constant",
    ", we were able to construct ds - gravitating monopoles .",
    "they are characterised by a cosmological horizon at @xmath95 with @xmath96 .",
    "the behaviour of the function @xmath69 is illustrated in fig . 1 for @xmath97 and different values of @xmath98 .",
    "we find that @xmath71 is decreasing with the increase of @xmath98 : @xmath99 for @xmath100 and @xmath101 for @xmath102 .",
    "as is obvious from the figure , the solutions have a local minimum at some value of the radial coordinate @xmath103 .",
    "the main aim of this study was to determine the domain of coupling constants in which ds - gravitating monopoles exist .",
    "fixing @xmath104 and @xmath98 our analysis demonstrates that ds - gravitating monopoles bifurcate with the branch of extremal dsrn solutions described in the previous section at a critical value of @xmath105 .",
    "since we limited our analysis to small values of @xmath98 the critical value of @xmath105 where the bifurcation occurs hardly differs from the corresponding one in the asymptotically flat case .    the way how the extremal dsrn solution is approached is illustrated in fig . 2 for @xmath102 and @xmath106 .",
    "this clearly shows that the value of the local minimum of the function @xmath69 decreases while @xmath105 increases .",
    "we find that solutions exist up to a maximal value of the gravitational coupling @xmath107 .",
    "there another branch of non abelian solutions exist which bifurcates with the branch of dsrn solutions at a critical value of @xmath108 . at this point , a degenerate horizon forms at @xmath109 .",
    "the critical solution can be described by the ds - rn solution with horizons ( [ xhds ] ) for @xmath110 , while for @xmath111 , it is non - singular and non - trivial . compared to the case @xmath60 @xcite , the values of @xmath112 and @xmath113 are smaller when @xmath68 . moreover ,",
    "the interval of @xmath105 on which two solutions exist decreases .",
    "this can be related to the increased cosmological expansion for @xmath68 .",
    "in the case of einstein - maxwell - dilaton theory , the liouville potential leads to the fact that the solutions are neither asymptotically flat nor de sitter nor anti - de sitter @xcite .",
    "as far as our numerical simulations suggest , this holds also true for the case of non - abelian gauge fields , since we were not able to construct asymptotically flat/ de sitter/ anti- de sitter solutions .",
    "however , in a specific limit , namely the embedded abelian case , analytic solutions are available .      setting @xmath117 and @xmath118 for all @xmath53 , we find the following solutions of the system of equations : @xmath119 and @xmath120 the cosmological constant is given by : @xmath121 this solution has a single event horizon for @xmath122 .",
    "moreover , it can be seen , that this solution is ill - defined for @xmath123 .",
    "note that these are generalisations of the solutions constructed in @xcite . for @xmath124",
    ", the above solution corresponds to one of the solutions found in @xcite . in fig.3",
    ", we show qualitative profiles of the functions for the choice of parameters which corresponds to the @xmath3-dimensional limit ( [ 5dlimit ] ) .",
    "in addition , we choose @xmath125 .",
    "it is obvious from this figure that the solution has a horizon ( here at @xmath126 ) and thus represents a black hole .",
    "if we choose instead the limit @xmath127 , the function @xmath128 becomes constant @xmath129 .",
    "the metric function @xmath130 in this limit .",
    "in a previous paper @xcite , it was shown that a einstein - yang - mills model in @xmath3 dimensions can be reduced to an effective @xmath5-dimensional einstein - yang - mills - higgs - dilaton model under certain symmetry conditions -spherical symmetry and independence on the coordinate associated with the @xmath3th dimension .",
    "one of the main results of the present paper shows that the reduction of a @xmath3 dimensional de sitter ( ds)/anti- de sitter ( ads ) einstein - yang - mills system to an effective @xmath5-dimensional action ( with the same symmetry assumptions as in @xcite ) leads to a self - interaction of the dilaton field via a liouville potential .",
    "previous considerations of an einstein - maxwell - dilaton model including a liouville potential @xcite have revealed that no asymptotically flat/ de sitter/ anti- de sitter solutions can be constructed @xcite .",
    "all our attempts to construct numerically solutions of the non - abelian counterpart have failed .",
    "thus , we believe that the absence of asymptotically flat/ de sitter/ anti- de sitter solutions holds also true in the case of non - abelian gauge fields .",
    "however , considering the limit of vanishing dilaton coupling , we were able to recover the ads gravitating monopoles studied previously @xcite and to produce previously not studied solutions , namely the ds gravitating monopoles .",
    "we show for the latter solutions that they bifurcate with the branch of ds - reissner - nordstrm ( dsrn ) solutions at a critical value of the gravitational coupling .",
    "finally , considering the limit @xmath116 and @xmath115 for non - vanishing liouville potential , we were able to construct generalisations of the solutions found in @xcite .",
