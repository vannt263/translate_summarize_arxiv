    ", we devote the present paper to the evaluation of quantum effects on the filamentation instability in such setting .",
    "since the relativistic quantum magnetohydrodynamic equations are yet to be defined , the present analysis restricts to the non - relativistic regime . on the other hand",
    ", we do not make any approximation on the beam density so that present theory remains valid even when the beam density equals the plasma electronic one .",
    "the paper is structured as follow : we start explaining the formalism and derive the dispersion equation .",
    "we then turn to the investigation of the marginal stability and derive some exact relations satisfied in this case .",
    "we finally study the maximum growth rate and the most unstable wave vector before we reach our conclusions .",
    "let us then consider an infinite and homogenous cold non - relativistic electron beam of velocity @xmath0 and density @xmath1 entering a cold plasma along the guiding magnetic field @xmath2 . the plasma has the electronic density @xmath3 and ions",
    "form a fixed neutralizing background of density @xmath4 .",
    "the beam prompts a return current in the plasma with velocity @xmath5 such as @xmath6 .",
    "we use the fluid conservation equations for the beam ( @xmath7 ) and the plasma ( @xmath8 ) , @xmath9 and the force equation in the presence of the static magnetic field @xmath10 with a bohm potential term @xcite , @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the charge and mass of the electron , @xmath14 the density of species @xmath15 , @xmath16 its momentum , and @xmath17 equals @xmath10 plus the induced magnetic field .",

    "if the ground state which stability is investigated consisted of the plasma only , the beam representing the perturbation , then this parameter would have to remain much smaller than 1 within the framework of a linear response theory .",
    "in turns out that the dispersion equation which has just been derived is the dispersion equation of the beam+plasma system .",
    "the perturbed ground state is therefore the sum of the beam and the plasma .",
    "it is thus perfectly possible to investigate the linear response of the whole system even when @xmath43 so that we do need to make any assumption regarding this parameter .",
    "before we turn to the quantum case , let us quickly remind some basic features of the cold magnetized filamentation instabilities @xcite in the classical ( non - quantum ) regime . to this extent ,",
    "the dispersion equation , which is just the determinant of the tensor we just defined , is solved numerically and figure [ fig:1 ] displays the growth rates obtained with and without the magnetic field ( curves a and b ) .",
    "the stabilizing effect of the magnetic field is twofold . on one hand , the smallest unstable wave vector switches from @xmath44 to @xmath45 on the other hand , the growth rate saturation value @xmath46 for large",
    "@xmath47 is lower with @xmath48 which vanishes exactly for @xmath49 noteworthily , this value of the magnetic field also makes the quantity @xmath50 diverge .",
    "the physical interpretation of this threshold is simple as @xmath51 is just the maximum growth rate of the instability in the non - magnetized case @xcite .",
    "filamentation instability is thus inhibited when the electron response to the magnetic field is quicker .",
    "figure [ fig:1]c displays the growth rate in terms of @xmath47 accounting for quantum effects . as in the non - magnetized case @xcite , quantum effects introduce a cut - off at large @xmath47 so that we now have to characteristic wave vectors @xmath50 and @xmath52 determining the instability range . both of them can be investigated directly from the dispersion equation . since the growth rate vanishes for these wave vector while the root yielding the filamentation instability",

    "such a system can thus be viewed as basically magnetized with some weak quantum effects , and stabilization mainly comes from the magnetic field .    when @xmath114 ( strong quantum regime ) , stabilization is reached earlier with respect to @xmath72 ( see fig .",

    "we recognize the kind of curve obtained for a classical magnetized plasma @xmath120 with a `` cut - off '' magnetic parameter @xmath121 .",

    "the growth rate just saturates at large @xmath47 yielding a continuum of most unstable modes .",
    "but quantum effects stabilize the large @xmath47 modes , so that there is always one mode growing faster that the others .    for systems near marginal stability , the last unstable wave vector @xmath85 , given exactly by eq .",
    "( [ eq : zl ] ) , and in the weak and strong quantum limits by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : zlasympt],[eq : zl3 ] ) respectively , is by definition a very good approximation of this most unstable wave vector when replacing the marginal parameter @xmath91 by its actual value @xmath73 .",
    "indeed , we found numerically that expressions ( [ eq : zlasympt],[eq : zl3 ] ) are still quite accurate , even for systems far from stabilization .",

    "[ fig:2 ] : on one hand , the most unstable wave vector for a given configuration is necessarily between @xmath50 and @xmath52 . on the other hand , the last unstable wave vector belongs to the same interval because @xmath50 increases while @xmath52 decreases as the system moves towards stabilization .",

    "quantum effects have been assessed with respect to the filamentation instability in a magnetized plasma . as far as the unstable wave vector range is concerned",

    "we also found that the dimensionless parameter @xmath129 determines the strength of quantum effects . when @xmath113 , the instability can be described in classical terms , and eventually vanishes when increasing the magnetic field , while the unstable wave vector range shifts towards infinity . when quantum effects are strong , namely @xmath114 , the instability still vanishes with the magnetic field , but the unstable wave vector range tends to zero .",
    "furthermore , the magnetic field required to stabilize the system is divided by @xmath130 with respect to its classical value , so that filamentation can be suppressed by a much smaller magnetic field than in the non - quantum case .",
    "these results may have important consequences when dealing with dense space plasmas .",
    "finally , it will be necessary to assess both relativistic effects , which tend to enlarge the instability domain while reducing the maximum growth rate @xcite , and kinetic effects which usually have a stabilizing effect @xcite .",
    "to this extent , relativistic quantum kinetic theory will be required , or the relativistic form of the quantum euler equation ( [ eq : force ] ) will have to be elaborated . as long",
    "as the theory implemented is non - relativistic , the magnetic stabilization level unraveled here should remain an _ upper _ stabilization bounds when kinetic effects are accounted for . in the classical relativistic regime , it has been demonstrated that the stabilizing magnetic field behaves like @xmath131 @xcite , where @xmath132 is the relativistic factor of the beam . because this increase of the magnetic threshold eventually stems from the relativistic increase of the mass of the electrons",
    ", we can conjecture that the same factor @xmath131 will be found in the relativistic counterpart of eq .",
    "( [ eq : omegahightheta ] ) , but this shall need confirmation .",
