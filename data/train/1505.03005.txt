    "s : intro      ss : motiv    in this paper we prove an additivity property of the 3dimensional ( normalized ) seiberg  witten invariant with respect to an abelian cover , valid for surgery 3manifolds . namely , assume that @xmath0 is obtained as a negative rational surgery along connected sum of algebraic knots in the three - sphere @xmath1 .",
    "let @xmath2 be its universal abelian cover .",
    "theorem [ thm : main ] states that the sum over all spin@xmath3 structures of the seiberg  witten invariants of @xmath0 ( after normalisation ) equals to the canonical seiberg ",
    "witten invariant of @xmath2 .",
    "both covers of manifolds , and manifolds of form @xmath4 , are extensively studied in recent articles .",
    "the stability of certain properties and invariants with respect to the coverings is a key classical strategy in topology , it is even more motivated by the recent proof of thurston s virtually fibered conjecture @xcite .",
    "manifolds of form @xmath4 can be particularly interesting due to theorem of lickorish and wallace @xcite stating that every closed oriented three - manifold can be expressed as surgery on a _ link _ in @xmath1 .",
    "based on this result , one can ask which manifolds have surgery representations with some restrictions .",
    "for example , using heegaard  floer homology , @xcite provides necessary conditions on manifolds having surgery representation along a _",
    "knot_. in this context , theorem [ thm : main ] can be viewed also as a criterion for a manifold having surgery representation of form @xmath4 with @xmath5 a connected sum of algebraic knots .",
    "in fact , seiberg ",
    "witten invariants ( sw ) and heegaard  floer homologies are closely related .",
    "the sw invariants were originally introduced by witten in @xcite , but they also arise as euler characteristics of heegaard  floer homologies , cf . @xcite . in this article",
    "we will involve another cohomology theory with similar property . since @xmath4 is representable by a negative definite plumbing graph , via @xcite we view the sw invariants as euler characteristics of lattice cohomologies introduced in @xcite . the big advantage of the lattice cohomology over the classical definition of heegaard ",
    "floer homology is that it is computable algorithmically from the plumbing graph . in the last section of applications and examples the above ` covering additivity property ' will be combined with results involving lattice cohomology .",
    "another strong motivation to study the above property is provided by the theory of complex normal surface singularities : the geometric genus of the analytic germ is conjecturally connected with the sw invariant of the link of the germ . since the geometric genus satisfies the ` covering additivity property ' ( cf . ",
    "[ ss : sing ] ) , it is natural to ask for the validity of similar property at purely topological level .",
    "furthermore , from the point of view of singularity theory , the motivation for the surgery manifolds @xmath4 is also strong : the link of the so called _ superisolated singularities _",
    "( introduced in @xcite ) are of this form .",
