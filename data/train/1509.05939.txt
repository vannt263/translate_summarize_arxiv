    "`` complexity '' , once an ordinary noun describing objects with many interconnected parts , now designates a specific field with so many branches . in this paper",
    "a system is considered as complex when it shows _ emergence _ properties .",
    "emergence in this case refers to a situation where the aggregate of interactions exhibit properties not attained by summation ( the whole is more than the sum of its parts ) . from a design perspective",
    ", complex systems should be decomposed into weakly interacting subsystems to avoid such properties .",
    "the focus of this paper is on the complexity of scheduling in communication networks .",
    "the idea of layering for complexity decomposition has been applied previously to the communication network protocols [ 1 ] .",
    "although the layering techniques have provided a very efficient platform for communication networks , the arrival of cognition in modern radios has increased the complexity .",
    "these cognitive abilities shift the underlying models of communication system from complex physical systems to complex adaptive systems .",
    "this is because of the ability of cognitive nodes to interact with each other in a distributed way , where each node not only learns from the radio environment but also interacts with other nodes .",
    "the idea of decomposition is a good solution to the situations when there is some coupling or interaction between networking problems .",
    "the general idea of decomposition is to break the problem into smaller ones and solving each of the smaller ones in a distributive manner [ 2 ] . in this work",
    "a resource scheduling situation is described where distributed optimization is not efficient due to the emergence properties of the system . this is because the optimization of the whole system is more than the sum of its distributed optimization parts .",
    "the focus of this paper is on carrier sense multiple access ( csma ) scenarios .",
    "this is due to its connection to the markov chain system as the few mathematically describable models for the study of the complex systems .",
    "we show that if the scheduling parameters in the csma scheduling exceed a specific threshold , the local observations of the links may not be effective for a distributed learning mechanism .",
    "this is because the local observation of different links get tied up together in a level that the distant link parameters should be considered to achieve the required efficiency .",
    "the question we address here is how arrival rate , interference graph and the simple gradient methods for adjusting the transmission rates , affect the complexity of maximum throughput optimization ?",
    "we will answer this question by introducing a dependencies matrix into the maximal throughput optimization in the csma scheduling . beside studying the complexity of the csma ,",
    "a direct result of our work is to prove that when the minimum vertex cover of the interference graph is logarithmic in terms of the size of vertexes @xmath3 , the suitable strategy for solving the optimization problem is to transmit with probability 1 , i.e a service - rate agnostic approach .    *",
    "related works * it is known that the problem of maximum throughput in a csma scheduling is the problem of finding the maximum independent set of the wireless interference graph . using this intuition a glauber dynamic has been applied to the csma problem known as pgd - cmsa ( parallel glauber dynamic csma ) in [ 3 ] .",
    "we consider a non - parallel version of that work ( gd - csma ) for the ease of modelling .",
    "it is proved in [ 3 ] that there is no complexity emergence ( low mixing time in their context ) for complete graphs but we show this is also true for the graphs with the minimum vertex cover size of @xmath4 .",
    "our problem formulation can be bridged to the design problem of low delay maximal throughput csma scenarios [ 4 ] .",
    "then the results of our paper can be applied automatically to this sets of problems as well .",
    "our work differs from [ 4 ] in its optimization formulation .",
    "moreover the focus of this paper is to address the complexity decomposition of distributed learning rather than the low delay scheduling algorithms .",
    "the markov chain of our studied csma is also similar to [ 5 ] . using state decomposition",
    ", the authors of [ 5 ] provide a constraint on the size of the independent sets of the graph that can guarantee the fast mixing condition of markov chain . in our work",
    "the fast mixing condition is part of the throughput optimization problem , a formulation that has not been addressed to the best of our knowledge .    in order to prove theorem 5 , the gradient descent algorithm similar to",
