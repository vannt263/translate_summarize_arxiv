    "gravitational waves ( gws ) are , at the present time , the subject of an important research effort @xcite . in the field of cosmology",
    ", they may provide us with important information on the very early stages after the big - bang , information that might be unobtainable by other means @xcite .",
    "we also witness an increased interest in the application of the ideas of loop quantum gravity to the problems of cosmology , a field known as loop quantum cosmology ( lqc ) , after a series of seminal papers by martin bojowald @xcite . for a review on lqc , see for example @xcite . among the important results given by lqc",
    ", we have the possibility of removing in a natural way the initial singularity @xcite .",
    "lqc introduces , in the semi - classical period prior to the classical slow - roll inflation , important modifications in the dynamical equations driving the expansion of the universe , for example it induces a super - inflationary period @xcite , and such changes , in turn , give rise to an extra production of gws , even without the appropriate modifications into the gravitational equations , as has been shown in refs .",
    "the study of gws in lqc has been a very active field in the past few years @xcite including the analysis of the power spectrum of the tensor modes ( i ) with inverse - volume corrections refs .",
    "@xcite , ( ii ) with holonomy corrections refs .",
    "@xcite , and ( iii ) considering both these corrections simultaneously @xcite .",
    "more recently , the evolution equations for the tensorial perturbations including inverse - volume and holonomy corrections within a generalised anomaly - free formalism have been deduced in ref .",
    "the possible footprints of lqc on the b - modes polarization of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) has been tackled in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in the present paper , we analyse the spectrum of the gws as would be measured today .",
    "more precisely , we modify the equations for the gws , introducing inverse - volume corrections ( we leave to a future paper the holonomy corrections ) , and compare the results with those obtained in refs .",
    "@xcite , where these corrections were introduced only in the background dynamical equations driving the expansion of the universe . what we see is an important extra production of gws , leaving its imprint in the low - frequency limit of today s energy - spectrum , which , incidentally , also shows that inflation does not remove all the information coming from phenomena taking place in the pre - inflationary times .",
    "indeed , as we have shown recently , a bounce in modified theories of gravity @xcite as well as a topological defect phase prior to classical inflation @xcite leave some imprints on the low frequencies of the spectrum of the gws which are not washed out by the inflationary phase .",
    "what happens is that the physical features during the semi - classical period affect in different ways different frequencies , and the memory of these differences survives through the inflationary period , to be shown today in the power - spectrum . besides this extra production of gravitons ,",
    "when compared with classical models , after the usual initial decrease in the energy - spectrum of the very low frequencies , we have then a second maximum , brought about by lqc , which is not present when we discard the modifications , brought in by loop quantum cosmology , in the gw equations . in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] , we suggest an explanation for this interesting new feature .    in our model , inflation is driven by a chaotic type of potential , of the form @xmath0 although we believe that the main results will not be much modified by the use of a different potential .",
    "results from the planck satellite collaboration @xcite do not seem to particularly favour this potential , but also do not disfavour it completely . for this reason we keep it as a simple toy model , and also because most of the analyses presented were made in the context of classical inflation @xcite , which is not the context of the present paper .",
    "we organize the paper as follows . the lqc model used in our work",
    "is described in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] , where we summarise the equations of motion for both the semi - classical and the classical stages of the evolution of the universe , and where the values of the parameters and the intial conditions for the numerical integrations are specified , taking into account various cosmological observations like measurements of the cmb . in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] we review the evolution equations for the tensorial modes in lqc taken into account inverse - volume corrections .",
    "then , we calculate their energy - spectrum , as would be seen today , using the method of the continuous bogoliubov coefficients , first derived by leonard parker @xcite .",
    "we compare with previous results obtained by one of us in @xcite and comment on the differences obtained .",
    "[ sec4 ] summarizes the main results of the paper .",
    "to describe the early stages of the evolution of the universe , the equations of standard cosmology have to be modified by corrections due to the loop quantum effects , defining the semi - classical stage of the expansion @xcite .",
    "after a few planck times , we enter into the usual classical regime , with a period of inflation driven , in our paper , by a scalar field @xmath1 with a chaotic - type potential @xmath2 followed by a period of reheating and , finally , by radiation - dominated , matter - dominated and dark - energy - dominated periods .    as we said in the introduction , in the present paper",

    "we see that , while both spectra show a rise of the energy density of the gws with respect to general relativity , there are some important differences between them .    first , when the lqc corrections are introduced only at the background level , the imprints of those corrections appear only on the low - frequency end of the spectrum @xcite ; in the present case large oscillations appear on the spectrum up to frequencies of the order of @xmath131rad / s .",
    "this is due to the fact that , if the tensorial perturbations are treated like in standard general relativity , i.e. we set @xmath132 in eq .",

    "[ fig5 ] . for higher frequencies",
    "the spectrum becomes almost flat and horizontal .",
    "however , when we consider the inverse - volume corrections of lqc at the background and at the perturbative level , we observe a considerable growth of the energy density of the gws , up to three / four orders of magnitude with respect to the results with the loop corrections only at the background level .",
    "this effect does not appear to have a clear cut - off frequency , as it extends to frequencies of the order of @xmath136 rad / s .",
    "we can explain this effects in light of the modifications introduced in eq .   by the lqc corrections at the perturbative level .",

    "as it contains terms with the second derivative of @xmath141 , the function @xmath142 is singular at @xmath143 , which seems to induce a very intense production of gravitons during the intial super - inflationary phase .",
    "furthermore , the fact that the term in @xmath144 is no longer constant means that the higher modes are not `` blind '' to the effects of the lqc corrections at the perturbative level , in contrast with what happens when the loop corrections are considered only at the background level .",
    "furthermore , we observe the presence of a local broad maximum in the frequency range @xmath145 rad / s which is absent when the inverse - volume corrections are not included at the perturbative level . upon inspection we found that the position of the maximum on the spectrum is consistent with the frequency @xmath146 ,",
    "corresponding to the maximum value of the term @xmath147 , see eq .",
    ", during the initial super - inflationary phase .",
    "the value calculated for @xmath146 is @xmath148    another feature of the energy - spectrum of the gws is the initial slope which appears near the minimum frequency , @xmath149 rad / s , corresponding to the current horizon .",
    "this slope appears from the combination of ( i ) the loop corrections in the tensorial equations , and ( ii ) the production of gravitons during the matter - dominated phase .",
    "while the first increases the energy density of the gws by several orders of magnitude , as mentioned above , the second originates an additional raise of the energy density only on the very low frequencies range , on the left of the maximum that occurs at @xmath150 .    due to the large amount of time necessary to produce each point of the spectrum , above @xmath151 rad / s",
    ", we did not complete the spectrum beyond the frequency @xmath152 rad / s .",
    "this figure shows the relative logarithmic energy - spectrum of the cosmological gws as could be measured today , calculated with ( upper blue line ) and without ( lower red line ) the inverse - volume corrections of lqc in the evolution equations of the tensor perturbations .",

    "in this work we have investigated the energy - spectrum for the gravitational waves generated within a loop quantum cosmological model .",
    "the evolution of the universe , as here modelled , goes basically through two stages , first a semi - classical stage with super - inflation , whose equations receive important corrections coming from lqc , followed by a classical evolution described by the usual general relativistic equations . in the semi - classical stage ,",
    "the corrections we introduced were of the inverse - volume type , leaving to a future work the study of the influence of the holonomy corrections .",
    "these corrections , particularly to the inflation equation , push up the value of the scalar field , giving rise , in a natural way , to those values of the order of planck mass which are necessary to obtain enough inflation .    by numerically integrating the equations , introduced in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] and [ sec3 ] , we were able to calculate the relative logarithmic energy - spectrum @xmath153 for the gws , as would be seen today .",
    "in fact , we calculated two spectra , one with the inverse - volume corrections inserted in all the dynamical equations , including the gw equations , the other where those corrections were only included in the equations governing the expansion of the universe , but not in the equations for the gws , as was seen before in ref .",
    "the physical processes taking place before the standard slow - roll inflation leave their imprint on the spectrum in the region of very low frequencies .",
    "considerable differences were observed in the two situations , demonstrating the importance of the inverse - volume corrections , for the production of gravitons .",
    "first , we have an important extra production of gravitons , by at least three orders of magnitude and , second , we observe a local maximum around @xmath154 rad / s .",
    "this is consistent with a resonance at the frequency corresponding to the peak of the term @xmath147 in eq .  , which occurs at the end of the initial super - inflation epoch driven by loop effects , i.e. at @xmath143 .",
    "this maximum is absent when the lqc corrections are not included in the gw equations .",
    "finally , for frequencies above @xmath151rad / s , the spectrum , instead of becoming almost flat and horizontal , continues to show important oscillations in a large interval of frequencies , at least up to @xmath152 rad / s .",
    "we would like to highlight once more that our calculations involve only inverse volume corrections , at the background and perturbative levels .",
    "therefore , we have disregarded the holonomy corrections .",
    "the later are very important on lqc as they remove the big bang singularity through a bounce .",
    "if the bounce is located around @xmath155 , the regime @xmath156 is not reached , which is precisely where we have an overproduction of gravitons .",
    "therefore , it could be that the inclusion of the holonomy corrections remove or appease this overproduction .",
