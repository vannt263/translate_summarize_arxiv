    "the object is made of lines instead of single points or filled surfaces .",
    "lines are objects on which the field varies slowly in one direction ( the direction tangeant to the line ) and rapidly in the orthogonal one .",
    "therefore , one can expect that the effects of non - isoplanatism will be intermediate between the two previous cases .",
    "[ iso4 ] helps to understand how lines are imaged through a non - isolanatic optical system .",

    "the part of the line that is clipped corresponds to the orthogonal projection of the shadow of the lens on the straight line .",
    "this can be easily understood by analysing the propagation of the cylindrical waves emitted by straight lines through the spherical lens .",
    "the smaller square in pannel ( a ) is transmitted because its side is shorter than the diameter of the lens .",
    "the intermediate square is at the limit of the cut - off .",
    "as shown in the pannel ( b ) of fig .",
    "[ iso4 ] , circles are never clipped , whatever their radii , because the orthogonal projection of the lens disk on the cicle is the circle itself .",
    "in sec .  [ sec3 ] , we claimed that isoplanatic imaging is possible with a thin lens when the object lies on the spherical surface @xmath0 and the image is observed on the spherical surface @xmath1 .",
    "let s examine this statement more closely .    referring to fig .",
    "[ tl ] , simple gaussian optics arguments suggest that if the point @xmath6 is translated horizontally from the object plane @xmath2 to the surface @xmath0 , its image @xmath4 , instead of moving towards @xmath1 , should move away from the lens .",
    "this argument is correct , but it relies on the gaussian approximation that the point @xmath4 _ is _ initially in the `` image plane '' @xmath3 . in reality , because of the field curvature aberration due to the lens , the stigmatic image of @xmath6 is closer to the lens than the surface @xmath1 itself ( @xmath4 lies on the so - called petzval surface ) .",
    "bringing @xmath6 on @xmath0 will place its image @xmath4 exactly on @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "consequently , eq .  ( [ transphci ] ) is exact , while eq .",
    "( [ transphcni ] ) is only valid in the context of gaussian approximation .",
    "if the lens is still diffraction - limited in this regime ( no point - aberrations ) , the isoplanatic imaging geometry provides a nearly perfect transfer of the coherent field from the object to the image space .",
    "only the resolution is reduced because of the finite size of the lens .",
    "the problem that remains is how to transfer a given field from a plane surface to a curved one before imaging , and vice versa after imaging .",
    "generally , the object field is obtained by modulating a coherent illumination field @xmath159 by a complex amplitude function @xmath160 : @xmath161 the modulation @xmath160 can be produced by any plane modulation device like a plane transparency , a grating or some kind of adaptative optics . usually @xmath160 itself is considered as the `` object '' of interest . in that case , the illumination beam must be a plane wave propagating along the optical axis in order to map the profile @xmath160 to the beam : @xmath162 .",
    "if , instead , we illuminate the modulation device with a spherical wave @xmath163 focusing on @xmath164 ( see fig .",
    "[ tl ] ) , we get @xmath165 .",
    "this kind of illumination projects the object onto @xmath166 as required for isoplanatic imaging @xcite . starting with an illuminating plane wave travelling along the optical axis ,",
    "this can be achieved by placing an additional thin lens of focal length @xmath59 just before ( or just after ) the object plane @xmath2 .",
    "this lens must act as a pure phase - correction transparency .",
    "similarly , on the image side , a thin lens of focal length @xmath60 placed just after ( or before ) the image plane can be used to project the image from @xmath167 onto @xmath3 . from a broader point of view , any spherical field distribution in the object space of a centered paraxial optical system can be imaged onto a spherical surface of any curvature using only lenses ; some of them will be imaging lenses , while others will play the role of phase - correction transparencies .",
    "this is the basis of the so - called _ metaxial optics _ theory formulated by the bonnet @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that this approach only works for sufficiently slowly varying fields , because the diffraction from @xmath2 to @xmath0 ( and @xmath1 to @xmath3 ) has to be negligible for the amplitude of the fields on @xmath2 and @xmath0 ( @xmath1 and @xmath3 ) being the same .",
    "in addition , due to optical design constraints , the use of optical lenses as phase - correction transparencies is not always possible .",
    "moreover , lenses are never perfectly thin and diffraction through them may have worse effects on imaging than the phase curvature due to non - isoplanatism .",
    "whether or not non - isoplanatism should be corrected depends on the particular system under consideration .",
    "a clever design can minimize , if not cancel , its effects on the detected intensity .",
    "the theoretical discussion of secs .",
    "[ sec5 ] and [ sec4 ] relies on two strong approximations : the paraxial approximation and the thin lens approximation .",
    "one may wonder whether our analysis is robust enough to be applied to systems containing powerful lenses , which are usually thick and have a high numerical aperture .",

    "the resolution is set by the size of the micromirrors ( @xmath177  m@xmath117 ) .",
    "the object plane is 60  cm away from the lens .",

    "l@xmath171 is a diffraction - limited aspheric lens and l@xmath173 a long - focal achromatic doublet .",

    "we attribute this discrepancy to the fact that the experimental point - spread function is a bit broader than the theoretical airy pattern . as noted is sec .",

    "a broadening of the point - spread function reduces that sparseness and therefore restores the ring patterns characteristic of non - isoplanatic imaging .",
