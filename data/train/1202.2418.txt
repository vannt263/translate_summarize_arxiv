    "in the field of continuous - variable ( cv ) quantum information processing ( qip ) , non - gaussian states of light have attracted great interest recently as an essential requirement for universal qip , which is unattainable only with gaussian states and operations  @xcite . to generate a variety of non - classical non - gaussian states ,",
    "the photon - subtraction technique  @xcite has been playing a central role . with this technique ,",
    "more advanced and powerful cv protocols with non - gaussian states have been proposed and also experimentally demonstrated recently  @xcite .    in practice ,",
    "such cv protocols are less efficient in the lower frequencies around the laser carrier frequency due to various sources of noises , as well as higher frequencies due to the finite bandwidths associated with squeezing , and also the electronics used . to achieve the robust implementation of these protocols ,",
    "fragile non - gaussian states should be encoded properly within the highly - efficient frequencies . however , such encoding has been a challenging task in photon - subtraction , where the frequency mode of non - gaussian states is determined by a mode of squeezed light associated with probabilistic photon - detection .",
    "sideband - mode encoding ( fig .",
    "[ sfig : sideband_mode ] ) , often used for gaussian states , can also be achieved here with non - degenerate squeezed modes , but it requires high - speed electronics to observe the generated states  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , center - band encoding with a degenerate mode ( fig .",
    "[ sfig : degenerate_mode ] ) is subject to low - frequency noises , which need to be removed with electrical high - pass - filters ( hpf ) during homodyne - detection .",
    "these hpfs also filter out the low - frequency information of non - gaussian states , thereby causing an inevitable frequency mode mismatch which degrades the fragile non - gaussian states .    here",
    "we propose a mode - filtering strategy to achieve a more efficient encoding of non - gaussian states via photon - subtraction .",
    "our strategy is to filter out _ optically _ the problematic low - frequencies of the degenerate squeezed mode , instead of using its full spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ sfig : filtered_mode ] ) . by introducing an _ optical hpf _ with any desired cutoff in the photon - detection channel",
    ", we can tailor the frequency mode of the non - gaussian states without any direct loss on or manipulation of the state itself .",
    "it enables us to achieve almost perfect mode matching in the homodyne - detection , thereby making maximum use of the fragile non - gaussian states . in this paper",
    ", we develop a theoretical time - domain description of the mode - filtering process , and then experimentally demonstrate the successful mode - reshaping as predicted from the theory .",
    "the simple technique demonstrated here can be straightforwardly applied to various photon - subtraction protocols , including state - generation  @xcite and entanglement distillation  @xcite .",
    "+    our mode - filtering strategy is especially effective for a wide range of cv protocols based on quantum teleportation  @xcite , where the low frequencies are often contaminated by noisy measurements and feed forward operations  @xcite .",
    "we have used the quantum teleportation apparatus in ref .",
    "@xcite as a testing device to show the advantages of mode - filtering . with this device , we teleported non - classical non - gaussian states generated by mode - filtering , and then measured the degree of non - classicality preserved in the state .",
    "the wigner function of the teleported state has a minimum negativity of @xmath2 , compared to @xmath3 without mode - filtering , where the negativity here is an indication of the state s non - classicality ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "these results show a clear filtering - related enhancement of the quality , thereby demonstrating that our scheme is more effective for the robust implementation of various teleportation - based protocols with non - gaussian states .    this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : theory ] , we first review the basics of photon - subtraction and then introduce the idea and theory of mode - filtering . in sec .  [ sec : setup ] , we give details of our experimental setup . in sec .",
    "[ sec : photon - subtraction ] , the experimental results of photon - subtraction with mode - filtering are presented and compared with the theory . in sec .",
    "[ sec : teleportation ] , we show the results of quantum teleportation and demonstrate the advantages of mode - filtering .",
    "finally sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] concludes this paper .",
    "photon - subtraction is a method to conditionally generate non - gaussian states by the assistance of a single photon detection  @xcite . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : photon - subtraction ] , a small fraction @xmath5 of a squeezed vacuum generated by a weakly - pumped opo is reflected via a tapping beam splitter ( tbs ) towards an avalanche photo - diode ( apd ) .",
    "this beam is used as a trigger beam , whereas the transmitted beam is called the signal beam .",
    "conditioned on an apd click , one photon is subtracted from its corresponding quantum mode on the signal beam , and the resulting photon - subtracted state shows non - classical features in its non - gaussian wigner function with a negative dip .",
    "since this scheme relies on the quantum correlation between the signal and trigger modes , as well as the projective measurement of the trigger mode , the frequency mode of the non - gaussian states is strongly correlated with the frequency mode of the photons detected by the apd .",
    "the degenerate opo produces correlated photon pairs within a lorentzian spectrum with bandwidth @xmath6 in the weak pumping limit .",
    "any photon within this spectrum can be reflected by the tbs , trigger the apd click , and thereby herald a conditional photon in the signal mode .",
    "thus , the correlation over the full spectrum is used to induce non - gaussian states . as is proven in ref .",
    "@xcite , the non - gaussian states have the same frequency spectrum as that of the opo , and their temporal mode function is given by the fourier transform of the lorentzian spectrum as @xmath7 ( normalized as @xmath8 ) . in the time domain",
    ", this mode is a short wave packet of light , whose information can be extracted by multiplying @xmath9 with the homodyne measurement signal .        in this scheme , the frequency mode of the non - gaussian state is totally determined by the lorentzian spectrum of the opo . from an engineering point of view , however , this frequency mode can be contaminated by low - frequency laser noise and also electric noise around the carrier frequency @xmath10 ( more details of the noise contamination are mentioned in sec .  [",
    "sec : setup ] ) .",
    "these types of noise are critical , and strongly deteriorate the fragile non - classicality of the non - gaussian states . in order to avoid the noise contamination",
    ", we introduce a reflecting cavity before the apd .",
    "the cavity has bandwidth @xmath11 which transmits photons in the low - frequencies and reflects the rest of the components towards the apd .",
    "the input - output relation of this cavity can be given in the frequency domain by  @xcite @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are annihilation operators of the input and reflected modes , and @xmath15 is an auxiliary vacuum mode which does not affect the apd detection .",
    "the response function @xmath16 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : cavity_relation ] ) shows that the reflecting cavity acts like an _ optical hpf _ , which removes low frequency photons before photon - detection .",
    "as a result , quantum correlations in the low frequencies are unaffected by the projective measurement , and thus the non - gaussian state is generated within a mode without low frequency components .",
    "note that the optical hpf is introduced not in the signal mode to directly remove the low - frequency components of the state , but in the trigger mode to prevent the low - frequency quantum correlations from being used for inducing non - gaussian states .",
    "the generation rate of the non - gaussian state is reduced as a result , but it does not directly affect the target quantum state itself : as we show below , the ideal heralded state is still the same non - gaussian state .",
    "therefore , this scheme makes it possible to reshape the frequency mode of the generated state without any direct loss on or manipulation of the state within the mode .",
    "the mode - filtering scheme can be modeled in time - domain descriptions with an annihilation operator @xmath17 . to begin with , a squeezed state generated from the opo",
    "can be written in the time domain as @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the photon pair creation operator  @xcite .",
    "@xmath20 denotes the two - time correlation function , which satisfies @xmath21 and therefore depends only on the time difference @xmath22 because the output field of the opo is stationary .",
    "@xmath20 can be shown to be @xmath23 , where @xmath24 represents the pumping power of the opo  @xcite .",
    "we start with the simplest case of a weak pumping limit of @xmath25 .",
    "the higher order terms of @xmath26 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : squeezedstate ] ) can be neglected to order @xmath23 .",
    "the squeezed state thus can be written approximately as @xmath27 , and @xmath28 is the only term relevant to the photon detection . by the beam splitter transformation of the tbs @xmath29 , @xmath28 transforms into @xmath30\\ket{0}_{\\text{s}}\\ket{0}_{\\text{t } } , \\label{eq : tapping}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the subscripts `` s '' and `` t '' denote the signal and trigger modes , respectively .",
    "assuming @xmath31 , we can neglect the case when more than two photons are reflected towards photon - detection .",
    "thus , the only term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : tapping ] ) relevant to the photon - detection has the form @xmath32 assuming an infinite bandwidth of the apd , we can model an apd detection at a time @xmath33 as a projection onto @xmath34 .",
    "this projective measurement of eq .",
    "( [ eq : correlated_photons ] ) gives @xmath35 .",
    "the operator @xmath36 can be regarded as a creation operator of a single photon , whose temporal mode is defined by a mode function @xmath37 . in a sense , the beam splitter transformation and the projective measurement",
    "subtract one photon from @xmath28 by replacing the @xmath38 operator with the corresponding single photon creation operator .",
    "thus , we can use @xmath39 to observe the induced single photon state in the weak pumping regime of the conventional photon - subtraction .    when the optical hpf of eq .",
    "( [ eq : cavity_relation ] ) is applied to the trigger mode before photon - detection , the effect can be described in the schrdinger picture as the replacement of @xmath40 , where @xmath41 . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : correlated_photons ] ) , this effect appears as a convolution of @xmath20 with @xmath42 as @xmath43 here the projection onto @xmath34 results in @xmath44 in this case , the mode function can be defined as @xmath45 .",
    "thus , the effect of the optical hpf can be included as a convolution of @xmath46 with the original mode function @xmath39 .",
    "a similar analysis can be applied to the higher order terms ( @xmath47 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : squeezedstate ] ) .",
    "first , a simple inductive proof shows the following statement ( a ) ; `` for any order @xmath48 , @xmath49 can be decomposed into the terms written only with @xmath48 or less @xmath50 operators with various correlation functions , including the vacuum term @xmath51 . ''",
    "this statement ( a ) holds for @xmath52 explicitly .",
    "suppose that the statement ( a ) holds for @xmath53 , and therefore @xmath54 can be decomposed into the sum of the terms in the form @xmath51 or @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) , where @xmath57 ( @xmath58 ) is the correlation function of each operator . in this case ,",
    "all of the terms resulting from the @xmath59th order term @xmath60 can be obtained by applying @xmath61 to each @xmath62th order term as @xmath63 or @xmath64 .",
    "the latter term can be decomposed with the commutation relation @xmath65=\\delta(t - t^\\prime)$ ] and @xmath66=[\\hat{a}^\\dagger(t),\\hat{a}^\\dagger(t^\\prime)]=0 $ ] as @xmath67 where @xmath68 and @xmath69 . here , the second term in the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : decomposition ] ) vanishes when @xmath70 .",
    "these decompositions show that all of the @xmath59th order terms can also be decomposed into the form @xmath71 ( @xmath72 ) , and thus the statement ( a ) holds for @xmath73 as well .",
    "the above discussions prove that the statement ( a ) holds for any order @xmath48 .",
    "then , in a similar way , the transformation of the tbs and the projection onto @xmath74 subtract one photon from one of the correlated photon pairs in each term @xmath55 . as a result ,",
    "various photon - subtracted terms are produced by the replacement of one of these @xmath50 operators with its corresponding single photon creation operator .",
    "the replacement of @xmath75 ( @xmath58 ) gives @xmath76 here , the projective measurement induces a single photon defined by the mode function @xmath77 . by selecting the @xmath78 mode",
    ", we can observe the pure single photon induced by the apd detection , as well as some fraction of the photon pairs generated in the opo . when applying the optical hpf",
    ", we need to replace @xmath79 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : higher_order_projected ] ) with @xmath80 .",
    "the effect of mode - filtering here can also be included as a convolution of @xmath78 with @xmath46 , as shown previously .",
    "note that different terms resulting from the projection can have single photons with different mode functions ( when @xmath81 , @xmath82 in general ) , thereby making it impossible to extract all the induced single photons purely at the same time .",
    "however , the mode - filtering effect on all the mode functions @xmath83 can be written in the same way as the convolution with @xmath46 . therefore ,",
    "when we introduce the optical hpf to the photon - subtraction scheme , we only need to replace the originally - used mode function @xmath39 with @xmath84 , regardless of the pumping power @xmath24 .",
    "our experiment is performed in the weak pumping regime , thus we can assume that the original mode function is @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath85 can be derived from the fourier transform of @xmath41 as @xmath86 thus , by convoluting @xmath9 with @xmath46 , and then setting the normalization constant properly , we obtain the optically - high - pass - filtered mode function as @xmath87 the temporal shapes of eq .",
    "( [ eq : mode_function ] ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mode_function ] .",
    "contrary to the original non - negative mode function , this function has a negative dip due to its lack of low frequency components .     on cutoff @xmath11 .",
    "we set @xmath88mhz . ]",
    "our experimental setup consists of three parts ; the first part is for photon - subtraction , the second part for quantum teleportation , and the third part for evaluating the quality of the teleported states ( fig .",
    "[ fig : experimental_setup ] ) .",
    "apart from the optical hpf part , the setup is mostly identical to that in ref .",
    "@xcite , where more details are provided .",
    "the output of a single - mode continuous - wave ti : sapphire laser ( solstis - srx , m squared lasers ) around 860 nm is used as the light source , a part of which is frequency - doubled for pumping three optical parametric oscillators ( opo ) . first , in the photon - subtraction part , a weakly squeezed vacuum is generated from opo1 ( half width at half maximum : 6.2 mhz ) with a 15 mw pump .",
    "the output of opo1 is directed into a tbs which reflects 3% of the beam toward an apd as the trigger beam , while the other beam is sent to the teleportation setup as the signal beam . in the trigger channel ,",
    "photons in all of the modes except for the degenerate squeezed mode are blocked with two fabry - perot filtering cavities with much wider hwhm ( 55 and 18 mhz ) than that of opo1 . then the trigger beam is injected into an optical hpf , which is a fabry - perot cavity with a round - trip length of 280 mm ( hwhm : 500 khz , finesse : 1080 ) . here",
    "the theoretical cutoff @xmath11 is set to @xmath89 mhz . by increasing @xmath11",
    ", we can reduce the low - frequency noise contamination .",
    "however , this decreases the event - to - dark - count ratio on the apd , which degrades the purity of the generated states .",
    "therefore the choice of @xmath11 is a compromise between these two effects .",
    "the reflection of the optical hpf is mode - reshaped and sent to the apd , while the transmission is monitored on a photodiode for locking the cavity .",
    "ideally , the cavity perfectly blocks the @xmath10 component when locked on resonance , but in our setup 14% of the reflected component remains due to a slight mismatch between the transmittances of two cavity mirrors ( impedance mismatch ) .",
    "this effect can be taken into account by a more detailed model of the mode function , which is described in the appendix .",
    "conditioned on an apd click , a photon - subtracted squeezed vacuum is generated in the signal beam and used as an input state for the subsequent quantum teleportation circuit .        for realizing quantum teleportation of this state , first alice and bob need to share a pair of broadband epr - correlated beams as a resource .",
    "this pair can be obtained by mixing two strongly squeezed vacua from opo2 and opo3 ( hwhm : 12 mhz ) on a half beam splitter .",
    "alice combines the input state with one of the epr pairs on a half beam splitter , then measures the @xmath90 and @xmath91 quadratures of the resulting two outputs .",
    "the measurement results are sent to bob as gain - tuned electric signals , which bob uses to modulate displacement beams ( shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : experimental_setup ] ) and to correct the other beam of the epr pair . as a result",
    ", the input state is reconstructed . in order to faithfully teleport the quantum state within the original wave packet quantum mode ,",
    "all these operations are performed over a frequency spectrum broader than this wave packet spectrum .    in order to evaluate the quality of the teleported quantum states , the output beam is measured by a balanced homodyne detector .",
    "the local oscillator phase in this detector is scanned for the full angular resolved tomography of the state , and 100,000 quadrature data are recorded over @xmath92 $ ] .",
    "we use the inverse radon transform based on polynomial series expansion  @xcite to reconstruct the wigner functions @xmath93 .    in this teleportation circuit , and in other teleportation - based circuits as well , low - frequencies can be contaminated by mainly two sources of noise .",
    "the first source is the laser noise around the carrier frequency .",
    "the non - gaussian states can be deteriorated by this noise derived from the local oscillator beams in imperfectly - balanced homodyne detections for alice and the final evaluation , as well as the displacement beams directly mixed by bob .",
    "the second source is the low - frequency electric noise , which contaminates alice s homodyne signal for the displacement operation and the final homodyne signal for the evaluation .",
    "these types of noise often need to be removed with electrical hpfs . in our setup",
    ", a hpf with a cutoff frequency of 101 khz is required in the final homodyne signal .",
    "non - gaussian states generated _ without _ mode - filtering have low - frequency components , which are inevitably removed by this hpf .",
    "the resulting frequency mode mismatch in the homodyne - detection directly deteriorates the non - gaussian states , thereby limiting the quality of the teleportation .",
    "in contrast , non - gaussian states generated _ with _ mode - filtering do not have frequency components lower than 101 khz , thus we can avoid the low - frequency noise contamination , as well as achieve almost perfect mode matching in the final homodyne - detection .",
    "first the states generated by photon - subtraction are analyzed to demonstrate the mode - filtering effect by the optical hpf .",
    "we record 200,000 frames of quadrature data both in the conventional and mode - filtering photon - subtraction .",
    "when using the conventional method , we unlock the optical hpf and monitor the signal of the transmitted beam to keep it totally off resonant during the measurement time .",
    "experimental wigner functions @xmath93 in these two methods are shown in fig .",

    "we applied the mode function including the effect of the impedance mismatch of the optical hpf ( eq .  ( [ eq : mode_function_mismatch ] ) in the appendix ) . each wigner function",
    "is reconstructed by optimizing the parameters @xmath6 and @xmath11 of the mode function to extract the minimum @xmath94 ( @xmath11 is set to 0 for the conventional method ) .",
    "the optimal parameters of @xmath95 mhz and @xmath96 mhz match well the experimentally estimated values of @xmath97 mhz ( opo1 bandwidth ) and @xmath98 mhz ( optical hpf bandwidth ) .",
    "both wigner functions have minimum negativities of @xmath99 ( conventional ) and @xmath100 ( mode - filtering ) without any corrections , thereby excluding any description as a classical probability density .",
    "the experimental wigner functions sometimes have minimum values not exactly at the origin , but at a slightly shifted point around the origin possibly due to the interference of the trigger photons with the other unwanted fake trigger photons . here",
    ", we adopt the minimum negativity around the origin as @xmath94 .",
    "this non - classical negative region is fragile and easily disappears with every percent of experimental loss and other imperfections .",
    "thus , the quality of these non - gaussian states can be evaluated by their negativity .    in fig .",
    "[ sfig : input_negativity ] , we plot the dependence of the minimum value @xmath94 on the cutoff @xmath11 of applied mode functions ( @xmath6 is fixed at @xmath95 mhz ) . without the optical hpf , the theoretical mode function @xmath7 corresponds to the case of @xmath101 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mode_function_mismatch ] ) . therefore @xmath94 increases with increasing @xmath11 as a result of the mode mismatch between the photon - subtracted temporal mode and the applied mode function . with the optical hpf",
    ", the plot shows the different @xmath11 dependence which has an optimal @xmath11 .",
    "these experimental data are in good agreement with the theoretical curves calculated from a simple and realistic model  @xcite , thereby showing the experimental success of the mode - filtering ( fig .",
    "[ sfig : input_negativity ] ) . in the theoretical model ,",
    "the generated state is modeled by @xmath102 , where @xmath103 is the annihilation operator describing photon subtraction and @xmath104 is the squeezing operator with a squeezing parameter @xmath105 .",

    "if perfect impedance matching is obtained , the enhancement can be even greater .    in summary",
