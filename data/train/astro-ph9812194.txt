    "figure [ totsed ] displays a family of total disk seds labeled by @xmath5 .",
    "the behavior of the sed for @xmath78 is similar to that described in  [ intsed ] , since the interior dominates emission at those wavelengths .",
    "shortward of @xmath0@xmath79 , emission from the superheated surface makes a qualitative difference to the appearance of the seds .",
    "one difference is that for angles @xmath80 , the flux is remarkably insensitive to viewing geometry . , both because surface layers intermediate in radius are seen through the outer disk s atmosphere and because emission from the optically thick interior is proportional to the projected area . ]",
    "this is because shorter wavelength radiation emerges primarily from the superheated surface layers , which are optically thin along most lines of sight .    for angles",
    "@xmath81 , the intervening outer disk dramatically extinguishes surface radiation at the shortest wavelengths .",
    "however , the total disk sed between 30 and 80@xmath1 is relatively robust to changes in inclination ; it decreases by less than a factor of 3 between face - on and edge - on orientations .",
    "radiation at these wavelengths originates from surface layers at large radii and is only slightly obscured by the tenuous interior at still larger radii .",
    "finally , in figure [ starsed ] , we add the contribution from the central star to the sed .",
    "the stellar flux fades rapidly with increasing @xmath5 beyond @xmath0@xmath82 .",
    "when viewed nearly face - on , passive disks exhibit emission lines associated with dust grain resonances .",
    "these features arise from material along the line - of - sight which is optically thin : line - to - continuum flux ratios are of the same order as the percentage enhancement in line opacity",
    ". emission lines may originate from both the optically thin superheated surface ( as discussed in cg ) and the optically thin interior .",
    "how do such lines vary as the disk is viewed increasingly edge - on ?",
    "might they appear in absorption instead , as cohen & witteborn ( 1985 ) find for 7 of the 32 t tauri stars they survey spectrophotometrically ? to address these questions , we add 6 gaussian - shaped spectral resonances to our grain emissivity law . in choosing resonant wavelengths and strengths , we aim to illustrate the range of effects which occur with variable viewing angle .",
    "roughly , our 6 lines can be associated with crystalline h@xmath83o ice at 60 and 100@xmath1 ( waters & waelkens 1998 ) , amorphous silicates at 10 and 20@xmath1 ( mathis 1990 ) , and small carbon - rich grains or pahs ( polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ) at 3.3 and 6.2@xmath1 ( waelkens et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "solid - state line spectra at various disk inclinations are displayed in figure [ specline ] .",
    "emission at all wavelengths varies little with viewing geometry for angles @xmath48 .",
    "this is true particularly at the shortest wavelengths where lines arise largely from the optically thin surface layers . at wavelengths progressively longer than @xmath030@xmath1 , the optically thin interior at large radius contributes increasingly to line emission .",
    "the drop in the long wavelength continuum with increasing inclination reflects the @xmath84 dependence of radiation emitted by the optically thick interior .",
    "emission lines at @xmath060 and @xmath85 persist at angles @xmath49 ,",
    "although their fluxes are lower by a factor @xmath02 for edge - on as compared to face - on disks . for edge - on orientations , only about half of the optically thin interior remains visible .",
    "emission around @xmath86 is more robust to changes in inclination ; most of this radiation emerges from the superheated surface at large radii and passes through the rarefied disk interior at yet larger radii with little attenuation .    at the shortest wavelengths , where occultation of the inner disk is significant ,",
    "lines indeed appear in absorption , though only over a limited range of inclinations between @xmath87 and 90@xmath3 . for a dust grain resonance to appear in absorption , disk inclinations must be sufficiently high that line emission from the superheated surface is extinguished",
    ". however , @xmath5 can not be so high that line and continuum optical depths both exceed unity at large radius where the disk interior is nearly isothermal . only over an intermediate range of inclinations",
    "does radiation on and off the resonant wavelength probe a variety of interior disk temperatures . for the @xmath88 resonance to appear in absorption , @xmath89 . at @xmath90 , opacities are lower , and inclinations needed for absorption higher : @xmath91 . in principle , near - infrared line spectra may provide a sensitive diagnostic of disk inclination .    while the trends outlined above apply qualitatively to all passive disks , quantitative conclusions are model - dependent .",
    "for example , in our standard model , no absorption line at @xmath92 appears because line - of - sight optical depths are too small to extinguish emission from the superthermal surface .",
    "however , such an absorption line would appear in the sed of a sufficiently massive , inclined disk .",
    "gm aur is a particularly clean , well - studied t tauri system to which we can apply our sed models .",
    "the single central star has mass @xmath93 , luminosity @xmath94 , and age @xmath95 ( beckwith et al .",
    "aperture synthesis maps in @xmath96 evince a rotating circumstellar gas disk having approximate projected dimensions 950 @xmath97 @xmath98 @xmath99 , inclined at @xmath100 ( koerner , sargent , & beckwith 1993 ) .",
    "hubble space telescope ( hst ) images in scattered visible light reveal the disk surface to be flared , and suggest @xmath31 is closer to @xmath0@xmath4 ( koerner 1997 ; stapelfeldt et al .",
    "these same observations detect no outflow or remnant envelope surrounding this relatively evolved system .",
    "cg model the sed of gm aur , but with a face - on disk .",
    "they suggest that a non - zero disk inclination might cause line - of - sight radiation from the inner disk to be absorbed by the outer disk , thereby explaining the relatively low @xmath101 flux without invoking a central hole . here",
    "we investigate this possibility by refitting the sed with an inclined disk .",
    "figure [ gmsed ] displays our new fit with a disk inclined at @xmath102 . despite the non - zero inclination ,",
    "none of our fit parameters changes significantly from those given by cg for the face - on case .",
    "fluxes at iras ( infrared astronomical satellite ) wavelengths emerge mainly from the optically thin surface layers , and those at mm wavelengths emerge mostly from the optically thin interior ; neither is sensitive to viewing angles @xmath5 near or less than @xmath87",
    ". for this disk equals @xmath103 . ]",
    "our model reproduces the observed modest extinction to the central star of @xmath104 magnitudes , but at the cost of still requiring a large central gap having a radius @xmath0@xmath105 times greater than the dust sublimation radius : @xmath106 , where the uncertainty reflects that of the @xmath101 iras point .",
    "there is no inclination for which the outer edge of our model disk attenuates the @xmath101 flux without also extinguishing central starlight by several magnitudes .",
    "line - of - sight column densities to surface regions inside @xmath05 au ( where most of the @xmath101 emission originates ) are only @xmath0@xmath107 greater than the column density to the star .",
    "this small difference in the amount of obscuring material is completely insignificant ; the opacity at @xmath101 is @xmath108 times lower than at visible wavelengths .",
    "thus , the low visual extinction to the central star implies that we should have a clear view of disk regions inside a few au at near - infrared wavelengths .    in spite of these considerations ,",
    "we remain skeptical of the existence of such a large central gap devoid of dust .",
    "a more palatable alternative might be that the inner disk s aspect ratio does not increase monotonically with radius .",
    "such undulations in the height of the surface would shadow annular regions from the central star and lower their temperatures .",
    "in addition , those ripples nearest the observer would hide their warmer , starlit sides when viewed at non - zero inclination .",
    "accretional heating may be responsible for such changes in surface geometry , as mentioned in cg ( see their  3.5 ) ; as estimated there , enhancements in disk thickness due to heating of the midplane may become significant inside a few @xmath99 . for an accretion disk which derives its luminosity solely from local viscous dissipation , the aspect ratio indeed decreases with radius whenever opacities increase steeply with temperature , as demonstrated by bell et al .",
    "( 1997 ) .",
    "might some class i spectra represent t tauri stars obscured by inclined disks ?",
    "the possibility should be entertained for sources such as 04108 + 2803b ; figure [ class1sed ] demonstrates that a passive disk inclined at @xmath109 provides a reasonable fit ( to within factors of 2 ) to this class i sed .",
    "fit parameters are similar to those of our standard model , and are listed in the figure caption . for this particular model ,",
    "near - ir emission at j , h , and k is interpreted as central starlight extincted by the disk s outer edge ; inclusion of starlight scattered off the disk surface would imply a larger inclination . to highlight the contribution from the superheated surface",
    ", we also plot the sed with the surface emission removed .",
    "fluxes between 3 and 60@xmath1 arise primarily from the superthermal surface , seen both through and over the lip of the outer disk atmosphere ( refer to figure [ incschem ] ) .",
    "clearly , a class i sed does not imply a unique distribution of circumstellar material .",
    "high angular resolution images provide additional clues .",
    "many class i sources exhibit near - ir nebulosity on scales ranging from 1500 to 3000 au ( kenyon et al .",
    "1993 ; and references therein ) ; for these sources , an additional , non - disk component of dust is needed .",
    "kenyon , calvet , & hartmann ( 1993 ) model class i seds using rotationally flattened , infalling envelopes that are passively heated by central stars .",
    "these envelopes extend out to larger radii than do our disks , typically 3000 au , but contain roughly the same amount of mass , about 0.1@xmath2 .",
    "bipolar holes empty of material , presumably evacuated by outflows , are invoked so that central starlight may scatter off cavity walls towards earth , thereby explaining the observed near - ir fluxes . in imaging observations of three class i sources using hst / nicmos ( near infrared camera and multi - object spectrometer ) ,",
    "padgett et al . ( 1998 ) discover nearly edge - on , flared circumstellar disks having diameters 300750 au .",
    "near - ir emission is observed to be scattered not only off upper and lower disk surfaces , but also off `` dusty material within or on the walls of outflow cavities . ''    in general , a combination of an inclined , passively heated disk , and a dusty bipolar outflow or partially evacuated envelope may best describe class i sources . since 04108",
    "+ 2803b reveals no optical or near - ir emission beyond @xmath0140 au from its central star ( kenyon , calvet , & hartmann 1993 ) , it is consistent with being a limiting example of a simple inclined disk .",
    "two other examples for which this limiting case scenario may also apply include the embedded sources 04295 + 2251 and 04489 + 3042 .",
    "both sources exhibit nearly flat excesses between @xmath03 and 100 @xmath1 which may arise from flared circumstellar disks .",
    "neither source betrays extended near - ir emission on scales greater than a few hundred au , or high - velocity molecular gas from an outflow ( kenyon et al .",
    "1993 ) .",
    "near - ir polarimetry also addresses the possible presence of envelopes .",
    "whitney , kenyon , & gmez ( 1997 ) determine that linear polarizations greater than @xmath020% at j , h , and k characterize the largest reflection nebulae associated with class i sources .",
    "such large polarizations are interpreted as arising from the scattering of central starlight off cavity walls in envelopes .",
    "in contrast , 04108 + 2803b evinces fractional polarizations of 5.1% and 1.6% at h and k , respectively ( whitney , kenyon , & gmez 1997)levels more comparable to those in class ii sources than in truly younger , more embedded protostars , and which may arise from starlight scattered off the disk surface .",
    "resolved polarimetry maps of 04108 + 2803b can test our hypothesis .",
    "degeneracies inherent in models deduced from a sed may also be broken by kinematic studies .",
    "interferometric radial velocity maps in molecular lines may distinguish between an infalling envelope ( e.g. , hayashi , ohashi , & miyama 1993 ; ohashi et al .",
    "1997 ) , and a rotating disk ( e.g. , koerner & sargent 1995 ) .",
    "finally , we note that the inverse problem to 04108 + 2803b is presented by the star hk tau b : a system observed to possess an edge - on ( @xmath110 ) circumstellar disk and no observable envelope , but whose infrared sed is not well measured because of confusion from an infrared - bright companion ( stapelfeldt et al .",
    "1998 ; koresko 1998 ) .",
