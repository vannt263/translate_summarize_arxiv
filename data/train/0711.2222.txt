    "long gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are linked with the death of massive stars ( for a review , see * ? ? ?",
    "their association with supernovae ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the fact that these events are at cosmological distance @xcite make them interesting for studies of cosmology in the redshift range 1 - 15 .",
    "however , while the grb features a prompt emission , usually seen in gamma - ray only , and an afterglow seen at all wavelengths , only the former emission has been considered for cosmological studies yet .",
    "one of the first attempt to do so , based on the @xmath2 correlation found by @xcite , was done by @xcite , who constrained the @xmath3 parameters . while not very constraining , their findings were compatible with previous tests made with supernova samples .",
    "the use of grb for cosmological studies , specially at high redshift where their detection at optical / ir wavelength is difficult , needs to build a robust indicator of their distance , whenever possible based on their intrinsic properties .",
    "the afterglow emission is less studied from a cosmological point of view because of its diversity . however , there were hints of standardization of the x - ray afterglows .",
    "the first attempt was done by @xcite , who found evidences for clustering in the x - ray light curves of bepposax afterglows .",
    "this clustering was confirmed later by @xcite who extended the sample to the xmm - newton and chandra data . in the following",
    "we will refer to these articles respectively as paper i and ii .",
    "in addition , @xcite showed that supernova and grb light curves had similar behaviors and were converging with time toward a similar luminosity .",
    "in paper i we tried also to check if optical light curves were also clustered : this attempt failed due to the poor knowledge of the intrinsic absorption in the burst host galaxy at that time .",
    "this study was completed by @xcite and @xcite who found independently that optical afterglows were also clustered in luminosity .    the high detection rate and throughput of swift , which provide a large sample of x - ray observations and rapid , accurate localization , enabling a redshift estimation by optical / ir telescopes , allowed us to increase dramatically our sample .",
    "with this larger sample , we have tried to derive a method for estimating the burst redshift from the x - ray light curve @xcite . however , before to apply this method it is necessary to understand the nature of these two groups , and to determine a consistent way to derive to which group belongs each burst .",
    "this is the purpose of this article . in section [ sec_ana ]",
    "we present our sample and the data analysis we performed .",
    "we discuss the x - ray clustering in section [ sec_result ] .",
    "we compare the x - ray and optical clusterings in section [ sec_discu ] . in section [ sec_redshift ]",
    "we present our method of grb source redshift estimation from the x - ray afterglow light curve .",
    "we finally test this method on several grbs detected recently by swift , and we propose an estimation of the redshift for two previously detected grbs of unknown distance .",
    "our sample of grbs with known redshift and x - ray afterglow observations is listed in table [ table1 ] .",
    "it includes all afterglows observed by bepposax , xmm - newton and chandra , which data were retrieved from @xcite and @xcite . as for swift observations , we browsed the swift archive web page and selected all bursts detected prior to the 1st of august 2006 with a measured redshift and a @xmath4 larger than 2.0 seconds ( in order to exclude short bursts ) . from this sample of swift bursts , we further excluded due to data processing errors .",
    "we removed the flaring parts of the light curve when applicable ( this totally removed from the sample the data of , which is thus not listed in table [ table1 ] ) .",
    "we corrected the flux light curves for distance effects as in paper i and ii : we apply a k - correction using the measured spectral index of each afterglow , assuming a flat universe with @xmath5 , and correcting for the time dilation effect by computing the luminosity at a time @xmath6 using the observed flux at time @xmath7 .",
    "this is very important for the correction accuracy , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec_discu ] .",
    "we restricted the light curves to the 2.0@xmath810.0 kev x - ray band , where the absorption is negligible .",
    "this allowed us to neglect any other corrections for absorption by the ism .",
    "we do not take into account any beaming effect due to a possible jet structure .",
    "as we done previously , instead of using a luminosity light curve , we express all light curves in flux units at a given distance ( like the optical absolute magnitude ) .",
    "this allows to reduce the uncertainties on the correction . for consistency with paper i and ii , we fix the redshift to @xmath9 .",

    "swift has shown that the x - ray light curve is typically composed by a first steep power - law segment , associated with the tail of prompt emission , followed by a flat plateau , a second steepening ( which is the segment usually seen before swift ) , and a possible late steepening related to the jet aperture @xcite . @xcite",

    "this effect can be partly explained by a selection effect , as low luminosity events can not be detected at high distance . the lack of dim distant events ( located in the upper left corner of fig .",

    "x - ray light curves are not taken continuously . before swift , x - ray observations were usually performed as snapshots of 30 - 60 ksec long @xcite . because of the time dilation , the start and end of each observation were located at different times , and the estimation of a parameter at a given time needs extrapolation or interpolation from the value observed at another time .",
    "however , the decay index can largely vary during the observations as shown by @xcite ; this uncertainty can affect the accuracy of the distribution parameter estimations .",
    "this effect can be illustrated by looking at fig .",
    "6 of @xcite , which is equivalent to fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] of the present work : the results are clearly different ; we observe a strong clustering , while @xcite see only a trend .",
    "however @xcite extrapolate the burst afterglow light curves , when no data is available at times earlier than 12h in the source rest frame : as an example is observed from 1.00 day to 1.34 days ( source rest frame ) , is observed from 0.69 to 4.36 days ( idem ) .",
    "the net effect of doing extrapolations instead of interpolations is to broaden the distribution , blurring in turn the clustering reported here . to avoid this effect , we decided , as in paper i and ii , to avoid extrapolations and to perform only flux interpolations , when relevant , using the nearest measurements .",
    "this is of course at the expense of the sample size , as one can note in figs .",

    "we also note that @xcite have found that a wind medium can also accurately describe the surrounding environment of and ( two _ group i - oi _ bursts ) .",
    "thus , the surrounding medium type can not explain the origin of the observed clustering .    in x - ray ,",
    "the flux is mostly dependent on @xmath230 and @xmath220 ( see eqn .",
    "[ eq_ism_x2 ] and [ eq_wind_x2 ] ) .",
    "if one assumes that @xmath201 is a good estimator of @xmath220 , then since the observed distributions of @xmath201 are similar for the two groups ( see fig .",
    "[ eiso ] ) , different values of @xmath220 can not explain the differences .",
    "in turn this implies that @xmath230 varies within the two groups ( see table [ table_equation ] ) .",
    "this however again can not explain the origin of _ group ii - oi _ : if the clustering is due only to a difference in the @xmath230 values , then we can not expect from eqn .",
    "[ eq_ism_opt2 ] and [ eq_ism_x2 ] , and [ eq_wind_opt2 ] and [ eq_wind_x2 ] , that a dim x - ray afterglow can be bright in optical .",
    "the constraints listed in table [ table_equation ] indicate that the difference between groups _",
    "i - oi _ and _ ii - oii _ on one hand , and group _ ii - oi _ on the other hand can be also due to a different value of @xmath233 .",
    "we thus propose that the presence of different groups is ascribed to different families of @xmath230 and @xmath233 values :    * a family of magnetized fireball that produces the group _ ii - oi_. in such a case the fireball transfers only a low fraction of its energy into relativistic electrons . *",
    "a family of less magnetized fireball that produces the groups _ i - oi _ and _ ii - oii_. the fraction of total energy going into magnetic fields is roughly one order of magnitude lower than group _ ii - oi_. these two groups can be related to an high and low fraction of energy going in relativistic electrons , respectively .",
    "interestingly , the group _ ii - oii _ is not very numerous ( compared to the other two groups ) , so that most of grbs of our sample are then either magnetized but not electron - energized or not magnetized but electron - energized.",
    "the clustering observed in x - ray can be used for distance estimation . to date , most of the redshift measurements made on grb afterglows were done by optical spectroscopic or photometric observations .",
    "however , because of the lymann alpha cut - off , this method can not be applied to high redshift events ( @xmath254 ) , unless doing ir spectroscopy . moreover ,",
    "not all grbs can be followed in optical ( e.g. the so - called dark - bursts , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , either because they are too faint at the time of the observation ( or even dark ) , or because there is no large enough telescope available , or because of the position of the event respective to the sun .",
    "hence many grbs have no known distance , stressing the need for intrinsic distance indicators . after the launch of the swift satellite ,",
    "thanks to its fast re - pointing capabilities , nearly all grbs have an homogeneous x - ray follow - up . hence , a redshift measurement method based solely on x - ray observations could be very interesting if one wants to use a large sample of grb sources for cosmological studies .",
    "we propose here to use the reported clustering of grbs x - ray light curves in three classes to build a redshift estimator .",
    "the method is based on the redshift needed for a burst to belong to one ( or both ) of the two groups .",
    "the steps are easy to follow : we compute from the x - ray observations ( i.e. obtained from swift ) the flux at 1 day ( observer frame ) in the 2 - 10 kev band , either using a mean spectral index of @xmath255 , or the exact one obtained from x - ray spectral fitting .",
    "we note that even if the spectral index is not known , this has little influence on the actual flux at one day ( within reasonable limits ) .",
    "table [ table_estimate ] , which provides the redshift needed to comply with the relation for both groups for a given observed flux , is directly usable to estimate the redshift .",
    "comparison of the estimated redshift versus the measured one for the bursts defining our sample .",
    "the solid line corresponds to equality .,width=302 ]    we calibrated this method by deriving the estimated redshift for the bursts of our sample ( for which the group is known ) , and comparing this value with the measured redshift .",
    "the results are displayed in fig .",
    "[ test_z ] .",
    "the estimated redshift agrees with the measured one for most of the bursts .",
    "the only discrepancies arises at low redshift . in sect .",
    "[ sec_discu ] we already noted that _ group iii _",
    "bursts are located at small distances ( z@xmath2560.5 ) and do not follow the same relation as groups i and ii : as a conservative approach we prefer to restrict the validity of our method to source located at redshifts larger than 0.5 .",
    "we list in table [ table_estimate ] the observed flux one day after the burst ( observer frame ) and the associated redshift needed for a burst to comply with the observed clustering for group i and ii sources . because of the limitation to redshifts larger than 0.5 , all bursts brighter than @xmath257 erg s@xmath195 @xmath196 belong to _ group i_. however , the belonging group is not correlated with easily observable quantities ( absorption , peak energy , isotropic energy , spectral or decay indexes ) , so it can be fixed only through broad - band modeling . in fact this leads to two redshift estimates .",
    "if the bursts has an optical afterglow there is a possible way to decide which of the estimate is valid : a burst with flux of @xmath257 erg s@xmath195 @xmath196 which belongs to _ group i _ has a redshift of @xmath258 . at that distance , the lymann @xmath259 cut - off appears to be at 360 nm , in the uvot observation bands .",
    "hence , if a grb afterglow is observed by uvot ( or in the b band for ground based telescopes ) then it can not belong to group i , and the ambiguity on the redshift determination is cleared .",
