    "while our current knowledge on the partonic substructures of nucleons and nuclei is obtained mostly from deep - inelastic scattering experiments , the dimuon production experiments also play an important and unique role in providing complementary information . during the last two decades , a series of fixed - target dimuon production experiments ( e772 , e789 , e866 ) have been carried out using 800 gev / c proton beam at fermilab . at 800 gev / c ,",
    "the dimuon data contain drell - yan continuum up to dimuon mass of @xmath0 gev as well as quarkonium productions ( j/@xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 resonances ) . the drell - yan process and quarkonium productions often provide complementary information , since drell - yan is an electromagnetic process via quark - antiquark annihilation while the quarkonium production is a strong interaction process dominated by gluon - gluon fusion at this beam energy .",
    "the fermilab dimuon experiments covers a broad range of physics topics .",
    "the drell - yan data have provided informations on the antiquark distributions in the nucleons  @xcite and nuclei  @xcite .",
    "these results showed the surprising results that the antiquark distributions in the nuclei are not enhanced  @xcite , contrary to the predictions of models which explain the emc effect in term of nuclear enhancement of exchanged mesons .",
    "moreover , the drell - yan cross section ratios @xmath4 clearly establish the flavor asymmetry of the @xmath5 and @xmath6 distributions in the proton , and they map out the @xmath7-dependence of this asymmetry  @xcite",
    ". pronounced nuclear dependences of quarkonium productions have been observed for j/@xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 resonances  @xcite . it was found that these nuclear effects scale with the kinematic variable @xmath8 rather than @xmath9 ( the bjorken-@xmath7 of the parton in the nulceus ) , suggesting the importance of initial- and final - state interactions . a striking behavior of the nuclear dependence as a function of @xmath10 , reminiscent of the cronin effect , was also observed .",
    "the nuclear drell - yan cross sections also exhibit @xmath8 as well as @xmath10 dependences  @xcite , which are weaker than the quarkonium nuclear dependences but can provide information on the energy loss of quarks traversing the nucleus  @xcite .",
    "the differential cross sections for drell - yan  @xcite , charmonium  @xcite , and bottomonium  @xcite productions have also been reported .",
    "in addition , the decay angular distributions for drell - yan  @xcite , j/@xmath1  @xcite , and @xmath3 resonances  @xcite have been measured .",
    "information on @xmath11 and @xmath12 meson productions and decays has also been extracted through either the dimuon measurement  @xcite or the open - aperture dihadron measurement  @xcite .",
    "several review articles covering some of these results are available  @xcite . in this article",
    ", we will focus on the recent results from experiment e866 and future prospect of dimuon experiments at fermilab and j - parc .",
    "despite the success of perturbative qcd in describing the drell - yan cross sections , it remains a challenge to understand the angular distributions of the drell - yan process .",
    "assuming dominance of the single - photon process , a general expression for the drell - yan angular distribution is  @xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 denote the polar and azimuthal angle , respectively , of the @xmath16 in the dilepton rest frame . in the  naive \" drell - yan model , where the transverse momentum of the quark is ignored and no gluon emission is considered , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are obtained .",
    "qcd effects  @xcite and non - zero intrinsic transverse momentum of the quarks  @xcite can both lead to @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "however , @xmath21 and @xmath22 should still satisfy the relation @xmath23",
    "this so - called lam - tung relation , obtained as a consequence of the spin-1/2 nature of the quarks , is analogous to the callan - gross relation  @xcite in deep - inelastic scattering .",
    "the first measurement of the drell - yan angular distribution was performed by the na10 collaboration for @xmath24 with the highest statistics at 194 gev / c  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath25 angular dependences showed a sizable @xmath22 , increasing with dimuon transverse momentum ( @xmath10 ) and reaching a value of @xmath26 at @xmath27 gev / c .",
    "the fermilab e615 collaboration subsequently performed a measurement of @xmath24 drell - yan production at 252 gev / c with broad coverage in the decay angle @xmath14  @xcite .",
    "the e615 data showed that the lam - tung relation , @xmath28 , is clearly violated .",
    "the na10 and e615 results on the drell - yan angular distributions strongly suggest that new effects beyond conventional perturbative qcd are present .",
    "brandenburg , nachtmann and mirke suggested that a factorization - breaking qcd vacuum may lead to a correlation between the transverse spin of the antiquark in the pion and that of the quark in the nucleon  @xcite .",
    "this would result in a non - zero @xmath29 angular dependence consistent with the data .",
    "several authors have also considered higher - twist effects from quark - antiquark binding in pions  @xcite .",
    "however , the model is strictly applicable only in the @xmath30 region , while the na10 and e615 data exhibit nonperturbative effects over a much broader kinematic region .     and @xmath31 vs.  @xmath10 in the collins - soper frame .",
    "solid circles are for e866 @xmath32 at 800 gev / c , crosses are for na10 @xmath24 at 194 gev / c , and diamonds are e615 @xmath24 at 252 gev / c .",
    "the error bars include the statistical uncertainties only . ]",
    "more recently , boer pointed out  @xcite that the @xmath25 angular dependences observed in na10 and e615 could be due to the @xmath33-dependent parton distribution function @xmath34 .",
    "this so - called boer - mulders function  @xcite is an example of a novel type of @xmath33-dependent parton distribution function , and it characterizes the correlation of a quark s transverse spin and its transverse momentum , @xmath33 , in an unpolarized nucleon .    to shed additional light on the origins of the na10 and e615 drell - yan angular distributions ,",
    "we have analyzed @xmath35 and @xmath32 drell - yan angular distribution data at 800 gev / c from fermilab e866 .",
    "there has been no report on the azimuthal angular distributions for proton - induced drell - yan  all measurements so far have been for polar angular distributions  @xcite .",
    "moreover , proton - induced drell - yan data provide a test of theoretical models .",
    "for example , the @xmath29 dependence is expected to be much reduced in proton - induced drell - yan if the underlying mechanism involves the boer - mulders functions .",
    "this is due to the expectation that the boer - mulders functions are small for the sea - quarks .",
    "however , if the qcd vacuum effect  @xcite is the origin of the @xmath25 angular dependence , then the azimuthal behavior of proton - induced drell - yan should be similar to that of pion - induced drell - yan .",
    "finally , the validity of the lam - tung relation has never been tested for proton - induced drell - yan , and the present study provides a first test .",
    "the fermilab e866 experiment was performed using the upgraded meson - east magnetic pair spectrometer . details of the experimental setup have been described elsewhere  @xcite . an 800 gev / c primary proton beam with up to @xmath36 protons per 20-second beam spill was incident upon 50.8 cm long cylindrical stainless steel target flask containing liquid deuterium .",
    "the detector system consisted of four tracking stations and a momentum analyzing magnet . from the momenta of the @xmath37 and @xmath38 , kinematic variables of the dimuons ( @xmath39 ) were readily reconstructed . the muon angles @xmath14 and @xmath15 in the collins - soper frame  @xcite were also calculated . to remove the quarkonium background , only events with @xmath40 gev / c@xmath41 or @xmath42 gev / c@xmath41 were analyzed . a total of @xmath4354,000 @xmath35 and @xmath43118,000 @xmath32 drell - yan events covering the decay angular range @xmath44 and @xmath45 remain .     vs.  @xmath10 in the collins - soper frame for several drell - yan measurements .",
    "fits to the data using eq . 3 and @xmath46 gev / c@xmath41 are also shown . ]",
    "figure 1 shows the results  @xcite on the angular distribution parameters @xmath47 and @xmath22 vs.  @xmath10 . to extract these parameters ,",
    "the drell - yan data were grouped into 5 bins in @xmath48 and 8 bins in @xmath15 for each @xmath10 bin .",
    "a least - squares fit to the data using eq .",
    "1 to describe the angular distribution was performed .",
    "only statistical errors are shown in fig .",
    "1 . for comparison with the @xmath32 drell - yan data ,",
    "the na10 @xmath24 data at 194 gev / c and the e615 @xmath24 data at 252 gev / c are also shown in fig . 1 . to test the validity of the lam - tung relation ,",
    "also shown in fig .",
    "1 is the quantity , @xmath31 , for all three experiments . for @xmath32 at 800 gev / c , fig .",
    "1 shows that @xmath21 is consistent with 1 , in agreement with previous studies  @xcite , while @xmath49 and @xmath22 deviate only slightly from zero .",
    "this is in contrast to the pion - induced drell - yan results , in which much larger values of @xmath22 are found .",
    "it is also interesting to note that while e615 clearly establishes the violation of the lam - tung relation , the na10 and the @xmath32 data are largely consistent with the lam - tung relation .",
    "the @xmath32 results put constraints on theoretical models that predict large @xmath25 dependence originating from qcd vacuum effects .",
    "they also suggest that the boer - mulders function @xmath34 for sea quarks is significantly smaller than for valence quarks .",
    "a recent analysis  @xcite of the @xmath32 @xmath25 data showed that the sea - quark boer - mulders functions are indeed smaller by a factor @xmath50 than the valence - quark boer - mulders functions .",
    "this analysis also indicated that the e866 @xmath32 data are consistent with the @xmath51 and @xmath52 boer - mulders functions having the same signs .",
    "however , the @xmath32 data alone can not provide an unambiguous determination of the flavor dependence of the boer - mulders functions .",
    "a comparison of the @xmath35 and @xmath32 data would further constrain the flavor dependence of the boer - mulders functions .",
    "figure 2 shows the preliminary result of @xmath22 for @xmath35 reaction at 800 gev / c .",
    "also shown in fig .",
    "2 are the e866 @xmath32 and the na10 @xmath53 data at 194 gev / c .",
    "the data are fitted with the expression suggested by boer  @xcite : @xmath54 where @xmath55 is proportional to the product of the @xmath34 functions for the projectile and the target , and @xmath56 is a constant fitting parameter .",
    "boer obtained @xmath57 and @xmath58 gev / c@xmath41 for fitting the na10 data , as shown in fig .",
    "2 . a fit to the e866 @xmath35 and @xmath32 data for @xmath59 gev/@xmath60 yields @xmath61 and @xmath62 , respectively .",
    "these data should provide additional information on the origins of the azimuthal angular dependence of drell - yan , as well as the flavor dependence of the boer - mulders functions .      in the cern na51  @xcite and fermilab e866  @xcite experiments on proton - induced dimuon production , a striking difference was observed for the drell - yan cross sections between @xmath35 and @xmath32 .",
    "as the underlying mechanism for the drell - yan process involves quark - antiquark annihilation , this difference has been attributed to the asymmetry between the up and down sea quark distributions in the proton . from the @xmath63 ratios",
    "the bjorken-@xmath7 dependence of the sea - quark @xmath64 flavor asymmetry has been extracted  @xcite .",
    "cross section ratios for @xmath3 resonances as a function of @xmath9 .",
    "the corresponding ratios for drell - yan cross sections are also shown .",
    "the error bars are statistical only . ]",
    "the fermilab e866 dimuon experiment also recorded a large number of @xmath65 events .",
    "unlike the electromagnetic drell - yan process , quarkonium production is a strong interaction dominated by the subprocess of gluon - gluon fusion at this beam energy  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the quarkonium production cross sections are primarily sensitive to the gluon distributions in the colliding hadrons .",
    "the @xmath3 production ratio , @xmath66 , is expected to probe the gluon content in the neutron relative to that in the proton  @xcite .",
    "while it is generally assumed that the gluon distributions in the proton and neutron are identical , this assumption is not based on any fundamental symmetry and has not been tested experimentally .",
    "a possible mechanism for generating different gluon distributions in the proton and neutron , as pointed out by piller and thomas  @xcite , is the violation of charge symmetry in the quark and antiquark distributions in the nucleons .",
    "a precise measurement of the @xmath67 ratios would provide a constraint on the asymmetry of gluon distribution in the proton versus that in the neutron .",
    "the @xmath68 ratios for @xmath69 production are shown in fig .   3 as a function of @xmath9 .",
    "most of the systematic errors cancel for these ratios , with a remaining @xmath70 1% error from the rate dependence and target compositions  @xcite .",
    "figure 3 shows that these ratios are consistent with unity , in striking contrast to the corresponding values  @xcite for the drell - yan process , also shown in fig .",
    "the difference between the drell - yan and the @xmath3 cross section ratios clearly reflect the different underlying mechanisms in these two processes .",
    "the drell - yan process , dominated by the @xmath71 annihilation subprocess , leads to the relation @xmath72 , where @xmath73 refers to the @xmath74 distribution in the proton and neutron , respectively . for @xmath3 production",
    ", the dominance of the gluon - gluon fusion subprocess at this beam energy implies that @xmath75 .",
    "figure 3 shows that the gluon distributions in the proton ( @xmath76 ) and neutron ( @xmath77 ) are very similar over the @xmath9 range @xmath78 . the overall @xmath79 ratio , integrated over the measured kinematic range , is @xmath80 .",
    "the @xmath3 data indicate that the gluon distributions in the proton and neutron are very similar .",
    "these results are consistent with no charge symmetry breaking effect in the gluon distributions .",
    "future fixed - target dimuon experiments have been proposed at the 120 gev fermilab main injector ( fmi ) and the 50 gev j - parc facilities .",
    "the fermilab proposal  @xcite , e906 , has been approved and is expected to start data - taking around 2011 . two dimuon proposals ( p04  @xcite and p24  @xcite ) have also been submitted to the j - parc for approval .",
    "the lower beam energies at fmi and j - parc present opportunities for extending the @xmath81 and the nuclear antiquark distribution measurements to larger @xmath7 ( @xmath82 ) . for given values of @xmath83 and @xmath9 ,",
    "the drell - yan cross section is proportional to @xmath84 , hence a gain of @xmath85 times in the drell - yan cross sections can be obtained at the j - parc energy of 50 gev . since the perturbative process gives a symmetric @xmath86 while non - perturbative processes are necessary to generate an asymmetric @xmath86 sea , it would be very important to extend the drell - yan measurements to kinematic regimes beyond the current limits .",
    "another advantage of lower beam energies is that a much more sensitive study of the partonic energy loss in nuclei could be carried out using the drell - yan nuclear dependence  @xcite .    the dimuon physics program at j - parc is proposed to be carried out in several stages . since 30 gev proton beam will be available at the initial phase of j - parc , the first measurements will focus on @xmath87 production at 30 gev .",
    "this will be followed by measurements of drell - yan and quarkonium production at 50 gev after the beam energy is upgraded to 50 gev .",
    "experiments using polarized target could already be performed with unpolarized beams .",
    "when polarized proton beam becomes available at j - parc , a rich and unique program on spin physics could also be pursued at j - parc using the dimuon spectrometer .",
    "an important feature of @xmath87 production using 30 or 50 gev proton beam is the dominance of the quark - antiquark annihilation subprocess .",
    "this is in striking contrast to @xmath87 production at 800 gev ( fermilan e866 ) or at 120 gev ( fermilab e906 ) , where the gluon - gluon fusion is the dominant process .",
    "this suggests an exciting opportunity to use @xmath87 production at j - parc as an alternative method to probe antiquark distribution .    with the possibility to accelerate polarized proton beams at j - parc , the spin structure of the proton",
    "can also be investigated with the proposed dimuon experiments .",
    "in particular , polarzied drell - yan process with polarized beam and/or polarized target at j - parc would allow a unique program on spin physics complementary to polarized dis experiments and the rhic - spin program .",
    "specific physics topics include the measurements of t - odd boer - mulders distribution function in unpolarized drell - yan , the extraction of t - odd sivers distribution functions in singly transversely polarized drell - yan , the helicity distribution of antiqaurks in doubly longitudinally polarized drell - yan , and the transversity distribution in doubly transversely polarized drell - yan .",
    "it is worth noting that polarized drell - yan is one of the major physics program at the gsi polarized antiproton experiment ( pax ) .",
    "the rhic - spin program will likely provide the first results on polarized drell - yan .",
    "however , the high luminosity and the broad kinematic coverage for the large-@xmath7 region at j - parc would allow some unique measurements to be performed in the j - parc dimuon experiments .",
