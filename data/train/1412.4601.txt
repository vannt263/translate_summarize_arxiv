    "<S> clearly , phase separation and the occurrence of interfaces breaks the translational invariance in @xmath11-direction so that averaged quantities can only depend on @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> the condition of hydrostatic equilibrium @xmath40 then implies that the total pressure @xmath41 is a diagonal tensor and , moreover , that the normal pressure @xmath42 is constant throughout the box to ensure mechanical stability . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the tangential pressure @xmath43 can , and does , vary spatially with @xmath11 .    </S>",
    "<S> we first consider the pressure tensor @xmath44 due to particle interactions , where @xmath45 is the connecting vector of particles @xmath46 and @xmath47 , and @xmath48 is the pair force along this vector due to the repulsive potential . the brackets @xmath49 denote the average over particle pairs for which at least one particle is within the slice at @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> the factor @xmath50 has to be included to compensate for the fact that every bond crossing between slices is counted twice . </S>",
    "<S> note that there are alternative spatial discretization schemes , all of which lead to the same integrated pressure  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the two diagonal components @xmath51 and @xmath52 are plotted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : press](a ) . </S>",

    "<S> i.e. _ , the interaction pressure is low in the dilute phase and high in the dense phase . </S>",
    "<S> clearly , there is something missing since such an inhomogeneous pressure is mechanically unstable and violates the condition of hydrostatic equilibrium .    : ( a )  the diagonal components @xmath51 ( @xmath53 ) and @xmath52 ( @xmath54 ) of the interaction pressure ( which lie on top of each other ) and the tangential active pressure @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) . </S>",
    "<S> note the increase of the active pressure in the interface before it drops in the dense phase ( arrows ) . </S>",
    "<S> ( b )  the total tangential pressure @xmath57 . </S>",
    "<S> the dashed line is the estimate for the bulk pressure @xmath58 , the error bars show the root - mean - square errors of local horizontal fits . ]    </S>",
    "<S> only very recently , the idea that due to their directed motion the particles exert a mechanical stress has been formalized by brady and coworkers  @xcite . following their approach , the scalar _ active pressure _ can be calculated via @xmath59 where @xmath60 is indeed the absolute position . </S>",
    "<S> the active pressure thus stems from the correlations between particle positions and orientations . assuming a gas of non - interacting swimmers with @xmath61 </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain  @xcite @xmath62 using the correlation function @xmath63 .    </S>",
    "<S> to consider the spatial dependence of the active pressure  , we introduce the generalized tensor @xmath64 in analogy to eq .  . </S>",
    "<S> the average is now taken over the subset of particles that at time @xmath65 occupy slice @xmath11 . however , there is a subtlety here since this destroys the correlations between the @xmath11-coordinate and the orientations , which , as eq </S>",
    "<S> .   demonstrates , depend not only on the configuration but on the previous history . </S>",
    "<S> hence , only the component @xmath66 is actually meaningful , which is plotted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : press](a ) . </S>",
    "<S> it again qualitatively follows the density but is now inverted with respect to the interaction pressure : the active pressure is high in the dilute region and drops considerably in the dense region . </S>",
    "<S> the physical reason is that particle motion is hindered in the dense phase and orientation and actual displacement are thus less correlated .    </S>",
    "<S> two conceptual insights into the nature of active suspensions are gained by plotting the total tangential pressure @xmath67 ( there is also the ideal gas contribution @xmath68 , which , however , is small ) . as demonstrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : press](b ) , the bulk pressures of dense and dilute phase are equal , which in turn implies @xmath69 . to corroborate that normal and tangential bulk pressure coincide , we have studied walls allowing to directly measure @xmath70 as the mechanical pressure exerted onto the walls  [ sm ] . </S>",
    "<S> the first insight is thus that the swimming pressure of takatori _ et al . _ </S>",
    "<S> is indeed the missing link to define and measure a pressure that is _ </S>",
    "<S> intensive_. what is quite striking is that the pressure within the interface is larger than the bulk pressure . identifying the interfacial tension with the excess stress ( the factor @xmath50 again accounts for the two interfaces ) leads to  @xcite @xmath71 \\simeq -842,\\ ] ] which becomes negative </S>",
    "<S> this is the second , quite surprising insight . </S>",
    "<S> while it has no consequence for the mechanical stability , our intuition tells us that a system with a negative tension can not be stable . </S>",
    "<S> the reason is that in systems for which classical thermodynamics is applicable , the interfacial tension determines the excess free energy due to the presence of interfaces . </S>",
    "<S> a negative tension implies that the suspension could lower its free energy by creating more interfaces , leading again to a homogeneous state . </S>",
    "<S> quite in contrast , in active suspensions one observes a stable , phase - separated state .    </S>",
    "<S> note that the excess stress is entirely due to the active pressure since @xmath72 , which means in particular that there is no energetic contribution from the potential energy . indeed , in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : press](a ) we observe an increase of the swimming pressure entering the interface before it drops . </S>",
    "<S> this can be understood qualitatively : the instantaneous interface has a small width [ cf . </S>",
    "<S> snapshots fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : slabs](a ) ] and acts like a ( flexible ) wall . </S>",
    "<S> swimmers accumulate but are still ( comparably ) free to slide along the interface in the @xmath12 direction , and hence their larger density ( with respect to the dilute region ) leads to a higher active tangential pressure @xmath55 . </S>",
    "<S> another puzzling observation is the magnitude of @xmath73 , which is huge compared to typical values @xmath74 in passive liquids ( _ e.g. _ , for vapor - liquid coexistence in the lennard - jones fluid in two dimensions @xmath75 has been reported  @xcite ) .     for @xmath29 : ( a )  as a function of box length @xmath76 for constant @xmath77 . </S>",
    "<S> the dashed line is a constant fit . </S>",
    "<S> ( b )  as a function of @xmath78 for constant @xmath79 . </S>",
    "<S> the dashed line is a fit of eq .   with @xmath80 and @xmath81 . </S>",
    "<S> error bars show standard deviation of 10 independent runs . ]    to reach a better understanding , we now study the interfacial width @xmath36 in more detail . fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ cwt ] shows @xmath36 obtained from several simulation runs at speed @xmath29 through fitting eq .  . </S>",
    "<S> we systematically study different system sizes by holding one box length fixed and varying the other . </S>",
    "<S> the total number of particles varies such that the global density is kept constant for all data points . </S>",
    "<S> while changing @xmath76 does not influence the width , we observe an increase of @xmath36 when increasing @xmath78 . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior demonstrates two things : first , the system sizes considered here are large enough to have reached a constant width as we vary @xmath76 . </S>",
    "<S> second , the dependance on @xmath78 agrees with standard capillary wave theory ( cwt ) assuming equipartition . </S>",
    "<S> hence , it is instructive to recall the arguments leading to cwt  @xcite : one assumes an ideal instantaneous interface , in our case a line of total length @xmath82 , which separates the two phases . to change this length </S>",
    "<S> , work has to be spent against the positive line tension . assuming no overhangs </S>",
    "<S> , one can decompose the profile @xmath83 into fourier modes @xmath84 . </S>",
    "<S> since the energy for every mode stems from the thermal environment , equipartition implies @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is the interfacial stiffness governing the fluctuations . for passive liquid - vapor coexistence , </S>",
    "<S> this stiffness is equal to the tension ( in units of @xmath18 per unit length ) .    to estimate the interfacial width @xmath36 </S>",
    "<S> , we calculate the fluctuations of the instantaneous interface  [ sm ] , @xmath87 which predict a linear divergence due to the capillary waves . </S>",
    "<S> the offset @xmath88 corresponds to fluctuations of the @xmath89 mode , which are bounded due to the periodic boundary conditions . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we have assumed that even in the driven active suspension equipartition holds . while the use of equipartition is of course not rigorous , the predicted leading linear dependence on @xmath78 agrees quite well with the simulation data in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ cwt](b ) . </S>",
    "<S> it can be further motivated by the fact that orientational degrees of freedom do not develop long - ranged correlations ( even in the phase - separated case ) . </S>",
    "<S> using eq .   </S>",
    "<S> we can thus fit the data in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ cwt](b ) to extract the stiffness @xmath90 , which is both positive and small . that it is positive agrees with the observation of stable phase separation and finite - size transitions , that it is small agrees qualitatively with the observed strong fluctuations .    finally , to rationalize a positive stiffness with a negative tension , recall that every particle swims with fixed velocity @xmath1 , _ i.e. _ , from the particle s perspective it pumps the surrounding fluid against its own hydrodynamic drag . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the particles constantly spent a `` housekeeping '' work @xmath91 on the solvent . </S>",
    "<S> the typical scale of this work per particle is the hydrodynamic force times the persistence length , @xmath92 ( in ref .   </S>",
    "<S> this expression appears as a positive energy scale ) . </S>",
    "<S> as long as the work per length @xmath93 gained from extending the interface is smaller , the interface is stable . </S>",
    "<S> the housekeeping work thus fulfills a role similar to the thermal energy in passive suspension . for the stiffness </S>",
    "<S> we then find @xmath94 for @xmath29 , which compares favorably with the value extracted from the fitted interfacial widths .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have demonstrated that the mechanical interfacial tension in phase - separated active suspensions is negative . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that work is released when the interfacial length @xmath82 is increased . </S>",
    "<S> however , this work is not `` available '' to the suspension but part of the work that is spent by the particles to drive the surrounding fluid . we expect that a negative tension is not specific to the model studied here but holds more generally in active matter . in principle </S>",
    "<S> , it can be observed in particle - resolved experiments  @xcite with a stabilized interface . </S>",
    "<S> the incorporation of both a negative tension and correct interfacial fluctuations into thermodynamic descriptions based on an effective free energy , a concept that seems to work well for the _ bulk _ phases  @xcite , is certainly challenging . </S>",
    "<S> the deeper reason is that in thermal equilibrium the same free energy determines the probability of fluctuations away from typical configurations , a connection that no longer holds for systems driven away from thermal equilibrium .    </S>",
