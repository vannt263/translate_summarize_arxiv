    "properties of a mesoscopic superconducting circuit may depend crucially on the presence of quasiparticles in its elements .",
    "the operation of a superconducting charge qubit , for example , requires two - electron periodicity of its charge states  @xcite .",
    "this periodicity may be interrupted by the entrance of an unpaired electron into the cooper - pair box ( cpb ) serving as an active element of a qubit .",
    "the quasiparticle changes the charge state of cpb from even to odd , and lowers the charging energy .",
    "this trapping phenomenon , commonly referred to as `` quasiparticle poisoning '' , is well - known from the studies of the charge parity effect in superconductors@xcite .",
    "quasiparticle poisoning contributes to the phase relaxation in superconducting qubits  @xcite . for a typical cpb size and tunnel conductances of the order of unit quantum , the quasiparticle dwelling times are of the order of a few @xmath0s .",
    "this time scale is at the edge of accessibility for the modern experiments  @xcite .",
    "individual quasiparticle tunneling events were resolved and the statistics of quasiparticle entrances and exits from the cpb box were investigated in refs .",
    "the observed statistics of entrances was well described by a standard poissonian process  @xcite . for the quasiparticle exits , the results are less clear . in many cases ,",
    "it may be well described by the poissonian statistics  @xcite .",
    "however , there are indications of deviation from that simple law for some samples  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we develop a kinetic theory of quasiparticle poisoning .",
    "we find the distribution of times @xmath1 and @xmath2 the cpb dwells , respectively , in odd- and even - electron states .",
    "we also find the spectrum of charge noise produced by the poisoning processes .",
    "the conventional poissonian statistics of the quasiparticle exits would yield an exponential distribution for odd - electron lifetime in the box .",
    "we see two reasons for the distribution function @xmath1 to deviate from that simple form . the first one is related to the thermalization of a quasiparticle within the cpb .",
    "if the rates of energy relaxation and of tunneling out for a quasiparticle in cpb are of the same order , then two different time scales control the short - time and long - time parts of the distribution function @xmath1 .",
    "the shorter time scale is defined by the escape rate @xmath3 of the unequilibrated quasiparticle from the cpb .",
    "the longer time scale is defined by the rate of activation of equilibrated quasiparticle to an energy level allowing an escape from cpb .",
    "the second reason for the deviations from the exponential distribution controlled by a single rate , comes from the singular energy dependence of the quasiparticle density of states in a superconductor . because of it , the tunneling - out rate depends strongly on the quasiparticle energy .",
    "thus , even in the absence of thermalization the quasiparticle escapes from cpb can not be described by an exponential distribution .",
    "the conventional poissonian statistics for both entrances and exits of the quasiparticle would lead to a lorentzian spectral density @xmath4 of cpb charge fluctuations  @xcite .",
    "the interplay of tunneling and relaxation rates may result in deviations from the lorentzian function . in the case of slow quasiparticle thermalization rate compared to the quasiparticle tunneling - out rate @xmath3 , the function @xmath4 roughly can be viewed as a superposition of two lorentzians .",
