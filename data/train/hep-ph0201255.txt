    "are being intensively explored from theoretical perspective , but no concrete experimental evidences has yet been found .",
    "a major motivation to go beyond the sm has been to get rid of those theoretically unsatisfactory aspects of the sm such as the hierarchy or naturalness problem@xcite and the triviality@xcite of the higgs sector , and that there are too many parameters to be explained .",
    "thus most particle theorists believe that the sm is only an effective theory of a fundamental theory . the currently prevailing direction to go beyond",
    "the sm has been the string theory@xcite and/or supersymmetric field theories@xcite .",
    "these theories modify the sm profoundly . as a matter of fact ,",
    "the most demanding task in and beyond sm physics is to find the true mechanism of symmetry breaking to replace the higgs sector that suffers the above - mentioned defects and is held as phenomenological . in this connection , there has been another important theoretical direction that does not modify the sm so profoundly , the technicolor model and its descendants@xcite . all the above theoretical constructions share a common feature : the elementary higgs scalar fields are excluded and the solution to the hierarchy and triviality problem must be in non - perturbative regime@xcite .",
    "however , more than a decade ago , there were some efforts to revive the @xmath0 interaction from the perturbative triviality by showing that the one loop effective potential of the massless @xmath0 permitted an nontrivial non - perturbative renormalization@xcite , i.e. , @xmath1 , in contrast to the perturbative renormalization where @xmath2 ( leading to triviality ) .",
    "on the other hand , it has been recently proposed that color confinement is closely related to flavor symmetry breaking@xcite and even that the color symmetry be realized via higgs mechanism@xcite . in a sense , the higgs model or",
    "the @xmath0 interaction is still useful and should be further explored to search for nontrivial solution of the model .",
    "if the symmetry breaking can be dynamically realized together with asymptotic freedom or non - triviality , then it will shed new light on the confinement of color and symmetry breaking of the standard model .",
    "thus it is worthwhile to see if the interesting nontrivial one loop solution can still exist after including higher loop corrections or how it evolves in presence of higher order quantum corrections .    in this paper",
    "we provide a detailed report of our recent investigation of the existence and new features ( if any ) of the nontrivial dynamical symmetry breaking solution of the quartic interaction by studying the two loop effective potential@xcite . for convenience , we will consider the simplest scalar model  the massless @xmath0 model with @xmath3 symmetry  with which the first example of the dynamical symmetry breaking was demonstrated@xcite .",
    "there is also a technical concern in choosing massless scalar theory : there is a nonconvexity in the tree interactions that affects the higgs model and often complicates the use of effective potential methods@xcite , while in massless models the tachyon mass term is gone and the configuration of the expectation value of scalar field can be naturally interpreted as the homogeneous argument of the effective potential .    in the meantime",
    ", we need to consider the regularization and renormalization problems in the nonperturbative regime .",
    "since the effective potential is nonperturbative in nature , its regularization and renormalization might become more subtle .",
    "there have long been standard procedures to carry out perturbative renormalization , but in nonperturbative contexts the renormalization often needs to be dealt with case by case , example by example .",
    "moreover , the nonperturbative context sometimes allows for an alternative renormalization solution , for example , the nontrivial or asymptotic free solution for the one loop potential of @xmath0 mentioned above@xcite .",
    "other examples about the subtleties associated with regularization and renormalization can be found in the recent applications of the effective - field - theory method@xcite to nucleon interactions@xcite , where the framework in use is necessarily nonperturbative .",
    "we hope our experiences here might be useful in carrying out renormalization within non - perturbative contexts .",
    "the paper is organized in the following way .",
    "the two loop effective potential will be given in dimensional and cutoff regularization respectively in sec.ii .",
    "the bare and renormalized effective potentials obtained in different schemes will also be listed there . then in sec .",

    "the prescription dependence of the solution is exhibited and explained .",
    "iv will be devoted to a new approach for evaluating the loop diagrams and the relevance of the intermediate renormalization is highlighted .",
    "some properties and features of the symmetry breaking solution in the two effective potential are also presented . some discussions and the summary will be given in the final section .",
    "as is stated in the introduction , we will consider the massless @xmath0 model with @xmath3 symmetry : invariance under the transformation of @xmath4 .",

    "now we see the explicit dependence of the effective potential upon the intermediate renormalization prescriptions expressed by @xmath23 , which varies across schemes as exhibited in table  [ table1 ] .    here the scheme dependence ( regularization and/or renormalization ) of the effective potential as a nonperturbative quantity ( summing over infinite many one- and two - loop one particle irreducible diagrams ) differs from that of the perturbative framework@xcite that arises from the truncation of perturbation series ( a sum of finite number of connected diagrams ) bosons in electro - weak theory ) . ] .",
    "the difference in @xmath23 could not be removed through redefinition of the coupling constant ( and perhaps of field strength ) without changing the functional dependence upon the field expectation value , @xmath24 .",
    "this is a crucial difference .",
    "the main obstacles here are ( i ) the presence of the double log dependence on @xmath24 ( in @xmath25 ) and ii ) the nonperturbative feature of the effective potential , i.e. , the sum over infinite many diagrams .",
    "if one redefines the coupling constant and expand the new coupling constant in terms of the old one like in the perturbative case ( @xmath26 ) , one could at best arrive at the other schemes results _ plus _ extra higher order terms that take the form @xmath27 .",
    "the same is true for the redefinition of @xmath24 or @xmath28 .",
    "since the effective potential is nonperturbative in terms of @xmath29 and @xmath24 in nature , one should not discard such kind of higher order terms due to consistency due to their nontrivial dependence upon @xmath24 that will affect the symmetry breaking status , unlike in the perturbative case .",
    "otherwise , as will be clear shortly , even if one put the consistency aside and discard such terms , the symmetry breaking behavior _ will be changed _ due to such kind of redefinition and approximation .",
    "thus even with the intermediate renormalization done in the standard way , the nonperturbative results depend on the prescriptions quite nontrivially . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "this new feature in the nonperturbative framework has not been explicitly and particularly pointed out .",
    "if there are no double log terms present in the effective potential except the single log terms , then the constant terms can be easily redefined away or absorbed into the single log terms without leading to new extra functional dependence upon @xmath24 that can affect the symmetry breaking . in gauge theories , there are only single log terms present in the sum of one particle irreducible diagrams . while here we encounter the essential presence of double log terms in the sum of one - particle irreducible diagrams at two loop level ( recall that the effective potential is the generating functional of the one - particle irreducible diagrams ) , it is not difficult to see that a still higher power of log terms can generally show up in higher loop one - particle irreducible diagrams .",
    ".values of @xmath23 in various schemes [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     [ table2 ]    now we see that dynamical symmetry breaking does happen in certain renormalization schemes in the strong - coupling regime . on the other hand",
    ", the stability requirement also imposes further constraint on the prescription choices in order to predict symmetry breaking . in this connection , note that the stable condition  ( [ stablecondition ] ) amounts to the following mathematical requirement @xmath30since the left - hand side of this inequality could not be less than @xmath31 , then we obtain the following criterion for @xmath23 , or for scheme choices , @xmath32which is more stringent requirement than @xmath33 .",
    "since the vacuum energy is a physical entity , it must be renormalization group invariant , i.e. , insensitive to the choice of subtraction point within a scheme , @xmath34we must stress that this condition in fact defines a fundamental physical scale as input in this broken phase that should be obtained from some kind of experimental measurements , corresponding to the important and necessary step after renormalization is done , i.e. , to confront the renormalized amplitudes with experiments or other physical inputs or conditions where the physical scales come from@xcite .",
    "consequently , a fundamental physical scale is introduced into the effective potential .    from this equation",
    ", we can determine the beta function of @xmath29 as was did in ref.@xcite .",

    "when the coupling becomes infinitely strong , i.e. , @xmath42 , the beta function approaches a straight line : @xmath43 while when the coupling approaches the critical value @xmath44 , the beta function also approaches a straight line with the same ratio : @xmath45    the wonderful thing that enhances our faith in the two loop effective potential is that all schemes ( except the coleman - weinberg scheme ) predict the same kind of running behavior of the coupling ( the same kind of beta function ) is satisfied , since the beta function is basically the same except the uv fixed point varies with prescription .",
    "] , and we could roughly imitate the true beta function with the following qualitative approximation : @xmath46with the obvious solution @xmath47which could also be obtained as a crude approximation of eq .",
    "( [ vac2 ] ) .",
    "the rg - invariant scale @xmath48 should be a function of the vacuum energy density as the fundamental physical scale for this theory .",
    "moreover , the running is relatively milder in the uv region , which means that the coupling constant does not become very large at energies that are not too low .",
    "the true running behavior defined by eq .",
    "( [ vac2 ] ) has been plotted in fig .",
    "[ mu ] .",
    "now it is clear that we obtained a _",

    "( [ rude2 ] ) we can identify an ir pole in terms of @xmath49 , unlike the ir landau pole in qcd , thus it is new at least in a theoretical sense .",
    "no matter what kind of phenomenon it defines , it is clear that within the two loop effective potential , the dynamical symmetry - breaking phase is nontrivial without asymptotic freedom , which means this phase is a totally strong - coupling phase .",
    "since this property is true in a number of renormalization prescriptions that satisfy the criterion  ( [ cr2 ] ) , we feel that it is at least an interesting phenomenon that deserves further examination .",
    "we emphasize that our derivation here has not employed any unconventional or special assumptions or approximations , all the techniques and arguments are well known and well established . from now on we denote this solution as scrdsb for strong coupling regime dynamical symmetry breaking .      before speculating on this scrdsb solution , let us examine the scale dependence patterns of the main quantities of interests .",
    "first let us look at the order parameter of the symmetry - breaking , i.e. , the square vacuum expectation value of the scalar field @xmath50 or equivalently @xmath51 .",
    "inverting the dimensionless function of coupling , we can express the running of the coupling in the following form by taking the vacuum energy density as fundamental in eq .",

    "we note that due to the extra term of @xmath53 in the vacuum energy density , the parameter @xmath54 is no longer a rg - invariant@xcite , in contrast to the one loop effective potential case .",
    "similarly , we can obtain the asymptotic behavior of the effective mass defined in eq .",

    "( [ omega ] ) , we have @xmath62with the above preparations , we find that @xmath63 or in terms of running scale , @xmath64 here we found new asymptotic behaviors that differ from both the asymptotic freedom and the triviality solutions . the effective mass ( self - energy at zero momentum ) becomes singular at both ir and uv ends . only in the moderate energy region characterized by the typical energy scale  the vacuum energy density ",
    "can we have finite effective mass .",
    "( of course we must be aware that since the dynamics of scrdsb exists entirely in a strong - coupling regime the uncalculated higher - order loop corrections will probably change the situation obtained here and make it even more complicated . ) the running behavior of the effective mass is plotted in fig .",
    "[ meff ] .    at this stage",
    ", one would naturally ask about the asymptotic behaviors of the effective coupling , defined as @xmath65 .",
    "the dependence of this four - point vertex function upon the renormalized coupling @xmath29 reads @xmath66after some calculations , we have @xmath67 or equivalently @xmath68note that the effective coupling becomes more singular than the effective mass does in the ir limit .",
    "since both the effective mass and the effective coupling become extremely singular in the ir limit , it is not difficult to see that in the low energy region , the kinetic energy of the scalar field is negligible and the static potential energy dominates , thus it seems impossible to find free scalar field quanta as asymptotic states , in this sense the elementary scalar field seems to be confined somehow even in the high energy ranges .",
    "we might detect some kind of bound states of such scalar field , with the new bound states being also scalar states .",
    "so , even though we found a scalar particle , there may appear another problem with regard to whether the detected particles are elementary ones or bound states of the elementary ones .",
    "in addition , the coupling is still strong in the high energy region , though not infinitely strong .",
    "the situation encountered here seems to indicate that the higgs model can allow for another scenario and symmetry - breaking mechanism provided one explores it nonperturbatively .",
    "the higgs scalar quanta seem to be hidden heros that did not like to be shown off in the asymptotic states .",
    "now we employ a new approach without explicit regulators or deformations to calculate the loop diagrams .",
    "this approach is based on the standard point of view that all the known qft s are effective theories for a completely well - defined quantum theory containing correct high - energy details@xcite",
    ". then we should make it clear that the uv structures of our present qft s are inevitably incorrect or inaccurate and should be replaced by the correct underlying ones that are unknown to us yet and hence certain diagrams can not be directly computed within the present formulation of qft s .",
    "( in conventional methods one introduces artificial regularizations to imitate the underlying uv structures . )    fortunately , since differentiating a loop diagram with respect to its low energy parameters ( momenta and mass(es ) that characterize the effective qft s ) amounts to inserting low energy vertices to this diagram ( this is valid in both the underlying theory and the effective theories ) , which in turn reduces the divergence degree of the diagram in terms of the effective qft s , we can compute a potentially divergent loop diagram after differentiating them with respect to the ( external ) momenta and/or mass(es ) for appropriate times . in other words",
    ", we can calculate the ill - defined diagrams by solving certain well defined differential equations@xcite . in this approach",
    ", the solutions would naturally contain unknown constants parametrizing the ill - definedness or incompleteness ( to be fixed by physical boundary conditions ) of the effective theories .",
    "it is obvious that this approach _ needs neither artificial regularizations nor complicated procedures_.      now we demonstrate this method with the sunset diagram , the two loop integral @xmath69 .",
    "first , we differentiate it with respect to mass square ( @xmath54 ) for two times to remove all overall ill - definedness ( divergence ) , @xmath70with @xmath71the result is a sum of new diagrams without any overall divergence . among these diagrams",
    ", @xmath72 still contains a subdivergence in the @xmath73 integration@xmath74    ( 2 ) .",

    "any consistent regularization and/or renormalization _ should be _ a special solution to these differential equations provided the counter - terms are local functions of the momenta and mass(es ) .",
    "one might feel that this approach is nothing but another form of the powerful bphz program@xcite . to respond",
    ", we note the following .",
    "first , one must employ a regularization method in bphz .",
    "second , the local terms in bphz are prefixed through the taylor expansion of the amplitudes , a crucial technical point , while in the differential equation approach the local term are _ to be fixed physically_. third , the bphz ends up with the introduction of infinite bare quantities while there is no room in principle for such infinite quantities at all if one adopts the underlying theory standpoint .",
    "fourth , the application of bphz ( and other conventional programs ) in nonperturbative circumstances is rather involved that might preclude any useful ( or trustworthy ) predictions@xcite , while the differential equation approach makes the calculation easier and the physical predictions more accessible@xcite .    in fact , one often relies on a good regularization method to make the subtraction simpler , e.g. , dimensional regularization for gauge theories .",
    "recently , it has been shown that in dimensional regularization some subtraction is done implicitly without introducing counterterms@xcite .",
    "that is , we rely heavily upon a regularization method that could discard divergences invisibly. if one disregards the underlying theory point of view where there is no divergence but there are ambiguities , then there seems to be no good reason to prefer the regularization methods that _ simply discard some of the divergences without subtraction_. for example , the modified minimal subtraction in dimensional regularization does not lead to useful predictions in the nonperturbative applications of the effective - field - theory method@xcite to nucleon interactions@xcite , which is followed by the works that employ unconventional renormalization methods@xcite .",
    "applying the underlying theory based differential equation approach will make the problem easier to resolve@xcite .",
    "now we arrive at the following general form of effective potential with unknown constants to be fixed , @xmath83\\}\\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\omega ^{2}\\{\\frac{c_{2}}{2(4\\pi ) ^{2}}+\\frac{6\\lambda ( c_{2}[\\hat{l}-1]+2c_{2}^{\\theta } ) } { ( 4\\pi ) ^{4}}\\},\\end{aligned}\\]]where @xmath84 and all the @xmath24-independent constant terms are discarded as they are irrelevant to our discussions here .",
    "naive dimensional analysis tells us that we have three dimensional constants , @xmath80 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 , and two dimensionless constants , @xmath77 and @xmath87 .",
    "in all the conventional prescriptions , the terms quadratic in @xmath28 are discarded somehow : in dimensional regularization , it is done due to the vanishing ( the invisible subtraction ) of power divergences , while in cutoff regularization it is just subtracted away by counterterms . here",
    "we must fix it via sound physical arguments .",
    "we may expect that there should be at least a fundamental scale to characterize the _ quantum _ fluctuations of the scalar field . as we are mainly concerned with the symmetry - breaking solution",
    ", we temporarily take the vacuum energy density to play the role of the fundamental scale . generally speaking",
    ", all the three dimensional constants should be of the same order of magnitude were they not zero .",
    "then the signs and magnitudes of @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath77 and @xmath87 will be crucial to the existence of symmetry - breaking solutions .",

    "this is because when @xmath28 becomes vanishingly small the potential reduces to @xmath90 where @xmath91 is a local maximum , a clear evidence of symmetry breaking , which is true even if @xmath86 is not zero as long as it is not too large compared to @xmath85 . of course , if we let both @xmath85 and @xmath86 equal to zero , then @xmath23 will determine the existence of symmetry breaking solutions .",
    "the most important point is that if one adopts a fixing prescription so that the quadratic terms are present , then we can by no way remove them by redefinition of the coupling constant ( and perhaps @xmath24 ) without altering the symmetry breaking status .",
    "that means , the fixing schemes with quadratic terms are at least inequivalent to those without .",
    "as the underlying theory is still unknown , we have to resort to experimental or other physical means to fix them .",
    "of course for such unrealistic model , experimental data are unavailable , thus we need to search for physical arguments . in the absence of obvious good clues to use ,",
    "a tentative argument might be that , due to the presence of the dimensional constants @xmath85 and @xmath86 as the coefficient of the quadratic terms , the effective potential would be rather sensitive to the rescaling of these dimensional constants , in contrast to the relatively milder rescaling behavior described by the logarithmic dependence upon the dimensional constant @xmath80 . then for the low energy effective potential to be less sensitive to the rescaling of the underlying details , we must fix the dimensional constants @xmath85 and @xmath86 to be zero .",
    "one might argue that this is just the unnatural fine tuning . if the differential equation approach is taken as another way to renormalize qft s , this is true .",
    "however , if we adopt the underlying theory point of view , we feel that this is a very natural argument .",
    "this is because in the underlying - theory - based differential equation there are no divergences to be subtracted but only ambiguities to be fixed ( a big improvement ) , then letting these dimensional constants equal to zero based on the insensitivity argument is just like what we usually do in solving the laplace equation or schrdinger equation , namely imposing sound boundary conditions .",
    "thus the underlying theory and differential equation approach offers a new way of understanding the vanishing of the quadratic divergence : not from symmetry argument but from the insensitivity of the effective theories quantities to the rescaling of the underlying structures ( represented by the arbitrary constants ) .",
    "of course there might be other possibilities .",
    "we will no longer investigate this topic here .",
    "now let us temporarily adopt the rescaling insensitivity requirement and focus on the other constants in the effective potential , i.e. , @xmath80 and @xmath23 in the following form of the effective potential , @xmath92\\}\\end{aligned}\\]]where @xmath93 .",
    "now since @xmath23 is dimensionless and @xmath80 only appears in the logarithmic functions , the rescaling insensitivity requirement is basically satisfied ( which is just the variant form of renormalization group invariance ) .",
    "however , this requirement does not automatically avoid the additional sensitivity to the definition of the dimensionless constant @xmath23 ( or @xmath77 and @xmath87 ) , the reason has already been given in section two .      as a by product we can determine whether the uv fixed point could be zero within the two loop effective potential .",
    "here is the reasoning . in order to get the asymptotic free solution , i.e. , @xmath94",
    ", it is clear from eq .",
    "( [ critical ] ) that we must require the constant @xmath23 to be infinitely large , @xmath95 this is in fact a divergent constant .",
    "no sensible renormalization prescription could allow for such a divergent number .",
    "if one adopts the underlying theory point of view , it is also an unacceptable choice of definition .",
    "otherwise , it might imply the underlying structures do not decouple with the low energy effective theories .",
    "therefore we conclude that the uv fixed point at two loop level can not be zero , i.e. , the solution can not be an asymptotic one , if we accept the parametrization eq .",
    "( [ pde3 ] ) or eq .",
    "( [ sch ] ) .",
    "generally the magnitude of @xmath23 should be of order not too bigger than @xmath96 , then the magnitude of the uv fixed point value of @xmath29 should be around @xmath97 , that is , roughly of the order 1 , which means that the broken phase can not be a weak coupling one even in the high - energy region .",
    "to recapitulate , in secs . ii and iii , we made use of the well - known two loop calculations to search for the symmetry - breaking solutions .",
    "our results here are new in two aspects .",
    "( i ) first , the striking prescription dependence of the nonperturbative framework differs from that of the standard perturbative framework@xcite , in other words , the perturbative scheme dependence pattern is no longer valid in nonperturbative contexts .",
    "thus we can understand the relevance of prescription found in nonperturbative applications like in ref.@xcite and @xcite ; ( ii ) .",
    "second , we found ( in a number of renormalization prescriptions ) that the massless @xmath0 model could also allow for a totally ( non - perturbative ) strong coupling dynamics regime with negative beta function ( scrdsb ) , and therefore could be nontrivial , at least in the two loop effective potential .",
    "although this phenomenon ( scrdsb ) is only discovered in the two loop effective potential , we found at least there is one thing that is in common with the one loop case : the existence of nontrivial phase of dynamics with broken symmetry that is strongly coupled at least in the ir region . considering the new kind of diagrams beginning to appear from two loop level ( the sunset diagram and so on ) , such consensus is conspicuous .",
    "we think nontrivial solution might persist after including still higher - order contributions , with the running behaviors being more complicated , perhaps with more stringent constraints on the scheme choices .",
    "as far as the two loop effective potential is concerned , it is very difficult to define asymptotic final states , thus the scalar field theories with quartic interaction is rather different from the gauge theories : it may have a broken phase that exists entirely in the strong - coupling regime .",
    "thus such scalar field theories with quartic interactions might not permit the elementary scalar fields to appear in the final asymptotic states .",
    "this scenario might be of certain reference value to higgs physics .",
    "another main task that has been performed is that we reanalyzed the loop diagrams from the underlying theory point of view , which takes all the presently known qft s that suffer uv ill - definedness to be ill - defined formulations of the effective low energy sectors .",
    "then we showed clearly that the prescriptions or choices for fixing the local ambiguities _ are _ relevant to physical properties encoded in the nonperturbative effective potential , especially for the quadratic terms .",
    "in contrast to the conventional regularization and renormalization programs where power divergences are present and must be subtracted carefully ( fine tuning ) , in the underlying theory understanding , we can fix them to be zero under the insensitivity requirement .",
    "this is a natural procedure that is usually done in electrodynamics and quantum mechanics , i.e. , imposing appropriate boundary conditions on the solutions obtained from the laplace or schrdinger equation . in this way",
    ", we arrive at a new understanding of the naturalness problem .",
    "furthermore , we also showed that there could not be reasonable prescriptions that would allow for asymptotic freedom in the broken phase as long as the two loop effective potential is considered . in the underlying theory understanding , this is also true .",
    "since more efforts in the realistic model are needed , we will refrain here from making further comments .",
    "our only aim here is to draw attention to the reexamination of our triviality conviction about the @xmath0 model and to the investigation of its new nonperturbative properties ( the perturbative regime is unavoidably trivial ) .    in summary",
    ", we reconsidered the massless @xmath0 model with @xmath3 symmetry and found that at two loop level the nonperturbative effective potential s predictability of symmetry breaking depends upon the renormalization prescriptions in use .",
    "the prescription used by coleman and weinberg in their pioneering work@xcite was shown to be incompatible with symmetry breaking in the two loop effective potential , while the modified minimal subtraction in dimensional regularization , jackiw s prescription , and others were shown to be able to accommodate symmetry - breaking solution in the two loop effective potential .",
    "the reason for the relevance of prescriptions in nonperturbative contexts was given .",
    "the potential was also recalculated and reanalyzed in a differential equation approach based on the standard point of view that a complete theory underlies all the qft s that suffer uv divergences .",
    "the relevance of the prescriptions for fixing the local ambiguities was stressed and the rationality of this approach was highlighted .",
    "the authors are grateful to w. zhu for critical discussions and encouragements .",
    "we also benefited from conversations with prof .",
    "this work is supported in part by the national natural science foundation of china under grant no .",
    "in this appendix , we write down all the needed one loop integrals calculated respectively in dimensional , cut - off and differential equation approach .",
    "@xmath98+c_2\\omega^2+c_3\\};\\\\ i_{1}(\\omega)&=&\\frac{1}{(4\\pi)^2}\\{\\omega^2[\\ln \\frac{\\omega^2}{\\mu^2_{pde}}+c_1 - 1]+c_2\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that in the differential equation approach there appear unknown constants in the integrals parametrizing the ill - definedness .",
    "the constants should be fixed by boundary conditions as discussed above .",
    "in this section , we describe the @xmath17 scheme that mimics the @xmath15 scheme in dimensional regularization , i.e. , we merely subtract the cut - off containing parts .",
    "let us demonstrate it with the sunset diagram .",
    "first let us list out all the relevant integrals or diagrams , @xmath99the counter term for sub - divergence in @xmath100 comes from the log in @xmath101 containing @xmath102 as an argument , i.e. , from @xmath103 together with factors from graph topology and angular integration .",
    "thus the counterterm for the sunset diagram reads @xmath104 here we selected an arbitrary scale to balance the dimension in the argument of log . after removing the subdivergence",
    ", we get for the sunset diagram @xmath105    now we see all remaining divergences are purely local and can be removed through introducing a second counterterm @xmath106 , @xmath107which contains no finite part , and the renormalized sunset diagram now takes the following form @xmath108^{(\\mu^2_{\\lambda } ) } & \\equiv & -48\\lambda^2\\phi^2i^{(\\lambda)}_{2}(\\omega)+c.t.(1)+c.t.(2 ) \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\frac{6\\lambda\\omega^4}{(4\\pi)^4}\\{(\\ln \\frac{\\omega^2}{\\mu^2})^2 - 2\\ln \\frac{\\omega^2}{\\mu^2}\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "in this appendix , we verify that even in the original parametrization the coleman - weinberg scheme is still incompatible with the dsb solution . the two loop effective potential in ref .",
    "@xcite reads @xmath109 from the first order condition , we find the following equation @xmath110 that is , @xmath111the corresponding delta reads @xmath112this inequality implies the incompatibility of the coleman - weinberg scheme with symmetry breaking at two loop level .",
