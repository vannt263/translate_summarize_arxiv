    "heavy elements ( or metals ) in the universe are created in stars and supernovae ( sne ) .",
    "these metals enrich the interstellar medium and are recycled into generations of stars .",
    "some part of these should have been transported into intergalactic space via galactic winds or ram pressure stripping .",
    "indeed , the intracluster medium ( icm ) contains an amount of metals comparable to the total amount of metals found in galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the distribution of these metals can be measured exclusively by x - ray spectroscopy .",
    "this constrains the total number of sne in galaxies and the efficiency of the mass transport from galaxies into intergalactic space .",
    "moreover , the abundance ratios among elements ( e.g. si / fe ratio ) can be used to identify their origins ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "_ asca _  and _ beppo - sax _",
    "observations provided the first systematic measurements of si , s and fe abundances and their spatial distributions ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "_ xmm - newton _  has allowed more detailed studies including the o abundance determination ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "recent _ suzaku _  data have further improved measurements of elements such as o and mg ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) . mostly , observed abundance patterns are explained by some combinations of origins from type ia and type ii sne ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "note that the nature of these sne and hence their total metal products have not completely been understood .",
    "in addition , some authors claim that the observed metal abundances require an alternative source such as hypernovae in early generations of stars @xcite .",
    "however , measurements are still limited to abundant elements and even for those elements statistical and systematic errors are large .",
    "see @xcite for a recent review on x - ray spectroscopy of clusters .    here",
    "we present _ suzaku _  xis ( x - ray imaging spectrometer ) spectroscopy of the central region of the perseus cluster of galaxies , which is the brightest cluster in x - rays .",
    "this is a calibration target of the xis and hence has been observed regularly .",
    "we used all available data from several exposures .",
    "the deep exposure of this unique object along with the high sensitivity of the xis provides one of the best quality x - ray spectra from clusters .",
    "we have detected x - ray line emission from ionized cr and mn for the first time from an extragalactic source .",
    "furthermore we accurately measured elemental abundances of ne , mg , si , s , ar , ca , fe , and ni .    throughout this paper , we assume cosmological parameters as follows ; @xmath2 km s@xmath3mpc@xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 . at the cluster redshift of 0.0183",
    ", one arc - minute corresponds to 22.2  kpc at the cluster distance .",
    "we use the 90% confidence level .",
    "as a calibration target , the perseus cluster has been observed twice a year in various operation modes .",
    "here we use the data obtained from february 2006 to february 2009 in the normal window mode .",
    "sequence numbers of the data are 800010010 , 101012010 , 101012020 , 102011010 , 102012010 , 103004010 , 103005010 , and 103004020 .",

    "detailed descriptions of the _ suzaku _  observatory , the xis instrument , and the x - ray telescope are found in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , respectively .",
    "we started the analysis from archived cleaned event files , which were filtered with the standard selection criteria .",
    "we used the latest calibration file as of may 2009 .",
    "we examined light curves excluding the central bright region events ( @xmath7 ) for stable - background periods .",
    "there was no flaring event in all data .",
    "the instrumental ( non - x - ray ) background was estimated using the night earth observation database and the software xisnxbgen @xcite .",
    "the cosmic x - ray background was estimated to be well below 1% of the source over almost entire enegy band .",
    "we therefore ignore this cosmic background in the following analysis .",
    "we extracted spectra from three annulus regions with boundary radii of @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath0 centered on the x - ray maximum .",
    "the central region ( @xmath11 ) is excluded to avoid the contribution from the central galaxy .",
    "we prepared an x - ray telescope response function for each spectrum using the xis arf builder software xissimarfgen @xcite , assuming an icm surface brightness distribution based on an _ xmm - newton _  public image of the cluster as a source image .",
    "we simulated events so that the relative error of the response at each energy bin is smaller than 0.25% ( using a parameter accuracy ) . to made the xis energy response function , we used the software xisrmfgen .    to describe the thermal emission from a collisional ionization equilibrium plasma",
    ", we use the apec model @xcite with the solar metal abundances taken from @xcite .",

    "on the contrary , other abundances of ne , mg , si , s , ar , ca , and ni are coupled between the two components , e.g. ne@xmath14 @xmath15 ne@xmath16 . a power - law component with a fixed photon index of 1.8",

    "this describes a combination of scattering of the central galaxy emission and the possible distributed hard x - ray emission suggested by @xcite . in some spectra",
    "we found line emission at the position of he - like cr . because there is no line from cr included in the apec model , here ,",
    "we add a gaussian component for the cr line into the fitting model .",
    "a detailed analysis of this line is given in the next subsection .    to avoid calibration errors , we ignore energy ranges around the si k edge ( @xmath17  kev ) and the au m edge ( @xmath18  kev ) . to compensate errors of the energy - pi relation , redshifts of the two apec components",
    "are allowed to be different . in @xmath19 regions ,",

    "the other residual can be seen in the energy range of @xmath25  kev only in the @xmath26 fit .",
    "this could be related to instrumental background .",
    "at this energy band , the background is dominated by line emission such as mn k@xmath27 ( 5.9  kev ) , mn k@xmath28 ( 6.5  kev ) , and ni k@xmath27 ( 7.5  kev ) .",
    "time variations in line fluxes and changes in the line spread function create errors on the background estimation @xcite .",

    ", following @xcite , we use line emissivities of elements ( si , s , ar , ca , fe , and ni ) available from the atomdb and estimate those of cr and mn . here",

    "[ fig : cr](b ) .",
    "we used temperatures ( table  [ tbl : cr - mn ] ) calculated by averaging over the two thermal components in the best - fit model obtained in subsection 3.2 .",
    "errors introduced by the interpolation would be smaller than @xmath82% .",
    "this estimation along with observed fluxes gives cr and mn abundances ( table  [ tbl : cr - mn ] ) : cr / fe and mn / fe ratios are @xmath83 and @xmath84 times the solar , respectively .",
    "the above estimated values obtained for cr and mn along with the fe and ni abundances derived in the spectral fitting provide iron - group abundances for the first time in the icm .",
    "we found cr : mn : fe : ni ratios close to the solar value .",
    "these abundance patterns depend on the nature of their origins , supernovae ( sne ) .",
    "for example , @xcite propose to reveal the detailed nature of type ia sn using mn , cr , and fe x - ray lines in sn remnants . in the case of the icm metals",
    ", we can examine sne averaged over many events in member galaxies .",
    "the present result supports the idea that the metals in the icm and solar neighborhood were produced in a similar way .",
    "first , the _ chandra _  result in the perseus cluster @xcite is compared .",
    "we used their abundance pattern obtained from a region ( 40 - 80  kpc ) similar to our data , but accounted for projection .",
    "the ne / fe , si / fe , ar / fe , ca / fe , and ni / fe ratios are consistent with the _ suzaku _  result .",
    "in contrast , the _ chandra _  data shows lower mg / fe ( @xmath85 ) and higher s / fe ( @xmath86 ) values than the solar ratio found in the current study .",
    "we suppose that these inconsistencies are caused partly by calibration errors used in @xcite and partly caused by the difference in the spectral extraction method .",
    "indeed , we found that much longer _",
    "chandra _  data ( @xmath23 1  ms exposure ) with the latest calibration and without the projection correction give mg and s abundances consistent with our result .",
    "second , we compared our result with measurements in other clusters [ fig .",
    "[ fig : abun](c ) ] .",
    "note that including our study , most results are derived from cluster central regions ( within a few 100  kpc ) . in most elements , our results are consistent with those in other clusters .",
    "exceptions are lower ar and higher ca abundances in average values over a sample of 22 clusters reported by @xcite .",
    "we can not find this trend in the perseus cluster .",
    "for all measured elements from ne to fe , the cluster abundances are consistent with the solar ratios within uncertainties .",
    "the ni / fe ratios are relatively high .",
    "this may be a sign of a contribution from type ia sne ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the sub - solar value of o / fe measured in other studies may have a similar origin ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "third , our measurement is compared with that from galactic stars with extremely low metallicity [ fig .",
    "[ fig : abun](c ) ; @xcite ] .",
    "the latter abundances should be close to those originated from the first generation of stars and sne in the universe .",
    "the patterns are very different . among elements that we measured , elements lighter than cr are more abundant in the metal poor stars , while cr , mn , and ni are more abundant in the icm .",
    "this comparison , regardless of theoretical models , indicates that the icm is polluted not solely by the first generations of stars but also by additional source(s ) significantly .",
    "the additional source(s ) should add iron group elements to the icm .",
    "the most - likely dominant contributor is type ia sne , as in the galactic chemical evolution model ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the abundance pattern in the perseus cluster is closer to the solar value than to those in extremely low metallicity stars .",
    "therefore the contribution of the first generations of stars into the icm metal is not required largely , in contrast to the model proposed in @xcite .    finally ,",
    "the measured pattern is compared with theoretical predictions from two types of sne [ fig  [ fig : abun](d ) ] .",
    "the observed abundance pattern can not be produced solely by each type of sne .",
    "all the observed abundance ratios are between the two predictions , except for cr and mn , which have relatively large uncertainties .",
    "consequently , we conclude that the metals in the icm of the perseus and other clusters were produced by a mix of both types of sne .",
    "similar conclusions have been obtained from _ asca _  ,",
    "_ chandra _  , and _ xmm - newton _  studies ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the present data strengthen this scenario .",
