    "sodium ( na ) atoms are believed to be deposited in the high atmosphere by meteoritic ablation .",
    "they form a layer whose average altitude lies in the 90 - 95 km altitude range above sea level .",
    "this altitude can vary from 85 km to 105 km depending on the particular physical conditions .",
    "the sodium abundance displays typical seasonal variations of a factor of 2 to 4 , with the minimum and maximum seasonal abundance occurring in summer and winter , respectively @xcite .",
    "significant abundance variations on hourly , daily and yearly time scales have been reported , even on time scales of a few seconds to a few hours @xcite .",
    "the sodium layer mean altitude and width also exhibit significant variations on short and long time scales : the layer is in average lower in altitude ( by 1 to 2 km ) and thinner ( by 1 km ) at the equinoxes , and higher in altitude and thicker at the solstices @xcite .",
    "most of the short time scale abundance and mean altitude variations can be traced down to the appearance of relatively short - lived , high density , thinner layers within the main sodium layer , which are refered to as sporadics @xcite .      observations with adaptive optics ( ao ) are limited to certain areas on the sky due to the requirement of a stellar source to measure the wavefront distortions .",
    "a solution to this sky coverage problem is to create an artificial guide star with a laser @xcite .",
    "a so - called `` sodium lgs '' can be created from resonant backscattering of mesospheric sodium atoms . today , almost all leading telescopes are equipped with lgs - ao systems @xcite , and recently , the gemini observatory produced the first sodium lgs constellation to feed a multi - conjugate adaptive optics ( mcao ) system at the gemini south 8-meter telescope . with the increasing prevalence of such lgs systems",
    ", it is becoming more critical to understand and investigate the intrinsic properties and characteristics of the mesospheric sodium layer .",
    "for instance , a good knowledge of the sodium abundance is crucial to understand the fluctuations of the brightness of the lgs during the year , and hence the impact and limitations on the ao performance .",
    "this information is also helpful to optimize queue observations . also of importance",
    "is the study of the sodium layer interaction with a given laser format so this interaction can be optimized , as different laser formats can lead to very different results @xcite .",
    "the following characteristics of the sodium layer are key for the ao performance :    * mesospheric sodium column density . *",
    "temporal behavior of the sodium layer mean altitude .",
    "* sodium layer thickness .",
    "_ mesospheric sodium column density _",
    "+ the mesospheric sodium column density is the most crucial parameter to characterise so that the effectiveness of the sodium lgs technique can be maximised .",
    "this is because , in absence of saturation or at low saturation levels typically achieved with currently existing lgs ao systems , the required laser power per beacon is directly proportional to the sodium column density .",
    "therefore , the measurement of the minimum sodium column density over a year sets an upper limit for laser power requirements .",
    "additionally , the seasonal and nightly statistics of sodium density fluctuations , which are equivalent to lgs magnitude fluctuations , provide insights into the expected long and short term system performance such that the efficiency and flexibility of queue scheduling can be maximised .",
    "+ _ temporal behavior of the sodium layer mean altitude _ + the rate of mean sodium altitude variations is of prime importance for optimum removal of the focus mode in ao - corrected science images . focus adjustments in the lgs path of ao systems must distinguish atmosphere - induced focus terms from slow drifts of the guide star altitude .",
    "the faster the mean sodium altitude varies , the more difficult it is to distinguish those two effects and adequately correct for them .",
    "gems is equipped with a slow focus sensor ( sfs ) that monitors the sodium altitude drifts .",
    "knowledge of the required rate at which this sensor should run is thus very important .",
    "on the other hand , for ao systems working with a lgs constellation like gems , the differential focus error between the lgs is also of importance .",
    "a differential focus between the lgs would produce a signal that could not be properly treated by a tomographic reconstructor , and would therefore lead to non - negligeable loss of performance out of the ao system .",
    "the temporal behavior of this differential error is key for the design of future ao systems on extremely large telescopes @xcite .",
    "+ _ sodium layer thickness _",
    "+ the sodium thickness will determine the lgs spot elongation as viewed from a subaperture located near the edge of the telescope pupil ( this is @xmath01 arcsec for an 8 m telescope and comparable to the lgs spot size ) .",
    "the larger the telescope , the more elongated the spot , the more sensitive the adaptive optics system is to noise and therefore the more laser power is required to achieve a given performance .      with the increasing use of sodium lgs in astronomical ao",
    ", many studies have been done in the past years to characterize more precisely the properties of the sodium layer in the light of ao requirements .",
    "models have been developed to predict the sodium abundance and expected photon return for different sites @xcite .",
    "the temporal behavior of sodium profiles , and the variations of the mean altitude have also been studied in detail @xcite . however , whereas the sodium layer had been observed quite extensively at several locations , no measurements had been made yet in chile at or near the latitude of cerro pachn .",
    "the gemini observatory therefore initiated a year - long sodium monitoring campaign at the cerro tololo inter - american observatory ( ctio ) located only a few kilometers away from the gemini south telescope . in 2001 , during a series of 6 runs , a laser experiment was carried out at cerro tololo to monitor the abundance and altitude of the mesospheric sodium .",
    "the goal was to characterize yearly , nightly and hourly the mesospheric sodium variations at ctio / gemini latitude @xcite .",
    "this set of data is compared with the results obtained during the first year of the gemini mcao system ( called gems ) commissioning .",
    "gems started on - sky commissioning in january 2011 , at a rate of 5 to 7 nights per month @xcite .",
    "this first period of commissioning lasted 5 months , after which gems entered a shutdown phase for engineering upgrades .",
    "on - sky operations resumed in november 2011 , and continued up to may 2012 . during this first period of commissioning",
    ", we gathered data about the sodium return as seen by the lgs wavefront sensors , and the differential focus between the lgs .",
    "the differential focus error analysis will be presented in a forthcoming paper .",
    "+ this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 presents the ctio campaign along with the data reduction and results .",
    "section 3 presents the gems data , data reduction and results .",
    "section 4 compares the results of both data sets , and discusses the impact of the laser format on performance .",
    "the experimental setup has been described in detail in @xcite , here we only present its main characteristics .",
    "the experiment involved launching a laser beam whose wavelength was tuned to the sodium d2 absorption line ( 589 nm ) to the sky such that mesospheric sodium atoms were excited to higher energy levels .",
    "sodium atoms were excited with a low - power continuous - wave laser whose interaction with sodium atoms was relatively well - known @xcite .",
    "the laser equipment included a 6 - 7  w multi - line argon - ion laser pumping a commercial ring - dye laser .",
    "the laser output power was monitored in real time at a  0.3 hz rate so that sodium density fluctuations could be calibrated out from laser power fluctuations .",
    "the on - sky 589 nm launched power was in the @xmath0100 - 200 mw range and sent to the sky by a custom launch telescope .",
    "the laser beam , a truncated gaussian of @xmath0250  mm at the @xmath1 intensity points , was projected about 3 degrees off zenith at a fixed angle .",
    "the 0.9 m ctio telescope and the university of michigan schmidt telescope were used to image the laser guide star thus created .",
    "they were respectively at a distance of 140 m and 110 m away from the laser projection system yielding a spot elongation of @xmath035  arcsec .",
    "images were taken with successive exposures of typically 10 seconds but this period of data acquisition varied depending on the photometry of the night .",
    "it reached up to 30 seconds on some of the observations .",
    "standard stars were also observed a few times per night in order to derive atmospheric transmission .",
    "provided that all due telescope calibrations were performed , and that the atmosphere optical transparency was measured during the night , the ccd data then contained all information necessary to retrieve the sodium column density , sodium layer width and relative altitude .",
    "the absolute altitude could also be derived by a triangulation method based on the natural guide star trails seen on the ccd behind the laser streak , however this method has not been implemented on the data yet , hence only relative altitudes will be presented here .",
    "observations were spread over one year from february 2001 to february 2002 to allow characterization of hourly , nightly and yearly variations of the sodium layer parameters .",
    "five runs of 7 to 10 nights were performed in february , may , september , november 2001 and february 2002 .",
    "those particular months were chosen to match the expected minimum ( november / december ) and maximum ( may ) of the sodium column density sinusoid - like variations .",
    "table [ ttable ] indicates the dates of each run and the resulting number of useful nights when data was taken .",
    "+    .data summary .",
    "`` useable data '' means that the photometry was reliable enough for laser profiles not to depend on weather variations ( e.g. variable cirrus cover ) . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     we are hopeful that , in the future , closer coordination with the andes lidar observatory will permit concurrent gems laser and lidar laser propagation above cerro pachn",
    ". direct calibration of the sodium abundance at the same time as gems sodium photon return data is gathered will likely prompt a review or at least a refinement of the conclusions presented here .",
    "we have presented results on the sodium photon return and characteristics of lgs created above cerro pachn and cerro tololo based on two sets of data .",
    "both were gathered over more than a year of observations and have been used to compute the sodium photon return per watt of projected laser , the sodium profiles and the variations of the sodium layer mean altitude .",
    "the results show that :    * a lgs exhibits a large variety of fluctuations in shape and brightness .",
    "these changes can appear on very short ( few seconds ) or seasonal time scales . *",
    "average sodium equivalent width are on the order of @xmath010 km , which leads to a spot elongation of @xmath01 arcsec for an 8 m telescope using an on - axis launch configuration . *",
    "a small correlation of the sodium equivalent width with seasons is detected : the sodium layer is thinner by 1 km around september . *",
    "the psd of the sodium mean altitude variation is well fitted by a model defined by @xmath2 .",
    "we derived @xmath3=35 m@xmath4hz@xmath5 and @xmath6=-1.9 in good agreement with previous data published in northern hemisphere . * a refocusing rate of @xmath730 s",
    "is required for gems . *",
    "the sodium photon return shows a large variability over a year , with seasonal fluctuations on the order of 3 to 4 .",
    "* nightly fluctuations of photon return by a factor of two are regularly seen . * comparing sodium photon returns obtained with two different lasers clearly illustrates the impact of the laser format on coupling efficiency with the sodium layer .",
    "for the two laser format described in tab .",
    "[ tabtab ] and used in this study , we measure a difference in efficiency by a factor of @xmath03 .",
