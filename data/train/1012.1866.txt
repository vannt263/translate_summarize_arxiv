    "interesting structural transitions from 1d lines of particles to zig - zag or buckled states can occur @xcite .",
    "there can also be higher order transitions from 2 rows to 3 rows of particles or transitions to disordered states @xcite . under an external drive",
    ", this type of system also exhibits a variety of dynamical behavior such as ordered or disordered motion through constrictions @xcite or dynamic commensurability effects @xcite .",
    "here we propose a simple system consisting of particles in two or three coupled 1d channels .",
    "the particles in each channel interact with the other particles in the same channel as well as with particles in adjacent channels via a yukawa potential .",
    "an external drive applied to only one channel produces drag effects on the particles in the undriven channels , causing them to move .",
    "our system is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "the two channel system is similar to the transformer geometry studied for vortices in two superconducting layers where an external drive is applied to one ( primary ) layer and the response of the nondriven ( secondary ) layer is measured @xcite . if the vortices in the two layers are fully coupled , the response of the secondary layer is exactly the same as the response of the primary layer .",
    "if the vortices are only partially coupled , the response in the secondary layer is smaller than that of the primary layer .",
    "the transformer geometry has also been studied for vortex systems with multiple layers , such as vortices in the strongly layered high - temperature superconductors @xcite .",
    "drag effects have also been predicted for two coupled 1d wires containing classical 1d wigner crystals when only one of the wires is driven @xcite . in this case",
    "the interaction between particles in neighboring wires is repulsive , unlike the attractive interaction between vortices in neighboring layers . for the coupled 1d wigner crystals",
    "there is also a transition from a completely locked state , where the response in both wires is identical , to a partially locked state , where the response of the secondary wire is reduced .",
    "drag effects in coupled wire experiments have been interpreted as arising from the formation of wigner crystal states @xcite .    .",
    "the bottom undriven channels are the secondary channels @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the ratio of the number of particles in each channel is @xmath2 and @xmath3 , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the number of particles in the secondary channels and @xmath6 is the number of particles in the primary channel .",

    ", width=336 ]    in this work we consider the effect of changing the ratio of the number of particles in each channel on the locking or coupling between the channels , with a particular focus on ratios that are integers or rational fractions .",
    "commensuration effects @xcite occur when the spacing between particles in one channel is a simple rational fraction of the spacing between particles in another channel , while incommensurations such as vacancies or interstitials appear when the two spacings are incommensurable .",
    "commensuration effects have been studied extensively for systems in which a varied number of particles interacts with a rigid periodic substrate , such as atoms and molecules on surfaces @xcite , vortices in superconductors with periodic pinning arrays @xcite , and colloids interacting with 1d @xcite or two - dimensional ( 2d ) optical trap arrays @xcite , all of which can be viewed as physical realizations of the frenkel - kontrova model .",
    "these studies find that the coupling to the substrate or the effective pinning of the particles by the substrate is strongly enhanced when the ratio of the number of particles to the number of substrate minima is an integer or a rational fraction , as indicated by the appearance of peaks in the critical depinning force or enhanced ordering of the particles at the commensurate fillings . in our system , for the two channel geometry illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] the particles in the secondary channel can be regarded as a distortable or moveable periodic pinning substrate for the particles in the primary channel , suggesting that enhanced drag or coupling could occur when the ratio of the number of particles in each channel is an integer or a rational fraction .",
    "the deformability of the substrate makes our proposed model distinct from frenkel - kontrova systems .",
    "additionally , driven 1d and 2d commensurate - incommensurate systems often exhibit numerous dynamic behaviors within the incommensurate regimes , such as when localized vacancies or interstitials form soliton - like excitations which move more easily than the particles over the substrate @xcite .",
    "this suggests that similar phases may be possible in the coupled channel drag system we propose here , and we show that such phases do appear .",
    "we also show that when we make the system more complex by adding a third channel , a remarkable variety of commensuration effects and dynamic regimes occur such as multiple decoupling , recoupling , and slip transitions , all of which produce pronounced changes in the velocity response .",
    "it is even possible to realize negative drag effects where the particles in one of the channels move in the direction opposite to that of the applied drive .",
    "the coupled channels system we propose could be realized in colloidal systems .",
    "the number of colloids in the different channels can be controlled readily by optical manipulation and the colloids in one channel could be driven with an external field , optically , or using microfluidics .",
    "another possible realization of this system is in nanowires where 1d wigner crystallization of the electrons has occurred ; in this case , by altering the electron density , the particle lattice spacing in one wire could be varied with respect to that in an adjacent wire .",
    "realizing such a system could have important implications for the study of 1d wigner crystals since the appearance of commensuration effects would be strong evidence that wigner crystal states are forming . in superconducting systems , the density of magnetic vortices is fixed by the externally applied magnetic field , so it would be difficult to create 1d channels that contain different linear densities of vortices ; however , in certain layered systems an additional transverse magnetic field can be applied to create a second josephson vortex lattice which can interact with the pancake vortices in the planes @xcite .",
    "it has already been shown that using this technique it is possible to drive only one of the vortex species and induce a drag on the other vortex species @xcite .",
    "it should be possible to study fractional commensurate states in such a vortex system by examining how the drag effect changes when the ratio of the number of one type of vortices to the other is varied .",
    "a realization of three or more channels with varied numbers of particles in each channel should again be possible using colloidal systems or metallic wires .",
    "further , a superconducting or nanowire system could be used in which each layer or channel has the same number of particles but differing amounts of quenched disorder .",
    "we note that there are previous studies of colloidal particles in 2d bilayers @xcite where the particles in the layers are driven in opposite directions ; however , these studies focused on an oscillatory order - disorder transition , not on the effects of commensuration on decoupling or the dynamic phases that we consider here for the case of 1d coupled channels .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii , we describe our simulation method and sample geometry .",
    "we consider two channels of particles in section iii and illustrate a drive - induced decoupling transition for commensurate channels in section iii a. in section iii b we describe the two step decoupling transition that occurs for incommensurate channels which contain vacancy or interstitial sites that can act like a second species of particle .",
    "the effects of finite temperature and finite size appear in section iii c. section iii d shows that the nonlinear response of the system can be exploited to create a ratchet effect , where ac motion in the driven channel induces dc transport in the drag channel . in section",
    "iv we turn to samples with three channels .",
    "we show in section iv a that when the driven channel is commensurate with the neighboring drag channel , four different types of coupled and decoupled flow can occur as the occupancy of the second drag channel is varied , including regimes of intermittent coupling . in section iv b , the driven channel is incommensurate with the neighboring drag channel and we find a complex series of coupling - decoupling transitions that produce a significant amount of structure in the velocity - force curves . in section",
    "iv c , we consider in detail the negative drag that can occur at incommensurate fillings when the particles in one of the drag channels move in the direction opposite to the particles in the driven channel .",
    "it is also possible for the outer channels to remain coupled while the central channel is decoupled , as described in section iv d. in section iv e we summarize all five of the dynamical phases and the negative drag by showing that they can be achieved in a single system .",
    "the paper concludes in section v with a discussion and summary .",

    "additionally , these effects could also be realized using coupled wires in which one - dimensional wigner crystal states occur .",
    "the velocity - force responses that we predict could be a potentially powerful method for determining whether wigner crystals are actually present in the wires .",
    "it would also be interesting to study ratchet effects with asymmetric ac drives for three or more channels . here",
    ", it may be possible to induce dc currents flowing in different directions for different channels .",
    "although the system we consider appears very simple , we have shown that it exhibits a rich variety of behaviors even without substrates or other complications .",
    "if a periodic substrate were introduced in one or more of the channels , we expect that an even greater variety of commensuration effects and coupling between excitations in the channels could occur",
    ". it would also be interesting to consider cases where the channels are not strictly one - dimensional but have a finite width to allow for transitions to buckled or zig - zag states .",
    "even for the commensurate fillings , such buckling transitions could produce interesting new features in the drag behavior .",

    "<S> we introduce a simple model consisting of two or three coupled one - dimensional channels of particles with yukawa interactions . for the two channel system , when an external drive is applied only to the top or primary channel , we find a transition from locked flow where particles in both channels move together to decoupled flow where the particles in the secondary or undriven channel move at a slower velocity than the particles in the primary or driven channel . </S>",
    "<S> pronounced commensurability effects in the decoupling transition occur when the ratio of the number of particles in the top and bottom channels is varied , and the coupling of the two channels is enhanced when this ratio is an integer or a rational fraction . </S>",
    "<S> near the commensurate fillings , we find additional features in the velocity - force curves caused by the slipping of individual vacancies or incommensurations in the secondary channels . </S>",
    "<S> for three coupled channels , when only the top channel is driven we find a remarkably rich variety of distinct dynamic phases , including multiple decoupling and recoupling transitions . </S>",
    "<S> these transitions produce pronounced signatures in the velocity response of each channel . </S>",
    "<S> we also find regimes where a negative drag effect can be induced in one of the non - driven channels . </S>",
    "<S> the particles in this channel move in the opposite direction from the particles in the driven channel due to the mixing of the two different periodic frequencies produced by the discrete motion of the particles in the two other channels . in the two channel system </S>",
    "<S> , we also demonstrate a ratchet effect for the particles in the secondary channel when an asymmetric drive is applied to the primary channel . </S>",
    "<S> this ratchet effect is similar to that observed in superconducting vortex systems when there is a coupling between two different species of vortices . </S>"
