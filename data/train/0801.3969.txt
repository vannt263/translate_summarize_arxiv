    "early - type disk galaxies are galaxies of morphological types s0s0/a ( lenticular galaxies ) and sa with properties similar to those of lenticular galaxies .",
    "the structure of early - type disk galaxies is similar to that of later - type spirals : they have a massive stellar disk and , in many cases , also a dynamically decoupled stellar circumnuclear disk , a developed bulge , and a dark halo that determines the rotational velocity of their outer regions .",
    "they differ from most later - type spirals in their higher ( on average ) bulge luminosities , the low contrast or even total lack of their spiral arms , the very low surface density of gas ( hi ) , and , consequently , their extremely weak star formation .    explaining the observed features of early - type disk galaxies poses a number of problems .",
    "first and foremost , it is unclear whether lenticular galaxies represent a logical extension of the sd ",
    "sa morphological sequence of galaxies , which reflects the conditions for their formation and the nature of their ensuing `` quiescent '' evolution , or whether their peculiarities are caused by their interaction with the environment ( mergers , accretion of small satellites , loss of gas due to the pressure of the external medium ) .    indeed ,",
    "lenticular galaxies include many objects whose structure suggests an appreciable external influence ( e.g. , dynamically and chemically decoupled circumnuclear disks , peculiarities of the radial brightness profile , or peculiar structural features , such as polar rings ) .",
    "s0 galaxies in rich clusters appear to form as a result of the direct effect of the intergalactic gas on the interstellar medium , directly or indirectly leading to a reduction in the amount of gas and a `` halt '' of active star formation .",
    "environmental effects evidently play a key role in this case , as is demonstrated by the lower percentage of early galaxies in distant clusters ( the butcher  oemler effect [ 1 , 2 ] ) , and the lower contemporary rates of the current star formation in galaxies located in denser environments  [ 6 ] .",
    "however , early - type galaxies also include quite a few field galaxies , which may have different histories .",
    "the problem of the gas content in lenticular galaxies is equally interesting . even when hi is present in detectable amounts , its total mass is at least an order of magnitude lower than would be expected to result from a simple return to the interstellar medium of gas ejected by evolved disk stars  [ 4 ] .",
    "the scarcity of data on the thickness of the stellar disks in lenticular galaxies makes it difficult to compare them with other galaxies in terms of the volume gas density or the gas pressure in the disk plane .",
    "the relative mass fraction of the dark halos in early disk galaxies also remains an open question .",
    "this is due , first and foremost , to difficulties in estimating rotation curves at large galactocentric distances based on stellar absorption lines .",
    "fairly extended hi rotation curves have been obtained for a small number of lenticular galaxies . according to noordermeer  [ 5 ] and noordermeer et al .  [ 6 ] , the rotational velocities in these galaxies often decrease toward the periphery , but they still imply the presence of fairly massive dark halos .",
    "the large scatter of data in the tullyfisher relation ( luminosity  rotation velocity diagram ) for lenticular galaxies suggests substantial inhomogeneity of their properties ( see , e.g. ,  [ 7 ] and references therein ) .",
    "it also follows from the analysis of the velocity dispersions of old stars in the galaxy disks , which shows that in some early - type disk galaxies , the stellar velocity dispersion substantially exceeds the minimum level required for the gravitational stability of the disk , whereas , in later - type spiral galaxies , the velocity dispersion of the disk stars usually appears to be close to its threshold value  [ 8 ] . however , the relatively low accuracy of the estimated velocity dispersions for disk stars beyond the bright bulges and problems with decomposing the velocity dispersion into @xmath1 , and @xmath2 components lead us to treat this conclusion as being tentative .    a comparison of the observational data with dynamical models in which the velocity dispersion of the disk stars  both in the plane of the disk and perpendicular to this plane  is close to the critical values for the dynamical stability of the disk provides insight into its dynamical evolution .",
    "a comparison of model ( @xmath3 ) and observed ( @xmath4 ) line - of - sight velocity dispersions for old disk stars can reveal one of three possible situations .",
    "\\(1 ) @xmath5 .",
    "if interpreted in terms of disk stability , it would imply that the mass of the disk adopted in the model is overestimated , and that the disk must be `` less massive '' in order to satisfy the conditions of dynamical stability against perturbations in the plane of the disk and against bending perturbations .",
    "\\(2 ) @xmath6 within the measurement errors . in this case",
    ", it appears that dynamical instabilities during the formation of the bulk of the disk mass have brought the stellar disk to a marginally stable state , where the stellar velocity dispersion is determined by the surface density of the disk , its rotational velocity as a function of galactocentric distance @xmath7 , and its internal structure .",
    "this appears to be the most common case among noninteracting spiral galaxies .",
    "\\(3 ) @xmath8 ; i.e. , the observed stellar velocity dispersion exceeds the model values corresponding to marginal disk stability . in this case , there is reason to believe that disk stars have acquired an excess ( i.e. , above the level required for stability of the disk ) energy of random motions during their evolution , so that the disk has become overheated .",
    "this can be viewed as evidence that the stellar population of the disk subsystem of the galaxy has been subject to strong gravitational perturbations , for example , as a result of mergers of massive stellar or gaseous satellites , or of close interactions with nearby neighbors . in principle",
    ", the dynamical heating in the inner part of the galaxy can also be related to the disruption of a high - contrast stellar bar .",
    "constructing dynamical galaxy models that can yield estimates of the disk - to - halo mass ratio or disk thickness requires estimates of the rotation velocity and stellar velocity dispersion at the largest possible galactocentric distances , preferably along the main axes of the galaxy , to make it possible to determine the velocity dispersion along both the radial and vertical directions .    in this paper , we describe spectroscopic observations and the results of our construction of dynamical models for four early - type disk galaxies .",
    "table  1 lists the basic parameters of these galaxies we have adopted .",
    "figure  1 shows images of two of the galaxies with low - contrast structure taken with the 6-m telescope of the special astrophysical observatory of the russian academy of sciences .",
    "table  2 gives a log of the observations .",
    "the galaxy luminosities in table  1 correspond to the total @xmath9 magnitudes from the database [ 11 ] .",
    "the last column gives the radius of the exponential stellar disk @xmath10 which was adopted in galaxy models .",
    "this radius corresponds to the isophotal radius @xmath11 , or the radius beyond which the photometric profile steepens .",
    "* ngc  1167 . *",
    "this galaxy contains a substantial amount of hi . according to the observations of noordermeer et al .",
    "[ 14 ] , the total hi mass is @xmath12  @xmath13 , but the gas is distributed over a very large area , so that the average surface density @xmath14 within the optical radius @xmath15 is less than @xmath16  @xmath17pc@xmath18 .",
    "the gas density remains below the critical value required for gravitational instability of the gaseous layer at all galactocentric distances @xmath7 , explaining the lack of observed star - forming regions in the galaxy .",
    "hi observations show an extended rotation curve , which slowly decreases after reaching its maximum and extends over 10 radial disk scales [ 5 ,  6 ] .",
    "the maximum rotational velocity of the disk is almost 400  km / s , making this one of the most rapidly rotating and massive disk galaxies known .",
    "the total bulge luminosity of this galaxy is about one - third of the disk luminosity  [ 15 ] . the bulge has a steep photometric profile ( our @xmath19-band measurements yield a sersic parameter of @xmath20 ) so that its brightness dominates the central region , which has a size of several kpc .",
    "starting from @xmath21 ( @xmath22  kpc ) , the photometric profile becomes exponential , and hence the bulge s contribution to the observed brightness becomes small .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "* dynamical state of the disk . * of the four galaxies considered , the observed parameters of only one  the sba galaxy ngc  2273are consistent with the hypothesis that the stellar disk was not subject to dynamical heating , with the stellar velocity dispersion corresponding to the minimum level sufficient to maintain a quasi - stationary equilibrium state . in this respect , ngc  2273 resembles many later - type spiral galaxies , whose stellar velocity dispersions are close to their threshold levels throughout a considerable fraction of the disk ( see , e.g. , [ 8 , 22 , 36 , 37 ] ) .",
    "the disks in the other three ( lenticular ) galaxies are `` hotter '' even for the maximum allowed mass .",
    "this can be viewed as evidence that these galaxies were subject to external gravitational perturbations in the past , most likely as a result of close interactions with nearby galaxies or mergers of fairly large satellites .",
    "numerical simulations ( see , e.g. , [ 38 ] ) confirm the efficiency of the latter process .",
    "gravitational perturbations of the gaseous component of the disk can also explain why these galaxies have rapidly exhausted their interstellar - gas reserves due to a burst of star formation , thereby acquiring the properties characteristic of lenticular systems .    * estimates of @xmath23 , @xmath24 and the thickness of the stellar disk .",
    "* in a disk that is stable against bending perturbations , perturbations in its plane due , e.g. , to stochastic spiral arms , would primarily increase @xmath25 , and hence decrease @xmath26 .",
    "merging of satellites and their passage across the disk should result in a more isotropic distribution of the velocity dispersion . in this case",
    ", heating occurs mostly via bending perturbations of the disk ( see ardi et  al . [",
    "38 ] for the discussion of this issue ) .",
    "for all four galaxies , the velocity - dispersion components @xmath27 and @xmath25 and their ratio @xmath28 calculated in the marginal - disk model ( fig .",
    "8) decrease with galactocentric distance .",
    "note that @xmath27 does not decrease rapidly enough to keep the marginally stable disk thickness constant : it increases with @xmath7 in all cases . the same is true for the measured stellar velocity dispersions in the galaxies , although the insufficient accuracy of the velocity - dispersion estimates prevented us from reconstructing the detailed behavior of the radial variation of @xmath28 from the observations .",
    "however , we estimated the average @xmath29 values by analyzing the variation of the velocity dispersion along the major and minor axes for three of the four galaxies observed ",
    "ngc  1167 , ngc  2273 , and ngc  4150 .",
    "we found this ratio to be 0.60.8 in the interval ( 12)@xmath30 for all three galaxies , and to decrease to 0.40.5 at ( 2.53)@xmath30 ( for ngc  2273 and ngc  4150 ) .",
    "in numerical simulations for maximum - disk models at the gravitational stability limit . ]    table  3 lists the average disk half - thicknesses @xmath31 within the maximum galactocentric radius covered by the observations for the galaxies considered .",
    "we calculated these half - thicknesses for the inferred @xmath27 and vertical density profile @xmath32 .",
    "in all cases , the disks turned out to be thicker than the disk of the milky way .",
    "the average @xmath31 estimate for ngc  4150 should not be taken at face value , it reduces to a half the tabulated value in the inner region of the galaxy [ ( 11.5)@xmath30 ] ( see previous section ) .",
    "the disk of this galaxy is very `` chubby , '' strongly widens with @xmath7 , so that it grades into the halo at a distance of several radial disk scales .",
    "note that the inferred @xmath31 values are fairly typical for the thick disks of spiral galaxies , where they coexist with more massive thin disks of galaxies like those observed in the hubble space telescope ultra deep field in early stages of their formation  [ 39 ] .",
    "* estimates of the masses of the disks and halos .",
    "* table  3 lists estimates of the masses of these two main components of the disk galaxies and the mass - to - luminosity ratio for the stellar disk found for the maximum - disk model .",
    "it is evident from the estimates obtained that the mass of the dark halo is fairly high , even when calculated in the maximum - disk model : the ratio of the halo mass to the total mass of the stellar components ( disk  @xmath34  bulge ) within the photometric radius is equal to 0.50.8 . similar or even higher ratios",
    "are also observed in later - type galaxies  [ 29 , 40 ] .",
    "thus , lenticular galaxies do not differ strongly from galaxies of other types in terms of their dark - mass content .",
    "the mass - to - luminosity ratio @xmath35 for the disks of the four galaxies are several solar units , which , at least for three of these objects ( all except ngc  4150 ) , is quite consistent with the ratio expected for the old stellar population . for ngc  4150 , @xmath36 in solar units .",
    "although this ratio was inferred for a model with the maximum disk mass , it is a factor of two to three lower than expected for the othergalaxies .",
    "it is unclear why the @xmath35 ratio is so low ; such values are rarely found in galaxies dominated by their old stellar population .",
    "either the disk of this galaxy is deficient in low - mass stars ( due to a shallow initial mass function ) , or the adopted model underestimates the disk mass , e.g. , due to an overestimation of the inclination @xmath37 .",
    "however , the latter possibility is unlikely , since the inclination is fairly large ( 56@xmath38 ) , if our initial assumption that the structure of the disk is axisymmetric is correct .",
    "recall that ngc  4150 ranks well below the other three galaxies in terms of its luminosity , mass ( by about an order of magnitude ) , and size .",
    "the stellar disk of this galaxy appears to have a low volume density .",
    "the formation history and evolution of the disk in this case may have differed from those for the disks in the other more massive galaxies .",
