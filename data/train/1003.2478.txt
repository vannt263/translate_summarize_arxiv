    "the exchange anisotropy , first reported by meiklejohn and bean@xcite for surface - oxidized co nanoparticles , is manifested by a horizontal shift in the hysteresis loop of magnetic systems in contact with an antiferromagnet , an interface phenomenon explained by exchange coupling between the spins at the interface between the two materials.@xcite although studied for many decades now , a full understanding of exchange bias at the microscopic level remains challenging,@xcite largely because of the difficulty in resolving the interface spin and the electronic structure between the two materials .",
    "several microscopic models have been proposed to explain the exchange anisotropy and the small exchange bias observed experimentally _ vis  vis _ the strength of the spin - spin exchange coupling .",
