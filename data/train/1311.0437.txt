    "the type ia supernovae and cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) @xcite observations indicate that our universe is presently accelerating .",
    "this acceleration is caused by some unknown matter which has the property that positive energy density and negative pressure is dubbed as `` dark energy '' ( de ) .",
    "observations indicate that dark energy occupies about 70% of the total energy of the universe , and the contribution of dark matter is @xmath3 26% .",
    "recent wmap data analysis @xcite also give us the confirmation of this acceleration .",
    "although a long - time debate has been done on this well - reputed and interesting issue of modern cosmology , we still have little knowledge about de . the most appealing and simplest candidate for de",
    "is the cosmological constant @xmath4 . over the past decade",
    "there have been many theoretical models for mimicking the dark energy behaviors , such as @xmath4cdm , containing a mixture of cosmological constant @xmath4 and cold dark matter ( cdm ) .",
    "however , two problems arise from this scenario , namely `` fine - tuning '' and the `` cosmic coincidence '' problems . in order to solve these two problems , many dynamical de theoretical models",
    "have been proposed @xcite .",
    "the scalar field or quintessence @xcite is one of the most favored candidate of de which produce sufficient negative pressure to drive acceleration .",
    "+ in recent times , considerable interest has been stimulated in explaining the observed dark energy by the _ holographic dark energy _",
    "( hde ) model @xcite .",
    "an approach to the problem of this dark energy arises from the holographic principle @xcite . for an effective field theory in a box size @xmath5 with uv cutoff @xmath6 , the entropy @xmath7 . taking the whole universe into account the largest ir cut - off @xmath5",
    "is chosen by saturating the inequality so that we get the holographic dark energy density as @xcite in the form @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a numerical constant and @xmath10 is the reduced planck mass .",
    "the most natural choice of @xmath5 is the hubble horizon @xmath11 .",
    "however , hsu @xcite and li @xcite pointed out that in this case the eos of holographic dark energy is zero and the expansion of the universe can not be accelerated .",
    "the next choice of @xmath5 is the particle horizon .",
    "unfortunately , in this case , the eos of hde is always larger than @xmath12 and the expansion of the universe also can not be accelerated .",
    "finally , li @xcite found out that @xmath5 might be the future event horizon of the universe .",
    "on the basis of the holographic principle , several others have studied holographic model for dark energy @xcite . obviously , in the derivation of hde , the black hole ( bh ) entropy @xmath13 plays an important role .",
    "usually , we know that @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the area of bh horizon . due to thermal equilibrium fluctuation , quantum fluctuation , or mass and charge fluctuations , the bh entropy - area relation has been modified in loop quantum gravity ( lqg ) in the form @xcite @xmath16 , where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are dimensionless constants of order unity .",
    "recently , motivated by this corrected entropy - area relation in the setup of lqg , the energy density of the entropy - corrected hde ( echde ) was proposed by wei @xcite and also details discussed in @xcite .",
    "+ based on principle of quantum gravity , cai @xcite proposed a new dark energy model based on the energy density .",
    "the energy density of metric fluctuations of minkowski - spacetime is given by @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "as the most natural choice , the time scale @xmath20 is chosen to be the age of our universe , @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the scale factor of our universe and @xmath23 is the hubble parameter .",
    "therefore , the dark energy is called _ agegraphic dark energy _ ( ade ) @xcite .",
    "the energy density of agegraphic dark energy is given by @xmath24 , where the numerical factor @xmath25 is introduced to parameterize some uncertainties , such as the species of quantum fields in the universe .",
    "since the original ade model suffers from the difficulty to describe the matter - dominated epoch , so wei and cai @xcite have chosen the time scale @xmath20 to be the conformal time @xmath26 instead of @xmath27 , which is defined by @xmath28 ( where @xmath29 is the cosmic time ) , the energy density is obtained as @xmath30 , which is called _ new agegraphic dark energy _ ( nade ) model @xcite .",
    "it was found that the coincidence problem could be solved naturally in the nade model .",
    "the ade models have given rise to a lot of interest recently and have been examined and studied in details in @xcite .",
    "recently , very similar to the echde model , the energy density of the entropy - corrected nade ( ecnade ) was proposed by wei @xcite and investigated in details for acceleration of the universe @xcite . +",
    "another approach to explore the accelerated expansion of the universe is the modified theories of gravity . in this case cosmic acceleration",
    "would arise not from dark energy as a substance but rather from the dynamics of modified gravity @xcite .",
    "modified gravity constitutes an interesting dynamical alternative to @xmath4cdm cosmology .",
    "the simplest modified gravity is dgp brane - world model @xcite .",
    "the other alternative is @xmath31 gravity @xcite where the einstein - hilbert action has been modified .",
    "other modified gravity includes @xmath32 gravity , @xmath33 gravity , gauss - bonnet gravity , horava - lifshitz gravity , brans - dicke gravity , etc @xcite .",
    "+ here we have assumed other type of modified gravity developed by jacobson et al @xcite , known as _ einstein - aether _ theory .",
    "zlosnik et al @xcite has proposed the generalization of einstein - aether theory .",
    "these years a lot of work has been done in generalized einstein - aether theories @xcite . in the generalized einstein - aether theories by taking a special form of the lagrangian density of aether field ,",
    "the possibility of einstein - aether theory as an alternative to dark energy model is discussed in detail , that is , taking a special aether field as a dark energy candidate and it has been found the constraints from observational data @xcite .",
    "meng et al @xcite have shown that only einstein - aether gravity may be generated dark energy , which caused the acceleration of the universe .",
    "+ recently the reconstruction procedure or correspondences between various dark energy models became very challenging subject in cosmological phenomena .",
    "correspondence between different de models , reconstruction of de / gravity and their cosmological implications have been discussed by several authors @xcite .",
    "we shall reconstruct of einstein - aether gravity model with hde and nade separately .",
    "for this purpose , we first briefly discuss the einstein - aether gravity theory by modification of einstein - hilbert action in section ii .",
    "we find the modified friedmann equations and then from the equations we find the effective density and pressure for einstein - aether gravity sector .",
    "these can be treated as dark energy provided some restrictions on the free function @xmath0 .",
    "assuming two types of the power law solutions of the scale factor , we can reconstruct the unknown function @xmath0 from hde and nade and their entropy - corrected versions ( echde and ecnade ) in section iii . finally , we give some cosmological implications of the reconstructed models in section iv .",
    "einstein - aether theory is the extension of general relativity ( gr ) that incorporates a dynamical unit timelike vector field ( i.e. , aether ) coupling with the metric . the action of the einstein - aether gravity theory with the normal einstein - hilbert part action can be written in the form @xcite @xmath34\\ ] ]    where @xmath35 is the lagrangian density for vector field and @xmath36 denotes the lagrangian density for matter field . the lagrangian density for the vector field @xcite is given by @xmath37 @xmath38 @xmath39    where @xmath40 are dimensionless constants , @xmath41 is the coupling constant , @xmath42 is a lagrangian multiplier , @xmath43 is a contravariant vector and @xmath0 ia an arbitrary function of @xmath1 . from ( 1 ) , we get the einstein s field equations @xmath44 @xmath45 where @xmath46 here @xmath47 is the energy momentum tensor for matter and @xmath48 is the energy momentum tensor for the vector field given as follows : @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are respectively the energy density and pressure of matter and @xmath52 is the fluid 4-velocity vector and @xmath53-y_{(ab)}f'+\\frac{1}{2}~g_{ab}m^{2}f+\\lambda a_{a}a_{b}\\ ] ] with @xmath54\\ ] ] where the subscript @xmath55 means symmetric with respect to the indices and @xmath56 is time - like unit vector . + we consider the friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) metric of the universe as @xmath57\\ ] ] where @xmath58 is the curvature scalar and @xmath59 is the scale factor . from equations ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) ,",
    "we get @xmath60 where @xmath61 is constant . from eq . ( 5 ) , we get the modified friedmann equation for einstein - aether gravity as in the following : @xmath62 and @xmath63 where @xmath64 is hubble parameter .",
    "also the conservation equation is given by @xmath65    let @xmath66 and @xmath67 be the effective energy density and pressure governed by the einstein - aether gravity , then we may write the equations ( 13 ) and ( 14 ) in the following form : @xmath68 and @xmath69 and hence we obtain @xmath70 and @xmath71    the equation of state ( eos ) parameter due to the einstein - aether contribution is given by @xmath72    since density is always positive , so @xmath73 implies @xmath74  , where we assume @xmath75 .",
    "the effective density and pressure governed by einstein - aether gravity generate dark energy if @xmath76 ( i.e. , strong energy condition violates ) , which provides the condition @xmath77 .",
    "since einstein - aether theory is the modified gravity theory and this may generate dark energy .",
    "so this gravity can be corresponds with other well - known dark energy models .",
    "for this purpose , we consider the dark energy models which are holographic dark energy ( hde ) and new agegraphic dark energy ( nade ) and their entropy - corrected versions ( echde and ecnade ) .",
    "the einstein - aether gravity sector contains a function @xmath0 , so equating the density with the dark energy models , we can find @xmath0 .",
    "so @xmath0 can be constructed from the dark energy models . for reconstruction of @xmath0 in terms of @xmath1 , we need to know the form of scale factor @xmath59 . for this purpose , we assume two types of power - law forms of @xmath59 @xcite for providing the acceleration of the universe and we reconstruct the einstein - aether gravity according to the hde , echde , nade and ecnade models : + ( i ) * type i : * @xmath78 , where the constant @xmath79 represents the present - day value of the scale factor @xcite . with this choice of scale factor",

    "<S> here we briefly discuss the einstein - aether gravity theory by modification of einstein - hilbert action . </S>",
    "<S> we find the modified friedmann equations and then from the equations we find the effective density and pressure for einstein - aether gravity sector . </S>",
    "<S> these can be treated as dark energy provided some restrictions on the free function @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is proportional to @xmath2 . assuming two types of the power law solutions of the scale factor , we have reconstructed the unknown function @xmath0 from hde and nade and their entropy - corrected versions ( echde and ecnade ) . </S>",
    "<S> we also obtain the eos parameter for einstein - aether gravity dark energy . </S>",
    "<S> for hde and nade , we have shown that the type i scale factor generates the quintessence scenario only and type ii scale factor generates phantom scenario . </S>",
    "<S> but for echde and ecnade , the both types of scale factors can accommodate the transition from quintessence to phantom stages i.e. , phantom crossing is possible for entropy corrected terms of hde and nade models . finally , we show that the models are classically unstable . </S>"
