    "the two - dimensional ( 2d ) xy model shows a unique phase transition , the kosterlitz - thouless ( kt ) transition @xcite .",
    "it does not have a true long - range order , but the correlation function decays as a power of the distance at all the temperatures below the kt transition point .",
    "et al _ @xcite studied the effect of the @xmath0-fold symmetry - breaking fields on the 2d xy model ; this is essentially the same as treating the @xmath0-state clock model , where only the discrete values are allowed for the angle @xmath8 of the xy spins such that @xmath9 in the limit @xmath10 we get the xy model .",
    "it was shown that the 2d @xmath0-state clock model has two phase transitions of the kt type at @xmath7 and @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) for @xmath13 .",
    "there is an intermediate xy - like phase between a low - temperature ordered phase ( @xmath14 ) and a high - temperature disordered phase ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "it was predicted that the decay critical exponent @xmath2 varies from @xmath16 at @xmath11 to @xmath17 at @xmath7 .    most of the above theoretical analyses relied on the renormalization group argument , and they are not exact .",
    "there have been extensive numerical studies on the 2d classical xy model @xcite .",
    "in contrast , only a limited number of numerical works have been reported on the @xmath0-state clock model @xcite , and the accuracy was not good enough especially for the low - temperature phase transition .",
    "there have been no systematic studies to check the prediction of @xmath18 .    in numerical studies ,",
    "efficient algorithms are important for getting the necessary information .",
    "the cluster update algorithms of the monte carlo simulation @xcite are examples of such efforts , and they are useful for overcoming the problems of slow dynamics .",
    "recently we proposed an effective cluster algorithm , which is called the probability - changing cluster ( pcc ) algorithm , of tuning the critical point automatically @xcite .",
    "it is an extension of the swendsen - wang algorithm @xcite , but we change the probability of cluster update ( essentially , the temperature ) depending on the observation whether clusters are percolating or not percolating .",
    "we showed the effectiveness of the pcc algorithm for the potts models @xcite , determining the critical point and critical exponents for the second - order phase transition precisely with less numerical efforts .",
    "the pcc algorithm was also applied to the 2d site - diluted ising model , where the crossover and the self - averaging properties were studied @xcite .",
    "the advantage of using the pcc algorithm in the study of random systems is as follows : the sample - dependent @xmath19 for the finite system with the linear size @xmath20 is important for taking sample average , and the pcc algorithm is suitable for getting the sample - dependent @xmath19 .",
    "there are a lot of interesting questions about the extension of the pcc algorithm .",
    "( i ) can the pcc algorithm be used for the problem of the vector order parameter , such as the xy model ?",
    "( ii ) can it be applied to the analysis of the transition of the kt type ? ( iii ) can it work even if the system shows two or more phase transitions ?",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to answer these questions .",
    "we extend the pcc algorithm so as to treat systems with the vector order parameter .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we formulate the extension of the pcc algorithm for the vector order parameter . in sec .",
    "iii , the kt transition of the 2d xy model is studied with the finite - size scaling ( fss ) analysis based on the kt form of the correlation length . in sec .",
    "iv , we study the kt transitions of the 2d clock models .",
    "we investigate both phase transitions at @xmath7 and @xmath11 for the @xmath5 clock models .",
    "the summary and discussions are given in sec .",
    "our hamiltonian is given by @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a planar unit vector , @xmath23 , at site @xmath24 ; @xmath8 takes the value of @xmath25 for the xy model , and the value given in eq .",
    "( [ theta ] ) for the @xmath0-state clock model .",
    "the summation is taken over the nearest - neighbor pairs @xmath26 .    in order to extend the pcc algorithm to systems with the vector order parameter , we use wolff s idea of the embedded cluster formalism @xcite .",
    "we project the vector @xmath22 onto a randomly chosen unit vector @xmath27 and another unit vector @xmath28 , perpendicular to @xmath27 , as @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the angle measured from the axis of the vector @xmath27 .",
    "then , the hamiltonian , eq .",
    "( [ h_xy ] ) , is rewritten as @xmath31 with positive effective couplings @xmath32 for two sets of ising variables @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "formally , we can restrict ourselves to the region @xmath35 for @xmath36 , and we write the partition function as @xmath37 with @xmath38 .",
    "then , we can use the kasteleyn - fortuin ( kf ) cluster representation for the ising spins @xcite . to make the kf cluster ,",
    "we connect the bonds of parallel ising spins with the probability @xmath39 in the pcc algorithm @xcite , the cluster representation of the ising model is used in two ways .",
    "first , we flip all the spins on any kf cluster to one of two states , that is , @xmath40 or @xmath41 , as in the swendsen - wang algorithm @xcite .",
    "second , we change the kf probability , eq .  ( [ kf_p ] ) , depending on the observation whether clusters are percolating or not .",
    "it is based on the fact that the spin - spin correlation function @xmath42 becomes nonzero for @xmath43 at the same point as the percolation threshold .",
    "for the xy model in the embedded cluster formalism , the spin - spin correlation function is written as @xmath44 where @xmath45 represent the thermal average .",
    "the function @xmath46 is equal to 1 ( 0 ) if the sites @xmath24 and @xmath47 belong to the same ( different ) cluster , and @xmath48 and @xmath49 are some constants .",
    "thus , the system is regarded as percolating if @xmath50 _ or _ @xmath51 ising spins are percolating . when treating the cluster spin update",
    ", one may consider ising spins of a single type projected onto a randomly chosen axis , as in the original wolff s proposal @xcite .",
    "however , we should consider ising spins of both types perpendicular to each other for checking the percolation .",
    "the procedure of monte carlo spin update is as follows : ( i ) start from some spin configuration and some value of @xmath52 .",
    "( ii ) choose a unit vector @xmath27 randomly .",
    "( iii ) construct the kf clusters for @xmath50 and @xmath51 using the probability , eq .",
    "( [ kf_p ] ) , and check whether the system is percolating or not .",
    "flip all the spins on any kf cluster to @xmath40 or @xmath41 for both @xmath50 and @xmath51 ising spins .",
    "( iv ) if the system is percolating ( not percolating ) , decrease ( increase ) @xmath52 by @xmath53 .",
    "( v ) go back to the process ii .    as @xmath54 becomes small ,",
    "the distribution of @xmath52 becomes a sharp gaussian distribution around the mean value @xmath55 , which depends on the system size @xmath20 .",
    "we approach the canonical ensemble in this limit , and the existence probability @xmath56 , the probability that the system percolates , becomes 1/2 at @xmath55 .",
    "we have made simulations for the classical xy model on the square lattice with the system sizes @xmath20 = 8 , 16 , 32 , 64 , 128 , 256 , and 512 .",
    "after 20,000 monte carlo sweeps of determining @xmath55 with gradually reducing @xmath54 , we have made 10,000 monte carlo sweeps to take the thermal average ; we have made 100 runs for each size to get better statistics and to evaluate the statistical errors .",
    "as for the criterion to determine percolating , we have employed the topological rule @xcite in the present study .",
    "the topological rule is that some cluster winds around the system in at least one of the @xmath57 directions in @xmath57-dimensional systems .",
    "let us start with the size dependence of the transition temperature .",
    "we use the fss analysis based on the kt form of the correlation length , @xmath58 with @xmath59 . using the pcc algorithm",
    ", we locate the temperature @xmath60 that the existence probability @xmath56 is 1/2 .",
    "then , using the fss form of @xmath56 , that is , @xmath61 , we have the relation @xmath62 we plot @xmath63 as a function of @xmath64 with @xmath65 for the best fitted parameters in fig .  [ fig_1 ] .",
    "we represent the temperature in units of @xmath66 .",
    "the error bars are smaller than the size of marks .",
    "our estimate of @xmath67 is 0.8933(6 ) ; the number in the parentheses denotes the uncertainty in the last digits .",
    "we have estimated the uncertainty by the @xmath68 test of the data for 100 samples .",
    "this value is consistent with the estimates of recent studies ; 0.89213(10 ) by the monte carlo simulation @xcite , and 0.894 by the short - time dynamics @xcite . the constant @xmath69 , in eq .",
    "( [ t_kt ] ) , is estimated as @xmath69=1.73(2 ) .",
    "let us consider the magnetization @xmath70 at @xmath63 to discuss the critical exponent @xmath2 . in fig .",
    "[ fig_2 ] , we plot @xmath70 as a function of @xmath20 in logarithmic scale .",
    "we expect the fss of the form @xmath71 , but there are small corrections .",
    "the importance of the multiplicative logarithmic corrections were pointed out @xcite . using the form",
    "@xmath72 we obtain @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "we show the fitting curve obtained by using eq .",
    "( [ eta_1 ] ) in fig .",
    "[ fig_2 ] .",
    "this value of @xmath2 is a little bit smaller than the theoretical prediction , 1/4 ( = 0.25 ) .",
    "our logarithmic - correction exponent @xmath75 is compatible with janke s result @xmath76 for thermodynamic data @xcite , but different from the theoretical prediction @xmath77 @xcite .",
    "next turn to the @xmath0-state clock model .",
    "because of the reflection symmetry , we confine ourselves to the case of even @xmath0 .",
    "then , the same procedure can be used as the xy model .",
    "one thing we should have in mind is that the axis of the vector @xmath27 should be chosen from one of @xmath0 directions in eq .",
    "( [ theta ] ) or the middle of two of them .",
    "we plot the high - temperature transition temperature @xmath78 of the 6-state clock model as a function of @xmath64 in fig .",
    "[ fig_3 ] .",
    "the estimate of @xmath11 is 0.9008(6 ) , which is more precise than the previous estimates ; 0.92(1 ) @xcite and 0.90 @xcite .",
    "the plot of @xmath70 at @xmath78 as a function of @xmath20 for the 6-state clock model is given in fig .",
    "[ fig_4 ] .",
    "the estimate of @xmath2 is 0.243(5 ) by the analysis of the multiplicative logarithmic corrections , eq .",
    "( [ eta_1 ] ) , and the exponent @xmath75 is estimated as 0.037(5 ) .",
    "for the second - order transition , the curves of the existence probability @xmath56 of different sizes cross at @xmath79 as far as the corrections to fss are negligible ; this is the same as the behavior of the binder ratio @xcite . for the kt transition",
    ", however , @xmath67 is not the crossing point but the spray - out point .",
    "therefore , @xmath11 can be searched only from the high - temperature side , and @xmath7 only from the low - temperature side .",
    "the value of @xmath56 at @xmath7 is close to 1 . in principle",
    ", we can use the same procedure as the study of @xmath11 ; we may change the setting value of @xmath56 , 1/2 , to a higher one by introducing a biased random walk . however , it is difficult to resolve the size dependence for lower temperatures . therefore , we employ a slightly different approach for the analysis of the phase transition at @xmath7 .",
    "when judging whether clusters are percolating or not , we consider another type of clusters . instead of choosing the vector @xmath27 randomly in eq .",
    "( [ project ] ) , we choose the vector @xmath27 as @xmath80 with @xmath81 , or more generally we may choose @xmath27 such that @xmath82 with some fixed angle @xmath83 . with this choice , the existence probability for the percolation of only @xmath50 ( or @xmath51 ) ising spins holds the same fss property as the total @xmath56 . as a result , we can control the value of @xmath84 at @xmath7 so as to apply the fss analysis easily with an appropriate @xmath83 .",
    "the low - temperature transition temperature @xmath85 of the 6-state clock model obtained by the above modified approach is plotted as a function of @xmath64 also in fig .",

    "this is the _ first _ systematic report of confirming the theoretical prediction .",
    "to summarize , we have extended the pcc algorithm @xcite to the study of the xy and clock models .",

    "the kt transitions of the 2d xy and clock models are studied by using the fss analysis based on the kt form of the correlation length . for dealing with the low - temperature transition temperature , @xmath7 ,",

    "the present precise numerical results may stimulate the refined renormalization - group study of the kt transitions .    in the previous numerical studies of the kt transitions , one might resort to a big scale calculation using an extensive computer resource @xcite , or one might use some special boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "it is due to the subtlety of the kt phase transitions ; that is , @xmath67 is not the crossing point but the spray - out point of the existence probability or the binder parameter .",
    "moreover , the low - temperature transition @xmath7 for the clock model is difficult to study because the system is nearly ordered ; it is more difficult for larger @xmath0 . we should stress that using the present efficient method of numerical simulation , we have successfully made a systematic study of the xy and clock models with much less efforts .",
    "our formalism of the vector order parameter is easily extended to the general @xmath98 model , where the percolation of @xmath99 types of ising spins will be considered .",
