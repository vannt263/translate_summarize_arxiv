    "the study of radiative rare decays of @xmath1 mesons can provide valuable information on certain parameters in the ckm matrix .",
    "in particular , @xmath0 is thought to be an especially clean mode for extracting the @xmath5 matrix element.@xmath7 although not yet observed , this mode should be accessible for study at b - factories",
    ". however , the smallness of the short - distance @xmath0 amplitude raises the concern that the experimental signal could be influenced by long - distance effects , with the possibility of their contributing a non - negligible fraction to the decay rate .",
    "the first studies@xmath8 of long distance contributions to rare @xmath1 decays employed the vector meson dominance ( vmd ) model ( _ cf _ fig .",
    "as applied to the @xmath0 transition,@xmath9 this involves the decay @xmath10 ( @xmath11 represents an off - shell neutral vector meson such as @xmath12 ) with subsequent conversion of the vector meson to the photon .",
    "more recently , light - cone qcd sum - rules have been used to analyze the weak annihilation long - distance contribution to @xmath0.@xmath13 here , the main effect arises from direct emission of the final state photon from the light spectator quark in the @xmath1 meson followed by @xmath14 weak annihilation .",
    "both these approaches suffer from some degree of theoretical uncertainty . besides the usual model dependence of these methods , in both cases",
    "no allowance is made for final state interactions ( fsi ) .",
    "however , the @xmath15 decay mode can be generated by the decay of a b meson into a hadronic final state which then rescatters into @xmath15 .",
    "it has recently been shown@xmath16 that soft - fsi effects are @xmath17 in the large @xmath18 limit and can not legitimately be ignored .    in this paper",
    ", we provide an estimate of a long distance component to @xmath0 which deals solely with on - shell transition amplitudes while explicitly taking the occurrence of fsi into account .",
    "our mechanism can be viewed as a unitarity analysis , where a @xmath1 decays into some intermediate state which then undergoes soft - rescattering into the final @xmath19 configuration .",
    "of course , we are not able to account for all possible intermediate states , so that in order to provide a rough estimate for the the effect we must analyse a few specific contributions . for definiteness , we consider the @xmath20 and @xmath21 intermediate states in @xmath22 decay . in the language of regge",
    "theory,@xmath23 the first of these proceeds by pomeron exchange and is technically the dominant contribution , remaining nonzero in the heavy quark limit .",
    "however , the @xmath21 contribution , whose rescattering is mediated by the @xmath24 trajectory and is thus nonleading , can be numerically important because @xmath25 is color - allowed ( whereas @xmath26 is color - suppressed ) and because the relatively low value of the @xmath1 mass turns out to blur somewhat the distinction between regge - leading and nonleading contributions .",
    "finally , since the corrections considered here are not themselves proportional to @xmath5 , their presence constitutes a potential source of serious error in the phenomenological extraction of @xmath5.@xmath27 this underscores the importance of obtaining quantitative estimates of such effects .",
    "effects of final state interactions ( _ e.g. _ fig .  1(b ) ) are naturally described using the unitarity property of the @xmath28-matrix , @xmath29 .",
    "this condition implies that the @xmath30-matrix , @xmath31 , obeys @xmath32 = { 1 \\over 2 } \\sum_{i } \\langle f | { \\cal t}^\\dagger |",
    "i \\rangle \\langle i | { \\cal t } | b \\rangle   \\ . \\label{unit}\\ ] ] for the @xmath0 transition the contribution from the @xmath24 intermediate state is the one which is most amenable to direct analysis , and we shall detail the @xmath2 component throughout this paper .- matrix to be unitary , inelastic effects such as diffractive dissociation ( decay of the @xmath1 into a @xmath24 and a jet of particles which recombine into the @xmath19 final state ) or any other intermediate state with suitable quantum numbers must also be present.@xmath16 ] this encompasses the @xmath20 and @xmath34 intermediate states for @xmath22 decay and @xmath35 for @xmath36 decay .    the final state interaction of fig .",
    "1(b ) together with the unitarity condition implies a discontinuity relation for the invariant amplitude @xmath37 , @xmath38 with @xmath39 being the polarization tensors of @xmath24 mesons in the loop .",
    "when expressed in terms of helicity amplitudes , the above discontinuity formula simplifies to @xmath40 the fsi itself will arise from the scattering @xmath41 .",
    "we shall employ the regge - pole description for this rescattering process , requiring both pomeron and @xmath24-trajectory contributions .    to begin , however , we recall from regge phenomenology the well - known invariant amplitude for the scattering of particles with helicities @xmath42,@xmath43 @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 . in the @xmath47 weak decay",
    ", the @xmath48 state can exist in any of three helicity configurations , @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 ( or in obvious notation @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 ) .",
    "moreover , the pomeron ( and near @xmath55 also the leading @xmath24 ) exchange does not change the helicities of the rescattering particles , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath56 . in view of this and noting that the photon helicity must have @xmath57 , we omit the @xmath54 helicity configuration from further consideration .",
    "this is equivalent to maintaining the condition of gauge invariance .",
    "moreover , since parity invariance constrains the @xmath52 and @xmath53 helicity contributions to be equal , we drop the @xmath58 superscript hereafter and take for the residue couplings @xmath59 . throughout",
    "we use the linear trajectory forms , @xmath60    in the following discussion , we limit ourselves for clarity s sake to @xmath4 decay .",

    "such spurious behavior has been well - known since the early days of regge phenomenology and is avoidable by restricting the range of integration to the diffraction peak , by employing a modified ` phenomenological ' amplitude or by invoking daughter trajectories to cancel the divergence .",
    "we adopt the first of these procedures and find @xmath68 where @xmath69  gev . the numerical quantity @xmath70 is defined to encode the strength of the pomeron - mediated rescattering .",
