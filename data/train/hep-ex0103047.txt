    "the spin structure of hadrons has been extensively studied both experimentally and theoretically over the past two decades . measuring parton spin distributions in different octet baryons",
    "can shed light on many phenomena in non - perturbative qcd , such as @xmath4 symmetry breaking , baryon spin content , flavor asymmetry in the baryon sea , which were evoked in connection with the proton spin puzzle  @xcite . despite some achievements in this field , our current knowledge of the nucleon sea - quark spin distributions and",
    "the spin content of the other hyperons is still very poor .",
    "one way to learn about the quark spin distributions of unstable hadrons is to measure the polarized quark fragmentation function @xmath5 of the quark @xmath6 into the hadron @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the fraction of the total hadronic energy carried by the hadron in the laboratory system .    among various hadrons produced in deep inelastic scattering ( dis )",
    "@xmath3 and @xmath0 hyperons are unique because of their parity violating decays into a pair of charged hadrons ( @xmath9 and @xmath10 respectively ) which can be efficiently reconstructed and identified .",
    "the @xmath3 ( @xmath0 ) polarization is measured by the asymmetry in the angular distribution of the protons ( antiprotons ) or pions in the parity violating decay process @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) . in the @xmath3 ( @xmath0 ) rest frame the angular distribution of the decay protons ( pions ) is given by : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the @xmath3 ( @xmath0 ) polarization vector , @xmath13  @xcite is the decay asymmetry parameter and @xmath14 is the unit vector along the direction of the outgoing positive decay particle ( the proton in case of @xmath3 and the @xmath15 in case of @xmath0 ) .    to probe the polarized quark distribution in a hadron @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the standard bjorken variable , a source of polarized quarks is required . of the many means of obtaining polarized quarks  @xcite , neutrino and antineutrino dis",
    "are exceptional due to their 100% natural polarization . moreover ,",
    "weak interactions provide a _ source of polarized quarks of specific flavour _ , which makes the measurement of @xmath3 and @xmath0 polarizations in ( anti)neutrino dis an ideal tool to investigate different spin transfer mechanisms and to check various models of the baryon spin content .",
    "different physical mechanisms are responsible for the @xmath3 and @xmath0 polarization in the fragmentation regions defined by positive and negative values of @xmath18 . a polarization of the strange sea in the nucleon  @xcite can manifest itself through a polarization of @xmath3 and @xmath0 hyperons produced in the target fragmentation region ( @xmath19 ) in ( anti)neutrino dis process .",
    "measurements of the polarization of the @xmath3 and @xmath0 hyperons produced in the current fragmentation region ( @xmath20 ) in ( anti)neutrino dis can provide information on the polarized fragmentation functions of quarks and antiquarks into a given hyperon ( @xmath21 or @xmath0 )  @xcite . the longitudinal polarization of a hyperon @xmath7 produced in neutrino dis in the current fragmentation region , assuming no polarization transfer from the other ( anti)quarks fragmenting into this hyperon , is given by : @xmath22 \\delta d_u^{h}(z ) - ( 1-y_{bj})^2 \\bar u(x_{bj } )    \\left [ \\delta d_{\\bar d}^{h}(z ) + \\omega   \\delta d_{\\bar s}^{h}(z ) \\right ] } { \\left[d(x_{bj } ) + \\omega s(x_{bj})\\right ] d_u^{h}(z ) + ( 1-y_{bj})^2 \\bar u(x_{bj } )   \\left [ d_{\\bar d}^{h}(z ) +   \\omega   d_{\\bar s}^{h}(z ) \\right ] } , \\label{lampolar}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 ( @xmath24 is the cabibbo angle ) . a measurement of the @xmath3 polarization in the current fragmentation region in @xmath25 charged current ( cc ) dis provides an estimate of the spin transfer coefficient @xmath26 because of the dominant contribution from the first term in both the numerator and denominator of eq .",
    "( [ lampolar ] ) .",
    "however an interpretation of the @xmath0 polarization in the current fragmentation region in @xmath27 dis is more complicated since the two terms in both the numerator and denominator of eq .",
    "( [ lampolar ] ) could be of comparable size .    in order to reduce the number of independent fragmentation functions the authors of  @xcite made the following assumptions : @xmath28 and @xmath29 the relations  ( [ symmetry - nonpol ] ) and  ( [ symmetry - pol ] ) simplify the interpretation of the results of the @xmath3 and @xmath0 polarization measurements in ( anti)neutrino dis",
    ". however , these relations may not be valid if a sizable fraction of @xmath3 and @xmath0 hyperons is produced via resonance or heavier hyperon decays .",
    "the nomad experiment  @xcite has collected @xmath30 @xmath1 cc events and has observed an unprecedented number of @xmath3 and @xmath0 decays .",
    "a detailed paper devoted to the @xmath3 polarization measurement in the nomad experiment has been published recently  @xcite .",
    "we present here the first measurement of the polarization of @xmath0 hyperons produced in @xmath1 cc interactions .",
    "the measurement of charged tracks produced in neutrino interactions in the nomad detector is performed with a set of drift chambers  @xcite located inside a dipole magnet with a field of 0.4 tesla .",
    "a @xmath0 decay appears in the detector as a @xmath2-like vertex : two tracks of opposite charge emerging from a common vertex separated from the primary neutrino interaction vertex ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : lambda - antilambda ] ) .",
    "a @xmath2-like signature is expected also for @xmath3 and @xmath31 decays and for photon conversions .",
    "the data are compared to the results of a monte carlo ( mc ) simulation based on lepto 6.1  @xcite and jetset 7.4  @xcite generators for neutrino interactions and on a geant  @xcite based program for the detector response . in our mc simulation @xmath0 hyperons",
    "are not polarized .",
    "the selection procedure for the @xmath27 event sample used in this analysis has been described in  @xcite .",
    "since the nomad detector is unable to distinguish ( anti)protons from pions in the momentum range relevant to this analysis , our @xmath2 identification procedure relies on the kinematic properties of a @xmath2 decay .    for the @xmath2 identification",
    "a kinematic fit method has been used as described in reference  @xcite .",
    "this fit has been performed for three decay hypotheses : @xmath32 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and for the hypothesis of a photon conversion @xmath33 .",
    "the output of the kinematic fits applied to a given @xmath2 vertex consists of four @xmath34 .",
    "the different regions in the four - dimensional @xmath34 space populated by particles identified as @xmath3 , @xmath0 and @xmath31 have been selected .    identified @xmath2 s",
    "are of two types :    * _ uniquely _ identified @xmath2 s , which , in the four - dimensional @xmath34 space described above , populate regions corresponding to the decay of different particles ; * _ ambiguously _ identified @xmath2 s , which populate overlapping kinematic regions where the decays of different particles are simultaneously present .",
    "the treatment of ambiguities aims at selecting a given @xmath2 decay with the highest efficiency and the lowest background contamination from other @xmath2 types .",
    "our identification strategy consists of two steps :    * we select a sample of uniquely identified @xmath0 hyperons which has a purity of 91% ; * we allow ourselves an additional 7% contribution from a subsample of ambiguously identified @xmath0 particles resolving the ambiguities between @xmath0 and @xmath31 in favour of maximal purity .",
    "this approach provides an optimum compromise between high statistics and well understood background contamination .",
    "a mc simulation program has been used to study the purity of the overall @xmath0 sample obtained by our selection criteria in @xmath1 cc interactions .",
    "this study indicates that 89.6% of the selected @xmath2 s are true @xmath0 hyperons , 5.4% are misidentified @xmath31 mesons and 5.0% are due to random track associations . the global reconstruction and",
    "identification efficiency is 18.6% .",
    "a total of 649 identified @xmath0 decays is found in our data , representing a significantly larger number than in previous ( anti)neutrino experiments performed with bubble chambers  @xcite .",
    "[ fig : ident - mass - antilambda ] shows the invariant mass distributions for @xmath35 combinations before and after the @xmath2 identification procedure .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "in our previous publication  @xcite we have reported the measurements of the @xmath3 polarization in @xmath36 dis obtained from a sample of 8087 identified @xmath9 decays .",
    "let us first briefly recall these results .    for the longitudinal polarization we have found :    * in the target fragmentation region @xmath37 .",
    "+ this result is in qualitative agreement with the predictions of the model of negatively polarized @xmath38 pairs in the nucleon  @xcite .",
    "* in the current fragmentation region @xmath39 .",
    "+ this result provides a measure of the spin transfer coefficient @xmath40 ( see eq .",
    "( [ lampolar ] ) ) .    a significant transverse polarization @xmath41 has also been observed .",
    "its dependence on the transverse momentum of the @xmath3 with respect to the hadronic jet direction is in qualitative agreement with the well established behaviour observed in unpolarized hadron - hadron experiments  @xcite .",
    "as shown in table  [ tab : antilambda - numu ] , the observed @xmath0 polarization vector for the full data sample is consistent with zero . if we split the @xmath0 sample into subsamples with @xmath20 and @xmath19 , we still find results consistent with zero .",
    "however , a negative value of @xmath42 , if confirmed , would disagree with the expectations based on calculations  @xcite performed in the framework of the naive quark model , as well as of the burkardt - jaffe  @xcite and the bigi - gustafson - hkkinen models  @xcite .",
    "similarly , a positive value of the @xmath0 longitudinal polarization at @xmath43 , if confirmed , would not be consistent with naive expectations in the framework of the model of negatively polarized @xmath44 pairs in the nucleon  @xcite .",
    "no significant transverse polarization has been found for the @xmath0 sample .    as a cross - check",
    "we have measured the @xmath3 ( @xmath0 ) transverse polarization using a modification of a bias cancelling technique adopted in hadron experiments  @xcite .",
    "we exploit the left - right symmetry of our detector with respect to neutrino beam axis , and separately measure the distributions of eq .",
    "( [ eq : distorted - distr ] ) for events with primary vertex on the left ( l ) or on the right ( r ) of this axis , replacing @xmath45 by @xmath46 for the right half of the detector :    @xmath47    using the fact that @xmath48 , we define an asymmetry @xmath49 which does not depend on the detector acceptance . by fitting @xmath50 to a straight line in @xmath45 we extract the transverse polarization @xmath51 .",
    "all the measurements of the transverse polarization performed with this method are in a good agreement with the results obtained using our standard method for both @xmath3  @xcite and @xmath0  ( table  [ tab : antilambda - numu ] ) samples .",
    "the results of the @xmath0 polarization measurements in @xmath1 cc dis in the nomad experiment have been presented .",
    "a clean @xmath0 sample has been selected on the basis of kinematic fits performed on @xmath2-like decays . the method used to extract the three components of the @xmath0 polarization vector accounts for the smearing of the angular variables .",
    "while the statistics of the @xmath0 sample is limited to 649 events , the @xmath0 polarization has been measured for the first time in a neutrino experiment .",
    "the results for the three components of the @xmath0 polarization vector as measured in the `` j '' reference system are compatible with zero : @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 .",
    "in addition no evidence for the @xmath0 polarization is found either in the current or in the target fragmentation regions .",
    "more precise measurements of the @xmath0 polarization in ( anti)neutrino interactions could help in clarifying the fragmentation and spin transfer mechanisms of quarks and ( anti)quarks into a bound system of antiquarks . improved experimental results on the @xmath0 polarization in @xmath55(@xmath56 ) dis will be hard to obtain before more intense neutrino beams  @xcite become available .",
