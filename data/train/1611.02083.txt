    "empirical data indicates that power - law behavior in the observed probability distribution of interesting quantities is quite frequent in the natural world @xcite .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that one reason for this phenomenon is detector - normalization . in most measurement devices",
    "one finds a pre - processing step that impedes that the device be overwhelmed by data of too large amplitude that might damage he hardware .",
    "one then appeals to statistically normalization of input data .",
    "the data are first centered by subtraction of their estimated mean , and then scaled with their estimated standard deviation .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that the concomitant proceedings transform gaussian input data into q - gaussian output one .",

    "the first instance corresponds to free - particle solutions of the celebrated schrdinger equation , while the second instance corresponds to free particle solutions to its q - nonlinear generalization advanced in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , the so called nrt equation . if we confront a particle flow , which of the two equations is governing it , the linear or the nonlinear one ?    in order to help finding an adequate answer we carefully study here perturbative nrt solutions in a @xmath3 scenario .",
    "we hope that our considerations will shed some light on these matters .",
    "the motivation of this paper resides in the fact that both the q - schrdinger equation and the q - klein - gordon equation are natural manifestations of very high energy phenomena @xcite , as verified by lhc - experiments @xcite , for which @xmath0 is close to unity .",
    "in such a case , the two equations mentioned above approach the customary schrdinger and klein - gordon equations , becoming identical to them in the limit @xmath5 .",

    "as a first task we will prove that the first order taylor expansion , around @xmath2 , of q - exponential function @xmath15 , is a solution of to the non - linear q - schrdinger equation advanced in @xcite @xmath16^q= h_{0}\\left[\\frac{\\psi(x , t)}{\\psi(0,0)}\\right]\\ ] ] @xmath17 a fixed wave function , where @xmath18 in our case : @xmath19 , defined as @xmath20^{\\frac{1}{1-q}}\\ ] ] calling @xmath21 we deal with @xmath22}^{\\frac{1}{1-q}}\\ ] ] the function @xmath15 tends to the usual exponential when @xmath23 @xmath24 we observe that @xmath25 .",

    "we have thus achieved self consistency , which is the first result of the present communication .      in this subsection",
    "we intend making comparisons between the approximate and exact solutions of q - schrdinger equation . to this end",
