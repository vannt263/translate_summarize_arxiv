    "projectile ionization , also referred to as electron loss or stripping , is an important charge - changing process playing a critical role in many applications such as heavy - ion driven inertial fusion , ion - beam lifetimes in accelerators , medical science , material technology and others ( see , e.g. , @xcite ",
    "@xcite ) .    in order to calculate the non - relativistic ionization cross sections for ion - atom collisions a computer code",
    "called loss was developed using the born approximation @xcite with account for the screening as well as antiscreening effects .",
    "non - relativistic schrdinger wave functions are used to describe the electronic structure .",
    "this is a good approximation for the outer shell electrons , which play the dominant role .",
    "relativistic ionization has been pioneered at stanford by anholt and collaborators @xcite and it is reviewed in several books and review articles ( see e.g. , @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "numerical calculations of relativistic ionization cross sections are presented in the literature mainly for ionization of h- and he - like ions from the ground 1s state ( see , e.g. , @xcite - @xcite ) .",
    "recently , two new computer codes loss - r ( relativistic loss ) and herion ( high energy relativistic ionization ) have been developed for calculation of the relativistic ionization cross sections .",
    "the loss - r code @xcite was created on the basis of the non - relativistic loss code @xcite using the relativistic born approximation in the momentum - transfer representation without magnetic interactions .",
    "the herion code @xcite uses the dipole and impulse approximations with relativistic wave functions but it also neglects the magnetic interactions .",
    "it is the aim of the present work to provide a theoretical framework for ionization in relativistic ion - atom collisions with possible account for the magnetic interactions for an arbitrary many - electron ions .",
    "the formulae obtained can be used for projectile ions such as u@xmath2 colliding with the rest - gas atoms and molecules at energies up to a few gev / u .",
    "such heavy many - electron ions are of practical implications for the international fair project at gsi darmstadt @xcite .    in section 2",
    "the main formulae for relativistic ionization are recapitulated , also in order to establish the notation .",
    "numerical results due to the loss - r and herion codes are given in section 3 . in section 4 the non - relativistic reduction of the dirac matrix - elements",
    "an accurate procedure to include the relativistic effects in ionization cross sections using the plane wave born approximation is given in @xcite .",
    "there , the cross section summed over the magnetic quantum numbers and presented in the momentum - transfer @xmath3-representation is given in the form :    @xmath4    where @xmath5 denotes the fine - structure constant , @xmath6 the effective charge of the target atom , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 is the ionization energy . the ion velocity is given by the relativistic factor @xmath9 .",
    "the matrix - elements @xmath10 and @xmath11 are evaluated in a x , y , z coordinate system in which the z - axis lies along the momentum transfer vector @xmath12 .",
    "the x - axis lies in the plane formed by the vectors @xmath12 and the projectile velocity @xmath13 .",
    "they contribute incoherently to the cross section due to different selection rules for the final magnetic substates .",
    "the matrix elements @xmath10 and @xmath11 are given by @xcite @xmath14 @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 denote the wave functions in the initial and final states and @xmath18 the x - component of the dirac matrix vector @xmath19 .",
    "this is a useful splitting : the @xmath10-term tends to a constant for @xmath20 whereas the @xmath11-term increases as @xmath21 due to a contribution of the equivalent photons .",
    "the matrix element @xmath10 is the main term in the non - relativistic ionization , e.g. in the formulae of the loss code @xcite whereas the matrix element @xmath11 appears for relativistic ionization .",
    "the @xmath11-term can be calculated numerically if the dirac wave functions with the large and small components are known .",
    "the equivalent photon approximation can be obtained from eq .",
    "( 1 ) : due to the photon pole , the second term will dominate at high energies . for small @xmath3-values the quantity @xmath22 is directly related to the dipole matrix element : @xmath23 the integral over @xmath3 in eq .",
    "( 1 ) has a dominant contribution at @xmath24 . in the integration over @xmath3",
    ", we may assume that @xmath25 .",
    "then the integral diverges logarithmically at large @xmath3 .",
    "one can introduce a suitable cutoff @xmath26 which corresponds to a cutoff impact parameter @xmath27 in the impact - parameter space . in turn",
    ", the dipole moment determines the photoionization cross section ( see e.g. , @xcite , eq .",
    "( 69.2 ) ) : @xmath28 so the ion - atom ionization cross section can be expressed via a photoionization cross section and the equivalent - photon number .",
    "the pwba ( plane - wave born approximation ) formalism is also used in the calculation of bound - free pair production in antiproton - nucleus collisions ( antihydrogen production ) @xcite and in heavy ion collisions @xcite .",
    "pair production may be viewed as ionization of the negative energy dirac sea . in the pair production process one",
    "has to use dirac wave functions , rather than the schrdinger wave functions .    in @xcite the dipole approximation was realized as a part of the herion code where the dipole part of relativistic ionization cross section of the projectile ion in collision with a neutral atom is expressed via photoionization cross section @xmath29 ( see @xcite ) : @xmath30 where @xmath31 denotes the ionization threshold and @xmath32 the equivalent - photon number    @xmath33,\\,\\ , x = \\frac { \\omega_{min}\\ , b_{min}}{v\\gamma}. \\label{xx}\\ ] ]    where @xmath34 is the mcdonald function .",
    "the parameter @xmath27 is defined by the size of the projectile - ion shell @xmath35 from which ionization occurs and is given with a good accuracy by @xmath36 where @xmath37 = 0.53 @xmath38 cm is the bohr radius , @xmath39 denotes the binding energy of the @xmath35 shell and @xmath40 = 13.606 ev is the rydberg energy unit .",

    "[ f : u28_proton ] .",
    "calculations were performed by the loss - r code including dipole and non - dipole parts of the ionization cross sections and using the non - relativistic wave functions . as seen from the figure , the main contribution to the total cross section",
    "is given by electron ionization from 3@xmath42 , ... , shells which can be described by the non - relativistic wave functions     ions by protons : the loss - r - code @xcite .",
    "contribution of ionization from different subshells of u@xmath2 are shown together with the total cross section.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    a comparison of relativistic ionization cross sections of u@xmath2 ions by proton impact calculated by two different codes , loss - r and herion , is shown in fig .",
    "[ f : u28prot ] where the contributions from dipole- , non - dipole parts are shown together with the total ( dipole + non - dipole ) cross sections . in the loss - r code , the dipole part of the cross sections corresponds to electron transitions into the continuum with the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the angular momentum of the projectile - electron shell .",
    "as seen from the figure , the non - dipole parts calculated by the codes agree within 30 % meanwhile the dipole parts and the total cross sections agree only within a factor of 2 .",
    "most probably , this discrepancy is related to two reasons : first , the use of different wave functions in the codes , i.e. , relativistic wave functions in herion code and and non - relativistic ones in the loss - r code . and",
    "second , in the herion code dipole ionization cross sections are calculated on the basis of photoionization cross sections ; the latter are much higher than those calculated in the usual non - relativistic approximation because of the presence of the so - called giant resonances occurring due to configuration interaction of the final states ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "we note that the dipole part of ionization cross section involves about 60 - 70 % of the total cross section while the relativistic non - dipole part has a weak dependence on energy and , therefore , the dipole part has practically the same shape as the total cross section .",

    "the non - relativistic result ( loss ) shows a born maximum followed by a decrease of the cross section .",
    "the relativistic result ( loss - r ) has a local minimum around 1 gev / u energy and increases logarithmically with energy .",

    "now we consider the non - relativistic limit of the matrix - element g given by eq .",
    "( [ g ] ) : @xmath50 the operator @xmath51 is an odd one and connects the large and small components of the dirac wave function .",
    "it gives zero if one only uses the large components .",
    "the non - relativistic limit of @xmath22 is given in @xcite in the form : @xmath52 where @xmath53 .",
    "this operator acts only on the large component of the dirac wave function .",
    "we use the relations @xmath54 and @xmath55 , ( see @xcite , p. 891 ) to obtain @xmath56 using the identity @xmath57 ( see e.g. eq . xiii.83 of @xcite ) with @xmath58 and with @xmath59 we find @xmath60 the spin - flip terms are given by @xmath61 in the following , we neglect the spin - flip terms because they are small in our case , see also @xcite ) .",
    "so the non - relativistic limit of the odd operator @xmath62 is @xmath63 this result can be also obtained directly using the electromagnetic - current approach in the schrdinger theory ( see , e.g. , @xcite , chapter @xmath64 ) .",
    "the spin - flip terms appear in the pauli approximation , which can be obtained from the dirac equation .",
    "the matrix element @xmath22 becomes @xmath65 here @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "the derivative @xmath68 is easier to calculate in spherical coordinates rather than @xmath69 , so we rotate the coordinate system by @xmath70 around the y - axis .",
    "this changes @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "so we have @xmath73 actually we only need the absolute square of the function @xmath11 , summed over spins and integrated over the angle of the outgoing electron .",
    "this matrix element is calculated according to the rules of angular momentum algebra ( see e.g. , @xcite )",
    ". the bound state wave function @xmath16 is presented in the form @xmath74 , i.e. with separated angular and radial parts .",
    "the exponential factor is expanded into partial waves in the usual way : @xmath75 the radial wave function of the bound and continuum states satisfy the normalization conditions :    @xmath76    where @xmath77 is the energy of ejected electron and @xmath78 is the scattering phase shift .    according to @xcite , the action of @xmath79 on this wave function yields :    @xmath80    thus , the matrix element is presented as a sum of angular and radial parts .",
    "we note that the present procedure is quite similar to that used for calculating the magnetic terms of the pionium breakup @xcite .",
    "we define two types of radial matrix elements , a usual one @xmath81 and a new one involving the derivative of the initial radial wave function : @xmath82 the three - dimensional integration is , as usual , decomposed into a radial and angular parts .",
    "the angular integration can be done using eq .",
