    "the problem of understanding the large gluon density regime in high energy scattering has always been one of the challenges of perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) .",
    "unitarity of the total cross  section and saturation of the gluon distribution are among the most important issues related to the problem .",
    "the bfkl equation @xcite is the only well  established tool of pqcd which allows us to explore this high density region by resumming the leading longitudinal logarithmic contribution to the scattering process . in bfkl evolution",
    "the small@xmath0 partons are produced overlapping each other in the transverse coordinate space @xcite , therefore creating high density regions in the hadron s wave function ( hot spots ) .",
    "the next  to  leading order correction to bfkl equation has been calculated recently @xcite .",
    "although the final conclusion one should draw from the calculation of @xcite is still to be understood , there are some serious problems associated with the interpretation of the result @xcite .",
    "however , we are not going to address these issues in this paper for the following reason . as was shown in @xcite the effects of the second order bfkl kernel become important in hadron ",
    "hadron scattering at the rapidities of the order of @xmath2 , with @xmath3 the strong coupling constant . at the same time the unitarity constraints , associated with the multiple ( leading order ) hard pomeron exchanges",
    "are expected to be reached at @xmath4 @xcite , which is parametrically smaller than @xmath5 for small coupling constant .",
    "therefore multiple pomeron exchanges become important at lower center of mass energies than the effects of subleading corrections , possibly leading to unitarization of the total hadron ",
    "hadron cross  section .",
    "hence the problem of resummation of the multiple pomeron exchanges seems to be more important for describing the recent experimental results , such as zeus 1995 data @xcite , which probably shows evidence of saturation of the @xmath1 structure function at low @xmath6 .    in this paper",
    "we are going to consider deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) of a virtual photon on a large nucleus and will resum all multiple pomeron exchanges contributing to the @xmath1 structure function of the nucleus in the leading longitudinal logarithmic approximation in the large @xmath7 limit .",
    "the first step in that direction in pqcd was the derivation by gribov , levin and ryskin ( glr ) of an equation describing the fusion of two pomeron ladders into one in the double logarithmic approximation @xcite .",

    "an extensive work on resumming the multiple pomeron exchanges in the gluon distribution function in the leading @xmath12 approximation ( i.e. without taking the double logarithmic limit ) has been pursued by jalilian - marian , kovner , leonidov , mclerran , venugopalan , and weigert @xcite . starting with a model of a large nucleus @xcite , which provides some effective action @xcite , they develop a renormalization group procedure which integrates out harder longitudinal gluonic degrees of freedom in the nucleus and allows one to resum leading @xmath12 contribution to the gluon distribution function .",
    "the resulting equation , written in a functional form in @xcite is supposed to resum these leading logarithms including also all powers of color charge density of the nucleus , which in a more traditional language corresponds to resummation of multiple pomeron exchanges .",
    "however , even though that equation at the lowest ( one pomeron ) level reduces to the expected bfkl equation @xcite , in general it is a very complicated functional differential equation which can not be solved even numerically .",

    "though the next - to - lowest order equation will in addition have cubic terms in @xmath150 on the right hand side . then , putting @xmath151 and @xmath152 one would easily obtain an equation resumming multiple pomeron exchanges in the subleading logarithmic approximation .",
    "therefore dipole model provides us with a relatively straightforward way of taking into account the multiple pomeron exchanges once the one  pomeron exchange contribution has been calculated . in other words",
    "if the dipole kernel is known at any order in the coupling constant one can easily generalize the resulting equation for generating functional to include the multiple pomeron exchanges on a nucleus .",
    "finally we note that it would be interesting to try fitting the recent hera data @xcite using the evolution of the @xmath1 structure function given by eq .",
