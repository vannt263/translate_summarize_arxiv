    "<S> somewhat surprisingly , _ the edge currents vanish within the topological phase , in spite of the presence of edge states in the spectrum_. the edge currents are composed of counter - propagating contributions which cancel at @xmath89 ; see supplemental material . moreover , the longitudinal currents @xmath81 exhibit @xmath87-periodicity in @xmath88 . </S>",
    "<S> this is a consequence of being at half - filling and occurs in spite of the fact that the hamiltonian and the current operator have a periodicity of @xmath95 . to prove the @xmath87-periodicity in @xmath88 we first note that both the hamiltonian and the current operator change sign under the transformation @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 , thereby interchanging the upper and the lower bands . at half - filling , </S>",
    "<S> we fill only the lower band , and it follows that @xmath100 . in addition , the current changes sign under the parity transformation @xmath101 . </S>",
    "<S> this interchanges the sublattices and corresponds to @xmath96 and @xmath102 . </S>",
    "<S> it follows that @xmath103 , where in the last step we use the transformation properties under time - reversal . combining these relations , </S>",
    "<S> one obtains the @xmath87-periodicity in @xmath88 and the vanishing of the longitudinal currents for @xmath89 .    </S>",
    "<S> similar arguments also apply to the ( lattice discretization of the ) orbital magnetization : @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the local current density operator and @xmath106 is the area . as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : equil_edges](c ) this also vanishes within the topological phases and has @xmath87-periodicity in @xmath88 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our numerical computations also reveal that the magnetization vanishes on a sinusoidal locus @xmath107 within the topological phases ; see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : equil_edges](d ) . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , @xmath108 has extrema at @xmath83 and on the topological phase boundaries , @xmath109 , for fixed @xmath88 . </S>",
    "<S> away from half - filling , the particle - hole symmetry is broken and the periodicity of the currents and the magnetization is restored to @xmath95 . </S>",
    "<S> the increase or decrease of the edge currents depends on the sign of the doping and the chern index ; see supplemental material .    </S>",
    "<S> _ dynamics of the edge currents._ having discussed the equilibrium properties of the edge currents we now consider their response to quantum quenches . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : edge_dyn ] we show quenches from the topological to the non - topological phase . </S>",
    "<S> the edge currents decay towards new values that are found to be numerically close to the equilibrium values of the post - quench hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> this is in spite of the fact that the system is left in an excited state under unitary evolution , and that @xmath18 remains pinned to unity in the absence of boundaries . </S>",
    "<S> quenches from the non - topological to topological phases exhibit similar behavior ; see supplemental material .     for @xmath110 ( circles ) and @xmath111 ( crosses ) following a quantum quench between the topological phase and the non - topological phase with @xmath66 , @xmath67 and fixed @xmath84 . </S>",
    "<S> quenches from @xmath112 to @xmath113 ( main panel ) and from @xmath112 to @xmath114 ( inset ) showing that the edge currents approach new equilibrium values . </S>",
    "<S> for the chosen parameters , these are very close to the ground state expectation values of @xmath115 in the final hamiltonian , as indicated by the horizontal lines . ]    further insight into the non - equilibrium evolution may be gleaned from the time - evolution of the longitudinal currents across the two - dimensional system . as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : jnt ] , the damped oscillations of the edge currents is accompanied by the light - cone spreading of the currents into the interior of the sample </S>",
    "<S> . it would be interesting to observe this dynamics in experiment , which is in principle possible if local imaging is available  @xcite .     following a quantum quench from the topological to the non - topological phase for the parameters used in the inset of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : edge_dyn ] . the damped oscillations of the edge currents are clearly visible , as is the light - cone spreading of the currents into the interior of the sample , where @xmath116 is the effective speed of light . the waves propagating from the two edges meet at time @xmath117 , leading to resurgent oscillations in finite - size samples ; see supplemental information . ]    _ conclusions._ in this manuscript we have explored the non - equilibrium dynamics of the haldane model . </S>",
    "<S> we have demonstrated that the chern number is preserved in both quenches and sweeps between different regions of the phase diagram . however , the edge states may be re - constructed and re - populated leading to changes in the accompanying edge currents </S>",
    "<S> . predictions for experiment include the vanishing of the equilibrium edge currents in the topological phases , and the light - cone spreading of the currents following a quantum quench . </S>",
    "<S> there are a wide variety of directions for further research , including the dynamics of the conductivity and its relation to the chern number , and the role of decoherence via coupling to the environment .    _ </S>",
