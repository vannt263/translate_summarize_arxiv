    "homonuclear diatomic molecules and molecular ions have been studied since the first days of quantum mechanics . surprisingly many of these , in particular those containing transition elements , are still far from being fully understood .",
    "even though they pose a challenge to computational approaches in physics and chemistry , they are studied intensely because of a wide interest in their electronic , magnetic , and catalytic properties .",
    "@xcite for example , the nickel diatomic molecular cation ni@xmath1 has served as a model system to study the role of surface defects in catalytic activity , @xcite and as one of the smallest systems to study strongly correlated electron phenomena .",
    "@xcite diatomic molecules of transition elements have also been proposed as systems with large magnetic anisotropy energy .",
    "@xcite one prerequisite for large magnetic anisotropy energy is large orbital angular momentum with significant spin - orbit coupling and strong coupling of the electronic orbital angular momentum to a molecular axis .",
    "the spin multiplicity @xmath6 and orbital angular momentum projection @xmath7 in the ground state of ni@xmath1 are , however , not known unambiguously .",
    "a total angular momentum projection of @xmath8 onto the molecular axis and a bond length of @xmath9  to @xmath10  in the electronic ground state of ni@xmath1 were previously determined from rotationally resolved photodissociation spectroscopy .",
    "@xcite reported experimental values of the bond dissociation energy vary from @xmath11 ev to @xmath12 ev , with a preference for the upper values .",
    "@xcite this experimentally determined @xmath8 ground state is in conflict with theoretical results , which predict @xmath13 and @xmath14 states , or quartet spin states without symmetry specification .",
    "@xcite an excited @xmath15 state is also predicted at @xmath16 mev above a @xmath13 ground state .",
    "@xcite here we show that the ground state of ni@xmath1 is the @xmath0 state as determined from x - ray magnetic circular dichroism spectroscopy .",
    "the assignment agrees in the projected total angular momentum @xmath8 with photodissociation spectroscopy , @xcite and in the quartet spin state with theoretical predictions .",
    "the experimental setup has already been described in earlier reports of the electronic ground states of chromium , @xcite manganese , @xcite iron , @xcite and cobalt @xcite diatomic molecular cations . as in these previous studies , x - ray magnetic circular dichroism ( xmcd ) spectroscopy",
    "is performed at the berlin synchrotron radiation facility bessy ii beamline ue52-pgm in a cryogenic linear ion trap that is situated in a @xmath17 t homogeneous magnetic field of a superconducting solenoid .",
    "@xcite in brief , ni@xmath1 ions are produced by magnetron sputtering of a nickel target with argon ions in helium buffer gas .",
    "cationic species produced in the sputtering and gas - aggregation process are collected at the source exit and transferred by a differentially pumped radio - frequency hexapole ion guide into a quadrupole mass spectrometer .",
    "@xcite a continuous and mass - filtered beam of ni@xmath1 is then guided into a liquid - helium - cooled quadrupole ion trap and thermalized in the presence of an axial magnetic field by collisions with helium buffer gas at constant pressure in the order of @xmath18 mbar .",
    "elliptically polarized soft x - ray radiation is coupled into the ion trap with the polarization vector parallel or antiparallel to the magnetic field , and the photon energy is swept across the nickel @xmath19 @xmath20 absorption edges from 840.0 ev to 885.8 ev with a photon energy resolution of 400 mev in 0.2 ev steps .",
    "auger decay following core excitation leads to multiply charged diatomic cations , which undergo fragmentation .",
    "product ions eventually resulting from this resonant photoionisation process are collected by the ion trap and mass - analyzed by means of a reflectron time - of - flight mass spectrometer .",
    "x - ray absorption and x - ray magnetic circular dichroism spectra were recorded in partial ion yield mode on the dominant ni@xmath21 product ion channel .",
    "a total of nine data sets were taken under different conditions , yielding xmcd results at eight different ion temperatures and two different magnetic fields .",
    "the x - ray absorption and xmcd line shapes agree in all cases , only the xmcd intensity depends on magnetization .",
    "the isotropic x - ray absorption spectrum of ni@xmath1 , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1_xas ] , is taken as the sum of parallel @xmath23 and antiparallel @xmath24 orientation of photon helicity and applied magnetic field .",
    "it is in very good agreement with the previously reported linear x - ray absorption spectrum of ni@xmath1 , except for the lower photon energy resolution and thus relative peak heights of the transitions . @xcite as for the atomic ni@xmath25 cation and different from bulk , the direct @xmath26 photoionization threshold is significantly higher in energy than resonant @xmath26 transitions by @xmath27 ev , leading to an absorption cross section that decreases almost to its pre - edge value between the absorption edges as can be seen around 860 ev excitation energy",
    ". @xcite the x - ray absorption spectrum of fig .",
    "[ fig:1_xas ] neither agrees with a pure @xmath28 nor @xmath29 ground state configuration @xcite of the constituent atoms but seems to indicate a combination of both .",
    "this is illustrated by computed spectra for a linear combination of atomic @xmath30 and @xmath29 initial state configurations in fig .",
    "[ fig:1_xas ] , calculated in a hartree - fock multiplet approach using cowan s code as implemented in .",
    "@xcite     @xmath19 edge x - ray absorption and xmcd spectra of ni@xmath1 recorded at @xmath31 t applied magnetic field and @xmath32 k ion trap temperature .",
    "the spectral profile of transitions into @xmath5 derived final states can be reproduced by a combination of @xmath33 ni @xmath30 and ni@xmath25 @xmath29 initial states . the smooth increase in experimental x - ray absorption cross section above 862",
    "ev is due to transitions into higher @xmath34 and @xmath35 derived rydberg states . ]",
    "[ fig:1_xas ] also shows the xmcd spectrum of ni@xmath1 , i.e , the difference spectrum @xmath36 , recorded at a magnetic field of @xmath31 t and 3.8 k ion trap temperature . because we did not observe a change of the xmcd line shape with magnetization of ni@xmath1 , and",
    "because @xmath37 and @xmath38 are always positive values , the asymmetry at the @xmath26 edge varies linearly with magnetization and is limited to @xmath39 in the case of saturation magnetization .",
    "it can therefore be used a as a relative measure of magnetization , and the absolute value of the xmcd asymmetry at the maximum of the @xmath26 resonance ( @xmath40 ev ) of @xmath41 indicates a magnetization of @xmath42 times the total magnetic moment of ni@xmath1 . at the same time , the large negative xmcd signal at the l@xmath43 edge and the small but again negative xmcd signal at the @xmath44 edge , visible as a step in the integrated xmcd spectrum , indicates significant orbital magnetization and thus a large orbital contribution to the total magnetic moment .",
    "application of the xmcd orbital and effective spin sum rules @xcite to the spectrum in fig .",
    "[ fig:1_xas ] , recorded at lowest temperature of the ion trap and highest applied magnetic field , yields orbital and effective spin magnetizations , @xmath45 and @xmath46 , per unoccupied @xmath5-derived state of @xmath47 @xmath4 and @xmath48 @xmath4 .",
    "the lowest - energy asymptote of ni@xmath1 in the limit of separated atoms corresponds to ni @xmath30 @xmath49 + ni@xmath25 @xmath29",
    "@xmath50 and leads to a @xmath51 electronic configuration of the diatomic molecular cation . only 25 mev higher in energy is the ni @xmath52 @xmath53 @xmath54 ni@xmath25 @xmath29 @xmath50 asymptote that would lead to a @xmath55 electronic configuration . averaging over spin - orbit coupled states inverts the energetic order and places the latter asymptote 30 mev below the former . @xcite we therefore consider both asymptotes in the following , even though the experimental x - ray absorption and xmcd spectra already indicate a contribution of atomic @xmath28 and @xmath29 configurations , making the @xmath55 configuration less likely the one that correctly describes ni@xmath1 .",
    "both asymptotes limit the spin multiplicity of ni@xmath1 to @xmath56 , and the projection @xmath7 of the orbital angular momentum onto the molecular axis is limited to @xmath57 for the @xmath58 configuration , and @xmath59 for the @xmath60 molecular configuration .",
    "xmcd sum rules @xcite link the integrated intensities at the @xmath26 and @xmath44 edges of the xmcd asymmetry , depicted in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig:1_xas ] , to expectation values @xmath61 and @xmath62 of the orbital and spin angular momenta , where @xmath63 is the intra - atomic spin dipole operator @xcite that contributes to the xmcd effective spin sum rule .",
    "these expectation values are connected to magnetizations by @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "the orbital angular momentum sum rule @xcite of xmcd is more robust than the effective spin sum rule @xcite because the former does not suffer from @xmath63 contributions nor does it require a separation of @xmath26 and @xmath44 transitions in the experimental spectra .",
    "@xcite furthermore , the spin magnetic moment of ni@xmath1 might not be purely @xmath5 derived but could have additional contributions from @xmath66 orbitals , which @xmath19-edge xmcd is insensitive to .",
    "in contrast , only @xmath5 derived @xmath67 and @xmath68 orbitals contribute to the orbital angular momentum of ni@xmath1 .",
    "as a first step , we therefore use the detected orbital magnetization @xmath45 as a measure of the hypothetical total magnetization of ni@xmath1 for each of the candidate electronic states .",
    "this is done by multiplying the highest experimental orbital magnetization obtained in the series of temperature and field - dependent xmcd spectra , @xmath47 @xmath4 per unoccupied @xmath5 state , with the number of unoccupied @xmath5 states for the possible @xmath51 ( @xmath69 @xmath4 ) and @xmath55 ( @xmath70 @xmath4 ) configurations of ni@xmath1 .",
    "these values are then normalized to the projected orbital magnetic moments @xmath7 of each candidate electronic state of the corresponding configurations .",
    "we compare the values of @xmath71 thus obtained for the different candidate states to the condition of @xmath72 , where the lower limit of the relative magnetization is set by the xmcd asymmetry under the same experimental conditions , and the upper limit is set by saturation magnetization .",
    "this analysis shows that @xmath73 ( @xmath74 ) and @xmath75 ( @xmath76 ) states of the @xmath51 configuration as well as @xmath75 ( @xmath76 ) and @xmath77 ( @xmath78 ) states of the @xmath55 configuration are incompatible with the condition of a relative magnetization of @xmath42 derived from the xmcd asymmetry at the @xmath26 edge .",
    "these states can therefore be ruled out .",
    "likewise , all @xmath79 ( @xmath80 ) and @xmath81 ( @xmath82 ) states can be ruled out because the absolute value of the orbital magnetization can not become larger than the orbital magnetic moment .",
    "thus , without any further assumptions , the detected orbital magnetization and the limits of @xmath83 for the @xmath51 configuration as well as @xmath84 for the @xmath55 configuration only allow @xmath85 ( @xmath86 ) and @xmath77 ( @xmath78 ) states for the @xmath51 configuration , and @xmath85 ( @xmath86 ) states for the @xmath55 configuration .",
    "the ion temperatures that would correspond to these electronic states of the rotating ni@xmath1 molecular ion in the applied magnetic field are obtained by numerically solving an effective zeeman hamiltonian @xcite at the respective magnetizations for hund s case ( a ) angular momentum coupling .",
    "@xcite we use the experimental value of @xmath87  of the equilibrium distance @xcite to determine the rotational constant that is a necessary parameter .",
    "this allows us to further exclude @xmath85 ( @xmath86 ) states of the @xmath51 configuration , because these would correspond to ion temperatures of @xmath88 k , i.e. , significantly lower than the lowest ion trap temperature of @xmath89 k. at this stage , only @xmath77 ( @xmath78 ) states of the @xmath51 configuration and @xmath85 ( @xmath86 ) states of the @xmath55 configuration are left as potential candidates for the electronic ground state of ni@xmath1 .",
    "while the spin multiplicity could be 2 or 4 in both cases , only @xmath5 derived electronic spins contribute to the multiplicity for the @xmath51 configuration , but also a @xmath90 derived spin contributes in case of the @xmath55 configuration .",
    "this single spin in the singly occupied @xmath66 molecular orbital could be coupled parallel or antiparallel to the @xmath5-derived spins , giving rise to @xmath91 and @xmath92 states .",
    "the @xmath93 state with antiparallel spin coupling of the @xmath5 and @xmath90 derived states would correspond to an ion temperature of @xmath94 k , just below the ion trap temperature of @xmath89 k , and can also be ruled out because of inevitable radio - frequency heating of the ions .",
    "another possible state , @xmath95 , with an equal number of occupied @xmath5 derived spin - up and spin - down states can also be ruled out because this state would lead to a vanishing @xmath5 spin magnetization , in contradiction to the experimental finding of @xmath48 @xmath4 per unoccupied @xmath5 derived state .",
    "this reduces the remaining candidate states to @xmath96 and @xmath97 for the @xmath51 configuration , and @xmath14 for the @xmath55 configuration .",
    "these remaining candidate states are assessed by the experimentally determined ratio of orbital - to - spin magnetization of ni@xmath1 , which is equal to the ratio of orbital - to - spin magnetic moments in hund s case ( a ) coupling of the angular momenta .",
    "this ratio of orbital to effective spin magnetic moment @xmath98 of ni@xmath1 is shown as a function of orbital magnetization @xmath45 per @xmath5 hole in fig .",
    "[ fig:2_ratio ] , obtained by sum rule analysis of a series of temperature and magnetic - field - dependent xmcd spectra of ni@xmath1 .",
    "except for the lowest magnetization , which was recorded at @xmath99 t , these data were obtained at @xmath31 t for different temperatures of the trapped ions by variations of buffer gas pressure , radio - frequency amplitude , and ion trap temperature . a weighted linear fit of @xmath98 yields an intercept of @xmath100 and a slope of @xmath101 , i.e. , zero slope within the error bars . since a constant ratio is indeed expected in @xmath102 coupling , @xcite the ratio of @xmath98 can be given as @xmath103 from a weighted average that is shown as a dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig:2_ratio ] .     experimental ratio of ni@xmath1 orbital - to - spin magnetic moments as a function of orbital magnetization , which was varied by ion temperature at constant @xmath31 t. only the value for the lowest orbital magnetization was obtained at @xmath99 t. ion temperatures that correspond to the @xmath104 ground state are indicated in the upper axis for comparison . ]    for the remaining states of the @xmath51 configuration , values of @xmath105 for the @xmath96 state and @xmath106 for the @xmath97 state would be expected . for the @xmath14 state of the @xmath55 configuration , only the @xmath107 contribution of the @xmath5 derived subshell with a value of @xmath106 can be compared with the experimental ratio to which the @xmath90 derived spin does not contribute .",
    "as can be seen , none of the remaining candidate states has a value of @xmath98 that directly falls within the experimental range of @xmath108 .",
    "this indicates a non - negligible contribution of @xmath63 to the experimental ratio via the effective spin sum rule .",
    "these remaining states are therefore assessed by their @xmath63 contribution to the effective spin magnetic moment and by a radio - frequency heating contribution to the ion temperature .",
    "the @xmath96 state with more than three times the experimental @xmath98 value corresponds to an ion temperature of @xmath109 k , i.e. , very low radio - frequency heating of only @xmath110 k , and would require a very large @xmath63 contribution of @xmath111 @xmath4 per atom , more than twice its spin magnetic moment of @xmath112 @xmath4 per atom .",
    "this state can therefore be ruled out .",
    "the @xmath14 state would correspond to an ion temperature of @xmath113 k , and the @xmath107 contribution of the @xmath5-derived molecular orbitals , which xmcd is sensitive to , would require a small @xmath63 contribution of @xmath114 @xmath4 per atom . however , radio - frequency heating of only @xmath115 k is unexpectedly low at our experimental conditions .",
    "@xcite furthermore , the experimental spectrum in fig .",
    "[ fig:1_xas ] clearly indicates a mixture of @xmath28 and @xmath29 initial state contributions that make a molecular @xmath116 configuration highly unlikely .",
    "this allows us to also rule out a @xmath14 state .",
    "the remaining @xmath97 state corresponds to an ion temperature of @xmath2 k , i.e. , reasonably low radio - frequency heating of @xmath117 k , and would require a small @xmath63 contribution to the effective spin of @xmath3 @xmath4 per atom .",
    "we therefore conclude that the @xmath51 @xmath97 state is the electronic ground state of ni@xmath1 .",
    "this state is clearly in agreement with the @xmath8 ground state that was determined from rotationally resolved photodissociation spectroscopy .",
    "@xcite it also agrees in the quartet spin state with available theoretical predictions .",
    "@xcite the electronic and rotational temperature of @xmath2 k is among the lowest that have been reached by buffer - gas cooling of molecular ions . @xcite",
    "similar to the cases of cr@xmath1 , mn@xmath1 , co@xmath1 , and possibly fe@xmath1 , @xcite the ground state of ni@xmath1 is characterized by maximum spin multiplicity as a result of strong @xmath5 exchange that favors parallel alignment of unpaired electron spins .",
    "this seems to be a general property of homonuclear diatomic @xmath5 transition metal cations .",

    "a rather strong localization of the @xmath5 derived orbitals in ni@xmath1 is deduced from the line shape of the x - ray absorption spectrum , that can be reproduced by a combination of atomic @xmath30 and @xmath29 initial state configurations . as was noted earlier",

    "@xcite this finding is consistent with only a small @xmath5 orbital contribution to bonding in ni@xmath1 as was inferred from trends in bond length and bond dissociation energies along the ni@xmath124 series and was ascribed to @xmath5 orbital contraction .",
