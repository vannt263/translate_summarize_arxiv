    "in this report , we present the method and the results of the energy calibration of the hall b photon tagging system @xcite at the thomas jefferson national accelerator facility ( jlab ) .",
    "the hall b tagging system provides tagged photons in the multi - gev energy range with high energy resolution ( @xmath3 ) and a broad tagging range , @xmath4 to @xmath5 of @xmath6 .",

    "the tagging range of the device is divided into @xmath7 energy bins ( @xmath8-bins ) . in each @xmath8-bin ,",
    "the central value of the energy is used as the energy of the radiated photon .",
    "these values were generated by a ray - tracing program using the design geometry of the scintillation counter hodoscope ( @xmath9 overlapping counters , called @xmath8-counters ) and the two - dimensional field map of the dipole magnet .    in the analysis of fully exclusive reactions , such as photoproduction on deuterium",
    "the neutron mass was used as a constraint to calculate the photon energy from the momenta of the charged particles @xcite . ]",
    ", it was found that the photon energy defined by clas and the central values of the @xmath8-bins of tagged photons are different by as much as @xmath10 .",
    "the variation of this difference as a function of the tagger @xmath8-counter position was compatible with a possible sag of the frames which hold the @xmath8-counters .",
    "there was corroborating evidence from simulations of the effects of gravitational sagging and various possible misalignments of the tagger focal plane @xcite .    to determine corrections to the central value of energy in each @xmath8-bin independent of clas ,",
    "the tagged photon energy spectrum was measured in coincidence with @xmath0 pairs detected in the hall - b pair spectrometer ( ps)@xcite .",
    "the data were collected as a function of the ps dipole field and at fixed geometry of the @xmath0 detectors .",
    "these measurements , taking advantage of the linear relationship between momentum and the magnetic field of the ps , allowed for the relative calibration of @xmath8-bins with high accuracy . using measurements of @xmath0 coincidence rates at ps settings close to the end - point energy , the absolute energy scale of the tagging system was calibrated as well . the energy correction factor for each @xmath8-bin",
    "is defined as the ratio of photon energy , determined from momenta of @xmath0 pairs , to the ideal central value of the energy of that @xmath8-bin .    to calculate the momenta of the @xmath11 and @xmath12 , a simplified model for a homogeneous dipole",
    "was employed , using the central value of the field and the positions of the particle trajectories at the entrance and exit of the field region .",
    "two corrections were introduced to the model based on ray - tracing simulations using measured and generated field maps to account for non - linearities in the field distribution and for the finite beam and detector sizes .",
    "for these measurements , the ps was instrumented with micro - strip detectors for better position determination of @xmath11 and @xmath12 , and thus better energy resolution .",
    "based on the level of knowledge of the ps dipole field distribution and the position of the micro - strip detectors , the accuracy of the method is estimated to be @xmath13 .",
    "the data were collected during a photoproduction experiment in april of 2004 using the hall b bremsstrahlung tagging system and the pair spectrometer .",
    "the description of the tagging system can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite , a schematic view of the setup is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] .",
    "the photon beam was generated in the interaction of a @xmath14 gev electron beam with a @xmath15 radiation length thick @xmath16 foil ( `` radiator '' ) .",
    "the tagger dipole magnet was operated at @xmath17 a current ( corresponding to the central field value of @xmath18 t ) and covered the tagged photon energy range from @xmath19 to @xmath20 gev .",
    "the hall b pair spectrometer is located @xmath21 meters downstream of the `` radiator . ''",
    "the ps consists of a dipole magnet and two planes of scintillation counters , positioned symmetrically to the left and the right of the beam axis in the horizontal plane downstream of the magnet .",
    "the pair production converter , `` pair converter '' , is located @xmath22 cm upstream of the ps dipole center and consists of @xmath23 radiation length thick aluminum .    for this measurement , in addition to the scintillation detectors , the ps was instrumented with two pairs of micro - strip detectors ( ms ) to provide better position determination for the @xmath0 behind the dipole .",
    "they were mounted @xmath24 cm downstream of the magnet center , in front of the scintillation counters . each pair of micro - strip detectors consisted of @xmath25 and @xmath26 planes and covered @xmath27mm@xmath28 of detection acceptance .",
    "( the ( @xmath29 ) plane is defined by the centerline of the beam and the deflection plane of the dipole .",
    "the main field component is parallel to the @xmath26 axis ) .",
    "the distance between the centroids of the `` x '' planes was @xmath30 mm , and they were centered on the beam axis .",
    "the pitch size of the micro - strip detectors was @xmath31 . in the off - line analysis , only one of the `` y '' planes was used , since the micro - strip for the second `` y '' plane had a high noise level .",
    "the measurements were conducted at a large number of settings of the ps dipole field in the range from @xmath32 to @xmath33 tesla which corresponds to ps currents from @xmath34a to @xmath35a . at this range of the field values ,",
    "the energy range of @xmath0 covered almost the full energy range of the tagging system , see fig .",
    "[ fig : be ] .",
    "the ps magnetic field value was measured with a hall probe positioned at the center of the magnet .",
    "the accuracy of the device in the range of the measured fields is better than @xmath23 .",
    "the entire data taking process was automated . at each field setting , data were acquired for @xmath36 minutes of real beam time with a beam current @xmath37 na .",
    "a total of @xmath38 points at different field values were measured .",
    "for the determination of the absolute energy scale , data were taken at ps field values from @xmath39 to @xmath40 tesla , corresponding to currents from @xmath41a to @xmath42a , without requiring a coincidence with the tagging system . at these field values ,",
    "the sum of energies of the detected @xmath11 and @xmath12 covered the range slightly below and above the electron beam energy ( the end - point of the bremsstrahlung spectrum ) .",
    "measurements of the @xmath0 coincidence rate at a fixed acceptance of the detectors allowed us to relate the ps field values to the electron beam energy . using this relation ,",
    "the absolute energy scale in the pair spectrometer was defined .",
    "a coincidence signal from the scintillator counters of the pair spectrometer was used to form a trigger for the daq system . for each trigger ,",
    "time information from the tagger @xmath8- and @xmath43-counters and the amplitude of the signals in each channel of the micro - strip detectors were recorded .",
    "information on beam current , beam position , and magnetic field settings was inserted into the data stream every 10 seconds during data taking .    in the off - line analysis ,",
    "events with tagger hits within 15ns relative to the trigger were used .",

    "[ fig : be ] shows the tagged photon energy distribution at a single setting of the ps dipole field ( 0.97 t ) for selected tagger hits . the accidental background in the tagger was of the order of @xmath44 .    for the determination of the intersection point of @xmath0 trajectories with the plane of micro - strip detectors , only channels with adc values that were above the pedestal by more than five standard deviations were selected .",
    "valid hits in both `` x '' planes and in one `` y '' plane were required .",
    "the distributions of the number of hits in these planes are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hits ] . a small fraction of events with more than @xmath45 hits in @xmath46 , @xmath47 , or @xmath48 planes was rejected . for the final analysis ,",
    "events with @xmath49 or @xmath45 hits in a given plane were accepted if @xmath49 of these hits were adjacent ( the requirement of adjacent hits rejected only few events ) . in the bottom panel of fig .",

    "the distributions in the @xmath47 and the @xmath48 planes were similar .",
    "the hatched boxes on the graph correspond to the criteria for the event selection .",
    "for adjacent hits , the position on the plane is calculated as a weighted average using the adc values .    to reduce uncertainties due to the ps angular acceptance",
    ", the @xmath0 scattering plane was limited to @xmath50 cm around the detector mid - plane .",
    "the derivation of corrections to the tagger energy is performed in two steps .",
    "first , the mean values of the ratio of the photon energy , measured in the ps , to the central value of the @xmath8-bins were calculated .",
    "then , these mean values were scaled by the ratio of the electron beam energy to the end - point energy measured in the ps .",
    "the photon energy is defined as a sum of the @xmath0 energies reconstructed in the ps .",
    "the energies of the electron and the positron were reconstructed in a simplified model for charged particle propagation through the magnetic field .",
    "the ratios were calculated on an event - by - event basis for each e - bin that was within the acceptance range of the ps at a given field setting .",
    "the scale factor for the absolute energy determination in ps was derived from studies of the @xmath0 coincidence rate as a function of the energy reconstructed in ps .      in fig .",

    "the transverse displacements of the trajectories from the beam centerline ( @xmath51 ) for the @xmath11 and the @xmath12 were measured in the micro - strip detector plane .",
    "the momenta of leptons ( @xmath52 ) were calculated in a model that assumes a uniform field distribution between the two points along the trajectory of the particle . in this approximation",
    "the momentum can be expressed as a linear function of the magnetic field strength , @xmath53 , and the radius of curvature , @xmath54 : @xmath55    where @xmath52 is in gev / c , @xmath53 in tesla , and @xmath54 in meters .",
    "the radius of curvature is defined as : @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the effective field length , @xmath58 is the distance from the magnet center to the detector plane , and @xmath59 is the transverse displacement of the trajectory at the detector plane .",
    "the effective field length is defined as : @xmath60 were the integral is measured along the trajectory and @xmath61 is the field value in the center of the magnet .",
    "the ratio was calculated using the simulation of trajectories by the runge - kutta - nystroem method and the field map generated using a tosca @xcite model for the magnet .",
    "the generated field map was used in the simulation due to the limited number of measured points for the magnetic field in the acceptance region of the setup .",
    "figure [ fig : effl ] shows the dependence of @xmath57 on the magnetic field for the central trajectory inside the acceptance region of the detector .",
    "the drop of @xmath57 at high @xmath61 is due to saturation effects .",
    "it was parametrized using a third order polynomial function for the range of field values @xmath62 t and a linear function for the range @xmath63 t .",
    "the parameterization was then used to calculate the particle momentum .",
    "the effects of the finite detector sizes , detector geometry , and the size of the beam on @xmath57 were convoluted into a correction function , @xmath64 , as explained below . for data analysis , another correction function , @xmath65 ,",
    "was introduced to account for the difference between the generated and the real field distributions .",

    "@xmath67    as shown below , using the simulated field , the accuracy of the approximation of eq.([eq : eg ] ) is better than the required accuracy for these measurements ( @xmath68 ) .      in order to determine the function @xmath64 , pairs of opposite sign trajectories , originating from the same point at the pair converter @xmath43 ,",
    "were generated for several ps field values in a large momentum space .",

    "[ fig : rgx ] the dependence of this ratio on the distance between @xmath11 and @xmath12 for the central field value @xmath70 t is presented .",
    "an almost linear dependence was observed with very small variations ( @xmath71 ) over a large range of distances .",
    "the negative slope of the dependence reflects the fact that @xmath57 was calculated for the central trajectory that corresponds to @xmath72 cm . for tracks with @xmath73 cm ( @xmath74 cm ) ,",
    "@xmath75 , and therefore the effective field length , is smaller ( bigger ) than for the central trajectory .",
    "the overall scale of the ratio , @xmath76 , is due to an asymmetric distribution of the field between tracks start and end points , the ms plane is located farther from the magnet center than the pair converter .",
    "it should be noted that in the detector geometry of the experiment , @xmath77 spans the range from @xmath78 to @xmath79 cm .",
    "a third - degree polynomial function was used to fit the dependence in fig .",

    "[ fig : tosca ] , a comparison of the generated ( dots ) and the measured ( open squares ) field distributions is presented .",
    "there is a small difference in the fringe field and , therefore , another correction factor was introduced to account for this difference . to derive this correction factor , the @xmath75 values along the @xmath84-axis for the measured and the tosca - calculated field distributions were studied . since the number of points where the b - field was measured was too small to define the integral along the real trajectories , we compared integrals along the z - axis .",

    "the absolute scale of the ratio depends on @xmath25 , but the shape is similar for all @xmath25 values .",
    "since the real trajectories cover a larger range of @xmath25 , and the absolute energy scale will be defined by the end - point measurements ( see below ) , the absolute scale of the ratio is not important . for the analysis ,",
    "the shape of the fitted dependence , @xmath89 , at @xmath85 was used .",
