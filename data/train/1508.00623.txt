    "mechanics of growth and cellular rearrangements plays an important role in morphogenesis as both processes are central to defining the shape of developing tissues . as such",
    ", it has become a subject of intense study aiming to characterize specific mechanical processes involved in cell and tissue - wide dynamics @xcite , uncover the regulatory mechanisms @xcite , and identify if and how the mechanical state of the cell feeds back onto the larger developmental program @xcite . yet at the present , these questions remain largely unanswered due to the difficulty of measuring mechanical stress in live tissues and the challenge of identifying the relevant sub - cellular degrees of freedom needed to model the cell s mechanical state .",
    "many developmental processes involve two - dimensional epithelial layers , making it essential to understand cell mechanics in such systems . in its simplest form ,",
    "an epithelial tissue is a monolayer of apico - basally polarized cells tightly connected to their lateral neighbors @xcite .",
    "viewed from the apical side , cells tesselate the plane , forming a polygonal packing reminiscent of a soap foam . unlike passive foams , interfacial tension is not a simple material property , but rather derives from the cortical actin - myosin network @xcite localized as a planar ring just inside the cell s lateral surface @xcite . each cell",
    "s cortical cytoskeleton is linked to those of the neighboring cells via adherens junctions @xcite .",
    "the equilibrium geometry of cells is determined by the balance of cytoskeletal forces @xcite within the tissue . however , unlike passive materials , cells actively regulate such forces through mechanotransduction and internal remodeling , resulting in an intrinsically time - dependent stress - strain constitutive relation and controllable plasticity @xcite , which can drive rearrangement of cells .",
    "elucidation of the manner in which cellular activity manifests in collective properties of the tissue is critical to understanding morphogenesis .",
    "here we formulate a phenomenological model of an epithelial tissue as a two dimensional active tension network ( atn ) , which in addition to cytoskeletal elasticity describes cytoskeletal re - arrangement through myosin activity and the recruitment of myosin into cytoskeletal fibers , thus capturing the plastic response of cells to external stress .",
    "we shall demonstrate that the assumption that mechanical equilibrium of cells is dominated by tension has testable consequences for cell and tissue morphology , allowing immediate tests of this hypothesis .",
    "we show that active tension networks have a number of interesting mechanical properties , which include  screening \" that ( exponentially ) localizes transient perturbations .",
    "furthermore , an atn s ground state is degenerate : a consequence of the fact that  isogonal \" - i.e. angle preserving - perturbations of cell geometry also preserve tension balance .",
    "these isogonal ( zero ) modes dominate atn fluctuations and result in unusual behaviors in response to external perturbations .",
    "for example , we demonstrate that an atn generates a negative poisson ratio in response to a uniaxial stress .",
    "we also provide a new _ local _  mechanical inverse \" @xcite algorithm for inferring cytoskeletal tension - under the atn approximation - from images of epithelial tissue .",
    "finally , we shall demonstrate that dynamics of the initial stage of _ drosophila _ ventral furrow formation is well described by the atn model .",
    "epithelial cell monolayers form approximate two - dimensional polygonal tilings , that are conveniently parameterized by the set of vertex coordinates @xmath1 .",
    "the mechanical state of the tissue is often described using a generalized ` vertex model ' @xcite which defines the mechanical energy of a cell array ( given by vertex positions @xmath1 connected by edges defined by the array s topology ) as @xmath2 which incorporates the cortical cytoskeleton contributions from each interface @xmath3 - elastic energy stored by deformation of the bundle s length , @xmath4 , relative to its intrinsic length , @xmath5 , as well as the mechanical energy associated with cell area , @xmath6 , deformation relative to the intrinsic area @xmath7 . anticipating the heterogeneity of cells , eq .",
    "@xmath8 allows for the variation of intrinsic parameters from cell to cell and interface to interface .",
    "however , it is useful to further generalize the description by defining mechanical energy in its differential form @xcite @xmath9 = \\displaystyle\\sum\\limits_{<i , j > } t_{ij } \\ , d r_{ij } + \\displaystyle\\sum\\limits_{\\alpha } p_\\alpha \\ , da_{\\alpha}\\ ] ] here tension @xmath10 defines the change in mechanical energy in response to the change of edge length by @xmath11 and ` pressure ' ( or more precisely , radial stress in cylindrical coordinates ) @xmath12 defines the response to the change in area by @xmath13 .",
    "the force acting on a vertex is simply the projection of the above energy differential along the corresponding vertex displacement - i.e. @xmath14 .",
    "equation @xmath15 is more general than @xmath8 : the mechanical degrees of freedom @xmath16 and @xmath17 provide the means to describe the full time dependent behavior of a heterogeneous cell array , beyond the constitutive relations implied by eq .",
    "@xmath8 . instead of considering this model in its full generality",
    ", we will make the simplifying assumption that the contribution of ` pressure ' to mechanical balance can be neglected in comparison to tension .",
    "this is tantamount to the assumption that the magnitude of typical pressure differentials across cell interfaces satisfies @xmath18 , where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the characteristic scales of tension and length of an interface respectively .",
    "this implies that the interfacial curvature @xmath21 - as defined by the young - laplace law @xcite - is small compared to cellular length scales and thus this assumption is appropriate for any epithelial cell array with little to no observable bond curvature . as such , we set @xmath22 and convert the sum over cell areas to a boundary condition on the change of total tissue area , @xmath23 . in this limit ,",
    "the only forces within the bulk of the cell array are interfacial tensions due to cortical acto - myosin and the pressure only enforces conservation of the total area of the cell array , preventing its collapse under the action of internal tension .",
    "alternatively , we will be considering finite patches of tissue with specified normal stresses on the boundary ( that also prevent collapse ) , as a boundary condition .",
    "we shall refer to the corresponding structures as ` tension nets ' and investigate their properties in some detail .",
    "dynamics of vertex positions within a tension net is assumed to be relaxational @xmath24 where @xmath25 denotes the set of all vertices connected to vertex @xmath26 and @xmath27 represents the effective friction between apical cytoskeleton and its substrate @xcite ; it sets the timescale of mechanical relaxation , assumed to be fast relative to morphogenetic time scales .",
    "we adopt the constitutive relation for tension corresponding to the cortical contribution to mechanical energy given in eq .",
    "@xmath8 @xmath28 where for simplicity we assumed homogeneous cytoskeletal stiffness , @xmath29 , effectively setting the scale of tension .",
    "however , as already mentioned above , acto - myosin bundles are not simple passive elastic elements , but can dynamically remodel in response to external stimuli @xcite . in the simplest form",
    "this remodeling can be described by letting the intrinsic length of each intercellular edge @xmath30 evolve dynamically on a time scale slow compared to the mechanical relaxation of the tissue described by eq .",
    "@xmath31 . specifically : @xmath32     - hereafter referred to as the `` walking kernel '' .",
    "the generic features are the zero crossing at @xmath33 which separates myosin activity into a regime of walking , @xmath34 , and slipping , @xmath35 , and the positive slope , @xmath36 - i.e. we slip above the stall force .",
    "the dynamics close to the fixed point is immune to the exact functional form ( which are cell - specific ) and will only measure the aforementioned slope - depicted as a dashed blue line . ]    where @xmath37 describes the dependence of the local contractility rate of the cortical acto - myosin filament on the mechanical load @xmath10 that it carries .",
    "the generic features of @xmath38 are known from single - molecule experiments @xcite : each myosin will walk in a polarized direction , contracting the actin bundle , unless the load per myosin , @xmath39 , reaches the  stall force \" level @xmath40 . above this critical value , the filament simply elongates as each motor slips backwards @xcite .",
    "we note that in assuming the load carried by each myosin motor scales inversely proportional with the total number of motors , we have implicitly assumed that motors are non - interacting which is only valid for low densities @xcite .    given a specified myosin distribution on interfaces , eqs . @xmath41",
    "define the dynamics of an active tension net .",
    "the fixed point of these equations is then reached when i ) tensions balance at all vertices and ii ) all edges are at their stall force , set by the local myosin level . alas , arbitrarily specified myosin levels will lead to a frustrated system where these conditions can not be satisfied .",
    "indeed not all distributions of tensions under fixed topology will admit a set of angles that balance in the plane .",
    "however , in reality myosin levels are not fixed and are known to themselves respond to cytoskeletal tension through mechanotransduction @xcite . here",
    "we shall propose a particular form of mechanical feedback on myosin , that will ensure convergence to a balanced state .",
    "specifically , we assume that myosin is locally recruited into acto - myosin fibers under positive strain rate of the intrinsic length : @xmath42 with @xmath43 parameterizing the speed of myosin recruitment ; myosin redistribution occurs on morphogenetic timescales and thus the postulated feedback is assumed to occur slow relative to both mechanical relaxation and acto - myosin contractility .",
    "while presently we do not have direct evidence for this specific form of mechanical feedback on local myosin concentrations , it is generally consistent with experimental observations @xcite .       and",
    "@xmath44 onto the dotted line must balance , providing a relation between tensions and angles at equilibrium .",
    "( b ) consistent assignment of tensions on edges surrounding the cell is possible only if the compatibility characteristic @xmath45 , defined by eq .",

    "enrichment of nearly compatible cells is very weak .",
    "a table summarizing the results for the four analyzed tissues ( see text ) is shown below . ]",
    "the force balance condition of a static tension net defines equilibrium geometry through eq .",
    "@xmath47 @xmath48 this immediately defines a relationship , for the ratio of tensions of any pair of adjacent edges in terms of angles at their shared vertex ( depicted in fig .",
    "2(a ) ) . @xmath49",
    "since the product of such ratios computed for any closed loop of edges has to be equal to unity , a consistent global assignment of tensions @xmath16 is only possible if the polygonal array satisfies the following compatability constraint @xmath50 for each cell @xmath51",
    "@xmath52 @xmath26 labels the vertices of cell @xmath51 , denoted as @xmath53 , in a clockwise fashion ; @xmath54 are the unit vectors that point from vertex @xmath26 to @xmath26+@xmath55 , and @xmath56 are the unit vectors that point along the external edge of vertex @xmath26 , relative to cell @xmath51 .",
    "a diagram of the construction is shown in fig .",
    "this compatibility constraint can be understood as the geometric consequence of demanding that a polygonal array to be balanced by edge tension alone which requires one geometric constraint per cell , compensating for the absence of pressure differentials necessary to balance an arbitrary array @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the compatibility constraint provides us with a simple quantitative assay to assess the validity of static tension net approximation for real epithelial tissues . to that end",
    "we examine snapshots of cell arrays calculating the value of @xmath50 for each cell and compare the resultant distribution to a suitable empirical ",
    "null \" - i.e. a distribution constructed from a fictitious cell array with the equivalent angle distribution as measured from the data .",
    "any cell array approximating a tension net would generate a distribution of @xmath50 clustering significantly closer to @xmath55 than the randomized null distribution as correlations imposed by the compatability constraint between angles of a given cell are lost in the latter . as shown in fig .",
    "2(c ) , three out of four measured drosophila tissues ( fly embryo at the stage just before gastrulation at the ventral site @xcite , the embryonic lateral ectoderm @xcite and the pupal notum @xcite , but not the 3rd instar wing imaginal disc @xcite ) deviate significantly from the null , in strong support of the static tension net approximation .",
    "tissue data for ventral ectoderm and imaginal wing disc was kindly provided by eric wieschaus and ken irvine respectively .",
    "a useful geometric way of understanding the constraints on the equilibrium geometry of tension nets is based on the fact that any balanced set of tensions @xmath16 defines a triangulation of the tension plane with triangles @xmath57 defined for triads of edges that meet at a vertex @xmath26 @xcite with the _ dual _ tension vector @xmath58 being an edge tension vector rotated in the plane by @xmath59 .",
    "each triangular plaquette is then ` dual ' to the original vertex and the vertices of the aforementioned triangulation are dual to the original cells .",
    "an example of such a static tension net and it s corresponding dual graph is shown in fig .",
    "3(a ) .    to count the number of degrees of freedom that define balanced tension configurations we note that a triangulation is completely specified by the positions of its vertices , @xmath60 , the number of which equals @xmath61 - the number of polygonal cells - so that triangulation is specified by @xmath62 independent degrees of freedom .",
    "tensions are given by differences of dual vertex positions - i.e. @xmath63 where @xmath51,@xmath64 denote the cells that share edge @xmath3 .",
    "as such , the dual graph is an irrotational decomposition of the original force diagram .",
    "the naive count of @xmath65 ( @xmath66 being the number of edges ) tension parameters is reconciled with the correct result by noting that the sides of a triangulation tensions must satisfy the local planarity condition .",
    "internal angles of the triangles around each dual vertex must sum to @xmath67 , which imposes @xmath61 constraints on tensions , that are the dual of the compatibility constraints on the geometry of the original cell array .",
    "the existence of these constraints implies that an arbitrary distribution of myosin concentrations would not allow mechanical equilibration and thus motivates our conjectured mechanical feedback on myosin dynamics .",
    "the existence of a dual triangulation for equilibrium tension nets also provides a robust way of inferring tensions from experimentally observed cell array geometries , improving on the previously proposed  mechanical inverse \" method @xcite .          provided",
    "the lattice obeys the compatibility constraint globally , the force balance condition defines a local mechanical inference method based on  propagating \" eq .",
    "@xmath68 for ratios of tensions , along adjacent edges .",
    "this local method is convenient insofar as it allows inference independent of boundary conditions . in practice , however , as seen in fig .",
    "2(c ) , the compatibility constraint is at best only approximately satisfied .",
    "thus the direct use of eq .",
    "@xmath68 would result in an accumulation of errors as geometric factors are multiplied together . to circumvent this problem",
    "we define a more general variational method which finds the best fit tension graph - i.e. position of the vertices of the corresponding triangulation - to the observed epithelial geometry by minimizing the ( pseudo- ) energy functional defined by @xmath69 & = \\frac{1}{2 } \\displaystyle\\sum\\limits_{<\\alpha,\\beta > } \\left [ ( \\bm{q}^*_{\\alpha}-\\bm{q}^*_{\\beta } ) \\cdot \\bm{\\hat{r}}_{\\alpha \\beta } \\right]^2 \\nonumber \\\\ - & \\frac{\\lambda}{2}\\displaystyle\\sum\\limits_{<\\alpha,\\beta > } ( \\bm{q}^*_{\\alpha}-\\bm{q}^*_{\\beta})^2\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath70 is the unit vector along the common edge of neighboring cells @xmath51 and @xmath64 .",
    "we constrain the variance of tension @xmath71 to be equal to one via lagrange multiplier @xmath72 to preclude the trivial solution .",
    "variation of the above functional with respect to dual vertices returns @xmath73 \\left[\\bm{q}^{*b}_\\alpha - \\bm{q}^{*b}_\\beta\\right]\\ ] ] where @xmath74 denotes the set of all cells adjacent to cell @xmath51 .",
    "@xmath72 is chosen to be the smallest value that ensures the matrix defined by eq .",
    "@xmath75 has a non - trivial null space ; it measures the deviation of the epithelial geometry from a true static tension net insofar that it is a necessary global perturbation to the orthogonality condition between an edge and its dual conjugate .",
    "3(b ) illustrates the action of this algorithm : minimization of @xmath76 amounts to minimizing the overlap between all edges and their conjugate duals .",
    "equations ( 10,11 ) reduce the tension inference problem to convex minimization subject to quadratic constraints and thus can be numerically solved using interior point methods standard to quadratically constrained quadratic programming ( qcqp ) @xcite .",
    "the benefit of the proposed variational  mechanical inverse \" method is that the output is a true static tension net - the algorithm projects the observed lattice onto the closest static tension net and extracts tension parameters from the projection .",
    "provided the tissue snapshot can be thought of as a static tension net with superimposed fluctuations , representing real dynamical fluctuations plus measurement errors , the variational inverse algorithm should provide a more robust measurement of equilibrium parameters as compared to the matrix inversion of force balance equations done on instantaneous tissue geometry @xcite .",
    "next we observe that the number of degrees of freedom for equilibrium tension net geometries , given by at @xmath77 ( @xmath78 being the number of vertices of the cell array ) , is larger than the @xmath62 degrees of freedom for the dual triangulations of the tension plane .",
    "hence , a given set of tensions must correspond to multiple possible polygonal arrays : specifically , to a manifold of nets with one degree of freedom per cell . to sort this out",
    "we first note that our construction of the dual triangulation generalizes the standard passage from the voronoi lattice to its delaunay dual triangulation .",
    "conversely , given a triangulation we can construct a dual polygonal lattice by defining the circumcircle center for each triangle and drawing a voronoi lattice based on these centroids . yet ,",
    "such a lattice is not the unique dual of the tension triangulation . as long as none of the vertex angles",
    "are perturbed , we can freely  inflate \" or  deflate \" lattice cells , as illustrated in fig .",
    "4(a ) , without disturbing mechanical equilibrium and thus the underlying tension - triangulation .",
    "the compatibility condition satisfied by equilibrium nets is essential for allowing such ",
    "isogonal \" - i.e. angle preserving - dilation modes to exist .",
    "this mathematical observation has interesting physical implications , as it suggests that  isogonal \" deformations should dominate observed fluctuations of tension nets close to mechanical equilibrium , acting as easily excitable  soft modes \" of the cellular lattice .",
    "moreover , we expect that the isogonal modes are fundamental to atn dynamics on time scales longer than mechanical equilibration , but short compared to the redistribution of myosin . because tension net equilibrium ( at static cortical myosin ) does not specify a unique cell array geometry , after any transient perturbation from equilibrium a cell array is not constrained to relax to the original configuration , but instead moves to a different point on the @xmath61-dimensional isogonal manifold .",
    "4(b ) illustrates the expected long - term dynamics .",
    "the result is a very particular form of  plasticity \" which should be manifest in the tissue s dynamics . as such",
    ", we now examine dynamics of an atn close to the equilibrium .",
    "the dynamics near equilibrium is most naturally expressed in terms of edge vectors @xmath79 , where each edge is labeled by the cells it partitions , in this case cells @xmath80 . in this representation",
    ", one must enforce the geometric constraint that edge vectors sum to zero around each cellular plaquette by hand @xmath81 this is achieved by introducing lagrange multipliers @xmath82 for each cell in our original energy functional defined by eq .",

    "an important corollary to this picture is that @xmath160 should strongly depend upon the local contractility rate of the acto - myosin cytoskeleton ; if the screening length @xmath128 is on the order of the system size then the perturbation on the boundary will propagate the entire interior of the tissue and thus globally excite isogonal deformations .",
    "conversely , if the screening length is much smaller than the tissue then most of the plastic deformation will be limited to a small layer around the stressed boundary and none along the orthogonal axis .",
    "this behavior was observed numerically for randomly generated voronoi lattices , as shown in fig .",
    "upon removal of the external force , the tissue was found to relax approximately back to the initial tension - triangulation and cell configuration .",
    "interestingly , negative poisson ratio has been observed experimentally for embryonic amphibian epithelia @xcite .      in the beginning of the gastrulation process in _ drosophila _ , embryo cells along the ventral midline constrict their apical surfaces , initiating the formation of a furrow that subsequently internalizes the future mesoderm @xcite , as shown in fig .",
    "this apical constriction was shown to be driven by pulsed contractions of a _ medial _ acto - myosin network ( located on the apical cell surface ) that connects to the adherens junction - anchored cortical cytoskeleton @xcite .",
    "the process has been described as a  ratchet \" @xcite where medial myosin pulses cause transient constrictions , that are subsequently stabilized by the retracted cytoskeletal cortex .",
    "this phenomenon is readily interpretable in terms of our atn model , which is a reasonable approximation because as shown in fig .",
    "2(c ) , embryonic epithelial cells appear to satisfy the geometric compatability constraint as defined by eq .",
    "we note that _ medial _ myosin pool exists in addition to the _ junctional _ myosin associated with the adherens junction - anchored cytoskeleton that is modeled by the atn .",
    "if we assume that the junctional myosin concentrations are relatively static over the timescale of medial myosin pulsing , the atn model predicts that any transient perturbation of mechanical balance due to medial myosin contractions would leave behind an isogonal deformation of the cell array , as it returns to mechanical balance dominated by cortical tensions that remain unchanged .",
    "hence we predict that cell deformation during the early stages of ventral furrow formation should be well described by motion along an isogonal manifold .",
    "this prediction was tested using time - lapse microscopy data on the early stage of ventral furrow formation in the _ drosophila _ embryo @xcite .",
    "the initial time point of each movie was fit to the closest possible tension net , using the variational approach defined by eqs .",
    "deformations of the cell array at subsequent time points were used to define the best fit amplitudes of isogonal modes .",
    "specifically , eq . @xmath143 is a rectangular ( @xmath176 by @xmath61 ) linear system of equations defining vertex displacements corresponding to an arbitrary isogonal transformation @xmath146 .",
    "conversely , the best fit ( in the sense of least square error ) @xmath146 is given by a pseudo - inverse of this rectangular matrix .",
    "we found , as shown in fig .",
    "7(b ) , that thus defined isogonal modes accounted for about 90% of the total variance of the dynamic vertex displacement field , which clearly indicates that apical deformation of cells during ventral furrow formation is well approximated by an isogonal transformation .",
    "thus , the cell array appears to behave much like a transiently perturbed atn , flowing along the isogonal manifold which comprises the set of its ( mechanical ) equilibrium states .",
    "the latter , in turn , suggests that cortical - myosin levels do not significantly change during this time despite medial - myosin spiking .",
    "the results not only suggest that an atn model is suitable for describing tissue behavior , but also provide a simpler set of degrees of freedom that suitably describe the dynamics .",
    "the spatial distribution of final @xmath146 is shown in fig .",
    "7(c ) : it resembles parabolic cylinder straddling the ventral midline .",
    "the parabolic profile of isogonal mode amplitudes corresponds to anisotropic constriction of cells with the long axis oriented along the anterior - posterior direction @xcite .     cells .",
    "good agreement was consistently found throughout .",
    "( c ) spatial profile of the isogonal mode amplitude , @xmath146 , just before invagination .",
    "the approximately parabolic profile as a function of distance from midline describes progressively increasing and anisotropic compression of cells . ]",
    "in this study , we proposed a quasistatic tension - dominated active model of epithelial tissue mechanics .",
    "there are two main assumptions on which this approximation rests : intercellular forces are dominated by cortical tensions held in the underlying actin network and that these tensions predominately balance each other across the tissue . taken together",
    ", these assumptions make a falsifiable , quantitative prediction about the geometry of cells in static tension nets via our compatability constraint .",
    "this was subsequently tested against four different _ drosophila _ epithelia . while perfect agreement was neither found nor expected , the fact that three out of the four epithelia were found to cluster significantly closer to a static tension net as opposed to their empirically constructed ",
    "nulls \" supports our original ansatz .",
    "the formulated variational inference of interfacial tension should allow further and more direct tests our model once suitable experimental measurements of cortical tension became available .",
    "our study centers on the exploration of tissue - scale phenomena concomitant with internal cell remodeling . specifically , our simple model , including only the effects of acto - myosin contractility and a generic load - dependent myosin walking rate , exhibited non - trivial , floppy ` isogonal modes ' that are expected to dominate the dynamics asymptotically .",
    "this predicts local cellular plasticity excitable by both internal perturbations and external forces that decouples instantaneous stress and strain .",
    "this suggests a striking picture of tissue morphogenesis ; we envision tissues operating in this limit to evolve their shape adiabatically , either by perturbing intercellular junctions to move isogonally , as shown to be the case for _ drosophila _ ventral furrow formation , or via modulating cytoskeletal chemistry to excite movement off the isogonal manifold ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the existence of such zero modes makes quantitative predictions on macroscopic tissue behavior immediately amenable to experimental verification .",
    "for example , any such tissue should exhibit global auxetic behavior in response to uniaxial stress .",
    "isogonal modes can be thought of as the discretized degrees of freedom associated to the conformal symmetry of the continuum description .",
    "the elastic energy associated to displacement field @xmath177 with vanishing bulk modulus is @xmath178 ^ 2\\ ] ] assuming relaxational dynamics - i.e. @xmath179 - the equation of motion for field @xmath177 is found to be @xmath180 .",
    "any solution of the cauchy - riemann equations can be added to @xmath177 with no generation of additional internal stresses .",
    "that is to say , any conformal transformation of our equilibrium displacement field is also a valid ground state .    in conclusion",
    ", we expect that generalization of the atn model and application of the proposed mechanical inference will further advance understanding of the interplay between cellular biophysics and tissue morphogenesis by making clear testable predictions that can be subsequently verified .    the authors gratefully acknowledge numerous stimulating discussions with ken irvine , thomas lecuit , and eric wieschaus and would like to thank a. martin and e. wieschaus for sharing the ventral furrow data and k. irvine for sharing the wing imaginal disc data .",
