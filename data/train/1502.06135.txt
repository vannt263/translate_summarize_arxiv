    "there has been a lot of recent interest in large field models of inflation in which the potential is given by a fractional power of the field .",
    "an example which is currently attracting much attention is axion monodromy inflation ( see @xcite for the initial paper and @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "axion monodromy models are attractive since they may provide a natural realization of large field inflation in the context of superstring theory .",
    "large field models of inflation @xcite are advantageous since in such a context the slow - roll trajectory is a local attractor in initial condition space @xcite , even including metric fluctuations @xcite . in contrast , for small field models the initial velocity of the inflaton field needs to be fine tuned , thus creating a potential initial condition problem @xcite . as is well known @xcite , from the point of view of observations , large field models of inflation are interesting since they may lead to a significant tensor to scalar ratio .",
    "there are challenges to obtain large field inflation models . for field values",
    "@xmath0 corresponding to large field inflation ( @xmath1 is the planck mass ) , there is the danger that gravitational corrections will lift the potential and prevent slow rolling of the field , unless there is a symmetry such as shift symmetry @xcite which protects the small mass required for large field inflation . in string theory",
    ", there is a further challenge of obtaining large field inflation : we expect the field range of the candidate inflatons , e.g. the moduli fields or the fields associated with brane separations , to be small , and hence incompatible with large field inflation .",
    "monodromy inflation @xcite provides a possible resolution of this problem , and axion monodromy is currently regarded as the most promising implementation of the idea of monodromy inflation in the context of string theory @xcite . for this reason , there has been a lot of recent activity on this topic ( see e.g. @xcite for a selection of recent papers ) .    to our knowledge",
    "there has been very little work on reheating in models in which the inflaton potential is given by a fractional power of the field @xmath2 ( but see @xcite for a study of reheating in the context of the initial brane monodromy inflation model of @xcite ) .",
    "the goal of this paper is to consider preheating in models in which the inflaton potential is given by a fractional power of the field , and in which the inflaton field is coupled to a second scalar matter field @xmath3 via a usual interaction term @xmath4.our goal here is to study the changes in preheating which arise due to the fact that the oscillations of the inflaton about the field value which minimizes the potential are not harmonic .",
    "reheating is an integral part of any inflationary model . without reheating",
    "the universe after inflation would be empty and cold .",
    "reheating was initially discussed using first order perturbation theory @xcite . in @xcite and @xcite",
    "it was realized that an oscillating inflaton field will induce a parametric resonance instability in fields which couple to the inflaton ( and also in the equations for the inflaton fluctuations themselves ) .",
    "this instability was then worked out in detail in @xcite and given the name `` preheating '' .",
    "reheating has been analyzed mostly for inflaton potentials of the form @xmath5 and @xmath6 , and for a matter field @xmath3 ( treated for simplicity as a scalar field ) coupled to @xmath7 via an interaction lagrangian @xmath8 .",
    "for both types of inflaton potential , the linearized equation of motion for fluctuations of @xmath3 leads ( neglecting the expansion of the universe ) to a harmonic oscillator equation with a periodically varying mass . in the first case of a massive inflaton field ,",
    "the equation for fourier modes of @xmath3 is an equation of mathieu type @xcite , in the second case , the case of a massless inflaton field with quartic potential , to a generalized equation . in both cases , the equation of motion for the fourier modes @xmath9 is of floquet type , and the general theory",
    "@xcite tells us that the modes will evolve as _",
    "k ~ p_1,k(t ) e^_k t + p_2 , k(t ) e^- _ k t , where @xmath10 @xmath11 are periodic functions , and @xmath12 is a non - negative exponent called the `` floquet exponent '' .",
    "values of @xmath13 for which @xmath14 form resonance bands .",
    "past work on reheating has shown that the efficiency of the parametric resonance instability depends on which class of model one is considering .",
    "we are interested in inflaton potentials with fractional power of the field .",
    "as in the canonical inflation models , the inflaton will be oscillating about its ground state .",
    "however , the oscillation is not sinusoidal .",
    "given the recent interest in axion monodromy inflation it is hence of great interest to study the efficiency of reheating .",
    "this is the problem we address in this paper .",
    "we will study the structure of the resonance bands and estimate the value of the floquet exponent within the resonance bands .",
    "our results show that the parametric instability is of broad resonance type and hence efficient .",
    "it will lead to the transfer of the inflaton energy density from the homogeneous inflaton background to matter fluctuations within less than a hubble expansion time .",
    "our result will allow a more precise determination of the parameters of models such as axion monodromy inflation from cosmological observations .",
    "as has been emphasized recently ( see e.g. @xcite ) , for a given action the values of the cosmological parameters such as the scalar spectral index @xmath15 and the tensor to scalar ratio @xmath16 depend on the reheating history .",
    "one of the reasons for this is that changing the duration of reheating will change the current physical wavelength which exits the hubble radius a fixed number of e - foldings before the end of inflation .",
    "our result also has implications for baryogenesis . since the energy transfer to regular matter after inflation is rapid , the  reheating temperature \" is high and high - scale baryogenesis mechanisms become feasible .    in the next section",
    "we give a brief review of axion monodromy inflation as an example of the type of models we have in mind .",
    "section 3 is the main one in which we study the equation of motion for the fluctuations of a matter field coupled to the inflaton and establish that preheating is efficient .",
    "we work in the approximation that the expansion of space is negligible .",
    "since the instability in our model is of broad resonance type and not of narrow resonance , including effects of the expanding space will not change the qualitative features of our results .",
    "i the most important change is that instead of exponential growth of the fluctuations we will have exponential growth damped by a power of the cosmological scale factor in section 4 we show that this approximation is self - consistent and we analyze various back - reaction effects .",
    "we use standard notation in which @xmath17 is the cosmological scale factor , @xmath18 is physical time , and @xmath19 is the hubble expansion rate .",
    "the low energy limit of string theory provides many scalar fields which can be candidates for an inflaton field ( see e.g. @xcite for a recent comprehensive review of inflation in the context of string theory ) .",
    "examples are radii of extra dimensions or distances between brane - antibrane pairs .",
    "typically , however , the range of field values is small and does not admit super - planck values required for large - field inflation .",
    "monodromy @xcite is a simple solution to this problem .",
    "a string connecting brane - antibrane pairs can be wrapped many times about an internal cycle , thus yielding large field values even if the basic field range is small . as was shown in @xcite ,",
    "suitably wrapped branes induce trans - planckian field ranges for the associated axion fields . in string compactifications , axions arise from integrating gauge potentials over cycles in the internal manifold .",
    "the potential for the axions induced by the presence of the branes of the axion field is not periodic but grows without bound , however with a power which is typically less than @xmath20 .",
    "as we will see , what matters for the efficiency of preheating is the amplitude of @xmath21 near the minimum of the potential , and this is set by the asymptotics of the potential for field values where inflation ends .",
    "we thank e. mcdonough for alerting us to this issue . ] .",
    "one example studied in @xcite has a linear potential , but potentials with fractional powers @xmath22 , e.g. @xmath23 , also arise ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the potentials have oscillatory terms ( caused by instanton effects ) and thus can give interesting observational signals in the spectrum of cosmic microwave background anisotropies ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , for powers @xmath24 which we consider here the oscillatory terms are negligible for field values close to the minimum of the potential ( which we take to be at @xmath25 ) .",
    "it is the dynamics near @xmath25 which determines the efficiency of reheating , and hence the oscillating terms in the potential will have a negligible effects on the reheating efficiency .",
    "we will hence here consider simple power law potentials .",
    "as discussed in previous section , we will consider the effective potential for inflaton field to be [ vpot ] v_eff ( ) = m^4-p||^p , where @xmath26 is a parameter with units of mass .",
    "we will also assume a simple coupling of the form _ int = g^2 ^ 2 ^ 2 between the inflaton @xmath7 and a matter field @xmath3 .",
    "such a coupling arises at tree level ( but at second order in the axion coupling constant ) between the axion and gauge fields ( which we can then represent in a simplifying way by a scalar matter field @xmath3 ) .",
    "therefore in the rest of the paper we will work with the potential @xmath27 if we take the matter field @xmath3 to be massless on the scale of inflation , and if we neglect self - interactions of @xmath3 , then each fourier mode @xmath9 of @xmath3 will evolve independently with an equation of motion @xmath28 this differential equation has a time - dependent frequency and a gravitational damping term .",
    "the time dependence is given by evolution of both the scale factor @xmath17 and of the background inflaton field @xmath29 .",
    "following @xcite , we will neglect the expansion of the universe for the moment , and we will later show that this is a self - consistent approximation during the early stages of preheating ) and thus take @xmath30",
    ". then we can rewrite eq .",
    "( [ modeeq1 ] ) as @xmath31 where @xmath32 if @xmath33 is a periodic function of time , then the equation is of floquet type @xcite and we hence there is the possibility of a parametric resonance instability for the @xmath3 fluctuations",
    ". the strength of the resonance depends sensitively on the dynamics of @xmath7 near the minimum of the potential .",
    "we will consider the case in which the homogeneous value of the @xmath3 field is zero .",
    "since the effective potential for the inflaton in this case is given by ( [ vpot ] ) , the equation of motion for the background inflaton field is @xmath34 as mentioned above , we will neglect the expansion of space and later check for the self consistency of this approximation . in this case",
    ", the equation becomes @xmath35 we consider values @xmath36 for the exponent in the potential . in spite of the fact that this equation is nonlinear and does not describe harmonic oscillation of inflaton field , the evolution of the inflaton field is periodic ( periodic motion about the minimum of the potential ) .",
    "as we know from previous studies of preheating @xcite , the efficiency of preheating is determined by the dynamics of @xmath7 near the minimum of its potential , i.e. by the value of @xmath37 at the time @xmath38 when @xmath25 .",
    "this value can be determined by energy conservation .",
    "the energy density at the end of inflation @xmath39 is given by @xmath40 from which we can find @xmath41    inflation ends when the slow - roll conditions break down .",
    "these are ^2 & < & v ( ) and + 3 h & < & v^ , where the prime denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath7 .",
    "the first condition breaks down once [ phien ] || = m_pl . for @xmath42",
    "the second condition breaks down for a smaller value of @xmath43 . for @xmath44 the number @xmath22 in the numerator of ( [ phien ] )",
    "is replaced by @xmath45 .",
    "we will denote the end point of inflation by @xmath46 and will write [ phiend ] _",
    "e m_pl where the value of the constant @xmath47 can be read off from ( [ phien ] ) , and we have used @xmath48 .",
    "it is convenient to parametrize the end point of inflation in terms of a dimensionless number @xmath49 given by [ sigmadef ] m m_pl .",
    "this will simplify some of the later equations .",
    "now we turn to the study of @xmath3 particle production , i.e. to the study of the structure of the resonance in the eq .",
    "( [ modeeq2 ] ) . while the the adiabaticity condition [ adiab ] < f(t)^2 is satisfied then using the wkb approximation we conclude that the state tracks the instantaneous vacuum and we find the solution of the from @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are coefficients determined by the initial conditions .    for small field values , the adiabaticity condition ( [ adiab ] ) is violated . to estimate the range of field values",
    "for which this is the case , we can replace @xmath53 by @xmath54 , namely @xmath55 since for small field values @xmath21 is constant to a good approximation . making use of the formula ( [ fformula ] ) for @xmath56",
    "we see that adiabaticity violation arises for field values obeying 2 g^2 ^ m^2 ( k^2 + g^2 ^ 2 ) ^3/2 .",
    "considering modes in the far infrared ( i.e. setting @xmath57 ) we find @xmath58 we denote the resulting value of @xmath43 by @xmath59 .",
    "thus we conclude that for small values of @xmath13 the condition for violation of adiabaticity is @xmath60 in order to estimate the energy transfer via this parametric resonance instability it is important to estimate the width of the instability band . to a first order ,",
    "this is given by the range of @xmath13 values for which the approximation made above of neglecting @xmath13 in the adiabaticity condition violation calculation is self - consistent , namely value of @xmath13 for which @xmath61 .",
    "this gives [ kmax ] k_max = ^p/4 m . to put this value in context , note that for @xmath62 this value is parametrically larger than @xmath63 , which means that the modes which dominate the phase space of modes which undergo parametric resonance have wavelength smaller than the hubble radius @xmath64 at the end of inflation , and that hence neglecting metric fluctuations is well justified ( see @xcite for a discussion showing that metric fluctuations have a negligible effect if the wavelength is smaller than the hubble radius ) .",
    "note that even modes with larger values of @xmath13 feel the resonance , but for a shorter time interval , namely a time interval corresponding to || < g^-1 k .",
    "now we return to eq .",
    "( [ modeeq2 ] ) and want to find amplification of @xmath65 modes after passing once through the range of @xmath7 which allows resonance .",
    "( [ vel ] ) for the range ( [ range ] ) of field values where resonance can take place we can write ( by rescaling time ) @xmath66 rewriting eq .",
    "( [ modeeq2 ] ) in terms of new time variable ( 2 g)^^mt we get @xmath67 where the rescaled wavenumber @xmath68 is q .",
    "equation ( [ modeeq3 ] ) describes scattering from a negative parabolic potential in quantum mechanics . according to the usual analogy where the classical variable @xmath3 becomes the quantum mechanical wave function , and",
    "the time variable in classical dynamics becomes the spatial variable in the quantum problem , the equation ( [ modeeq3 ] ) corresponds to the time - independent schrdinger equation ^2 + ( e - v ) = 0 , for a wave function @xmath69 in a parabolic potential @xmath70 and with energy @xmath71 .",
    "this analogy has been used in the context of reheating in @xcite , and in the case of reheating in the presence of noise in @xcite .",
    "the time range in the reheating problem when the field is in the range ( [ range ] ) corresponds to values of @xmath72 where quantum tunneling occurs .",
    "we will use the standard methods from quantum mechanics to solve the problem .",
    "well before @xmath7 enters the range ( [ range ] ) the solution is of the form ( [ adsol]),namely @xmath73 long after it passes through that region , the solution again is of the same form , namely @xmath74 the coefficients in eq .",
    "( [ adsol1 ] ) come from initial conditions .",
    "we can find the coefficients in eq .",
    "( [ adsol2 ] ) using amplitudes of reflection @xmath75 and transmission @xmath76 for the scattering .",
    "these coefficients are given by @xcite @xmath77 and @xmath78 where |r_k|^2 + |d_k|^2 = 1 and @xmath79 is given by @xmath80 we also note that the dependence on the phase of incoming wave during resonance the amplitude can increase or decrease . making use of these results , and including the phase @xmath81 of the incoming wave in the calculation ,",
    "we obtain the following matrix relation between the coefficients of the positive and negative frequency modes before and after the scattering : @xmath82 returning to our reheating problem , we see that @xmath83 gives the occupation number of particles with momentum @xmath13 after one passage of @xmath7 through the minimum of its potential , given that the initial occupation number is @xmath84 . considering @xmath85 and the same relation for incoming particles we get @xmath86",
    "where _ tot^0=2_k^0-_k+_k^0-_k^0 .",
    "the above relation between initial number density and final number density can be applied in sequence to all time intervals during which the adiabaticity condition is violated .",
    "therefore , for the jth scattering event we obtain ( in the case of large occupation number ) @xmath87 defining the `` floquet exponent '' @xmath88 for the jth scattering through n_k^j+1 = ( 2_k^j)n_k^j we obtain @xmath89 in figure 1 we sketch the value of @xmath90 as a function of @xmath13 .",

    "we also mark the value of @xmath63 on this axis . ]",
    "summing over all scattering events , considering the initial conditions @xmath96 , @xmath97,@xmath98 , and taking the phases @xmath99 to be randomly distributed we obtain @xmath100 we can rewrite the exponent as @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the number of oscillations of inflaton field . at a time @xmath18 after the end of inflation , the number @xmath102 is given by @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the period of infalton field oscillations is @xmath104 and we devided by two since in each period of oscillation , the inflaton field passes through the non - adiabatic region two times .",
    "the period @xmath104 can be estimated taking @xmath105 to be the constant value given in ( [ vel ] ) and solving t = 4 m , since one quarter of the integrated field range over one period is @xmath106 .",
    "hence @xmath107 therefore @xmath108 the next step is to find the value for @xmath109 .",
    "considering small values for @xmath68 and averaging over @xmath110 , we find from ( [ fe ] ) _ eff ( 3 ) . to find the energy density @xmath111 of the particles produced during preheating we need to integrate @xmath112 over all momenta which experience parametric resonance , i.e. with @xmath113 _",

    "we find @xmath115 which is to be compared with the inflaton density at the end of inflation which is [ dens2 ] ( t_e ) 2 m^4 ^p . we conclude that provided that the resonance lasts so long that the exponential growth factor can overcome the factor @xmath116 by which ( [ dens1 ] ) is suppressed compared to ( [ dens2 ] ) , then the parametric resonance instability will be sufficiently strong to drain all of the energy stored in the inflaton field at the end of inflation . whether this is the case or not depends on how soon back - reaction effects take over and how soon the approximations we have made cease to be self - consistent .",
    "in the analysis of the previous section we have neglected the expansion of space . in toy models such as those studied in @xcite this is a self - consistent approximation .",
    "we must check whether neglecting the expansion of space is justified in the present model .",
    "first of all , note that our analysis shows that the non - adiabatic evolution of the solution of the equation of motion for @xmath3 takes place in narrow time intervals @xmath117 when @xmath7 is close to @xmath25 . combining ( [ vel ] ) , ( [ range ] ) and the value for @xmath63 given by the potential energy density at the end of inflation ,",
    "i.e. at @xmath118 we obtain ~ , and hence we conclude that the cosmological expansion does not affect the study of @xmath3 particle production during the resonant time interval about any one @xmath25 crossing point . since the period @xmath104 of oscillation obeys t h^-1(t_e ) 1 , neglecting the expansion of space is also justified for any one given oscillation period . finally , taking as an example @xmath119 and @xmath120 , which yields a hubble expansion at the end of inflation close to the upper bound from gravitational radiation constraints , we find ~^-1 ~ 10 .",
    "thus , over one hubble expansion time the exponential increase in @xmath111 from ( [ dens1 ] ) is sufficient to overcome the small factor of @xmath121 in ( [ dens1 ] ) , taking @xmath122 such that the corrections to the potential for @xmath7 due to @xmath3 loops does not dominate over the original @xmath123 at the field value @xmath124 .",
    "thus , we conclude that it is a reasonable approximation to neglect the expansion of space",
    ".    we will now consider some back - reaction effects which could terminate or even prevent preheating .",
    "first of all , the fluctuations of @xmath3 which are generated in the preheating instability will lead to correction terms both in the equation of motion for @xmath7 and in that of @xmath9 .",
    "we need to determine the length of time these effects can be neglected .",
    "secondly , fluctuations in the inflaton field themselves could be amplified and then back - react both in the equation of motion for @xmath7 , shutting off the oscillations which drive preheating , and also in the equation of motion for @xmath3 , providing corrections to the mass term which will prevent the violation of adiabaticity which is required to obtain the resonance .",
    "we first discuss the possible amplification of fluctuations of @xmath7 .",
    "the equation of motion for the @xmath125 mode is @xmath126\\delta\\phi_k \\ ,",
    "= \\ , 0 \\ , .\\ ] ] to solve this equation and study possible resonance effects , we can for the moment neglect the expansion of the universe .",
    "since we are interested in large scale modes we can also drop the @xmath127 term . rewriting the equation and multiplying both sides by @xmath128 gives @xmath129",
    "which ( using ( [ phiend ] ) and ( [ sigmadef ] ) ) can be re - written as @xmath130 where a_1 & & [ 2(m_pl)^m^]^2-p + a_2 & & p(p-1)m^4-p",
    ". the solutions of ( [ phiflucteq ] ) are bessel functions of the first and second kind and take the following form @xmath131 the solutions for @xmath132 have a mild time dependence ( much weaker than exponential ) .",
    "hence , there is no parametric resonance of @xmath7 fluctuations , and thus no important back - reaction effects of these modes .",
    "thus , we now turn to the discussion of the back - reaction effects of the @xmath3 fluctuations .",
    "these fluctuations will lead to an induced potential for the inflaton in eq .",
    "( [ inflatoneq ] ) , the magnitude of which is given by @xmath133 .",
    "this term will have a major effect on inflaton dynamics when the interaction term become as important as the bare potential term @xmath134 .",
    "therefore the criterion for this back - reaction effect to be negligible is @xmath135 where the value of the inflaton field to be inserted is the one at the end of inflation .    due to nonlinearities in the @xmath3 sector",
    "( which will inevitably be present due to renormalization considerations ) there is a term in the potential of the form @xmath136 which will add a term to the mode equation ( [ modeeq1 ] ) . in the hartree approximation",
    ", this term will be an extra mass of magnitude @xmath137 .",
    "computing this effective mass by averaging over the modes which undergo parametric amplification , and comparing with the amplitude of the mass term which is driving the parametric resonance , we find that the induced mass term is negligible if @xmath138 where once again the value of @xmath7 at the end of inflation is to be used .",
    "the observed amplitude of density fluctuations constrains the value of the coupling constant @xmath121 : at one loop level the interaction between @xmath3 and @xmath7 induces a quartic self coupling term of @xmath7 .",
    "the coefficient of this term is proportional to @xmath139 but it is constrained to be smaller than @xmath140 . hence the constraint on @xmath121 is @xmath141 . in turn ,",
    "the same loop effects induce the self coupling of @xmath3 , and we expect @xmath142 . since the value of @xmath26 is also constrained to be small from the observed amplitude of the power spectrum of density fluctuations , we expect the first criterion ( [ crit1 ] ) to be more stringent than the second one ( [ crit2 ] ) .    to see what the criterion ( [ crit1 ] ) implies , note that when @xmath143 reaches the limit given by ( [ crit1 ] ) , then the energy density in the @xmath144 term in the lagrangian is of comparable magnitude to the initial energy density in the inflaton field , and ( for values of @xmath24 ) the energy density from the nonlinear terms in the potential for @xmath3 is larger .",
    "thus , we conclude that the back - reaction effects studied here do not terminate the preheating instability before a fraction of order @xmath145 of the initial inflaton energy density has been drained from the coherent oscillation of @xmath7 .",
    "hence , we conclude that the parametric resonance instability is very effective .",
    "in this paper we have studied the effects on preheating which result when considering the `` non - standard '' inflaton potentials in which the potential scales as a fractional power of the field , as is the case in axion monodromy inflation .",
    "we have shown that the parametric resonance instability is expected to be very effective .",
    "this result will allow a more precise determination of cosmological parameters in a given inflationary model of the type we consider , and it also implies that high scale baryogenesis scenarios are possible .    in this work",
    "we have used a standard @xmath146 coupling between the inflaton and the preheat fields .",
    "whereas such a coupling will arise at higher orders in the coupling constant in actual axion monodromy inflation models , in such models there are other couplings which are more important . in work in progress",
    "we are studying preheating for these more realistic couplings .",
    "in these more realistic models we can then also study the possible preheating of entropy modes of the metric fluctuations .",
    "such metric instabilities could lead to important constraints on axion monodromy inflation models @xcite .",
    "our work has been based on analytical approximations and we have not made use of the various numerical codes which have been developed @xcite .",
    "since we are interested in the onset and overall efficiency of the parametric resonance instability , an analytical approach is not only sufficient but maybe superior since it provides analytical insight into why we obtain the dynamics which we see .",
