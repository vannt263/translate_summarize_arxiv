    "strong mir emission from galactic nuclei , which is clearly indicative of non - stellar radiation , is frequently observed in seyfert and starburst nuclei ( see , e.g. , the review by rieke & lebofsky , 1979 ) , in several liner nuclei ( lawrence et al . , 1985 ; willner et al . , 1985 ) , in interacting and merging galaxies ( lonsdale et al . , 1984 ; cutri & mcalary , 1985 ; joseph & wright , 1985 ; wright et al . , 1988 ) , with no obvious dependence on the spiral morphological type ( devereux et al . , 1987",
    ") , although it has been claimed to be related to the presence of a bar , in early - type spirals ( devereux , 1987 ) . for a few galaxies mapped at fairly high resolution at mir and radio wavelengths , the emission at @xmath110@xmath0 m  shows a good overall spatial correlation with the ( thermal and non - thermal ) radio emission ( see , e.g. , the review by telesco , 1988 ) .",
    "the mir emission is generally attributed to thermal radiation from warm dust which has been heated by early - type stars formed in a recent burst of star formation , by shocks in supernova remnants and/or by a central dust - enshrouded active galactic nucleus ( agn ) ( see , e.g. , ho et al . , 1989 and the review by telesco , 1988 ) ;",
    "in the case of agns , the presence of a important non - thermal power - law mir emission component is conceivable , especially in the high - luminosity objects , although in recent years its role has tended to be deemphasized with respect to the thermal radiation ( see , e.g. , the review by bregman , 1990 ) .",
    "spectroscopic observations in the mir spectral band have revealed remarkable differences in the main spectral properties of different categories of galactic nuclei .",
    "the nuclei dominated by hii regions exhibit prominent narrow emission features in the 3 - 13@xmath0 m  spectral interval , the so - called unidentified infrared bands ( uir ) ; these bands are generally absent in agns , which usually have either featureless mir spectra or spectra characterized by a strong silicate [ babsorption band at @xmath19.7@xmath0 m .",
    "( roche et al . , 1991 ) .    in view of the remarkable separation of the mir spectra of different categories of galactic nuclei , it is worthwhile to explore in detail how the strength of the nuclear mid - infrared luminosity depends on the type of galactic nucleus and on other characteristics of the host galaxy .",

    "this volume - limited catalogue is intended to include essentially all known optically bright galaxies with systemic recession velocities of less than 3000 km / s .",
    "this corresponds to a distance of 40 mpc for the hubble constant @xmath4 km s@xmath5 mpc@xmath5 , which value is adopted throughout the present paper . in the nbg catalogue the distances of all non - cluster galaxies have been essentially estimated on the basis of velocities , an assumed @xmath6 as above , and the virgocentric retardation model described by tully & shaya ( 1984 ) , in which the authors assume that the milky way is retarded by 300 km / s from the universal hubble flow by the mass of the virgo cluster .",
    "the galaxy members of clusters have been given a distance consistent with the mean velocity of the cluster .    from the literature",
    "we have gathered together all published ground - based , small - aperture , broad - band photometric measures at @xmath110@xmath0 m  ( n magnitudes ) for our galaxy sample . for the old literature we have consulted the reference sources cited in the catalogue by de vaucouleurs & longo ( 1988 ) . in view of the fairly large uncertainties associated with the n fluxes ( which are generally not smaller than 20% ) no corrections have been applied for the redshift and the interstellar extinction .",
    "the central 10@xmath0 m  luminosity ( in solar units ) is evaluated using the expression @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the 10@xmath0 m  flux measured in units of millijansky and @xmath9 is the distance in units of mpc ( scoville et al . , 1983 ) .",
    "table 1 lists the galaxies of our sample for which small - aperture @xmath10 data ( or upper limits ) are available in the literature , together with the morphological type t , bar type ( sa , sab , sb ) , and ring type s(r ) , s(rs ) , s(s ) as coded in the rc3 catalogue ( de vaucouleurs et al . , 1991 ) , the adopted distance @xmath9 ( in mpc ) as tabulated in nbg , the decimal logarithm of the central luminosity @xmath11 ( in solar units ) for detected objects or an upper ( 2@xmath12 ) limit for undetected galaxies , the projected linear size @xmath13 of the central region ( in kpc ) corresponding to the beam size ( mostly around 5``-6 '' ) used in the observations , the reference source for photometry , the classification of the nuclear emission - line spectrum as follows : h = hii region - like , l = liner , s1=seyfert 1 , s2=seyfert 2 , s = seyfert ; l / s ( which indicates an uncertain classification of the agn spectrum ) ; l / h ( which indicates a composite agn / hii region - like nucleus in which the latter component is largely dominant over a weak agn ) ; t ( which indicates objects of transition between h and l ) .",
    "the interacting galaxies are denoted by int . for the galaxies detected by the infrared astronomical satellite ( iras ) in the 12@xmath0 m  band , in the last column we list the ratio ( or its upper limit ) of the ground - based small - beam 10@xmath0 m  flux to the larger beam iras 12@xmath0 m  flux , colour corrected to 10@xmath0 m .",
    "the resulting compactness parameter @xmath14 , which indicates the degree to which the central region contributes to the mir emission of the whole galaxy , is calculated ( following devereux , 1987 ) as @xmath15 where the colour correction factor @xmath16 is related to the ratio between the iras 25@xmath0 m  and 12@xmath0 m  fluxes via the following relation proposed by devereux ( 1987 ) : @xmath17 in a few cases in which we unreasonably obtain @xmath18 , we simply adopt @xmath19 .",
    "typical uncertainties in @xmath14 ( due to errors on fluxes ) are on the order of 0.1 .",
    "we have included in our sample also a few galaxies with t=1 ( according to the rc3 catalogue ) , which sometimes in the past have been classed as early - type spirals .",
    "priority is generally given to the most recent photometry and to the measurements made with a beam size corresponding to a physical size of about 0.51 kpc ( which is typical for most of the data ) .",

    "according to the widely used classification precepts of baldwin , phillips & terlevich ( 1981 ) , the emission line strength ratios h@xmath20/[nii]6584 and [ oiii]5007/h@xmath21 are used in order to distinguish seyfert , liner and hii region - like nuclei ; for instance , generally the hii region - like nuclei are characterized by line strength ratios h@xmath20/[nii]6584 @xmath22 0.7 and [ sii]6717 , 6731/h@xmath20 @xmath3 0.4 , whereas liners have [ nii]6584 appreciably stronger than h@xmath20 and [ oiii]5007/h@xmath21 @xmath3 3 .",
    "the unclassified nuclei are either objects with nuclear spectra without emission lines or ( mostly ) objects with unobserved nuclear spectra .",
    "a discrete fraction of the latter objects are likely to be liners in the early - type spiral morphological range and hii nuclei in the late - type interval , owing to the known preference of the two classes of nuclei to reside in early- and late - type spirals , respectively ( see , e.g. , keel , 1983 ) .    we have denoted as interacting the galaxies listed in the `` atlas and catalogue of interacting galaxies '' by vorontsov - velyaminov ( 1959 , 1977 ) , the interacting galaxies culled by davis & seaquist ( 1983 ) essentially from the ugc catalogue ( nilson , 1973 ) , the objects listed in the complete sample of interacting galaxies surveyed by keel et al .",
    "( 1985 ) and in the sample of violently interacting galaxies studied by bushouse ( 1986 , 1987 ) , the paired galaxies listed in the `` catalogue of isolated pairs of galaxies in the northern hemisphere '' ( karachentsev , 1972 , 1987 ) , the binary galaxies selected by white et al .",

    "our subsample of interacting galaxies is likely to be skewed towards pairs of galaxies which are close to one another , independently of their morphological appearance ( several galaxy pairs show no evidence of tidal distortion or structural peculiarity ) .",
    "disturbed galaxies with no apparent companions tend to be unrecognized as interacting ( see , e.g. , the case of maffei 2 discussed by hurt et al . , 1993 ) .",
    "it is not easy to understand whether this bias ( which is common to most statistical studies on the effects of galaxy interactions ) can affect significantly the results , since we would need to have a ( presently unavailable ) wide sample of interacting galaxies which are selected solely on the basis of the presence of morphological features unmistakeably associated with a certain range of tidal strengths .",
    "we have taken the iras 25@xmath0 m  and 12@xmath0 m  fluxes directly ( in order of preference ) from the papers of soifer et al .",

    "our sample , which is the most extensive  albeit not complete  set of small - beam mir photometric data so far examined in the literature , can be regarded as representative of the 10@xmath0 m  luminosity of the central regions ( of @xmath10.5 - 1 kpc , typically ) of nearby spirals .",
    "the inhomogeneity of our data set is limited by the fact that about half of it comes directly from the photometric survey of devereux ( 1987 ) alone .",
    "we purposely avoid choosing galaxies by virtue of some unusual property ( e.g , infrared - bright galaxies , peculiar and interacting galaxies , galaxies with active or starburst nuclei ) .",
    "therefore , our galaxy sample is less biased towards infrared bright galaxies and , in general , towards exceptionally bright ( in the optical and infrared spectral bands ) objects than several samples used in previous mir studies ( cf .",
    "the infrared - selected galaxy samples of devereux ( 1987 ) , carico et al .",
    "( 1988 ) , wright et al .",
    "( 1988 ) ) . yet",
    "our sample is likely to be still a little biased in that sense ( compared to a hypothetical complete sample ) , simply because the attention of many observers was focused on those objects .",
    "this bias implies that seyferts ( 8% ) and interacting objects ( 29% ) are over - represented in our sample ; it also probably leads to a general underestimation of the number of nuclei of low 10 @xmath0 m  luminosity , although it should not affect relative comparisons between the various categories of objects .",
    "owing to the fairly large number of upper limits on the mir flux densities , we have made use of statistical techniques suitable for the analysis of censored data and adapted to astronomical usage from the field of survival analysis ( see , e.g. , schmitt , 1985 ; feigelson & nelson , 1985 ; isobe , feigelson , nelson , 1986 ; for extensive discussions on the astronomical applications ) .",
    "if the non - detected galaxies were dropped from the sample ( as was done in previous efforts to characterize the typical mir luminosities of galactic nuclei ) , the resulting sample would be skewed towards infrared - bright galaxies in a complicated fashion that depends on the mir luminosity function and on the sensitivity limits . in practice",
    ", we have used the software package asurv ( rev 1.0 ) ( isobe & feigelson , 1990 ) which was kindly provided to us by e. feigelson .",
    "we have employed the kaplan - meier product - limit estimator in order to calculate the means , medians , and cumulative distribution functions of the quantity log @xmath11 for various subsets of galaxies .",
    "the kaplan - meier estimator , which is the cornerstone of the non - parametric survival analysis , had been proved to be the unique self - consistent , generalized maximum - likelihood , asymptotically normal estimator ( under quite broad conditions ) of the empirical distribution functions of a randomly censored data set .",
    "the estimated cumulative distribution function ( though not the associated errors ) is identical to the iterative solution derived by avni et al .",
    "( 1980 ) ; it is a piecewise continuous and piecewise constant function with jumps at the uncensored ( detected ) values .",
    "the kaplan - meier estimator adequately treats detections and redistributes upper limits , recovering the information lost by censoring ; it has been shown to be valid under quite diverse conditions ( feigelson & nelson , 1985 ) .",
    "the median of the distribution function is always well - defined . if the lowest point in the sample is an upper limit , the mean is not well - defined , since the distribution is not normalizable , and so the the outlying censored point is redefined as a detection in our analysis .",
    "the comparison of the distribution functions of log @xmath11 of pairs of subsamples is accomplished by using two versions of gehan s test ( one with permutation variance and the other with hypergeometric variance ) , the logrank , the peto - peto , and the peto - prentice tests .",
    "these tests differ in how the censored points are weighted and consequently have different sensitivities and efficiencies with different distributions and censoring patterns .",
    "the 10@xmath0 m  emission of many galaxies is characterized by an appreciable spatial extent ( @xmath22 0.5 kpc ) , as was stressed by the high - resolution 10@xmath0 m  maps of ho et al .",
    "( 1989 ) and by the small - beam 10@xmath0 m   photometry of devereux ( 1987 ) , wright et al .",
    "( 1988 ) , carico et al .",
    "( 1988 ) , hill , becklin & wynn - williams ( 1988 ) , which is frequently compared with the large - beam iras 12@xmath0 m  fluxes .",
    "thus , log @xmath11 is expected to increase as the beam diameter @xmath13 ( i[bn kpc ) grows .",
    "this is illustrated by the log @xmath11  log @xmath13 plot ( fig .",
    "1 ) . fig .",
    "1 shows that log @xmath11 increases approximately linearly with log @xmath13 up to @xmath23 kpc ( which can be taken as a typical lower limit for the spatial extension of the 10@xmath0 m  emission ) . in order to calculate the linear regression line in this case , in which upper limits on the independent variable are present ,",
    "we have used three methods : the em algorithm , which requires that the functional form of the distribution of the dependent variable about the regression line be specified ( a normal distribution is generally assumed ) , the non - parametric em algorithm with kaplan - meier estimator , suggested by buckley & james ( 1979 ) , and schmitt s method ( see , e.g. , isobe et al . , 1986 ) .",
    "all three methods concur that the slope of the log @xmath11  log @xmath13 relation is 1.7@xmath240.2 , i.e. close to 2 ( the value typical for a constant surface brightness source ) .",
    "more specifically , these considerations hold for the non - seyfert objects , since the 23 seyferts exhibit no significant log @xmath11  log @xmath13 correlation .",
    "this would suggest that the mir emission of seyferts is not so extended as that of the other galaxies .",
    "this issue will be better addressed below in the discussion of the compactness parameter @xmath14 . in the comparison of the log @xmath11 distributions of pairs of galaxy subsamples ,",
    "one should take into account the bias due to the log @xmath11  log @xmath13 relation by comparing subsamples having a similar range of @xmath13-values . in practice , we deem it enough to exclude objects with @xmath25 kpc in order to minimize this bias .",
    "as expected , the compactness parameter @xmath14 shows a tendency to increase with growing @xmath13 . the @xmath14 ",
    "@xmath13 plot is shown in fig .",
    "2 ; in this figure the dashed lines represent a grid of simple galaxy models in which the surface brightness decreases as @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the characteristic radius of the surface brightness distribution .",
    "this plot is similar to that introduced by hill et al .",
    "( 1988 ) , except that in this case we are plotting aperture diameters instead of distances .",
    "seyfert galaxies are characterized by smaller scale sizes ( @xmath27 ) than the norm ; most objects cluster around scale sizes @xmath28 kpc .",
    "also in the analysis of the @xmath14-distributions , we shall exclude the objects with @xmath25kpc .",
    "we define the mir central surface brightness as @xmath29 ( where @xmath30 is expressed in units of solar luminosity per square kpc ) .",
    "the quantity log @xmath30 exhibits no significant correlation with @xmath13 ( see the log @xmath30  log @xmath13 plot illustrated in fig.3 ) , which is consistent with the fact that the 10@xmath0memission is generally extended .",
    "we have verified the absence of correlation by computing the correlation probabilities based on the cox proportional hazard model , on the generalized kendall rank correlation statistics , and on the generalized spearman rank order correlation coefficient . for @xmath31 objects with @xmath32 upper limits on log @xmath30",
    "we have found high probabilities that the btwo variables log @xmath30 and log @xmath13 are independent ( p=0.47 , 0.89 , 0.79 , for the three respective tests ) .",
    "therefore , in comparing the log @xmath30 distributions of pairs of galaxy samples we shall consider all objects irrespective of their @xmath13-values .",
    "the compactness parameter @xmath14 shows a moderate correlation with log @xmath11 and log @xmath30 ( see figs . 4 and 5 ) .",
    "this is essentially due to the fact that the brightest categories of nuclei ( at mir wavelengths )  such as seyferts , hii nuclei , and interacting nuclei  tend to have also more compact emission than the norm .",
    "( this is discussed in detail in the following section . )    for various subsamples table 2 contains the main results of our statistical analysis : the total number @xmath33 of ( detected and undetected ) objects , the number @xmath34 of upper limits ( undetected galaxies ) , the estimated medians , means , and standard deviations @xmath12 of the distribution functions of log @xmath11 ( for @xmath35 kpc ) , log @xmath30 ( for all values of @xmath13 ) , @xmath14 ( for @xmath35 kpc ) .",
    "table 3 gives the numerical outcomes from the comparison of the distributions of many pairs of galaxy subsamples , namely the ( two - tailed ) probabilities p that two data subsets come from the same underlying population . in table 3",
    "we give the mean ( @xmath36 ) , minimum ( @xmath37 ) , and maximum ( @xmath38 ) values of the five probabilities coming out from the application of the five above - mentioned tests .",
    "the statistical significance of the difference between the distributions of two data subsets is at the 100@xmath39(1-p ) per cent level .",
    "these five tests give somewhat different results especially when the data set is small or suffers from heavy censoring .",
    "the main results which can be inferred from an inspection of tables 2 and 3 are discussed below . in all tables",
    "@xmath11 is expressed in units of solar luminosity and @xmath30 in units of solar luminosity per square kpc .",
    "first of all , it is very clear that the seyfert nuclei ( denoted by s in the tables ) are unequivocally the most powerful mir sources , since they have typically greater 10@xmath0 m  luminosities and surface brightnesses than the non - seyfert ones ( non - s ) ( from which we have excluded the objects classed as l / s in order to be conservative ) .",
    "seyferts are also intrinsically brighter at 10@xmath0 m  than the two individual classes of hii region - like ( h ) and liner ( l ) nuclei . our new finding , which indicates an excess mir emission of seyferts with respect to non - seyferts , appears to be consistent with the results of spinoglio and malkan s ( 1989 ) study of an extensive 12@xmath0 m  flux - limited sample of iras sources . emphasizing the use of the iras 12@xmath0 m  flux as a good index of non - stellar emission and as a powerful technique of agn selection",
    ", the two authors found that seyfert galaxies have , on average , higher 12@xmath0mluminosities than non - seyferts .",
    "our analysis provides decisive proof of the predominance of seyferts in the mir emission , since iras beams , being about a few arcmin in size , encompass a substantial fraction of the entire galaxy ( except in very nearby objects ) and are thus less appropriate to the study of galactic nuclear emission .",
    "seyferts are characterized by a much more compact mir emission than the other categories of objects , although in many ( 15 ) seyferts ( 68% ) the compactness parameter @xmath14 is low enough ( @xmath40 ) to indicate the presence of a substantial extended emission .",
    "this result is not appreciably affected by the possible presence of a 9.7@xmath0 m  absorption silicate feature , which would suppress the ground - based 10@xmath0 m  flux proportionally more than the iras 12@xmath0mflux ( because of the wider bandpass of the iras 12@xmath0 m  filter ) .",
    "hill et al .",
    "( 1988 ) have evaluated the amount of the consequent reduction of the compactness parameter @xmath14 for a different spectral index of the power - law continuum of the source and different optical depth at 9.7@xmath0 m . according to their calculations , for a quite negative spectral index ( i.e. @xmath41 with n=2 ) ,",
    "the effect is a 13% and 24% decrease of c for @xmath42=1 and 2 , respectively ( greater spectral indices lead to smaller effects )",
    ". the observations of the mir spectra of galactic nuclei show that most of the galaxies having this silicate absorption band , which is thought to arise in dusty regions fairly close to the central source , are type 2 seyferts ( roche et al . , 1991 ) ,",
    "for which @xmath43 is a typical value ( e.g. , roche et al . , 1984 ) .",
    "even if we hypothesize an underestimation of the parameter @xmath14 by 25% for all the seyferts of our sample which are not classed as seyferts 1 , we still find 13 objects ( 59% ) with fairly low @xmath14 ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "this indicates that extended thermal mir emission from dust warmed by hot stars in the outer regions ( beyond @xmath10.5 kpc from the center ) is important in the majority of seyferts , in agreement with the abundance of hii regions ( in the galactic disks ) which are observed in optical emission - line surveys ( e.g. , pogge , 1989 ) .",
    "interestingly , both the subset of far - infrared luminous galaxies ( of the iras bright galaxy sample ) observed by carico et al .",
    "( 1988 ) in the near- and mid - infrared and the sample of 19 iras luminous galaxies , observed by wynn - williams & becklin ( 1993 ) in several mir bands , exhibit , on average , somewhat more compact 10@xmath0 m  emission than our sample of seyferts .",
    "according to carico et al .",
    "( 1988 ) , who compared their own small - beam 10@xmath0mmeasures with the iras 12@xmath0 m  fluxes , half of these galaxies have 10@xmath0 m  emission consistent with a contribution of 50% or more from a central point source .",
    "wynn - williams & beckin ( 1993 ) , who measured directly the compactness at @xmath112@xmath0 m  and @xmath125@xmath0 m  through observations made with filters centered just at these two wavelengths , foundb @xmath44 for all galaxies ( at both wavelengths ) . the great compactness of the mir emission of these infrared bright galaxies may be related to their particularly great infrared luminosities , with which the degree of compactness is found to correlate ( carico et al . , 1988 ) .",
    "the great predominance of seyferts in mir emission is consistent with their well - known strong predominance in near - infrared emission ( e.g. , glass & moorwood , 1985 ) , in radio continuum emission ( e.g. , ulvestad , wilson & sramek , 1981 ; giuricin , mardirossian & mezzetti , 1988b ) , and in soft x - ray emission ( e.g. , kriss , canizares & ricker , 1980 , and giuricin et al . , 1991 for seyferts 1 and 2 respectively ) .",
    "furthermore , the iras data indicate that the markarian seyferts exhibit also an excess of 25@xmath0 m  flux with respect to the markarian starbursts galaxies ( hunt , 1991 ) . on the contrary ,",
    "the far - infrared luminosities of these two classes of objects are similar ( rodriguez - espinosa , rudy & jones , 1987 ; dahari & de robertis , 1988 ) .      among the non - seyferts ( from which we have excluded the objects classed as l / s ) the interacting objects ( denoted by int in the tables ) exhibit greater values of @xmath11 and @xmath30 in general than the non - interacting ( non - int ) galaxies , in qualitative agreement with earlier results ( lonsdale et al . , 1984 ; cutri & mcalary , 1985 ; wright et al . , 1988 ) . however , these studies tend to be biased towards the most extreme cases of strong interactions and do not properly include the upper limits in their analysis ; therefore , they tend to overestimate the @xmath11 differences between the interacting and non - interacting galaxies .",
    "for instance , wright et al . (",
    "1988 ) reported a ratio of @xmath2210 between the @xmath11 averages of the two categories , whilst our table 2 gives a ratio of @xmath12 only ( @xmath11.7 for the @xmath30 averages ) .",
    "in addition , we are able to explore the effects of interactions on the intensity of the mir emission separately for the two classes of liner and hii region - like nuclei . tables 2 and 3 reveal that the difference between the interacting and non - interacting liners ( denoted by int ( l ) and non - int ( l ) respectively ) is considerable in the case of the @xmath30 distributions ( it is small in the case of the @xmath11 distributions for @xmath35 kpc , because of poor statistics ) . on the other side ,",
    "the interacting and non - interacting hii nuclei ( denoted by int ( h ) and non - int ( h ) ) differ very little in the @xmath11 distributions and not at all in the @xmath30 .",
    "we have verified that the reason for this behaviour of the hii nuclei stems from the fact that the @xmath11-values of the interacting hii nuclei generally refer to greater @xmath13-values than the non - interacting do .",
    "( the median values of a are 0.71 kpc and 0.60 kpc , respectively . ) on the reasonable hypothesis that a discrete number of the unclassified nuclei hosted in late - type spirals are likely to be hii nuclei , we have tried to improve the statistics by adding to our sample of hii nuclei all unclassified galaxies of type sc and later .",
    "this enlarged data sample confirms the marginal difference between the @xmath11 distributions of the interacting and non - interacting objects ( denoted by int ( h+late ) and non - int ( h+late ) respectively in tables 2 and 3 ) and the absence of difference in the @xmath30 distributions .",
    "hence , some interaction - induced enhancement of the mir emission in hii nuclei may be caused by a spread of the mir emission over a somewhat larger area ( which may be due to an enlargement of starburst regions ) rather than to an increase in the central mir surface brightness , as occurs in the case of interacting liners .",
    "notably , the difference in the interaction effects on the mir emission of the two categories of nuclei bears considerable similarity with the interaction - induced enhancement of the central radio emission of liner and hii nuclei ( see giuricin et al . ,",
    "1990 ) .",
    "interacting objects also exhibit more compact mir emission than non - interacting ones .",
    "this holds for both hii and liner nuclei .",
    "this finding specifies that the interaction - induced enhancement of the mir emission concerns preferentially the central galactic regions rather than the outer disc regions ( as first suspected by lonsdale et al .",
    "( 1984 ) ) , although the compactness parameter @xmath14 is great ( @xmath45 ) only in eight ( 18% ) interacting objects .",
    "the increased compactness of the 10@xmath0 m  emission of interacting objects agrees with the similar behaviour of various indices of star formation activity : h@xmath20 line emission ( bushouse , 1987 ) , radio emission ( hummel , 1981b ; condon et al . , 1982 ) , far - infrared emission ( bushouse , 1987 ) , and near - infrared emission ( joseph et al . , 1984 ; cutri & mcalary , 1985 ) ; in the latter case the effect was found to be detectable in hii nuclei only ( giuricin et al . , 1993 ) .",
    "all these results are generally taken as an indication that current star formation activity ( induced by interactions ) preferentially occurs in and near the nuclear regions of galaxies rather than in their outer disk regions ( see also laurikanien & moles , 1989 and the review by heckman , 1990 ) .",
    "the hii nuclei tend to display greater values of @xmath11 and @xmath30 than the extensive sample of the unclassified nuclei ( denoted by unc in tables 2 and 3 ) , which also comprises the few objects classed as l / h and t. on the other hand , the liners have @xmath11 and @xmath30 distributions similar to those of the unclassified nuclei . in agreement with these results",
    ", a straightforward comparison between the hii and liner nuclei reveals that the former category has typically greater values of @xmath11 and @xmath30 than the latter .",
    "this holds also for the two respective subsets of non - interacting objects alone .",
    "our results suggest that the mir luminosity of liners is indistinguishable from that of normal ( emission - line free ) nuclei ( which probably dominate the category of unclassified nuclei ) , in disagreement with the contention of willner et al .",
    "( 1985 ) , who claimed that liners are more luminous than normal at @xmath110@xmath0 m on the basis of fewer objects .",
    "furthermore , our results indicate that the starburst phenomenon leads to an appreciable increase in mir emission , although the effect is certainly smaller than that related to seyferts .    unlike some previous contentions ( devereux , 1987 )",
    ", the mir emission of hii nuclei does not turn out to be typically more compact that that of liner and unclassified objects .",
    "( table 3 shows that the @xmath14 distributions of these three categories of objects do not differ significantly . )",
    "interestingly , a specific comparison between hii nuclei and liner nuclei leads to a strong difference in the same sense for radio continuum luminosities ( giuricin , mardirossian & mezzetti , 1988a ; giuricin et al . , 1988b ) and for the sizes of their central radio sources ( giuricin et al . , 1990 ; hummel et al . , 1990",
    ") . it also leads to a weak difference in the opposite sense for the near - infrared luminosities ( in the j , h , k bands ) of their central ( @xmath11 kpc diameter ) ( giuricin et al . ,",
    "furthermore , the near - infrared data of a sample of hii and liner nuclei compiled by the latter authors show normal near - infrared colours ( which are fully explainable in terms of emission from late - type evolved stars ) for liner nuclei , but strong redward deviations from the norm of the colour indices k - l of a subset of hii nuclei hosted in interacting galaxies .",
    "redder near - infrared colours than normal are usual results of near - infrared photometric observations of far - infrared ( iras ) bright galaxies ( moorwood , vron - cetty & glass , 1986 , 1987 ; carico et al . , 1986 , 1988 , 1990 ) , of interacting galaxies ( joseph et al . , 1984 ; cutri & mcalary , 1985 ; lutz , 1992 ) , and of prominent starburst nuclei ( lawrence et al . , 1985 ; devereux , 1989 ) ; but there is as yet no consensus about the interpretation of this ( as discussed in giuricin et al . , 1993 ) . in the soft x - ray band ( @xmath10.5 - 4 kev )",
    "galaxies with hii and liner nuclei exhibit emissions of comparable strengths ( giuricin et al . , 1991 ) .",
    "among the non - seyfert galaxies , early - type spirals ( sb and earlier , denoted by early in tables 2 and 3 ) turn out to be slightly brighter at @xmath110@xmath0 m  than late - type ones ( sbc and later , denoted by late in tables 2 and 3 ) by an average factor of @xmath11.7 in @xmath11 and @xmath11.4 in @xmath30 ; this occurs notwithstanding the preference of the hii nuclei to be hosted in late - type spirals , which would lead to the opposite tendency ( and despite the comparable frequency of occurrence of interacting objects in the early and late morphological intervals ) .",
    "we have verified that the same tendency holds for the subsets of unbarred ( or barred ) galaxies alone ( although its statistical significance becomes quite low because of poor statistics ) .",
    "this small tendency was already implicit in the data sample by devereux et al .",
    "( 1987 ) and devereux ( 1987 ) .",
    "this effect is certainly too large to be ascribed to a somewhat larger 10@xmath0 m  flux contribution of bulge population stars , if this contribution is taken to be @xmath110% of the flux measured in the standard h band ( at @xmath11.65@xmath0 m ) , according to the estimates of impey , wynn - williams & becklin ( 1986 ) and the relevant discussion of devereux et al .",
    "( 1987 ) .",
    "early - type spirals show much more compact emission than late - type ones .",
    "( we have verified that this tendency holds for all bar types . )    owing to the negligible stellar emission at mir wavelengths , our new finding can not be a trivial result of the prominence of bulges in early - type spirals , which accounts for a similar difference in the central near - infrared luminosities of early- and late - type spirals ( see , e.g. , devereux et al . , 1987 ) .",
    "our finding is likely to be more closely linked with the results of the radio surveys of extensive samples of generic spiral galaxies .",
    "these reveal that early - type spirals contain stronger and more compact central radio sources than late - type objects ( hummel , 1981a ; van der hulst , crane & keel , 1981 ) .",
    "this difference is not confirmed in the recent study by hummel et al .",
    "( 1990 ) , probably because their sample , being restricted to galaxies having liner or hii nuclei , is skewed towards galaxies with hii nuclei ( which are stronger radio sources than the norm and which occur mostly in late - type spirals ) . incidentally , early - type spirals appear to have far - infrared luminosities similar to those of late - type ones ( isobe & feigelson , 1992 ) .      comparing the @xmath11 distribution functions of barred and unbarred spirals via the kolmogorov - smirnov test ( e.g. , hoel , 1971 ) , in which upper limits on @xmath11 were replaced simply by detections , devereux ( 1987 ) realized that barred spirals are typically brighter than unbarred ones in the early - type range ( sb and earlier ) , whereas no bar effect was observed in the later types .",
    "our survival analysis of non - seyfert galaxies ( classed as sa and sb ) confirms the existence of this bar effect in the whole morphological sequence .",
    "but , trying several morphological type subdivisions , we have found that this bar effect is due essentially to the types sb , sbc , sc ( i.e. t=3 , 4 , 5 ) at variance with devereux ( 1987 ) claims ; as a matter of fact , we have verified that in other type intervals ( such as t@xmath33 , t@xmath34 , t@xmath35 , t@xmath223 , t@xmath224 , t@xmath225 ) this bar effect is weaker and sometimes statistically not significant . including the transition bar - type sx into the category of barred ( sb ) galaxies , we have verified that unbarred spirals are fainter than sb+sx objects ( in the whole morphological sequence and in the sb , sbc , sc range ) .",
    "interestingly , we have verified that this bar effect is no longer significant if we exclude the galaxies with hii nuclei from our sample ( the two respective subsamples are denoted by sa ( non - h ) and sb ( non - h ) in tables 2 and 3 ) , whilst it becomes only a little less significant or almost equally significant if we exclude the interacting galaxies or the liners from our sample .",
    "this suggests that the association of bars with enhanced 10@xmath0 m  emission holds mostly for hii nuclei .    the spatial distribution of the mir emission appears to be more compact in barred galaxies ( sb and sb+sab ) than in unbarred ones ( sa ) in the whole morphological range and in the types sb , sbc , sc ; again , as in our previous discussion on log @xmath11 and log @xmath30 , we have verified that the bar effect on the compactness of the emission is substantially due to the types sb , sbc , sc , in disagreement with devereux ( 1987 ) , who stressed the predominance of compact emission in the early types .",
    "analogously , barred spirals tend to have more powerful central radio sources than unbarred systems ( hummel , 1981a ) ; later , it was specified that this effect is substantially confined to galaxies with hii region - like nuclei only ( giuricin et al . , 1990 ; hummel et al . , 1990 ) , which is consistent with our results .",
    "no bar effect was found in the near - infrared colours j - h and h - k and in the near - infrared luminosities @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 of the central regions of non - seyfert spirals ( giuricin et al . , 1993 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the studies of iras data have yielded discordant results . on the basis of a far - infrared selected galaxy sample , hawarden et al .",
    "( 1986 ) found that barred spirals ( which do not host a liner or seyfert nucleus ) have enhanced far - infrared luminosities as well as luminosity ratios @xmath49 and @xmath50 with respect to unbarred spirals .",
    "bothun et al .",
    "( 1989 ) found similar far - infrared luminosities for optically - selected barred and unbarred spirals .",
    "lastly , analyzing a volume - limited sample of optically - selected nearby spirals , isobe & feigelson ( 1992 ) claimed that barred spirals have , on average , fainter far - infrared luminosities than unbarred ones .",
    "we have examined the effects of the ring types of the standard morphology classification reported in the rc3 catalogue , comparing the @xmath11 and @xmath30 distributions of the s(r ) spirals ( which possess inner rings ) , the unringed s(s ) spirals ( with s - shaped arms ) , the s(rs ) ( transition type ) spirals ( denoted respectively by sr , st , ss in our tables 2 and 3 ) .",
    "no significant effect was found in the non - seyfert nuclei ( tables 2 and 3 report some results ) .",
    "incidentally , isobe & feigelson ( 1992 ) claimed that s(r ) galaxies have weaker far - infrared luminosities than average .",
    "the results of our detailed comparison between the behaviour of various categories of objects clearly emphasize that the 10@xmath0 m  emission is particularly closely linked to the radio continuum emission , which in non - seyferts is predominantly non - thermal synchrotron emission coming from supernova remnants mostly .",
    "hence , our study , based on a wide sample of data , provides a meanigful , strong support for previous similar claims based on a detailed comparison of the mir and radio maps of a few , well - observed galaxies ( e. g. , telesco , 1988 ; ho et al . , 1989 ) , at resolution of several arcsec ( corresponding to several hundreds pc ) ; however , the mir - radio correlation seems to become weaker at the smallest spatial scales ( @xmath3100 pc ) currently reachable at mir wavelengths in very nearby galaxies ( see , e.g. , the high resolution mir maps of telesco & gezari , 1982 , and pia et al . , 1992 for m82 and n253 , respectively ) . for non -",
    "agns the latter fact would favour mechanisms of thermal emission by small dust grains transiently heated radiatively by newly formed , hot stars rather than heated by shocks in supernova remnants ( see , e.g. , telesco & gezari , 1982 , and ho et al . , 1989 for the two alternative views , respectively ) .",
    "the grain size distribution is thought to be altered towards the smallward from the norm through mechanisms of destruction of the largest grains by grain - grain collisions in interstellar shocks driven by supernova remnants , although observational evidence for the occurring of this process in galactic supernova remnants is far from being ubiquitous ( e.g. , the review by dwek & arendt , 1992 ) .",
    "some observational evidence consistent with a population of transiently heated small grains ( probably depleted in the most intense areas of starbursts ) comes out from the spatial variation of mir colour indices across the central regions of m82 ( telesco , decher & joy , 1989 ) and n253 ( pia et al . ,",
    "1992 ) , from the anomalously high 10@xmath0m - to  thermal radio flux ratio ( e.g. , wynn - williams & becklin , 1985 ) , and from the frequent presence of uir emission bands in the nuclear mir spectra of starburst nuclei ( roche et al . , 1991 ) .",
    "the uir bands are generally attributed to emission by small grains or large molecules , like the polyciclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) molecules ( e.g. , the review by puget & lger ( 1989 ) ) ; the uir features are often absent in agns ( roche et al . , 1991 ) , probably because they are destroyed by the intense hard ( euv and x - rays ) radiation field from the central source ( voit , 1991 , 1992 ) .",
    "it is known that the 10@xmath0 m  emission of galactic nuclei correlates with the radio continuum emission ( e.g. , telesco , 1988 ) , with the near - infrared emission ( e.g. , cutri & mcalary , 1985 ; devereux , 1989 ; lutz , 1992 ) , and with the far - infrared emission ( at least for objects believed to be powered by starbursts ; see , e.g. , scoville et al . , 1983 ; telesco , 1988 ) .",
    "in this subsection we wish to explore whether it correlates also with the x - ray emission in seyferts , whose x - ray emission is generally dominated by a bright nuclear source .",
    "this issue has been very little discussed in the literature .",
    "we have gathered together the soft x - ray fluxes @xmath51 of the seyferts observed with the `` einstein observatory '' satellite ( in common with our sample ) from the compilation of fabbiano , kim & trinchieri ( 1992 ) ( and references cited therein ) .",
    "most of these x - ray data were obtained with the image proportional counter instrument and in their catalogue were converted into 0.2 - 4 kev fluxes . in the case of multiple entries for a galaxy",
    "we have adopted the mean values of the fluxes @xmath51 .",
    "owing to the presence of upper limits on the mir data and to the smallness of the sample , we have used the cox ( c ) and kendall ( k ) correlation tests ( mentioned in  3 ) in order to compute the correlation probabilities between the fluxes @xmath8 and @xmath51 for 14 seyferts ( n1068 , n1365 , n1386 , n2992 , n3227 , n3783 , n4051 , n4151 , n4388 , n4639 , n5506 , n6814 , n7213 , n7582 ) .",
    "we found no significant correlations .",
    "6 shows the log @xmath8  log @xmath51 plot .",
    "the study of the relation between the central mir and the soft x - ray relation may be plagued by the fact that in some seyferts the x - ray fluxes probably refer to a region larger than the area encompassed by the small - beam mir observations .",
    "observations with high spatial resolution in x - rays would be required to test adequately the mir  x - ray correlation .",
    "furthermore , internal obscuration of soft x - rays may be a potential source of considerable scatter in the correlation for both galaxy samples .",
    "but this is a minor problem , if it is true that x - ray bright agns suffer , on average , less internal obscuration than x - ray faint objects do ( see , e.g . , reichert et al.,1985 ; turner & pounds,1989 ) , perhaps because high - luminosity nuclei make a more hostile environment for absorbing matter .    compared to soft x - rays , hard x - rays suffer little attenuation by interstellar matter and are good indicators of non - thermal emission because rapid variability and energy arguments imply that they originate very near the central engine .",
