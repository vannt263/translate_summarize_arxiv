    "infrared wavelengths hold the key to understanding the evolution of galaxies . from the spectrum of the extragalactic background radiation ( hauser and dwek 2001 ) we see that much of the light emitted by stars is absorbed by dust and",
    "reemitted at mid and far infrared wavelengths . only by understanding infrared extragalactic populations",
    "can we hope to get a reliable census of the star formation history of galaxies and estimate the fraction of dust - obscured agn .",
    "the spitzer swire legacy survey has detected over 2 million infrared galaxies in 49 sq deg of sky ( lonsdale et al 2003 , 2004 ) .",
    "this will be especially powerful for searches for rare objects and for systematic studies of the link between star formation history and large - scale stucture .",
    "reliable catalogues have now been delivered to ssc for all the 6 survey areas ( surace et al 2005 ) .",
    "rowan - robinson et al ( 2005 ) reported work on optical associations , sed modelling , photometric redshifts and redshift distributions for swire sources . to model the seds of swire sources",
    "we have used an approach similar to that of rowan - robinson et al ( 2004 ) for elais sources .",
    "the optical data and near infrared data to 4.5 @xmath0 m are fitted with one of the 8 optical galaxy templates used in the photometric redshift code of rowan - robinson ( 2003 ) , 6 galaxy templates ( e , sab , sbc , scd , sdm , sb ) and 2 agn templates ( rowan - robinson et al 2004 ) .",
    "the mid and far infrared data are fitted by a mixture of the 4 infrared templates used by rowan - robinson ( 2001 ) in models for infrared and submillimetre source - counts : cirrus , m82 starburst , arp 220 starburst and agn dust torus . for each of these templates",
    "we have detailed radiative transfer models ( cirrus : eftstathiou and rowan - robinson 2003 , m82 and arp 220 starbursts : eftstathiou et al 2000 , agn dust tori : rowan - robinson 1995 , efstathiou and rowan - robinson 1995 ) .",
    "the approach here is to try to understand the overall spitzer galaxy population .    here",
    "we report on subsequent work on some interesting samples .",
    "fig 1 ( l ) shows seds for a sample of swire - elais galaxies for which we have irs spectroscopy ( perez - fournon et al , 2006 , in prep .",
    ", hernan - caballero et al 2006 ) .",
    "1 ( r ) shows seds for a sample of swire - shades sources detected at 850 @xmath0 m with scuba ( clements et al , 2006 , in prep . ) . for the irs sample ,",
    "selected to be bright at 15 @xmath0 m , we find that a large fraction of the sources are dominated by an agn dust torus in the mid - ir .",
    "however an interesting subset show pah features or strong silicate absorption .",
    "the 850 @xmath0 m sources show a wide variety of ir templates , including luminous cirrus components , and both m82 and arp 220 starbursts , as well as several cases dominated by an agn dust torus in the mid - ir .",
    "we also find a wide range of redshifts , with a median redshift of 1.75 and 20@xmath1 of the sample at z @xmath5 1 .",
    "the striking features that emerge from this modelling are that the seds can at least broadly be understood in terms of a small number of infrared templates .",
    "radiative transfer codes have several parameters and even better fits could be found by using the full range of models of efstathiou et al ( 2000 ) , eftstathiou and rowan - robinson ( 2003 ) .",
    "there is excellent agreement between the irs and swire data and good consistency with the template predictions .",
    "rowan - robinson et al ( 2005 ) reported a photometric redshift analysis for two swire samples , the 0.3 sq deg area of lockman - vf and 6.5 sq deg in elais - n1 , based on the methods of rowan - robinson ( 2003 ) , babbedge et al ( 2004 ) . here",
    "we show a comparison of @xmath6 with @xmath7 for the swire - vvds sample ( fig 2(l ) ) , which yields over 1300 reliable spectroscopic redshifts for swire galaxies ( lefevre et al 2005 , ilbert et al 2006 ) . and",
    "for the whole swire - lockman area ( fig 2 ( r ) ) , in which we have carried out a substantial programme of spectroscopy with keck , gemini - n and wiyn ( smith et al , 2006 , in prep .",
    ", owen et al , 2006 , in prep . ) .    when including 3.6 and 4.5 @xmath0 m data in the solution we find accuracies of @xmath8 in ( 1+z ) , compared with 10 @xmath1 using optical data , and a reduced number of outliers ( 2@xmath1 ) .",
    "the number of optical photometric bands is clearly also a factor . for much of the lockman area",
    "we have only gri data available .",
    "figure 3 ( l ) shows the redshift distributions for swire - n1 sources with s(3.6 ) @xmath9 10 @xmath0jy , above which the swire survey is relatively complete , with a breakdown into elliptical , spiral + starburst and quasar seds based on the photometric redshift fits .",
    "subsequent to the analysis of rowan - robinson et al ( 2005 ) , we have ( 1 ) improved that processing of agn to include the possibility of qsos with significant extinction , ( 2 ) relaxed the requirements on the code to take account of sources with very weak or no optical data ( by using irac 5.8 and 8 @xmath0 m data for these sources ) .",
    "for comparison we show in the top panel the predictions of rowan - robinson ( 2001 ) .",
    "ellipticals cut off sharply at z @xmath10 1.4 .",
    "spirals also cut off at @xmath10 1,5 but there is an extended tail of sources to z @xmath10 4 .",
    "10@xmath1 of swire galaxies have z@xmath92 and 4@xmath1 have z@xmath93 .",
    "the photometric estimates of redshift for agn are more uncertain than those for galaxies , due to aliassing problems , but the code is effective at identifying type 1 agn from the optical and near ir data .",
    "for some quasars there is significant torus dust emission in the 3.6 and 4.5 @xmath0 m bands , so inclusion of these bands in photometric redshift determination can make the fit worse rather than better .",
    "we have therefore omitted the 3.6 and 4.5 @xmath0 m bands if s(3.6)/s(r ) @xmath9 3 .",
    "note that only 5 @xmath1 of swire sources are identified by the photometric redshift code as type 1 agn , and of these only 5@xmath1 are found to have @xmath11 .",
    "for sources detected at 70 or 160 @xmath0 m , or with an infrared excess at 4.5 - 24 @xmath0 m , relative to the template used for photometric redshift fitting , in at least two bands ( one of which we require to be 8 or 24 @xmath0 m ) , we have determined the best - fitting out of cirrus , m82 starburst , arp220 starburst or agn dust torus infrared templates ( cf rowan - robinson et al 2005 ) . from the experience of modeling iras sources",
    "( eg rowan - robinson and crawford 1989 ) , confirmed by the sed modeling described in section 3 , we allow ( a ) a mixture of cirrus and m82 templates , ( b ) a mixture of agn dust torus and m82 templates , or ( c ) an arp 220 template ( using a mixture of agn dust torus plus a220 template did not improve the @xmath12 distribution ) .",
    "we can estimate the bolometric luminosity corresponding to the infrared template and to the optical template used for photometric redshift determination .",
    "figure 3(r ) and 4 shows the ratio of bolometric infrared to optical luminosity , @xmath13 , versus bolometric infrared luminosity , @xmath14 for cirrus , starburst and agn dust tori .    for cirrus galaxies with @xmath15 , a significant fraction of the infrared emission is reemission of starlight absorbed by ( optically thin ) interstellar dust , so @xmath2 should be interpreted as the optical depth of the interstellar dust .",
    "many very low values of @xmath2 ( @xmath5 0.2 ) are due to elliptical galaxies with a small amount of star - formation .",
    "however there is also an interesting population of luminous and ultraluminous cirrus galaxies , with @xmath16 ( rowan - robinson et al 2004 , 2005 ) .",
    "7 @xmath1 of the cirrus galaxies identified in the n1 area",
    "have @xmath17 and 2 @xmath1 have @xmath18 .",
    "the implications are that ( 1 ) the quiescent phase of star formation was significantly more luminous in the past ( as assumed in the count models of rowan - robinson 2001 ) , ( 2 ) the dust opacity of the interstellar medium in galaxies was higher at z @xmath10 1 , as expected from galaxy models with star - formation histories that peak at z = 1 - 2 ( pei et al 1999 , calzetta and heckaman 1999 , rowan - robinson 2003 ) .    for star - forming galaxies",
    "the parameter @xmath2 can be interpreted as approximately @xmath19 , since @xmath20 and @xmath21 , i.e. as @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the time - scale in yrs to accumulate the present stellar mass , forming stars at the current rate ( @xmath24 is the specific star formation rate ) .",
    "the galaxies with arp 220 templates tend to have high values of @xmath2 , consistent with the idea that they have lower @xmath23 .",
    "m82 type starbursts are less extreme and range over rather similar values of @xmath3 and @xmath2 to the cirrus galaxies .    for agn dust tori ( blue points in fig 5r ) ,",
    "the ratio @xmath2 can be interpreted ( for type 1 agn ) as the covering factor of the torus .",
    "most have values in the range 0.03 - 0.5 , with a median value @xmath10 0.1 .",
    "if we restrict attention to sources with @xmath25 , we find that one third have qso optical seds , while two thirds have galaxy optical seds , implying that the type 1 : type 2 ratio is 2:1 .",
    "further discussion of swire quasars is given by franceschini et al ( 2005 ) , hatziminaoglou et al ( 2005 , 2006 ) , polletta et al ( 2006 ) .",
    "5@xmath1 of 24 @xmath0 m sources have extremely high infrared luminosities , in the hyperluminous class ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "clearly spectroscopy is needed to determine these redshifts more accurately .",
    "the ir templates can be used to predicted fluxes at longer wavelengths .",
    "fig 5 ( l ) shows predicted fluxes at 70 @xmath0 m , derived from template fits to 3.6 - 24 @xmath0 m data , compared with the observed mips fluxes .",
    "the agreement is remarkably good .",
    "fig 5 ( r ) shows predicted fluxes at 350 @xmath0 m versus redshift for swire - n1 sources .",
    "figures 6 and 7 show the differential counts at 24 and 160 @xmath0 m observed by swire ( shupe et al 2006 , afonso luis et al 2006 ) , compared with new models developed from the approach of rowan - robinson ( 2001 ) .",
    "these new models allow separate rates of evolution for each component ; while similar histories are found for cirrus , m82 starbursts and agn dust tori , the arp 220 population requires significantly steeper evolution to fit the counts , implying a more dramtic evolution for these extreme objects .",
    "babbedge et al ( 2006 ) have derived luminosity functions at 3.6 - 24 @xmath0 m , using the swire - n1 photometric redshifts ( fig 8) .",
    "the evolution of the 3.6 @xmath0 m luminosity function is consistent with the passive evolution of starlight , but the evolution at 24 @xmath0 m implies strong evolution of the star - formation history between z = 0 and 1 ."
