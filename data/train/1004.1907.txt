    "quantum computers are believed to be more powerful than their classical counterpart , resulting in tremendous efforts to implement quantum computation with different physical systems .",
    "the model of one - way quantum computer @xcite has opened a novel approach towards the possible experimental realization of quantum computation . in the one - way model ,",
    "quantum computation starts from preparing certain universal resource states , namely the cluster states @xcite , and is achieved by merely performing single - qubit measurements on these states .",
    "the principal task turns out to be the preparation of these highly entangled resource states .",
    "one straightforward way is to apply entangling gates to couple a lattice of qubits @xcite .",
    "it is however clearly appealing if there exists a universal resource as the unique ground state of a naturally occurring gapped two - body local hamiltonian , for the advantage of flexible state preparation as well as the stability against the local perturbations .",
    "recall that the cluster states can not occur as a non - degenerate ground state of any two - local spin-@xmath1 hamiltonian @xcite , and have singular entanglement features , e.g. vanishing two - point correlation functions @xcite .",
    "perturbative hamiltonians have been proposed with ( encoded ) graph states as the approximate ground states @xcite , which however require a highly precise control over system parameters and the spectral gap would get significantly smaller according to the order of the perturbation .",
    "recently , a gapped two - body hamiltonian of six - level particles @xcite has been constructed with the so called tri - cluster state as its unique ground state , which is universal for measurement - based quantum computation . here , we construct a new type of gapped local hamiltonian , with the constitutional two - body affleck - kennedy - lieb - tasaki ( aklt ) @xcite and exchange - type interactions acting on four - level particles .",
    "the simplicity of the hamiltonian might allow one to identify possible realizations in models of condensed matter systems or in quantum optical set - ups .",
    "the present approach differs from the previously used methods to construct a parent hamiltonian for projected entangled pair states by finding the local support subspace @xcite , but can be utilized to construct a family of local hamiltonians with the same properties .    in this paper , motivated by the usage of the gapped ground state of the 1d aklt spin-1 chain as a universal quantum wire @xcite ( cf.@xcite )",
    ", we start from 1d _ quasi - chain _ of spin @xmath0 particles as a building block .",
    "from there we construct a full 2d resource that allows a deterministic decoupling of the 1d quantum wire structure ( in the similar way as the cluster state ) . after proving that the 1d quasi - chain is gapped with an unique ground state",
    ", we construct a gapped two - body hamiltonian on an octagonal 2d lattice , which is transitionally invariant , and consists of only nearest neighbor aklt- together with exchange - type interactions .",
    "we demonstrate how to implement universal quantum computation by simply making single - spin measurements on the individual four - level particles of its unique ground state .",
    "this hamiltonian provides the example that can be utilized as a complete measurement - based ground - code quantum computer without the demand of dynamical coupling @xcite .",
    "extensions of our approach to the other geometric configurations , e.g. 2d lattice , or other hamiltonians are also possible .",
    "we first consider the 1d aklt model defined on the quasi - chain as in fig .",
    "[ qcha ] and show that the model is gapped and has a unique ground state .",
    "the quasi - chain consists of spin-@xmath0 ( a ) and spin-@xmath2 particles ( b ) coupled with nearest - neighbor two - body interactions @xmath3 \\label{chainhamil}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 represents the projector onto the spin - s irreducible representation of the total spin for particles @xmath5 and @xmath6 ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . as the spin per particle equals to half of the local coordination number ( i.e. the number of the bonds from a particle ) , the 1d aklt quasi - chain in eq .",
    "( [ chainhamil ] ) has an unique ground state @xmath7 @xcite , which can be obtained via a projector which maps the symmetric part of three spin-@xmath1 ( virtual qubits ) of maximally entangled pairs into one spin-@xmath0 physical particle .    to prove that the 1d aklt quasi - chain is gapped in the thermodynamic limit , we first regroup the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ chainhamil ] ) into blocks as @xmath8 , see fig  [ qcha ] , where @xmath9 is the sum of the aklt interactions among the particles inside the block .",
    "we consider the ground state @xmath10 and denote the support subspace of the reduced density matrix corresponding to each block as @xmath11 , and the projector onto the orthogonal subspace by @xmath12 . from @xmath13",
    "it follows that @xmath7 is also the unique ground state of the projective hamiltonian @xmath14 .",
    "one can directly calculate the energy gap @xmath15 of @xmath16 and finds @xmath17 , which leads to @xmath18 we further write the block hamiltonian from @xmath19 on @xmath20 units as @xmath21 . if @xmath22 , the results in @xcite imply that @xmath23 our calculations show that @xmath24 for @xmath25 .",
    "we thus conclude that @xmath19 is gapped as @xmath26 , where better bounds can in principle be obtained for higher @xmath6 .",
    "therefore , the energy gap of the 1d aklt quasi - chain is lower bounded by @xmath27 .",
    "with the above established results for the 1d aklt quasi - chain , we will show how to obtain a model on an octagonal lattice with two - body interactions that is gapped and has a unique ground state .",
    "we start from a number of independent 1d aklt quasi - chains , and introduce the unitary transformation @xmath28 which maps two spin-@xmath1 particles into one spin-@xmath0 particle by @xmath29 where the labels denote @xmath30 respectively .",
    "notice that in principle _ any _ unitary operation can be used at this stage , each leading to a gapped model with a unique ground state that can be used for universal measurement - based computation . using such a transformation , we can merge a number of 1d quasi - chains and get a 2d hamiltonian as @xmath31 with @xmath32 , where @xmath33 denote two neighboring spin-@xmath1 particles in the same merging circle , see fig .",
    "[ conf2d ] .",

    "it is easy to verify that @xmath50 and @xmath51 satisfy the commutation relations analogous to the spin angular momentum .",
    "as @xmath52 is equivalent up to a unitary transformation to @xmath53 independent aklt quasi - chains , the spectrum and the corresponding eigenvalues can be trivially obtained from the spectrum and eigenvalues of @xmath54 . in particular",

    "each logical virtual qubit can be initialized to @xmath63 or @xmath64 by measuring the left end spin-@xmath1 particle in the @xmath65 basis @xmath66 .",
    "quantum computation then proceeds gradually from left to right by measuring each computational block ( @xmath59 , @xmath61 and @xmath44 ) , see figs .",
    "( [ conf2d],[uqc ] ) .    before performing computational measurements on each block",
    ", we need to introduce a _ pre - normalization step _ as follows to equalize the different coefficients ( 1 _ vs. _ @xmath67 ) in the tensor matrices @xmath59 ( @xmath61 ) .",
    "we first apply the local filter operation @xmath68 on sites @xmath59 and @xmath61 with @xmath69 an outcome @xmath70 corresponds to an unsuccessful filter attempt and leads after suitable measurements on sites @xmath71 to the transport of quantum information to the next block up to a local pauli operation @xmath72 or @xmath73 .",
    "the procedure can hence be repeated until it succeeds ( i.e. the outcome @xmath74 occurs ) .",
    "one finds that @xmath75 trials lead to an overall success probability of @xmath76 , i.e. the process is efficient .",
    "the required measurements are given by @xmath77 for site @xmath44 , where @xmath78 for sites @xmath59 and @xmath61 .",
    "in the following , we will assume that the filter operation was successful ( i.e. the result @xmath74 was obtained ) .",
    "we show that a suitable choice of the measurement in @xmath44 allows one to either decouple 1d chains and obtain single - qubit operations or read - out , or alternatively to couple two chains directly and obtain a two - qubit gate .",
    "two chains are decoupled by a measurement of site @xmath44 in the @xmath65 basis @xmath79 , leading to vertical virtual qubits @xmath80 and @xmath81 corresponding to sites @xmath82 respectively ( see fig .  [ uqc ] ) to be prepared into either @xmath83 or latexmath:[$",

    ", we use the effective 1d tensor matrices @xmath43 to show how to implement arbitrary single - qubit rotations following a similar protocol as in @xcite ( note that the effective tensor matrices are not equivalent to the 1d aklt spin-1 chain ) , and read out logical quantum information .",
    "the readout is realized by simply measuring site @xmath43 in the @xmath65 basis @xmath86 .",
    "once we get the outcome @xmath87 , one can infer that the logical qubit is @xmath88 .",
    "otherwise , the logical qubit gets a @xmath89 by - product operator and we repeat the above procedure .",
    "an arbitrary single - qubit operation can be decomposed into three rotations around the @xmath89 and @xmath72 axes with three euler angles . in order to implement a @xmath89 rotation @xmath90 , we measure site @xmath43 in the basis @xmath91",
    "the first outcome is not possible , while the fourth induce a by - product operator @xmath89 .",
    "if however the outcome is the second or third one , we implement the rotation @xmath92 with a pauli by - product operator @xmath72 or @xmath93 .",
    "an @xmath72-rotation @xmath94 is implemented in a similar way .",
    "we apply the local filter operation @xmath68 at the initial pre - normalization step in the @xmath95 basis @xmath96 .",
    "@xmath72 rotations can then be realized by the same protocol as the @xmath89 rotations , only with the exchange of @xmath97 and @xmath95 basis , where the measurement basis on site @xmath44 at the pre - normalization and decoupling step correspondingly changes as @xmath98 .",
    "the basic idea for the implementation of an entangling gate is to prepare the vertical virtual qubits @xmath99 corresponding to sites @xmath59 and @xmath61 , into an entangled state by a suitable measurement of @xmath44 . in order to determine the kind of two - qubit gate that is implemented for different measurement outcomes , we first rewrite the tensor matrices @xmath100 in the aforementioned basis of @xmath101 .",
    "we further define another basis for site @xmath44 as @xmath102",
    "the contracted tensor from @xmath103 $ ] , @xmath104 $ ] and @xmath105 $ ] , results in one of the two - qubit entangling gates @xmath106 where @xmath107 or @xmath108 .",
    "moreover , any pauli by - product operator can propagate through the above entangling gates as @xmath109 , where both @xmath110 and @xmath111 are pauli operators .",
    "the explicit procedure to implement a specific entangling gate is as follows : we first measure site @xmath59 and @xmath61 in the basis @xmath112 ; if the outcomes correspond to the desired entangling gate out of @xmath113 , we proceed to measure site @xmath44 in the basis @xmath114 . otherwise if we do not obtain the desired outcomes from the measurements on site @xmath59 and @xmath61 , we measure site @xmath44 in the @xmath65 basis @xmath115 , which decouples the chains and leads to transport of quantum information to the next block up to a by - product pauli operator",
    ". in this case , we have to repeat the above procedure in order to obtain the target two - qubit gate , but an arbitrary high success probability is achievable efficiently as well .",
    "the present protocol offers the flexibility to choose a two - qubit gate on demand from a set of entangling gates .",
    "if the bulk hamiltonian is maintained during the measurement - based computation as proposed in the ground - code scheme @xcite , the spectral gap appears to provide certain protection again local noises , so that it may make the computer more robust and easier to meet a stringent fault - tolerant error threshold for quantum error correction .",
    "however , potential advantages of the gap in protecting quantum information is currently intensively being studied in the context of the topological memory @xcite . the general question as to",
    "what extent the passive hamiltonian protection is helpful in measurement - based computation , which is far from the equilibrium , is more involved , and addressed elsewhere .",
    "below , we describe the complete scheme with the hamiltonian present .",
    "we first look at the residual hamiltonian of 1d aklt quasi - chain after measuring the first @xmath116 particles , @xmath117\\ ] ] it is gapped and twofold degenerate , which can encode one logical qubit .",
    "one can show that the operators @xmath118^{(a_{i})}\\otimes\\sigma^{(b_{i})}\\}\\otimes \\sigma^{(b_{n+1})}\\ ] ] with @xmath119 form the representation of @xmath120 , and the degenerate ground states are connected only by these non - local operators .",
    "the computation on the 2d resource equips similar robustness , as the hamiltonian of the 2d model is locally unitary equivalent to @xmath53 independent chains . to utilize the gap protection",
    ", one needs to turn off the interactions that couple the computational block ( see fig .  [ uqc ] ) to the bulk together with those inside the block , prior to any measurement for this block . as the hamiltonian @xmath52 is frustration - free ,",
    "this can be done in a constant time .",
    "also particles already measured need to stay decoupled from the remaining bulk .    in a potential implementation of @xmath52 with trapped polar molecules in an optical lattice @xcite",
    ", nearest - neighbor interactions can be turned off by changing the potential depth of local wells which in turn suppresses the tunneling rate between two neighboring wells . an alternative method without turning off interactions",
    "is to apply fast measurements and remove the particle from the system after the measurement , or drive it to a dark state ( which does not interact with neighboring particles anymore ) .",
    "our approach can be extended from the octagonal lattice to the 2d square lattice , for instance .",
    "the corresponding 1d aklt quasi - chain consists of spin-@xmath121 particles , each of which is connected with two spin-@xmath1 particles . in a similar way , we can show that the energy gap is lower bounded by @xmath122 with @xmath123 and @xmath124 .",
    "we can merge a number of such 1d aklt quasi - chains into a 2d resource state as well , and the computational protocol is similar .",
    "we have proposed a novel translational - invariant gapped hamiltonian of spin-@xmath0 particles with nearest - neighbor two - body aklt- and exchange - type interactions .",
    "its unique ground state is proved to be universal for measurement - based quantum computation .",
    "the hamiltonian inherits important properties from the original aklt model , while at the same time , it has distinct features , e.g. a strictly proved energy gap . further study on such a hamiltonian and",
