    "water is one of the most complex liquids , exhibiting many anomalous thermodynamic and dynamical properties ( see e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) . in the glassy state ,",
    "water is also a complex substance  @xcite .",
    "notably , amorphous solid water can be found in at least two different forms , low - density amorphous ice ( lda ) and high - density amorphous ice ( hda ) , having very different properties .",
    "for example , the densities of lda and hda differ by @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "a large number of experiments indicate that lda and hda can be interconverted via many thermodynamic paths , such as isobaric heating and isothermal compression / decompression processes ( see e.g. refs.@xcite ) .",
    "the lda - hda transformation , between properly annealed lda and hda forms , is rather sharp and reversible , and exhibits many of the characteristics of a first - order phase transition  @xcite .",
    "the explanation of this unusual behavior requires answers to fundamental questions of statistical mechanics , such as how to properly define or interpret a `` phase - transition '' between out - of - equilibrium glassy states .    in this work , we address these questions by studying the lda - hda transformations in water , and the relationship of these glasses with the liquid state , using the potential energy landscape ( pel ) approach ( see e.g. ref .",
    "the pel is a statistical mechanical approach that formally separates the configurational contributions to the partition function into contributions from local energy minima (  inherent structures \" ) , and vibrational excitations within the basins of attraction surrounding these minima .",
    "consequently , the pel formalism has been used extensively to study supercooled liquids and glasses  @xcite , and other equilibrium systems  @xcite , where such a separation between vibrational and configurational degrees of freedom arises naturally .",
    "specifically , for a system of @xmath1 particles , the pel is the hyper - surface in @xmath2-dimensional space defined by the potential energy of the system as function of the @xmath3 coordinates , @xmath4 . at any given time @xmath5 ,",
    "the system is represented by a single point in the pel defined by the particle coordinates @xmath6 . as time evolves , the representative point of the system moves , sampling different regions of the pel .",
    "in the pel approach , the thermodynamic  @xcite and dynamic  @xcite properties of the system can be defined in terms of the topography of the pel regions being sampled .",
    "the topography of the pel can be rather complex with comparatively shallow basins residing within deeper and broader  megabasins \"  @xcite . in the case of supercooled liquids ,",
    "the free energy can be expressed in terms of three basic properties of the pel  @xcite : ( i ) the average energy @xmath7 of the inherent structures ( is ) associated with the basins sampled in equilibrium ; ( ii ) the number of is having a given value of @xmath7 ; and , ( iii ) the average curvature of the basins associated with each is .",
    "the behavior of glassy and liquid water are necessarily related , and several scenarios have been proposed to explain their unusual properties within a common framework ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "one of the more widely accepted explanations is based on the idea that lda and hda are the glass counterparts of two liquids , low - density ( ldl ) and high - density liquid ( hdl ) , that are separated by a first - order phase transition  @xcite .",
    "this liquid - liquid phase transition ( llpt ) ends at a liquid - liquid critical point ( llcp ) recently estimated to exist at a temperature @xmath8  k and pressure @xmath9  mpa , based on experiments and theory  @xcite .",
    "the llpt hypothesis was originally proposed on the basis of computer simulations using the st2 water model  @xcite , leaving the validation of the hypothesis for experiments .",
    "unfortunately , crystallization makes experimental verification challenging , and thus the hypothesis remains a point of debate .",
    "however , there is experimental evidence supporting the existence of a llpt in water  @xcite . indeed ,",
    "most of the evidence supporting the llpt hypothesis is from studies involving glassy water .",
    "a llpt has been directly observed in experiments on other substances such as phosphorus  @xcite and cerium  @xcite , demonstrating the possibility of such a scenario .",
    "furthermore , computer simulations of atomistic ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , nanoparticle  @xcite , and molecular systems including modified water models  @xcite have shown the possibility for a llpt in the equilibrium ( as opposed to metastable ) region of the phase diagram , establishing that a llpt can exist as a proper phase transition in the thermodynamic limit .    in order to probe the apparent first - order transitions between lda and hda states",
    ", we employ the st2 model .",
    "this choice is important since , contrary to other models such as the spc / e and mw models  @xcite , the st2 model reproduces the sharp lda - hda transformation observed in experiment .",
    "the behavior of st2 water in glassy states has been recently characterized in detail and it has been shown that it is in qualitative agreement with experiments  @xcite .",
    "specifically , in the case of the st2 model , the density @xmath10 has been observed to change abruptly with little change in the pressure @xmath11 [ _ i.e. _ @xmath12 during the lda - hda transformation ; see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "we explore the lda - hda transformation in st2 water using the pel formalism in order to clarify the thermodynamic differences between the lda and hda forms , and to assess the extent to which it may be appropriate to refer to this transformation as a first - order - like phase transition .",
    "as we show below , our results are consistent with the view that lda and hda occupy distinct megabasins of the pel , and that the transformations between lda and hda exhibit a number of behaviors observed in well - defined equilibrium first - order phase transitions .",

    "this preparation method corresponds to the experimental process used to produce the lda form known as hyperquenched glassy water ( hgw ) , although we use a faster cooling rate than experiments ; see discussions in refs .",
    "our hgw configuration is then compressed isothermally , producing a sample of hda .",
    "the resulting hda form is then decompressed ( at the same temperature @xmath15 ) leading to a new lda sample . when subjected to sufficiently negative pressure ,",
    "this lda sample fractures . in order to compare our hgw sample and the lda form",
    "we obtain by decompression of hda , we also subject the hgw configuration to increasingly negative pressure , starting from @xmath13  mpa , until it also fractures .    our compression / decompression rate is @xmath17  mpa / ns , which leads to sharp lda - hda transformations , as observed experimentally using much slower rates  @xcite . for each compression / decompression temperature",

    "[ pel - ldahda](b ) .",
    "the lda - to - hda transformation during compression at @xmath49  k occurs at a pressure @xmath50 which ranges between @xmath51 and @xmath52  mpa . within the lda regime ( @xmath53 ) and the hda regime ( @xmath54 )",
    ", we note that @xmath11 varies rapidly with @xmath10 and is approximately linear , indicating that in these regimes the system responds to volume changes like a stiff elastic solid .",
    "these elastic regimes correspond to approximately @xmath55 for lda and @xmath56  g/@xmath57 for hda .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ pel - ldahda](b ) , we find that the behavior of @xmath45 in these density ranges is similar to that observed for @xmath48 in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "a significant difference between @xmath48 and @xmath45 is that @xmath11 is a monotonic function of @xmath10 , while @xmath20 is not .",
    "that is , during the lda - to - hda transformation ( occurring in the range @xmath58  g/@xmath57 ) , @xmath45 exhibits a van der waals - like loop reminiscent of a first - order phase transition ; see fig .",
    "[ pel - ldahda](b ) .",
    "this van der waals - like loop in @xmath45 becomes more evident at @xmath59  k [ see fig .  [ pel - ldahdaice](a ) ] , _ i.e_.",
    "as the liquid phase is approached from the glass state , and it vanishes at @xmath60 [ see fig .",
    "[ pel - ldahdaice](b ) ] .",
    "since our system is glassy and therefore not in equilibrium , we can not say that a van der waals loop in @xmath45 indicates a thermodynamic instability . at the same time",

    "we note that for @xmath63  k , these two inequalities become identical , since in this limit @xmath64 because the vibrational contributions to the pressure vanish  @xcite .",
    "we next examine the behavior of @xmath7 during the lda - to - hda transformation at @xmath44  k , shown in fig .",
    "[ pel - ldahda](d ) . in the following analysis",
    "we assume that @xmath7 contributes to @xmath35 as described by eq .",

    "we also note that the inequality @xmath66 identifies conditions at which a system is thermodynamically unstable as a single homogeneous phase . as shown in fig .",
    "[ eis - v ] , the curvature of @xmath7 as a function of @xmath34 is positive in the density ranges associated with the elastic regimes of both lda and hda , consistent with the mechanical stability of the system in these two forms .",
    "however , during the transformation of lda to hda ( in the range @xmath58  g/@xmath57 ) , @xmath7 exhibits a pronounced negative curvature , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath67 . our data for @xmath7 therefore indicate that the influence of the pel on the thermodynamic behavior of the system is to introduce a region of instability between the lda and hda regimes .",
    "we also note that @xmath7 exhibits a weak maximum during the lda - hda transformation .",
    "hence , the present results are consistent with the pel of st2 water containing two megabasins , one for lda and another for hda , separated by _ potential energy _ barriers .",
    "we stress that such barriers separating the lda and hda megabasins are not necessary for the system to become unstable . in other words , as argued in the previous paragraph ( based on eq .",
    "[ fff ] ) , the negative _ curvature _ of @xmath7 ( which does not need to be accompanied by _ potential energy _ barriers ) may be sufficient to introduce an instability [ @xmath66 ] between the lda and hda states .    the behavior of @xmath21 during the lda - to - hda transformation at @xmath44  k is shown in fig .  [ pel - ldahda](f ) . during the elastic compression of lda and hda ( for @xmath55 and @xmath56  g/@xmath57 ) ,",
    "@xmath21 increases monotonically . in other words",
    ", in regimes of elastic deformation , the system explores basins in the pel that become narrower as density increases .",
    "however , the overall behavior of @xmath21 as a function of @xmath34 across the lda - to - hda transformation is non - monotonic . at the beginning of the lda - to - hda transformation",
    ", @xmath21 decreases abruptly , indicating that `` wider '' basins ( relative to lda ) become available to the system in the transformation zone .",

    "[ pel - ldahda](a)-(f ) show three characteristic features of the lda - to - hda transformation in the pel : ( i ) a van der waals - like loop in @xmath20 ; ( ii ) negative curvature in @xmath7 ; and ( iii ) non - monotonic variation of @xmath21 .",
    "these features are all consistent with behavior analogous to a first - order phase transition in an equilibrium system , as we show in sec .",
    "[ liqice ] .",
    "we note that these characteristic features , found here at @xmath71  k , become more pronounced as @xmath15 increases within the range of @xmath15 in which the system remains glassy .",

    "[ pel - ldahda ] , the negative curvature of @xmath7 is less prominent during decompression , and non - monotonic behavior in @xmath20 and @xmath21 is barely observed .",

    "a natural question follows : is the lda - to - hda transformation reversible ? as shown in fig .",
    "[ pel - ldahda ] , the values of @xmath20 , @xmath7 , and @xmath21 at @xmath73  g/@xmath57 for ( a ) the lda ( hgw ) used to initiate the compression runs ( black lines ) and ( b ) the lda recovered from hda via decompression ( red lines ) , are different . while these two lda forms are not identical , as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , both are structurally similar based on the corresponding oo , oh , and hh radial distribution functions . ref .",
    "@xcite argued that both of these lda forms should be considered to be different members of the lda  family \" .",
    "the present results based on the pel approach support this view .",
    "a region of negative curvature in @xmath7 ( accompanied by a weak maximum ) is encountered both during compression and decompression , consistent with the view that these trajectories take the system first from the lda to the hda megabasin , and then back again to the lda megabasin .",
    "however , @xmath7 for the recovered lda is much higher than for the starting lda ( hgw ) ; see figs .",
    "[ pel - ldahda](c ) , [ pel - ldahda](d ) , and [ pel - ldahdaice](c ) for @xmath74  g/@xmath57 .",
    "this difference suggests that the recovered lda form is a highly stressed glass residing higher in the lda megabasin than hgw .",
    "this would not be surprising given the relatively fast compression rates that are accessible in simulations  @xcite . to confirm this interpretation , we subjected both the hgw and the recovered lda forms to large negative pressures , to test if their properties become more similar when they are both brought close to their limits of mechanical tensile stress .",
    "as shown by the blue lines in figs .",
    "[ pel - ldahda ] and  [ pel - ldahdaice ] , the pel properties of hgw do approach more closely those of the recovered lda at negative pressure . also consistent with this view",
    ", we show in the appendix that @xmath46 for hgw and recovered lda become closer to one another when the compression / decompression rate is reduced .",
    "in a previous work , a similar pel study of the lda - hda transformation in water was carried out using the spc / e model  @xcite .",
    "the computer simulation protocol followed in ref .",
    "@xcite is similar to the procedure used in the present work . in particular , both studies employ the same compression / decompression and cooling rates , which is crucial for a proper comparison .",
    "the main difference between the spc / e and st2 models is that a llpt is accessible in ( metastable ) equilibrium simulations of st2 water  @xcite while it is not in spc / e water via ordinary molecular dynamics simulations .",
    "earlier studies  @xcite suggested that a llpt may be present in spc / e water at very low @xmath15 , but it is not accessible at the available computational time scales . in short , ref .",
    "@xcite describes the pel properties explored during the lda - hda transformation if the llpt is not accessible to simulations .",
    "the present study corresponds to the case when the llpt is accessible .",
    "the main difference between the lda - hda transformation results for spc / e and st2 water is that in the case of spc / e water , the evidence ( at e.g. @xmath75  k ; see fig .  2 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) for first - order phase transition - like behavior in the pel is significantly weaker .",
    "specifically , during the lda - hda transformations in spc / e water : ( i ) @xmath20 does not exhibit van der waals - like loops ; ( ii ) @xmath7 exhibits only very weak , barely noticeable , negative curvature upon compression , and not at all during decompression ; and ( iii ) non - monotonic behavior in @xmath21 is also weak during compression , and absent during decompression .",
    "this pattern of behavior is consistent with the absence of an accessible llpt in spc / e water .",
    "we also note that at the compression rates studied , the lda - hda transformation in spc / e water exhibits a more gradual change of density on compression / decompression , compared to st2 water or experimental water  @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the glass phenomenology observed in spc / e water can be thought of as a  supercritical \" lda - hda transformation , analogous to a liquid - gas transformation at @xmath76 .",
    "in contrast , for st2 water and perhaps for real water , the glass phenomenology corresponds to a `` subcritical '' first - order phase transition between lda and hda .",
    "a theory for amorphous ices has been presented in ref .",
    "@xcite based on theory / computer simulations using the mw model , a coarse - grain model for water  @xcite . in the suplementary information of ref .",
    "@xcite it is shown that for a compression rate @xmath77  mpa / ns , similar to the compression rate employed here and in ref .",

    "the authors conclude that there is a state at which lda , hda , and the liquid coexist at an out - of - equilibrium triple point .",
    "since the mw model seems to lack the sharp change in density associated with the lda - to - hda transformation , its behavior is closer to the case of spc / e than st2 water .",
    "it is thus suggestive that the theory proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite may apply only for the case of  supercritical \" lda - hda transformations , such as that which occurs in spc / e water .",
    "we finally note some of the characteristic features indicative of a lda - hda  first - order phase transition \" , found in st2 water at @xmath79  k , vanish with increasing temperature as @xmath80 , where @xmath81  k is the llcp temperature of st2 water  @xcite .",

    "the similarities in the pel properties sampled during the liquid - to - ice and lda - hda transformations provide support for the view that the lda - hda transformation is an out - of - equilibrium first - order phase transition ; the origins of the lda - hda and ldl - hdl transformations being the system moving between the same two ( ldl / lda and hdl / hda ) megabasins of the pel .",
    "we now consider how the lda and hda configurations compare with the configurations sampled by ldl and hdl in equilibrium .",
    "this question has deep implications for our understanding of glass and liquid polymorphism .",
    "for example , if the pel basins sampled by the lda ( hda ) glass are the same as the ones sampled by the equilibrium ldl ( hdl ) liquid at some fictive temperature @xmath90 , then it becomes possible to provide a thermodynamic modeling of the lda - hda transformation in terms of the ldl - hdl first - order phase transition .",

    "@xcite for a comparison with the case of spc / e water .",
    "the starting lda form ( _ i.e. _ hgw ) is close to the low - energy end of the @xmath92  g/@xmath57 isochores for the liquid in the @xmath20-@xmath7 and @xmath21-@xmath7 planes .",
    "this is expected since the density of lda in this temperature range is approximately @xmath93  g/@xmath57 .",
    "however , as soon as the compression starts , the glass deviates abruptly from the liquid isochores , exploring regions of the pel that are not accessed by the liquid , similar to the behavior in spc / e water  @xcite .",
    "for example , at @xmath44  k the lda form at @xmath94  g/@xmath57 is characterized by @xmath95  mpa , @xmath96  kj / mol , and @xmath97 ( see empty diamond on the black lines in fig .",
    "[ piseissis - t80 ] ) , while the corresponding values for the equilibrium liquid at the same density and @xmath7 are @xmath98  mpa and @xmath99 ( see blue solid diamonds ) .",
    "interestingly , the lda - hda transformation occurs in a region of the pel that is far from the accessible configurations explored by the liquid at all densities .    during decompression of hda ( red lines in figs .",
    "[ piseissis - t80 ] and [ piseissis - t160 ] ) , the system returns to regions of the pel with properties similar to those of the liquid .",

    "[ piseissis - t160](a)-(d ) the location in the @xmath20-@xmath7 and @xmath21-@xmath7 planes of the high - pressure ice that forms during compression at @xmath59  k. clearly , the pel region explored by the system in the ice state is very different from the regions associated with lda , hda , or the equilibrium liquid .",
    "in summary , we find that the pel properties in our simulations of amorphous solid water during compression and decompression support the view that lda and hda correspond to two distinct megabasins in the pel .",
    "we also show that the pel behavior we observe in the lda - hda transformation is qualitatively the same as the pel signatures observed during unambiguous first - order phase transitions in the same system , specifically the liquid - ice transitions .",
    "this finding is consistent with the interpretation of the lda - hda transformation as a sub - glass - transition manifestation of the equilibrium llpt that has been demonstrated to occur in st2 water .",
    "comparison of our st2 results with those obtained using spc / e water demonstrate that when the llpt is inaccessible , the phase - transition - like characteristics of the lda - hda transformation are correspondingly weakened , or lost entirely .",
    "given the closer similarity between the behavior of amorphous solid st2 water and real amorphous solid water , our results therefore support the possibility that a llpt occurs in deeply supercooled liquid water .",
    "an interesting result of this work is that , in st2 water , the regions of the pel sampled by the liquid ( ldl and hdl ) and the glass ( lda and hda ) differ .",
    "this is in agreement with previous simulations of spc / e water .",
    "it follows that , at least for the compression / decompression rates explored here , the concept of fictive temperature can not be used to associate lda or hda with  frozen \" equilibrium configurations of ldl or hdl . as a consequence",
    ", it seems unlikely that a simple thermodynamic modeling of the lda - hda transformation in terms of the ldl - hdl first - order phase transition is possible .",
    "however , we also note that the fact that ldl / hdl and lda / hda sample different regions of the pel is not at odds with the view that there are two distinct megabasins in the pel , one associated with both ldl and lda , and another megabasin corresponding to both hdl and hda .",
    "a schematic and highly idealized pel for real water , based on our results for st2 water , is shown in fig .",
    "[ figyy ] . only the ldl / lda and hdl / hda megabasins",
    "are illustrated ; for clarity we have omitted the individual is basins that are distributed all over the pel . in fig .",
    "[ figyy ] , the region of the pel explored by a given realization of a glass ( lda or hda ) should be small compared to the region accessible to the liquid .",
    "the slower a liquid is cooled toward the glass state , the deeper the system gets in the pel in the final glassy state .",
    "accordingly , the well - annealed lda and hda samples prepared in experiments are expected to lie quite close to the the minima of their respective megabasins .",
    "the region of the pel explored by the equilibrium liquid will include many higher energy configurations .",
    "the path followed in the pel when compressing at experimental rates from lda to hda might look something like the green path in fig .",
    "[ figyy ] .",
    "however , if a hda sample is prepared by compression of lda at a very fast rate compared to experiments , as is done in our simulations , the glass can be driven into regions of the pel quite different , and at higher energy , than those explored by either the liquid , or the well - relaxed hda obtained in experiments ; a possible realization of this scenario is shown by the blue path in fig .",
    "[ figyy ] . from this point of view",
    ", we should not be surprised that different regions of the pel are sampled by the glass during compression , relative to the liquid .",
    "a similar argument has been used to explain the differences between hda samples prepared under different procedures  @xcite .",
    "one of the limitations of simulation studies of glass polymorphism is the fast compression / decompression rates employed , relative to experiments . in particular , we have shown that the starting lda form for our compression / decompression cycle ( hgw ) is not identical to the lda form recovered after decompression of hda .",
    "however , as shown in the appendix , the difference between these two lda forms decreases upon reducing the compression / decompression rate . hence the present results are consistent with hgw and the recovered lda form belonging to the same ldl / lda megabasin .",
    "our work supports the interpretation that the ldl / lda and hdl / hda megabasins each host a family of glasses and liquids , all with similar properties . in a following work",
