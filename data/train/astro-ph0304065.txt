    "data from _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ have caused radical revisions to the x - ray view of cooling flows in clusters of galaxies @xcite . where data from x - ray missions such as _ rosat _ and _ asca _ were interpreted as showing that substantially more than @xmath7 of cooled gas is being deposited in the central regions of many clusters ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ data are inconsistent with such high cooling rates ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and show little spectroscopic evidence for gas cooling below temperatures of about 1 kev ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the cooling time of the gas at the centre of a cooling flow cluster is typically only a few times @xmath8 , so that substantial heat input is required to prevent large amounts of gas from cooling below 1 kev .",
    "the rapidly growing list of cavities found in the x - ray emitting gas associated with radio lobes emanating from the nucleus of the central galaxy ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) suggests strongly that radio outbursts from the active nucleus of the central galaxy provide the required heating @xcite .",
    "many issues remain to be settled in the emerging picture of cluster cooling flows ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in particular , the presence of cool gas in a wide variety of forms ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and star formation ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) in many of these systems indicates that some of the x - ray emitting intracluster gas does cool to low temperatures . this is supported by the detection of some x - ray emitting gas below 1 kev in at least one system @xcite .",
    "however , it is yet to be determined how the cooled gas arises .",
    "it might be deposited in brief episodes every few times @xmath8 , as the central gas radiates the last of its thermal energy , cools to low temperatures and triggers a nuclear outburst that chokes off further cooling .",
    "alternatively , it may be deposited as a continuous thermally unstable trickle ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "it has also been proposed that at least some of the cool gas did not originate as intracluster gas , but was brought to the cluster centre with infalling galaxies @xcite .",
    "as well , the state of the bulk of the cool gas at the centres of cooling flows is disputed ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    "we discuss maps of galactic foreground  emission over cooling flow clusters .",
    "this work was originally prompted by measurements of large excess photoelectric absorption in cooling flow clusters @xcite , implying very large reservoirs of cooled gas within them .",
    "the aim was to determine if arcminute scale fluctuations in foreground  column density could account for the excess absorption ( @xcite proposed that variations in foreground dust column density could have this effect ) .",
    "however , _",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _",
    "observations now suggest that the excess photoelectric absorption was largely an artifact of models in which large quantities of gas were assumed to cool from the ambient temperature of the intracluster medium to well below 1 kev .",
    "nevertheless , photoelectric absorption by the cool gas remains an important channel for information about its quantity and state , and for this purpose it is important to be able separate the effects of foreground absorption .",
    "a number of authors have reported extreme ultraviolet ( euv ) and soft x - ray excesses in clusters of galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; but see @xcite ) .",
    "such an excess could be due to inverse compton scattering of the microwave background by a non - thermal particle population , but then the minimum particle pressure required in the cluster sersic 159 - 03 would exceed the thermal pressure of the hot gas @xcite . in order to maintain hydrostatic equilibrium , that would imply at least doubling the cluster mass .",
    "alternatively , the soft excess in sersic 159 - 03 may be due to gas that is cooler than the hot intracluster medium , but then the total mass of cool gas would be comparable to that of the hot gas @xcite .",
    "this presents the problem that the huge mass of cool gas can not be stably supported by hydrostatic pressure",
    ". measurements of euv and soft x - ray emission from extragalactic sources are sensitive to correction for foreground photoelectric absorption . @xcite",
    "have argued on this basis that the evidence for soft emission from a number of clusters is weak .",
    "@xcite have argued further that arcminute scale holes in the foreground absorption might account for at least part of the soft excess .",
    "so , the uniformity of foreground  emission is also of interest for clusters showing euv and soft x - ray excesses .    in section [ data ]",
    "we describe the observations and data reduction .",
    "our main result is that there is no evidence for arcmin scale structure in the foreground  emitting gas . in section [ discuss ]",
    "we discuss the limits we can place on variation of foreground  for each case . for the purpose of obtaining scales , we assume a flat @xmath9cdm cosmology , with @xmath10 and @xmath11 throughout the paper .",
    "we selected the cooling flow clusters a3581 , a2597 and sersic 159 - 03 because they have shown photoelectric absorption well in excess of that expected due to foreground gas ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "as already noted , sersic 159 - 03 is also reported as having the greatest known soft x - ray excess @xcite .",
    "pertinent details of the clusters are given in table  [ tbl : obs ] .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "we calculate upper limits to arcmin scale variations in the foreground neutral hydrogen column density towards the cooling flows in three different ways .",
    "the results are listed in table  [ nhlimits ] .",
    "columns headed `` summed '' present the @xmath12 image noise per channel ( as given in table  [ tbl : obs ] ) multiplied by the number of channels in which foreground emission is evident in hi parkes all sky survey spectra ( hipass , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and converted to a column density in the standard way , ie.@xmath13 where the factor @xmath14 incorporates the sensitivity of the atca , @xmath15 is the observing wavelength ( cm ) , @xmath16 are the major and minor widths of the synthesized observing beam ( arcsec , listed in table  [ tbl : obs ] ) , @xmath17 is the summed flux ( jy beam@xmath18 m s@xmath18 ) , and the result is in atoms @xmath19 . summed limits on beam - to - beam fluctuations in column density are given for both the natural and uniform weight maps in table  [ nhlimits ] , illustrating the practical trade off between spatial resolution and noise level .",
    "the summed calculation gives a very conservative upper limit to the beam - to - beam fluctuations in @xmath20 .",
    "these limits apply even if the fluctuation in every channel is in the same sense . however , as noted above , there is little or no correlation from channel to channel in the image slices , so that the contributions of the channels to the noise are largely independent . in this case",
    ", the noise in the summed image will be the rms value for the combined channels .",
    "if the channels also contribute equally to the noise , the rms noise equals the summed noise divided by the square root of the number of channels .",
    "upper limits on foreground column density calculated in this way are given in table [ nhlimits ] under the heading `` averaged . ''",
    "finally , in the columns headed `` measured '' of table  [ nhlimits ] , we list a third set of upper limits to the foreground neutral column density . for each field",
    ", we collapse the channel maps by summing those channels for which hipass spectra show emission to be present ( ie .",
    "we generate a zeroth - order moment map ) and then calculate the rms fluctuations in the image plane of the moment map .",
    "importantly , this technique takes into account the channel - to - channel image noise variation , shown in figures  [ fig : rms1][fig : rms3 ] . in all cases , these `` measured '' column density limits lie between the `` average '' and `` summed '' values , and we believe them to be the most appropriate limits to use in further analysis .",
    "for comparison with our results , in columns  2 and 3 of table  [ nhlimits ] we list the foreground hi column interpolated from @xcite and @xcite ( where available ) ; these data are averaged over beams of area @xmath21 and @xmath22 square degrees respectively .",
    "our adopted @xmath12 limits ( bold ) on the fluctuations in the foreground column are considerably less than the wide - area averaged column itself for the natural weight images ( beam areas @xmath237 square arcmin ) , but are on the order of the @xcite column for our uniform weight images ( beam areas @xmath02 square arcmin ) .",
    "therefore , our key result is that the foreground  emission is structureless over the range of scales probed by our natural weighted observations for all three clusters .",
    "this outcome is consistent with the extrapolation of the  power spectra measured at larger angular scales by @xcite , and with the agreement in  column measured by the @xcite and @xcite surveys whose beams differ by an order of magnitude in area .",
    "comments on the individual clusters follow .    *",
    "abell 3581 * is a moderately poor cluster @xcite and , perhaps , the least well studied of our objects .",
    "its central galaxy , ic 4374 , is a cd galaxy hosting the radio source pks 1404@xmath24267 .",
    "based on _ asca _ and _ rosat _ data , @xcite found a mass deposition rate of @xmath25 , and an absorbing column density of @xmath26 , well in excess of the foreground value ( table [ nhlimits ] ) . using a redshift of 0.0222 ( corresponding to the recession velocity of @xmath27 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the scale is @xmath28 , so that our naturally weighted beam size is @xmath29 kpc at the cluster .",
    "this is well inside the cooling flow region , which is about 100 kpc in radius @xcite .",
    "an excess column density of @xmath30 would violate our @xmath12 limit if it covered a disc exceeding 5 kpc in radius projected onto the cluster .",
    "it is very unlikely that foreground galactic gas could account for the excess absorption in this object .",
    "our @xmath12 limit on fluctuations in foreground  column density from beam - to - beam is about 14  per  cent .",
    "this constrains the properties of any holes in the foreground gas , as discussed below .",
    "* sersic 159 - 03 * , or abell s1101 , has been observed with * xmm - newton * @xcite and the results show that very little gas cools below @xmath0 kev .",
    "this undermines earlier claims of excess photoelectric absorption in this cluster @xcite . at the redshift of the cd galaxy , @xmath31 @xcite , the cluster scale is @xmath32 , so that our naturally weighted beam size is @xmath33 kpc .",
    "the @xmath12 limit on fluctuations per beam in the foreground  column density is 43  per  cent for this cluster .",
    "note that , as discussed in the introduction , sersic 159 - 03 is the cluster with the greatest reported soft x - ray excess @xcite .    *",
    "abell 2597 * has been observed extensively at a wide range of wavelengths .",
    "it shares many of the noteworthy properties of cooling flow clusters , including a central radio source , pks 2322@xmath24122 @xcite , optical emission lines @xcite , recent star formation @xcite and spatially extended cool gas @xcite .",
    "@xcite found significant excess photoelectric absorption , but _",
    "observations show cavities (  ghost  cavities that do not surround the currently detectable radio lobes ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and that the bulk of the gas does not cool below @xmath0 kev .",
    "however , fuse data do show evidence of some gas cooling to lower temperatures @xcite . at a redshift of 0.0821 @xcite ,",
    "the cluster scale is @xmath34 , making our naturally weighted beam size @xmath35 kpc .",
    "our @xmath12 limit on the foreground  fluctuation per beam is 17  per  cent for this source .",
    "it is clear that foreground  emitting gas has little to do with excess photoelectric absorption in any of the three cooling flow clusters considered here .",
    "the lack of structure on arcminute scales in any of these clusters tells us that such structure is uncommon at best , at least for sources that are well clear of the galactic plane .    in the light of the euv and soft x - ray excesses , for the remainder of this section we focus on placing constraints on holes in the foreground gas @xcite .",
    "our data only place useful constraints on the properties of holes that are comparable in size to the radio beam . for the purpose of discussion",
    ", we consider a simple model , with the sky divided into small areas , @xmath36 , typical of the size of a hole , and smaller than the area @xmath37 of the radio beam .",
    "these areas are covered at random with column density @xmath38 or @xmath39 , with the smaller column density to represent holes .",
    "if the fraction of the sky covered by holes is @xmath40 , then the average column density will be @xmath41 .",
    "the number of hole areas falling within the radio beam has a binomial distribution , and the rms fluctuation in the measured column density is @xmath42 .",
    "the fractional fluctuation in column density from beam - to - beam is then @xmath43 where @xmath44 .",
    "if holes in the foreground  distribution are to account for euv and soft x - ray excesses , then the column density in the holes must be significantly lower than average ,  we need @xmath45 , so we will take this to be exact . the limits on fluctuations in column density from table [ nhlimits ] may then be regarded as constraining the size of the of any holes , @xmath46 where @xmath47 is now the observed limit on the fractional fluctuation in @xmath48 .",
    "for example , if the covering fraction of the holes is 1/2 , then the constraint is @xmath49 , giving upper limits to the angular diameter of any holes of @xmath4 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 arcsec for abell 3581 , sersic 159 - 03 and abell 2597 , respectively , in order to comply with the limits in table [ nhlimits ] .",
    "it is unfortunate that our weakest constraint applies to sersic 159 - 03 , the cluster with the greatest reported soft x - ray excess @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to consider what is required of the distribution of the  gas in order to produce a significant covering fraction of holes . here",
    ", the phrase `` low density gas '' is used loosely to refer to gas which , if spread along a line of sight , would appear as a significant hole in the foreground  screen .",
    "the average fraction of a random line of sight that lies in low density gas is equal to the filling factor of that gas . in order to appear as a hole",
    ", the bulk of the line of sight must pass through low density gas .",
    "thus , if the covering fraction of holes is substantial , the filling factor of the low density gas needs to be close to unity .",
    "the most plausible distribution of  gas that could appear smooth down to arcmin scales , yet still produce a substantial covering fraction of holes is one where the gas is highly clumped on small scales .",
    "the clumps must be significantly smaller than one arcmin in order for the 21 cm emission to appear smooth on that scale . at distances comparable to the gas scale height , @xmath52 pc",
    ", a 1 arcmin clump would be @xmath53 pc in size .",
    "on the other hand , in order to produce appreciable small - scale fluctuations in @xmath48 a typical line of sight can only encounter a small number of clumps .",
    "this means that the column density of one clump must be comparable to the mean value of @xmath48 . for small , roughly spherical clumps this requires very high gas densities , @xmath54 , almost certainly exceeding the limits on the gas pressure .",
    "this constraint is relaxed somewhat if the clumps are really filaments , or folds in sheets @xcite .",
    "some studies have found variations in foreground  column density on scales as small as 10 milliarcsec (  @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , these variations are seen only in the coldest  component , and are by no means normal : @xcite report that only two of seven background continuum sources illuminate opacity gradients in the foreground column .",
    "@xcite offers a compelling argument that the overall impact on the  column along different lines of sight from _ physically allowable _ clouds of cold  is likely to be very small , and this is again consistent with the studies of the  power spectrum on larger angular scales @xcite .",
    "radio maps of the 21 cm emission from foreground galactic neutral hydrogen over 3 cooling flow clusters show that the gas is uniform on scales from @xmath0 to 10 arcmin .",
    "our @xmath12 limits on beam - to - beam fluctuations in 21 cm emission , expressed in terms of limits on the fluctuations in  column density , are @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath55 for the clusters abell 3581 , sersic 159 - 03 and abell 2597 , respectively , on scales of the order of 1 arcmin ( see table [ nhlimits ] ) .",
    "variations in the column density of neutral hydrogen in the galaxy do not account for the claimed excess photoelectric absorption in these clusters .",
    "in the light of recent detections of significant excess soft x - ray emission from some clusters , we have also considered whether `` holes '' in the distribution of foreground neutral hydrogen could cover a significant fraction of the sky , and can confidently rule out a high covering fraction of holes at scales @xmath0 arcmin .",
