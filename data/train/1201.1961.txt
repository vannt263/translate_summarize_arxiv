    "in a protoplanetary disk , there is the so - called snow line which is defined as the inner boundary of the ice - condensing region ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . beyond the snow line ,",
    "the surface mass density of solid materials is enhanced due to condensation of water ice , and hence , the formation efficiency of large gaseous and icy planets is expected to be enhanced .",
    "thus , the snow line plays a very important role in the planet formation .    in spite of its importance",
    ", no one has detected the snow line position in a circumstellar disk so far .",
    "this is because the snow line is usually located close to the central star ( @xmath1 ) , where the spacial resolving power of current facilities is limited , and the disk is optically too thick to see through . on the other hand ,",

    "@xcite observed scattered radiation from an _ edge - on _ disk and detected an absorption feature of water ice at 3  in it .",
    "however , their observations give no information about the position of the snow line along the line of sight .",
    "@xcite observed scattered light from the surface of an _ face - on _ disk and detected the @xmath2 absorption feature by icy dust particles at @xmath3 .",
    "they could estimate the dust size as @xmath4 by using a color diagram method proposed by @xcite .",
    "while @xcite could not detect the snow line position , their method holds a potential to achieve it due to a high spatial resolution of their detection technique .",
    "although an important factor for the planet formation is the snow line position at the mid - plane , detecting the snow line at the disk surface will be a first step because the disk surface is easily observed .",
    "the surface snow line is connected to the mid - plane snow line through a 2d structure of the ice - condensing region ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "if one knows the mechanism which determines the 2d structure of the snow line , one may convert the surface snow line into the mid - plane snow line .",
    "the main difference between the interior and the surface of protoplanetary disks is that the latter is exposed to ultra - violet ( uv ) radiation from the central star and the interstellar radiation field",
    ". this uv radiation may affect the distribution of water ice at the disk surface .",
    "indeed , it has been proposed that a non - thermal desorption process is necessary for explaining the observed high abundance of gas - phase water molecules in cold outer regions of circumstellar disks and molecular clouds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a probable mechanism responsible for such a non - thermal desorption of water molecules is the photodesorption ( or photosputtering ) process caused by far - uv ( fuv ) radiation .",
    "the photodesorption process has been recently studied theoretically and experimentally ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "berg et al . (",
    "2009 ) experimentally studied the photodesorption process and derived the photodesorption yield as a function of ice temperature and thickness of the ice layer . according to their results ,",
    "the photodesorption yield with ice temperature @xmath5 and thickness of the ice layer larger than 8 mono layers is @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the ice thickness scaled by a mono layer .",
    "they then carried out a numerical simulation about the distribution of gas phase @xmath8 in a protoplanetary disk around a herbig ae / be star , taking into account adsorption and thermal desorption processes on dust grains , and the photodesorption process , and found that photodesorption reduced the h@xmath9o ice abundance in the disk surface by orders of magnitudes .",
    "@xcite also showed theoretically that the presence of icy dust particles in a debris disk around a herbig ae / be star is affected by the photodesorption process .",
    "the environment of the surface of protoplanetary disks such as one observed by @xcite may be similar to that of debris disks , and hence the position of the surface snow line would be affected by the photodesorption process .",

    "there is lack of hot and warm vapor traced by near- and mid - infrared observations in disks around herbig ae / be stars , whereas such vapor was often found in disks around t tauri stars @xcite . a difference of photochemistry is suggested as a cause of this difference . in herbig ae",

    "more interestingly , @xcite reported no detection of cold water vapor in submillimetre in a t tauri disk and suggested that photodesorption was less efficient than theoretically expected . in any case , more works about photodesorption and photodissociation in protoplanetary disks are required to depict a full picture of the photochemical evolution in the disks . in particular , less efficient photodesorption suggested by @xcite should be tested also in herbig ae / be stars .    in this study",
    ", we numerically investigate the effect of the photodesorption process induced by the fuv radiation from the central star and the interstellar radiation field on the surface snow line position in circumstellar disks .",
    "we focus on herbig ae / be disks where photodesorption is effective as expected , while the parameter space explored in this paper also covers t tauri disks .",
    "the goal is to uncover what the determining process of the snow line position at a disk surface is .",
    "we omit photodissociation in this paper , but in fact , we find that this process is much slower than photodesorption ( see  4.3.1 ) .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in  2 ,",
    "we describe our model for obtaining the distribution of icy dust particles in a herbig ae / be disk with photodesorption . in  3 , we show effects of photodesorption on the position of the surface snow line and the dependence of the results on the stellar parameters . in  4 , we consider an implication of our results for observations , derive an analytic formula of the critical stellar effective temperature for an efficient photodesorption , and discuss effects of some processes omitted in our calculations .",
    "finally , we summarize this paper in  5 .",
    "we consider a flared but geometrically - thin and optically - thick disk revolving around a central star in kepler velocity .",
    "we assume that the disk is axi - symmetric about the rotational axis and plane - symmetric about the mid - plane .",
    "we adopt a coordinate system @xmath10 , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the radial distance from the central star and the vertical height from the disk mid - plane , respectively .",
    "the central star sits on the origin of the coordinate .",
    "we assume that the radial distribution of the surface density of the disk is a power law distribution ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the surface density at @xmath15 and @xmath16 is the power - law index describing the radial density distribution .",
    "we assume @xmath17 and @xmath18 @xcite throughout this paper .",
    "the disk is assumed to be in the hydrostatic equilibrium vertically , and heated by the irradiation by the central star .",
    "the temperature and density structures of the disk are numerically solved by the 1 + 1d radiative transfer method described by @xcite .",
    "we assume that temperatures of dust and gas are always same . unlike @xcite , we consider isotropic scattering of both stellar and diffuse radiations according to @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the details of the calculation are described in appendix a ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "note that we assume that the grazing angle ( @xmath19 ) of the stellar radiation incident on the disk surface is uniformly 0.05 throughout the disk for simplicity .",
    "this is fairly artificial but it was very difficult to determine both the grazing angle and the ice abundance simultaneously in our 1 + 1d disk with scattering by an iteration scheme because of very slow convergence .",
    "the mean molecular weight of the disk gas is assumed to be 2.3 .",
    "although we fix global parameters of the disk such as @xmath20 , @xmath16 , and @xmath19 , it would not affect the results presented in this paper very much when discussing the disk surface where the radiative transfer effect is negligible and the physical condition is determined almost locally .",
    "this enables us to derive an analytic formula describing the numerical results in  4.2 , while the absolute scaling may be affected slightly .      a very important factor for determining the structure and the radiation field in the disk is the optical property of the disk .",
    "this is mainly determined by the absorption and scattering processes by dust particles .",
    "the gas opacity is negligible for the radiation considered in this paper , except for ly@xmath21 photons .",
    "we omit gas opacity throughout this paper for simplicity , whereas an importance of ly@xmath21 transfer was suggested @xcite .",
    "it is still reasonable when discussing the disk surface where the transfer effect is small .",
    "we consider only pure crystalline silicate and pure crystalline water ice particles floating in the disk gas as dust .",
    "these particles are assumed to be spherical with a fixed uniform size to avoid complexity .",
    "here we assume 1 @xmath22m - sized particles as found in the hd142527 disk by @xcite , but the effect of the grain size is discussed in  4.3.4 .",
    "the mass fractions of silicate and water to the disk gas are assumed to be 0.0043 and 0.0094 , respectively , @xcite and uniform throughout the disk .",
    "this water abundance corresponds to the number fraction of h@xmath9o molecules relative to all gas particles in the disk as @xmath23 which is the maximum fraction of water vapor.o abundance in @xcite was not taken into account the recent downward revision of o abundance @xcite . ]",
    "the absorption and scattering coefficients of silicate and water ice particles are also taken from @xcite .",
    "the coefficients for 1 -sized particles for a unit disk mass are shown in figure  1 .",
    "we evaluate the abundance of water ice in the disk by the balance between changing rates of the ice dust radius due to condensation @xmath24 , sublimation @xmath25 , and photodesorption @xmath26 ; @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the number fraction of water vapor of the disk medium and @xmath5 is the dust ( and gas ) temperature .",
    "the rates are evaluated by the formulas from @xcite ( see appendix b ) .",
    "the dust temperature @xmath5 is obtained by the radiative transfer calculation described in  2.1 and appendix a.    the number fraction of water vapor @xmath28 is determined as equation ( [ eq : balance_dust_size ] ) is fulfilled .",
    "then , the number fraction of @xmath8 in water ice to the disk gas @xmath29 is given by the residual of the subtraction of @xmath28 from the total number fraction of h@xmath9o @xmath30 .",
    "on the other hand , if @xmath31 with @xmath32 , water ice does not condense and @xmath33 . using @xmath34 and @xmath29 ,",
    "the mass ratio of water ice to the total water abundance @xmath35 is given by @xmath36 then , the absorption and scattering coefficients of a unit disk mass containing dust particles , @xmath37 and @xmath38 are given by @xmath39 where @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 are the absorption and scattering coefficients of silicate and water ice dust particles by @xcite , respectively ( @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the coefficients in the case where all the water molecules are condensed as icy dust particles ) .",
    "since @xmath44 itself affects the disk structure through the radiative transfer , we solve @xmath44 and the disk structure iteratively to obtain consistent solutions of them .",
    "we consider three sources of uv radiation : the stellar photosphere , an excess stellar radiation ( probably caused by an accretion shock ) , and the interstellar radiation field .",
    "the stellar photospheric radiation is treated in the radiative transfer code described in  2.1 and appendix a. we assume the spectrum to be a planck function .",
    "the transfer of the other two radiation sources are treated as described in the subsequent paragraphs . as found in  2.5 and  3.2",
    ", however , the two sources have a very weak effect on the position of the surface snow line .",
    "the heating by the two sources is taken into account in equation ( a8 ) in addition to that of the photospheric radiation .",
    "an excess fuv radiation is often observed in t tauri stars , while the photospheric radiation is dominant in herbig stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "nevertheless we consider the excess radiation for discussions of the dependence of the stellar effective temperature in  3.2 .",
    "we assume the excess fuv luminosity to be a fraction of @xmath45 to the bolometric luminosity of the photosphere ( @xmath46 ) as observed in t tauri stars @xcite .",
    "this reproduces the observational trend that the excess relative to the photospheric radiation is less important for earlier spectral type .",
    "observations show that the excess fuv radiation is dominated by ly@xmath21 photons @xcite .",
    "we assume that the excess radiation consists only of ly@xmath21 photons for simplicity . however , we omit any scattering of the ly@xmath21 photons ( see  2.2 ) although the resonant scattering of the photons is important in the sub - surface layer of the disk @xcite .",
    "the ly@xmath21 assumption is only affects the calculation of the optical depth in the disk and the photon number flux .",
    "consequently , the excess fuv radiation flux in the disk can be obtained as @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the incident excess fuv flux from the central star at the radius @xmath11 for no dust case , @xmath49 is the absorption optical depth at the fuv ( @xmath50 ) wavelength measured along the @xmath12-axis from @xmath51 ) to @xmath52 , and @xmath19 is the grazing angle for the stellar radiation .",
    "we also consider the fuv radiation from the interstellar field .",
    "we adopt an average fuv radiation flux from @xcite .",
    "the fuv flux is evaluated by assuming that it penetrates into the disk parallel to the @xmath12-axis : @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the incident interstellar fuv radiation flux and is set to be @xmath55 erg @xmath56 s@xmath57 .",
    "the interstellar fuv radiation is also assumed to be consisted only of @xmath50 photons as the stellar excess fuv .",
    "this is simply in order to treat the two additional fuv radiation sources homogeneously , whereas the interstellar radiation may be described by a planck function or a power - law function made by a combination of planck functions with various temperatures .",
    "figure [ struct ] shows examples of the vertical structure of two annuli at @xmath58 au ( left - hand tandem panels ) and 100 au ( right - hand tandem panels ) around a central star with the effective temperature @xmath59 k , the luminosity @xmath60 @xmath61 , and the mass @xmath62 @xmath63 .",
    "the top panels show the temperature structure along the disk vertical axis .",
    "the middle panels show the changing rates of the grain size by condensation ( double - dot - dashed line ) , sublimation ( dotted line ) , and photodesorption ( solid line ) .",
    "we also show the changing rates by photodesorption due to stellar ( photospheric and excess ) radiation ( dashed line ) and due to interstellar radiation ( dot - dashed line ) .",
    "the bottom panels show the ice condensation fraction .    in both annuli , condensation is rapid near the mid - plane and virtually all water is in ice . as the temperature increases ( and the density decreases ) along the vertical height , condensation becomes slower and slower . on the other hand ,",
    "sublimation and photodesorption become suddenly effective beyond a certain height .",
    "then , the ice condensation front is formed at a height where condensation balances with sublimation or photodesorption . in the @xmath58 au case ,",
    "sublimation is faster than photodesorption at the front , and then , the balance is established between condensation and sublimation . on the other hand , in the @xmath64 au case , sublimation is more than ten orders of magnitudes slower than photodesorption because of a low temperature .",
    "thus , condensation balances with photodesorption",
    ".    photodesorption by stellar fuv radiation always dominates that by interstellar fuv radiation at the disk surface because of a much stronger flux of the former radiation .",
    "however , the latter dominates the former at a sub - surface layer .",
    "this is caused by the different incident angles of the two radiations ; the stellar radiation enters the disk with a small angle against the surface ( i.e. grazing angle @xmath19 ) and the penetration depth becomes shallow , whereas the interstellar radiation enters the disk vertically and reaches a deeper layer .",
    "when discussing the surface snow line , we conclude that the interstellar radiation hardly contributes to the determination of the surface snow line .",
    "therefore , we omit the contribution by the interstellar fuv radiation in the remaining part of this paper .",
    "let us define the position of the surface snow line , here .",
    "we consider the method observing the surface snow line by using the 3 @xmath22 m h@xmath9o ice absorption feature in the scattered light proposed by @xcite theoretically and attempted by @xcite observationally .",
    "the 3 @xmath22 m scattered light comes from the layer to which the optical depth for the 3  radiation from the central star is about unity .",
    "therefore , we define the layer as the disk ` surface ' or ` 3 @xmath22 m surface ' in this paper .",
    "next , we consider the ice - condensation front in the @xmath10-plane . without the accretion viscous heating , the temperature decreases along the radial coordinate @xmath11 and increases along the vertical coordinate @xmath12 .",
    "thus , the ice - condensation front becomes lower @xmath12 for smaller @xmath11 and higher @xmath12 for larger @xmath11 ( see fig .",
    "[ 2d_snowline ] ) . then , there may be a cross - point between the 3 @xmath22 m surface and the ice - condensation front .",
    "if we observe a disk with the scattered light , we will observe the 3 @xmath22 m feature only from the outside of the cross - point .",
    "therefore , we define the cross - point as the surface snow line in this paper .",
    "namely , the surface snow line in this paper is the snow line which would be observed by the 3 @xmath22 m scattered light .",
    "figure [ 2d_snowline ] shows the ice - condensation front ( solid curve ) and the surface snow line position ( vertical tick ) in a disk around a star with the effective temperature @xmath65 k , the luminosity @xmath60 @xmath66 , and the mass @xmath62 @xmath63 .",
    "the layers of @xmath67 , 1 , and 10 are also shown as the dotted curves , where @xmath68 is the optical depth at the wavelength 3  from the central star .",
    "the layer of @xmath69 is the 3  surface of the disk .",
    "we also show the pressure scale - height calculated by the mid - plane temperature as the dashed curve in each panel .    comparing the panel ( a ) , where photodesorption is omitted , with the panel ( b ) , where the process works",
    ", we find that photodesorption wipes out water ice particles above the disk surface and the ice - condensation front almost coincides with the surface throughout the disk .",
    "the position of the surface snow line ( i.e. the cross - point of the ice - condensation front and the 3  surface ) shifts outward by a factor of about 4 for this case . as shown later ( figs .",
    "[ 2d_snowline_ice_vs_noice ] and [ snowline_vs_teff_m1 ] ) , the radial shift becomes larger and larger as the effective temperature increases .",
    "therefore , photodesorption is very important to determine the position of the surface snow line for herbig stars .      in this section",
    ", we examine the dependence of the surface snow line position @xmath70 on the stellar effective temperature @xmath71 , the luminosity @xmath46 , and the mass @xmath72 . in this calculation",
    ", we omit opacity of water ice particles for the computational cost .",
    "this simplification gives 2030% smaller radius of the surface snow line position as shown in figure [ 2d_snowline_ice_vs_noice ] .",
    "this relatively small difference is probably caused by an offset of two opposite effects ; ( 1 ) a smaller opacity in the case without ice opacity results in a higher temperature in the disk interior ( i.e. a higher pressure height found in fig .",
    "[ 2d_snowline_ice_vs_noice ] ) and also a higher surface height defined by @xmath73 ( as also found in fig .",
    "[ 2d_snowline_ice_vs_noice ] ) . however , this leads a smaller density at the surface , and then , the condensation rate becomes slower and the surface snow line shifts outward .",
    "( 2 ) the smaller opacity also results in a larger column density from infinity to the surface in order to account for @xmath73 at the surface .",
    "it leads a lower surface height and a larger density at the surface .",
    "then , the condensation rate becomes faster , and the surface snow line shifts inward .",
    "this second effect exceeds the first effect in the cases shown in figure  [ 2d_snowline_ice_vs_noice ] . in any case",
    ", the omission of the ice opacity does not change the mechanism determining the surface snow line position .      as found in figure",
    "[ 2d_snowline_ice_vs_noice ] , the position of the surface snow line strongly depends on the stellar effective temperature ; as the temperature increases , the surface snow line shifts outward greatly and eventually disappears .",
    "figure [ snowline_vs_teff_m1 ] shows this dependence more in detail for the cases with @xmath62 @xmath74 and @xmath75 @xmath61 and 10 @xmath61 .",
    "the dot - dashed curves indicate the cases without photodesorption , i.e. , @xmath70 is determined by the balance between sublimation and condensation . on the other hand ,",
    "the dotted curves are the cases without sublimation , i.e. , @xmath70 is determined by the balance between photodesorption and condensation .",
    "the solid curves are the cases with all the three processes .",
    "the dashed curves are same as the solid curves but without the stellar excess fuv ( see  2.4 ) .    for the sublimation",
    " condensation cases ( dot - dashed curves ) , @xmath70 is about 7 or 25 au and almost independent of @xmath71 , but depends on @xmath46 as @xmath76 .",
    "this is because the gas temperature for the sublimation  condensation balance is almost constant at @xmath77 k at the disk surface where the dust temperature is determined only by bolometric flux ( i.e. @xmath78 ) and not the spectrum ( see also  4.2 ) . for the photodesorption",
    " condensation cases ( dotted curves ) , @xmath70 strongly depends on @xmath71 as @xmath79 .",
    "this strong dependence comes from the @xmath71 dependence in the fuv photon number flux ( see  4.2 ) .",
    "it also depends on @xmath46 as @xmath80 which is different from the sublimation  condensation case .    when all the three processes are taken into account ( solid curves )",
    ", @xmath70 traces the sublimation ",
    "condensation case for lower @xmath71 and the photodesorption ",
    "condensation case for higher @xmath71 .",
    "in other words , the mechanism determining @xmath70 is the sublimation  condensation balance for lower @xmath71 and the photodesorption  condensation balance for higher @xmath71 .",
    "we here define a critical temperature @xmath81 as @xmath71 at the intersection point between the two curves of the sublimation ",
    "condensation case and the photodesorption  condensation case .",
    "if @xmath82 , photodesorption is efficient and the surface snow line moves to the outermost part of the disk or disappears .",
    "thus , @xmath81 is an indicator for judging the possibility to detect the 3  water ice absorption feature in the disk scattered radiation ( see  4.1 ) .",
    "if we compare the dashed curves ( the cases without the excess fuv ) with the solid curves , we can see the effect of the stellar fuv excess on the surface snow line .",
    "although it is still uncertain how strong the fuv excess is , we assume that the fuv excess accounts for only 0.1% of @xmath46 (  2.4 ) .",
    "we find an effect of the fuv excess in the @xmath60 @xmath61 case .",
    "if the fuv excess is stronger than this level , we should take it into account in order to determine the position of the surface snow line correctly .",
    "figure [ snowline_vs_teff_with_luminosy ] shows @xmath70 as a function of @xmath71 with various @xmath46s and @xmath62 @xmath74 .",
    "it is seen that @xmath70 shifts outward as @xmath46 increases .",
    "this is because both the fuv radiation flux from the central star and the temperature in the disk increase as @xmath46 increases .",
    "it is also seen that the critical temperature @xmath81 becomes lower as @xmath46 increases .",
    "the dependence is approximately @xmath83 ( see  4.2 ) .",
    "figure [ snowline_various_mass ] shows @xmath70 as a function of @xmath71 with @xmath60 @xmath66 and various @xmath72s .",
    "it is seen that the critical temperature @xmath81 becomes higher as @xmath72 increases .",
    "this is because the condensation rate is approximately proportional to the square root of @xmath72 ; the condensation rate depends linearly on the gas pressure with the assumption of uniformly constant number fraction of water molecules in the whole disk , and the gas pressure depends approximately linearly on the square root of @xmath72 ( see eqs .",
    "a1a3 , and also  4.2 ) .",
    "in this section , we discuss the effect of photodesorption on observing the surface snow line . as proposed by @xcite , we can resolve the surface snow line by using the 3  water ice absorption feature in the scattered light if we have a good enough spatial resolution .",
    "this method implicitly assumes the presence of water ice particles at the 3  disk surface .",
    "however , an efficient photodesorption may remove the particles from the surface and the absorption feature from the scattered radiation . on the other hand",
    ", @xcite detected the absorption feature in the scattered light from the outer disk at @xmath84 au of hd142527 , although they did not resolve the snow line position because of insufficient spatial resolution .",
    "therefore , photodesorption does not remove water ice particles completely from the disk surface of hd142527 .    as found in  3.2.1",
    ", photodesorption surpasses sublimation at the disk surface and @xmath70 is determined by the balance between photodesorption and condensation when @xmath71 exceeds a certain value which is defined as the critical temperature @xmath81 .",

    ". then , we show the boundaries at which @xmath93 au on the hr diagram in figure  [ hr2 ] .",
    "the solid lines with labels fiducial , a / b , and c are the boundaries for the four models in table  [ table : parameter ] .",
    "we also show the boundary of 1000 au for the fiducial model as the dashed line for a comparison .",
    "we find hd142527 between the boundaries of 100 au for the fiducial and a / b models .",
    "in fact , this object is on the boundary of 300 au for the fiducial model which is not shown in figure  [ hr2 ] . given the uncertainty of our simple model , we conclude that @xmath70 in the hd142527 disk is 100300 au which is still consistent with the observations by @xcite .    on the other hand , there are many herbig ae / be stars in the upper - left region far from the boundaries of 100 au and even 1000 au in figure  [ hr2 ] .",
    "photodesorption is probably very efficient for these objects , and water ice particles disappear from the surface of the disk around the objects .",
    "then , we expect that there is not the 3  water ice feature in the scattered light from the disks .",
    "this will be an observational test to examine whether photodesorption is active or not on the disk surface .",
    "finally we note a possible caveat in resolving the surface snow line by using the water ice 3  feature in the scattered light .",
    "as found in figure [ 2d_snowline_ice_vs_noice ] , the ice - condensation front and the 3  surface ( i.e. @xmath73 layer ) are always close to each other when @xmath94 . when we are moving from the outer disk to the inner one on the scattered light image , thus",
    ", the strength of the 3  feature may not disappear suddenly at the surface snow line , but may weaken gradually .",
    "in other words , the surface snow line is not a ` clear ' line . in order to predict the change of the feature strength ,",
    "we need to simulate observations , which would be a future work .",

    "the gas density @xmath114 should be that at the 3  surface : @xmath117 .",

    "however , it depends on @xmath119 which determines the density profile . as a result",
    ", we obtain @xmath124 , and then , @xmath70 determined by the condensation  photodesorption balance becomes @xmath125 which agrees with the dotted lines in figure [ snowline_vs_teff_m1 ] .",

    ". then we obtain @xmath127",

    "we have omitted photodissociation of h@xmath9o molecules , whereas this process is suggested to be important in disks around herbig stars @xcite .",
    "here we justify this omission .",
    "the photodissociation rate is given by @xmath129 , where @xmath130 is the cross section for photodissociation and @xmath131 is the number flux of fuv photons .",
    "in the previous subsection is equal to @xmath132 . ] according to @xcite , @xmath133 @xmath134 for h@xmath9o molecules . on the other hand ,",
    "the photodesorption rate is given by @xmath135 , where @xmath136 is the grain size , @xmath116 is the absorption efficiency parameter , and @xmath90 is the photodesorption yield .",
    "since the time - scale is @xmath137 , the ratio of the two time - scales is @xmath138 for @xmath139  and @xmath140 .",
    "then we find that photodissociation is several orders of magnitude slower than photodesorption .",
    "therefore , photodissociation does not affect the balance between photodesorption and condensation .",
    "we may still argue the importance of photodissociation in observations . when photodesorption becomes faster than condensation ,",
    "water ice particles are finally evaporated .",
    "this destruction time - scale is given by @xmath141 , where @xmath142 is the size changing rate by photodesorption ( eq .",
    "b6 ) . the ratio of this time - scale to the photodissociation one is @xmath143 for @xmath139  and @xmath140 ( @xmath144 is the ice material density and @xmath145 is the mass of a h@xmath9o molecule ) .",
    "thus , when the ice destruction is completed , evaporated h@xmath9o molecules have been already photodissociated .",
    "therefore , we expect that there is no h@xmath9o molecules in gas phase above the disk surface where photodesorption destroys ice particles .",
    "we have neglected desorption by x - ray ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the photodesorption rates by x - ray and fuv are given by @xmath146 , where @xmath147 is x - ray or fuv , @xmath136 is the grain size , @xmath148 is the absorption efficiency , @xmath149 is the photodesorption yield , and @xmath150 is the photon number flux .",
    "thus , the ratio is @xmath151 .",
    "x - ray luminosity of herbig stars is observed in a range of @xmath152@xmath153 of the bolometric luminosity @xcite .",
    "given about two orders of magnitude higher energy per a photon in x - ray than in fuv and that @xmath154% of the bolometric energy is emitted in fuv for herbig stars , we obtain @xmath155 .",
    "the x - ray absorption efficiency is @xmath156 which is estimated from the sum of atomic photoionization cross sections .",
    "then , we find @xmath157 .",
    "the yield for x - ray @xmath158 is uncertain for water ice , while @xmath159 .",
    "@xcite estimated @xmath160@xmath161 for co from a consideration of ` spot heating ' of subunits which is hit by a x - ray photon and is poorly connected thermally with other parts in a grain .",
    "they considered @xmath162  subgrains , which cover the parent grain , as the subunits . comparing co to h@xmath9o , the latter has 5 times larger binding energy than the former @xcite , which reduces @xmath158 for h@xmath9o by the same factor .",
    "in addition , the connecting ` neck ' between h@xmath9o ice particles is thicker than that of silica considered in @xcite because of sintering @xcite , further reducing @xmath158 because of an enhanced conductivity of heat .",
    "thus , we estimate @xmath163 , although a more detailed study is encouraged . in summary , we obtain @xmath164 and we can omit x - ray photodesorption at the disk surface . however , we note that x - ray photodesorption should be important in the disk interior , where @xmath165 because @xmath131 is significantly smaller than that at the surface .      in this paper , we have not considered dust settling and turbulent mixing although they may affect the vertical distribution of water ice particles and the surface snow line .",
    "if the dust settling toward the mid - plane occurs , the height of the 3  surface is reduced .",
    "this results in a larger density and a faster condensation at the surface .",
    "thus , the surface snow line moves inward . to estimate the amount of the shift , we need further quantitative studies .",
    "the turbulent mixing may supply water ice particles from the disk interior to the disk surface even if photodesorption removes the particles from the surface .",
    "however , the mixing time - scale is @xmath166 yr at 10 au and @xmath167 yr at 100 au according to @xcite , while the destruction time - scale of 1  ice particles by photodesorption is @xmath168 yr at 10 au and @xmath169 yr at 100 au .",
    "therefore , the ice supply by turbulence is not fast enough .",
    "figure [ grainsize ] shows @xmath70 as a function of dust grain size .",
    "we find that @xmath70 depends on the grain size * in a complex way * ; the 1 -sized grain case gives the largest @xmath70 and smaller or larger grain size cases give smaller @xmath70s .",
    "this is because @xmath70 is the cross - point of the two curves , i.e. the ice - condensation front and the 3  disk surface , which have a similar slope , and it is very sensitive to the relative position of the two curves .    to see the reason of this complex behavior of @xmath70",
    ", we show in figure [ snowline_grainsize ] ( a ) the 3  surface height for the 0.1 -sized grain and 10 -sized grain cases relative to the 1 -sized grain case .",
    "the panel ( b ) shows those of the ice - condensation front . from figure [ snowline_grainsize ]",
    ", we find that at around 10 au , the 3  surface heights of both of the 0.1 and 10 -sized cases are lower than that of the 1 -sized case , while the ice - condensation heights of the both cases are similar to that of the 1 -sized case .",
    "this results in a smaller @xmath70 for the 0.1 and 10 -sized case than for the 1 -sized case .",
    "this behavior is caused by a complex size dependence of the absorption and scattering opacities with and without water ice .",
    "more studies about this point are required in future .",
    "we have investigated the effect of photodesorption on the ice - condensation front and on the surface snow line position in a protoplanetary disk around a herbig ae / be star .",
    "this study is inspired by the detection of an absorption feature of water ice at the wavelength 3  in the scattered light from the surface of the disk around hd142527 by @xcite .",
    "we have used 1 + 1d plane - parallel radiative transfer algorithm by @xcite and @xcite to obtain the temperature and density structure in the disk .",
    "then we have determined the amount of water ice particles by the balance between photodesorption , sublimation , and condensation , following @xcite .",
    "we find that the effect of photodesorption depresses the ice - condensation front toward the mid - plane and pushes the surface snow line outward significantly .",
    "we also find that the surface snow line position is determined by the balance between photodesorption and condensation for a higher effective temperature of the central star , while it is determined by the balance between sublimation and condensation for a lower effective temperature .",
    "we define the switching point of the two balances in the effective temperature as the critical temperature .",
    "the surface snow line is located at a small disk radius ( @xmath170 several tens of au ) if the stellar effective temperature is lower than the critical temperature . in the opposite case ,",
    "the surface snow line moves outward rapidly and tends to be at a large disk radius ( @xmath171 several hundreds of au ) due to efficient photodesorption .",
    "we also derive an analytic formula to describe the critical temperature as a function of stellar and disk parameters .",
    "we discuss a few implications for the observation of the surface snow line in circumstellar disks .",
    "we plot the critical temperature as a function of the stellar luminosity on the hr diagram .",
    "this indicates the boundary between two mechanisms determining the position of the surface snow line : the sublimation  condensation balance and the photodesorption  condensation balance .",
    "most of herbig ae / be stars are found in the photodesorption area .",
    "we also plot the line which gives the position of the surface snow line of 100 au on the hr diagram .",
    "hd142527 is found slightly above the line , suggesting the surface snow line of the hd142527 disk is located at 100300 au from the central star .",
    "this is consistent with the observations by @xcite which indicated the surface snow line was located at @xmath172 au .",
    "we also find that there are many herbig ae / be stars whose snow line on the disk surface is @xmath173 au or even @xmath174 au . it is difficult to detect water ice particles on the surface of the disk around these stars , which will be easily confirmed by observations . finally , we also find that the surface snow line position depends on the dust grain size by a complex way , which is worth investigating more thoroughly in future .",
    "we thank the referee for her / his constructive comments which were useful to improve the clarity of this manuscript very much .",
    "here , we introduce details of our calculations to determine the density and temperature structure of a circumstellar disk . our method is based on @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite      the dynamical structure of the disk in the vertical direction is assumed to be determined by the balance between the vertical component of the gravitational force by the central star and the gas pressure gradient ( hydrostatic equilibrium ) ; @xmath175 where @xmath176 , @xmath177 , @xmath178 , and @xmath96 are the gas pressure , the gas volumetric density , the gravitational constant , and the mass of the central star , respectively .",

    ", we need the mid - plane density @xmath184 as the normalization of @xmath177 .",
    "this is given by equating the surface density @xmath185 with the integral of @xmath177 along @xmath12 as @xmath186 the surface density @xmath185 is given by equation ( 1 ) .",
    "the temperature in the disk is determined by the balance between the cooling and heating .",
    "the disk is heated by the irradiation from the central star .",
    "we ignore the heating by the viscous dissipation of the disk gas , because the snow line at the disk surface is located at relatively outer part of the disk where the viscous heating is negligibly small compared with the heating by the irradiation of the central star .",
    "the cooling rate in the disk is determined by the radiation energy transfer and the convection is not taken into account because of the low density in the disk .",
    "assuming a plane - parallel structure along the @xmath12-axis in an annulus at a certain @xmath11 , the equation of the radiative transfer is given by @xmath187 where @xmath22 , @xmath188 , @xmath189 , @xmath190 , and @xmath191 are the cosine of the angle between the propagation direction and the @xmath12-axis , the frequency , the specific intensity , the extinction coefficient , and the source function , respectively .",
    "the subscripts @xmath22 and @xmath188 of each quantity represent the direction cosine and the frequency of that quantity .",

    "2002 ) as @xmath196 where @xmath19 , @xmath197 , and @xmath198 are the grazing angle ( i.e. incidence angle of the radiation from the central star into the disk surface ) , the luminosity of the central star , and the optical depth between a point @xmath10 and the infinity along the vertical direction @xmath199 , respectively . in this study , we set @xmath200 throughout of the disk for simplicity which is a typical value of the grazing angle .",
